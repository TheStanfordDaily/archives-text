## Admissions favors select candidates 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
While high school students
around the world anxiously await
university admissions decisions,
some applicants may have less
cause for concern due to unique
privileges gained from special
connections with their schools of
choice. According to former Uni
versity admissions officers and
college admissions experts, the
difference made for those appli
cantsâ€” including legacies, chil
dren of faculty and development
cases may, in some cases,
bridge the gap between accept
ance and rejection.
Though Dean of Admissions
Richard Shaw declined to com
ment on the issue, several promi
nent University figures, including
President John Hennessy, have
supported the preferences af
forded to select applicants.

Publicizing preferences
According to the charge for
the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Undergraduate Admission
and Financial Aid (C-UAFA), the
Committee has the power to de
termine "the general criteria un
der which applicants may be giv
en special consideration because
of distinctive characteristics."

The charge lists examples of
these characteristics, including
"applicants whose parents gradu
ated from Stanford or are on the
Stanford faculty or staff, those
with highly developed specific tal
ents, members of ethnic minori
ties, or others who lend a desir
able diversity to the class."
The charge also states that
the Faculty Senate is responsible
for deciding "the general extent
of preference" given to applicants
in these special categories.

Associate Professor of Music
Mark Applebaum, chair of the C
UAFA, declined to comment on
the decisions made by this year's
Faculty Senate regarding these
preference.
This section of the charge has
been a subject of controversy in
the past, however. At a Faculty
Senate meeting on Oct. 7, 2010,
Professor of Computer Science
Eric Roberts questioned whether
or not the Committee should list
the types of applicants that could
receive special consideration.

"The idea was that these were
things were in practice already
and it was good to lay it out be
fore the committee to carry that
forward," said David Palumbo-
Liu, professor of comparative lit
erature, at the meeting. "I take
your point that by specifying it,

you draw attention to it. On the
other hand, it seems to be some
thing the public is well aware of
already."
President John Hennessy
weighed in, arguing that Stanford
should set a precedent of deter
mining its own admissions crite
ria based on the University's
needs.
"I think we will find ourselves,
as will the rest of higher educa
tion, increasingly trying to pro
tect our rights to decide who are
the best students to come to
Stanford, just as we did in the
Michigan case with affirmative
action," Hennessey said at the
meeting. "We need to protect our
right to make that decision."

Karen Cook '6B M.A. '7O Ph.D.
'73, professor of sociology, agreed
with Hennessy.
"The one advantage to this list
is it is 'truth in lending,' " Cook
said at the meeting. "I mean, this
is what we do admit legacies
and people in all these cate
gories."

Substantial number of students

Though Stanford does not re
lease statistics on the percentage
of legacies in each incoming class,
Daniel Golden, author of "The
Price of Admission: How Ameri
ca's Ruling Class Buys Its Way
into Elite Colleges and Who
Gets Left Outside the Gates" es
timated that this number fluctu
ates between 15 and 20 percent
each year.
Golden, who conferred with
sources in the Office of Under
graduate Admission while writ
ing his book, said that the major
ity of accepted legacies would not
have been admitted without the
benefit of their legacy status.
"I would say a few of them
would get in anyway because
they're remarkable students,
some would be on the bubble and
most of them would not get in,"
Golden said, adding that even if
the applicant's parents do not
give money to the University, "it
still helps to be the child of an
alum."

Jon Reider '67 Ph.D. 'B3, who
worked in the Office of Under
graduate Admissions from 1985
to 2000, agreed that legacies re
ceive a significant boost in admis
sions. He estimated that legacy
applicants are currently admitted
to Stanford at more than twice
the admit rate for non-legacy ap
plicants.

A study conducted in 2011 by
Michael Hurwitz, a researcher at
the Harvard Graduate School of
Education, also concluded that ad
mission rates for legacies are much
higher than for the general appli
cant pool. In his study, Hurwitz an
alyzed the impact of legacy prefer
ence on admissions using data from
30 selective colleges across the
country.
After controlling for a variety of
factors, including SAT scores, Hur
witz found that "primary legacies,"
which he defined as the children of
alumni who attended the college as an
undergraduate, earned an advantage
equivalent to a 45.1 percentage point
increase in chance of admission.

"Although the admissions advan
tage received by legacy applicants
may strike some readers as unac
ceptably large, I urge readers to
consider that donations from alumni
are increasingly important to the
well-being of this paper's sampled
colleges," Hurwitz concluded.
However, Richard Kahlenberg,
senior fellow at The Century Founda
tion and editor of 'Affirmative Action
for the Rich: Legacy Preferences in
College Admissions," took issue with
colleges factoring legacy preference
into admissions decisions.

"Legacies, by definition, are the
offspring of those who have already
completed college, and if it's an elite
college, then the child has had all
sorts of advantages already," Kahlen
berg said. "So to provide a prefer
ence to the already advantaged
strikes me as compounding the in
equalities that other students face."
According to Kahlenberg, many
colleges defend legacy preference by
arguing that "alums are more likely to
give donations if their kids are provid
ed preferences," though he claimed
that this was untrue.

Kahlenberg referenced a study
conducted for 'Affirmative Action for
the Rich," in which researchers exam
ined 75 universities with legacy pref
erence and 25 without it. They con
cluded that the "existence of a legacy
preference does not increase giving
for universities."

Golden agreed that universities
would not suffer financially by elimi
nating legacy preference, and argued
that colleges should feel confident
that they can raise money without
"promising admission."
"They should be able to say,
'Look, we have this great program
that will save the world, please con
tribute to it,' or look to alumni and
say, 'Please contribute because you
had a wonderful time here,"' Golden
said.

Both Golden and Kahlenberg
said that they thought Stanford
would never "willingly give up lega
cy preference," but agreed that the
Supreme Court's decision in the case
of Fisher v. Texas could motivate a
change in policy.
Though the decision that affirma
tive action is unconstitutional will on
ly apply to public universities,

Kahlenberg said that it might also
apply to a civil rights statute that
private schools have to abide by in
order to receive federal funding.
"If the Supreme Court eliminates
affirmative action for minorities,
there will be a lot of pressure on
schools to eliminate legacy prefer
ence, which predominantly benefits
white students," Golden said. "If you
eliminate minority affirmative ac
tion, how can you justify white affir
mative action?"

The weight of money
While legacies may receive a sig
nificant boost in the admissions
process, Golden said that "develop
ment cases," a term that refers to
the children of important donors or
potential donors, receive an even
more substantial advantage.
"It can be as big as 400 or 500
points out of 1600 on the SAT, using
the old 1600-point scale," Golden
said. "It can help a student with a
score of 1100 out of 1600 get into a
top university."
Golden said that wealthy parents
sometimes use private counselors
with contacts in admissions offices to
indicate that they are likely to do
nate large sums of money if their
child is admitted.

"There's not an explicit quid pro
quo they don't say 'We'll give you
five million dollars if you let our son
in' but there is kind of an implicit
understanding," Golden said.
According to Bev Taylor, presi
dent and founder of the college con
sulting business The Ivy Coach, both
legacies and development cases bene
fit from the fact that admissions of
fices will look for reasons to accept
them.

"They'll get a better read or
they'll get a second read, they'll get
a second look. 'How can we accept
this kid?' is the question," Taylor
said. "Instead of looking to see
what's wrong here, let's look to see
how we can accept this kid."
Taylor said that in many cases
where a student has a special con
nection to the University, colleges
look to protect then- endowments by
admitting applicants who would oth
erwise not gain admission.
"Whether it's legacy or develop
ment or children of faculty, it's the
family that's responsible for the en
dowment, so the college feels obli
gated to that pay back," Taylor said.

Both Golden and Reider refer
enced Margaret Bass 'O2 as an ex
ample of a classic development case.
Bass is the daughter of Robert Bass
MBA '74, who was the chair of the
University's Board of Trustees from
1996-2000 and donated $25 million to
Stanford in 1991 and $5O million to
the Graduate School of Business in
2005.

According to an article by Golden
published in the Wall Street Journal,
Bass was ranked 40th in her class of

79 at Groton High School. Out of the
nine students from Groton that ap
plied to Stanford that year, she was
the only one accepted, though she
had the second lowest SAT score of
the Groton applicant group.
Her SAT score of 1220, out of
1600, was significantly lower than
that of the typical Stanford student.
When Bass applied in 1998, 75 per
cent of incoming freshmen had an
SAT score of at least 1360.
"She was admitted because of her
last name, and because the family
was a big, big donor to Stanford,"
Reider said.
Robin Mamlet was the Dean of
Undergraduate Admission at Stan
ford when Bass was accepted. In his
article, Golden quoted Mamlet as
saying that she "will certainly factor
in a history of very significant giving
to Stanford" when making admis
sions decisions.
Mamlet also said that the Office
of Development gave her a list of ap
plicants who were children of signifi
cant donors, which Reider said is not
unusual. According to Reider, the ad
missions office is presented with this
list every year, which includes not
only children of large donors but al
so the children of people who are
"important to the University."
"Being important doesn't just
mean giving a lot of money it
means having the potential to give a
lot of money or having the potential
to get other people to give a lot of
money," Reider said. "There are a lot
of ways you can be a development
case you don't have to be extraor
dinarily rich."
Although Reider could not give a
specific number for how much mon

ey an applicant's parents would have
to donate for the applicant to be con
sidered a development case, a July
2012 Palo Alto Patch article identi
fied a $500,000 threshold, citing two
anonymous sources connected to
Stanford's admissions process.
Faculty connections
Reider said that if he could
choose any "hook" to have as an ap
plicant, he would want to be the child
of a faculty member. According to
Reider, being the child of a faculty
member means that "you're already
connected," making it difficult for
the Office of Admission to issue a re
jection.
"Influential professors can fur
ther leverage their influence to gain
their student's admission by threat
ening to move valuable research
funding to another university," said
Irena Smith, a former Stanford ad
missions officer, to The Palo Alto
Patch. "If it is well-known that a fac
ulty member gets angry, he will go
elsewhere, then that's something
that is considered."
Swart said that children of facul
ty members also benefit from having
a "direct line to the Dean's office," as
faculty are able to "get in direct
touch with senior admissions officers
to lobby on their children's behalf."
Golden said that in other types of
special cases, some applicants, such
as children of politicians or celebri
ties, also get a "substantial boost" in
the admissions process.
According to Golden, admissions
officers will go to what they consider
the "lowest limit" that a student
will be able to graduate for a se
lect few candidates.

"They'll go that far for a top ath
lete or a child of a big donor or some
body who's politically important,"
Golden said. "They'll go quite a
ways."

Reider noted that a student could
get a boost in the admissions process
simply by being associated with a
prominent figure in the University.
Reider referenced an applicant who
was in the middle of his high school
class but was admitted because he
was the nephew of a dean of one of
the graduate schools.
"He wasn't a faculty child or a
legacy. To me it was a slam dunk that
you don't take him," Reider said.
"But the Dean [of Admissions] said,
'lt's probably good to have friends in
the graduate schools.'"
Taylor said that she has seen sev
eral of her clients gain admission to
top schools like Duke and Stanford
because they benefited from the
preferential treatment afforded to
what she called "celebrity kids."
One of Taylor's clients, the crown
prince to "a significant country," was
admitted to Stanford with a relative
ly low GPA and test scores. Accord
ing to Taylor, there was "absolutely
no way" he would have been admit
ted if he hadn't been an important
political figure.
"Maybe one day he'll come and
give a commencement address,"
Taylor said. "It's not always about
the money, it's about who these kids
are, what they will contribute in life
and how proud the school will be to
say that this kid was educated at
Stanford."

Previous Stanford admissions officers and experts on college admissions claim that the Office of Admission
favors applicants with connections to the University, including legacies, children of faculty members and children
of large donors or potential donors One officer said that being a faculty child helped the most.
