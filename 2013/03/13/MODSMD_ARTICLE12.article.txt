## Telecommuting ban may harm Yahoo 
### GRACE CHAO 
A recent decision by Yahoo! CEO
Marissa Mayer '97 M.S. '99 to imple
ment a ban on telecommuting pre
cluding employees from working
from home may have detrimental
effects on both worker productivity
and morale, according to faculty ex
perts.

"To become the absolute best
place to work, communication and
collaboration will be important, so we
need to be working side-by-side,"
Mayer wrote in a memo to employ
ees. "Speed and quality are often sac
rificed when [employees] work from
home."

Just three days prior to the mem
o's distribution, Nicholas Bloom, pro
fessor of economics, published a
study called "Does Working Prom
Home Work? Evidence from a Chi
nese Experiment." The study found
that employees who worked from
home enjoyed a 13 percent increase
in productivity compared to them of
fice-bound peers, and has since been
extensively cited in articles contest
ing Mayer's approach.
"It's very far out there to say that
no one [at all] can work at home,"
Bloom said. "I can see two reasons
[for the extreme action]. One [is] to
'reset' everything and reconnect peo
ple to the office. The second is that it's
a cheap way to downsize to make
people quit."
Bloom speculated that Yahoo!
might briefly increase productivity
by getting rid of the small percentage
of employees who are inefficient in
telecommuting, with the blanket ban
likely to be relaxed later on.
"I'd bet money that one year from
now at least the high-performing em-

ployees will be allowed to work one or
two days a week from home," Bloom
said. "But right now, they're going
from one extreme to the other. It's
like going from a one-wheeled bicycle
to a three-wheeled one neither one
is very productive."
While acknowledging that his
study's subjects call center em
ployees may not be wholly compa
rable to Yahoo! workers, Bloom as
serted that the benefits of telecom
muting, such as exposure to fewer
distractions, remain constant across
industries. He noted, however, that
the high levels of motivation found in
most high-tech workers might limit
the variation in output between home
and the office.

"If they wanted to slack off, it
would be pretty easy to slack off in
the office," he said. "They wouldn't
have to go home for it."
Shelley Correll M.A. '96 Ph.D. 'Ol,
director of the Clayman Institute for
Gender Research and professor of so
ciology, agreed that a relaxed version
of Mayer's policy might ultimately
benefit Yahoo! the most.

"With jobs today, just being there
doesn't mean better productivity,"
Correll said. "We all want to meet up
some time, but this doesn't require it

being Monday through Friday."
Correll cited her own employees
as an example. The dayman Insti
tute's 12 employees have varying
schedules some work part-time,
some work from home but every
one must be in the office on Thursday.
Yahool's ban would not only affect
the several hundred customer service
employees who work full-time from
home, but also high-tech workers
who work a few days a week at home,
with mothers making up a substantial
percentage of the latter category.
"[The ban] would decrease pro
ductivity and employee morale ... it
would cause some employees to quit,
especially since women normally
don't have someone else at home to
take care of problems for them," Cor
rell said.

While Mayer came under addi
tional criticism from several commen
tators because she is a new mother
herself, Correll criticized that line of
attack, citing research showing that
female leaders tend to be more heav
ily criticized than their male counter
parts.
"The ways that people stereotype
leaders overlap greatly with stereo
types about men," Correll said. "So
when women act like leaders, as
sertively or powerfully, that contra
dicts our expectations of them to be
nice and warm, for example."
"In my opinion [the ban] is a bad
business decision, but I don't think
it's right to expect more of her than
someone else," Correll added. "We
should judge her decision just as we
would have judged a man making this
decision."
