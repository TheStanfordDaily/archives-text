## Peaking and streaking at the right time 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
In NBA Jam (only one of the
greatest arcade games ever
created) a player could enter
"on-fire" mode by making
three baskets in a row. When in
this mode, a player was bestowed in
finite turbo and pretty much made
every shot.
"On-fire" mode was pretty much
the god-mode cheat code in NBA
Jam, except it wasn't a cheat it was
part of standard gameplay. Needless
to say, I probably spent over $2OO
plugging quarters into NBA Jam ar
cade machines. I also wished that I
myself could enter "on-fire" mode,
mainly to wreak havoc and destruc
tion with the flames shooting out of
my arse, but also because I wished
that I could be unstoppable at some
thing, even if it was for a limited time.
How does this relate to actual
sports, you might ask. Hang tight,
we're about to get there. I hadn't re
ally reminisced much on that part of
my childhood until recently, when
every sport I watched seemed to
have an "on-fire" team. To whit:
The Baltimore Ravens won the
Super Bowl on the strength of a 5-1
record down the stretch (their only
loss was in week 17, when they had al
ready clinched a playoff berth) and
some divine intervention.
The Chicago Blackhawks didn't
lose a game in regulation for the first
24 games of the season. Lest I under
state the absurdity of this streak,
some teams won't win 24 games in a
lockout-shortened season at all (cue
Winnipeg Jets fans nodding sadly).
The Miami Heat continue to
pound the rest of the league; as this
column was being poetically penned,
they beat the Pacers for their 18th
consecutive win, most of them deci
sive, thanks to the completely ludi
crous play of Le√üron James, who ap
peal's to be an alien sent to Earth to
dominate our basketball leagues.
In the world of soccer, Real
Madrid football club, having looked
sluggish, sloppy and silly for much of
its season, finally decided to put petty
squabbles aside and come together as
a team. In the course of the last two
weeks, Ronaldo and Co. have won
nine consecutive matches in La Liga,
beaten FC Barcelona three times and
advanced to the Champions League
quarterfinals. All of this occurred de
spite the fact that earlier in the sea
son Ronaldo was "sad," Iker Casillas
was benched and then' coach Jose
Mourinho had done all but beg Real
Madrid to fire him.
There is but one common thread
to this whole sequence of events: a
team catching fire, NBA Jam-style.
However, I'm going to go out on a
limb and say that none, yes none (you
heard me right) of these teams will
win then' respective titles.
Many experts have debated the
merits of a team peaking at the right
time; in many sports, the team that
ends up with silverware to add to its
trophy cabinet is the team that rolls
up a winning streak at the end of the
regular season and continues it into
the playoffs. One of the harsh reali
ties of any sport is that very few
teams can be perfect throughout an
entire season. The more games a
team plays, the more luck and ran
dom opportunities come into play and
the more chances for a miraculous
upset to occur.
When the 1972 Miami Dolphins
went undefeated, they played a grand
total of 17 games, with a 14-0 mark in
the regular season and a 3-0 mark in
postseason play. Twenty-five years
later, when the 2007 New England
Patriots looked to challenge that
mark, they played 19 games, losing
the Super Bowl in heartbreaking
fashion. In retrospect, it's pretty in
teresting to compare the two teams'
relative progressions. The Dolphins
started slow and picked up steam,
with small margins of victory early
and enormous margins later on in the
season. The Patriots, on the other
hand, opened the season on a tear,
ripping through the earlier half of
their schedule. But they could never
recreate that magic later on in the
season, and it cost them in the play
offs, where they barely held off the
Chargers in the AFC title game and
eventually succumbed to the Giants.
If you don't believe me, look to
other sports. Few would argue that
last year's Champions League win
ner, Chelsea, was the most talented
squad. Yet the team managed to up
set Barcelona and Bayern en route to
claiming an improbable Champions
League title. The San Francisco Gi
ants weren't the most loaded squad,
yet they peaked just as the playoffs
rolled around and won their second
World Series title in three years. The
Dallas Mavericks of the 2010-11 NBA
