# ROUTED BY REBELS

### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
There are three parts to a base
ball game: pitching, hitting and de
fense. A team that does two out of
the three well will usually succeed.
This Friday and Sunday, Stanford
could only pitch effectively; on Sat
urday, the Cardinal could not find
any of the three aspects of its
game.

All that spelled an unexpected
sweep for unranked UNLV

against the No. 9 Cardinal at
Sunken Diamond this weekend.
Stanford (10-2) entered the se
ries on a nine-game winning
streak carried by pitching and de
fense. On Friday night, senior
starting pitcher Mark Appel once
again provided the pitching.
Appel struck out a career-high
15 Rebels in seven innings, allow
ing only one earned run on four
hits. It was another great outing
for Appel, who has pitched as well
as ever over his last three starts.

"That's a big league pitcher out
there on that mound," said junior
catcher Brant Whiting about his
ace. "It's always a joy to watch him
pitch and do his thing."
But UNLV scored two un
earned runs in the second inning
on three Stanford errors and nev

er looked back en route to a 3-2
victory.
Stanford did witness a hitting
resurgence from the left side of its
infield. Sophomore third baseman
Alex Blandino and junior short
stop Lonnie Kauppila combined
for five of the Cardinal's seven Fri
day hits. Blandino led the charge
with a towering solo home run to
left field, his first of the season,
and finished 3-for-4.
But Stanford just couldn't
jumpstart things the following day.
It seemed like one of those after
noons where Murphy's Law was in
full effect for those in a Cardinal
uniform.
Sophomore starting pitcher
John Hochstatter (0-1) did not
have his best command. He lasted
two innings before Stanford
turned to freshman Daniel Stal
wart, who had previously proven
himself as a very reliable option.
But Starwalt did not have his
stuff going either. The righthander
give up five runs (four earned) in
two-plus innings on the mound,
and just like that, Stanford found
itself in an insurmountable 7-2
hole.
The two players with the best
games of the afternoon for Stan
ford came from unfamiliar faces.
Whiting, who got the start at
catcher over sophomore Wayne
Taylor, continued his early-season
success at the plate. Whiting went
2-for-2 with a walk, an RBI and a
run scored, earning himself a sec
ond consecutive start at catcher
Sunday afternoon.
"I love playing back there,"
Whiting said. "Unfortunately we
