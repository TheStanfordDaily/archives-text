# ROUTED BY REBELS
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
There are three parts to a base
ball game: pitching, hitting and de
fense. A team that does two out of
the three well will usually succeed.
This Friday and Sunday, Stanford
could only pitch effectively; on Sat
urday, the Cardinal could not find
any of the three aspects of its
game.

All that spelled an unexpected
sweep for unranked UNLV

against the No. 9 Cardinal at
Sunken Diamond this weekend.
Stanford (10-2) entered the se
ries on a nine-game winning
streak carried by pitching and de
fense. On Friday night, senior
starting pitcher Mark Appel once
again provided the pitching.
Appel struck out a career-high
15 Rebels in seven innings, allow
ing only one earned run on four
hits. It was another great outing
for Appel, who has pitched as well
as ever over his last three starts.

"That's a big league pitcher out
there on that mound," said junior
catcher Brant Whiting about his
ace. "It's always a joy to watch him
pitch and do his thing."
But UNLV scored two un
earned runs in the second inning
on three Stanford errors and nev

er looked back en route to a 3-2
victory.
Stanford did witness a hitting
resurgence from the left side of its
infield. Sophomore third baseman
Alex Blandino and junior short
stop Lonnie Kauppila combined
for five of the Cardinal's seven Fri
day hits. Blandino led the charge
with a towering solo home run to
left field, his first of the season,
and finished 3-for-4.
But Stanford just couldn't
jumpstart things the following day.
It seemed like one of those after
noons where Murphy's Law was in
full effect for those in a Cardinal
uniform.
Sophomore starting pitcher
John Hochstatter (0-1) did not
have his best command. He lasted
two innings before Stanford
turned to freshman Daniel Stal
wart, who had previously proven
himself as a very reliable option.
But Starwalt did not have his
stuff going either. The righthander
give up five runs (four earned) in
two-plus innings on the mound,
and just like that, Stanford found
itself in an insurmountable 7-2
hole.
The two players with the best
games of the afternoon for Stan
ford came from unfamiliar faces.
Whiting, who got the start at
catcher over sophomore Wayne
Taylor, continued his early-season
success at the plate. Whiting went
2-for-2 with a walk, an RBI and a
run scored, earning himself a sec
ond consecutive start at catcher
Sunday afternoon.
"I love playing back there,"
Whiting said. "Unfortunately we

Sophomore third baseman Alex Blandino (right), expected to be one of the Card's top power hitters,
homered for the first time this season last Friday, but Stanford lost all three of its games to visiting UNLV
had a tough day."
Though Stanford's pitch
ing returned on Sunday in
the form of freshman starter
Bobby Zarubin, the Cardi
nal's hitting and defense
failed it once again. UNLV
scored four unearned runs on
two errors in the seventh in
ning to break a 1-1 tie, ensur
ing a 5-1 victory and an un
likely series sweep.
The inning started out in
nocently; Zarubin, who had
allowed only one earned run
through six innings, induced
a weak groundout to retire
the first Rebel. But pinch-hit
ter Ryan Scott singled, and
the wheels came off from
there.

The next two Rebels each
grounded into a fielder's
choice, but Stanford could
not record an out on either.
Kauppila couldn't handle a
potential double-play-start
ing throw from first baseman

Brian Ragira, and Whiting
couldn't hang onto the base
ball on a home plate collision
after a safety squeeze.
UNLV added two singles,
the first off Zarubin and the
second off junior relief pitch
er Sam Lindquist, to score
three more runs and blow the
game open. When the dust fi
nally settled, four unearned
runs had scored and the
game was lost.
For Stanford, which had
been fielding well through
the first few weeks of the sea
son, the poor defense
throughout the sweep came
as a shock.

"When we're going well,
what we do well [is] pitching
and defense," Ragira said
Sunday. "I think defense left
us a little bit this weekend.
Pitching, except for yester
day's blowout, [was] pretty
solid Friday, pretty solid
again today."
But for Stanford, the big
ger concern might be
whether the hitting will even
tually pick up. Stanford's
bats have been reeling with
out junior slugger Austin

Wilson, who is recovering
from an elbow injury that has
cost him all but the first game
of the season.

Stanford is averaging just
3.67 runs per game on the
season, an enormous drop-off
from last season's 6.69 aver
age. A big reason for that has
been an inability to hit with
runners on base.

"[lt's] just timely hit
ting," Ragira said. "We were
getting guys on base ...

Whenever we have guys in
scoring position, it's just
coming up with that timely
hit. When we get losses, we
don't have that, and I think
that's what happened this
weekend. During our nine
game win streak they were
coming."
Stanford will have to hope
that those hits come soon.
The Cardinal has 11 days off
for finals break before host
ing Utah for the start of Pac
-12 play on March 22 at
Sunken Diamond. First
pitch is scheduled for 7 p.m.

Sophomore starting pitcher
John Hochstatter (0-1) did not

3/3, Sunken Diamond

Sophomore third baseman Alex Blandino (right), expected to be one of the Card's top power hitters,
homered for the first time this season last Friday, but Stanford lost all three of its games to visiting UNLV
had a tough day."
Though Stanford's pitch
ing returned on Sunday in
the form of freshman starter
Bobby Zarubin, the Cardi
nal's hitting and defense
failed it once again. UNLV
scored four unearned runs on
two errors in the seventh in
ning to break a 1-1 tie, ensur
ing a 5-1 victory and an un
likely series sweep.
The inning started out in
nocently; Zarubin, who had
allowed only one earned run
through six innings, induced
a weak groundout to retire
the first Rebel. But pinch-hit
ter Ryan Scott singled, and
the wheels came off from
there.

The next two Rebels each
grounded into a fielder's
choice, but Stanford could
not record an out on either.
Kauppila couldn't handle a
potential double-play-start
ing throw from first baseman

Brian Ragira, and Whiting
couldn't hang onto the base
ball on a home plate collision
after a safety squeeze.
UNLV added two singles,
the first off Zarubin and the
second off junior relief pitch
er Sam Lindquist, to score
three more runs and blow the
game open. When the dust fi
nally settled, four unearned
runs had scored and the
game was lost.
For Stanford, which had
been fielding well through
the first few weeks of the sea
son, the poor defense
throughout the sweep came
as a shock.

"When we're going well,
what we do well [is] pitching
and defense," Ragira said
Sunday. "I think defense left
us a little bit this weekend.
Pitching, except for yester
day's blowout, [was] pretty
solid Friday, pretty solid
again today."
But for Stanford, the big
ger concern might be
whether the hitting will even
tually pick up. Stanford's
bats have been reeling with
out junior slugger Austin

Wilson, who is recovering
from an elbow injury that has
cost him all but the first game
of the season.

Stanford is averaging just
3.67 runs per game on the
season, an enormous drop-off
from last season's 6.69 aver
age. A big reason for that has
been an inability to hit with
runners on base.

"[lt's] just timely hit
ting," Ragira said. "We were
getting guys on base ...

Whenever we have guys in
scoring position, it's just
coming up with that timely
hit. When we get losses, we
don't have that, and I think
that's what happened this
weekend. During our nine
game win streak they were
coming."
Stanford will have to hope
that those hits come soon.

There are three parts to a base
ball game: pitching, hitting and de
fense. A team that does two out of
the three well will usually succeed.
This Friday and Sunday, Stanford
could only pitch effectively; on Sat
urday, the Cardinal could not find
any of the three aspects of its
game.

All that spelled an unexpected
sweep for unranked UNLV

against the No. 9 Cardinal at
Sunken Diamond this weekend.
Stanford (10-2) entered the se
ries on a nine-game winning
streak carried by pitching and de
fense. On Friday night, senior
starting pitcher Mark Appel once
again provided the pitching.
Appel struck out a career-high
15 Rebels in seven innings, allow
ing only one earned run on four
hits. It was another great outing
for Appel, who has pitched as well
as ever over his last three starts.

"That's a big league pitcher out
there on that mound," said junior
catcher Brant Whiting about his
ace. "It's always a joy to watch him
pitch and do his thing."
But UNLV scored two un
earned runs in the second inning
on three Stanford errors and nev

er looked back en route to a 3-2
victory.
Stanford did witness a hitting
resurgence from the left side of its
infield. Sophomore third baseman
Alex Blandino and junior short
stop Lonnie Kauppila combined
for five of the Cardinal's seven Fri
day hits. Blandino led the charge
with a towering solo home run to
left field, his first of the season,
and finished 3-for-4.
But Stanford just couldn't
jumpstart things the following day.
It seemed like one of those after
noons where Murphy's Law was in
full effect for those in a Cardinal
uniform.
