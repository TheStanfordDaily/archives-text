# TOURNEY TIME
## DO OR DIE FOR CARD'S NCAA HOPES 
### DAVID PEREZ BRADFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's basketball started the season by
winning four games in a row, and it will have to re
peat that win streak again in order to keep the sea
son alive.

The Cardinal travels to Las Vegas this week for
the Pac-12 Tournament, where it will face Arizona
State in the first round on Wednesday. To bring
home the title and receive the automatic bid to the
NCAA Tournament, Stanford needs to win four
games in four days, with the championship game

scheduled for Saturday night.
Stanford's regular season ended with two wins
in a row, including one at California in the season fi
nale. The victories put Stanford back at .500 in Pac
-12 play with a 9-9 conference record, and an 18-13
record overall.

The Pac-12 has been a lesson in parity all sea
son, which means the tournament is wide open. Top
seeded UCLA has five losses and the next three
teams all have six. Those teams have first-round
byes while the remaining eight square off first.
The first hurdle will be getting past Arizona
State (20-11, 9-9 Pac-12), who Stanford beat 62-59
in their only meeting this season.

Both teams have identical records in conference
play, but Stanford owns the eight seed and Arizona
State the nine seed for the Pac-12 Tournament.
