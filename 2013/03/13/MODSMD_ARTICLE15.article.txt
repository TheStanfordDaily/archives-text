# TOURNEY TIME
## DO OR DIE FOR CARD'S NCAA HOPES 
### DAVID PEREZ BRADFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's basketball started the season by
winning four games in a row, and it will have to re
peat that win streak again in order to keep the sea
son alive.

The Cardinal travels to Las Vegas this week for
the Pac-12 Tournament, where it will face Arizona
State in the first round on Wednesday. To bring
home the title and receive the automatic bid to the
NCAA Tournament, Stanford needs to win four
games in four days, with the championship game

scheduled for Saturday night.
Stanford's regular season ended with two wins
in a row, including one at California in the season fi
nale. The victories put Stanford back at .500 in Pac
-12 play with a 9-9 conference record, and an 18-13
record overall.

The Pac-12 has been a lesson in parity all sea
son, which means the tournament is wide open. Top
seeded UCLA has five losses and the next three
teams all have six. Those teams have first-round
byes while the remaining eight square off first.
The first hurdle will be getting past Arizona
State (20-11, 9-9 Pac-12), who Stanford beat 62-59
in their only meeting this season.

Both teams have identical records in conference
play, but Stanford owns the eight seed and Arizona
State the nine seed for the Pac-12 Tournament.

Sophomore point guard Chasson Randle (above) scored 30 points when Stanford met Arizona
State in last year's Pac-12 Tourney. The Card drew the Sun Devils again in this year's first round.
Stanford's backcourt dominated
the first meeting as both Junior
Dwight Powell and Junior Josh
Huestis recorded double-doubles.
Powell led all players with 22 points
to go with 10 rebounds. Huestis had
13 points and a game-high 12 re
bounds.

Huestis and Powell played a ma
jor role in holding Arizona State to
only 34 percent shooting as well,
with the duo combining for six
blocks.

Since the loss, the Sun Devils
have tumbled, having lost five of
their remaining seven games, in
cluding the last four.
Stanford has been average but
steady, going 4-3 over the home
stretch. Despite not having a league
title or NCAA at-large bid to play
for, head coach Johnny Dawkins has
liked the attitude and demeanor of
his team during the tail end of the
season.
"Our guys still want to play a lot
of basketball. Guys are still staying

around in the gym, they still come in
early, they're still leaving late,"
Dawkins said after the final home
game of the season.
That mentality and extra work
paid off as Stanford finished its sea
son sweep of Cal.
The Golden Bears are the only
team with a bye in the tournament
that Stanford has not lost to. The
Cardinal split its series with Ore
gon, lost the only game against Ari
zona and was swept by UCLA.
In Stanford's favor, though, is its
recent success in March. Starting
with last year's NIT run, Stanford
has won seven games in a row in this
month.
The Cardinal is 2-2 in neutral
site games this season, with both
losses coming in the Battle 4 At
lantis tournament during preseason
non-conference play. Stanford also
won a game there, as well as its sea
son opener against San Francisco,
which was played in Oakland.
The first round matchup will be
familiar for Stanford, as it is the
same as last year's. In the 2012 Pac
-12 tournament, Stanford blew out
Arizona State 85-65, propelled by
sophomore guard Chasson Randle's
30 points on 7-of-ll shooting.
Stanford faltered in the second
round in a 77-71 loss to California. It
would later receive a bid and win the
NIT tournament. Going into last
year's postseason, Stanford had a
slightly better 10-8 conference
record.
Colorado, which was the fifth
seed, ended up winning the Pac-12
tournament last year. The Buffs al
so won their first game in the
NCAA Tournament and are the
fifth seed once again this year.
The Card's only hope of making
it to The Big Dance this season is by
winning the Pac 12 Tournament
improbable, but not impossible. Its
journey will either end or begin
Wednesday against Arizona State.
