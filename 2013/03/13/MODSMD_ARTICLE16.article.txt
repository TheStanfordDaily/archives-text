# FOOTBALL PEAT'S PROVEN PUNCH
## STRONG SHOWING FOR SOPHOMORE 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
The wide receiving corps and sopho
more left tackle Andrus Peat starred
again as Stanford football finished off its
first session of spring practice with a
scrimmage-style open practice Saturday
afternoon.
Junior Ty Montgomery is likely to
lead the charge at receiver in the fall, but
the wildcard, junior Kelsey Young, came
up with the big play of the day on a route
Stanford fans aren't used to seeing from
the speedster.
Junior Kevin Hogan hit Young on a 46-
yard bomb that looked like the backyard
"just go deep" route. It was a welcome
sight for those in attendance, as the main
criticism of Hogan's performance last
season was his inaccuracy on those deep
passes.
But looking back at the first session of
spring practice, the biggest difference
seems to be a much improved offensive
line.
All the way through last year's Cardi
nal & White Spring Game, Stanford's vet
eran defense dominated the offense up
front, as the quarterbacks and running
backs didn't even have a chance.
This spring has been a different story,
and a lot of that is due to the emergence
of Peat at left tackle and the correspon
ding move by senior David Yankey back
to left guard.
Peat has drawn praise from his coach
es throughout the spring. Though he gave
up a sack to junior Kevin Anderson on
Saturday, Peat has been, in head coach
David Shaw's words, "phenomenal."
Mike Bloomgren, who coached the offen
sive line until receiving a promotion to of
fensive coordinator this season, said that
Peat "has come miles" since entering
Stanford's training camp last August.
But it's not just the coaching staff that
has taken notice of Peat's play. His team
mates on the offensive line including
Yankey, the senior anchor of the line
have been impressed as well.
"We always knew he had the physical
tools," Yankey said of Peat. "Even as a
true freshman he did some special things
physically and didn't completely grasp
the playbook. But he's just come such a
long way. He's really matured as a player,
and he's got the playbook down mentally
and he has the drive, the will you see
his frustration after bad reps and he's
gotten better every day."
One of the biggest keys to Peat's
emergence in his second season has been
his mastery of a deadly, open-handed
punch. Peat learned the move from his fa
ther, Todd, who played six seasons in the
NFL, and has used it very effective
ly throughout the spring.
Peat has also shown some agility
in addition to his power. Fifth-year
senior nickelback Usua Amanam,
who is one of the fastest players on
the team, tried an outside speed
rush again Peat on Saturday. The 6-
foot-7 Peat kept up with him without
a problem, pushing Amanam harm
lessly behind Hogan.
"He's quick," Peat said of
Amanam. "I made sure I got out of
my stance quick and just [got] ready
for him. He's a small guy, you've got
to bend down really far to block
him."

One other interesting tidbit to
take from Saturday's scrimmage
was the play of sophomore quarter
back Dallas Lloyd. Shaw used Lloyd
in an option package, similar to how
he used Hogan for the early part of
the 2012 season, and Lloyd was im
pressive.

Lloyd operated the triple-option
very smoothly from the shotgun.

Then he showed impressive foot
work rolling out across his body to
the left out of a great play-action
fake before eventually taking off for
a big gain.
"He's a great athlete," Shaw
said. "If that ends up translating to
the games, we'll see. But it's nice to
have another running quarterback
in the mix that can also throw. So we
had some fun."

"The thing is, our quarterbacks
aren't live in these periods, but that
drives him crazy. He wants to be
live. He wants to be tackled. He
wants to be hit and run through
guys. We made him live at the end,
and he did a good job."

Stanford now enters a three
week break for finals and spring
break. The Cardinal returns to ac
tion on April 1 for the second and
final two-week practice period
that will see the return of fifth
year senior linebacker Shayne
Skov and senior running back
Tyler Gaffney. The session finishes
with the Cardinal & White Spring
Game at Stanford Stadium at 3 p.m.
on April 13.

Sophomore Andrus Peat (70) has proven himself on the offensive line
in Stanford's first spring session, and the former ESPNU No.9 recruit
is the early favorite to take over the starting job at left tackle in 2013.
