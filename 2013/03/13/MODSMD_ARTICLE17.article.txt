# Swept in SoCal
## CARD FALLS TO SEVENTH 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
Fresh off two huge five
set victories over No. 5 Pep
perdine and No. 13 USC, the
Stanford men's volleyball
team was back on the road
this weekend, taking on No.
14 UC-Santa Barbara and
No. 6 UCLA, two teams that
it had defeated in its first
meetings earlier in the sea
son. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, the second time
around wasn't as successful,
as No. 4 Stanford was swept
in both games.

Stanford (12-8, 9-8
MPSF) was faced with a ma
jor problem from the start of
the match against Santa Bar
bara, as regular setter James
Shaw was out with injury,
forcing the entire offense to
need to make adjustments.
UCSB (9-12, 7-10) took
advantage of the untimely in-

jury at the start and cruised
out to an early lead. The Car
dinal was able to crawl back
into the game, but then the
Gauchos took over again, un
corking a 9-3 run that turned
a one-point advantage into a
25-18 victory.

Stanford started the sec
ond set on a roll, speeding to
a quick 7-3 lead, but UCSB
was again able to pull ahead
with a massive run. The Gau
chos took their first lead of
the set at 16-15 and didn't
look back, taking the second
25-19.

Thus, Stanford needed to
win set number three to
avoid being swept for just the
third time this season. It was
close throughout, neither
team able to gain much of an
advantage over the other, but
with the score locked at 16,
the Gauchos took over in a
manner similar to the first
set, riding a 9-3 run to win 25-
19.

Stanford had its second
worst-hitting performance of
the season, with just .165. No
Cardinal player hit above
.250, and while junior outside
hitters Brian Cook and
Steven Irvin combined for 26
kills, their teammates
chipped in just nine com
bined.

Two days later, the Cardi
nal was in Los Angeles to
face UCLA (13-9, 9-7). The
match was tight in the early
going, but a 4-0 run by the
Bruins put Stanford in a hole
from which it would not be
able to escape. The Cardinal
would eventually drop the
first set 25-21.
The second set was all
UCLA at the start, as the
Bruins jumped ahead to a
quick 8-2 lead. UCLA main
tained this large lead for
much of the set and had a set
point opportunity at 24-19.
Stanford rallied, however,
winning four straight points
to close within one. The Bru
ins, however, were able to
convert on that point and
take the set 25-23.

Thus, Stanford had to win
the third to avoid being swept
for the second straight game.
UCLA was able to edge
ahead, earning a match point
opportunity at 24-22, but
Stanford was able to convert
twice, tying the match at 24.

The crucial set continued
to be back and forth, with
both teams getting opportu
nities to win and neither able
to convert. Stanford's last op
portunity was at 27-26, but
UCLA had three straight
kills to finish off the Cardinal.
Stanford hit better in this
match at .358, but was unable
to limit the Bruins offensive
ly as UCLA hit .470. At the
same time, it didn't take ad
vantage of the home team's
poor service play; the Bruins
had 24 service errors in con
trast to just 14 for Stanford.

Irvin had a tremendous
game, with 18 kills on .593
hitting, as well as five digs,
while Cook chipped in 11
kills, hitting .304. Shaw also
performed well in his return
from injury, with 23 assists
and three digs.
The losses put Stanford in
a tough position, as it fell to
seventh in the MPSF. The
Cardinal will more than like
ly need to win the MPSF
tournament to gain a berth in
the NCAA Tournament, and
therefore every win is impor
tant. A top-four seed would
ensure Stanford home-court
advantage in at least the first
round of the playoffs. Cap
turing home-court advantage
is critical for Stanford as it is
9-1 at home, but just 3-7 on
the road.
Stanford will be on break
for the next two weeks for fi
nals but will return with
matches against No. 7 Cal
State Northridge and No. 3
Long Beach State on March
29 and 30, respectively.

3/1 0, Los Angeles

Junior outside hitter Brian Cook (above) had 26 kills in
Stanford's three-set losses at UCSB and UCLA. The
defeats dropped the Cardinal to seventh in the MPSF.
Fresh off two huge five
set victories over No. 5 Pep
perdine and No. 13 USC, the
Stanford men's volleyball
team was back on the road
this weekend, taking on No.
14 UC-Santa Barbara and
No. 6 UCLA, two teams that
it had defeated in its first
meetings earlier in the sea
son. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, the second time
around wasn't as successful,
as No. 4 Stanford was swept
in both games.

Stanford (12-8, 9-8
MPSF) was faced with a ma
jor problem from the start of
the match against Santa Bar
bara, as regular setter James
Shaw was out with injury,
forcing the entire offense to
need to make adjustments.
UCSB (9-12, 7-10) took
advantage of the untimely in-

jury at the start and cruised
out to an early lead. The Car
dinal was able to crawl back
into the game, but then the
Gauchos took over again, un
corking a 9-3 run that turned
a one-point advantage into a
25-18 victory.

Stanford started the sec
ond set on a roll, speeding to
a quick 7-3 lead, but UCSB
was again able to pull ahead
with a massive run. The Gau
chos took their first lead of
the set at 16-15 and didn't
look back, taking the second
25-19.

Thus, Stanford needed to
win set number three to
avoid being swept for just the
third time this season. It was
close throughout, neither
team able to gain much of an
advantage over the other, but
with the score locked at 16,
the Gauchos took over in a
manner similar to the first
set, riding a 9-3 run to win 25-
19.

Stanford had its second
worst-hitting performance of
the season, with just .165. No
Cardinal player hit above
.250, and while junior outside
hitters Brian Cook and
Steven Irvin combined for 26
kills, their teammates
chipped in just nine com
bined.

Two days later, the Cardi
nal was in Los Angeles to
face UCLA (13-9, 9-7). The
match was tight in the early
going, but a 4-0 run by the
Bruins put Stanford in a hole
from which it would not be
able to escape. The Cardinal
would eventually drop the
first set 25-21.
The second set was all
UCLA at the start, as the
Bruins jumped ahead to a
quick 8-2 lead. UCLA main
tained this large lead for
much of the set and had a set
point opportunity at 24-19.
Stanford rallied, however,
winning four straight points
to close within one. The Bru
ins, however, were able to
convert on that point and
take the set 25-23.

Thus, Stanford had to win
the third to avoid being swept
for the second straight game.
UCLA was able to edge
ahead, earning a match point
opportunity at 24-22, but
Stanford was able to convert
twice, tying the match at 24.

The crucial set continued
to be back and forth, with
both teams getting opportu
nities to win and neither able
to convert. Stanford's last op
portunity was at 27-26, but
UCLA had three straight
kills to finish off the Cardinal.
Stanford hit better in this
match at .358, but was unable
to limit the Bruins offensive
ly as UCLA hit .470. At the
same time, it didn't take ad
vantage of the home team's
poor service play; the Bruins
had 24 service errors in con
trast to just 14 for Stanford.

Irvin had a tremendous
game, with 18 kills on .593
hitting, as well as five digs,
while Cook chipped in 11
kills, hitting .304. Shaw also
performed well in his return
from injury, with 23 assists
and three digs.
The losses put Stanford in
a tough position, as it fell to
seventh in the MPSF. The
Cardinal will more than like
ly need to win the MPSF
tournament to gain a berth in
the NCAA Tournament, and
therefore every win is impor
tant. A top-four seed would
ensure Stanford home-court
advantage in at least the first
round of the playoffs. Cap
turing home-court advantage
is critical for Stanford as it is
9-1 at home, but just 3-7 on
the road.
Stanford will be on break
for the next two weeks for fi
nals but will return with
matches against No. 7 Cal
State Northridge and No. 3
Long Beach State on March
29 and 30, respectively.
