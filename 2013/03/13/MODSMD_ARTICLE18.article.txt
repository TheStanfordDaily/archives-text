# No picnic for Card at NCAAs
## 
### ANNA BLUE STAFF WRITER 
This past weekend at the NCAA Indoor Track
and Field Championships, Stanford faced chal
lenging odds, and not many in its favor. With
much fanfare, fourteen Cardinal athletes trav
eled the 1,820 miles to Randal tyson Track Cen
ter at the University of Arkansas on Wednesday
to join in a gathering of the speediest and
strongest runners in the country, all ranked with
in the top-16 performers in the country in their
respective events.

For Stanford, only three of the thirteen run
ners who competed in last year's championship
meet returned this year for a second go, a fact
that emphasized not only the relatively small size
of the Stanford track program, but also the youth
of the team after the loss of so many valuable sen
iors last year.

Whereas last year the Stanford men finished
in llth-place with 21 points, this year the Cardi
nal finished in 30th-place with seven points. This
season it proved impossible to replace the relia
bility and endurance of graduated seniors like
Chris Derrick, Brendan Gregg and Jake Riley, all
runners that helped Stanford dominate the 5,000-
meter run at the NCAA Championships in years
past.

The drop-off for the women's team was even
more pronounced: it failed to score any points at
all, landing in 53rd place after finishing in 13th
place a year ago. One contributing factor to the
drop in ranking was the early season injury of
senior Kathy Kroeger.

Kroeger, who finished sixth in the 3,000 me
ters and 10th in the 5,000 meters in last year's
NCAA Championship, returned to the track just
in time to prepare for her leg in the women's dis
tance medley relay this past weekend.
The weekend did yield one shining moment
among many tough races: senior Tyler Stutz
man's performance in the mile. On Friday night
in the mile preliminaries, Stutzman and junior
teammate Michael Atchoo finished 7th and Bth to
just make the finals cut-off. But in the Saturday
night final, the llth-seeded Stutzman came back

with a vengeance and a fantastic time of 3:59.70.
He placed fourth, behind runners from Arizona,
North Carolina and Wisconsin. Atchoo, his fifth
seeded teammate, landed a solid eighth-place fin
ish at 4:04.92.

Atchoo and Stutzman ran in the men's dis
tance medley relay (DMR) no less than three
hours after their mile final, along with senior
Spencer Chase and sophomore Luke Lefebure.
Lefebure and Atchoo both ran in Stanford's
fourth-place DMR team in the 2012 NCAA
Championships, but they failed to convert their
experiences into a strong DMR this time around.
This men wound up finishing eighth with a time
of 9:39.22,11 seconds slower than their seed time
and three seconds slower than their time in 2012.

In the field events, Stanford did not score.
Senior high-jumper Jules Sharpe placed 13th
with a jump of 7 feet, 2.5 inches an inch below
his personal best. Shot-putter Alyssa Wisdom,
who recently earned her first All-American hon
ors, was initially seeded 10th, but could not
record a legal score, finishing with three fouls.
Feshman Amy Weissenbach was one of very
few underclassmen to qualify for the champi
onships. In the 800-meter preliminaries on Fri
day night, Weissenbach barely missed the cut-off

for the finals when she clocked in at ninth with a
time of 2:05.56.

The top three in each heat plus the next two
fastest overall qualify. Weissenbach finished
fourth in her heat and was the third fastest
among the non-automatic qualifiers, just missing
on both counts. But her consistent performances
this winter are a good sign for both the upcoming
outdoor season and her future career as a Cardi
nal runner.

Juniors Jessica Tonn and Kori Carter, in their
first career appearances at the NCAA champi
onships, finished 15th and 14th in their respective
events. Carter, who holds the Stanford record in
the 60-meter hurdles and recently claimed first
place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
200-meter championships, finished with a 60-me
ter hurdle time of 8.29 seconds. Tonn completed
the 5,000 meters in 16:10.42.

The women's DMR improved slightly on it ini
tial seed, as it edged past University of Connecti
cut in 11:14.77 to finish 11th, one place ahead of
its No. 12 seed.

Stanford returns to action for the outdoor sea
son with the Cal Multis in Berkeley on March 27.

senior Kathy Kroeger.

Kroeger, who finished sixth in the 3,000 me
ters and 10th in the 5,000 meters in last year's
NCAA Championship, returned to the track just
in time to prepare for her leg in the women's dis
tance medley relay this past weekend.
The weekend did yield one shining moment
among many tough races: senior Tyler Stutz
man's performance in the mile. On Friday night
in the mile preliminaries, Stutzman and junior
teammate Michael Atchoo finished 7th and Bth to
just make the finals cut-off. But in the Saturday
night final, the llth-seeded Stutzman came back

with a vengeance and a fantastic time of 3:59.70.
He placed fourth, behind runners from Arizona,
North Carolina and Wisconsin. Atchoo, his fifth
seeded teammate, landed a solid eighth-place fin
ish at 4:04.92.

Atchoo and Stutzman ran in the men's dis
tance medley relay (DMR) no less than three
hours after their mile final, along with senior
Spencer Chase and sophomore Luke Lefebure.
Lefebure and Atchoo both ran in Stanford's
fourth-place DMR team in the 2012 NCAA
Championships, but they failed to convert their
experiences into a strong DMR this time around.
This men wound up finishing eighth with a time
of 9:39.22,11 seconds slower than their seed time
and three seconds slower than their time in 2012.

In the field events, Stanford did not score.
Senior high-jumper Jules Sharpe placed 13th
with a jump of 7 feet, 2.5 inches an inch below
his personal best. Shot-putter Alyssa Wisdom,
who recently earned her first All-American hon
ors, was initially seeded 10th, but could not
record a legal score, finishing with three fouls.
Feshman Amy Weissenbach was one of very
few underclassmen to qualify for the champi
onships. In the 800-meter preliminaries on Fri
day night, Weissenbach barely missed the cut-off

for the finals when she clocked in at ninth with a
time of 2:05.56.

The top three in each heat plus the next two
fastest overall qualify. Weissenbach finished
fourth in her heat and was the third fastest
among the non-automatic qualifiers, just missing
on both counts. But her consistent performances
this winter are a good sign for both the upcoming
outdoor season and her future career as a Cardi
nal runner.

Juniors Jessica Tonn and Kori Carter, in their
first career appearances at the NCAA champi
onships, finished 15th and 14th in their respective
events. Carter, who holds the Stanford record in
the 60-meter hurdles and recently claimed first
place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
200-meter championships, finished with a 60-me
ter hurdle time of 8.29 seconds. Tonn completed
the 5,000 meters in 16:10.42.

The women's DMR improved slightly on it ini
tial seed, as it edged past University of Connecti
cut in 11:14.77 to finish 11th, one place ahead of
its No. 12 seed.

Stanford returns to action for the outdoor sea
son with the Cal Multis in Berkeley on March 27.
