# RODGERS ROCKS VEGAS
## 
### CAMERON MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sophomore Patrick Rodgers
notched his thud victory of the sea
son in dramatic fashion, leading the
No. 13 Stanford men's golf team to a
fifth-place showing at the Southern
Highlands Collegiate Masters in Las
Vegas, Nevada.
Rodgers, last year's Phc-12 Fesh
man of the Tear, started the tournament
with seven birdies to post a strong 6-un
der 66 first round on Friday.

"The wind laid down a bit and the
greens were receptive so the course
offered a few early birdies," Rodgers
told GoStanford.com after the open
ing round. "I hit a lot of quality shots,
controlled the ball well and converted
the putts to get it going early,"
However, he was unable to main
tain his momentum over the week
end, shooting l-over on both Satur
day and Sunday.

"The wind on the front nine made
a few of the holes accessible,"
Rodgers said of Sunday's play. "I
tried to fight hard on the back but it
was playing tough. I just made a few
bogeys with quality shots that ended
up in the wrong spots."
Rodgers was still in contention
deep into the final round, where he
needed and made a birdie on the par
518th hole to move into a four-way tie
for the lead at 4-under with Cal's
Michael Kim, New Mexico's James
Erkenbeck and Alabama's Cory
Whitsett.

"I was proud of Patrick Rodgers'
finish," said Stanford head coach
Conrad Ray. "He really hung in there
with the final round after making a
double bogey on the first hole."
The four-man playoff started on
the 18th hole, where Rodgers had

recorded two pars and a birdie for the
tournament. In the fairway after his
first shot, the second-year player
from Avon, Ind. put his second shot to
within ten yards of the green. The
third stroke left Rodgers with a 12-
foot uphill birdie attempt.

After Whitsett missed his 15-foot
birdie try, Rodgers coolly sank his
putt to eliminate Whitsett and turn
up the pressure on Erkenbeck and
Kim. Both proceeded to miss their
birdie attempts, leaving Rodgers
alone atop the leaderboard, although
all four golfers will be credited with a
victory.
"My record is good in playoffs and
for whatever reason I feel very com
fortable in those situations," Rodgers
said. "I had just played 18 really well
and I felt I could do it again."

Cameron Wilson also continued
his solid play by delivering a very

consistent performance at Southern
Highlands-the junior shot 71, 71 and
73 in three rounds.

Going into the final round, Wilson
told GoStanford.com that said his
plan "was to be very patient and ac
cepting of all the breaks, good or
bad,"

Wilson did just that, overcoming a
double bogey on the par-4 first hole
by birdieing four out of his last five
holes to move into fifth place at 1-un
der-par. It was the junior's second
top-10 individual finish in as many
tournaments. Stanford was the only
team to have two golfers card top-five
performances.
Despite Rodgers' individual victo
ry and Wilson's strong finish, the
Cardinal faltered as a team on Sun
day, shooting a combined 12-over-par.
Sitting at even-par after two rounds,
the team fell from second to fifth in

the team standings on the final day of
the tournament.
Senior Andrew Yun had an inaus
picious start to the final round, triple
bogeying the par-4 first hole, while
freshman David Boote and senior
Steven Kearney combined for 14 bo
geys on the day. The top-ranked Cal
Golden Bears won the team title with
an 856, seven strokes clear of second
place Alabama and 20 ahead of Stan
ford.

Although a final-round tumble
down the leaderboard might leave a
sour taste in their mouths, Ray was
pleased that the Cardinal defeated
six teams ranked ahead of them.
Among the teams that Stanford beat
was No. 7 USC, which along with No.
2 UCLA and No. 1 Cal, will meet the
Card again at the Pac-12 Champi
onship Tournament from April 29-
May 1 in Los Angeles.
"The conditions were veiy diffi
cult and the competition stiff, so it's
great experience hopefully for what
lies ahead and will give us a good
measuring stick for what we need to
work on," Ray said. "I'm confident
that the other guys will contribute as
we move forward at Stanford in a
couple weeks."

Stanford next hits the course on
March 28 in the U.S. Intercollegiate
at the Stanford Golf Course, the Car
dinal's only home tournament of the
season.

"Hopefully we can ride some of
the momentum of our first two days
of competition and do some good per
formance at Stanford when we play
at our course and defend our home
turf here at the Stanford Intercolle
giate in a couple weeks," Ray said.

"Hopefully we can ride some of

of competition and do some good per

at our course and defend our home
turf here at the Stanford Intercolle

season at the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters in Las Vegas, but
his team could not hold on to its second-place position and fell to fifth.
Sophomore Patrick Rodgers
notched his thud victory of the sea
son in dramatic fashion, leading the
No. 13 Stanford men's golf team to a
fifth-place showing at the Southern
Highlands Collegiate Masters in Las
Vegas, Nevada.
Rodgers, last year's Phc-12 Fesh
man of the Tear, started the tournament
with seven birdies to post a strong 6-un
der 66 first round on Friday.

"The wind laid down a bit and the
greens were receptive so the course
offered a few early birdies," Rodgers
told GoStanford.com after the open
ing round. "I hit a lot of quality shots,
controlled the ball well and converted
the putts to get it going early,"
However, he was unable to main
tain his momentum over the week
end, shooting l-over on both Satur
day and Sunday.

"The wind on the front nine made
a few of the holes accessible,"
Rodgers said of Sunday's play. "I
tried to fight hard on the back but it
was playing tough. I just made a few
bogeys with quality shots that ended
up in the wrong spots."
Rodgers was still in contention
deep into the final round, where he
needed and made a birdie on the par
518th hole to move into a four-way tie
for the lead at 4-under with Cal's
Michael Kim, New Mexico's James
Erkenbeck and Alabama's Cory
Whitsett.

"I was proud of Patrick Rodgers'
finish," said Stanford head coach
Conrad Ray. "He really hung in there
with the final round after making a
double bogey on the first hole."
The four-man playoff started on
the 18th hole, where Rodgers had

recorded two pars and a birdie for the
tournament. In the fairway after his
first shot, the second-year player
from Avon, Ind. put his second shot to
within ten yards of the green. The
third stroke left Rodgers with a 12-
foot uphill birdie attempt.

After Whitsett missed his 15-foot
birdie try, Rodgers coolly sank his
putt to eliminate Whitsett and turn
up the pressure on Erkenbeck and
Kim. Both proceeded to miss their
birdie attempts, leaving Rodgers
alone atop the leaderboard, although
all four golfers will be credited with a
victory.
"My record is good in playoffs and
for whatever reason I feel very com
fortable in those situations," Rodgers
said. "I had just played 18 really well
and I felt I could do it again."

Cameron Wilson also continued
his solid play by delivering a very

consistent performance at Southern
Highlands-the junior shot 71, 71 and
73 in three rounds.

Going into the final round, Wilson
told GoStanford.com that said his
plan "was to be very patient and ac
cepting of all the breaks, good or
bad,"

Wilson did just that, overcoming a
double bogey on the par-4 first hole
by birdieing four out of his last five
holes to move into fifth place at 1-un
der-par. It was the junior's second
top-10 individual finish in as many
tournaments. Stanford was the only
team to have two golfers card top-five
performances.
Despite Rodgers' individual victo
ry and Wilson's strong finish, the
Cardinal faltered as a team on Sun
day, shooting a combined 12-over-par.
Sitting at even-par after two rounds,
the team fell from second to fifth in

the team standings on the final day of
the tournament.
Senior Andrew Yun had an inaus
picious start to the final round, triple
bogeying the par-4 first hole, while
freshman David Boote and senior
Steven Kearney combined for 14 bo
geys on the day. The top-ranked Cal
Golden Bears won the team title with
an 856, seven strokes clear of second
place Alabama and 20 ahead of Stan
ford.

Although a final-round tumble
down the leaderboard might leave a
sour taste in their mouths, Ray was
pleased that the Cardinal defeated
six teams ranked ahead of them.
Among the teams that Stanford beat
was No. 7 USC, which along with No.
2 UCLA and No. 1 Cal, will meet the
Card again at the Pac-12 Champi
onship Tournament from April 29-
May 1 in Los Angeles.
"The conditions were veiy diffi
cult and the competition stiff, so it's
great experience hopefully for what
lies ahead and will give us a good
measuring stick for what we need to
work on," Ray said. "I'm confident
that the other guys will contribute as
we move forward at Stanford in a
couple weeks."

Stanford next hits the course on
March 28 in the U.S. Intercollegiate
at the Stanford Golf Course, the Car
dinal's only home tournament of the
season.

"Hopefully we can ride some of
the momentum of our first two days
of competition and do some good per
formance at Stanford when we play
at our course and defend our home
turf here at the Stanford Intercolle
giate in a couple weeks," Ray said.
