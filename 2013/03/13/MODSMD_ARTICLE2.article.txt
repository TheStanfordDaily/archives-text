## Stanford tenant sues Santa Clara Citizen group urges Board of Trustees to intervene in lawsuit 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A citizen coalition called Fair Share
at Stanford is pressuring the Board of
Trustees and University officials to in
tervene in a tax dispute involving one of
Stanford's tenants, alleging that the
tenant has unjustly withheld millions of
dollars in taxes from Santa Clara Coun
ty. The University has declined to in
volve itself in the case.
The tenant, a retirement community
in Palo Alto called Vi, signed a 75-year
land lease with Stanford in 2000 and
opened in 2005. Vi operates 10 retire
ment communities across the country
and was founded by Penny Pritzker JD
'B5 MBA 'B5.
Mike French, a research analyst at
the Unite Here labor union and one of
the leaders of the coalition, said that
135 citizens have signed a petition urg
ing the University to ask Vi to drop a
lawsuit against Santa Clara County. Vi
sued the county because of dissatisfac
tion with county assessments that value
the Vi facility at more than double Vi's
own appraisals, causing a significant in
crease in property taxes.
An unusual case
Vi has filed appeals for property tax-
es paid from 2005 to 2012, alleging
that the property is worth signifi
cantly less than the county's assess
ment. In 2011, Vi's appeals for its
first three years of operation ap
peared before the county's Assess
ment Appeals Board. Appeals for
Vi's 2008-12 property taxes are still
pending.
While the county assessed the
property's value at $370 million for
2005-07, Vi argued that during
these three years, the property was
worth $2OO million. After a three
day hearing, the Appeals Board
concluded that the property should
have been valued at $4BO million
during this time and issued $l2 mil
lion in value-increase bills to Vi.
These bills are due on April 10.
In response to this ruling, Vi
filed a lawsuit against the county in
the Superior Court of California in
September 2012. The case is cur
rently in pre-trial stages.
According to Robert Nakamae,
Santa Clara County's deputy coun
sel and the county's representative
in the lawsuit, it is "unusual" that
the case has progressed to court.
"The county gets thousands and
thousands of these applications for
changed assessment, and very,
very few of them end up in court,"
he said. "We do get cases where
taxpayers are unhappy, but some
times they figure [a lawsuit] is not
worth going through."

Nakamae said that Vi sued be
cause "they were not happy with
the decision" made by the Appeals
Board, but declined to comment on
the merit of the case.

Based on the typical timeframe
of proceedings for similar cases,
Vi's case may not appear in court
for 12 to 18 months, according to
Nakamae. If Vi prevails, the case
will likely return to the Assessment
Appeals Board, and the county will
not immediately issue Vi a refund.

Petitioners' interaction with
Stanford

French, who represents work
ers in the hospitality industry, said
that Unite Here did not "go looking
for this tax issue," instead discover
ing the dispute while conducting
other research. The union decided
to mobilize after determining that
the case had a direct effect on its
workers.

"For every motion Vi makes,
every time they write another
brief, the county has to respond,"
French said. "That is more money
and more resources going to the
appeals, money that could really,
really help the public schools."
French said that, although Stan

ford is seen as the "crown jewel of
Santa Clara County" the Universi
ty's inaction has led many citizens
to question why the University is
not "holding their business part
ners to a higher standard."
"It's on Stanford's campus.
Stanford's name is on the tax bill,"
French said. "They've got this busi
ness partner that isn't paying their
fair share, and they've kind of
thrown up their hands."
According to French, Stanford
has received a total of $57 million in
rent from Vi as of 2011, making
Stanford's decision not to intervene
more distressing.
Susan Muysenberg, a Camp
bell, Calif., resident who signed the
petition, also expressed disappoint
ment that Stanford has not inter
vened in the case.
"Stanford is considered to be
quite up there, academically, and
it's also considered a very wealthy
campus," Muysenberg said. "To try
to get out of supporting the com
munity is a scandal. It's a contro
versial issue, so they are trying to
hide and say, 'lt doesn't concern
us.'"

The citizens' petition was deliv
ered to several members of the

Board of Trustees, as well as to Di
rector of Government and Commu
nity Relations Larry Horton '62
M.A. '66, in February. French sub
sequently received a written re
sponse from Vice President for
Public Affairs David Demarest that
stated that, for property tax pur
poses, Yi is considered to be the
owner of the property.
"It is our understanding that
this property tax dispute is being
addressed through the appropriate
administrative and legal process
es," Demarest wrote. "Stanford has
no standing to be involved and no
right to interfere in the dispute be
tween Yi and the County."

Demarest declined an interview
with The Daily, reiterating that
Stanford was "not a party" to the
issue.

John Freesemann, a pastor in
San Jose who signed the cover let
ters to Horton and the Trustees,
said that he was disappointed by
Demarest's response, having hoped
that the University would investi
gate the issue.
"I think any corporation and
Stanford is a corporation that
hides from carrying out civic re
sponsibility is perceived badly," he

said. "When [Stanford] has a for
profit corporation that is paying
them rental money, they need to be
sure that they say to that corpora
tion, 'You need to be a good citizen.'"
Freesemann also expressed con
cern over Pritzker's links to both
Stanford and Vi. Pritzker, a member
of the University's Board of
Trustees, sits on the board of the
Hyatt Corporation and signed the
land lease on behalf of Vi in 2000.

"Any time that a board member
who is a part of another entity has a
potential to rule on the validity or le
gality of that other entity, I think
they should recuse themselves at
the very least," he said.

Legality of Vi's appeal
Hank Greely '74, professor of
law, argued against Stanford inter
vening in the case, emphasizing
Vi's right to independently contest
the decision of the county's Assess
ment Appeals Board.
"If you've got a right to judicial
appeal, you've got a right to judi
cial appeal," Greely said. "A jury
may have already decided that a
defendant was guilty of a crime,
but that doesn't mean he shouldn't
have a right to appeal that ver

diet."
Greely said that "barring ex
traordinary circumstances," a par
ty to a legal contract should not
forfeit its right to an appeal.
"Yes, the appeal is going to cost
the county time and money, but it
is also going to cost Vi time and
money, and citizens have a right to
have government actions re
viewed," he said. "The idea that
Stanford should put pressure on a
tenant to forgo that right seems to
me kind of far-fetched."

Nakamae agreed that Vi has
the right to sue the county, despite
citizens' concern that the lawsuit is
a waste of the county's time and
money.

"They can pay that money and
file that lawsuit. I don't think it's
fair for me to say that they are
wasting my time doing it," he said.
"Do I want them to do it? No, but
they have a right to do it."
Representatives from Vi in Palo
Alto, Vi's corporate offices and
Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman,
the law firm representing Vi, all de
clined to comment.
