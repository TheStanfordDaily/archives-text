## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Suites Dining Week 3: The Row 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Suites residents and managers
are now in their second week
of negotiations with ResEd,
and while nothing is final yet and
there are many details left to be
worked out, signs are positive that
an agreeable solution can be
reached that can both address the
concerns of the University and pro
tect Suites chefs and traditions.

As of this writing, there are no
longer any outside contractors, in
cluding SOS, being considered to
run Suites Dining; Suites staff are
drafting a revised business model
to present to the University that
preserves the current chefs and
student managerial independence
while also establishing a Board of
Directors to address University
concerns about accountability and
continuity; ResEd administrators
Aaron Buzay and Nate Boswell
have been very helpful in working
with students; and negotiations are
on a clear timetable for solution by
the time the Draw rolls around.
More updates to follow in the com
ing weeks.
As negotiations continue, how
ever, it's crucial to remember that
this isn't just about Suites. The
Suites Dining case is merely one
symptom of a much broader set of
problems that has ramifications for
this entire campus.
First and most narrowly, resi
dents on the Row are not receiving
a quality and volume of dining serv
ices commensurate with the board
bill they pay. For the same board
bill cost Suites residents pay for 17
meals per week as I and others
have noted multiple times stu
dents on the Row get 10.
That is, first of all, a very basic
equity issue. Absent a compelling
reason why students on the Row
should receive fewer meals for the
same price, this is simply unfair.
This inefficiency is no fault of
the chefs and kitchen staff on the
Row, who (from personal conversa
tions with both chefs and students)
enjoy close relationships with Row
residents and do the best they can

with the resources (and most likely
lower wages) they've been given. It
is the fault of the larger financial
model the University has put into
place on the Row a for-profit
model, run by SOS, that appears
unable to deliver the same volume
of food service provided by a non
profit, student-run Suites organiza
tion without high overhead or a
profit margin to sustain.

It is the Suites financial model
a nonprofit model that allows each
House (in consultation with ResEd
and R&DE) direct ownership over
its students' money that should
be exported to the Row, not the oth
er way around. Experience and data
show that with competent manage
ment in place, a nonprofit model can
deliver more food for the same
price, as well as pay professional
kitchen staff higher wages.
And from a purely moral, rather
than economic, perspective, it
seems wrong to force student mon
ey— much of which comes from
University financial aid and par
ents' contributions to go toward
paying a for-profit third-party com
pany. Students should, of course, be
free to spend their discretionary
funds at dining companies like Sub
way and Panda Express. But re
quiring them to pay into an ineffi
cient dining model, with no ability
to opt out, is both an ineffective and
immoral decision.
As Suites continues to move for
ward in negotiations, let's remem
ber that the Row and other ar
eas of campus I'll talk about in the
coming weeks are facing similar
challenges and difficulties. We're all
in this together.
