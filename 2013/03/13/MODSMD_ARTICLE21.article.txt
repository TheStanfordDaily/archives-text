# OP-ED
## Resisting Amnesia: Understanding the Suites takeover in light of XOX, Part II 
### ELIF TASAR '12 
This op-ed is the second, in a two
part series comparing the proposed
Suites takeover with the Universi
ty's decision to terminate the lease
of Chi Theta Chi (XOX) last year.

Lack of transparency
Like Suites, we at XOX found
ourselves pleading with the
administration to tell us what
we had actually done wrong. We re
solved the five simple issues listed in
the administration's Feb. 8 notice
all of which were either flat-out inac
curate or easily rectifiable within
the week in a 200-page memoran
dum demonstrating the alumni's
managerial competence and financial
solvency.
Though we were dismayed that
the administration had not ex
pressed its concerns earlier, we
had no option but to assume that it
was equally committed to achiev
ing a mutually agreeable solution
and that we could do so by uncov
ering and allaying its concerns.
We, too, care about our own safety
and that of our community. Our
goals student safety, health and
happiness should have been
aligned.
But in spite of our good faith,
the negotiations that followed were
characterized by the premise that
the University would revoke our in
dependence for some indeterminate
period in which we would have to do
whatever we were told like good lit
tle boys and girls.
During the first meeting in which
XOX alumni met to discuss retention
of the lease, they were told that if ne
gotiations were to continue, they
would have to remain confidential to
the people in the room, which includ
ed just two alumni, administration
members, a couple lawyers and no
students. As if it weren't bad enough
that our alumni couldn't speak trans
parently with the community, resi
dents received no formal communi
cation from mid-February until mid-
May, nearly the end of the school
year, when Greg Boardman emailed
a response to the students' mani
festo.

Disingenuous use of "health
and safety" as a justification for
the takeover

In both takeovers, the adminis
tration repeatedly noted a poor
health and safety record as a major
basis for its decision. Yet both Suites'
and XOX's performance proved su
perior to the majority of that of Uni
versity-operated establishments. Vi
olations occur in every house on cam
pus; them citation and subsequent
correction is a routine part of operat
ing a residence and kitchen. Self-cor
rected mistakes serve as a model for
better performance in the future.

I do not doubt that the adminis
tration is concerned about the health
and safety of its students. Stanford is
a huge enterprise for which student
health and safety represents an
enormous liability. Of course admin
istrators care. Through many meet
ings with Student Housing officials
during the XOX negotiations, I
learned that Stanford's building
codes and policies eclipse those re
quired by the County, in detail and
scope. All students pose an equal lia
bility, so all buildings are run uni
formly to mitigate that liability. And
when running dozens of properties
with a full 9-to-5 staff, you need strin
gent protocols to keep the machine
well-greased.
But this model is not the only one
capable of ensuring good manage
ment, and it directly precludes the
persistence of alternate approaches,
like GCDS and XOX, that invite stu
dents to exercise ownership over
their living and dining environments
effectively and to learn invaluable
lessons in leadership and coopera
tion while doing so.
The problem for the administra
tion is that students who are used to
independence know what it really
means to run a healthy and safe es
tablishment and can see the adminis
tration's perversion of it for the sham
that it is. Although the administra
tion justified its takeover on account
of "pressing life safety issues," stu
dents in XOX have furiously dealt
with the repercussions of Student
