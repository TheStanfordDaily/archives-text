# OP-ED
## Resisting Amnesia: Understanding the Suites takeover in light of XOX, Part II 
### ELIF TASAR '12 
This op-ed is the second, in a two
part series comparing the proposed
Suites takeover with the Universi
ty's decision to terminate the lease
of Chi Theta Chi (XOX) last year.

Lack of transparency
Like Suites, we at XOX found
ourselves pleading with the
administration to tell us what
we had actually done wrong. We re
solved the five simple issues listed in
the administration's Feb. 8 notice
all of which were either flat-out inac
curate or easily rectifiable within
the week in a 200-page memoran
dum demonstrating the alumni's
managerial competence and financial
solvency.
Though we were dismayed that
the administration had not ex
pressed its concerns earlier, we
had no option but to assume that it
was equally committed to achiev
ing a mutually agreeable solution
and that we could do so by uncov
ering and allaying its concerns.
We, too, care about our own safety
and that of our community. Our
goals student safety, health and
happiness should have been
aligned.
But in spite of our good faith,
the negotiations that followed were
characterized by the premise that
the University would revoke our in
dependence for some indeterminate
period in which we would have to do
whatever we were told like good lit
tle boys and girls.
During the first meeting in which
XOX alumni met to discuss retention
of the lease, they were told that if ne
gotiations were to continue, they
would have to remain confidential to
the people in the room, which includ
ed just two alumni, administration
members, a couple lawyers and no
students. As if it weren't bad enough
that our alumni couldn't speak trans
parently with the community, resi
dents received no formal communi
cation from mid-February until mid-
May, nearly the end of the school
year, when Greg Boardman emailed
a response to the students' mani
festo.

Disingenuous use of "health
and safety" as a justification for
the takeover

In both takeovers, the adminis
tration repeatedly noted a poor
health and safety record as a major
basis for its decision. Yet both Suites'
and XOX's performance proved su
perior to the majority of that of Uni
versity-operated establishments. Vi
olations occur in every house on cam
pus; them citation and subsequent
correction is a routine part of operat
ing a residence and kitchen. Self-cor
rected mistakes serve as a model for
better performance in the future.

I do not doubt that the adminis
tration is concerned about the health
and safety of its students. Stanford is
a huge enterprise for which student
health and safety represents an
enormous liability. Of course admin
istrators care. Through many meet
ings with Student Housing officials
during the XOX negotiations, I
learned that Stanford's building
codes and policies eclipse those re
quired by the County, in detail and
scope. All students pose an equal lia
bility, so all buildings are run uni
formly to mitigate that liability. And
when running dozens of properties
with a full 9-to-5 staff, you need strin
gent protocols to keep the machine
well-greased.
But this model is not the only one
capable of ensuring good manage
ment, and it directly precludes the
persistence of alternate approaches,
like GCDS and XOX, that invite stu
dents to exercise ownership over
their living and dining environments
effectively and to learn invaluable
lessons in leadership and coopera
tion while doing so.
The problem for the administra
tion is that students who are used to
independence know what it really
means to run a healthy and safe es
tablishment and can see the adminis
tration's perversion of it for the sham
that it is. Although the administra
tion justified its takeover on account
of "pressing life safety issues," stu
dents in XOX have furiously dealt
with the repercussions of Student
Housing's errors as they pen
etrate our house with "im
provements." The long list in
cludes multiple installations
that violate fire code, acciden
tal defacing of murals, sexual
harassment of a resident by an
unsupervised worker and
doors rekeyed without student
feedback so that meat suppli
ers cannot drop off meat in the
fridge and residents need a
key to complete helpful tasks
like restocking toilet paper.
One could argue that Stan
ford is the landlord and gets to
define health and safety how
ever it wants to mitigate its
risk and liability. That may be
true, but is it worth the termi
nation of 30 years of student
management by GCDS and
the forcible seizure of a $3.6
million XOX alumni property
that was ran independently
since its creation 120 years
ago?

Stanford has a stated ob
jective and obligation to its stu
dents to encourage learning
through residential life, and its
tenants cannot easily move off
campus to pursue that learn
ing. Is the specter of risk worth
the closure of the rare remain
ing havens where true residen

tial education continues to
thrive? Protection of the insti
tution should not negate the
opportunities of the students it
seives.
Let Stanford Breathe!
Suites advocates cannot
forget that the same tactics
were used to end XOX just one
year ago, that it was only a few
years ago that ResEd system
atically collapsed the co-ops'
management structure and
that the Toyon Eating Clubs
and the other co-ops remained
independently run just years
ago. We cannot forget that, as
we fight, Stanford staff mem
bers are fighting for a living
wage and renewed health care
and that these are not isolated
struggles.
Office of the VPSA,
R&DE, Provost Etchemendy,
President Hennessy, Board of
Trustees: your students are
smart. They can recognize
when they and those with
whom they stand in solidarity
are being used.
What happened to Corey
Booker's 2012 commence
ment speech reminder that
we are "the physical manifes
tation of a conspiracy of love,"
that our achievements are in
debted to those who paved
the way for them? How can
the University that seeks to
graduate these future con

spirators harbor an adminis
tration that systematically
stifles the living conditions
that promote intellectualism,
creativity and leadership?
I urge the administration
to hold itself accountable to
its students, to also resist the
amnesia that can allow unac
countable power to corrupt.
As a stalling point, it should
learn from the past year's
student uproar and, hence
forth, publicly announce any
changes to residential life
policies and seek student in
put before implementing
them. I refuse to believe that
the institutional policies in
place to protect against liabil
ity and risk cannot be recon
ciled with support for the con
ditions that permit learning:
collaboration, experimenta
tion and imperfection.
I implore you, Greg
Boardman, Shirley Everett
and other University officials:
don't alienate your creative,
community-spirited minds
through death by a thousand
cuts to the places that culti
vate them.

petition: "LET STANFORD
BREATHE!"
