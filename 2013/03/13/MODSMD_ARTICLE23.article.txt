# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## Depression: It's for everyone 
### Chris Herries 
I recently saw a commercial for
Cymbalta, an antidepressant,
which had some spot-on asser
tions about what depression feels
like. Depression is painful, it's anhe
donic, it's thing and so on. All of
these fairly characterize what de
pression is.

There was at least one aspect of
the commercial, however, that did a
great injustice. Every person por
trayed as depressed was a young
woman. There was not a single men
tally ill man in the commercial.
Unfortunately, there exists a per
vasive conception that depression is
for women. I won't get into a whole
debate about whether all gender
stereotypes are harmful, but it's
clear that certain ones are. The stig
ma surrounding male mental health
issues does nobody any good, and
more resources and attention need
to be brought to finding and helping
clinically depressed men.
In terms of resource allocation,
critics will immediately point out
that women have higher incidences

of major depression, and this is true.
However, there is surely underre
porting among men because of the
stigma associated with mental illness
in male culture. Moreover, men are
more likely to successfully commit
suicide, which could indicate a lack of
treatment. Contrary to popular be
lief, suicidal people will not always
"find away." People who attempt sui
cide and fail rarely repeat the at
tempt. Identification, prevention and
treatment can literally save a young
man's life.

Whatever the numbers, the stig
ma surrounding mental illness in
male culture is real and troubling. In
this column, the first of two, I'd like
to address some reasons why de
pression in men may go unnoticed.
In my next column, I'll explore easy
ways to address these issues.
It's easy to dismiss the underre
porting of depression in men as a cul
tural stress on masculinity and sto
icism. I certainly think this is a fac
tor. However, I think the biggest is
sue is that men may manifest the

"symptoms" of depression different
ly from women, making depression
harder to identify in men. I'll provide
a few examples of seemingly com
mon male behaviors that could be
signs of depression.
First off, we all have a conception
of self-harm as something like cut
ting. Cutting is clear, visible and ob
viously abnormal. This makes de
pressed people who cut easier to
identify, thereby making interven
tion easier.

However, there are many types
of self-harm, and men often induce
self-harm through less obvious
means like substance abuse, danger
ous physical acts and risky sex.
These things are often chalked up to
boys being boys, i.e., these unhealthy
behaviors are just what young men
do. But say we had a young
man who comes to college, ignores
his classes and drinks himself into a
stupor every night. Is he irresponsi
ble or is he depressed? It's a surpris-
ingly common phenomenon
that's almost invariably
chalked up to an irresponsible
young man being unable to
handle the independence of
college. But maybe moving to
college has been a triggering
factor, leading him to be de
pressed. It's hard to tell, but
ignoring these behavioral
changes could be ignoring a
serious underlying issue.
Likewise, risky behaviors
can manifest in something
seemingly benign, like speed
ing in a car. Teenagers are
supposed to be irresponsible

drivers, right? I had a friend,
however, who would speed
constantly because he didn't
care if he crashed and died.
Similarly, it's not uncommon
for a car crash to be a suicide
attempt. Ultimately, risky be
havior in men could be a man
ifestation of self-loathing and
hopelessness associated with
major depression or the ma
nia associated with bipolar

depression.
Another example may be
the idea that men have fewer
"body issues" than women
i.e., they're supposedly more
comfortable with their ap
pearance. But a man's insecu
rity with his body is quite
common. He may become ob
sessed with exercise, diet and
muscle growth.

I've provided these exam
ples to show that the common
conceptions of depression
symptoms can blind us to
people in need. Now, I'm not
saying that someone who
drinks, speeds or over-exer
cises is clinically depressed.
But I am saying that de
pression isn't just young
women cutting, sleeping ex
cessively or losing interest in
life. We should all be cog
nizant of the people around us
and realize that we can't truly
know what they're going
through until we ask.

Look for Chris' second col
umn on depression after
spring break. Until then, con
tact him at herriesc@Stan

that's almost invariably
chalked up to an irresponsible
young man being unable to
handle the independence of
college. But maybe moving to
college has been a triggering
factor, leading him to be de
pressed. It's hard to tell, but
ignoring these behavioral
changes could be ignoring a
serious underlying issue.
Likewise, risky behaviors
can manifest in something
seemingly benign, like speed
ing in a car. Teenagers are
supposed to be irresponsible

drivers, right? I had a friend,
however, who would speed
constantly because he didn't
care if he crashed and died.
Similarly, it's not uncommon
for a car crash to be a suicide
attempt. Ultimately, risky be
havior in men could be a man
ifestation of self-loathing and
hopelessness associated with
major depression or the ma
nia associated with bipolar

depression.
Another example may be
the idea that men have fewer
"body issues" than women
i.e., they're supposedly more
comfortable with their ap
pearance. But a man's insecu
rity with his body is quite
common. He may become ob
sessed with exercise, diet and
muscle growth.

I've provided these exam
ples to show that the common
conceptions of depression
symptoms can blind us to
people in need. Now, I'm not
saying that someone who
drinks, speeds or over-exer
cises is clinically depressed.
But I am saying that de
pression isn't just young
women cutting, sleeping ex
cessively or losing interest in
life. We should all be cog
nizant of the people around us
and realize that we can't truly
know what they're going
through until we ask.

Look for Chris' second col
umn on depression after
spring break. Until then, con
