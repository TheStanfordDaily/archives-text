# The
						First (and Last) Annual Brady's Senior Spring Bucket List
## 
### Taylor Brady 
I've promised my readers some
critical journalism, and I swear
that it's coming, but research
for these things exhausts a surpris
ing amount of time. So while we
wait for the magma to erupt, I fig
ure it's about time that I introduce
some levity into everybody's life. I
hate being a downer right during fi
nals, so consider this your shot of
adder- I mean, ampheta- I mean,
caffeine ... unless you have a pre
scription for those other substances
that absolutely nobody illegally
abuses here.

Just last week, the 2013 class
presidents released a "Senior
Spring Bucket List." It included
old fan favorites like "12. Make a
new best friend in your last quar
ter" (far enough into their post-
Pizzeria wine-binge they'll pour
their heart out to you, just be care
ful about other things leaving their
mouth); "27. Play sports with an
Olympic athlete" (get
humiliated/pull a hamstring); and
"68. Sign up for alumni mailing lists
please keep in touch" (cut out
the middleman and send them your
account number and PIN).
Since the list is so laughably
vanilla, I thought that I'd go

through as much of it as I can in
print, modify the sanctioned activi
ties and thereby introduce the:

First (and Last) Annual Brady's
Senior Spring Bucket List!

"1. Plan your last quarter of
classes" Wine tasting, super
beer tasting (at Haus Mitt, look it
up), recreational narcotics con
sumption, CEE 289; Random Vi
brations, IHUM.
"6. Sleep somewhere outdoors
on campus" Never been sexiled
THAT hard. On the bright side, you
have raccoons to cuddle with.
"7. Watch the sunrise from the

Dish" with your new raccoon
lover.
"8. Stargaze from the middle of
Lake Lag" So it IS possible to
get malaria in the United States.
"9. Go on a road trip" Drop
out of school to do so and take the
10,000:1 chance that you'll become
Ken Kesey.
"10. Skinny dip in a fountain"

Two words: yeast infection.
"14. Cement that one faculty
you'll keep in touch with" Put a
ring on it.

"18. Attend an obscure musical
performance" Hippie drum cir
cle at Synergy doesn't count.
"19. Watch a sport you've never
been to before" Seriously, the
squash program needs money, y'all.

"22. Meet a Nobel laureate"
Thoroughly embarrass yourself
and them by showing up in a giraffe
costume.

"26. Write a letter to the Daily"

Plagiarize me.
"28. Share [more than] memo
ries at Senior Dinner on the Quad"
Drink too much in front of your
parents, sneak away and share spit
with a rando in the History Corner.

Find couples having
sex in the stacks and
troll them with a
pro-life protest.
