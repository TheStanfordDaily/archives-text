# The 						First (and Last) Annual Brady's Senior Spring Bucket List
## 
### Taylor Brady 
I've promised my readers some
critical journalism, and I swear
that it's coming, but research
for these things exhausts a surpris
ing amount of time. So while we
wait for the magma to erupt, I fig
ure it's about time that I introduce
some levity into everybody's life. I
hate being a downer right during fi
nals, so consider this your shot of
adder- I mean, ampheta- I mean,
caffeine ... unless you have a pre
scription for those other substances
that absolutely nobody illegally
abuses here.

Just last week, the 2013 class
presidents released a "Senior
Spring Bucket List." It included
old fan favorites like "12. Make a
new best friend in your last quar
ter" (far enough into their post-
Pizzeria wine-binge they'll pour
their heart out to you, just be care
ful about other things leaving their
mouth); "27. Play sports with an
Olympic athlete" (get
humiliated/pull a hamstring); and
"68. Sign up for alumni mailing lists
please keep in touch" (cut out
the middleman and send them your
account number and PIN).
Since the list is so laughably
vanilla, I thought that I'd go

through as much of it as I can in
print, modify the sanctioned activi
ties and thereby introduce the:

First (and Last) Annual Brady's
Senior Spring Bucket List!

"1. Plan your last quarter of
classes" Wine tasting, super
beer tasting (at Haus Mitt, look it
up), recreational narcotics con
sumption, CEE 289; Random Vi
brations, IHUM.
"6. Sleep somewhere outdoors
on campus" Never been sexiled
THAT hard. On the bright side, you
have raccoons to cuddle with.
"7. Watch the sunrise from the

Dish" with your new raccoon
lover.
"8. Stargaze from the middle of
Lake Lag" So it IS possible to
get malaria in the United States.
"9. Go on a road trip" Drop
out of school to do so and take the
10,000:1 chance that you'll become
Ken Kesey.
"10. Skinny dip in a fountain"

Two words: yeast infection.
"14. Cement that one faculty
you'll keep in touch with" Put a
ring on it.

"18. Attend an obscure musical
performance" Hippie drum cir
cle at Synergy doesn't count.
"19. Watch a sport you've never
been to before" Seriously, the
squash program needs money, y'all.

"22. Meet a Nobel laureate"
Thoroughly embarrass yourself
and them by showing up in a giraffe
costume.

"26. Write a letter to the Daily"

Plagiarize me.
"28. Share [more than] memo
ries at Senior Dinner on the Quad"
Drink too much in front of your
parents, sneak away and share spit
with a rando in the History Corner.

Find couples having
sex in the stacks and
troll them with a
pro-life protest.
"30. Donate blood" in a
Satanic mass to the almighty
Res Ed.

"34. Pull one last all
nighter— for fun this time"
Do it in Res Ed's offices.
Make s'mores over a camp
fire.

"36. Hook up in the
stacks" Have sex in the
stacks. Alternatively, find
aforementioned couples in
the stacks and troll them
with a pro-life protest. Get
really awkward when they
tell you they're conceiving.
"37. Go to a speech by a
famous person" Watch the
professor introducing them
drone on for longer than the
speaker (J.M. Coetzee talk,
anybody?)

"38. Watch the sunset
from the Bender Room"

Bring Mariachi Cardenal
and see how long it takes you
to get kicked out.
"43. Finally learn how to
stop procrastinating" Re
scind your coterm accept
ance.

"47. Listen to a final lec

ture at Class Day Lecture"
Fall asleep in the front
row.

"54. Ride the Marguerite"
Margaritas on the Mar
guerite.
"57. Invent your own
drinking game" Name it:
"one drink for every one of
the original items in this
bucket list that I DON'T
want to do"...end up in a
meeting with Ralph Castro
in April.

"59. Attend a party in
every Row house" Note: a
hot prowl =/= [l]a party.
"60. Explore a building
you've never been to before"
Your professor's house
doesn't count.
"63. Have a moment of
peace [pipe] at Baccalaure
ate."

"67. Find an alternative
mode of transportation to
class" Warning: I was
fined $3OO for hitching my
horse outside the History
Corner. Also arrested for
stealing "my" horse from the
red barn.

"71. Play beach volleyball
anywhere on campus" In
side Hewlett 200 encour
aged.
"74. Go to Trivia Night @
Rose and Crown" Don't

go to Trivia Night @ Rose
and Crown.

"77. Find [two people
hooking up in] your secret
spot on campus" Go home
and cry yourself to sleep.
"84. Get an apartment"
I hear they don't put keycard
scanners on the doors there.

"85. Call your RAs from
Freshman Year" Ask
them if they're still dating
the residents that they start
ed dating in June 2010.
"92. Try an Ike's sand
wich you've never had be
fore"— Hint: they all taste
the same.

"97. Take advantage of
the free food and giveaways
that are so many places!"

Find out what it's like to be a
raccoon.

"98. Spend time building
something with your
friends" Beer can towers
are pleb tier. Try erecting a
horse stable on President
Hennessy's lawn.
"100. Graduate!"
Coterm.

Have some more ideas for
how Taylor can attempt to get
himself expelled before June ?
