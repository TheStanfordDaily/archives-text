## Taylor Swift Poehler/Fey The 						perils of celebrity feuds in the Twitter age

cc Y | a special place in hell for
women who don't help other
_A_ women," Taylor Swift said in a
recent Vanity Fair interview. If you have been
living under a rock, you might assume Swiff was
referring to some serious girl-on-girl crime, per
haps bullying or gossip.
In fact, she was criticizing Amy Poehler and
Tina Fey, who briefly joked at this year's Golden
Globes that Taylor Swiff should "stay away from
Michael J. Fox's son."
Given that Poehler and Fey are nearly uni
versally adored, especially online, Taylor Swiff's
comment has sparked a significant degree of
backlash. Many of the responses took form in
predictable tweets and Facebook statuses: "She
can dish it out in her songs but she can't take it"

"She needs thicker skin to survive in
Hollywood" "The joke wasn't even that offen
sive." However, many took to Tumblr, Gawker
and Buzzfeed to point out that Poehler has a
popular web series designed to give girls advice,
and Tina Fey, as one of today's preeminent
female comedy writers, has make huge strides
for women in the entertainment industry. For
Swift to insinuate Poehler and Fey don't "help
women," especially given that most of Taylor's
songs are about being hung up on boyfriends,
was a claim that the Internet ripped apart with
glee.
However, Amy and Tina's responses have
been much more levelheaded. Fey seemed
shocked that of all the jokes she made at the
Golden Globes, this was the one that received
any backlash.
"If anyone was going to get mad at us, I
thought it would be James Cameron. I did not
see that one coming," she has said, referencing a
jibe about trusting the woman who used to be
married to Cameron to make a good film about
torture.
Meanwhile, Amy Poehler was more glib.
"I feel bad if she was upset. I am a feminist,
and she is a young and talented girl. That being
said, I do agree I am going to hell. But for other
reasons. Mostly boring tax stuff," Poehler has
stated.
Now that Fey and Poehler have responded
and Swiff has let their statements sit, the feud
will likely die down (though I am looking for
ward to the song that Swiff will inevitably write

about this). However, this mini-feud illustrates
how Internet culture is like steroids for celebrity
gossip. Five years ago, this feud would have
played out in publicist-crafted magazine quotes
and Entertainment Tonight sound bites.
However, in 2013, Taylor Swift's original com
ment and Fey and Poehler's responses have been
shared on Facebook, re-tweeted, made into
GIFs, shared some more, blogged about, com
mented on, remixed and mashed up with
screaming goat noises. What might have been a
low-key water-cooler conversation has turned
into a feud we can actively perpetuate via social
media.
A similar effect is at play with Anne
Hathaway. While in 2012 she was making waves
with her turn as Catwoman in "The Dark
Knight Rises" even President Obama
remarked she was the best part of the film by
awards season 2013, she was a punch line on the
Internet. What exactly she did to win the
Internet's universal derision is unclear many
point to her campaign to win Academy Award
for Best Supporting Actress, which included
revealing her dramatic weight loss for Les
Miserables, endless magazine photo shoots and
interview after interview in which quote after
quote was picked apart and mocked. That cul
minated on Oscar night when she gave an awk
ward acceptance speech that included cradling
her Oscar like a baby and whispering it, not to
mention making all the worst-dressed lists with
her strangely-cut pink Prada number.
But what really did Hathaway in, in terms

of public image, was her inability to translate to
social media. Even though she gave two of the
best acting performances of 2012, her overly
enthusiastic public presence and untraditional
beauty make her an easy target for online critics
from Twitter to Jezebel. Meanwhile, fellow
Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence, with her self
deprecating sense of humor, unpretentious atti
tude and GIF-ready expressions has managed to
make herself incredibly well-liked.
So what does this mean? In this new
decade, celebrities have to be extra-conscious of
eveiy word, sound bite and expression. And we,
formerly the audience, have the power to direct
ly mold the public image of celebrities one
tweet or goat video at a time.
