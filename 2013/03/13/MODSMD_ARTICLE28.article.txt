## MOVIES TO CATCH OVER SPRING BREAK THE 						TOP FIVE 
### 
"Oz the Great and Powerful"
The 1939 classic gets a CGI makeover on the big
screen. "Oz the Great and Powerful," which
opened March 8, has gotten mixed reviews: kids
love it, feminists hate it (why does the Wicked
Witch have cleavage?) and there's a 99 percent
chance that there's too much James Franco. Also,
the "Wizard of Oz" prequel doesn't have a whole
lot of Dorothy, and her ruby slippers are dearly
missed. However, if you're looking for a 130-

minute visual orgasm, catch "Oz" next week at
the movies.
"Silver Linings Playbook"
This bold Oscar favorite is still playing in theaters
and Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are
still killing it on the screen. Salsa lovers, humor
lovers and romantics rave about "Silver Linings
Playbook," for which Lawrence won Best Actress
at the 2013 Academy Awards and Cooper,
Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver
received nominations across all four acting cate
gories. "SLP" gets a bonus for tackling the very
relevant issue of mental health in a real way.
"Spring Breakers"
It's spring break. A movie called "Spring Breakers"
sounds like a good idea. James Franco, Vanessa
Hudgens, Selena Gomez and Ashley Benson star
in the awkward-looking movie with a trailer that
features Disney stars, guns and girls in way-too
small bikinis something for everyone in the
family! "Spring Breakers" hits theaters March 22.
"Admission"
We're a little obsessed with Paul Rudd and Tina
Fey, so we have pretty high expectations for
"Admission." The plot, if nothing else, is college
friendly Fey plays an admissions officer for an
Ivy League school who fights for one eclectic stu
dent's admission. Plot twist: he might also be her
long-lost son. It's a little soap opera, but everyone
loved Les Mis too, so ... "Admission" opens in
theaters March 22.

"G.I. Joe: Retaliation"
"G.I. Joe: Retaliation" is a movie that we've been
anticipating for a long time the film was
pushed back nine months in order to be con
verted to 3D. Was it worth it? We hope so, judg
ing by the perfect action-movie cast that
includes Bruce Willis, Channing Tatum and The
Rock. Tatum, who did some pretty impressive
acting in 2012 with "The Vow" and "21 Jump
Street," will likely continue his box office win
ning streak. If not, we'll be waiting for "Magic
Mike 2" anyways. "G.I. Joe: Retaliation" opens in
theaters March 28.

Spring break might come in the form of your annual trip to Bora Bora,
or it might just mean going home to sleep for seven days straight. No
matter what your plans, the free time means it's time to hit the movie
theater right when the theater most needs the money. Intermission has the
top movies you should check out over the break.
