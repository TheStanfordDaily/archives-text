## Condoleezza Rice leads football recruitment efforts 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
When courting recruits for his
Rose Bowl-winning football team,
Stanford head coach David Shaw '94
can say plenty about the quality of the
Cardinal football program.
Even so, in order to truly wow po
tential players with all that Stanford
has to offer, Shaw often brings in the
person he calls his "cleanup hitter"
former Secretary of State Condoleez
za Rice.

"She could live in so many places
and do so many other things, but she
likes to surround herself with the
brightest and the best, and she found
that here at Stanford," Shaw said.
"She relates that really well to recruits
and their families."
Rice currently serves as a profes
sor in the Graduate School of Business
and a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution, but her ties to the Farm ex
tend far beyond her current academic
