## Condoleezza Rice leads football recruitment efforts 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
When courting recruits for his
Rose Bowl-winning football team,
Stanford head coach David Shaw '94
can say plenty about the quality of the
Cardinal football program.
Even so, in order to truly wow po
tential players with all that Stanford
has to offer, Shaw often brings in the
person he calls his "cleanup hitter"
former Secretary of State Condoleez
za Rice.

"She could live in so many places
and do so many other things, but she
likes to surround herself with the
brightest and the best, and she found
that here at Stanford," Shaw said.
"She relates that really well to recruits
and their families."
Rice currently serves as a profes
sor in the Graduate School of Business
and a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution, but her ties to the Farm ex
tend far beyond her current academic

Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice plays a significant role in recruiting
top football players to Stanford. Rice, who got her master's at Notre
Dame, draws recruits to the Farm who are also considering South Bend.
positions. The Birmingham, Ala.,
native joined Stanford's faculty in
1981 as a political science professor
and served as University provost
from 1993-99.

According to Rice, she became
involved with the football program
during the 1980s, when the coaches
would hold faculty brunches with
recruits. Since then, whenever
she's on campus, Rice has found
time to meet with recruits from a
variety of sports.
"I never say that Stanford is the
only option, but Stanford is about
excellence, and you should want to
go to a place where excellence is
appreciated," Rice said. "Here, you
won't be odd or unusual for caring
about both academics and athlet
ics."

"She's a successful woman, but
there's probably not too many
things she hasn't been through
she's a product of hard work,"
Sanders said. "Who wouldn't want
to look up to someone who has been
in the White House?"

Shaw said that Rice's experi
ences across the University allow
her to answer almost any question
recruits may have. Her experience
travelling also allows her to com
pare Stanford to other universities.
According to Shaw, Rice is par
ticularly helpful in talking to re
cruits who are also considering
Notre Dame, where Rice earned
her masters degree. Asked to com
ment, Rice used her well-practiced
diplomatic skills.
"They're both great institu
tions, and I love both of them,"
Rice laughed. "There's never just
one good place."
Rice is not just a prominent but
casual football supporter, however.
According to Shaw, she has the
mind of a coach.
Rice's father was a football
coach, and she joked that she was
"supposed to be his star middle
linebacker." Although Rice's gen
der may have derailed that plan,
that didn't stop her father from
talking football with his only child.

Shaw said that, at Stanford, the
divide between the academic and
athletic aspects of the school is
much smaller than it is at other uni
versities, as exemplified by Rice's
direct engagement with recruits
and players.

"She wants them to feel like
they can talk to her, because that's
the feeling here at Stanford," Shaw
said. "Stanford professors want to
know what you want to do so that
they can help you accomplish your
goals."

According to Cardinal football
player Ronnie Harris 'l5, Rice
greeted him by name in the tunnel
before a game on a recruiting visit,
an experience that Harris called
"surreal." Rice told Harris that
Stanford's academics were already
top-notch and Stanford football
was on its way to the same level.
"It influenced my recruiting to a
certain extent because seeing that
amount of people that have such a
prestigious regard for Stanford
everybody comes here for different
jobs and life perspectives, so that's
pretty cool," Harris said.
Players also noted Rice's ability
to share her background in a relat
able way. Running back Barry
Sanders Jr. 'l6 said that Rice de
scribed her childhood in Birming
ham as similar to "the little girl
from 'Remember the Titans,"' a

Shaw said that he and Rice have
drawn up some safety plays or con
sidered ways to exploit the mis
matches that Stanford's tight ends
have created in recent years.
"She loves that dynamic that we
use to make big plays and also be
big targets in the Red Zone," Shaw
said. "She hates prevent defenses.
She loves defenses that are aggres
sive at the end of the game."

A lifelong Cleveland Browns
fan, Rice claims to have watched
every Super Bowl during her life
time and once said her dream job
would be commissioner of the Na
tional Football League. Today, that
passion extends to the Cardinal.
Despite her busy travel sched
ule, Rice said she does her best to
make all football home games as
well as to attend other athletic
events throughout the year. Be
yond football, she is particularly in
volved with the women's golf team,
serving as a mentor to several
golfers and hosting the team's
Stanford Invitational tournament
last October.

Even when she isn't physically
present, moreover, Rice supports
the Cardinal from afar. This past
season, Rice happened to be in the
Middle East during Stanford foot
ball's rivalry game at the Universi
ty of Oregon. That didn't stop her
from waking up early and using the
Internet to watch what Rice called
"one of the best wins ever."

Shaw said that, when he has
shared the press box with her, Rice
doesn't merely take in the game.
Instead, her anxiety, exhilaration
and energy are palpable.
"All of our recruits, their fami
lies, our coaches and our players
just truly appreciate the fact that
she's accessible and that she is
clear in her passion," Shaw said.
"It's something special to know
that someone of her stature chose
to be at Stanford football games
rooting for Stanford University."
