# Hospital staff protest outside management
## Custodians cite pay, workload issues, allege uncaring managers 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an auditorium in the Li Ka Shing Center for Learning and
Knowledge at Stanford Hospital, 13 custodians from the Stan
ford School of Medicine and Stanford Hospital and Clinics sit in a
semicircle to talk. Some of them are new employees, hired just
weeks ago. Others have been working at Stanford for 21, 27 or
even 37 years. Whether they're veterans or rookies, however,
they all agree: There's never been a worse time to be a custodian
at the hospital.
Them complaints are varied. Managerial abuses, increased
workload and a hostile work environment top a long list of griev
ances. But regardless of the specific issue, they all focus on a par
ticular set of managers: those who don't work for Stanford.
After Stanford hired the outside contractor Sodexo to manage
their custodians in at least four buildings in the School of Medi
cine in 2007, those custodians say the jobs they had enjoyed for
decades took a drastic turn for the worse.
Workloads increased in 2008 due to a rough economy, and they
increased again when the custodians' contract was renegotiated
in 2011. When several custodians brought up that a doubled
workload may merit a pay increase, they were shut down.
"They told us, 'You guys are making too much money here,"'
said one custodian with more than 20 years of experience at Stan
ford, who makes $23,000 a year. "They said, 'We need to give you
more work to be even with other companies. We're going to give
you more work.'"
In addition to workload increases, several custodians detailed
specific instances when they felt their Sodexo managers mis
treated them.
In one instance, a custodian requested two days of grievance
time after his mother passed
away. After two days passed,
he asked for another two days
to take care of burial prepara
tions, having encountered
struggles in locating a priest
to conduct the burial ceremo
ny-

His second request was
denied, leading the custodian
to go over the head of his
Sodexo manager and give a
death certificate to Stanford
Hospital's human resources
department. This angered
the Sodexo manager, who
according to the custodian
told him he was going to "in
vestigate" him and his moth
er.

"There are no feelings,"
he said. "They don't care."
A different custodian told
a story about his mother, who
was going into surgery at
Stanford Hospital. He re
quested the day off five days
before the surgery, but it
wasn't until the day before
the surgery that a Sodexo
manager declined the re
quest.

"He said, 'The doctor is
going to take care of your
mom, not you,"' the custodian
remembered.

Early next morning, he
went to human resources,
where he was told the only
way to get the day off was to

get a note from the operating
surgeon. Even after this, his
Sodexo manager asked him
to bring in all the medical
records for his mother, from
when she first entered the
hospital.
Other custodians spoke
about harassment at their
jobs, especially while they eat
lunch and are on their
breaks. This practice only
started after Sodexo took
over managing operations.
"[Before Sodexo], if you
do your area and you are re
sponsible, nobody say noth
ing to you," said one custodi
an. "Nobody bothers you.
Nobody was looking to give
you more work."

One custodian said he de
livered a signed letter to the
president of Stanford Hospi
tal & Clinics, listing many of
these same grievances with
Sodexo. The next day, Sodexo
managers called the custodi
ans into a meeting, five at a
time.

"They said, 'lf you are
happy working with Stan
ford, sign here,"' said a custo
dian who was in one of the
meetings. "We didn't know
what we were signing."
According to the custodi
ans, no one from Stanford
was in that meeting. Indeed,
the custodians repeated
throughout interviews that
they enjoyed working for
Stanford â€”it was the out
side contractor Stanford had
hired that bothered them.

"We are happy working for

Stanford, but not the Sodexo
people," said the same custodi
an.

In addition to full-time
custodians, several part-time
custodians, who often work
the same amount with half
the benefits, also clean the
Stanford Hospital.

"We are scheduled to
work 40 hours a week, even
though we are part time,"
said one part-time worker.
"We are OK with the job, but
we are not OK because we
don't have the same benefits.
We get half of the PTO [paid
time off], half of the vacation
... Healthcare is the same,
but we don't get weekends
off. Full-time people get
every other weekend [off]."

Many of the claims quoted
in this article can he veri
fied through hospital
records, copies of Stan
ford Hospital's human
resources policy and in
terviews with Stanford
Hospital administrators
and Sodexo managers. A
March 5 email to Stan
ford Hospital spokesman
James Larkin requested
interviews with hospital
administrators, detailing
many of the issues.
Larkin replied on March
11, however, that he was
"not sure that we will be
able to accommodate your
interview requests."
