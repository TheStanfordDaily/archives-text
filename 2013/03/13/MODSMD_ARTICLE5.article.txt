## STUDEBAKER THE 						TREE 
### MOLLY VORWERCK DESK EDITOR 
This year marks the 50th birthday of the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band's
(LSJUMB) mascot: the Tree. After a week of
treehouse building and naked guitar strumming,
computer science major Calvin Studebaker 'l5
beat out two other competitors to become Stanford's next
Tree, a role he has embraced with gusto since taking the
reigns from Nicoletta von Heidegger 'l3 in February. The
Daily sat down with Studebaker to get the scoop on his Tree
Week tryouts, as well as what he hopes to bring to the table
come football season next fall.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): I hear most students who try
out for the Tree are in the Band. Are you a member of the
LSJUMB?
Calvin Studebaker (CS): Well, not everyone who tries out
has to be a member of the band, but I played trombone back
in sixth grade for a year and that put me pretty far ahead of
a lot of trombone players here in the band, so I decided to
join.
TSD: Besides being a member of the Band, what other
activities are you involved with at Stanford?
CS: The big one is section leading I'm a section leader
for [CS] 1068. I'm part of a gymnastics club that meets at
the Ford Center twice a week. I joined the diving club so
that I could use the high diving board for one of my Tree
Week stunts.
TSD: Why did you decide to audition for the Tree?
CS: I had been in Band for a while, and I thought the
Tree was just an awesome thing to be, and I could see my
self going crazy and dancing and all that good stuff.
I'm also pretty good friends with Michael Samuels 'l2
M.S. 'l3, who was the Tree before Nicoletta, and I just saw
him at a party one night, and I was like "How was being
Tree? Do you recommend it?" and he was like "Do it! Do it!
You totally should do it!" He said regardless of whether
or not you end up becoming Tree Tree Week was one of
the best weeks of his life. So far Tree Week ... I wouldn't say
it's the best part of being Tree so far, but it was such a high
light.

TSD: What were some of the crazy activities you did to
audition for Tree Week, which began the day after Dolly
Day?

CS: Right off the bat, I wanted my entrance to be coming
out of a treehouse, so the night after Dolly Day, me and my
friends spent all night building this treehouse outside of the
band shack. We got pretty far, we built pretty much the floor,
and then ... this guy from the athletic department walked
by and started asking us questions, and he's like, "Did you
talk to so and so before doing this?" and I was like, "No,"
and then he was like, "Email this person before continuing!"
So we just had this platform,
and my big stunt was going to be
living in this treehouse for a week.
The next morning I chilled up in
the platform for an hour before
everyone came, and I gave a
speech as I descended the plat
form, and then I did flips and stuff
off of the picnic tables.
For my next stunt, I went out in
front of Coupa [Cafe] by Meyer,
and I was just dressed up in a robe
and haircutting cape, and I had
Samuels shave a tree into my hair.
It's off center, but I think it looks
good.

Then I took the clippers from
Samuels, put them on the ground,
stood up, ripped off the haircutting
cape, and then I was just naked
with this guitar, and I just sang this
song that I wrote about why all the
Pac-12 mascots suck and why the
tree is awesome.

My parents were in the crowd
because they were here for Par
ents' Weekend, and they had no
idea I was doing this. So I brought
my parents up and stood with
them, took a picture naked with the
guitar. In the picture my mom is
just so far away from me, trying to
put her arm around me without
touching me, but they were good
sports about it. They helped me
dye my hair later that day.

TSD: Have your official duties
begun as Tree?
CS: My first sports game was
Sprout Night last Sunday during a
women's basketball game. A bunch
of old Trees came, and we were all
dancing. I was dressed up like a
sprout, and I had so much glitter
on me. We were just rocking out,
and then at half time, I got inside
the Tree with Nicoletta, and then
she burst me out from under the
tree, and then she handed the tree
over, and I put it on, and I was the
Tree for the rest of the game.

TSD: How are you going to de
sign your new Tree costume?
CS: There are a couple key
things I know I want to do with the
costume. As far as the structure,
the past two years have really just
been a backpack metal frame with
just rings coming off of it with net
ting to attach leaves. I think that's

a solid design, so one thing I want
to do is have leafy eyebrows on the
tree that I can control from the in
side because it would give the tree
a lot more expression than just
mouth open or mouth closed. And
then you know, some iridescent
leaves or some neon lighting
leaves. I just want to make it really
flashy and cool looking.

I actually found these stilts that
have this metal arc in the back, so
you're taller, but you're also really
bouncy so it's like a trampoline
wherever you go. I really want to
master them, and I think it would
be awesome if the Tree wore these
stilts. I'm scared I might break my
ankle if I try to wear the Tree in
those, so I might just pull them out
every now and again for rallies and
stuff.

TSD: Now that you're the Tree,
has your reputation changed on
campus?
CS: So I thought I would feel a
lot different. Honestly, I don't think
it's sunk in yet. After my first game
as the Tree, it started to feel more
real, like, "Wow, I'm the Tree now."
But it's surreal. It hasn't really hit
me. I don't think it will hit me until
three weeks after being Tree.
But as far as being a big man on
campus, I think that comes with
other people knowing that I'm
Tree, which I feel like a lot of peo
ple don't necessarily. Still, at times
I go places, and people see my hair,
and they are like, "Tree!" or "Con
gratulations!"

and haircutting cape, and I had
Samuels shave a tree into my hair.
It's off center, but I think it looks
good.

Then I took the clippers from
Samuels, put them on the ground,
stood up, ripped off the haircutting
cape, and then I was just naked
with this guitar, and I just sang this
song that I wrote about why all the
Pac-12 mascots suck and why the
tree is awesome.

My parents were in the crowd
because they were here for Par
ents' Weekend, and they had no
idea I was doing this. So I brought
my parents up and stood with
them, took a picture naked with the
guitar. In the picture my mom is
just so far away from me, trying to
put her arm around me without
touching me, but they were good
sports about it. They helped me
dye my hair later that day.

TSD: Have your official duties
begun as Tree?
CS: My first sports game was
Sprout Night last Sunday during a
women's basketball game. A bunch
of old Trees came, and we were all
dancing. I was dressed up like a
sprout, and I had so much glitter
on me. We were just rocking out,
and then at half time, I got inside
the Tree with Nicoletta, and then
she burst me out from under the
tree, and then she handed the tree
over, and I put it on, and I was the
Tree for the rest of the game.

TSD: How are you going to de
sign your new Tree costume?
CS: There are a couple key
things I know I want to do with the
costume. As far as the structure,
the past two years have really just
been a backpack metal frame with
just rings coming off of it with net
ting to attach leaves. I think that's

a solid design, so one thing I want
to do is have leafy eyebrows on the
tree that I can control from the in
side because it would give the tree
a lot more expression than just
mouth open or mouth closed. And
then you know, some iridescent
leaves or some neon lighting
leaves. I just want to make it really
flashy and cool looking.

I actually found these stilts that
have this metal arc in the back, so
you're taller, but you're also really
bouncy so it's like a trampoline
wherever you go. I really want to
master them, and I think it would
be awesome if the Tree wore these
stilts. I'm scared I might break my
ankle if I try to wear the Tree in
those, so I might just pull them out
every now and again for rallies and
stuff.

TSD: Now that you're the Tree,
has your reputation changed on
campus?
CS: So I thought I would feel a
lot different. Honestly, I don't think
it's sunk in yet. After my first game
as the Tree, it started to feel more
real, like, "Wow, I'm the Tree now."
But it's surreal. It hasn't really hit
me. I don't think it will hit me until
three weeks after being Tree.
But as far as being a big man on
campus, I think that comes with
other people knowing that I'm
Tree, which I feel like a lot of peo
ple don't necessarily. Still, at times
I go places, and people see my hair,
and they are like, "Tree!" or "Con
gratulations!"

Calvin Studebaker '15, the new Tree, built a treehouse and played a guitar while naked in front of Meyer
Library during Tree Week to prove his mettle. Studebaker also had a friend shave a tree into his hair.
This year marks the 50th birthday of the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band's
(LSJUMB) mascot: the Tree. After a week of
treehouse building and naked guitar strumming,
computer science major Calvin Studebaker 'l5
beat out two other competitors to become Stanford's next
Tree, a role he has embraced with gusto since taking the
reigns from Nicoletta von Heidegger 'l3 in February. The
Daily sat down with Studebaker to get the scoop on his Tree
Week tryouts, as well as what he hopes to bring to the table
come football season next fall.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): I hear most students who try
out for the Tree are in the Band. Are you a member of the
LSJUMB?
Calvin Studebaker (CS): Well, not everyone who tries out
has to be a member of the band, but I played trombone back
in sixth grade for a year and that put me pretty far ahead of
a lot of trombone players here in the band, so I decided to
join.
TSD: Besides being a member of the Band, what other
activities are you involved with at Stanford?
CS: The big one is section leading I'm a section leader
for [CS] 1068. I'm part of a gymnastics club that meets at
the Ford Center twice a week. I joined the diving club so
that I could use the high diving board for one of my Tree
Week stunts.
TSD: Why did you decide to audition for the Tree?
CS: I had been in Band for a while, and I thought the
Tree was just an awesome thing to be, and I could see my
self going crazy and dancing and all that good stuff.
I'm also pretty good friends with Michael Samuels 'l2
M.S. 'l3, who was the Tree before Nicoletta, and I just saw
him at a party one night, and I was like "How was being
Tree? Do you recommend it?" and he was like "Do it! Do it!
You totally should do it!" He said regardless of whether
or not you end up becoming Tree Tree Week was one of
the best weeks of his life. So far Tree Week ... I wouldn't say
it's the best part of being Tree so far, but it was such a high
light.

TSD: What were some of the crazy activities you did to
audition for Tree Week, which began the day after Dolly
Day?

CS: Right off the bat, I wanted my entrance to be coming
out of a treehouse, so the night after Dolly Day, me and my
friends spent all night building this treehouse outside of the
band shack. We got pretty far, we built pretty much the floor,
and then ... this guy from the athletic department walked
by and started asking us questions, and he's like, "Did you
talk to so and so before doing this?" and I was like, "No,"
and then he was like, "Email this person before continuing!"
So we just had this platform,
and my big stunt was going to be
living in this treehouse for a week.
The next morning I chilled up in
the platform for an hour before
everyone came, and I gave a
speech as I descended the plat
form, and then I did flips and stuff
off of the picnic tables.
For my next stunt, I went out in
front of Coupa [Cafe] by Meyer,
and I was just dressed up in a robe
and haircutting cape, and I had
Samuels shave a tree into my hair.
It's off center, but I think it looks
