# Q&A Calvin
## STUDEBAKER THE
						TREE 
### MOLLY VORWERCK DESK EDITOR 
This year marks the 50th birthday of the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band's
(LSJUMB) mascot: the Tree. After a week of
treehouse building and naked guitar strumming,
computer science major Calvin Studebaker 'l5
beat out two other competitors to become Stanford's next
Tree, a role he has embraced with gusto since taking the
reigns from Nicoletta von Heidegger 'l3 in February. The
Daily sat down with Studebaker to get the scoop on his Tree
Week tryouts, as well as what he hopes to bring to the table
come football season next fall.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): I hear most students who try
out for the Tree are in the Band. Are you a member of the
LSJUMB?
Calvin Studebaker (CS): Well, not everyone who tries out
has to be a member of the band, but I played trombone back
in sixth grade for a year and that put me pretty far ahead of
a lot of trombone players here in the band, so I decided to
join.
TSD: Besides being a member of the Band, what other
activities are you involved with at Stanford?
CS: The big one is section leading I'm a section leader
for [CS] 1068. I'm part of a gymnastics club that meets at
the Ford Center twice a week. I joined the diving club so
that I could use the high diving board for one of my Tree
Week stunts.
TSD: Why did you decide to audition for the Tree?
CS: I had been in Band for a while, and I thought the
Tree was just an awesome thing to be, and I could see my
self going crazy and dancing and all that good stuff.
I'm also pretty good friends with Michael Samuels 'l2
M.S. 'l3, who was the Tree before Nicoletta, and I just saw
him at a party one night, and I was like "How was being
Tree? Do you recommend it?" and he was like "Do it! Do it!
You totally should do it!" He said regardless of whether
or not you end up becoming Tree Tree Week was one of
the best weeks of his life. So far Tree Week ... I wouldn't say
it's the best part of being Tree so far, but it was such a high
light.

TSD: What were some of the crazy activities you did to
audition for Tree Week, which began the day after Dolly
Day?

CS: Right off the bat, I wanted my entrance to be coming
out of a treehouse, so the night after Dolly Day, me and my
friends spent all night building this treehouse outside of the
band shack. We got pretty far, we built pretty much the floor,
and then ... this guy from the athletic department walked
by and started asking us questions, and he's like, "Did you
talk to so and so before doing this?" and I was like, "No,"
and then he was like, "Email this person before continuing!"
