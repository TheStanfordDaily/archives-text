# CARD BACK ATOP THE PAC
## ORRANGE'S 20 EARN TOP SEED 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
With star junior Chiney Ogwumike
having the lowest scoring game of her
career in Sunday's Pac-12 Champi
onship game, sophomore point guard
Amber Orrange stepped up against No.
14 UCLA to lead the Cardinal to a

thrilling 51-49 victory.
The win earned Stanford its seventh
consecutive tournament title and a
highly desired No. 1 seed for the NCAA
Tournament. The game's aggressive
and down-to-the-wire play simulated
the intensity of March Madness, and
the Cardinal's success in pulling out a
close win in the end proves its ability to
compete at a higher level especially
when Ogwumike was held to just three
points by a tight Brains defense.
Orrange became the saving grace
for the Card, scoring a career-high 20
points and snagging three steals.

The No. 4 Stanford women's basket
ball team is no longer a one-trick pony.

Sophomore point guard Amber Orrange (above) turned in the best
performance of her career in the Pac-12 Title game, making the winning
shot with seven seconds left to put the Card ahead of UCLA 51 -49.
Though only a sophomore, she
demonstrated senior leader
ship on the court and never
gave up on any play.
"With about eight minutes
left in the game, coach [Tara
VanDerveer] came up to me
and said 'You can't do this by
yourself,'" Ogwumike said.
"So after that I knew that this
was Amber's night. She had
the best feel of the game of
anyone on the floor, and I
trusted her... She's a hard
worker and it proves that
hard work always wins out."
Stanford started the game
on an 11-0 run, holding the
Brains scoreless until 12 min
utes were left in the first half.
All momentum was with the
Cardinal as it knocked down
shot after shot, with UCLA
shooting a dismal 9.7 percent
at one point in the first.
But UCLA, led by Atonye
Nyingifa (10 points, nine re
bounds) hit two shots with un
der a minute to play in the first
half to finish the opening peri
od on a 23-12 run of its own.
The Brains were able to capi
talize while Ogwumike sat out
with two fouls for the final five
minutes of the half. UCLA
went into halftime with a nar
row 27-26 lead and all of the
momentum on its side.

"I thought because of the
nature of the game, the way it
was being called, I wanted
[Ogwumike] in the second
half, and it was a good chance
to let her rest," VanDerveer
said. "I really have confidence
in Chiney that she won't foul.
I just thought I'd let her rest
a little bit, and we just needed
other people to come in and
help a little.
"I thought we would've
been in more trouble without
Amber. We couldn't run an of
fense — they were athletic

and aggressive. We turned
the ball over too much when
[Orrange] was out. The per
son in the first half who really
kept it together was Bonnie,
though."
Sophomore guard Bonnie
Samuelson shot an impressive
3-for-4 from behind the arc
and kept the Card close at
half with her much-needed
boost from the bench.

The second half was a dog
fight, with five ties and seven
lead changes. Both teams
brought the same grit and de
termination, but Ogwumike
credits the Card's mental
toughness as the reason it
pulled out a win in the end.
Although UCLA was
physical down low, Stanford
demonstrated its own physi
cality by taking three charges
for Bruin offensive fouls. Og
wumike drew two charges in
the game and redshirt junior
Mikaela Ruef (eight points,
four rebounds) took another
one late in the second half to
give Stanford a much-needed
possession.

In the end, though, it was
Orrange who saved the game
for Stanford. With two min
utes to play, the score was tied
when she drove hard to the
basket to finish with a left
handed layup. UCLA went
down the court and answered
right back, tying the game at
47 and threatening to send
the game to overtime.

After the teams ex
changed baskets, Orrange
waited as the clock ticked
down and took the game into
her own hands, driving to the
hoop and throwing up a circus
shot that went in, giving Stan
ford the lead at 51-49 with just
seven seconds to play.
At the end of the game, the
only thing Orrange remem

bers thinking was, "I want to
win, I want to win, I'll do what
ever it takes. I just looked for
opportunities to take chances
on offense and defense and
luckily it worked out."
"She has had a great tour
nament," VanDerveer said.
"She had more help around
her last year so I think this
was her best game. Amber
put the team on her back to
day and she really went to the
basket, she made some really
nice passes. I was most proud
of when she had a turnover,
she made a mistake and hav
ing resolve, she went back
and got the steal."

UCLA senior forward
Markel Walker (16 points,
seven rebounds) tried to tie
up the game on her end of the
floor with a layup, but the
Stanford defense was too
much for her to overcome and
the ball ricocheted out of
bounds with .2 seconds left.
UCLA had just enough time
to inbound the ball to Nyingi
fa, but her shot was way off
and an ecstatic Cardinal
bench stormed the court to
celebrate an exciting Pac-12
Championship victory.
Ogwumike was awarded
with the Tournament MVI?
and Orrange was named to
the All-Tournament Team.

Surely the most important
thing to come out of this
weekend for the Card is a No.
1 seed heading into the
NCAA Tournament later this
month. Stanford will have two
bye weeks to prepare for
March Madness, hoping to en
ter the Final Four for the sixth
straight season and make it to
the championship game of that
tournament as well.

her last year so I think this
was her best game. Amber
put the team on her back to
day and she really went to the
basket, she made some really
nice passes. I was most proud
of when she had a turnover,
she made a mistake and hav
ing resolve, she went back
and got the steal."

UCLA senior forward
Markel Walker (16 points,
seven rebounds) tried to tie
up the game on her end of the
floor with a layup, but the
Stanford defense was too
much for her to overcome and
the ball ricocheted out of
bounds with .2 seconds left.
UCLA had just enough time
to inbound the ball to Nyingi
fa, but her shot was way off
and an ecstatic Cardinal
bench stormed the court to
celebrate an exciting Pac-12
Championship victory.
Ogwumike was awarded
with the Tournament MVI?
and Orrange was named to
the All-Tournament Team.

Surely the most important
thing to come out of this
weekend for the Card is a No.
1 seed heading into the
NCAA Tournament later this
month. Stanford will have two
bye weeks to prepare for
March Madness, hoping to en
ter the Final Four for the sixth
straight season and make it to
the championship game of that
tournament as well.

With star junior Chiney Ogwumike
having the lowest scoring game of her
career in Sunday's Pac-12 Champi
onship game, sophomore point guard
Amber Orrange stepped up against No.
14 UCLA to lead the Cardinal to a

thrilling 51-49 victory.
The win earned Stanford its seventh
consecutive tournament title and a
highly desired No. 1 seed for the NCAA
Tournament. The game's aggressive
and down-to-the-wire play simulated
the intensity of March Madness, and
the Cardinal's success in pulling out a
close win in the end proves its ability to
compete at a higher level especially
when Ogwumike was held to just three
points by a tight Brains defense.
Orrange became the saving grace
for the Card, scoring a career-high 20
points and snagging three steals.

The No. 4 Stanford women's basket
ball team is no longer a one-trick pony.

Sophomore point guard Amber Orrange (above) turned in the best
performance of her career in the Pac-12 Title game, making the winning
shot with seven seconds left to put the Card ahead of UCLA 51 -49.
Though only a sophomore, she
demonstrated senior leader
ship on the court and never
gave up on any play.
"With about eight minutes
left in the game, coach [Tara
VanDerveer] came up to me
and said 'You can't do this by
yourself,'" Ogwumike said.
"So after that I knew that this
was Amber's night. She had
the best feel of the game of
anyone on the floor, and I
trusted her... She's a hard
worker and it proves that
hard work always wins out."
Stanford started the game
on an 11-0 run, holding the
Brains scoreless until 12 min
utes were left in the first half.
All momentum was with the
Cardinal as it knocked down
shot after shot, with UCLA
shooting a dismal 9.7 percent
at one point in the first.
But UCLA, led by Atonye
Nyingifa (10 points, nine re
bounds) hit two shots with un
der a minute to play in the first
half to finish the opening peri
od on a 23-12 run of its own.
The Brains were able to capi
talize while Ogwumike sat out
with two fouls for the final five
minutes of the half. UCLA
went into halftime with a nar
row 27-26 lead and all of the
momentum on its side.

"I thought because of the
nature of the game, the way it
was being called, I wanted
[Ogwumike] in the second
half, and it was a good chance
to let her rest," VanDerveer
said. "I really have confidence
in Chiney that she won't foul.
I just thought I'd let her rest
a little bit, and we just needed
other people to come in and
help a little.
"I thought we would've
been in more trouble without
Amber. We couldn't run an of
fense — they were athletic

and aggressive. We turned
the ball over too much when
[Orrange] was out. The per
son in the first half who really
kept it together was Bonnie,
though."
Sophomore guard Bonnie
Samuelson shot an impressive
3-for-4 from behind the arc
and kept the Card close at
half with her much-needed
boost from the bench.

The second half was a dog
fight, with five ties and seven
lead changes. Both teams
brought the same grit and de
termination, but Ogwumike
credits the Card's mental
toughness as the reason it
pulled out a win in the end.
Although UCLA was
physical down low, Stanford
demonstrated its own physi
cality by taking three charges
for Bruin offensive fouls. Og
wumike drew two charges in
the game and redshirt junior
Mikaela Ruef (eight points,
four rebounds) took another
one late in the second half to
give Stanford a much-needed
possession.

In the end, though, it was
Orrange who saved the game
for Stanford. With two min
utes to play, the score was tied
when she drove hard to the
basket to finish with a left
handed layup. UCLA went
down the court and answered
right back, tying the game at
47 and threatening to send
the game to overtime.

After the teams ex
changed baskets, Orrange
waited as the clock ticked
down and took the game into
her own hands, driving to the
hoop and throwing up a circus
shot that went in, giving Stan
ford the lead at 51-49 with just
seven seconds to play.
At the end of the game, the
only thing Orrange remem

bers thinking was, "I want to
win, I want to win, I'll do what
ever it takes. I just looked for
opportunities to take chances
on offense and defense and
luckily it worked out."
"She has had a great tour
nament," VanDerveer said.
"She had more help around
her last year so I think this
was her best game. Amber
put the team on her back to
day and she really went to the
