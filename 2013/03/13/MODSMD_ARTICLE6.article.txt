# CARD BACK ATOP THE PAC
## ORRANGE'S 20 EARN TOP SEED 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
With star junior Chiney Ogwumike
having the lowest scoring game of her
career in Sunday's Pac-12 Champi
onship game, sophomore point guard
Amber Orrange stepped up against No.
14 UCLA to lead the Cardinal to a

thrilling 51-49 victory.
The win earned Stanford its seventh
consecutive tournament title and a
highly desired No. 1 seed for the NCAA
Tournament. The game's aggressive
and down-to-the-wire play simulated
the intensity of March Madness, and
the Cardinal's success in pulling out a
close win in the end proves its ability to
compete at a higher level especially
when Ogwumike was held to just three
points by a tight Brains defense.
Orrange became the saving grace
for the Card, scoring a career-high 20
points and snagging three steals.

The No. 4 Stanford women's basket
ball team is no longer a one-trick pony.
