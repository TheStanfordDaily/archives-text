## Food truck pilot ends with quarter Late-night food trucks, Net Appetit will likely not return 
### SAMANTHA LYNN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the ASSU Executive's winter
quarter food truck pilot program comes
to an end, a lack of student demand
means that late-night food trucks will not
return to campus in the spring. Lunch
tracks, organized by food track manage
ment company Off the Grid, will return
next quarter, while Net Appetit, a popu
lar and long-serving food truck, is unlike
ly to come back.
Net Appetit, owned by the nonprofit
organization Aid to Children Without
Parents and operated at Stanford by
Chon Vo, was originally asked to leave
campus in January because of a new Uni
versity mobile food vendor policy, al
though it subsequently returned in late
February. According to Vo, if he was to
return to campus next quarter, he likely
won't be permitted to continue serving
food in his customary spot on Santa
Teresa Street.
"From my point of view, the track will
probably not be able to come back," Vo
sard. "We cannot keep on fighting."
Net Appetit was ultimately escorted
off campus by the Stanford University
Department of Public Safety (SUDPS)
on March 1 because it continued to vio
late the mobile food vendor policy. Vo
called his current operation an after
noon buffet served in his truck on Santa
Teresa Street "group delivery," while
the University maintains that Net Ap
petit is not delivering to customers indi
vidually and remains illegally parked.
"No food delivery truck is allowed to
park on Santa Teresa for any time longer
than it takes to deliver pre-ordered and
pre-packaged food to nearby offices,"
wrote Assistant Vice President for Busi
ness Development Susan Weinstein '72
MBA '79 in a statement. "This policy was
enforced by campus police."
Bill Larson, SUDPS spokesman, con
firmed that one deputy was dis
patched to Net Appetit at the request
of the University.
Vo may be a veteran in the seman
tics of what constitutes "delivery"
services. After Net Appetit served
lunch at the Cisco parking lot in San
Jose for 12 years, other food trucks
came to the same parking lot and be
gan to block parking spaces. At that
point, Cisco asked all the trucks to
leave. However, Vo won that battle
on the grounds that he was a deliv
ery service.
"We asked Cisco whether we
could do delivery, and they consulted
their law department, and their defi
nition came out that, yeah, actually,
they couldn't do anything about us,"
Vo said. "They agreed that our
method is delivery."
Vo called the University's ac
tions against Net Appetit "an at
tempt to discriminate," citing an
example of people picking up food
from a Domino's Pizza car in front
of the Stanford Humanities Center.
He argued this is the same model
as Net Appetit's group delivery
system.

According to Weinstein, Net Ap
petit is given the same treatment
that all delivery trucks receive.
"Net Appetit is permitted to de
liver food to campus under exactly
the same terms as other delivery
trucks," Weinstein wrote. "A pizza
truck receives an order, prepares
the food off campus, packages the
food in a box off campus and brings
the order to the individual's or
group's office or dorm. The deliv
ery track stops in at campus loca
tion for only five to 10 minutes
just long enough to complete the
delivery. Net Appetit is welcome to
do the same."

Even if Net Appetit operates as
a delivery truck under a definition
on which Vo and the University
agree, the future does not look
bright for Net Appetit's presence
on campus.

"If we do the delivery thing, we
may not survive, because that mod
el is cumbersome," Vo said. "When
Cisco Systems allowed us to do deliv
ery, we lasted about eight months."

Late-night pilot struggles
As Net Appetit looks set to leave
campus, the trial period of late-night
food trucks in the Wilbur and Theta
Delta Chi parking lots will also come
to a close due to a lack of student de
mand and profitability.
"The ASSU did its best to pro
mote evening food truck service to
the campus community, but demand
just wasn't there," Weinstein wrote.
"This week, ASSU and Off the Grid
decided jointly to discontinue week
end evening service."

ASSU President Robbie Zim
broff 'l2 M.A 'l3 expressed satisfac
tion that the option was at least avail
able to students.

"We went through nine weeks,
and they just weren't profitable," he
said. "Will [Wagstaff 'l2, ASSU Vice
President] and I are fine with that.
All we could do was try and make the
option available to students we're
glad we got done what we said we
were going to do."

Lunchtime Off the Grid food
truck service will continue next quar
ter in a testament to its success to
date, according to Weinstein.
'All trucks are meeting their re
quired minimum revenue targets [for
lunch], and sales for certain trucks
are now far exceeding expectations,"
she said.

Although some were upset with
the University's handling of the evic
tion of non-Off the Grid food trucks
such as Net Appetit and Mia's Cater
ing, Weinstein said that the Stanford
community has responded positively
to the food tracks brought in by Off
the Grid.

"I have heard from quite a few
others who are enjoying the new food
tracks," Weinstein wrote. "They like
the variety of having a different truck
on campus each day, and they think
the quality of the food is significantly
improved."
Meanwhile, operators of Off the
Grid-licensed food tracks have high
lighted then* success to date. Sue Al
tamirano, operator of Sanguchon, the
track that parks on Lomita Mall
every Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 2
p.m., said that her experience on
campus has been absolutely positive.
"We do get a lot of people coming
by every week," Altamirano said.
"It's a good sign."

Vo may be a veteran in the seman
tics of what constitutes "delivery"
services. After Net Appetit served
lunch at the Cisco parking lot in San
Jose for 12 years, other food trucks
came to the same parking lot and be
gan to block parking spaces. At that
point, Cisco asked all the trucks to
leave. However, Vo won that battle
on the grounds that he was a deliv
ery service.
"We asked Cisco whether we
could do delivery, and they consulted
their law department, and their defi
nition came out that, yeah, actually,
they couldn't do anything about us,"
Vo said. "They agreed that our
method is delivery."
Vo called the University's ac
tions against Net Appetit "an at
tempt to discriminate," citing an
example of people picking up food
from a Domino's Pizza car in front
of the Stanford Humanities Center.
He argued this is the same model
as Net Appetit's group delivery
system.

According to Weinstein, Net Ap
petit is given the same treatment
that all delivery trucks receive.
"Net Appetit is permitted to de
liver food to campus under exactly
the same terms as other delivery
trucks," Weinstein wrote. "A pizza
truck receives an order, prepares
the food off campus, packages the
food in a box off campus and brings
the order to the individual's or
group's office or dorm. The deliv
ery track stops in at campus loca
tion for only five to 10 minutes
just long enough to complete the
delivery. Net Appetit is welcome to
do the same."

Even if Net Appetit operates as
a delivery truck under a definition
on which Vo and the University
agree, the future does not look
bright for Net Appetit's presence
on campus.

"If we do the delivery thing, we
may not survive, because that mod
el is cumbersome," Vo said. "When
Cisco Systems allowed us to do deliv
ery, we lasted about eight months."

Late-night pilot struggles
As Net Appetit looks set to leave
campus, the trial period of late-night
food trucks in the Wilbur and Theta
Delta Chi parking lots will also come
to a close due to a lack of student de
mand and profitability.
"The ASSU did its best to pro
mote evening food truck service to
the campus community, but demand
just wasn't there," Weinstein wrote.
"This week, ASSU and Off the Grid
decided jointly to discontinue week
end evening service."

ASSU President Robbie Zim
broff 'l2 M.A 'l3 expressed satisfac
tion that the option was at least avail
able to students.

"We went through nine weeks,
and they just weren't profitable," he
said. "Will [Wagstaff 'l2, ASSU Vice
President] and I are fine with that.
All we could do was try and make the
option available to students we're
glad we got done what we said we
were going to do."

Lunchtime Off the Grid food
truck service will continue next quar
ter in a testament to its success to
date, according to Weinstein.
'All trucks are meeting their re
quired minimum revenue targets [for
lunch], and sales for certain trucks
are now far exceeding expectations,"
she said.

Although some were upset with
the University's handling of the evic
tion of non-Off the Grid food trucks
such as Net Appetit and Mia's Cater
ing, Weinstein said that the Stanford
community has responded positively
to the food tracks brought in by Off
the Grid.

"I have heard from quite a few
others who are enjoying the new food
tracks," Weinstein wrote. "They like
the variety of having a different truck
on campus each day, and they think
the quality of the food is significantly
improved."
Meanwhile, operators of Off the
Grid-licensed food tracks have high
lighted then* success to date. Sue Al
tamirano, operator of Sanguchon, the
track that parks on Lomita Mall
every Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 2
p.m., said that her experience on
campus has been absolutely positive.
"We do get a lot of people coming
by every week," Altamirano said.
"It's a good sign."

As the ASSU Executive's winter
quarter food truck pilot program comes
to an end, a lack of student demand
means that late-night food trucks will not
return to campus in the spring. Lunch
tracks, organized by food track manage
ment company Off the Grid, will return
next quarter, while Net Appetit, a popu
lar and long-serving food truck, is unlike
ly to come back.
Net Appetit, owned by the nonprofit
organization Aid to Children Without
Parents and operated at Stanford by
Chon Vo, was originally asked to leave
campus in January because of a new Uni
versity mobile food vendor policy, al
though it subsequently returned in late
February. According to Vo, if he was to
return to campus next quarter, he likely
won't be permitted to continue serving
food in his customary spot on Santa
Teresa Street.
"From my point of view, the track will
probably not be able to come back," Vo
sard. "We cannot keep on fighting."
Net Appetit was ultimately escorted
off campus by the Stanford University
Department of Public Safety (SUDPS)
on March 1 because it continued to vio
late the mobile food vendor policy. Vo
called his current operation an after
noon buffet served in his truck on Santa
Teresa Street "group delivery," while
the University maintains that Net Ap
petit is not delivering to customers indi
vidually and remains illegally parked.
"No food delivery truck is allowed to
park on Santa Teresa for any time longer
than it takes to deliver pre-ordered and
pre-packaged food to nearby offices,"
wrote Assistant Vice President for Busi
ness Development Susan Weinstein '72
MBA '79 in a statement. "This policy was
enforced by campus police."
Bill Larson, SUDPS spokesman, con
firmed that one deputy was dis
patched to Net Appetit at the request
of the University.
