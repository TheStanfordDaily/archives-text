## Food truck pilot ends with quarter Late-night food trucks, Net Appetit will likely not return 
### SAMANTHA LYNN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the ASSU Executive's winter
quarter food truck pilot program comes
to an end, a lack of student demand
means that late-night food trucks will not
return to campus in the spring. Lunch
tracks, organized by food track manage
ment company Off the Grid, will return
next quarter, while Net Appetit, a popu
lar and long-serving food truck, is unlike
ly to come back.
Net Appetit, owned by the nonprofit
organization Aid to Children Without
Parents and operated at Stanford by
Chon Vo, was originally asked to leave
campus in January because of a new Uni

February. According to Vo, if he was to
return to campus next quarter, he likely
won't be permitted to continue serving
food in his customary spot on Santa
Teresa Street.
"From my point of view, the track will
probably not be able to come back," Vo
sard. "We cannot keep on fighting."
Net Appetit was ultimately escorted
off campus by the Stanford University
Department of Public Safety (SUDPS)
on March 1 because it continued to vio
late the mobile food vendor policy. Vo
called his current operation an after
noon buffet served in his truck on Santa
Teresa Street "group delivery," while
the University maintains that Net Ap
petit is not delivering to customers indi

"No food delivery truck is allowed to
park on Santa Teresa for any time longer
than it takes to deliver pre-ordered and
pre-packaged food to nearby offices,"
wrote Assistant Vice President for Busi

MBA '79 in a statement. "This policy was
enforced by campus police."
