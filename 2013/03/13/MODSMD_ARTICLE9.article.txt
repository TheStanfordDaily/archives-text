## Catwalks scheduled for demolition Popular FloMo rooftop feature will be removed this summer 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Starting this summer, the rooftop cat
walks of Florence Moore Hall (FloMo) will
be removed in a change that has prompted
protest from some current residents.
"[The catwalks] are a place for all of us
to hang out in the afternoons and talk," said
Reade Levinson 'l6. "People do yoga, have
conversations, stargaze ... It's one of those
rare gems, like the Lane Reading Room ...
one of those awesome parts of campus that
you're lucky to find."
Rodger Whitney, executive director of
Residential and Dining Enterprises
(R&DE) Student Housing, wrote in a state
ment to The Daily that the walkways "are in
a deteriorated condition, do not meet cur
rent ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act]
accessibility standards, and must be re
moved in order to replace the flat roof."
According to Whitney, strict building
and fire codes restrict such constructions
and no other residence or new building con
tains the kind of walkways currently in
place in Flo Mo.
"R&DE met with us [the Resident Fel
lows (RFs)] and our understanding was that
it wasn't feasible [to retain the catwalks]
from a cost perspective and a county per
spective, since the renovations had to be ap
proved by the county," said Greg Watkins
'B5 Ph.D. 'O3, an East FloMo RF, said.

Watkins lived in FloMo as a freshman
and reflected that while the catwalks
weren't used extensively they did add to
the charm of the building.
"They are an important space, a free
space, an outdoor space," Watkins said.
"They have an important role to play in giv
ing the residents multiple stations to spend
their time in ... They do hold the value of

retreat space that's hard to come by here at
Stanford."
Watkins noted that student reaction to
the catwalks' removal has been limited to
date, attributing that trend to FloMo's
largely freshman population and a corre
sponding lack of investment in dorm tradi
tions and the surge in the catwalks' pop
ularity during spring quarter.
Still, he conceded, some freshmen are
passionate about the issue.
"The movement towards complaining was
started by freshmen," Watkins said. "They
wouldn't go away without investigating."
Levinson, who originated the movement
protesting the removal of the catwalks,
characterized the protest as one of a num
ber of student struggles devoted to pre
serving unique features of the University.
"It would be so sad if other generations
wouldn't be able to keep them," Levinson

said. "The school is on the move to become
more uniform, with Suites Dining and tear
ing down Meyer, and keeping things like the
catwalks is important to keep the school
unique."
"Right now, I'm just gauging interest,"
Levinson added. "If it's just me protesting,
then it's not worth it... I want to see how
many people [are interested in protesting]
before approaching Housing."
According to Whitney, the decision to re
move the catwalks balanced resident pref
erences with safety concerns. He added
that dorms within FloMo will remain con
nected by existing interior walkways.
"With the roof access walkways in place,
some students have climbed out windows to
access them, and there have been some un
fortunate falls and other injury accidents
over the past few years," Whitney wrote.
"Life safety for our students is very impor

tant to us, so any project work we do always
takes this into account."

According to Whitney, R&DE adminis
trators will meet with FloMo residents and
staff in "early spring quarter" to discuss the
details of the renovation.
Levinson said when she first contacted
Watkins for advice on contesting the
changes, she was advised to bring the issue
to the attention of the larger University
community.
"We could find out what Housing thinks,
since they tend to respond once there's an
article, and, given their response, try
fundraising or just put up a last stand,"
Levinson said. "I'm pretty sure it's a done
deal but I don't think they should go out
without a fight."
