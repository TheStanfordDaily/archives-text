The celebrated writer and environmentalist Wallace Stegner founded the Stanford Creative
Writing Program in 1946 with the aim of providing young, talented writers the guidance,
encouragement, and funding to further their writing knowledge and craft.
Over the past sixty years the creative writing program has grown in stature so that it is
widely recognized, and has trained thousands of undergraduates and hundreds of
Stegner Fellows. Join us for this extraordinary program that will bring together:
Eavan Boland, Nancy Packer, Philip Levin, and Scott Turow.
Tuesday, April 2 • 7:30 pm
Cubberley Auditorium, School of Education
