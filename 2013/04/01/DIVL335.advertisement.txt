ENGLISH 132 D Suspense and Fear in Literature:
Digitally Decoding a Literary Effect
This course will use new digital methodologies to explore why certain texts create the feeling of suspense. Does the effect
of tension or fear result from just subject matter, or is there a deeper linguistic pattern that creates this experience for
readers? Reading includes some of the key works of suspense from the last three centuries: books by Walpole, Poe, Doyle,
Collins and Christie along with critical essays that explore their effect on readers. We will also work together to create a new
digital model of the lexical and syntactic features of these works to uncover the reoccurring hidden patterns of language
that help explain why we are affected by literary suspense. No technical experience is necessary. TTh 9-10:50 (Algee-Hewitt)
ENGLISH 148 Family Drama: American Plays about Families
Students in this course will read and analyze plays written by 20th century writers that concentrate on the family as
the primary source of dramatic conflict and comedy. Writers include Williams, O'Neill, Wilder, Albee, Vogel, Parks,
Lindsay-Abaire, and Hwang. TTh 9-10:50 (Phelan)
ENGLISH 153A James Joyce
In this course, students will participate in a close reading of Joyce's works, including Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man, Ulysses, and Finnegans Wake. We will also read Stephen Hero, the abandoned draft of A Portrait, Ciacomo
Joyce, several of Joyce's speeches, letters and poems, and the play Exiles. We'll devote some attention to his biographies,
and also watch clippings from the two film versions of Ulysses: Joseph Strick's Ulysses (1967) and Sean Walsh's Bloom (2004).
We will read some of the classics of Joyce criticism (Wilson, Levin, Lukacs), as well as later, more contemporary approaches
(Jameson, Moretti, Duffy, Gibson, Wicke, Latham, Rubenstein, Walkowitz). MW 2:15-4:05 (Majumdar)
ENGLISH 153J Virginia Woolf: Form, Function, Feminism
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf? Once upon a time, it was Woolf's feminism that made her a scary cultural commodity.
Now, she is the respected grande dame of twentieth-century feminism, author of A Room of One's Own (1929), a founding
feminist treatise of the last century. But what connects Woolf's role as novelist with that of polemicist? Against what cultural
canvas was she working? This course will put Woolf's feminism in historical context, drawing on a range of writers and
rhetorical modes to supplement our study of her novels and essays, and will chart the evolution of her fictional experiments
for what they tell us about the intersection of politics and aesthetics in the modernist period. MW 12:15-2:05 (Staveley)
ENGLISH 1638 The Other Shakespeare
Students in this class will read and discuss of six less familiar Shakespeare plays: Henry IV Part I, Measure for Measure, King
Lear, Antony and Cleopatra, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest. Material covered will include dramatic and poetic
analysis, cultural and social history, stage history, and performance. MW 11-12:30 (Orgel)
ENGLISH 175 C Natives, Immigrants, and Pioneers:
The Culture and Politics of the American Landscape
This course will examine a wide range of American engagements with nature: as a determinant of national character
and destiny, as a source of spiritual and moral revitalization, as a battleground for the survival of races and ethnicities, as
a molding mechanism of citizenship, as the basis of a national art and culture, and as a resource for exploitation or
preservation. MW 1:15-3:05 (Spingarn)
