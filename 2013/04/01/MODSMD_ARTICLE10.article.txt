## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN ASSU Elections and the Stanford Student Freedom Project 
### Miles Unterreiner 
As ASSU elections season
gears up for action over the
next two weeks, the coalition
of students concerned about this
year's Suites decision has formed
into a new student group: the Stan
ford Student Freedom Project
(SSFP).

SSFP will be endorsing candi
dates for ASSU office this year
who share the group's core mis
sion: improving the quality, fre
quency and transparency of com
munication between Residential
Education (ResEd) and Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises
(R&DE) administrators and stu
dents; strengthening student voic
es in decisions that concern resi
dential life; protecting the jobs and
wages of the residential and dining
workers who make students' expe
rience here what it is; and preserv
ing student residential independ
ence. We hope that by establishing
clear, substantive and continuous
lines of communication between
students and residential adminis
tration, we can help avoid future
catastrophes like this year's battle
over Suites Dining.
As negotiations continue (and
look very promising) about the fu
ture of Suites Dining, it's become
clear that ResEd administrators
aren't bad people bent on the utter
destruction of student life. They
are simply people like you and me,
doing their jobs as best they can
but operating within a larger, Stan
ford-wide institutional framework,
largely put into place over the last
five years, whose key values tend
to run counter to many students'
wishes.

This larger administrative
framework prioritizes risk man
agement over the educational value
of letting students make mistakes
and learn from them; emphasizes
cost-efficiency and economies of
scale over student autonomy and
small-scale food production; tends
to standardize the University expe
rience at the expense of the weird
and unusual places that make
Stanford student life unique; fears
potential lawsuits more than it

does the gradual erosion of stu
dent-run enterprises and resi
dences; and worries about what
could go wrong more than it cele
brates what is already going right.
ResEd acts as the public voice, but
not the architect, of this frame
work, and Suites is far from the on
ly instance of decisions made ac
cording to its metrics.
The members of the newly
formed SSFP understand that. We
simply hope that as this great Uni
versity moves forward into a new
era of all-time-high fundraising
records and all-time-low admis
sions percentages, we as students
can help make a constructive case
for the educational and formative
value of student freedom on cam
pus.

Stanford in the classroom, on
the athletic field, in the lab or
workshop aims to create indi
viduals who stand out, who lead
their fields, who break new ground.
The University aims to shape
minds whose research pushes back
boundaries, who refuse to accept
the adequacy of the status quo,
who speak up when injustices af
fect the people around us and who
take the hard path of leadership
rather than blend quietly into the
crowd and, as Leland and Jane
Stanford put it, "grapple success
fully with the practicalities of life."
In short, Stanford, apparently
in every area except residential
life, is all about taking big risks
that might not pay off, thinking
outside the existing box and not be
ing afraid to fail. This University
was founded by a man who invest
ed with no guarantee of success
and risked everything to build a
school that looked and acted differ
ently from any other.

The members of SSFP
think that this admirable
mission can be furthered
and enhanced by a residen
tial experience that lets stu
dents take the lead in man
aging their own lives; gives
them the latitude to explore
modes of living outside tra
ditional dorm life; acquaints
them with the practical dif
ficulties of managing a
budget, filing paperwork
and scrubbing floors; asks
students practical ethical
questions like "Are you will
ing to pay a little more on
your board bill if it means
your chefs have the oppor
tunity to keep their jobs and
earn a higher wage?"; and
allows students a voice in
the decisions that affect
them.
We are hopeful that stu

dents can work with, rather
than against, ResEd and
R&DE in fulfilling this mis
sion and that these can be
goals we all share. If this
last month's negotiations
are any indication, we
should be hopeful about
that.
I'll have more specifics
for you about SSFP's plat
form and policy positions in
next Monday's paper. Until
then, we'll be working hard
to endorse candidates for
next week's ASSU elec
tions: one President/Vice-
President Executive slate, a
maximum of 10 Senate can
didates and one class presi
dent slate per class that
best demonstrate the ability
to keep student life inde
pendent and our workers
treated well. We look for
ward to working with those
candidates!
