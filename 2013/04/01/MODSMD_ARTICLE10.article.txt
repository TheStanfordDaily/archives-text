## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN ASSU Elections and the Stanford Student Freedom Project 
### Miles Unterreiner 
As ASSU elections season
gears up for action over the
next two weeks, the coalition
of students concerned about this
year's Suites decision has formed
into a new student group: the Stan
ford Student Freedom Project
(SSFP).

SSFP will be endorsing candi
dates for ASSU office this year
who share the group's core mis
sion: improving the quality, fre
quency and transparency of com
munication between Residential
Education (ResEd) and Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises
(R&DE) administrators and stu
dents; strengthening student voic
es in decisions that concern resi
dential life; protecting the jobs and
wages of the residential and dining
workers who make students' expe
rience here what it is; and preserv
ing student residential independ
ence. We hope that by establishing
clear, substantive and continuous
lines of communication between
students and residential adminis
tration, we can help avoid future
catastrophes like this year's battle
over Suites Dining.
As negotiations continue (and
look very promising) about the fu
ture of Suites Dining, it's become
clear that ResEd administrators
aren't bad people bent on the utter
destruction of student life. They
are simply people like you and me,
doing their jobs as best they can
but operating within a larger, Stan
ford-wide institutional framework,
largely put into place over the last
five years, whose key values tend
to run counter to many students'
wishes.

This larger administrative
framework prioritizes risk man
agement over the educational value
of letting students make mistakes
and learn from them; emphasizes
cost-efficiency and economies of
scale over student autonomy and
small-scale food production; tends
to standardize the University expe
rience at the expense of the weird
and unusual places that make
Stanford student life unique; fears
potential lawsuits more than it

does the gradual erosion of stu
dent-run enterprises and resi
dences; and worries about what
could go wrong more than it cele
brates what is already going right.
ResEd acts as the public voice, but
not the architect, of this frame
work, and Suites is far from the on
ly instance of decisions made ac
cording to its metrics.
The members of the newly
formed SSFP understand that. We
simply hope that as this great Uni
versity moves forward into a new
era of all-time-high fundraising
records and all-time-low admis
sions percentages, we as students
can help make a constructive case
for the educational and formative
value of student freedom on cam
pus.

Stanford in the classroom, on
the athletic field, in the lab or
workshop aims to create indi
viduals who stand out, who lead
their fields, who break new ground.
The University aims to shape
minds whose research pushes back
boundaries, who refuse to accept
the adequacy of the status quo,
who speak up when injustices af
fect the people around us and who
take the hard path of leadership
rather than blend quietly into the
crowd and, as Leland and Jane
Stanford put it, "grapple success
fully with the practicalities of life."
In short, Stanford, apparently
in every area except residential
life, is all about taking big risks
that might not pay off, thinking
outside the existing box and not be
ing afraid to fail. This University
was founded by a man who invest
ed with no guarantee of success
and risked everything to build a
school that looked and acted differ
ently from any other.
