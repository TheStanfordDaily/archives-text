# THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## The 						Wind of Freedom Wanes 
### Adam Johnson 
Freedom is why I came to
Stanford. Yes, the academics
are top notch, and the cam
pus is stunning. But going into Ad
mit Weekend, I wasn't sure I'd fit
in. My doubts soon disappeared: I
saw students kicking back in the
Claw; condoms tossed up in the air
during the activities fair; the band
jamming around MemAud foun
tain; a student walking into an me
chanical engineering class wearing
pajamas, turning in his PSET and
turning right back around out the
door; my (underage) RoHo having
a shelf stacked with hard liquor and
one of the gates from an RF park
ing space displayed proudly on the
wall.

I loved it. The "I'll do whatever
the fuck I want" spirit and a faculty
and staff that, from all appear
ances, embraced it. Not to say I
was, or am, a rebel. But what I saw
was a place where students could,
amid all the work, explore and ex
press themselves as they saw fit.
Where the future politicians and
doctors and entrepreneurs of to
morrow could fuck around today.
Now? This campus seems more sti
fling with every passing week.
Off the top of my head, here's a
list of notable student freedoms
eliminated in the four years I have
been here: alcohol in row houses
can no longer be bought with social
dues, campus police have cracked
down on bike lights, the Nomad
party is no more, XOX lost its lease,
hard liquor was prohibited during
summer session, the band has been
under alcohol suspension, student
run eating clubs have vanished, a
nonprofit food truck has been twice
kicked off campus, double-booked
schedules will soon be forbidden
and probably a gazillion other
things I don't know about. And just
the other night, residents from
Columbae were prevented by po
lice from streaking through Green
Library. A harmless activity, halted
by armed authorities at the request
of University staff. Good grief!

The sad thing is, student free
doms have long been targeted by
the powers that be. There may be
an outcry, but when these students
graduate, the struggles that once
were are soon forgotten. What was
once inconceivable becomes the
norm. Give the administration 20
more years along this trajectory,
and I can only wonder what the uni
versity that I hold dear will be
come.

Why? Why does the university
continue to worship order and con
formity, even if just to uphold an in
consequential food truck policy?
Efficiency is likely one justifica
tion. In theory, the more uniform
Stanford is, the cheaper it can be
run. So all walls are painted the
same off-white color, all Row din
ing services are contracted to the
same vendor, all staff are hired
through ResEd, all food trucks op
erate through Off the Grid. But
maintaining uniformity requires
considerable overhead, a fact that
seems to be lost on members of
this administration. Judging by
ever-increasing tuition and room
and board, operations were un
doubtedly far cheaper years ago
than they are today. I wonder,
though, if the product we receive
now is that much, if at all, superior
to what alumni received during
their time here.
Another oft-cited reason for re
ducing student freedoms is safety;
freedom means students are free to
take risks, risks can lead to damage
and damage can lead to bad public
ity and lawsuits. If we want to be
safe, then, freedoms must be sacri
ficed.

Yet as Benjamin Franklin so
wisely said, "He who sacrifices
freedom for security deserves nei
ther." Or, as I often note, the safest
society is one in which everyone is
locked in a private jail cell with
padded walls.
In the spirit of full disclosure,
I'll say it right now: I'm
guilty of this safety-first
mindset too. Last year as a
freshman RA, I probably sti
fled my residents' freedom
one too many times in the
name of preventing alcohol
poisoning. It's what I was
told to do. It's what I was
told was best for the fresh
man. My experiences as an
RA then are why I don't
blame individual administra
tors for their actions now.
I've interacted with some of
them and generally have had
positive impressions. I just
think they're caught in a sys
tem that has lost sight of
what is truly important.
All this safety and effi
ciency talk, I'm damn tired
of it. The safer we are, the
less free we are to explore
and take risks. The more effi
cient (read: uniform) this
campus is, the less opportuni
ty for free expression. While
these complaints may seem
inconsequential, remember
that the values students have
now are the ones that will
carry the day tomorrow.
While freedom may just
be a buzzword to you, to me
it means much more. Free
dom is when other people
trust me to not fuck up and
drive off a cliff. It is the op
portunity for me to lose my
self, find myself, explore my
self, express myself and en
gage myself, then lose my

self all over again. I may not
come out clean and fresh,
but I sure as hell enjoyed the
ride and probably learned a
few things along the way.
Stanford University,
please to God remember
your motto: Die Luft der
Freiheit weht the wind of
freedom blows.
Two weeks ago we
marked the end of winter.
Oh, powers that be, it's high
time to do some spring
cleaning and throw out the
fetters that prevent us stu

dents from running naked
through libraries, running
our residential experiences
and running our lives. While
you're at it, might I suggest
you pull out the Oxi-Clean,
grab a rag and scrub off the
grime that presently ob
scures the first three words
of our sacred motto. It's
been in want of a good wash
ing for years now.
