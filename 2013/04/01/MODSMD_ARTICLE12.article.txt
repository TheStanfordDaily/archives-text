# NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND
## So, How Was Cape Town? Part 1 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
This is the first in a series of reflec
tions on my time studying in
Cape Town, South Africa.

On my final day of my service
placement in Cape Town, my branch
coordinator took us on a walking
tour of the neighborhood and adja
cent settlements. While I had felt
comfortable enough to walk on my
own from the office to the mall two
minutes away, I had not ventured be
yond this developed area to walk
past some of the shacks and the busi
nesses being ran outside its bound
aries.

In fact, I had not noticed how
many businesses and the variety of
goods and services they offered
that were in these shacks that we
drove past every Wednesday and
Thursday. In the van ride to and
from the placement, I had been
careful to simply look straight
ahead ever since uncomfortably
feeling my tourist gaze during our
community orientation tour at the be
ginning of the quarter. And whenever
I walked down the street to the mall
area, I similarly avoided eye contact.
Most times when I was surrounded
predominately by black South
Africans, I also averted my gaze.
I was aware that being black
means that I was not automatically
seen as an American "other" by
black South Africans and this
means that I do not necessarily
have the identity of "wealthy" or
"tourist" or "volunteer" projected
onto me. Though I knew I was an
outsider and though my hair cer
tainly made me stand out as "not
from Khayelitsha," people identi
fied me as "South African, but not
from the Western Cape," "African,
but not South African" and "West
African" sometimes even after I
spoke.

So though I could relax my sen

sitivity about projecting the tourist
gaze onto others (when I traveled
on my own or with other black stu
dents from our program, as op
posed to riding through townships
on our coach bus or moving in
mixed-race groups), I still averted
eye contact.
During our communities tour, I
smiled, nodded and said hello to a
parent sitting in the entrance to a
specialized high school that we visit
ed in Khayelitsha. She did not
smile, nod back or say anything; she
simply gave me a look that I inter
preted to be one of disdain, in the
context of our large, loud, American
group streaming past her. Once I
learned the word "molo" a few days
later, I'd wondered if her response
would have been any different had I
addressed her in her own language.
But that experience made me hy
persensitive to how black South
Africans might perceive and re
spond to me during my trip.
Moving forward, I need to devel
op a better way of engaging with
the communities I encounter in my
service, in my learning and in my
service learning. Given my interna
tionalist interest in struggles for
justice, I will, more likely than not,
be an "other" in the places I work. I
will need to get over this feeling of
"I am an 'other,' therefore I am dis
dained or perceived as 'less than' by
the community." I also need to be
come more secure with how my
identity and various privileges
change based on where I am. In
other words, I either need to be
come comfortable being "black, but
not African," or, as a fellow student
came to accept, embrace being
"African in spite of slavery."

I also need to be more honest
about my class privilege in either of
these contexts. I'm used to being

home and having "less than" the
peers around me and used to not be
ing able to do things (like fly to
South Africa or pay for a Stanford
education) without significant finan
cial assistance.

Here, though and especially
in the context of my tutoring I
definitively came from a "more
than" background in relation to
most of the learners around me. I
think my insecurity around black
ness and Africanness during these
ten weeks was less based on not be
ing Xhosa or not being African and
more based on not being able to
identify with learners and others
around me solely along lines of
shared racial oppression. My rela
tive class privilege meant that the
oppression they might experience
looked much different than mine.

This difference, however, did not
necessitate that I had to keep a qui
et, shy, low profile. At home, I am
better at engaging with people from
all spectrums and background
just through making frequent and
genuine personal contact. Though I
feared the language and culture
barriers made this more difficult in
South Africa, I should have tried
anyway. And I can still make a bet
ter effort on Stanford's campus,
where I sometimes shy away from
dining or janitorial staff due to dis
comfort around the differences in
our resources and experiences. Ac
knowledging my relative class com
fort and privilege at home will help
me more authentically and meaning
fully engage with those around me.

Next iveek, Kristian will discuss
hoiv his perceptions of global citizen
ship, social act ion and critical reflec
tion have changed as a result of his
experiences in South Africa. Contact,

I walked down the street to the mall
area, I similarly avoided eye contact.
Most times when I was surrounded
predominately by black South
Africans, I also averted my gaze.
I was aware that being black
means that I was not automatically
seen as an American "other" by
black South Africans and this
means that I do not necessarily
have the identity of "wealthy" or
"tourist" or "volunteer" projected
onto me. Though I knew I was an
outsider and though my hair cer
tainly made me stand out as "not
from Khayelitsha," people identi
fied me as "South African, but not
from the Western Cape," "African,
but not South African" and "West
African" sometimes even after I
spoke.

So though I could relax my sen

sitivity about projecting the tourist
gaze onto others (when I traveled
on my own or with other black stu
dents from our program, as op
posed to riding through townships
on our coach bus or moving in
mixed-race groups), I still averted
eye contact.
During our communities tour, I
smiled, nodded and said hello to a
parent sitting in the entrance to a
specialized high school that we visit
ed in Khayelitsha. She did not
smile, nod back or say anything; she
simply gave me a look that I inter
preted to be one of disdain, in the
context of our large, loud, American
group streaming past her. Once I
learned the word "molo" a few days
later, I'd wondered if her response
would have been any different had I
addressed her in her own language.
But that experience made me hy
persensitive to how black South
Africans might perceive and re
spond to me during my trip.
Moving forward, I need to devel
op a better way of engaging with
the communities I encounter in my
service, in my learning and in my
service learning. Given my interna
tionalist interest in struggles for
justice, I will, more likely than not,
be an "other" in the places I work. I
will need to get over this feeling of
"I am an 'other,' therefore I am dis
dained or perceived as 'less than' by
the community." I also need to be
come more secure with how my
identity and various privileges
change based on where I am. In
other words, I either need to be
come comfortable being "black, but
not African," or, as a fellow student
came to accept, embrace being
"African in spite of slavery."

I also need to be more honest
about my class privilege in either of
these contexts. I'm used to being

home and having "less than" the
peers around me and used to not be
ing able to do things (like fly to
South Africa or pay for a Stanford
education) without significant finan
cial assistance.

Here, though and especially
in the context of my tutoring I
definitively came from a "more
than" background in relation to
most of the learners around me. I
think my insecurity around black
ness and Africanness during these
ten weeks was less based on not be
ing Xhosa or not being African and
more based on not being able to
identify with learners and others
around me solely along lines of
shared racial oppression. My rela
tive class privilege meant that the
oppression they might experience
looked much different than mine.

This difference, however, did not
necessitate that I had to keep a qui
et, shy, low profile. At home, I am
better at engaging with people from
all spectrums and background
just through making frequent and
genuine personal contact. Though I
feared the language and culture
barriers made this more difficult in
South Africa, I should have tried
anyway. And I can still make a bet
ter effort on Stanford's campus,
where I sometimes shy away from
dining or janitorial staff due to dis
comfort around the differences in
our resources and experiences. Ac
knowledging my relative class com
fort and privilege at home will help
me more authentically and meaning
fully engage with those around me.

hoiv his perceptions of global citizen
ship, social act ion and critical reflec
tion have changed as a result of his
experiences in South Africa. Contact,
