## Increased Faculty Diversity Benefits All Students 
### 
Stanford is known for its diverse
student population, and the
numbers show that students
come from a variety of ethnic back
grounds: roughly 50 percent of the
student body self-identify as people
of color. There is a history of student
activists fighting for the creation of
community centers, ethnic studies
programs and community resources
a legacy that continues today. But
what is Stanford University as an in
stitution doing to show it cares about
diversity within the academy?
Yes, we see our diverse identities
reflected in the syllabi in many of our
courses, but we do not often see
these identities reflected in the pro
fessors teaching those courses. Ac
cording to 2010 data from the Diver
sity and Access Office, only 25 per
cent of professors are women, com
pared to 48 percent of undergradu
ates. A staggering 79 percent of fac
ulty are white, compared to 35 per
cent of undergraduates.
This severe underrepresentation
of women and people of color is trou
bling, and efforts should be made to
correct this discrepancy. We should
also consider the possibility of facul
ty diversity beyond the current
quantified identities: an increase in
the amount of LGBTQ-identified
professors, professors with disabili
ties and other populations underrep
resented in academia.

Research conducted by scholars
like Sylvia Hurtado demonstrate
that a diverse faculty and curricula
are essential to improving the educa
tional experience for all students,
particularly students of color. These

faculty can provide mentorship and
intellectual opportunities to ensure
that all of Stanford's students can
succeed in this intense academic and
social environment.
The lack of faculty diversity is not
a new concern on campus stu
dents have been advocating for in
creased faculty diversity since be
fore the Black Student Union "took
the mic" from the University
Provost and issued their list of de
mands in 1968. However, a recent in
cident involving a visiting professor
has given us reason to remind the
campus community that diversity of
faculty continues to be a pressing
problem. And it serves as an oppor
tunity to reflect on the ways in which
this issue is about more than just
representation and mentorship.
An article by Stanford's Joel
Brinkley, a Hearst Visiting Profes
sional in the Department of Commu
nication, illuminated the problems
that occur when an institution of
higher education offers a diversity of
class subjects without an accompa
nying diversity of professors. In his
article, Professor Brinkley demon
strated his lack of knowledge about
the lived experience of Southeast
Asian students, using his intellectual
position to demean the region's peo
ples without considering how his ar
gument might be offensive and
harmful to many Asians around the
world, let alone the Asian American
students on this campus. He de
scribed Vietnamese people as "ag
gressive" and "gruesome" con
sumers of dog meat, a supposed con
tradiction to the economic success of

the country.
The problematic portrayal of
Vietnamese people in Brinkley's ar
ticle demonstrates the need for more
education about Southeast Asian his
tory, culture and issues and the need
for faculty from those particular
backgrounds who can foster a deep
er, more holistic understanding of
ethnic and cultural differences
among students.
There are currently very few
professors who study or teach about
ethnic and cultural identities. Those
who do are highly valued on this
campus, but we still have very few
professors who can sufficiently un
derstand a culture and communities'
complexities and intricacies through
their own lived experiences and per
spectives. The recent incident with
Professor Brinkley serves as a re
minder of the importance of enhanc
ing faculty diversity at Stanford. It is
not simply a matter of what material
is taught, but who is teaching it.
As was reported in The Daily
three weeks ago, the undergraduate
representatives of the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center (A3C) Adviso
ry Board created a survey to gauge
the academic and research interests
of Stanford students to inform the
Board's advocacy efforts. This is a
move in the right direction, but the
Stanford community as a whole
must demand a faculty as diverse as
the student body itself.
