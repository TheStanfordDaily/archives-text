## APPEL, CARD TAKE COUGARS 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Senior stalling pitcher Mark Appel was master
ful once again as the Cardinal rode its ace for one win
and its bats for another, falling just short of a sweep
en route to a 2-1 series victory on the road at Wash
ington State this weekend.

Stanford (13-9,3-3 Pac-12) continued its struggles
at the plate Thursday night, but another complete
game from Appel (4-2), his third of the season, was
enough for a Cardinal victory over the Cougars (16-
10,3-3 Pac-12) in the series opener.
Since opening the season with a shaky perform
ance at Rice, Appel has been close to perfect. On
Thursday, Appel struck out 10 while allowing only
four hits and a walk in a 3-0 victory. It was the fifth
straight start where Appel reached double-digit
strikeouts.
In those five starts since Rice, Appel has been
nothing short of dominant. The big righty has aver

aged over 12 strikeouts per outing and maintained a
stingy ERA of 0.64.
Stanford's bats did all of their damage in the sec
ond inning off the Cougars' stalling pitcher Joe Pis
torese (3-2). The left-handed sophomore allowed
three runs—two earned on three hits and two er
rors in the second frame.
Sophomore third baseman Alex Blandino got the
rally stalled with a one-out double down the left field
line. The Card then loaded the bases with a walk and
a single to bring up junior first baseman Brian Ragi
ra. Ragira, who finished 34 with a walk while batting
in the leadoff spot in a shaken-up Stanford batting or
der, delivered a two-RBI single up the middle to give
Appel all the run support he would need to seal the
victory.
Pistorese buckled down after allowing one more
unearned run in the inning to fall behind 3-0, holding
Stanford scoreless the rest of the way en route to a
complete-game loss.
In the second game of the series Friday evening,
Stanford's hitters finally picked up the slack for an of
fensive outburst to clinch the series with a 9-3 win.
After being held hitless through four innings by
Cougar starter Tanner Chleborad (34), the Cardinal

five-hit fifth inning.
Senior left fielder Justin
Ringo, Blandino and junior sec

Diekroeger all singled to load
the bases with nobody out.
Sophomore center fielder Do

run with a sacrifice fly to right
before junior shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila doubled the lead with
an RBI single.
Stanford did leave some
potential runs on the board
that, at least for a few innings,
looked like they could haunt
them. After junior catcher
Brant Whiting singled to load
the bases with only one out and
two runs already in, Ragira
grounded into a double play to
end the threat.
The Cougars capitalized off
the momentum of the double
play to give the Cardinal a
scare. Washington State put
up three inns in the bottom of
the fifth off freshman stalling

pitcher Bobby Zarubin and
senior reliever Dean McArdle,
who took over after Zarubin
hit the first batter of the in
ning, to take a 3-2 lead.
But the Cardinal fought
right back, tying the game
with one run in the sixth and
taking the lead back for good
with two in the seventh.
Senior left-handed pitcher
Garrett Hughes and junior
righty A. J. Vanegas closed out
the game in relief of the win
ning pitcher McArdle (2-1)
with a combined five strikeouts
in 2.2 scoreless innings. Vane
gas picked up his first save of
the season in only his second
appearance since returning
from offseason back surgery
last week in Stanford's loss to
UC-Davis.
On Saturday, Stanford
came within nine outs of a se
ries sweep. The Cardinal over
came a 4-1 deficit from fresh
man starting pitcher Marcus
Brakeman's tough outing
seven runs in 3.2 innings in his
first career start—to take the
lead 54 in the top of the sev
enth on an RBI single by
Ringo.
But the Cougars fought
back to earn the win and sal

vage the series with two inns
one earned —in the sev
enth and two more in the
eighth. Freshman pitcher Lo
gan James (0-2) took the loss by
allowing the two runs in the
seventh while Hughes and jun
ior relief pitcher Sam Lindquist
yielded one insurance run each
in one inning of relief.
The late runs allowed
squandered another solid day
from Stanford's hitters. Sopho
more right fielder Austin
Slater led the charge going 3-5
with three RBIs and a run
scored. The sophomore has
been great filling in for the in
jured junior Austin Wilson in
right field. Slater is currently
second on the team with a .325
batting average and third with
11 RBIs.

play to give the Cardinal a
scare. Washington State put
up three inns in the bottom of
the fifth off freshman stalling

pitcher Bobby Zarubin and
senior reliever Dean McArdle,
who took over after Zarubin
hit the first batter of the in
ning, to take a 3-2 lead.
But the Cardinal fought
right back, tying the game
with one run in the sixth and
taking the lead back for good
with two in the seventh.
Senior left-handed pitcher
Garrett Hughes and junior
righty A. J. Vanegas closed out
the game in relief of the win
ning pitcher McArdle (2-1)
with a combined five strikeouts
in 2.2 scoreless innings. Vane
gas picked up his first save of
the season in only his second
appearance since returning
from offseason back surgery
last week in Stanford's loss to
UC-Davis.
On Saturday, Stanford
came within nine outs of a se
ries sweep. The Cardinal over
came a 4-1 deficit from fresh
man starting pitcher Marcus
Brakeman's tough outing
seven runs in 3.2 innings in his
first career start—to take the
lead 54 in the top of the sev
enth on an RBI single by
Ringo.
But the Cougars fought
back to earn the win and sal

vage the series with two inns
one earned —in the sev
enth and two more in the
eighth. Freshman pitcher Lo
gan James (0-2) took the loss by
allowing the two runs in the
seventh while Hughes and jun
ior relief pitcher Sam Lindquist
yielded one insurance run each
in one inning of relief.
The late runs allowed
squandered another solid day
from Stanford's hitters. Sopho
more right fielder Austin
Slater led the charge going 3-5
with three RBIs and a run
scored. The sophomore has
been great filling in for the in
jured junior Austin Wilson in
right field. Slater is currently
second on the team with a .325
batting average and third with
11 RBIs.

Senior stalling pitcher Mark Appel was master
ful once again as the Cardinal rode its ace for one win
and its bats for another, falling just short of a sweep
en route to a 2-1 series victory on the road at Wash
ington State this weekend.

Stanford (13-9,3-3 Pac-12) continued its struggles
at the plate Thursday night, but another complete
game from Appel (4-2), his third of the season, was
enough for a Cardinal victory over the Cougars (16-
10,3-3 Pac-12) in the series opener.
Since opening the season with a shaky perform
ance at Rice, Appel has been close to perfect. On
Thursday, Appel struck out 10 while allowing only
four hits and a walk in a 3-0 victory. It was the fifth
straight start where Appel reached double-digit
strikeouts.
In those five starts since Rice, Appel has been
nothing short of dominant. The big righty has aver

aged over 12 strikeouts per outing and maintained a
stingy ERA of 0.64.
Stanford's bats did all of their damage in the sec
ond inning off the Cougars' stalling pitcher Joe Pis
torese (3-2). The left-handed sophomore allowed
three runs—two earned on three hits and two er
rors in the second frame.
Sophomore third baseman Alex Blandino got the
rally stalled with a one-out double down the left field
line. The Card then loaded the bases with a walk and
a single to bring up junior first baseman Brian Ragi
ra. Ragira, who finished 34 with a walk while batting
in the leadoff spot in a shaken-up Stanford batting or
der, delivered a two-RBI single up the middle to give
Appel all the run support he would need to seal the
victory.
Pistorese buckled down after allowing one more
unearned run in the inning to fall behind 3-0, holding
Stanford scoreless the rest of the way en route to a
complete-game loss.
In the second game of the series Friday evening,
Stanford's hitters finally picked up the slack for an of
fensive outburst to clinch the series with a 9-3 win.

Cougar starter Tanner Chleborad (34), the Cardinal

jumped out to a 2-0 lead with a
five-hit fifth inning.
Senior left fielder Justin
Ringo, Blandino and junior sec
ond baseman Danny
Diekroeger all singled to load
the bases with nobody out.
Sophomore center fielder Do
minic Jose knocked in the first
run with a sacrifice fly to right
before junior shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila doubled the lead with
an RBI single.
Stanford did leave some
potential runs on the board
that, at least for a few innings,
looked like they could haunt
them. After junior catcher
Brant Whiting singled to load
the bases with only one out and
two runs already in, Ragira
grounded into a double play to
end the threat.
The Cougars capitalized off
the momentum of the double
play to give the Cardinal a
scare. Washington State put

the fifth off freshman stalling

pitcher Bobby Zarubin and
senior reliever Dean McArdle,
