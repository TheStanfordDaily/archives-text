## APPEL, CARD TAKE COUGARS 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Senior stalling pitcher Mark Appel was master
ful once again as the Cardinal rode its ace for one win
and its bats for another, falling just short of a sweep
en route to a 2-1 series victory on the road at Wash
ington State this weekend.

Stanford (13-9,3-3 Pac-12) continued its struggles
at the plate Thursday night, but another complete
game from Appel (4-2), his third of the season, was
enough for a Cardinal victory over the Cougars (16-
10,3-3 Pac-12) in the series opener.
Since opening the season with a shaky perform
ance at Rice, Appel has been close to perfect. On
Thursday, Appel struck out 10 while allowing only
four hits and a walk in a 3-0 victory. It was the fifth
straight start where Appel reached double-digit
strikeouts.
In those five starts since Rice, Appel has been
nothing short of dominant. The big righty has aver

aged over 12 strikeouts per outing and maintained a
stingy ERA of 0.64.
Stanford's bats did all of their damage in the sec
ond inning off the Cougars' stalling pitcher Joe Pis
torese (3-2). The left-handed sophomore allowed
three runsâ€”two earned on three hits and two er
rors in the second frame.
Sophomore third baseman Alex Blandino got the
rally stalled with a one-out double down the left field
line. The Card then loaded the bases with a walk and
a single to bring up junior first baseman Brian Ragi
ra. Ragira, who finished 34 with a walk while batting
in the leadoff spot in a shaken-up Stanford batting or
der, delivered a two-RBI single up the middle to give
Appel all the run support he would need to seal the
victory.
Pistorese buckled down after allowing one more
unearned run in the inning to fall behind 3-0, holding
Stanford scoreless the rest of the way en route to a
complete-game loss.
In the second game of the series Friday evening,
Stanford's hitters finally picked up the slack for an of
fensive outburst to clinch the series with a 9-3 win.
