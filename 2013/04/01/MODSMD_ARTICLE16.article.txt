## Nolan, Ipsen bring home NCAA titles Two relay DQs set back men's team to seventh 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
The men's swimming and diving team
suffered a somewhat disappointing end to
the season last weekend, as it finished out
side of the top four in the NCAA Champi
onship meet for the first time in over two
decades.
After also losing its monopoly on the
Pac-12 title after a 31-year reign, the Car
dinal undoubtedly had a down year in
competition. However, stellar individual
performances from younger members of
the team over the course of the NCAA
Championship give the Cardinal strong
hope that it will be back with renewed
strength next year.
During the summer of 2010, more than
20 Division I schools from all around the
nation struggled against each other to re
cruit a rising senior out of Hershey, Penn.,
named David Nolan.
After the dust cleared, Nolan had cho
sen Stanford from the enormous pool of
colleges that coveted his talent. During
the 2011 high school season, Nolan then
promptly shattered the national high
school record in the 200-yard individual
medley (IM).
Two years later, Nolan once again
found himself atop the standings in the
200 IM, except this time it was at the col
legiate level. With a winning time of
1:41:21, the sophomore gave Stanford its
first national title of the 2013 NCAA
Championships, swimming an incredibly
powerful freestyle leg to overtake Flori
da's Marcin Cieslak in the final leg of the
race after trailing for the first three legs.
However, Nolan wasn't satisfied with
just one national title. The very next day,
he claimed a second title, this one coming
in the 100-yard backstroke. Nolan got off
to a strong start and held a solid 0.3-sec
ond lead after the 50-yard split. He never
lost pace in the second half, holding off Cal
senior Tom Shields to claim his second na
tional title of the meet.
In the diving meets of the champi
onships, fellow sophomore Kristian Ipsen,
who spearheaded Stanford's strong diving
corps with two national title performances
of his own over the course of the champi
onship meet, matched Nolan's strong
showing.
The Olympic gold medal
ist almost swept the diving
events of the meet, claiming
the titles in both the 1-meter
and 3-meter events and
falling just short in the plat
form diving event as he fin
ished as runner-up to Duke
junior Nick McCrory.
Ipsen and McCrory bat
tled back and forth through
out the whole meet, as they
combined for first- and sec
ond-place finishes in all
three diving events. In the 1-
meter event, Ipsen finished
in first in the preliminaries
to qualify for the finals, in
which he claimed a solid vic
tory over McCrory by a
margin of almost 40 points.
The 3-meter final, however,
was decided by a much clos
er margin, as Ipsen only fin
ished 10 points ahead of Mc-
Crory to claim his second ti
tle.

Stanford's team standing
was greatly hurt by two dis
qualifications in relays. After
it was rendered ineligible to
compete in the finals of the
400-yard medley relay due
to a disqualification in the
preliminaries, it was also dis
qualified from the finals of
the 200-yard event. The lat
ter disqualification especial
ly hurt, as the team had fin
ished in third place in the
preliminaries and had swum
a strong time in the finals al
ready before learning that
they had been disqualified
for an early takeoff.
Stanford's team ultimate
ly scored 282 points, finish
ing almost 200 points behind
Michigan, the eventual vic
tors. The differences be
tween the scores of the top
three teams, Michigan, Cal

and Arizona, was very large,
indicating that the Michigan
swimmers consistently fin
ished in the top of many
events across the board.
With continued contribu
tions from young swimmers
and divers like Nolan and
Ipsen, Stanford hopes to re
turn to national title con
tention next year and into
the future. Stanford has the
ability to consistently swim
strong relays and has power
ful individual swimmers that
can swim with the best in the
country. Next year, the Car
dinal will attempt to pull it
all together and once again
return to its perch atop the
Pac-12 and in the top three
in the country.

tled back and forth through
out the whole meet, as they
combined for first- and sec
ond-place finishes in all
three diving events. In the 1-
meter event, Ipsen finished
in first in the preliminaries
to qualify for the finals, in
which he claimed a solid vic
tory over McCrory by a
margin of almost 40 points.
The 3-meter final, however,
was decided by a much clos
er margin, as Ipsen only fin
ished 10 points ahead of Mc-
Crory to claim his second ti
tle.

Stanford's team standing
was greatly hurt by two dis
qualifications in relays. After
it was rendered ineligible to
compete in the finals of the
400-yard medley relay due
to a disqualification in the
preliminaries, it was also dis
qualified from the finals of
the 200-yard event. The lat
ter disqualification especial
ly hurt, as the team had fin
ished in third place in the
preliminaries and had swum
a strong time in the finals al
ready before learning that
they had been disqualified
for an early takeoff.
Stanford's team ultimate
ly scored 282 points, finish
ing almost 200 points behind
Michigan, the eventual vic
tors. The differences be
tween the scores of the top
three teams, Michigan, Cal

and Arizona, was very large,
indicating that the Michigan
swimmers consistently fin
ished in the top of many
events across the board.
With continued contribu
tions from young swimmers
and divers like Nolan and
Ipsen, Stanford hopes to re
turn to national title con
tention next year and into
the future. Stanford has the
ability to consistently swim
strong relays and has power
ful individual swimmers that
can swim with the best in the
country. Next year, the Car
dinal will attempt to pull it
all together and once again
return to its perch atop the
Pac-12 and in the top three
in the country.
