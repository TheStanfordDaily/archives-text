## Nolan, Ipsen bring home NCAA titles Two relay DQs set back men's team to seventh 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
The men's swimming and diving team
suffered a somewhat disappointing end to
the season last weekend, as it finished out
side of the top four in the NCAA Champi
onship meet for the first time in over two
decades.
After also losing its monopoly on the
Pac-12 title after a 31-year reign, the Car
dinal undoubtedly had a down year in
competition. However, stellar individual
performances from younger members of
the team over the course of the NCAA
Championship give the Cardinal strong
hope that it will be back with renewed
strength next year.
During the summer of 2010, more than
20 Division I schools from all around the
nation struggled against each other to re
cruit a rising senior out of Hershey, Penn.,
named David Nolan.
After the dust cleared, Nolan had cho
sen Stanford from the enormous pool of
colleges that coveted his talent. During
the 2011 high school season, Nolan then
promptly shattered the national high
school record in the 200-yard individual
medley (IM).
Two years later, Nolan once again
found himself atop the standings in the
200 IM, except this time it was at the col
legiate level. With a winning time of
1:41:21, the sophomore gave Stanford its
first national title of the 2013 NCAA
Championships, swimming an incredibly
powerful freestyle leg to overtake Flori
da's Marcin Cieslak in the final leg of the
race after trailing for the first three legs.
However, Nolan wasn't satisfied with
just one national title. The very next day,
he claimed a second title, this one coming
in the 100-yard backstroke. Nolan got off
to a strong start and held a solid 0.3-sec
ond lead after the 50-yard split. He never
lost pace in the second half, holding off Cal
senior Tom Shields to claim his second na
tional title of the meet.
In the diving meets of the champi
onships, fellow sophomore Kristian Ipsen,
who spearheaded Stanford's strong diving
corps with two national title performances
of his own over the course of the champi
onship meet, matched Nolan's strong
showing.
