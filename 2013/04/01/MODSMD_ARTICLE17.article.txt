### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The No. 13 Stanford women's lacrosse team
outscored No. 19 James Madison 9-2 in the second
half to capture its fourth consecutive victory on
Saturday. The Cardinal (6-2,1-0 MPSF) was trail
ing 9-7 at halftime in Harrisonburg, Va., but
stormed back after the break to take a 14-9 victo
ry.
Stanford junior Rachel Ozer scored a season
high seven points, including five goals tied for
the ninth highest single-game tally in Stanford

history. The attacker leads the Cardinal with 24
goals and 12 assists this season.
"[Ozer] had some lasers for shots and was play
ing fearless, which was awesome," Stanford head
coach Amy Bokker told GoStanford.com.
Lucy Dikeou also continued her strong fresh
man campaign, contributing four goals of her own
to go along with two ground balls and two draw
controls.
The freshman opened the game with an unas
sisted tally less than two minutes into the game,
but JMU responded with three straight goals.
Dikeou was able to stem the bleeding by adding

her second goal on a free position shot at 16:03.
"[Dikeou] definitely came out sharp in the first
half," Bokker said. "She had such great speed, and
I thought she did a great job utilizing that
throughout the entire game."
Dikeou's goal kicked off a 10-minute stretch in
which the teams traded three goals apiece. Cardi
nal sophomore Kyle Eraser scored off an assist
from fellow sophomore Emily Newstrom, and af
ter another JMU tally, Dikeou capped off the hat
trick.
