### CAMERON MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf
team won its home tourna
ment for the first time in six
years Saturday, decimating
most of the 17-team field in
the process.
Holding a one-shot ad
vantage over No. 22 St.
Mary's after round one, the
Cardinal pulled away on Fri
day by shooting a combined
9-under 271 to build an 11-
stroke lead over No. 8 TCU.
Stanford was the only team
to break par in the second
round, creating what would
be an insurmountable advan
tage.
The Horned Frogs did
not go quietly, however. Led
by individual tournament
champ Paul Barjon, TCU

Sophomore Patrick Rodgers (above) took second with an 8-under 202 at the U.S. Intercollegiate this past
weekend, helping Stanford win its first home tournament in six years. Alongside Rodgers, senior Andrew Yun
impressed with a 5-under 65 performance, playing in the final home tournament of his collegiate career.
fired a tournament low 11-under
269 in Saturday's final round to get
back in contention. Eli Cole and
Julien Brun also made valiant last
ditch efforts for TCU but to no
avail.
Stanford countered the TCU
charge with a 6-under 274 perform
ance of its own, holding on for a
comfortable six-shot victory. The
Horned Frogs were the only team
able to get a sniff at the Cardinal;
at 23-under for the tournament,
Stanford defeated third-place St.
Mary's by 22 strokes and Pac-12
foes USC, Colorado and Oregon by
32,36 and 37 shots respectively.
"The guys had a great finish
[Saturday], and shooting 23-under
on the Stanford Golf Course was

really impressive," head coach
Conrad Ray said. "It's great to
have the momentum from a solid
last tournament in Las Vegas [SH
Collegiate Masters] and then to
continue that into good play this
week."
Sophomore Patrick Rodgers
continued his torrid play, placing
second at 8-under 202, three strokes
behind Barjon. While Rodgers card
ed consecutive 4-under 66s in the
first two rounds, he settled for an
even-par 70 on Saturday.
"It was a solid week for me but I
still have a lot of areas to improve,"
said Rodgers about his tournament.
"I hit the ball well enough to shoot
some decent numbers but didn't get
the most out of my rounds on the
greens. In the final round, I putted
poorly and failed to save a few keys
shot that added to the total."
Senior Andrew Yun, on the other
hand, found another gear on Satur
day, scorching the Stanford Golf

Course with a 5-under 65. Yun, play
ing in his final home tournament,
finished third at 7-under par.
"We're really excited about the
performances," commented Ray
"Neat to see Patrick Rodgers have a
chance to win, but also Andrew Yun
sneak in there with a really nice 65
today. All in all it was a great team
effort, hopefully we'll keep it
rolling."
Junior Cameron Wilson carded
his third straight top-10 individual
finish by placing fifth at 5-under par,
vastly improving on his 19th place
performance at last year's U.S. In
tercollegiate. Again, Wilson was the
most consistent of the Cardinal
golfers, shooting 68-68-69.
"Lately I've been good at stay
ing patient on the course," com
mented Wilson on his steady play.
"This makes it easier to make good
decisions and not compound any er
rors. Hopefully I can improve on
my scoring clubs but continue to

stay out of trouble and be patient."
Freshman David Boote also
claimed a spot in the top-10 with a
3-under 207. The Surrey, England
native bounced back nicely after
his 10-over par showing at the
Southern Highlands Collegiate
Masters three weeks ago. Senior
Steve Kearney, playing for the Stan
ford White (B) Team, made up for
his opening round 74 with a 65 on
Saturday, vaulting into eighth place
in the individual standings. Overall,
the Card had five players in the top
10, while USF was next with three.
"It was neat to see so many of
our guys in contention for the indi
vidual title," Ray said. "We had four
guys in the top six, so to have that
solid contribution from all the guys
is really impressive."
Not only were Stanford's fron
trunners on display; so was the
team's depth. The Stanford White
(B) Team, lead by Kearney, defeated
a top-50 team in No. 48 San Diego

State and tied No. 47 Oregon, ulti
mately finishing tied for ninth in the
team competition.
The team wraps up its tourna
ment play at the Western Intercolle
giate at the Pasatiempo Golf Club in
Santa Cruz April 13-14. Then post
season play begins with the Pacol2
Championships from April 29-May
1.
"We just need to keep working
hard," Rodgers said. "We are im
proving as a team and have been all
spring. I think from top to bottom
we have gotten better, and each
guy individually needs to keep
working hard on his own games.
This week was big as we look to
build a little momentum heading in
to postseason play. I think we are
building confidence and headed in
the right direction for a postseason
run."
