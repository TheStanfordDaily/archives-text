### CAMERON MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf
team won its home tourna
ment for the first time in six
years Saturday, decimating
most of the 17-team field in
the process.
Holding a one-shot ad
vantage over No. 22 St.
Mary's after round one, the
Cardinal pulled away on Fri
day by shooting a combined
9-under 271 to build an 11-
stroke lead over No. 8 TCU.
Stanford was the only team
to break par in the second
round, creating what would
be an insurmountable advan
tage.
The Horned Frogs did
not go quietly, however. Led
by individual tournament
champ Paul Barjon, TCU
