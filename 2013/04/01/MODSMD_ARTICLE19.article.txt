# Streak may be over, but all hail the King

I have tried three times to start
this column about the Miami
Heat uncorking a 27-game win
ning streak that seems even
more incredible when you think
about it for a second. Each time, I make
it about this far into the page before I
completely run out of steam, adjec
tives, jokes or a combination of the
three.
I guess the first thing to accept is
this remarkable fact: The Heat were
able to run off 27 straight victories in
the modern NBA. Their escape
against the Cleveland Cavaliers, when
they were down nearly 30 points
halfway through the third quarter,
was one of the most incredible per
formances I have ever seen by a team,
period. More impressively save for
that dramatic comeback and a few
other dodged bullets against the
Boston Celtics and the Orlando Magic,
they pretty much eviscerated every op
ponent on their schedule.

Most of the games they played be
tween win number one (100-85 over the
Toronto Raptors) and win number 27
(108-94 over the Magic) weren't close at
all. Just take a look at their schedule on
ESPN; the red "Loss" marks are few
and far between on the whole, but then
they disappear altogether for a period
of a month and a half. That's borderline
impossible, especially for a team sport
as fickle as basketball. To be blunt, they
are undoubtedly the best team in the
NBA right no\y complete with the best
player alive.
That brings us to Leßron James,
who is turning in a regular season for
the ages. On the season, he is putting
up 26.9 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.3 as
sists PER GAME, while shooting 56
percent from the field. This is probably
the closest any human being has come
to averaging a triple-double since Os
car Robertson did it 50 years ago.
On top of the numbers, here are
some intangibles that can't be meas
ured: He can play and defend all five
positions on the floor, he produces at
least two highlights every game that
make the top 10 plays on Sports Center
and when the game is on the line, more
often that not he comes through in the
clutch. When the game is on the line,
you WANT the ball in Leßron's hands
...and that is a statement I never
thought I would able to make with a
straight face.
Basketball as a sport has so many
variables and moving parts. There is
the schedule (Is a team on an extended
road trip? The back end of a back-to
back? A long series of winnable home
games?), the players themselves (Are
some players surging? Are others
slumping?), the opponents (Are they
riding a hot streak? Are they mired in
a slump?), the crowd (Is the team pop
ular? Can the crowd swing the out
come?), the officiating (How loose are
the whistles going to be?), the venue
(How big is the stage? Is the team
home or away?)... the list goes on and
on.
The fact is that the NBA has the
best players in the world, and the dif
ference between victory and defeat of
ten rests on razor-sharp mar-gins. For
any team to beat the randomness of
some of the aforementioned variables
and chug through 27 straight victories
is so unlikely as to be nearly impossible.
It speaks volumes that Jerry West, one
of the players on that legendary Lak
ers team that won 33 straight games in
1972 (the only streak to surpass the one
we just witnessed), gave this Miami
Heat team his blessing and his highest
praise. He would know the degree of
difficulty in channeling so many mov
ing parts together into a cohesive
whole for just one game, let alone 27.
On the whole, however, this tells us
nothing new about the Miami Heat.
The Heat are defending champions for
good reason: They have the best player
in the world, two of the most over-qual
ified supporting player's in Chris Bosh
and Dwyane Wade and an array of
shooters who can go supernova on any
given day. We knew before the season
that they would be strong contenders
for repeating as NBA champions.
This streak just shows that they al
ready have the mojo needed to pull it
off.

Vignesh Venkataraman has yet to get
over his celebrity crush on Leßron.
