# Class of 2017 admit rate marks record low
## University admits 5.69 percent of historic total 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford offered admission to 2,210
students via electronic notification on
Friday, producing â€”at 5.69 percent
the lowest admit rate in University
history
The University received a total of
38,828 applications this year, a record to
tal and a 6 percent increase over last
year's figure of 36,631. Stanford ac
cepted 725 students in December
through the Office of Undergradu
ate Admission's restrictive early ac

tion program and extended offers to
1,485 more applicants on Friday. A fur
ther 813 students have been placed on
the waitlist.

"The most exciting part of our review
is the opportunity to consider the world's
most exceptional students," wrote Dean
of Admission and Financial Aid Richard
Shaw in a press release. "The most
daunting challenge is to select a relative
ly small number from among a most com
petitive and exceptional group of candi
dates. We are honored by the vast abili
ties and potential of those we admitted
and those who, in the end, we could not
accommodate."
The record low admit rate reflects a
continued trend of increasing selectivity
for Stanford. The University admitted 6.6
percent of applicants in 2012,7.1 percent

in 2011 and 7.2 percent in 2010.
At the same time, the size of the ma
triculating freshman class has grown
over the past three years, from 1,675 for
the Class of 2014 to 1,768 for the Class
of 2016. The increased yield rate has
prompted academic and residential ad
justments for incoming classes, as well
as for the Class of 2016 the re
lease of all waitlisted students.
On Thursday, several peer institu
tions also reported historically low ad
mit rates. Harvard, Yale, Columbia and
Princeton admitted 5.8, 6.72, 6.89 and
7.29 percent of applicants respectively.
Accepted students have until May 1
to accept the University's offer.
