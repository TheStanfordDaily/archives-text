## Balancing work and motherhood University offers program to assist female faculty members 
### JENNIFER SCHAFFER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Shelley Fisher Fishkin, director
of Stanford's American Studies
program and professor of English,
turned in her dissertation the
month her first son was born.

"The dissertation weighed more
than he did," Fishkin reflected with
a smile.
For Fishkin and other women in
academia, however, balancing work
and family life is an act that ex
tends far beyond accruing degrees.
Decades after the women's move
ment first advocated equal rights
and opportunities for women, the
concept of "having it all" often re
mains removed from reality, no
tably so according to Mackenzie
Barnes, a third-year Ph.D. candi
date in comparative literature in
academia.

In reality, Barnes suggested,
something has to give, with that
"something" often being a women's
career ambitions.

"I've heard a lot of push back to
the 'having it all' conversation
amongst my female peers," Barnes
said. "You have to, at some point,
realize that you can't be working 20
hours a day."

Fishkin echoed Barnes' senti
ment that "having it all" is often
near to impossible.
"The bottom line is: yes, you can
have it all, but not at the same
time," Fishkin said. "It's virtually
impossible to be the kind of parent
you want to be, the kind of re
searcher you want to be, the kind of
teacher you want to be, all at the
same time. There's only 24 hours in
the day it does not compute."
Despite this conflict, some
working mothers in academia, such
as Fishkin and Professor of Biology
Deborah Gordon M.S. '77, maintain
that motherhood is too important to
subordinate to an academic career,
arguing instead that the academic
community needs to adjust to ac
commodate working mothers.
"Having children, knowing my
children is the most rewarding
thing I've ever done," Gordon em
phasized. "I wouldn't trade it for
anything. We have to keep talking
and thinking about how to make it
easier."
Bridging the gap
The School of Medicine has been
a focal point of such conversations
at Stanford, in an effort led by Han
nah Valantine, senior associate
dean for diversity and leadership
and professor of medicine.
Valantine, herself a working
mother, described Stanford's cur
rent work-life policies including
maternity leave and childcare as
"quite robust." Even so, less than
half of School of Medicine faculty
members eligible for Stanford's
