## Balancing work and motherhood University offers program to assist female faculty members 
### JENNIFER SCHAFFER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Shelley Fisher Fishkin, director
of Stanford's American Studies
program and professor of English,
turned in her dissertation the
month her first son was born.

"The dissertation weighed more
than he did," Fishkin reflected with
a smile.
For Fishkin and other women in
academia, however, balancing work
and family life is an act that ex
tends far beyond accruing degrees.
Decades after the women's move
ment first advocated equal rights
and opportunities for women, the
concept of "having it all" often re
mains removed from reality, no
tably so according to Mackenzie
Barnes, a third-year Ph.D. candi
date in comparative literature in
academia.

In reality, Barnes suggested,
something has to give, with that
"something" often being a women's
career ambitions.

"I've heard a lot of push back to
the 'having it all' conversation
amongst my female peers," Barnes
said. "You have to, at some point,
realize that you can't be working 20
hours a day."

Fishkin echoed Barnes' senti
ment that "having it all" is often
near to impossible.
"The bottom line is: yes, you can
have it all, but not at the same
time," Fishkin said. "It's virtually
impossible to be the kind of parent
you want to be, the kind of re
searcher you want to be, the kind of
teacher you want to be, all at the
same time. There's only 24 hours in
the day it does not compute."
Despite this conflict, some
working mothers in academia, such
as Fishkin and Professor of Biology
Deborah Gordon M.S. '77, maintain
that motherhood is too important to
subordinate to an academic career,
arguing instead that the academic
community needs to adjust to ac
commodate working mothers.
"Having children, knowing my
children is the most rewarding
thing I've ever done," Gordon em
phasized. "I wouldn't trade it for
anything. We have to keep talking
and thinking about how to make it
easier."
Bridging the gap
The School of Medicine has been
a focal point of such conversations
at Stanford, in an effort led by Han
nah Valantine, senior associate
dean for diversity and leadership
and professor of medicine.
Valantine, herself a working
mother, described Stanford's cur
rent work-life policies including
maternity leave and childcare as
"quite robust." Even so, less than
half of School of Medicine faculty
members eligible for Stanford's
work-life flexibility plan
avail themselves of the op
portunity, according to a
study conducted by Valan
tine and her team.
"When we asked why, we
found that women don't take
as much of their maternal
leave as they are offered,"
Valantine explained. "They
tend to take much less. In
general, there is a feeling
that if you use these policies,
you'll be viewed as not as se
rious."
What needs to change,
Valantine believes, is the

mindset and structure of ac
ademia.
"[The] lack of flexibility is
not due to lack of policies but
more due to the fact of what
we internalize as the path for
success the core values of
what it takes to be a success
ful researcher or physician,"
she said. "These core values
involve one path to success,
and any deviation we fear
runs the risk of being not
successful... We need to re
frame work-life policies so
they are viewed as career
advancing and not career
pausing."
Valantine's pilot program
at the School of Medicine en
courages faculty and re
searchers to individualize
their career paths through a

credit system that integrates
their work and home lives.
In exchange for taking on
extra hours of teaching, for
example, a faculty member
in the program can receive
credits that can be ex
changed for cleaning the
house or assistance with
grant proposal writing.
For Valantine, the ques
tion of "having it all" is not a
gender-centric issue but
rather away of improving
work-life balance for all aca
demics, not least of all work
ing parents of both genders.
"The new generation of
men wants to spend more
time with their families as
well," she noted. "This pro
gram will allow us to contin
ue to recruit the brightest

and the best."
Nevertheless, for work
ing mothers bearing the
brunt of the domestic work
load, Valantine's initiative
could have particularly
transformative benefits.
Shelley Correll M.A. '96,
Ph.D. 'Ol, professor of sociol
ogy and director of the Clay
man Institute for Gender
Research, praised the pilot
program as "highly innova
tive." Correll described
Stanford faculty members
both male and female
as generally very content
with their experiences on
the Farm, but acknowl
edged a persistent gender
divide in faculty satisfac
tion.
"We do find that women
faculty feel that they have
less support from their col
leagues and less support
from their academic depart
ment and that they are more
likely to consider leaving
Stanford than their male
counterparts," she said.
"Women faculty report more
... stress about balancing
work and family."
Correll emphasized, how
ever, the presence of a simi
lar divide at many other uni
versities and cited increased
female representation at
senior faculty levels and the
implementation of Stan
ford's tenure clock extension

policy whereby new par
ents are given an extra year
on the tenure clock â€”as
signs of a positive culture
change.
"This program has been
really successful," she said.
"If you looked at Stanford
before they had these pro
grams, [male] faculty had
children, while [female] fac
ulty were far less likely to.
Now, if you look at the assis
tant professors, the men and
women faculty are about
equally likely to have chil
dren.'"
Structural difficulties
Asked if she believed
there to be concrete benefits
to pursuing an academic ca
reer as a working mother,
Fishkin demurred, describ
ing the academic work cycle
as potentially both friendly
and unfriendly to family life.
"The unfriendly part is
that we are always working,"
she said. "Our heads are al
ways engaged in our re
search, even if we are doing
something totally unrelated,
like driving [the] carpool...
But on the other hand, the
number of hours that you
have to physically be away
from home [has fallen] it's
work that you can do at
home, and computers make it
even easier to do work from
home."

Even so, balancing work
and family can still be compli
cated.
"It doesn't mean that
working from home makes
you able to take care of your
kids at home, so you have to
find out away of balancing
them," Fishkin emphasized.
"But... I think that with
plans like Dr. Valantine's in
place, [working in academia]
would be a huge advantage."
Asked what advice they
would give young women hop
ing to pursue careers in aca
demia while simultaneously
raising families, both Barnes
and Gordon noted that plan
ning their careers and fami
lies only goes so far.
"You can't actually plan
everything," Barnes said. "To
some extent, you have to just
make things work for you, for
your life."
"It's misleading to feel
that being strategic will make
it any easier," Gordon said.
"That's unfair. This focus on
timing puts the burden back
on the individual. The rea
son it's so difficult is be
cause the support systems
are not in place. I feel con
cerned that some people
feel that if they did it differ
ently, timed it differently, it
would be any easier."

Shelley Fisher Fishkin, director
of Stanford's American Studies
program and professor of English,
turned in her dissertation the
month her first son was born.

"The dissertation weighed more
than he did," Fishkin reflected with
a smile.
For Fishkin and other women in
academia, however, balancing work
and family life is an act that ex
tends far beyond accruing degrees.
Decades after the women's move
ment first advocated equal rights
and opportunities for women, the
concept of "having it all" often re
mains removed from reality, no
tably so according to Mackenzie
Barnes, a third-year Ph.D. candi
date in comparative literature in
academia.

In reality, Barnes suggested,
something has to give, with that
"something" often being a women's
career ambitions.

"I've heard a lot of push back to
the 'having it all' conversation
amongst my female peers," Barnes
said. "You have to, at some point,
realize that you can't be working 20
hours a day."

Fishkin echoed Barnes' senti
ment that "having it all" is often
near to impossible.
"The bottom line is: yes, you can
have it all, but not at the same
time," Fishkin said. "It's virtually
impossible to be the kind of parent
you want to be, the kind of re
searcher you want to be, the kind of
teacher you want to be, all at the
same time. There's only 24 hours in
the day it does not compute."
Despite this conflict, some
working mothers in academia, such
as Fishkin and Professor of Biology
Deborah Gordon M.S. '77, maintain
that motherhood is too important to
subordinate to an academic career,
arguing instead that the academic
community needs to adjust to ac
commodate working mothers.
"Having children, knowing my
children is the most rewarding
thing I've ever done," Gordon em
phasized. "I wouldn't trade it for
anything. We have to keep talking
and thinking about how to make it
easier."
Bridging the gap
The School of Medicine has been
a focal point of such conversations
at Stanford, in an effort led by Han
nah Valantine, senior associate
dean for diversity and leadership
and professor of medicine.
Valantine, herself a working
mother, described Stanford's cur
rent work-life policies including
maternity leave and childcare as
"quite robust." Even so, less than
half of School of Medicine faculty
members eligible for Stanford's
work-life flexibility plan
avail themselves of the op
portunity, according to a
study conducted by Valan
tine and her team.
"When we asked why, we
found that women don't take
as much of their maternal
leave as they are offered,"
Valantine explained. "They
tend to take much less. In
general, there is a feeling
that if you use these policies,
you'll be viewed as not as se
rious."
What needs to change,
Valantine believes, is the

mindset and structure of ac
ademia.
"[The] lack of flexibility is
not due to lack of policies but
more due to the fact of what
we internalize as the path for
success the core values of
what it takes to be a success
ful researcher or physician,"
she said. "These core values
involve one path to success,
and any deviation we fear
runs the risk of being not
successful... We need to re
frame work-life policies so
they are viewed as career
advancing and not career
pausing."
Valantine's pilot program
at the School of Medicine en
courages faculty and re
searchers to individualize
their career paths through a

credit system that integrates
their work and home lives.
In exchange for taking on
extra hours of teaching, for
example, a faculty member
in the program can receive
credits that can be ex
changed for cleaning the
house or assistance with
grant proposal writing.
For Valantine, the ques
tion of "having it all" is not a
gender-centric issue but
rather away of improving
work-life balance for all aca
demics, not least of all work
ing parents of both genders.
"The new generation of
men wants to spend more
time with their families as
well," she noted. "This pro
gram will allow us to contin
ue to recruit the brightest

and the best."
Nevertheless, for work
ing mothers bearing the
brunt of the domestic work
load, Valantine's initiative
could have particularly
transformative benefits.
Shelley Correll M.A. '96,
Ph.D. 'Ol, professor of sociol
ogy and director of the Clay
man Institute for Gender
Research, praised the pilot
program as "highly innova
tive." Correll described
Stanford faculty members
both male and female
as generally very content
with their experiences on
the Farm, but acknowl
edged a persistent gender
divide in faculty satisfac
tion.
"We do find that women
faculty feel that they have
less support from their col
leagues and less support
from their academic depart
ment and that they are more
likely to consider leaving
Stanford than their male
counterparts," she said.
"Women faculty report more
... stress about balancing
work and family."
Correll emphasized, how
ever, the presence of a simi
lar divide at many other uni
versities and cited increased
female representation at
senior faculty levels and the
implementation of Stan
ford's tenure clock extension

policy whereby new par
ents are given an extra year
on the tenure clock â€”as
signs of a positive culture
change.
"This program has been
really successful," she said.
"If you looked at Stanford
before they had these pro
grams, [male] faculty had
children, while [female] fac
ulty were far less likely to.
Now, if you look at the assis
tant professors, the men and
women faculty are about
equally likely to have chil
dren.'"
Structural difficulties
Asked if she believed
there to be concrete benefits
to pursuing an academic ca
reer as a working mother,
Fishkin demurred, describ
ing the academic work cycle
as potentially both friendly
and unfriendly to family life.
"The unfriendly part is
that we are always working,"
she said. "Our heads are al
ways engaged in our re
search, even if we are doing
something totally unrelated,
like driving [the] carpool...
But on the other hand, the
number of hours that you
have to physically be away
from home [has fallen] it's
work that you can do at
home, and computers make it
even easier to do work from
home."

Even so, balancing work
and family can still be compli
cated.
"It doesn't mean that
working from home makes
you able to take care of your
kids at home, so you have to
find out away of balancing
them," Fishkin emphasized.
"But... I think that with
plans like Dr. Valantine's in
place, [working in academia]
would be a huge advantage."
Asked what advice they
would give young women hop
ing to pursue careers in aca
demia while simultaneously
raising families, both Barnes
and Gordon noted that plan
ning their careers and fami
lies only goes so far.
"You can't actually plan
everything," Barnes said. "To
some extent, you have to just
make things work for you, for
your life."
"It's misleading to feel
that being strategic will make
it any easier," Gordon said.
"That's unfair. This focus on
timing puts the burden back
on the individual. The rea
son it's so difficult is be
cause the support systems
are not in place. I feel con
cerned that some people
