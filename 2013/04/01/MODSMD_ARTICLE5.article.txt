## Students propose Muslim resource center 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A proposal to establish a Muslim
cultural resource center on campus
has gained fresh attention in recent
months, with a group of undergrad
uate and graduate students reviving
a modified version of a seven-year
old plan in meetings with senior Uni
versity administrators.
"Ever since 9/11, there's been
many more questions about Islam,
about countries who are Muslim
countries, about the different cul
tures and the diversity within the
communities," said Mahta
Baghoolizadeh 'l3, president of the
Muslim Student Awareness Net
work. "There has been a greater and
greater need for raising dialogue,
and having a resource center would
be the step forward."
Baghoolizadeh has worked with
Omar Shakir 'O7 J.D. 'l3 and Subhan
Ali M.S. 'O9 Ph.D. 'l4 in approaching
administrators with a proposal for
the center. The trio, who are leading
a larger group associated with a
number of student organizations,
has met with Vice Provost of Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman, Presi
dent John Hennessy and Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 on the
subject.
"We've identified three needs
that we see as being potentially ad
dressed through having a resource
center and through hiring a commu

nity director," Shakir said.
Shakir first identified the need
for a center to serve as an entry
point for students who want to en
gage academically with opportuni
ties in the Muslim world.
"[The center would be] a central
point on the map where any student
who is doing a research project on,
say, architecture in Indonesia or pol
itics in Morocco has a place to go
that they feel like they can connect
to outside of academics," Shakir
said.
Shakir and Baghoolizadeh also
emphasized the need for a safe space
for contentious conversations and
conflicting dialogues.
"We see a significant need for in
stitutional support, visibility and
safe place for those that identify ac
ademically, culturally, religiously,
with the Middle East, North Africa
and South and Southeast Asia,"
Shakir said. "The net is cast really
wide, with over a dozen student
groups, political groups, languages,
involved in some way with the re
gion."
Shakir also argued that Stan
ford's current lack of a Muslim re
source center and the "vibrant
discourse" that would accompany it
is inconsistent with the Universi
ty's global stature and reputation,
alleging that the University "really
doesn't have any institutional sup-
