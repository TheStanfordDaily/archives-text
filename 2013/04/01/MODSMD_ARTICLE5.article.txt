## Students propose Muslim resource center 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A proposal to establish a Muslim
cultural resource center on campus
has gained fresh attention in recent
months, with a group of undergrad
uate and graduate students reviving
a modified version of a seven-year
old plan in meetings with senior Uni
versity administrators.
"Ever since 9/11, there's been
many more questions about Islam,
about countries who are Muslim
countries, about the different cul
tures and the diversity within the
communities," said Mahta
Baghoolizadeh 'l3, president of the
Muslim Student Awareness Net
work. "There has been a greater and
greater need for raising dialogue,
and having a resource center would
be the step forward."
Baghoolizadeh has worked with
Omar Shakir 'O7 J.D. 'l3 and Subhan
Ali M.S. 'O9 Ph.D. 'l4 in approaching
administrators with a proposal for
the center. The trio, who are leading
a larger group associated with a
number of student organizations,
has met with Vice Provost of Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman, Presi
dent John Hennessy and Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 on the
subject.
"We've identified three needs
that we see as being potentially ad
dressed through having a resource
center and through hiring a commu

nity director," Shakir said.
Shakir first identified the need
for a center to serve as an entry
point for students who want to en
gage academically with opportuni
ties in the Muslim world.
"[The center would be] a central
point on the map where any student
who is doing a research project on,
say, architecture in Indonesia or pol
itics in Morocco has a place to go
that they feel like they can connect
to outside of academics," Shakir
said.
Shakir and Baghoolizadeh also
emphasized the need for a safe space
for contentious conversations and
conflicting dialogues.
"We see a significant need for in
stitutional support, visibility and
safe place for those that identify ac
ademically, culturally, religiously,
with the Middle East, North Africa
and South and Southeast Asia,"
Shakir said. "The net is cast really
wide, with over a dozen student
groups, political groups, languages,
involved in some way with the re
gion."
Shakir also argued that Stan
ford's current lack of a Muslim re
source center and the "vibrant
discourse" that would accompany it
is inconsistent with the Universi
ty's global stature and reputation,
alleging that the University "really
doesn't have any institutional sup-
port at all" for Muslim stu
dents beyond academic pro
gramming.
"Every other top school
has either an allocated space
to serve as a forum for these
sorts of discussions, and also
in most cases, [has] hired a
staff person that is in charge
of overseeing programming
and fostering that type of en
vironment," Shakir said.
Though the a version of
the center was first proposed
seven years ago, Ali said that
the lengthy process of ad
vancing the proposal was the
result of seeking a solution

that met the needs of many
different types of people.
"Half the battle is explain
ing it to people and getting
them to see what it is," Ali
said. "We are not 100 percent
sure what it's going to look
like. There are needs and so
lutions that we've outlined,
but no specific demands have
been made."
"We've searched other
ways of dealing with it, but
resource center best serves
[the] needs," Shakir said.
There is no formalized
process to gain approval for a
new community or resource
center, given that the Univer-

sity's current centers all arose
from unique historical circum
stances and that any new cen
ter would fall under several
administrative jurisdictions.

However, Student Affairs has
led the University's approach
to meeting the needs of the
Muslim community.
"There's different options
as to what increased support
for the Muslim community
might look like," Boardman
noted.
He also observed that
promoting the development
of a Muslim resource center
might set a precedent for oth
er religious communities on
campus in the future.
"Our focus is on how can
we best support Muslim stu
dent experience at Stanford,
but we have to look also what
does this mean beyond this,"
he said.
