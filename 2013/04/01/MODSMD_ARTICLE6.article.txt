## GEORGIA ENDS CARD'S NCAA TITLE HOPES 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Everything seemed to be going the way of
the No. 4 Stanford women's basketball team to
start the regional semifinal game of the NCAA
Tournament against No. 14 Georgia.

The Card (33-3, 17-1 Pae-12 ) started the
game 9-0, and midway through the first half of
the Sweet Sixteen, Georgia (28-6, 12-4 SEC)
was still only 3-16 shooting from the field and
trailing 11-4. National Player of the Year candi
date junior forward Chiney Ogwumike was
leading all scorers with eight points, shooting a
perfect 4-4, while the rest of her team shot just
3-13.
All favor swung in the opposite direction
though when sophomore guard Taylor Green
field, a key contributor off the bench, left the
game with a sprained finger at 13:27, and sen
ior forward Joslyn Tinkle picked up her second
personal foul and was forced to sit out crucial
minutes of the first half.

Stanford allowed Georgia to hang with it for
most of the game and the Lady Bulldogs
slipped past the Card in the final minutes to win
61-59.
"We know that we can compete with these
teams," said head coach Tara VanDerveer. "Ob
viously we competed, but we had to really go as
hard as we could, we worked as hard as we
could to get to where we are. And I'm disap
pointed because I have experienced more going
to the Final Four and winning a national cham

pionship, but I'm not disappointed with what
this team accomplished."
Tinkle, who was instrumental in Stanford's
73-40 win over Michigan with a 21-point per
formance in her final game at Maples, was only
able to play eight minutes in the first half due to
early foul trouble and finished the game with
five points and six rebounds.

Junior forward Chiney Ogwumike (13) led Stanford with 26 points and 12 rebounds
against Georgia, but the Cardinal could not deliver in the final moments, losing 61-59.
junior guard Toni Kokenis sit
ting out her 14th consecutive
game with an undisclosed ill
ness subbed in sophomore
guard Bonnie Samuelson,
who drove to the basket with
seven minutes to play in the
first half.
However, those would be
the first and last bench points
that the Card would get for
the remainder of the game.
Stanford did not see much
scoring outside of Ogwumike
and sophomore point guard
Amber Orrange, with Tinkle
still out of the game.
Georgia soon came back
from a nine-point deficit, the
largest of the game, to lead
Stanford 22-21 by getting re
bounds and limiting Stan
ford's second chance opportu
nities. VanDerveer called a
timeout and Stanford was
able to rally with Tinkle back
in the game, going on a 13-5
run to close the half leading
34-27. Ogwumike went into
halftime with 18 points, shoot
ing a near-perfect 8-9.
Neither team could connect
from the field to start the sec
ond half, but Stanford con
trolled the flow of the game
through rebounds, keeping the
ball out of Georgia's possession
and capitalizing on offensive
boards.
Georgia managed to take
their second lead of the game
with 7:20 to play at 4644 by go
ing on a 144 run. From that
point on it was a tradeoff in
points, with neither team re
gaining control.
Ogwumike fought through
the double team inside to score
off of offensive rebounds. How
ever, Georgia was able to han
dle Stanford's defense by
knocking down 3's and being
the aggressors inside the paint.

Orrange hit her third three of
the game around the two
minute mark to give Stanford
its last lead of the game, 55-54.
Georgia answered right
back with an easy shot under
their basket. Forward Mikaela
Ruef (six points, seven re
bounds) was sent to the line on
the other end with 1:21 to play
with the opportunity to put
Stanford up by one. Ruef
missed the first and made the
second, tying the game at 56.
Again, Georgia took Stan
ford to the hole with a minute
remaining, regaining the lead
58-56. An unproductive pos
session for the Card gave the
ball back to Georgia, who then
missed a three but got the of
fensive rebound with 23.5 sec
onds remaining.
Forced to foul, Stanford
put Georgia's freshman Jas
mine James at the line. James
led the Lady Bulldogs with 16
points, while Georgia's leading
scorer Jasmine Hassel was
held to just 13. Six of Hassel's
points came in the final three
minutes.
James went 2-2 from the
line, putting the Lady Bull
dogs up 60-56.
Coming out of the timeout,
Stanford needed a quick three
pointer to make it a one pos
session game. Tinkle deliv
ered. With just her second
basket of the night, the senior
made her last basket of her
collegiate career to put the
Card within one point with 5.1
seconds to play.
Unfortunately for the
Card, it was too little, too late.
Stanford got the ball back with
.8 seconds remaining and had
just enough time to lob a
prayer in the direction of Og
wumike at the opposite end of
the court.
Georgia grabbed the in
bounds pass and with it,
grabbed Stanford's hopes of
advancing to the Elite Eight
and, eventually, to the Final
Four where it would have

made a historic sixth consecu
tive appearance.
Ogwumike led all scorers
to end the season with 26
points and 12 rebounds. Or
range was the only other Car
dinal to reach double digits,
pouring in 17 points and eight
rebounds. But with the team
only shooting 29 percent in the
second half, coupled with lock
down Georgia defense, Stan
ford was unable to generate
much offense outside of those
two leaders.
However, Stanford has a
great opportunity next year to
come back strong and hungry
from this unexpected loss,
with basically the same team.
The Card loses only one
starter, Joslyn Tinkle, but red
shirt junior Mikaela Ruef will
return for her fifth year on The
Farm. Junior guard Tbni Koke
nis should be ready for next
season and the team will also
be joined by a new set of re
cruits.
With Ogwumike, Kokenis,
and Sara James in their senior
seasons and Orrange with one
more year of experience, next
year could be the year that the
Card finally brings home its
first NCAA championship
since 1992.
"I think the reason that I'm
not going ballistic right now is
like we're 33-3," Ogwumike
said. "That was a huge achieve
ment for our program."
In addition to its impressive
record, Stanford also finished
the season as Pac-12 confer
ence and tournament champi
ons.
"I'm really proud of how we
were facing our form of adver
sity as a team," Ogwumike
said. "So I think that's the one
thing I'm hanging on to, is like
we worked our butts off this
year, and things didn't fall the
way they should have, in my
opinion, tonight."

the No. 4 Stanford women's basketball team to
start the regional semifinal game of the NCAA
Tournament against No. 14 Georgia.

The Card (33-3, 17-1 Pae-12 ) started the
game 9-0, and midway through the first half of
the Sweet Sixteen, Georgia (28-6, 12-4 SEC)
was still only 3-16 shooting from the field and
trailing 11-4. National Player of the Year candi
date junior forward Chiney Ogwumike was
leading all scorers with eight points, shooting a
perfect 4-4, while the rest of her team shot just
3-13.
All favor swung in the opposite direction
though when sophomore guard Taylor Green
field, a key contributor off the bench, left the
game with a sprained finger at 13:27, and sen
ior forward Joslyn Tinkle picked up her second
personal foul and was forced to sit out crucial
minutes of the first half.

Stanford allowed Georgia to hang with it for
most of the game and the Lady Bulldogs
slipped past the Card in the final minutes to win
61-59.
"We know that we can compete with these
teams," said head coach Tara VanDerveer. "Ob
viously we competed, but we had to really go as
hard as we could, we worked as hard as we
could to get to where we are. And I'm disap
pointed because I have experienced more going
to the Final Four and winning a national cham

pionship, but I'm not disappointed with what
this team accomplished."
Tinkle, who was instrumental in Stanford's
73-40 win over Michigan with a 21-point per
formance in her final game at Maples, was only
able to play eight minutes in the first half due to
early foul trouble and finished the game with
five points and six rebounds.

Junior forward Chiney Ogwumike (13) led Stanford with 26 points and 12 rebounds
against Georgia, but the Cardinal could not deliver in the final moments, losing 61-59.
junior guard Toni Kokenis sit
ting out her 14th consecutive
game with an undisclosed ill
ness subbed in sophomore
guard Bonnie Samuelson,
who drove to the basket with
seven minutes to play in the
first half.
However, those would be
the first and last bench points
that the Card would get for
the remainder of the game.
Stanford did not see much
scoring outside of Ogwumike
and sophomore point guard
Amber Orrange, with Tinkle
still out of the game.
Georgia soon came back
from a nine-point deficit, the
largest of the game, to lead
Stanford 22-21 by getting re
bounds and limiting Stan
ford's second chance opportu
nities. VanDerveer called a
timeout and Stanford was
able to rally with Tinkle back
in the game, going on a 13-5
run to close the half leading
34-27. Ogwumike went into
halftime with 18 points, shoot
ing a near-perfect 8-9.
Neither team could connect
from the field to start the sec
ond half, but Stanford con
trolled the flow of the game
through rebounds, keeping the
ball out of Georgia's possession
and capitalizing on offensive
boards.
Georgia managed to take
their second lead of the game
with 7:20 to play at 4644 by go
ing on a 144 run. From that
point on it was a tradeoff in
points, with neither team re
gaining control.
Ogwumike fought through
the double team inside to score
off of offensive rebounds. How
ever, Georgia was able to han
dle Stanford's defense by
knocking down 3's and being
the aggressors inside the paint.

Orrange hit her third three of
the game around the two
minute mark to give Stanford
its last lead of the game, 55-54.
Georgia answered right
back with an easy shot under
their basket. Forward Mikaela
Ruef (six points, seven re
bounds) was sent to the line on
the other end with 1:21 to play
with the opportunity to put
Stanford up by one. Ruef
missed the first and made the
second, tying the game at 56.
Again, Georgia took Stan
ford to the hole with a minute
remaining, regaining the lead
58-56. An unproductive pos
session for the Card gave the
ball back to Georgia, who then
missed a three but got the of
fensive rebound with 23.5 sec
onds remaining.
Forced to foul, Stanford
put Georgia's freshman Jas
mine James at the line. James
led the Lady Bulldogs with 16
points, while Georgia's leading
scorer Jasmine Hassel was
held to just 13. Six of Hassel's
points came in the final three
minutes.
James went 2-2 from the
line, putting the Lady Bull
dogs up 60-56.
Coming out of the timeout,
Stanford needed a quick three
pointer to make it a one pos
session game. Tinkle deliv
ered. With just her second
basket of the night, the senior
made her last basket of her
collegiate career to put the
Card within one point with 5.1
seconds to play.
Unfortunately for the
Card, it was too little, too late.
Stanford got the ball back with
.8 seconds remaining and had
just enough time to lob a
prayer in the direction of Og
wumike at the opposite end of
the court.
Georgia grabbed the in
bounds pass and with it,
grabbed Stanford's hopes of
advancing to the Elite Eight
and, eventually, to the Final
Four where it would have

made a historic sixth consecu
tive appearance.
Ogwumike led all scorers
to end the season with 26
points and 12 rebounds. Or
range was the only other Car
dinal to reach double digits,
pouring in 17 points and eight
rebounds. But with the team
only shooting 29 percent in the
second half, coupled with lock
down Georgia defense, Stan
ford was unable to generate
much offense outside of those
two leaders.
However, Stanford has a
great opportunity next year to
come back strong and hungry
from this unexpected loss,
with basically the same team.
The Card loses only one
starter, Joslyn Tinkle, but red
shirt junior Mikaela Ruef will
return for her fifth year on The
Farm. Junior guard Tbni Koke
nis should be ready for next
season and the team will also
be joined by a new set of re
cruits.
With Ogwumike, Kokenis,
and Sara James in their senior
seasons and Orrange with one
more year of experience, next
year could be the year that the
Card finally brings home its
first NCAA championship
since 1992.
"I think the reason that I'm
not going ballistic right now is
like we're 33-3," Ogwumike
said. "That was a huge achieve
ment for our program."
In addition to its impressive
record, Stanford also finished
the season as Pac-12 confer
ence and tournament champi
ons.
"I'm really proud of how we
were facing our form of adver
sity as a team," Ogwumike
said. "So I think that's the one
thing I'm hanging on to, is like
we worked our butts off this
year, and things didn't fall the
way they should have, in my
opinion, tonight."
