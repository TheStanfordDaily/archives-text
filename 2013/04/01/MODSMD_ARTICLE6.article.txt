## GEORGIA ENDS CARD'S NCAA TITLE HOPES 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Everything seemed to be going the way of
the No. 4 Stanford women's basketball team to
start the regional semifinal game of the NCAA
Tournament against No. 14 Georgia.

The Card (33-3, 17-1 Pae-12 ) started the
game 9-0, and midway through the first half of
the Sweet Sixteen, Georgia (28-6, 12-4 SEC)
was still only 3-16 shooting from the field and
trailing 11-4. National Player of the Year candi
date junior forward Chiney Ogwumike was
leading all scorers with eight points, shooting a
perfect 4-4, while the rest of her team shot just
3-13.
All favor swung in the opposite direction
though when sophomore guard Taylor Green
field, a key contributor off the bench, left the
game with a sprained finger at 13:27, and sen
ior forward Joslyn Tinkle picked up her second
personal foul and was forced to sit out crucial
minutes of the first half.

Stanford allowed Georgia to hang with it for
most of the game and the Lady Bulldogs
slipped past the Card in the final minutes to win
61-59.
"We know that we can compete with these
teams," said head coach Tara VanDerveer. "Ob
viously we competed, but we had to really go as
hard as we could, we worked as hard as we
could to get to where we are. And I'm disap
pointed because I have experienced more going
to the Final Four and winning a national cham

pionship, but I'm not disappointed with what
this team accomplished."
Tinkle, who was instrumental in Stanford's
73-40 win over Michigan with a 21-point per
formance in her final game at Maples, was only
able to play eight minutes in the first half due to
early foul trouble and finished the game with
five points and six rebounds.
