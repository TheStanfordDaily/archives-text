## Professor pioneers allergy treatment 
### LAN ANH LE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Kari Nadeau, associate pro
fessor of pediatrics in the
School of Medicine, uses a
seemingly counterintuitive
treatment for her young pa
tients suffering from severe
food allergies: giving them dos
es of the things that could kill
them.
Nadeau has used this tech
nique, called oral immunother
apy (OIT), in trials to desensi
tize children with multiple food
allergies. In OIT, the patient
swallows small amounts of an
allergen, increasing the dosage
over time until his or her body
builds up a tolerance to it.
Until recently, the only so
lution for patients with severe
food allergies was strict avoid
ance of the allergen. However,
Nadeau's work with OIT has
provided a viable alternative to
the traditional avoidance
method, especially for children
with life-threatening allergies.
According to Nadeau, the
results of OlT's preliminary
trials have been promising.
"The three patients that I
have been working with did
what we had expected them to
do," Nadeau said. "Gradually,
they ate more of the allergen
than what they could originally
eat, and eventually they have
become desensitized."
Desensitizing children with
multiple allergies
A Feb. 2013 study in Pedi
atrics estimated that almost
six million children in the Unit
ed States one in 13 kids
has a food allergy. According to
the study, approximately 39
percent of these allergies
cause severe reactions, making
Nadeau's task both more chal
lenging and important.
"There are so many people
with severe allergies, kids with
multiple food allergies," she re
flected. "I am inspired by my
patients to do this work."
One of Nadeau's patients is
nine-year-old Tessa, who was
severely allergic to milk,
wheat, eggs, nuts, shellfish and
multiple other foods when her
mother, Kim Yates Grosso, ap
proached Nadeau about possi
ble treatments in 2009.
Before Tessa started OIT
treatment in 2012, she and her

family lived in constant fear of
a life-threatening allergic reac
tion. Grosso said that the
process of being desensitized
to allergens was ultimately not
just about "being able to eat a
type of food.
"It's more about diminish
ing the fear and threats that
we used to have to face,"
Grosso said. 'At one point, Tes
sa had stopped eating and did
n't want to leave the house."
After going through an ac
celerated process in a multi-al
lergen clinical study, Tessa can
now safely eat many of the
foods that were once forbid
den.
"She has gone from the
point where she almost died
when milk got spilled on her
skin to being a kid who can eat
ice cream," Grosso said. "She
can eat 16 peanuts, 16 almonds
and almost as much wheat as
she wants."
Like other patients, Tessa
has to continue eating the al
lergens every day so that she
does not become allergic again,
though the ultimate goal is that
she will no longer have to wor
ry about a relapse.
"There's a lot of hope,"
Grosso said. "We just don't
know how long it would be un
til she can stop."
Stanford Alliance for Food
Allergy Research
According to Nadeau, her
interest in the immune system
stemmed from her experience
suffering from asthma and al
lergies to molds and polluted
water in the houseboat where
she lived as a child.
She became involved in
long-term work in immunolo
gy and allergies after discover
ing the close connection be
tween asthma and allergies,
and she founded the Stanford
Alliance for Food Allergy Re
search (SAFAR) to consolidate
a clinical research team in
fighting food allergies.
According to Nadeau, SA
FAR researchers focus on the
nuances of the allergic condi
tion, such as the link between
food allergies and asthma, how
tobacco and pollution affect the
immune system and how one
identical twin can have aller
gies while his or her sibling
doesn't. The researchers have
also experimented with vari

ous treatment strategies.
"We look at different thera
peutic methods, from having a
patch on the skin or under
neath the tongue, to swallow
ing the allergen to build resist
ance," Nadeau said.
According to Rosa Bac
chetta, a visiting lecturer in im
munology and allergy who
works with Nadeau, collabora
tion and discussion are com
mon in Nadeau's lab, and
Nadeau often solicits advice
from other members of the
Stanford community.
"She is very expert in im
munological techniques, but
she also collaborates with
many different groups here at
Stanford," Bacchetta
said. "It's really interesting to
combine different ways of
thinking, different technolo
gies and different types of
study in the work."
Nadeau stressed that OIT
is still in an experimental stage
and said that though she is ex
cited about the results of the
trials thus far, she and her re
searchers have to be "extreme
ly careful."
"The patient might take
that peanut and not have that
reaction," Nadeau said. "But
after any one day without in
gesting that peanut, their re
sistance might collapse, and
they might have a reaction
again. It's not a cure because
they have to maintain the dose
of the allergen they eat every
day."
According to Nadeau, the
next step in developing OIT in
cludes conducting multiple
studies with many more pa
tients in order to improve diag
nostics and make new thera
pies as safe and effective as
possible.
Despite the room for fur
ther advances, Grosso said
that Nadeau's work with OIT
has already significantly im
pacted many families with chil
dren that suffer from life
threatening allergies.
"She is an angel," Grosso
said about Nadeau. "She is the
first doctor that has given fami
lies with food allergies hope.
Working closely with Kari
makes me more assured that
my child is safe."
