## Med School profs track drug interactions through search engines 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A research team headed by two
School of Medicine professors has
developed a new method for track
ing adverse drug interactions using
queries from Internet search en
gines like Google and Bing. The
team's discovery offers an alterna
tive to the Food and Drug Adminis
tration's (FDA) Adverse Event Re
porting System (AERS).
According to Nicholas Tatonetti
M.S. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l2, a co-author of
the study and a professor of bio
medical informatics at Columbia
University, AERS is unreliable and
incomplete in monitoring drug
drug interactions. Tatonetti specifi
cally alleged that AERS has "too
much noise, too much bias and lots
of missing points."
He predicted that search logs

will eventually become the "great
est resource" in monitoring drug
safety, since they collect data from
millions of patients reporting how
they feel in a "completely honest
fashion."
"There's no clinician or physi
cian or drug company filtering re
sults before they become available
for research. It's a person at their
computer, trying to explain how
they feel," Tatonetti said. "That
honest info is much more powerful
than anything that the FDA or
some drug company could collect
about a drug."
Tatonetti and Russ Altman
Ph.D. 'B9 M.D. '9O, a co-author and
professor of bioengineering, genet
ics and medicine, had collaborated
on a previous study examining the
interaction between paroxetine, an
antidepressant, and pravastatin, a
statin, using data from AERS.

The study reported that when
taken together, the drugs could
cause hyperglycemia. Altman and
Tatonetti validated this finding
through a mouse model and an
analysis of electronic records from
hospitals around the country.
The discovery prompted the re
searchers to investigate other ways
to track drug-drug interactions,
something they discussed with Er
ic Horvitz Ph.D. '9l M.D. '94, a co
author and the director of Mi
crosoft Research Redmond, at the
2011 retreat for Stanford's gradu
ate program in biomedical infor
matics.
"We were literally sitting
around a campfire, wondering,
'Could we have seen this in Inter
net search logs?"' reflected Nigam
Shah, a co-author and a professor
of medicine.
Horvitz, who was a keynote

speaker at the conference, brought
the idea back to his colleagues at
Microsoft. They immediately "be
gan pursuing methods and tech
niques that might let us turn the
web into a sensor network for pub
lic health."
A new research team was
formed to conduct a second study,
using 82 million search queries
from over six million unique users
to examine whether or not users
who searched both "paroxetine"
and "pravastatin" were also likely
to search for "hyperglycemia" or
any of its symptoms. The search
queries were obtained from Mi
crosoft, who had gained permission
from some Internet Explorer users
to record searches on Bing, Google
and Yahoo.
While the researchers knew of
the adverse interaction between
paroxetine and pravastatin, they

were unsure of whether or not this
would be reflected in the search
logs.
"This is noisy information in
that people can search on drugs for
all sorts of things," Horvitz said.
"There could be a lot of false posi
tives and false negatives for diag
nosing the people taking these
drugs. In the large-scale analyses,
you hope that the signal can wash
over the noise and still impart some
significant information."
The researchers did ultimately
find significant information, with
one of 10 users who searched for
"paroxetine" and "pravastatin" also
searching for "hyperglycemia" or
one of its symptoms. By compari
son, only one of 20 users who
searched for "paroxetine" or
"pravastatin" alone searched for
