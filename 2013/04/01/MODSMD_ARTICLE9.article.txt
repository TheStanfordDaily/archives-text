## Med School profs track drug interactions through search engines 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A research team headed by two
School of Medicine professors has
developed a new method for track
ing adverse drug interactions using
queries from Internet search en
gines like Google and Bing. The
team's discovery offers an alterna
tive to the Food and Drug Adminis
tration's (FDA) Adverse Event Re
porting System (AERS).
According to Nicholas Tatonetti
M.S. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l2, a co-author of
the study and a professor of bio
medical informatics at Columbia
University, AERS is unreliable and
incomplete in monitoring drug
drug interactions. Tatonetti specifi
cally alleged that AERS has "too
much noise, too much bias and lots
of missing points."
He predicted that search logs

will eventually become the "great
est resource" in monitoring drug
safety, since they collect data from
millions of patients reporting how
they feel in a "completely honest
fashion."
"There's no clinician or physi
cian or drug company filtering re
sults before they become available
for research. It's a person at their
computer, trying to explain how
they feel," Tatonetti said. "That
honest info is much more powerful
than anything that the FDA or
some drug company could collect
about a drug."
Tatonetti and Russ Altman
Ph.D. 'B9 M.D. '9O, a co-author and
professor of bioengineering, genet
ics and medicine, had collaborated
on a previous study examining the
interaction between paroxetine, an
antidepressant, and pravastatin, a
statin, using data from AERS.

The study reported that when
taken together, the drugs could
cause hyperglycemia. Altman and
Tatonetti validated this finding
through a mouse model and an
analysis of electronic records from
hospitals around the country.
The discovery prompted the re
searchers to investigate other ways
to track drug-drug interactions,
something they discussed with Er
ic Horvitz Ph.D. '9l M.D. '94, a co
author and the director of Mi
crosoft Research Redmond, at the
2011 retreat for Stanford's gradu
ate program in biomedical infor
matics.
"We were literally sitting
around a campfire, wondering,
'Could we have seen this in Inter
net search logs?"' reflected Nigam
Shah, a co-author and a professor
of medicine.
Horvitz, who was a keynote

speaker at the conference, brought
the idea back to his colleagues at
Microsoft. They immediately "be
gan pursuing methods and tech
niques that might let us turn the
web into a sensor network for pub
lic health."
A new research team was
formed to conduct a second study,
using 82 million search queries
from over six million unique users
to examine whether or not users
who searched both "paroxetine"
and "pravastatin" were also likely
to search for "hyperglycemia" or
any of its symptoms. The search
queries were obtained from Mi
crosoft, who had gained permission
from some Internet Explorer users
to record searches on Bing, Google
and Yahoo.
While the researchers knew of
the adverse interaction between
paroxetine and pravastatin, they

were unsure of whether or not this
would be reflected in the search
logs.
"This is noisy information in
that people can search on drugs for
all sorts of things," Horvitz said.
"There could be a lot of false posi
tives and false negatives for diag
nosing the people taking these
drugs. In the large-scale analyses,
you hope that the signal can wash
over the noise and still impart some
significant information."
The researchers did ultimately
find significant information, with
one of 10 users who searched for
"paroxetine" and "pravastatin" also
searching for "hyperglycemia" or
one of its symptoms. By compari
son, only one of 20 users who
searched for "paroxetine" or
"pravastatin" alone searched for
"hyperglycemia" or its
symptoms.
Shah suggested that the
team test 62 other pairings
of drugs, half of which are
known to cause hyper
glycemia. The method of
tracking search queries was
successful 81 percent of the
time in predicting whether
or not a drug pairing would
cause hyperglycemia.
Tatonetti said that he was
not surprised by the
method's high success rate,
noting that online searches
for health concerns are very
common.
"It's exactly what people
do online when they feel sick
they type in search terms,
and they're looking for any
kind of explanation of why
they have these effects,"
Tatonetti said. "Sometimes

people also search for the
drugs they are on, because
their doctor prescribed
them, and they're wondering
if will it make them grow
warts on their head or some
thing."
However, Tatonetti said
that convincing the FDA to
use the search log method
has been "slow going."
"A lot of what the govern
ment does is a traditional
analysis they haven't
been too open to adopting
new approaches," Tatonetti
said. "We are constantly lob
bying the FDA and talking
to our friends at the FDA
and get them to use the new
approaches."
While the research team
has not yet been successful
in convincing the FDA to in
corporate search log results
into their analysis of drug
safety, they plan to apply the
search logs method to vari
ous other medical drugs and
devices.
Horvitz has already used

search logs on several
healthcare-related projects
and collaborated with Ryen
White, a co-author and a
senior researcher at Mi
crosoft Research Redmond,
and Robert West, a Ph.D.
candidate in the depart
ment of the computer sci
ence, on a new study using
web search results to gath
er insights on users' dietary
patterns based on what
recipes they downloaded on
line.
"The paper is all about
looking at public health is
sues by looking at download
ing recipes as a proxy for
shifts in food preferences
over time," he said. "We are
looking broadly at the web
as a sensor network."
A study detailing the
team's results was published
in the Journal of the Ameri
can Medical Informatics As
sociation on March 6.
