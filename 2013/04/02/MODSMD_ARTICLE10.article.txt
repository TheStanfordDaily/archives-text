About this time last year I
got exciting confirma
tion that I was going to
be volunteering in the
Olympic News Service
at the 2012 London Olympics. Crypti
cally I was due to work as a Flash
Quote Reporter at the BV competition
—it took me a while to figure out that
meant Beach Volleyball and even
longer to discover that my enviable
role meant I would be one of the first
people to chat with the athletes as they
left the court post game. Many other
volunteers never even got close to see
ing the inside of any of the venues.
11l admit, though, that there was an
initial hit of disappointment and some
teasing by my Mends: "Yeah, sure
they just randomly assigned you to the
sport with the most skimpily dressed
athletes." But most of all I was a little
daunted. Twelve months ago I knew
nothing, absolutely nothing, about
beach volleyball. I didn't even know
who Kerri Walsh Jennings 'OO was.
Him the clock forward a full year,
and things have gone full circle. Later
today, Stanford will host its inaugural
game in its newest varsity sport; at
3:30 p.m. the women's volleyball team
will switch from indoor to beach and
face Santa Clara in the opener of the
NCAA Sand —aka Beach—Volley
ball 2013 season.
In case you say don't care, or you
have the standard prejudice that beach
volleyball is more about the party than
the play, you're wrong. It is a bona fide
sport in spite of the beer and bikinis. If
you get the chance and can find it on
the TV or Internet somewhere, you
should watch a replay of last year's
Olympic men's final, perhaps one of the
best contests I've seen in any sport. I'm
a little bit biased not only was I
there and I got to interview the players
after the match, I also went and played
on the court late after the event was
over and the dust had settled —but
seriously, watch it.
I'm guessing that the women's final
got better coverage over here; it fea
tured two American teams, one of
which was the force of nature pairing
of Misty May-Treanor and Walsh Jen
nings. There were so many members
of the American press waiting to inter
view the players after the game that
the floor partially collapsed. As great
as it was to see them win their third
straight Olympic gold, though, they
clearly outclassed Jennifer Kessy and
April Ross. It really wasn't that close.
The men's final, however, had
everything. A No. 3 German team,
Julius Brink and Jonas Reekermann,
from a continent that had never won
Olympic gold in the event squaring up
against the No. 1 Brazilian team of Al
ison Cerutti and the legendary
Emanuel Rego. There were thrills,
spills, missed calls and impossible digs.
It was only right that the teams would
split the first two sets and treat us to a
tiebreak, though perhaps unfair that
one of these pairs had to walk away
with just silver; Emanuel was heart
broken yet magnanimous in defeat in
the post match media conference.
If you can watch that contest fiom
start to finish and not become beach
volleyball's newest devotee, you must
have a heart of stone.
Time has flown by since I walked
out of that deserted beach volleyball
stadium sometime in the early hours of
a morning way back in August. The
venue is long gone and it will be weird
to visit Horse Guards Parade the next
time I make it home. I haven't watched
a single minute of beach volleyball
since—writing and editing for The
Daily and working on a PhD in my
spare time, are not exactly conducive
to having tine to sleep, let alone any
thing else —but thankfully that streak
stops today
It was at the Olympics when I first
heard that the NCAA was putting its
support behind sand volleyball, but
that was long before it was confirmed
that Stanford would do the same.
My expectations might have been
built up slightly by watching Olympic
level beach volleyball and there are
surely going to be some growing pains
with this new sport. Even Walsh Jen
nings admitted that her first year
switching to sand was a humbling ex
perience, so the learning curve may be
pretty steep for the indoor players. It
also puts greater demand on the ath
letics budget and space on the sand
courts may be harder to get hold of, but
trust me on this, it'll be more than
worth it.
