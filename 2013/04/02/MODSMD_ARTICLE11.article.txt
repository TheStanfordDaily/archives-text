# Baseball squeaks by Cal
## Offense manages only two hits in victory 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
After a series victory at Washington
State to turn its recent skid around, the
rejuvenated Cardinal (14-9, 3-3 Pac-12)
returned to the friendly confines of
Sunken Diamond on Monday night for a
weeknight matchup against Cal (16-13,
5-4 Pac-12). Despite the bats falling close
to completely silent against Golden Bear
pitchers that had been struggling this
season, the Cardinal was able to cash in
on a timely home run to scrape by the
Bears by a final score of 4-3.

Last night marked the second meet
ing of the season between the cross-bay
rivals. In their first meeting in late Feb
ruary, it was the Bears' hitting that
failed to materialize, as four Cardinal
hurlers combined to shut the Cal squad
out while allowing only five hits. Their
counterpart on the mound, Cal lefty
starter Chris Muse-Fisher, could only
record one out as the Stanford hitters
greeted him with four hits and a sacri
fice bunt to score two runs in the first in
ning.
This time out, the tables were
turned. Muse-Fisher, making his first
start since the rivalry game of late Feb
ruary, entered the contest with a season
ERA of 7.71 in only 9.1 innings pitched.
The southpaw pitched much better this
time around, giving up only two hits,
walking one, and striking out three Car
dinal hitters in three innings of work.
Muse-Fisher made only one big mis
take in his outing. Unfortunately for the
sophomore, that mistake was tattooed
over the left-field fence.
Sophomore right fielder Austin
Slater, Stanford's leader in extra-base
hits, took full advantage of a strike three
wild pitch and a walk in the third inning
to put two Cardinal on with no hits by
clubbing the first pitch he saw over the
left-field fence, giving the Cardinal a 3-1
lead on its second and final hit of the
game.
"I'd hit a fastball the at bat before, so
I was thinking that they might start me
off with an off-speed pitch and they did,"
Slater said. "It was a changeup down
and in, I was looking for it, and I just
turned on it."
The Cardinal scraped another run
onto its lead without notching a hit just
one inning later when it strung together
a walk, sacrifice bunt, wild pitch and a
full-count sacrifice fly from sophomore
center fielder Dominic Jose.

The four runs and two
hits by the fourth inning ac
counted for all the offense
the Stanford hitters could
muster. But it was just
enough to reward a solid ef
fort by the pitching staff
with a victory.
"A lot of guys were squar
ing the ball up, you know, hit
ting it right to guys. I feel
like there were a couple of
guys that usually could have
had two or three hits today,
but you know, that's just how
the game is sometimes,"
Slater said. "Sometimes the
hits just don't fall."
The Cardinal pitching
staff did its job to protect the
lead, scattering eight hits
and holding the Golden Bear
offense to three runs despite
a shaky defense behind it
that committed three errors.
Cal left 12 runners on base,
showing that it had plenty of
opportunities to score runs
but was unable to capitalize
on enough of them.

Sophomore left-handed
pitcher John Hochstatter
earned his first win of the
season, giving up two
earned runs in four-plus sol
id innings of work. The
southpaw fanned three Bear
hitters but was chased after
he opened the fifth inning
by allowing two runners to
reach.
Sophomore David Schmidt,
junior Sam Lindquist, and jun
ior AJ Vanegas kept the
Bears at bay for the remain
der of the evening, combin
ing for five innings in which
they gave up only four hits
and one unearned run.
Vanegas was able to hold on
to the lead in the ninth in
ning, leaving the tying run
stranded on third as he
froze Cal third baseman
Chris Paul with a called
strike three.
The Cardinal next trav
els down to Los Angeles for
a three-game series against
the struggling USC Trojans.
Stanford has now won three
of its last four games after
dropping six of seven.
