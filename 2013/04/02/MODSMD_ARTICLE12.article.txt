# GAFFNEY, SKOV BACK IN PADS

### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
They're back.
Fifth-year seniors Tyler Gaffney and Shayne
Skov made their long-anticipated returns to the
gridiron Monday as Stanford football opened its
second and final two-week session of spring prac
tice.
For Gaffney, who shocked the baseball and foot
ball worlds when he announced his decision to take
time off from his professional baseball career to re
turn to Stanford football, it was his first day back
in pads in 15 months.
And with pads come hits.
"We were in thud and I got tackled," Gaffney
said. "But until then, I was kind of antsy for the
first contact. I didn't know if I was going to get
knocked on my butt. It could've been bad. I could
n't have that bad first impression."
Gaffney impressed in his first day. He had one
big run though head coach David Shaw pointed
out that "everybody was blocked" and was able
to keep his speed up at 220 pounds; in 2011, he

played at around 215 pounds.
Skov made some noise, literally, in his return.
The linebacker, known for his physical play, made a
big hit during the closed practice session, but the
victim remains anonymous.
"I'm not going to name names," Skov said, "but
it was exciting. First run period, I got an opportu
nity to lay some hat, so I got somebody pretty
good. I'll get it eventually... What goes around
comes around."
In his final year of spring practice, Skov is fo
cusing on the little things. The senior will be work
ing on pre-snap reads and keeping his eyes in the
right spot, among other small adjustments.
But Skov's return means a lot more than just
adding another starter to the deep linebacker
corps.
"Shayne knows what we need him for," Shaw
said. "We need him for leadership, we need his
emotional energy, we need him to be relentless.
Because he, for the last four years, he sets the tone
for this team emotionally. Not just the defense, for
