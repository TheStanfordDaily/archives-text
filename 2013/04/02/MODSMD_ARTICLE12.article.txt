# GAFFNEY, SKOV BACK IN PADS
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
They're back.
Fifth-year seniors Tyler Gaffney and Shayne
Skov made their long-anticipated returns to the
gridiron Monday as Stanford football opened its
second and final two-week session of spring prac
tice.
For Gaffney, who shocked the baseball and foot
ball worlds when he announced his decision to take
time off from his professional baseball career to re
turn to Stanford football, it was his first day back
in pads in 15 months.
And with pads come hits.
"We were in thud and I got tackled," Gaffney
said. "But until then, I was kind of antsy for the
first contact. I didn't know if I was going to get
knocked on my butt. It could've been bad. I could
n't have that bad first impression."
Gaffney impressed in his first day. He had one
big run though head coach David Shaw pointed
out that "everybody was blocked" and was able
to keep his speed up at 220 pounds; in 2011, he

played at around 215 pounds.
Skov made some noise, literally, in his return.
The linebacker, known for his physical play, made a
big hit during the closed practice session, but the
victim remains anonymous.
"I'm not going to name names," Skov said, "but
it was exciting. First run period, I got an opportu
nity to lay some hat, so I got somebody pretty
good. I'll get it eventually... What goes around
comes around."
In his final year of spring practice, Skov is fo
cusing on the little things. The senior will be work
ing on pre-snap reads and keeping his eyes in the
right spot, among other small adjustments.
But Skov's return means a lot more than just
adding another starter to the deep linebacker
corps.
"Shayne knows what we need him for," Shaw
said. "We need him for leadership, we need his
emotional energy, we need him to be relentless.
Because he, for the last four years, he sets the tone
for this team emotionally. Not just the defense, for

the team emotionally. And he
gave us that today."
With Gaffney and Skov
back, Shaw and Stanford will
turn their attention to "situa
tional football."
The coaching staff em
phasized that the first spring
practice session would focus
on getting players to play
fast and evaluating players
at different positions. But
the second session will be a
much more cerebral chal
lenge.

"Situational football wins
games," Shaw said. "So we
don't ever want to come out
here and just run plays. We
put the base stuff in the first

session, the second session
is, in my opinion, what wins
games: third down percent
age, red zone touchdown per
centage, short yardage and
goal line... That's what wins
football games, so that's
what this session is going to
be heavy on."
That isn't to say that the
second session is devoid of
physical challenges. One of
the biggest advantages
Stanford's staff feels it gains
from the split spring prac
tice is that they can go full
speed much more frequently
in the spring than most oth
er teams.
With that attitude in
mind, the Cardinal will be
back in full pads again at
practice today. For a team
coming off of a three-week
break from football or
much longer for Gaffney and

Skov that could be a chal
lenge.
"In order to be any good
at football," Shaw said,
"you've got to fight through
stuff and this will be our first
something that guys have to
fight through; second prac
tice of spring, and I will be
watching closely to see who
fights through and who
backs off."
Stanford will host an
open practice Saturday from
10:30 a.m. to 12:50 p.m. at
the Dan Elliott Practice
Fields. It will be the last
open practice before Stan
ford wraps up its spring ses
sion with the Cardinal &
White Spring Game on April
13 at 3 p.m. at Stanford Sta
