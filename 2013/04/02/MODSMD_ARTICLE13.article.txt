No. 12 UCLA (25-8, 2-4 Pac-12). In the
process, the Cardinal improved to an impres

game victories. Overall, Gerhart yielded only
three runs over the course of the three game
series, pitching 15.1 solid innings for the Car
dinal while holding her ERA at 1.38.
Gerhart was particularly effective in limit
ing the damage from extra-base hits during
the series. Though UCLA is second in the
Pac-12 in home runs, the Bruins could man
