# Gerhart shines
## 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
For the Stanford Softball team, there is
certainly no place like home and nothing bet
ter than getting to play in front of its fans. Af
ter a tough series against Oregon, which saw
the Card cough up late leads in two consecu
tive games, No. 15 Stanford (24-9,2-4 Pac-12)
recovered to take two of three games from
No. 12 UCLA (25-8, 2-4 Pac-12). In the
process, the Cardinal improved to an impres
sive 13-1 at home on the season.

Against a Bruins team that has relied on
power hitting and the long ball all season,
Stanford claimed two victories with outstand
ing starting pitching from senior Teagan Ger
hart. In those two contests, the Norco, Calif,
product allowed only one earned run in four
teen innings of work to earn two complete
game victories. Overall, Gerhart yielded only
three runs over the course of the three game
series, pitching 15.1 solid innings for the Car
dinal while holding her ERA at 1.38.
Gerhart was particularly effective in limit
ing the damage from extra-base hits during
the series. Though UCLA is second in the
Pac-12 in home runs, the Bruins could man
age only one solo shot off Gerhart in her 15-
plus innings. Gerhart was at her best in the fi
nale on Saturday afternoon, when the Bruins

failed to manage a single ex
tra-base hit; Gerhart scat
tered five singles in the com
plete-game shutout.
Scoring twelve runs in
three games, Stanford's of
fense was also productive
against UCLA. The offen
sive output was very bal
anced, as six different Car
dinal hitters knocked in
runs during the series.
Freshman Jessica Plaza led
the way with three RBI,
while fellow freshman Kay
la Bonstrom added two RBI
of her own.
Plaza, a Huntington
Beach, Calif, native, has
made the most of her limited
plate appearances. A recent
selection to participate with
the United States U-19 Na
tional Team in the 2013 ISF
Junior Women's Softball
World Championships this
summer in Canada, Plaza
has an astounding 14 RBI in
only 53 at bats.
Plaza's insertion into the
starting lineup has given op
portunities to other Cardinal
batters. In response to her
production, opposing pitchers
have now been forced to pitch
to sophomore Cassandra
Roulund and senior Jenna
Rich, two of the Cardinal's
best hitters, lest they give
Plaza an opportunity to hit
with multiple runners on
base.
With the first two series
of Pac-12 play now complete,
the Cardinal will travel to
Corvallis, Ore. for a rare
midweek series against No.
23 Oregon State (23-9, 0-3
Pac-12). Though Oregon
State is among the confer
ence leaders in team batting

average with a .312 mark,
fielding and consistent pitch
ing have been struggles for
the Beavers. Oregon State
has committed the second
most errors per game in the
Pac-12 while also holding a
tie for the second worst
fielding percentage in the
conference with Arizona.
With Stanford's team speed
on the base paths, Oregon
State's fielders will be under
even more pressure to deliv
er on-time and accurate
throws.
In addition to their field
ing woes, the Beavers have
also struggled on the
mound; Oregon State holds
the third worst ERA in the
Pac-12 at 3.00. These pitch
ing deficiencies were magni
fied in a recent series
against national champi
onship contender Arizona
State, when the No. 2 Sun
Devils pounded 21 runs
against the Beavers in a
three-game sweep. Oregon
State's pitching bottomed
out in Saturday's finale in an
11-0 shellacking at the hands
of Sun Devils.
Stanford pitchers Gerhart,
freshman Kelsey Stevens
and sophomore Nyree
White will have to be mind
ful in the circle when they
match up against Oregon
State's Natalie Hampton, a
star freshman from Ante
lope, Calif. Hampton has al
ready emerged as one of the
elite hitters in the Pac-12,
batting .394 with 10 home
runs and 37 RBI in 99 at
bats.
Stanford will match up
with Oregon State in a Tues

IAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
Senior starting pitcher Teagan Gerhart (above)
picked up both of Stanford's wins over UCLA this
weekend with dominant complete-game outings.
The senior improved her season record to 13-4.
failed to manage a single ex
tra-base hit; Gerhart scat
tered five singles in the com
plete-game shutout.
Scoring twelve runs in
three games, Stanford's of
fense was also productive
against UCLA. The offen
sive output was very bal
anced, as six different Car
dinal hitters knocked in
runs during the series.
Freshman Jessica Plaza led
the way with three RBI,
while fellow freshman Kay
la Bonstrom added two RBI
of her own.
Plaza, a Huntington
Beach, Calif, native, has
made the most of her limited
plate appearances. A recent
selection to participate with
the United States U-19 Na
tional Team in the 2013 ISF
Junior Women's Softball
World Championships this
summer in Canada, Plaza
has an astounding 14 RBI in
only 53 at bats.
Plaza's insertion into the
starting lineup has given op
portunities to other Cardinal
batters. In response to her
production, opposing pitchers
have now been forced to pitch
to sophomore Cassandra
Roulund and senior Jenna
Rich, two of the Cardinal's
best hitters, lest they give
Plaza an opportunity to hit
with multiple runners on
base.
With the first two series
of Pac-12 play now complete,
the Cardinal will travel to
Corvallis, Ore. for a rare
midweek series against No.
23 Oregon State (23-9, 0-3
Pac-12). Though Oregon
State is among the confer
ence leaders in team batting

average with a .312 mark,
fielding and consistent pitch
ing have been struggles for
the Beavers. Oregon State
has committed the second
most errors per game in the
Pac-12 while also holding a
tie for the second worst
fielding percentage in the
conference with Arizona.
With Stanford's team speed
on the base paths, Oregon
State's fielders will be under
even more pressure to deliv
er on-time and accurate
throws.
In addition to their field
ing woes, the Beavers have
also struggled on the
mound; Oregon State holds
the third worst ERA in the
Pac-12 at 3.00. These pitch
ing deficiencies were magni
fied in a recent series
against national champi
onship contender Arizona
State, when the No. 2 Sun
Devils pounded 21 runs
against the Beavers in a
three-game sweep. Oregon
State's pitching bottomed
out in Saturday's finale in an
11-0 shellacking at the hands
of Sun Devils.
Stanford pitchers Gerhart,
freshman Kelsey Stevens
and sophomore Nyree
White will have to be mind
ful in the circle when they
match up against Oregon
State's Natalie Hampton, a
star freshman from Ante
lope, Calif. Hampton has al
ready emerged as one of the
elite hitters in the Pac-12,
batting .394 with 10 home
runs and 37 RBI in 99 at
bats.
Stanford will match up
with Oregon State in a Tues
day doubleheader starting at
12 p.m. The teams will then
meet at 12 p.m. Wednesday
for the series finale.
