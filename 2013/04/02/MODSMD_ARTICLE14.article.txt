## Tough road trip awaits reeling Card Stanford looks to end four-game skid 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
Fresh off two disappointing home loss
es, Stanford men's volleyball is back on
the road this week to take on Pacific, UC-
Irvine and UC-San Diego. Stanford is
currently in the midst of its longest slump
of the season, having dropped its past four
games, but will be looking to turn things
around in a major fashion this week in or
der to make a final MPSF playoff push.
The No. 8 Cardinal (12-10, 9-10 MPSF)
will first travel down to face Pacific (7-16,
4-15 MPSF). In the teams' first meeting
of the season, the Cardinal was able to
prevail 3-2 and will look to do the same
this week. The Tigers are fresh off a win
against Cal State Northridge, but they
had lost 13 of their past 14 games previ
ously.
Pacific is led on offense by senior out
side hitter Taylor Hughes, who is fifth in
the MPSF in kills per set at 4.00. The
Tiger attack lacks much depth beyond
Hughes, however, as Pacific sits second to
last in the MPSF in hitting percentage,
third to last in assists and
fourth to last in kills per set.
The Tigers also rank last in
aces, averaging just 0.59 per
set.
While it might be weak
offensively, Pacific does
boast a strong defensive
presence. Pacific sits third in
the MPSF in blocks, with
two middle blockers, senior
Christian Ahlin and sopho
more Tommy Carmody, sit
ting in the top 15 in the con
ference in blocks per set. At
the same time, junior libero
Javier Caeeres leads the
MPSF in digs per set, and
the Tigers rank second in
the MPSF in digs.
After meeting the Tigers
on Tuesday, Stanford will
have a short break before
facing No. 4 UC-Irvine (18-
6, 15-6 MPSF) on Friday.
The Anteaters defeated the
Cardinal 3-1 in their last
meeting but have been
struggling somewhat as of
late, going just 3-3 in their
past six games.
UC-Irvine has a number
of strong offensive players,
but perhaps its most danger
ous is senior outside hitter
Kevin Tillie. Tillie sits eighth
in the MPSF at 3.84 kills per
set and has given Stanford
trouble in the past, putting
up 18 kills on .531 hitting in
the teams' first meeting.
The Anteaters are an
chored on defense by sopho
more libero Michael Brink
ley, who ranks second in the
MPSF in digs per set. Tillie
is also capable defensively,
ranking ninth in the same
category. As such, UC-
Irvine holds opponents to
the third lowest hitting per

centage in the MPSF.
The Anteaters also boast
strong net defense, ranking
fifth in the MSPF in blocks
per game. Junior middle
blocker Collin Mehring, who
is fifth in the individual cate
gory, put up impressive num
bers in his last game against
Stanford. Mehring, who
ranks second in the MSPF in
hitting percentage behind

only his fellow Anteater jun
ior middle blocker Scott
Kevorken, had nine kills on
.667 hitting as well as three
blocks.
Stanford will close out its
road trip Saturday night
against UC-San Diego (7-18,
4-16 MPSF). The Tritons are
last in the MPSF and were
swept in their last meeting
with Stanford, but they

could still prove to be trou
ble. They took UC-Irvine to
five sets in their last match
and were able to pull out a
win over USC just two
games before.
The Tritons are the weak
est offensive team in the
MPSF, hitting just .211 on
the year, and are second to
last with an average of 11.57
kills per set. The Tritons
were held to just .181 hitting
in their last matchup with
Stanford, although junior
middle blocker Fred Stahl
did post 10 kills on .300 hit
ting. Stahl ranks 12th in the
MPSF in blocks per game
and is definitely a force to be
reckoned with at the net.
Overall, this is a crucial
weekend for the Cardinal.
Stanford currently sits
eighth in the MPSF. At this
point, Stanford seems very
unlikely to receive an at
large bid to the NCAA tour
nament, so its only hope for a
shot at the national champi
onship is to win the MPSF
tournament.
The top eight teams at
the end of conference play
qualify for the MPSF tour
nament, so Stanford needs
to start winning in order to
stay in front of Cal State
Northridge, which sits just a
half-game back.
