## WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE Depression, It's for Everyone (Part II) 
### Chris Herries 
My last piece detailed how
signs of depression may dif
fer in men, making depres
sion harder to identify. It discussed
how typical "boys will be boys"
things like chinking, unsafe sex and
risky behavior may be manifesta
tions of an underlying depression.
This piece will focus more on my ex
periences talking to depressed men
and on potential ways to help some
one in need.
The most important thing to do is
identify someone with a problem.
This is easier said than done, particu
larly in a place like Stanford where
people are adept at hiding their prob
lems. I hope my last piece is helpful
in this regard.
It is equally important, however,
to be attuned to a person's behavior.
The difference between a lot of
drinking and unsafe drinking is blur
ry, especially since everyone handles
their alcohol in a different way. Like
wise, introversion versus extrover
sion is an experience different for
every person. If your guy friend who
used to party with you every week
end suddenly wants to stay inside,
that is a potential problem. Likewise,
if a more conservative drinker sud
denly starts raging, it is time to talk.
There is nothing wrong with behav
ioral changes for the better, but when
someone changes in an unhealthy
way you need to step in and provide
support. Identification of a problem
is the sine qua non of mental health.
Let's say you think your friend is
having a problem; now what? Well,
ignoring the problem is not healthy
for anyone. It is important to articu
late your concern in a private conver
sation. Most guys walk through life
thinking they do not have any prob
lems, so being confronted by a friend
will be tough. They might get defen
sive or clam up; very few sober guys
will be effusive with their emotions.
Therefore, it's important that you
plan for these sorts of things by re
hearsing with yourself or another
friend. I find it important to remem
ber that my job is to try to help peo
ple but that ultimately I can't force
someone to seek help. So make your
self available and listen attentively to
whatever he has to say. There's no
need to invalidate emotions or guilt
him (at this point) into seeking more
professional help. Just listen and ask
the occasional facilitating question.
There's no need to ask why he feels a
certain way or why he's behaving like
that. Just listen.

Ultimately, you'll want your
friend to seek more professional
help. Guys who buy hearily into mas
culine culture won't be happy to. Typ
ically, using "I" language and ex
pressing your honest concern, while

providing resources, is the best you
can do: "I feel like you've been really
withdrawn lately, which concerns me
because you're usually so upbeat. If
you're not feeling well, I'd like to
help. I would appreciate it if you
reached out to CAPS or the Bridge
to talk to someone." If he takes your
advice, then great; if not, that's fine
too. At least someone tried to help. I
firmly believe it is a friend's job to ex
press concern and help and that oth
erwise it's not a friendship.
People will immediately point out
that this is the way to approach any
one you think has a problem, not just
guys. This is true to an extent, how
ever there are some intangible things
you need to understand about male
culture before you can help a guy. For
certain guys, masculinity is every
thing. It's part of our daily lives, our
conversations, our compliments and
our insults. A lot of men gauge their
self-worth based on perceived mas
culinity. And a part of the masculine
perception is durability and self-re
liance.
What I mean by those two things
is the idea that a "manly man"
shouldn't have problems and that if
he does, he should be able to solve
them on his own. Debating the mer
its or failings of traditional masculin
ity is a subject for a different column;
nonetheless, it's important to under
stand that culture if you're not a part
of it. Suffice it to say, a lot of guys will
be disinclined to seek help as a result
of these cultural assumptions. This
disinclination needs to be understood
and planned for.
I hope this piece and its predeces
sor have been helpful in addressing
depression in male culture. I've
found many people unable to com
prehend, or unwilling to confront, the
effects of conventional masculinity.
However, it's important to "meet
people where they're at," especially
when dealing with sensitive subjects
like mental health. I hope these
columns can help you identify, talk to
and empathize with friends in need.
