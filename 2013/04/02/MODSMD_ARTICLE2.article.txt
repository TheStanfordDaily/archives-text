## Chappie locked out of office Conduct breaches prompt SAL review, hearing process 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Staffers of The Stanford Chap
arral, a campus humor magazine,
have been excluded from their of
fice since Nov. 28 in an ongoing dis
pute with Student Activities and
Leadership (SAL), according to the
Chaparral's Co-Editor in Chief
Kian Ameli 'l3.
The Chaparral has occupied
rooms 104 and 105 in the Nitery
since 2005, when staff members
signed a contract with Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Greg Boardman.
According to Ameli, the contract
states that the Chaparral's staff
can occupy the office as long as the
magazine publishes new issues and
staff members do not "egregiously
violate expected conduct."
Ameli said that SAL first be
came concerned with potential
shortcomings in conduct after an
alcohol-related incident at the
Chaparral's office on Nov. 7.
"One of our members had come
into the office and he had been
drinking recklessly," Ameli said.
"He was found there in the morn
ing by the custodial staff. That obvi
ously created a great deal of con
cern for SAL."
After the office was broken into
over Thanksgiving break and
SAL administrators discovered
that the door code had not been
changed in eight years they
changed the code to lock out Chap
arral staff members.
"That issue was sort of conflated
with the earlier one involving our
member [in November]," Ameli
said. "[SAL] decided that we would
be suspended from the office until a
few other conditions were met."
SAL Director Nanci Howe and
Lee Connor, senior administrative
officer for the Vice Provost of Stu
dent Affairs, both declined to com
ment.
Ameli met with Director of Op
erations and Student Unions
Jeanette Smith-Laws and Howe at
the beginning of winter quarter, in
a meeting at which the Chaparral's
return to the office was linked to
writing a formal document binding
the Chaparral's staff to observing
University policies, including the
Stanford Student Alcohol Policy.
The document would also establish
a protocol for communication be
tween the Chaparral and adminis
trators to minimize confusion over
expectations for staffers.
"There were a lot of policies that
were said to be in place that never
were," Ameli said. "Not University
policies but specific building things
or things that we weren't really clear
had ever existed or we were pretty
sure hadn't ever existed but we were
being told that they had."

According to Ameli, The Chap
arral was also asked to create an
office management plan, with
Smith-Laws and Howe describing
the office as "filthy" and advancing
a "culture of messiness."
While Ameli said that the Chap
arral expects to regain access to
the offices early this quarter, he
complained that the lengthy exclu
sion had detrimentally affected the
staff's writing process and compli
cated scheduling meetings.
"Especially with something like
humor writing, it's a drawn out, col
laborative process, and there needs
to be a central place where we're
meeting at," Ameli said. "Meeting
in somebody's room or in a comput
er cluster where people could be
working isn't really best suited to
telling jokes."

Ameli also expressed dissatis
faction with the University's han
dling of the situation, questioning
whether appropriate protocol had
been observed before Chaparral
staffers were barred from the of
fice.
"The problem is that there was
no due process in this decision,"
Ameli said. "It was very unilateral
and there hadn't been a hearing at
the point at which they suspended
us from the office."
Although two hearings have
since taken place on Feb. 20 and
on March 6 the panel's findings
are confidential and have yet to be
approved by Dean of Student Life
Chris Griffith, according to Ameli.
