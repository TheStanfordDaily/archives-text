## Chappie locked out of office Conduct breaches prompt SAL review, hearing process 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Staffers of The Stanford Chap
arral, a campus humor magazine,
have been excluded from their of
fice since Nov. 28 in an ongoing dis
pute with Student Activities and
Leadership (SAL), according to the
Chaparral's Co-Editor in Chief
Kian Ameli 'l3.
The Chaparral has occupied
rooms 104 and 105 in the Nitery
since 2005, when staff members
signed a contract with Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Greg Boardman.
According to Ameli, the contract
states that the Chaparral's staff
can occupy the office as long as the
magazine publishes new issues and
staff members do not "egregiously
violate expected conduct."
Ameli said that SAL first be
came concerned with potential
shortcomings in conduct after an
alcohol-related incident at the
Chaparral's office on Nov. 7.
"One of our members had come
into the office and he had been
drinking recklessly," Ameli said.
"He was found there in the morn
ing by the custodial staff. That obvi
ously created a great deal of con
cern for SAL."
After the office was broken into
over Thanksgiving break and
SAL administrators discovered
that the door code had not been
changed in eight years they
changed the code to lock out Chap
arral staff members.
"That issue was sort of conflated
with the earlier one involving our
member [in November]," Ameli
said. "[SAL] decided that we would
be suspended from the office until a
few other conditions were met."
SAL Director Nanci Howe and
Lee Connor, senior administrative
officer for the Vice Provost of Stu
dent Affairs, both declined to com
ment.
Ameli met with Director of Op
erations and Student Unions
Jeanette Smith-Laws and Howe at
the beginning of winter quarter, in
a meeting at which the Chaparral's
return to the office was linked to
writing a formal document binding
