# Stanford law school students support brief in DOMA case
## 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
As the Supreme Court turned its attention
last week to gay marriage and the 1996 Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA), Stanford Law School
students played a central role in securing support
for an amicus brief deployed in oral arguments
against DOMA in United States v. Windsor.
DOMA, a federal law that restricts federal
benefits and denies interstate recognition to
same-sex marriages, has been found unconstitu
tional by several lower courts. In Windsor, a
coalition of prominent military and national secu
rity officials submitted a brief addressing the leg
islation's impact on the military.

"DOMA violates the military's ... commit
ment to provide for all service members and their
families," reads Section II of the brief, which was
written by the Washington, D.C.-based law firm
Sidley Austin LLP "There is no question that
DOMA discriminates against certain legally mar
ried service members and veterans and their
families."
The brief identified healthcare, housing, edu
cation and survivorship benefits as some of the
areas in which DOMA allegedly discriminates
against gay and lesbian service members, and it
claimed that DOMA has a negative effect on re
cruiting efforts, constituting "an affront to core
military values."
"What is driving this from our perspective

and our clients' perspective is we are talking
about people who serve and sacrifice and whose
families sacrifice so much for our country," said
J.E Schnapper-Casteras 'O5 M.A. 'O5 J.D. 'OB, an
associate at Sidley Austin who was heavily in
volved in the writing of the brief. "There's a core
feeling that they deserve to get the same benefits
as everyone else, regardless of their sexual orien
tation."

Protestors congregate outside of the Supreme Court during the United States v. Windsor proceedings last week in Washington, D.C.
The outcome of the landmark case will likely determine the constitutionality of the Clinton Administration's 1996 Defense of Marriage Act.
