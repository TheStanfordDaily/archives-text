# Stanford law school students support brief in DOMA case
## 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
As the Supreme Court turned its attention
last week to gay marriage and the 1996 Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA), Stanford Law School
students played a central role in securing support
for an amicus brief deployed in oral arguments
against DOMA in United States v. Windsor.
DOMA, a federal law that restricts federal
benefits and denies interstate recognition to
same-sex marriages, has been found unconstitu
tional by several lower courts. In Windsor, a
coalition of prominent military and national secu
rity officials submitted a brief addressing the leg
islation's impact on the military.

"DOMA violates the military's ... commit
ment to provide for all service members and their
families," reads Section II of the brief, which was
written by the Washington, D.C.-based law firm
Sidley Austin LLP "There is no question that
DOMA discriminates against certain legally mar
ried service members and veterans and their
families."
The brief identified healthcare, housing, edu
cation and survivorship benefits as some of the
areas in which DOMA allegedly discriminates
against gay and lesbian service members, and it
claimed that DOMA has a negative effect on re
cruiting efforts, constituting "an affront to core
military values."
"What is driving this from our perspective

and our clients' perspective is we are talking
about people who serve and sacrifice and whose
families sacrifice so much for our country," said
J.E Schnapper-Casteras 'O5 M.A. 'O5 J.D. 'OB, an
associate at Sidley Austin who was heavily in
volved in the writing of the brief. "There's a core
feeling that they deserve to get the same benefits
as everyone else, regardless of their sexual orien
tation."

plaintiff's legal team in Windsor, reached out to

him to help garner support
and signatories for the brief.
Klonoski, a Navy veteran,
had helped found the Stan
ford Law Veterans Organiza
tion.
Along with several other
students, Klonoski sent out
emails asking members of the
Stanford community to pres
ent the brief to military offi
cials across the country in an
effort to secure their signa
tures. Thirty individuals and
two military support organi
zations ultimately signed the
brief.
"The group at Stanford is
a really tangled and wide
ranging network of people
that know people that are im
portant," Klonoski said.
"Even if people don't neces
sarily know admirals and gen
erals at Stanford, they
worked for people at other
places so they often asked
their own bosses and engaged
a lot of people they knew."
The students' efforts ini
tially targeted Stanford
based officials such as former
Special Assistant to the Pres
ident for National Security
Affairs Coit Blacker, former
Ambassador to Afghanistan
Karl Eikenberry M.A. '94
Ph.D. 'l3, former Senator
Russ Feingold, former Secre
tary of Defense William Per
ry '49 M.S. '5O, former Secre
tary of State Condoleezza
Rice, retired Admiral Gary
Roughead and former Secre
tary of State George Shultz.
Of that group, Blacker, Fein
gold and Perry signed the
brief.

Feingold, who said that it
is "absolutely clear that DO
MA discriminates against
legally married service mem
bers," was one of 14 senators
to vote against DOMA in
1996.
"It's well past time for the
Court to reverse a statute
that has caused so much pain
because of a shameful mo
ment of political expediency,"
Feingold wrote in a statement
in which he called the legisla
tion a "hateful measure."
According to Klonoski,
students and veterans at peer
institutions like Harvard,
Princeton and Yale also
worked to secure support for
the brief.
"What's really unique
about this case is that it's a
coalition of individuals, not a
preset institution," Schnap
per-Casteras noted. "It's
folks that we had to corral
from all walks of life and
speak with them and get
them to sign on."
Klonoski framed the
process of gathering signa
tures as a "huge social net
work experiment," with a
positive outcome emerging
from the connection between
Stanford and the military.
"There are liberals who
care a lot about these issues
and veterans, who are more
likely to be conservative,"
Klonoski said. "These two
groups are supposedly anti
thetical, but here the synergy
of having them in the same
place was, to me, really won
derful."
The Supreme Court is ex
pected to release its verdict
on United States v. Wind
sor in June.

written by the Washington, D.C.-based law firm
Sidley Austin LLP "There is no question that
DOMA discriminates against certain legally mar
ried service members and veterans and their
families."
The brief identified healthcare, housing, edu
cation and survivorship benefits as some of the
areas in which DOMA allegedly discriminates
against gay and lesbian service members, and it
claimed that DOMA has a negative effect on re
cruiting efforts, constituting "an affront to core
military values."
"What is driving this from our perspective

and our clients' perspective is we are talking
about people who serve and sacrifice and whose
families sacrifice so much for our country," said
J.E Schnapper-Casteras 'O5 M.A. 'O5 J.D. 'OB, an
associate at Sidley Austin who was heavily in
volved in the writing of the brief. "There's a core
feeling that they deserve to get the same benefits
as everyone else, regardless of their sexual orien
tation."
Soliciting support

plaintiff's legal team in Windsor, reached out to

him to help garner support
and signatories for the brief.
Klonoski, a Navy veteran,
had helped found the Stan
ford Law Veterans Organiza
tion.
Along with several other
students, Klonoski sent out
emails asking members of the
Stanford community to pres
ent the brief to military offi
cials across the country in an
effort to secure their signa
tures. Thirty individuals and
two military support organi
zations ultimately signed the
brief.
"The group at Stanford is
a really tangled and wide
ranging network of people
that know people that are im
portant," Klonoski said.
"Even if people don't neces
sarily know admirals and gen
erals at Stanford, they
worked for people at other
places so they often asked
their own bosses and engaged
a lot of people they knew."
The students' efforts ini
tially targeted Stanford
based officials such as former
Special Assistant to the Pres
ident for National Security
Affairs Coit Blacker, former
Ambassador to Afghanistan
Karl Eikenberry M.A. '94
Ph.D. 'l3, former Senator
Russ Feingold, former Secre
tary of Defense William Per
ry '49 M.S. '5O, former Secre
tary of State Condoleezza
Rice, retired Admiral Gary
Roughead and former Secre
tary of State George Shultz.
Of that group, Blacker, Fein
gold and Perry signed the
brief.

Feingold, who said that it
is "absolutely clear that DO
MA discriminates against
legally married service mem
bers," was one of 14 senators
to vote against DOMA in
1996.
"It's well past time for the
Court to reverse a statute
that has caused so much pain
because of a shameful mo
ment of political expediency,"
Feingold wrote in a statement
in which he called the legisla
tion a "hateful measure."
According to Klonoski,
students and veterans at peer
institutions like Harvard,
Princeton and Yale also
worked to secure support for
the brief.
"What's really unique
about this case is that it's a
coalition of individuals, not a
preset institution," Schnap
per-Casteras noted. "It's
folks that we had to corral
from all walks of life and
speak with them and get
them to sign on."
Klonoski framed the
process of gathering signa
tures as a "huge social net
work experiment," with a
positive outcome emerging
from the connection between
Stanford and the military.
"There are liberals who
care a lot about these issues
and veterans, who are more
likely to be conservative,"
Klonoski said. "These two
groups are supposedly anti
thetical, but here the synergy
of having them in the same
place was, to me, really won
derful."
The Supreme Court is ex
pected to release its verdict
on United States v. Wind
sor in June.
