## Creative Writing Program celebrates history 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a bustling startup culture and a loca
tion at the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford's
reputation as a "techie" school is incomparable.
The University's offerings at the other end of
the academic spectrum in creative writing
may, however, be the object of equal acclaim,
and even more heritage.
This year marks the 67th anniversary of

Stanford's Creative Writing Program and the
Wallace Stegner Fellowship, the second-oldest
fellowship of its kind in the country. The Stegn
er Fellowship, founded by renowned novelist
and former Stanford professor Wallace Stegner
in 1946, provides financial and artistic support
for up-and-coming writers.
According to Scott Hutchins, a lecturer in
the program, the fellowship was created by
Stegner as away of providing a creative outlet
to soldiers returning from World War 11.

"Stegner saw the Gls coming back after
World War II and felt like there needed to be a
writing fellowship for them to be a part of,"
Hutchins said. "They were a little bit older than
most college students and had stories to tell."
Tom Kealey, another lecturer in the depart
ment, said that the fellowship offers a unique
opportunity for young winters to develop their
craft in an encouraging but rigorous setting.
