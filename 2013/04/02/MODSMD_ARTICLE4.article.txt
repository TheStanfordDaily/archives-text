# ACADEMICS
## Creative Writing Program celebrates history 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a bustling startup culture and a loca
tion at the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford's
reputation as a "techie" school is incomparable.
The University's offerings at the other end of
the academic spectrum in creative writing
may, however, be the object of equal acclaim,
and even more heritage.
This year marks the 67th anniversary of

Stanford's Creative Writing Program and the
Wallace Stegner Fellowship, the second-oldest
fellowship of its kind in the country. The Stegn
er Fellowship, founded by renowned novelist
and former Stanford professor Wallace Stegner
in 1946, provides financial and artistic support
for up-and-coming writers.
According to Scott Hutchins, a lecturer in
the program, the fellowship was created by
Stegner as away of providing a creative outlet
to soldiers returning from World War 11.

"Stegner saw the Gls coming back after
World War II and felt like there needed to be a
writing fellowship for them to be a part of,"
Hutchins said. "They were a little bit older than
most college students and had stories to tell."
Tom Kealey, another lecturer in the depart
ment, said that the fellowship offers a unique
opportunity for young winters to develop their
craft in an encouraging but rigorous setting.
"[Stegner] designed the pro
gram for people in their 20s and 30s
to come to Stanford for a year or
two to work on their own writings,"
Kealey said.
The 10 Stegner fellows five
fiction writers and five poets are
chosen from about 2,000 applicants
and come to Stanford to work on
their writing for two years.
"They're really just beginning
their careers," Kealey added. "They
get to be here and take workshops
with amazing writers and with each
other. They really get to concentrate
on then* own writing."
Some fellowship graduates stay
close to the Farm. Kealey, Hutchins
and Tobias Wolff M.A. '7B, another
professor in the program, were all
once Stegner fellows.
Hutchins said that his time as a
Stegner fellow compelled him to
stay at the University as an instruc
tor despite his busy schedule as a
professional writer.
"I came as a Stegner fellow,
which was a great blessing and a
wonderful surprise, and I stayed
for a lot of reasons," Hutchins said.
"This is a really supportive environ
ment. You get to work with writers
you admire, the teaching is taken
incredibly seriously and the pro
gram is supportive of us as teachers
and artists."
Rather than being a graduate
program in creative writing, Wolff
characterized the fellowship as an
association for creative minds and a
program that despite various
leadership changes over the years
has retained much of its original
form.
"It began not as a degree-grant
ing graduate program but as a fel
lowship of writers, writers like Ken

Kesey ['s9], Tillie Olsen, Larry Mc-
Murtry, Evan Connell ['4B]... fel
lows who have gone on to distin
guish themselves in different
ways," he said.
John LHeureux took the reins of
the Stegner Fellowship in 1973 as
the first director of the Creative
Writing Program, a move widely
considered among faculty as mark
ing the program's retrenchment as
a highly selective society of stipend
funded fellows
"We have five Stegner fellows
each year in fiction and five in poet
ry, chosen from about 2,000 appli
cants," Wolff noted. "It's probably
the most selective program in the
country."
In addition to the Stegner Fel
lowship, Wolff cited the Creative
Writing Program at large for distin
guishing Stanford as one of creative
writing's academic powerhouses.
"Our undergraduate program is
the best in country there's noth
ing to compare it to," Wolff said.
A broad appeal
Wolff cited the program's flexi
bility in terms of scheduling as an
other defining feature. Individuals
can either pursue an emphasis in
creative writing through the Eng
lish major or a stand-alone creative
writing minor, allowing a greater
pool of students to take classes in
the subject.
"It's woven into the English ma
jor as an emphasis there's no
creative writing major," he said. "A
bio major, for example, could do a
minor in creative writing as well."
Wolff cited the popularity of cre
ative writing class as a result.
"The classes are full there al
ways seems to be demand for
more," Wolff said. "We have an as
tonishing array of classes offered
under creative writing."
According to Kealey, the under
graduate program expanded to its
current size about 10 years ago

when Eavan Boland, its director
since 2002, took the helm.
"[Before Boland], there were
only eight classes a quarter,"
Kealey said. "Now we have as many
as 30 classes a quarter. It's one of
the most popular minors on cam
pus."
Boland said that, in addition to
expanding the program to accom
modate the diverse interests of stu
dents, she strongly believes in put
ting young working writers into
classrooms as teachers. Facilitating
programs include the Jones Lec
tureship, which draws heavily on
the ranks of Stegner fellows.
"A young writer reminds our
students that writing is a living tra
dition," she said. "The Stegner fel
lows stay and become creative writ
ing teachers. They're developing
their first or second book, talking
about their work and others' work
all day, and they bring that energy
into the classroom. It's what makes
the vibe of the program."
Students can choose to focus on
fiction, creative non-fiction or poet
ry within the emphasis or minor.
According to Kealey, fiction is the
most popular track.
The program offers a wide array
of classes, including The Graphic
Novel, Fiction into Film and Imagi
nary Realms, which will be co
taught by Kealey.
Kealey cited the program's abil
ity to offer a variety of new classes
each year, depending on student
and teacher interest in specific sub
jects, as a strength. One such class
was modeled on the National Novel
Writing Month, a nation-wide event
that challenges individuals to write
an entire novel in the course of the
month of November.
"In the fall, I taught the Novel
Writing Intensive [with Hutchins],
which is based on NaNoWriMo
[National Novel Writing Month],"
Kealey said. "We were reading nov
els as literature and as a craft. For

the month of November, students
are writing a 50,000-word novel. We
had 16 students, and they all com
pleted it."
For students, the program's
popularity can be attributed not on
ly to its innovative take on structur
ing courses, but also to the work
shop model of writing that provides
a unique and supportive environ
ment for sharing and critiquing
one's work.
Susan Haynes 'l4, an English
major with a creative writing em
phasis in prose, emphasized the
benefits of workshopping from her
own experience.
"The workshopping format is
fantastic," Haynes said. "When a
class begins, you have time to work
on a short story or script or whatev
er, then halfway through the
course, you turn it in, and the next
half of the course, through the end
of the quarter, you are workshop
ping, which entails all of your peers
reading your work, offering sug
gestions. So you get 15 to 17 differ
ent perspectives, which helps to
highlight what's working and
what's not."
Haynes knew she wanted to be
an English major before coming to
Stanford, choosing the University
because of its Creative Writing
Program.
However, other students come
to campus with little idea that
they'll try their hand at the disci
pline, despite the program's ac
claim.
Jenny Thai 'l3 said that she did
not think she would be an English
major when she came to Stanford
four years ago. After taking her
first creative writing class, howev
er, she realized how much she en
joyed the discipline.
"I've never had a creative writ
ing class I didn't like," Thai said.
"The great thing about the classes
is that each lecturer has a different
style of running the class, so each

class is a little different, which is
what makes it so interesting."
Thai cited the individualized na
ture of the program as a major
draw.
"The classes are rewarding be
cause you work on things that mat
ter to you personally," she said.
"It's nice to write for an audience,
but one of the luxuries of the wilt
ing program at Stanford is getting
to work on what matters to you. It's
a self-indulgent activity, but re
warding."
Delving deeper
For students who want to take
their writing to the next level, the
program offers Levinthal Tutorials,
during which undergraduates work
with a fellow on a short story, col
lection of poetry or other piece of
writing over the course of the quar
ter instead of taking a workshop
style class.
"It's truly a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity," Kealey said. "For the
fellows, they get the enthusiasm
and energy from working with the
students. It's not something you
would see at any other program."
Wolff echoed Kealey's senti
ment regarding the tutorials.
"Writing is a very solitary busi
ness," Wolff said. "[This program]
provides a complementary dimen
sion in which solitary people can
find a common group to work with."
Even as the Creative Writing
Program continues to garner broad
acclaim, Boland framed the pro
gram's distinguishing aspect as the
interaction between participants
and the writing that ensues.
"It's the level of conversation,"
she said. "What we're most proud
of is the level of excitement from
the undergraduates about the writ
ing they love, the stories they read
and the poems they remember."

fiction writers and five poets are
chosen from about 2,000 applicants
and come to Stanford to work on
their writing for two years.
"They're really just beginning
their careers," Kealey added. "They
get to be here and take workshops
with amazing writers and with each
other. They really get to concentrate
on then* own writing."
Some fellowship graduates stay
close to the Farm. Kealey, Hutchins
and Tobias Wolff M.A. '7B, another
professor in the program, were all
once Stegner fellows.
Hutchins said that his time as a
Stegner fellow compelled him to
stay at the University as an instruc
tor despite his busy schedule as a
professional writer.
"I came as a Stegner fellow,
which was a great blessing and a
wonderful surprise, and I stayed
for a lot of reasons," Hutchins said.
"This is a really supportive environ
ment. You get to work with writers
you admire, the teaching is taken
incredibly seriously and the pro
gram is supportive of us as teachers
and artists."
Rather than being a graduate
program in creative writing, Wolff
characterized the fellowship as an
association for creative minds and a
program that despite various
leadership changes over the years
has retained much of its original
form.
"It began not as a degree-grant
ing graduate program but as a fel
lowship of writers, writers like Ken

Kesey ['s9], Tillie Olsen, Larry Mc-
Murtry, Evan Connell ['4B]... fel
lows who have gone on to distin
guish themselves in different
ways," he said.
John LHeureux took the reins of
the Stegner Fellowship in 1973 as
the first director of the Creative
Writing Program, a move widely
considered among faculty as mark
ing the program's retrenchment as
a highly selective society of stipend
funded fellows
"We have five Stegner fellows
each year in fiction and five in poet
ry, chosen from about 2,000 appli
cants," Wolff noted. "It's probably
the most selective program in the
country."
In addition to the Stegner Fel
lowship, Wolff cited the Creative
Writing Program at large for distin
guishing Stanford as one of creative
writing's academic powerhouses.
"Our undergraduate program is
the best in country there's noth
ing to compare it to," Wolff said.
A broad appeal
Wolff cited the program's flexi
bility in terms of scheduling as an
other defining feature. Individuals
can either pursue an emphasis in
creative writing through the Eng
lish major or a stand-alone creative
writing minor, allowing a greater
pool of students to take classes in
the subject.
"It's woven into the English ma
jor as an emphasis there's no
creative writing major," he said. "A
bio major, for example, could do a
minor in creative writing as well."
Wolff cited the popularity of cre
ative writing class as a result.
"The classes are full there al
ways seems to be demand for
more," Wolff said. "We have an as
tonishing array of classes offered
under creative writing."
According to Kealey, the under
graduate program expanded to its
current size about 10 years ago

when Eavan Boland, its director
since 2002, took the helm.
"[Before Boland], there were
only eight classes a quarter,"
Kealey said. "Now we have as many
as 30 classes a quarter. It's one of
the most popular minors on cam
pus."
Boland said that, in addition to
expanding the program to accom
modate the diverse interests of stu
dents, she strongly believes in put
ting young working writers into
classrooms as teachers. Facilitating
programs include the Jones Lec
tureship, which draws heavily on
the ranks of Stegner fellows.
"A young writer reminds our
students that writing is a living tra
dition," she said. "The Stegner fel
lows stay and become creative writ
ing teachers. They're developing
their first or second book, talking
about their work and others' work
all day, and they bring that energy
into the classroom. It's what makes
the vibe of the program."
Students can choose to focus on
fiction, creative non-fiction or poet
ry within the emphasis or minor.
According to Kealey, fiction is the
most popular track.
The program offers a wide array
of classes, including The Graphic
Novel, Fiction into Film and Imagi
nary Realms, which will be co
taught by Kealey.
Kealey cited the program's abil
ity to offer a variety of new classes
each year, depending on student
and teacher interest in specific sub
jects, as a strength. One such class
was modeled on the National Novel
Writing Month, a nation-wide event
that challenges individuals to write
an entire novel in the course of the
month of November.
"In the fall, I taught the Novel
Writing Intensive [with Hutchins],
which is based on NaNoWriMo
[National Novel Writing Month],"
Kealey said. "We were reading nov
els as literature and as a craft. For

the month of November, students
are writing a 50,000-word novel. We
had 16 students, and they all com
pleted it."
For students, the program's
popularity can be attributed not on
ly to its innovative take on structur
ing courses, but also to the work
shop model of writing that provides
a unique and supportive environ
ment for sharing and critiquing
one's work.
Susan Haynes 'l4, an English
major with a creative writing em
phasis in prose, emphasized the
benefits of workshopping from her
own experience.
"The workshopping format is
fantastic," Haynes said. "When a
class begins, you have time to work
on a short story or script or whatev
er, then halfway through the
course, you turn it in, and the next
half of the course, through the end
of the quarter, you are workshop
ping, which entails all of your peers
reading your work, offering sug
gestions. So you get 15 to 17 differ
ent perspectives, which helps to
highlight what's working and
what's not."
Haynes knew she wanted to be
an English major before coming to
Stanford, choosing the University
because of its Creative Writing
Program.
However, other students come
to campus with little idea that
they'll try their hand at the disci
pline, despite the program's ac
claim.
Jenny Thai 'l3 said that she did
not think she would be an English
major when she came to Stanford
four years ago. After taking her
first creative writing class, howev
er, she realized how much she en
joyed the discipline.
"I've never had a creative writ
ing class I didn't like," Thai said.
"The great thing about the classes
is that each lecturer has a different
style of running the class, so each

class is a little different, which is
what makes it so interesting."
Thai cited the individualized na
ture of the program as a major
draw.
"The classes are rewarding be
cause you work on things that mat
ter to you personally," she said.
"It's nice to write for an audience,
but one of the luxuries of the wilt
ing program at Stanford is getting
to work on what matters to you. It's
a self-indulgent activity, but re
warding."
Delving deeper
For students who want to take
their writing to the next level, the
program offers Levinthal Tutorials,
during which undergraduates work
with a fellow on a short story, col
lection of poetry or other piece of
writing over the course of the quar
ter instead of taking a workshop
style class.
"It's truly a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity," Kealey said. "For the
fellows, they get the enthusiasm
and energy from working with the
students. It's not something you
would see at any other program."
Wolff echoed Kealey's senti
ment regarding the tutorials.
"Writing is a very solitary busi
ness," Wolff said. "[This program]
provides a complementary dimen
sion in which solitary people can
find a common group to work with."
Even as the Creative Writing
Program continues to garner broad
acclaim, Boland framed the pro
gram's distinguishing aspect as the
interaction between participants
and the writing that ensues.
"It's the level of conversation,"
she said. "What we're most proud
of is the level of excitement from
the undergraduates about the writ
ing they love, the stories they read
and the poems they remember."

With a bustling startup culture and a loca
tion at the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford's
reputation as a "techie" school is incomparable.
The University's offerings at the other end of
the academic spectrum in creative writing
may, however, be the object of equal acclaim,
and even more heritage.
This year marks the 67th anniversary of

Stanford's Creative Writing Program and the
Wallace Stegner Fellowship, the second-oldest
fellowship of its kind in the country. The Stegn
er Fellowship, founded by renowned novelist
and former Stanford professor Wallace Stegner
in 1946, provides financial and artistic support
for up-and-coming writers.
According to Scott Hutchins, a lecturer in
the program, the fellowship was created by
Stegner as away of providing a creative outlet
to soldiers returning from World War 11.

"Stegner saw the Gls coming back after
World War II and felt like there needed to be a
writing fellowship for them to be a part of,"
Hutchins said. "They were a little bit older than
most college students and had stories to tell."
Tom Kealey, another lecturer in the depart
ment, said that the fellowship offers a unique
opportunity for young winters to develop their
craft in an encouraging but rigorous setting.
"[Stegner] designed the pro
gram for people in their 20s and 30s
to come to Stanford for a year or
two to work on their own writings,"
Kealey said.
The 10 Stegner fellows five
fiction writers and five poets are
chosen from about 2,000 applicants

lows who have gone on to distin
guish themselves in different
ways," he said.
John LHeureux took the reins of
the Stegner Fellowship in 1973 as
the first director of the Creative
Writing Program, a move widely
considered among faculty as mark
ing the program's retrenchment as
a highly selective society of stipend
funded fellows
"We have five Stegner fellows
each year in fiction and five in poet
ry, chosen from about 2,000 appli
cants," Wolff noted. "It's probably
the most selective program in the
country."
In addition to the Stegner Fel
lowship, Wolff cited the Creative
Writing Program at large for distin
guishing Stanford as one of creative
writing's academic powerhouses.
"Our undergraduate program is
the best in country there's noth
ing to compare it to," Wolff said.
A broad appeal
Wolff cited the program's flexi
bility in terms of scheduling as an
other defining feature. Individuals
can either pursue an emphasis in
creative writing through the Eng
lish major or a stand-alone creative
writing minor, allowing a greater
pool of students to take classes in
the subject.
"It's woven into the English ma
jor as an emphasis there's no
creative writing major," he said. "A
bio major, for example, could do a
minor in creative writing as well."
Wolff cited the popularity of cre
ative writing class as a result.
"The classes are full there al
ways seems to be demand for
more," Wolff said. "We have an as
tonishing array of classes offered
under creative writing."
According to Kealey, the under
graduate program expanded to its
current size about 10 years ago

when Eavan Boland, its director
since 2002, took the helm.
"[Before Boland], there were
only eight classes a quarter,"
Kealey said. "Now we have as many
as 30 classes a quarter. It's one of
the most popular minors on cam
pus."
Boland said that, in addition to
expanding the program to accom
modate the diverse interests of stu
dents, she strongly believes in put
ting young working writers into
classrooms as teachers. Facilitating
programs include the Jones Lec
tureship, which draws heavily on
the ranks of Stegner fellows.
"A young writer reminds our
students that writing is a living tra
dition," she said. "The Stegner fel
lows stay and become creative writ
ing teachers. They're developing
their first or second book, talking
about their work and others' work
all day, and they bring that energy
into the classroom. It's what makes
the vibe of the program."
Students can choose to focus on
fiction, creative non-fiction or poet
ry within the emphasis or minor.
According to Kealey, fiction is the
most popular track.
The program offers a wide array
of classes, including The Graphic
Novel, Fiction into Film and Imagi
nary Realms, which will be co
taught by Kealey.
Kealey cited the program's abil
ity to offer a variety of new classes
each year, depending on student
and teacher interest in specific sub
jects, as a strength. One such class
was modeled on the National Novel
Writing Month, a nation-wide event
that challenges individuals to write
an entire novel in the course of the
month of November.
"In the fall, I taught the Novel
Writing Intensive [with Hutchins],
which is based on NaNoWriMo
[National Novel Writing Month],"
Kealey said. "We were reading nov
els as literature and as a craft. For

the month of November, students
are writing a 50,000-word novel. We
had 16 students, and they all com
pleted it."
For students, the program's
popularity can be attributed not on
ly to its innovative take on structur
ing courses, but also to the work
shop model of writing that provides
a unique and supportive environ
ment for sharing and critiquing
one's work.
Susan Haynes 'l4, an English
major with a creative writing em
phasis in prose, emphasized the
benefits of workshopping from her
own experience.
"The workshopping format is
fantastic," Haynes said. "When a
class begins, you have time to work
on a short story or script or whatev
er, then halfway through the
course, you turn it in, and the next
half of the course, through the end
of the quarter, you are workshop
ping, which entails all of your peers
reading your work, offering sug
gestions. So you get 15 to 17 differ
ent perspectives, which helps to
highlight what's working and
what's not."
Haynes knew she wanted to be
an English major before coming to
Stanford, choosing the University
because of its Creative Writing
Program.
However, other students come
to campus with little idea that
they'll try their hand at the disci
pline, despite the program's ac
claim.
Jenny Thai 'l3 said that she did
not think she would be an English
major when she came to Stanford
four years ago. After taking her
first creative writing class, howev
er, she realized how much she en
joyed the discipline.
"I've never had a creative writ
ing class I didn't like," Thai said.
"The great thing about the classes
is that each lecturer has a different
style of running the class, so each

class is a little different, which is
what makes it so interesting."
Thai cited the individualized na
ture of the program as a major
draw.
"The classes are rewarding be
cause you work on things that mat
ter to you personally," she said.
"It's nice to write for an audience,
but one of the luxuries of the wilt
ing program at Stanford is getting
to work on what matters to you. It's
a self-indulgent activity, but re
warding."
Delving deeper
For students who want to take
their writing to the next level, the
program offers Levinthal Tutorials,
during which undergraduates work
with a fellow on a short story, col
lection of poetry or other piece of
writing over the course of the quar
ter instead of taking a workshop
style class.
"It's truly a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity," Kealey said. "For the
fellows, they get the enthusiasm
and energy from working with the
students. It's not something you
would see at any other program."
Wolff echoed Kealey's senti
ment regarding the tutorials.
"Writing is a very solitary busi
ness," Wolff said. "[This program]
provides a complementary dimen
sion in which solitary people can
find a common group to work with."
Even as the Creative Writing
Program continues to garner broad
acclaim, Boland framed the pro
gram's distinguishing aspect as the
interaction between participants
and the writing that ensues.
"It's the level of conversation,"
she said. "What we're most proud
of is the level of excitement from
the undergraduates about the writ
ing they love, the stories they read
and the poems they remember."
