# WOMEN'S SPORTS FEATURE SERIES
## THE 						FIRST CHAMPIONS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
It was a rainy Maryland day in June
1978, and the Cardinals were rally
ing on court three. Down 4-2 in the
third set of the deciding match of
the Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW) Finals,
Stanford was on the brink of conceding a
second straight national title to in-state
rival USC. Head coach Anne Gould '72
M.A. 'BO, whose four star players had
just split their matches on courts one
and two, watched nervously from the
sideline as freshmen Donna Rubin 'Bl
and Caryn Hertel 'Bl duked it out
against the Trojans' own pair of rookies.
Game by game, break by break, Ru
bin and Hertel stormed back to take the
match and the title.
But when the team returned to cam

pus, which had just emptied for the sum
mer, there was no hero's welcome, no
recognition for the group's remarkable
achievement: winning Stanford's first
national championship in a women's
sport.
"Goodness, no," Rubin remembers.
"The first time I even heard [that it was
the school's first] was a year ago, when
Caryn told me. And she had just heard
it."
A lot has changed in the 35 years
since the team's historic match: The
Cardinals are now the Cardinal, the
AIAW has given way to the NCAA and
Gould has moved on to teaching lessons
on campus. Most notably, Stanford's na
tional championship count in women's
sports now stands at 53, the highest in
the country.
More than half of those titles have
been won in the last 15 years, but if
there's a reason why Stanford women's

sports have been so successful in the re
cent past, it stems from work that was
done nearly four decades ago long be
fore each new title was celebrated with
its own front-page article, halftime cere
mony and t-shirt in the Athletics Shop.
The story begins, as it often does for
women's sports, with Title IX, the land
mark 1972 law that required gender eq
uity in all educational programs that re
ceived federal funding. By the end of the
decade, the U.S. Department of Educa
tion had developed a three-pronged
compliance test; applied to athletics, it
meant that the gender ratio of a school's
athletes had to equal that of its entire
student body, the school had to demon
strate a "history... of program expan
sion" for women or, at the very least, the
school had to prove that its programs

were meeting women's inter
est in sports.
Due to the significant gen
der gap in collegiate athletics
in the '7os, it quickly became a
target of early reforms. Stan
ford was no exception to the
early inequity.

When current women's
tennis coach Lele Forood '7B

arrived as a freshman two
years after Title IX, the
women's team —which had
just one coach practiced on
the old Roble courts, while
the men played in the stadi
um. The women's players
trained as a team just twice a
week, competing in as few as
nine matches some seasons.
"You had to be very moti
vated," said Forood, who
played at Stanford for two
seasons before turning pro.
"You had to pretty much do
things on your own."
Both Forood and Gould

credit Joe Ruetz, the school's
athletics director at the time,
with changing that. In the
spirit of the new law, he com
bined the separate men's and
women's athletic depart
ments and began stressing
the importance of women's
sports.
"Stanford embraced Title
IX," Gould said. "In each
sport that it has, it said, 'Okay,
we're going to give the maxi
mum scholarships that we
can, we're going to provide fa
cilities, we're going to provide
good coaching.'

'A lot of [other schools']
programs kind of fought that
and still kept women's athlet
ics totally separate from the
men's," she added. "And that
was hard. There were a lot of
battles at a lot of those schools."
Stanford's next priority
was to build scholarship sup
port to attract top female
players. Recruiting, a fore
gone conclusion in Division I
athletics today, was far from
the norm for women's teams
at the time.
The tennis team began of
fering tuition-only scholar
ships in 1975 and gave its first
full ride to Kathy Jordan 'Bl
before the 1977-78 title-win
ning season. The Cardinals
couldn't have done it without
Jordan, who played No. 1 sin
gles as a freshman and was
the team's only top-four play
er to win her singles match in
the AIAW Final.
"That's one reason why
Stanford women's sports are
so strong, because of the com
mitment at the beginning,"
Gould said. "They didn't mess
around, they said, 'We're go
ing to do this, we're going to
do it right, we're going to get
behind it 100 percent.' And
they did."
It was only fitting that
Stanford's evolution first paid
dividends in tennis. Just five
years before, Billy Jean
King's paradigm-changing
win in a tennis match against
Bobby Riggs, dubbed the
"Battle of the Sexes," had
highlighted the viability of
women's sports on a national
stage, and the Women's Ten
nis Association was thriving a
quarter of a century before
equivalent basketball and soc
cer leagues would be founded.
"Tennis was at the fore
front of women's sports,"
Forood said, "in equality and
prize money and all those
kinds of things."
Yet at the collegiate level,
it still took time to accumulate
the financial aid that women's
athletes receive today. Rubin
was offered only a half schol
arship her first two years;
Hertel, the team's third fresh
man in 1977-78, received no fi
nancial aid at all.
The very same year that
Rubin and Hertel clinched the
school's first women's nation
al title, a group of fans found
ed the Cardinal Club, a
fundraising organization that
intended to build a stronger
foundation for future
women's scholarships. They
were met with many of the
same fears that critics of Title
IX emphasize to this day.
"When we first started,
there was concern that we
were going to be siphoning off
support that had been just for
men's athletics and that
donors might not support
both programs," said Linda
Meier '6l, one of the Cardinal
Club's founders. "It has
[proven] to be quite the con
trary. Support for women's
athletics actually enhanced
the entire athletic program at
Stanford, and so it has really
been nothing but an incredi
ble asset."
Stanford's dedication to fi
nancial aid for women's play
ers gave it an early leg up

over rival schools. Frank
Brennan, who took over for
Gould after the 1979 season,
coached 40 All-Americans
during the 1980s alone, send
ing out an entire lineup's
worth of honorees in both
1984 and 1988. His teams
would secure six national ti
tles during that decade and 10
in total during his 21 years on
the Farm.
"When you look at our his
tory and you look at where we
are today, certainly we were
the innovators," said current
athletics director Bernard
Muir. "We said, 'You know
what, this is an area where we
can really excel and excel
quickly.' .And if you look at our
history and our broad-based
participation, it has really
paid off, and that tradition of
excellence helps us in recruit
ing circles."
As Stanford began at
tracting higher-caliber female
athletes, its success called for
more professionally run pro
grams. A second women's
tennis coach was hired in the
mid-'Bos, Forood says, and the
team's schedule began to re
semble its current 25-match
foimat.
Similar changes began to
pay dividends for other
teams as well. The women's
swimming team, which had
captured Stanford's only
other AIAW title in 1979-80,
won a pair of NCAA champi
onships in the 'Bos, the
women's volleyball team es
tablished itself as a con
tender by reaching six Final
Fours during that same
stretch and Cardinal basket
ball showed flashes of its lat
er dominance by winning its
first conference title at the
end of the decade.
And in 1987, more than a
decade after Stanford's two
athletic departments were
combined, the integration of
male and female athletes be
came complete when the
Cardinal Club joined with its
longstanding men's counter
part, the Buck Club, to form
the Buck Cardinal Club.
"It was hard [before that]
because there were two enti
ties that raised money for
scholarships, but once they
did it, I think the donors re
ally embraced it," Gould
said. 'And so the support,
even outside the athletic de
partment, fans and alums
and donors, has been
tremendous for women's
sports as well."
With that support, Stan
ford has gone from offering
no women's tennis scholar
ships to funding eight, from
competing in nine matches in
a season to participating in
23, from having no women's
national titles to its name to
capturing 53 of them all in
35 years.
"That's the beauty of this
place, that we can celebrate
a variety of opportunities for
kids to compete at the high
est level," Muir added. "And
other programs, sometimes
just based on the resources
they have or the focus that
they intend, don't offer the
broad-based programming
like a Stanford does."
It's hard to get Muir to

talk —or even boast
specifically about Cardinal
women's sports. For one of
the first combined athletic
departments in the nation,
male and female athletes
aren't seen as different.
They're just athletes.
But even at an institution
that prides itself on "excel
lence across the board," as
Muir puts it, it's hard to ig
nore the strides made by
Stanford women's athletes
over the years and what
they continue to accomplish
here on a regular basis.
That's what The Daily
will explore over the next
two weeks, starting with this
piece, the first of a six-part
feature series on Stanford
women's sports.
On Wednesday, Jana Per
sky explores the varying lev
els of support from which
Stanford women's teams
benefit. Long-time fans and
current athletes and coaches
answer the burning ques
tion: Why do women's bas
ketball and soccer games of
ten draw crowds larger than
their men's counterparts,
while other teams, like ten
nis and Softball, struggle to
attract the same following?
This Friday, Ashley Wes
them profiles the face of
Stanford women's athletics,
Tara VanDerveer, who
coached her 26th consecu
tive NCAA Tournament
team this season. The recent
Naismith Memorial Basket
ball Hall of Fame inductee
talks about living through
the shift in women's athlet
ics and the culture at Stan
ford.
To kick off next week,
Sam Fisher explains why the
Farm is such a great feeder
for women's professional and
Olympic teams. He'll tell the
stories of current WNBA
players Nneka Ogwumike
'l2 and Jeanette Pohlen 'll,
former Stanford volleyball
players who are still compet
ing professionally abroad,
and talk to current Stanford
water polo players who won
the gold medal at the 2012
Olympics with Team USA.
Next Wednesday, Renee
Donovan takes you inside
the life of a female athlete at
Stanford, junior swimmer
Andie Taylor. Taylor says she
"loves chocolate milk, often
smells like chlorine and
wakes up before most CS ma
jors finish coding from the
night before."
To conclude the series
next Friday, Tom Taylor looks
ahead, asking how women's
sports will change in the fu
ture and what paid Stanford,
ever the innovator, will play in
those changes. He hears from
two former Cardinal athletes
who grew up in the era of Ti
tle IX: Kerri Walsh 'OO, a
three-time Olympic gold
medalist and perhaps the
greatest beach volleyball
player the sport has ever
seen, and Julie Foudy '93, a
member of the historic 1999
World Cup Champion U.S.
women's soccer team and a
three-time Olympic medalist
herself.

King's paradigm-changing
win in a tennis match against
Bobby Riggs, dubbed the
"Battle of the Sexes," had
highlighted the viability of
women's sports on a national
stage, and the Women's Ten
nis Association was thriving a
quarter of a century before
equivalent basketball and soc
cer leagues would be founded.
"Tennis was at the fore
front of women's sports,"
Forood said, "in equality and
prize money and all those
kinds of things."
Yet at the collegiate level,
it still took time to accumulate
the financial aid that women's
athletes receive today. Rubin
was offered only a half schol
arship her first two years;
Hertel, the team's third fresh
man in 1977-78, received no fi
nancial aid at all.
The very same year that
Rubin and Hertel clinched the
school's first women's nation
al title, a group of fans found
ed the Cardinal Club, a
fundraising organization that
intended to build a stronger
foundation for future
women's scholarships. They
were met with many of the
same fears that critics of Title
IX emphasize to this day.
"When we first started,
there was concern that we
were going to be siphoning off
support that had been just for
men's athletics and that
donors might not support
both programs," said Linda
Meier '6l, one of the Cardinal
Club's founders. "It has
[proven] to be quite the con
trary. Support for women's
athletics actually enhanced
the entire athletic program at
Stanford, and so it has really
been nothing but an incredi
ble asset."
Stanford's dedication to fi
nancial aid for women's play
ers gave it an early leg up

over rival schools. Frank
Brennan, who took over for
Gould after the 1979 season,
coached 40 All-Americans
during the 1980s alone, send
ing out an entire lineup's
worth of honorees in both
1984 and 1988. His teams
would secure six national ti
tles during that decade and 10
in total during his 21 years on
the Farm.
"When you look at our his
tory and you look at where we
are today, certainly we were
the innovators," said current
athletics director Bernard
Muir. "We said, 'You know
what, this is an area where we
can really excel and excel
quickly.' .And if you look at our
history and our broad-based
participation, it has really
paid off, and that tradition of
excellence helps us in recruit
ing circles."
As Stanford began at
tracting higher-caliber female
athletes, its success called for
more professionally run pro
grams. A second women's
tennis coach was hired in the
mid-'Bos, Forood says, and the
team's schedule began to re
semble its current 25-match
foimat.
Similar changes began to
pay dividends for other
teams as well. The women's
swimming team, which had
captured Stanford's only
other AIAW title in 1979-80,
won a pair of NCAA champi
onships in the 'Bos, the
women's volleyball team es
tablished itself as a con
tender by reaching six Final
Fours during that same
stretch and Cardinal basket
ball showed flashes of its lat
er dominance by winning its
first conference title at the
end of the decade.
And in 1987, more than a
decade after Stanford's two
athletic departments were
combined, the integration of
male and female athletes be
came complete when the
Cardinal Club joined with its
longstanding men's counter
part, the Buck Club, to form
the Buck Cardinal Club.
"It was hard [before that]
because there were two enti
ties that raised money for
scholarships, but once they
did it, I think the donors re
ally embraced it," Gould
said. 'And so the support,
even outside the athletic de
partment, fans and alums
and donors, has been
tremendous for women's
sports as well."
With that support, Stan
ford has gone from offering
no women's tennis scholar
ships to funding eight, from
competing in nine matches in
a season to participating in
23, from having no women's
national titles to its name to
capturing 53 of them all in
35 years.
"That's the beauty of this
place, that we can celebrate
a variety of opportunities for
kids to compete at the high
est level," Muir added. "And
other programs, sometimes
just based on the resources
they have or the focus that
they intend, don't offer the
broad-based programming
like a Stanford does."
It's hard to get Muir to

talk —or even boast
specifically about Cardinal
women's sports. For one of
the first combined athletic
departments in the nation,
male and female athletes
aren't seen as different.
They're just athletes.
But even at an institution
that prides itself on "excel
lence across the board," as
Muir puts it, it's hard to ig
nore the strides made by
Stanford women's athletes
over the years and what
they continue to accomplish
here on a regular basis.
That's what The Daily
will explore over the next
two weeks, starting with this
piece, the first of a six-part
feature series on Stanford
women's sports.
On Wednesday, Jana Per
sky explores the varying lev
els of support from which
Stanford women's teams
benefit. Long-time fans and
current athletes and coaches
answer the burning ques
tion: Why do women's bas
ketball and soccer games of
ten draw crowds larger than
their men's counterparts,
while other teams, like ten
nis and Softball, struggle to
attract the same following?
This Friday, Ashley Wes
them profiles the face of
Stanford women's athletics,
Tara VanDerveer, who
coached her 26th consecu
tive NCAA Tournament
team this season. The recent
Naismith Memorial Basket
ball Hall of Fame inductee
talks about living through
the shift in women's athlet
ics and the culture at Stan
ford.
To kick off next week,
Sam Fisher explains why the
Farm is such a great feeder
for women's professional and
Olympic teams. He'll tell the
stories of current WNBA
players Nneka Ogwumike
'l2 and Jeanette Pohlen 'll,
former Stanford volleyball
players who are still compet
ing professionally abroad,
and talk to current Stanford
water polo players who won
the gold medal at the 2012
Olympics with Team USA.
Next Wednesday, Renee
Donovan takes you inside
the life of a female athlete at
Stanford, junior swimmer
Andie Taylor. Taylor says she
"loves chocolate milk, often
smells like chlorine and
wakes up before most CS ma
jors finish coding from the
night before."
To conclude the series
next Friday, Tom Taylor looks
ahead, asking how women's
sports will change in the fu
ture and what paid Stanford,
ever the innovator, will play in
those changes. He hears from
two former Cardinal athletes
who grew up in the era of Ti
tle IX: Kerri Walsh 'OO, a
three-time Olympic gold
medalist and perhaps the
greatest beach volleyball
player the sport has ever
seen, and Julie Foudy '93, a
member of the historic 1999
World Cup Champion U.S.
women's soccer team and a
three-time Olympic medalist
herself.

It was a rainy Maryland day in June
1978, and the Cardinals were rally
ing on court three. Down 4-2 in the
third set of the deciding match of
the Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW) Finals,
Stanford was on the brink of conceding a
second straight national title to in-state
rival USC. Head coach Anne Gould '72
M.A. 'BO, whose four star players had
just split their matches on courts one
and two, watched nervously from the
sideline as freshmen Donna Rubin 'Bl
and Caryn Hertel 'Bl duked it out
against the Trojans' own pair of rookies.
Game by game, break by break, Ru
bin and Hertel stormed back to take the
match and the title.
But when the team returned to cam

pus, which had just emptied for the sum
mer, there was no hero's welcome, no
recognition for the group's remarkable
achievement: winning Stanford's first
national championship in a women's
sport.
"Goodness, no," Rubin remembers.
"The first time I even heard [that it was
the school's first] was a year ago, when
Caryn told me. And she had just heard
it."
A lot has changed in the 35 years
since the team's historic match: The
Cardinals are now the Cardinal, the
AIAW has given way to the NCAA and
Gould has moved on to teaching lessons
on campus. Most notably, Stanford's na
tional championship count in women's
sports now stands at 53, the highest in
the country.
More than half of those titles have
been won in the last 15 years, but if
there's a reason why Stanford women's

sports have been so successful in the re
cent past, it stems from work that was
done nearly four decades ago long be
fore each new title was celebrated with
its own front-page article, halftime cere
mony and t-shirt in the Athletics Shop.
The story begins, as it often does for
women's sports, with Title IX, the land
mark 1972 law that required gender eq
uity in all educational programs that re
ceived federal funding. By the end of the
decade, the U.S. Department of Educa
tion had developed a three-pronged
compliance test; applied to athletics, it
meant that the gender ratio of a school's
athletes had to equal that of its entire
student body, the school had to demon
strate a "history... of program expan
sion" for women or, at the very least, the
school had to prove that its programs

were meeting women's inter
est in sports.
Due to the significant gen
der gap in collegiate athletics
in the '7os, it quickly became a
target of early reforms. Stan
ford was no exception to the
early inequity.

When current women's
tennis coach Lele Forood '7B

arrived as a freshman two
years after Title IX, the
women's team —which had
just one coach practiced on
the old Roble courts, while
the men played in the stadi
um. The women's players
trained as a team just twice a
week, competing in as few as
nine matches some seasons.
"You had to be very moti
vated," said Forood, who
played at Stanford for two
seasons before turning pro.
"You had to pretty much do
things on your own."
Both Forood and Gould

credit Joe Ruetz, the school's
athletics director at the time,
with changing that. In the
spirit of the new law, he com
bined the separate men's and
women's athletic depart
ments and began stressing
the importance of women's
sports.
"Stanford embraced Title
IX," Gould said. "In each
sport that it has, it said, 'Okay,
we're going to give the maxi
mum scholarships that we
can, we're going to provide fa
cilities, we're going to provide
good coaching.'

'A lot of [other schools']
programs kind of fought that
and still kept women's athlet
ics totally separate from the
men's," she added. "And that
was hard. There were a lot of
battles at a lot of those schools."
Stanford's next priority
was to build scholarship sup
port to attract top female
players. Recruiting, a fore
gone conclusion in Division I
athletics today, was far from
the norm for women's teams
at the time.
The tennis team began of
fering tuition-only scholar
ships in 1975 and gave its first
full ride to Kathy Jordan 'Bl
before the 1977-78 title-win
ning season. The Cardinals
couldn't have done it without
Jordan, who played No. 1 sin
gles as a freshman and was
the team's only top-four play
er to win her singles match in
the AIAW Final.
"That's one reason why
Stanford women's sports are
so strong, because of the com
mitment at the beginning,"
Gould said. "They didn't mess
around, they said, 'We're go
ing to do this, we're going to
do it right, we're going to get
behind it 100 percent.' And
they did."
It was only fitting that
Stanford's evolution first paid
dividends in tennis. Just five
years before, Billy Jean
King's paradigm-changing
win in a tennis match against
Bobby Riggs, dubbed the
"Battle of the Sexes," had
highlighted the viability of
women's sports on a national
stage, and the Women's Ten
nis Association was thriving a
quarter of a century before
equivalent basketball and soc
cer leagues would be founded.
"Tennis was at the fore

was offered only a half schol

Hertel, the team's third fresh

nancial aid at all.

Rubin and Hertel clinched the

two weeks, starting with this
piece, the first of a six-part
feature series on Stanford
women's sports.
On Wednesday, Jana Per
sky explores the varying lev
els of support from which
Stanford women's teams
benefit. Long-time fans and
current athletes and coaches
answer the burning ques
tion: Why do women's bas
ketball and soccer games of
ten draw crowds larger than
their men's counterparts,
while other teams, like ten
nis and Softball, struggle to
attract the same following?
This Friday, Ashley Wes
them profiles the face of
Stanford women's athletics,
Tara VanDerveer, who
coached her 26th consecu
tive NCAA Tournament
team this season. The recent
Naismith Memorial Basket
ball Hall of Fame inductee
talks about living through
the shift in women's athlet
ics and the culture at Stan
ford.
To kick off next week,
Sam Fisher explains why the
Farm is such a great feeder
for women's professional and
Olympic teams. He'll tell the
stories of current WNBA
players Nneka Ogwumike
'l2 and Jeanette Pohlen 'll,
former Stanford volleyball
players who are still compet
ing professionally abroad,
and talk to current Stanford
water polo players who won
the gold medal at the 2012
Olympics with Team USA.
Next Wednesday, Renee
Donovan takes you inside
the life of a female athlete at
Stanford, junior swimmer
Andie Taylor. Taylor says she
"loves chocolate milk, often
smells like chlorine and
wakes up before most CS ma
jors finish coding from the
night before."
To conclude the series
next Friday, Tom Taylor looks
ahead, asking how women's
sports will change in the fu
ture and what paid Stanford,
ever the innovator, will play in
those changes. He hears from
two former Cardinal athletes
who grew up in the era of Ti
tle IX: Kerri Walsh 'OO, a
three-time Olympic gold
medalist and perhaps the
greatest beach volleyball
player the sport has ever
seen, and Julie Foudy '93, a
member of the historic 1999
World Cup Champion U.S.
women's soccer team and a
three-time Olympic medalist
herself.

It was a rainy Maryland day in June
1978, and the Cardinals were rally
ing on court three. Down 4-2 in the
third set of the deciding match of
the Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW) Finals,
Stanford was on the brink of conceding a
second straight national title to in-state
rival USC. Head coach Anne Gould '72
M.A. 'BO, whose four star players had
just split their matches on courts one
and two, watched nervously from the
sideline as freshmen Donna Rubin 'Bl
and Caryn Hertel 'Bl duked it out
against the Trojans' own pair of rookies.
Game by game, break by break, Ru
bin and Hertel stormed back to take the
match and the title.
But when the team returned to cam

pus, which had just emptied for the sum
mer, there was no hero's welcome, no
recognition for the group's remarkable
achievement: winning Stanford's first
national championship in a women's
sport.
"Goodness, no," Rubin remembers.
"The first time I even heard [that it was
the school's first] was a year ago, when
Caryn told me. And she had just heard
it."
A lot has changed in the 35 years
since the team's historic match: The
Cardinals are now the Cardinal, the
AIAW has given way to the NCAA and
Gould has moved on to teaching lessons
on campus. Most notably, Stanford's na
tional championship count in women's
sports now stands at 53, the highest in
the country.
More than half of those titles have
been won in the last 15 years, but if
there's a reason why Stanford women's

sports have been so successful in the re
cent past, it stems from work that was
done nearly four decades ago long be
fore each new title was celebrated with
its own front-page article, halftime cere
mony and t-shirt in the Athletics Shop.
The story begins, as it often does for
women's sports, with Title IX, the land
mark 1972 law that required gender eq
uity in all educational programs that re
ceived federal funding. By the end of the
decade, the U.S. Department of Educa
tion had developed a three-pronged
compliance test; applied to athletics, it
meant that the gender ratio of a school's
athletes had to equal that of its entire
student body, the school had to demon
strate a "history... of program expan
sion" for women or, at the very least, the
school had to prove that its programs

were meeting women's inter
est in sports.
Due to the significant gen
der gap in collegiate athletics
in the '7os, it quickly became a
target of early reforms. Stan
ford was no exception to the
early inequity.

When current women's
tennis coach Lele Forood '7B

arrived as a freshman two
years after Title IX, the
women's team —which had
just one coach practiced on
the old Roble courts, while
the men played in the stadi
um. The women's players
trained as a team just twice a
week, competing in as few as
nine matches some seasons.
"You had to be very moti
vated," said Forood, who
played at Stanford for two
seasons before turning pro.
"You had to pretty much do
things on your own."
Both Forood and Gould

credit Joe Ruetz, the school's
athletics director at the time,
with changing that. In the
spirit of the new law, he com
bined the separate men's and
women's athletic depart
ments and began stressing
the importance of women's
sports.
"Stanford embraced Title
IX," Gould said. "In each
sport that it has, it said, 'Okay,
we're going to give the maxi
mum scholarships that we
can, we're going to provide fa
cilities, we're going to provide
good coaching.'

'A lot of [other schools']
programs kind of fought that
and still kept women's athlet
ics totally separate from the
men's," she added. "And that
was hard. There were a lot of
battles at a lot of those schools."
Stanford's next priority
was to build scholarship sup
port to attract top female
players. Recruiting, a fore
gone conclusion in Division I
athletics today, was far from
the norm for women's teams
at the time.
The tennis team began of
fering tuition-only scholar
ships in 1975 and gave its first
full ride to Kathy Jordan 'Bl
before the 1977-78 title-win
ning season. The Cardinals
couldn't have done it without
Jordan, who played No. 1 sin
gles as a freshman and was
the team's only top-four play
er to win her singles match in
the AIAW Final.
"That's one reason why
Stanford women's sports are
so strong, because of the com
mitment at the beginning,"
Gould said. "They didn't mess
around, they said, 'We're go
ing to do this, we're going to
do it right, we're going to get
behind it 100 percent.' And
they did."
It was only fitting that
Stanford's evolution first paid
dividends in tennis. Just five
years before, Billy Jean
King's paradigm-changing
win in a tennis match against
Bobby Riggs, dubbed the
"Battle of the Sexes," had
highlighted the viability of
women's sports on a national
stage, and the Women's Ten
nis Association was thriving a
quarter of a century before
equivalent basketball and soc
cer leagues would be founded.
"Tennis was at the fore
front of women's sports,"
Forood said, "in equality and
prize money and all those
kinds of things."
Yet at the collegiate level,
it still took time to accumulate
the financial aid that women's
athletes receive today. Rubin
was offered only a half schol
arship her first two years;
Hertel, the team's third fresh
man in 1977-78, received no fi
nancial aid at all.
The very same year that
Rubin and Hertel clinched the
school's first women's nation
al title, a group of fans found
ed the Cardinal Club, a
fundraising organization that
intended to build a stronger
foundation for future
women's scholarships. They
were met with many of the
same fears that critics of Title
IX emphasize to this day.
"When we first started,
there was concern that we
were going to be siphoning off
support that had been just for
men's athletics and that
donors might not support
both programs," said Linda
Meier '6l, one of the Cardinal
Club's founders. "It has
[proven] to be quite the con
trary. Support for women's
athletics actually enhanced
the entire athletic program at
Stanford, and so it has really
been nothing but an incredi
ble asset."
Stanford's dedication to fi
nancial aid for women's play
ers gave it an early leg up

over rival schools. Frank
Brennan, who took over for
Gould after the 1979 season,
coached 40 All-Americans
during the 1980s alone, send
ing out an entire lineup's
worth of honorees in both
1984 and 1988. His teams
would secure six national ti
tles during that decade and 10
in total during his 21 years on
the Farm.
"When you look at our his
tory and you look at where we
are today, certainly we were
the innovators," said current
athletics director Bernard
Muir. "We said, 'You know
what, this is an area where we
can really excel and excel
quickly.' .And if you look at our
history and our broad-based
participation, it has really
paid off, and that tradition of
excellence helps us in recruit
ing circles."
As Stanford began at
tracting higher-caliber female
athletes, its success called for
more professionally run pro
grams. A second women's
tennis coach was hired in the
mid-'Bos, Forood says, and the
team's schedule began to re
semble its current 25-match
foimat.
Similar changes began to
pay dividends for other
teams as well. The women's
swimming team, which had
captured Stanford's only
other AIAW title in 1979-80,
won a pair of NCAA champi
onships in the 'Bos, the
women's volleyball team es
tablished itself as a con
tender by reaching six Final
Fours during that same
stretch and Cardinal basket
ball showed flashes of its lat
er dominance by winning its
first conference title at the
end of the decade.
And in 1987, more than a
decade after Stanford's two
athletic departments were
combined, the integration of
male and female athletes be
came complete when the
Cardinal Club joined with its
longstanding men's counter
part, the Buck Club, to form
the Buck Cardinal Club.
"It was hard [before that]
because there were two enti
ties that raised money for
scholarships, but once they
did it, I think the donors re
ally embraced it," Gould
said. 'And so the support,
even outside the athletic de
partment, fans and alums
and donors, has been
tremendous for women's
sports as well."
With that support, Stan
ford has gone from offering
no women's tennis scholar
ships to funding eight, from
competing in nine matches in
a season to participating in
23, from having no women's
national titles to its name to
capturing 53 of them all in
35 years.
"That's the beauty of this
place, that we can celebrate
a variety of opportunities for
kids to compete at the high
est level," Muir added. "And
other programs, sometimes
just based on the resources
they have or the focus that
they intend, don't offer the
broad-based programming
like a Stanford does."
It's hard to get Muir to

talk —or even boast
specifically about Cardinal
women's sports. For one of
the first combined athletic
departments in the nation,
male and female athletes
aren't seen as different.
They're just athletes.
But even at an institution
that prides itself on "excel
lence across the board," as
Muir puts it, it's hard to ig
nore the strides made by
Stanford women's athletes
over the years and what
they continue to accomplish
here on a regular basis.
That's what The Daily
