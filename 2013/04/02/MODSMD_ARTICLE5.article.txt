# WOMEN'S SPORTS FEATURE SERIES
## THE
						FIRST CHAMPIONS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
It was a rainy Maryland day in June
1978, and the Cardinals were rally
ing on court three. Down 4-2 in the
third set of the deciding match of
the Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW) Finals,
Stanford was on the brink of conceding a
second straight national title to in-state
rival USC. Head coach Anne Gould '72
M.A. 'BO, whose four star players had
just split their matches on courts one
and two, watched nervously from the
sideline as freshmen Donna Rubin 'Bl
and Caryn Hertel 'Bl duked it out
against the Trojans' own pair of rookies.
Game by game, break by break, Ru
bin and Hertel stormed back to take the
match and the title.
But when the team returned to cam

pus, which had just emptied for the sum
mer, there was no hero's welcome, no
recognition for the group's remarkable
achievement: winning Stanford's first
national championship in a women's
sport.
"Goodness, no," Rubin remembers.
"The first time I even heard [that it was
the school's first] was a year ago, when
Caryn told me. And she had just heard
it."
A lot has changed in the 35 years
since the team's historic match: The
Cardinals are now the Cardinal, the
AIAW has given way to the NCAA and
Gould has moved on to teaching lessons
on campus. Most notably, Stanford's na
tional championship count in women's
sports now stands at 53, the highest in
the country.
More than half of those titles have
been won in the last 15 years, but if
there's a reason why Stanford women's

sports have been so successful in the re
cent past, it stems from work that was
done nearly four decades ago long be
fore each new title was celebrated with
its own front-page article, halftime cere
mony and t-shirt in the Athletics Shop.
The story begins, as it often does for
women's sports, with Title IX, the land
mark 1972 law that required gender eq
uity in all educational programs that re
ceived federal funding. By the end of the
decade, the U.S. Department of Educa
tion had developed a three-pronged
compliance test; applied to athletics, it
meant that the gender ratio of a school's
athletes had to equal that of its entire
student body, the school had to demon
strate a "history... of program expan
sion" for women or, at the very least, the
school had to prove that its programs
