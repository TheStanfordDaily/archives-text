## For Landauer,the tribe has spoken Fresh off the island, Julia Landauer talks about her stint on "Survivor: Caramoan" 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Julia Landauer 'l4, a 21-year-old professional race
car driver and Stanford undergraduate, recently took
part in "Survivor: Caramoan," the latest installation in
the long-running reality series. Landauer sat down
with The Daily to talk about being voted off the show,
her lack of screen time, being compared to the flavor
vanilla and the possibility of a return appearance.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How has it been watch
ing the season progress on national television? I
imagine it must be a unique experience because
while you lived through the events, you are now
watching the editorial decisions and tribe mates'
confessionals for the first time.
Julia Landauer (JL): Yeah, it's been really interest
ing watching this season. It's always funny to see your
self on T\£ and I've only ever seen that in respect to
racing, so this is definitely different. I will admit that
it's been frustrating at times to not have very much
screen time. That being said, I still have a bunch of
people who come out and watch it with me every week.
So it's been fun.
TSD: What has been the response on campus after
the episodes have aired?
Have professors or fellow
students recognized you
from the show at all?
JL: I've had a lot of people
recognize me, which is funny
and it's really great. There
was someone who was on the
ladies' swim team who came
up to me in Ricker Dining
Hall and asked for a picture.
And she totally made my
night. We made each other's
nights, I guess. Then, my TA
in CS 105 had seen me on the
show. It's been a lot of fun. It's
weird to meet people who say,
"Oh, you are on 'Survivor.'"
Some people are really jeal
ous [and] others have never
seen it before, but it's always
a lot of fun.
TSD: Like you mentioned
before, one of my biggest
complaints with "Survivor"
this season is that we didn't
get to see enough of you.
The way the season was ed
ited marginalized your role
in the game. When did you
realize that the edit was go
ing that way, and how frus
trating was it to watch?
JL: By the third episode,
when I still hadn't seen a lot
of myself on the show, I start
ed to worry that it wasn't go
ing to be a super favorable
edit. That being said, I em
braced it and still had a lot of
fun with my lack of screen
time on Twitter and Face
book. All of my supporters
were having a lot of fun with
it too. So I made the best of
it, but it definitely was not
ideal.
TSD: Since we did not get
to see a lot of your game
play, could you talk a little
bit about what your strate
gy was?
JL: I had originally
planned to go out a little un
der-the-radar and not make
any moves right away be
cause you want to keep with
a strong tribe to make it to
the merge. However, once we
had the tribe swap, that
strategy wasn't really going
to work any more. I had to
adapt it a little bit. Michael
[Snow] and Matt [Bischoff]
and I were scrambling from
day one of the new tribe, but
it didn't seem like anything
was going to work. We felt
like we were kind of doomed.
I was getting pretty bad
vibes the day of the immuni
ty challenge, and I hadn't
even gone against Phillip
[Sheppard, a returning play
er] yet. When I was feeling
that sense of insecurity, I just
decided, "OK, it's time for me
to try and make a big move."
It didn't work, but I gave it
my best. I just think there
wasn't a whole lot that I
could have done differently.
A lot of people were saying it
just looked like there was no

light at the end of the tunnel
for the fans, and I was includ
ed in that.

TSD: How do you think
your game would've been
different if there hadn't
been that tribal swap or if
you had drawn orange
paint and gone to the new
Gota tribe?
JL: Life would have been
grand if I had gone to the Go
ta tribe because I would've
been on a winning tribe for
the first time that season.
Even if there wasn't a swap, I
was sitting in a pretty good
spot on my alliance in the
original fans' tribe, and I was
feeling in control. We knew
that the merge was in the
next week or so the next
couple of episodes —so we
thought if we have to go back
to tribal, we can get rid of
Reynold [Toepfer] and Eddie
[Fox] the people not in our
alliance and that would've
held us off for the merge. But
that didn't happen either,
which is too bad.
TSD: Fellow tribe mate
Phillip Sheppard expressed
plans to make you a "dou
ble agent." In other post
game interviews, however,
you expressed doubts that
he really was sincere about
his intentions, which is
why you made an attempt
to get him eliminated.
What made you doubt that
Phillip really wanted to
take you under his wing?
JL: Yeah, so he had given
me this speech about how he
wanted to make me a double
agent. He said, "You'll be
safe with me." But... he nev
er talked with me about
strategy. If I tried to bring
something up, he wouldn't
have a conversation with me.
And that wasn't really en
couraging. He had talked
with a lot of other people too,
so ... there was a chance he
was still being sincere, but I
wasn't going to bet on it. Be
cause I had that reaction, that
was what led me to approach
Dawn [Meehan, about trying
to get rid of Phillip], which
may or may not have been the
right decision. But there
[weren't a lot] of options to
choose [from],
TSD: In last week's episode,
Phillip referred to you as
"smart, but not college-edu
cated like myself." Was that
just Phillip being Phillip, or
did you not tell other con
testants that you are a Stan
ford student?
JL: I didn't tell other peo
ple that I was a Stanford stu
dent. I was thinking long-term,
and if I made it to the final
three, how likely were people
to vote for me if I was a Stan
ford-educated racecar driver?
I didn't think that I would get
the most votes. I was thinking
long-term. Now, whether or
not that was the right decision,
I'll never know, but it was what
I started out with, so I decided
to stick with it.

TSD: After the tribal swap, I
thought there might be a
chance for you to hit it off
with [John] Cochran, espe
cially since you both have
similar educational back
grounds [Cochran attended
Harvard Law School]. I was
surprised then when I saw
his infamous "vanilla"
monologue in the last
episode. How was it watch
ing that confessional?
JL: It was brutal, especial
ly because I also thought we
were getting along a little bit.
He was also a Beatles fan, so
we had sung Beatles music to
gether and were having as
much fun as you can have on
the island. Especially [having
the comment come] from him
he is not the most engag
ing presence on the island, so
I was surprised to hear that
monologue. I thought he was
really going on and on unnec
essarily. But that's OK. It
made me stronger.
TSD: Has he reached out at
all since the airing of the
episode?
JL: No, he has not
reached out, and I don't ex
pect him to. That's part of the
game, and I don't really take
it personally.
TSD: From next week's
preview, it appears that you
were only one episode away
from the merge. How frus
trating was it to miss out
on that, and what would
your game have looked like
in a post-merge situation?
JL: I was extremely dis
appointed to not make the
merge. That's the ground
breaking point of the game,
and all bets are off in terms
of how the game will go.
Especially if Michael had

been voted off instead of
me, I was ready to do what
I needed to [to] join a
strong alliance that would
hopefully take me along
and set me up to make
some more moves down the
line. But we didn't make it
to that, so I didn't have to
worry about it.
TSD: How did the experi
ence of playing "Survivor"
compare with your expec
tations going in?
JL: "Survivor" was much
harder socially and mentally
that it was physically, which I
was a little bit surprised
about. And I really would be
interested in seeing what it
would be like playing the
game when I have a couple of
more years under my belt. I
think being so young defi
nitely... worked against me
in a lot of ways ... I'm a little
low on [life experience] com
pared with everyone else
who was playing.
That was tough. It was in
teresting being with people
who have such strong person
alities [in] an environment
that was really foreign to me.
I definitely think I jumped in
the deep end, but overall, I
think I didn't expect it to be as
dependent on luck as it was.
You know, if a couple of things
didn't happen —if we didn't
have the tribe swap, if it had
been fans versus fans instead
of fans versus favorites, if I
had gotten on the new Gota
tribe instead of the Bikal
tribe, if a favorite had left me
a little more room there's
just so many "ifs" that could
have changed the game, and
I wasn't prepared for that ei
ther.

TSD: How do you think you
would play the game differ

ently if you were given an
other chance in a couple of
years?
JL: I think I would be a
little bit more on the offense
instead of on the defense. I
went into the game under the
radar. If I played again, I
think I would be a little more
verbal about ideas and strat
egy, but that being said, the
second time playing is so dif
ferent than the first time. I
think all the fans were clear
ly at a disadvantage, so it
would be interesting to see
how a Round 2 would be.
TSD: How do you think
your experience as a Stan
ford student either pre
pared or did not prepare
you for your time out on
"Survivor?"
JL: I was thinking [that]
being at Stanford and being
with a wide range of people
who are really competitive
and really successful would
help me deal with some of
the characters out there. It
definitely did a little bit. Al
so, just being really hard
working and disciplined...
they didn't show this, but I
was working around the
camp all the time. I think an
analogy would be group
work, working with other
people at Stanford. It was in
teresting [and] it was proba
bly more similar to racing
than it was to Stanford, but I
think it was a totally unique
beast. "Survivor" is pretty
crazy.
TSD: After the game, a lot
of contestants say that the
experience of playing on
"Survivor" changed their
lives. Do you think partici
pating in the show will
have any impact on your

life moving forward?
JL: I think playing "Sur
vivor," and being at the mer
cy of producers' edits and
seeing how that played out
definitely gave me a new per
spective on myself. I think it
also required me to grow up a
little bit. I think I'm pretty
mature, but it did force me to
grow up in other ways that I
wasn't expecting, such as be
ing ruthless and being at the
top of your game in do-or-die
situations in very different cir
cumstances than racing or
getting finals done on time. I
think it was a rude awakening
of what the real world could
be like. Since I don't have a lot
of experience in the real world
yet, I think it kind of made me
grow up a little quicker than I
would have otherwise.
TSD: Since your time on
"Survivor" has finished air
ing, what's next for you?
JL: I'm a junior, so I'm going
to be finishing up junior year
and then senior year. I'm go
ing to be racing cars all sum
mer, which I'm very excited
for, and continuing trying to
develop Julia Landauer Rac
ing and get sponsorship and
make it as a professional
racecar driver. I'm really ex
cited to dive into that full
time beginning next year.
TSD: Thank you for your
time, and I was so sad when
I saw you got eliminated
last episode.
JL: I appreciate that. Yeah, it
was pretty much a big bum
mer, but that's OK. It was a
great experience and one that
I would go back and do again
in a heartbeat.

Jeff Probst extinguishes Julia Landauer's torch as the Stanford junior became the next evicted survivor during the reality

er] yet. When I was feeling
that sense of insecurity, I just
decided, "OK, it's time for me
to try and make a big move."
It didn't work, but I gave it
my best. I just think there
wasn't a whole lot that I
could have done differently.
A lot of people were saying it
just looked like there was no

light at the end of the tunnel
for the fans, and I was includ
ed in that.

TSD: How do you think
your game would've been
different if there hadn't
been that tribal swap or if
you had drawn orange
paint and gone to the new
Gota tribe?
JL: Life would have been
grand if I had gone to the Go
ta tribe because I would've
been on a winning tribe for
the first time that season.
Even if there wasn't a swap, I
was sitting in a pretty good
spot on my alliance in the
original fans' tribe, and I was
feeling in control. We knew
that the merge was in the
next week or so the next
couple of episodes —so we
thought if we have to go back
to tribal, we can get rid of
Reynold [Toepfer] and Eddie
[Fox] the people not in our
alliance and that would've
held us off for the merge. But
that didn't happen either,
which is too bad.
TSD: Fellow tribe mate
Phillip Sheppard expressed
plans to make you a "dou
ble agent." In other post
game interviews, however,
you expressed doubts that
he really was sincere about
his intentions, which is
why you made an attempt
to get him eliminated.
What made you doubt that
Phillip really wanted to
take you under his wing?
JL: Yeah, so he had given
me this speech about how he
wanted to make me a double
agent. He said, "You'll be
safe with me." But... he nev
er talked with me about
strategy. If I tried to bring
something up, he wouldn't
have a conversation with me.
And that wasn't really en
couraging. He had talked
with a lot of other people too,
so ... there was a chance he
was still being sincere, but I
wasn't going to bet on it. Be
cause I had that reaction, that
was what led me to approach
Dawn [Meehan, about trying
to get rid of Phillip], which
may or may not have been the
right decision. But there
[weren't a lot] of options to
choose [from],
TSD: In last week's episode,
Phillip referred to you as
"smart, but not college-edu
cated like myself." Was that
just Phillip being Phillip, or
did you not tell other con
testants that you are a Stan
ford student?
JL: I didn't tell other peo
ple that I was a Stanford stu
dent. I was thinking long-term,
and if I made it to the final
three, how likely were people
to vote for me if I was a Stan
ford-educated racecar driver?
I didn't think that I would get
the most votes. I was thinking
long-term. Now, whether or
not that was the right decision,
I'll never know, but it was what
I started out with, so I decided
to stick with it.

TSD: After the tribal swap, I
thought there might be a
chance for you to hit it off
with [John] Cochran, espe
cially since you both have
similar educational back
grounds [Cochran attended
Harvard Law School]. I was
surprised then when I saw
his infamous "vanilla"
monologue in the last
episode. How was it watch
ing that confessional?
JL: It was brutal, especial
ly because I also thought we
were getting along a little bit.
He was also a Beatles fan, so
we had sung Beatles music to
gether and were having as
much fun as you can have on
the island. Especially [having
the comment come] from him
he is not the most engag
ing presence on the island, so
I was surprised to hear that
monologue. I thought he was
really going on and on unnec
essarily. But that's OK. It
made me stronger.
TSD: Has he reached out at
all since the airing of the
episode?
JL: No, he has not
reached out, and I don't ex
pect him to. That's part of the
game, and I don't really take
it personally.
TSD: From next week's
preview, it appears that you
were only one episode away
from the merge. How frus
trating was it to miss out
on that, and what would
your game have looked like
in a post-merge situation?
JL: I was extremely dis
appointed to not make the
merge. That's the ground
breaking point of the game,
and all bets are off in terms
of how the game will go.
Especially if Michael had

been voted off instead of
me, I was ready to do what
I needed to [to] join a
strong alliance that would
hopefully take me along
and set me up to make
some more moves down the
line. But we didn't make it
to that, so I didn't have to
worry about it.
TSD: How did the experi
ence of playing "Survivor"
compare with your expec
tations going in?
JL: "Survivor" was much
harder socially and mentally
that it was physically, which I
was a little bit surprised
about. And I really would be
interested in seeing what it
would be like playing the
game when I have a couple of
more years under my belt. I
think being so young defi
nitely... worked against me
in a lot of ways ... I'm a little
low on [life experience] com
pared with everyone else
who was playing.
That was tough. It was in
teresting being with people
who have such strong person
alities [in] an environment
that was really foreign to me.
I definitely think I jumped in
the deep end, but overall, I
think I didn't expect it to be as
dependent on luck as it was.
You know, if a couple of things
didn't happen —if we didn't
have the tribe swap, if it had
been fans versus fans instead
of fans versus favorites, if I
had gotten on the new Gota
tribe instead of the Bikal
tribe, if a favorite had left me
a little more room there's
just so many "ifs" that could
have changed the game, and
I wasn't prepared for that ei
ther.

TSD: How do you think you
would play the game differ

ently if you were given an
other chance in a couple of
years?
JL: I think I would be a
little bit more on the offense
instead of on the defense. I
went into the game under the
radar. If I played again, I
think I would be a little more
verbal about ideas and strat
egy, but that being said, the
second time playing is so dif
ferent than the first time. I
think all the fans were clear
ly at a disadvantage, so it
would be interesting to see
how a Round 2 would be.
TSD: How do you think
your experience as a Stan
ford student either pre
pared or did not prepare
you for your time out on
"Survivor?"
JL: I was thinking [that]
being at Stanford and being
with a wide range of people
who are really competitive
and really successful would
help me deal with some of
the characters out there. It
definitely did a little bit. Al
so, just being really hard
working and disciplined...
they didn't show this, but I
was working around the
camp all the time. I think an
analogy would be group
work, working with other
people at Stanford. It was in
teresting [and] it was proba
bly more similar to racing
than it was to Stanford, but I
think it was a totally unique
beast. "Survivor" is pretty
crazy.
TSD: After the game, a lot
of contestants say that the
experience of playing on
"Survivor" changed their
lives. Do you think partici
pating in the show will
have any impact on your

life moving forward?
JL: I think playing "Sur
vivor," and being at the mer
cy of producers' edits and
seeing how that played out
definitely gave me a new per
spective on myself. I think it
also required me to grow up a
little bit. I think I'm pretty
mature, but it did force me to
grow up in other ways that I
wasn't expecting, such as be
ing ruthless and being at the
top of your game in do-or-die
situations in very different cir
cumstances than racing or
getting finals done on time. I
think it was a rude awakening
of what the real world could
be like. Since I don't have a lot
of experience in the real world
yet, I think it kind of made me
grow up a little quicker than I
would have otherwise.
TSD: Since your time on
"Survivor" has finished air
ing, what's next for you?
JL: I'm a junior, so I'm going
to be finishing up junior year
and then senior year. I'm go
ing to be racing cars all sum
mer, which I'm very excited
for, and continuing trying to
develop Julia Landauer Rac
ing and get sponsorship and
make it as a professional
racecar driver. I'm really ex
cited to dive into that full
time beginning next year.
TSD: Thank you for your
time, and I was so sad when
I saw you got eliminated
last episode.
JL: I appreciate that. Yeah, it
was pretty much a big bum
mer, but that's OK. It was a
great experience and one that
I would go back and do again
in a heartbeat.

Jeff Probst extinguishes Julia Landauer's torch as the Stanford junior became the next evicted survivor during the reality
show's Tribal Council during the seventh episode of "Survivor: Caramoan" last Wednesday, March 27.
Julia Landauer 'l4, a 21-year-old professional race
car driver and Stanford undergraduate, recently took
part in "Survivor: Caramoan," the latest installation in
the long-running reality series. Landauer sat down
with The Daily to talk about being voted off the show,
her lack of screen time, being compared to the flavor
vanilla and the possibility of a return appearance.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How has it been watch
ing the season progress on national television? I
imagine it must be a unique experience because
while you lived through the events, you are now
watching the editorial decisions and tribe mates'
confessionals for the first time.
Julia Landauer (JL): Yeah, it's been really interest
ing watching this season. It's always funny to see your
self on T\£ and I've only ever seen that in respect to
racing, so this is definitely different. I will admit that
it's been frustrating at times to not have very much
screen time. That being said, I still have a bunch of
people who come out and watch it with me every week.
So it's been fun.
TSD: What has been the response on campus after
the episodes have aired?
Have professors or fellow
students recognized you
from the show at all?
JL: I've had a lot of people
recognize me, which is funny
and it's really great. There
was someone who was on the
ladies' swim team who came
up to me in Ricker Dining
Hall and asked for a picture.
And she totally made my
night. We made each other's
nights, I guess. Then, my TA
in CS 105 had seen me on the
show. It's been a lot of fun. It's
weird to meet people who say,
"Oh, you are on 'Survivor.'"
Some people are really jeal
ous [and] others have never
seen it before, but it's always
a lot of fun.
TSD: Like you mentioned
before, one of my biggest
complaints with "Survivor"
this season is that we didn't
get to see enough of you.
The way the season was ed
ited marginalized your role
in the game. When did you
realize that the edit was go
ing that way, and how frus
trating was it to watch?
JL: By the third episode,
when I still hadn't seen a lot
of myself on the show, I start
ed to worry that it wasn't go
ing to be a super favorable
edit. That being said, I em
braced it and still had a lot of
fun with my lack of screen
time on Twitter and Face
book. All of my supporters
were having a lot of fun with
it too. So I made the best of
it, but it definitely was not
ideal.
TSD: Since we did not get
to see a lot of your game
play, could you talk a little
bit about what your strate
gy was?
JL: I had originally
planned to go out a little un
der-the-radar and not make
any moves right away be
cause you want to keep with
a strong tribe to make it to
the merge. However, once we
had the tribe swap, that
strategy wasn't really going
to work any more. I had to
adapt it a little bit. Michael
[Snow] and Matt [Bischoff]
and I were scrambling from
day one of the new tribe, but
it didn't seem like anything
was going to work. We felt
like we were kind of doomed.
I was getting pretty bad
vibes the day of the immuni
ty challenge, and I hadn't
even gone against Phillip
[Sheppard, a returning play
er] yet. When I was feeling
that sense of insecurity, I just
decided, "OK, it's time for me
to try and make a big move."
It didn't work, but I gave it

ly because I also thought we
were getting along a little bit.
He was also a Beatles fan, so
we had sung Beatles music to
gether and were having as
much fun as you can have on
the island. Especially [having
the comment come] from him
he is not the most engag
ing presence on the island, so
I was surprised to hear that
monologue. I thought he was
really going on and on unnec
essarily. But that's OK. It
made me stronger.
TSD: Has he reached out at
all since the airing of the
episode?
JL: No, he has not
reached out, and I don't ex
pect him to. That's part of the
game, and I don't really take
it personally.
TSD: From next week's
preview, it appears that you
were only one episode away
from the merge. How frus
trating was it to miss out
on that, and what would
your game have looked like
in a post-merge situation?
JL: I was extremely dis
appointed to not make the
merge. That's the ground
breaking point of the game,
and all bets are off in terms
of how the game will go.
Especially if Michael had

been voted off instead of
me, I was ready to do what
I needed to [to] join a
strong alliance that would
hopefully take me along
and set me up to make
some more moves down the
line. But we didn't make it
to that, so I didn't have to
worry about it.
TSD: How did the experi
ence of playing "Survivor"
compare with your expec
tations going in?
JL: "Survivor" was much
harder socially and mentally
that it was physically, which I
was a little bit surprised
about. And I really would be
interested in seeing what it
would be like playing the
game when I have a couple of
more years under my belt. I
think being so young defi
nitely... worked against me
in a lot of ways ... I'm a little
low on [life experience] com
pared with everyone else
who was playing.
That was tough. It was in
teresting being with people
who have such strong person
alities [in] an environment
that was really foreign to me.
I definitely think I jumped in
the deep end, but overall, I
think I didn't expect it to be as
dependent on luck as it was.
You know, if a couple of things
didn't happen —if we didn't
have the tribe swap, if it had
been fans versus fans instead
of fans versus favorites, if I
had gotten on the new Gota
tribe instead of the Bikal
tribe, if a favorite had left me
a little more room there's
just so many "ifs" that could
have changed the game, and
I wasn't prepared for that ei
ther.

TSD: How do you think you
would play the game differ

ently if you were given an
other chance in a couple of
years?
JL: I think I would be a
little bit more on the offense
instead of on the defense. I
went into the game under the
radar. If I played again, I
think I would be a little more
verbal about ideas and strat
egy, but that being said, the
second time playing is so dif
ferent than the first time. I
think all the fans were clear
ly at a disadvantage, so it
would be interesting to see
how a Round 2 would be.
TSD: How do you think
your experience as a Stan
ford student either pre
pared or did not prepare
you for your time out on
"Survivor?"
JL: I was thinking [that]
being at Stanford and being
with a wide range of people
who are really competitive
and really successful would
help me deal with some of
the characters out there. It
definitely did a little bit. Al
so, just being really hard
working and disciplined...
they didn't show this, but I
was working around the
camp all the time. I think an
analogy would be group
work, working with other
people at Stanford. It was in
teresting [and] it was proba
bly more similar to racing
than it was to Stanford, but I
think it was a totally unique
beast. "Survivor" is pretty
crazy.
TSD: After the game, a lot
of contestants say that the
experience of playing on
"Survivor" changed their
lives. Do you think partici
pating in the show will
have any impact on your

life moving forward?
JL: I think playing "Sur
vivor," and being at the mer
cy of producers' edits and
seeing how that played out
definitely gave me a new per
spective on myself. I think it
also required me to grow up a
little bit. I think I'm pretty
mature, but it did force me to
grow up in other ways that I
wasn't expecting, such as be
ing ruthless and being at the
top of your game in do-or-die
situations in very different cir
cumstances than racing or
getting finals done on time. I
think it was a rude awakening
of what the real world could
be like. Since I don't have a lot
of experience in the real world
yet, I think it kind of made me
grow up a little quicker than I
would have otherwise.
TSD: Since your time on
"Survivor" has finished air
ing, what's next for you?
JL: I'm a junior, so I'm going
to be finishing up junior year
and then senior year. I'm go
ing to be racing cars all sum
mer, which I'm very excited
for, and continuing trying to
develop Julia Landauer Rac
ing and get sponsorship and
make it as a professional
racecar driver. I'm really ex
cited to dive into that full
time beginning next year.
TSD: Thank you for your
time, and I was so sad when
I saw you got eliminated
last episode.
JL: I appreciate that. Yeah, it
was pretty much a big bum
mer, but that's OK. It was a
great experience and one that
I would go back and do again
in a heartbeat.

Jeff Probst extinguishes Julia Landauer's torch as the Stanford junior became the next evicted survivor during the reality
show's Tribal Council during the seventh episode of "Survivor: Caramoan" last Wednesday, March 27.
Julia Landauer 'l4, a 21-year-old professional race
car driver and Stanford undergraduate, recently took
part in "Survivor: Caramoan," the latest installation in
the long-running reality series. Landauer sat down
with The Daily to talk about being voted off the show,
her lack of screen time, being compared to the flavor
vanilla and the possibility of a return appearance.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How has it been watch
ing the season progress on national television? I
imagine it must be a unique experience because
while you lived through the events, you are now
watching the editorial decisions and tribe mates'
confessionals for the first time.
Julia Landauer (JL): Yeah, it's been really interest
ing watching this season. It's always funny to see your
self on T\£ and I've only ever seen that in respect to
racing, so this is definitely different. I will admit that
it's been frustrating at times to not have very much
screen time. That being said, I still have a bunch of
people who come out and watch it with me every week.
So it's been fun.
TSD: What has been the response on campus after
the episodes have aired?
Have professors or fellow
students recognized you
from the show at all?
JL: I've had a lot of people
recognize me, which is funny
and it's really great. There
was someone who was on the
ladies' swim team who came
up to me in Ricker Dining
Hall and asked for a picture.
And she totally made my
night. We made each other's
nights, I guess. Then, my TA
in CS 105 had seen me on the
show. It's been a lot of fun. It's
weird to meet people who say,
"Oh, you are on 'Survivor.'"
Some people are really jeal
ous [and] others have never
seen it before, but it's always
a lot of fun.
TSD: Like you mentioned
before, one of my biggest
complaints with "Survivor"
this season is that we didn't
get to see enough of you.
The way the season was ed
ited marginalized your role
in the game. When did you
realize that the edit was go
ing that way, and how frus
trating was it to watch?
JL: By the third episode,
when I still hadn't seen a lot
of myself on the show, I start
ed to worry that it wasn't go
ing to be a super favorable
edit. That being said, I em
braced it and still had a lot of
fun with my lack of screen
time on Twitter and Face
book. All of my supporters
were having a lot of fun with
it too. So I made the best of
it, but it definitely was not
ideal.
TSD: Since we did not get
to see a lot of your game
play, could you talk a little
bit about what your strate
gy was?
JL: I had originally
planned to go out a little un
der-the-radar and not make
any moves right away be
cause you want to keep with
a strong tribe to make it to
the merge. However, once we
had the tribe swap, that
strategy wasn't really going
to work any more. I had to
adapt it a little bit. Michael
[Snow] and Matt [Bischoff]
and I were scrambling from
day one of the new tribe, but
it didn't seem like anything
was going to work. We felt
like we were kind of doomed.
I was getting pretty bad
vibes the day of the immuni
ty challenge, and I hadn't
even gone against Phillip
[Sheppard, a returning play
er] yet. When I was feeling
that sense of insecurity, I just
decided, "OK, it's time for me
to try and make a big move."
It didn't work, but I gave it
my best. I just think there
wasn't a whole lot that I
could have done differently.
A lot of people were saying it
just looked like there was no

light at the end of the tunnel
for the fans, and I was includ
ed in that.

TSD: How do you think
your game would've been
different if there hadn't
been that tribal swap or if
you had drawn orange
paint and gone to the new
Gota tribe?
JL: Life would have been
grand if I had gone to the Go
ta tribe because I would've
been on a winning tribe for
the first time that season.
Even if there wasn't a swap, I
was sitting in a pretty good
spot on my alliance in the
original fans' tribe, and I was
feeling in control. We knew
that the merge was in the
next week or so the next
couple of episodes —so we
thought if we have to go back
to tribal, we can get rid of
Reynold [Toepfer] and Eddie
[Fox] the people not in our
alliance and that would've
held us off for the merge. But
that didn't happen either,
which is too bad.
TSD: Fellow tribe mate
Phillip Sheppard expressed
plans to make you a "dou
ble agent." In other post
game interviews, however,
you expressed doubts that
he really was sincere about
his intentions, which is
why you made an attempt
to get him eliminated.
What made you doubt that
Phillip really wanted to
take you under his wing?
JL: Yeah, so he had given
me this speech about how he
wanted to make me a double
agent. He said, "You'll be
safe with me." But... he nev
er talked with me about
strategy. If I tried to bring
something up, he wouldn't
have a conversation with me.
And that wasn't really en
couraging. He had talked
with a lot of other people too,
so ... there was a chance he
was still being sincere, but I
wasn't going to bet on it. Be
cause I had that reaction, that
was what led me to approach
Dawn [Meehan, about trying
to get rid of Phillip], which
may or may not have been the
right decision. But there
[weren't a lot] of options to
choose [from],
TSD: In last week's episode,
Phillip referred to you as
"smart, but not college-edu
cated like myself." Was that
just Phillip being Phillip, or
did you not tell other con
testants that you are a Stan
ford student?
JL: I didn't tell other peo
ple that I was a Stanford stu
dent. I was thinking long-term,
and if I made it to the final
three, how likely were people
to vote for me if I was a Stan
ford-educated racecar driver?
I didn't think that I would get
the most votes. I was thinking
long-term. Now, whether or
not that was the right decision,
I'll never know, but it was what
I started out with, so I decided
to stick with it.

TSD: After the tribal swap, I
thought there might be a
chance for you to hit it off
with [John] Cochran, espe
cially since you both have
similar educational back
grounds [Cochran attended
Harvard Law School]. I was
surprised then when I saw
his infamous "vanilla"
monologue in the last
episode. How was it watch
ing that confessional?
JL: It was brutal, especial
ly because I also thought we
were getting along a little bit.
He was also a Beatles fan, so

with a wide range of people
who are really competitive
and really successful would
help me deal with some of
the characters out there. It
definitely did a little bit. Al
so, just being really hard
working and disciplined...
they didn't show this, but I
was working around the
camp all the time. I think an
analogy would be group
work, working with other
people at Stanford. It was in
teresting [and] it was proba
bly more similar to racing
than it was to Stanford, but I
think it was a totally unique
beast. "Survivor" is pretty
crazy.
TSD: After the game, a lot
of contestants say that the
experience of playing on
"Survivor" changed their
lives. Do you think partici
pating in the show will
have any impact on your

life moving forward?
JL: I think playing "Sur
vivor," and being at the mer
cy of producers' edits and
seeing how that played out
definitely gave me a new per
spective on myself. I think it
also required me to grow up a
little bit. I think I'm pretty
mature, but it did force me to
grow up in other ways that I
wasn't expecting, such as be
ing ruthless and being at the
top of your game in do-or-die
situations in very different cir
cumstances than racing or
getting finals done on time. I
think it was a rude awakening
of what the real world could
be like. Since I don't have a lot
of experience in the real world
yet, I think it kind of made me
grow up a little quicker than I
would have otherwise.
TSD: Since your time on
"Survivor" has finished air
ing, what's next for you?
JL: I'm a junior, so I'm going
to be finishing up junior year
and then senior year. I'm go
ing to be racing cars all sum
mer, which I'm very excited
for, and continuing trying to
develop Julia Landauer Rac
ing and get sponsorship and
make it as a professional
racecar driver. I'm really ex
cited to dive into that full
time beginning next year.
TSD: Thank you for your
time, and I was so sad when
I saw you got eliminated
last episode.
JL: I appreciate that. Yeah, it
was pretty much a big bum
mer, but that's OK. It was a
great experience and one that
I would go back and do again
in a heartbeat.
