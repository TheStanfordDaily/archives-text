car driver and Stanford undergraduate, recently took
part in "Survivor: Caramoan," the latest installation in
the long-running reality series. Landauer sat down
with The Daily to talk about being voted off the show,
her lack of screen time, being compared to the flavor

imagine it must be a unique experience because
while you lived through the events, you are now
watching the editorial decisions and tribe mates'

Julia Landauer (JL): Yeah, it's been really interest

racing, so this is definitely different. I will admit that
it's been frustrating at times to not have very much
screen time. That being said, I still have a bunch of
people who come out and watch it with me every week.
