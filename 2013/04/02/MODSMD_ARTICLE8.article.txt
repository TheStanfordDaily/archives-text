## Alum denied tenure at Singaporean university 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The decision of a Singaporean univer
sity to deny tenure to Cherian George
Ph.D. 'O3, an associate professor of jour
nalism and publishing known for his con
troversial political views, has sparked in
ternational outrage among academics
amidst broader concerns for freedom of
speech in Singapore.
According to Nanyang Technical Uni
versity (NTU)'s tenure contract policy,
George will have to leave the university
within a year after being denied tenure
twice within three years. George, who
said that he could not speak to the media
until his appeal is decided, has written
three books and numerous articles on
censorship in Singapore.
Professor of Communication
Theodore Glasser, George's dissertation
advisor at Stanford, said that he believed
George was denied tenure for "offending
the political powers in Singapore."
"We know what his record is and
there's no good reason to deny him
tenure," Glasser said, adding that
George's work at Stanford was "top
notch."
Glasser questioned why George's
tenure application was first rejected in
2009, when NTU had promoted George
to associate professor in a move that
Glasser said reflected a positive assess
ment of George's record.
"Usually a promotion and tenure go
hand-in-hand," Glasser said. "There was
no reasonable public explanation for why
he was promoted and at the same time
denied tenure. If he didn't have a good
record, why promote him?"
Several external reviewers selected
by NTU to evaluate George's tenure ap
plication, including Karin Wahl-Jor
gensen M.A. '97 Ph.D. 'OO, professor at
Cardiff University, have spoken out
against the decision to deny George's ap

plication.
According to Wahl-Jorgensen, the ex
ternal reviewers were asked to examine
a "pretty hefty file" of George's work and
determine whether or not it met interna
tional standards for tenure. Wahl-Jor
gensen said that George's tenure appli
cation was 'Toy far the most outstanding
that I've ever seen."
"When I looked at it, I thought, 'This
person should be a full professor and
would probably easily be able to get a job
as a full professor at other institutions,"'
Wahl-Jorgensen recalled.
Several of George's students, includ
ing Eve Yeo Yu Ping, were similarly dis
tressed by the decision to reject George's
tenure application. Yu Ping and three
other NTU students started a petition,
which has gathered nearly 1,000 signa
tures, asking administrators to explain
the decision to deny George tenure.
Yu Ping, who took an introductory
journalism class from George and who
collaborated with him during a reporting
trip to Bhutan, said that the petition or
ganizers decided last year to express
their sentiments if George's tenure ap
plication was denied for a second time.
"We agreed that if it didn't go well
again, we wanted to raise it up in a pub
lic sphere and hopefully get it right," Yu
Ping said.
While Yu Ping described George as a
"very sharp" teacher who made his stu
dents "think outside the box," she was
hesitant to blame NTU for the decision
to deny him tenure.
"We don't want to be accusing the
school of anything," Yu Ping emphasized.
"When we started the petition, it was
never [meant] to reverse the Universi
ty's tenure decision. It was [intended] to
ask the University for transparency and
get it to clarify what it meant by saying
that Cherian's teaching was subpar."
Yu Ping and the other petition organ
izers met with several NTU administra

tors, including Benjamin Detenber, chair
of the Wee Kim Wee School of Communi
cation and Information (WKWSCI), and
Provost Freddy Boey.
According to Detenber, WKWSCI en
dorsed George's tenure application in
2009 and again this year. George's appli
cation was then sent to Liu Hong, Chair
of the School of Humanities and Social
Sciences, as well as NTU's tenure review
committee and the Academic Affairs
Council.
Yu Ping said that the petition organiz
ers were not able to determine exactly
why George's application was rejected at
higher levels of review, as Boey has a pol
icy of not commenting on specific cases.
Detenber, Booey and several other
NTU administrators did not respond to
requests for comment.
Although George may be forced to
leave NTU, he may be able to continue
teaching in Singapore. Students at the
National University of Singapore (NUS)
have written an open letter to NUS ad
ministrators asking them to "proactively
seek out Dr George and have him on our
campus."
"NTU's loss can be NUS' gain," the
letter states. "We urge NUS' leadership
to offer Dr Cherian George a post in
NUS' Communications and New Media
Department, where we believe he will be
able to contribute much in terms of re
search, teaching and service to the com
munity."
Glasser also expressed optimism
about George's career possibilities mov
ing forward, saying that his tenure appli
cation would likely have been accepted at
"just about any other university in the
world."
"I can't think of one that wouldn't be
exhilarated and ecstatic to have Cherian
on the faculty," Glasser emphasized.
