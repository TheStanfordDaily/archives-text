COMPLIT 249 C: Contemporary Iranian Theater
Instructors: Beyzaie, B.
Day and Time: Fri 3:15 PM - 6:05 PM
Classroom: 260-113
Units: 1-3
Today Iranian plays, in both traditional and contemporary styles, are staged in theater
festivals throughout the world and play a role in forming a universal language of theater
which combine the heritages from countries in all five continents. Despite many
obstacles, some Iranian plays have been translated into English, and some prominent
Iranian figures are successful stage directors outside Iran. Forty-six years ago when
"Theater in Iran" (a monograph on the history of Iranian plays) by Bahram Beyzaie was
first published, it put the then contemporary Iranian theater movement—which was
altogether westernizing itself blindly—face to face with a new kind of self-awareness.
Hence in today's generation of playwrights and stage directors in Iran, all know
something of their theatrical heritage. In this course we will spend some class sessions
on the history of theater in Iran, while other sessions will concentrate on contemporary
movements and present day playwrights. Given the dearth of visual documents, an
attempt will be made to present a picture of Iranian theater to the student. Students
are expected to read the recommended available translated plays of the contemporary
Iranian playwrights and participate in classroom discussions.
THINK 26: How Do You Build a Nation? Inclusion and Exclusion in
the Making of Modern Iran
Instructors: Alemdaroglu, A.; Brookshaw, D.; Hart, J.
Day & Time: Please see explorecourses.stanford.edu.
Units: 4
Why were minority religious groups excluded from the majority's vision of a Shi'i Iranian
nation? How and when were women included as citizens of a new Iran? In this course,
specific attention will be paid to key events of the 20th century that shaped modern
Iran: the Constitutional Revolution (1905-11), the 1953 coup, the White Revolution
(1963), the Islamic Revolution (1978-79), the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), and the
post-revolutionary period in general. Through a close reading of key poems, short
stories, and films created in this period, this course will identify major inclusionary and
exclusionary forces in the process of nation-building in 20th-century Iran. Specific
attention will be paid to issues of ethnicity, religion, and gender. In addition to reading
texts (poetry and prose) and watching films, students will be called on to present
critiques of these literary and cinematic products in the form of brief oral presentations
and short writing assignments. The final project will involve interviewing Iranian
expatriates on issues covered in the lectures. Students will work in small groups to
produce short videos of these interpersonal encounters.

COMPLIT 249 C: Contemporary Iranian Theater
Instructors: Beyzaie, B.
Day and Time: Fri 3:15 PM - 6:05 PM
Classroom: 260-113
Units: 1-3
Today Iranian plays, in both traditional and contemporary styles, are staged in theater
festivals throughout the world and play a role in forming a universal language of theater
which combine the heritages from countries in all five continents. Despite many
obstacles, some Iranian plays have been translated into English, and some prominent
Iranian figures are successful stage directors outside Iran. Forty-six years ago when
"Theater in Iran" (a monograph on the history of Iranian plays) by Bahram Beyzaie was
first published, it put the then contemporary Iranian theater movement—which was
altogether westernizing itself blindly—face to face with a new kind of self-awareness.
Hence in today's generation of playwrights and stage directors in Iran, all know
something of their theatrical heritage. In this course we will spend some class sessions
on the history of theater in Iran, while other sessions will concentrate on contemporary
movements and present day playwrights. Given the dearth of visual documents, an
attempt will be made to present a picture of Iranian theater to the student. Students
are expected to read the recommended available translated plays of the contemporary
Iranian playwrights and participate in classroom discussions.
THINK 26: How Do You Build a Nation? Inclusion and Exclusion in
the Making of Modern Iran
Instructors: Alemdaroglu, A.; Brookshaw, D.; Hart, J.
Day & Time: Please see explorecourses.stanford.edu.
Units: 4
Why were minority religious groups excluded from the majority's vision of a Shi'i Iranian
nation? How and when were women included as citizens of a new Iran? In this course,
specific attention will be paid to key events of the 20th century that shaped modern
Iran: the Constitutional Revolution (1905-11), the 1953 coup, the White Revolution
(1963), the Islamic Revolution (1978-79), the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), and the
post-revolutionary period in general. Through a close reading of key poems, short
stories, and films created in this period, this course will identify major inclusionary and
exclusionary forces in the process of nation-building in 20th-century Iran. Specific
attention will be paid to issues of ethnicity, religion, and gender. In addition to reading
texts (poetry and prose) and watching films, students will be called on to present
critiques of these literary and cinematic products in the form of brief oral presentations
and short writing assignments. The final project will involve interviewing Iranian
expatriates on issues covered in the lectures. Students will work in small groups to
produce short videos of these interpersonal encounters.
