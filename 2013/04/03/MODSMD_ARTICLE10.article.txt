# STREAK RUNS TO FIVE
## Lacrosse defeats Fresno State on return from break 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
In its return to the West Coast after the con
clusion of spring break, the No. 10 Stanford
lacrosse team (7-2, 2-0 MPSF) pushed its win
ning streak to five by beating the Fresno State
Bulldogs 21-8 on Tuesday afternoon at Cagan
Stadium.
Early in the first half, it looked like Fresno
State would be able to keep the game close.
However, after the Bulldogs tied the game at 4-
4 with 21:09 left in the first period, the Cardinal
scored 10 of the next 11 goals to take a 14-5 lead
into halftime. Fresno State never threatened
again as Stanford coasted to victory in the sec
ond half.

Stanford's attack saw goals from 10 different
players, led by sophomore midfielder Hannah
Farr (four goals, one assist), freshman attacking
midfielder Julia Burns (three goals, two assists),
sophomore midfielder Emily Newstrom (three
goals) and junior attacker Rachel Ozer (three
goals).

At the other end of the field, the Cardinal de
fense was rarely tested Stanford's high-oc
tane press made it difficult for Bulldogs to cross
midfield with the ball. Farr, Newstrom and jun
ior defender Megan Lerner picked up four draw
controls each as Stanford won 24 of 31 faceoffs.

Junior goalkeeper Lyndsey Munoz, who was
named MPSF Defensive Player of the Week on
Monday, tallied eight saves. Five of Fresno
State's goals came on free position opportunities
in a closely called game.

The Bulldogs opened the scoring just a
minute into the game, but sophomore attacker
Kyle Eraser (two goals, one assist) responded on
the next play to tie the game. The teams traded
free position goals before sophomore midfielder
Meredith Kalinowski gave the Card a 3-2 lead.
Fresno State scored while down a player, but
freshman midfielder Adrienne Anderson (two
goals) answered with a goal on the same man-up
situation. The Bulldogs tied the game at four but

from that point on it was all Card through half
time.
Burns wowed the crowd with a behind-the
back goal with 13:49 remaining to give Stanford
an 8-4 lead.
After freshman midfielder Mackenzie Tesei
(one goal, one assist) scored an unassisted tally
with just under five minutes remaining, Farr ex
ploded for three goals in a three-minute span
that also included a second goal from Burns. All
four of Farr's goals came in the first half. The
sophomore's third goal of the game came after

the Cardinal worked the ball all the way down
the field following a Bulldog turnover.
The score could have been higher if not for
the efforts of Fresno State senior goalkeeper
Katie Wilbur. The senior made 12 saves on the
day, including 11 in the first half as the Cardinal
pelted her net with opportunities but was often
slightly off-target.

"Our shooting was a big part of today we
definitely want to talk about putting more of
