# Card takes to the sand
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's sand volley
ball decisively beat Santa Clara 4-1
in its first match of the inaugural
season at the ACSR Sand Volleyball
Courts.

"For them [the players] it's a
chance to play more volleyball and
to compete in a little different game,
and that just makes them better.
And you get out here and there's
more a social aspect to it," said head
coach John Dunning. "You're out in
the sun, and it's a beautiful place to

play. I think it's fun. They really like
the fun part of it, but it's also a lot of
hard work and they like that."

The first match of the season
was certainly a social scene, with
more than 200 fans supporting the
Card in its opening match. Students
and athletes were able to stop by
and watch the action as they
pleased. Andrew Luck 'l2 and Coby
Fleener 'l2 were even in attendance
to support Luck's sister, junior de
fensive specialist Mary Ellen Luck.
Junior middle blocker Carly
Wopat and freshman outside hitter
Jordan Burgess won the Card's his
toric first sand volleyball game 2-0
over Santa Clara's sophomore out
side hitter Taylor Milton and fresh
man outside hitter Danielle
Rottman. Wopat and Burgess are
the Card's top-ranked pairing and

earned their status by leading the
Broncos the entire game.
In sand volleyball, each school
presents five doubles teams, need
ing a minimum of three wins to cap
ture the match. Unlike indoor vol
leyball, each doubles team plays a
best of three sets, not five.
Wopat, a Santa Barbara native,
grew up playing beach volleyball for
fun and was thrilled when the sport
was added to Stanford's list of varsi
ty athletics. She is just disappointed
that they only get to play one match
a day.

"Coming into the first match, we
[Jordan and I] were trying to have
fun, and as we kept going we start
ed to get better and better, noticing
things and getting used to the
game," Wopat said. "I think if we
keep doing that, keep on improving,

it'll be great. And getting the first
win feels awesome, it's really excit
ing. Jordan and I were just super
stoked and happy."
Many members of the team, in
cluding Dunning, don't have the
background that Wopat has and
are learning the game from
scratch. Inexperience didn't faze
the Card, however, as it went on to
win the next three out of four
games.
No. 3 freshmen outside hitter
Brittany Howard and setter Madi
Bugg dropped the first set but came
from behind to steal the game 2-1,
propelled by a massive kill by
Howard to seal the win.
No. 2 junior outside hitter
Rachel Williams and sophomore
