# Card takes to the sand
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's sand volley
ball decisively beat Santa Clara 4-1
in its first match of the inaugural
season at the ACSR Sand Volleyball
Courts.

"For them [the players] it's a
chance to play more volleyball and
to compete in a little different game,
and that just makes them better.
And you get out here and there's
more a social aspect to it," said head
coach John Dunning. "You're out in
the sun, and it's a beautiful place to

play. I think it's fun. They really like
the fun part of it, but it's also a lot of
hard work and they like that."

The first match of the season
was certainly a social scene, with
more than 200 fans supporting the
Card in its opening match. Students
and athletes were able to stop by
and watch the action as they
pleased. Andrew Luck 'l2 and Coby
Fleener 'l2 were even in attendance
to support Luck's sister, junior de
fensive specialist Mary Ellen Luck.
Junior middle blocker Carly
Wopat and freshman outside hitter
Jordan Burgess won the Card's his
toric first sand volleyball game 2-0
over Santa Clara's sophomore out
side hitter Taylor Milton and fresh
man outside hitter Danielle
Rottman. Wopat and Burgess are
the Card's top-ranked pairing and

earned their status by leading the
Broncos the entire game.
In sand volleyball, each school
presents five doubles teams, need
ing a minimum of three wins to cap
ture the match. Unlike indoor vol
leyball, each doubles team plays a
best of three sets, not five.
Wopat, a Santa Barbara native,
grew up playing beach volleyball for
fun and was thrilled when the sport
was added to Stanford's list of varsi
ty athletics. She is just disappointed
that they only get to play one match
a day.

"Coming into the first match, we
[Jordan and I] were trying to have
fun, and as we kept going we start
ed to get better and better, noticing
things and getting used to the
game," Wopat said. "I think if we
keep doing that, keep on improving,

it'll be great. And getting the first
win feels awesome, it's really excit
ing. Jordan and I were just super
stoked and happy."
Many members of the team, in
cluding Dunning, don't have the
background that Wopat has and
are learning the game from
scratch. Inexperience didn't faze
the Card, however, as it went on to
win the next three out of four
games.
No. 3 freshmen outside hitter
Brittany Howard and setter Madi
Bugg dropped the first set but came
from behind to steal the game 2-1,
propelled by a massive kill by
Howard to seal the win.

The No. 1 pairing of junior Carly Wopat (center) and freshman Jordan Burgess (right) won Stanford's first ever sand volleyball game 2-0, with
set scores of 21-18 and 21-15, and helped lead the team to a 4-1 victory over Santa Clara at the ACSR Sand Volleyball Couds on Tuesday.

Morgan Boukather also won
a shutout match 2-0.
Sand volleyball is the na
tion's re same staff.
"We have some experi
ence on our staff. Denise Cor
lett, our associate head coach
for the indoor team, has been
around [sand volleyball] a lot.
Sara Dukes, our volunteer
coach, played after she played
here as an indoor player," said
head coach John Dunning.
"The main thing that I'm con
cerned with is what this is do
ing to make our indoor team
do better as well. We're com
peting to win here and all 11
who are playing here are on

our indoor team as well, so it's
going to help make our indoor
team better, there's no doubt
about it."
The Card practiced for
two weeks at the end of win
ter quarter, but Monday was
the team's first practice in
three weeks. Until May, sand
volleyball will be the primary
concern of the team, but lat
er this spring there will be
some crossover with indoor
volleyball training and scrim
mages. Sand volleyball helps
keep the team's competitive
edge going during a time
when it would typically be
just doing drills in the gym.
Sand volleyball is great
conditioning for indoor vol
leyball due to the added ele
ment of sand. Drills inside
the gym require a lot more
endurance when done in the
sand, and the players tire a
lot more easily. Points are
quicker since players can't
get to every ball, and more
energy is required for two
players to cover so much
space.
In addition, sand volley
ball is a game of strategy,
since the sand negates power
ful hits and high jumping

blocks. Court sense is key,
and it's important to recog
nize where the ball is going to
be placed since there are only
two players instead of six. Al
so, players can't rely on spe
cialized positions. Everyone
is expected to learn every po
sition and to be all over the
court.
"Most of them [the carry
overs between indoor and
sand] are between your ears
the things that you learn.
You have to learn how to de
pend on each other more be
cause in six sometimes you
can have a role and others
can hide a little bit, but this,
out here, there's no hiding,"
Dunning said. "You can't
cover the court just staying
in two spots. There's a lot of
strategy, so you're partner
has to see it and tell you
about it. There's a lot of real
ly cool interaction â€”vision,
balance it's amazing carry
over for indoor."
The Card continues its in
augural season at the Sacra
mento State tournament this

nize where the ball is going to
be placed since there are only
two players instead of six. Al
so, players can't rely on spe
cialized positions. Everyone
is expected to learn every po
sition and to be all over the
court.
"Most of them [the carry
overs between indoor and
sand] are between your ears
the things that you learn.
You have to learn how to de
pend on each other more be
cause in six sometimes you
can have a role and others
can hide a little bit, but this,
out here, there's no hiding,"
Dunning said. "You can't
cover the court just staying
in two spots. There's a lot of
strategy, so you're partner
has to see it and tell you
about it. There's a lot of real
ly cool interaction â€”vision,
balance it's amazing carry
over for indoor."
The Card continues its in
augural season at the Sacra

Stanford women's sand volley
ball decisively beat Santa Clara 4-1
in its first match of the inaugural
season at the ACSR Sand Volleyball
Courts.

"For them [the players] it's a
chance to play more volleyball and
to compete in a little different game,
and that just makes them better.
And you get out here and there's
more a social aspect to it," said head
coach John Dunning. "You're out in
the sun, and it's a beautiful place to

play. I think it's fun. They really like
the fun part of it, but it's also a lot of
hard work and they like that."

The first match of the season
was certainly a social scene, with
more than 200 fans supporting the
Card in its opening match. Students
and athletes were able to stop by
and watch the action as they
pleased. Andrew Luck 'l2 and Coby
Fleener 'l2 were even in attendance
to support Luck's sister, junior de
fensive specialist Mary Ellen Luck.
Junior middle blocker Carly
Wopat and freshman outside hitter
Jordan Burgess won the Card's his
toric first sand volleyball game 2-0
over Santa Clara's sophomore out
side hitter Taylor Milton and fresh
man outside hitter Danielle
Rottman. Wopat and Burgess are
the Card's top-ranked pairing and

earned their status by leading the
Broncos the entire game.
In sand volleyball, each school
presents five doubles teams, need
ing a minimum of three wins to cap
ture the match. Unlike indoor vol
leyball, each doubles team plays a
best of three sets, not five.
Wopat, a Santa Barbara native,
grew up playing beach volleyball for
fun and was thrilled when the sport
was added to Stanford's list of varsi
ty athletics. She is just disappointed
that they only get to play one match
a day.

"Coming into the first match, we
[Jordan and I] were trying to have
fun, and as we kept going we start
ed to get better and better, noticing
things and getting used to the
game," Wopat said. "I think if we
keep doing that, keep on improving,

it'll be great. And getting the first
win feels awesome, it's really excit
ing. Jordan and I were just super
stoked and happy."
Many members of the team, in
cluding Dunning, don't have the
background that Wopat has and
are learning the game from
scratch. Inexperience didn't faze
the Card, however, as it went on to
win the next three out of four
games.
No. 3 freshmen outside hitter
Brittany Howard and setter Madi
Bugg dropped the first set but came
from behind to steal the game 2-1,
propelled by a massive kill by
Howard to seal the win.

The No. 1 pairing of junior Carly Wopat (center) and freshman Jordan Burgess (right) won Stanford's first ever sand volleyball game 2-0, with
set scores of 21-18 and 21-15, and helped lead the team to a 4-1 victory over Santa Clara at the ACSR Sand Volleyball Couds on Tuesday.

Kyle Gilbert lost 2-1 but
played each set close in the
most competitive match of
the afternoon. No. 4 fresh

Ellen Luck won their match
2-0, and No. 5 freshman mid

and sophomore outside hitter
Morgan Boukather also won
a shutout match 2-0.
Sand volleyball is the na
tion's re same staff.
"We have some experi
ence on our staff. Denise Cor
lett, our associate head coach
for the indoor team, has been
around [sand volleyball] a lot.
Sara Dukes, our volunteer
coach, played after she played
here as an indoor player," said
head coach John Dunning.
"The main thing that I'm con
cerned with is what this is do
ing to make our indoor team
do better as well. We're com
peting to win here and all 11
who are playing here are on

our indoor team as well, so it's
going to help make our indoor
team better, there's no doubt
about it."
The Card practiced for
two weeks at the end of win
ter quarter, but Monday was
the team's first practice in
three weeks. Until May, sand
volleyball will be the primary
concern of the team, but lat
er this spring there will be
some crossover with indoor
volleyball training and scrim
mages. Sand volleyball helps
keep the team's competitive
edge going during a time
when it would typically be
just doing drills in the gym.
Sand volleyball is great
conditioning for indoor vol
leyball due to the added ele
ment of sand. Drills inside
the gym require a lot more
endurance when done in the
sand, and the players tire a
lot more easily. Points are
quicker since players can't
get to every ball, and more
energy is required for two
players to cover so much
space.
In addition, sand volley
ball is a game of strategy,
since the sand negates power
ful hits and high jumping

blocks. Court sense is key,
and it's important to recog
nize where the ball is going to
be placed since there are only
two players instead of six. Al
so, players can't rely on spe
cialized positions. Everyone
