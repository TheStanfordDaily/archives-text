## Sarcasm, Speech and Power 
### Taylor Brady 
Every quarter, the School of
Engineering offers a course
on public speaking: ENGR
103. It is a wonderful class that of
fers a safe forum for students to
practice conveying important ideas to
other people through impromptu
speech and formal presentation. Many
who enroll are international stu
dents who, having learned English
as a second language, want to im
prove their expression. Many of
these students do not feel confident
in their private English speaking
abilities, let alone their skill when
placed under the pressure of a pub
lic forum. Why the course is so pos
itive, it seems, is that students re
ceive constructive feedback on
speeches that they prepare for
every class from fellow students
who must do the same. Regardless
of the linguistic barriers that many
students face, this exercise at least
marginally levels the playing field.
At the end of the quarter, the
students invite guests to a final
night of presentations. To warm
everyone up, the instructor, Matt
Vassar, has five students invite their
guest to give an impromptu speech,
which is then critiqued by the stu
dent who invited them. I was one of
the fortunate guests granted the op
portunity to recount an embarrass
ing tale about my host, and I rel
ished it, if only because it added an
other story to our friendship.
After the public session, the
class split into sections where six or
so students presented their final,
eight-minute speeches on a topic of
their choosing. In our section, my
friend spoke first. Her topic was:
"My Identity." A Chinese national,
she has spent significant amounts
of time abroad for vacation and
schooling, and indicated that, for a
while, the influence of expatriate
living eclipsed any effect that Chi
nese culture had on her. She
claimed, in fact, that for a long time
she understood neither Chinese
culture nor what that meant for her
personal identity. After many
years, though, she has come to the
conclusion that while we cannot
help but reflect, to a certain extent,
the culture borne by our native
tongues and the very earth we in
habit, identity is an idiosyncratic
exercise, one in which we have
some space to choose with what we
want to identify. She cited her own
connection with America through
education, athletics and most im
portantly, language, as an example
of the flexibility of identifying
markers, and encouraged others in
the room to consider the flexibility
of their own cultural identity

Yet the idea of flexible cultural
identity presupposes a degree of
privilege, be it socioeconomic, eth
nic, or as prominently appeared
that evening: linguistic. When dis
parity in that privilege exists, this
is when individuals can struggle to
adopt, or even survive in, the cul
tural landscape of a foreign place.
Immediately following my friend,
another Chinese student spoke

about his struggles learning the
English language. After calculating
in middle school that the probability
of him spending enough time abroad
to make use of his English skills was
only about one percent, he deter
mined that the relative utility of time
that he spent learning English was
only one hour for every hundred of
study Consequently, he decided to
focus much of his intellectual atten
tion elsewhere. This calculation
caused him strife, however, when his
parents told him at 18 that they were
moving to Canada and that he would
have to attend university classes
taught in a language that he barely
knew.

For the first few lectures, he
said, he could not even understand
that there were assignments, let
alone when they were due. Though
he went through a number of har
rowing experiences with linguistic
isolation during his speech, per
haps the most poignant to me was
when he spoke about humor. A
friend of mine once said of her Dan
ish that: "I can speak and under
stand everything that I need to.
But I'm just not funny." Humor is a
marker of deep linguistic proficien
cy because it is so often predicated
upon cultural and historical knowl
edge or rapid wordplay that only
rather proficient speakers can tru
ly understand. So when this Chi
nese student, having learned
enough English to navigate daily
life without help but not enough,
perhaps, to engage with humor in
Canadian English, sat in the front
row and heard his professor try to
connect with students through
jokes, all that he could do was pre
tend to get it and laugh along.
What happened next is one of
the most thoroughly disgusting ex
periences that I have had at this
university. The third student to
speak was a young man whom I
have had the distinct displeasure of
making an acquaintance: an afflu
ent white male, who, instead of
choosing an engaging or challeng
ing topic as did all of his peers dur
ing that presentation, chose the
most patently offensive option pos
sible. His entire speech was about
that lowest form of wit: sarcasm.
Though the entire talk seemed irre
sponsibly off-the-cuff, what offend
ed me most about it was a video clip
that the speaker showed from the
series "Family Guy".
Seth McFarlane isn't really not
ed for his tact. Nor is his humor all

that funny. He spent a universally
excoriated evening this year hosting
the Oscars and spewing misogynist
and homophobic vitriol, so it isn't
surprising that his show would in
clude a clip of a cheap joke made at
the expense of a disempowered
group. Therein, after a white man
walks in soaking wet, clutching an
umbrella, and growls "Nice day
we're having." A caricatured "eth
nic" man (brown skin, curly hair,
thick cartoon lines of hair on his
chest and arms) remarks, "Haha,
yes, he said 'nice day', but he cov
ered with rain... So he said it's when
your brain know, it's not really nice
day...he said the opposite, it's funny."
To make things worse, when he
was taking questions, the speaker
picked out, unprompted, the Chi
nese student who gave the afore
mentioned speech, and said, "You
look like you have a question to
ask." He did this not to coax out an
inquiry in which he was really in

terested, but to embarrass him
even further, if he even understood
that the speaker was trying to
make fun of him.
After every speech, the students
and guests in the audience had the
opportunity to tell the speaker
what they did well before offering
constructive criticisms. I had to
take the opportunity to turn his
puerile technique back upon him.
During the compliments section, I
said, shaking with anger, something
to the effect of, "I think that it was
a great idea to use a racist video
clip to illustrate a useless point but
coincidentally belittle the very
sense of linguistic isolation, espe
cially in humor, that one of your
classmates just spoke for eight
minutes about struggling with."
I'm attuned to the idea that my
own voice, speaking for others, is
not always the best dissent to such
blatant discrimination. Yet nobody
else was speaking up. That suffo

eating silence that sets in when
somebody in power belittles you is
so frustrating, because it is precise
ly in those moments, our faces red
with shame or our hearts smolder
ing with ire, when we must speak
out. The zeppelin-like inflation of
this individual's ego likely prevent
ed him from taking me seriously,
but I am convinced that we must
never let such discrimination off
the hook. Perhaps that's what pub
lic speaking is really about.
Here's my challenge for the
week: speak truth to power. Alter
natively, consider what privilege
you might hold that, reflected in
your speech, inflicts psychological
harm upon other people. Counter
the stifling hegemony that empow
ered groups on this campus profit
from, and even when you feel small,
speak with conviction.
