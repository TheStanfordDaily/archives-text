# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## The 						Disease to Please 
### Ren√®e Donovan 
Overheard at CoHo: "You love
getting people to like you.
But whenever you find out
that one person dislikes you, you
freak out." Naturally, because the
goal is to get everybody on campus
to like you.
Not so much. If everyone likes
you, chances are you aren't showing
your true colors, no matter how
charismatic of a person you are.
Chances are if asked, you wouldn't
know what those true colors are.

The fear of being disliked can
paralyze students in a no man's land
that is all effort, no returns. You try
and try and try to get everyone in
your sorority to like you, but there
is inevitably going to be that one
girl who you just don't click with.
You bite your tongue in section
when an acquaintance starts spew
ing nonsense to keep your weekend
relationship with that same person
glossy and chummy.
All this comes at a high price.
I'm not talking about having a
"moral backbone" or displaying the
same personality in every scenario.
That's unrealistic. I'm talking about
trying to understand who you are
for yourself alone and leaving oth
ers out of it, because let's face it
in the end their opinion of you is not
in your control.
In the vague groping toward un
derstanding who you are, the pres
sure to be Miss Liked By Everyone
can confuse things. When the ques
tion "will they like me?" colors
every outfit, Facebook status, and

sarcastic remark I make, I lose
sight of who I am becoming and
look instead to make everyone
around me happy, even when I know
it's impossible. There is a frighten
ing byproduct of the disease to
please, a virus I'm afraid I've

caught. I catch myself shaping my
personality based on external cues
instead of internal understanding.
The result is contrived and, worse,
conventional. Calculated. Bland.
Vanilla.

Take the Facebook "like" button.
A cursor click that boils down
thoughts, conversations, and expe
rience-sharing to two possible out
comes. A victory and a defeat. Accu
mulate victories and you can stroke
your ego for a few seconds, no mat-

ter how little that external ego re
sembles your inner id. I had no con
cept of the power of the "like" but
ton before I started writing this col
umn. Now it dangles before me like
a carrot on a stick, urging me not to
write better columns, but to write
more "likable" columns.

It feels like striving toward an
aesthetic that is pretty and easily
digestible, instead of one that is
beautiful but complicated and sub
jective. Granted, when the student

body is small and geographically
circumscribed, it pays to be civil and
pleasant to most everyone. Though
I hate to say this, being fake is a
skill worth learning. Do be civil and
bite your tongue if you're about to
blurt out something hurtful, even if
this behavior feels fake. Just learn
how to distinguish between being
fake and becoming fake.
