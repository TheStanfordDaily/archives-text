## Ogwumike nabs AP First Team All-American honors 
### â€“ George Chen 
On the heels of earning Naismith Trophy
finalist honors, junior forward Chiney Og
wumike was named a 2013 Associated Press
First Team All-American on Tuesday.
Chiney and her older sister, Nneka Og
wumike 'l2, became the first sister pair to
earn AP First Team All-American distinc
tions.
Chiney did more than just follow in the
footsteps of her sister, though, as she broke
Nneka's single-season rebounds and career
double-doubles school records this season.
Along with averaging 22.4 points and 12.9 re
bounds per game, the junior star also boasted
a 58.6 field-goal percentage and blocked 62
shots in the 2012-2013 campaign.
Joining Ogwumike on the All-America
First Team are Baylor's senior forward Brit

tney Griner and junior guard Odyssey Sims,
Notre Dame's senior guard Skylar Diggins
and Delaware's senior forward/guard Elena
Delle Donne. With the exception of Sims, all
of the First Team All Americans were also
named finalists for the Naismith Trophy, giv
en to the best women's college basketball
player of the season. The Naismith Trophy
winner will be announced on April 8.
Ogwumike was also named a finalist
along with Griner and Connecticut's senior
guard Kelly Faris for the WBCA National
Defensive Player of the Year for the second
consecutive season. The winner of this award
will also be revealed on April 8 in New Or
leans, the host city of the 2013 NCAA Final
Four.
For the first time in five years, Stanford
women's basketball will not play in the Final
Four, as the Cardinal fell to Georgia in the
Sweet Sixteen round on Saturday.
