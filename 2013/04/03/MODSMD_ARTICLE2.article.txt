## CS advocacy video sparks controversy 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A video produced by Code.org
a nonprofit foundation dedicated
to increasing computer literacy
lamenting a lack of high school pro
gramming courses has sparked in
terest and controversy among stu
dents and professors, with some ex
pressing concern that computer
science (CS) has attained too
prominent a role at Stanford.
The video, which describes cod
ing as a "superpower," has been
viewed over 10 million times since it
was uploaded in February. It fea
tures Microsoft co-founder Bill
Gates, Facebook co-founder Mark
Zuckerberg, musician Will.i.am and
basketball player Chris Bosh
among other prominent individuals
speaking about their experi
ences with coding.

Associate Professor of Comput
er Science Mehran Sahami '92 M.S.
'93 Ph.D. '99, who serves on the
Code.org advisory board, said that
the video was created to increase
awareness of the need for comput
er-literate workers as well as to
demonstrate the empowering na
ture of programming skills for the
broad range of individuals fea
tured.

"The whole message there is
that the ability to program or un
derstand principles from comput
ing is something that is really need
ed on a broad basis," Sahami said.
"In the same way that we think
about reading, writing and arith
metic being broadly applicable
skills, we've moved to an age where
computing is now becoming a
broadly applicable skill."

Computer science's ascent at Stanford
Even as Code.org calls for
greater investment in program
ming education, computer science
has continued to advance rapidly on
the Farm. It recently became the
most popular major at Stanford,
with over 220 students declaring
during the 2011-12 academic year
and â€”by Sahami's estimation
more than 90 percent of students
taking at least one computer sci
ence class while at Stanford.
Enrollment in the CSIO6A: Pro
gramming Methodology introduc
tory course has also continued to
rise, from 964 students in the 2009-
10 academic year to 1,523 students
last year. According to Claire
Stager, manager of educational af
fairs in the department of comput
er science, 1,187 students have en
rolled in CSIO6A this year through
autumn and winter quarter, putting
the course on the path to another
record enrollment total.
"The CS 106 courses are made
to be accessible to students across
a range of majors, not just comput
er scientists and not just engi
neers," Sahami said. "We strongly
believe that it is good for everyone
to have some computing skills, and
so we try to make our classes ac
cessible to everyone."
Sahami attributed the recent
rise in student interest in computer
science to a variety of different fac
tors, including the revision of the
computer science curriculum to
create 10 different tracks, the in
creasing value of programming
skills on the job market, and a
change in public perception about
coding.
Alexander Atallah 'l4, a com
puter science major and an officer
in the Stanford chapter of the As
sociation for Computer Machinery
(ACM), echoed Sahami's senti
ments. As an incoming freshman,
Atallah had planned to major in
economics but changed his mind af
ter realizing that computer science
aligned with his interests and after
discovering the resources available
for computer science majors at
Stanford.
"It's pretty easy to get involved
with things in CS. It's just every
where," he said. "It's not some
thing that I personally want to do
forever I can't see myself sitting
down in front of a computer for the
rest of my life but it's away for
me to penetrate an industry that
I'm interested in."
Controversy over computer sci
ence's prominence
With the recent popularization
of coding through the Code.org
video and movies like The Social
Network, some critics have claimed
that the glamorization of computer
science has resulted in many stu
dents pursuing the subject for the
wrong reasons.

Atallah, who described the
Code.org video as "sensationalist,
to some extent," said that he be-

lieves that the presence of celebri
ties in the video may have an unin
tended effect.

"It was just trying to get the
message out through people that
most viewers would recognize. The
fact that it did that made coding
look a lot more glamorous," Atallah
said. "The reality is that a lot of
people just become programming
monkeys."

Ayush Sood 'l4, a computer sci
ence major and president of ACM
at Stanford, agreed that the video
was "overglamorous." According to
Sood, many computer science stu
dents serious about the subject it
self and less interested in financial
success were upset with the video's
portrayal of computer science as a
means to an end.

"All the stuff that they showed
in the video is true, but to get to
that level where you are working
for Facebook or you are working
for Dropbox or you are working for
Airbnb, you really have to have a
passion," he said. "Sure, it's a glam
orous way to get rich, but there is a
lot of failure in there too."
While Sahami said that he
would recommend that Stanford
establish a computer science re
quirement for all students, Sood
claimed that too many students en
roll in computer science courses
with many "just there to finish the
program."

"I think everyone should have
the exposure to CS and have that
experience, but a lot of people end
up taking it because there is this
mentality that everyone has to take
it, which I think is not true," he
said. "Just because everyone is do
ing it doesn't mean it's a reason to
take it."

Humanities' discontent
By contrast, Professor of Clas
sics Richard Martin said that he be
lieves that learning languages like
Greek and Latin "does more for
you" than coding, and that coding
and the humanities are "on entirely

different levels."
"I think the real difference is
that when you study humanities,
you are doing something for your
self beyond the material and be
yond the immediate," he said. "It's
not a head-to-head contest because
the humanities [are] so much more
necessary than coding."
While Martin said that the pop
ularity of computer science at Stan
ford is understandable, given the
University's history and location in
Silicon Valley, he described a detri
mental effect on the composition of
undergraduate applicants, of which
only 10 to 12 percent express an in
terest in the humanities.

"The real danger these days is
that students don't apply to Stan
ford if they are interested in hard
core humanities subjects. They
think Stanford is simply a technical
university," he said. "I'm happy to
let computer science have all the
buildings and money they want, as
long as they don't take anything
away from the humanities."
After watching the Code.org
video, Martin expressed confusion
as to why the video was created
considering computer science's
ongoing popularity.
" I guess it's driven by the
market they want a lot of hu
man tools to basically code for
them to help them make money, to
be the most cynical about it," he
said. "My problem with it is that it
sounds like this magic ticket to a
job [and] a great life, and nobody
seems to talk about the intellectu
al value of coding in and of itself."

Martin also took issue with a
quote from President John Hen
nessy on the Code.org website, in
which Hennessy encourages all
students to learn how to code.
"I would like to see him and his
peers in the administration come
out and say how important it is for
everybody to do humanities, let
alone Greek and Latin, just to
kind of right the boat [and] to
make it even-keeled again," Mar
tin said.

Martin advocated making a
similar promotional video featur
ing speakers attesting to the pow
er of the humanities as a means of
reducing the disparity between the
humanities and computer science at
Stanford.

"What you're not going to con
vince people [of] is that, if they
[study] humanities, they will get a
cool job where they can play ping
pong in the middle of the day and
have massages, which the
[Code.org] video plays up as well."

It's a glamorous
way to get rich,
but there is a lot
of failure in
there too.
