## CS advocacy video sparks controversy 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A video produced by Code.org
a nonprofit foundation dedicated
to increasing computer literacy
lamenting a lack of high school pro
gramming courses has sparked in
terest and controversy among stu
dents and professors, with some ex
pressing concern that computer
science (CS) has attained too
prominent a role at Stanford.
The video, which describes cod
ing as a "superpower," has been
viewed over 10 million times since it
was uploaded in February. It fea
tures Microsoft co-founder Bill
Gates, Facebook co-founder Mark
Zuckerberg, musician Will.i.am and
basketball player Chris Bosh
among other prominent individuals
speaking about their experi
ences with coding.

Associate Professor of Comput
er Science Mehran Sahami '92 M.S.
'93 Ph.D. '99, who serves on the
Code.org advisory board, said that
the video was created to increase
awareness of the need for comput
er-literate workers as well as to
demonstrate the empowering na
ture of programming skills for the
broad range of individuals fea
tured.

"The whole message there is
that the ability to program or un
derstand principles from comput
ing is something that is really need
ed on a broad basis," Sahami said.
"In the same way that we think
about reading, writing and arith
metic being broadly applicable
skills, we've moved to an age where
computing is now becoming a
broadly applicable skill."

Computer science's ascent at Stanford
Even as Code.org calls for
greater investment in program
ming education, computer science
has continued to advance rapidly on
the Farm. It recently became the
most popular major at Stanford,
with over 220 students declaring
during the 2011-12 academic year
and â€”by Sahami's estimation
more than 90 percent of students
taking at least one computer sci
ence class while at Stanford.
