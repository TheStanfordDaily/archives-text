## Sandberg advocates for gender parity in workforce 
### AARON SEKHRI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I want to ask if you've ever said out loud
the following sentence ... 'I want to be the
number one in my field, I want to be the
CEO of the company I work in, I want to be
president,'" said Sheryl Sandberg, Face
book chief operating officer, to a packed CE
MEX Auditorium on Tuesday evening.
"Stand up if you have."

As some members of the audience stood
up, Sandberg continued her exhortations.
"I'm excited to see people stand up," she
said. "And I'm here today to do just one
thing. I'm here to get every person in this
audience ... to stand up the next time that
question is asked."

Sandberg spoke at Stanford as the 2013
Jing Lyman Lecturer, discussing her new
book and philanthropic enterprise, "Lean
In." The book focuses on the absence of
leadership roles held by women around the
world in fields ranging from business to
government and offers solutions to this lack
of gender parity.

"I want to especially do this for the

women, because the blunt truth is that men
still run the world," Sandberg said. "Un
equivocally. No questions about it."
Citing statistics that demonstrate the in
adequate representation of women in lead
ership roles in society, such as the presence
of only 21 female CEOs in the Fortune 500,
Sandberg explored that inequality's under
lying causes.

Drawing on her personal life, her ac
quaintances and her work at Facebook and
Google, Sandberg identified women's inse
curity about attributing success to them
selves, social stereotypes of working men
and women and an uneven burden in par
enting responsibilities as factors that feed
the lack of female representation.
"The studies show that stalling in junior
high [school], more boys than girls want to
lead," Sandberg said. "That's true on col
lege campuses. That's true of companies, of
divisions [and] of running for office. It is
that leadership ambition gap that we need
to understand, acknowledge and close."
Sandberg argued that the institutional

and societal biases that hold
women back in the workplace
and elsewhere emerge at a
very young age and com
pound over time.
"These stereotypes that
start in childhood are im
mensely self-perpetuating
... and that penalty holds us
back," Sandberg said. "As
men get more successful
they are better liked. As
women get more successful
[and] more powerful, they
are often less liked by men
and women."

"We still expect women to
do the majority of child care
and housework even though
most women who are moth
ers in this country work full
time, and they do," she
added. "I'm fully supportive
of any decision any woman or
man makes about children...

but people should make that
decision once they have chil
dren, because what I see is so
many years before a woman
has a child, women are quiet

ly leaning back, making room
for children and responsibili
ties they don't even have, sit
ting next to men who are not
making those compromises."
Sandberg was hosted by
the Clayman Institute for
Gender Research, an organi
zation that promotes gender
equality internationally. Her
Lean In organization aims to
create more female leaders
by organizing communities
for women to exchange
thoughts and stories, devel
oping an online library of lec
tures in conjunction with the
Clayman Institute and pro
moting Lean In "Circles,"
support networks that aim to
connect women with ambi
tious, like-minded peers.
Sandberg counseled that
although policy and institu
tions matter, change stems
from the individual.

"We can't leave this just to
managers," she said. "We
can't depend on anyone else to
solve that problem. We can try
to educate people, and Lean
In is trying to do that, but the
person that's most likely to
correct this for you is you. My
message, the message of Lean
In, is [to] sit at the table, own

your success [and] don't let
that be the reason you don't
aim for that top job."
"When you have a chance
to stand up for leadership, do
it, stand up," Sandberg said.
'And just do it for yourself.
Do it because every person
who leans in, every woman
who stands up, we do our
part to change those stereo
types."

Sandberg advocated a
number of solutions to the is
sue of gender parity, includ
ing more mentoring specifi
cally for women and having
honest conversations with
employers and partners
about pregnancy and child
care. Reflecting on a hypo
thetical world with gender
parity, Sandberg painted a
Utopian picture.
"We know our companies
would be more productive,"
Sandberg said. "When it
comes to filling our leader
ship ranks, we are only sourc
ing from half the population,
and when we source from the
whole population, we are go
ing to do better."

said. "And I'm here today to do just one
thing. I'm here to get every person in this
audience ... to stand up the next time that
question is asked."

Sandberg spoke at Stanford as the 2013
Jing Lyman Lecturer, discussing her new
book and philanthropic enterprise, "Lean
In." The book focuses on the absence of
leadership roles held by women around the
world in fields ranging from business to
government and offers solutions to this lack
of gender parity.

"I want to especially do this for the

women, because the blunt truth is that men
still run the world," Sandberg said. "Un
equivocally. No questions about it."
Citing statistics that demonstrate the in
adequate representation of women in lead
ership roles in society, such as the presence
of only 21 female CEOs in the Fortune 500,
Sandberg explored that inequality's under
lying causes.

Drawing on her personal life, her ac
quaintances and her work at Facebook and
Google, Sandberg identified women's inse
curity about attributing success to them
selves, social stereotypes of working men
and women and an uneven burden in par
enting responsibilities as factors that feed
the lack of female representation.
"The studies show that stalling in junior
high [school], more boys than girls want to
lead," Sandberg said. "That's true on col
lege campuses. That's true of companies, of
divisions [and] of running for office. It is
that leadership ambition gap that we need
to understand, acknowledge and close."
Sandberg argued that the institutional

on Tuesday about her new book "Lean In" and gender disparity in the workplace.
and societal biases that hold
women back in the workplace
and elsewhere emerge at a
very young age and com
pound over time.
"These stereotypes that
start in childhood are im
mensely self-perpetuating
... and that penalty holds us
back," Sandberg said. "As
men get more successful
they are better liked. As
women get more successful
[and] more powerful, they
are often less liked by men
and women."

"We still expect women to
do the majority of child care
and housework even though
most women who are moth
ers in this country work full
time, and they do," she
added. "I'm fully supportive
of any decision any woman or
man makes about children...

but people should make that
decision once they have chil
dren, because what I see is so
many years before a woman
has a child, women are quiet

ly leaning back, making room
for children and responsibili
ties they don't even have, sit
ting next to men who are not
making those compromises."
Sandberg was hosted by
the Clayman Institute for
Gender Research, an organi
zation that promotes gender
equality internationally. Her
Lean In organization aims to
create more female leaders
by organizing communities
for women to exchange
thoughts and stories, devel
oping an online library of lec
tures in conjunction with the
Clayman Institute and pro
moting Lean In "Circles,"
support networks that aim to
connect women with ambi
tious, like-minded peers.
Sandberg counseled that
although policy and institu
tions matter, change stems
from the individual.

"We can't leave this just to
managers," she said. "We
can't depend on anyone else to
solve that problem. We can try
to educate people, and Lean
In is trying to do that, but the
person that's most likely to
correct this for you is you. My
message, the message of Lean
In, is [to] sit at the table, own

your success [and] don't let
that be the reason you don't
aim for that top job."
"When you have a chance
to stand up for leadership, do
it, stand up," Sandberg said.
'And just do it for yourself.
Do it because every person
who leans in, every woman
who stands up, we do our
part to change those stereo
types."

Sandberg advocated a
number of solutions to the is
sue of gender parity, includ
ing more mentoring specifi
cally for women and having
honest conversations with
employers and partners
about pregnancy and child
care. Reflecting on a hypo
thetical world with gender
parity, Sandberg painted a
Utopian picture.
"We know our companies
would be more productive,"
Sandberg said. "When it
comes to filling our leader
ship ranks, we are only sourc
ing from half the population,
and when we source from the
whole population, we are go
ing to do better."
