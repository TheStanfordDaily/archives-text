## Sandberg advocates for gender parity in workforce

"I want to ask if you've ever said out loud
the following sentence ... 'I want to be the
number one in my field, I want to be the
CEO of the company I work in, I want to be
president,'" said Sheryl Sandberg, Face
book chief operating officer, to a packed CE

the lack of female representation.
"The studies show that stalling in junior
high [school], more boys than girls want to

that leadership ambition gap that we need
to understand, acknowledge and close."
