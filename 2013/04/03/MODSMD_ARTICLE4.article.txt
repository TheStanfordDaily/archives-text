# WOMEN'S SPORTS FEATURE SERIES
## BUILDING THE BASE 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Arlene Rusche has dinner
reservations, but since this is
the last home game of the sea
son for the Stanford women's
basketball team, the cheerful
woman in Cardinal attire isn't leaving
Maples Pavilion until the very end of the
post-game festivities.
Rusche is one of many fans in the are
na who has held season tickets for over 20
years, providing an unusually strong fan
base for the Stanford women's basketball
team. In the 2012-2013 season, an aver
age of 4,180 fans attended home games,
more than double the Pac-12 average and
almost equal to the attendance at Cardi
nal men's basketball games.
But while some women's sports pro
grams on the Farm enjoy broad commu

fans. So far in the 2013 season, the Stan

spectators at each game. Across the
street, the baseball team is drawing an
average of more than 1,500 fans.
Certainly, success is a factor popu

the singles and doubles national titles.
Current junior Nicole Gibbs also appears
on the pro tour and is ranked among the
top 200 players in the world.

we'd like to get more people out to realize
it," said Stanford women's tennis head
coach Lele Forood '7B. "For sports like
ours, it's constantly a challenge trying to

get people to watch."
Marie Vasquez, the assistant athletic
director of marketing at Stanford, said
that both on campus and within the Bay
Area, collegiate sports have to compete
with a multitude of other activities, both
athletic and otherwise. Therefore, it
takes targeted efforts to increase the au
dience for all sports, particularly for
women's games.
Stanford's seven ticketed sports
football, women's volleyball, men's and
women's soccer, men's and women's bas
ketball and baseball each have dedi
cated marketing associates to promote
their events, while the other programs do
not.
Vasquez said that the athletic depart
ment is working to increase awareness of
the high-quality, free events offered at
Stanford. Because of budget constraints,
