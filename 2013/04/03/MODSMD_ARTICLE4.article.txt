# WOMEN'S SPORTS FEATURE SERIES
## BUILDING THE BASE 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Arlene Rusche has dinner
reservations, but since this is
the last home game of the sea
son for the Stanford women's
basketball team, the cheerful
woman in Cardinal attire isn't leaving
Maples Pavilion until the very end of the
post-game festivities.
Rusche is one of many fans in the are
na who has held season tickets for over 20
years, providing an unusually strong fan
base for the Stanford women's basketball
team. In the 2012-2013 season, an aver
age of 4,180 fans attended home games,
more than double the Pac-12 average and
almost equal to the attendance at Cardi
nal men's basketball games.
But while some women's sports pro
grams on the Farm enjoy broad commu
nity support, others struggle to attract
fans. So far in the 2013 season, the Stan

ford softball team has seen less than 450
spectators at each game. Across the
street, the baseball team is drawing an
average of more than 1,500 fans.
Certainly, success is a factor popu
lar teams like women's basketball and
women's soccer have both qualified for
the NCAA semifinals in their respective
sports in five of the last six seasons. How
ever, other successful teams wonder why
they don't receive the same levels of at
tention.
Last season, the Stanford women's
tennis team lost in the quarterfinals of
the team tournament but captured both
the singles and doubles national titles.
Current junior Nicole Gibbs also appears
on the pro tour and is ranked among the
top 200 players in the world.
"It's a very high level of tennis and
we'd like to get more people out to realize
it," said Stanford women's tennis head
coach Lele Forood '7B. "For sports like
ours, it's constantly a challenge trying to

get people to watch."
Marie Vasquez, the assistant athletic
director of marketing at Stanford, said
that both on campus and within the Bay
Area, collegiate sports have to compete
with a multitude of other activities, both
athletic and otherwise. Therefore, it
takes targeted efforts to increase the au
dience for all sports, particularly for
women's games.
Stanford's seven ticketed sports
football, women's volleyball, men's and
women's soccer, men's and women's bas
ketball and baseball each have dedi
cated marketing associates to promote
their events, while the other programs do
not.
Vasquez said that the athletic depart
ment is working to increase awareness of
the high-quality, free events offered at
Stanford. Because of budget constraints,
the marketing team emphasizes digital



advertising using social media,
email and the web to reach the
largest possible audience.

"If we could throw additional
dollars to the overall marketing of
our programs, we'd do that across
the board," said Stanford Athletic
Director Bernard Muir. "But we're
trying to be strategic."

Stanford Athletics Senior
Woman Administrator Beth Goode
emphasized that while the athletic
department works to support all
teams equally, there are cultural
differences that lead to varying lev
els of fan interest.

Goode said that traditionally,
marketing for all women's athletics
has been "very grassroots," with
athletes relying on friends from
dorms, sororities or classes to come
support them personally, as op
posed to men's sports which often
attract those who are just "fans of
the game overall."

For both men's and women's
teams, the administration also tries
to facilitate interaction with young
fans through events like Autograph
Nights and connections to local
groups such as the Bay Area
Women's Sports Initiative, a San
Jose-based organization that works
to expose young girls to sports.
Muir pointed to women's
lacrosse as a sport that will benefit
from increased interest on the West
Coast, especially at the youth level.
"Over time, you'll continue to
see that kids and their parents and
families come out," Muir said. "So
we just need to provide greater ex
posure to those programs, and yes,
there's still work to be done."

Vasquez said that women's soc
cer has maintained such strong at
tendance because of the Universi
ty's community outreach. The pro
gram often invites youth teams to
walk the players out during the na
tional anthem, participate in strate
gy talks with the team or serve as
ball boys and girls.
"When you incorporate fans into
the game experience, they are more
invested in wanting to come,"
Vasquez said.

Stanford women's soccer coach
Paul Ratcliffe said that his players
work to cultivate those relation
ships because the stadium environ
ment both energizes the players on
the field and provides a big draw
when it comes to recruiting.
"Every young player wants to
play in front of a crowd and feel like
they are loved and appreciated,"

Ratcliffe said. "When you come to
Stanford and see one of our games,
you can see that our players have a
lot of people supporting them."

The women's basketball team al
so benefits from a long-standing
personal connection with fans, al
beit of an older generation.
Patty White '62 and her husband
Edward '6O MBA '62 have held sea
son tickets to women's basketball
since the 1989-1999 season, the first
year season tickets were sold. The
Whites were also original members
of the Fast Break Club, an unofficial
fan club that played an instrumen

tal role in developing support for
women's basketball.
Although the fundraising activi
ties of the Fast Break Club have
mostly been folded into Stanford
Athletics' Buck/Cardinal Club
which supports all Cardinal athlet
ic programs at Stanford the
group continues to draw fans to the
arena.
"When the Fast Break Club
started, after games, we met in a
tent outside the old Maples Pavil
ion," Patty White said. "A real com
munity built among those of us who
went to the tent."
Rusche said that she has sat in
the same row with six or eight of
her friends since they first bought
season tickets together 20 years
ago. Rusche continues to come to
home games and travels to the
NCAA Final Four even if Stanford
doesn't qualify.
"The character-building is out
standing," Rusche said. "Through
out the 20-plus years we've been in
volved, you have the same feeling
that these gals are going to do won
derful things and part of that is due
to the athletics that they have par

ticipated in."
Stanford women's basketball
star Chiney Ogwumike said her
team is appreciative of the support
provided by the Fast Break Club
and other fans, especially when
they take the time to get to know
players off the court.
"We don't have a huge arena
filled with 30,000 people," Ogumike
said, "but we have a solid 5,000 that
come and support us for the entire
duration no matter who were are
playing and no matter what the
score is."

All administrators interviewed
said the athletic department hopes
to create that type of support for all
teams on The Farm.

"We're really trying to get peo
ple to come out and watch [all]
teams because they're very com
petitive at the highest level." Muir
said. "It may just be a particular
game, or games, that we highlight,
but we're really trying to encourage
people to come out and watch these
teams."
