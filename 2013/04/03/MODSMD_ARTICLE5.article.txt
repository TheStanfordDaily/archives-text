# Class2Go merges with edX
## University to collaborate with MIT, Harvard on online learning platform 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
University administrators have announced plans to
merge Class2Go, Stanford's online course platform,
with edX, a nonprofit online learning enterprise found
ed by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology (MIT), producing a joint open source online
learning platform that will first be available in June.
The merger represents an emerging collaboration
between the University and edX with the goal of devel
oping a "massive free open source online learning plat
form for any university in the world," according to a
statement by University spokesperson Lisa Lapin.
Anant Agarwal, president of edX, expressed excite
ment about working with Stanford.
"It has been our vision to offer our platform as open
source since edX's founding by Harvard and MIT,"
Agarwal told The Stanford Report. "We are now realiz
ing that vision, and I am pleased to welcome Stanford
University, one of the world's leading institutions of
higher education, to further this global open source so
lution."

EdX, which was launched in fall 2012, currently
hosts free online courses from Harvard, MIT and the
University of California, Berkeley. The platform has an
nounced plans to incorporate material from Wellesley,
Georgetown and the University of Texas system in fall
2013, and will expand to feature international universi
ties beginning in 2014.

On June 1, 2013, edX will become an open source
platform, making its source code available to the public
through the Platform Repository. Features from
Class2Go, which has been an open source platform since
Jan. 2013, will be integrated into the edX platform.
According to Vice Provost for Online Learning John
Mitchell, Stanford's Class2Go development team has
been working with representatives from edX to ensure
that the codes will be synchronized and the two plat
forms easily merged.

While administrators plan to focus future platform
development on the new collaboration with edX, Stan
ford courses will still be offered on other platforms such
as Coursera and iThnes U.

"We will continue to use multiple online learning
platforms and determine which platform and approach
best serves the educational goals put forward by our
faculty and what best matches then- interests," Mitchell
told The Stanford Report. "But we will focus our devel
opment efforts on a single, open source platform which
makes the most efficient use of our time and resources."
