## Senate plans post-election transition 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
At a Tuesday meeting notable at 25 min
utes in duration primarily for its brevity, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate discussed the up
coming ASSU elections and then- plans to facili
tate a smooth transition for next year's Senate.
After several committee chairs announced
that they were working on transition documents,
Deputy Chair Garima Sharma 'l5 suggested
that the Senate create a transition subcommit
tee to advise the incoming Senate.
"In two weeks, we shall be replaced, which is
scary but good," Sharma said. "I was thinking of
having some sort of transition document in
which we list all of the important things that we
have been working on and all of the things that
we have not been able to deal with that we would
potentially like [the next Senate] to deal with."
Senators Viraj Bindra 'l5, Kimberly Bacon
'l5, Daniela Olivos 'l5, Brandon Hightower 'l5,
Lauren Miller 'l5 and Sharma expressed inter
est in serving on the subcommittee.
Senator Ismael Menjivar 'l5 announced that
the Senate had held an informational workshop
for candidates, motivated by an article in The
Daily about candidates' general lack of knowl
edge about the Senate.
'Around 15 candidates showed up, which is
like half," Menjivar said. "We just gave them ad-
vice on running for Senate
and what [the] Senate does,
so at least they are a little bit
more informed. At least half
of them are."
The Senate also discussed
the timeline for approving
next year's ASSU budget af
ter Assistant Financial Man
ager Stephen Trusheim 'l3
M.S. 'l4 asked senators about
their plans for the budget.
Some of the most notable
recent budget changes oc
curred in 2011, when presi
dential discretionary spend
ing increased by 31 per
cent and senators debat
ed the $16,000 allocated to
Executive Cabinet member
salaries.
However, Trusheim said

that many elements of the
budget are generally left un
changed each year, including
presidential and vice presi
dential salaries that have
"stayed pretty much constant
for 10 years."
"I don't think there have
been any world-changing [ad
justments] in the budget.
There is only a certain
amount of money every year,
and it pretty much goes to
the same things every year,"
Trusheim said. "The scale of
money we're talking about is
so low that you really can't
do much with it unless you
take it all and put it some
where."
Before discussing next
year's budget, senators gave
individual committee up
dates. Academic Affairs
Committee Chair Shahab Fa
davi 'l5 reported on further
communications with Vice
Provost of Undergraduate

Education Harry Elam re
garding student concern
about a proposal by Universi
ty Registrar Tom Black to
schedule popular courses at
8:30 a.m. and ban double
booked schedules.
The Academic Affairs
Committee hosted a meeting
with Elam on Feb. 28 attend
ed by an estimated 40 to 50
students, at which attendees
questioned Elam about the
course-scheduling proposal.
"The miscommunications
about a lot of the things that
were being proposed were
clarified at the meeting," Fa
davi said. "[Elam] took the
feedback really well, and that
translated into tangible ac
tions."
Fadavi said that the Facul
ty Senate decided to post
pone a vote on the proposal
until May delaying the
proposal's implementation
until the 2014-15 academic

yearâ€” so that more feed
back from students could be
solicited. According to Fa
davi, the Faculty Senate will
likely vote on a revised ver
sion of the original bill.
"There are a lot of issues
coming up in terms of stu
dents dealing with the admin
istration and conflicts in
terms of their interests," Fa
davi said. "I think what this
represents, hopefully for
R&DE and other administra
tors as well, is that it's possi
ble to come up with a positive
and friendly solution where

you have student feedback in
cluded."
The proposal will be dis
cussed further at a town hall
meeting this evening.
Senators also heard a re
port from Miller, who said
that the petting zoo hosted by
the student life committee
during dead week was ex
tremely successful, despite
what Bindra described as a
"minor hiccup."
"Someone thought it
would be funny to call the po
lice and say that animal cruel
ty was going on, but they de

termined that it was a joke
call," Miller said. "The police
were very friendly and went
in the petting zoo and played
with the animals, so it worked
out great."
Though Appropriations
Committee Chair Nancy
Pham 'l4 was not present at
the meeting and no funding
bills were presented, Senator
Christos Haveles 'l5 re
marked, "Appropriations is
continuing to appropriate."
