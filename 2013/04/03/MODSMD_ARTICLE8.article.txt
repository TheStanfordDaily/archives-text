## Researchers advance mobile learning pilot 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an effort to encourage collabo
ration and independent inquiry
among students, a Graduate School
of Education (GSE) program found
ed in 2005 has leveraged mobile de
vices to offer an interactive learning
experience to 23,000 students in 25
countries.

The Stanford Mobile-Inquiry
Learning Environment (SMILE)
program, which permits students to
use mobile devices to create, share
and evaluate questions about educa
tional topics, was founded by Paul
Kim, chief technology officer and as
sistant dean of the GSE.

After visiting schools in the mi
grant community in Baja California,
Mexico, Kim realized that the class
room system was similar to that of
many American schools, with stu
dents memorizing material present
ed by teachers in lecture form.
"Most students around the world
are not being given the opportunity
to make their own inquiries," Kim
said. "This a common challenge in
every classroom. Most of the time it's
a teacher-dominated class where stu
dents are not given enough opportu
nity to reflect on the content and
principles that they find interesting."
SMILE has been piloted in devel
oped and underdeveloped communi
ties around the world, with users
ranging from elementary school chil
dren in rural India to students at the
Stanford School of Medicine. Accord
ing to Kim, SMILE increases stu
dent engagement and encourages
collaborative work, which can be
lacking in schools with curriculums
that do not emphasize "higher order
learning activities" like critical think
ing, analysis, creation and evaluation.
"I was frustrated," Kim said.
"Why are we not updating the peda
gogy in the classrooms when every
thing else is evolving and changing,
and we have 21st century children
with 21st century literacy?"
Kim has recruited Stanford stu
dents, such as Aaron Sharp M.A. 'll,
to work on SMILE pilot programs.
Sharp was involved with a program
at Ellis Elementary School in Palo
Alto and traveled to Argentina on a
SMILE trip with Kim last August.
"The kids were excited and en
gaged," Sharp recalled. "[They were]

particularly excited about using
phones in class, but also excited about
the questions they were making and
the fact that immediately their peers
were reading their questions and an
swering their questions."
Both Sharp and Kim emphasized
the value of community support in
the program's success, especially in
foreign or underdeveloped areas,
with Kim describing SMILE's part
ners as the "most critical component"
in the program's work.

"They are the ones that know
about the community, the culture and
the people there," Kim said. "If they
do not value whatever you present,
no matter how innovative it may have
been in your lab, they're not going to
appreciate it, and they're not going to
use it."

Arafeh Karimi, a SMILE re
search assistant who also worked on
the Argentina pilot, said that she be
came involved with the program after
meeting Kim at a conference in 2010.

"The ecosystem that SMILE cre
ates is very unique," Karimi said. "It
empowers the community to work on
its own and allows kids especially
street kids â€”to see education in a
different way not just sitting
down, working and memorizing."
Especially in underdeveloped re
gions, SMILE has faced several sig
nificant challenges. At some schools,
students lack books or teachers, and
electrical power can suddenly be
come unavailable because of in
clement weather. As a result, Kim has
created several pilot versions that al
low for the use of the program with
out Internet or electricity, including a
SMILE plug-in that creates an ad
hoc network for users.

Looking to the future, Sharp, Kim
and Karimi said they aim to continue
to improve SMILE technology and to
make the infrastructure more easily
accessible to students around the
globe, as well as allowing students in
different locations to collaborate
through the program.

"Peers in the same classroom can
use SMILE to evaluate and learn
from each other within the communi
ty," Karimi said. "But with global
SMILE you can build bridges. Glob
al SMILE would be communities
teaching other communities."
