## The 						real world of fantasy baseball 
### Winston Shi 
The first thing I ever wrote
at my high school newspa
per was a missive about my
high school fantasy base
ball league.

Well, that's not entirely correct:
the first thing was a piece about a
friend's interest in photography,
which looking back was (surprisingly)
something that could be character
ized as "actual reporting."
However, spiritually, the real first
thing I wrote was something ridicu
lous about fantasy baseball. I think it
involved me mocking my friend
Jamie about a dumb trade he made
(although it was a defensible opinion
in hindsight, which is something that
most thirteen-year-olds can't neces
sarily claim).

Now, you have to get in the busi
ness somehow, and in any case the
school newspaper was always in need
of more copy to fill space. So in that
sense, needlessly insulting a friend in
print actually served a purpose. But
why I should have cared to mock
Jamie there, I don't quite know. It was
n't mean-spirited —I know Jamie and
myself well enough for that. It was
more because I just wanted to talk
about fantasy baseball, and on a public
forum to boot.

This short factoid encapsulates so
much about the absurdity that has
been my four years of fantasy baseball
an intensely alive interest in some
thing that, by definition, does not real
ly exist and is shamelessly irrelevant. I
cannot imagine why I should care
about anything that happens to the As
tros, for example although Yu
Darvish did destroy them yesterday,
which was entertaining—but I really
don't have a choice in the matter, un
less I'm okay with losing, and I am not.
In any case, regardless of the ab
surdity I kicked off a fifth year last
night with the first fantasy draft of our
post-high school career. Yes, it was past
Opening Day, but when you have
league members scattered on three
continents, certain sacrifices must be
made to scheduling concerns. I sup
pose that says something else about us
too; it's not really about the game at all.
It was more about us.

To that extent, we were definitely
far too obsessed with fantasy in high
school; our cult-like devotion definitely
got silly at times. I'd like to think that
we were self-aware about it, to the
point where our silliness was intention
al —before you point out that you
have a great fantasy baseball league
too (and I'm sure you do), I will point
out that we produced an hour-long doc
umentary about the league in our sen
ior year, which is about as dorky as you
can get.
Fantasy baseball symbolizes some
thing special to me; that much is obvi
ous. At the very least, the camaraderie
is always there, and as I watch Shaq
crack jokes about Jack Nicholson at
his LA Lakers jersey retirement cere
mony, all the cheering fans in the stadi
um seem to join with me in celebration,
and even though Shaq definitely left
the team on fairly bad terms, it serves
to remind me that celebration and
community have a tendency to wipe
clean the slate and give us a fresh start
on something new.
It occurs to me that MLB Opening
Day is the exact symbol of this the
boys of summer, of carefree youth and
of endless beauty—and perhaps fan
tasy baseball is not so different from
actual baseball as I had previously
thought.

Am I going to remember the fact
that during the draft, the Internet
failed again and again; that I spent the
damnable enterprise in a constant
state of paranoia (because not being
able to make your own draft picks is
clearly the end of the world); that, by it
sell) the draft was not particularly km?
I don't think so. Even so, I'm exhilarat
ed, if only because I've guaranteed that
my bonds with my closest Mends will
persist for another year and hopefully
another and another and another. And
even right now I keep on kicking my
selij realizing that I can't do justice to
what just being with Mends meant to
me —but I know that they wouldn't
mind. They know perfectly well how I
feel, and I suppose that is enough.

Winston Ski fears that one day; once
he graduates and joins the real
world he may have to retire his fan
tasy baseball jersey. In the mean
time, though, cheer him on at
mhiSJf@stanford.edu.

It's not really
about the
game at all.
