# Giants will thrive off low expectations
## 
### Joey Beyda 
Why don't the San
FTancisco Giants
get any respect?
Twenty-three of
ESPN's 38 ex
perts picked San Francisco to win
the NL West, and just about all of
them saw Los Gigantes making the
playoffs. But not one of them ex
pected that the Giants would make
the World Series. Sports Illustrated
didn't even pick San Francisco to
make it out of the first round.
My Giants are the reigning World
Series champs, return the exact
same pitching staff and lineup that
got them through last October and
get back a fully healthy Buster Posey,
the 2012 league MVP who was still
coming back from a devastating knee
injury last season. Heck, we've won a
World Series every single year
we've had Posey on the roster for
the division race.
The St. Louis Cardinals were
pretty clutch that one time, but no
team has proven itself as a more
reliable postseason contender than
the Giants over the last three sea
sons. If it wasn't enough to go 3-1
against Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee
in 2010, then winning six straight
elimination games before sweeping
the Series surely should've turned
some more heads in 2012.
The Giants' mantra of dominant
pitching and just enough hitting
simply isn't seen as sustainable by
many analysts. Instead, success
like the Giants' is branded as fluky.
As SI noted in its season preview
this week, teams that succeed in
one-run games in a single season
tend to regress to the mean the
next one.
Yet San Francisco has gone over
.500 in one-run games in each of
the last three seasons, including a
7-1 postseason record in such con
tests. When you're built to win in
those situations season after sea
son, there's more than just luck in
volved.
That's got to remind you of the
2012 Stanford football team, which
won nine games by a touchdown or
less last season and earned a covet
ed Rose Bowl berth.
Like the Giants, the Cardinal
isn't flashy compared to the rest of
the league and it still gets the job
done. But even though Stanford is
losing more key pieces this offsea
son— a three-year starting run
ning back and two of the best tight
ends in the country than San
Francisco is, the Cardinal is a
near-consensus preseason top-five
team and a popular choice to make
the national title game.
Sure, that's due in large part to
the fact that Stanford's returning
players will be a year more expe
rienced this time around and,
thus, have a leg up on less experi
enced college athletes. But can't
the same be said for the Giants?
San Fransisco's top three pitch
ers, along with defensive studs
Posey, Brandon Belt and Brandon
Crawford, are still in their mid
twenties and are maturing on a
yearly basis.
It's true that dynasties
are rare in professional
sports nowadays; if the Gi
ants won a third champi
onship in four years, they
would be the first Ameri
can pro team to do so since
the 2001-04 New England
Patriots. But the MLB is
the one league that still
doesn't have a salary cap. If
it's going to happen some
where, it's going to happen

in baseball.
You're hearing it here
first and I really do mean
first, because nobody else
seems to think this but
the Giants are the clear
choice to win the NL this
season. They've got more
chemistry than the high
budget Dodgers, more expe
rience than the unproven
Nationals and more reliable
pitching than the offensively
oriented Braves. San Fran
cisco has won six playoff se
ries over the last three years;
those teams, combined, have
won none. So why are L.A.,
Washington and Atlanta

widely viewed as the fa
vorites?
I shouldn't be complain
ing; the Giants have made a
point of thriving on the rest of
the world's low expectations.
But I can't help but feel that
San Francisco has earned just
a little bit more respect over
the last three seasons.
See you in October.

Joseph Bey da will defend the
Giants to the death (and
might have to). Feel free to
