## Longest losing skid snapped 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford earned a much-needed win on Tues
day against Pacific, snapping a four-game losing
streak and entering a three-game road trip on a
positive note.
Stanford needed to find the intensity and

teamwork it had
been lacking of
late, and it did
just that. The No.
8 Cardinal (13-10,
10-10) beat Pacific
for the 11th con-

secutive time on the road, ending the Cardinal's
longest losing streak since 2007. Prior to Tues
day's win, Stanford had lost to both No. 2 Long
Beach State and No. 10 Cal State Northridge,
ending its winning streak at Maples.
While Stanford has dropped from No. 6 to
No. 8 in the NCAA national rankings, its win
against Pacific could prove to be a much-needed
positive turn as the Cardinal prepares to face
both N0.4 UC-Irvine (18-6) and UC San Diego
(7-18) on the road this week. Stanford only has
four more matches, all on the road, before the
MPSF Tournament. Only the top eight teams in
the MPSF go to the tournament and get the
chance to play for an automatic bid in the NCAA
tourney. Currently, the Cardinal is in a three
way tie for sixth, so winning the next matches is
crucial if the Stanford wants a place in the post
season.
In order for the Cardinal to be successful this
week against the Anteaters and Tritons, the
team needs to continue the strong team effort
and aggressive offense that it had against Pacif
ic. Pacific is a very strong defensive team
third in the MPSF in blocking and second in digs
