## Longest losing skid snapped 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford earned a much-needed win on Tues
day against Pacific, snapping a four-game losing
streak and entering a three-game road trip on a
positive note.
Stanford needed to find the intensity and

teamwork it had
been lacking of
late, and it did
just that. The No.
8 Cardinal (13-10,
10-10) beat Pacific
for the 11th con-

secutive time on the road, ending the Cardinal's
longest losing streak since 2007. Prior to Tues
day's win, Stanford had lost to both No. 2 Long
Beach State and No. 10 Cal State Northridge,
ending its winning streak at Maples.
While Stanford has dropped from No. 6 to
No. 8 in the NCAA national rankings, its win
against Pacific could prove to be a much-needed
positive turn as the Cardinal prepares to face
both N0.4 UC-Irvine (18-6) and UC San Diego
(7-18) on the road this week. Stanford only has
four more matches, all on the road, before the
MPSF Tournament. Only the top eight teams in
the MPSF go to the tournament and get the
chance to play for an automatic bid in the NCAA
tourney. Currently, the Cardinal is in a three
way tie for sixth, so winning the next matches is
crucial if the Stanford wants a place in the post
season.
In order for the Cardinal to be successful this
week against the Anteaters and Tritons, the
team needs to continue the strong team effort
and aggressive offense that it had against Pacif
ic. Pacific is a very strong defensive team
third in the MPSF in blocking and second in digs

and therefore Stanford's
road win against the Tigers'
defense was a great offensive
accomplishment.
Senior Steven Irvin
proved the leader of the of
fense once again with his sec
ond consecutive double-dou
ble. Junior Brian Cook also
had 13 kills and redshiit soph
omore Daniel Ttiblin added to
the offense with 10 kills.
The team looked stronger,
more confident and very con
sistent. It was just the type of
win needed going into the fi
nal stretch of the regular sea
son.
UC-Irvine's defense is
very similar to Pacific's, both
strong and dependable. Stan

ford must look to be aggres
sive against UC-Irvine, focus
ing on strong hitting to over
come the Anteaters' strong
net defense. Stanford can also
look to take advantage of UC-
Irvine's recent struggles, as
the Anteaters have lost three
of their last six.
Stanford will need to con
trol UC-Irvine's leading hit
ter in Kevin Tillie, a first
team Ail-American last sea
son, while it looks to re
venge its loss at home against
the Anteaters earlier in the
season.
UC-San Diego, on the oth
er hand, has been experienc
ing recent success and im
provement, despite being last
in the MPSF. The Tritons lost
at Maples earlier this season
and are overall weak offen
sively. If the Cardinal can
start out aggressively and
build a fast lead, it should be

able to keep UC-San Diego
from avenging its loss against
the Cardinal.
The Tritons, however,
have proven they can pull out
a win during a five-set match.
Stanford is faced with a
critical point in its season. It
has the opportunity to build
off its victory against Pacific
and overcome a difficult los
ing streak in order to guar
antee a place in the MPSF
Tournament. On Tuesday,
the team looked like it had
used its recent struggles as a
learning and improving expe
rience and looked stronger
than ever as a team unit. The
Cardinal's seeming improve
ment will be put to the test this
week against UC-Irvine on
Friday and UC-San Diego on
Saturday.
