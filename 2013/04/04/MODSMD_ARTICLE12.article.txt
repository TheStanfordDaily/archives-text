### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford traveled to Cor
vallis, Ore,, seeking a road se
ries win against a quality oppo
nent in order to further bolster
its bid for a top seed in the
NCAA Tournament. Consider
that mission accomplished. In a
three-game set that played out
over the course of two days,
No. 14 Stanford won two of
three against No. 14 Oregon
State (24-11,1-5 Pac-12) to im
prove to 26-10 on the season
and 4-5 in Pac-12 play.
Prior to this series, pitching
and fielding figured to be areas
of weakness for the Beavers.
Right on cue, the Cardinal
masterfully exploited these de
ficiencies, tallying 15 runs and
forcing four errors in a double
header sweep on Tuesday af
ternoon. Although the Card
fell 4-3 in Wednesday after

noon's finale, Stanford still av
eraged six runs per game and
hit .295 against the Beavers.

Senior Jenna Rich had a se
ries to remember, as the El Se
gundo, Calif., product hit .545
and drove in five runs during
the three-game set. Rich's
defining moment this week
came in the second game of
Tuesday's doubleheader. The
third-team Ail-American and
Pac-12 first-team selection
went 3-for-4 at the plate with
four RBI in an 8-6 slugfest vic
tory over the Beavers.
With the bases loaded and
her team trailing 3-1 in the top
of the fourth inning, Rich rock
eted a bases-clearing double
into the gap in left-center field

to give the Card a 4-3 lead.
Rich added a single in the sixth
inning and subsequently gave
Stanford some needed breath
ing room in the seventh with
an RBI single down the left
field line, scoring Leah White
and producing the final score
line.
The two-time NFCA All
West Region First Team selec
tion now has 30 RBI on the
season, eight clear of Stan
ford's next highest total. Rich
also leads the team with four
home runs she is poised to
leave the Farm as one of the
greatest power hitters in Stan
ford softball history, having led
the Cardinal in those two cate
gories in all four years of her
career.

so had a fantastic series for the

.600 and plated two runs in
three games. White's best
performance came in the first
game on Tuesday, when the
Pac-12 second-team selection
went 3-for-4 with an RBI.
White's single up the middle
in the top of the fourth inning
gave the Cardinal a 5-0 lead;
Stanford would add two more
runs in the seventh to finish
off the 7-0 rout of the
Beavers.
White has been absolutely
on fire over the last month of
the season, batting .440 since
March 1 while driving in sev
en runs and drawing nine

walks. White's sheer ability
to get on base and her fabu
lous speed have provided the
heart of the Cardinal lineup
with great opportunities to
drive in runs, thus spurring
the team's offense.
Stanford will next face
one of its toughest tests all
season on Saturday and Sun
day, as No. 2 Arizona State
(34-3, 5-1 Pac-12) travels to
the Farm for a three-game
series. The Cardinal will have
an invaluable opportunity at
home against a national
championship contender to
reaffirm its position among
the elite programs in the
country. The Sun Devils have
no glaring offensive weak
ness, as Arizona State leads
the Pac-12 in batting average,
runs and home runs.

The Sun Devils' offensive
output is paced by senior
Sam Parlich. A senior who
ranks in the top 20 in home
runs and RBl's in ASU soft
ball team history, Parlich is
hitting .381 with eight
homers and 30 RBI. Arizona
State also has solid pitching,
ranking third in the Pac-12 in
team ERA with a 1.61 mark.
All in all, Stanford will have
its hands full with the formi
dable Sun Devils.
Stanford and Arizona
State will face off in a double
header on Saturday begin

ternoon at noon. Saturday's
games can also be seen on the
Pac-12 Networks.

With the bases loaded and
her team trailing 3-1 in the top
of the fourth inning, Rich rock
eted a bases-clearing double
into the gap in left-center field

to give the Card a 4-3 lead.
Rich added a single in the sixth
inning and subsequently gave
Stanford some needed breath
ing room in the seventh with
an RBI single down the left
field line, scoring Leah White
and producing the final score
line.
The two-time NFCA All
West Region First Team selec
tion now has 30 RBI on the
season, eight clear of Stan
ford's next highest total. Rich
also leads the team with four
home runs she is poised to
leave the Farm as one of the
greatest power hitters in Stan
ford softball history, having led
the Cardinal in those two cate

.600 and plated two runs in
three games. White's best
performance came in the first
game on Tuesday, when the
Pac-12 second-team selection
went 3-for-4 with an RBI.
White's single up the middle
in the top of the fourth inning
gave the Cardinal a 5-0 lead;
Stanford would add two more
runs in the seventh to finish
off the 7-0 rout of the
Beavers.
White has been absolutely
on fire over the last month of
the season, batting .440 since
March 1 while driving in sev
en runs and drawing nine

walks. White's sheer ability
to get on base and her fabu
lous speed have provided the
heart of the Cardinal lineup
with great opportunities to
drive in runs, thus spurring
the team's offense.
Stanford will next face
one of its toughest tests all
season on Saturday and Sun
day, as No. 2 Arizona State
(34-3, 5-1 Pac-12) travels to
the Farm for a three-game
series. The Cardinal will have
an invaluable opportunity at
home against a national
championship contender to
reaffirm its position among
the elite programs in the
country. The Sun Devils have
no glaring offensive weak
ness, as Arizona State leads
the Pac-12 in batting average,
runs and home runs.

The Sun Devils' offensive
output is paced by senior
Sam Parlich. A senior who
ranks in the top 20 in home
runs and RBl's in ASU soft
ball team history, Parlich is
hitting .381 with eight
homers and 30 RBI. Arizona
State also has solid pitching,
ranking third in the Pac-12 in
team ERA with a 1.61 mark.
All in all, Stanford will have
its hands full with the formi
dable Sun Devils.
Stanford and Arizona
State will face off in a double
header on Saturday begin
ning at 2 p.m. and Sunday af
ternoon at noon. Saturday's
games can also be seen on the
Pac-12 Networks.
