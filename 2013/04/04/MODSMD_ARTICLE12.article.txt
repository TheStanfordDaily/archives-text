# BEAVERS BESTED
## 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford traveled to Cor
vallis, Ore,, seeking a road se
ries win against a quality oppo
nent in order to further bolster
its bid for a top seed in the
NCAA Tournament. Consider
that mission accomplished. In a
three-game set that played out
over the course of two days,
No. 14 Stanford won two of
three against No. 14 Oregon
State (24-11,1-5 Pac-12) to im
prove to 26-10 on the season
and 4-5 in Pac-12 play.
Prior to this series, pitching
and fielding figured to be areas
of weakness for the Beavers.
Right on cue, the Cardinal
masterfully exploited these de
ficiencies, tallying 15 runs and
forcing four errors in a double
header sweep on Tuesday af
ternoon. Although the Card
fell 4-3 in Wednesday after

noon's finale, Stanford still av
eraged six runs per game and
hit .295 against the Beavers.

Senior Jenna Rich had a se
ries to remember, as the El Se
gundo, Calif., product hit .545
and drove in five runs during
the three-game set. Rich's
defining moment this week
came in the second game of
Tuesday's doubleheader. The
third-team Ail-American and
Pac-12 first-team selection
went 3-for-4 at the plate with
four RBI in an 8-6 slugfest vic
tory over the Beavers.
With the bases loaded and
her team trailing 3-1 in the top
of the fourth inning, Rich rock
eted a bases-clearing double
into the gap in left-center field

to give the Card a 4-3 lead.
Rich added a single in the sixth
inning and subsequently gave
Stanford some needed breath
ing room in the seventh with
an RBI single down the left
field line, scoring Leah White
and producing the final score
line.
The two-time NFCA All
West Region First Team selec
tion now has 30 RBI on the
season, eight clear of Stan
ford's next highest total. Rich
also leads the team with four
home runs she is poised to
leave the Farm as one of the
greatest power hitters in Stan
ford softball history, having led
the Cardinal in those two cate
gories in all four years of her
career.
Sophomore Leah White al
so had a fantastic series for the
Card, as the Phoenix native hit
