## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY Constant Connectivity and the Human Condition 
### Adam Johnson 
I was working on a group project
late last quarter when I re
ceived a harsh email from one
of my partners. After discussing
what parts of the report she was
working on, she wrote, "you have
been ignoring my calls and texts
which is unacceptable." She was
half right. Apparently the others in
the group had been texting each
other back and forth, as well as at
tempting to call me, for the five
hours prior to me receiving that
email. I, however, was not deliber
ately ignoring her; not expecting
any urgent calls that night, I left
my phone in my dorm room before
leaving to study in the basement of
Green.
The assumption behind her
comment was that I was checking
my phone regularly. And for college
students in the heart of Silicon Val
ley, that is hardly an unreasonable
assumption to make: breaks in
class are filled with people pulling
out their phones to check emails,
lulls in conversations are replaced
with responding to texts, buzzes
and bright screens always and
everywhere.
I reckon that six years ago
maybe even three a text or
phone call that went unanswered
for a handful of hours would not
have warranted the response I re
ceived. Times, of course, have
changed, although I'm not sure for
the better. Not only do we own
more devices, but we engage with
them far more often. Have our con
versations and classes gotten less
interesting? Doubtful. Rather, we
are more reliant than ever on our
digital devices and less tactful with
when we use them.
The individual, however, should
not shoulder all the blame; the sys
tem he operates in is also partly re
sponsible. For instance, while per
haps once owning a smartphone
was a legitimate option, possessing
what was once a luxury device will
soon be a necessity. Airports and
museums are replacing textual
signs with QR codes, valuable ap
plications are being developed only
for smartphones, and many of
those who are constantly connected
to their devices operate under the
assumption that everyone else is,
or should be, similarly engaged
with their technologies. Thus novel
technologies, while they may begin
as optional products, do not remain
optional. So although Google Glass,
the wearable computer, might now
be a prototype and in a few years
will be a product only the wealthy
can afford, it or a close derivative
will soon enter the mainstream.
And soon after that, major facets of
our lives will be designed around
the technology.
Are humans ready for Google
Glass? If they are, will they be
ready for the next wave of comput
er technology? Were they even
ready for smartphones, or the in
ternet? Even if the Silicon Valley
elite are willing to profoundly
change the human condition, the
rest of the world may not be; the
values revered here efficiency,
scalability, and profitability are
not as important, or are even

looked down upon, in other commu
nities and cultures. But due to the
penetration of technology dis
cussed earlier, those who do not
necessarily share the same values
as the tech elite are all but forced to
adopt the newest products and
services and ways of life.
Humans were not "designed" un
der conditions of near-constant con
nectivity; the vast majority of our
evolution occurred in the pre-indus
trial era. Expect resistance, then,
from our bodies. Expect depression,
rebellion, alienation. Expect drugs
and entertainment to be front and
center in an attempt to "cure" us of
these ills. This used to be the realm
of science fiction think soma in
"Brave New World" or mood organs
in "Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep" but now we need only look
at the increasing number of youth
who are diagnosed with ADHD and
then prescribed drugs to "fix" their
"disorder" to see evidence of grow
ing psychological distress and a
corresponding over-reliance on
medication.
For these reasons, I am wary of
the Code.org video, "What Most
Schools Don't Teach," that has re
cently been in the news. The video
is a celebrity-stacked PSA explain
ing why today's youth should learn
computer programming. Two of the
final speakers in the video have
these concluding words to say: "the
programmers of tomorrow are the
wizards of the future" and "[coding]
is the closest thing we have to a su
perpower."
They might as well have labeled
themselves gods. And for all intents
and purposes, these and other pro
grammers and engineers are play
ing the role of God, designing prod
ucts that aim to provide humans
with longer, more efficient and os
tensibly happier lives. Being God,
though, comes with supreme re
sponsibility. Those who used to be
at the forefront of a given technolo
gy the atomic bomb scientists or
early internet developers, for in
stance were relatively philo
sophical when reflecting on their
technologies. Yet for the program
mers portrayed in the video, with
their unbridled enthusiasm and col
orful offices filled with drum sets
and ping pong tables, humanism
appears to be of minimal concern.

tempting to call me, for the five
hours prior to me receiving that
email. I, however, was not deliber
ately ignoring her; not expecting
any urgent calls that night, I left
my phone in my dorm room before
leaving to study in the basement of
Green.
The assumption behind her
comment was that I was checking
my phone regularly. And for college
students in the heart of Silicon Val
ley, that is hardly an unreasonable
assumption to make: breaks in
class are filled with people pulling
out their phones to check emails,
lulls in conversations are replaced
with responding to texts, buzzes
and bright screens always and
everywhere.
I reckon that six years ago
maybe even three a text or
phone call that went unanswered
for a handful of hours would not
have warranted the response I re
ceived. Times, of course, have
changed, although I'm not sure for
the better. Not only do we own
more devices, but we engage with
them far more often. Have our con
versations and classes gotten less
interesting? Doubtful. Rather, we
are more reliant than ever on our
digital devices and less tactful with
when we use them.
The individual, however, should
not shoulder all the blame; the sys
tem he operates in is also partly re
sponsible. For instance, while per
haps once owning a smartphone
was a legitimate option, possessing
what was once a luxury device will
soon be a necessity. Airports and
museums are replacing textual
signs with QR codes, valuable ap
plications are being developed only
for smartphones, and many of
those who are constantly connected
to their devices operate under the
assumption that everyone else is,
or should be, similarly engaged
with their technologies. Thus novel
technologies, while they may begin
as optional products, do not remain
optional. So although Google Glass,
the wearable computer, might now
be a prototype and in a few years
will be a product only the wealthy
can afford, it or a close derivative
will soon enter the mainstream.
And soon after that, major facets of
our lives will be designed around
the technology.
Are humans ready for Google
Glass? If they are, will they be
ready for the next wave of comput
er technology? Were they even
ready for smartphones, or the in
ternet? Even if the Silicon Valley
elite are willing to profoundly
change the human condition, the
rest of the world may not be; the
values revered here efficiency,
scalability, and profitability are
not as important, or are even

looked down upon, in other commu
nities and cultures. But due to the
penetration of technology dis
cussed earlier, those who do not
necessarily share the same values
as the tech elite are all but forced to
adopt the newest products and
services and ways of life.
Humans were not "designed" un
der conditions of near-constant con
nectivity; the vast majority of our
evolution occurred in the pre-indus
trial era. Expect resistance, then,
from our bodies. Expect depression,
rebellion, alienation. Expect drugs
and entertainment to be front and
center in an attempt to "cure" us of
these ills. This used to be the realm
of science fiction think soma in
"Brave New World" or mood organs
in "Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep" but now we need only look
at the increasing number of youth
who are diagnosed with ADHD and
then prescribed drugs to "fix" their
"disorder" to see evidence of grow
ing psychological distress and a
corresponding over-reliance on
medication.
For these reasons, I am wary of
the Code.org video, "What Most
Schools Don't Teach," that has re
cently been in the news. The video
is a celebrity-stacked PSA explain
ing why today's youth should learn
computer programming. Two of the
final speakers in the video have
these concluding words to say: "the
programmers of tomorrow are the
wizards of the future" and "[coding]
is the closest thing we have to a su
perpower."
They might as well have labeled
themselves gods. And for all intents
and purposes, these and other pro
grammers and engineers are play
ing the role of God, designing prod
ucts that aim to provide humans
with longer, more efficient and os
tensibly happier lives. Being God,
though, comes with supreme re
sponsibility. Those who used to be
at the forefront of a given technolo
gy the atomic bomb scientists or
early internet developers, for in
stance were relatively philo
sophical when reflecting on their
technologies. Yet for the program
mers portrayed in the video, with
their unbridled enthusiasm and col
orful offices filled with drum sets
and ping pong tables, humanism
appears to be of minimal concern.
