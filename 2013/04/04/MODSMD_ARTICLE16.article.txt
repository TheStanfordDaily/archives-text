# Gymnasts flip into NCAA regionals
## 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
The women's gymnastics
team has not competed since
its fourth place finish at the
Pac-12 Championships on
March 23, which marked the
13th year in a row that Stan
ford finished fourth or better
at the conference champi
onships. At the meet, the
Cardinal faced an early
deficit but finished strong
due to a couple of standout
individual performances.
Stanford looked to its
proven stars to help the team
salvage a poor start. Three
Cardinal gymnasts received
Pac-12 first-team honors:
senior Ashley Morgan (all
around), junior Amanda
Spinner (beam) and sopho
more Ivana Hong (beam).
Spinner showed why she
also won the Pac-12 Special
ist of the Year for her consis
tent performance throughout
the season on beam, as she
scored a 9.925 to earn a co-ti
tle in the event. Similarly,
Morgan proved once again to
be one of the conference's
best floor performers, earn
ing a share of the individual
title with a 9.950 in the event,
a career best. Hong also
shone, scoring an all-around
score of 39.575, the highest
all-around score for any
Stanford gymnast this year
and fewer than 0.200 points
behind an individual title.
Despite certain notable
individual performances,
Stanford as a team wasn't at
its best in its last competition
but earned a respectable
196.625 team score. It will
likely need to compete at a
higher level if the team hopes
to advance to the NCAA
Championships for the fifth
time in six years.
In order to make it to the
final rounds in Los Angeles,
the Cardinal will have to
place in the top two at Satur
day's NCAA Norman Re
gional. Stanford earned the
No. 2 seed going into the
competition, but that doesn't
mean the team can relax for
Saturday's meet.
The Cardinal, the No. 11
team in the nation, is one of
just four teams ranked in the
top 25 at the Regional. No. 2
Oklahoma, No. 14 Penn State
and No. 22 Washington will
likely be Stanford's stiffest
competition this weekend,
while lowa and Southern
Utah also have a chance to
stand between Stanford and
a championship berth. Okla
homa is expected to give
Stanford the most difficulty,
as it is a team with proven
talent that has spent most of
the year as one of the nation's

top teams and beat the Car
dinal in a March 10 tri-meet
with North Carolina.
One thing Stanford has
going for it is plenty of expe
rience in important postsea
son meets. Last year, the
Cardinal earned a trip to the
National Championships by
finishing second in the six
team regional field, just
ahead of host Illinois, and ul
timately placed fourth with a
very impressive meet in the
championships.
Morgan expects the Car
dinal's experience to pay div
idends when the team is un
der pressure on Saturday.
"I think it is very helpful
that a majority of our team
had this experience last year,
especially in helping to pre
pare the younger girls," she
said.
The team hopes for a sim-

ilar outcome this year, as
there is no turning back if the
team fails to place in the top
two. The team missed out on
the Championships two sea
sons ago by finishing fourth
in the regional competition,
and the members of that
team will be the first to tell
you that is not how the team
wants to end a season.
"Missing out [on the
NCAA Championships] is
what lit a fire for the last two
years and allowed us to push
harder and work harder than
we ever have before," Mor
gan said.
If Stanford does indeed
move on to the next round, it
will join five other teams in
the National Championships
from April 19-21.
