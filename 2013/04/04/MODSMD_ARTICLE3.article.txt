## Concerns arise over VSO selectivity 
### CLARISSE PERALTA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As students will head to the
polls next week to vote on special
fees for some of Stanford's Volun
teer Student Organizations
(VSOs), concern has been raised
that some VSOs all of which
are supposed to be broadly acces
sible to students have become
too selective.
Nanci Howe, associate dean
and director of student activities
and leadership (SAL), said that
while some selective procedures
are acceptable, others violate the
mission of VSOs to be broadly
open.
"The criteria for selecting
members should be objective and
is critical to the operation of the
group," Howe said. "For example,
a cappella groups have auditions
and everyone has the opportunity
to audition. As long as those audi
tions are open to everyone and

there is a fair and non-discrimina
tory process for choosing who can
participate and be selected, then
we would consider that within the
guidelines of objective criteria."
Elise Timtim 'l3, chair of the
VSO Stanford in Government
(SIG), said selectivity is some
times necessary to whittle down
demand.
"It has to be [selective] in a
structural sense. The organization
has been the same for a long time
and is organized into different
committees," she said. "There is a
huge demand, which we're still
trying to accommodate."
Stanford in Government (SIG)
is a VSO that uses special fees
funding that will be voted on by
the student body next week to
fund its activities, such as funding
summer fellowships and stipends.
SIG only accepts members at the
beginning of the year through an
application-based process, which
Timtim says is "pretty competi

tive."
"This year, we received more
than twice the number of appli
cants we could take which is un
fortunate, because the whole point
of the group is to get students in
volved in policy," she said.
Last year, undergraduates vot
ed overwhelmingly almost 80
percent in favor to fund SIG.
Other YSOs such as the Stan
ford Pre-Business Association
(SPBA) and the Stanford Federal
ist Society rely on general fees,
which are approved by the Under
graduate Senate and because
they request less than $6,000
not subject to approval from the
student body.
According to Feyi Lawoyin 'l3,
SPBA president, the level of
group selectivity varies depending
on whether members want to take
on leadership roles.
"All it takes to be a member is
to be part of the mailing list, and
anyone can attend our events," she
said. "We only have applications for
those who want to become a core
member. Currently, we have 15 core
members."
SPBA also recruits for associ
ates in the fall, accepting "a dozen
or so freshmen and sophomores."
According to Lawoyin, the applica
tion serves as a mechanism to iden
tify students who would take the
club seriously.
"The application process is just
to deter from anyone who wants to
sign up and not do anything neces
sarily," she said. "Some students
join student groups and are not ac
tive because they're not getting
paid, for example."
Stanford Consulting a VSO
that does not use either special or
general fees from the University
has had to turn away up to 90 per
cent of interested students.
"We've had to talk about how we
choose members," said Tim Shi 'l3,
Stanford Consulting's chief execu
tive officer. "We're open to the
Stanford community, but there are
limited spots because there are on

ly so many cases. We have to stay
small."
Stanford Consulting recruits
new members every fall and con
ducts two rounds of interviews in
addition to applications, accepting
only a fraction of the students that
apply.
"We typically receive 150 to 200
applications a year. We take a class
of about 20 new consultants and put
them through rigorous interviews
that mimic the consulting process,"
Shi said. "We want students who
are strong problem solvers, think
quickly on their feet, are articulate
and come across as really smart,
which is what consulting firms also
look for."
However, most VSOs on campus
solicit members through an open
casting call.
"They just have to get on our
mailing list and show up to our
events. There is no application but
students are self-selecting," said
Ilan Wurman J.D. 'l3, co-president
of the Stanford Federalist Society.
All VSOs need to meet SAEs cri
teria for approval and draft a con
stitution to be reviewed, approved
and filed by the University. If SAL
believes a certain VSO is becoming
too selective, these founding docu
ments may be referenced in meet
ings with administrators.
"What we do is we work with

those groups, sit down and look at
their constitution and go back to
their philosophy, which we think is a
very important part of Stanford
and Stanford student life," Howe
said.
While she said she "cannot an
swer" as to which specify which
groups SAL has worked with to dis
cuss selectivity guidelines, Howe
did cite a particular instance in
which SAL worked with a student
group to remind them of their goals
as a VSO.
"The one thing I should say is
that [SAL Associate Director] Sne
hal Naik has met with [Stanford
Consulting] and has talked to them
about rethinking the mission of the
group because it seemed that there
were issues in making clear it is a
student organization for a learning
experience, not for making money,"
she said. "So he just actually talked
to them [in March.]"
Howe emphasized that most
VSOs receive guidance from SAL
on many governance items.
"We work with groups on mem
bership issues and other issues like
this periodically because groups
transition every year," she said.
"Not just about membership but a
slew of other things."
