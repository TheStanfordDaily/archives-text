## Concerns arise over VSO selectivity 
### CLARISSE PERALTA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As students will head to the
polls next week to vote on special
fees for some of Stanford's Volun
teer Student Organizations
(VSOs), concern has been raised
that some VSOs all of which
are supposed to be broadly acces
sible to students have become
too selective.
Nanci Howe, associate dean
and director of student activities
and leadership (SAL), said that
while some selective procedures
are acceptable, others violate the
mission of VSOs to be broadly
open.
"The criteria for selecting
members should be objective and
is critical to the operation of the
group," Howe said. "For example,
a cappella groups have auditions
and everyone has the opportunity
to audition. As long as those audi
tions are open to everyone and

there is a fair and non-discrimina
tory process for choosing who can
participate and be selected, then
we would consider that within the
guidelines of objective criteria."
Elise Timtim 'l3, chair of the
VSO Stanford in Government
(SIG), said selectivity is some
times necessary to whittle down
demand.
"It has to be [selective] in a
structural sense. The organization
has been the same for a long time
and is organized into different
committees," she said. "There is a
huge demand, which we're still
trying to accommodate."
Stanford in Government (SIG)
is a VSO that uses special fees
funding that will be voted on by
the student body next week to
fund its activities, such as funding
summer fellowships and stipends.
SIG only accepts members at the
beginning of the year through an
application-based process, which
Timtim says is "pretty competi

tive."
"This year, we received more
than twice the number of appli
cants we could take which is un
fortunate, because the whole point
of the group is to get students in
volved in policy," she said.
Last year, undergraduates vot
ed overwhelmingly almost 80
percent in favor to fund SIG.
Other YSOs such as the Stan
ford Pre-Business Association
(SPBA) and the Stanford Federal
ist Society rely on general fees,
which are approved by the Under
graduate Senate and because
they request less than $6,000
not subject to approval from the
student body.
According to Feyi Lawoyin 'l3,
SPBA president, the level of
group selectivity varies depending
on whether members want to take
on leadership roles.
"All it takes to be a member is
