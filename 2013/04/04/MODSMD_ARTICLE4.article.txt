# Committees offer students a voice
## Influence varies significantly across issues 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This article is the first in a
two-part series looking at Uni
versity committees and stu
dents'role therein, Today's arti
cle looks at committees'role and
structure, while tomorrow's ar
ticle looks at the committees'
limitations to date.
A day after students gathered in
the middle of White Plaza in late
February to protest the University's
decision to end student management
at Suites Eating Clubs, Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Greg Boardman
sat down with The Daily to talk
about the controversy and the article
written by Miles Untereinner 'l2
M.A. 'l3, a Daily staffer credited
with sparking the movement.
In the interview, Boardman
called the moment a "tipping point,"
noting that the article forced admin
istrators to ask the question: how are
student voices being heard, and
should this change moving forward?
"We have student representa
tions on literally every University
committee is that not effective?"
Boardman asked. "Are there other
ways of engaging students in a dif
ferent way, so they will have a say or
input in some of the University deci
sions, which perhaps aren't being
utilized today?"
"I think this opens up an opportu
nity to really think," he added. "How
do we better ascertain what the stu
dent concerns are before decisions
are made?"
According to a Faculty Senate re
port, the University's system of com
mittees provides "the best place for
effective student participation in the
governance of the University." While
students can serve on more than 40
committees in total, dealing with is
sues as varied as investment respon
sibility and laboratory animal care,
their influence is often inconsistent

and incomplete.
Hearing the student voice
All of the students interviewed
for this article affirmed that serving
on University committees has given
them, to varying degrees, power to
influence the direction of Stanford's
academic and administrative poli
cies. Jonathan York 'l3, who this
year will serve as a chair of the Nom
inations Commission (NomCom), ar
gued that these committees can
serve as an effective forum for com
munication between students and
administrators, as well as playing an
important role in the actual policy
setting process.
"This is probably the most direct
and effective way to affect the Stan
ford community and to affect Stan
ford life," he said. "It's more effec
tive than any protest, than any peti
tion, than any ASSU bill this is
the way to affect change at Stan
ford."
York has served on three differ
ent committees during his time at
Stanford. He became a member of
the Judicial Board Panel pool his
freshman year and since then has al
so served as the chair of the Board
on Judicial Affairs and as an under
graduate representative on the
Board of Trustees' Committee on
Land and Buildings.
In the latter position, York said
that he has often seen his feedback
on what students might like to see
incorporated into construction
projects, such as the recent $13.15
million plan to renovate Florence
Moore Hall. Even so, the renovation
has upset some students by the pro
posed removal of catwalks from the
residential buildings, on health and
safety grounds.
York also mentioned the renova
tion of the Crown Quadrangle and
Library, the third and final stage of
