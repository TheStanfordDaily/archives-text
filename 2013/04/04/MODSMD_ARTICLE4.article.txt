# Committees offer students a voice
## Influence varies significantly across issues 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This article is the first in a
two-part series looking at Uni
versity committees and stu
dents'role therein, Today's arti
cle looks at committees'role and
structure, while tomorrow's ar
ticle looks at the committees'
limitations to date.
A day after students gathered in
the middle of White Plaza in late
February to protest the University's
decision to end student management
at Suites Eating Clubs, Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Greg Boardman
sat down with The Daily to talk
about the controversy and the article
written by Miles Untereinner 'l2
M.A. 'l3, a Daily staffer credited
with sparking the movement.
In the interview, Boardman
called the moment a "tipping point,"
noting that the article forced admin
istrators to ask the question: how are
student voices being heard, and
should this change moving forward?
"We have student representa
tions on literally every University
committee is that not effective?"
Boardman asked. "Are there other
ways of engaging students in a dif
ferent way, so they will have a say or
input in some of the University deci
sions, which perhaps aren't being
utilized today?"
"I think this opens up an opportu
nity to really think," he added. "How
do we better ascertain what the stu
dent concerns are before decisions
are made?"
According to a Faculty Senate re
port, the University's system of com
mittees provides "the best place for
effective student participation in the
governance of the University." While
students can serve on more than 40
committees in total, dealing with is
sues as varied as investment respon
sibility and laboratory animal care,
their influence is often inconsistent

and incomplete.
Hearing the student voice
All of the students interviewed
for this article affirmed that serving
on University committees has given
them, to varying degrees, power to
influence the direction of Stanford's
academic and administrative poli
cies. Jonathan York 'l3, who this
year will serve as a chair of the Nom
inations Commission (NomCom), ar
gued that these committees can
serve as an effective forum for com
munication between students and
administrators, as well as playing an
important role in the actual policy
setting process.
"This is probably the most direct
and effective way to affect the Stan
ford community and to affect Stan
ford life," he said. "It's more effec
tive than any protest, than any peti
tion, than any ASSU bill this is
the way to affect change at Stan
ford."
York has served on three differ
ent committees during his time at
Stanford. He became a member of
the Judicial Board Panel pool his
freshman year and since then has al
so served as the chair of the Board
on Judicial Affairs and as an under
graduate representative on the
Board of Trustees' Committee on
Land and Buildings.
In the latter position, York said
that he has often seen his feedback
on what students might like to see
incorporated into construction
projects, such as the recent $13.15
million plan to renovate Florence
Moore Hall. Even so, the renovation
has upset some students by the pro
posed removal of catwalks from the
residential buildings, on health and
safety grounds.
York also mentioned the renova
tion of the Crown Quadrangle and
Library, the third and final stage of
the Stanford Law School overhaul,
which will cost $22 million and ten
tatively be finished by the spring of
2014.
"One of the concerns that the
graduate student on the committee
and I voiced together was how is
this construction is going to affect
students because it's close to a lot
of study spaces, and we were able
to say that," York said. "We were
able to ask the administrators in
charge of that project to be mind
ful of the times of certain parts of
the construction and how they
could mitigate the impact on stu
dents."
"You know, these are not big bu
reaucratic committees," he added.
"From my experience, these are
really practical and functional or
ganizations, and to have student
voices on them makes them that
much better."
Brianna Pang 'l3, who is a
member of both the Advisory Pan
el for Investment Responsibility
and Licensing (APIRL) and the
Special Committee on Globaliza
tion this year, echoed many of
York's sentiments.
However, while Pang also be
lieves the committee system is a
fundamentally sound institution,
she said that students are often not
prepared to make the greatest im
pact possible when they are first

appointed to these positions. As a
result, committee members are not
always able to advocate effectively
for student interests, especially
when they stand in opposition with
the viewpoints of administrators.
"I feel that Stanford students
have a lot more say, and their voic
es mean a lot more to administra
tors than at other schools, so I do
commend Stanford administrators
for creating these avenues for stu
dent voice," Pang said. "But
throughout my time on these com
mittees, I'd have to say I think it's
hard to make a change or have a
really strong voice in my first year
because there is a learning curve
for every committee."
"I think that students have to
learn A) what the campus vibe is
on an issue and B) how to project
that to administrators well and in
an effective way," she added.
There are several aspects of the
system that may prevent the stu
dents from meeting these two ob
jectives and representing their
peers effectively, according to cur
rent committee members inter
viewed. These include the applica
tion process, which in previous
years has struggled to produce
nominations in time for training
before the end of the school year,
as well as a lack of communication
between representatives and the
student body after appointments
are made.
There is also the concern that
several areas of campus life es
pecially Residential Education
do not have formal standing com

mittees, which could result in stu
dents being disconnected from
some of the policy decisions that go
on to affect them directly.
Structure of the committee system
In September 1969, the Faculty
Senate adopted the "Report on the
Committee Structure of the Uni
versity." This document continues,
for the most part, to guide the re
sponsibilities and operations of the
committees at Stanford today.
According to the report, univer
sity committees are to "operate as
policy-making and review bodies,"
while leaving the "administration
of these policies generally in the
hands of the appropriate adminis
trative officers." The standing
committees of the Academic Coun
cil, for instance, are charged with
formulating policies on all matters
related to teaching and research at
the University. It is not until the
Faculty Senate approves these
policies, however, that they actual
ly go into effect.
Currently, there are more than
40 different university committees,
dealing with issues as varied as in
vestment responsibility, under
graduate housing, laboratory ani
mal care and KZSU. In addition to
the Academic Council committees,
which report to the Faculty Senate,
the other committees most com
monly fall under the purview of the
University President, the Board of
Trustees or the Vice Provost of
Student Affairs.
These committees typically in
clude nine voting members, with

two or three of these spots being
reserved for students. The report
states, however, that "the more di
rectly concerned committees are
with student affairs, the larger
might appropriately be the num
ber of students involved."
The Alcohol Advisory Board
Committee, for instance, is focused
on policies regarding student alco
hol use. Because of its student-spe
cific mission, this committee cur
rently includes positions for five
undergraduate and two graduate
students, well above the norm for
student representation. The Un
dergraduate Housing Advisory
Committee similarly includes 10
student representatives.
The report further notes the
importance of having students
serve on these committees.
"We believe that the best place
for effective student participation
in the governance of the Universi
ty is through active, voting mem
bership on important committees,
where the basic work will neces
sarily be done in most cases," the
report reads. "Working student
members on all Academic Council
and University standing commit
tees, except those where students
would clearly be inappropriate,
provide the most promising mech
anism for responsible and effective
student participation."
Students serve as "uninstruct
ed members" of committees, ac
cording to the "Procedures for
University Committees, Presiden
tial Commissions," which was
drafted by Gerhard Casper during

his time as University President.
This means that they are "free to
use their judgment on issues" and
are not required to serve as dele
gates for their peers.
While final appointments of
these committee members rests
with the body or individual they
would report to, students have the
ability to nominate peers to repre
sent them though the ASSU.
These nominations are then rarely,
if ever, rejected. In his 13 years
serving as University president,
John Hennessy has never turned
down the name of a student nomi
nated to serve on one of his presi
dential committees, according to
Jeff Wachtel, special assistant to
the president.
The Board of Trustees does,
however, request to receive more
student nominations than there
are positions on their committees,
giving trustees the opportunity to
interview potential candidates and
make a final selection for them
selves.
"They have their own process,
and they don't want to be told that
you have to appoint so-and-so,"
Wachtel said. "That's been their
practice and unwritten policy to
have a more competitive process."
Members of NomCom are re
sponsible for interviewing candi
dates and putting forth this initial
list of student nominees for the
ASSU. The Undergraduate Senate
and Graduate Student Council con
firmed the seven students who will
serve on NomCom at their meet
ings in late February. Of these
members, York and John Dodini 'l3
have been selected to serve as the
commission's two co-chairs.
The new NomCom members
took office at the beginning of
spring quarter, completing their
one-year term at the end of winter
quarter next year, and will receive
stipends for their work on the com
mission according to ASSU budg
ets.
During the 2012-13 academic
year, the NomCom chair received
$1,627 and the deputy chair $1,405,
the other five NomCom members
splitting $4,436 worth of stipends.
NomCom also received nearly
$l,OOO for recruiting expenses,
$5OO for food for students at com
mittee meetings and $5,175.85 in
discretionary spending.
NomCom put forth its first
email soliciting applications for
committee positions in mid-March,
with an initial deadline of April 2.
That date was extended this week to
Friday, April 5 to give students more
time to apply, according to an email
sent out to the student body by AS
SU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
M.A. 'l3, who serves as an ex-officio
member of the commission.
