## Black, Elam address scheduling changes 
### NEEL THAKKAR DESK EDITOR 
As the Faculty Senate ap
proaches a vote next month on
a controversial class schedul
ing proposal, University Regis
trar Tom Black and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam fielded
questions and concerns from
about 10 students during a
town hall-style meeting
Wednesday evening.
Though the meeting,
arranged by the ASSU Execu
tive at the request of Black and
Elam, was intended to be a fo
rum for students to have their
concerns heard directly, the
duo also revealed a major up
date to the proposed changes,

which if approved by the
Faculty Senate would now
go into effect in the 2014-15 ac
ademic year.
Instead of banning the
practice of double-booking
classes outright, the proposed
changes would now require a
petitioning process to double
book classes, according to
Elam and Black. Though the
details of that petitioning
process were still unclear, both
administrators made it clear
that certain types of conflicts,
such as those in which one
class is filmed, would be al
lowed.
"I got letters from students
wanting to take two classes at
the same time," Elam ex
plained, adding that student

feedback influenced his opinion
in this respect.
Discussion at the meeting
focused on a small number of
issues. These included the ef
fects on athletes' practice
schedules of holding large, re

quired lecture classes at 8:30
a.m., the need or lack there
of of a petitioning process to
double-book classes and a bet
ter ways for students to voice
