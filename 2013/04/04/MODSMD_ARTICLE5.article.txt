## Black, Elam address scheduling changes 
### NEEL THAKKAR DESK EDITOR 
As the Faculty Senate ap
proaches a vote next month on
a controversial class schedul
ing proposal, University Regis
trar Tom Black and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam fielded
questions and concerns from
about 10 students during a
town hall-style meeting
Wednesday evening.
Though the meeting,
arranged by the ASSU Execu
tive at the request of Black and
Elam, was intended to be a fo
rum for students to have their
concerns heard directly, the
duo also revealed a major up
date to the proposed changes,

which if approved by the
Faculty Senate would now
go into effect in the 2014-15 ac
ademic year.
Instead of banning the
practice of double-booking
classes outright, the proposed
changes would now require a
petitioning process to double
book classes, according to
Elam and Black. Though the
details of that petitioning
process were still unclear, both
administrators made it clear
that certain types of conflicts,
such as those in which one
class is filmed, would be al
lowed.
"I got letters from students
wanting to take two classes at
the same time," Elam ex
plained, adding that student

feedback influenced his opinion
in this respect.
Discussion at the meeting
focused on a small number of
issues. These included the ef
fects on athletes' practice
schedules of holding large, re

quired lecture classes at 8:30
a.m., the need or lack there
of of a petitioning process to
double-book classes and a bet
ter ways for students to voice

their opinions to University and
departmental administrators.
Ben Holston 'l5, a swimmer, ex
pressed his concern that mandato
ry lectures such as core physics,
chemistry or human biology class
es — might move to an 8:30 a.m.
start time, forcing sports teams
that practice during the mornings
to start even earlier. Currently,
these lectures begin at 9 a.m. at the
earliest.
"We don't want to wake up be
fore 5 to get to weights at 5:30,"
Holston said, adding that getting
enough sleep was already a chal
lenge for athletes.
"My response is that I don't
control that," Black said. He ex
plained that individual depart
ments, to which he and Elam could
only make recommendations, con
trol the scheduling of particular
classes.
Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6, who be
gan a popular petition opposing the
proposed changes last month,
questioned the need for a petition
ing process in order to double-book
classes. He argued that there was
"no pressing need to flip the bal
ance of power to the faculty to de
cide when a student can or can't

take the classes," arguing that stu
dents are capable of deciding for
themselves.
Although the details of the po
tential petitioning process have not
been agreed upon the question
of whether they will be handled by
individual faculty members or by
Undergraduate Advising and Re
search is open, for example. Elam
stressed the importance of advis
ing before making potentially cru
cial academic decisions like double
booking classes.
Of the students he sees having
serious academic difficulties, "so
many of them were because of dou
ble-booking," Elam said.
Another student asked whether
students had any avenues to ex
press their concerns.
"There isn't a system to do that
right now," Elam said.
Black echoed the sentiment,
saying that the idea was a "good
recommendation."
Closing the meeting, Elam en
couraged student input during the
Faculty Senate discussion of the
changes, which will take place on
May 2. Though students who wish
to attend must obtain an invitation,
Elam said their voices would be a
significant part of the debate.
"There's space for student voic
es to speak," he said.
