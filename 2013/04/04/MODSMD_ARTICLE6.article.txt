## Palo Alto votes to offer carbon-free electricity 
### KATIE KRAMON 
Palo Alto joined a select group of envi
ronmentally friendly cities last month by
becoming completely "carbon neutral,"
providing 100 percent of all electricity from
carbon-free sources. The Palo Alto City
Council unanimously ratified the city's car
bon-free electric portfolio on March 4.
"Palo Alto has always had a strong com
mitment to environmental sustainability
and, by going carbon-free, is doing its part
to combat climate change," Mayor Greg
Scharff said.
According to Scharff, Palo Alto had pre
viously used renewable energy grants for
carbon-free energy sources like solar and

wind. However, he emphasized the differ
ence between "carbon-free" and "energy
efficient" sources.
"They are separate programs," he said.
"Energy efficiency is getting a new refrig
erator and new windows to decrease ener
gy loss." In contrast, he said, carbon neu
trality involves the mitigation of excess car
bon emissions.
The switch to carbon-free electricity
was an easy one to make, Scharff said, de
creasing the city's carbon footprint by al
most 20 percent.
At the same meeting, council members
also called for further action on carbon
emissions. Palo Alto is aiming for a 60 per
cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions

over the next decade
According to Scharff, further progress
in reducing the city's carbon footprint must
come through electrification and potential
ly through the introduction of a higher tax
on carbon as a means of creating market in
centives for the transition.
"As far as I know, we are the only [car
bon-neutral city]," he said. "There might be
some in the Northwest, but no others in
California... I think it's a great achieve
ment for Palo Alto and the environment. It
shows Palo Alto is committed to the envi
ronment."
