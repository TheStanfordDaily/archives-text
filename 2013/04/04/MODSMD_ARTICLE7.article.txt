## R&DE rescinds proposed lawn treatment plan

Following protests last summer by Escondido Vil

EV residents were notified in an email that Colony had
reached an agreement with R&DE Student Housing
to implement a two-day chemical treatment of the fam

grass.
A multi-million dollar donation to renovate the
grass turf in EV's family courtyard was made four and

the donation, the University promised to "maintain the
donor's gift."
Before last summer, weeds were removed by
Colony manually, but the clover had since grown to the

and Speedzone, was deemed necessary to remove it.
Some EV residents, however, didn't see the need
for a more aggressive approach.
"I think it looks great," said James Redfield, a
