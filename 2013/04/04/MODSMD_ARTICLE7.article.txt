## R&DE rescinds proposed lawn treatment plan 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following protests last summer by Escondido Vil
lage (EV) residents, Residential and Dining Enterpris
es (R&DE) Student Housing has rescinded the pro
posed treatment of EV family courtyard lawns with
herbicide.
The University had previously planned to use con
tracting company Colony —which handles landscap
ing for Student Housing to kill weeds and clover on
the lawns. Instead, Housing will replace sections of the
lawns with new sod and seeding as needed.
"In response to the concerns expressed by resi
dents of the family courtyards, it was communicated
last summer that we have directed Colony not to use
any herbicides in the maintenance of the family court
yards," wrote Rodger Whitney, executive director of
R&DE Student Housing, in a statement. "Instead, re
placement of sections of sod will occur to control
weeds."
The controversy initially arose last summer when
EV residents were notified in an email that Colony had
reached an agreement with R&DE Student Housing
to implement a two-day chemical treatment of the fam
ily courtyard lawns in response to clover and crab
grass.
A multi-million dollar donation to renovate the
grass turf in EV's family courtyard was made four and
a half years ago by John Arrillaga '6O. At the time of
the donation, the University promised to "maintain the
donor's gift."
Before last summer, weeds were removed by
Colony manually, but the clover had since grown to the
point where chemical treatment, like herbicides Teflon
and Speedzone, was deemed necessary to remove it.
Some EV residents, however, didn't see the need
for a more aggressive approach.
"I think it looks great," said James Redfield, a
third-year graduate student in religious studies and a
family courtyards resident. "I mean,
I don't see the problem. I guess
there is some clover, [and] there are
some weeds that can't be treated by
just manual means and need some
chemical treatment, and that is what
the whole debate was about during
the summer."
Family courtyard residents
usually young families were a
particular area of concern.
"People have varying degree of
sensitivity, and the children play on
the grass," Redfield said. "I don't
think the housing office necessarily
took into account that the children
may literally be eating the grass."
R&DE Student Housing and
Michael VanFossen, senior associate
director of R&DE Student Housing,
were quick to organize a town hall
last summer after hearing of con
cerns, with their response widely
praised by the residents in atten
dance.
"No herbicides will be used in the
family courtyards," Whitney con
firmed.
