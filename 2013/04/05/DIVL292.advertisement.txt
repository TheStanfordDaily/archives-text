CALLING ALL
DOGS!!!
(Volunteers Reeded for Pet Visitation Program)
Do you have a dog that would make a good therapy dog? If you
feel your dog can demonstrate how to follow basic obedience
commands, has the desire and aptitude to be around strangers
and other animals, is comfortable in new environments and would
pass a veterinarian health screening, then your dog may be the animal
we're looking for! You would also have to meet volunteer guidelines.
Stanford Hospital and Clinics, in conjunction with Pet Partners (for
merly Delta Society) is holding a free orientation (about one hour)
on Saturday, April 6, 2013 at 2 p.m. in Palo Alto. No pets please -
