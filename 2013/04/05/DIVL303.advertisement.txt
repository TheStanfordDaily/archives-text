"The Higgs Boson and Our Life"
On 4 July 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments operating at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) announced the
discovery of a new particle compatible with the Higgs boson (hunted for almost 50 years), which is a crucial piece
for our understanding of fundamental physics and thus the structure and evolution of the universe. This lecture
describes the unprecedented instruments and challenges that have allowed such an accomplishment, the physics
meaning and relevance of this discovery, and the implications for our day-by-day life.
Afternoon Colloquium: Tuesday, April 9,2013 at 4:15 PM in the Hewlett Teaching
Center Room 201, Bldg 370, Serra Mall, Stanford University
"The Higgs Boson and other Recent Results from ATLAS"
Recent results from the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented, with em
phasis on Higgs physics. They are based in many cases on the full data sample recorded in 2011 and 2012. Meas
urements of the Higgs boson properties, and the present understanding of this recently-discovered, very special
particle, are discussed.
