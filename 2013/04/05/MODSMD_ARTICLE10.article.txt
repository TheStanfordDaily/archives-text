## Q&A: Prof. Paul Crowley on new Pope Religious studies professor identifies new openness in Catholic Church's positions 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The resignation in February of Pope Benedict
XVI and the subsequent election of Pope Francis
sent Shockwaves through the Catholic world. The
Daily sat down with Paul Crowley, professor of reli
gious studies, to discuss the significance and circum
stances of Francis' election and the challenges fac
ing the new Pope moving forward.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): The new pope is the
first Jesuit and the first Latin American to lead
the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. In a nutshell,
what do you think about the election of Pope
Francis and its significance for the Catholic
Church and the world?
Paul Crowley (PC): Well it's too early to tell in
one sense, because he's only been in for two weeks.
He has signaled that he wants to commence a new
era in the leadership of the Church. Symbolically
he's done that. For example, last Thursday [March
28] he washed the feet of young offenders in a juve
nile detention facility, including Muslim kids as well
as girls. It symbolized a real departure from previ
ous ways of doing things. So, he's signaling that we
should be open to what is new and embrace the new.
The other side is that he's also known to be a some
what conservative man, at least in terms of basic
teaching doctrine.
TSD: Could you expand a bit more on the "new
era"?
PC: For the past 35 years the Church has been
led by two very different popes, but they both
shared... a program to reassert a certain kind of
Catholic identity in the Church and in the world.
Some people would interpret it as having been con
servative. I think what this pope wants to do is sig
nal that what people have known for the past 35
years in the Catholic Church is not the only way to
run the ship and a message that is more compas
sionate, more inclusive [and] more open to the world
is also possible. He's also really throwing his lot with
young people [laughter],
TSD: According to Raymond Arroyo, news director
and lead anchor of EWTN Global Catholic Radio
Network, "Benedict and Francis are like Pavarotti
and Domingo the style is different but the songs
are the same." What is your take on that?
PC: It's premature to say that. What that guy
was saying was that basically the new Pope Francis
is going to be articulating exactly the same doctrine
as Benedict did. To some degree that may be true,
obviously there aren't going to be great big fun
damental changes. But there could be openness to
new things. There could be some surprises. So I'm
not sure it's Pavarotti and Domingo [laughter]. It
might be, I don't know, Pavarotti and U2.
TSD: The Pope also breaks tradition by being the
first pope to name himself Francis after St.
Francis of Assisi. What is the significance of this
choice?
PC: In most people's minds, Francis stands for
two things. One is the rebuilding of the Church from
the ground up, and the second is poverty. This pope,

coming from a developing continent, has seen pover
ty, and it's a very different world from what people
in North America and Europe are accustomed to
seeing. I think he wants to bring this to the attention
of the Church and to the world that the vast ma
jority of humanity is very, very poor, and that some
how this is what God is calling us to. Instead of the
spotlight all being drawn to the Pope, he wants the
spotlight to be on people who have been forgotten,
people who are on the margins, who are suffering in
a number of different kinds of ways.
TSD: Francis ascends to the papacy at a time
when the Church has been rocked in recent years
by scandals of sex abuse, corruption and infight
ing among the church hierarchy. How do you
think he will navigate the future?
PC: He absolutely has to do a couple of things.
He has to get control of the Vatican bureaucracy. He
has to send the message all the way down to the lo
cal dioceses and bishops that it's a new day and an
other style of church that he's trying to communi
cate. It's a humbler church. It's one that does not
necessarily know all the answers in advance and
that will be a listening church. So that's number one.
Number two, he has to, in very real ways, under
take convincing measures coming from Rome that
sexual abuse and any other kind of scandal will ab
solutely not be tolerated and there are mechanisms
in place all the way down the line so that will never
happen again. There's been some progress made in
that but there hasn't been enough accountability
asked of the bishops themselves and I think that's
what he really needs to do.
TSD: Today, we see that the Church has preserved
conservative positions on certain issues such as
human sexuality and bioethics, while adopting
more liberal positions on others like the death
penalty. What do you think of this modern
church that seems 'divided against itself'?
PC: The Church has to signal an openness to lis
tening to the various discordant voices in the
Church that are coming from positions of real life
experience and often real life suffering. That's num
ber one. I think the more there is the opportunity
for people to think they are being heard and listened
to, the less the possibility is that the whole thing will
collapse. I also think there are ways, theologically, to
reconsider some of what people think are closed is
sues. Just as one example, I think it is quite possible
to ordain women as deacons in the Church. I think
that should be no problem. Theologically and histor
ically that's justifiable, and most people see and un
derstand that.
The other thing to remember is a principle called
the 'development of doctrine' it's kind of a
Catholic version of evolution [laughter] where we
understand Church teaching as something that has
evolved over time in many cases. Sometimes there
have been real changes in Church teachings. For ex
ample, in the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church pro
hibited usury, charging interest on loans it is cer
tainly not prohibited now. The same with slavery
the Church, way up until the 19th century, had
[looked] the other way when it came to slavery. Now,
it's a major proponent of human rights. We are liv
ing within history and history is an ongoing, organ
ic, developing thing, and we want to be faithful to
tradition and at the same time open to where histo
ry and the spirit of history is drawing us.

[looked] the other way when it came to slavery. Now,
it's a major proponent of human rights. We are liv

The resignation in February of Pope Benedict
XVI and the subsequent election of Pope Francis
sent Shockwaves through the Catholic world. The
Daily sat down with Paul Crowley, professor of reli
gious studies, to discuss the significance and circum
stances of Francis' election and the challenges fac
ing the new Pope moving forward.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): The new pope is the
first Jesuit and the first Latin American to lead
the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. In a nutshell,
what do you think about the election of Pope
Francis and its significance for the Catholic
Church and the world?
Paul Crowley (PC): Well it's too early to tell in
one sense, because he's only been in for two weeks.
He has signaled that he wants to commence a new
era in the leadership of the Church. Symbolically
he's done that. For example, last Thursday [March
28] he washed the feet of young offenders in a juve
nile detention facility, including Muslim kids as well
as girls. It symbolized a real departure from previ
ous ways of doing things. So, he's signaling that we
should be open to what is new and embrace the new.
The other side is that he's also known to be a some
what conservative man, at least in terms of basic
teaching doctrine.
TSD: Could you expand a bit more on the "new
era"?
PC: For the past 35 years the Church has been
led by two very different popes, but they both
shared... a program to reassert a certain kind of
Catholic identity in the Church and in the world.
Some people would interpret it as having been con
servative. I think what this pope wants to do is sig
nal that what people have known for the past 35
years in the Catholic Church is not the only way to
run the ship and a message that is more compas
sionate, more inclusive [and] more open to the world
is also possible. He's also really throwing his lot with
young people [laughter],
TSD: According to Raymond Arroyo, news director
and lead anchor of EWTN Global Catholic Radio
Network, "Benedict and Francis are like Pavarotti
and Domingo the style is different but the songs
are the same." What is your take on that?
PC: It's premature to say that. What that guy
was saying was that basically the new Pope Francis
is going to be articulating exactly the same doctrine
as Benedict did. To some degree that may be true,
obviously there aren't going to be great big fun
damental changes. But there could be openness to
new things. There could be some surprises. So I'm
not sure it's Pavarotti and Domingo [laughter]. It
might be, I don't know, Pavarotti and U2.
TSD: The Pope also breaks tradition by being the
first pope to name himself Francis after St.
Francis of Assisi. What is the significance of this
choice?
PC: In most people's minds, Francis stands for
two things. One is the rebuilding of the Church from
the ground up, and the second is poverty. This pope,

coming from a developing continent, has seen pover
ty, and it's a very different world from what people
in North America and Europe are accustomed to
seeing. I think he wants to bring this to the attention
of the Church and to the world that the vast ma
jority of humanity is very, very poor, and that some
how this is what God is calling us to. Instead of the
spotlight all being drawn to the Pope, he wants the
spotlight to be on people who have been forgotten,
people who are on the margins, who are suffering in
a number of different kinds of ways.
TSD: Francis ascends to the papacy at a time
when the Church has been rocked in recent years
by scandals of sex abuse, corruption and infight
ing among the church hierarchy. How do you
think he will navigate the future?
PC: He absolutely has to do a couple of things.
He has to get control of the Vatican bureaucracy. He
has to send the message all the way down to the lo
cal dioceses and bishops that it's a new day and an
other style of church that he's trying to communi
cate. It's a humbler church. It's one that does not
necessarily know all the answers in advance and
that will be a listening church. So that's number one.
Number two, he has to, in very real ways, under
take convincing measures coming from Rome that
sexual abuse and any other kind of scandal will ab
solutely not be tolerated and there are mechanisms
in place all the way down the line so that will never
happen again. There's been some progress made in
that but there hasn't been enough accountability
asked of the bishops themselves and I think that's
what he really needs to do.
TSD: Today, we see that the Church has preserved
conservative positions on certain issues such as
human sexuality and bioethics, while adopting
more liberal positions on others like the death
penalty. What do you think of this modern
church that seems 'divided against itself'?
PC: The Church has to signal an openness to lis
tening to the various discordant voices in the
Church that are coming from positions of real life
experience and often real life suffering. That's num
ber one. I think the more there is the opportunity
for people to think they are being heard and listened
to, the less the possibility is that the whole thing will
collapse. I also think there are ways, theologically, to
reconsider some of what people think are closed is
sues. Just as one example, I think it is quite possible
to ordain women as deacons in the Church. I think
that should be no problem. Theologically and histor
ically that's justifiable, and most people see and un
derstand that.
The other thing to remember is a principle called
the 'development of doctrine' it's kind of a
Catholic version of evolution [laughter] where we
understand Church teaching as something that has
evolved over time in many cases. Sometimes there
have been real changes in Church teachings. For ex
ample, in the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church pro
hibited usury, charging interest on loans it is cer
tainly not prohibited now. The same with slavery
the Church, way up until the 19th century, had
[looked] the other way when it came to slavery. Now,
it's a major proponent of human rights. We are liv
ing within history and history is an ongoing, organ
ic, developing thing, and we want to be faithful to
tradition and at the same time open to where histo
ry and the spirit of history is drawing us.
