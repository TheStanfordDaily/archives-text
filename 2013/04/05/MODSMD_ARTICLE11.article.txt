## CARD SEEKS HOT HITTING 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
It's been a pretty interesting sea
son for the Cardinal baseball team so
far. Despite a largely anemic offense,
Stanford has been able to collect vic
tories due to its rock-solid pitching
staff, with the hitting and defense
usually doing just enough to come
out on top.
"Just enough" this season has
been rather unconventional, howev
er, as the boys from The Farm have
benefited from an extra-inning walk
off, a triple play, and the ability to
score four runs on only two hits,
among many other things, to secure
wins. Stanford (14-9, 4-3 Pac-12) will
travel to Southern California over
the weekend to face the USC Tro
jans (11-17, 4-5 Pac-12) and hope to
win all-important conference games,
regardless of how it happens.
In Friday night's opener, the Car
dinal knows exactly what to expect.
Just like it has for the first game of
every weekend series this season,
Stanford will turn to its proven
workhorse, star senior Mark Appel,

GAME NOTES: While Stanford's pitchers
have been consistently solid this season,
posting a collective .254 ERA, the bats
have been far more unsteady.
to stait the series off on the right
foot.
In his final season wearing Cardi
nal red, the big righty has given
Stanford every reason to have faith
in his arm. Appel still has yet to give
up more than two earned runs in any
of his six starts, is averaging more
than a strikeout per inning pitched,
has fanned eight times as many hit
ters as he has walked and has
pitched two complete-game shutouts

to boot.
Although the performance from
the bullpen has tailed off a bit since
its lights-out beginning of the sea
son, the rest of the pitching staff has
also more than held its own. Boast
ing a team ERA of 2.54 with a bat
ting-average-against of only .223, the
Stanford pitching coips behind Ap
pel has bailed out the offense on nu
merous occasions.
Freshman Bobby Zarubin, who
was given the game-two stalling nod
in the Card's last series against
Washington State, has been a wel

come addition to the pitching staff.
Despite pitching in his first season of
college-level ball, the righty from
San Diego has dominated opposing
hitters to the tune of a 1.78 ERA and
23 strikeouts in 30-plus innings.
The offense remains the question
mark, however, and the inability of
the Stanford hitters to consistently
produce runs is holding the Cardinal
back from being among the elite up
per echelon of teams in the country.
The team owns a meager 2-7

Sophomore Austin Slater (above) leads the Cardinal in hitting, but the
offense has provided inconsistent run support for the pitching staff.
Stanford will look to improve at the plate this weekend against USC.
