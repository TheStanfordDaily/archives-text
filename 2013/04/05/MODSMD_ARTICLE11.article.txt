## CARD SEEKS HOT HITTING 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
It's been a pretty interesting sea
son for the Cardinal baseball team so
far. Despite a largely anemic offense,
Stanford has been able to collect vic
tories due to its rock-solid pitching
staff, with the hitting and defense
usually doing just enough to come
out on top.
"Just enough" this season has
been rather unconventional, howev
er, as the boys from The Farm have
benefited from an extra-inning walk
off, a triple play, and the ability to
score four runs on only two hits,
among many other things, to secure
wins. Stanford (14-9, 4-3 Pac-12) will
travel to Southern California over
the weekend to face the USC Tro
jans (11-17, 4-5 Pac-12) and hope to
win all-important conference games,
regardless of how it happens.
In Friday night's opener, the Car
dinal knows exactly what to expect.
Just like it has for the first game of
every weekend series this season,
Stanford will turn to its proven
workhorse, star senior Mark Appel,

to stait the series off on the right
foot.
In his final season wearing Cardi
nal red, the big righty has given
Stanford every reason to have faith
in his arm. Appel still has yet to give
up more than two earned runs in any
of his six starts, is averaging more
than a strikeout per inning pitched,
has fanned eight times as many hit
ters as he has walked and has
pitched two complete-game shutouts

to boot.
Although the performance from
the bullpen has tailed off a bit since
its lights-out beginning of the sea
son, the rest of the pitching staff has
also more than held its own. Boast
ing a team ERA of 2.54 with a bat
ting-average-against of only .223, the
Stanford pitching coips behind Ap

merous occasions.
Freshman Bobby Zarubin, who
was given the game-two stalling nod
in the Card's last series against
Washington State, has been a wel

Despite pitching in his first season of
college-level ball, the righty from
San Diego has dominated opposing
hitters to the tune of a 1.78 ERA and
23 strikeouts in 30-plus innings.
The offense remains the question
mark, however, and the inability of
the Stanford hitters to consistently
produce runs is holding the Cardinal
back from being among the elite up

13 runs scored, 26 hits, 6 dou

are tops on the team. The
team is 7-2 in games in which
he has recorded an RBI.
Stanford's offense will have to
emerge as the season pro

huge part of that moving for

After a 9-3 start to the sea
son, the Trojans have dropped
off dramatically as of late, as
they have lost 11 of their last
14 games. Unlike the Cardi

staff has been the Achilles
heel for the Men of Troy. The
Trojan staff has a collective
ERA of 4.89, providing the
Stanford offense with a great
opportunity to bounce back
and use a solid series to pro
pel itself moving forward.
Stanford, the winner of
three of its last four games,

gling USC pitching staff in or

those close losses would be
come less frequent.
In the heart of the lineup is
rapidly emerging sophomore
Austin Slater, who is making
things happen with his bat.
After only appearing in seven
games last year, he earned
playing time at the beginning
of the season due to the injury
to star outfielder Austin Wil
son. Slater certainly made the
most of his opportunity, quick
ly developing into one of the
team's best hitters. The re
sults speak for themselves.

Slater's .321 average is the
best among the starters. His
13 runs scored, 26 hits, 6 dou
bles, 2 home runs and 14 RBI
are tops on the team. The
team is 7-2 in games in which
he has recorded an RBI.
Stanford's offense will have to
emerge as the season pro
gresses, and Slater will be a
huge part of that moving for
ward.
After a 9-3 start to the sea
son, the Trojans have dropped
off dramatically as of late, as
they have lost 11 of their last
14 games. Unlike the Cardi
nal, an unreliable pitching
staff has been the Achilles
heel for the Men of Troy. The
Trojan staff has a collective
ERA of 4.89, providing the
Stanford offense with a great
opportunity to bounce back
and use a solid series to pro
pel itself moving forward.
Stanford, the winner of
three of its last four games,
will rely on its solid pitching
and hope that the offense
comes to life against a strug
gling USC pitching staff in or
der to claim victories over the
weekend. First pitch on Fri
day night is at 6 p.m.

It's been a pretty interesting sea
son for the Cardinal baseball team so
far. Despite a largely anemic offense,
Stanford has been able to collect vic
tories due to its rock-solid pitching
staff, with the hitting and defense
usually doing just enough to come
out on top.
"Just enough" this season has
been rather unconventional, howev
er, as the boys from The Farm have
benefited from an extra-inning walk
off, a triple play, and the ability to
score four runs on only two hits,
among many other things, to secure
wins. Stanford (14-9, 4-3 Pac-12) will
travel to Southern California over
the weekend to face the USC Tro
jans (11-17, 4-5 Pac-12) and hope to
win all-important conference games,
regardless of how it happens.
In Friday night's opener, the Car
dinal knows exactly what to expect.
Just like it has for the first game of
every weekend series this season,
Stanford will turn to its proven
workhorse, star senior Mark Appel,

to stait the series off on the right
foot.
In his final season wearing Cardi
nal red, the big righty has given
Stanford every reason to have faith
in his arm. Appel still has yet to give
up more than two earned runs in any
of his six starts, is averaging more
than a strikeout per inning pitched,
has fanned eight times as many hit
ters as he has walked and has
pitched two complete-game shutouts

to boot.
Although the performance from
the bullpen has tailed off a bit since
its lights-out beginning of the sea
son, the rest of the pitching staff has
also more than held its own. Boast
ing a team ERA of 2.54 with a bat
ting-average-against of only .223, the
Stanford pitching coips behind Ap
pel has bailed out the offense on nu
merous occasions.
Freshman Bobby Zarubin, who
was given the game-two stalling nod
in the Card's last series against
Washington State, has been a wel

come addition to the pitching staff.
Despite pitching in his first season of
college-level ball, the righty from
San Diego has dominated opposing
hitters to the tune of a 1.78 ERA and
23 strikeouts in 30-plus innings.
The offense remains the question
mark, however, and the inability of
the Stanford hitters to consistently
produce runs is holding the Cardinal
back from being among the elite up
per echelon of teams in the country.
The team owns a meager 2-7
