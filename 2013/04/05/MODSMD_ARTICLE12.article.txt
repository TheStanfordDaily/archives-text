The No. 47 Stanford men's tennis team will
battle No. 30 Washington and No. 44 Oregon on
the road this weekend in the Cardinal's first
away matches since the Pacific Coast Doubles
Tournament in early March.
Stanford (7-7, 0-2 Pac-12) hopes to earn its
first conference win after back-to-back losses
against No. 3 USC and No. 2 UCLA last week
end. The Cardinal will face off against Washing
ton on Friday and Oregon on Saturday before
returning home for five consecutive matches at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium to end the
Pac-12 season.
"We're really excited for this last month. I
think we're really getting better every day in
practice, and in matches we are playing better
and better," said sophomore Robert Stineman.
