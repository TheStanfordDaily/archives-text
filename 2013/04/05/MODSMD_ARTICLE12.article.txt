## 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 47 Stanford men's tennis team will
battle No. 30 Washington and No. 44 Oregon on
the road this weekend in the Cardinal's first
away matches since the Pacific Coast Doubles
Tournament in early March.
Stanford (7-7, 0-2 Pac-12) hopes to earn its
first conference win after back-to-back losses
against No. 3 USC and No. 2 UCLA last week
end. The Cardinal will face off against Washing
ton on Friday and Oregon on Saturday before
returning home for five consecutive matches at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium to end the
Pac-12 season.
"We're really excited for this last month. I
think we're really getting better every day in
practice, and in matches we are playing better
and better," said sophomore Robert Stineman.

Sophomore Robert Stineman (above) and
the men's tennis team have two chances to
earn their first conference win against
Washington and Oregon this weekend.
"Hopefully, we can have a
good start to the spring quar
ter this weekend."
Sophomore John Morris
sey, who plays No. 1 singles
and doubles, said that while
the team has enjoyed playing
at home, the players are look
ing forward to this weekend's
away matches.
"It's really different to
play away, you travel and get
close with the team, and I
think we are really excited to
go and prove a point that we
can do something away," he
said. "Obviously, it's been
great to play a lot of matches
at home too, but it is just a dif
ferent dimension."
Washington, which owns a
15-6 season record and a 2-0
Pac-12 record, defeated No.
71 Arizona and No. 75 Utah
on the road last weekend and
is currently on a six-match
victory streak. The Huskies
are tied with UCLA and USC
for first place in the Pac-12
standings.
"Washington's a great
team. They've got a lot of
good players," Stineman said.
"We're expecting a very
tough match. We're going to
go out there with the same
kind of intensity we had
against the L.A. schools."
Though Washington has a
4-36 series record against the
Cardinal and was defeated 7-
0 by Stanford last year, the
Huskies hope to benefit from
their home-court advantage.
"They are a very good
team with a lot of good play
ers, and we're playing up in
their house, so we'll see how it
goes," Morrissey said. "We're
going to take it match by
match and focus on the little
things, and hopefully the re

suit will take care of itself at
the end of the day."
The Cardinal can expect a
challenge from national No.
21 Kyle McMorrow, who has
won his last ten matches at
No. 1 singles for the Huskies.
McMorrow will likely face off
against Morrissey, who is
ranked 54th nationally.
"I know he's a very good
player and he's obviously had
some really good results, too,
so I'm just going to go out
there and try to do what I've
been working on," Morrissey
said.
Following the match
against the Cardinal, Wash
ington will host No. 21 Berke
ley on Saturday. Oregon will
also face off against Cal on
Friday before their match
against Stanford on Saturday.
While Oregon has a 1-1
Pac 12 record, with a 5-2 loss
to Utah and a 6-1 win against
Arizona last weekend, the
Ducks have a 14-3 season
record and are currently 11-0
at home.
Though the Cardinal
blanked Oregon last year
and has a 26-0 series record
against the Ducks Oregon
boasts an extremely strong
doubles lineup this year, with

14-1,13-1 and 10-1 records for
No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 dou
bles, respectively. The team
has not lost a doubles point
this season.
"Oregon is better than
they have been in years past,
so they are going to be a
tough team to beat," Stine
man said, noting that if the
Cardinal focuses on each
match and brings a high level
of energy, he believes they are
"going to be fine."
Morrissey agreed, refer
encing Stanford's recent vic
tories in doubles against
UCLA and USC as proof that
the team can "play and beat
some of the best doubles
teams in the country." Mor
rissey added that the team is
very optimistic about their re
maining matches this season.
"In comparison to the
start of the season, I feel like
the team has improved a lot,"
he said. "The freshmen have
gained a lot of experience,
and we're going to need to use
that experience when we are
away on the road this week
end against two very difficult
schools."
