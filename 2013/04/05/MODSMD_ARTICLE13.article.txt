# SIGHTS SET ON OREGON

### ANNA BLUE STAFF WRITER 
There was no neighborly
feeling between the two
crosstown rivals on Wednesday
night when the No. 12 Stanford
women's tennis team took down
Santa Clara 5-2 at home.

The reliability of players
Kristie Ahn, ranked 30th nation
ally, and Krista Hardebeck,
ranked 14th nationally, was a
key force in the win. The Cardi
nal refused to be thrown off by
the spontaneous change in
schedule the game was
moved up a day early and
they approached the non-confer
ence game with ferocity.
Ahn defeated the Broncos'
Kelly Lamble in smashing
scores of 6-1 and 6-2, while
Hardebeck finished off Santa
Clara with wins of 6-1 and 6-1
against Alex Zaniewski. Harde
beck was also significant in the
late March win against No. 4
UCLA, when the Cardinal's per
sistence was rewarded with a
suspenseful 4-3 win.
Santa Clara has struggled
recently against top-ranked
teams as it lost to both No. 20
Rice and Pepperdine last week,
but the besieged Broncos man
aged to upset No. 61 Loyola
Marymount University to break
then* losing streak.
Santa Clara's strongest ef
fort came from the Broncos' No.
1 player Katie Le, a junior who
recently moved up four spots in
the Intercollegiate Tennis Asso
ciation polls after her solid per
formance against BYU on
March 23. Stanford's Nicole
Gibbs was unable to fend off

Le's advances and she fell to Le
6-7, 6-3,1-0 in one of the Cardi
nal's two close losses to SCU.
"I personally have just been
having a little difficulty mentally
and physically," Gibbs said. "I
haven't physically been where I
want to be in terms of what I
need to put in on the track and in
the weight room, as well as in
terms of injuries. A lot to be de
sired in terms of the physicality
level something I'm looking
to address in this temporary hia
tus from singles."
Gibbs and partner Ahn pow
ered through their doubles
match win to put the Cardinal

ahead early. The Gibbs and Ahn
duo, along with the consistent
doubles play of Stacey Tan and
Ellen Tsay, will be critical for the
match against Oregon this
weekend. Though Gibbs will not
be playing singles against the
Ducks due to a minor injury, the
defending NCAA singles and
doubles champion expects to re
turn to the solo action soon.
For unranked Oregon, cur
rently boasting a winning record
of 11-6, the match at Stanford
will not be the only challenge
this weekend. Before traveling
to the Farm, the Ducks will face
No. 11 California across the
Bay for an in-conference
matchup. According to head
coach Lele Forood, Stanford
will need to take advantage of
the Ducks' back-to-back sched
ule and their 0-3 record on the
road.
Although Stanford put Ore
gon away with a 6-1 win last
year, the women will need to re
main focused when they square
off against experienced Ducks
players like Patricia Skowrons
ki and Julia Metzger. Metzger, a
sophomore who provides huge
backbone to the Oregon team, is
14-2 overall in singles matches
and has had a winning streak of
over 10 games this year*.
"[Oregon is] always a little
bit of a mystery to us," Gibbs
said. "They recruit a ton inter
nationally... We are focusing on
taking care of our side of the
court and improving our game."
Stanford will look to players
like Hardebeck and Dillon to
combat the steady play of Met
zger. Dillon may look to avenge
the only loss that Stanford
