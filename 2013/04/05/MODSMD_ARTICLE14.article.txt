# Does Stanford need its own Andy Enfield?
## 
### Sam Fisher 
Yesterday I got an email
from a Stanford alumnus
that made me ask myself a
very difficult question:
Who would I rather have
as Stanford men's basketball's head
coach, Johnny Dawkins or Andy En
field?

A few weeks ago, I asked whether
the Cardinal's first round loss to Ari
zona State in the Pac-12 tournament
would mean the end of Dawkins' five
year tenure. The biggest reason I
asked the question and didn't just
call for his filing—was that I was un
sure of the caliber of coach Stanford
that could attract right now
But Andy Enfield's hiring at USC
changes things.
With the sharp downturns that
both USC and Stanford have taken as
of late, the two jobs are pretty compa
rable.

So if USC could pull a (quickly) ris
ing star like Enfield, could Stanford
have gotten him, or someone like him,
if we tried?
Maybe some of you aren't sold on
Enfield. Tb be fair, he's only been a
head coach for two years, and he
coached at a school that was pretty
much anonymous until its victory over
Georgetown just a few weeks ago.
But even if Enfield isn't as polished,
or even as good, as he may seem right
now, wouldn't it be fun to try him out?
I've made the argument again and
again—and I'm sure I'll make it a few
more times next year—that Stanford
men's basketball has two problems,
not just one.
Not only is the team not very
good, judging by the zero NCAA
Tournament appearances in
Dawkins' tenure, but the team isn't
fun to watch.
As a sports team in a major mar
ket, and even more so in a market
where the weather is great and there
are many alternative things to do,
you have to be great entertainment.
Stanford men's basketball has not
been good entertainment over the
last few years. Even if the team had
won a few extra games and
squeaked into the NCAA Tourna
ment, it still wouldn't have been good
entertainment though I certainly
would have taken it!
Heck, look at Stanford football.
When Andrew Luck 'l2 left after
the 2011 season, even though the
team was still pretty good and cer
tainly better than Stanford men's
basketball, attendance really suf
fered.
Stanford football built that 2011
enthusiasm the hard way. For years,
the team worked and worked to get
better, and it finally earned presea
son buzz for 2011 with a great 2010
season and Luck's decision to return.
But there is an alternative, and
it's one made famous by Oregon
football. You can make yourself good

by being exciting.
It may seem counterintu
itive, especially at a place like
Stanford that values excel
lence, but it is possible. If you
can just play an exciting
brand of basketball, people
will come. At the end of the
day, sports are about enter
tainment. Even if a team
doesn't make the NCAA
Tournament every year, peo
ple will still watch its games if
they're fun to watch.
Having fans show up to
games and enjoy the experi
ence will have a big impact on
the recruits. I understand
that, with Stanford's academ
ic requirements, it's hard to
get the best players, but if
Stanford football can find 15
to 20 guys per year, Stanford
basketball should be able to
find three or four.
I'm sure Cal won't admit
to this, but I'm guessing the

Golden Bears are using some
of this strategy with the new
direction of then- football pro
gram. Is Sonny Dykes a win
ner in the Pac-12 right now?
I'm not so sure.
But Dykes' offense, which
averaged 51.5 points per
game in the WAC with
Louisiana Tech last season,
certainly should be exciting to
watch. And for a school that
desperately needs to put
butts in some seats but does
n't have the talent to win a
championship right now, that
may be Cal's best bet.
So why not take that
strategy to Stanford men's
basketball? I don't know if it
could end up much worse
than having 500 people show
up for an NIT game at the
end of another disappointing
season.
