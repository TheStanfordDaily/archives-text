# Does Stanford need its own Andy Enfield?

### Sam Fisher 
Yesterday I got an email
from a Stanford alumnus
that made me ask myself a
very difficult question:
Who would I rather have
as Stanford men's basketball's head
coach, Johnny Dawkins or Andy En
field?

A few weeks ago, I asked whether
the Cardinal's first round loss to Ari
zona State in the Pac-12 tournament
would mean the end of Dawkins' five
year tenure. The biggest reason I
asked the question and didn't just
call for his filing—was that I was un
sure of the caliber of coach Stanford
that could attract right now
But Andy Enfield's hiring at USC
changes things.
With the sharp downturns that
both USC and Stanford have taken as
of late, the two jobs are pretty compa
rable.

So if USC could pull a (quickly) ris
ing star like Enfield, could Stanford
have gotten him, or someone like him,
if we tried?
Maybe some of you aren't sold on
Enfield. Tb be fair, he's only been a
head coach for two years, and he
coached at a school that was pretty
much anonymous until its victory over
Georgetown just a few weeks ago.
But even if Enfield isn't as polished,
or even as good, as he may seem right
now, wouldn't it be fun to try him out?
I've made the argument again and
again—and I'm sure I'll make it a few
more times next year—that Stanford
men's basketball has two problems,
not just one.
Not only is the team not very
good, judging by the zero NCAA
Tournament appearances in
Dawkins' tenure, but the team isn't
fun to watch.
As a sports team in a major mar
ket, and even more so in a market
where the weather is great and there
are many alternative things to do,
you have to be great entertainment.
Stanford men's basketball has not
been good entertainment over the
last few years. Even if the team had
won a few extra games and
squeaked into the NCAA Tourna
ment, it still wouldn't have been good
entertainment though I certainly
would have taken it!
Heck, look at Stanford football.
When Andrew Luck 'l2 left after
the 2011 season, even though the
team was still pretty good and cer
tainly better than Stanford men's
basketball, attendance really suf
fered.
Stanford football built that 2011
enthusiasm the hard way. For years,
the team worked and worked to get
better, and it finally earned presea
son buzz for 2011 with a great 2010
season and Luck's decision to return.
But there is an alternative, and
it's one made famous by Oregon
football. You can make yourself good
