# I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE CANDY SHOP
## Decadence a tasters guide 
### Roxanna Reaves | STAFF WRITER 
Earlier this school year, Stanford's very own
sweet shop, Decadence, made its debut
in Tresidder Union. While we all know
Starbucks' pastry offerings are consistently
yummy, Decadence offers a unique and novel
selection of sweets that are definitely worth a try.
And, if novelty isn't quite enough to persuade
you, did I mention that Decadence also takes
meal plan dollars? That's right: you can get one
of their delicious freshly baked cookies which
rival the warm (and some say, seductive) Late
Nite and Axe & Palm varieties and use your
pre-paid meal plan cash. Talk about guilt-free
desserts.
I decided to try a wide variety of their
desserts. This included three different types of
macarons (coconut-passion fruit, chocolate and
pistachio), some chocolate pastries including a
chocolate petit four, rocky road cheesecake, a
chocolate-orange truffle and one fruity raspber
ry mouse dessert. Some kind friends also went
out of their way to help me finish the desserts

and give their input, too.
Macarons
Macarons have become the newest "trendy
dessert," following after the popular ffo-yo craze
(embodied by Decadence's neighbor Fraiche)
and (most recently) the designer cupcake fad.
These small French confections typically have
some sort of flavored ganache or buttercream
sandwiched between two delicate-yet-chewy
cookies. Decadence's macarons were very
impressive for a Stanford-run sweet shop. The
texture of the cookie portion contained just the
right balance of soft and chewy, without com
mitting the common mistake of being overly
mushy or worse, stale. However, in the
coconut-passion fruit macaron, the coconut fla
vor was too subtle, practically completely miss
ing in the cookie. Still, the punch of the passion
fruit ganache inside made up for the lack of
coconut and made for a very tasty dessert.
The chocolate and pistachio macarons both had

just the right degree of kick and sweetness, as
my fellow samplers Elly Untermeyer 'l6 and
Javier Guinard 'l4 expressed. The chocolate
macaron, in fact, had a little bit of an orange
zesty tang to it, while the pistachio macaron was
delightfully non-artificial tasting.
Although these little cookies are individually on
the pricy side, many of the tasters, including
Ambika Acharya 'l6, said, "I would definitely get
a box of [the macarons] using my meal plan
dollars."
Chocolate Pastries
Chocolate Petit Four This tiny bite-sized
cake is covered in chocolate and has a thin but
intensely flavored marzipan layer over a cube of
chocolate cake. The petit four had mixed reviews
among my samplers, who commented on the
overpowering almond flavor of the marzipan
and slightly dry cake portion. Still, its adorable
presentation and cute fondant Stanford "S" was
an all around big hit.

Rocky Road Cheesecake Arguably the
best of the chocolate desserts, this cheesecake
had an intense chocolate flavor while still main
taining its signature sweet, silky and cream
cheesy tartness. The cheesecake is topped with
dark chocolate and perfectly soft mini-marsh
mallows that, as Maggie Murphy 'l6 and Carlos
Girod 'l6 both noted, were a surprisingly great
and not gratuitous, as marshmallow toppings
can often be addition. However, the crust was
weak, offering little crunch or taste to the other
wise-delicious cheesecake.
Chocolate-Orange Truffle The truffle
was probably my least favorite of the chocolate
desserts. The orange filling tasted rather artificial
and took away from the naturally delicious dark
chocolate, which made up the thick outer shell of
the truffle. I would probably recommend skip
ping this particular selection and instead getting


the chocolate macaron, which
had similar flavors.
Fancy and Fruity
The Raspberry-Mousse
and-Pistachio-Cake Cup was
incredibly flavorful and truly
aesthetically beautiful. The
mousse is served in a clear
plastic trapezoidal prism that
showcases the layers of intense
raspberry mousse, soaked pis
tachio cake and vanilla mousse

that Marja Diaz '16 describes
as tasting like the "non-burnt
part of creme brulee."
In all honesty, I'm not a
huge fan of raspberry. But this
dessert changed me. I felt the
mousse was an ideal consisten
cy and the raspberry and pista
chio were paired deliberately
and deliciously. Overall, I
would definitely get it again —
or give it to a certain someone
I wanted to impress.
