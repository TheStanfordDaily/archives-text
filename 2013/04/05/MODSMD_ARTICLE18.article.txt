## THE 						TOP 5 FIVE Documentaries on Netflix Intermission looks at the lesser-known hits 
### Alexandra Heeney | STAFF WRITER 
Netflix can be tough to sift through;
although it is full of fantastic lesser
known films, there are many terrible
films in the library to pad the numbers. Here is a
list of five fantastic documentaries, available on
Netflix now, that should not be missed.
"Side by Side" (2012)
This fantastic documentary about the
advent of digital cinema is not only a must-see
crash course on cinema for all film-lovers, but
also a fascinating look at the process of techno
logical change; how it happens, when and how
people adapt, and how it changes the way things
are done. "Side by Side" examines how digital
cinema is influencing the way that movies are
made at every step of the creative process, from
filming to post-production. Keanu Reeves inter
views the leaders of the digital revolution,
including cinematographer Anthony Dod

Mantle and directors David Fincher, Danny
Boyle and Steven Soderbergh, as well as the tra
ditionalists who hold celluloid holy, like director
Christopher Nolan and his cinematographer,
Wally Pfister.

"Gerhard Richter Painting" (2011)
Corinna Belz's recent documentary
"Gerhard Richter Painting" offers a revealing peek
into the creative process by following one the
greats in contemporary painting, Gerhard
Richter, in his studio as he paints. It's a medita
tive film slow by design, but compelling: we
watch as Richter adds layer upon layer of paint
to the canvas, lets the paintings sit and then edits
and changes them even when you think the
piece is done. Richter is not particularly articu
late about his work, but it doesn't matter; it's
about watching the minutiae the details of
his method that gives insight into how art of

any kind gets made.
"49 Up" (2005)
Michael Apted's "Up" series, of which the
most recent, "56 Up," was just released in cinemas,
is a riveting anthropological study in how and
whether people really change, and how much of
a person's character, personality and future
prospects are cemented early in life. Every seven
years, starting with the first film "7 Up," when
the group of British participants from varying
socioeconomic backgrounds were all seven
years old, a new film is made, and the same
group of people who began this experiment
when they were children are once again inter
viewed about their lives and views. You can start
with the first film all are on Netflix but
you still get the idea by starting with the later
films, which have more insight and depth and
include clips from the previous films.

"Cave of Forgotten Dreams" (2010)
Wernher Herzog's "Cave of Forgotten
Dreams" was one of the first films to make good
use of the new 3D technology, taking you into the
Chauvet caves in Southern France (where the old
est paintings ever found are) and making you feel
like you are actually there. Although the effect is
subdued in two dimensions, it is still a wonderful
film that gives the world access to historical paint
ings which are normally closed off to all but a few
select scientists. Herzog's fascination with the
eccentric is ever-present in this film too: one of
the scientists studying the caves used to be in the
circus; he finds a man who searches for caves by
sniffing; and the film ends with a perplexing
visit to the zoo to see albino alligators.
"Microcosmos" (1996)
Back in the days when few documentaries
hit cinemas and even fewer made it outside
the arthouse circuit "Microcosmos" was
made. It's an utterly gorgeous and compelling
documentary about the everyday lives of insects
in a meadow in France. "Microcosmos" consists
almost entirely of images of the movements and
interactions of insects going about their daily
lives. Using specialized macroscopic photogra
phy techniques, directors Claude Nuridsany and
Marie Perennou find beauty in creatures we
rarely think twice about by capturing spectacu
lar and enrapturing images: we see the insects
going about their daily lives, fighting to the
death and mating, all with amazing detail.
