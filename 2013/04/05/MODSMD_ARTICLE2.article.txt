B the gold-medal game,
I went into a small,
I room and I laid
down and I thought about being a
little kid and how I played out in the
neighborhood and how I would
imagine this big arena filled with
people, and I thought: 'I am living

Tara VanDerveer has not only
fulfilled her own dreams of playing
college basketball and of witnessing
women's basketball become a domi
nant sport in the athletic world, but
she is also the reason that so many
young women today have had that

same opportunity.
"Basketball has been an incredible
thing that you never could have imag-

ined. When I was in college, I never could have imagined
that this was what it would grow into," VanDerveer reflect
ed. "It's been a great life. I can't even imagine a better life."
Few basketball coaches, male or female, can boast the
coaching career and legacy that VanDerveer has created. In
her 27 seasons as head coach of Stanford's women's basket
ball team, the trailblazer in women's athletics has led the
Cardinal to a record of 742-152,25 NCAA Tournament ap
pearances, including two national championships (1990,
1992) and 10 final fours, 21 regular season conference titles,
and 10 Pac-12/Pac-10 tournament crowns.
Along the way, VanDerveer has received due recognition
for these accomplishments, many achieved at a time when
female athletes were not taken as seriously as their male

counterparts.
For the four-time National
Coach of the Year (1988-90,2011),
13-time Pac-12/Pac-10 Coach of
the Year and Naismith Basketball
Hall of Famer, though, modesty is
her policy. However, the impact
VanDerveer has had on the realm
of women's sports cannot be fully
comprehended without tracing
her struggles and triumphs.

'All the boys in the neighbor
hood always played [basketball]
together. So I just loved playing
[with them]. For some reason I
loved basketball I can't tell you
why, but I liked the strategy of it,"
explains VanDerveer. "It's so
physical and it's fast."
Playing with the boys wasn't
always an easy thing to break in
to, though. VanDerveer demon-

strated her determination and savvy early on when she
bought the best basketball possible, but told the boys they
could use it only if they let her play—and more often than
not she got her way.
Her high school didn't have any female sports teams and
she took up cheerleading instead. Even when she trans
ferred to a private all-girls school, competition only consist
ed of "fun days" with different teams playing against each
other nothing like organized high school basketball to
day.
VanDerveer wasn't just satisfied with a taste of basket
ball in her life, she wanted the whole thing and was deter-

mined to play in college.

"When I went to college I
played on a college team that
was like a Division 111 [Al
bany]," VanDerveer said.
"That's where I jumped cen
ter, I was the leading scorer,
the leading rebounder, leading
assist, leading turnover."
After a year, she realized
she wasn't satisfied with being
a big fish in a little pond and
transferred to Indiana Uni
versity—where she was still
a big fish, but in a much big
ger pond.
VanDerveer immediately
thrived with her new team at
Indiana. She recalls several
occasions when she and her
teammates would fantasize
about the future of women's
basketball, but with only a
nine-game regular season, the
thought of any advancement
was far-fetched.
"We'd joke that there
would be a professional
women's league. They'd say
'Yeah, I'll be the general man
ager, and Tara, you'll be the
coach,"' VanDerveer recalled.
"It was just comical talking to
my teammates, because there
were no scholarships. I
worked in the kitchen to pay
for school."
After college, VanDerveer
planned on taking a year off
before attending law school
but money ran out and she
was back home by Christmas.
It was her father who unwit
tingly got the ball rolling on
her coaching career when he
suggested that VanDerveer
coach her sister Maine's high
school basketball team.
♦ ♦♦
Title IX was just starting
to take effect and more high
schools were adopting girl's
basketball programs. But giv
en that her sister's team had
just lost by a 99-11 score the
previous night, VanDerveer
was far from eager to devote
time to that team. However,
her dad convinced her to be a
volunteer coach and her life
long commitment to coaching
began.
"I felt I had a lot to offer
because I knew a lot about
basketball. I studied it all the
time. When I was at Indiana, I
watched every practice that

Bobby Knight had at Indiana
and I also took his coaching
class," VanDerveer said. "I
went to the clinic and it was
like 500 guys and I was the on
ly woman there, and I sat
right in front."
After coaching her sister's
team, VanDerveer got a grad
uate coaching position at Ohio
State, which included coach
ing the JV to an undefeated
season, and stayed there until
she completed her master's in
sports management and ad
ministration.
VanDerveer's first head
coaching stint began at Idaho
(1978-1980), where she got the
first of her now more than 800
career wins. VanDerveer was
only the fifth Division I
women's basketball head
coach to reach that milestone.
In her 34 years of coaching,
she has culled an overall
record of 894-203.
The success continued at
Ohio State (1980-1985), where
she coached the Buckeyes to
four Big-10 Championships
and twice received Big-10
Coach of the Year recognition.
But VanDerveer was al
ways primed for a challenge,
and when the coach received a
phone call from then-Stanford
Athletic Director Andy
Geiger, she considered leaving
Ohio to take a gamble coach
ing a Stanford team that her
Buckeyes had recently dis
mantled, 79-47.
♦ ♦♦
VanDerveer was ultimate
ly drawn to Stanford by the
rich tradition of academics
and athletics. As a three-year
Dean's List Scholar at Indi
ana, VanDerveer values edu
cation and saw this as a great
opportunity to create a model
of athletic and academic excel
lence.
The road to athletic excel
lence would not be easy,
though. VanDerveer inherited
a team that was coming off of
a poor 9-19 season in 1984.
She told Geiger that more ef
fort and money would have to
be put into the program in or
der to be competitive in the
long run.
"We just had to work real
ly hard to get the word out
about Stanford, VanDerveer
said. "We had a good group of
people on our team, but they
just needed to be surrounded
by more talent."
VanDerveer proved her
coaching prowess by turning
the program around in a short
period of time. The team fin
ished just 13-15 her first sea
son, but made its return to the
NCAA tournament in 1988. In
1990, she would build the best
team in the nation with a
record of 32-1.
By 1992, VanDerveer had
won the program's first two
national championship and
won National Coach of the
Year three times en route to
establishing Stanford as one
of the most successful pro

grams in women's basketball
history.
One of her most gratifying
basketball memories came at
this time. Prior to the pro
gram's first Final Four game
in 1990, Jennifer Azzi '9O, the
team's star player, wrote Van-
Derveer a note saying, "Tara,
this one is for you."
"I think that the thing that
is most rewarding is when I
talk to Jennifer, or I see Sonja
Henning, or I saw Val Whit
ing, or Kate Starbird, or for
mer players, I get a text from
Nneka [Ogwumike]," said
VanDerveer. "It's just so spe
cial how the relationship is,
that I'm 20 years removed
from some of these
people...and I meant some
thing to them."
Her impact didn't stop at
Stanford. VanDerveer was
asked to coach USA Women's
Basketball at the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.
She was influential in chang
ing the organization of USA
Women's Basketball by sug
gesting that the team be
formed sooner, so that it could
train and practice for a full
year, instead of just the weeks
leading up to competition.
From 1995-1996, VanDerveer
coached Team USA, including
Azzi, Lisa Leslie and Sheryl
Swoops, to an undefeated 60-0
record and an Olympic gold
medal. By taking women's
basketball seriously, Van-
Derveer made the world re
spect the sport.
VanDerveer admitted that
when she sat in her apartment
at Indiana joking with her
teammates about professional
women's basketball, never in
her wildest dreams did she
believe that their jokes would
become a reality. Yet that
same little girl—who played
with the neighborhood boys
and could only imagine play
ing in a packed arena saw
to it that women's basketball
could be more than just a
game.
♦ ♦♦
VanDerveer, along with
coaches like Geno Auriemma
of UConn and Pat Summitt of
Tennessee, has opened doors
for not only women's basket
ball players, but also other fe
male athletes around the na
tion with her consistent pur
suit of excellence and high
standards.
VanDerveer's younger sis
ter Heidi, the women's bas
ketball coach at UC-San
Diego, credits her sister for
leading the way in an area
where many would have been
unwilling to commit to
progress.
"Any time you've been in a
profession for that many
years, you must be doing
something right because oth
erwise you wouldn't make it,"
said Heidi VanDerveer. "She's
just been a kind of standard,
along with Pat Summit, Geno
[Auriemma]. Tara has really

set the stage for women's bas
ketball for the current gener
ation and I think for the next
generation as well."
At Stanford, VanDerveer
changed the culture of
women's athletics by attract
ing the brightest and best ath
letes in the nation to the Farm
to build a program of the high
est quality.
"When I was first a gradu
ate assistant [at Ohio State], I
had no money for anything.
My first full time job paid
$13,000 and I was ecstatic. We
didn't have strength coaches,
we didn't have full-time train
ers," VanDerveer explained.
"There's so much more sup
port for women's programs
now."
VanDerveer additionally
recognized the time commit
ment that maintaining a big
time program required.
Whether its watching film,
talking to coaches, meeting
with players, or talking to re
cruits, she puts effort into
every aspect of the team.
"I'm probably thinking
about [the team] all the time.
Even if I'm walking my dogs
I'm on my phone talking to a
coach or somebody," Van-
Derveer said. "I go home and
I watch video until 10 o'clock
at night. During the season,
it's pretty much every day, al
most all the time."
No matter how harsh a
coach VanDerveer may be on
the court, it's obvious that she
enjoys what she does. She has
dedicated her life to some
thing that she cares deeply
about and goes to any lengths
to see to it that she does her
job well.
Jeannette Pohlen 'll re
members that VanDerveer
prepared the team extremely
well for every game.
"Our practices before each
game, we would have teams
down to a T, we would know
their plays better than they
would," Pohlen said. "She
watches so much film and has
so much knowledge for the
game. It was an honor playing
for her."

Tara VanDerveer was able
to blaze a path for women's
athletics and adapt to the
ever-changing landscape of
women's basketball. She has
consistently recruited the top
players in the nation and won
two national titles early on in
her career at Stanford.
However, the national title
has been elusive since then.
She's brought success and
status to women's basketball
both nationally and interna
tionally, but a big question re
mains: will she win another
national championship? This
year, the season ended at the
Sweet 16, but with all players
except one returning, next
year could be the year.

a big fish in a little pond and
transferred to Indiana Uni
versity—where she was still
a big fish, but in a much big
ger pond.
VanDerveer immediately
thrived with her new team at
Indiana. She recalls several
occasions when she and her
teammates would fantasize
about the future of women's
basketball, but with only a
nine-game regular season, the
thought of any advancement
was far-fetched.
"We'd joke that there
would be a professional
women's league. They'd say
'Yeah, I'll be the general man
ager, and Tara, you'll be the
coach,"' VanDerveer recalled.
"It was just comical talking to
my teammates, because there
were no scholarships. I
worked in the kitchen to pay
for school."
After college, VanDerveer
planned on taking a year off
before attending law school
but money ran out and she
was back home by Christmas.
It was her father who unwit
tingly got the ball rolling on
her coaching career when he
suggested that VanDerveer
coach her sister Maine's high
school basketball team.
♦ ♦♦
Title IX was just starting
to take effect and more high
schools were adopting girl's
basketball programs. But giv
en that her sister's team had
just lost by a 99-11 score the
previous night, VanDerveer
was far from eager to devote
time to that team. However,
her dad convinced her to be a
volunteer coach and her life
long commitment to coaching
began.
"I felt I had a lot to offer
because I knew a lot about
basketball. I studied it all the
time. When I was at Indiana, I
watched every practice that

Bobby Knight had at Indiana
and I also took his coaching
class," VanDerveer said. "I
went to the clinic and it was
like 500 guys and I was the on
ly woman there, and I sat
right in front."
After coaching her sister's
team, VanDerveer got a grad
uate coaching position at Ohio
State, which included coach
ing the JV to an undefeated
season, and stayed there until
she completed her master's in
sports management and ad
ministration.
VanDerveer's first head
coaching stint began at Idaho
(1978-1980), where she got the
first of her now more than 800
career wins. VanDerveer was
only the fifth Division I
women's basketball head
coach to reach that milestone.
In her 34 years of coaching,
she has culled an overall
record of 894-203.
The success continued at
Ohio State (1980-1985), where
she coached the Buckeyes to
four Big-10 Championships
and twice received Big-10
Coach of the Year recognition.
But VanDerveer was al
ways primed for a challenge,
and when the coach received a
phone call from then-Stanford
Athletic Director Andy
Geiger, she considered leaving
Ohio to take a gamble coach
ing a Stanford team that her
Buckeyes had recently dis
mantled, 79-47.
♦ ♦♦
VanDerveer was ultimate
ly drawn to Stanford by the
rich tradition of academics
and athletics. As a three-year
Dean's List Scholar at Indi
ana, VanDerveer values edu
cation and saw this as a great
opportunity to create a model
of athletic and academic excel
lence.
The road to athletic excel
lence would not be easy,
though. VanDerveer inherited
a team that was coming off of
a poor 9-19 season in 1984.
She told Geiger that more ef
fort and money would have to
be put into the program in or
der to be competitive in the
long run.
"We just had to work real
ly hard to get the word out
about Stanford, VanDerveer
said. "We had a good group of
people on our team, but they
just needed to be surrounded
by more talent."
VanDerveer proved her
coaching prowess by turning
the program around in a short
period of time. The team fin
ished just 13-15 her first sea
son, but made its return to the
NCAA tournament in 1988. In
1990, she would build the best
team in the nation with a
record of 32-1.
By 1992, VanDerveer had
won the program's first two
national championship and
won National Coach of the
Year three times en route to
establishing Stanford as one
of the most successful pro

grams in women's basketball
history.
One of her most gratifying
basketball memories came at
this time. Prior to the pro
gram's first Final Four game
in 1990, Jennifer Azzi '9O, the
team's star player, wrote Van-
Derveer a note saying, "Tara,
this one is for you."
"I think that the thing that
is most rewarding is when I
talk to Jennifer, or I see Sonja
Henning, or I saw Val Whit
ing, or Kate Starbird, or for
mer players, I get a text from
Nneka [Ogwumike]," said
VanDerveer. "It's just so spe
cial how the relationship is,
that I'm 20 years removed
from some of these
people...and I meant some
thing to them."
Her impact didn't stop at
Stanford. VanDerveer was
asked to coach USA Women's
Basketball at the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.
She was influential in chang
ing the organization of USA
Women's Basketball by sug
gesting that the team be
formed sooner, so that it could
train and practice for a full
year, instead of just the weeks
leading up to competition.
From 1995-1996, VanDerveer
coached Team USA, including
Azzi, Lisa Leslie and Sheryl
Swoops, to an undefeated 60-0
record and an Olympic gold
medal. By taking women's
basketball seriously, Van-
Derveer made the world re
spect the sport.
VanDerveer admitted that
when she sat in her apartment
at Indiana joking with her
teammates about professional
women's basketball, never in
her wildest dreams did she
believe that their jokes would
become a reality. Yet that
same little girl—who played
with the neighborhood boys
and could only imagine play
ing in a packed arena saw
to it that women's basketball
could be more than just a
game.
♦ ♦♦
VanDerveer, along with
coaches like Geno Auriemma
of UConn and Pat Summitt of
Tennessee, has opened doors
for not only women's basket
ball players, but also other fe
male athletes around the na
tion with her consistent pur
suit of excellence and high
standards.
VanDerveer's younger sis
ter Heidi, the women's bas
ketball coach at UC-San
Diego, credits her sister for
leading the way in an area
where many would have been
unwilling to commit to
progress.
"Any time you've been in a
profession for that many
years, you must be doing
something right because oth
erwise you wouldn't make it,"
said Heidi VanDerveer. "She's
just been a kind of standard,
along with Pat Summit, Geno
[Auriemma]. Tara has really

set the stage for women's bas
ketball for the current gener
ation and I think for the next
generation as well."
At Stanford, VanDerveer
changed the culture of
women's athletics by attract
ing the brightest and best ath
letes in the nation to the Farm
to build a program of the high
est quality.
"When I was first a gradu
ate assistant [at Ohio State], I
had no money for anything.
My first full time job paid
$13,000 and I was ecstatic. We
didn't have strength coaches,
we didn't have full-time train
ers," VanDerveer explained.
"There's so much more sup
port for women's programs
now."
VanDerveer additionally
recognized the time commit
ment that maintaining a big
time program required.
Whether its watching film,
talking to coaches, meeting
with players, or talking to re
cruits, she puts effort into
every aspect of the team.
"I'm probably thinking
about [the team] all the time.
Even if I'm walking my dogs
I'm on my phone talking to a
coach or somebody," Van-
Derveer said. "I go home and
I watch video until 10 o'clock
at night. During the season,
it's pretty much every day, al
most all the time."
No matter how harsh a
coach VanDerveer may be on
the court, it's obvious that she
enjoys what she does. She has
dedicated her life to some
thing that she cares deeply
about and goes to any lengths
to see to it that she does her
job well.
Jeannette Pohlen 'll re
members that VanDerveer
prepared the team extremely
well for every game.
"Our practices before each
game, we would have teams
down to a T, we would know
their plays better than they
would," Pohlen said. "She
watches so much film and has
so much knowledge for the
game. It was an honor playing
for her."

Tara VanDerveer was able
to blaze a path for women's
athletics and adapt to the
ever-changing landscape of
women's basketball. She has
consistently recruited the top
players in the nation and won
two national titles early on in
her career at Stanford.
However, the national title
has been elusive since then.
She's brought success and
status to women's basketball
both nationally and interna
tionally, but a big question re
mains: will she win another
national championship? This
year, the season ended at the
Sweet 16, but with all players
except one returning, next
year could be the year.

B the gold-medal game,
I went into a small,
I room and I laid
down and I thought about being a
little kid and how I played out in the
neighborhood and how I would
imagine this big arena filled with
people, and I thought: 'I am living
my dream.'"
♦ ♦♦
Tara VanDerveer has not only
fulfilled her own dreams of playing
college basketball and of witnessing
women's basketball become a domi
nant sport in the athletic world, but
she is also the reason that so many
young women today have had that

same opportunity.
"Basketball has been an incredible
thing that you never could have imag-

ined. When I was in college, I never could have imagined
that this was what it would grow into," VanDerveer reflect
ed. "It's been a great life. I can't even imagine a better life."
Few basketball coaches, male or female, can boast the
coaching career and legacy that VanDerveer has created. In
her 27 seasons as head coach of Stanford's women's basket
ball team, the trailblazer in women's athletics has led the
Cardinal to a record of 742-152,25 NCAA Tournament ap
pearances, including two national championships (1990,
1992) and 10 final fours, 21 regular season conference titles,
and 10 Pac-12/Pac-10 tournament crowns.
Along the way, VanDerveer has received due recognition
for these accomplishments, many achieved at a time when
female athletes were not taken as seriously as their male

counterparts.
For the four-time National
Coach of the Year (1988-90,2011),
13-time Pac-12/Pac-10 Coach of
the Year and Naismith Basketball
Hall of Famer, though, modesty is
her policy. However, the impact
VanDerveer has had on the realm
of women's sports cannot be fully
comprehended without tracing
her struggles and triumphs.

'All the boys in the neighbor
hood always played [basketball]
together. So I just loved playing
[with them]. For some reason I
loved basketball I can't tell you
why, but I liked the strategy of it,"
explains VanDerveer. "It's so
physical and it's fast."
Playing with the boys wasn't
always an easy thing to break in
to, though. VanDerveer demon-

strated her determination and savvy early on when she
bought the best basketball possible, but told the boys they
could use it only if they let her play—and more often than

she took up cheerleading instead. Even when she trans

a team that was coming off of
a poor 9-19 season in 1984.
She told Geiger that more ef
fort and money would have to
be put into the program in or
der to be competitive in the
long run.
"We just had to work real
ly hard to get the word out
about Stanford, VanDerveer
said. "We had a good group of
people on our team, but they
just needed to be surrounded
by more talent."
VanDerveer proved her
coaching prowess by turning
the program around in a short
period of time. The team fin
ished just 13-15 her first sea
son, but made its return to the
NCAA tournament in 1988. In
1990, she would build the best
team in the nation with a
record of 32-1.
By 1992, VanDerveer had
won the program's first two
national championship and
won National Coach of the
Year three times en route to
establishing Stanford as one
of the most successful pro

grams in women's basketball
history.
One of her most gratifying
basketball memories came at
this time. Prior to the pro
gram's first Final Four game
in 1990, Jennifer Azzi '9O, the
team's star player, wrote Van-
Derveer a note saying, "Tara,
this one is for you."
"I think that the thing that
is most rewarding is when I
talk to Jennifer, or I see Sonja
Henning, or I saw Val Whit
ing, or Kate Starbird, or for
mer players, I get a text from
Nneka [Ogwumike]," said
VanDerveer. "It's just so spe
cial how the relationship is,
that I'm 20 years removed
from some of these
people...and I meant some
thing to them."
Her impact didn't stop at
Stanford. VanDerveer was
asked to coach USA Women's
Basketball at the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.
She was influential in chang
ing the organization of USA
Women's Basketball by sug
gesting that the team be
formed sooner, so that it could
train and practice for a full
year, instead of just the weeks
leading up to competition.
From 1995-1996, VanDerveer
coached Team USA, including
Azzi, Lisa Leslie and Sheryl
Swoops, to an undefeated 60-0
record and an Olympic gold
medal. By taking women's
basketball seriously, Van-
Derveer made the world re
spect the sport.
VanDerveer admitted that
when she sat in her apartment
at Indiana joking with her
teammates about professional
women's basketball, never in
her wildest dreams did she
believe that their jokes would
become a reality. Yet that
same little girl—who played
with the neighborhood boys
and could only imagine play
ing in a packed arena saw
to it that women's basketball
could be more than just a
game.
♦ ♦♦
VanDerveer, along with
coaches like Geno Auriemma
of UConn and Pat Summitt of
Tennessee, has opened doors
for not only women's basket
ball players, but also other fe
male athletes around the na
tion with her consistent pur
suit of excellence and high
standards.
VanDerveer's younger sis
ter Heidi, the women's bas
ketball coach at UC-San
Diego, credits her sister for
leading the way in an area
where many would have been
unwilling to commit to
progress.
"Any time you've been in a
profession for that many
years, you must be doing
something right because oth
erwise you wouldn't make it,"
said Heidi VanDerveer. "She's
just been a kind of standard,
along with Pat Summit, Geno
[Auriemma]. Tara has really

set the stage for women's bas
ketball for the current gener
ation and I think for the next
generation as well."
At Stanford, VanDerveer
changed the culture of
women's athletics by attract
ing the brightest and best ath
letes in the nation to the Farm
to build a program of the high
est quality.
"When I was first a gradu
ate assistant [at Ohio State], I
had no money for anything.
My first full time job paid
$13,000 and I was ecstatic. We
didn't have strength coaches,
we didn't have full-time train
ers," VanDerveer explained.
"There's so much more sup
port for women's programs
now."
VanDerveer additionally
recognized the time commit
ment that maintaining a big
time program required.
Whether its watching film,
talking to coaches, meeting
with players, or talking to re
cruits, she puts effort into
every aspect of the team.
"I'm probably thinking
about [the team] all the time.
Even if I'm walking my dogs
I'm on my phone talking to a
coach or somebody," Van-
Derveer said. "I go home and
I watch video until 10 o'clock
at night. During the season,
it's pretty much every day, al
most all the time."
No matter how harsh a
coach VanDerveer may be on
the court, it's obvious that she
enjoys what she does. She has
dedicated her life to some
thing that she cares deeply
about and goes to any lengths
to see to it that she does her
job well.
Jeannette Pohlen 'll re
members that VanDerveer
prepared the team extremely
well for every game.
"Our practices before each
game, we would have teams
down to a T, we would know
their plays better than they
would," Pohlen said. "She
watches so much film and has
so much knowledge for the
game. It was an honor playing
for her."

Tara VanDerveer was able
to blaze a path for women's
athletics and adapt to the
ever-changing landscape of
women's basketball. She has
consistently recruited the top
players in the nation and won
two national titles early on in
her career at Stanford.
However, the national title
has been elusive since then.
She's brought success and
status to women's basketball
both nationally and interna
tionally, but a big question re
mains: will she win another
national championship? This
year, the season ended at the
Sweet 16, but with all players
except one returning, next
year could be the year.

B the gold-medal game,
I went into a small,
I room and I laid
down and I thought about being a
little kid and how I played out in the
neighborhood and how I would
imagine this big arena filled with
people, and I thought: 'I am living
my dream.'"
♦ ♦♦
Tara VanDerveer has not only
fulfilled her own dreams of playing
college basketball and of witnessing
women's basketball become a domi
nant sport in the athletic world, but
she is also the reason that so many
young women today have had that

same opportunity.
"Basketball has been an incredible
thing that you never could have imag-

ined. When I was in college, I never could have imagined
that this was what it would grow into," VanDerveer reflect
ed. "It's been a great life. I can't even imagine a better life."
Few basketball coaches, male or female, can boast the
coaching career and legacy that VanDerveer has created. In
her 27 seasons as head coach of Stanford's women's basket
ball team, the trailblazer in women's athletics has led the
Cardinal to a record of 742-152,25 NCAA Tournament ap
pearances, including two national championships (1990,
1992) and 10 final fours, 21 regular season conference titles,
and 10 Pac-12/Pac-10 tournament crowns.
Along the way, VanDerveer has received due recognition
for these accomplishments, many achieved at a time when
female athletes were not taken as seriously as their male

counterparts.
For the four-time National
Coach of the Year (1988-90,2011),
13-time Pac-12/Pac-10 Coach of
the Year and Naismith Basketball
Hall of Famer, though, modesty is
her policy. However, the impact
VanDerveer has had on the realm
of women's sports cannot be fully
comprehended without tracing
her struggles and triumphs.

'All the boys in the neighbor
hood always played [basketball]
together. So I just loved playing
[with them]. For some reason I
loved basketball I can't tell you
why, but I liked the strategy of it,"
explains VanDerveer. "It's so
physical and it's fast."
Playing with the boys wasn't
always an easy thing to break in
to, though. VanDerveer demon-

strated her determination and savvy early on when she
bought the best basketball possible, but told the boys they
could use it only if they let her play—and more often than
not she got her way.
Her high school didn't have any female sports teams and
she took up cheerleading instead. Even when she trans
ferred to a private all-girls school, competition only consist
ed of "fun days" with different teams playing against each
other nothing like organized high school basketball to
day.
VanDerveer wasn't just satisfied with a taste of basket

mined to play in college.
'♦♦♦
"When I went to college I
played on a college team that
was like a Division 111 [Al
bany]," VanDerveer said.
"That's where I jumped cen
ter, I was the leading scorer,
the leading rebounder, leading
assist, leading turnover."
After a year, she realized
she wasn't satisfied with being
a big fish in a little pond and
transferred to Indiana Uni
versity—where she was still
a big fish, but in a much big
ger pond.
VanDerveer immediately
thrived with her new team at
Indiana. She recalls several
occasions when she and her
teammates would fantasize
about the future of women's
basketball, but with only a
nine-game regular season, the
thought of any advancement
was far-fetched.
"We'd joke that there
would be a professional
women's league. They'd say
'Yeah, I'll be the general man
ager, and Tara, you'll be the
coach,"' VanDerveer recalled.
"It was just comical talking to
my teammates, because there
were no scholarships. I
worked in the kitchen to pay
for school."
After college, VanDerveer
planned on taking a year off
before attending law school
but money ran out and she
was back home by Christmas.
It was her father who unwit
tingly got the ball rolling on
her coaching career when he
suggested that VanDerveer
coach her sister Maine's high
school basketball team.
♦ ♦♦
Title IX was just starting
to take effect and more high
schools were adopting girl's
basketball programs. But giv
en that her sister's team had
just lost by a 99-11 score the
previous night, VanDerveer
was far from eager to devote
time to that team. However,
her dad convinced her to be a
volunteer coach and her life
long commitment to coaching
began.
"I felt I had a lot to offer
because I knew a lot about
basketball. I studied it all the
time. When I was at Indiana, I
watched every practice that

Bobby Knight had at Indiana
and I also took his coaching
class," VanDerveer said. "I
went to the clinic and it was
like 500 guys and I was the on
ly woman there, and I sat
right in front."
After coaching her sister's
team, VanDerveer got a grad
uate coaching position at Ohio
State, which included coach
ing the JV to an undefeated
season, and stayed there until
she completed her master's in
sports management and ad
ministration.
VanDerveer's first head
coaching stint began at Idaho
(1978-1980), where she got the
first of her now more than 800
career wins. VanDerveer was
only the fifth Division I
women's basketball head
coach to reach that milestone.
In her 34 years of coaching,
she has culled an overall
record of 894-203.
The success continued at
Ohio State (1980-1985), where
she coached the Buckeyes to
four Big-10 Championships
and twice received Big-10
Coach of the Year recognition.
But VanDerveer was al
ways primed for a challenge,
and when the coach received a
phone call from then-Stanford
Athletic Director Andy
Geiger, she considered leaving
Ohio to take a gamble coach
ing a Stanford team that her
Buckeyes had recently dis
mantled, 79-47.
♦ ♦♦
VanDerveer was ultimate
ly drawn to Stanford by the
rich tradition of academics
and athletics. As a three-year
Dean's List Scholar at Indi
ana, VanDerveer values edu
cation and saw this as a great
opportunity to create a model
of athletic and academic excel
lence.
The road to athletic excel
lence would not be easy,
though. VanDerveer inherited
a team that was coming off of
a poor 9-19 season in 1984.

"Any time you've been in a
profession for that many
years, you must be doing
something right because oth
erwise you wouldn't make it,"
said Heidi VanDerveer. "She's
just been a kind of standard,
along with Pat Summit, Geno
[Auriemma]. Tara has really

set the stage for women's bas
ketball for the current gener
ation and I think for the next
generation as well."
At Stanford, VanDerveer
changed the culture of
women's athletics by attract
ing the brightest and best ath
letes in the nation to the Farm
to build a program of the high
est quality.
"When I was first a gradu
ate assistant [at Ohio State], I
had no money for anything.
My first full time job paid
$13,000 and I was ecstatic. We
didn't have strength coaches,
we didn't have full-time train
ers," VanDerveer explained.
"There's so much more sup
port for women's programs
now."
VanDerveer additionally
recognized the time commit
ment that maintaining a big
time program required.
Whether its watching film,
talking to coaches, meeting
with players, or talking to re
cruits, she puts effort into
every aspect of the team.
"I'm probably thinking
about [the team] all the time.
Even if I'm walking my dogs
I'm on my phone talking to a
coach or somebody," Van-
Derveer said. "I go home and
I watch video until 10 o'clock
at night. During the season,
it's pretty much every day, al
most all the time."
No matter how harsh a
coach VanDerveer may be on
the court, it's obvious that she
enjoys what she does. She has
dedicated her life to some
thing that she cares deeply
about and goes to any lengths
to see to it that she does her
job well.
Jeannette Pohlen 'll re
members that VanDerveer
prepared the team extremely
well for every game.
"Our practices before each
game, we would have teams
down to a T, we would know
their plays better than they
would," Pohlen said. "She
watches so much film and has
so much knowledge for the
game. It was an honor playing
for her."

Tara VanDerveer was able
to blaze a path for women's
athletics and adapt to the
ever-changing landscape of
women's basketball. She has
consistently recruited the top
players in the nation and won
two national titles early on in
her career at Stanford.
However, the national title
has been elusive since then.
She's brought success and
status to women's basketball
both nationally and interna
tionally, but a big question re
mains: will she win another
national championship? This
year, the season ended at the
Sweet 16, but with all players
except one returning, next
year could be the year.
