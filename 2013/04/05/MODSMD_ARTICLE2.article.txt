B the gold-medal game,
I went into a small,
I room and I laid
down and I thought about being a
little kid and how I played out in the
neighborhood and how I would
imagine this big arena filled with
people, and I thought: 'I am living
my dream.'"

Tara VanDerveer has not only
fulfilled her own dreams of playing
college basketball and of witnessing
women's basketball become a domi
nant sport in the athletic world, but
she is also the reason that so many
young women today have had that

same opportunity.
"Basketball has been an incredible
thing that you never could have imag-

ined. When I was in college, I never could have imagined
that this was what it would grow into," VanDerveer reflect
ed. "It's been a great life. I can't even imagine a better life."
Few basketball coaches, male or female, can boast the
coaching career and legacy that VanDerveer has created. In
her 27 seasons as head coach of Stanford's women's basket
ball team, the trailblazer in women's athletics has led the
Cardinal to a record of 742-152,25 NCAA Tournament ap
pearances, including two national championships (1990,
1992) and 10 final fours, 21 regular season conference titles,
and 10 Pac-12/Pac-10 tournament crowns.
Along the way, VanDerveer has received due recognition
for these accomplishments, many achieved at a time when
female athletes were not taken as seriously as their male

counterparts.
For the four-time National
Coach of the Year (1988-90,2011),
13-time Pac-12/Pac-10 Coach of
the Year and Naismith Basketball
Hall of Famer, though, modesty is
her policy. However, the impact
VanDerveer has had on the realm
of women's sports cannot be fully
comprehended without tracing
her struggles and triumphs.

'All the boys in the neighbor
hood always played [basketball]
together. So I just loved playing
[with them]. For some reason I
loved basketball I can't tell you
why, but I liked the strategy of it,"
explains VanDerveer. "It's so
physical and it's fast."
Playing with the boys wasn't
always an easy thing to break in
to, though. VanDerveer demon-

strated her determination and savvy early on when she
bought the best basketball possible, but told the boys they
could use it only if they let her play—and more often than
not she got her way.
Her high school didn't have any female sports teams and
she took up cheerleading instead. Even when she trans
ferred to a private all-girls school, competition only consist
ed of "fun days" with different teams playing against each
other nothing like organized high school basketball to
day.
VanDerveer wasn't just satisfied with a taste of basket
ball in her life, she wanted the whole thing and was deter-
