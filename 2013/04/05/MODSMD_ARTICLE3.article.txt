## 'Center' of Chicano community dies at 67 
### I LEAN A NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Cecilia Preciado Burciaga, an advocate,
mentor and friend to generations of Chi
cano and Latino students at Stanford,
passed away at age 67 last week at Stanford
Hospital, having battled lung cancer since
August.
Burciaga held various positions through
