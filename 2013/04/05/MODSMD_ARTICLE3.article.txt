## 'Center' of Chicano community dies at 67 
### I LEAN A NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Cecilia Preciado Burciaga, an advocate,
mentor and friend to generations of Chi
cano and Latino students at Stanford,
passed away at age 67 last week at Stanford
Hospital, having battled lung cancer since
August.
Burciaga held various positions through
more than 20 years on the Farm, initially ar
riving in 1974 as assistant to the president
and provost for Chicano affairs under Pres
ident Richard W Lyman.
Throughout her time at Stanford, Burci
aga made a name for herself as a conduit for
the voice of Chicano and Latino faculty, staff

and students. She played a role in the hir
ing of early Chicano and Latino faculty
members, the expansion of graduate stu
dent programming, and the integration of
Chicano and Latino undergraduates into
the Stanford community
"She was really the center of our com
munity," said Albert Camarillo, professor of
history, who arrived at Stanford shortly af
ter Burciaga.
Burciaga impacted campus life up to and
after a tumultuous tiring from her position
as associate dean and development officer
for student resources in early 1994 by then-
Provost Condoleezza Rice, as administra
tive positions were cut as part of University
budget cuts.

Alma Medina '92 J.D. '95, who said that
she looked up to Burciaga as a mentor and
close friend, described her firing as devas
tating to Stanford's Chicano and Latino
community.
"It came at a time when we felt as a com
munity that we were under attack," Medina
said.
Burciaga's firing resulted in a four-or
five-day hunger strike during Cinco de
Mayo that year by Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA) students de
manding her reinstatement.
Medina, who served as a negotiator for
the hunger strike, said that Burciaga did
not want the students to suffer for her
but instead encouraged them to ad
vance the creation of a Chicano stud
ies major.
As Casa Zapata resident fellows
(RFs) Chris Gonzalez Clarke 'B5 MA
'O6 MA. 'lO PH.D. 'l3 and Gina Her
nandez 'BB recall, Burciaga strongly
supported an influential student
voice, prompting students to take ac
tions on issues they cared about but
only after critically assessing what
they believed in and considering the
broader impact of their actions.
"I really thought of her as an ac
tivist who was an administrator,"
Gonzalez Clarke said.
The hunger strike ultimately
proved fruitful, prompting the Uni
versity's formation of a committee
that eventually created the depart
ment of Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity.
Though Burciaga's legacy at Stan
ford revolves around her advocacy for
the rights of the Chicano and Latino
community a passion she contin
ued to pursue after she left Stanford
to become a founding dean of Califor
nia State University-Monterey Bay
she also left behind a more person
al legacy, serving with her husband
Tony as Casa Zapata resident fellow
for 10 years.
Camarillo described her in this
role as the "absent parent and family
for literally hundreds of Latino stu
dents that went through the corridors
of Casa Zapata."
Donnovan Somera Yisrael 'B9
MA '9O, manager of relationship and
sexual health programs at Vaden
Health Center, lived in the Chicano
and Latino-themed dorm his fresh
man year the first year the Burcia
gas served as RFs and worked as
a resident assistant while co-terming.

Yisrael spoke of the Burciagas' trans
formation of the dorm from a precon
ceived notion of militant Chicanos to
an inclusive community.
For instance, although Hernandez
did not live in Casa Zapata while a
student at Stanford, Burciaga knew
of her family. When Hernandez's par
ents arrived to visit her, Burciaga al
lowed them to stay at her house in
Menlo Park, taking them in as family.
"I didn't expect that from anyone
else at Stanford and hadn't been of
fered that from anybody else at Stan
ford before or since," Hernandez
said.
Medina, who lived in Casa Zapata
throughout her undergraduate ca
reer, said that Burciaga played a sig
nificant role in guiding Medina's con
tributions back to her community, en
couraging her to make the most of
Stanford rather than returning pre
maturely to a neighborhood in South
Central Los Angeles plagued by gang
violence.
Medina also noted that several
other students and even faculty
would have left Stanford prematurely
had it not been for Burciaga's atten
tiveness and ability to induce a sense
of belonging.
"The retention, the inspiration
and the love that she gave to the stu
dents, I think that's her biggest lega
cy," Medina said.
In an effort coordinated by Victor
Madrigal '95, co-chair of La Raza
Staff Association, alumni and staff
members hope to meet in the next
few weeks to discuss a memorial to
Burciaga beyond an official service
scheduled for April 13 at the San Car
los Borremeo de Carmelo Mission in
Carmelo.
Burciaga is survived by her chil
dren, Rebeca Burciaga and Jose An
tonio Burciaga Jr.; two grandchil
dren; sister Rose Preciado; and
brother Ralph Preciado.
