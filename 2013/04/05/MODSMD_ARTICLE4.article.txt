# Student voices limited on committees
## ASSU Exec candidates push for more accountable representation 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This article is the second in a two-part series
looking at University committees and students'
role therein. Yesterday's article looks at commit
tees'role and structure, while today's piece looks at
the committees'limitations to date.
According to a Faculty Senate report, the University's
system of committees provides "the best place for effective
student participation in the governance of the University."
While students can serve on more than 40 committees in
total, dealing with issues as varied as investment responsi
bility and laboratory animal care, their influence is often in
consistent and incomplete.
Application process
Last spring, outgoing ASSU President Michael Cruz
'l2 and Vice President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3
failed to appoint members to the Nominations Commission
(NomCom) before their term expired. This deferral of re
sponsibility has been attributed largely to the Executive's
belief that a revised ASSU Constitution, which included a
reform of the committee-nominating process, would be
passed.
Under the proposed Constitution, NomCom would be
replaced with a new "Joint Nominating Committee" to be
comprised exclusively of elected ASSU representatives.
The new committee would be accountable for filling all Uni
versity committee positions for the upcoming year by the
end of winter quarter.
When the Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Stu
dent Council rejected the proposed constitution, however,
the ASSU was left without any mechanism for nominating
students to committees for the following year.
Upon taking office, the incoming ASSU Executive
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 M.A. 'l3 and William Wagstaff 'l2
M.A. 'l3 opted to push for the formation of an interim
commission to ensure that these committee spots would
not be left vacant. In the end, this interim commission was
only able to nominate student representatives to 85 per
cent of the committee positions, according to Zimbroff.
In the eyes of administrators, this incident underscored
what had already been a noticeable trend: the failure of the
ASSU to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner.
"The last three to five years, the ASSU has been late
every year," said Nanci Howe, director of Student Activi
ties and Leadership (SAL), at an Undergraduate Senate
meeting last May when the issue first arose. "Particularly
the Board of Trustees and the Faculty Senate [are] quite
unhappy with the performance of the ASSU... I worry
about the credibility of the ASSU as an organization."
Howe maintained her stance when interviewed for this
article. She claimed that the student voice is negatively im
pacted when committee members are not appointed on
time, especially since this lateness prevents student repre
sentatives from receiving proper training before starting
their terms.
"We want to give people on the committees an orienta
tion before they start serving, and in recent years, we
haven't had the opportunity to do that," Howe said. "I used
to do an orientation in the third or fourth week of May, but
