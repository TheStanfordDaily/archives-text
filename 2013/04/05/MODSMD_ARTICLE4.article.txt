# Student voices limited on committees
## ASSU Exec candidates push for more accountable representation 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This article is the second in a two-part series
looking at University committees and students'
role therein. Yesterday's article looks at commit
tees'role and structure, while today's piece looks at
the committees'limitations to date.
According to a Faculty Senate report, the University's
system of committees provides "the best place for effective
student participation in the governance of the University."
While students can serve on more than 40 committees in
total, dealing with issues as varied as investment responsi
bility and laboratory animal care, their influence is often in
consistent and incomplete.
Application process
Last spring, outgoing ASSU President Michael Cruz
'l2 and Vice President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3
failed to appoint members to the Nominations Commission
(NomCom) before their term expired. This deferral of re
sponsibility has been attributed largely to the Executive's
belief that a revised ASSU Constitution, which included a
reform of the committee-nominating process, would be
passed.
Under the proposed Constitution, NomCom would be
replaced with a new "Joint Nominating Committee" to be
comprised exclusively of elected ASSU representatives.
The new committee would be accountable for filling all Uni
versity committee positions for the upcoming year by the
end of winter quarter.
When the Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Stu
dent Council rejected the proposed constitution, however,
the ASSU was left without any mechanism for nominating
students to committees for the following year.
Upon taking office, the incoming ASSU Executive
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 M.A. 'l3 and William Wagstaff 'l2
M.A. 'l3 opted to push for the formation of an interim
commission to ensure that these committee spots would
not be left vacant. In the end, this interim commission was
only able to nominate student representatives to 85 per
cent of the committee positions, according to Zimbroff.
In the eyes of administrators, this incident underscored
what had already been a noticeable trend: the failure of the
ASSU to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner.
"The last three to five years, the ASSU has been late
every year," said Nanci Howe, director of Student Activi
ties and Leadership (SAL), at an Undergraduate Senate
meeting last May when the issue first arose. "Particularly
the Board of Trustees and the Faculty Senate [are] quite
unhappy with the performance of the ASSU... I worry
about the credibility of the ASSU as an organization."
Howe maintained her stance when interviewed for this
article. She claimed that the student voice is negatively im
pacted when committee members are not appointed on
time, especially since this lateness prevents student repre
sentatives from receiving proper training before starting
their terms.
"We want to give people on the committees an orienta
tion before they start serving, and in recent years, we
haven't had the opportunity to do that," Howe said. "I used
to do an orientation in the third or fourth week of May, but
I have not had it in the last three to
four years because the ASSU is
never ready with a membership
vote."
"The general practice has been
if you don't appoint people by June
1, or hopefully earlier, then any of
the orientations that committees try
to do for the new members with the
old members still there don't hap
pen," she added. "So it's important
not just to select them, but to select
them before the end of the year."
Other University administrators
confirmed that they have experi
enced problems with the ASSU sub
mitting their nominees on time in
past years. They were reluctant,
however, to blame NomCom as an
organization, instead attributing the
lateness to a difference between the
student and administrative culture.
"There was one year when that
happened, but overall, most of the
time NomCom has been able to pro
vide us with everything we ask for,"
said Ralph Castro, director of the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Educa
tion (OAPE), who serves on the Al
cohol Advisory Board Committee.
"I know a lot of students are very
busy and doing different things,
and that can prove challenging."
"You know, the rhythms of the
administration are different than
those of students," agreed Jeff
Wachtel, special assistant to the
president. "For us, who have been
doing it for a while, we know exact
ly what the cycle is. NomCom may
have new members, and they may
not necessarily understand what
the cycle is for doing this."
While Wachtel said the Nom-
Com process works "reasonably
well" overall, he noted that the sys
tem sometimes fails when the need
arises throughout the year for stu
dents to serve on ad hoc commit
tees or panels. He said even with
sufficient lead-time, NomCom
sometimes struggles to fill these
positions by administrators' pre
ferred deadlines, in part because of
the University's desire for a specif
ic type of student.
Zimbroff, however, maintained
that his administration has been
vigilant about filling all positions
that give students a voice in admin
istrative-level decisions.
"That's one of the things that we
take a lot of pride in... making sure
that there is not a vacancy where
students could be," Zimbroff said.
"We try to get it done, and we try to
be really organized about it."

Training
Both students and administra
tors agreed that student committee
members could benefit from some
form of orientation or training be
fore the start of their terms. With
the exception of Board of Trustees
committees and the Judicial Panel
Pool, there is no formal training
mechanism when students are first
appointed to serve on committees.
When asked about the training
students receive for presidential
committees, Wachtel responded,
"Not much."
"All committees are staffed by
somebody, so hopefully they will get
an orientation from that staff per
son, but I couldn't tell you," he
added. "There isn't a uniform
method of training to get people
prepared. It would be something
worth considering... I think some
thing we can do better is maybe
working with the ASSU, making
sure that we're doing consistent ori
entation."
Chinyere Nwabugwu M.S. 'lO
Ph.D. 'l6, a graduate student in
electrical engineering, has served
on four different committees during
her time at Stanford: the Regis
trar's Student Advisory Group, the
Career Advisory Board, the Judi
cial Panel Pool and the Committee
on Graduate Studies. Nwabugwu
said that, while she learned over
time how to make her voice effec
tive in these venues, it would have
been helpful to receive training at
the beginning.
"Quite honestly, I think that's an
area of improvement," she said.
"Judicial Panel had very good train
ing for the panelists, but that's the
only committee that I've gotten
trained for. The others ones were
kind of, 'jump in, look around, and
watch what other people are do
ing.'"
Charles Mbatia 'l3, who has
served on the Registrar's Student
Advisory Group and the Committee
on Academic Computing and Infor
mation Systems, agreed with this
assessment.
"There should be some sort of
training that we offer for students
who interested in serving," he said.
"Knowing what your powers are
and what your limitations are would
have been useful."
Current committee members
said this lack of training makes it
difficult to advocate effectively for
the student body. Oftentimes, stu
dents might not be well-versed
enough to know where their peers
stand on a certain issue or might
not know enough about the me
chanics of the committee to make a
case for this student perspective

successfully. The issue is also re
newed each year as committee
memberships turn over.
Brianna Pang 'l3, a member of
the Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility and Licensing
(APIRL), said she feels the quality
of her input has increased over the
course of the year as she has be
come more familiar with the com
mittees and the issues they ad
dress. She asserted that the Nom-
Com should play a greater role in
providing some sort of institutional
ized memory to ensure that previ
ous work students have made in the
committees is not lost each year
during the transition.
The desire to provide student
committee members more training
was part of the reason why the AS
SU appointed members to Nom-
Com earlier this year, according to
Zimbroff. He said the recruiting
process this year aims to find the
best students, but also to give these
students an ample amount of time
to prepare for next year.
"That's why we are trying to
have our bill submitted well ahead
of the deadline for the absolute lat
est date that we can do it, so that
[committee members] can get any
training, reading materials, etc.,"
Zimbroff said. "If they need to read
the SUES [Study of Undergradu
ate Education at Stanford] report
in order to understand what they
are going to be talking about on,
say, the Breadth Governance board,
then yeah, they should have some
time to be able to do that."
Zimbroff said his hope moving
forward is that the ASSU Execu
tive will make sure to appoint all
members of NomCom by the begin
ning of winter quarter. The ASSU
Joint By-Laws actually states that
the ASSU President must submit
their nominations of students to
serve on NomCom "no longer later
than the end of Autumn Quarter,"
and subsequently, that the Nom-
Com chair must present a timeline
for filling all University committees
to the two ASSU Legislative
branches "before the middle of
Winter Quarter."
York confirmed that NomCom
would be working with Howe this
year in order to hold a general ori
entation in May after all committee
appointments have been made.
Attendance
Once appointed, student com
mittee members currently have no
means of enforcing accountability
to the peers that they have been ap
pointed to represent.
The ASSU Joint By-Laws do
state that "the President shall meet
with the Association representa

tives on University committees,
along with interested members of
the Association legislative bodies,
on a periodic basis to discuss and
route issues and action items."
In the past, however, these
meetings have not always hap
pened, producing a lack of account
ability perhaps evidenced best by
poor student attendance at commit
tee meetings.
"That's an issue, where students
don't show up for meetings," Wach
tel said. "You can't participate if you
don't show up, and you can't have
meaningful participation if you
don't prepare. Some of the commit
tees only meet once a quarter, so if
you miss the first meeting, then you
are just behind."
The Alcohol Advisory Board
Committee has also experienced
times where student members
missed meetings, according to Cas
tro. While there is usually full atten
dance when the committee takes up
an important issue, he added that,
when more routine items are being
discussed, attendance can drop as
low as one student out of seven.
Zimbroff acknowledged that
this poor attendance is a problem,
especially at a time when students
increasingly demand that adminis
trators involve them in policy deci
sions.
"These student representatives
are some of the most important jobs
that students can have on campus,"
he said. "You know, the argument
loses credibility if students say, 'We
need to have more voice in the ad
ministration,' and then administra
tors go to meetings where students
should be, and [the students] don't
show up."
"We need students in those
spots," he added. "We need stu
dents who are going to show up all
year even when the meetings are
boring or too detailed or whatever.
We need to make sure that they are
there."
Student participation may be
partially handicapped by commit
tee-meeting scheduling, with some
meetings such as those of the
Registrar's Student Advisory
Group scheduled at 9 a.m.
Mbatia recommended that the
administration consider moving
these meetings to a time that is
more convenient for students. If
this wasn't possible, he said that
NomCom should clearly advertise
the times that these committees
convene during the recruiting
process in order to find students
who would be prepared for these
early meeting times.
Other committees have been
more accommodating to students'
schedules. The Alcohol Advisory

Committee, for instance, often con
ducts votes through an online
polling system, which allows stu
dents to participate even when they
cannot physically attend a meeting.
Board of Trustees committees often
have a call-in option, according to
Pang, that has allowed her to partic
ipate in a meeting even when she
was off-campus.
Alex Kindel 'l4 said that involv
ing students in the planning process
might also be away to resolve this
problem. As a member of the Un
dergraduate Housing Advisory
Committee, he said he has been
able to push for meetings to be
scheduled on Friday afternoons,
where students would be less likely
to have class and less likely to be
stressed about having to show up.
Communication
When University Registrar Tom
Black proposed an overhaul of
course scheduling, which would
have started some classes as early
as 8:30 a.m. and prohibited enroll
ment in overlapping courses with
out a waiver, he approached an advi
sory committee of 12 students ap
pointed by NomCom. While these
committee members did not see the
proposal as something that would
meet much resistance, students
quickly mobilized after The Daily
ran an article in March about the
proposed changes.
A petition on the ASSU Under
graduate Senate website, calling
for the proposal to be "retracted
immediately," has gathered 1,789
student signatures to date. The
Faculty Senate has since delayed a
vote on the proposal until May,
which means the changes, if ap
proved, would not go into effect un
til the 2014-15 academic year.
The incident has called into
question the amount of communi
cation between committee mem
bers and the students they have
been appointed to represent.
While he did not participate in
discussions about the proposed
changes, Mbatia, who has previ
ously served on the Registrar's
Student Advisory Group, said he is
not surprised that the proposal
met very little opposition from stu
dent committee members. He said
that since the proposal would only
change class times by 30 minutes,
it would probably not have proven
very divisive.
He argued that the proposal
struck a nerve with students pri
marily because of its timing.
"When the issue came up, it was
the same time that students were
in conflict with the University over
Suites and other things," Mbatia
said. "Maybe that set up [the idea
that] the administrators weren't
really listening to students. But I
honestly don't think it's that big of
a deal. I honestly just think that
it's the timing."
Zimbroff said he believes ad
ministrators have respected stu
dent feedback during the recent
controversy over the scheduling
changes, citing Vice Provost of Un
dergraduate Education Harry
Elam's willingness to talk with stu
dents about the proposal since it
has become a large issue amongst
undergraduates.
"You have to take a step back to
see what are all the factors that go
into any decisions, and usually,
they are a lot more complicated
than the way that they got made,"
Zimbroff said. "I haven't done all
the homework on how they came to
the 8:30 decision, but I trust that
there were students given solid in
put into what the pros and cons
were to starting at 8:30 a.m."
York said that he has "a lot of
faith" in students who serve on
committees.
"We appoint people to commit
tees because of the experience and
background that they bring," he
said. "So we're not asking people to
go out and poll the student body,
and report on that. That's not what
it entails."
He added, however, that he
hopes that this incident galvanized
a broader and more diverse group
of students to apply on the commit
tees this year.
Executive slates
Both slates running for the AS
SU Executive said they would make
a conscious effort to ensure more
communication between committee
members and the student body if
elected.
"They clearly did not reach out
[to students]," said Elizabeth Pati
no 'l4, a vice-presidential candidate,
about committee members failing
to anticipate the student response
the scheduling proposal ended up
generating. "As soon as people
heard about it, there were a thou
sand signatures within a week."
Patino, along with her running
mate Najla Gomez 'l4, said they
would require all committee mem
bers to submit a quarterly report
or agree to a quarterly meeting
if they are elected next week.
"That's where we come in,"
Gomez said. "These students are
our ambassadors, and we can ask

them to report to us. Not only that,
but if they refuse to meet with us,
then we can reappoint them. Yeah,
we have to go through NomCom,
but we have this power to say, 'Hey,
you didn't submit a quarterly re
port. You should reconsider your
position on this committee.'"
"If you are not committed, and if
you are not actively pursuing the de
mands of the student body, then why
are we allowing you to serve on this
committee, and basically allowing
this position to go waste?" she added.
Currently, in order for a student
to be removed from a committee,
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council
must both agree, by a two-thirds
vote, that a representative is not
"regularly attend[ing] meetings of
her/his committees" or "otherwise
fulfilling] her/his obligations to
her/his committee," according to
the ASSU Constitution. In addition,
this can only go to a vote "after the
Nominations Commission recom
mends her/his removal."
Despite the potential difficulty
in actually removing student repre
sentatives, Patino and Gomez said
they hoped these routine check-ups
would make committee members
more accountable to the student
body, as well as allow the ASSU Ex
ecutive to provide more support to
students serving on committees.
They also disagreed with York's
assertion that student representa
tive should make decisions based on
their own experience and knowl
edge instead of gathering feedback
from peers across the campus.
"I don't think this expertise can
be teased out in an application that
has to be done in a really short
amount of time about a relatively
low amount of people," Gomez said.
"For you to say that this person is an
expert, and therefore, we should on
ly listen to them... I don't think so."
Dan Ashton 'l4, who is running

with Billy Gallagher 'l4, also ar
gued that the ASSU Executive
needs to play a greater role facili
tating conversations between com
mittee members and the student
body. He added that this is especial
ly important when issues deal with
academics and residential life, two
areas he said affect students "in
very tangible ways."
Gallagher is a Daily staffer. Ash
ton is a member of The Daily's
Board of Directors.
"Just the fact that we have the
committees show that administra
tion is willing to listen to students
and take actually student voice se
riously," Ashton said. "I think [the
committees] are relatively effec
tive, but when it comes to larger
scale issues, I think there are cases
where the greater student body
should be consulted as well. Be
cause you can't expect a few stu
dents to speak for everybody on
campus."
To accomplish this, Ashton said
he and Gallagher would also man
date that committee members
meet with the ASSU regularly. He
referred to the process right now
as a "one-way street," where the
ASSU legislature either confirms
or rejects the nominees put forth
by NomCom with little subsequent
discussion.
"Basically, right now, once some
one is appointed, there's no other
interaction that they are required
to have with the student body or the
elected student leaders," Ashton
said. "I have never seen the ASSU
[reach out] to students once they
are on committees. That outreach
has to come from the ASSU Execu
tive or it won't happen," he added.
In order for students to be suc
cessful on committees, Ashton said
that students must draw from both
their own expertise and from feed
back collected from other students.
"Speaking from being a part of

the Committee on Finance, it's so
complicated, and it would take
years for even committee members
to understand," he said. "It's defi
nitely difficult to solicit student
feedback on issues when it's so com
plicated."
Types of committees
There is no formal standing
committee focused on Residential
Education (ResEd), the University
office responsible for some particu
larly controversial recent decisions.
These include the decisions to re
voke the lease of Chi Theta Chi last
February and to contract the oper
ations of Suites Dining to an outside
vendor this January.
The closest committee to dealing
with these issues is the Undergrad
uate Housing Advisory Committee,
which Kindel said occasionally will
meet with ResEd administrators to
discuss initiatives. Still, he added
that these issues have not been ad
dressed within the committee,
which has been more focused on
housing renovations.
"I wouldn't say that the commit
tee necessarily talks about things
that are current issues," Kindel
said. "It's more like future plan
ning, so those sort of things we
haven't necessarily talked about."
"The goal of the committee is to
give undergraduate students the
opportunity to raise issues, give in
put on these issues and propose rec
ommendations regarding: housing
operations and policies; housing as
signments and policies; residential
programs; quality of life issues; and
to serve as a source for staff mem
bers," reads NomCom's description
of the Undergraduate Housing Ad
visory Committee.
Kindel said that while this com
mittee generally works well as a
mechanism for gathering student
input and advice, serving on the
committee is "not a position with
much say." He cited the fact that
Student Housing and ResEd often
have a longer timeline for imple
menting changes, which makes it
difficult for students to see what im
pact their feedback ends up having.
"One example of this is the reno
vations that are happening to some
of the Row houses," he said. "A lot
of the feedback that those renova
tions are based on was gathered
five years ago, so there's a lot of ...
lag time between the feedback and
implementation phase I would say."
He said some of the recent stu
dent frustration with Student Hous
ing might stem from the fact that
students and administrations oper
ate under different time frames.
"In a given year, if something in
the house doesn't work, they [ad
ministrators] will prioritize fixing
that," Kindel said. "But then, a cou

pie of years down the line maybe,
different students might think that
that system works pretty well. So
what changes get institutionalized is
very dependent on continual year
to-year feedback."
Kindel admitted that this is not
ideal, and puts the burden on stu
dents to keep some sort of sustained
records or institutionalized memory,
so they will know what has been dis
cussed in these committees in previ
ous years.
Making this committee more in
fluential in setting policy would re
quire the attendance of high-level
administrators, according to Kindel,
which may be improbable.
'At these meetings, the heads of
ResEd and Housing are pretty
rarely in attendance because they
have pretty busy schedules I would
imagine," he said. "I think to be able
to make those sort of decisions you
would need to have higher-up peo
ple there."
Zimbroff said that while there
might not be a formal University
committee for ResEd, administra
tors have been open to meeting with
students informally, especially in the
aftermath of the recent student dis
content over Suites Dining.
"I don't know if there's a stand
ing committee to talk with them,"
Zimbroff said. "In the interim, we
were trying to be effective commu
nicators, advocating that we believe
that students should have a student
run, student-operated Dining Socie
ty, which shouldn't get contracted
out to a third-party vendor when it
could be a valuable educational ex
perience."
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3, a
Daily staffer credited for helping
such issues gain traction among the
student body after wilting a long
form article about the end of Suites
Dining's student management, has
tracked the progress of these dis
cussions through a series of Daily
opinion pieces, recently calling on
going talks "very promising."
According to Unterreiner, one
goal going into these conversations
was to "establish a student advisory
panel within ResEd that has real
power and represents student inter
ests as a permanent nexus point be
tween students and Res Ed."
Howe said that these recent is
sues might prompt students and ad
ministrators to look at whether
committees are fulfilling their in
tended purpose.
"Maybe, it's the time to look at
what the landscape should be for
committees," she said, "because I
think a lot of people support these
enterprises and take student opin
ion really seriously."

Linda A. Cicero/Stanford News Service
Reagan Thompson '12 addresses the Faculty Senate in Feb. 2012 as
the at-large student representative to the body. Some students have
complained that students lack input into various University decisions.
