# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Senate structure impedes action 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A year after the current ASSU Undergraduate
Senators promised significant reforms including
improving the academic advising program, increasing
faculty diversity, instituting a need-blind financial aid
program for international students and creating
weekly video updates about Senate business none
have been successfully implemented.
According to current and former senators, that
lack of progress is merely symptomatic of broader is
sues including almost-complete annual turnover, a
lack of upperclassmen representation and structural
limitations that have annually hamstrung the Sen
ate's initiatives and blocked senators' efforts to signif
icantly improve student life.
Lack of upperclassmen voices
The current Senate is composed of 11 sophomores
and two juniors, a distribution similar to that of previ
ous years. The 2011-2012 Senate had 11 sophomores,
two juniors and two seniors, while the 2010-2011 Sen
ate had 12 sophomores and three juniors.
Former senator Shawn Dye 'l4 asserted that the
Senate's youthful composition is hardly ideal. Though
Dye served as a Senate Associate
during his freshman year, he said
that this experience failed to provide
him with enough insight into the role
of the Senate on campus.
"Most of the [freshman candi
dates] don't really know anything
about what the Senate does and what
the ASSU does in general," Dye
said. "They're thrown into this field
where they have no clue what they're
doing besides the two-week crash
course of training after they get
elected."
According to Dye, underclass
men senators sometimes realize that
they would rather pursue other stu
dent groups or activities while still in
office, a problem that Dye believes
would be less prevalent among up
perclassmen who have already had
time to explore other options.
"[Sophomore senators] are
thrown into this pit, and sometimes
they realize the ASSU is not the av
enue for the change they want to see
on campus," Dye said. "Upperclass
men will bring a better sense of in
stitutional knowledge and a more
colorful repertoire of their Stanford
experience than freshmen."
Though ASSU Assistant Finan
cial Manager Stephen Trusheim 'l3
M.S. 'l4 also said that having more
juniors and seniors on the Senate
would be "amazing," he acknowl
edged that many upperclassmen are
busy with other activities or decide
to study abroad instead.
"The fact that you need to be
very representative day in and
day out is a very challenging
thing to do as a junior," he said. "It
takes a very dedicated person to
want to stay in the ASSU with this
weekly, and pretty big, time commit
ment on top of junior year."
Almost complete annual turnover
High turnover rates have also
historically been a problem for the
Senate. In the last four years, only
two senators have served for more
than one term. No senators ran for
reelection this year or last year, and
only one incumbent ran for reelec
tion in both 2011 and 2010.
Former senator Samar Alqatari
'l4, who served on Senate last year,
said that Senate was an experience
that she "wanted to try for one
year," and that she never considered
serving a second term.
"I'd rather help other prospec
tive senators who were not burnt out

and were very passionate about
making a difference, and telling
them how to make the most impact
more so than doing it myself,"
Alqatari said.
Current senator Viraj Bindra 'l5
said the transition between the out
going and incoming Senate last year
was "staggered and sporadic,"
which prevented the new Senate
from making significant progress be
fore summer break.
"There was no continuity from
last year's Senate, so we couldn't use
the five extra weeks at the end of last
year to continue or finish anything
they had started," Bindra said.
"When we came back we still felt
slightly unprepared. The ball just
took a really long time to get rolling."
According to Trusheim, many
senators decide not to run for reelec
tion because they are discouraged
by their experiences on the Senate,
and therefore seek other outlets to
make change on campus.
"It sounds romantic before you
start to be a senator, and then you sit
in a Senate meeting for weeks and
weeks and months and months and
you don't often get the payout that
you do by leading a student group,"
Trusheim said. "You don't get to see
the impact of your things and every
one is always mad at you. It is a very
challenging job to want to do more
than once."
Funding responsibilities and
structural limitations
While many senators take office
intending to make a difference
through student life initiatives, for
mer senators and ASSU officials
agree that the primary purpose of
the Senate is funding, necessitating
more candidates interested in re
viewing funding applications.
"We may as well rename this to
just be the flicking funding board,
which isn't exactly the worst idea I've
ever had," Trusheim said. "There's a
minor advocacy mission to this, but
most of the advocacy work is done in
the University committees."
Trusheim described the ideal sen
ator as someone who "wants to sit
there and niggle about $5O on a bal
loon or something like that," which
may not match the desires of Senate
candidates with more idealistic
plans.
"The very first action that one
Senate took was denying someone
their balloon request," Trusheim
said. "They were like, 'We're going to
take a hard line on requests this
year.' That's the kind of people it
takes to be in the Senate."
Dye said that many incoming
senators are unaware of the Senate's

limitations in terms of student life
projects and advocacy and are disap
pointed when faced with the reality
of serving on Senate.
"People use the ASSU as a plat
form for endless possibility when
this is actually not true," Dye said.
"There are actually things that are
very specific to what the ASSU is,
and people unfortunately walk into
their positions having to comply with
something that they don't necessari
ly want to do."
According to Dye, while the Sen
ate is an effective source of funding
for student groups, it may not be the
right organization for students inter
ested in making significant change
on campus.
"There are plenty of other groups
that have just as much influence and
power as the ASSU on campus in
terms of outreach to students and ef
fectiveness that students can join
and voice their opinions and really
get work done," Dye said. "I think
there is a lot of bureaucracy and red
tape in the ASSU that prevents that
from happening."
Hope for future Senates
In order to promote greater con
tinuity, current senators plan to cre
ate a comprehensive set of transition
documents to guide the new Senate.
"I know that we will be making
sure the transition period is a lot
stronger this time around," Bindra
said. "At least a few of us will be com
ing to every single meeting this
quarter, so we'll make sure that
we're there to answer questions and
make sure they are doing stuff with
in their first couple of weeks in of
fice."
Current senator Christos Have
les 'l5 echoed Bindra's sentiment
and added that several members of
the appropriations committee will at
tend the new Senate's first appropri
ations meetings to answer questions
about funding policies, an area of
weakness for the Senate.
Despite the current Senate's
promise to educate new senators
about their roles and responsibilities,
Trusheim believes the prevalence of
underclassmen senators will contin
ue to pose a challenge to the Senate's
success.
"Coming in as a freshmen into an
institution that is supposed to be the
voice of the student body is a very
challenging thing to do," Trusheim
said. "You don't know enough to
want to do things, and the people
who do [know enough] don't want to
be senators because it's a losing job."
