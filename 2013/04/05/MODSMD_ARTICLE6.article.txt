## 'Sir Ravi' juggles his way to viral Internet fame 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many Stanford students achieve
national recognition for their intel
lectual, artistic or athletic pursuits,
but every now and again a resident
of the Farm will gain fame for some
thing entirely unorthodox. In the
case of Ravi Fernando 'l4, that
unique skill is juggling.
Fernando, a math major, at
tained online stardom for his ability
to juggle two small balls and a Ru
bik's cube while simultaneously
solving the difficult puzzle. The
video, filmed by Chi-Ling Chan 'l4,
has surfaced on multiple sites and
currently boasts over 4 million
views on You Tube.
Chan was working on a project
titled Humans of Stanford, an on
line photo journal featuring diverse
images of the Stanford community,
when she came across Fernando
juggling in White Plaza.
"At the time she was a complete
stranger to me," Fernando recalled.
"I was with the Juggling Club, and

she was walking through. She
stopped by and started talking to
me, and eventually introduced the
project and asked if she could take
pictures and a video."
And the rest is Internet and
juggling history.
Roots of a hobby
Fernando first learned how to
juggle from an instructional book
about 10 years ago, and was intro
duced to Rubik's cubes after he re
ceived one as a Christmas present
when he was in middle school.
While he has long harbored a
strong interest in the Rubik's cube
â€”he is a member of the World
Cube Association and president of
Stanford's Rubik's Cube Club
Fernando's passion for juggling ac
tually emerged during his freshman
year of high school.
"I didn't get seriously into jug
gling for a while," he said. "One
summer I picked it up again the
summer of 2006. I've been into Ru

bik's cubes since 2004, but I didn't
think of combining the two until a
couple years later."
When Fernando came to Stan
ford in 2010, he brought his skill set
with him and taught members of
his freshman dorm Otero
how to solve a Rubik's cube. One
such student was Elena Ayala-Hur
tado 'l4.
Ayala-Hurtado explained that
she didn't know about Fernando's
juggling when the two were first in
troduced.
"I can't remember about the
juggling. I remember about the Ru
bik's cube solving, since Ravi
taught us in our freshman dorm
how to do it," she said. "He had
these events in the lounge and peo
ple [would gather] around."
Now a junior, juggling has be
come second nature to Fernando,
and he frequently practices his fa
mous trick by himself and with
friends in the Juggling Club. He
noted that the actual process of
solving the Rubik's cube is the
hardest part.
"I've gotten to the point where
the juggling is automatic," Fernan
do said. "I focus on what one step I
am working on [with] the Rubik's
cube at the moment. A lot of the
thinking I have to do is how the
cube moves in the air."
The emergence of Sir Ravi
After Chan's video went viral in
March 2013, Ravi's skills gained an
audience that extended beyond his
freshman dorm or even the crowds
that often gather to watch him per
form in White Plaza.
Known as Sir Ravi the Juggler,
Fernando has been featured on
many online publications because of
his unique skill.
"The video was first posted on
Facebook, and was getting hun
dreds and thousands of views and
likes and shares," Fernando said.
"It really started taking off when
this comedian named Steve Berke
posted the video of my juggling on
You Tube. On You Tube, he has
around 40,000 or 50,000 sub
scribers. So, after a day or two it
had a million views."
After the premiere of the video
on Berke's You Tube channel, media
outlets across the country began to
contact him, among them The To
day Show, National Public Radio
and Good Morning America, as well

as some from other countries like
India, Brazil and Japan.
Fernando was slated to perform
on NBC's The Today Show, but his
appearance fell through because
they wouldn't let him juggle live on
the show and instead opted for a
pre-taped routine.
"I was not really on board with
that, so I decided to cancel," he
said. "Good Morning America con
tacted me right after The Today
Show thing, and I was sort of sick of
talking to the Today Show people,
so I decided that I didn't really feel
like doing Good Morning America."
Fernando said that his recent 15
minutes of fame has been difficult
to get used to. For instance, on the
first day that Berke shared the
video, Fernando received so many
friend requests on Facebook that
he had to change his privacy set
tings.
"It's been stressful at times,"
Fernando said. "The video started
blowing up towards the end of win
ter quarter with classes going on."
The juggler's future
In addition to performing his
tricks on campus, Fernando also
participates in national competi
tions, like the United States Na
tional Rubik's Cube Championship
in 2011 in Las Vegas.
"National Championship is fair
ly intense," he said. "There are usu
ally 2,300 people there. There are
15 or 20 events, not just solving a
Rubik's cube directly. I participated
in speed-solving it's always been
my main event."
For such competitions, Fernan
do continues to practice with the
Stanford Rubik's Cube Club.
"Stanford used to have [Rubik's
cube] competitions on a quarterly
basis, but lately Stanford's club
hasn't had really enough people to
organize things effectively," he said,
referencing a trend he hopes will
change.
Still, Fernando said that he had
never seen juggling and solving Ru
bik's cubes as anything more than a
hobby. Instead of clasping onto his
fame, Fernando hopes to settle
back into normal life on the Farm,
continuing to develop additional
tricks as part of his beloved hobby.
"My latest idea is to solve a Ru
bik's cube while juggling on a uni
cycle," Fernando said when asked
about any new tricks he was coming
up with. "I tried it a couple of days
ago, and there might be a new video
coming soon."
