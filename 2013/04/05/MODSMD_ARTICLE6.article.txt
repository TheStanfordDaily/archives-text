Many Stanford students achieve
national recognition for their intel
lectual, artistic or athletic pursuits,
but every now and again a resident
of the Farm will gain fame for some
thing entirely unorthodox. In the
case of Ravi Fernando 'l4, that
unique skill is juggling.
Fernando, a math major, at
tained online stardom for his ability
to juggle two small balls and a Ru
bik's cube while simultaneously
solving the difficult puzzle. The
video, filmed by Chi-Ling Chan 'l4,
has surfaced on multiple sites and
currently boasts over 4 million
views on You Tube.
Chan was working on a project
titled Humans of Stanford, an on
line photo journal featuring diverse
images of the Stanford community,
when she came across Fernando
juggling in White Plaza.
"At the time she was a complete
stranger to me," Fernando recalled.
"I was with the Juggling Club, and

she was walking through. She
stopped by and started talking to
me, and eventually introduced the
project and asked if she could take
pictures and a video."
And the rest is Internet and
juggling history.
Roots of a hobby
Fernando first learned how to
juggle from an instructional book
about 10 years ago, and was intro
duced to Rubik's cubes after he re
ceived one as a Christmas present
when he was in middle school.
While he has long harbored a
strong interest in the Rubik's cube
â€”he is a member of the World
Cube Association and president of
Stanford's Rubik's Cube Club
Fernando's passion for juggling ac
tually emerged during his freshman
year of high school.
"I didn't get seriously into jug
gling for a while," he said. "One
summer I picked it up again the
summer of 2006. I've been into Ru

Ravi Fernando '14's skill with both Rubik's cubes and
juggling - he can juggle 7 balls at a time and solve a
Rubik's cube in 7.65 seconds - may lead him next to
attempting his juggling act while on a unicycle.
