## SEEING GREEN Teach and Let Teach? 
### Holly Moeller 
Do you remember your first
science lesson? I don't but
that's because I was raised
by scientists.
Besides my parental influences,
though, I was also a public school
student in a well-to-do New Jersey
town full of doctors and lawyers
from so many cultural and religious
backgrounds that the one thing they
agreed on was science. Namely, that
it should be taught, with minimal
fuss and next to no social agenda.
So I learned all the mechanics of
why sex can lead to babies and
memorized statistics on at least 10
different forms of birth control
including one that, at the time, was
only available in Canada. I learned
that no, humans don't come from
monkeys, but we sure do share a
common evolutionary ancestor.
Our school system managed to
walk the fine lines of various so
ciopolitical debates by realizing that,
frankly, the line had no bearing on
the teaching of scientific fact. Is ab
stinence the only 100-percent effec
tive way to prevent pregnancy? Ab
solutely, and it was one of the birth
control methods we were taught.
Did Darwin's religious views stall
publication of On the Origin of
Species for decades? Yes, and we
learned the social context of the his
tory of science then, just as we'd
learned about the Church's excom
munication of Galileo. But the vast
majority of class time was spent sift
ing through the scientific evidence
that supported Darwin's theory so
clearly that, eventually, even the
Catholic Church accepted the ex
planatory power of evolution.
While this system worked great
for me, it clearly doesn't for at least
some Americans: The debate over
the scientific content of public school
educations still rages on in legisla
tures and classrooms across the
country.
And now there's a new topic to
squabble over: climate change.
New K-12 nationwide science
standards based on the National
Research Council's science educa
tion framework are due out this
month, and they'll call for the in
clusion of climate change in the
standard public school curriculum.
Rising atmospheric carbon diox
ide levels and the companion is
sues of climate change and ocean
acidification are among the most
important problems our generation
(and our younger siblings and
cousins) will face. Yet many of us
have only a rough or entirely ab
sent— understanding of the links
between fossil fuel-based energy
production, carbon emissions, atmos
pheric chemistry and physics, and
downstream environmental effects.
In theory, by making sure every
child in America has a chance to
gain the relevant scientific back
ground, we can prime the next gen-

eration for the tough decisions and
creative solutions they'll need in the
future. Meanwhile, the kids' elemen
tary school lessons will hopefully
percolate up through the family
tree, so we can kick some carbon
cutting solutions into action sooner
rather than later.
But despite scientific near-con
sensus that humans are changing
the climate system at an alarming
rate, a robust climate-change-denial
machine continues to churn out
propaganda and legislation to the
contrary. The Heartland Institute is
working on an "alternative climate
curriculum," and legislation in sev
eral states encourages and even
mandates climate-change-denial
education.
Do these groups have a point?
Sure, to a degree. No climate scien
tist worth his or her salt would say
that science's job is done. Indeed,
it's impossible to talk about climate
change without talking about uncer
tainty; the most basic model predic
tions come with caveats like "ap
proximately" and "somewhere in
the range of."
And that's what makes teaching
the science behind climate change so
exciting and engaging. Done right,
it's the perfect lesson on scientific
inquiry here's what we don't
know, here're our hypotheses, and
this is how we test them made
more exciting by the fact that it's
still very much a work in progress.
What we don't need is to pollute
this atmosphere of learning with a
political agenda. We don't need the
financial might of the oil and gas in
dustry— which funds Heartland's
curriculum development and the
campaigns of politicians who later
introduce climate-change-denial
legislation bullying the public
school system into producing a gen
eration of mindless consumers. We
don't need to stifle the innovative
potential of our youth by playing the
ostrich, head buried in the sand.
Instead, let's just teach the sci
ence: The chemical reactions of en
ergy production. The physics of at
mospheric circulation. The biologi
cal response of plants and animals.
The mathematics of prediction and
the statistics of uncertainty. And
let's trust our students to sift
through the information like scien
tists and figure it out.
