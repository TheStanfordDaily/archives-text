# SEEING GREEN
## Columbae's run through library needs to stay 
### ELISE COOPER '13 
A great tradition died at the
end of winter quarter. Every
finals week for as long as we
can remember, co-op residents
have quietly walked naked through
Green Library to wish studiers
good luck before finals. But two
weeks ago, there were no bashful
giggles echoing through the stacks.
No awkwardly averted stares from
astonished studiers. No chocolate
covered espresso beans to liven up
the monotony of the late night.
Four cop cars guarded the en
trance to Green Library. Their pur
pose was unclear, but it was almost
certainly to deter us. Once inside

the library, one of the library atten
dants confronted us and politely
but firmly told us we could not
streak the library and had to leave.
I'm sad for this University. I'm
sad that what has been a consistent
and innocent tradition of youthful
joy and freedom is being squashed.
We acknowledge that nudity in the
library is slightly distracting, and
we appreciate that the library at
tendant is only doing his job. But
we also firmly believe that this is a
beautiful tradition, one that partici
pants revel in for its expressive and
liberating power, and one that on
lookers appreciate as one of the
crazy and exciting parts of an eclec
tic college experience.
Not everyone appreciates us
walking naked through the library.
But I think everyone appreciates

that Stanford is (or was?) a place
where "the wind of freedom
blows." And I think that if Stan
ford actively opposes the crazy
shenanigans of its students, a great
part of our tradition and culture will
be lost.
I would like to end with an apol
ogy to the student body. We have
failed you. Where we used to bring
love and chocolate, we have left you
alone and uninspired. In the wake
of a series of confrontations be
tween the student body and the
University, we are again faced with
an unsatisfying conclusion.
The only consolation we can offer
is extending a campus-wide invita
tion to Columbae's annual "Rick the
Man" party in the spring. Peace out.
