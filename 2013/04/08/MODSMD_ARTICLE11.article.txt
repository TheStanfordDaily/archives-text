## OP-ED I am not your Gay Best Friend 
### COOPER WILLIAMS '13 
lam privileged to live in an age
where opinion is changing rap
idly on homosexuality. Surveys
show our generation is overwhelm
ingly accepting of same-sex couples
and of homosexuality itself. And yet,
there remains one particular, perni
cious expression of disrespect for
gay men, almost entirely unique to
well-meaning straight women. It is
this: the Gay Best Friend.
For the uninitiated, the Gay Best
Friend (n.), also Sassy Gay Friend
or abbreviated simply as Gay
Friend, is a fabulous creature full of
sassy advice, put on earth for the
sole purpose of advising hapless
straight girls bogged down by the
weight of decisions about boys and
fashion and stuff. For more, see: the
Bravo Network.

I was recently reminded of the
prevalence of this idea. First, a girl
invited a (lowercase) gay friend of
mine to her special dinner, because,
turns out, she was in a competition
with her girl friend "to see which of
our Sassy Gay Friends is funnier!"
While I was at Stanford in Washing
ton, people jokingly discussed our
mock political futures, as Stanford
students are apt to do during a
quarter in D.C. One oft-repeated
suggestion for my future was that I
become Chelsea Lately. I was in
month three of researching financial
access and inclusion in Latin Amer
ica with an economist at the World
Bank, but apparently my future was
to be a half-drunk, female late-night
talk show host. Finally, not long ago,

a drunken girl I'd met an hour ago
told me, "I want more Gay Friends.
Gays are the best! I hope that's not
offensive," she added.
Well, it is. I am not your Gay
Best Friend. Your Gay Best Friend
is not your Gay Best Friend. He is a
person, three-dimensional, who ex
perienced significant pain coming to
terms with his homosexuality.
Growing up gay leaves many of us
with a perceived need to constantly
be on defense, and this manifests it
self in us gay guys, yes, getting a lit
tle sassy sometimes.
Stereotypes don't invent them
selves, after all. Being someone's
Sassy Gay Friend brings with it a
perverse form of acceptance that we
feel we need. Yet this acceptance
doesn't happen on our own terms
but is dictated by stereotypes from
popular media. Gay men are being
reduced to a collectible grab bag of
sassy one-liners and catty witti
cisms. These friendships aren't real.
They are friendships in which if I
try to open up, as friends do with
each other, her eyes glaze over as if
she's wondering "when will he start
saying 'guuurl' again?"
True acceptance comes when
you find friends like the ones I've
been lucky enough to make, both
gay and straight. Friends that ex
pect conversation and not a carica
ture, and who don't think it's funny
when I show my Southern California
roots by calling people dude, because
I "sound so straight." So the next
time you catch yourself talking about
your Gay Best Friend, stop and think
about what kind of Straight Best
Friend you're being to him.
