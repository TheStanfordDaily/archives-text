## OFFENSIVE EXPLOSION 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal bats finally awoke,
erupting for 20 runs on 40 hits over
the weekend at USC as Stanford
again took two out of three games
from a Pac-12 opponent on the road
but fell just short of a sweep for the
second weekend in a row.

On Friday night, Stanford (16-10,
5-4 Pac-12) got a rare scare for a start
from senior starting pitcher Mark
Appel. The senior had been simply
dominant over his past five starts, al
lowing three earned runs while strik
ing out over 12 per outing, but fell be
hind 2-0 to USC (12-19,5-7 Pac-12) on
a two-RBI double by left fielder Tim
my Robinson in the bottom of the
fifth inning.
But the Cardinal answered right
back. Sophomore third baseman Alex
Blandino walked, junior second base
man Danny Diekroeger singled and
junior shortstop Lonnie Kauppila
bunted both of them over to put run
ners on second and third with only
one out.
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess then had a tough decision to
make. Junior slugger Austin Wilson
was due up to bat, but Friday was
Wilson's first game back since he in
jured his elbow back at Rice in the
season-opening series.
Marquess opted to pinch hit for
Wilson with sophomore switch hitter
Dominic Jose. The move backfired, as
Jose struck out, leaving runners on
second and third with two outs.
Luckily for the skipper, Stanford's
unlikely star of 2013, junior catcher
Brant Whiting, bailed him out in a big
way. After falling behind 0-2, the lefty
worked the count full and then put

the payoff pitch over the right field
fence for a three-run homer, the first
of his career, to give Stanford a 3-2
lead.
That was all the run support Ap
pel would need, though the Cardinal
added an unearned insurance run in
the seventh. The righty settled down
well to get within one out of his fourth
complete game. But after Appel put
the tying run on base with a two-out
walk, Stanford turned to junior pitch
er AJ Vanegas to close out the game.
Five pitches later, Vanegas induced a
weak ground ball and earned a one
out save, his third save of the year.
On Saturday, Stanford had its first

double-digit run performance of the
season, which was more than enough
for freshman left-handed pitcher Lo
gan James (1-2) to earn the victory.
Early on, it looked like USC was
the team gearing up for an offensive
explosion. The Trojans chased Stan
ford freshman starting pitcher Mar
cus Brakeman from the game with
the bases loaded and nobody out in
the bottom of the second inning.
With the Cardinal and Trojans
tied at two Stanford scored two
unearned inns in the top of the sec
ond — James pulled the nearly im
possible. The lefty struck out USC
center fielder Greg Zebrack for the

first out and then induced an inning
ending double play ball from second
baseman Adam Landecker for the
Houdini, one of baseball's rarer ac
complishments.
James' magic act was big for mo
mentum, as Stanford's offensive on
slaught began two innings later.
First, Kauppila knocked in
Diekroeger to regain the lead in the
top of the fifth with a single up the
middle. Then, after USC tied it once
again in the bottom of the inning,
Stanford came right back when

ning.

two runs in the top of the fourth, in

lead, scoring three runs off junior

pitcher Sam Lindquist and senior

runs were charged to Lindquist.

But Stanford's hitters weren't

The Cardinal roared back in the
top of the eighth to tie the game at

The Cardinal bats finally awoke,
erupting for 20 runs on 40 hits over
the weekend at USC as Stanford
again took two out of three games
from a Pac-12 opponent on the road
but fell just short of a sweep for the
second weekend in a row.

On Friday night, Stanford (16-10,
5-4 Pac-12) got a rare scare for a start
from senior starting pitcher Mark
Appel. The senior had been simply
dominant over his past five starts, al
lowing three earned runs while strik
ing out over 12 per outing, but fell be
hind 2-0 to USC (12-19,5-7 Pac-12) on
a two-RBI double by left fielder Tim
my Robinson in the bottom of the
fifth inning.
But the Cardinal answered right
back. Sophomore third baseman Alex
Blandino walked, junior second base
man Danny Diekroeger singled and
junior shortstop Lonnie Kauppila
bunted both of them over to put run
ners on second and third with only
one out.
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess then had a tough decision to
make. Junior slugger Austin Wilson
was due up to bat, but Friday was
Wilson's first game back since he in
jured his elbow back at Rice in the
season-opening series.
Marquess opted to pinch hit for
Wilson with sophomore switch hitter
Dominic Jose. The move backfired, as
Jose struck out, leaving runners on
second and third with two outs.
Luckily for the skipper, Stanford's
unlikely star of 2013, junior catcher
Brant Whiting, bailed him out in a big
way. After falling behind 0-2, the lefty
worked the count full and then put

the payoff pitch over the right field
fence for a three-run homer, the first
of his career, to give Stanford a 3-2
lead.
That was all the run support Ap
pel would need, though the Cardinal
added an unearned insurance run in
the seventh. The righty settled down
well to get within one out of his fourth
complete game. But after Appel put
the tying run on base with a two-out
walk, Stanford turned to junior pitch
er AJ Vanegas to close out the game.
Five pitches later, Vanegas induced a
weak ground ball and earned a one
out save, his third save of the year.
On Saturday, Stanford had its first

double-digit run performance of the
season, which was more than enough
for freshman left-handed pitcher Lo
gan James (1-2) to earn the victory.
Early on, it looked like USC was
the team gearing up for an offensive
explosion. The Trojans chased Stan
ford freshman starting pitcher Mar
cus Brakeman from the game with
the bases loaded and nobody out in
the bottom of the second inning.
With the Cardinal and Trojans
tied at two Stanford scored two
