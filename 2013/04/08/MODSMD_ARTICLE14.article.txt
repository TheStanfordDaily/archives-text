## Weekend ends on good note Card falls to Irvine but downs UCSD 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WETTER 
This weekend, the No. 8 Stanford
men's volleyball team was on the road,
taking on No. 4 UC-Irvine and UC-San
Diego. The Cardinal was fresh off an im
pressive turnaround win over Pacific
last Tuesday but was unable to keep the
win streak going, falling in three sets to
Irvine before sweeping UCSD.

The Anteaters (20-6, 17-6 MPSF)
had swept the Cardinal (14-11,11-11) in
their past meeting and were looking to
repeat that in front of their boisterous
home crowd. Stanford, however, was
looking for some revenge and certainly
looked as if they would get it, cruising to
an early 8-4 lead.

Irvine, however, was not intimidated.
The Anteaters unleashed a seven-point
run, featuring three aces from sopho
more opposite Zack La Cavera, turning
the four-point deficit into a three-point
lead.

The Cardinal still refused to be
cowed and stayed close, pulling the
game even at 14 apiece. At that point,
however, Irvine began to pull away from
Stanford, ultimately taking the set 25-
20.

The second set saw Irvine get off to
a quick start, taking an early 8-3 lead.
Again, the Cardinal was able to slowly
work itself back into contention, pulling
within two as late as 20-18. The
Anteaters, however, proved too power
ful, winning the second set 25-20.
Stanford needed to capture the third
set to avoid its second straight sweep at
the hands of Irvine. The Cardinal took
the first point of the set but was unable
to maintain the lead as the Anteaters
cruised to a 25-19 set victory.
Stanford was completely outper
formed by Irvine on the offensive end,
hitting just .194 while the Anteaters hit
.375. Junior opposite Brian Cook and
junior outside hitter Steven Irvin con
tinued their strong production, combin
ing for 17 kills. Their fellow junior, mid
dle blocker Denny Falls, had another

impressive performance in
his return to the starting
lineup, posting five blocks
and chipping in four kills on
.571 hitting.
Following the loss, Stan
ford traveled down to sunny
San Diego to take on the Tri
tons (7-20, 4-18). Stanford
had defeated UCSD in their
previous meeting and looked
as though they would do so
again, coming right out of the
gates with three straight
points.

The Tritons hung tight,
even pulling within three late
in the set, but Stanford was
able to escape with a 25-20 vic
tory behind four kills each from
Cook, Falls and junior middle
blocker Eric Mochalski.

The Tritons fought back
in the second set, starting
with a quick five-point run
that put them ahead 5-2. The
game turned into a cat-and

mouse affair, with both
teams exchanging points and
neither able to get the ad
vantage over the other.
UCSD held the set point
at 24-23, but a kill from jun
ior opposite Daniel Tublin
squared the game at 24.
Stanford then had a set point
opportunity of its own, but
UCSD answered with its
own kill. Finally, on Stan
ford's second chance,
Mochalski crushed a ball
down the line for the set
winning kill.
Stanford had to win just
one more set to earn its sec
ond straight sweep over the
Tritons. From the outset, it
was clear that UCSD had no
intentions of letting that
happen. The Tritons started
on a 4-0 run that quickly put
Stanford in a large hole.
Down 19-14, the Cardinal
needed to put forth a mas
sive effort to get itself back
in the game.
Stanford slowly began to
close the gap, but was run
ning out of time as UCSD
neared 25 points. The Tri

tons earned their first game
point at 24-22, but Stanford
countered with four straight
points, closing with a power
ful kill from Cook that gave
the Cardinal a 26-24 victory.

Cook would finish with 10
kills and six digs, while Irvin
added 12 kills, two aces and
nine digs. Mochalski had one
of his best games of the sea
son, with 10 kills on .533 hit
ting, as well as four blocks.
Falls continued his strong
play out of the middle, adding
four kills and eight blocks.
With the win, Stanford
moved up to seventh in the
MPSF, a full game ahead of
Cal State-Northridge. The
Cardinal needs to stay with
in the top eight to secure its
spot in the MPSF playoffs
and ensure a chance at a na
tional championship.
Next weekend, Stanford
closes its regular season at
Maples Pavilion with re
matches against Cal Baptist
and BYU.
