### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WETTER 
This weekend, the No. 8 Stanford
men's volleyball team was on the road,
taking on No. 4 UC-Irvine and UC-San
Diego. The Cardinal was fresh off an im
pressive turnaround win over Pacific
last Tuesday but was unable to keep the
win streak going, falling in three sets to
Irvine before sweeping UCSD.

The Anteaters (20-6, 17-6 MPSF)
had swept the Cardinal (14-11,11-11) in
their past meeting and were looking to
repeat that in front of their boisterous
home crowd. Stanford, however, was
looking for some revenge and certainly
looked as if they would get it, cruising to
an early 8-4 lead.

Irvine, however, was not intimidated.
The Anteaters unleashed a seven-point
run, featuring three aces from sopho
more opposite Zack La Cavera, turning
the four-point deficit into a three-point
lead.

The Cardinal still refused to be
cowed and stayed close, pulling the
game even at 14 apiece. At that point,
however, Irvine began to pull away from
Stanford, ultimately taking the set 25-
20.

The second set saw Irvine get off to
a quick start, taking an early 8-3 lead.
Again, the Cardinal was able to slowly
work itself back into contention, pulling
within two as late as 20-18. The
Anteaters, however, proved too power
ful, winning the second set 25-20.
Stanford needed to capture the third
set to avoid its second straight sweep at
the hands of Irvine. The Cardinal took
the first point of the set but was unable
to maintain the lead as the Anteaters
cruised to a 25-19 set victory.
Stanford was completely outper
formed by Irvine on the offensive end,
hitting just .194 while the Anteaters hit
.375. Junior opposite Brian Cook and
junior outside hitter Steven Irvin con
tinued their strong production, combin
ing for 17 kills. Their fellow junior, mid
dle blocker Denny Falls, had another
