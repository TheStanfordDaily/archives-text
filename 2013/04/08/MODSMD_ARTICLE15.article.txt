# DEFENSE DOMINATES
## Stanford top-two seed for MPSF 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
In the last regular-season
home game of her career, senior
goalkeeper Kate Baldoni held
No. 4 UCLA to just one goal as
the No. 2 Stanford women's wa
ter polo team (23-1, 4-0 MPSF)
defeated the Bruins 8-1 in front
of a large crowd at Avery Aquat
ic Center on Saturday afternoon.
With the victory, the Cardi
nal clinched a top-two seed in
the MPSF Championships,
which will take place from April
26-28. Next weekend's tilt
against No. 1 USC will decide
who takes the number one spot.

UCLA entered the contest
averaging over 11 goals per

game, but Baldoni (with seven
saves) and the Cardinal defense
kept the Bruins off the score
board until the final five minutes
of the game.

Stanford's aggressive de
fending consistently forced
UCLA to settle for shots from
the perimeter, and, with the help
of a few fortuitous bounces off
the posts, Baldoni saved every
attempt except one.
Baldoni was not the only
member of the Class of 2013 to
perform well on Senior Day
classmates Melissa Seidemann
and Alexis Lee led the Cardinal
with two goals apiece. Junior

ZETONG LI/The Stanford Daily
Senior Kate Baldoni (above) recorded seven saves in Saturday's
game, contributing to a strong defensive effort and leading the
No. 2 Card past No. 8 UCLA 8-1 at the Avery Aquatic Center.
Kaley Dodson also scored
twice, while sophomore Ash
ley Grossman and junior
Kelsey Suggs each chipped
in a goal.
Seidemann opened the
scoring with a penalty shot
goal less than two minutes
into the game. That would be
the only goal of the first pe
riod as both defenses and
goalkeepers stood strong.
Stanford freshman Maggie
Steffens earned a penalty
shot of her own with 4:25 left
in the quarter, but UCLA
goalkeeper Sami Hill made
the save to keep the score at
1-0.

The Cardinal doubled the
lead early in the second peri
od when Lee finished a shot
from the near post after a
nice pass from sophomore
Kiley Neushul.
It appeared that there would
be just a single goal in the
second period as well until a
UCLA player was excluded
in the final minute of the
half. With six seconds to go
before halftime, Dodson
skipped a shot in from a
tight angle to give the Cardi

nal a 3-0 lead.
UCLA had one of its best
scoring chances of the game
on a long breakout pass two
minutes after halftime, but
Suggs tracked down the
streaking Bruin and broke
up the play.

The Bruins had another
opportunity to get on the
scoreboard when they
earned a power play with
two minutes left in the peri
od. On UCLA's first shooting
attempt, Dodson made a
strong block, and the second
went over the crossbar to
end the threat.

On the ensuing posses
sion, Stanford converted a 6-
on-5 of its own. Seidemann
received a lob pass near the
post and fired the ball home
for her second tally of the
game.

After winning the opening
sprint to give the Cardinal
possession to start the
fourth quarter, Dodson
scored from in close to give
Stanford a 5-0 lead.

The Bruins finally scored
when UCLA sophomore
Emily Donohoe snuck a shot
inside the near post with 4:44
remaining in the game.
Donohoe had another scoring
change a minute later, but
Baldoni blocked the shot to
maintain the four-goal lead.

The Cardinal then
capped the game off with
three goals in the final four
minutes.

Alexis Lee scored a power
play goal the Cardinal's
third 6-on-5 score of the
game before Grossman
fought off a UCLA defender
to finish a breakaway and
Suggs scored on a long shot
17 seconds before the buzzer.
With 46 seconds left in
the game, Stanford head
coach John Tanner substi
tuted for all four active sen
iorsâ€” Baldoni, Jillian Gar
ton, Lee and Seidemann

to let the crowd show their
appreciation for the group's
four seasons of work. The
Cardinal's fifth senior, Victo
ria Kennedy, is sitting out
the year with an injury.

Stanford now turns its at
tention to the looming re
match with USC. The
Women of Troy are the only
team to beat the Cardinal
this season, which they did
by a 13-10 score on Feb. 24.
The Cardinal will look to
avenge that loss and grab
the top seed in the MPSF
when the two teams meet at
4 p.m. next Saturday in Los
Angeles.
