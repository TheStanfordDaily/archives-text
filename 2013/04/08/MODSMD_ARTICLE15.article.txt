# DEFENSE DOMINATES
## Stanford top-two seed for MPSF 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
In the last regular-season
home game of her career, senior
goalkeeper Kate Baldoni held
No. 4 UCLA to just one goal as
the No. 2 Stanford women's wa
ter polo team (23-1, 4-0 MPSF)
defeated the Bruins 8-1 in front
of a large crowd at Avery Aquat
ic Center on Saturday afternoon.
With the victory, the Cardi
nal clinched a top-two seed in
the MPSF Championships,
which will take place from April
26-28. Next weekend's tilt
against No. 1 USC will decide
who takes the number one spot.

UCLA entered the contest
averaging over 11 goals per

game, but Baldoni (with seven
saves) and the Cardinal defense
kept the Bruins off the score
board until the final five minutes
of the game.

Stanford's aggressive de
fending consistently forced
UCLA to settle for shots from
the perimeter, and, with the help
of a few fortuitous bounces off
the posts, Baldoni saved every
attempt except one.
Baldoni was not the only
member of the Class of 2013 to
perform well on Senior Day
classmates Melissa Seidemann
and Alexis Lee led the Cardinal
with two goals apiece. Junior
