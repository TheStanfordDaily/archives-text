## Card NCAA bound Stanford claims the golden ticket 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
For the sixth time in seven
years, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team is going to the
NCAA National Champi
onships. In order to earn the
spot, the Cardinal had to finish
in the top two out of six teams at
the Norman Regional Champi
onships at the University of
Oklahoma on Saturday.
Oklahoma, the second
ranked team in the country, ad
vanced by winning the regional
competition with a score of
197.375, while Stanford finished
in second with a team score of
196.800. It beat out No. 22
Washington (195.925), No. 14
Penn State (195.875), Southern
Utah (194.850) and lowa
(194.475). While the final score
shows Stanford qualifying by
nearly a full point, it was not un
til a nearly flawless final round
that Stanford punched its ticket
to the NCAA Championships.

Stanford started the meet on
bars, where it posted a score of
48.975. The team was led by
sophomore Kristina Vaculik,
who posted a 9.850 to earn a tie
for eighth place overall. She was
supported by senior Ashley
Morgan and junior Shona Mor
gan, each of whom scored a
9.800. Ashley has scored at least
a 9.800 on bars in every compe
tition this season, while Shona is
almost as impressive, scoring a
9.800 in all but two.

Throughout the season, the
beam has been Stanford's most
consistent event. Saturday's
meet was nothing different, as
Stanford put together a 49.225
to move closer to the national
championship.
Sophomore Ivana Hong, who
shined in her second regional
competition for Stanford, led
the Cardinal with a score of
9.900. Hong tied for first place,
giving her her fourth first-place
finish in the event and Stanford
its eighth overall. Shona
Morgan was not far behind
her, scoring a 9.875 to finish
third overall. Vaculik came
up big once again, scoring a
9.825 that Stanford desper
ately needed after a missed
routine in order to stay in
the hunt for the top two
spots. Stanford's 49.225 was
its second-best team score
on the beam this season,
true to the Cardinal's
mantra of saving its best for
last.

Going to floor exercises,
Ashley Morgan showed
everyone why she is a three
time Pac-12 floor champion.
Morgan posted a 9.900 to
earn her a tie for first-place
overall, her fourth first-place
finish on the floor this the
season. Freshman Taylor
Rice and sophomore Sam
Shapiro were just behind
their senior captain, each ty
ing their career highs with a
score of 9.875 to pace Stan
ford to a team score of
49.175. Shapiro, normally
known for her bars routines
finished second at last
year's NCAA Champi
onships felt good con
tributing in the best way she
could.

"Particularly on floor, I
knew that the team needed
me in that moment," she
said, "and it felt so good to
be able to hit my routine for
them."

However, despite three
solid team events to start
out, Stanford found itself
just 0.125 points ahead of
third-place Penn State and
need a strong round on vault
to solidify its second-place
finish. Not only did the Car
dinal deliver a good round, it
posted a season-high score
of 49.425 to guarantee its
spot in the National Champi
onships.
Hong led the way once
again for the Cardinal, put
ting together a season-best
9.950 to earn her second in
dividual title of the day and
the highest individual score
of the meet. While Hong was
impressed with her individ
ual accomplishments, she
knew what mattered most
coming from this weekend. "

"Winning the individual
titles on vault and beam was
awesome, but the team's
success is what matters the
most, and I'm so proud of
how much fight our team
showed this last weekend,"
Hong said.
Last year at the national
championships, Stanford
earned an impressive fourth
place finish. The team hopes
to achieve such an accom
plishment once again, or
even better.

The championship con
sists of 12 teams: Alabama,
Florida, Oklahoma, Georgia,
LSU, UCLA, Michigan,
Minnesota, Utah, Arkansas,

Illinois and Stanford. The

championships will be held
at UCLA from April 19-21,
where after the first day six
of the 12 teams are eliminat
ed from the field.

While the team has a big
challenge ahead of it,
Shapiro thinks the Cardinal
has what it takes to make a
statement on the biggest
stage.

"As a team, we feel ex
tremely confident going into
Nationals," she said. "We
have worked so hard and
have overcome so much to
gether that this is just the ic
ing on the cake!"
