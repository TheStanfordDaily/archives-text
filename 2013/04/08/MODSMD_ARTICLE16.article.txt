### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
For the sixth time in seven
years, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team is going to the
NCAA National Champi
onships. In order to earn the
spot, the Cardinal had to finish
in the top two out of six teams at
the Norman Regional Champi
onships at the University of
Oklahoma on Saturday.
Oklahoma, the second
ranked team in the country, ad
vanced by winning the regional
competition with a score of
197.375, while Stanford finished
in second with a team score of
196.800. It beat out No. 22
Washington (195.925), No. 14
Penn State (195.875), Southern
Utah (194.850) and lowa

shows Stanford qualifying by
nearly a full point, it was not un

Stanford started the meet on
bars, where it posted a score of
48.975. The team was led by
sophomore Kristina Vaculik,
who posted a 9.850 to earn a tie
for eighth place overall. She was
supported by senior Ashley
Morgan and junior Shona Mor

9.800. Ashley has scored at least
a 9.800 on bars in every compe

almost as impressive, scoring a
9.800 in all but two.

Throughout the season, the
beam has been Stanford's most
consistent event. Saturday's
meet was nothing different, as
Stanford put together a 49.225
to move closer to the national
championship.
Sophomore Ivana Hong, who
shined in her second regional
competition for Stanford, led
the Cardinal with a score of
9.900. Hong tied for first place,
giving her her fourth first-place
finish in the event and Stanford
