What exactly sepa
rates Bob Knight
from Mike Rice?
For the unin
formed, Mike Rice
is essentially a playground bully mas
querading as a collegiate basketball
coach. Leaked footage from numer
ous Rutgers practices show Rice pa
trolling the court, hurling insensitive
slurs, basketballs and temper
tantrums at his players. The slight
est infraction on the part of players
was anecdotally enough to set Rice
off; his vengeance was enough to
cause numerous players to quit. In a
quirk of NCAA power management,
however, abused players who want
ed to escape would have to go to Rice
to get approval for their transfers.
You can imagine, then, why very few
were able to take that route.
When I first watched the leaked
videos, I was utterly shocked. Any
athlete will tell you that the un
hinged, angry and scary coaching
mode lies in the arsenal of every sin
gle coach, used mainly as a motivat
ing tactic or a change of pace. With
Rice, it seemed to be his only mode;
his manic antics extended to the
court (with his treatment of officials
and opposing teams) and even be
yond (an ESPN report claims that
he even abused kids at a summer
camp for coming in to the gym late).
I think I speak fairly when I say that
the game is no place for such crazi
ness...

And yet, the videos seemed eeri
ly similar to lowlights from the ca
reer of the legendary (or notorious,
depending on your point of view)
Bob Knight. Knight was undoubted
ly a brilliant coach, with a sterling
win-loss record following him wher
ever he coached. However, the dark
side to the Bob Knight picture was
his penchant for abusing players.
Over his years at Indiana and Texas
Tech, Knight was continually repri
manded for physically and verbally
tearing into his players, often with
disastrous consequences. In fact, an
instance of player abuse was what
eventually doomed his coaching ca
reer.

Yet, despite many documented
instances of Knight abusing players,
up until his final game Knight gener
ally escaped with minimal punish
ment for his actions. Why does he
get a pass when Rice goes down in
flames?

Personally, I think it is because
deep down, America subscribes to a
very Machiavellian view on sports. If
a coach gets results and gets his
teams to win (which Knight was con
sistently able to do), then most of the
stuff that goes on under his watch is
swept under the rug. It is when a
coach fails to get results that the
transgressions are truly punished. It
begs the question whether or not the
results of this sordid saga would be
different if Rutgers had just played
in the Final Four, for example.
More troubling to me is the ero
sion of the rights of the student-ath
lete. The NCAA loves to trumpet how
much its student-athletes achieve on
a yearly basis. However, they routine
ly gloss over the fact that these ath
letes are at the complete whim and
mercy of their coaches. The coaches
determine who gets scholarships,
which are for many the only means
of affording a higher education.
With the power of the purse
comes avenues for all kinds of abuse;
the age-old maxim is that absolute
power corrupts absolutely. Many
athletes get sucked into a cycle from
which there is no escape. The in
equity when comparing athletes to
coaches is startling: Coaches rou
tinely back out of contracts, stab
their employers in the back, negoti
ate in bad faith and act like Mike
Rice. Players can do none of these
things, for their eligibility and liveli
hoods are at stake. None of this
makes any sense from an outside
perspective. But then again, nothing
the NCAA does ever makes sense.

In the end, the outrage over Rice
(and the inaction of Rutgers AD Tim
Pernetti) will resonate for another
week and most likely fade away. But
the root of the problem the ab
solute power in the hands of bully
coaches will not go away until
someone (NCAA, I'm looking at you)
comes in to intervene. My fear is that
it will take something even more dra
matic than Rice's silliness on camera
for time change to come about.
Meanwhile, we have the NCAA
men's basketball national champi
onship to neatly distract us from the
things that truly matter. Enjoy,
everyone.
