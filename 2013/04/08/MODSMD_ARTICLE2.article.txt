# WOMEN'S SPORTS FEATURE SERIES
## AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's women athletes have been successful
in their sports for well beyond just their time on
the Farm. Over the past two seasons, Stanford
women's basketball has had three players taken
in the first round of the WNBA Draft: Kayla Pedersen
'll (Tulsa Shock, 2011, seventh overall), Jeanette Pohlen

'l2 (Indiana Fever, 2011, ninth
overall) and Nnemkadi (Nneka)
Ogwumike 'l2 (Los Angeles
Sparks, 2012, first overall).
Ogwumike has stepped right
into the WNBA without missing a
step. Though she hasn't put up as
dominant numbers in her first
professional season as during her
senior year at Stanford, the for
mer All-American has been a key
member of the Sparks since draft
day.
Ogwumike started in 33 of the
Sparks' 34 games, averaging 14
points and 7.5 rebounds per game.
The elder of the talented Ogwu
mike sisters earned Rookie of the
Year honors for her big first sea
son. Her transition to life as a pro
fessional athlete has been "quite
smooth." After all, not many
coaches teach basketball as seri
ously or as in-depth as Tara Van-
Derveer.
"[Coach VanDerveer] takes
practice very seriously," Ogwu
mike said, "and I am the ultimate

practice player. I feel that's where you truly improve as a
player. All of the things she stressed during my time at
Stanford really helped me understand what it takes to be
a great player and leader."
During the WNBA's offseason, Ogwumike is starring
in the Euroleague. In her first year abroad, Ogwumike is
fifth in the league with an average of 17.5 points per
game for CCC Polkowice, a team located in the city of

Polkowice in southwest Poland.
Not only do professional
leagues provide opportunity for
former Stanford players to make a
living and continue improving
their games, they also can provide
a platform to avenge some tough
losses from their days on the
Farm.
Pohlen played during one of
the most successful eras in Stan
ford history. The Cardinal reached
the Final Four in all four of her col
legiate seasons but never got over
the hump to win the National
Championship. Much of that was
due to the dominance of Connecti
cut and its star, Maya Moore.
But Pohlen finally got her
revenge during the 2012 WNBA
Finals. Pohlen's Indiana Fever was
a big underdog to the stacked Min
nesota Lynx, led by Moore and
two other 2012 London Olympics
gold medalists, but the Fever
pulled off the upset to win the title.

Nnemkadi Ogwumike '12 (above) has
transitioned seamlessly into a WNBA
career with the Los Angeles Sparks.
"Maya's a great player, and she's
going to continue to be great and
continue to grow and get better,"
Pohlen said. "[But] to win against
them and kind of go against what
everybody thought... It was great."

Though Stanford has had count
less Olympians, in both men's and
women's sports, one stands alone for
her fame.
Kerri Walsh Jennings 'OO (former
ly Kerri Walsh), along with her part
ner Misty May-Treanor, has been in
strumental in the rise of beach volley
ball to the Olympic spotlight.
Walsh Jennings starred as an in
door volleyball player at Stanford.
During her time on the Farm, the
Cardinal won two NCAA Champi
onships while Walsh Jennings re
ceived first-team All-American hon
ors in all four of her seasons.

Right after her senior season,
Walsh Jennings took two quarters off
from Stanford to participate in the
2000 Sydney Olympics on the U.S in
door volleyball team, finishing
fourth, but it was in beach volleyball
where she went from volleyball leg
end to international superstar.
"In my entire professional career,
I just felt Stanford gave me just a
great foundation to leap off of,"
Walsh Jennings said. "When you're
on that campus, you're surrounded
by so many people who are chasing
these big dreams, and their stan
dards are set so high, and they're
juggling so many things, and it rubs
off on you. You learn from other peo
ple how they're managing their
stress and their workload, and you're
especially inspired because... they're
brilliant, and they're creative, and
they're freeing themselves out there
to try to achieve great things.
"I feel like I was prepared for not
only the toughness of the journey,
but also it didn't happen overnight,
and I feel like my time on the Farm
showed me that that the process is
really important," she continued. "I
walked into Stanford a really young,
naive, scared 18-year-old, and I left
as an Olympian."
Now, Walsh Jennings' impact has
come full circle. On April 2, Stanford
played its first-ever collegiate sand
volleyball match, defeating Santa
Clara 4-1 at the ACSR Sand Volley
ball Courts.
But the transition from indoor to
beach isn't quite as "smooth" as the
move from Stanford to the profes
sional game; Walsh Jennings still re
members the "humbling" feeling of
transitioning from a four-time All-

American and Olympian in indoor
volleyball to a beach volleyball begin
ner. After that experience, perhaps
some informal coaching is in her fii
ture.

"I would love to go and spend
time with the [Stanford women's vol
leyball players]," Walsh Jennings
said, "get on the sand with them and
learn from them and show them a lit
tle of what I know."

Stanford volleyball does have
some alumnae who have stuck it out
on the indoor side, leaving the sand
and the ocean breeze to Walsh Jen
nings.

Alix Klineman 'll, who like Walsh
Jennings earned All-American
recognition for all four of her colle
giate seasons at Stanford, has taken
her professional career to Europe.
After the Farm, Klineman joined
Scavolini Pesaro, an Italian League
team based in Pesaro, a town just
south of Rimini on the eastern coast of
Italy. For Klineman, the experiment
turned out better than expected.
"To be honest, I was really nerv
ous to play abroad," Klineman said.
"I was worried that I wouldn't like it,
that I would be lonely and that I
wouldn't succeed. I went into my first
season with very low expectations,
and I was surprised in every way
possible. Not only did I land in the
cutest Italian beach town, I made
some lifelong friends and had a suc
cessful rookie season."

Klineman has enjoyed her experi
ence so much that she has stayed in
Italy. This season, Klineman plays
for MC Carnaghi Villa Cortese near
Milan.

Though situated thousands of
miles from Stanford and her home
town of Manhattan Beach, Calif.,
Klineman is not as isolated from the
Farm as one may think.
In her professional career, Kline
man has played against former Stan
ford teammates Foluke Akinradewo
'O9 and Cynthia Barboza 'O9, as well
as Kristin Richards 'O7, who finished
her Cardinal career a year before
Klineman's arrival.
"I stay in touch with most of the
[still-playing] alums mostly through
the national team," Klineman said,
"but it's always fun to run into each
other overseas and catch up."

Though this series honors the an
niversary of Stanford's first women's
national championship, a few of Stan
ford's most recent Olympians are clos
ing in on the Cardinal's next trophy
Stanford women's water polo

head coach John Tanner, after win
ning the NCAA title in 2012, added
three Olympic gold medalists from
last summer's U.S. National Team.

Senior Melissa Seidemann, junior
Annika Dries and freshman Maggie
Steffens all took a year off from Stan
ford to train full time for the
Olympics, and it paid off with gold.
For Steffens, the Olympic water
polo tournament was her own per
sonal coming-out party. The fresh
man was named the most valuable
player of the tournament with an
Olympic-leading 21 goals in six
games, including a game-high five in
the gold medal-winning victory over
Spain.
"She's a great goal scorer," Tan
ner said of Steffens. "She can score in
so many different ways. She's bril
liant reading a goalie and dueling
with a goalie... It's easy at the
Olympics to watch highlights of her
just scoring goals, but she does so
much more to have an impact on a
game."

Steffens and Seidemann have lit
up the scoreboard. Through 24
games, the Olympic duo has com
bined for exactly 100 goals, just three
fewer than their opponents' total for
the entire season, and that's a big
reason why Stanford is 23-1.
Seidemann's offensive skillset got
a big boost from her Olympic experi
ence: Seidemann's goals-per-game
average has increased by over 30
percent to 2.3 this season.
"She has the ability now to take
command in all phases of the game,"
Tanner said. "In the semifinal game
against Australia, which was really
the one really close, intense game at
the Olympics, she controlled the tem
po of the overtime periods almost
singlehandedly."

Though spread out around the
country and the world, each athlete is
staying in touch with Stanford in her
own way.
Walsh Jennings hopes to stop by a
sand volley practice or game some
time soon to offer advice on the tran
sition from indoors to sand. But the
birth of her third child, Scout
Margery Jennings, early Saturday
morning might postpone her coach
ing career for a while.
Klineman finds opportunities to
catch up with Stanford women's vol
leyball whenever she's back in Cali
fornia. In September 2011, Klineman
even joined the squad for a team din
ner during its trip to Los Angeles to
take on USC and UCLA.

Los Angeles was the reunion hub

for Pohlen and Stanford women's
basketball as well.

"I went to their- USC game [in
February]," Pohlen said. "Tara
brought my mom and I into the lock
er room, and we got to say hi to the
team. And I still keep in touch with
the girls."
But no one had it tougher in
March than Ogwumike. In her role
as supportive big sister of junior for
ward Chiney Ogwumike, Nneka has
had some late nights listening to
Stanford games on the radio from
Poland.

"I follow every game," Nneka
said. "It's tough being in Poland and
nine hours ahead, but that never
stops me from keeping up with my
favorite college athlete and the
Card."

As for Steffens, Dries and Seide
mann, well, they just catch up every
time they put on their caps for prac
tice. Reunion talk will have to wait
until after their Stanford careers
end.
