# WOMEN'S SPORTS FEATURE SERIES
## AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's women athletes have been successful
in their sports for well beyond just their time on
the Farm. Over the past two seasons, Stanford
women's basketball has had three players taken
in the first round of the WNBA Draft: Kayla Pedersen
'll (Tulsa Shock, 2011, seventh overall), Jeanette Pohlen

'l2 (Indiana Fever, 2011, ninth
overall) and Nnemkadi (Nneka)
Ogwumike 'l2 (Los Angeles
Sparks, 2012, first overall).
Ogwumike has stepped right
into the WNBA without missing a
step. Though she hasn't put up as
dominant numbers in her first
professional season as during her
senior year at Stanford, the for
mer All-American has been a key
member of the Sparks since draft
day.
Ogwumike started in 33 of the
Sparks' 34 games, averaging 14
points and 7.5 rebounds per game.
The elder of the talented Ogwu
mike sisters earned Rookie of the
Year honors for her big first sea
son. Her transition to life as a pro
fessional athlete has been "quite
smooth." After all, not many
coaches teach basketball as seri
ously or as in-depth as Tara Van-
Derveer.
"[Coach VanDerveer] takes
practice very seriously," Ogwu
mike said, "and I am the ultimate

practice player. I feel that's where you truly improve as a
player. All of the things she stressed during my time at
Stanford really helped me understand what it takes to be
a great player and leader."
During the WNBA's offseason, Ogwumike is starring
in the Euroleague. In her first year abroad, Ogwumike is
fifth in the league with an average of 17.5 points per
game for CCC Polkowice, a team located in the city of

Polkowice in southwest Poland.
Not only do professional
leagues provide opportunity for
former Stanford players to make a
living and continue improving
their games, they also can provide
a platform to avenge some tough
losses from their days on the
Farm.
Pohlen played during one of
the most successful eras in Stan
ford history. The Cardinal reached
the Final Four in all four of her col
legiate seasons but never got over
the hump to win the National
Championship. Much of that was
due to the dominance of Connecti
cut and its star, Maya Moore.
But Pohlen finally got her
revenge during the 2012 WNBA
Finals. Pohlen's Indiana Fever was
a big underdog to the stacked Min
nesota Lynx, led by Moore and
two other 2012 London Olympics
gold medalists, but the Fever
pulled off the upset to win the title.
