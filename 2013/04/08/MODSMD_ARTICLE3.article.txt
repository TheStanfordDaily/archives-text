## Exploring students' genes 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A controversial School of Medi
cine course has given hundreds of
students the opportunity to learn
about genetics in a unique format:
through an analysis of their own
genotype.
In Genetics 210: Genomics and
Personalized Medicine, students are
taught how to examine a DNA se
quence and given the option of
studying their own genetic data.
This personal genotyping can reveal
a student's risk level for different
diseases or previously unknown in
formation about his or her ancestry.
"I want to learn about me and
what's coming up," explained
Kateryna Kozyrytska, a biochem
istry doctoral candidate currently

enrolled in the class. "It's more in
teresting to look at your data than at
some random data."
Before the class first opened for
enrollment, members of the Joint
Genotyping Task Force Committee
composed of philosophers, ethi
cists, physicians and other faculty
members met to discuss the im
plications of the course.
According to Professor of Devel
opment Biology and of Genetics Stu
art Kim, one of the course directors,
faculty members worried that ge
netic discoveries could cause stu
dents additional stress. They even
tually concluded, however, that the
course's benefits outweighed the dis
advantages.
"We do believe that information
is power, and that the power from
knowing counterbalances the stress

from the knowing," he said. "We
made a kind of philosophical decision
that knowledge is power, and that
students should embrace the knowl
edge instead of staying ignorant."
Enrolled students attend several
informed consent sessions about the

legal and ethical implications of
genotyping before the course begins
and can choose to study public geno
type files instead of their own DNA.
However, a survey of the first Genet-
