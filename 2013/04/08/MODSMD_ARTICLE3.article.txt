## Exploring students' genes 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A controversial School of Medi
cine course has given hundreds of
students the opportunity to learn
about genetics in a unique format:
through an analysis of their own
genotype.
In Genetics 210: Genomics and
Personalized Medicine, students are
taught how to examine a DNA se
quence and given the option of
studying their own genetic data.
This personal genotyping can reveal
a student's risk level for different
diseases or previously unknown in
formation about his or her ancestry.
"I want to learn about me and
what's coming up," explained
Kateryna Kozyrytska, a biochem
istry doctoral candidate currently

enrolled in the class. "It's more in
teresting to look at your data than at
some random data."
Before the class first opened for
enrollment, members of the Joint
Genotyping Task Force Committee
composed of philosophers, ethi
cists, physicians and other faculty
members met to discuss the im
plications of the course.
According to Professor of Devel
opment Biology and of Genetics Stu
art Kim, one of the course directors,
faculty members worried that ge
netic discoveries could cause stu
dents additional stress. They even
tually concluded, however, that the
course's benefits outweighed the dis
advantages.
"We do believe that information
is power, and that the power from
knowing counterbalances the stress

from the knowing," he said. "We
made a kind of philosophical decision
that knowledge is power, and that
students should embrace the knowl
edge instead of staying ignorant."
Enrolled students attend several
informed consent sessions about the

legal and ethical implications of
genotyping before the course begins
and can choose to study public geno
type files instead of their own DNA.

ics 210 class revealed that
students who worked with
their own genetic material
outperformed students who
used public files.

Andrew Roos M.S. 'l4
Ph.D. 'l4, who took the class
with his twin brother Thomas
Roos M.S. 'l2 Ph.D. 'lB, said
that the decision to get geno
typed "helped with my en
gagement with the [course]
material."
Both Andrew and Thomas
used the results from the
genotyping to modify their
training regimens in prepar
ing for triathlons. Andrew
said that the modifications
have helped him avoid in
juries that he previously
struggled with.
"Knowing my history of
previous injuries, once I saw
my genetics, it confirmed that
[for] the injuries that I had
gotten previously I was at
a genetic risk for those in
juries," Andrew said.
Though Roos had a posi
tive experience with genotyp
ing, other students expressed
less satisfaction with their ex
perience.

Kim said that students
who are disturbed by the
genotyping results can dis
cuss the results with a genet
ic counselor from 23andme,
the company that provides
the genotyping kits, or a Uni
versity psychiatrist. Accord
ing to Kim, one student spoke
to a genetic counselor during
the first year of the class.

While students are not ex
pected to discuss personal in
formation about their geno
types, Kim noted that in re
cent years an increasing
number of students have cho
sen to share their discoveries
with the class.
"I can remember the two
students who had the most
Neanderthal DNA jumping
up and down saying they
were the most Neanderthal,"
Kim said.

Although the course was
initially designed for medical
students, Kim said that the
class is now comprised of
graduate students, Ph.D. can
didates and even undergrad
uates. He attributed the di
verse range of students to the
course material's new promi
nence in investigative re
search, noting genomics'
practical application in fields
like prescribing appropriate
drug dosages.
"It's absolutely a fascinat
ing and exploding area of re
search right now," Kim said,
adding that genotypes "allow
us to analyze humans and
what makes us different in
being human."
Even as interest surges,
however, some—like Kozyryt
ska's family in Ukraine are
less enthusiastic about the
potential for discovery that
genotyping offers.
"To them, it felt that if
there's no obvious solution to
the problem you learn about,
then you may as not well
learn about the problem, be
cause you can't do anything
about it," Kozyrytska said.

the genotyping kits, or a Uni
versity psychiatrist. Accord
ing to Kim, one student spoke
to a genetic counselor during
the first year of the class.

While students are not ex
pected to discuss personal in
formation about their geno
types, Kim noted that in re
cent years an increasing
number of students have cho
sen to share their discoveries
with the class.
"I can remember the two
students who had the most
Neanderthal DNA jumping
up and down saying they
were the most Neanderthal,"
Kim said.

Although the course was
initially designed for medical
students, Kim said that the
class is now comprised of
graduate students, Ph.D. can
didates and even undergrad
uates. He attributed the di
verse range of students to the
course material's new promi
nence in investigative re
search, noting genomics'
practical application in fields
like prescribing appropriate
drug dosages.
"It's absolutely a fascinat
ing and exploding area of re
search right now," Kim said,
adding that genotypes "allow
us to analyze humans and
what makes us different in
being human."
Even as interest surges,
however, some—like Kozyryt
ska's family in Ukraine are
less enthusiastic about the
potential for discovery that
genotyping offers.
"To them, it felt that if
there's no obvious solution to
the problem you learn about,
then you may as not well
learn about the problem, be
cause you can't do anything
about it," Kozyrytska said.
