# Q&A Jason GALISATUS
## 
### MOLLY VORWERCK DESK EDITOR 
Jason Galisatus 'l5 is the
founder of the LGBT anti-bully
ing group Bay Area Youth Sum
mit (BAYS) and as one of 12
nominees entered for online vot
ing this year potentially the
youngest Individual Community
Grand Marshal in the history of
San Francisco's Gay Pride Pa
rade (SF Pride). BAYS has also

been chosen as a candidate for
Local Organizational Grand
Marshal, while Galisatus was re
cently selected as The Bay Area
Reporter's Best LGBT Youth
Activist under age 25 for his
work with BAYS. The Daily sat
down with Galisatus to discuss
BAYS and his hopes for this
year's SF Pride.

The Stanford Daily (TSD):
First of all, congratulations
on your nomination! How
does the voting process work?
Jason Galisatus (JG): So ba
sically, the organization accepts
nominations by email, so both
my organization and I had been
nominated by the public, and
now the voting goes back to the
public for people to cast their
votes.
TSD: What is the mission of
your organization, BAYS?
JG: It's a really fun endeavor
and something that really allows
me [to] pursue social justice by
empowering fellow LGBT youth
to combat bullying. We host an
annual conference every year, so
the next one is coming up on
May 11 at Aragon High
School in San Mateo [where
Galisatus attended school].
We will be featuring the
keynote speakers Zach
Walls, who spoke at the Dem
ocratic National Convention
on behalf of the Obama cam
paign, as well as the writer of
"Milk" Oscar-winning
screenwriter Dustin Lance
Black and then a number
of other really great people.
Our main goal is to really
make LGBT youth an em
powered group within socie
ty. I think that the youth in
the LGBT community have a
lot to offer, and I would like
for my organization to be an
impetus to engage youth
within society and within the
political process. When youth
are empowered, that does a
lot for combating bullying.
They feel compelled to stand
up to bullies in their school
and reject intolerance, which
I think is the ultimate goal of
our organization.

TSD: How did you found
BAYS?

JG: During my sopho
more year of high school, I
brought together all the
school GSAs [Gay Straight
Alliance clubs] in my school
district to sort of share ideas
and collaborate and see how
we could pool resources.
Once we gathered the group
together, we decided we
wanted to expand this to put
on a full conference, and so
we had our first one on April
23, 2011 at Aragon High
School. We had about 200 at
tendees, and we wanted to
continue to do it, but after
that, we decided to expand
the organization and file for
501c3 status, which is a non
profit incorporation for the
IRS.

TSD: Besides your annual
conference, how else is
BAYS involved with the
LGBT youth community?
JG: Aside from putting on
this big conference, we are
working on putting together
something called the Middle
School Safety Initiative,
which is actually a program
that is currently in research
and development. We're
working with a research
group down in Palo Alto to
get some more information
on how LGBT students in
middle school are being

treated and how we can best
meet their needs.

And from that research,
we are going to develop an
anti-bullying curriculum that
high school students can give
to middle school students in
the classroom. It's a really
good program that not only
teaches middle school stu
dents how to be more accept
ing to others, but also for
high school students to really
make a difference in their
communities.
TSD: So now let's talk
about SF Pride. Have you
ever been involved with the
parade before?
JG: I've never been in
volved with the organization,
and I'm not currently in
volved with the organization,
but in the past my organiza
tion has marched within the
parade, and I used to work
for former mayors Gavin
Newsom and Ed Lee as an
LGBT Community Liaison in
high school, so I've planned
their contingents. I've done a
lot of work in Pride, but I've
never actually worked with
Pride itself.

TSD: What happens if
you're selected as SF
Pride's Grand Marshal?
JG: If I win Grand Mar
shal, then I'll have my own

contingent and they give you
a car and you get to headline
the parade. So if I win, I'll be
in it, and even if I don't win,
I'm sure that my organiza
tion will be participating any
way.

TSD: How stiff is your com
petition?
JG: The other people who
have gotten nominated are
some pretty fantastic mem
bers of the community. Mar
lena is one of them, and she
owned the longest running
drag show in the United
States that recently closed
she's a community hero.
As well as Marlena, a num

ber of other community lead
ers and business owners are
up for selection. In terms of
organizations, we're up
against a lot of fantastic
groups that cover a broad
range of issues within the
LGBT community, every
thing from H.I.V and AIDS
to funding LBGT projects
that further equality
We have some fantastic
contenders, so we'll see what
happens, but either way it's
an honor to be nominated.
TSD: What is the signifi
cance of SF Pride in your
eyes?
JG: The first Gay Pride

Parade happened a year af
ter the Stonewall Riots. The
riots occurred in New York
City in 1969 when the police
raided a gay bar, and the peo
ple rioted against the police
and resisted arrest. So the
parade started annually after
that to commemorate these
brave community members.
In my opinion, Pride is a cel
ebration of LGBT heritage. I
think the community has re
ally been shrouded by stigma
and by oppression, and so it's
really [a] statement of our
identity.
