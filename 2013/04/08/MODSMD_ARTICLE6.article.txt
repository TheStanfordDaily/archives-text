# Special fees challenged by ASSU, students
## Student group requests have increased to $2.5 million this year 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fifty-five voluntary student organizations (VSOs) will
seek a total of $2,426,309.29 in special fees during this
year's ASSU elections as part of a process that has come
under increased scrutiny in recent years.
The 50 undergraduate and five joint VSOs seeking spe
cial fees on April 11 and 12 have all put forward budgets
exceeding the $6,000 limit granted by the general fees
process. If the required line-by-line budget petition is ap
proved by a majority of all voters and more than 15 per
cent of the relevant student body constituency, the amount
sought after is divided evenly among that student body
and added directly to tuition fees.
Among those 55 VSOs, six groups two a cappella
groups, two cultural groups, one publication and the First-
Generation Low Income Partnership did not receive
funding last year.
The total amount of special fees sought has grown an
nuallyâ€” rising from $ll9 per quarter per student last
year to $l4O per quarter per student this year as more
groups are voted in and budgets expand. Because special
fees groups do not have to petition if they do not increase
their budget by more than a set percentage from the pre
vious year 7.1 percent for the 2013 ballot many ex
pand marginally every year.
This year's petitions are reflective of these consistent,
incremental fee increases. Only eight groups have lowered
their request by more than 2 percent but nearly half of this
year's proposals request increases of less than 7.1 percent.
"Special fees is a very important process ... because it's
like a direct democracy," said ASSU Executive candidate
Billy Gallagher 'l4. "[Unlike] general fees funding where
it's determined by the senate ... the students directly vote
for [special fees]. I think that's a very positive thing. Even
though students don't necessarily take it as seriously or do
as much homework as they should, I think the process is
still really important."
Gallagher is a Daily staffer.
The only group that requested
more than a 10 percent increase
was the Stanford Solar Car Proj
ect, a team of about 50 students
that is requesting $98,500 a 78
percent increase from last year
to cover shipping and accommoda
tion costs for the World Solar
Challenge.
The Stanford Daily is request
ing $98,730.13 from special fees, a
seven percent increase from last
year.
While he conceded that the op
portunity to vote means that high
er special fees are not necessarily
unfair for students, Gallagher ar
gued that unused special fees
money means that students do not
receive the value that VSOs prom
ise in their special fee proposals.
According to ASSU Assistant Fi
nancial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4, groups end
up not spending 25 to 30 percent
of their special fees money every
year.
Gallagher and his running
mate, Dan Ashton 'l4 proposed a
Constitutional amendment at a
March 12 Senate meeting that
would have reformed the special
fees process so that money was
reclaimed by the general ASSU if
unspent at the end of the year.
On the other hand, Elizabeth
Patino 'l4, an ASSU Executive
vice presidential candidate, voiced
support for the current special
fees system. Patino also serves as
a Student Activities and Leader
ship peer advisor.

"We really strongly support
the reserve system," she said. "It
provides stability for [Stanford

Student Enterprises, the financial
arm of the ASSU]... We under
stand it's a very important re
source for them to have."

Others, including Hunter Ko
dama 'l4, the incoming financial
officer for Dance Marathon, and
lan Chan 'l4, financial officer of
the Society for International Af
fairs at Stanford (SIAS) and for
mer Undergraduate Senate treas
urer, argued that fee reserves are
often important for groups' sus
tainability and programming.
Chan said that SIAS, which
supports Stanford's traveling
Model United Nations team, keeps
a large reserve account primarily
as a buffer in case they don't re
ceive special fees, which happened
in the 2011 general election.
Kodoma, who also serves as a
peer advisor for Student Activi
ties and Leadership, said that
some groups need large reserves
to pay honoraria expenses before
ticket revenues come in, to pay for
unexpected costs or to take advan
tage of extraordinary opportuni
ties.
Najla Gomez 'l4, ASSU Execu
tive presidential candidate and
Patino's running mate, said that
reserves from special fees are
needed for groups to fall back on.
"Student groups work hard to
get special fees," she said. "They
most definitely should not be taken
away from them."
Scrutiny of special fees
After the Stanford Flipside suc
cessfully petitioned for a Segway
in an explicit attempt to mock the
special fees process in 2011, stu
dents and ASSU representatives
expressed concern about the loop
holes for unnecessary and exorbi
tant purchases in YSO budget re
quests.
"I don't think we should try to

over-legislate to fix these issues
when every student has the ability
to vote on them and each student
already has a voice on whether
money is being spent the right
way or the wrong way," Gallagher
said. "All of this potential legisla
tion might seem like a good idea,
but it would come down to a lot of
gray lines."
The ASSU has struggled with
interpreting special fees legisla
tion before. The ASSU Constitu
tion states that "student organiza
tions that receive a Special Fee
may not deprive any member of
the Association of any or all of its
services unless that member has
obtained a refund of that organiza
tion's fee."
In a presentation for the AS
SU Undergraduate Senate this
fall, Trusheim challenged senators
to think critically about this re
quirement in relation to groups
that charge for their services and
serve only a small proportion of
the student body.
VSOs with barriers to member
ship entry can still petition for
special fees. Alternative Spring

Break (ASB), a program in which
roughly 3.5 percent of undergrad
uates participate, is requesting
nearly $l9 per student in special
fees this year.
"All of our trips are open to all
undergraduates. Everyone is wel
come and encouraged to apply,"
said Stephanie May 'l4, ASB's fi
nancial officer. "We hold events for
the greater community ... and we
encourage all of our leaders and
participants to come back and
spread the word.
According to May, ASB's re
quest increased five percent this
year to cover inflation and rising
gas and travel costs but still will
probably fall short of their actual
expenses.
Rising refund rates
At an orientation seminar host
ed for incoming ASSU officers this
past fall, Trusheim encouraged
senators to consider the disparity
between the special fee sums
levied on undergraduate and grad
uate students. Special fees this
year cost each undergraduate
$324 more than their graduate

counterparts, totaling about $2
million for undergraduates and
$300,000 for graduate students.
Next year, graduate students
will not pay a fee for groups like
The Stanford Daily, KZSU and oth
er VSOs that offer performances,
classes and events to both under
graduates and graduate students.
"You do have primarily under
graduates in a lot of these student
groups, so that makes sense that it
is split that way," Gallagher said.
"I think most undergraduates are
reasonably happy with the way the
special fees process works"
This year's refund rates, how
ever, tell a different story regard
ing student satisfaction. On April
6, Trusheim sent an email to the
Undergraduate Senate informing
them that, for many undergradu
ate VSOs, refund requests are ap
proaching the 10 percent thresh
old at which refunds will be debit
ed directly from a group's reserve
rather than the ASSU's general
buffer fund. According to
Trusheim's email, every VSO has
received refund requests from at
least 7.5 percent of the undergrad
uate population.

Paul Benigeri 'l5 has even pub
lished a script that sets default
special fee votes to "no" instead of
"yes" to help students opt out of
paying them.

Despite this, Kodama has never
voted down or refunded a special
fee.

"My personal stance is every
group that gets some special fee, at
least that I've seen so far, affects a
large number of students on cam
pus and adds to the overall under
graduate experience," he ex
plained. "A lot of them couldn't ex
ist without special fees."
