# Special fees challenged by ASSU, students
## Student group requests have increased to $2.5 million this year 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fifty-five voluntary student organizations (VSOs) will
seek a total of $2,426,309.29 in special fees during this
year's ASSU elections as part of a process that has come
under increased scrutiny in recent years.
The 50 undergraduate and five joint VSOs seeking spe
cial fees on April 11 and 12 have all put forward budgets
exceeding the $6,000 limit granted by the general fees
process. If the required line-by-line budget petition is ap
proved by a majority of all voters and more than 15 per
cent of the relevant student body constituency, the amount
sought after is divided evenly among that student body
and added directly to tuition fees.
Among those 55 VSOs, six groups two a cappella
groups, two cultural groups, one publication and the First-
Generation Low Income Partnership did not receive
funding last year.
The total amount of special fees sought has grown an
nuallyâ€” rising from $ll9 per quarter per student last
year to $l4O per quarter per student this year as more
groups are voted in and budgets expand. Because special
fees groups do not have to petition if they do not increase
their budget by more than a set percentage from the pre
vious year 7.1 percent for the 2013 ballot many ex
pand marginally every year.
This year's petitions are reflective of these consistent,
incremental fee increases. Only eight groups have lowered
their request by more than 2 percent but nearly half of this
year's proposals request increases of less than 7.1 percent.
"Special fees is a very important process ... because it's
like a direct democracy," said ASSU Executive candidate
Billy Gallagher 'l4. "[Unlike] general fees funding where
it's determined by the senate ... the students directly vote
for [special fees]. I think that's a very positive thing. Even
though students don't necessarily take it as seriously or do
as much homework as they should, I think the process is
still really important."
