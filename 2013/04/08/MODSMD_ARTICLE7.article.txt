## Robotics program proposed Plan to mate a robotics major gains faculty support 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The chance to declare as a ro
botics major could be just around
the corner for interested students,
as a proposal led by Eric Smalls 'l6
continues to gain traction among
undergraduates and faculty alike.
Smalls, founder of the Stanford
Robotics Club, initially planned to
pursue robotics as an individually
designed major within the School of
Engineering. Surprised by the high
level of student interest in robotics,
however, he framed the creation of
a robotics major as an opportunity
that would appeal both to curious
students seeking to formalize their
learning and to those already expe
rienced in the field.
"There was a group of students
who had the opportunity to do ro
botics in high school, but there
were also a large amount of stu
dents who had not had that experi
ence," Smalls said about the robot
ics club. "There was a lot of teach
ing, but not enough teachers."
Having conferred with Associ
ate Professor of Mechanical Engi
neering Allison Okamura M.S. '96
Ph.D. 'OO, Smalls learned that an
intake of approximately 10 inter
ested students per year would be
required to sustain the new major.
A survey sent out to several mail
ing lists to gauge student interest
and solicit feedback on Smalls' pro
posed major requirements pro
duced around 30 interested stu
dents as well as advice on making
the major more inclusive and
