## Robotics program proposed Plan to mate a robotics major gains faculty support 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The chance to declare as a ro
botics major could be just around
the corner for interested students,
as a proposal led by Eric Smalls 'l6
continues to gain traction among
undergraduates and faculty alike.
Smalls, founder of the Stanford
Robotics Club, initially planned to
pursue robotics as an individually
designed major within the School of
Engineering. Surprised by the high
level of student interest in robotics,
however, he framed the creation of
a robotics major as an opportunity
that would appeal both to curious
students seeking to formalize their
learning and to those already expe
rienced in the field.
"There was a group of students
who had the opportunity to do ro
botics in high school, but there
were also a large amount of stu
dents who had not had that experi
ence," Smalls said about the robot
ics club. "There was a lot of teach
ing, but not enough teachers."
Having conferred with Associ
ate Professor of Mechanical Engi
neering Allison Okamura M.S. '96
Ph.D. 'OO, Smalls learned that an
intake of approximately 10 inter
ested students per year would be
required to sustain the new major.
A survey sent out to several mail
ing lists to gauge student interest
and solicit feedback on Smalls' pro
posed major requirements pro
duced around 30 interested stu
dents as well as advice on making
the major more inclusive and
broadly appealing.
Smalls also solicited feedback
from Professor of Electrical Engi
neering Robert Dutton, who said he
was impressed by Smalls' determi
nation to make Stanford "a magnet
attracting people with robotics in
terests."
Though Dutton wouldn't esti
mate how many students would be
interested in a robotics major, he
expressed confidence that a robot
ics major would receive serious con
sideration if Smalls can demon
strate sustained student interest.
"Student interest, historically,
has been very effective in getting
academic departments to move in
directions that are more aligned
with student interest," Dutton said.
"Eric is stirring things up by trying
to find students. If there are
enough students with interest and
that interest can be defined in a
way that a better curricula can be
structured, I'm sure that is going to
happen."
Evan Clark 'l4, a Robotics Club
member, estimated that approxi
mately 10 to 15 students would de
clare a robotics major during the
program's first year, though he ex
pected the number to increase over
time.

Though Clark is currently major
ing in computer science (CS), he said
that he would prefer to pursue a ro
botics major if it were established in
the near future.
"Having a dedicated robotics ma
jor would be awesome because you
could get advice about those classes,
you wouldn't have to take some of
the classes you didn't want to and
you could spend a lot more time play
ing with robots," Clark said.
Smalls, Dutton and Clark ac
knowledged that elements of a ro
botics curriculum are currently of
fered in several departments in
cluding CS, mechanical engineering
(ME) and electrical engineering
(EE) but emphasized the value
of a cohesive and comprehensive ro
botics major.
"I think as more students move
away from a single track in CS or
EE or ME, they really see the value
of getting a taste of the three flavors
and really getting a sense of how ap
plicable those skills are to almost
anything," Smalls said.
Clark agreed that a multidisci
plinary approach to robotics could
help students gain a more complete
understanding of the subject.
"You can approach it from a the
oretical control side with CS, and
it's a lot of algorithms and planning,
but you aren't building robots per
se," Clark said. "You can also ap
proach it from the mechanical engi
neering side, but you're doing the
mechanical design and you don't re

ally know how to program [robots],
so it's kind of hard if you want to do
both to walk that line well."
Clark, Smalls and Dutton all em
phasized the unique role that stu
dents have played in shaping the
plan for a robotics major, which
Smalls hopes will inspire more stu
dents to consider the program.
"Just being an organic and stu
dent-done thing, it makes it like it's
what we want [and] not what the
University is telling us to do,"
Smalls said. "It makes it more like a
conversation among students about
what we want from robotics and
what robotics can be at Stanford,
and I think that's really impor
tant."

anything," Smalls said.
Clark agreed that a multidisci
plinary approach to robotics could
help students gain a more complete
understanding of the subject.
"You can approach it from a the
oretical control side with CS, and
it's a lot of algorithms and planning,
but you aren't building robots per
se," Clark said. "You can also ap
proach it from the mechanical engi
neering side, but you're doing the
mechanical design and you don't re

ally know how to program [robots],
so it's kind of hard if you want to do
both to walk that line well."
Clark, Smalls and Dutton all em
phasized the unique role that stu
dents have played in shaping the
plan for a robotics major, which
Smalls hopes will inspire more stu
dents to consider the program.
"Just being an organic and stu
dent-done thing, it makes it like it's
what we want [and] not what the
University is telling us to do,"
Smalls said. "It makes it more like a
conversation among students about
what we want from robotics and
what robotics can be at Stanford,
and I think that's really impor
tant."
