# SOLVING THE SPARTANS
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
After over a month of inconsis
tency, the Stanford offense finally
showed what it is capable of at its
best over the weekend against
USC. Now, the challenge is to car
ry that offensive performance into
the future in combination with its
strong and reliable pitching staff
to string together more wins.
The Cardinal (16-10, 5-4 Pac
-12) will try to keep hold of its mo
mentum on the road through Tues
day's non-conference matchup
with the San Jose State Spartans
(11-21, 5-4 WAC).
The Cardinal averaged just un
der seven runs per game during its
three-game series against the Tro
jans over the weekend, a very good
sign for a team that averaged un
der four runs per game going into
the series. The strong weekend in
cluded a 10-run, 17-hit offensive
explosion on Saturday evening in
which eight of the nine hitters in
the Stanford starting lineup col
lected at least one hit.
Facing a USC pitching staff
with an inflated 4.93 collective
ERA definitely aided the Cardinal
hitters and helped them put good
numbers on the board. The offense
will look to benefit from more of
the same against SJSU, whose
pitching staff limps into the con
test with a 5.67 ERA and a 1.66
WHII) while giving up over six
runs per game.
No regular starting pitcher on
San Jose State's has an ERA be
low 4.43. The Spartan pitchers also

walk almost as many hitters as
they strikeout, having issued 121
walks and 40 hit batsmen while
recording 146 strikeouts.
The Stanford offense will also
be greatly boosted by the return of
slugging junior outfielder Austin
Wilson. Wilson appeared in two
games against USC over the week
end, his first games back since an
elbow injury against Rice in the
season-opener sidelined him for al
most two months.
Wilson's return to form could be
the catalyst that the Stanford of
fense needs to keep the offense
alive. Batting eighth and playing as
designated hitter in the series fi
nale at USC, Wilson went 2-4 with
a single, a double and two RBIs.

As a sophomore last year, the
big outfielder hit at a respectable
.285 clip and finished fifth in the
Pac-12 in home runs with 10. He al
so led all Stanford hitters with 15
games in which he recorded multi
ple RBIs.
If Wilson can replicate his past
success, the Cardinal offense will
greatly benefit from the added
power potential in the middle of
the lineup.
Stanford's pitching will have its
hands full trying to contain a Spar
tans lineup that is hitting a solid
.284 and averaging just under 10
hits a game.
Seven SJSU hitters with regu
lar playing time have batting aver
ages of over .280, led by junior

Matt Carroll and his .369 average.
The 6-foot-6 first baseman takes
full advantage of his opportuni
ties at the plate, having already
driven in 29 runs on just 38 hits
over the course of the young sea
son. In comparison, Stanford's
leading RBI man, outfielder
Austin Slater, has collected 17 RBI
on 31 hits.
The Stanford pitching staff is
well equipped to meet that chal
lenge. All of Stanford's pitchers
have an ERA below 4.02, with the
team mark sitting at a stingy 2.60.
The Cardinal averages eight
strikeouts and fewer than three
walks allowed per game. It simply
does not allow opposing runners to
get on base easily, as evidenced by
its 1.15 WHIP and .228 batting av
erage against.

After over a month of inconsis
tency, the Stanford offense finally
showed what it is capable of at its
best over the weekend against
USC. Now, the challenge is to car
ry that offensive performance into
the future in combination with its
strong and reliable pitching staff
to string together more wins.
The Cardinal (16-10, 5-4 Pac
-12) will try to keep hold of its mo
mentum on the road through Tues
day's non-conference matchup
with the San Jose State Spartans
(11-21, 5-4 WAC).
The Cardinal averaged just un
der seven runs per game during its
three-game series against the Tro
jans over the weekend, a very good
sign for a team that averaged un
der four runs per game going into
the series. The strong weekend in
cluded a 10-run, 17-hit offensive
explosion on Saturday evening in
which eight of the nine hitters in
the Stanford starting lineup col
lected at least one hit.
Facing a USC pitching staff
with an inflated 4.93 collective
ERA definitely aided the Cardinal
hitters and helped them put good
numbers on the board. The offense
will look to benefit from more of
the same against SJSU, whose
pitching staff limps into the con
test with a 5.67 ERA and a 1.66
WHII) while giving up over six
runs per game.
No regular starting pitcher on
San Jose State's has an ERA be
low 4.43. The Spartan pitchers also

walk almost as many hitters as
they strikeout, having issued 121
walks and 40 hit batsmen while
recording 146 strikeouts.
The Stanford offense will also
be greatly boosted by the return of
slugging junior outfielder Austin
Wilson. Wilson appeared in two
games against USC over the week
end, his first games back since an
elbow injury against Rice in the
season-opener sidelined him for al
most two months.
Wilson's return to form could be
the catalyst that the Stanford of
fense needs to keep the offense
alive. Batting eighth and playing as
designated hitter in the series fi
nale at USC, Wilson went 2-4 with
a single, a double and two RBIs.

As a sophomore last year, the
big outfielder hit at a respectable
.285 clip and finished fifth in the
Pac-12 in home runs with 10. He al
so led all Stanford hitters with 15
games in which he recorded multi
ple RBIs.
If Wilson can replicate his past
success, the Cardinal offense will
greatly benefit from the added
power potential in the middle of
the lineup.
Stanford's pitching will have its
hands full trying to contain a Spar
tans lineup that is hitting a solid
.284 and averaging just under 10
hits a game.
Seven SJSU hitters with regu
lar playing time have batting aver
ages of over .280, led by junior

Matt Carroll and his .369 average.
The 6-foot-6 first baseman takes
full advantage of his opportuni
ties at the plate, having already
driven in 29 runs on just 38 hits
over the course of the young sea
son. In comparison, Stanford's
leading RBI man, outfielder
Austin Slater, has collected 17 RBI
on 31 hits.
The Stanford pitching staff is
well equipped to meet that chal
lenge. All of Stanford's pitchers
have an ERA below 4.02, with the
team mark sitting at a stingy 2.60.
The Cardinal averages eight
strikeouts and fewer than three
walks allowed per game. It simply
does not allow opposing runners to
get on base easily, as evidenced by
its 1.15 WHIP and .228 batting av
erage against.
