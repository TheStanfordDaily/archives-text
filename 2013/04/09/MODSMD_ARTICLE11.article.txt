## Card takes one from powerhouse 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
Normally, a single victory over the
course of a long season would not mean
anything more than the next, simply
representing a single notch in the win
column. However, though Sunday's win
won't define Stanford's season, picking
up a win over No. 2 Arizona State Sun
Devils could be a needed boost to post
season aspirations and confidence.

After being outscored by the Sun
Devils 23-8 over the first two games of
its weekend series, No. 14 Stanford (27-
12,5-7 Pac-12) turned the tables on Ari
zona State (36-4,7-2 Pac-12) in Sunday's
series finale, stunning the Sun Devils 4-
3. In front of an enthusiastic home
crowd, Stanford pulled off the upset be
hind solid pitching and a balanced offen
sive display.
With any hope of a victory resting on
the Cardinal's ability to mitigate ASU's
potent lineup, senior Teagan Gerhart
delivered a standout performance in the
circle. A day after giving up 10 earned
runs and seven walks in a 12-6 loss, Ger
hart (15-6) largely shut down the na
tion's highest scoring offense, allowing
only six hits and three earned runs to
earn the complete-game victory.
Gerhart's effort was particularly im
pressive considering the potent ASU
lineup. The Sun Devils boast eight bat
ters with at least 20 RBl's, six hitters
with at least five home runs, and an
overall team batting average of .352,
easily tops in the Pac-12. However, on
Sunday against Gerhart, the Sun Devils
hit .214 while managing only two extra
base hits.
Gerhart's outing began similarly to
her first start of the weekend, as the
righty gave up a two-run home run to
Sun Devil shortstop Cheyenne Coyle,
her 14th of the season, in the top of the
first inning. However, Gerhart buckled
down, allowing only one more run over
the final six innings of her 135-pitch
complete game victory.
"You have to hit every pitch [against
ASU]," Gerhart said. "One pitch over
the plate and it's over the fence. So it's
very stressful to make sure you hit the
spot every time ... You have to work both
sides of the plate, up and down, and just
have to keep them honest with every
pitch."
Stanford's offensive production at
the plate also helped key Sunday's upset
over ASU. In the 4-3 victory, seven Car
dinal managed hits off of ASU starter
Dallas Escobedo. Sophomore left fielder
Leah White continued to provide clutch
hits for the Cardinal with an RBI single
over the head of Coyle in the bottom of
the fourth inning to plate the game-win
ning run.

Sophomore right fielder
Cassandra Roulund also had
a strong weekend, hitting
.500 with three RBIs during
the three game series. In
particular, Roulund turned
in one of the best perform
ances of her entire career in

the first game of the series.
Roulund went 3-4 with three
RBIs and three runs scored
in the Cardinal's 12-6 loss.
After singling in the bot
tom of the fourth inning,
Roulund flashed some of her
own power against ASU re
liever Mackenzie Popescue.
In consecutive at-bats in the
fifth and seventh innings,
Roulund blasted home runs
to right field, marking
Roulund's first multi-homer

game in her time on the
Farm.
After emerging as a full
time starter midway
through her freshman sea
son last year, Roulund has
become one of the leaders
for the team's young core.
While youth and the lack of
experience may be seen as a
disadvantage for some
teams, Roulund believes oth
erwise.
"It works in our advan
tage," Rouland said, "be
cause everybody just has
this excitement and passion
to play. And we really are co
hesive, we really work well
together, and we just kind of
click... We really love it."
One thing is for certain,
though, as Stanford enters
the second half of Pac-12
play: Stanford showed that it
can take a game from the
class of the conference.
Stanford will host local
foe San Jose State in a mid
week non-conference game
on Wednesday before enter
ing its bye weekend. First
pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m.
