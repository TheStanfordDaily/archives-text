# OFFENSE FIRES BACK

The Flash? The Jet? Slash? X-factor?
All of those nicknames have described game
changing football players at some point or another, but
none of them quite fit the role that Stanford football
head coach David Shaw sees for junior Kelsey Young.
"On our' board which we put where guys are at dif
ferent positions," Shaw said, "there's one space that
just says 'Kelsey' It's not at running back, it's not at
receiver; it's just 'Kelsey.' And it's our jobs eveiy sin
gle day, practice and games, to make sure that we put
him in positions to make plays, no matter where that
is."
A variety of different options to get Young into the
game plan were on display at Saturday's open prac
tice. In a session that focused on third downs and
short yardage, Young lined up all over the field and got
the ball in a few ways, including wide receiver screens
and outside sweeps.
And Young and the offense came to play. Junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan, whose play Shaw called
"phenomenal," pumped up the crowd with two perfect
deep passes early in the scrimmage portion of practice

to junior wide receiver Ty Montgomery and sopho
more wide receiver Michael Rector. The two speed
sters, Stanford's fastest pure receivers, could be big
factors in 2013 if Hogan keeps improving his deep
passing game.
Stanford's defense certainly took notice. Accord
ing to fifth-year senior outside linebacker Trent Mur
phy the defense didn't have quite the same dominant
effort it has come to expect.
"We had a really good performance on Thursday,"
Murphy said. "Defense had a great practice [Thurs
day] and offense came out here [today] with a little ex
tra chip on their shoulder."
The climax of Saturday's open practice was a final
six-play short-yardage session between the first two
units of the offense and the defense.
After five closely contested short-yardage plays,
the offense led 3-2 behind the powerful running of
fifth-year senior fullback Ryan Hewitt. For the last
play, Shaw put the ball on the 1-yard line for a final
showdown between the starting offense and starting
defense.
Hogan handed to Hewitt, who met a wall of de-

fenders at the goal line and
was tackled short of the end
zone. But, in a twist of fate
reminiscent, yet opposite, of
the Notre Dame game, the
linesman ran in with his hands
in the ah* to signal that Hewitt
had scored.
When asked if he had
scored on the close play, He
witt was noncommittal.
"I don't know," Hewitt
said. "Apparently, yes. You
can't tell when you're running
the bah."
Murphy was less sure
from his view on the defensive
side of the ball.
"Replay might have over
turned it," Murphy said, "but
they always say if it's close or
neutral then offense always
gets the victory. We've gotta
put a little more emphasis
[an] exclamation point on

that one."
In the end, only the judg
ment of that one referee mat
tered. And his call gave the of
fense a 4-2 victory, and per
haps most importantly, a
front-row view of the de
fense's 20-pushup punish
ment.
For the team as a whole,
the best news may have been
that Stanford avoided the in
jury bug that has plagued
some of the Cardinal's confer
ence rivals, especially USC.
Junior running back Re
mound Wright "got banged
up," according to Shaw, but
everyone else is either
healthy or on the mend.
Stanford's spring practice
comes to a close Saturday with
the Cardinal & White Spring
Game at Stanford Stadium. It
will be the last time in pads for
the squad until preseason
camp this summer. Start time
is scheduled for 3 p.m.
