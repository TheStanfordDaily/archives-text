The Flash? The Jet? Slash? X-factor?
All of those nicknames have described game
changing football players at some point or another, but
none of them quite fit the role that Stanford football
head coach David Shaw sees for junior Kelsey Young.
"On our' board which we put where guys are at dif
ferent positions," Shaw said, "there's one space that
just says 'Kelsey' It's not at running back, it's not at
receiver; it's just 'Kelsey.' And it's our jobs eveiy sin
gle day, practice and games, to make sure that we put
him in positions to make plays, no matter where that
is."
A variety of different options to get Young into the
game plan were on display at Saturday's open prac
tice. In a session that focused on third downs and
short yardage, Young lined up all over the field and got
the ball in a few ways, including wide receiver screens
and outside sweeps.
And Young and the offense came to play. Junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan, whose play Shaw called
"phenomenal," pumped up the crowd with two perfect
deep passes early in the scrimmage portion of practice

to junior wide receiver Ty Montgomery and sopho
more wide receiver Michael Rector. The two speed
sters, Stanford's fastest pure receivers, could be big
factors in 2013 if Hogan keeps improving his deep
passing game.
Stanford's defense certainly took notice. Accord
ing to fifth-year senior outside linebacker Trent Mur
phy the defense didn't have quite the same dominant
effort it has come to expect.
"We had a really good performance on Thursday,"
Murphy said. "Defense had a great practice [Thurs
day] and offense came out here [today] with a little ex
tra chip on their shoulder."
The climax of Saturday's open practice was a final
six-play short-yardage session between the first two
units of the offense and the defense.
After five closely contested short-yardage plays,
the offense led 3-2 behind the powerful running of
fifth-year senior fullback Ryan Hewitt. For the last
play, Shaw put the ball on the 1-yard line for a final
showdown between the starting offense and starting
defense.
Hogan handed to Hewitt, who met a wall of de-
