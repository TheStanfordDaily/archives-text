## Stanford rolls without Gibbs 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Even in the absence of jun
ior co-captain Nicole Gibbs,
Stanford women's tennis
cruised past the Oregon Ducks
(12-8, 1-7 Pac-12) Saturday,
blanking them 7-0 in dominant
fashion.

Gibbs, who watched from the side due to a minor in
jury, is currently making her way back to the top level at
which she's used to performing.
"I'm addressing all of the shortcomings I'm aware of
physically and mentally and working my way back to a
confident state," Gibbs said. "I'm trying to get back to the
form I'm used to playing and the form the team is used to
seeing me compete in."
The No. 14 doubles pair of Gibbs and fellow junior co
captain Kristie Ahn usually represents the No. 12 Cardi
nal (13-3, 6-1 Pac-12) on the top doubles court together,
but the lineup was shuffled for this match without Gibbs.
The No. 80 duo of senior Stacey Tan and sophomore Ellen
Tsay played Oregon's Nicole Long and Patricia Skowron
ski on court No. 1.

Junior Kristie Ahn (above) has continued to
impress in her comeback season. Ahn, who
missed significant time in 2011 and 2012,
won her singles match against Oregon on
court No. 1 in decisive fashion, 6-2, 6-2.
Though Tan and Tsay fell
in a close 8-7 (3) battle, the
Cardinal captured the doubles
point nonetheless. Ahn and
junior Amelia Herring were
victorious over Lana Buttner
and Pascale Neubert 8-5 on
court No. 2. Senior co-cap
tain Natalie Dillon and fresh
man Krista Hardebeck had
similar success over Sofia
Hager and Brooke Hughes
on court No. 3 with an 8-4
win to clinch the point.
"Some girls aren't as
strong in singles, but are re
ally strong in doubles,"
Hardebeck said, referring
the Ducks' first doubles
team. "Our focus was moving
at the net, being aggressive
with our volleys, and work
ing together as a team."
Hardebeck was dominant
in singles play, where she
ranks 14th in the country easily
defeating SkowronsM 6-3,6-1.
"[Skowronski] is a great
player who hits really hard,"
Hardebeck said. "I had to fo
cus on making sure I stayed
consistent while placing the
ball well."

The rest of the singles
lineup also had little difficul
ty moving past their Oregon
opponents. No. 93 Tan
trounced Hager to seize a 6-
1, 6-2 win on court No. 3,
while the 30th-ranked Ahn
clinched the match when she
defeated No. 102 Long 6-2,6-
2 at first singles.
Ahn has made a come
back of her own this season.
Missing the end of her fresh
man season and much of her
sophomore season with an
ankle injury, her inaugural
victory on the top court this
weekend signified another
big milestone in her impres
sive return.
The back of the Cardinal
lineup posted similar wins.
The 51st-ranked Tsay
crushed Buttner 6-1, 6-2 at
the No. 4 spot, while fresh
man Lindsey Kostas cap
tured a 6-3, 6-3 triumph over
Hughes on the last court.
Dillon defeated Rabea
Stueckemann on court No. 5,
6-4, 6-3 to finish off the
sweep.
The Cardinal has now
won nine of its last 10 match
es and will face Hawaii Tues
day on its home courts. The
contest will be Stanford's last
home match of the season.
The women travel to take

on the Arizona schools this
weekend and cross-town ri
val Cal the weekend after.
The Stanford women will
then prepare for postseason
play in their quest for a na
tional championship.
A victory over unranked
Hawaii, a team that the Car
dinal defeated 6-1 in its last
meeting in an exhibition
match at Hawaii in Novem
ber 2011, is crucial in terms
of maintaining team confi
dence and momentum.
"Usually the tougher the
team, the more everyone has
to focus," Hardebeck said.
"We really treat all oppo
nents the same though. If
you get too far ahead of
yourself, you could potential
ly suffer a bad loss."
The goal to emphatically
close out the season in the
next few weeks applies to
Hardebeck just as it applies
to the whole team.
"First we need to keep
our energy up," Hardebeck
said, "and secondly we need to
support each other."
The Card's showdown
against Hawaii will take place
at 1:30 p.m. on Thesday at the
Taube Family Tennis Center.

fashion.

Gibbs, who watched from the side due to a minor in
jury, is currently making her way back to the top level at
which she's used to performing.
"I'm addressing all of the shortcomings I'm aware of
physically and mentally and working my way back to a
confident state," Gibbs said. "I'm trying to get back to the
form I'm used to playing and the form the team is used to
seeing me compete in."
The No. 14 doubles pair of Gibbs and fellow junior co
captain Kristie Ahn usually represents the No. 12 Cardi
nal (13-3, 6-1 Pac-12) on the top doubles court together,
but the lineup was shuffled for this match without Gibbs.
The No. 80 duo of senior Stacey Tan and sophomore Ellen
Tsay played Oregon's Nicole Long and Patricia Skowron
ski on court No. 1.

Junior Kristie Ahn (above) has continued to
impress in her comeback season. Ahn, who
missed significant time in 2011 and 2012,
won her singles match against Oregon on
court No. 1 in decisive fashion, 6-2, 6-2.
Though Tan and Tsay fell
in a close 8-7 (3) battle, the
Cardinal captured the doubles
point nonetheless. Ahn and
junior Amelia Herring were
victorious over Lana Buttner
and Pascale Neubert 8-5 on
court No. 2. Senior co-cap
tain Natalie Dillon and fresh
man Krista Hardebeck had
similar success over Sofia
Hager and Brooke Hughes
on court No. 3 with an 8-4
win to clinch the point.
"Some girls aren't as
strong in singles, but are re
ally strong in doubles,"
Hardebeck said, referring
the Ducks' first doubles
team. "Our focus was moving
at the net, being aggressive
with our volleys, and work
ing together as a team."
Hardebeck was dominant
in singles play, where she
ranks 14th in the country easily
defeating SkowronsM 6-3,6-1.
"[Skowronski] is a great
player who hits really hard,"
Hardebeck said. "I had to fo
cus on making sure I stayed
consistent while placing the
ball well."

The rest of the singles
lineup also had little difficul
ty moving past their Oregon
opponents. No. 93 Tan
trounced Hager to seize a 6-
1, 6-2 win on court No. 3,
while the 30th-ranked Ahn
clinched the match when she
defeated No. 102 Long 6-2,6-
2 at first singles.
Ahn has made a come
back of her own this season.
Missing the end of her fresh
man season and much of her
sophomore season with an
ankle injury, her inaugural
victory on the top court this
weekend signified another
big milestone in her impres
sive return.
The back of the Cardinal
lineup posted similar wins.
The 51st-ranked Tsay
crushed Buttner 6-1, 6-2 at
the No. 4 spot, while fresh
man Lindsey Kostas cap
tured a 6-3, 6-3 triumph over
Hughes on the last court.
Dillon defeated Rabea
Stueckemann on court No. 5,
6-4, 6-3 to finish off the
sweep.
The Cardinal has now
won nine of its last 10 match
es and will face Hawaii Tues
day on its home courts. The
contest will be Stanford's last
home match of the season.
The women travel to take

on the Arizona schools this
weekend and cross-town ri
val Cal the weekend after.
The Stanford women will
then prepare for postseason
play in their quest for a na
tional championship.
A victory over unranked
Hawaii, a team that the Car
dinal defeated 6-1 in its last
meeting in an exhibition
match at Hawaii in Novem
ber 2011, is crucial in terms
of maintaining team confi
dence and momentum.
"Usually the tougher the
team, the more everyone has
to focus," Hardebeck said.
"We really treat all oppo
nents the same though. If
you get too far ahead of
yourself, you could potential
ly suffer a bad loss."
The goal to emphatically
close out the season in the
next few weeks applies to
Hardebeck just as it applies
to the whole team.
"First we need to keep
our energy up," Hardebeck
said, "and secondly we need to
support each other."
The Card's showdown
against Hawaii will take place
at 1:30 p.m. on Thesday at the
Taube Family Tennis Center.
