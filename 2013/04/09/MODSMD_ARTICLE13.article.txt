## Stanford rolls without Gibbs 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Even in the absence of jun
ior co-captain Nicole Gibbs,
Stanford women's tennis
cruised past the Oregon Ducks
(12-8, 1-7 Pac-12) Saturday,
blanking them 7-0 in dominant
fashion.

Gibbs, who watched from the side due to a minor in
jury, is currently making her way back to the top level at
which she's used to performing.
"I'm addressing all of the shortcomings I'm aware of
physically and mentally and working my way back to a
confident state," Gibbs said. "I'm trying to get back to the
form I'm used to playing and the form the team is used to
seeing me compete in."
The No. 14 doubles pair of Gibbs and fellow junior co
captain Kristie Ahn usually represents the No. 12 Cardi
nal (13-3, 6-1 Pac-12) on the top doubles court together,
but the lineup was shuffled for this match without Gibbs.
The No. 80 duo of senior Stacey Tan and sophomore Ellen
Tsay played Oregon's Nicole Long and Patricia Skowron
ski on court No. 1.

Junior Kristie Ahn (above) has continued to
impress in her comeback season. Ahn, who
missed significant time in 2011 and 2012,
won her singles match against Oregon on
court No. 1 in decisive fashion, 6-2, 6-2.
