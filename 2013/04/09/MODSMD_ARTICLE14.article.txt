## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY The 						Obstruction of Freedom, Part 2 
### Adam Johnson 
Oln a recent column, I wrote
about how the administration
through recent policies rang
ing from banning double booked poli
cies to taking over student-run eating
clubs has failed to respect the stu
dent ireedom that Leland and Jane
Stanford envisioned when founding
this University I argued that freedom
of expression is not only crucial for op
timizing our Stanford experience, but
for inculcating a reverence for liberty
that will serve the nation and world as
we enter roles in government, law,
business, education, tech and more.
One oft-mentioned adversary of
freedom of expression is structural au
thority— the "man" or, in the case of
my previous piece, the Stanford ad
ministration. The "man" is an easy
target; it is often a highly bureaucrat
ic other that offers concrete actions
wars, tax hikes, police brutality
that can spark resistance. In this
sense, my first piece was relatively
easy to write; not only was there a
slew of recent and well publicized ad
ministrative decisions from which to
draw from, but there were many stu
dents and alumni whom I knew would
be sympathetic to the cause.
Today I write about a new target, a
group that obstructs freedom of ex
pression as much or more than our ad
ministration. This time, the target is
no longer removed from us. It is us.
While Stanford may foster diver
sity of class, color, and creed, it does a
poor job fostering diversity of
thought. In terms of political ideolo
gy, Stanford students predictably
lean left. Just how many students
lean left, though, is staggering; for
every thirteen Stanford students who
voted for President Obama in the last
election, only one student voted for
Mitt Romney.
It is sometimes said that, when one
is in an academic gathering, a common
assumption is that all the strangers in
the room vote Democrat. According to
the Stanford exit poll data, you can
safely make that assumption until
eleven people are gathered, at which
point it is more likely that there will be
at least one Romney voter present. If
we wanted to ensure (with 95 percent
certainty) that there is at least one
person who identifies as either "con
servative" or "very conservative," we
would need a gathering with at least
fifty-two people.
As if this were not lopsided enough
already, many of Stanford's conserva
tives end up not voicing their opinions
especially in regards to social is
sues — due to being vastly outnum
bered. When was the last time you
met an open Republican? When was
the last time someone in class defend
ed a socially conservative policy? Al
though perhaps no one is technically
stopping these people from speaking
their minds, there exists a strong so
cial pressure to conform to the ideals
of the left.
I can attest to this firsthand. Some
of my previous pieces have argued for
stances that, though they may go
against the grain here, are firmly in
the moderate camp. Yet the criticism I
received on campus was astounding. I

have been called "the single most dis
turbing obstacle to progress and posi
tive change in this world" and my
work has been labeled as "unre
searched drivel" and "completely un
founded." And this is only the public
commentary; I can only wonder what
is expressed in private.
Again, these are pieces that were
fairly moderate —my resistance to
the phrase "only whites can be racist,"
my opinion that we should not let con
cepts of "male privilege" obstruct the
fact that males face very real prob
lems of their own, my criticism of how
current divestment campaigns over
simplify a complex issue. And yet as
soon as I threatened the sacred cows
many here hold dear, I was met with
considerable resistance. This resist
ance, I suspect, is grounded not so
much in the ideas themselves, but in
the fact that someone dared to pub
licly express them.
The reaction I received was under
standable, since scores of students and
faculty are trapped in "echo cham
bers" where they hear then* own views
reflected and amplified. Consciously
or not, most of us seek out like-minded
peers rather than those with whom
disagree. This leads to a sociological
phenomenon Cass Sunstein labels
"the law of group polarization,"
wherein individuals in a similarly
minded group will, after deliberation,
move further towards the extreme on
the topic discussed. Entertaining con
flicting opinions soon becomes un
thinkable ("I can't even..."). Oppos
ing ideas are dismissed, often harshly.
The intellectual vigor of healthy de
bate is lost and, if there is any truth in
this world, we are all less likely to
reach it.
I am willing to publicly oppose this
polarization and break the silence,
even if it means risking my social rep
utation. Many students I have talked
to are not willing to make that choice,
and even I have moments where I will
bite my tongue.
For shame. We embrace diversity,
save when it comes to diversity of
thought. We value freedom, except
when it comes to the freedom to dis
agree. There was a time when those
on the left valued free speech, and for
good reason; freedom of expression is
one of the pinnacles of a vibrant intel
lectual sphere and good governance.
As Mill wrote in On Liberty,
"Truth gains more even by the errors
of one who, with due study and
preparation, thinks for himself, than
by the time opinions of those who on
ly hold them because they do not suf
fer themselves to think." Let us take
Mill's words to heart. Let us give
voice to those who are not heard,
even if we believe them to be false.
Let us abandon dogma, embrace dis
sent, and submit our own opinions to
reason and resistance. Let us hold
freedom of expression not as a privi
lege of the majority, but a right pro
vided to all on equal terms. We will all
be better off for it.

certainty) that there is at least one
person who identifies as either "con
servative" or "very conservative," we
would need a gathering with at least
fifty-two people.
As if this were not lopsided enough
already, many of Stanford's conserva
tives end up not voicing their opinions
especially in regards to social is
sues — due to being vastly outnum
bered. When was the last time you
met an open Republican? When was
the last time someone in class defend
ed a socially conservative policy? Al
though perhaps no one is technically
stopping these people from speaking
their minds, there exists a strong so
cial pressure to conform to the ideals
of the left.
I can attest to this firsthand. Some
of my previous pieces have argued for
stances that, though they may go
against the grain here, are firmly in
the moderate camp. Yet the criticism I
received on campus was astounding. I

have been called "the single most dis
turbing obstacle to progress and posi
tive change in this world" and my
work has been labeled as "unre
searched drivel" and "completely un
founded." And this is only the public
commentary; I can only wonder what
is expressed in private.
Again, these are pieces that were
fairly moderate —my resistance to
the phrase "only whites can be racist,"
my opinion that we should not let con
cepts of "male privilege" obstruct the
fact that males face very real prob
lems of their own, my criticism of how
current divestment campaigns over
simplify a complex issue. And yet as
soon as I threatened the sacred cows
many here hold dear, I was met with
considerable resistance. This resist
ance, I suspect, is grounded not so
much in the ideas themselves, but in
the fact that someone dared to pub
licly express them.
The reaction I received was under
standable, since scores of students and
faculty are trapped in "echo cham
bers" where they hear then* own views
reflected and amplified. Consciously
or not, most of us seek out like-minded
peers rather than those with whom
disagree. This leads to a sociological
phenomenon Cass Sunstein labels
"the law of group polarization,"
wherein individuals in a similarly
minded group will, after deliberation,
move further towards the extreme on
the topic discussed. Entertaining con
flicting opinions soon becomes un
thinkable ("I can't even..."). Oppos
ing ideas are dismissed, often harshly.
The intellectual vigor of healthy de
bate is lost and, if there is any truth in
this world, we are all less likely to
reach it.
I am willing to publicly oppose this
polarization and break the silence,
even if it means risking my social rep
utation. Many students I have talked
to are not willing to make that choice,
and even I have moments where I will
bite my tongue.
For shame. We embrace diversity,
save when it comes to diversity of
thought. We value freedom, except
when it comes to the freedom to dis
agree. There was a time when those
on the left valued free speech, and for
good reason; freedom of expression is
one of the pinnacles of a vibrant intel
lectual sphere and good governance.
As Mill wrote in On Liberty,
"Truth gains more even by the errors
of one who, with due study and
preparation, thinks for himself, than
by the time opinions of those who on
ly hold them because they do not suf
fer themselves to think." Let us take
Mill's words to heart. Let us give
voice to those who are not heard,
even if we believe them to be false.
Let us abandon dogma, embrace dis
sent, and submit our own opinions to
reason and resistance. Let us hold
freedom of expression not as a privi
lege of the majority, but a right pro
vided to all on equal terms. We will all
be better off for it.

Oln a recent column, I wrote
about how the administration
through recent policies rang
ing from banning double booked poli
cies to taking over student-run eating
clubs has failed to respect the stu
dent ireedom that Leland and Jane
Stanford envisioned when founding
this University I argued that freedom
of expression is not only crucial for op
timizing our Stanford experience, but
for inculcating a reverence for liberty
that will serve the nation and world as
we enter roles in government, law,
business, education, tech and more.
One oft-mentioned adversary of
freedom of expression is structural au
thority— the "man" or, in the case of
my previous piece, the Stanford ad
ministration. The "man" is an easy
target; it is often a highly bureaucrat
ic other that offers concrete actions
wars, tax hikes, police brutality
that can spark resistance. In this
sense, my first piece was relatively
easy to write; not only was there a
slew of recent and well publicized ad
ministrative decisions from which to
draw from, but there were many stu
dents and alumni whom I knew would
be sympathetic to the cause.
Today I write about a new target, a
group that obstructs freedom of ex
pression as much or more than our ad
ministration. This time, the target is
no longer removed from us. It is us.
While Stanford may foster diver
sity of class, color, and creed, it does a
poor job fostering diversity of
thought. In terms of political ideolo
gy, Stanford students predictably
lean left. Just how many students
lean left, though, is staggering; for
every thirteen Stanford students who
voted for President Obama in the last
election, only one student voted for
Mitt Romney.
It is sometimes said that, when one
is in an academic gathering, a common
assumption is that all the strangers in
the room vote Democrat. According to
the Stanford exit poll data, you can
safely make that assumption until
eleven people are gathered, at which
point it is more likely that there will be
at least one Romney voter present. If
we wanted to ensure (with 95 percent
certainty) that there is at least one
person who identifies as either "con
servative" or "very conservative," we
would need a gathering with at least
fifty-two people.
