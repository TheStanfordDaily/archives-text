# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## To the New Admits 
### Chris Herries 
There's been a lot of talk re
cently about our record-shat
tering low admission rate. We
ended up admitting somewhere
around 5.7 percent of all applicants.
Let's all just sit for a second and
recognize how small that number is.
For the class of 2017, it's con
ceivable that congratulations are in
order. I imagine that most of you
have worked hard or endured some
sort of hardship to get here, and
you've been rewarded with admis
sion to one of the greatest universi
ties in the history of man. It's an ex
citing time to relax for the latter
part of senior year with all your
friends in tow. You'll have fantastic
parties to attend, hands to shake
and praise to receive from your re
spective schools.
But at some point in the near fu
ture, after the last hand has been
shaken, the last party has been par
tied and the last award has been ac
cepted, you'll find yourself alone in
your bed, trying to fall asleep. Your
mind will be tossing and turning as
much as your body, and you'll have
to come to terms with what your ad
mission to Stanford means. Many of
you may pause here, never realizing

that, yes, your admission and subse
quent presence here means some
thing. It's currently in vogue to say
that meaning is entirely up to you.
Forge and temper your own steel,
or, to paraphrase Alexis Carrel, you
are both the marble and the sculp
tor.
To some extent, yes, your pres
ence here, your actions, agenda and
trajectory are and should be entire
ly up to you. But, at the same time,
an admission to Stanford is an obli
gation.
Allow me to give you an exam
ple. An old high school acquaintance
contacted me not long ago and we
got to talking. At one point, she
said, as a compliment, that I "was a
very gifted person." I thought that
so untrue. We here at Stanford are
not gifted, we are obliged.
That is to say, our presence here
is not an endowment from on high,
it is a mandate to do good in the
world. While here, you will have at
your disposal resources people,
material and capital that are,
frankly, unfathomable. You'll have
peers with a wealth of experiences,
the best professors in their field,
generous stipends and fellowships,
as well as access to organizations
like the Haas Center for Public
Service. It is your duty to use the
tools and services this campus pro
vides to make a positive impact on

the world.
That impact does not include
coding apps that convenience the
lives of already convenienced peo
ple. It also doesn't include aspiring
to be a corporate lawyer or a high
powered, emotionally void busi
nessman. I encourage you, admits
— and my peers already here — to
check your privilege and have a
long, hard reflection about how best
you can serve humanity.
The burden of curing HIX solv
ing world hunger, ending war,
bringing justice and expanding the
human literary corpus fall on the
shoulders of elites like us. You — we
— literally represent some of the
most brilliant people in all the world
with the resources to do things for
merly thought incomprehensible.
You are not here by some fluke. You
are here to do those things.
You are a mountain climber who
is approaching the top. Do not reach
the top so the world can look up at
you. Do not reach the top so you can
sigh and look down at the world.
Don't do it to pat yourself on the
back or revel in the accolades of
others. Summit so that when you
descend, you can guide the less ca
pable to the top. Go forth.
