## Card tops Huskies, falls to pesky Ducks 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
No. 47 Stanford men's tennis picked up
its first win on the road Friday against No.
30 Washington, but the weekend turned
sour with the Cardinal's first-ever loss to
No. 44 Oregon on Saturday.
While last year Stanford (8-8,1-3 Pac
-12) swept Washington (15-8,2-2 Pac-12) 7-
0, this year's team edged out a closer 4-3
victory, breaking the Huskies' six-match
winning streak.
"It was a big win, [Washington] was
ranked top 30 in the country so that win
will help us a lot," said freshman Nolan
Paige. "A lot of guys showed a lot of heart
in winning that match they didn't give
up, they just kept battling."
Stanford started strong with an 8-3 vic
tory from freshman Trey Strobel and
Paige at No. 3 doubles. Though the Cardi
nal's No. 1 doubles team of sophomore
John Morrissey and senior Denis Lin lost
8-3, the No. 2 doubles team of freshman
Maciek Romanowicz and sophomore

Robert Stineman
pulled out an 8-6
victory to take
the crucial dou
bles point.
The team's

lead slipped away with the start of the sin
gles matches. No. 88 Paige was the first to
finish, falling 7-5, 6-2 to Marton Bots at
No. 2 singles. No. 54 Morrissey followed
soon after with a 6-4,64 loss at No. 1 sin
gles to No. 21 Kyle McMorrow.
Next to finish was Romanowicz, who
fell 7-5, 6-1 at No. 3 singles, putting the
Cardinal down 3-1 and one point away
from a tough loss.
But then the comeback began.
At No. 6 singles, Strobel pulled off a
tough 7-5, 6-3 victory over Nicholas
Kamisar, and Stineman evened the score
at 3-3 with a 64, 7-6 (5) win at No. 4 sin
gles.
Junior Daniel Ho was the last to finish,
clinching the match for Stanford with a
close 6-2,4-6,6-3 victory at No. 5 singles.
Romanowicz credited the doubles

teams as well as the No. 4,5 and 6 singles
players for pulling out the victory.
"The crucial thing was to win the dou
bles point, so we accomplished that. We
were trying really hard and supporting
each other to win the doubles point," Ro
manowicz said. "Our bottom part of the
lineup also played a huge role in the victo
ry."
The team traveled south for a face-off
against Oregon on Saturday afternoon,
falling 34 to the Ducks the Cardinal's
first loss to Oregon (154,2-2 Pac-12) in the
27 times the teams have played each other.
Though Oregon has historically been
one of the weaker teams in the conference,
the Ducks have won seven of its last ten
matches to earn a top-50 ranking.
"Their guys just kind of stepped up
and played well," Paige said. "We kept
fighting though, and never gave in, but
they were just a little bit too good that
day."
Stanford won the doubles point to start
