No. 47 Stanford men's tennis picked up
its first win on the road Friday against No.
30 Washington, but the weekend turned
sour with the Cardinal's first-ever loss to
No. 44 Oregon on Saturday.
While last year Stanford (8-8,1-3 Pac
-12) swept Washington (15-8,2-2 Pac-12) 7-
0, this year's team edged out a closer 4-3
victory, breaking the Huskies' six-match
winning streak.
"It was a big win, [Washington] was
ranked top 30 in the country so that win
will help us a lot," said freshman Nolan
Paige. "A lot of guys showed a lot of heart
in winning that match they didn't give
up, they just kept battling."
Stanford started strong with an 8-3 vic
tory from freshman Trey Strobel and
Paige at No. 3 doubles. Though the Cardi
nal's No. 1 doubles team of sophomore
John Morrissey and senior Denis Lin lost
8-3, the No. 2 doubles team of freshman
Maciek Romanowicz and sophomore

Robert Stineman
pulled out an 8-6
victory to take
the crucial dou
bles point.
The team's

lead slipped away with the start of the sin
gles matches. No. 88 Paige was the first to
finish, falling 7-5, 6-2 to Marton Bots at
No. 2 singles. No. 54 Morrissey followed
soon after with a 6-4,64 loss at No. 1 sin
gles to No. 21 Kyle McMorrow.
Next to finish was Romanowicz, who
fell 7-5, 6-1 at No. 3 singles, putting the
Cardinal down 3-1 and one point away
from a tough loss.
But then the comeback began.
At No. 6 singles, Strobel pulled off a
tough 7-5, 6-3 victory over Nicholas
Kamisar, and Stineman evened the score
at 3-3 with a 64, 7-6 (5) win at No. 4 sin
gles.
Junior Daniel Ho was the last to finish,
clinching the match for Stanford with a
close 6-2,4-6,6-3 victory at No. 5 singles.
Romanowicz credited the doubles

teams as well as the No. 4,5 and 6 singles
players for pulling out the victory.
