### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Kevin Tsujihara MBA
'92 is the recently select
ed Chief Executive Offi
cer (CEO) of Warner
Bros. Entertainment and
the first Asian-American
CEO of a major Holly
wood studio. Tsujihara,
who has worked at Warn
er Bros, since 1994 and
who previously served as
President of Warner
Bros. Home Entertain
ment, sat down with The
Daily to discuss his time
at the Graduate School
of Business (GSB) and
his hopes for the future
of the entertainment
industry.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What were the most valu
able courses you took or experiences you had at Stan
ford?
Kevin Tsujihara (KT): One was a leadership class and
one was more about communications and EQ [emotional
intelligence], and being able to communicate and under
standing other peoples' feelings. In both cases, they are
extremely useful as an executive. One [taught students] to
be able to communicate and understand people and under
stand where they are coming from. And the other one is
[about] what is a great leader? How do you build compa
nies, and how do you build companies that succeed and en
dure?
TSD: Why did you decide to work for Warner Bros.,
and what has your experience there been so far?
KT: Before I went to business school, I worked for
Ernst and Young, and I primarily did mergers and acqui
sitions work. During the four years I was there, I proba
bly spent two years with Warner Brothers and Time
Warner, and so I was very familiar with the company. I did
a startup after I graduated from business school that was
n't very successful and so as a stopgap to go to a com
pany before I figured out exactly what I was going to do
I said I'd go to Warner Bros, and see how it goes. That
was 19 years ago... and I've done a number of different
things here. I didn't grow up saying, "I want to work in the
movie business."
TSD: How have you stayed involved in the Stanford
community? When did you last visit Stanford, and how
has it changed?
KT: I've talked at a class every year. Professor [Bill]
Guttentag has a media and entertainment class at the
GSB, and so I go in and guest lecture. I've done that for
three or four years, so the last time I was there was last
spring, and the transformation of the Business School
since I've been there has been amazing. I just can't believe
how much it has changed.
TSD: How is the GSB different from when you were
there?
KT: Just the infrastructure. I'm not as familiar as far
as how the curriculum has changed, but from the sheer
buildings and the food and the classrooms, everything
looks so much better than it did when I was there. As it re
lates to the curriculum, I'm getting more involved in that.
I joined the advisory council for the business school, and I
just met with the Dean a couple of weeks ago to kind of
talk about how I can become more involved... I've been
making a few calls for the business school to try to help
some of our recruits that we have that are trying to make
a decision to accept or not accept their offers to go to the
business school.
TSD: What do you tell the recruits about the GSB and
your experience there?
KT: I think it depends on what the questions are, be
cause I try to answer the questions for the person as it re
lates to what's going into the decision and what's your
background, because everyone's background is a little bit
