# Suites efforts grow to endorsements
## Stanford Student Freedom Project looks to extend student representation 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Student Freedom Proj
ect (SSFP), a new advocacy group com
posed of more than 80 students and alum
ni focused on protecting student liberties,
endorsed six Senate candidates, three
class president slates and both serious
Executive slates for this year's ASSU
elections.
According to Miles Unterreiner 'l2
M.A.'l3, a Daily staffer, and Maayan Dem
bo 'l4, two of the project's leaders, SSFP
aims to be more than just an endorsement
group, focusing principally on promoting
an increased recognition of student voices
in administrative decisions.
Unterreiner and Dembo cited several
recent incidents such as the termina
tion of Chi Theta Chi's lease, the decision
to ban Net Appetit from campus and Res
idential Education (ResEd)'s plan to con
tract Suites Dining's management to an
outside vendor as demonstrative of vio
lated student freedoms.
"We happened to be founded right be
fore elections so our first project is en

dorsements, but we foresee the Freedom
Project continuing," Unterreiner said.
"For this year, the big objective is Suites
and seeing that brought to a satisfactory
conclusion."
Dembo said that SSFP received appli
cations from both Executive slates, eight
Senate candidates and approximately two
class president slates from each class.
All candidates were required to fill out
SSFP's application, which included ques
tions about what other endorsements they
received, why they chose to run for office,
how they felt about the Suites controversy
and how they planned to advance the
cause of student freedom if elected.
"Knowing personally several of the
candidates and having read their applica
tions, I think that next year is going to be
a very good year," Unterreiner said. "We
are looking forward to having a really en
ergetic, powerful student government
that really advocates for student interests,
and I think the likelihood is high that that
is going to happen."
A panel of six SSFP members, includ
ing Unterreiner and Dembo, reviewed the
applications and interviewed the Execu

tive slates before making endorsement
decisions.
Though Unterreiner wrote on April 1
that SSFP would endorse one Executive
slate, the group endorsed both Dan Ash
ton 'l4 and Billy Gallagher 'l4, and Najla
Gomez 'l4 and Elizabeth Patino 'l4.
Unterreiner said that deciding be
tween the two Executive slates was like
"comparing apples and oranges," as the
committee was impressed by Gallagher
and Ashton's focus on independent jour
nalism and holding the administration ac
countable, but also by Gomez and Patino's
experience in social and political organiza
tions.
"We genuinely felt that [both slates]
would both be equally effective, but that
their styles and methods of going about
being effective would be very different,"
Unterreiner said. "Whatever choice stu
dents make for Executive next Friday,
they have made the right choice. You real
ly can't lose. Whoever wins is going to do
a fantastic job."
