# Suites efforts grow to endorsements
## Stanford Student Freedom Project looks to extend student representation 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Student Freedom Proj
ect (SSFP), a new advocacy group com
posed of more than 80 students and alum
ni focused on protecting student liberties,
endorsed six Senate candidates, three
class president slates and both serious
Executive slates for this year's ASSU
elections.
According to Miles Unterreiner 'l2
M.A.'l3, a Daily staffer, and Maayan Dem
bo 'l4, two of the project's leaders, SSFP
aims to be more than just an endorsement
group, focusing principally on promoting
an increased recognition of student voices
in administrative decisions.
Unterreiner and Dembo cited several
recent incidents such as the termina
tion of Chi Theta Chi's lease, the decision
to ban Net Appetit from campus and Res
idential Education (ResEd)'s plan to con
tract Suites Dining's management to an
outside vendor as demonstrative of vio
lated student freedoms.
"We happened to be founded right be
fore elections so our first project is en

dorsements, but we foresee the Freedom
Project continuing," Unterreiner said.
"For this year, the big objective is Suites
and seeing that brought to a satisfactory
conclusion."
Dembo said that SSFP received appli
cations from both Executive slates, eight
Senate candidates and approximately two
class president slates from each class.
All candidates were required to fill out
SSFP's application, which included ques
tions about what other endorsements they
received, why they chose to run for office,
how they felt about the Suites controversy
and how they planned to advance the
cause of student freedom if elected.
"Knowing personally several of the
candidates and having read their applica
tions, I think that next year is going to be
a very good year," Unterreiner said. "We
are looking forward to having a really en
ergetic, powerful student government
that really advocates for student interests,
and I think the likelihood is high that that
is going to happen."
A panel of six SSFP members, includ
ing Unterreiner and Dembo, reviewed the
applications and interviewed the Execu

tive slates before making endorsement
decisions.
Though Unterreiner wrote on April 1
that SSFP would endorse one Executive
slate, the group endorsed both Dan Ash
ton 'l4 and Billy Gallagher 'l4, and Najla
Gomez 'l4 and Elizabeth Patino 'l4.
Unterreiner said that deciding be
tween the two Executive slates was like
"comparing apples and oranges," as the
committee was impressed by Gallagher
and Ashton's focus on independent jour
nalism and holding the administration ac
countable, but also by Gomez and Patino's
experience in social and political organiza
tions.
"We genuinely felt that [both slates]
would both be equally effective, but that
their styles and methods of going about
being effective would be very different,"
Unterreiner said. "Whatever choice stu
dents make for Executive next Friday,
they have made the right choice. You real
ly can't lose. Whoever wins is going to do
a fantastic job."

of Suites Dining. Through the Stanford Student Freedom Project, Unterreiner hopes to boost student input in similar decisions.
Serve, junior class president slate
takels and senior class president
slate SenYOUR Time also received
the SSFP's endorsement. Dembo
said that the committee was partic
ularly impressed by Soph Serve's
plan to look into the closure of the
Toyon Eating Clubs, which were
shut down in 2009.
"Even though they are class
presidents, and they don't have that
much instated power in them posi
tion, they are still taking advantage
of them position as a leader and try
ing to help us out," Dembo said
about Soph Serve.
SSFP also endorsed six Senate
candidates: Ben Holston 'l5,
Hisham Al-Falih 'l6, Abby Dow 'l6,
Ryan Matsumoto 'l6, Ilya
Mouzykantskii 'l6 and Natasha Pa
tel 'l6.
Both Dembo and Unterreiner
expressed enthusiasm about specif
ic initiatives proposed by these can
didates, such as Patel's idea to hold
students accountable for their work
in University committees. Patel
said that she applied for the SSFP
endorsement because the group's
goals aligned with her plans for the
Senate, if she is elected.
"A lot of what I want to see is
getting the student body really to
interact, and I think the Stanford
Student Freedom Project does a re
ally good job of that through their
mission," Patel said. "People who
are freshmen or sophomores, who
are not considered upperclassmen,

can still take part in these issues
that upperclassmen see as faulty
and want to see changed."
Unterreiner and Dembo agreed
that underclassmen senators
should be able to represent SSFP's
interests, despite the fact that most
have limited experience with many
of the issues that SSFP is currently
focusing on.
Dembo said that the SSFP will
regularly check in with their en
dorsees to advise them on making
decisions and pursuing projects
during their terms in the ASSU.
"I plan on putting a lot of pres
sure on the students that we have
endorsed to actually fulfill a lot of
the things they talked about in their
platforms, and make sure that they
are keeping their promises," Dem
bo said.
Though Unterreiner and Dem
bo credited several senators, no
tably Viraj Bindra 'l5, for showing
interest in the Suites controversy,
they expressed frustration with the
current Senate's inaction in terms
of student life initiatives.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Greg Boardman said that the AS
SU, and in particular the Senate,
has traditionally remained unin
volved in conflicts between students
and the administration regarding
student freedom.
"The ASSU is currently much
more focused on student organiza
tions than these other areas,"
Boardman said. "Sometimes the
ASSU gets involved, sometimes not
so much."
However, Boardman said that
members of the ASSU are "wel
come to join in on any of the conver
sations," and expressed optimism

that future senators, class presi
dents and Executives would take
part in discussions about promoting
student voices in administrative de
cision-making.
Unterreiner agreed with Board
man's characterization of the AS
SU's historical inaction with re

gards to student freedom issues,
but said he believes that the trend
can be reversed with this year's
election.
"If we manage to endorse and
successfully elect candidates who
really are energetic and passionate
and want to utilize the power of the

Senate to the fullest, I think we
could help bring back the ASSU
from the student-imposed irrele
vance that it has assumed," Unster
reiner said.
