## Korean students balance military, school

While his peers worry about what major
to declare or their summer plans, Peter
Moon 'l5 currently faces a different, more
complicated decision whether he will
serve in the South Korean military, and
when.

Moon among fellow undergraduates
anticipates serving in the South Korean
military in order to maintain his South Ko

International Center, said that students
from other countries, including Singapore,
Turkey and Israel, have often served com

to Stanford as freshmen.
"[South Korea] is the country where we
see students... have a break in their studies
and then come back," he said.
According to Pearson, the University
does not keep track of how many students
leave specifically to meet compulsory mili

Because of the age window, college-age
South Koreans must choose whether they
will suspend their undergraduate work or
then - post-graduation academic and profes

army.
Many Korean students at Stanford, in
cluding Jeong Soo Sim 'l5, Wan Jin Park 'l4
and Jichan Park 'l5, choose to take a leave
of absence in the middle of their undergrad
uate years, believing that taking time off
then would be less disruptive than a two
year break after graduation.
'Mter spending a couple of years at
Stanford, I thought that if I go later in my
