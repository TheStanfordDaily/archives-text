# STUDENT LIFE
## Korean students balance military, school 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While his peers worry about what major
to declare or their summer plans, Peter
Moon 'l5 currently faces a different, more
complicated decision whether he will
serve in the South Korean military, and
when.
A dual American-South Korean citizen,
Moon among fellow undergraduates
anticipates serving in the South Korean
military in order to maintain his South Ko
rean citizenship status. He is currently de
ciding whether he will take time off during
his undergraduate career or immediately
following his senior year to serve.
South Korea requires all male citizens to
serve at least 21 months in the military

sometime between the ages of 18 and 35.
Under Article 88 of the Military Service Act
of 2003, the punishment for refusing to
serve is up to three years in prison or, for
dual citizens, loss of South Korean citizen
ship status.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel
International Center, said that students
from other countries, including Singapore,
Turkey and Israel, have often served com
pulsory military service before they come
to Stanford as freshmen.
"[South Korea] is the country where we
see students... have a break in their studies
and then come back," he said.
According to Pearson, the University
does not keep track of how many students
leave specifically to meet compulsory mili
tary service requirements.

Choosing to serve now or later
Because of the age window, college-age
South Koreans must choose whether they
will suspend their undergraduate work or
then - post-graduation academic and profes
sional careers to serve in the South Korean
army.
Many Korean students at Stanford, in
cluding Jeong Soo Sim 'l5, Wan Jin Park 'l4
and Jichan Park 'l5, choose to take a leave
of absence in the middle of their undergrad
uate years, believing that taking time off
then would be less disruptive than a two
year break after graduation.
'Mter spending a couple of years at
Stanford, I thought that if I go later in my
life, it's going to cost more
the loss of time in my ca
reer, or academic career, or
any path I choose," Sim said,
"So I chose to go as early as
possible."
For Moon, the flexibility of
undergraduate coursework
might make the earlier inter
ruption easier in terms of aca
demic continuity than it would
be later in academia.
"As a premed student, go
ing away for two years...is
pretty big because you have to
learn study habits again [and]
you have to learn to function
in society again, and med
school isn't the ideal place to
start something fresh," Moon
said. "[lf I go] after this year
... I can get it over with and
then come back."

Pearson, on the other
hand, finds the interruption
during undergraduate years
more taxing.
"If you do leave during
your studies, to go back it's
quite a challenge," Pearson
said.
"You have a significant
break in your studies," he
said. "You're going to do
something that's very very
different than what you're do
ing at Stanford... You have the
two adjustments: one is leav
ing here and going to do mili
tary service, and two [is] mili
tary service back to here."
Moon discussed the addi
tional social pitfalls of becom
ing disconnected with your so
cial community at Stanford
that results from serving dur
ing undergraduate years.
"If I go after this year,
then all of my friends will have
graduated before I come
back," Moon said. "The pro of
going after college is, of

course, that your social life is
n't as affected."
Transitioning back to the
Farm
While they agreed that the
disruption in the middle of
their Stanford careers
prompted a different experi
ence, Wan Jin, Jichan and Sim
said that it wasn't too difficult
to settle back into the Stan
ford community.
Wan Jin Park entered
Stanford with the Class of
2012 and will graduate with
the Class of 2015. Having left
school after Fall Quarter in
2011, Wan Jin served as an in
terpreter at the headquarters
for U.S. forces stationed in
South Korea for 21 months.
He is currently completing his
second quarter back at school.
"At first, it's definitely
weird. At the same time it's al
so exciting in away because
it's like being a freshman
again, because you have to

meet new friends and join new
students groups," Wan Jin
said. "That's definitely a lot of
fun."
Chang Whan Yea, who also
came to Stanford as a member
of the Class of 2012, left Stan
ford in the fall of 2011 after his
junior year. He is currently
working as an air traffic con
troller and a Korean Augmen
tation to the United States
Army (KATUSA) soldier.
"If you are under con
scription, then try to make the
most out of it," Yea said, 'And
I'd say try to apply as early as
possible. It's a great experi
ence, and if you're going to do
it, it's better to do it when
you're young."
Yea spoke of how physical
ly and emotionally challenging
basic training was, particular
ly in comparison to his life at
Stanford.
"Basic training was a huge

eye opener for me," Yea said.
"I didn't have a name back
then. I was just a number, my
trainee number."
Admitted with the Class of
2013, Jichan left Stanford af
ter the fall of his sophomore
year, served at a South Kore
an military base in Yangju for
21 months and is now finish
ing his first quarter back.
"Stanford's environment is
very free and you get to do
whatever you want, but obvi
ously in the army you have to
get used to the strict sched
ules and hierarchies," Jichan
said, "It's a cultural challenge,
and [an] emotional challenge
as well."
Sim, who began his Stan
ford career in the Class of
2012, served as an interpreter
for KATUSAs between his
sophomore and junior year,
and returned to the Farm in
the fall of 2012.

"Since it's an extreme ex
perience for an individual, it
certainly gives me some kind
of experience that will live
[with me]," Sim said, "It kind
of makes me think I can do
anything that is easier than
the army."
As Moon prepares for his
upcoming service, he antici
pates a unique learning expe
rience.
"[I look forward to] under
standing the meaning of com
munity and understanding
what it really means to serve
other people not just in a
superficial sense, but in a
meaningful way," Moon said,
"Of course its gong to be diffi
cult physically, mentally.
But I feel like those things
would really help me grow as
a person."

tary service, and two [is] mili
tary service back to here."
Moon discussed the addi
tional social pitfalls of becom
ing disconnected with your so
cial community at Stanford
that results from serving dur
ing undergraduate years.
"If I go after this year,
then all of my friends will have
graduated before I come
back," Moon said. "The pro of
going after college is, of

course, that your social life is
n't as affected."
Transitioning back to the
Farm
While they agreed that the
disruption in the middle of
their Stanford careers
prompted a different experi
ence, Wan Jin, Jichan and Sim
said that it wasn't too difficult
to settle back into the Stan
ford community.
Wan Jin Park entered
Stanford with the Class of
2012 and will graduate with
the Class of 2015. Having left
school after Fall Quarter in
2011, Wan Jin served as an in
terpreter at the headquarters
for U.S. forces stationed in
South Korea for 21 months.
He is currently completing his
second quarter back at school.
"At first, it's definitely
weird. At the same time it's al
so exciting in away because
it's like being a freshman
again, because you have to

meet new friends and join new
students groups," Wan Jin
said. "That's definitely a lot of
fun."
Chang Whan Yea, who also
came to Stanford as a member
of the Class of 2012, left Stan
ford in the fall of 2011 after his
junior year. He is currently
working as an air traffic con
troller and a Korean Augmen
tation to the United States
Army (KATUSA) soldier.
"If you are under con
scription, then try to make the
most out of it," Yea said, 'And
I'd say try to apply as early as
possible. It's a great experi
ence, and if you're going to do
it, it's better to do it when
you're young."
Yea spoke of how physical
ly and emotionally challenging
basic training was, particular
ly in comparison to his life at
Stanford.
"Basic training was a huge

eye opener for me," Yea said.
"I didn't have a name back
then. I was just a number, my
trainee number."
Admitted with the Class of
2013, Jichan left Stanford af
ter the fall of his sophomore
year, served at a South Kore
an military base in Yangju for
21 months and is now finish
ing his first quarter back.
"Stanford's environment is
very free and you get to do
whatever you want, but obvi
ously in the army you have to
get used to the strict sched
ules and hierarchies," Jichan
said, "It's a cultural challenge,
and [an] emotional challenge
as well."
Sim, who began his Stan
ford career in the Class of
2012, served as an interpreter
for KATUSAs between his
sophomore and junior year,
and returned to the Farm in
the fall of 2012.

"Since it's an extreme ex
perience for an individual, it
certainly gives me some kind
of experience that will live
[with me]," Sim said, "It kind
of makes me think I can do
anything that is easier than
the army."
As Moon prepares for his
upcoming service, he antici
pates a unique learning expe
rience.
"[I look forward to] under
standing the meaning of com
munity and understanding
what it really means to serve
other people not just in a
superficial sense, but in a
meaningful way," Moon said,
"Of course its gong to be diffi
cult physically, mentally.
But I feel like those things
would really help me grow as
a person."

While his peers worry about what major
to declare or their summer plans, Peter
Moon 'l5 currently faces a different, more
complicated decision whether he will
serve in the South Korean military, and
when.
A dual American-South Korean citizen,
Moon among fellow undergraduates
anticipates serving in the South Korean
military in order to maintain his South Ko
rean citizenship status. He is currently de
ciding whether he will take time off during
his undergraduate career or immediately
following his senior year to serve.
South Korea requires all male citizens to
serve at least 21 months in the military

sometime between the ages of 18 and 35.
Under Article 88 of the Military Service Act
of 2003, the punishment for refusing to
serve is up to three years in prison or, for
dual citizens, loss of South Korean citizen
ship status.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel
International Center, said that students
from other countries, including Singapore,
Turkey and Israel, have often served com
pulsory military service before they come
to Stanford as freshmen.
"[South Korea] is the country where we
see students... have a break in their studies
and then come back," he said.
According to Pearson, the University
does not keep track of how many students
leave specifically to meet compulsory mili
tary service requirements.

Choosing to serve now or later
Because of the age window, college-age
South Koreans must choose whether they
will suspend their undergraduate work or
then - post-graduation academic and profes
sional careers to serve in the South Korean
army.
Many Korean students at Stanford, in
cluding Jeong Soo Sim 'l5, Wan Jin Park 'l4
and Jichan Park 'l5, choose to take a leave
of absence in the middle of their undergrad
uate years, believing that taking time off
then would be less disruptive than a two
year break after graduation.
'Mter spending a couple of years at
Stanford, I thought that if I go later in my
life, it's going to cost more
the loss of time in my ca
reer, or academic career, or
any path I choose," Sim said,
"So I chose to go as early as
possible."
For Moon, the flexibility of
undergraduate coursework
might make the earlier inter
ruption easier in terms of aca
demic continuity than it would
be later in academia.
"As a premed student, go
ing away for two years...is
pretty big because you have to
learn study habits again [and]
you have to learn to function
in society again, and med
school isn't the ideal place to
start something fresh," Moon
said. "[lf I go] after this year
... I can get it over with and
then come back."

Pearson, on the other
hand, finds the interruption
during undergraduate years
more taxing.
"If you do leave during
your studies, to go back it's
quite a challenge," Pearson
said.
"You have a significant
break in your studies," he
said. "You're going to do
something that's very very
different than what you're do
ing at Stanford... You have the
two adjustments: one is leav
ing here and going to do mili
tary service, and two [is] mili
tary service back to here."
