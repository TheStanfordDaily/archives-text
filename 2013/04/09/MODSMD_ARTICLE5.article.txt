## Executive slate proposes rare amendment to ASSU Constitution 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
This week's ASSU elections will
mark not only the selection of the
University's student government
representatives but also the oppor
tunity for students to amend for
only the ninth time in over 40 years
the ASSU Constitution.
This year's proposed amend
ment, put forward by Executive
candidates Dan Ashton 'l4 and Billy
Gallagher 'l4, would reserve a given
number of seats in the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate for sophomore
and junior candidates. If the amend
ment passes, the Senate will be re
sponsible for determining in their
Bylaws how many seats will be set

aside.
Gallagher is a Daily staffer, and
Ashton is a member of The Daily's
Board of Directors.
Gallagher said that he and Ash
ton proposed the amendment to
help solve the historical problem of
underrepresentation for upperclass
men in the Senate, which some cur
rent and former ASSU officers be
lieve impedes the Senate's effective
ness.
"I would say that the average
student, especially upperclassmen,
doesn't feel like the Senate accu
rately or fairly represents them,"
Gallagher said. "[Most senators] get
elected as freshmen, and by the time
they learn how the Senate works
and how the school really works, it's

probably mid-fall, and by the time
they are able to start working on ef
fective change, they are almost
done."
The Senate and the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) both ap
proved the amendment for the bal
lot last month. If passed by two
thirds of the undergraduate popula
tion in this week's election and if ap
proved by either the Board of
Trustees or by President John Hen
nessy acting on the trustees' behalf,
the amendment will go into effect.
"The [amendment's] goal, which
is to change the culture that Senate
is a freshman-oriented activity, is re
ally great," said Senator Daniela
Olivos 'l5, who voted in favor of put
ting the amendment on the ballot.

"Having to think about how Senate
is more freshmen[-dominated] is a
really great way to talk about this is
sue."
While Olivos was strongly in fa
vor of the amendment, some sena
tors were less confident that it
should be adopted.
"I thought there was sufficient
rationale behind it to warrant refer
endum," said Senator Viraj Bindra
'l5, who voted in favor of the amend
ment. "Even by the end [of the de
bate], I don't think I had a firm idea
of whether or not it should definite
ly be implemented, but even if it was
I realize there are some controls
that the Senate as a body has over it,
and it made enough logical sense to
be put to a vote by the student

body."
Constitutional amendments are
eligible to be placed on the spring
ballot if they receive approval from
two-third of each legislative body or
if a petition in support of the amend
ment signed by at least five percent
of the student body is submitted to
the Elections Commission.
A second proposed amendment
Gallagher and Ashton also pro
posed a second amendment that will
not appear on the ballot, as it was
withdrawn from the Senate's con
sideration on March 12. The amend
ment originally outlined the creation
of a President's Discretionary Fund
