# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Executive slate proposes rare amendment to ASSU Constitution 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
This week's ASSU elections will
mark not only the selection of the
University's student government
representatives but also the oppor
tunity for students to amend for
only the ninth time in over 40 years
the ASSU Constitution.
This year's proposed amend
ment, put forward by Executive
candidates Dan Ashton 'l4 and Billy
Gallagher 'l4, would reserve a given
number of seats in the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate for sophomore
and junior candidates. If the amend
ment passes, the Senate will be re
sponsible for determining in their
Bylaws how many seats will be set

aside.
Gallagher is a Daily staffer, and
Ashton is a member of The Daily's
Board of Directors.
Gallagher said that he and Ash
ton proposed the amendment to
help solve the historical problem of
underrepresentation for upperclass
men in the Senate, which some cur
rent and former ASSU officers be
lieve impedes the Senate's effective
ness.
"I would say that the average
student, especially upperclassmen,
doesn't feel like the Senate accu
rately or fairly represents them,"
Gallagher said. "[Most senators] get
elected as freshmen, and by the time
they learn how the Senate works
and how the school really works, it's

probably mid-fall, and by the time
they are able to start working on ef
fective change, they are almost
done."
The Senate and the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) both ap
proved the amendment for the bal
lot last month. If passed by two
thirds of the undergraduate popula
tion in this week's election and if ap
proved by either the Board of
Trustees or by President John Hen
nessy acting on the trustees' behalf,
the amendment will go into effect.
"The [amendment's] goal, which
is to change the culture that Senate
is a freshman-oriented activity, is re
ally great," said Senator Daniela
Olivos 'l5, who voted in favor of put
ting the amendment on the ballot.

"Having to think about how Senate
is more freshmen[-dominated] is a
really great way to talk about this is
sue."
While Olivos was strongly in fa
vor of the amendment, some sena
tors were less confident that it
should be adopted.
"I thought there was sufficient
rationale behind it to warrant refer
endum," said Senator Viraj Bindra
'l5, who voted in favor of the amend
ment. "Even by the end [of the de
bate], I don't think I had a firm idea
of whether or not it should definite
ly be implemented, but even if it was
I realize there are some controls
that the Senate as a body has over it,
and it made enough logical sense to
be put to a vote by the student

body."
Constitutional amendments are
eligible to be placed on the spring
ballot if they receive approval from
two-third of each legislative body or
if a petition in support of the amend
ment signed by at least five percent
of the student body is submitted to
the Elections Commission.
A second proposed amendment
Gallagher and Ashton also pro
posed a second amendment that will
not appear on the ballot, as it was
withdrawn from the Senate's con
sideration on March 12. The amend
ment originally outlined the creation
of a President's Discretionary Fund
that would receive unspent
money collected through stu
dent fees. The fund could
then be spent at the discre
tion of the ASSU President.
Before withdrawing the
amendment, Gallagher and
Ashton revised it to stipulate
that the unspent fees would
instead be collected in an Un
dergraduate Fee Reserves
Ftind, with the Senate and
Executive collaboratively de
termining the funds' alloca
tion.
Financial officers from
various student groups spoke
against the amendment at the
Senate's March 12 meeting,
arguing that special fees
groups sometimes need to
draw into then- reserve funds
for last-minute events.
Stanford Student Enter
prises (SSE) CEO Neveen
Mahmoud 'll also argued
against the passage of the bill,
although she agreed that "un
spent student fees are really
problematic."
"Written as is, I would be
uncomfortable moving it for
ward without, at the very,
very least, an explicit agree

ment about how the process
will take form moving for
ward," Mahmoud said.
In a recent interview, Gal
lagher said that he and Ash
ton plan to solicit student
feedback and discuss the is
sue with the legislative bod
ies, and may attempt to peti
tion 15 percent of the student
body to hold a special election
for a revised version of the
amendment this spring.
"It's definitely a good
thing that we tabled it, be
cause it wasn't ready and it
wouldn't have been right to
pass it yet," Gallagher said.
"But we got the discussion
rolling, and that is a really
good thing."

History of constitutional
amendments
The current ASSU Con
stitution was approved in
1969, and amendments have
been passed by the student
body and approved by the
University President or
Board of Trustees in eight
elections since then. The ma
jority of constitutional
amendments were approved
in the 1980s and 19905.
The last successful consti
tutional amendments were
passed in 2007, with the sup
port of 94.09 percent of grad
uate student voters and 83.17

percent of undergraduate
voters.
The first amendment
stipulated that if no candi
date slate received the ma
jority of votes, the winner of
the election would be decided
by the "Instant Runoff Vot
ing" procedure, and the sec
ond stated that the ASSU
President and Vice President
could be removed from office
by a four-fifths vote from
both the Senate and the
GSC.
The third amendment,
which was rejected by Presi
dent Hennessy, would have
inserted the phrase "that
portion" into a clause regard
ing the approval of the AS
SU's budget.
Last spring, the Govern
ing Documents Commission,
chaired by outgoing ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2
and Senate parliamentarian
Alex Kindel 'l4, proposed a
complete overhaul of the
Constitution.
According to former sen
ator Brianna Pang 'l3, a spe
cial contributor to the pro
posed Constitution, the pro
posal included updates to "re
flect current times," as well as
cleaner language and a specif
ic change to align Stanford's
standard of proof policy with
federal law.

The proposed Constitution
also provided for the creation
of the ASSU Student Legisla
ture, which would have com
bined the Senate and GSC,
and the ASSU Steeling Com
mittee, which would have co
ordinated the activities of the
ASSU governing bodies and
the administration.
After extensive criticism
from former ASSU Execu
tives and Senators material
ized, focusing on the lack of a
review period and the near
complete removal of protec
tions afforded students ac
cused of Fundamental Stan
dard violations, the Senate
and GSC both failed to pro
vide the necessary two
thirds approval for the re
vised Constitution to appear
on the spring ballot.
"After getting feedback
from people and debating a
lot of the issues and making
it available to the public, it
just fell behind the timeline,
and then the next Senate
never picked it up again,"
Pang said. "There were just
a lot of things that people dis
agreed on. Both legislative
bodies came to the conclu
sion that we just weren't
ready for it."
