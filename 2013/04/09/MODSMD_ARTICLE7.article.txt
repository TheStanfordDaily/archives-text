## ISC offers need-based fee waivers 
### MARIANNE LEVINE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Inter-Sorority
Council (ISC) has offered re
cruitment participation fee
waivers to prospective mem
bers this year, as part of an ef
fort to open a discussion of fi
nancial aid among sorority
members.
The ISC offered waivers
for the $35 fee to six prospec
tive new members (PNMs)
this year, in an effort to finan
cially accommodate students
of lower socio-economic back
grounds. According to Molly
Hayes 'l4 and Amanda Mc-
Farlane 'l4, ISC's vice presi
dents for recruitment, the de
cision was prompted by an e
mail last quarter from an up
perclassman who said that a
freshman he knew had ex
pressed concerns about being
unable to participate in re
cruitment due to the $35 fee.
Though Hayes and Mc-
Farlane described the e
mail's content and tone as "in
appropriate," both acknowl
edged the e-mail was the pri
mary impetus for offering the
waivers this year. McFarlane
expressed hope that offering
waivers might encourage a
more candid discussion of fi
nancial concerns in the future
among sorority members as a
whole.
"People know that sorori
ties are expensive, but no one
likes to talk about it, and
that's something we're trying
to face this year with giving
out these waivers." Hayes
said. "We're here to help.
Even if money is an uncom
fortable issue to talk about,
that's our job."
'A lot of girls are shy to
talk to us about these issues,"
McFarlane added. "Even
though it's confidential...
they still don't want to. It was
away for us to target the
community that does need fi
nancial assistance."
PNMs seeking the waiver
were asked to write a 500
word-essay explaining their
financial situation, indicating
whether they receive finan
cial aid and describing any
jobs currently held. Hayes
and McFarlane declined to
say how many applicants
sought the waiver, which was
disseminated to every fresh
man dorm.
"Because this is the first
year, a lot of it is us feeling it

out," Hayes said. "I think
we're looking for genuine
ness. We didn't want people
who didn't actually really
want the waiver to apply, so
that's why we had this entire
essay process."
McFarlane stated that a
significant portion of the re
cruitment fee stems from
renting out university space
for the PNMs and the seven
sorority chapters overseen by
the ISC.
"Big costs [include] room
reservations, because it's on
the weekends, because it's af
ter hours ... it's for seven dif
ferent chapters for hours
every night," McFarlane said.
"Similarly, there's equipment
costs. A lot of the time we
have to rent projectors [and]
chairs."
In order to set aside mon
ey for the six waivers, the ISC
increased the recruitment fee
by $5 from last year and
asked the chapters to cover
some of then* own expenses.
"We've been cutting it re
ally close," McFarlane said.
"The increase was necessary.
It worked out this year we
could give out six waivers. I
think next year ...we might
have fewer events, if we need
to do that to offer this oppor
tunity to more girls."
Unlike the ISC, the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC)
does not charge for fraternity
recruitment. According to
Matt Bettonville 'l4, IFC
president, the IFC's primary
responsibility is to coordinate,
monitor and establish rules
for recruitment.
"For us, it's really impor
tant that we're really accessi
ble during recruitment," Bet
tonville said. "We would nev
er consider charging for re
cruitment."
Bettonville described ISC
recruitment as more struc
tured and formal in compari
son to IFC recruitment, with
the expectation that fraterni
ties host their own events and
cover all ensuing costs remov
ing the need for recruitment
fees.
Pending financial re
sources, Hayes said that the
ISC will give out more waivers
next year. Financial aid for
chapter fees remains at the
discretion of individual sorori
ties.
