## Researchers produce biocomputer 
### MARGARET WENZLAU 
With the creation of genetic transis
tors, a team of Stanford bioengineers
has produced the final component
needed for the construction of a "bio
logical computer" that could be insert
ed into living cells.
According to researchers at the
Endy Lab, led by Assistant Professor
of Bioengineering Andrew Endy, such
biological computers could collect in
formation about cells, such as the rate
of cellular reproduction, and detect
the presence of toxins. They could
even command actions like the de
struction of cancerous cells.
"We were looking for hard things
to work on," Endy said. "[We] set out
to do very fundamental things [to]
get better at putting biomolecules to
gether to engineer systems, and pro
gram cells to work like we want."
While standard computers use
electrical transistors as on-off switch
es for programs, Endy's computer uti
lizes biological "transcriptors." These
transcriptors control whether or not
RNA polymerase can travel through
logic gates by the transmission of true
or false answers based on information
from within the cell.
The development of the transistors

builds upon previous work in the Endy
Lab, which previously developed oth
er necessary components of a biologi
cal computer a memory system for
storing data and a mechanism that can
transfer genetic information between
cells.
According to Pakpoom Subsoon
torn M.S. 'lO Ph.D. 'l4, a researcher
in the Endy Lab, Endy's new model of
programming biological cells is much
simpler to implement than previous
methods.
Monica Ortiz M.S. 'O9 Ph.D. 'l3,
who is also a researcher in the Endy
Lab, noted that that simplicity offers
greater potential for application on a
broad range of projects. To that end,
Endy's team has made the logic gates
accessible to scientists around the
world for their own research.
"Our hope is that [other re
searchers] will take these logic gates
as a nice starting point to do increas
ingly complex tasks within biological
cells," Ortiz said. "It is going to be ex
citing to see what other people do in
building upon this work. The applica
tions can be really broad."
Outside researchers have already
employed the lab's logic gates in con
trolling the metabolism of cells, meas
uring levels of proliferation of thera

peutic T-cells and regulating biosyn
thesis, the process by which a living
organism creates a chemical.
While initial research seems prom
ising, lab researchers emphasized the
work yet to be done, such as expand
ing the logic gates' usage from E. Coli
cells to other organisms or accelerat
ing and extending the capabilities of
biological computers to approach
those of conventional electronics.
"We have four enzymes. Every
time we build a transcriptor we have
to use one," Endy said. "We can only
build computers that are four switches
big, so these are some of the world's
weakest computers."
Subsoontorn agreed that, although
the team's results are encouraging,
the project needs further develop
ment before biological computers can
be widely implemented.
"This project is exciting but it is
important to keep in mind that we
have a long way to go," Subsoontorn
said. "Any scientific engineering enter
prise is incremental, and someone will
build upon our work long before this gets
out to application or to make a huge im
pact."
