## Land of the free, haven for women's sports 
### Tom Taylor Tom Taylor's niece shrieked the first time she saw him on Skype. If you have the same reaction when you see his mug shot in the paper, email him at tom.taylor@stanford. edu follow him on Twitter @DailyTom Taylor 
Sometimes it's hard to see
prejudice or lack of access
to opportunity quite so
clearly when it's not really
personal. I'm white, I'm
male, I'm middle class, and I grew up
in a comfortable paid of a first-world
country. The struggles that I've faced
have been unfortunate and tough, but
none were predicated on my place of
birth or my DNA.
But last summer my brother and
his girlfriend had their first child, a
girl, technically my niece even if I re
fuse to accept that I'm old enough to
be an uncle I will never be that old.
Living on the other side of the world
means I still haven't met the kid, and I
have to admit being slightly scared by
small children. But as I started to
write my feature for The Daily's
women's sport series, due out this Fri
day, suddenly I realized I had a
stronger connection than ever before
to this issue.
Last year's U.S. Election seemed a
little crazy to this impartial observer,
especially with respect to the issue of
women's rights. For all its many flaws,
it made me feel good about my own
home, the U.K. How could such basic
human rights be challenged in a mod
ern, open and free society?
But when I look instead at equality
in my chosen field of interest —sports
I have to admit feeling far less com
fortable about the U.K. when it comes
to the issue.
Title IX has no equal back home,
perhaps in large part because college
sports there are virtually nonexistent.
With perhaps the lone exception of the
rowing teams of Oxford and Cam
bridge, the idea of varsity sports just
doesn't really exist. Unless you're on
one of the many club teams, you would
never care about that specific team.
They're not on television, they get no
appreciable funding and no one gets
an athletic scholar-ship to go to school.
Talented athletes don't, as a gener
al rule, go to universities —why waste
several years of your professional ca
reer getting a degree?
As a result, after high school,
women's sports are left to the mercy of
this professional world, which doesn't
exactly have a good track record in ac
ceptance of new sports.
In the US, even the biggest and
most important sport on this planet—
soccer has struggled to gain its
place alongside the Big Four-. Vice ver
sa, none of America's favorite pas
times have managed to eke out more
than a specialist niche in the U.K.; the
indigenous sports soccer, rugby
union, rugby league and cricket, to
name but a few—are just too popular
and too powerful.
However, the key difference be
tween these two countries is that the
U.S. college system provides, effec
tively a professional outlet for ama
teur high school players. As a direct
result of Title IX, it also generates a
huge number of professional women
athletes, making it much more likely
that professional women's leagues can
build a following and compete on tal
ent and ability with the men's.
The WNBA, while being consider
ably smaller and poorer than its older
brother, the NBA, has still operated as
a professional league since 1996 and
recently signed a new TV rights deal
with ESPN that will bring in $1 million
per team annual
The same cannot be said of U.K.
professional sports, which remain a
distinctly male affair. There are flash
es of equality every time the Olympics
roll around, but even the highest level
of women's soccer in England, the
Women's Super League (WSL), re
mains just semi-professional.
Where the WNBA draws in aver
age crowds over 7,000, the WSL
struggles to pull in even 700.
It is easy in such an environment to
be unintentionally and unconsciously
sexist, and I will hold my hand up and
admit my own personal guilt in that re
spect; until stepping foot on U.S. soil, I
had pretty much zero interest in
women's sports. Luckily, though, Stan
ford's Athletics Department showed
me the error of my ways.
But too many back home haven't
yet seen that light and too many girls
growing up with athletic ambitions will
never be given the chance to succeed.
The Land of Opportunity for women's
athletes is the United States, and any
dreams of athletic stardom are Amer
ican Dreams.
