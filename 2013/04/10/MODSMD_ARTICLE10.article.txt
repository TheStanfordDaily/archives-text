# SLATE PROFILE: SO/DE TABOADA
## Chaparral slate play down student concerns, differences

"A Pedagogy of Self-Discovery": Anthony
So and Ryan De Taboada
For Anthony So 'l4 and Ryan De Taboada
'l4, the revolution is inevitable and you
may even be a part of it too.
This year's Stanford Chaparral slate has
taken a futuristic approach to contesting the
upcoming ASSU elections, featuring, in So, a
robot presidential candidate and, in De
Taboada, a portable battery pack.
"We're all robots and we'd like everyone
else to know they're robots too," So said.
So and De Taboada downplayed the signif
icance of issues like a controversial class
scheduling proposal, noting that the existence
of a shared consciousness among Stanford
students offered the opportunity to dissolve
redundant power structures like the ASSU.
"We're abolishing all government, so noth
ing bad can happen," So said.
"We'd still allocate money to clubs," De
Taboada added. "There'd only be one club."
Meanwhile, the slate also put forward an
ambitious capital plan for implementation
during their time in office.
"We need more outlets ... [and] we need a
monorail," So said.
Acknowledging the slate's distant chance
of being elected, So said he might focus his at
tention instead on persuading his fellow stu
dents and rival Executive slates of their

true robotic nature, as concealed beneath su
perficially distinct human forms.
"I guarantee you that if you just gutted
any number of those minority people, they'd
all look the same on the inside," So claimed.
"We should be focusing more on convinc
ing Dan [Ashton] and Billy [Gallagher] that
they're robots," De Taboada added.
