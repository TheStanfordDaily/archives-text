## ASSU Senate debates allowing future members to study abroad 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
At their last meeting before the ASSU's
spring elections, the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate debated the possibility of altering the
body's bylaws to allow future senators to study
abroad during their term.
According to Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5, the
debate first arose in the new subcommittee fo
cused on facilitating the transition to next
year's Senate. Bindra said that the commit
tee's purpose is to generate recommendations
for policy objectives for future senators, as
well as to enable a smooth transition after the
elections.
At a straw poll at the end of the meeting,
senators Daniela Olivos 'l5, Branden Crouch
'l4, Brandon Hightower 'l5 and Bindra said
that they were open to the idea of letting sen
ators study abroad during spring quarter.
However, other senators had reservations,
bringing up logistical issues such as determin
ing which senators could study abroad and
whether senators abroad would be excluded
from the Senate or offered the opportunity to
remotely participate in meetings.
While Senator Anna Brezhneva 'l5 said she
believed the proposal would encourage more
candidates to run for Senate, she believed it
would have a negative impact on the Senate as
a whole.
'At the end of the day, I think it is a bad idea
because you can never predict the people who
are going to leave or take a leave of absence,"
she said. "I think it is important when you are
running for Senate that you are committing to
the full year, like we all did."
ASSU Assistant Financial Manager
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 also expressed
concerns about the proposal, citing the impor
tance of having senators in attendance during
the transition period in the spring.
Trusheim said that a proposed constitution
al amendment reserving Senate seats for up
perclassmen might help solve the historic un
derrepresentation of juniors and seniors, and
suggested that if the amendment passes, the
Senate "try that out" before making other
changes.

Senator Shahab Fadavi 'l5 agreed, arguing
that while allowing some members of class
president slates to study abroad works be
cause their workload is more "seasonal," sena
tors need to be on campus at all times.
"We have a constant level of work, regard
less of whether it is fall or winter or spring
quarter," he said. "I would say maybe even
more so in spring quarter, because we have to
help the next class of senators transition."
The Senate did not come to a consensus on
the issue, and agreed to continue discussion in
future meetings.
Earlier in the meeting, Trusheim informed
senators that fee waivers are currently above
10 percent for most special fees student
groups, with between 700 and 800 undergrad
uate students waiving fees for all or most spe
cial fees groups.
According to Trusheim, this waiver rate is
the "highest it's been during a normal, average
quarter" in his time at Stanford, though he
said that the additional waivers will not affect
the active budgets of groups unless they have
no reserve funds.
"We're not talking about tremendous
amounts of money" Trusheim said. "It's prob
ably not a big deal for most groups, but I don't
know if groups have budgeted down to every
penny."
Graduate Student Council (GSC) member
Sjoerd De Ridder Ph.D.'l3 also appeared at
the meeting to present a bill to the Senate
that, if approved, would allow the GSC to
withdraw $5,000 from the Graduate Buffer
Fund to advertise a concert at Frost Ampithe
ater in May.
Because only eight of the 13 remaining sen
ators were present at the meeting, senators
were confused about whether or not they had
quorum to vote on the bill, and decided to put
the bill on previous notice for a vote next week.
After a two-minute recess, senators decid
ed that enough members were present to vote
on funding bills, and approved $45,588.63 in
general fees allocations and special fees modifi
cations for 15 student groups.
