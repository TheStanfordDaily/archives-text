# How to lose March Madness in 63 games
## 
### David Eng 
Congrats, Louisville. You
have deprived my bracket
of its last chance at re
demption. That came out
a bit shallow, especially
given the heart that Rick Pitino's
team just showed us en route to cap
turing its third NCAA tournament
championship. Please forgive me it
was a rough March.
Alas, watching Luke Hancock &
Co. celebrate under the raining con
fetti in those fashion-forward (i.e. ug
ly) uniforms made me feel like the kid
at the carnival who misfired so badly
on the beanbag toss that he didn't
even get his consolation lollipop.
(Those were dark, dark days...) A
Michigan victory certainly would
have been this consolation.
I admit my (best*) bracket wasn't
a complete mess. It outdid 52 percent
of the brackets entered into
ESPN.com's Tournament Challenge.
In addition to selecting Michigan to
be the national champion, I also pre
dicted first-round upsets by 12th
seeded Oregon and Ole Miss, as well
as long shot victories by 14th-seeded
Harvard over New Mexico and
(apologies, die-hard Cardinal fans)
Cal Berkeley over UNLV**.
Truth be told, my first-round
bracket had a few blemishes here and
there: FGCU's win over Georgetown,
UCLAs implosion against Minneso
ta. Oh, and there was also that Wichi
ta State team that I thought was go
ing lose to Pittsburgh. Yeah. Whoops.
... Big whoops. Though lamenting
over the West region of my bracket
has proven oddly cathartic up to this
point, it hardly seems an appropriate
use of time or resource. No point cry
ing over spilled milk, as they say
A saving grace of sorts, I predict
ed the outcome of the tournament
more accurately than my female ac
quaintance, whom I shall more rele
vantly reference as The Coin Flipper.
She had three 16-over-l seed upsets.
(FYI, no first seed has ever lost in the
first round.)
Anyways, it's a good thing that
Northwestern State, Memphis, New
Mexico and Temple didn't reach the
Final Four. Otherwise, I may have
been compelled to pull a Harvey Dent
for a day and to see how things would
go***. Phewf. I can only imagine the
looks I would have gotten.
I suppose the source of my disap
pointment in my above-average, but
hardly outstanding bracket really
stems from my high expectations.
Amid a fangirl obsession with Nate
Silver at the onset of the tournament,
I felt as if reading his hot-selling
book, "The Signal and the Noise:
Why So Many Predictions Fail but
Some Don't," and a few of his New
York Times FiveThirtyEight blog
posts had enhanced my predictive ca
pacity.
Isn't forecasting the outcome of a
set of 63 college basketball games
similar to forecasting a presidential
election? I would come to realize this
to be untrue. Nevertheless, I had
high hopes for my bracket this year.
Granted, this year, there were far
more Cinderella squads and no truly
dominant first seeds. Remember last
year's national champion? Only The
Coin Flipper and the completely bas
ketball-illiterate would have bet
against John Calipaif s University of
Kentucky team, which featured five
future first-round NBA draft picks,
including Naismith Player of the Year
Anthony Davis.
Last year, there was no Wichita
State. The lowest-seeded team to
reach the Final Four was (who else?)
Louisville, seeded fourth in the West
that year. There were two first-round
upsets of No. 2 seeds last year: Nor
folk State's upset of Mizzou and
Lehigh's upset of Duke. Yet neither of
these surprise teams advanced to the
Sweet 16.
In light of recent events, I have re
solved that I am no Nate Silver. I
have no Pete Rose-esque influence on
the outcome of the game, nor do I
even have a Steve Bartman-esque in
fluence on the outcome of the game.
(See: angry Moises Alou leers at
Cubs fan.) But here's the thing: I
have my intuition. And hopefully, one
year I'll get it right.
You see, unlike The Coin Flipper, I
make my own chance.
* We shall not speak of the other five
that I entered into the ESPN chal
lenge. Not to mention the ones I sub
mitted on Yahoo! Sports. I have no
life.
** This constitutes the win-win sce
nario. Since this 12-over-5 game con
tributed to a near-unblemished first
round bracket, I took a victory lap
down the Twain North hallway Had
Cal been eliminated, I would have still
taken the victory lap.
*** Though I have not made deci-
sions based on exphcit chance,
I would imagine that shaking
an original Magic Eight Bah
would be far more enjoyable
(and far less mainstream)
than flipping a coin though
Dodeca-Face doesn't have
quite the same allure as Two-
Face does.

David Eng thinks that the
Golden State Warriors will
win the NBA Title this sea
son. Let him knoiv why

Congrats, Louisville. You
have deprived my bracket
of its last chance at re
demption. That came out
a bit shallow, especially
given the heart that Rick Pitino's
team just showed us en route to cap
turing its third NCAA tournament
championship. Please forgive me it
was a rough March.
Alas, watching Luke Hancock &
Co. celebrate under the raining con
fetti in those fashion-forward (i.e. ug
ly) uniforms made me feel like the kid
at the carnival who misfired so badly
on the beanbag toss that he didn't
even get his consolation lollipop.
(Those were dark, dark days...) A
Michigan victory certainly would
have been this consolation.
I admit my (best*) bracket wasn't
a complete mess. It outdid 52 percent
of the brackets entered into
ESPN.com's Tournament Challenge.
In addition to selecting Michigan to
be the national champion, I also pre
dicted first-round upsets by 12th
seeded Oregon and Ole Miss, as well
as long shot victories by 14th-seeded
Harvard over New Mexico and
(apologies, die-hard Cardinal fans)
Cal Berkeley over UNLV**.
Truth be told, my first-round
bracket had a few blemishes here and
there: FGCU's win over Georgetown,
UCLAs implosion against Minneso
ta. Oh, and there was also that Wichi
ta State team that I thought was go
ing lose to Pittsburgh. Yeah. Whoops.
... Big whoops. Though lamenting
over the West region of my bracket
has proven oddly cathartic up to this
point, it hardly seems an appropriate
use of time or resource. No point cry
ing over spilled milk, as they say
A saving grace of sorts, I predict
ed the outcome of the tournament
more accurately than my female ac
quaintance, whom I shall more rele
vantly reference as The Coin Flipper.
She had three 16-over-l seed upsets.
(FYI, no first seed has ever lost in the
first round.)
Anyways, it's a good thing that
Northwestern State, Memphis, New
Mexico and Temple didn't reach the
Final Four. Otherwise, I may have
been compelled to pull a Harvey Dent
for a day and to see how things would
go***. Phewf. I can only imagine the
looks I would have gotten.
I suppose the source of my disap
pointment in my above-average, but
hardly outstanding bracket really
stems from my high expectations.
Amid a fangirl obsession with Nate
Silver at the onset of the tournament,
I felt as if reading his hot-selling
book, "The Signal and the Noise:
Why So Many Predictions Fail but
Some Don't," and a few of his New
York Times FiveThirtyEight blog
posts had enhanced my predictive ca
pacity.
Isn't forecasting the outcome of a
set of 63 college basketball games
similar to forecasting a presidential
election? I would come to realize this
to be untrue. Nevertheless, I had
high hopes for my bracket this year.
Granted, this year, there were far
more Cinderella squads and no truly
dominant first seeds. Remember last
year's national champion? Only The
Coin Flipper and the completely bas
ketball-illiterate would have bet
against John Calipaif s University of
Kentucky team, which featured five
future first-round NBA draft picks,
including Naismith Player of the Year
Anthony Davis.
Last year, there was no Wichita
State. The lowest-seeded team to
reach the Final Four was (who else?)
Louisville, seeded fourth in the West
that year. There were two first-round
upsets of No. 2 seeds last year: Nor
folk State's upset of Mizzou and
Lehigh's upset of Duke. Yet neither of
these surprise teams advanced to the
Sweet 16.
In light of recent events, I have re
solved that I am no Nate Silver. I
have no Pete Rose-esque influence on
the outcome of the game, nor do I
even have a Steve Bartman-esque in
fluence on the outcome of the game.
(See: angry Moises Alou leers at
Cubs fan.) But here's the thing: I
have my intuition. And hopefully, one
year I'll get it right.
You see, unlike The Coin Flipper, I
make my own chance.
* We shall not speak of the other five
that I entered into the ESPN chal
lenge. Not to mention the ones I sub
mitted on Yahoo! Sports. I have no
life.
** This constitutes the win-win sce
nario. Since this 12-over-5 game con
tributed to a near-unblemished first
round bracket, I took a victory lap
down the Twain North hallway Had
Cal been eliminated, I would have still
taken the victory lap.
*** Though I have not made deci-
sions based on exphcit chance,
I would imagine that shaking
an original Magic Eight Bah
would be far more enjoyable
(and far less mainstream)
than flipping a coin though
Dodeca-Face doesn't have
quite the same allure as Two-
Face does.
