# SQUEAKER IN SAN JOSE
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
Tuesday night's baseball
matchup against San Jose State
was truly a tale of two games. For
the first five innings, the Cardinal
was in complete control, jumping
out to a big lead early and stifling
the Spartan offense.

In the sixth inning, everything
came apart for Stanford in a big
way. A Cardinal bullpen that had
been rock solid all year finally gave
way, allowing the Spartans to come
all the way back. In the end, howev
er, the Card (17-10,6-4 Pac-12) was
able to tack on late insurance runs
and squeak by the Spartans (11-22)
by a score of 10-8.
For the first half of the game, it
looked as if the Cardinal was in for
an easy victory against a scuffling
Spartan team. The recently ignited
offense pounded Spartan starter
James Glawe for five runs on four
hits in the second inning, greatly
aided by a throwing error commit
ted by first baseman Matt Carroll.
In that second inning, the Car
dinal quickly got runners on second
and third with one out. Carroll then
set the stage for the rest of the in
ning with his throwing error on a
ball off the bat of senior leftfielder
Justin Ringo. The defensive miscue
allowed Ringo to scoot all the way
around to second and scored both
runners, giving the Card an early
2-0 lead.
The error proved costly for San
Jose State, as Stanford benefited
from a pair of run-scoring doubles
from both of its catchers to claim
an early five-run lead. Sophomore
Wayne Taylor, normally a catcher

but playing center field, doubled
Ringo home and junior Brant
Whiting followed with a two-run
double of his own a few batters lat
er.
In the meantime, sophomore
lefty John Hochstatter, Stanford's
starting pitcher, kept the Cardinal
on top with a stingy performance in
which he gave up only three hits
and one earned run in four innings
of work.
Everything was looking good
for the Cardinal until the sixth in
ning began.
The Cardinal first turned to
sophomore righty David Schmidt
to hold the lead. After pitching an
uneventful fifth inning, Schmidt
was unable to record an out to open
the sixth as he allowed three

straight hits one of which scored
a run and a walk to open the in
ning before being pulled in favor of
senior righthander Dean McArdle.
McArdle didn't fare much bet
ter, giving up three RBI singles
and a run-scoring double play as
the Spartan offense roared back to
make it a 7-6 game
Only one inning later, McArdle
allowed a leadoff triple to Spartan
centerfielder Andre Mercurio.
Mercurio would come around to
score on Carroll's double in the
very next at-bat to knot the contest
at 7-7 after seven innings of play
The Cardinal, however, would
not go quietly In the ninth inning,
with extra innings seemingly in
evitable, the bats came alive for one
final push to carry the team to vie

tory.
Junior Austin Wilson, playing in
his third game back from an ex
tended elbow injury, started the
rally with a double into left. After
third baseman Alex Blandino was
walked on four pitches, Ringo came
through once again with a double
into the gap in right-center to bring
Wilson home.
Two more runs would eventual
ly come around on a sacrifice fly by
Taylor and a passed ball, giving the
Cardinal a three-run lead that it
would not relinquish. Although the
Spartans threatened in the bottom
of the inning and scored a run, jun
ior AJ Vanegas sealed the victory
by freezing catcher Sheldon
