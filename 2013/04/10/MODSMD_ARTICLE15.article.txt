# Card tennis dominates on Senior Night
## 
### ANNA BLUE STAFF WRITER 
It hurts to lose on Senior Night,
so on Tuesday night the No. 13
Stanford women's tennis team
made sure to avoid that fate. In its
final home match of the regular sea
son, the Cardinal (14-3, 6-1 Pac-12)
sent the University of Hawaii
women's tennis team packing with a
7-0 win.

The Stanford women easily se
cured the doubles point and six sin
gles wins, leaving the Hawaii
women with only 17 combined game
wins. The Cardinal sweep this time
around was a repeat of last fall's en
counter, when Stanford took all the
match points while visiting Kona.
Head Coach Lele Forood noted
the play of her No. 1 and 2 players,
saying that their strength bodes
well for the future.

"We had some pretty impressive
scores in the match today, great for
building for the big matches this
weekend," Forood said.
Among those impressive scores
was the doubles win by Stanford's
No. 1 team, the dynamic pair of sen
ior Stacey Tan and sophomore Ellen
Tsay, who are ranked No. 43 nation
ally. They struck down Hawaii's No

1. duo of Katarina Poljakova and
Martina Kostalova 8-3.
Stanford's No. 2 pair of juniors
Kristie Ahn and Amelia Herring
had a slightly tougher time, ulti
mately pulling out the 8-6 win. The
third pair of Natalie Dillon and
Krista Hardebeck cruised to an 8-1
victory.
Coach Forood praised her team's

consistency, remarking, "Everyone
was taking care of their own lousi
ness today."
Stanford freshman Lindsey
Kostas clinched the singles point
with a 6-1,6-1 rout at the No. 6 spot.
Ahn and Tsay also posted wins by
the same score at the No. 1 and No.
4 spots respectively.
The match gave the Cardinal its
third straight victory and 10th of
the last 11 competitions. The Rain
bow Wahines concluded their four
game tour of California with their
third loss of the visit.
Stanford will now continue
charging ahead toward the post
season. The Cardinal moved up one
spot in the national rankings and
will look to try to keep building mo
mentum through its final three
matchups of the regular season.
On Friday, the Cardinal heads
to Tucson to play No. 75 Arizona,
before visiting Tempe to take on
No. 21 Arizona State, a match
which the team identified as a vital
battle.
