# Road trip awaits for Stanford lax

### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The No. 15 Stanford women's
lacrosse team (7-3, 2-1 MPSF) will
cap off a three-game road stretch
with matchups against Saint Mary's
and No. 4 Northwestern this week
end.
The Cardinal's five-game win
ning streak was broken in a 14-10
loss to Denver last Friday in which
Stanford was held scoreless for 18
minutes in the first half as the Pio
neers built a six-goal lead.
Sophomore Meredith Kalinows
ki and freshman Julia Burns led the
Cardinal with three points each, but
it wasn't enough to avoid the team's
first Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation (MPSF) loss of the season.
Stanford will look to bounce back
in another conference game at Saint
Mary's this afternoon. The Cardinal
has never lost in 25 meetings with
the Gaels (3-6,1-3 MPSF).
Last season, Stanford took a 16-7
victory over Saint Mary's in its final
regular season game.
Seniors Jillian Chong and Aman
da Cross lead a Saint Mary's attack
that is averaging 11.33 goals per
game, ranked seventh among the
nine teams in the MPSF. Chong has
recorded 21 goals and 8 assists for
29 points, while Cross has also tal

lied 29 points on 17 goals and 12 as
sists. Five other attackers have dou
ble-digit point totals for the Gaels.
In goal, Katherine Herzog has
played every minute for Saint Mary's.
The junior is allowing 13.52 goals per
game while positing a .372 save per
centage, last in the conference.
The Gaels will come into the
game with almost two weeks of rest,
as their last game was a 19-2 win
over Stetson on March 29.
After the game against Saint
Mary's, Stanford will travel to the
Midwest to face traditional power
Northwestern.
The Wildcats (11-1), who have
won seven of the past eight national
championships, will provide the Car
dinal with another opportunity to
prove its standing on the national
stage. Stanford has only beaten
Northwestern once in eight tries.
In 2012, Northwestern easily de
feated Stanford 18-6 despite 13
saves from Cardinal goalkeeper
Lyndsey Munoz.
The Wildcats boast a powerful
attack averaging close to 14 goals
per game. Senior Erin Fitzgerald
tops the charts with 39 goals and 5
assists for 44 points this season, fol
lowed by junior Alyssa Leonard (22
goals, 8 assists) and senior Amanda
