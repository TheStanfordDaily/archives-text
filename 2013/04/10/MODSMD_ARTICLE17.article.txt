## EDITORIAL Cautious Optimism in Ashton-Gallagher 
### 
For the 2013-14 ASSU Execu
tive, The Stanford Daily Edi
torial Committee unanimous
ly endorses Dan Ashton 'l4 and Bil
ly Gallagher 'l4, the slate that we
feel will be best able to represent
the student body and effectively
utilize the ASSU to further student
interests in the upcoming year.
Throughout interviews with the
two sincere candidate slates, Tues
day's Executive slate debate and
extensive internal deliberation,
several things remained clear:
while both slates have a true pas
sion for the student body as a
whole, both fall short in differ
ent ways of combining a well
rounded, detailed and ambitious
platform with the leadership and
judgment to realistically advance
that platform within the ASSU's
limited framework. Nevertheless,
we applaud Ashton-Gallagher's un
doubted ability to lead and manage
the ASSU, and feel confident in
their capacity and willingness to ex
pand the scope and detail of their
agenda to most effectively serve the
student body.
This is a critical time for student
government on this campus. From
the ever-present stigma surround
ing mental health and sexual assault
issues to the recent spate of con
cerns over student autonomy on the
Farm, the ASSU is in search of an
Executive who can do more than qui
etly tinker at best on the pe
riphery of those issues, or neglect
ing them altogether leave them to
be taken up by someone else. The
student body needs leaders who have
experience representing, improving
and leading a genuinely diverse
range of student organizations, and
moreover conveying the interests of
those students to administrators. As
Ashton and Gallagher emphasized
repeatedly the ASSU has lost nearly
all influence and credibility in the
eyes of administrators and students
alike. Their slate is the best choice to
restore that credibility and influence
by offering steady and astute guid
ance, and by building off existing
lines of communication with the ad
ministration.
The Executive is also and
equally importantly faced with a
legislative body riddled with systemic
shortcomings. Ashton and Gallagher
have already shown the wherewithal,
initiative and savvy to tackle the Sen
ate's structural woes head on, putting

forward two constitutional amend
ments to resolve a lack of upperclass
men representation among Senators
and the vast accumulation of unused
special fees requests. Even as the lat
ter amendment was withdrawn, their
efforts demonstrate both purpose
and ability. We encourage them to
continue such efforts, albeit with a
greater range of consultation, in
restoring the ASSU's ability to gov
ern effectively, and we applaud their
intent to do so in a practical and real
istic manner.
However, the Ashton-Gallagher
slate is not without shortcomings
and ambiguities. While the candi
dates emphasize the importance
of giving the student body a
stronger and more relevant voice
and bridging gaps with adminis
trators, they failed to outline the
details necessary. Furthermore,
Ashton-Gallagher's proposal to in
crease funding for short-term
events such as Frost Revival and
football tailgate viewing parties
may not only be an inaccurate rep
resentation of the wishes of the
general student body, but may al
so come in conflict with furthering
long-term reform goals. The can
didates themselves admit that the
student body's needs will con
stantly be changing; as such, they
have disappointingly not provided
a concrete way to measure then*
progress or offered finite objectives
for which they are accountable
should they win the election.
Gomez and Patino's strengths
and they are not insignificant lie
in areas of advocacy for students
and student groups, in addition to a
proven ability to organize students
effectively towards advocacy goals.
As such, we feel that the stagnancy
and relative irrelevance of the AS
SU recently may diminish their abil
ity to effect change on this campus.
Nevertheless, at a time when the
ASSU is by all accounts a limited
body envisioning it as a focal point
for student advocacy seems to retain
little grounding in reality or student
desires. Moreover, we lack confi
dence that Gomez and Patino could
effectively balance and legislate an
overly ambitious agenda, or ap
proach issues such as divestment in
a manner that best represents both
the ASSU's abilities and limitations
and the interests of the student
body in its entirety.
A key point in the Gomez-Patino

platform addresses the need to di
versify the ranks of our faculty. We
agree wholeheartedly with this goal.
However, we disagree that the office
of ASSIJ Executive is the best
means of accomplishing this goal.
We urge them to agitate for deans to
pay more attention towards the de
mographics in their tenure tracks.
Create a petition on the ASSU's
website. Speak to departments that
are lagging in diversity. Mobilize the
student body. There are all things
that can be accomplished and
perhaps best accomplished from
outside the confines of the ASSU.
This endorsement remains a cau
tious one. Ashton-Gallagher offers
the Stanford community the most
effective and focused leadership
among the options presented, with a
minimal learning curve and the
technical savvy to make realistic and
effective changes to a broken ASSU.
Their platform would benefit from
the ambition of the Gomez-Patino
slate, but we are fully confident that
they will meet the current and fu
ture demands of the student body
in conjunction with implementing
the first steps on the path to a reha
bilitated, reinvigorated and respon
sible student government.
