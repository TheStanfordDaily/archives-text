# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## Where Ambiguity Fits Into a Relationship 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
Here at Stanford, you switch
directions every 10 weeks
and leave one set of people
for another just as you are transi
tioning from acquaintances to real
friends. You are a tiny blip among
7,000 fast-moving, overscheduled
lives.
Friends flow in and out of my
day-to-day life in a continuous and
unpredictable stream. One leaves
for Germany, another has a light
quarter, and the inevitable scatter
ing that the summer brings hangs
over all of my relationships like a
time bomb. Despite my efforts to
keep everyone in one place at one
time, we shoot off at a million differ
ent angles and have to be content
with the lucky intersections. This
flux is crazy-making, lonely and ex
citing. It feels poetically appropri
ate that at a time when I change
vastly from day to day, my relation
ships should be ambiguous and un
predictable as well.
Which brings me to the point of
this column. When students com

plain about the dating climate at
Stanford, would they really want to
change it? Or is there something in
the uncertainty and spontaneity of a
loosely defined hook-up culture that
not only fits the flux of our age
group but also has us all addicted? I
used to think people didn't say what
they meant in relationships because
they were trying to be mysterious
and play games. Now I'm beginning
to think that people don't say what
they mean because they enjoy the
ambiguity of a relationship that is
somewhere between friends and
significant others. Many people
don't know what they mean because
it changes so drastically from one
day to the next, and saying nothing
might even be a respectful gesture.
Both of these possibilities are
very different from playing games.
Playing games implies some knowl
edge of the game, some strategy
and premeditation. Enjoying ambi
guity and not knowing what you
mean to say are products of a more
innocent cluelessness that comes

from the flux of being in college.
Playing games implies that there is a
game to be played, something I don't
totally buy. The excitement of the
chase is real, but I don't think the
chase is as close to the heart of our
addiction as is the promise that
stems from unpredictability, a prom
ise of never getting bored and feed
ing an insatiable appetite for novelty.
The words themselves are
laughably ambiguous: "exclusive,"
"hooking up," even "dating." (Are
we talking about committed and
monogamous or going on dates with
many different people at once?) The
vocabulary is lacking because our
intentions are that unclear. The
malleable terms are more true to
the real story; they match nicely the
changing nature of college life.
I think we could all learn to say
what we mean a little more elo
quently to give each other clarity
when clarity is in order. We could all
work toward a more explicit vocab
ulary. But in the midst of a wildly
changing time in your life, learning
where ambiguity is appropriate in
relationships can save you some
sanity. It can feel like the floor is
shifting under your feet when you
don't know who you will be tomor
row. (Will you still be a Zen Bud
dhist? Will the people you love be
3,000 miles away? Will you still love
Norah Jones?)
When you try to force too much
clarity onto your murky 20s, that
shifting floor beneath you can feel
like quicksand clutching at your
legs and getting you stuck. When
you relax into the uncertainty a lit
tle bit, it can feel more like one of
those moving walkways at an air
port, taking you toward something
hazy and unknown, but moving you
forward nonetheless.
