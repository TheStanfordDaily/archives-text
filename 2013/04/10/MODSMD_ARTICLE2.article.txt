# Candidates debate critical issues
## Exec slates discuss administration, mental health 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
In an engaged and occasionally
bizarre debate on Monday night at
the CoHo, this year's three ASSU
Executive candidate slates dis
cussed and sparred over supporting
mental health initiatives on cam
pus, increasing student feedback in
administrative decisions and im
proving the reputation of the AS
SU.
The debate, held two days be
fore voting opens, was moderated
by Miles Bennett-Smith 'l3, editor
in chief of The Daily, and Judith
Romea 'l4, editor in chief of The
Stanford Review.
The moderators began with a

period of general questioning be
fore directing specific questions at
the three slates: Gallagher-Ashton,
Gomez-Patino and A Pedagogy of
Self Discovery, The Chaparral's
joke slate.
The Chaparral slate, composed
of Ryan De Taboada 'l4 and Antho
ny So 'l4, said little of substance,
instead claiming that they were ro
bots and arguing that the ASSU
should be abolished.
"You know us as the robot candi
dates for student government, but
we're also the party candidates,"
De Taboada joked.
Throughout the debate, Gal
lagher and Ashton emphasized
