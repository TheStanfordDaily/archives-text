# Candidates debate critical issues
## Exec slates discuss administration, mental health 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
In an engaged and occasionally
bizarre debate on Monday night at
the CoHo, this year's three ASSU
Executive candidate slates dis
cussed and sparred over supporting
mental health initiatives on cam
pus, increasing student feedback in
administrative decisions and im
proving the reputation of the AS
SU.
The debate, held two days be
fore voting opens, was moderated
by Miles Bennett-Smith 'l3, editor
in chief of The Daily, and Judith
Romea 'l4, editor in chief of The
Stanford Review.
The moderators began with a

period of general questioning be
fore directing specific questions at
the three slates: Gallagher-Ashton,
Gomez-Patino and A Pedagogy of
Self Discovery, The Chaparral's
joke slate.
The Chaparral slate, composed
of Ryan De Taboada 'l4 and Antho
ny So 'l4, said little of substance,
instead claiming that they were ro
bots and arguing that the ASSU
should be abolished.
"You know us as the robot candi
dates for student government, but
we're also the party candidates,"
De Taboada joked.
Throughout the debate, Gal
lagher and Ashton emphasized

their leadership experience within
the ASSU and in other student or
ganizations, including The Daily,
Los Hermanos and Kappa Sigma.
"I've done a lot of different
things and have a lot of experience
meeting with really cool adminis
trators," Ashton, last year's
deputy chair of the ASSU Under
graduate Senate, said. "The AS
SU is broken, and we have the ex
perience to make it more rele
vant."
Gallagher is a Daily staffer, and
Ashton is a member of The Daily's
Board of Directors.
Gomez and Patino also refer
enced their experience with stu
dent groups and communities, in
cluding the First-Generation Low
Income Partnership (FLIP), El
Centro Chicano and Movimiento
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA).
"What inspired me to run for
the position of ASSU Executive
has really been my involvement in
different student groups," Gomez
said. "Many student groups on
campus do a lot of great advocacy
work and would love for the ASSU
be another leverage point for
them to really push [the] adminis
tration to meet student needs."
In the general question ses
sion, Bennett-Smith and Romea
asked the slates about major cam
pus life topics, as well as issues
specific to student government,
such as engaging more upper
classmen in the ASSU, bridging
the gap between the ASSU and
the administration and dealing
with unspent special fees.
While Gallagher-Ashton and
Gomez-Patino shared similar
views about the importance of im
proving the efficiency and rele
vance of the ASSU, they ex
pressed conflicting beliefs on the
ASSU's role in decisions regard
ing divestment, with the former
slate arguing that the ASSU
should not be involved in divest
ment debates.
"The ASSU should not divide
campus, but bring it together,"
Ashton said. "I think that unless
there is a general consensus, the
ASSU should not touch any issue
of international importance."
Gomez and Patino countered
that the ASSU should facilitate
debate about international con
flicts such as divestment.
"We believe that if students
feel passionately about an issue,

they should be able to come to the
ASSU," Gomez said. "We should
really be discussing issues that go
beyond the bubble of Stanford and
that really do impact us as stu
dents. I don't think a complex is
sue like divestment is beyond the
student body to comprehend and
take a side on."
Following the general question
session, further questions were di
rected at specific slates about
their platforms.
Romea questioned Gomez and
Patino about whether or not their
plan to establish more advisory
boards and institutions to solicit
student feedback would contribute
to the bureaucratic and largely in
efficient nature of the ASSU.
Gomez answered that, if elect
ed, she and Patino plan to imple
ment student advisory committees
specific to Residential and Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) and Resi
dential Education (ResEd).
"Currently there is no student
input into a lot of the decisions
made regarding housing on cam
pus," Gomez said. "Making sure
the student voice is heard on that
level is not something we would
have to add a lot of work to be
cause we already have a Universi
ty committee system."
Bennett-Smith asked Gal
lagher and Ashton whether or not
they believed it was the role of the
Executive to promote structural
change within the ASSU, citing
their proposed amendment to fun
nel unspent special fees money in
to a fund controlled by the Senate
and Executive.
"Absolutely, it's the role of the
ASSU to be part of these amend
ments and referendums and sug
gesting structural reform," Gal
lagher said. "Typically, the ASSU
insiders know the most about the
actual inner workings and struc
ture and what would work and
what wouldn't work."
Following repeated incidents of
unruly behavior from the Chapar
ral slate, Bennett-Smith ques
tioned De Taboada and So about
whether or not their presence at
the debate diminished the reputa
tion of the ASSU by "making a
mockery of the debate and the
election process."
"People have been pretty rude
to us, to be fair," De Taboada said.
"You can say that our positions are
unreasonable that we would give
everyone our salaries, but then
again a $20,000 salary for someone
who doesn't really do anything is
also unreasonable."

enced their experience with stu
dent groups and communities, in
cluding the First-Generation Low
Income Partnership (FLIP), El
Centro Chicano and Movimiento
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA).
"What inspired me to run for
the position of ASSU Executive
has really been my involvement in
different student groups," Gomez
said. "Many student groups on
campus do a lot of great advocacy
work and would love for the ASSU
be another leverage point for
them to really push [the] adminis
tration to meet student needs."
In the general question ses
sion, Bennett-Smith and Romea
asked the slates about major cam
pus life topics, as well as issues
specific to student government,
such as engaging more upper
classmen in the ASSU, bridging
the gap between the ASSU and
the administration and dealing
with unspent special fees.
While Gallagher-Ashton and
Gomez-Patino shared similar
views about the importance of im
proving the efficiency and rele
vance of the ASSU, they ex
pressed conflicting beliefs on the
ASSU's role in decisions regard
ing divestment, with the former
slate arguing that the ASSU
should not be involved in divest
ment debates.
"The ASSU should not divide
campus, but bring it together,"
Ashton said. "I think that unless
there is a general consensus, the
ASSU should not touch any issue
of international importance."
Gomez and Patino countered
that the ASSU should facilitate
debate about international con
flicts such as divestment.
"We believe that if students
feel passionately about an issue,

they should be able to come to the
ASSU," Gomez said. "We should
really be discussing issues that go
beyond the bubble of Stanford and
that really do impact us as stu
dents. I don't think a complex is
sue like divestment is beyond the
student body to comprehend and
take a side on."
Following the general question
session, further questions were di
rected at specific slates about
their platforms.
Romea questioned Gomez and
Patino about whether or not their
plan to establish more advisory
boards and institutions to solicit
student feedback would contribute
to the bureaucratic and largely in
efficient nature of the ASSU.
Gomez answered that, if elect
ed, she and Patino plan to imple
ment student advisory committees
specific to Residential and Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) and Resi
dential Education (ResEd).
"Currently there is no student
input into a lot of the decisions
made regarding housing on cam
pus," Gomez said. "Making sure
the student voice is heard on that
level is not something we would
have to add a lot of work to be
cause we already have a Universi
ty committee system."
Bennett-Smith asked Gal
lagher and Ashton whether or not
they believed it was the role of the
Executive to promote structural
change within the ASSU, citing
their proposed amendment to fun
nel unspent special fees money in
to a fund controlled by the Senate
and Executive.
"Absolutely, it's the role of the
ASSU to be part of these amend
ments and referendums and sug
gesting structural reform," Gal
lagher said. "Typically, the ASSU
insiders know the most about the
actual inner workings and struc
ture and what would work and
what wouldn't work."
Following repeated incidents of
unruly behavior from the Chapar
ral slate, Bennett-Smith ques
tioned De Taboada and So about
whether or not their presence at
the debate diminished the reputa
tion of the ASSU by "making a
mockery of the debate and the
election process."
"People have been pretty rude
to us, to be fair," De Taboada said.
"You can say that our positions are
unreasonable that we would give
everyone our salaries, but then
again a $20,000 salary for someone
who doesn't really do anything is
also unreasonable."

In an engaged and occasionally
bizarre debate on Monday night at
the CoHo, this year's three ASSU
Executive candidate slates dis
cussed and sparred over supporting
mental health initiatives on cam
pus, increasing student feedback in
administrative decisions and im
proving the reputation of the AS
SU.
The debate, held two days be
fore voting opens, was moderated
by Miles Bennett-Smith 'l3, editor
in chief of The Daily, and Judith
Romea 'l4, editor in chief of The
Stanford Review.
The moderators began with a

period of general questioning be
fore directing specific questions at
the three slates: Gallagher-Ashton,
Gomez-Patino and A Pedagogy of
Self Discovery, The Chaparral's
joke slate.
The Chaparral slate, composed
of Ryan De Taboada 'l4 and Antho
ny So 'l4, said little of substance,
instead claiming that they were ro
bots and arguing that the ASSU
should be abolished.
"You know us as the robot candi
dates for student government, but
we're also the party candidates,"
De Taboada joked.
Throughout the debate, Gal
lagher and Ashton emphasized

Los Hermanos and Kappa Sigma.
"I've done a lot of different
things and have a lot of experience
meeting with really cool adminis

deputy chair of the ASSU Under

SU is broken, and we have the ex
perience to make it more rele
