# America's Weighty Dilemma
## 
### Uttara Sivaram 
On March 11, 2013, a judge in
validated New York City's ban
on large sugary drinks, one
day before it was to go into effect.
The lead lawyer for the beverage in
dustry was quoted describing the
regulation as created by "scientists
in the room, working with the mayor,
creating a regulation here that is go
ing to cost people a ton of money."
It is dismal indeed that such a
promising measure was struck down
not on the basis of ineffectiveness or
public harm, but rather, because the
billion-dollar beverage industry
would lose its profits. It becomes
even more depressing when you ac
knowledge that the population of
obese Americans has been gaining
new members at an alarming rate
over the past decade. But as with
most issues nowadays, this problem
has been quantified. People are be
ginning to pay attention to the down
right frightening statistics that have
been uncovered: More than half of
American adults are considered
overweight, with nearly one-quarter
of the adult population 40 million
people clinically defined as obese.
The number of children considered
obese has exceeded 12 million.
Sometimes it's pretty easy to
forget about America's weight is
sue. It's not just about being in
Stanford, where our chiseled ath
letes look as though they've been
finely sculpted from marble and the
rest of us wear expensive (and very
forgiving) athletic clothing to
achieve the same end. Indeed, Cali
fornia, the virtual land of the veg
ans, has spearheaded a powerful
movement towards organic pro
duce, yoga, and nearly inedible
wheatgrass drinks. We've been im
pressively progressive in this sense.
In fact, after spending some time in
Mississippi, where I didn't en
counter one green food item apart
from some fried Brussels sprouts, I
can personally appreciate this
movement.
But as always, Stanford proves
to be an exceptional case. This is not
a case complicated by locale. It's a
problem that has spilled over into
the economic fabric of our society,
ingrained in the capitalistic motiva
tions of the industries that have un
failingly fed our midnight cravings.
In other words, selling and consum
ing unhealthy food has become dan
gerously economical. And while stu
dents here are blessed with healthy
and relatively inexpensive dining
options, even Town & Country Vil
lage offers some less-healthy-than
granola food items that, if con
sumed without caution, can pose a
serious threat to the student body.
We've seen this problem before,
wrapped in a little white cylinder.
The tobacco industry has by no
means been an innocent spectator
on the sidelines of America's declin
ing health and it can be argued
that the food industry's impact on
public health rivals that of the to
bacco companies. But with the help
of Congress, the public was able to
employ a mixture of advertising
sanctions and aggressive taxation to
shrink the size and influence of the
smoking industry to a fraction of its
former self.
America's weight problem also
has a solution but it's important
to note that these kinds of nation
wide failures are neither coinci
dences nor accidents. In the case of
rising obesity, they are the results
of carefully constructed and inter
connected corporate systems with
three main players: the food indus
try, the weight-loss industry, and
the healthcare industry. Thus, even
as very educated Stanford students,
we are not impervious to the very
industries that feed us, strengthen
us and cure us, seemingly with the
best intentions.

The first player, the food indus
try, presents a paradox in and of it
self. The New York Times recently
published an article titled "The Ex
traordinary Science of Addictive
Junk Food." The long feature
chronicles a hush-hush rendezvous
at the Pillsbury headquarters,
where the most powerful men in the
food industry convened a conclave
starring CEOs from Nestle, Kraft,
Nabisco, General Mills, Procter and
Gamble, Coca-Cola and Mars. It
was no longer an option for these
companies to keep ignoring the ris
ing rate of obesity, which had been
publicly attributed to their prod
ucts.
Although bringing together the
men and women who had revolu
tionized the food market seemed to
be a step in the right direction to
wards solving America's weight cri
sis, the meeting turned out to be
relatively fruitless the conse
quence of a frustrating, game theo
retic Prisoner's Dilemma in which
no one company in the food indus
try is willing to cut down on sugar
or far content for fear of losing their
market share. Thus, food isn't get
ting any healthier; in fact, it's get
ting sweeter, saltier and fattier. The
food companies refuse to consider
the possibility that perhaps by co
operating fully with one another,
they can capture an even greater
population of Americans who truly
want to eat healthier, as well as
those who don't know any better.
And as if two players weren't
bad enough, the third presents an
even more disheartening dilemma:
the medical industry. Although it
may be the less obvious profiteer
from increasing obesity rates, the
healthcare system is making enor
mous gains from the increase in
likelihood of cardiovascular disease,
diabetes and cancer. Time magazine
recently published a revealing ex
pose on the counterintuitively large
six and seven-figure salaries that
executives in both for-profit and
non-profit receive. This is deeply
rooted in the fact that hospitals col
lect the vast majority of their prof
its from diagnosing sickness, not
from improving health. In particu
lar, the fee-per-service system
rakes in money from the blood
tests, MRIs, pet scans and other
tests that the growing number of
sick patients undergo. The bottom
line? Hospitals do not gain from a
healthier America any more than the
food and weight-loss industries do.
Stanford has a neat take on these
three industries. We eat at dining
halls, work out in Arrillaga, and go to
Vaden (as sparingly as possible) in a
contained, regulated manner. Stan
ford, in a classically paternalistic
manner, understands that left to our
own devices, we easily fall prey to a
profit-driven market. But as soon as
we get to the very edges of Campus
Drive, we become increasingly vul
nerable to the economic traps that
our food, weight-loss, and medical in
dustries have laid out for us.
This is a problem that our public
policy majors and professors have
and will continue to tackle. In fact,
I'd be hard pressed to think of a so
cial issue that hasn't at least been
partially resolved by the great minds
we have on campus.
But as for the rest of us, this is
something to think about, if not
with our heads, at least with our
stomachs. I'm floored every single
day by how healthy and happy stu
dents are here at Stanford. Thus,
even if it's really just to preserve
our place on College Prowler's col
lege rankings, let's keep ourselves
as healthy and happy as humanly
possible.
