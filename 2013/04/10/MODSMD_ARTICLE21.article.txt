# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## GSC suffers from low turnout, candidate numbers 
### SABELLE SMYTHE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While prospective undergraduate
senators lobby for votes and student
groups flyer for special fees, the Gradu
ate Student Council (GSC) is struggling
to do something much more elemen
tary: finding enough candidates to fill
elected positions and looking to turn
around an institutional history of low in
terest and accomplishment.
The 2011 and 2012 elections repre
sented steep decreases in the number
of graduate students casting votes to
about 10 percent per year as well as
numerous positions with no candidates
running.
According to Elections Commission
er Brianna Pang 'l3, these numbers are
reflective of a divide on campus be
tween undergraduate and graduate
students.
"The key reason is grad life is very

different from undergrad life," Pang
said. "You have so many more obliga
tions beyond life in your dorm and mak
ing college friends."
Graduate students are also literally
farther away from campus life.
"Only about 50 to 60 percent of
grad students live on campus. We miss
out on a huge bunch of people who live
off campus," said GSC Secretary
Roshan Shankar M.S. 'l3, M.EA. 'l4.
"There's international students,
there's couples, there's people who just
got involved with their research
groups ... so they are more mentally
removed."
This distance from campus life
means that the ASSU has historically
focused its efforts to undergraduates.
The GSC's predecessor, the Graduate
Student Association (GSA), was dis
banded in 1993 after voters, mostly un
dergraduates, voted down its request
for special fees.

"A lot of the services the student
government provides are more under
grad-focused," Pang said. "Since I've
been at Stanford almost every single
student that has served as an ASSU
Exec has been an undergrad or a
coterm It's just more undergrads
being involved and wanting to cater to
the undergrads."
The GSC elects 10 district represen
tatives and five at-large representa
tives. Districts correspond to branches
of Stanford's graduate schools, with one
member representing each school and
with two senators representing the
School of Engineering because it ac
counts for almost 40 percent of the
graduate population. At-large repre
sentatives may be from any depart
ment.
This year's election offered signifi
cantly more competition for candidates
over previous years. Twenty-one candi
dates are seeking office, compared to 13

last year. Every district has candidates
running except the Graduate School of
Business. Shankar hopes this competi
tion will also raise the GSC's profile.
"If there's competition, all the candi
dates who are running right now will
try and be aggressive about their cam
paign," Shankar said. "They'll get out
and do more publicity [and] get the
GSC some eyeballs. So hopefully that
should serve two purposes."
Members also hope to increase en
gagement with the GSC through proj
ects that are relevant to graduate life.
Current GSC projects range from tax
workshops for international students to
a redesign of the Graduate Community
Center. The GSC also allots funding for
graduate student groups and hosts
quarterly events, such as Grad Formal
and an annual Thanksgiving Dinner.
