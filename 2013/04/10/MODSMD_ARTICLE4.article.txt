# SLATE PROFILE: ASHTON/GALLAGHER
## Chanelling ASSU experience, student group leadership 
### 
Dan Ashton 'l4 and Billy Gallagher 'l4
have campaigned on the message that their
collective experience in the ASSU and in stu
dent organizations has prepared them to
govern the ASSU.
"The experience is a [requirement] for
the role," Ashton, deputy chair of last year's
ASSU Undergraduate Senate, said. "Our ex
perience is very strong, and shows that we
would be very capable of doing this j0b....
We've seen an amazing breadth of campus.
All of the things we've talked about [reflect
that] we have viscerally felt these things."
"I know how the school should work in
theory and how things work in reality," Gal
lagher, a former Daily editor in chief and
president of Kappa Sigma, added. "Seeing
the magnitude of response [to my editorial
farewell] was awesome, and it gave me a new
wind to do something."
Ashton pointed to his own experience
within student government as allowing the
slate to effectively reform the ASSU and
take advantage of opportunities such as

meeting with student representatives on
University committees neglected by pre
vious ASSU Executives.
"We've seen how that broke down with

the 8:30 a.m. classes," Ash
ton, who is a member of The
Daily's board of directors,
noted. "There are some very
smart changes that can be
made."
While the slate's platform
nods briefly to advocating on
behalf of students in recent
ly contentious issues such
as a University proposal to
terminate Suites Dining's
student management
Gallagher and Ashton em
phasized their intent to leave

a more substantial legacy
through offering a more ro
bust mechanism for students
to make their voices heard
and by making the ASSU
more financially accountable
to students.
"The majority [of stu
dents] would say that they're
not represented well by the
ASSU," Gallagher said.' "It's
about empowering people to
get stuff done."
"The ASSU has been
proactive in the past," Ash
ton added. "It has the means
to be proactive now."
The slate also highlighted
their ability to build off ex
isting relationships with ad
ministrators and reflect the

issues affecting historically
underrepresented groups
such as athletes and mem
bers of the Greek communi
ty— in making the ASSU
more responsive to student
needs.
"I've been very involved
in the communities of color,"
Ashton, a member of Los
Hermanos, noted. "There's
traditionally been a pseudo
divide between [endorsing
and non-endorsing] commu
nities. ... We represent that
bridge. That's something
that the other candidates
can't [do]."
