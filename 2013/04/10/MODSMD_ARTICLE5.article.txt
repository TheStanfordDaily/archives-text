# SLATE PROFILE: GOMEZ/PATINO
## Envisioning the ASSU as a powerful force for advocacy 
### 
In their interview with The Daily, Najla
Gomez 'l4 and Elizabeth Patino 'l4 ex
pressed a similar desire for a more engaged
and influential ASSU Executive.
"It is not enough to do advocacy through
[student groups]," Gomez said. "We would
like to see the ASSU take on a larger role in
this advocacy group ... It will be our job to
ensure the ASSU is seen as a place for peo
ple to come with their ideas or their con
cerns."
The slate emphasized their commitment
to strengthening the ASSU's influence by de
manding greater accountability and per
formance from student representatives on
University committees by creating a new
student advisory board within Residential &
Dining Enterprises and by training student
representatives better.
"We want to make it a consistent system
where students are always engaged and al
ways bringing forward their own agenda
items," Gomez said.
"The thing we've noticed is that some
times administrators care, but they have all
these other things they feel are more impor
tant," Patino added. "Making [student is
sues] jump to the top is a priority."
The two candidates also proposed addi
tional initiatives to address issues like mental
health and sexual assault on campus, boost
funding to community centers and advocate
greater diversity among students and faculty
members.
Gomez and Patino added that a main focus

would be the potential to create a lasting
template for more effective student repre
sentation, and said that they did not think
that their relatively similar backgrounds
would hinder their ability to govern.
"There's no one student who can repre
sent all the communities on campus," Gomez
emphasized, noting the slate's collection of
several endorsements including those of
the Stanford Student Freedom Project and
the Students of Color Coalition —to date.
"[Those endorsing groups] have a lot of agen-

da items they plan to help us
with.... Ideally, we'll have
an agenda from everyone,
but we'll have something to
start off with."

"We'd pass that knowl
edge [of ASSU due process]
on so the next ASSU Execu
tive can know what they're
taking on," she added. "It's a
continuous process."
Gomez and Patino also
noted that they envisioned
distinct roles within the Exec
utive if elected, compared to
Ashton and Gallagher's con

cept of two "co-presidents."
"The president is here to
say, 'these are the issues we
really care about," Patino
said. "The vice president is
[there] to follow through....
We're holding each other ac
countable."
