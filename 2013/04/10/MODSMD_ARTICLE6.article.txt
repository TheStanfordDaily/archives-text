## Study finds elite schools inaccessible 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Elite universities' increasing selectiv
ity and rising tuition prices aren't the on
ly issues facing today's high school sen
iors. According to research conducted by
Professor of Economics Caroline Hoxby,
limited accessibility to those schools for
poor, minority or first-generation stu
dents can pose an even larger obstacle.
According to Hoxby's research, about
70 percent of low-income students at
elite colleges come from 15 metropolitan
areas with notably high-quality public
schools. Beyond those areas, many poor
and minority students are largely pre
vented from accessing elite universities.
In an email to The Daily, however,
Hoxby emphasized that Stanford is no
tably more accessible than its peer insti
tutions.
"Broadly speaking, Stanford is more
racially [and] ethnically di
verse than any of its competi
tors, in particular," she wrote.
According to data from
the Integrated Postsecondary
Education Data System
(IPEDS), Stanford is more di
verse in its undergraduate
student body than several
peer institutions, including
Harvard, Yale, Princeton and
the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.
According to Dean of Un
dergraduate Admission and
Financial Aid Richard Shaw,
Stanford is also prominent in
its inclusion of first-genera
tion college students.
"Stanford always takes in
a graduating class where
around 15 percent of the in
coming place is composed of
first-generation college stu
dents," he said.
Shaw took issue with the
thrust of an article in Time
magazine highlighting Hox
by's research though he
has yet to read the article it
self— and pointed to Stan
ford's admissions policies,
which assess students' per
formance relative to their op
portunities.
"We acknowledge that stu
dents apply to Stanford with
different opportunities and
exposure. That is why we pay
so much attention to the
schools and environments ap
plicants are coming from," he

said. "Admissions definitely
does not disregard any appli
cations without a thorough
contextual review. We factor
in school profiles, and the
kinds of opportunities that
students have had in our deci
sion."
Hoxby said that lower-in
come and minority students
are not at an academic disad
vantage when it comes to ad
missions.
'At the time of admissions,
they tend to be admitted at
the same or higher rates than
non-underrepresented mi
norities and more affluent stu
dents who have the same
SAT/ACT scores and high
school grades", she said.
She added that although
lower-income and underrep
resented minority students
are still not as likely to attend
elite institutions as students
from other backgrounds,
"elite universities are ... try
ing extremely hard to make
themselves accessible."
"Stanford and its competi
tors all work very hard at re
cruiting students from disad
vantaged backgrounds,"
Hoxby said. "They visit
schools; they offer campus
visits; they work with numer
ous college mentoring organ
izations; they support sum
mer programs."
Hoxby said that, ultimate
ly, the best way to counter the
issue of inaccessibility is to lev
el the field at the high school
level, though she noted the dif
ficulty of that task.
"You are essentially asking
what can be done about the

mediocre level of achievement
among many American stu
dents," she said. "While there
are many things that can be
done to improve American ed
ucation, none of them is a sim
ple silver bullet."
