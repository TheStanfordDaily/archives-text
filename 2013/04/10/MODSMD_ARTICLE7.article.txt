# THIS SWIMMER'S LIFE
## 
### RENEE DONOVAN DESK EDITOR 
This is the fifth part, of six-part feature
series on Stanford women's sports. This
piece seeks mainly to give a first-person
account of junior swimmer Andie Tay
lor's life outside of the pool, Renee and
Andie were roommates freshman year.
When Andie opens the door of her
suite, I can tell she is excited about
something. She welcomes me in,
offers me Easter candy, then
blurts out the question she has been waiting to
ask: "Are you mends with Julia Landauer?"
Julia is a good friend of mine, a racecar
driver who recently competed on CBS's "Sur

vivor." I tell Andie that we are friends and she
shrieks with excitement, bounding up to re
trieve a copy of The Daily that she has cached
away in her room. She looks at me mischie
vously and points to the following quote in a
recent article on Landauer: "There was some
one who was on the ladies' swim team who
came up to me in Ricker Dining Hall and
asked for a picture. And she totally made my
night."
"See," Andie says, "I'm famous."
It turns out she was that someone on the
ladies' swim team.
Andie Taylor's enthusiasm isn't limited to
"Survivor." She loves chocolate milk, obscure
candies and decorating the common room of


WOMEN'S SPORTS FEATURE SERIES
her suite with live houseplants. In
fact, when she's done swimming at
Stanford, she plans to go on an all
candy diet for as long as she can
and supplement it with vitamins so
she survives.
The sound of leaf blowers re
minds her of the suburban summers
of her childhood. She loves the "To
day" show and sneaks into her eat
ing club at Suites to watch it some
mornings. When she grows up, she
wants to have an even number of
kids so no one gets left out for pick
up basketball or Disneyland rides.
Andie and I were freshman
roommates in Donner and have
stayed close since. She is a junior
majoring in Humßio with a concen
tration on disease causation and
children's health. She generally
swims middle distance freestyle,
the individual medley and butterfly.
She hails from Sammamish, Wash.,
a suburb outside of Seattle.
Andie first tried out swimming
at age nine, and began swimming
year-round when she was 11. She
played many sports growing up
with an older brother, and says that
she stayed on her little league base
ball team long after all the other
girls had switched to softball. She
played basketball until high school,
when she had to choose between
basketball and swimming, a fact
few people know about her.
Asked about her early swim
ming memories, she says, "Erin
McClean. I will always remember
that name."
McClean beat 9-year-old Andie
in her first-ever summer champi
onship meet due to a disqualifica
tion. She also reminisces fondly
about a junior national team trip to
Maui in 2007, when she met and
roomed with her current teammate
Felicia Lee. The two lived together
in Mirrielees last year and remain
best friends.
When I ask her what challenges
she faces with swimming, she re
sponds, "Getting up early, the
amount practice interferes with
classes you want to take, but it's
mostly staying focused for that
long."
Meeting Andie, you would never
guess that she is walking around
perpetually exhausted, even with a
practice schedule of nine practices
per week plus dryland and
weightlifting outside of that. The
girl exudes energy. I remember be
ing so impressed our freshman year
that she could be cheery and curi

ous about my day when she re
turned at night after a long day
bookended by 6 a.m. practice and 8
p.m. chemistry tutoring.
When I ask her what her fa
vorite part of swimming is, she
doesn't skip a beat, "The communi
ty. We spend so much time together
and those are the people who go
through the same things as you."
It's clear in the tone of her voice
how much she loves her teammates.
This love propelled the team to a
Pac-12 title this February under
new head coach Greg Meehan.
She comments that coming to
college was "pretty weird because it
was the first time men's and
women's teams were completely
separate." Their separate training
schedules have done little to sepa
rate the teams socially however,
and on any given day at any meal,
you will find both teams eating to
gether at the picnic tables outside
of Suites. When I ask her if she ever
notices her gender in athletics, or
thinks about what it means to be a
female athlete, she looks back con
fused and then responds, "Nope?"
Regarding her favorite part of
Stanford, Andie says, "Besides the
weather and beautiful campus, I
would say the interesting people
that you run into and all the stories
you hear about what people have
done. It kind of inspires you to do
something that cool too." This
makes me chuckle because Andie is
high up on my list of "interesting
people" yet she seems to consider
herself quite average.
Besides swimming competitive
ly at a top-ranked school, Andie has
plans for medical school at some
point in the future. For the number

of commitments tugging at her at
tention, Andie is remarkably calm
and collected. I ask her what stress
es her out most, and surprisingly
she doesn't respond with com
plaints about time management or
med school but says instead,
"Sometimes I think about all the
things going on at Stanford that I
don't even know about, let alone at
tend, like plays and talks and stuff
that stresses me out."
One of the first nights of our
freshman year Andie woke me just
as I was drifting off. "Renee!" she
exclaimed. "Let's play rose, bud,
thorn." She seemed to assume that
everyone knew what this game was,
and maybe they do, but I didn't.
She explained.
Prom that night on, we played
most nights, telling each other one
good thing that had happened to us
that day (rose), one bad thing
(thorn), and one thing we were
looking forward to (bud). The kind
of optimism this game exhibits is
characteristic of Andie. She works
herself hard and has no less than
three balls in the air at any given
time, but she is always hopeful for
what she has slated for tomorrow.
She strikes a balance between
tough-as-nails ambition and child
like wonder. She is notably modest,
and if there seems to be a dearth of
stats in this article it is because
Andie doesn't like tooting her own
horn. She is one of the few people I
know who challenges herself to be a
better person every day, whether
by going to church, doing a kind
deed or just changing her attitude.
It's a joy to share her excite
ment about "Survivor" or Ann Cur
ry, and if you spend enough time
with her you begin to make plans
for future candy diets as well. When
I get up to leave, I hug Andie good
bye, take some Easter candy for
the road and promise to plan a play
date for her with Julia.

and supplement it with vitamins so
she survives.
The sound of leaf blowers re
minds her of the suburban summers
of her childhood. She loves the "To
day" show and sneaks into her eat
ing club at Suites to watch it some
mornings. When she grows up, she
wants to have an even number of
kids so no one gets left out for pick
up basketball or Disneyland rides.
Andie and I were freshman
roommates in Donner and have
stayed close since. She is a junior
majoring in Humßio with a concen
tration on disease causation and
children's health. She generally
swims middle distance freestyle,
the individual medley and butterfly.
She hails from Sammamish, Wash.,
a suburb outside of Seattle.
Andie first tried out swimming
at age nine, and began swimming
year-round when she was 11. She
played many sports growing up
with an older brother, and says that
she stayed on her little league base
ball team long after all the other
girls had switched to softball. She
played basketball until high school,
when she had to choose between
basketball and swimming, a fact
few people know about her.
Asked about her early swim
ming memories, she says, "Erin
McClean. I will always remember
that name."
McClean beat 9-year-old Andie
in her first-ever summer champi
onship meet due to a disqualifica
tion. She also reminisces fondly
about a junior national team trip to
Maui in 2007, when she met and
roomed with her current teammate
Felicia Lee. The two lived together
in Mirrielees last year and remain
best friends.
When I ask her what challenges
she faces with swimming, she re
sponds, "Getting up early, the
amount practice interferes with
classes you want to take, but it's
mostly staying focused for that
long."
Meeting Andie, you would never
guess that she is walking around
perpetually exhausted, even with a
practice schedule of nine practices
per week plus dryland and
weightlifting outside of that. The
girl exudes energy. I remember be
ing so impressed our freshman year
that she could be cheery and curi

ous about my day when she re
turned at night after a long day
bookended by 6 a.m. practice and 8
p.m. chemistry tutoring.
When I ask her what her fa
vorite part of swimming is, she
doesn't skip a beat, "The communi
ty. We spend so much time together
and those are the people who go
through the same things as you."
It's clear in the tone of her voice
how much she loves her teammates.
This love propelled the team to a
Pac-12 title this February under
new head coach Greg Meehan.
She comments that coming to
college was "pretty weird because it
was the first time men's and
women's teams were completely
separate." Their separate training
schedules have done little to sepa
rate the teams socially however,
and on any given day at any meal,
you will find both teams eating to
gether at the picnic tables outside
of Suites. When I ask her if she ever
notices her gender in athletics, or
thinks about what it means to be a
female athlete, she looks back con
fused and then responds, "Nope?"
Regarding her favorite part of
Stanford, Andie says, "Besides the
weather and beautiful campus, I
would say the interesting people
that you run into and all the stories
you hear about what people have
done. It kind of inspires you to do
something that cool too." This
makes me chuckle because Andie is
high up on my list of "interesting
people" yet she seems to consider
herself quite average.
Besides swimming competitive
ly at a top-ranked school, Andie has
plans for medical school at some
point in the future. For the number

of commitments tugging at her at
tention, Andie is remarkably calm
and collected. I ask her what stress
es her out most, and surprisingly
she doesn't respond with com
plaints about time management or
med school but says instead,
"Sometimes I think about all the
things going on at Stanford that I
don't even know about, let alone at
tend, like plays and talks and stuff
that stresses me out."
One of the first nights of our
freshman year Andie woke me just
as I was drifting off. "Renee!" she
exclaimed. "Let's play rose, bud,
thorn." She seemed to assume that
everyone knew what this game was,
and maybe they do, but I didn't.
She explained.
Prom that night on, we played
most nights, telling each other one
good thing that had happened to us
that day (rose), one bad thing
(thorn), and one thing we were
looking forward to (bud). The kind
of optimism this game exhibits is
characteristic of Andie. She works
herself hard and has no less than
three balls in the air at any given
time, but she is always hopeful for
what she has slated for tomorrow.
She strikes a balance between
tough-as-nails ambition and child
like wonder. She is notably modest,
and if there seems to be a dearth of
stats in this article it is because
Andie doesn't like tooting her own
horn. She is one of the few people I
know who challenges herself to be a
better person every day, whether
by going to church, doing a kind
deed or just changing her attitude.
It's a joy to share her excite
ment about "Survivor" or Ann Cur
ry, and if you spend enough time
with her you begin to make plans
for future candy diets as well. When
I get up to leave, I hug Andie good
bye, take some Easter candy for
the road and promise to plan a play
date for her with Julia.

Junior swimmer Andie Taylor
(above) says her favorite part of
Stanford is "the interesting people
you run into" and her favorite part
of swimming is the "community."
This is the fifth part, of six-part feature
series on Stanford women's sports. This
piece seeks mainly to give a first-person
account of junior swimmer Andie Tay
lor's life outside of the pool, Renee and
Andie were roommates freshman year.
When Andie opens the door of her
suite, I can tell she is excited about
something. She welcomes me in,
offers me Easter candy, then
blurts out the question she has been waiting to
ask: "Are you mends with Julia Landauer?"
Julia is a good friend of mine, a racecar
driver who recently competed on CBS's "Sur

vivor." I tell Andie that we are friends and she
shrieks with excitement, bounding up to re
trieve a copy of The Daily that she has cached
away in her room. She looks at me mischie
vously and points to the following quote in a
recent article on Landauer: "There was some
one who was on the ladies' swim team who
came up to me in Ricker Dining Hall and
asked for a picture. And she totally made my
night."
"See," Andie says, "I'm famous."
It turns out she was that someone on the
ladies' swim team.
Andie Taylor's enthusiasm isn't limited to
"Survivor." She loves chocolate milk, obscure
candies and decorating the common room of

fact, when she's done swimming at
