## Senators talk SOCC endorsement 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
With ASSU elections set to take
place at the end of this week, many
campus groups have already issued en
dorsements for candidates who best
share their values. In recent years, no
such group has been as influential or
successful as the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC).
The last four Executive slates en
dorsed by SOCC were victorious, while
all 12 senators supported by SOCC last
year were elected. In 2011, 12 of 15
SOCC-endorsed Senate candidates at
tained ASSU office.
The Daily sat down with current
and prospective senators to discuss the

significance of a SOCC endorsement
on their campaigns and on the ASSU
as a whole.

Game-changing electoral impact
SOCC is a coalition of six
student organizations: the
Asian American Students'
Association (AASA), the
Black Student Union (BSU),
Movimiento Estudiantil Chi
cano de Aztlan (MEChA),
the Muslim Student Aware
ness Network (MSAN), the
National Association for the
Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) and the
Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO).
This year, SOCC has en
dorsed Najla Gomez 'l4 and
Elizabeth Patino 'l4 for Ex
ecutive, and Abby Dow 'l6,
Angela Zhang 'l6, Annalis
Breed 'l6, Avery Haskell 'l6,
Brandon Caruso 'l6, Eilaf
Osman 'l6, Hisham Al-Falih
'l6, John-Lancaster Finley
'l6, Natasha Patel 'l6, Ryan
Matsumoto 'l6 and Zane
Hellmann 'l6 for Senate.
Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5
sought a SOCC endorse
ment, unsuccessfully, last
year. While Bindra was ulti
mately elected, he described
a SOCC endorsement as an
invaluable asset for prospec
tive student government
representatives due to SOC-
C's extensive and motivated
student network and vast
campaign experience.
"It's not absolutely neces
sary, but it would take a
much stronger ground cam
paign and pursuit of other
endorsements to get the
same result," Bindra noted.
"A SOCC candidate has a
good few hundred [people in]
backing," noted a current
SOCC-endorsed senator.
"The numbers can't really
he."
Bindra asserted that the
popular recognition of SOC-
C's electoral value might
lead to a diminished candi
date pool, with prospective
representatives dropping

out or being electorally mar
ginalized without a SOCC
endorsement.
"It's ridiculous that
someone could win against
someone else more qualified
simply because of the SOCC
vote," Bindra said. "There's
a lot of potential for that to
happen."
"SOCC really weeded
down the pool [last year],"
the SOCC-endorsed senator
recalled. "The toughest part
was getting the SOCC en
dorsement."
That senator noted that
obtaining a SOCC endorse
ment may be as much a re
flection of prior involvement
with the coalition's con
stituent groups similar to
many other endorsing bodies
as senatorial qualities or a
superior platform.
"What SOCC is supposed
to do is not only gauge them
as just in [SOCC's] interests,
but also if they're going to be
a great senator," the senator
said. "As a whole, you have a
better shot getting it if you
have been involved with one
of the SOCC groups."
Senator Lauren Miller 'l5
emphasized the value of the
endorsement system as a
whole, noting that endorse
ments offer students the
chance to become more polit
ically active and influential in
student government.
"It makes a lot of stu
dents more politically active
than they otherwise would
be," she said. "There are def
initely flaws —when people
just vote down the emailed
lists."
Miller emphasized that
the onus is on other student
groups to exert similar influ
ence on the ASSU through
mobilizing their own mem
bers.
"There's definitely more
groups that could be more
active," she noted.
"Endorsements are a re
ally positive way of candi
dates being able to tell peo
ple what they stand for in a

few words," Bindra added.
"The main issue is the lack of
balance and the lack of diver
sity in the process."
The SOCC-endorsed sen
ator described SOCC's influ
ence as a natural step for the
group, given the coalition's
constituent communities' in
ability to effectively mobilize
against severe cuts to com
munity center funding in
2008.
"SOCC doesn't want his
tory to repeat itself," the sen
ator observed. "That was a
really difficult time."
Caruso said that he
sought the SOCC endorse
ment because of similar val
ues.
"It just really helped that
I understood their issues, un
derstood their history and
understood what they are
currently dealing with,"
Caruso said. "I think they
saw the candidates they did
give the endorsement to ...
would work for the SOCC is
sues because those SOCC is
sues were genuinely impor
tant to those candidates."

Diminished influence on
ASSU agenda
As this year's senators
approach the end of their
term, they noted that SOC-
C's influence on the Senate's
agenda may be diminished
compared to previous years.
"Just based on my initial

experience with endorsing
organizations, I would have
thought they would have a
much more obvious pres
ence in Senate," Bindra
commented.
As the Senate grappled
with and eventually rejected
a contentious measure on di
vestment, an email from for
mer ASSU Executive
Michael Cruz 'l2 to the Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER) mailing list
claimed that the decision
showed that "SOCC has lost
its radical core."
Miller disputed the con
cept that SOCC endorse
ments influenced senators
one way or the other on such
issues.
"Senators stayed true to
their own personal beliefs
and opinions," she recalled,
a perspective echoed by the
SOCC-endorsed senator.
"They weighed the consider
ations very seriously, and ul
timately had to make a per
sonal decision."
"Most of the substantial
issues we've done haven't
been a result of endorse
ments," Bindra confirmed.
Bindra pointed to the se
lection of Senate leadership
as one area where SOCC's
influence may have been
felt.
"It can definitely create a
majority that is unfavorable
to [the non-SOCC-endorsed

minority]," the SOCC-en
dorsed senator conceded,
pointing to the frequency
with which SOCC-endorsed
candidates campaign to
gether before taking office.
While SOCC-endorsed
candidates sign a document
pledging to maintain values
put forward in their SOCC
interview, Miller said that
the commitment once in of
fice is entirely determined
by the individual senator.
"Endorsements can be
really effective if you work
with them throughout the
year," she said. "[SOCC] got
me to know a lot of the peo
ple we'd be serving with be
fore we started. I went in
with strong bonds with peo
ple ... which was great."
She also pointed to SOC-
C's value in tempering the
ambitions of prospective
senators and guiding them
towards potentially more
fruitful legislative areas.
"You just don't know the
full realities of the ASSU un
til you get in there," Miller
conceded. "We had a lot of
broad sweeping agendas,
which were really idealistic
and great, but once we got in
to Senate, reality sunk in."

With ASSU elections set to take
place at the end of this week, many
campus groups have already issued en
dorsements for candidates who best
share their values. In recent years, no
such group has been as influential or
successful as the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC).
The last four Executive slates en
dorsed by SOCC were victorious, while
all 12 senators supported by SOCC last
year were elected. In 2011, 12 of 15
SOCC-endorsed Senate candidates at
tained ASSU office.
The Daily sat down with current
and prospective senators to discuss the

significance of a SOCC endorsement
on their campaigns and on the ASSU
as a whole.

Game-changing electoral impact
SOCC is a coalition of six
student organizations: the
Asian American Students'
Association (AASA), the
Black Student Union (BSU),
Movimiento Estudiantil Chi
cano de Aztlan (MEChA),
the Muslim Student Aware
ness Network (MSAN), the
National Association for the
Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) and the
Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO).
This year, SOCC has en
dorsed Najla Gomez 'l4 and
Elizabeth Patino 'l4 for Ex
ecutive, and Abby Dow 'l6,
Angela Zhang 'l6, Annalis
Breed 'l6, Avery Haskell 'l6,
Brandon Caruso 'l6, Eilaf
Osman 'l6, Hisham Al-Falih
'l6, John-Lancaster Finley
'l6, Natasha Patel 'l6, Ryan
Matsumoto 'l6 and Zane
Hellmann 'l6 for Senate.
Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5
sought a SOCC endorse
ment, unsuccessfully, last
year. While Bindra was ulti
mately elected, he described
a SOCC endorsement as an
invaluable asset for prospec
tive student government
representatives due to SOC-
C's extensive and motivated
student network and vast
campaign experience.
"It's not absolutely neces
sary, but it would take a
much stronger ground cam
paign and pursuit of other
endorsements to get the
same result," Bindra noted.
"A SOCC candidate has a
good few hundred [people in]
backing," noted a current
SOCC-endorsed senator.
"The numbers can't really
he."
Bindra asserted that the
popular recognition of SOC-
C's electoral value might
lead to a diminished candi
date pool, with prospective
representatives dropping

out or being electorally mar
ginalized without a SOCC
endorsement.
"It's ridiculous that
someone could win against
someone else more qualified
simply because of the SOCC
vote," Bindra said. "There's
a lot of potential for that to
happen."
"SOCC really weeded
down the pool [last year],"
the SOCC-endorsed senator
recalled. "The toughest part
was getting the SOCC en
dorsement."
That senator noted that
obtaining a SOCC endorse
ment may be as much a re
flection of prior involvement
with the coalition's con
stituent groups similar to
many other endorsing bodies
as senatorial qualities or a
superior platform.
"What SOCC is supposed
to do is not only gauge them
as just in [SOCC's] interests,
but also if they're going to be
a great senator," the senator
said. "As a whole, you have a
better shot getting it if you
have been involved with one
of the SOCC groups."
Senator Lauren Miller 'l5
emphasized the value of the
endorsement system as a
whole, noting that endorse
ments offer students the
chance to become more polit
ically active and influential in
student government.
"It makes a lot of stu
dents more politically active
than they otherwise would
be," she said. "There are def
initely flaws —when people
just vote down the emailed
lists."
Miller emphasized that
the onus is on other student
groups to exert similar influ
ence on the ASSU through
mobilizing their own mem
bers.
"There's definitely more
groups that could be more
active," she noted.
"Endorsements are a re
ally positive way of candi
dates being able to tell peo
ple what they stand for in a

few words," Bindra added.
"The main issue is the lack of
balance and the lack of diver
sity in the process."
The SOCC-endorsed sen
ator described SOCC's influ
ence as a natural step for the
group, given the coalition's
constituent communities' in
ability to effectively mobilize
against severe cuts to com
munity center funding in
2008.
"SOCC doesn't want his
tory to repeat itself," the sen
ator observed. "That was a
really difficult time."
Caruso said that he
sought the SOCC endorse
ment because of similar val
ues.
"It just really helped that
I understood their issues, un
derstood their history and
understood what they are
currently dealing with,"
Caruso said. "I think they
saw the candidates they did
give the endorsement to ...
would work for the SOCC is
sues because those SOCC is
sues were genuinely impor
tant to those candidates."

Diminished influence on
ASSU agenda
As this year's senators
approach the end of their
term, they noted that SOC-
C's influence on the Senate's
agenda may be diminished
compared to previous years.
"Just based on my initial

experience with endorsing
organizations, I would have
thought they would have a
much more obvious pres
ence in Senate," Bindra
commented.
As the Senate grappled
with and eventually rejected
a contentious measure on di
vestment, an email from for
mer ASSU Executive
Michael Cruz 'l2 to the Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER) mailing list
claimed that the decision
showed that "SOCC has lost
its radical core."
Miller disputed the con
cept that SOCC endorse
ments influenced senators
one way or the other on such
issues.
"Senators stayed true to
their own personal beliefs
and opinions," she recalled,
a perspective echoed by the
SOCC-endorsed senator.
"They weighed the consider
ations very seriously, and ul
timately had to make a per
sonal decision."
"Most of the substantial
issues we've done haven't
been a result of endorse
ments," Bindra confirmed.
Bindra pointed to the se
lection of Senate leadership
as one area where SOCC's
influence may have been
felt.
"It can definitely create a
majority that is unfavorable
to [the non-SOCC-endorsed

minority]," the SOCC-en
dorsed senator conceded,
pointing to the frequency
with which SOCC-endorsed
candidates campaign to
gether before taking office.
While SOCC-endorsed
candidates sign a document
pledging to maintain values
put forward in their SOCC
interview, Miller said that
the commitment once in of
fice is entirely determined
by the individual senator.
"Endorsements can be
really effective if you work
with them throughout the
year," she said. "[SOCC] got
me to know a lot of the peo
ple we'd be serving with be
fore we started. I went in
with strong bonds with peo
ple ... which was great."
She also pointed to SOC-
C's value in tempering the
ambitions of prospective
senators and guiding them
towards potentially more
fruitful legislative areas.
"You just don't know the
full realities of the ASSU un
til you get in there," Miller
conceded. "We had a lot of
broad sweeping agendas,
which were really idealistic
and great, but once we got in
to Senate, reality sunk in."
