## Senators talk SOCC endorsement 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
With ASSU elections set to take
place at the end of this week, many
campus groups have already issued en
dorsements for candidates who best
share their values. In recent years, no
such group has been as influential or
successful as the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC).
The last four Executive slates en
dorsed by SOCC were victorious, while
all 12 senators supported by SOCC last
year were elected. In 2011, 12 of 15
SOCC-endorsed Senate candidates at
tained ASSU office.
The Daily sat down with current
and prospective senators to discuss the

significance of a SOCC endorsement
on their campaigns and on the ASSU
as a whole.

Game-changing electoral impact
