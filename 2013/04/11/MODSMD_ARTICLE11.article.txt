# Taking Tiger back for the Masters

I was never much of a golf fan
growing up, but whenever the
Masters rolled around, I always
knew to keep an eye out for Tiger
Woods. Even though Tiger had
turned pro after only two years at Stan
ford, that was enough of a connection to
the best golfer in the world to ensure
my undying bandwagon fandom.
In 2009, Tiger had just embarked
on his career as the worst honorary
captain in Stanford football history tri
umphantly claiming "the second half is
ours" over the PA system during half
time of the 2009 Big Game before a sec
ond-half collapse cost the Cardinal the
Axe. (His captainship didn't do much
good at the 2012 Fiesta Bowl either).
But in the month after that little slip-up,
Tiger's more serious transgressions
came to the sporting world's attention
when he admitted to extramarital af
fairs with several women.

Suddenly it was really hard to root
for that guy that I didn't have all that
much reason to like in the first place.
My Tiger fandom wasn't die-hard—it
was by default —and besides, the best
player in the history of golf was starting
to suck at it.
But being an elite athlete, Tiger's
resilience kicked in. Over three years
he has battled back to his earlier domi
nance, and he has once again ascended
to No. 1 in the world just in time for the
Masters, which began today
Which leaves me to wonder: Should
I root for Tiger this week?
In away, Tiger is the opposite of
Lance Armstrong, the cancer survivor
and Livestrong founder whose seven
Tour de Prance titles were cast into
doubt by his recent admissions of dop
ing. Lance did great things in real life
but cheated on the racetrack; Tiger did
great things on the golf course but, well,
cheated in real life.
That makes it a whole lot harder to
root against Woods, because his per
sonal issues don't really change what he
has accomplished as a golfer. Tiger has
won three career grand slams, been
named PGA Player of the Tear 10 times
and is knocking on the door of Sam
Snead's PGA record of 82 tournament
wins with 77 of his own.
And Tiger is by no means the only
athlete with off-the-field issues. Before
he came to the San Jose Sharks in 2009,
Dany Heatley once pleaded guilty to
vehicular homicide after a 2003 speed
ing accident that resulted in the death
of a teammate. Just last season, Giants
slugger and eventual World Series
MVI? Pablo Sandoval, was investigated
(but not charged) for an alleged sexual
assault.
It's pretty hard to find an athlete
nowadays without some sort of person
al controversy that has gone public. If
it's not Denis Rodman flirting with the
Axis of Evil, it's Oscar Pistorius being
charged with the murder of his super
model girlfriend.
The only two people you can have
unequivocal faith in are Andrew Luck
and the Pope —and I'm not so sure
about one of those.
So Tiger, you're getting a bit of a
free pass in my book. It's not because I
think what you did was okay but it's be
cause there are so many other athletes
out there with muddy personal lives
that it's really hard to find many of
them I can absolutely trust as people.
It's not for me to forgive your wrongdo
ings, since they never affected me, but I
guess you could say I've been inundat
ed with so many other sports scandals
that I've begun to forget yours.
I've forgotten the cheating, the ugly
breakup with your caddy, the on-course
temper. So go out and win at Augusta
this weekend, maybe with some of the
pizzaz that earned you your fifth and fi
nal green jacket in 2005.1 really want to
see you win five more majors and break
Jack Nicklaus' record of 18.
And do it while I'm still on your side,
please—because if you screw up next
time David Shaw asks you to serve as
honorary captain, I just might not want
you back.
