# TOP SPOT IN SIGHT

### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford women's wa
ter polo team will be looking to take
back the top ranking in both its con
ference and the nation when it
matches up with No. IUSC this Sat
urday in Los Angeles.
The Trojans (20-0, 4-0 MPSF)
handed the Cardinal (23-1, 4-0
MPSF) its only defeat of the season
when the teams met on Feb. 24 in the
finals of the UC-Irvine Invitational.
In a back-and-forth affair, USC ulti
mately pulled out a 13-10 win.
"They were just better prepared
than we were," said Stanford head
coach John Tanner after the first
matchup. "They did a lot of things
that we didn't respond well to."
Since that loss, the Cardinal has
won 11 straight games by a margin
of at least seven goals. Last week
end, Stanford shut down No. 4
UCLA to win 8-1 on the Card's Sen
ior Day.
With that win, the Cardinal se
cured a place in the top two slots of
the bracket in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) tourna
ment, which will be held from April
26-28 in Berkeley, Calif. Whichever
team can come away victorious this
weekend will take the No. 1 seed,
while the loser will slip to second.
In the February competition,
USC junior Hannah Buckling,
freshman Anni Espar and sopho
more Monica Yavic all victimized
the Cardinal for three goals each.
Vavic currently leads the MPSF
with 59 goals this season while junior
Kaleigh Gilchrist (31 goals) is also
among the top 20 scorers in the
league.
As a team, USC is averaging a
league-high 15.8 goals per game, one

spot above Stanford, which sits at
second with an average of 14 goals
scored per game.
For the defensive stats, the two
teams are flipped. The Cardinal
leads the conference with a mere
4.29 goals allowed per game, while
USC is right behind with a 4.95
mark.
While Stanford's team defense
has consistently overwhelmed oppo
nents, its goalkeepers have also been
solid when counted upon. Starting
goalkeeper senior Kate Baldoni, who
was named MPSF Player of the
Week after an outstanding seven

save effort against UCLA, is second
in the league with a 4.28 goals
against average. The only player
ahead of her is Stanford freshman
Gabby Stone, who has allowed 4.22
goals per game in 31.25 quarters
played.
USC goalkeeper Flora Bolonyai
has been equally strong in giving up
just 4.83 goals per game while man
ning the net the majority of the time
for the Women of Troy. In the teams'
first meeting, Bolonyai made a cru
cial save on a five-meter penalty shot
to maintain a slim 11-10 lead for
USC.

Stanford's attack will need to be
firing on all cylinders for the Cardi
nal to hand the Women of Troy their
first loss of the season. Stanford
senior Melissa Seidemann is cur
rently fourth in the MPSF with 55
goals this season, while the nine
through 11 spots are also filled by
Stanford's Maggie Steffens (45
goals), Anna Yelizarova (42 goals)
and Kiley Neushul (41 goals), re
spectively.
After the big matchup against
USC on Saturday, Stanford will stay
in Los Angeles to face No. 11 Loyola
Marymount (17-9) on Sunday in an
other rematch of an early season
game. On Jan. 27, the Cardinal de
feated the Lions 14-8 at the UC-San
ta Barbara tournament.
LMU has won eight of its last 10
games, with the only losses coming
against USC and No. 5 Cal. The Li
ons' top scorers are junior Alexandra
Honny (41 goals) and senior Jessica
Morelos (38 goals), but five Lions
have scored at least 25 goals this sea
son. When the teams first met, Hon
ny did not score and Morelos tallied
just once.
In goal, both freshman Claire
Wright and sophomore Jordan
White have performed well for
LMU. In the teams' first matchup,
White made six saves in the game to
help hold the Cardinal to just a 6-4
lead at halftime.
In the second half of that game,
Stanford exploded for six goals in the
third period and tacked on two more
in the fourth quarter to take the 14-8
victory.
Saturday's game against USC
will begin at 4 p.m. and Sunday's
competition starts at noon.
