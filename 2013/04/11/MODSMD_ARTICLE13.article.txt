The No. 9 Stanford men's golf
team will finish off its regular sea
son tournament play this weekend
at the Pasatiempo Golf Club in
Santa Cruz, looking to extend its
hot streak into the postseason.
The Western Intercollegiate
will be held over two days rather
than the regular three. This will
force the golfers to play 36 holes
on Saturday and a standard 18 on
Sunday.
This is the third time the Car
dinal will play an abbreviated
tournament this season; in two
previous outings, the team fin
ished eighth and fourth. Addition
ally, the Western is a six-man tour
nament, counting five scores (in
stead of four) every day.
"We're excited about the West
ern," said head coach Conrad Ray.
"It's a great event, it's close to
home and a really good test of golf.
Pasatiempo is one of the classic de
signs on the West Coast with some
undulating greens and tight fair
ways. It's usually in wonderful

condition, and we're looking for
ward to getting over there this
weekend."
Stanford's Patrick Rodgers is
the defending champion in this
event and is seeking to propel the
Cardinal to its second straight
team win. The sophomore, sitting
at No. 6 in Golf Week's NCAA indi
vidual rankings, is also fresh off a
win at the SH Collegiate Masters
in Las Vegas and a runner-up fin
ish at his home tournament. For
those performances, he was
named the Southern Golf Associa
tion's National Amateur of the
Month for March.
"It is a great honor," Rodgers
said of the award. "Any time you
are recognized for performing
well it is a good thing. I have
worked hard this spring and have
played well this month so it is a
nice award with so many great
players around the country."

team's spotlight as of late, junior
