# Yun takes final swings on the road

### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford men's golf
team will finish off its regular sea
son tournament play this weekend
at the Pasatiempo Golf Club in
Santa Cruz, looking to extend its
hot streak into the postseason.
The Western Intercollegiate
will be held over two days rather
than the regular three. This will
force the golfers to play 36 holes
on Saturday and a standard 18 on
Sunday.
This is the third time the Car
dinal will play an abbreviated
tournament this season; in two
previous outings, the team fin
ished eighth and fourth. Addition
ally, the Western is a six-man tour
nament, counting five scores (in
stead of four) every day.
"We're excited about the West
ern," said head coach Conrad Ray.
"It's a great event, it's close to
home and a really good test of golf.
Pasatiempo is one of the classic de
signs on the West Coast with some
undulating greens and tight fair
ways. It's usually in wonderful

condition, and we're looking for
ward to getting over there this
weekend."
Stanford's Patrick Rodgers is
the defending champion in this
event and is seeking to propel the
Cardinal to its second straight
team win. The sophomore, sitting
at No. 6 in Golf Week's NCAA indi
vidual rankings, is also fresh off a
win at the SH Collegiate Masters
in Las Vegas and a runner-up fin
ish at his home tournament. For
those performances, he was
named the Southern Golf Associa
tion's National Amateur of the
Month for March.
"It is a great honor," Rodgers
said of the award. "Any time you
are recognized for performing
well it is a good thing. I have
worked hard this spring and have
played well this month so it is a
nice award with so many great
players around the country."
While the spectacular sopho
more has grabbed most of the
team's spotlight as of late, junior

very consistent golf. Cur
rently at No. 15 in the
Golf Week individual rank
ings, Wilson knows the chal
lenge the Western Intercolle
giate poses.
"Pasatiempo is a very de
manding course that places a
premium on every aspect of
the game," Wilson said.
"More important than any
one facet of the game will be
staying patient and focused
for the whole event. The first
day is 36 holes so having
enough energy and patience
during the second round will
be important."
For senior Andrew Yun,
the 2012-13 entire season has
had an air of finality, but that
has never been truer than
over the past few weeks.
Coming off his final home
tournament, Yun will start a
regular season event for the
last time in his collegiate ca
reer on Saturday. Also a
Golf Week top-50 player, Yun
gives Stanford a powerful 1-
2-3 punch that should allow
the team to do real damage in

the ultra-competitive Pac-12
Tournament, Regionals and
NCAAs.
"The keys for success for
myself and the team as a
whole will be dependent on a
good short game and course
management," Yun said. "We
really learned a lot from our
victory at Stanford last week.
Playing our home track, we
had great course manage
ment and really showed
strength in our short game.
"Talking to everybody,
nobody in particular hit the
ball well," he added, "but
everybody managed to shoot
a decent score based on
these two aspects. So if we
continue to work hard on our
short game and have a good
understanding of the course,
then we have a recipe for suc
cess."
In addition to earning Ail-
American status and making
the All-Pac-12 first-team, Yun
may need to clear space in his
trophy case for the Byron
Nelson Award. Last week he
was named a finalist for the
prestigious honor, which rec
ognizes a graduating senior
for on-course and academic
performance as well as "char
acter and integrity."
'Andrew Yun continues to

do well as our senior leader,"
Ray commented. "His nomi
nation as a Byron Nelson
award finalist is exciting, and
he's very deserving of that
award. He handles himself
every day very much in the
same mold as Byron Nelson
did when he with us."
As this weekend's tourna
ment is the last one in regular
season play, the Cardinal
golfers know what's truly at
stake at Pasatiempo: mo
mentum. Especially consid
ering the team's stellar per
formances at its last two
events, a good showing
would solidify Stanford's top
-10 national ranking and put
other conference teams on
notice.
"The team is excited be
cause Western is a competi
tive tournament," Ray said.
"We'll get a chance to com
pete against No. 1 Cal, along
with [No. 5] UCLA and [No.
10] USC, so we'll have to be
on our game."
"Winning is a habit," Wil
son added, "and it's hard to
win at the end of the year
having not been in that posi
tion prior to the postseason."
