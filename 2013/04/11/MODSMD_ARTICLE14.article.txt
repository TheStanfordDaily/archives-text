# Out of the hazard and off to Tempe

### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
After seeing its three-tourna
ment win streak snapped at the
Anuenue Spring Break Classic in
Hawaii, the Stanford women's
golf team is seeking a quick turn
around at the PING ASU Invita
tional starting tomorrow in
Tempe, Ariz.
"Hawaii was a tough week for
us but we aren't dwelling on it,"
said head coach Anne Walker. "We
learned from it and have been
working on some things the past
week. We feel like we are ready to
play this week."
The No. 13 Cardinal will cer
tainly need all the momentum it
can gather going into what will be
an extremely tough Pac-12 Tourna
ment, an event which will include
eight top-50 and four top-10 teams.
"We will focus on being ag
gressive and assertive," Walker
said of the team's strategy this
weekend. "The Karsten Course
typically is set up for birdies, and
we must go chase them if we want
a chance to win."
A victory would be the second
for the Cardinal at this tourna
ment and its first since 1998,
though Stanford has also had five

individual champions at the event
over the years. Stephanie Keever
last won at Karsten in 2001.
If Stanford is to finish the reg
ular season strong with a solid
performance in Tempe, Mariah
Stackhouse must continue her
outstanding play. The freshman,
ranked No. 5 in Golf Week's
NCAA individual rankings, will be
going for her third win of the sea
son and seventh straight top-10
individual finish. More important
ly, a strong showing in the desert
will cement her as a true con
tender on the conference and na
tional levels.
"I've been playing solidly, and
I'm sure it's a result of Coach's fo
cus on the improvement of our
short game and playing in tourna
ments regularly," Stackhouse
said. "I've never seen this course,
so I'll pay attention to its layout in
the practice round and approach
it with the same mentality that
I've had this whole year: stay lev
el-headed, make birdies and mini
mize mistakes."
"Mariah has a chance to win
every week, but so do a lot of oth
er players," Walker said of her
blossoming superstar. "She will

fare best if she continues to
focus on herself and taking
care of what she can control.
I believe that Mariah can be
the best at all levels if she
stays the road."
Not only will the Cardinal
need a strong showing from
Stackhouse, but it will also
need help from a relatively
young supporting cast. Lau
ren Kim, another freshman,
has arguably been the sec
ond best golfer on the team
this year with a pair of top
-10 individual finishes. Soph
omore Mariko Tumangan
and senior Sally Watson
have played well in stretch
es, but Stackhouse has been

the only consistent golfer
week-in and week-out.
"Coach has always told us
that it's not a poor finish that
defines us as a team, but it's
how we bounce back from
that poor finish that truly
determines our character,"
Kim said. "I believe we are a
strong team and can com
pete with the best. Finishing
well in this tough field would
be great. I think it is always
important to have momen
tum going into the last part
of our season. It always
helps with confidence."
Watson, for her part, has
embraced more of a leader
ship role with such a young
team.
"I have just tried to lead
by example [by] working
hard and having a good atti
tude," she said. "I think go
ing into the postseason, the

main piece of advice I would
share with the younger play
ers is to have fun and never
stop fighting. We have been
working all year to compete
for a Pac-12 and national
championship, and now we
just need to trust in our
selves and be confident in
the work that we have put
in."
Following PING, the
Cardinal will have a week to
prepare for the Pac-12
Championships, which begin
April 22 in Valencia, Calif.
The NCAA Regional will be
held at the Stanford Golf
Course on May 9-11, and the
NCAA Championships will
take place in Stackhouse's
home state of Georgia from
May 21-24.
