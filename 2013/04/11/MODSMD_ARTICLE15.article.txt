## OP-EDS Why I Got Off the Jane Goodall Bandwagon 
### MARK BESSEN '55 
I met Jane Goodall in 2008 at the
Governors' Global Climate
Summit in California. She was
giving a speech on the importance
of personalizing wildlife to bolster
conservation efforts. Though she
didn't have much novel to say,
Goodall was charming and inspir
ing, and I left the auditorium with a
toothy grin plastered on my face.
After her talk, I was honored
with the opportunity to speak with
Dr. Goodall in a group with five oth
er high schoolers. Her unimposing
stature and genuine enthusiasm for
us "young conservationists" quick
ly stole my heart.
It's easy to love Jane Goodall.
The classic photo of the young Jane
reaching an outstretched hand to a
tentative baby chimpanzee lends a
tenderness to the researcher that
seems to permeate the American
conscience. She has done a lot of
good for humanizing conservation
efforts (and I say humanizing,
rather than "increasing accessibili
ty to," consciously). Aside from the
obvious bias it gave to her research,
naming individual chimpanzees and
tracing their relationships made
many people care about environ
mental preservation.
But there is, I think, a point at
which Goodall adoration goes too
far. Jane Goodall came to Stanford
in the early 1970s as a visiting pro
fessor for the Department of Psy
chiatry. Her primary research site
in the '7os was Gombe Stream Na
tional Park in Tanzania, where she
and her researchers studied the so
cial and courtship behaviors of
chimpanzees.
In 1975, Goodall took four stu
dents including two Stanford
undergrads and a Stanford Ph.D.
candidate to Tanzania to make
field observations. Just over 30
miles from their field site, Laurent
Kabila, a rebel leader actively
working to overthrow the Tanzan
ian government, had established a
heavily armed camp.
In the middle of the night, the
four research assistants were beat
en and taken at gunpoint as prison
ers of Kabila. Goodall, meanwhile,
was tipped off by a Tanzanian
guard and scooted off into the thick
jungle.
The prisoners were kept in
squalid conditions and put up for
ransom. Not Dr. Goodall, nor the
U.S. government, nor the Universi
ty would pay the ransom, claiming
it would be ceding a small victory to
a war criminal. Eventually, the fam
ilies of the kidnapped victims raised
over $460,000 to pay Kabila's ran
som and have the prisoners re
leased.
I don't mean to place the blame
on Goodall here. By no means
should she have been expected to
pay the ransom, nor to exchange
herself for the research assistants,
as some claim. But she should have

spoken out, demanded action. Ask
yourself: how would she have re
sponded if Kabila had captured
four chimpanzees and imprisoned
them in mud huts for weeks?
Instead, Goodall took her re
search out of Tanzania and back to
Stanford campus. Her research
station is still standing aban
doned just between SLAC and
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
The concrete building is lined with
iron bars, behind which Goodall's
"wild" chimpanzees were caged.
The chimps were observed, for
months at a time, to establish psy
chosocial patterns in their behavior
their "normal" behavior when
kept in cement boxes.
This isn't an argument against
animal experimentation, which I
believe does have a place in behav
ioral science. And Dr. Jane Goodall
has done incredible work on publi
cizing conservation efforts by hu
manizing her chimpanzee speci
mens. But as many of you watched
the petite, dynamic woman speak in
Cemex on Sunday, I hope you know
her as more than just the "chimp la
dy" before falling in love with Jane
Goodall's celebrity.
