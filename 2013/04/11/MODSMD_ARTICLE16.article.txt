### DANIEL SMITH '12 
As soon as Nicholas Thomp
son's "The End of Stanford"
was published, I immediately
wrote an impassioned and angry
response. In my four years at Stan
ford (in Thompson's words), I
thought, I read, I met new people,
and I worked on whatever inspired
me. I also spent much of my time
with people who were involved in
areas of study so distant from start
ups and tech that I felt the article
was a blatant mischaracterization
of the student body that assumed,
based on news coverage, that non
tech students were not a significant
or meaningful portion of the stu
dent body.
Midway through my response I
began to recall how, over my four
years, tech did become vastly more
prominent in the University's cul
ture. I recalled many conversations
from my junior and senior years in
which techies had been dismissive
of fuzzies. Certainly most students
did not feel superior based on their
chosen course of study, but these
conversations did occur.
I still believe the article mis
characterizes most of the student
body. But as more students began
using smartphones (my class en
tered university roughly a year af
ter the original iPhone launched!)
and became more addicted to the
Internet than ever, we ah realized
how central tech was to our lives.
Every fall quarter, CSIO6A bal

looned to a larger enrollment
(about 300 people my freshman
year to about 700 people my senior
year). Computer science overtook
Hum√üio as the most popular' major.
Some former Stanford students
sold their app to Facebook for a bil
lion dollars. A brand-new Quad for
engineering and tech was complet
ed. If you seriously want to state
that CS and tech at Stanford are
not more prevalent now than they
were in 2008... where have you
been?
Thompson asserts that the Uni
versity's "center of gravity appears
to have shifted." He credits this to
some kind of encouragement by the
University and its faculty to push
students away from traditional ed

tucational enrichment/thought and
into an alternative startup universe
filled with untold riches and fame.
To blame the University and facul
ty for this feels myopic.
The Great Recession led to a na
tional conversation about the state
of education in America, and how
college students are not emerging
with "real skills" for the workforce.
This seems to be the actual root of
the current situation at Stanford.
Students want to feel empowered
by their education. Students want
to be successful and do not want to
be at the mercy of the current job
market. As Thomas Friedman of
the New York Times recently titled
one of his columns: "Need a Job?
Invent It."

The message America is send
ing to the young people of America
is that since opportunity out there
is limited, you need to pull yourself
up and figure it out on your own.
Students see computer science, and
tech in general, as away to take
control of their destiny in an in
creasingly unstable modern world.
We are living amidst a techno
logical revolution, and Stanford
students are taking up arms in ac
cordance with the Zeitgeist. The
University's center of gravity may
shift over time, but Stanford stu
dents will always think, read, meet
new people and do work that we
find inspiring.
