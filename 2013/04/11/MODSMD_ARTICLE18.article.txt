# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Some Thoughts on the New Yorker Piece 
### Miles Unterreiner 
East Egg has never quite un
derstood West Egg, and the
ancien regime has never
quite understood revolution. As
with America, so also with Stan
ford.
As the United States developed
into an industrial and economic
powerhouse over the course of the
19th century, European intellectual
circles responded with a conde
scending derision borne of the fear
that the Old World would be over
taken and rendered irrelevant.
American scientific and civilization
al advance was met with accusa
tions that Americans were uncul
tured, unduly focused on technolog
ical development at the expense of
refinement and propriety, and
coarsely thumbed their dirty peas
ant noses at art and literature while
heedlessly pursuing monetary
gain.
"The American knows nothing,"
wrote German poet Nikolaus
Lenau in 1833. "He seeks nothing
but money." Heinrich Heine
lamented the very existence of
America, "that pig-pen of Free
dom/Inhabited by boors living in
equality." Heidegger lambasted the
U.S. in 1935 as a land of "dreary
technological frenzy." And the
American spirit of commerce, fret
ted Nietzsche, was "spreading a
spiritual emptiness over the conti
nent."
But America, of course, had its
Mark Twains and F. Scott Fitzger
alds as surely as it did its Rocke

fellers and Vanderbilts, celebrated
its Thoreaus and Emersons as
surely as its Remingtons and
Carnegies. Industry, though per
haps the engine of American pros
perity, was never this country's on
ly or highest calling and those
who asserted otherwise undoubted
ly missed the bigger picture.
So heads-up, Stanford: Lenau,
Heine, Heidegger and Nietzsche
are back in town, and they're writ
ing for the New Yorker. But this
time it's not America being ques
tioned, it's our University. And this
time, it's not the dusty old scrib
blers of Europe secretly wishing
they were on the other side of the
Atlantic; it's the East Coast cultur
al establishment that's missed the
train out West.
In a widely debated April Bth
post on the New Yorker blog,
Nicholas Thompson argues that
Stanford isn't even really a Univer
sity; it's "a giant tech incubator
with a football team" where stu
dents feel pressured to "drop out in
an effort to get rich fast." Building
on the premise established in fellow
New Yorker writer Ken Auletta's
controversial portrayal of Stanford
as "Get Rich U.," Mr. Thompson
(perhaps unwittingly) joins a vener
able intellectual tradition of old
money fretting about the energetic
nouveau riche of the archaic
guardians of hidebound privilege
worrying about the perils of cre
ative destruction. Some snobby
New Yorker commenters even

jumped on the anti-Stanford band
wagon: "When one lacks personali
ty, charisma, looks and charm,"
sniffed one aristocrat who has obvi
ously never had the good fortune to
catch a glimpse of PoliSci professor
Rob Reich, "a pile of money can be
that soft place for them to fall."
I don't want to be too hard on
Mr. Thompson. "The End of Stan
ford" is a short blog piece, not a
print article, and having written my
own fair share of pieces I now fer
vently wish had never gone to print,
I know that writers can occasional
ly churn something out to meet
deadline that isn't representative of
their outlook as a whole. As a Stan
ford alum, I'm sure Mr. Thompson
means well (I corresponded with
him about Mr. Auletta's piece last
year and believe him to be a good
guy and loyal alum), and I don't
think his piece quite deserves the
level of outrage it's sparked on
campus. I also think he's driving at
a seriously important point: what
is, and what should be, the purpose
of a Stanford education? Is career
success enough? (Hint: it isn't.)
Where and to which departments
should greater funding be allocat
ed? Do the majority of startups cre
ate meaningful social value or just
diversionary flashes of light on
iPhone screens and piles of wasted
programming talent?
But despite all this, I think Mr.
Thompson's piece deserves deeper
examination, and that it largely
misses the mark at which it aims.

First and most basically, the
StartUp U. stereotype simply does
n't hold up under closer empirical
scrutiny. Stanford's Humanities
disciplines were ranked #1 in the
world by the London Times' High
er Education Supplement, and as
Kristi over at The Unofficial Stan
ford Blog pointed out, our individ
ual social science/humanities de
partments (among them Psycholo
gy, English, Economics, Political
Science, History, and Sociology)
regularly receive top U.S. News
and World Report rankings. We
just built an elegant $5O million
dollar concert hall and enjoy an ab
solutely gorgeous (and free to the
public) art museum, and Professor
of English Ramon Saldivar won the
National Humanities Medal last
year. I can list Stanford's
Mac Arthur "Genius Grant" recipi
ents (including a well-deserved win
by History professor Richard
White), Nobel Prize winners, and
former Council of Economic Advis
ers chairmen off the top of my
head. The d.school (and Stanford's
countless interdisciplinary majors)
interweave the rigor of technical
study with the elan of the social sci
ences and humanities, all in the
service of solving tough problems
that defy narrow specialization.
(Professor White, for instance,
leads a project called the Spatial
History Lab that connects "data
analysis and complex visualization
graphical algorithms with tradi
tional historical sources" in order to

examine "historic perceptions of
space in the newly settled Ameri
can West.") And as for Mr. Thomp
son's slight on the intelligence of
Stanford student-athletes well,
let's just not go there.
So it's clear from the numbers
that we're a lot more than just "a
giant tech incubator with a football
team." But I think there's a larger,
more important problem here: the
New Yorker appears to mistake
Stanford's focus on high-return eco
nomic ventures for the fundamental
core of its strength rather than one
of many results of that strength.
That is an immensely reductive er
ror, and Mr. Thompson, as a Stan
ford alum, should know better. Start
ups and entrepreneurialism are
quite clearly symptoms, rather than
the sole cause, of the unique ethos
that makes Stanford what it is.
Here are the ingredients of that
special sauce that, at least in my ex
perience, makes Stanford singular:
People here tend to be (at least
compared to students at other top
schools) unorthodox yet hardwork
ing, irreverent but driven, not
afraid to make mistakes, adaptable,
creative, interdisciplinary and hap
pier than most to define themselves
by alternative metrics of success.
(You also, of course, get the pre
med and pre-law kids who plow

themselves into a set career
path from day one, but a)
every major research univer
sity has those and b) society
needs zealous doctors and
lawyers, so more power to
you!). Combine that uniquely
flexible esprit de corps with
brilliant intellects from all
over the world and an encom
passing economic framework
that rewards disruptive inno
vation, and sure, you often get
explosive Silicon Valley suc
cess.
But you also get play
wrights, hippies, politicians
who dream big and think out
side the box; you get Band
Run; you get the friend of
mine who wrote a hilarious
senior thesis on the ethics of
satire, is now at Yale Law
School and will probably end
up as a Supreme Court Jus
tice; you get the John Nash
esque math genius who also
designs puzzles for the week
ly campus humor paper. Our
students come from all walks
of life and throw themselves
into all sorts of tasks, from
activism (take a look at any
STATIC post) to politics to
engineering to computer sci
ence (and sometimes every
thing at once).

All this is part of why I be
lieve so strongly that Stan
ford's many oddities and
quirks, from student-run din
ing to runs through the li
brary, need protection. Be
cause Stanford's success is
inextricably entangled with
the little things that help
keep us weird.
By Ivy standards, Stan
ford is a young and unfet
tered school, much as by Eu
ropean standards, America is
a young and unfettered na
tion. Youth brings strength.
It disdains outdated tradi
tions, breaks barriers, does
n't write letters like this one,
dreams and is dreamed of,
draws the envy of the old and
worn. Sure, all that can mean
Clinkle; it can also mean
Cory Booker.
Stanford is often grouped
with the Ivies on the basis of
average entering test scores,
endowments, influential alum
ni, research funding. Well, I
don't agree. Stanford moves
too fast for encrusting ten
drils of ivy to creep over its
walls and ensnarl the engines
of progress that hum eternal
ly beneath the golden sand
stone. The "College of the
West," wrote David Starr
Jordan in 1904, is home to no
"dewy-eyed monk," no
"stoop-shouldered grammar
ian." The true Stanford schol
ar, he predicted, would be the
"leader of enterprise, the

builder of states."
And in the end, with na
tional unemployment hover
ing at 7.6% and budget
deficits looming ominously,
what's wrong with celebrat
ing ties to industry, technolo
gy, progress? What's intrin
sically wrong with pioneer
ing high-caliber online edu
cation for those who can't af
ford a college degree? We
raised a billion dollars last
year more than any uni
versity in history, largely
thanks to our alumni net
work's financial success,
much of it sourced from
startups and Silicon Valley
and a great deal of that is go
ing to fund medical research
and innovation at Stanford
Hospital. Money may not be
everything, but it sure helps
when you're trying to cure
cancer.
So I'd urge you, New
Yorker editors, to spend
some time rethinking your
position. Stanford may not
look or act like the traditional
university but no matter
what happens, this school will
still be here, forging the fu
ture. And I'll be here in the
sun, thankful to be a part of
this place and forever proud
to call myself a member of
the Stanford community.
Cheers.
