# Wave it goodbye

### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
No. 41 Stanford fell 3-4 to No. 7 Pepper
dine in a non-conference match on Wednes
day, dropping the doubles point for the first
time in five matches but picking up half of the
singles matches en route to a close defeat.

The Cardinal now
has an 8-9 overall
record going into
the end of the sea
son, while the Waves
are 19-4 with a nine
match winning streak.

"Obviously we're disappointed because we
lost and it was very close, but at the same
time we know that we can compete with these
top-10 teams right down to the wire, as we did
today," said sophomore Robert Stineman.
"Unfortunately, we didn't pull it out and we're
all pretty bummed about it, but moving for
ward it's good to know that we are right there
with these guys."
Though the Cardinal has won the doubles
point against some of the nation's best teams,
including No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 USC, the
team struggled to pull off doubles' victories
against Pepperdine.
Stanford started the match with a No. 3 dou
bles win, as juniors Jamin Ball and Daniel Ho
picked up an 8-5 victory against Pepperdine's
Mousheg Hovhannisyan and David Sofaer.
Next to finish was No. 1 doubles, where
sophomore John Morrissey and senior Denis
Lin fell 9-8 in a close match to Sebastian
Fanselow and Francis Alcantara. The Cardi
nal lost the doubles point after freshman Ma
ciek Romanowicz and sophomore Robert
Stineman were defeated 8-5 by Pepperdine's
Finn Tearney and Alex Sarkissian. "In all
honesty, we should have won the doubles
point. There is no reason why we shouldn't
have won it," Stineman said. "We played good
doubles today, we put ourselves in a position
to win but just didn't get it done, which is, in
the end, why we lost."
Stanford's singles players started strong
with victories in the bottom half of the lineup.
On court No. 5, freshman Trey Strobel de
feated Hovhannisyan 6-3,6-4, and Lin defeat
ed Sofaer 7-5, 6-1 at No. 6 singles.
However, these wins were quickly fol
lowed by losses at No. 2 singles, where Ro
manowicz fell to Tearney 6-3, 6-1, and No. 1
singles, where Morrissey was defeated 6-4, 6-
4 by Fanselow.
Though the Cardinal had a chance to win
if the remaining singles players pulled out
victories, Pepperdine took the match on court
No. 3, where Sarkissian defeated Stineman 6-
3, 6-4. The last match to finish was No. 4 sin
gles, where junior Daniel Ho defeated Alcan
tara in a close 7-5,1-6, 6-4 battle.
This weekend, the Cardinal will face un
ranked Arizona and No. 73 Utah at home in
Pac-12 conference matches. Stanford is cur
rently 1-3 in Pac-12 play.
Stanford will play Arizona, who it defeat-

Ed 5-2 last season, on Friday. The Wildcats
have a 10-10 overall record and a 0-4 record in
Pac-12 play after being defeated by No. 2
UCLA, No. 3 USC, No. 30 Oregon and No. 44
Washington.
"They're a good team," said Stineman
about Arizona. "I don't really know too much
about them, but Pac-12 has been doing well
overall this year. We won't take them lightly
by any means. It should be a good match."
No. 75 Utah has a 1-3 Pac-12 record, with
losses against No. 2 UCLA, No. 4 USC and
No. 31 Washington and a victory against No.
43 Oregon. The Cardinal fell to Oregon last
weekend but was able to pull out a 4-3 victory
against Washington.
The Cardinal has performed well histori
cally against Utah, having lost to the Utes on
ly once in a 31-match series. Stanford
clinched a close 4-3 victory over Utah on the
road last year.
Stanford will face off against No. 66 Pacif
ic on April 16 before the team's last Pac-12
match on April 20 against No. 16 Berkeley.
Stineman was optimistic about the team's re
match against Cal after Stanford fell to
Berkeley 2-5 earlier in the season and be
lieves they can "absolutely" pull out a victory.
"We're right in there with the top teams,
and Berkeley is one of the teams that we re
ally feel confident about our chances with,"
Stineman said. "We couldn't quite pull it out
last time but we have improved a lot since
then. We are looking forward to a really good
battle with them."
