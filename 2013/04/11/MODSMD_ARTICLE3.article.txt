## Candidates gain endorsements 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
As students prepare to
vote in this week's ASSU elec
tions, some voters' decisions
will be informed by candidate
endorsements from influential
student groups.
According to ASSU Assis

Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4, receiving endorsements

you stand to be [the endorsing
group's] presence in the AS

SU, to make sure that [the]
conversation and agenda does
bring up the issues that are
important to the various
groups and can be represent
ed fully in the Senate."
Students of Color Coalition
SOCC has historically been
one of the most successful en
dorsing groups. Last year, all
12 Senate candidates endorsed
by SOCC were elected. In
2011, 12 of the 15 SOCC-en
dorsed candidates were elect
ed, and in 2010, 10 of the 12
SOCC candidates were elect
ed. The last four Executive
slates endorsed by SOCC have
