# STUDENT GOVT.
## Candidates gain endorsements 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
As students prepare to
vote in this week's ASSU elec
tions, some voters' decisions
will be informed by candidate
endorsements from influential
student groups.
According to ASSU Assis
tant Financial Manager
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4, receiving endorsements
can be "path-altering" for a
candidate, as endorsing groups
often sway the votes of large
contingents of students.
"It's important for some
one in a community to know
who the people are that they
can vote for who are going to
support their issues," Trusheim
said. "It's a very difficult thing
to wade through 30 or 40 can

didates' platforms and figure
out who is actually going to
represent the issues that they
care about."
ASSU Undergraduate
Senate candidate Brandon
Caruso 'l6, who was endorsed
by the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC), Stanford
Democrats, Jewish Student
Association (JSA) and Queer
Coalition, said that he ap
plied for endorsements be
cause they are "logistically
very helpful" in reaching out
to voters.
"When you are speaking to
individuals in the dining halls
or after class in their dorms,
they recognize [the endorsing
group] right away," Caruso
said. "Once you are elected,
you stand to be [the endorsing
group's] presence in the AS

SU, to make sure that [the]
conversation and agenda does
bring up the issues that are
important to the various
groups and can be represent
ed fully in the Senate."
Students of Color Coalition
SOCC has historically been
one of the most successful en
dorsing groups. Last year, all
12 Senate candidates endorsed
by SOCC were elected. In
2011, 12 of the 15 SOCC-en
dorsed candidates were elect
ed, and in 2010, 10 of the 12
SOCC candidates were elect
ed. The last four Executive
slates endorsed by SOCC have
also been victorious.
"SOCC has been the group
to apply for, for the last three
years now. They do a great
job in mobilizing their base
for support," Trusheim said.
"Last year, a lot of candi
dates who didn't get the
SOCC endorsement dropped
out, because they just didn't
have the time to go up
against that kind of ready
made network of people who
will vote for you."
This year, SOCC en
dorsed Najla Gomez 'l4 and
Elizabeth Patino 'l4 for Ex
ecutive, and Abby Dow 'l6,
Angela Zhang 'l6, Annalis
Breed 'l6, Avery Haskell 'l6,
Brandon Caruso 'l6, Eilaf
Osman 'l6, Hisham Al-Falih
'l6, John-Lancaster Finley
'l6, Natasha Patel 'l6, Ryan
Matsumoto 'l6 and Zane
Hellmann 'l6 for Senate.
Jewish Student Associa
tion
The Jewish Student As
sociation (JSA) endorsed
Dan Ashton 'l4 and Billy
Gallagher 'l4 for Executive.
According to JSA President
Marty Zack 'l4, Gomez and
Patino did not submit an en
dorsement application and
"acknowledged they over
looked it" in an email to the
group after the deadline had
passed.
Gallagher is a Daily
staffer and Ashton is a mem
ber of The Daily's Board of
Directors.
Zack said that he believes
Gallagher and Ashton have
"really excellent qualifica
tions" for the position, refer
encing their "wide and deep
involvement in campus activ
ities and their commitment
to Stanford."
The JSA endorsed Brian
na Brown 'l6, Ben Holston
'l5, Nikos Liodakis 'l6,
Zachary Johnson 'l6, Caru
so, Matsumoto, Patel, Hell
mann, Dow, Breed and Fin
ley for Senate.
"Our goals are often less
specific than they are about
developing a relationship
with the candidates," Zack
said. "We had a few people
from our own community
run this year, so we were
particularly excited to en
dorse them, especially giv
en that the Jewish commu

nity did not have a senator
in the last year."
Stanford Democrats
The Stanford Democrats,
the largest political group on
campus, endorsed Gomez
and Patino for Executive,
and endorsed Caruso, Patel,
Dow, Finley and Johnson for
Senate.
Nick Ahamed 'l5, co
president of the Stanford
Democrats, said that the
group received applications
from 11 Senate candidates
and both Executive slates
this year. Candidates were
chosen based on a written
application and short inter
view.
"First and foremost, we
are looking for someone who
represents progressive ide
ology," Ahamed said. "Be
yond that, we look for people
who have specific ideas of
what they want to get done
as well as experience work
ing with the ASSU."
According to Ahamed,
the Stanford Democrats
placed a new emphasis this
year on candidates who
sought a sustained relation
ship with the group, as a pre
cursor to the group becom
ing more involved with the
Senate next year.
Ahamed noted that the
endorsing panel had been
impressed by Gomez and
Patino's "activist back
ground," and referenced
Dow's plan to expand the
Leland Scholars Program as
particularly notable.
First-Generation Low Income
Partnership
The First-Generation
Low Income Partnership
(FLIP) also endorsed
Gomez and Patino for Exec
utive, and endorsed Dow,
Breed, Lancaster-Finley, Al-
Falih, Patel, Brown, Holston
and Liodakis for Senate.
All FLIP-endorsed can
didates, including nine Sen
ate candidates and the Ex
ecutive slate, were elected
last year. According to FLIP
president Jennifer Telschow
'l3, FLIP looks for a firm
commitment to the group's
issues and constituents when
distributing endorsements.
"We try to figure out how
much they know about our
community," she said. "They
can say they want to help our
community, but if they don't

know anything about it, if
they don't know anything
about our group or the office
we work with, then we kind
of start to question if they
could actually serve us and if
they actually want to serve
us."
According to Telschow,
Gomez and Patino were the
only Executive slate to apply
for FLIP's endorsement.
Gallagher wrote in an email
to The Daily that he and
Ashton chose not to apply
for the FLIP endorsement
because Gomez was listed as
the group's contact on the
Election Commission's web
site.
Telschow said that Gomez
has been a member of the
FLIP Core for two years,
and has shown a "dedication
to our mission."
"Even in their other
groups that are not connect
ed to FLIP they are always
advocating for our communi
ty and for first-generation
low income issues," Telschow
said. "We're pretty confident
that they would represent
our community and allow
our voices to be heard, if
they were elected."
The Stanford Review
The Stanford Review en
dorsed Ashton and Gal
lagher for Executive, and
Dow, Breed, Haskell, Mat
sumoto, Shivani Baisiwala
'l6 (who is no longer listed
on the petitions.stanford.edu
website) and Revanth
Kosaraju 'l6 for Senate.
Judith Romea 'l4, editor
in chief of The Review, said
that The Review's applica
tion asked candidates about
their views on "hot-button is
sues" on campus such as
wellness, diversity, free

speech and ASSU funds
and sought candidates who
would promote a simple yet
effective ASSU.
"We want someone who
can look at the existing stu
dent government and think,
'Where can we find syner
gies within the existing
structures already, and use
this to solve the issues that
are most relevant to the stu
dent body?'" Romea said.
"We believe that Dan Ashton
and Billy Gallagher are the
candidates best equipped to
do that."
Romea noted that The
Review was particularly wary
of candidates who suggested
the creation of advisory or
ganizations that would fur
ther contribute to the AS
SU's bureaucratic nature.
"Other candidates are
promising the creation of
nice-sounding boards or in
stitutions or groups, but as
The Review, we have the
opinion that a larger, more
complicated ASSU doesn't
necessarily translate into a
more effective ASSU," she
said.
Other endorsements
In addition to JSA and
The Stanford Review, Gal
lagher and Ashton received
the endorsement of the
Stanford Student Freedom
Project (SSFP), Club Sports
and The Daily.
Gomez and Patino were
endorsed by the Green Al
liance for Innovative Action
(GAIA), the Women's Coali
tion, the Queer Coalition and
the SSFR as well as SOCC,
FLIP and Stanford Democ
rats.

Gallagher is a Daily

Directors.
Zack said that he believes
Gallagher and Ashton have
"really excellent qualifica

encing their "wide and deep
involvement in campus activ
ities and their commitment
to Stanford."
The JSA endorsed Brian
na Brown 'l6, Ben Holston
'l5, Nikos Liodakis 'l6,
Zachary Johnson 'l6, Caru
so, Matsumoto, Patel, Hell
mann, Dow, Breed and Fin
ley for Senate.
"Our goals are often less
specific than they are about
developing a relationship
with the candidates," Zack
said. "We had a few people
from our own community
run this year, so we were
particularly excited to en
dorse them, especially giv
en that the Jewish commu

nity did not have a senator
in the last year."
Stanford Democrats
The Stanford Democrats,
the largest political group on
campus, endorsed Gomez
and Patino for Executive,
and endorsed Caruso, Patel,
Dow, Finley and Johnson for
Senate.
Nick Ahamed 'l5, co
president of the Stanford
Democrats, said that the
group received applications
from 11 Senate candidates
and both Executive slates
this year. Candidates were
chosen based on a written
application and short inter
view.
"First and foremost, we
are looking for someone who
represents progressive ide
ology," Ahamed said. "Be
yond that, we look for people
who have specific ideas of
what they want to get done
as well as experience work
ing with the ASSU."
According to Ahamed,
the Stanford Democrats
placed a new emphasis this
year on candidates who
sought a sustained relation
ship with the group, as a pre
cursor to the group becom
ing more involved with the
Senate next year.
Ahamed noted that the
endorsing panel had been
impressed by Gomez and
Patino's "activist back
ground," and referenced
Dow's plan to expand the
Leland Scholars Program as
particularly notable.
First-Generation Low Income
Partnership
The First-Generation
Low Income Partnership
(FLIP) also endorsed
Gomez and Patino for Exec
utive, and endorsed Dow,
Breed, Lancaster-Finley, Al-
Falih, Patel, Brown, Holston
and Liodakis for Senate.
All FLIP-endorsed can
didates, including nine Sen
ate candidates and the Ex
ecutive slate, were elected
last year. According to FLIP
president Jennifer Telschow
'l3, FLIP looks for a firm
commitment to the group's
issues and constituents when
distributing endorsements.
"We try to figure out how
much they know about our
community," she said. "They
can say they want to help our
community, but if they don't

know anything about it, if
they don't know anything
about our group or the office
we work with, then we kind
of start to question if they
could actually serve us and if
they actually want to serve
us."
According to Telschow,
Gomez and Patino were the
only Executive slate to apply
for FLIP's endorsement.
Gallagher wrote in an email
to The Daily that he and
Ashton chose not to apply
for the FLIP endorsement
because Gomez was listed as
the group's contact on the
Election Commission's web
site.
Telschow said that Gomez
has been a member of the
FLIP Core for two years,
and has shown a "dedication
to our mission."
"Even in their other
groups that are not connect
ed to FLIP they are always
advocating for our communi
ty and for first-generation
low income issues," Telschow
said. "We're pretty confident
that they would represent
our community and allow
our voices to be heard, if
they were elected."
The Stanford Review
The Stanford Review en
dorsed Ashton and Gal
lagher for Executive, and
Dow, Breed, Haskell, Mat
sumoto, Shivani Baisiwala
'l6 (who is no longer listed
on the petitions.stanford.edu
website) and Revanth
Kosaraju 'l6 for Senate.
Judith Romea 'l4, editor
in chief of The Review, said
that The Review's applica
tion asked candidates about
their views on "hot-button is
sues" on campus such as
wellness, diversity, free

speech and ASSU funds
and sought candidates who
would promote a simple yet
effective ASSU.
"We want someone who
can look at the existing stu
dent government and think,
'Where can we find syner
gies within the existing
structures already, and use
this to solve the issues that
are most relevant to the stu
dent body?'" Romea said.
"We believe that Dan Ashton
and Billy Gallagher are the
candidates best equipped to
do that."
Romea noted that The
Review was particularly wary
of candidates who suggested
the creation of advisory or
ganizations that would fur
ther contribute to the AS
SU's bureaucratic nature.
"Other candidates are
promising the creation of
nice-sounding boards or in
stitutions or groups, but as
The Review, we have the
opinion that a larger, more
complicated ASSU doesn't
necessarily translate into a
more effective ASSU," she
said.
Other endorsements
In addition to JSA and
The Stanford Review, Gal
lagher and Ashton received
the endorsement of the
Stanford Student Freedom
Project (SSFP), Club Sports
and The Daily.
Gomez and Patino were
endorsed by the Green Al
liance for Innovative Action
(GAIA), the Women's Coali

rats.

As students prepare to
vote in this week's ASSU elec
tions, some voters' decisions
will be informed by candidate
endorsements from influential
student groups.
According to ASSU Assis
tant Financial Manager
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4, receiving endorsements
can be "path-altering" for a
candidate, as endorsing groups
often sway the votes of large
contingents of students.
"It's important for some
one in a community to know
who the people are that they
can vote for who are going to
support their issues," Trusheim
said. "It's a very difficult thing
to wade through 30 or 40 can

didates' platforms and figure
out who is actually going to
represent the issues that they
care about."
ASSU Undergraduate
Senate candidate Brandon
Caruso 'l6, who was endorsed
by the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC), Stanford
Democrats, Jewish Student
Association (JSA) and Queer
Coalition, said that he ap
plied for endorsements be
cause they are "logistically
very helpful" in reaching out
to voters.
"When you are speaking to
individuals in the dining halls
or after class in their dorms,
they recognize [the endorsing
group] right away," Caruso
said. "Once you are elected,
you stand to be [the endorsing
group's] presence in the AS

SU, to make sure that [the]
conversation and agenda does
bring up the issues that are
important to the various
groups and can be represent
ed fully in the Senate."
Students of Color Coalition
SOCC has historically been
one of the most successful en
dorsing groups. Last year, all
12 Senate candidates endorsed
by SOCC were elected. In
2011, 12 of the 15 SOCC-en
dorsed candidates were elect
ed, and in 2010, 10 of the 12
SOCC candidates were elect
ed. The last four Executive
slates endorsed by SOCC have
also been victorious.
"SOCC has been the group
to apply for, for the last three
years now. They do a great
job in mobilizing their base
for support," Trusheim said.
"Last year, a lot of candi
dates who didn't get the
SOCC endorsement dropped
out, because they just didn't
have the time to go up
against that kind of ready
made network of people who
will vote for you."
This year, SOCC en
dorsed Najla Gomez 'l4 and
Elizabeth Patino 'l4 for Ex

Angela Zhang 'l6, Annalis

to The Daily that he and
Ashton chose not to apply
for the FLIP endorsement
because Gomez was listed as
the group's contact on the
Election Commission's web
site.
Telschow said that Gomez
has been a member of the
FLIP Core for two years,
and has shown a "dedication
to our mission."
"Even in their other
groups that are not connect
ed to FLIP they are always
advocating for our communi
ty and for first-generation
low income issues," Telschow
said. "We're pretty confident
that they would represent
our community and allow
our voices to be heard, if
they were elected."
The Stanford Review
The Stanford Review en
dorsed Ashton and Gal
lagher for Executive, and
Dow, Breed, Haskell, Mat
sumoto, Shivani Baisiwala
'l6 (who is no longer listed
on the petitions.stanford.edu
website) and Revanth
Kosaraju 'l6 for Senate.
Judith Romea 'l4, editor
in chief of The Review, said
that The Review's applica
tion asked candidates about
their views on "hot-button is
sues" on campus such as
wellness, diversity, free

speech and ASSU funds
and sought candidates who
would promote a simple yet
effective ASSU.
"We want someone who
can look at the existing stu
dent government and think,
'Where can we find syner
gies within the existing
structures already, and use
this to solve the issues that
are most relevant to the stu
dent body?'" Romea said.
"We believe that Dan Ashton
and Billy Gallagher are the
candidates best equipped to
do that."
Romea noted that The
Review was particularly wary
of candidates who suggested
the creation of advisory or
ganizations that would fur
ther contribute to the AS
SU's bureaucratic nature.
"Other candidates are
promising the creation of
nice-sounding boards or in
stitutions or groups, but as
The Review, we have the
opinion that a larger, more
complicated ASSU doesn't
necessarily translate into a
more effective ASSU," she
said.

In addition to JSA and
The Stanford Review, Gal
lagher and Ashton received
the endorsement of the

Project (SSFP), Club Sports

Gomez and Patino were

liance for Innovative Action
(GAIA), the Women's Coali
