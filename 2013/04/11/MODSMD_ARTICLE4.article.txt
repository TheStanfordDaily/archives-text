# Internationals seek need-blind review
## Plans for funding took hit after recession 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Even as gaining admission to Stanford
becomes increasingly challenging, with an
admit rate this year of 5.7 percent, interna
tional students in need of financial aid con
tinue to face another obstacle to matricu
lating because unlike peer institutions
such Harvard, Yale and Princeton Stan
ford lacks need-blind financial aid for inter
nationals.
The Office of Financial Aid manages a
portfolio of scholarships and grants worth
over $l4O million, offering an average fi
nancial aid package for the slight major
ity of undergraduates who qualify—of
$42,354, from total charges of $54,508 for
the 2012-13 academic year.
While admission to Stanford for Ameri
can students is need-blind, no similar pro

gram exists for international students, who
currently constitute —at just under 10
percent —a smaller portion of the under
graduate population than at institutions
like Harvard. While some internationals do
receive financial aid, their admissions deci
sions take anticipated financial aid into
consideration.
Karen Cooper, director of Financial
Aid, emphasized that the topic continues to
be an important issue for the University's
President and Board of Trustees but said
that she was unaware of any plans to intro
duce or pilot need-blind admission for in
ternationals, in part due to the expensive
nature of such an initiative.
"The Financial Aid Office has been in
creasing the number of international stu
dents admitted with eligibility for aid
based on the funds available
each year, which have been
growing steadily thanks to
the generosity of our alumni,"
she said.
Financial aid programs
are currently predominantly
supported by the University
endowment, which supplies
60 to 65 percent of funds
used. However, even as the
endowment enjoys unprece
dented growth, most dona
tions are earmarked.
"While fundraising overall
raised over one billion dollars
[this past year], most of it was
in the form of gifts with very
specific purposes in mind,"
she said.
To supplement endow
ment funds, Cooper said the
Financial Aid Office also
draws money from sources
like The Stanford Rmd and
Presidential Fund. Stanford
also participates in third-par
ty scholarship programs, like
The MasterCard Foundation
Scholars Program, which al
lows for Stanford to admit 20
students from sub-Saharan
Africa with full funding. The
program will effectively allow
for funding for five students
per year for the next four
classes.
"President [John] Hen

nessy, in one of his addresses
a few years ago, said that
[need-blind admission for in
ternational students] would
be [one of] his main goals,"
Cooper said, referencing a
2005 report in which Hen
nessy recommended "that we
set a longer-term goal to
move toward need-blind ad
missions for international stu
dents."
"I'd just say that there has
been discussion about being
need-blind for internationals
for many years, as this [afore
mentioned] document from
2005 can attest", Cooper said.
Shahab Fadavi 'l5, an in
ternational student, served
on the ASSU Senate this past
year, devoting much of his
campaign platform and time
in office to the issue.
"Need-blind admission for
international students was an
issue I emphasized in my
campaign for Senate and was
an issue I pursued seriously
when I was a senator," Fadavi
said.
According to Fadavi, plans
for giving international stu
dents need-blind admission
and accompanying financial
aid had been laid out before
the 2008 economic crisis but
were set aside in the subse
quent period of forced auster
ity.
"It was a difficult time fi
nancially for the University
then, and I understand why
the issue was set aside for the

time being then", he said.
Lan Chan 'l4, an interna
tional student from Hong
Kong, said that the inclusion
of financial circumstances in
international admissions deci
sions deterred him from ap
plying for aid.
"I do have many friends
who I went to school with in
Hong Kong who didn't apply
to Stanford but applied to
peer institutions on the East
Coast which did have need
blind international financial
aid," Chan said. "I feel that
this hampers our ability to at
tract the best and the bright
est from the outside world. It
is troublesome that our inter
national students do not come
from as diverse a socioeco
nomic group as they can."
Fadavi echoed Chan's sen
timent that bright students
are being discouraged from
applying to Stanford and ex
pressed optimism that im
proving University finances
might allow the issue to be re
visited.
"Stanford is doing ex
tremely well financially," Fa
davi observed. "We raised
$1.2 billion this year... Our
endowment is booming. Now
that the University is doing so
well financially, I foresee fi
nancial aid for internationals
[sic] being instated very
soon."
