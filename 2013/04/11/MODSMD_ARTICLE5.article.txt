## Debate coach rejuvenates team 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
For the last two decades, Stanford's
policy debate team has been largely ab
sent from the national circuit, last qualify
ing for the National Debate Tournament
in 1992. Debate juggernauts Northwest
ern, Harvard and Dartmouth have collect
ed a combined 26 championships; Stanford
doesn't have a single one.
That dubious streak, however, may be
nearing an end. Stanford's policy debate
team turned some heads at the 67th Na
tional Debate Tournament (NDT) as a
freshman-sophomore team led by a new
full-time policy coach entered the elimina
tion rounds as the 22nd best team in the
country.
"This was our first real year having a
policy program," said Sukhi Gulati 'l6, one

of Stanford's debaters at the NDT. "Being
a freshman was a huge deal. There was a
buzz at the tournament about that."
In previous years, Stanford's policy de
bate team never stood much of a chance.
The team hired its first full-time coach just
two summers ago and needs to travel to
debating powerhouses to attend tourna
ments, usually on the East Coast.
"It's difficult to overstate the impact
