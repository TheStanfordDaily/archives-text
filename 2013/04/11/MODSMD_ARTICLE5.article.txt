## Debate coach rejuvenates team 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
For the last two decades, Stanford's
policy debate team has been largely ab
sent from the national circuit, last qualify
ing for the National Debate Tournament
in 1992. Debate juggernauts Northwest
ern, Harvard and Dartmouth have collect
ed a combined 26 championships; Stanford
doesn't have a single one.
That dubious streak, however, may be
nearing an end. Stanford's policy debate
team turned some heads at the 67th Na
tional Debate Tournament (NDT) as a
freshman-sophomore team led by a new
full-time policy coach entered the elimina
tion rounds as the 22nd best team in the
country.
"This was our first real year having a
policy program," said Sukhi Gulati 'l6, one

of Stanford's debaters at the NDT. "Being
a freshman was a huge deal. There was a
buzz at the tournament about that."
In previous years, Stanford's policy de
bate team never stood much of a chance.
The team hired its first full-time coach just
two summers ago and needs to travel to
debating powerhouses to attend tourna
ments, usually on the East Coast.
"It's difficult to overstate the impact

director of policy debate] has
had on the team," said Jake
Sonnenberg 'l5, Gulati's de
bate partner. "We really
wouldn't be nearly as suc
cessful if he wasn't here."
Manuel was forced to
build a debate program from
the ground up.
"When I came it seemed
to be that [Stanford policy
debate] was going through a
lull. Basically, some years
there were only two or three
kids interested in policy de
bate," Manuel said. "When I
say rebuilding, I'd say there's
probably a 10-20 year period
where there was no serious
interest in policy debate."
Policy debate is different
from its counterpart, parlia
mentary debate, because of
its focus on research and or
ganization over actual per
suasion. While "parii" topics
are given out minutes before
debaters are posed the ques
tion, policy debaters spend
weeks amassing all the evi
dence they can.
In competition, policy de
baters deliver as much infor
mation as quickly as possible
to the judges, gasping for
breath as they do so. Accord
ing to Manuel, student sched
ules and the lack of a proven
track record in policy debate
historically led most Stanford
debaters to the less time-in
tensive parliamentary team.
Manuel, a star high school

debate coach and former as
sistant policy coach at six
time national champion Har
vard, was hired two seasons
ago after debaters realized a
full-time coach was neces
sary to build a competitive
program.
"Because we didn't have
someone dedicated to coach
ing and growing the team,
people weren't interested in
joining," Manuel said. "One
of the major things that I've
done at Stanford is to make
kids believe that they're go
ing to have a coach and direc
tor that is going to be dedi
cated to both their individual
success and team success."
In his second year, he has
already surprised many in
the debate world, even his
own team.
"We really outperformed
expectations at District
Championships and the Na
tional Pre-Tournament,"
Sonnenberg said. "The team
has grown a lot. It's incredi
ble that [Manuel] has only
been here two years."
As recruitment for colle
giate debate continues to in
tensify, Manuel's hiring puts
Stanford is in a position to
compete nationally while also
giving the team an opportu
nity to compete for the top
high school debate talent.
"He recruited me to come
to Stanford and debate," Gu
lati said. "He said he was
working on something new,
and we could be the next big
thing."
