# BACK TO BLITZ
## Defense challenges offense on Wednesday 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Payback time.
After being bested by the Cardinal offense
in a short-yardage competition Saturday, the
Stanford defense fought back with a fury on
Tuesday during a third-down blitz session.
"[The blitz session went] really well for the
defense," said head coach David Shaw. "Trent
Murphy was unstoppable today."
The message was clear to the offense: Don't
expect to have much success in scrimmages.
Not only is the Cardinal defense a physically
dominant group, but it's also filled with veter
ans who have a lot of experience playing to
gether in defensive coordinator Derek Mason's
system.
And that means that Mason can put togeth
er very complex blitz packages, or as Shaw
termed them, "controlled chaos." Combined
with the varied looks given by senior free safe

ty Ed Reynolds and junior strong safety Jor
dan Richards in the secondary the first team's
pass rush is nearly impossible to stop.
But there are some young guys up front
who are improving quickly with the hope of
turning the tide in that difficult preseason bat
tle. Sophomore offensive linemen Andrus Peat,
Kyle Murphy and Joshua Garnett, all top re
cruits who earned significant playing time in
2012, are taking steps towards landing starting
roles.
"I think Andrus Peat has taken great
strides," Shaw said. "I think Kyle Murphy's
taken some big strides. I think Josh has taken
smaller strides, and we're going to keep push
ing him because he's got the ability to be real
ly good at this game."
For Peat, those great strides have made
him the near-certain choice to start the season
at left tackle. His road hasn't always been
smooth, though.
The potent Stanford pass rush has domi
nated Peat at times in his young career, but
those difficult reps have put Peat in his current
position to succeed. One particular memory

Sophomore Joshua Garnett (above) has
improved physically and mentally thorughout the
year to put himself in a good position to start in
the offensive line next season for the Cardinal.
that jumps out at Shaw from
Peat's "baptism by fire"
came from a particularly
rough drill last August.
"He went through a
stretch of one-on-one pass
[protection] where he didn't
win any of them," Shaw said.
"I passed by him after... and
I said, 'this is good for you...
this is going to be good for
you because there's no better
place to learn.'"
Murphy's ascent to a
starting role might take one
more year; Peat and senior
right tackle Cameron Flem
ing look to have a near lock
on their jobs. But with Mur
phy's athleticism and Stan
ford's recent tight-end exo
dus, there's a good chance
Murphy will see time some
where on the offensive line.
Garnett is perhaps the

most perplexing of the three.
One of the biggest linemen
on the team, Garnett suc
ceeded in down-blocking sit
uations as early as the first
game of last season. Many
believed that it would only be
a matter of time before Gar
nett assumed one of the
starting guard spots.
But fifth-year senior
Kevin Danser still has a hold
on his returning spot at right
guard, and Garnett won't be
unseating All-American
David Yankey on the left side
any time soon. That means he
will have to improve quickly
to staid in September.
For Garnett, much of the
improvement so far this
spring has been mental.
"I think [l'm] definitely
processing the offense a little
better," Garnett said. "I've
still got a lot of stuff tech
nique-wise I've got to work
on. That's what we're doing.
We're out here trying to get
better."
Improving technique isn't

just an on-field task for Gan
nett. Much of his improve
ment will have to come work
ing out over the next few
months with the strength
and conditioning staff.
"I definitely think if I can
get flexible enough, that will
get my game better," Gar
nett said. "I'm a stronger
guy, so I try to brute-force
people and not stay low, and
that's giving me a lot of trou
ble right now. If I can get
flexibility and get my pads
down and work on that dur
ing the offseason, I think it'll
help me out a lot coming into
summer."
Garnett and Stanford
have one final day of scrim
mages before putting away
the pads until August. The
team hosts the Cardinal &
White Spring Game Satur
day at 3 p.m. at Stanford Sta
dium. The game will be open
to the public.
