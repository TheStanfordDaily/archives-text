# BACK TO BLITZ
## Defense challenges offense on Wednesday 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Payback time.
After being bested by the Cardinal offense
in a short-yardage competition Saturday, the
Stanford defense fought back with a fury on
Tuesday during a third-down blitz session.
"[The blitz session went] really well for the
defense," said head coach David Shaw. "Trent
Murphy was unstoppable today."
The message was clear to the offense: Don't
expect to have much success in scrimmages.
Not only is the Cardinal defense a physically
dominant group, but it's also filled with veter
ans who have a lot of experience playing to
gether in defensive coordinator Derek Mason's
system.
And that means that Mason can put togeth
er very complex blitz packages, or as Shaw
termed them, "controlled chaos." Combined
with the varied looks given by senior free safe

ty Ed Reynolds and junior strong safety Jor
dan Richards in the secondary the first team's
pass rush is nearly impossible to stop.
But there are some young guys up front
who are improving quickly with the hope of
turning the tide in that difficult preseason bat
tle. Sophomore offensive linemen Andrus Peat,
Kyle Murphy and Joshua Garnett, all top re
cruits who earned significant playing time in
2012, are taking steps towards landing starting
roles.
"I think Andrus Peat has taken great
strides," Shaw said. "I think Kyle Murphy's
taken some big strides. I think Josh has taken
smaller strides, and we're going to keep push
ing him because he's got the ability to be real
ly good at this game."
For Peat, those great strides have made
him the near-certain choice to start the season
at left tackle. His road hasn't always been
smooth, though.
The potent Stanford pass rush has domi
nated Peat at times in his young career, but
those difficult reps have put Peat in his current
position to succeed. One particular memory
