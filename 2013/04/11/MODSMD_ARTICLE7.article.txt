## Hopkins team unlocks secrets of Humboldt squid

William Gilly, a scientist at the
Hopkins Marine Station, having
part of his finger bitten off by a
Humboldt squid on a mid-ocean re
search trip was simply an occupa
tional hazard.
Though sometimes dangerous,
Gilly's dedication to his pioneering
research about the Humboldt
squid has been rewarded with ex
tensive publication and research
grants from prominent organiza
tions like National Geographic and
the National Science Foundation.
In recent years, Gilly and his re

search partners have attained na
tional recognition for new discov
eries about the species, which typ
ically inhabits oceanic waters off of
Northern California and can reach
the size of a human.
Gilly's discoveries have wide
spread ecological and economic im
plications, as Humboldt squid have
played an increasingly large role in
the Pacific Ocean's ecosystem as
the territory that the species in
habits expands.
The squid are unique in that
they can adapt to low-tempera
ture, low-oxygen zones by slowing
down their movements and meta
bolic rates, allowing them to sur
vive in areas that are inhospitable

to other species.
"As the oxygen levels in the
ocean are dropping, this is actually
helping the [Humboldt] squid,
whereas in the case of most ani
mals, it's hurting them," noted
Hannah Rosen, a second-year
Ph.D. student in Gilly's lab.
Rosen believes that as the
Humboldt squid's population in
creases and interacts with a
greater degree with other popula
tions, further research on the
species will become more neces
sary.
"We need to know more about
them because of the impact on oth
er animals that might be compet
ing with the squid for food or that

might feed on the squid," she said.
Despite the species' impor
tance, Rosen said that the Hum
boldt squid has been "very under
researched" thus far. According to
Rosen, several factors contribute
to the difficulty of researching the
species, including the fact that
most squid can survive for only a
few days in captivity and will often
sustain injuries by propelling
themselves into the sides of the
tanks.
Because of the difficulty of
studying the species in captivity,
most research is conducted in the
field. However, the Humboldt
squid's nocturnal lifestyle
complicates efforts to track
the species and strains re
searchers.
"You're lost at sea and
doing months worth of re
search within a few short
weeks," Rosen said of her
experience tracking the
squid.
In the future, Gilly hopes
to raise funds for a study of
the mechanisms behind the
squid's ability to change col
or from red to white, a func
tion for which the underly

ing neural processes are
"very little known."
Gilly emphasized the
broader context of his re
search by citing other remark
able experiences at sea, such as
witnessing mesopelagic lantern
fish â€”who have light organs
below each eye at night in
the Gulf of California.
"I had never seen that
before," Gilly said. "No one
on the ship had ever seen
that before. I've talked to
friends of mine in Baja
who've gone fishing thou
sands of times, and they've
said, 'Oh yeah! I saw that
once.'"
