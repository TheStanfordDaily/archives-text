# CAMPUS LIFE
## Club offers Scottish pastimes 
### NIUNIU TEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Making a sport out of swinging
hammers and throwing anvils may
initially seem at best like an anti
quated hobby. Even so, anyone
walking by the Sand Hill Intramu
ral Fields on any given Tuesday or
Wednesday night will likely wit
ness an eclectic group of individu
als male and female, young and
oldâ€” swinging hammers with as
much enthusiasm as their kilted
predecessors did in Scotland cen
turies ago.
That eclectic group of individuals
coalesces under the auspices of the
Cardinal Highland Athletic Club, a
recreational athletics group that fo
cuses on indoctrinating the Univer
sity community in the tradition of
Scottish Highland athletics. That di
verse grouping of sports includes,
among others, the stone put and the
caber toss.
Alan Hebert's reasons for start
ing the group may, in fact, be just as
diverse. Hebert, the club's co
founder and a self-proclaimed "IT
guy" at the School of Medicine's
Beekman Center, said that he was
inspired to found the club after de
veloping an interest in the music of
river dancing, which he conceded is
a traditionally Irish pastime.
"I do have Scottish ancestry, but
you have to go way back to find it,"
Hebert said. "I got into [Scottish
culture] because of the music, really.
It's sort of embarrassing, but I went
to riverdance, which is Irish [and]
not Scottish."
After discovering an apprecia
tion for the low whistle, an instru
ment that typically begins a river
dance, Hebert decided to celebrate
the roots of his Anglo-Saxon her
itage through kilt wearing and
playing Scottish sports with the
club.
Bethany Owen, Hebert's co-cap
tain, currently works with the Stan
ford Blood Center as a phle
botomist. She originally attended
recreational Cardinal Highland club
events to support Hebert and other
friends but then decided to try
throwing for herself.
"It looked like fun," Owens said.
"When I tried it, I was like 'this is so
much more fun than walking around
in a tight skirt. I'd rather play.'"
In addition to practicing twice a
week, the club also participates in

bi-monthly competitions with other
highland groups in the Bay Area.
On average, there are about seven
to 10 events in each competition,
with an aggregate scoring system.
Athletes must participate in all
events to receive a score. The
events include throwing stones,
weights, hammers and cabers, in a
selection of different weights.
Hebert claimed that despite the
extensive history of highland athlet
ics, events created in the United
States have begun to seep back into
Scottish practices.
"When you go to highland games
in Scotland, there are almost always
costume running races, and there
are often long-distance bicycling
races," Hebert said. "But they have
[some throwing events now] that we
do."
The club accepts anyone who ex
presses interest, regardless of age,
gender or Scottish heritage.
"Ted started throwing when he
was 64," Hebert said, in reference to

one of their most regular members
and a Bay Area local. "I happened to
be at the Woodland Games [in
Sacramento], and I kept seeing Ted
and his wife. He just turned to me
and said, 'What do you have to do to
get involved with this?'"
Though the group includes mem
bers of all skill levels, some partici
pants take the competition serious
ly-
One such individual is Summer
Pierson 'OO, a three-time world
champion in throwing. Her time as a
discus thrower on Stanford's track
and field team eventually con
tributed to her interest in highland
athletics.
"My coach suggested that I try
the highland games, to do some
thing in the off-season that was re
lated, but not exactly similar," she
said. "When it was presented to me,
I wasn't anticipating to be very good
at it. I intended to give it my all, but
I didn't intend on ending up a world
champion."

However, after winning her third
world championship, Pierson decid
ed to take a break from throwing
competitively in order to focus on
her career as a genetic counselor in
Palo Alto.
"It was getting a little out of
hand," she said. "At what point do
we finally say 'yeah, you're pretty
efficient?"'
Even so, Pierson said that she is
considering competing again in the
fall.
Beyond the competition, team
members cited the club's cama
raderie and the opportunity to let
off steam as positive attributes.
"It's as much about the social as
pect as it is about the physical as
pect because everybody is very sup
portive of everybody else," Owens
said. "And when everything else is
going crappy, you can go out and
throw heavy things and make
everything better."

"For me, it was very competi
tive," Pierson added, conceding that

most other participants do so recre
ationally. "For other people, it's a
chance to get out and try something
new."
According to Hebert, that fun
loving and light-hearted spirit is
what started the organization in the
first place.
"It takes a certain open minded
ness to take a crack at this," he said.
'And that's probably the only unify
ing characteristic."
Hebert also emphasized the
sport's broad appeal and ease of ac
cess, identifying only three qualifi
cations to compete.
"You have to sign the insurance
waiver so you won't sue anybody,
and you have to have a kilt," he said.
"And you have to have whatever
crazy inclination it takes to stand up
with a rock or a hammer or a caber
in front of a whole bunch of people
and see what you can do."
