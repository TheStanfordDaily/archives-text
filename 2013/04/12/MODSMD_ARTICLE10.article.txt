## Cardinal clues in Spring Game 
### Sam Fisher 
Football is back at Stanford
Stadium! Well, to be fair, it's
just a scrimmage, but in mid-
April, I'll take it; I don't real
ly have another choice...
In the spirit of my excitement to see
expected preseason top-five Stanford
football back in its normal home, I'm
going to take a week off from spewing
my ludicrous opinions to bring back my
fall column: an in-depth preview of
what to watch for on Saturday
First, there's the format, which is
very different than a normal game.
Stanford will mix and match different
units of its offense and defense against
each other in 12-15 play sessions. Try
ing to understand the scoring system is
an upper-level course, and it doesn't re
ally matter anyway so I'll let you learn
on the fly
The most interesting part of the
Spring Game is getting a first look at
the up-and-coming players of the fix
ture, specifically pxojected new
starters for the fall. On this front, the
most exciting players to watch will be
sophomore wide receivers Kodi Whit
field and Michael Rector.
Whitfield earned some playing
time midway through 2012, but he's
poised to make a big jump in 2013. He's
not the fastest of the receivers—that's
between Rector and junior Ty Mont
gomery—but every defensive back
has praised his great route-running
ability. That sounds like a good replace
ment for Drew Terrell to me.
The real fun could come from Rec
tor and Montgomery. Like Whitfield,
both have impressed the secondary
throughout the spring. But unlike
Whitfield, those two make their impact
through speed. Junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan has improved on his deep
passing game, so expect to see him go
deep at least a few times to keep the
Stanford defense (which loves flying up
the field to stop the run) honest.
But the wildcard to watch will be
sophomore running back Barry J.
Sanders. The son of NFL Hall of
Famer Barry Sanders, one of the most
electric running backs of all-time, has
begun making a name for himself in
spring practice. Competing for time in
a very crowded stable of running
backs, Sandere "makes a play a day"
according to Stanford head coach
David Shaw. In the open scrimmages,
Sanders has broken a few big runs,
showing agility reminiscent enough of
his father to make fans drool.
You can't talk about Stanford foot
ball without talking about the defense.

As I mentioned Thursday the defense
dominated the offense in third-down
blitz situations Tbesday. A big part of
that was fifth-year senior outside line
backer Thent Murphy
Murphy is such a dangerous pass
rusher because of the combination of
his 6-foot-6, 261-pound frame and his
freakish athleticism. Murphy's length
allows him to win the hands battle
against most offensive linemen.

There is one notable lineman with
the length to match up against Mur
phy: sophomore left tackle Andrus
Peat, who stands at 6-foot-7, 310
pounds. Though his overall weight
hasn't changed much since arriving
last summer, it has been "redistrib
uted... he just looks leaner," accord
ing to Shaw, with much less fat and
more muscle.

The battle between Murphy and
Peat could be epic. Once Stanford gets
into the season, both will face the scout
team in practice, not each other. The
spring game could be one of your last
chances to see those two go head-to
head.

The last thing I would put on my
viewing guide is the comerback shuf
fle. With Terrence Brown 'l2 leaving

for the NFL Draft and senior Barry
Browning still recovering from sur
gery —he will be healthy for camp
Stanford has been forced to do some
reshuffling in the secondary to provide
two units of comerback depth.
One of the most interesting devel
opments from that has been the deci
sion to give fifth-year senior Usua
Amanam and junior Ronnie Harris,
the Cardinal's top-two nickelbacks, a
chance to play corner.
Amanam's play at corner is espe
cially intriguing. He had the ability to
change the game every time he went
on the field in 2012, scoring on kick
coverage at UCLA and sealing the
Rose Bowl win with an interception.
But as a nickelback, he doesn't get as
much playing time against teams with
a pro-style or more run-focused at
tack.

If Amanam can be effective at cor
ner in the Spring Game, that could
earn him the opportunity to get on the
field a lot more often in 2013. And if he
keeps up the exciting play that turned
him into a fan favorite, those extra
plays could make a big difference.

Sam Fisher is hoping his perform
ance as football writer this spring
could, earn him, a place in The Dai
ly's starting football lineup come fall

poised to make a big jump in 2013. He's
not the fastest of the receivers—that's
between Rector and junior Ty Mont
gomery—but every defensive back
has praised his great route-running
ability. That sounds like a good replace
ment for Drew Terrell to me.
The real fun could come from Rec
tor and Montgomery. Like Whitfield,
both have impressed the secondary
throughout the spring. But unlike
Whitfield, those two make their impact
through speed. Junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan has improved on his deep
passing game, so expect to see him go
deep at least a few times to keep the
Stanford defense (which loves flying up
the field to stop the run) honest.
But the wildcard to watch will be
sophomore running back Barry J.
Sanders. The son of NFL Hall of
Famer Barry Sanders, one of the most
electric running backs of all-time, has
begun making a name for himself in
spring practice. Competing for time in
a very crowded stable of running
backs, Sandere "makes a play a day"
according to Stanford head coach
David Shaw. In the open scrimmages,
Sanders has broken a few big runs,
showing agility reminiscent enough of
his father to make fans drool.
You can't talk about Stanford foot
ball without talking about the defense.

As I mentioned Thursday the defense
dominated the offense in third-down
blitz situations Tbesday. A big part of
that was fifth-year senior outside line
backer Thent Murphy
Murphy is such a dangerous pass
rusher because of the combination of
his 6-foot-6, 261-pound frame and his
freakish athleticism. Murphy's length
allows him to win the hands battle
against most offensive linemen.

There is one notable lineman with
the length to match up against Mur
phy: sophomore left tackle Andrus
Peat, who stands at 6-foot-7, 310
pounds. Though his overall weight
hasn't changed much since arriving
last summer, it has been "redistrib
uted... he just looks leaner," accord
ing to Shaw, with much less fat and
more muscle.

The battle between Murphy and
Peat could be epic. Once Stanford gets
into the season, both will face the scout
team in practice, not each other. The
spring game could be one of your last
chances to see those two go head-to
head.

The last thing I would put on my
viewing guide is the comerback shuf
fle. With Terrence Brown 'l2 leaving

for the NFL Draft and senior Barry
Browning still recovering from sur
gery —he will be healthy for camp
Stanford has been forced to do some
reshuffling in the secondary to provide
two units of comerback depth.
One of the most interesting devel
opments from that has been the deci
sion to give fifth-year senior Usua
Amanam and junior Ronnie Harris,
the Cardinal's top-two nickelbacks, a
chance to play corner.
Amanam's play at corner is espe
cially intriguing. He had the ability to
change the game every time he went
on the field in 2012, scoring on kick
coverage at UCLA and sealing the
Rose Bowl win with an interception.
But as a nickelback, he doesn't get as
much playing time against teams with
a pro-style or more run-focused at
tack.

If Amanam can be effective at cor
ner in the Spring Game, that could
earn him the opportunity to get on the
field a lot more often in 2013. And if he
keeps up the exciting play that turned
him into a fan favorite, those extra
plays could make a big difference.

Sam Fisher is hoping his perform
ance as football writer this spring
could, earn him, a place in The Dai
ly's starting football lineup come fall
