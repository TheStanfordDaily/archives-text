## Cardinal clues in Spring Game 
### Sam Fisher 
Football is back at Stanford
Stadium! Well, to be fair, it's
just a scrimmage, but in mid-
April, I'll take it; I don't real
ly have another choice...
In the spirit of my excitement to see
expected preseason top-five Stanford
football back in its normal home, I'm
going to take a week off from spewing
my ludicrous opinions to bring back my
fall column: an in-depth preview of
what to watch for on Saturday
First, there's the format, which is
very different than a normal game.
Stanford will mix and match different
units of its offense and defense against
each other in 12-15 play sessions. Try
ing to understand the scoring system is
an upper-level course, and it doesn't re
ally matter anyway so I'll let you learn
on the fly
The most interesting part of the
Spring Game is getting a first look at
the up-and-coming players of the fix
ture, specifically pxojected new
starters for the fall. On this front, the
most exciting players to watch will be
sophomore wide receivers Kodi Whit
field and Michael Rector.
Whitfield earned some playing
time midway through 2012, but he's
poised to make a big jump in 2013. He's
not the fastest of the receivers—that's
between Rector and junior Ty Mont
gomery—but every defensive back
has praised his great route-running
ability. That sounds like a good replace
ment for Drew Terrell to me.
The real fun could come from Rec
tor and Montgomery. Like Whitfield,
both have impressed the secondary
throughout the spring. But unlike
Whitfield, those two make their impact
through speed. Junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan has improved on his deep
passing game, so expect to see him go
deep at least a few times to keep the
Stanford defense (which loves flying up
the field to stop the run) honest.
But the wildcard to watch will be
sophomore running back Barry J.
Sanders. The son of NFL Hall of
Famer Barry Sanders, one of the most
electric running backs of all-time, has
begun making a name for himself in
spring practice. Competing for time in
a very crowded stable of running
backs, Sandere "makes a play a day"
according to Stanford head coach
David Shaw. In the open scrimmages,
Sanders has broken a few big runs,
showing agility reminiscent enough of
his father to make fans drool.
You can't talk about Stanford foot
ball without talking about the defense.
