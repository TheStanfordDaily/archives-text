# TIME TO BUCKLE DOWN
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
A back-loaded Pac-12 schedule
is about to pay dividends for Mark
Marquess.
When the venerated Cardinal
baseball head coach assembled the
2013 conference slate, he couldn't
have expected that he would begin
Pac-12 play without his two star
juniors, slugging right fielder
Austin Wilson and solid right
handed starter A.J. Vanegas. But
both of those two players were out
of the picture by the end of opening
weekend.
Predictably, Stanford struggled
to find consistency at the plate
thi'ough its first 25 games while its
battery of freshman pitching re
placements sprinkled impressive
moments amongst blowup innings.
But Stanford managed to scrap to
gether a 5-4 record against some of
the worst competition in the Pac-12
its weekend opponents (Utah,
Washington State and USC) fin
ished at the very bottom of the con
ference in 2012 and remains just
two games back of conference
leading Oregon State.
Now with Vanegas and Wilson
back in the mix, the Cardinal (17-
10, 5-4 Pac-12) hosts one last mis
matched series against Washington
(8-22,2-7) at Sunken Diamond as it
looks to establish itself as a legiti

mate contender for a Pac-12 title
before it begins a bi'utal in-confer
ence stretch. Stanford also has the
chance to climb back into the rank
ings after falling out for the first
time all season last week.
This weekend's set is a must

win if the Cardinal wants to regain
some national i*espectability, and
look for Vanegas and Wilson to
steal the spotlight if Stanford is to
be successful.
Though Vanegas won't pan out
as the reliable Saturday starter he
was expected to be in 2013, he has
already made an impact coming out
of the bullpen, compiling a 2.57
ERA in his six appearances since
March 26.
Wilson, meanwhile, is still nurs
ing the elbow injury he sustained in
the season opener against Rice.
Regardless, the first-round MLB
prospect hit 2-for-4 in each of the
Cardinal's last two contests and is
expected to start in the field after
his recent rehab stint as the team's
designated hitter.
After a rough weekend at USC,
Stanford's starting pitching staff
has the opportunity to take advan
tage of a Washington offense that
ranks worse than 200th in the
countiy in eveiy major statistical
category. But who Marquess will
start after senior ace Mai'k Appel
(5-2) remains a bit of a mystery.
Freshmen Marcus Brakeman and
Bobby Zai'ubin lasted just 2.1 com
bined innings in their two starts
last weekend, while the team's pre
sumed Saturday starter back in
February, sophomore lefty John
Hochstatter, was relegated to mid
week duty in the Cardinal's 10-8

win against San Jose State on
Tuesday.
Another promising young pitch
er, local product Freddy Avis, made
his Stanford debut with two perfect
innings on March 26, but stressed
the injury that had kept him off the
mound for the first month of the
season. According to Baseball
America reporter Aaron Fitt, Avis
didn't make the trip with the team
to Washington State last weekend,
so he probably won't be the answer
against the struggling Huskies ei
ther.
Behind the dish, junior Brant
Whiting has established himself as
the Cardinal's starting catcher for
the time being. Though he opened
the season as the Tuesday catcher
and the weekend backup to sopho
more Wayne Taylor, Whiting has
taken over weekend duty as well
recently, starting all three games at
USC a week ago and hitting 7-for
-15.
Untested Washington right
hander Jared Fisher (0-1) will take
the mound against Appel tonight at
5:30 p.m. at Sunken Diamond. Jun
ior righty Austin Voth (3-4) will
start on Saturday for the Huskies
at 1 p.m.; neither starter has been
determined for Sunday's 1 p.m.
matinee.
