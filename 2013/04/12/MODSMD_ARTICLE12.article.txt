# Duo leads Card past SJSU
## 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
There have been some great
duos in sports history. Magic and
Kareem. Rice and Montana. Wade
and Le√üron. In Stanford's softball
history, at least, there soon may be
another pair to add to its list of out
standing duos: senior infielder Jen
na Rich and sophomore outfielder
Cassandra Roulund. Rich and
Roulund went a combined 6-for-8
with four RBIs on Wednesday
night, as the Cardinal (28-12, 5-7
Pac-12) rolled over local non-con
ference rival San Jose State (29-13,
7-2 WAC).

In a game where the Spartans
were sloppy throughout, Rich and
Roulund certainly were not, as the
two batters that form the heart of
Stanford's lineup quickly made
short work of SJSU's pitching.
When both players are in sync, as
the Spartans soon found out, the
Cardinal is very difficult to beat.
As the first part of this dynamic

duo, Rich drew special enei'gy for
Wednesday's game from the fact
that she was celebrating her birth
day. True to her overall form and
her performances on prior birth
days, Rich excelled, hitting two
home runs in a 3-for-4 day at the
plate. On a night when SJSU had
absolutely no method for stopping
Rich, it took a sudden gust of wind
in left field to prevent her warning
ti'ack shot in the bottom of the sixth
inning from becoming her third
home ran of the night.
After singling in the first in
ning, Rich unleashed the long ball
on the Spartans. In the bottom of
the third inning, the El Segundo,
Calif., native uncorked a toweling
homer off of sophomore relief pitch
er Madison Fish down the left-field
line that carried the hedges next to
the scoi'eboai'd the solo shot
gave the Card a 4-0 lead.
However, Rich certainly was
not done.

Fish gave way to fellow sopho
more right-hand reliever Jordan
Sauceda in the fourth inning, but
also failed to find any success
against Rich, serving up a first
pitch fast ball that Rich once again
drove deep to left. In the process,
Rich recorded her sixth multi

homerun game of her career while
increasing her RBI total to a team
leading 33 RBIs.
When asked about hitting at
least one home run on her birthday
for the third consecutive year, Rich
said "For me personally, it was like
any other game, and I feel like I
came up to bat with a clear mind."

While Roulund was not able to
rely on a birthday for motivation,
the sophomoi'e fi'om Trabuco
Canyon, Calif., was nevertheless
focused and determined at the
plate light at the start of Wednes
day's contest. Roulund got the Car
dinal on the scoi'eboai'd in the bot
tom of the first inning by crashing
a double into the gap in right-cen
ter field.

Roulund nearly notched her
seventh triple of the season on the
play, but last year's Pac-12 Fresh
man Honorable Mention selection
was called out on the base path af
ter a nice tag by Spartans fresh
man third baseman Taylor Purdy.
Even though she had been thrown
out, Roulund still plated two on the
extra-base hit.

Roulund subsequently singled
in the third and sixth innings to

complete her day. After the game,
Rich was effusive in her praise of
Roulund, stating, "I know 800
[Roulund] is going to get the job
done ... hitting triples left and right.
The goal of tonight was to go up to
bat swinging at our pitches, being

disciplined at the plate. And our
coach [Stanford head coach John

Rittman] was stressing that we need
to be relaxed up there, not too over
ly anxious, and I think 800 demon
strated that."
Roulund is now second on the
team in RBIs with 27, while leading
the way for the Cardinal lineup with
a .591 slugging percentage.
After a week off, Stanford re
tons to action next Wednesday with
another non-conference home game
