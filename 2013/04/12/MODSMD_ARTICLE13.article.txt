## Stanford heads to the desert 
### WILL SEATON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The month of April has been very good to
the No. 13 Stanford women's tennis team (14-
3, 6-1 Pac-12). The team is 3-0 this month with
wins over Oregon and local rival Santa Clara,
going 19-2 in these three matches. Stanford
finished its last home game of the regular sea
son with a 7-0 win over Hawaii this past Tues
day.

This weekend, the Cardinal will face No. 75
Arizona (9-11, 1-6 Pac-12) and No. 21 Arizona

State (15-3, 5-2 Pac-12) in its first matches
against a ranked opponent since a hard loss to
No. 5 USC 5-2 in late March.

"It'll be great to end the season with quality
opponents right before Ojai," said junior Kristie
Ahn. "It helps us get into the right mindset for
the Pac-12 Championships. We're all very ready
for the postseason to get stalled."
A positive change for this weekend is that
No. 20 junior Nicole Gibbs will be back in the
lineup after missing two matches due to injury.
"Obviously she's a great competi
tor and at the one spot, she's al
ways competing really hard," Ahn
said. "We feel confident when she
takes the court because the team
knows she can handle her matches
and that confidence pushes itself
down the lineup."
With Gibbs back on the court,
Stanford has its full lineup and can
capitalize on the team's ever-in
creasing resilience.
"As a team we've come together a
lot more than the beginning of the
season when we had a tough loss
against Saint Mary's and Florida,"
said senior Natalie Dillon. "The last
two matches, Gibbs wasn't playing
and I think it demonstrated more
of the depth of our lineup. We're re
ally coming together much more as
a team."

Having a two-match stretch
against unranked opponents all on
the road is a great chance for the
players to fine tune some things be
fore their last regular* season match
against California and Pac-12 Cham
pionships starting in two weeks.
"Every match you can learn some
thing from," Dillon said. "For match

es against unranked opponents who
aren't in our conference, it's really an
opportunity for us to focus on each
point and practice taking care of busi
ness. It's easy for us to lose focus but
the things we focused on are keeping
our mental toughness, winning the
points we needed to. A match is a
match regardless of who you're play
ing."

Both ASU and Arizona are com
ing off two losses of their own to
USC and UCLA and looking to end
their regular season at home with a
quality win over Stanford.
Both opponents have solid home
records, taking advantage of the
heat in the desert they are so accus
tomed to. Arizona is 7-3 at home
while ASU is 9-2. Despite the differ

ing weather conditions, the Cardi
nal is confident it can adapt its play
ing style for a winning result.
"We've done pretty well this
year on the road," Dillon explained.
"Arizona is definitely different con
ditions though. It's a lot hotter, dri
er, the air is thinner and so the ball
flies a little more, but like I've said,
we've come together a lot. We feel
confident in our doubles and our sin
gles in every spot."
Stanford plays Arizona starting at
12:30 p.m. in Thcson today and con
tinues its road swing against Arizona
State tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. in
Tempe.
