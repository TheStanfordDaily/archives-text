## Stanford heads to the desert 
### WILL SEATON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The month of April has been very good to
the No. 13 Stanford women's tennis team (14-
3, 6-1 Pac-12). The team is 3-0 this month with
wins over Oregon and local rival Santa Clara,
going 19-2 in these three matches. Stanford
finished its last home game of the regular sea
son with a 7-0 win over Hawaii this past Tues
day.

This weekend, the Cardinal will face No. 75
Arizona (9-11, 1-6 Pac-12) and No. 21 Arizona

State (15-3, 5-2 Pac-12) in its first matches
against a ranked opponent since a hard loss to
No. 5 USC 5-2 in late March.

"It'll be great to end the season with quality
opponents right before Ojai," said junior Kristie
Ahn. "It helps us get into the right mindset for
the Pac-12 Championships. We're all very ready
for the postseason to get stalled."
A positive change for this weekend is that
No. 20 junior Nicole Gibbs will be back in the
lineup after missing two matches due to injury.
