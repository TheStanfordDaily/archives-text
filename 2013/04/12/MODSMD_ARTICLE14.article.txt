## SEEING GREEN The 						Fate of the Dammed 
### Holly Moeller 
Last week, in a fit of wpring
cleaning, I unearthed a pile
of National Park Service
brochures displaced from bedroom
walls now cluttered with maps of
Alaska. One of them, an eye-catch
ing portrait of a Pacific Northwest
rainforest, bore the headline "Free
ing the Elwha."
When I collected that Olympic
National Park brochure nearly
three years ago, I didn't even know
"the Elwha" was a river, much less
that its two large dams were slated
for removal beginning in late 2011.
Now, it's hoped that by summer's
end, this Washington State river
will flow free for the first time in a
century.
Over the last year and a half, the
Elwha's transformation back into
an untamed river has caught the at
tention of fishermen (welcoming
the return of the salmon migration
once blocked by concrete), boaters
(navigating a changeable river
course as decades of stored sedi
ment are purged from the
riverbed), hydrologists (excitedly
measuring shifts in water flow rate
and level), and conservation biolo
gists (checking their predictions
against the actual trajectory of
ecosystem restoration).

And no wonder: The Elwha is
the site of the largest dam removal
project in United States history.
But it certainly won't be the last.
Now that we've dammed two-thirds
of the world's rivers, we're witness
ing the large-scale environmental
effects of these structures. Yes,
they generate electricity, control
flooding, and secure water supplies.
But they also block the movement
of aquatic creatures, especially mi
gratory fish like salmon that swim
upriver to breed. They intercept
nutrient-laden sediment that previ
ously replenished the floodplain be
low. They induce water-rights con
flicts and diminish downstream wa
ter supply and quantity. And the
lakes that form behind them dis
place plants and animals includ
ing, sometimes, people and can
play host to harmful algal blooms.
Do the benefits outweigh these
costs? When dams were novel and
rare, the answer was usually "yes."
But today, American infrastructure
is reaching the age of reevaluation.
The average age of our 84,000 dams
is 52 years. Four thousand dams
are already in need of repair, 2,000
of which would threaten human life
if they failed. And it's when we look
at these dams that we're increas
ingly deciding, "No. Dam removal
is the best option."
Just last week, the Department
of the Interior recommended dis
mantling four dams in Northern
California and Southern Oregon to
free the Klamath River.

The decision was based heavily
on the astronomical costs of retro
fitting and re-permitting the struc
tures, plus the restoration benefits
to the salmon and steelhead fish
eries, whose stocks have fallen to a
fraction of historical levels. Dam re
moval should also help resolve the
water-rights conflicts that flood the
region every dry year.
But that hasn't stopped the
dam-removal negotiation from
turning into a multi-year bureau
cratic odyssey that teeters on the
brink of collapse with every new

wave of elected officials. If the dams
are removed, it won't be cheap. The
Department of Interior estimates
$290 million in costs, plus almost $1
billion in restoration efforts like
building bat habitats to replace the
cavernous dam infrastructure. But
it will theoretically be a better fi
nancial deal in the long run.
Of more concern to me, though,
is the effect of taking the dams' col
lective 163 MW of electricity-gen
erating capacity offline. The dams
produce enough electricity to pow
er 70,000 homes, and they do it us
ing a renewable resource. Where
will the replacement power come
from?

While the government report
doesn't delve much deeper than the
financial details (coal is the only
cheaper alternative), it does note
that, if dam owner PaeifiC orp holds
to California's 2020 standard of 33-
percent generation from renewable
resources, the dam removal will ac
tually reduce the emission of green
house gases.
That's because hydroelectric
power isn't always squeaky-clean.
In this case, by trapping sediments
below relatively calm lake waters,
the dams set up the ideal habitat
for methane-emitting microbes.
Methane is a potent greenhouse
gas, so eliminating the dams, and
the methane source locked behind
them, could represent an important
emissions reduction.

In any case, the optimistic calcu
lation amounts to emissions reduc
tions of only a few percent, which
will hardly halt climate change in
its tracks. So while dam removal
makes good ecological sense at a lo
cal scale, I'm not keen on taking all
our hydroelectric power offline.
What we have, then, is yet an
other battle between what we need
to use and what we can afford to
protect or, in this case, restore.
Perhaps, as this generation of dams
turns over into the next, we can use
the last century's lessons and tech
nological innovations to sidestep
some of this conflict. Then, it be
comes a matter of deciding what
we're willing to do without. Power
sockets or sockeye salmon? Ready
irrigation or a wilderness paddle?
