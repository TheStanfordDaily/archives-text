# NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND
## Structural Racism and a Response to Adam Johnson 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
I've been thinking about my col
league Adam Johnson's column
"Everyone can be racist" since I
read it in February, but until this
week I had been at a loss of words on
how to respond to it.
On Saturday, an article popped up
on my Facebook newsfeed from a
blog that a friend of mine runs called
Black Girl Dangerous that offered
the most coherent critique I have yet
found.
"How To Be A 'Reverse-Racist':
An Actual Step by Step List For Op
pressing White People" is a satirical
piece that outlines the list of struc
tural and systemic injustices that are
impossible for people of color to wage
against white people or even each
other —in a Western context. En
slavement, land theft, erasure of his
tory, and perpetuating negative
stereotypes in the media are just
some of these items.

The point of the piece is to cri
tique anyone who claims we live in a
post-racial society; namely that the
historical traumas systems of white
supremacy have brought against
people of color persist to the present
day.

The main opposition I have to
Adam's piece is this: sure, any indi
vidual has the potential to be racist
against somebody else, but on a sys
temic and structural level, racism in
the United States only exists against
non-white people. And since Adam
largely cites structures (the White
House, the Supreme Court, the busi
ness apparatus of the United States),
it remains surprising to me that he
uses individuals to extrapolate to
statements about the structures they
represent or the systems in which
they participate.
In other words, to offer an inter
vention to Adam's piece, I concede:
yes, the phrase "only white people
can be racist" is false. People of color
can be racist against themselves,
members of their own race, or
against others. But the fact that re
mains is that systems and institu
tions are not, and cannot be, racist
against white people in the United
States.

Having a black person in the Oval
Office or two minority individuals on

the Supreme Court does not mean
that the black community (as a
group) has any power in the United
States, or that the Supreme Court is
suddenly supportive of minority in
terests. It just means that two indi
viduals now have to work within the
constraints of an institution that has
otherwise served to legitimate white
power (and occasionally make the
tiniest of concessions when maintain
ing this power becomes unfeasible.)

Brown v. Board of Ed is what I
consider here, righting as it did the
outrageously wrong ruling of Plessy
v. Ferguson nearly 60 years after the
Court allowed Jim Crow to take over
the country. "With all deliberate
speed" did very little to integrate
schools as we saw three years lat
er with the Little Rock Nine. And to
day, we accept the de facto segrega
tion of our schools (and general un
derdevelopment of resources based
on race and class) since it's not codi
fied into law.

I'm operating from a "liberation
versus rights" perspective, wherein
things like gay marriage, for exam
ple, do nothing to address the under
lying issues of homophobia, violence
and lack of resources that queer peo
ple (especially women, transpeople,
people of color, the disabled and the
structurally poor) face. Civil rights
were not and are not enough.
Studying in Cape Town helped

me see ever more clearly that, while
you can give people "rights" by end
ing apartheid or Jim Crow, the un
derlying structures of labor exploita
tion, the underdevelopment of com
munity resources, and the internal
ized ideology of white superiority all
remain. A survey whose results were
published in the University of Cape
Town newspaper last week, in which
respondents cited whites as the most
attractive race and blacks as the least
(in a country where blacks are 80
percent of the population and whites
only 10 percent) is a very extreme ex
ample of this last point.
So while I agree with Adam's di
agnoses — that people of color can
be racist towards others (though usu
ally more towards other minorities
than towards white people), and that
iterations of feminism can alienate
men when the ultimate goal of the
movement is gender liberation for
everyone the prescription that I
and my closest friends work with is
"So...we need a revolution!"

I present this column as a call to
hear my colleague's thoughts are on
structural racism vis -a-vis his Feb
ruary column. Readers can see more
