# FINAL SEASON TEST
## TOP-5 TEAMS VISIT THE FARM 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball
prepares for its last two
games of the regular season
this weekend. The Cardinal
will be playing No. 5 Cal
Baptist and No. 1 BYU at
home at Maples Pavilion to
day and tomorrow, respec
tively.
While the No. 8 Cardinal
(14-11) knows it will be going
to the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tourna
ment, this weekend will be
critical in terms of postsea
son seeding. Stanford's suc
cess in the MPSF Tourna
ment is essential if the Car
dinal wishes to go to the
NCAA Tournament, and a
higher seed will provide the
Cardinal with a much-need
ed advantage.
The team is coming off an
uneven week in which it fell to
No. 4 UC Irvine but then ral
lied to win against unranked

UCSD. While the UC Irvine
game was close and junior
outside hitters Brian Cook
and Steven Irvin combined
for a total of 17 kills the
Anteaters proved to be too
much for the inconsistent
Cardinal to overcome.
However, Stanford was
resilient in the next contest
by beating the Tritons with a
dominant offensive perform
ance. Irvin, Cook, and junior
middle blocker Eric Mochal
ski all had double-digit kills
and the Cardinal won in
three sets. It returned home
from its road trip sitting at
seventh place in the MPSF
but with a strong attacking
performance that may pro
vide the team with some con
fidence going into its remain
ing two regular season
matches.
The Cardinal will need to
maintain its poise if it hopes
to beat both the first- and
fifth-ranked teams in the na
tion. BYU has been ranked
No. 1 for six straight weeks
and will be the No. 1 seed in
the MPSF tournament re
gardless of this weekend's
outcome.

Stanford lost its first
match against BYU —which
was at Smith Fieldhouse
back in February —in five
sets but showed tremendous
composure in a very intense
and aggressive road envi
ronment. While BYU has
only lost four matches this
season and had not lost for
over a month, the Cougars
were swept in their most re
cent match against No. 3
UCLA.
Stanford should focus on
containing junior hitter Tay
lor Sanders and must be ag
gressive from the start if it
hopes to hold off the No. 1
team in the nation. The Card
is also looking for another
strong performance from
Mochalski, who hit .533 last
match in what was one of his
best games on the season.
The team will also face
No. 5 Cal Baptist this week
end. While Cal Baptist is in
eligible for the MPSF this
year because it is new to the
conference, the Lancers
have been successful lately
with a four-game winning
streak and their highest
ranking of the season. Back
in February, Stanford beat
the Lancers during their
first match up of the season
in one of the Cardinal's few
road wins this year.
Cal Baptist senior outside
hitter Levi Cabral was
named the MPSF Player of
the Week on Tuesday after
the team's 2-0 performance
against two top-10 oppo
nents last week. The Cardi
nal defense, especially block
ing defense, will need to con
tain the 6-foot-6 hitter, who
collected a combined 24 kills
and 11 digs against No. 7
UCSB and UCLA. Stanford
must concentrate on service
return with Cabral's power
ful service game and will
need to combine strong de
fense with an offensive per
formance similar to the one
it had against UCSD.
Maples has been a critical
tool to the Cardinal's success
this season, with the team
only losing two games at
home. It will also be Jake
Kneller's senior night on
Saturday, so the team will be
hoping for strong home
crowd to give it an edge in a
critical last weekend before
the MPSF Tournament.
Stanford and Cal Baptist
squares off at 7 p.m. today
and the contest against BYU
is scheduled to begin at 7
p.m. tomorrow.
