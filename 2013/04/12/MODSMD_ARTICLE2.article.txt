# WOMEN'S SPORTS FEATURE SERIES
## BEYOND TITLE IX 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Julie Foudy '93 was just one year old
when the groundbreaking Title IX
equality law, passed in the summer
of 1972, kick-started a revolution in
women's college sports by enforcing a bal
ance between the funding of men's and

women's programs.
Looking back from
the clarity of our posi
tion 40 years later, the
impact of Title IX is ob
vious and striking, but
in Foudy's early child
hood, the implications
of the higher education
equality law on
women's sports were
not clear. The NCAA
claimed its implemen
tation was illegal and
continued to resist its
regulations until the
1981-82 season, when
in a rush it introduced
12 new women's sports,
raising the total num
ber from just two to 14.
Over the past two
weeks, The Daily has
told the story of Title
IX and women's sports
at Stanford, from the
program's history to
the experiences of both
players and coaches.
Foudy's story ex
emplifies how far we

have come. Already a World Cup winner
(1991), she was still unaware of the law's
implications when she received Stanford's
first ever women's soccer scholarship in
her senior year. As women's sports began
to receive a more equal footing, she went
on to win two Olympic gold medals (1996,
2004), another World Cup (1999) and when
she finally hung up her professional boots,
she became a sports broadcaster. Complet
ing the circle, she commentated for ESPN
on Stanford's first NCAA women's soccer
national title in 2011.
But enough of the past, now it's time to

look to the future.
♦ ♦♦
The reality of college sports today is
that memories of life four decades ago
seem distant and hazy. The incessant four
year turnover of athletes and students en
sures this, and all current college stars
grew up long after most of the dust had set
tled on Title IX.
"The interesting thing to me is that the

girls at any school,
for that matter —at
this point, they have no
idea what it was like,"
said Anne Gould '72 MA
'BO, who coached the
Stanford women's ten
nis team from 1976-79.
"You kind of expect a
scholarship, you expect
great coaching, you ex
pect a trainer... it's just
a whole different ball
game."
Current Stanford
women's basketball coach
Tara VanDerVeer agreed
that female athletes to
day have far more op
portunities that she did
growing up in the 1950's
and 1960'5.
"[They] play on
teams, travelling teams,
high school teams, go to
basketball camps," Van-
DerVeer said. "It really
is all night and day, and
I really would kill to
trade places with any

one of [my players]."
Growing up in the post-Title IX era,
Olympic beach volleyball triple-gold medal
ist Kerri Walsh Jennings 'OO never even
had to face the prejudices and lack of op
portunity characteristic of previous gener
ations.
"I had every single door opened for me,
I think very much so because of Title IX, the
house I was raised in and the situations I was
presented with," Walsh Jennings said. "I just
consider myself an athlete, not a female

athlete."
While the war for equality
in college sports seems won,
there are, however, still bat
tles being fought.
In 2002, thirty years after
Title IX was born, the Com
mission on Opportunity in
Athletics was put together to
review its application and ef
fects. It ultimately produced
a report that Foudy, a mem
ber of the panel, was highly
critical of. Together with two
time Olympic gold medalist
swimmer Donna de Varona,
she feared it laid too much
blame on the law for the loss
of men's sports and it would
roll back many of the gains
made in collegiate athletics.
"Universities often used
the excuse of Title IX when
they talked about cutting
programs," Foudy explained.
"[They] didn't want to talk
about the fact that they're
pouring money into pro
grams that maybe aren't
making money, but they're
still going to try to pour mon
ey into them."
The American Sports
Council also unsuccessfully
sued the Department of Edu
cation in 2011 over similar
fears that the enforcement of
quotas in high school could
remove opportunities for
boys to play sports and lead
to the loss of boy's teams.
Beyond the legal enforce
ment of equality in school
sports, though, the media
driven perception of women's
sports still noticeably lags be
hind that of men's, Take, for
example, the case of Stan
ford's two basketball teams.
Every single regular-sea
son Stanford men's game this
year was screened live on tel
evision, but the same cannot
be said of the women's
games. The men's NIT loss
to Alabama in March was
broadcast on ESPN's main
channel, while the women's
clash with then-reigning na
tional champions and No. 1
Baylor in November was
omitted from the television
schedule entirely. And
though the No. 1 vs. No. 2
clash between Stanford and
Connecticut late in Decem
ber was picked up by ESPN,
it was relegated to the ESP
NU channel to make way for
the New Era Pinstripe Bowl
(ESPN) and the Kraft Fight
Hunger Bowl (ESPN2).
♦ ♦♦
Perhaps, though, it is now
time to look beyond both Ti
tle IX and college athletics
and concentrate on profes
sional sports. University var
sity programs help generate
a huge pool of talent, but in
comparison to male athletes,
there exist relatively few op
portunities for female ath
letes to turn their passions
into careers.
The largest professional
women's sports league in the
United States, the 12-team
WNBA, lags considerably
behind the 30-team NBA.
ESPN's new deal with the
WNBA is worth $l2 million a
year; the NBA's current deal
with the same broadcaster is
worth $930 million annually;
$1 million per team compared
to $3l million.
"I think that we're be
hind," VanDerveer said. "The

men's NCAA has been
around for 75 years, we need
more players playing, more
really good players, and more
opportunities for women. I
think [athletic equality for
women] has come a long way,
but probably the media, the
television exposure is an area
[for improvement]."
The WNBA is, though, an
exception to the rule. Stan
ford has had five players
drafted in the first round of
the WNBA draft in the last
five years: Candice Wiggins
'OB (No. 3), Jayne Appel 'lO
(No. 5), Kayla Pedersen 'll
(No. 7), Jeanette Pohlen 'll
(No. 9) and Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike 'l2 (No. 1). Two of those
players already have WNBA
winner's medals Wiggins
(Minnesota Lynx, 2011) and
Pohlen (Indiana Fever, 2012)
and all are virtually guar
anteed to be able to play out
their careers as profession
als. The same cannot be said
of many other women's
sports.

"[Women's success at the
collegiate level] has to trans
late a little better to some of
the other professional
leagues," said Stanford ten
nis head coach Lele Forood
'7B. "Unfortunately, the soc
cer league can't seem to stay
afloat. So I guess that would
be the next wave, where it
can translate."
In the 19905, women's
soccer had unparalleled suc
cess in the USA, in stark
contrast to its standing in
more traditional soccer
countries. U.S. women's na
tional team won the inaugu
ral tournament in 1991 and
then as hosts, won both the
inaugural Olympic tourna
ment in Atlanta in 1996 and
the World Cup again at the
end of the decade in 1999.
Women's soccer players be
came national heroes and
household names, far more
famous than their US men's
counterparts over that peri
od: Foudy, Mia Hamm, Kris
tine Lilly, Brandi Chastain,
Michelle Akers and others.
The hype generated by
this success led to the found
ing of the Women's United
Soccer Association in Febru
ary 2000, but three seasons
later, in the week before the
2003 Women's World Cup,
the eight-team WUSA fold
ed. A second attempt was
made in 2009 with the
Women's Professional Soc
cer league, but that too sus
pended operations last year
after just three seasons.
"Professional leagues are
basically what the market
can bear," Foudy said. "It's
hard to create a sustainable
model right now... but I do
think we can get there. I
don't think the model is we
have to look exactly like the

men's professional leagues,
which I think is the mistake
we make. Trying to grow too
big too early[l]."
Hoping to learn from
past mistakes, the third at
tempt to create a women's
professional league in the
U.S. kicks off tomorrow, with
FC Kansas City and Port
land Thorns FC playing in
the inaugural game of the
new, eight-team National
Women's Soccer League.
Former Stanford goalkeeper
Nicole Barnhart 'O4 will fea
ture for Kansas City and de
fender Rachel Buehler 'O7 is
on the Portland team. Stan
ford's presence will also be
felt elsewhere in the league
in Teresa Noyola 'l2 (Seattle
Reign FC), Kelly O'Hara 'lO
(Sky Blue FC), Rachel Quon
'l3 (Chicago Red Stars),
Mariah Nogueira 'l3
(Boston Breakers) and Alina
Garciamendez 'l3 (Washing
ton Spirit).[2]
Foudy believes that the
key to the success of this
new league may be its inten
tion to try to avoid copying
existing professional leagues
too closely.
"There is a model out
there that balances it, where
you can create a really good
product... an entertaining
product and create a really
loyal fan base," Foudy said.
"Maybe it's not 80,000 [fans]
a game, but maybe its
10,000,15,000."
This realization may be a
sign that women's sports are
maturing to the point they
no longer need to try to fash
ion themselves in the image
of their male counterparts.
"People are comparing
women less to men now, and
just appreciating female ath
letes for who they are,"
Walsh Jennings said, "I
think those are really impor
tant trends you can't com
pare apples to oranges.
That's not fair to anybody."

Foudy, Walsh Jennings
and many other ex-Stanford
stars and benefactors of Ti
tle IX have served as impor
tant role models for aspiring
girls, exemplifying what
they can achieve on the field
or court and inspiring them
to dream big.
"When you have that
many kids playing and they
have a chance to finally fol
low a team I never had
that chance [and] have a
chance to finally watch girls
playing the sport in front of
big crowds, that dream sud
denly becomes much more
realistic for them," Foudy
said.
But the future battle
grounds for athletic equality
are no longer in college and
the inspiration that Foudy
and Walsh can give young
girls may, on its own, not be
enough. The challenge now is
to tear down the barriers
that persist in professional
sports and focus the media
spotlight more fairly on
men's and women's athletics.
The question is whether the
Farm can play as key a role
in that as it has in the revolu
tion of college sports [4].
Seeking equality within a
university like Stanford may
be a noble cause, but without
real opportunity in the world
outside, it is not really equal
ity at all.

Perhaps, though, it is now
time to look beyond both Ti
tle IX and college athletics
and concentrate on profes
sional sports. University var
sity programs help generate
a huge pool of talent, but in
comparison to male athletes,
there exist relatively few op
portunities for female ath
letes to turn their passions
into careers.
The largest professional
women's sports league in the
United States, the 12-team
WNBA, lags considerably
behind the 30-team NBA.
ESPN's new deal with the
WNBA is worth $l2 million a
year; the NBA's current deal
with the same broadcaster is
worth $930 million annually;
$1 million per team compared
to $3l million.
"I think that we're be
hind," VanDerveer said. "The

men's NCAA has been
around for 75 years, we need
more players playing, more
really good players, and more
opportunities for women. I
think [athletic equality for
women] has come a long way,
but probably the media, the
television exposure is an area
[for improvement]."
The WNBA is, though, an
exception to the rule. Stan
ford has had five players
drafted in the first round of
the WNBA draft in the last
five years: Candice Wiggins
'OB (No. 3), Jayne Appel 'lO
(No. 5), Kayla Pedersen 'll
(No. 7), Jeanette Pohlen 'll
(No. 9) and Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike 'l2 (No. 1). Two of those
players already have WNBA
winner's medals Wiggins
(Minnesota Lynx, 2011) and
Pohlen (Indiana Fever, 2012)
and all are virtually guar
anteed to be able to play out
their careers as profession
als. The same cannot be said
of many other women's
sports.

"[Women's success at the
collegiate level] has to trans
late a little better to some of
the other professional
leagues," said Stanford ten
nis head coach Lele Forood
'7B. "Unfortunately, the soc
cer league can't seem to stay
afloat. So I guess that would
be the next wave, where it
can translate."
In the 19905, women's
soccer had unparalleled suc
cess in the USA, in stark
contrast to its standing in
more traditional soccer
countries. U.S. women's na
tional team won the inaugu
ral tournament in 1991 and
then as hosts, won both the
inaugural Olympic tourna
ment in Atlanta in 1996 and
the World Cup again at the
end of the decade in 1999.
Women's soccer players be
came national heroes and
household names, far more
famous than their US men's
counterparts over that peri
od: Foudy, Mia Hamm, Kris
tine Lilly, Brandi Chastain,
Michelle Akers and others.
The hype generated by
this success led to the found
ing of the Women's United
Soccer Association in Febru
ary 2000, but three seasons
later, in the week before the
2003 Women's World Cup,
the eight-team WUSA fold
ed. A second attempt was
made in 2009 with the
Women's Professional Soc
cer league, but that too sus
pended operations last year
after just three seasons.
"Professional leagues are
basically what the market
can bear," Foudy said. "It's
hard to create a sustainable
model right now... but I do
think we can get there. I
don't think the model is we
have to look exactly like the

men's professional leagues,
which I think is the mistake
we make. Trying to grow too
big too early[l]."
Hoping to learn from
past mistakes, the third at
tempt to create a women's
professional league in the
U.S. kicks off tomorrow, with
FC Kansas City and Port
land Thorns FC playing in
the inaugural game of the
new, eight-team National
Women's Soccer League.
Former Stanford goalkeeper
Nicole Barnhart 'O4 will fea
ture for Kansas City and de
fender Rachel Buehler 'O7 is
on the Portland team. Stan
ford's presence will also be
felt elsewhere in the league
in Teresa Noyola 'l2 (Seattle
Reign FC), Kelly O'Hara 'lO
(Sky Blue FC), Rachel Quon
'l3 (Chicago Red Stars),
Mariah Nogueira 'l3
(Boston Breakers) and Alina
Garciamendez 'l3 (Washing
ton Spirit).[2]
Foudy believes that the
key to the success of this
new league may be its inten
tion to try to avoid copying
existing professional leagues
too closely.
"There is a model out
there that balances it, where
you can create a really good
product... an entertaining
product and create a really
loyal fan base," Foudy said.
"Maybe it's not 80,000 [fans]
a game, but maybe its
10,000,15,000."
This realization may be a
sign that women's sports are
maturing to the point they
no longer need to try to fash
ion themselves in the image
of their male counterparts.
"People are comparing
women less to men now, and
just appreciating female ath
letes for who they are,"
Walsh Jennings said, "I
think those are really impor
tant trends you can't com
pare apples to oranges.
That's not fair to anybody."

Foudy, Walsh Jennings
and many other ex-Stanford
stars and benefactors of Ti
tle IX have served as impor
tant role models for aspiring
girls, exemplifying what
they can achieve on the field
or court and inspiring them
to dream big.
"When you have that
many kids playing and they
have a chance to finally fol
low a team I never had
that chance [and] have a
chance to finally watch girls
playing the sport in front of
big crowds, that dream sud
denly becomes much more
realistic for them," Foudy
said.
But the future battle
grounds for athletic equality
are no longer in college and
the inspiration that Foudy
and Walsh can give young
girls may, on its own, not be
enough. The challenge now is
to tear down the barriers
that persist in professional
sports and focus the media
spotlight more fairly on
men's and women's athletics.
The question is whether the
Farm can play as key a role
in that as it has in the revolu
tion of college sports [4].
Seeking equality within a
university like Stanford may
be a noble cause, but without
real opportunity in the world
outside, it is not really equal
ity at all.

Equality
without
opportunity,
is not really
equality.
Julie Foudy '93 was just one year old
when the groundbreaking Title IX
equality law, passed in the summer
of 1972, kick-started a revolution in
women's college sports by enforcing a bal
ance between the funding of men's and

women's programs.
Looking back from
the clarity of our posi
tion 40 years later, the
impact of Title IX is ob
vious and striking, but
in Foudy's early child
hood, the implications
of the higher education
equality law on
women's sports were
not clear. The NCAA
claimed its implemen
tation was illegal and
continued to resist its
regulations until the
1981-82 season, when
in a rush it introduced
12 new women's sports,
raising the total num
ber from just two to 14.
Over the past two
weeks, The Daily has
told the story of Title
IX and women's sports
at Stanford, from the
program's history to
the experiences of both
players and coaches.
Foudy's story ex
emplifies how far we

have come. Already a World Cup winner
(1991), she was still unaware of the law's
implications when she received Stanford's
first ever women's soccer scholarship in
her senior year. As women's sports began
to receive a more equal footing, she went
on to win two Olympic gold medals (1996,
2004), another World Cup (1999) and when
she finally hung up her professional boots,
she became a sports broadcaster. Complet
ing the circle, she commentated for ESPN
on Stanford's first NCAA women's soccer
national title in 2011.
But enough of the past, now it's time to

look to the future.
♦ ♦♦
The reality of college sports today is
that memories of life four decades ago
seem distant and hazy. The incessant four
year turnover of athletes and students en
sures this, and all current college stars
grew up long after most of the dust had set
tled on Title IX.
"The interesting thing to me is that the

girls at any school,
for that matter —at
this point, they have no
idea what it was like,"
said Anne Gould '72 MA
'BO, who coached the
Stanford women's ten
nis team from 1976-79.
"You kind of expect a
scholarship, you expect
great coaching, you ex
pect a trainer... it's just
a whole different ball
game."
Current Stanford
women's basketball coach
Tara VanDerVeer agreed
that female athletes to
day have far more op

growing up in the 1950's
and 1960'5.
"[They] play on
teams, travelling teams,
high school teams, go to
basketball camps," Van-
DerVeer said. "It really
is all night and day, and

athlete."
While the war for equality
in college sports seems won,
there are, however, still bat
tles being fought.
In 2002, thirty years after
Title IX was born, the Com
mission on Opportunity in
Athletics was put together to
review its application and ef
fects. It ultimately produced
a report that Foudy, a mem
ber of the panel, was highly
critical of. Together with two
time Olympic gold medalist
swimmer Donna de Varona,
she feared it laid too much
blame on the law for the loss
of men's sports and it would
roll back many of the gains
made in collegiate athletics.
"Universities often used
the excuse of Title IX when
they talked about cutting
programs," Foudy explained.
"[They] didn't want to talk
about the fact that they're
pouring money into pro
grams that maybe aren't
making money, but they're
still going to try to pour mon
ey into them."
The American Sports
Council also unsuccessfully
sued the Department of Edu
cation in 2011 over similar
fears that the enforcement of
quotas in high school could
remove opportunities for
boys to play sports and lead
to the loss of boy's teams.
Beyond the legal enforce
ment of equality in school
sports, though, the media
driven perception of women's
sports still noticeably lags be
hind that of men's, Take, for
example, the case of Stan
ford's two basketball teams.
Every single regular-sea
son Stanford men's game this
year was screened live on tel
evision, but the same cannot
be said of the women's
games. The men's NIT loss
to Alabama in March was
broadcast on ESPN's main
channel, while the women's
clash with then-reigning na
tional champions and No. 1
Baylor in November was
omitted from the television
schedule entirely. And
though the No. 1 vs. No. 2

Connecticut late in Decem

it was relegated to the ESP

Equality
without
opportunity,
is not really
equality.
Julie Foudy '93 was just one year old
when the groundbreaking Title IX
equality law, passed in the summer
of 1972, kick-started a revolution in
women's college sports by enforcing a bal
ance between the funding of men's and

women's programs.
Looking back from
the clarity of our posi
tion 40 years later, the
impact of Title IX is ob
vious and striking, but
in Foudy's early child
hood, the implications
of the higher education
equality law on
women's sports were
not clear. The NCAA
claimed its implemen
tation was illegal and
continued to resist its
regulations until the
1981-82 season, when
in a rush it introduced
12 new women's sports,
raising the total num
ber from just two to 14.
Over the past two
weeks, The Daily has
told the story of Title
IX and women's sports
at Stanford, from the
program's history to
the experiences of both
players and coaches.
Foudy's story ex
emplifies how far we

have come. Already a World Cup winner
(1991), she was still unaware of the law's
implications when she received Stanford's
first ever women's soccer scholarship in
her senior year. As women's sports began
to receive a more equal footing, she went
on to win two Olympic gold medals (1996,
2004), another World Cup (1999) and when
she finally hung up her professional boots,
she became a sports broadcaster. Complet
ing the circle, she commentated for ESPN
on Stanford's first NCAA women's soccer
national title in 2011.
But enough of the past, now it's time to

look to the future.

The reality of college sports today is
that memories of life four decades ago
seem distant and hazy. The incessant four
year turnover of athletes and students en
sures this, and all current college stars
grew up long after most of the dust had set
tled on Title IX.
"The interesting thing to me is that the

girls at any school,
for that matter —at
this point, they have no
idea what it was like,"
said Anne Gould '72 MA
'BO, who coached the
Stanford women's ten
nis team from 1976-79.
"You kind of expect a
scholarship, you expect
great coaching, you ex
pect a trainer... it's just
a whole different ball
game."
Current Stanford
women's basketball coach
Tara VanDerVeer agreed
that female athletes to
day have far more op
portunities that she did
growing up in the 1950's
and 1960'5.
"[They] play on
teams, travelling teams,
high school teams, go to
basketball camps," Van-
DerVeer said. "It really
is all night and day, and
I really would kill to
trade places with any

athlete."
While the war for equality
in college sports seems won,
there are, however, still bat
tles being fought.
In 2002, thirty years after
Title IX was born, the Com
mission on Opportunity in
Athletics was put together to
review its application and ef
fects. It ultimately produced
a report that Foudy, a mem
ber of the panel, was highly
critical of. Together with two
time Olympic gold medalist
swimmer Donna de Varona,
she feared it laid too much
blame on the law for the loss
of men's sports and it would
roll back many of the gains
made in collegiate athletics.
"Universities often used
the excuse of Title IX when
they talked about cutting
programs," Foudy explained.
"[They] didn't want to talk
about the fact that they're
pouring money into pro
grams that maybe aren't
making money, but they're
still going to try to pour mon
ey into them."
The American Sports
Council also unsuccessfully
sued the Department of Edu
cation in 2011 over similar
fears that the enforcement of
quotas in high school could
remove opportunities for
boys to play sports and lead
to the loss of boy's teams.
Beyond the legal enforce
ment of equality in school
sports, though, the media
driven perception of women's
sports still noticeably lags be
hind that of men's, Take, for
example, the case of Stan
ford's two basketball teams.
Every single regular-sea
son Stanford men's game this
year was screened live on tel
evision, but the same cannot
be said of the women's
games. The men's NIT loss
to Alabama in March was
broadcast on ESPN's main
channel, while the women's
clash with then-reigning na
tional champions and No. 1
Baylor in November was
omitted from the television
schedule entirely. And
though the No. 1 vs. No. 2
clash between Stanford and
Connecticut late in Decem
ber was picked up by ESPN,
it was relegated to the ESP
NU channel to make way for
the New Era Pinstripe Bowl
(ESPN) and the Kraft Fight
Hunger Bowl (ESPN2).
♦ ♦♦
Perhaps, though, it is now
time to look beyond both Ti
tle IX and college athletics
and concentrate on profes
sional sports. University var
sity programs help generate
a huge pool of talent, but in
comparison to male athletes,
there exist relatively few op
portunities for female ath
letes to turn their passions
into careers.
The largest professional
women's sports league in the
United States, the 12-team
WNBA, lags considerably
behind the 30-team NBA.
ESPN's new deal with the
WNBA is worth $l2 million a
year; the NBA's current deal
with the same broadcaster is
worth $930 million annually;
$1 million per team compared
to $3l million.
"I think that we're be
hind," VanDerveer said. "The

men's NCAA has been
around for 75 years, we need
more players playing, more
really good players, and more
opportunities for women. I
think [athletic equality for
women] has come a long way,
but probably the media, the
television exposure is an area
[for improvement]."
The WNBA is, though, an
exception to the rule. Stan
ford has had five players
drafted in the first round of
the WNBA draft in the last
five years: Candice Wiggins
'OB (No. 3), Jayne Appel 'lO
(No. 5), Kayla Pedersen 'll
(No. 7), Jeanette Pohlen 'll
(No. 9) and Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike 'l2 (No. 1). Two of those
players already have WNBA
winner's medals Wiggins
(Minnesota Lynx, 2011) and
Pohlen (Indiana Fever, 2012)
and all are virtually guar
anteed to be able to play out
their careers as profession
als. The same cannot be said
of many other women's
sports.

"[Women's success at the
collegiate level] has to trans
late a little better to some of
the other professional
leagues," said Stanford ten
nis head coach Lele Forood
'7B. "Unfortunately, the soc
cer league can't seem to stay
afloat. So I guess that would
be the next wave, where it
can translate."
In the 19905, women's
soccer had unparalleled suc
cess in the USA, in stark
contrast to its standing in
more traditional soccer
countries. U.S. women's na
tional team won the inaugu
ral tournament in 1991 and
then as hosts, won both the
inaugural Olympic tourna
ment in Atlanta in 1996 and
the World Cup again at the
end of the decade in 1999.
Women's soccer players be
came national heroes and
household names, far more
famous than their US men's
counterparts over that peri
od: Foudy, Mia Hamm, Kris
tine Lilly, Brandi Chastain,
Michelle Akers and others.
The hype generated by
this success led to the found
ing of the Women's United
Soccer Association in Febru
ary 2000, but three seasons
later, in the week before the
2003 Women's World Cup,
the eight-team WUSA fold
ed. A second attempt was
made in 2009 with the
Women's Professional Soc
cer league, but that too sus
pended operations last year
after just three seasons.
"Professional leagues are
basically what the market
can bear," Foudy said. "It's
hard to create a sustainable
model right now... but I do
think we can get there. I
don't think the model is we
have to look exactly like the

men's professional leagues,
which I think is the mistake
we make. Trying to grow too
big too early[l]."
Hoping to learn from
past mistakes, the third at
tempt to create a women's
professional league in the
U.S. kicks off tomorrow, with
FC Kansas City and Port
land Thorns FC playing in
the inaugural game of the
new, eight-team National
Women's Soccer League.
Former Stanford goalkeeper
Nicole Barnhart 'O4 will fea
ture for Kansas City and de
fender Rachel Buehler 'O7 is
on the Portland team. Stan
ford's presence will also be
felt elsewhere in the league
in Teresa Noyola 'l2 (Seattle
Reign FC), Kelly O'Hara 'lO
(Sky Blue FC), Rachel Quon
'l3 (Chicago Red Stars),
Mariah Nogueira 'l3
(Boston Breakers) and Alina
Garciamendez 'l3 (Washing
ton Spirit).[2]
Foudy believes that the
key to the success of this
new league may be its inten
tion to try to avoid copying
existing professional leagues
too closely.
"There is a model out
there that balances it, where
you can create a really good
product... an entertaining
product and create a really
loyal fan base," Foudy said.
"Maybe it's not 80,000 [fans]
a game, but maybe its
10,000,15,000."
This realization may be a
sign that women's sports are
maturing to the point they
no longer need to try to fash
ion themselves in the image
of their male counterparts.
"People are comparing
women less to men now, and
just appreciating female ath
letes for who they are,"
Walsh Jennings said, "I
think those are really impor
tant trends you can't com
pare apples to oranges.
That's not fair to anybody."
