# WOMEN'S SPORTS FEATURE SERIES
## BEYOND TITLE IX 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Julie Foudy '93 was just one year old
when the groundbreaking Title IX
equality law, passed in the summer
of 1972, kick-started a revolution in
women's college sports by enforcing a bal
ance between the funding of men's and

women's programs.
Looking back from
the clarity of our posi
tion 40 years later, the
impact of Title IX is ob
vious and striking, but
in Foudy's early child
hood, the implications
of the higher education
equality law on
women's sports were
not clear. The NCAA
claimed its implemen
tation was illegal and
continued to resist its
regulations until the
1981-82 season, when
in a rush it introduced
12 new women's sports,
raising the total num
ber from just two to 14.
Over the past two
weeks, The Daily has
told the story of Title
IX and women's sports
at Stanford, from the
program's history to
the experiences of both
players and coaches.
Foudy's story ex
emplifies how far we

have come. Already a World Cup winner
(1991), she was still unaware of the law's
implications when she received Stanford's
first ever women's soccer scholarship in
her senior year. As women's sports began
to receive a more equal footing, she went
on to win two Olympic gold medals (1996,
2004), another World Cup (1999) and when
she finally hung up her professional boots,
she became a sports broadcaster. Complet
ing the circle, she commentated for ESPN
on Stanford's first NCAA women's soccer
national title in 2011.
But enough of the past, now it's time to

look to the future.

The reality of college sports today is
that memories of life four decades ago
seem distant and hazy. The incessant four
year turnover of athletes and students en
sures this, and all current college stars
grew up long after most of the dust had set
tled on Title IX.
"The interesting thing to me is that the

girls at any school,
for that matter —at
this point, they have no
idea what it was like,"
said Anne Gould '72 MA
'BO, who coached the
Stanford women's ten
nis team from 1976-79.
"You kind of expect a
scholarship, you expect
great coaching, you ex
pect a trainer... it's just
a whole different ball
game."
Current Stanford
women's basketball coach
Tara VanDerVeer agreed
that female athletes to
day have far more op
portunities that she did
growing up in the 1950's
and 1960'5.
"[They] play on
teams, travelling teams,
high school teams, go to
basketball camps," Van-
DerVeer said. "It really
is all night and day, and
I really would kill to
trade places with any

one of [my players]."
Growing up in the post-Title IX era,
Olympic beach volleyball triple-gold medal
ist Kerri Walsh Jennings 'OO never even
had to face the prejudices and lack of op
portunity characteristic of previous gener
ations.
"I had every single door opened for me,
I think very much so because of Title IX, the
house I was raised in and the situations I was
presented with," Walsh Jennings said. "I just
consider myself an athlete, not a female
