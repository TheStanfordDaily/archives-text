# CRUSHIN' HARD
## A 						talk with the creator of Stanford Crushes 
### Katharine Schwab | STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Crushes is the slightly over
eager younger sibling of Stanford
Confessions. The page on which posts
vary from sincere declarations of interest to
shout-outs to praises directed toward vodka and
chocolate has over 870 likes and 890 posts
with more than 100 crushes waiting to be posted.
Spurred on initially by the freshman class, there
are about 35 crushes submitted every day.
Crushes target students across all four classes and
even some grad students. When Intermission sat
down with the student behind Stanford Crushes,
it became clear that, while some may dismiss the
page as utterly juvenile and unworthy of their
time, it has brought a little bit of happiness to
one student amidst the sorrow of heartbreak.
Intermission (INT): Why did you decide to
start Stanford Crushes?
Stanford Crushes (SC): I saw how quickly
Stanford Confessions was growing and I noticed
that other schools had not only confessions pages
but crush pages. So I thought, why not start one
for Stanford? I went through a really hard
breakup last quarter, so I thought that not only
would this feed the fad and be an interesting
thing for the school to do, but it would also be
nice to see what romantic secrets people have
here. It's given me a little bit of joy among a lot of
sadness that I was going through last quarter.
INT : What has been the reaction amongst the
students?
SC: For a lot of people, it's been nice to see their
names on there and know that someone is inter

ested in them that way. I think it's a good ego- or
morale-booster. I know that some people were
feeling brought down by it and felt like it was
attacking their own insecurities, but it's for enter
tainment more than anything. Ultimately it's just
for laughs. I don't want it to be taken too seri
ously.
INT: Do you think the posts themselves are gen
uine?
SC: A lot of them are silly or funny, but some are
pretty sincere and I like those a lot. I secretly root
for those people.

INT: The submissions are anonymous, but have
you noticed any trends in demographics?
SC: I think that when guys get posted about it's
usually their guy friends posting about them.
Generally the sweeter and more sincere posts are
those aimed at girls. I also know that a lot people
have been left sad because their crushes went
abroad.
INT: Do you ever reach out to your users?
SC: I like to interact with my users sometimes.
One time I was being encouraging, saying, "Just

talk to them! It's not hard, just one conversation
can do it." That's what happened to me. If my
friend hadn't pushed me to take the initiative to
send my ex a message on Facebook, we never
would have dated. Just put yourself out there.
You never know and there's nothing to lose.
INT: Do your friends know about your role as
moderator of Stanford Crushes?
SC: Less than 10 people know, and I only tell
people I know won't tell anyone else. My room
mate doesn't even know.
INT: What have been your friends' reac
tions?
SC: It's always an interesting reaction. One
friend fell to the floor and started laughing.
INT: Have you ever commented as yourself?
SC: When I first started the page, I'd see my
friends and like the posts. But Stanford Crushes
isn't supposed to like that because Stanford
Crushes doesn't know you! I have to wait half an
hour and then like it as myself.
INT: What's your opinion of Stanford
Confessions?
SC: I love Stanford Confessions. I think that it's a
very useful social dialogue. It has hugely exposed
how deep and prevalent the duck syndrome is
here and how a lot of people are going through
so much and nobody knows. That spoke a lot to

me when I first started
Stanford Crushes because I was
going through a very hard
time. You can't really talk to
anyone about it here unless you
are really close friends with
them. You are expected to look
happy, but I feel like it's a little
contrived. I think that Stanford
Confessions has brought a lot
of that to light and that's a
good thing. It's brought up a
lot of important conversations
among the student body. It's
serving a really good purpose
here.
INT : Do you think the page
contributes to low self-esteem?
SC: I'm Stanford Crushes and
whenever I'm going through
the long email thread on
last.fm I look to see if my name
is there, and I still haven't been
named. I don't take it personal
ly. Maybe I'll be named eventu

ally and maybe not, but that's
ok. I posted a little paragraph
to all the users recentiy and I
told them that what really mat
ters is what the people around
you think, what your friends
think. It's just Stanford
Crushes. If somebody is meant
for you they will see everything
that's special about you. It will
be clear to them. We're at
Stanford. We're all very differ
ent, and we all have something
special that brought us here. If
you are named on there then
that's great. If you're not, it
shouldn't matter. What really
matters is what the people you
love think about you. It should
be necessary to have your name
anonymously posted on a
Facebook page to remember
that.
INT: What is your opinion of
the Stanford dating scene?

SC: I personally don't like it. I
think that our hookup culture
is far too prevalent. It seems as
if most people don't like the
hookup culture but nobody
really does anything to make it
go away. If you do anything
that isn't just hooking up then
people automatically assume
you are in a relationship. You
go to dinner with someone,
and it's like, oh, they're together
now. Why is there no in-

between? Why is there no casu
al dating at this school?
INT : What do you hope to
accomplish with Stanford
Crushes?
SC: It's mainly entertainment.
I have no intention to be a
matchmaker but if one person
finds a connection I think that
would be a great story. That
would be enough for me to be
happy.
