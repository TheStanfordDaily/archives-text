## Spring Awakening brings a twist to Stanford theater 
### Katharine Schwab | STAFF WRITER 
f ■ weekend, Ram's Head pres
ents "Spring Awakening," a
.A. rebellious rock musical that
packs an emotional punch. Based on
the 1891 play, "Spring Awakening" fol
lows young adolescents as they struggle
to reconcile their emerging sexuality
within the contexts of authoritarian
parental and academic pressure in a
small German town. The musical, in
which the play's monologues and intel
lectual discourses are transformed into
emotionally-driven rock numbers and
ballads, follows Wendla, Melchior and
Moritz, three youths as they begin the
sexual-awakening transition from
childhood to adulthood.
The Broadway show won eight
Tonies, and licensing rights were
recently released. Director Brendon
Martin 'l3, who has spent two years
thinking about and working on the
production, believes that its thematic
content will resonate deeply with a col
lege audience.

"We're interested in using this as a
way to create conversation about
themes that the play brings up, not just

something to absorb as entertain
ment," Martin said. "I think the show
gives something to everyone across the

board."
"It's about youth culture and
rebellion," he added. "It's about sexual

awakening. It's about academic pres
sure. It's about a lot of things that really
resonate on a college campus. It's an f

you to the establishment, in away. It's
about people learning their way in the
world."
"Spring Awakening," which dis
cusses issues such as sexual abuse, sui
cide and abortion, has partnered with
the Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center (SHPRC), the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center and the Bay Area
Youth Summit, a local LGBT organiza
tion, all of which will have tables set up
during intermission.
Artistically, Martin s vision for
this production accommodates the
show's recent Broadway run by recog
nizing that "Spring Awakening" at
Stanford is a different beast entirely.
While the original occurs in a
small, intimate space (audience mem
bers even sit on stage), Memorial
Auditorium makes this kind of intima
cy impossible. The show's striking and
memorable set design by Annie
Dauber 'l3 embraces a different aes
thetic. The set is based on an aban-

doned church, complete with
stained-glass rose window. The
church represents the establish
ment, and the set's grandeur
and openness become oppres
sive and daunting, paralleling
the thematic oppression of the
characters. The actors move
pew-like wooden benches to
create each scene, revealing
their characters' attempts to
manipulate and appropriate an
institutional space for their own
expression.
"Spring Awakening" is also
reimagined through its inven
tive choreography, meant to
cater to the larger space and the
expanded cast. Jamie Yuen-
Shore 'l3 uses precise move
ment to effectively enhance the
music's emotive power and
supplement character develop
ment. Stars Arianna Vogel 'l4,
graduate student Buddy

Garineer and James Seifert 'l5
lead an extraordinarily talented
cast, skillfully navigating
between raw, emotionally heavy
scenes and scenes of irreverence
and rebellion.
This is a production that
all Stanford students should see.
Beyond being musically and
emotionally rich and visually
stunning, "Spring Awakening"
is intimately relevant to the
pressures we face as young
adults beginning to navigate the
world. And if you don't go for
the German teenage angst, go
for the sex. In the words of pro
ducer Brandon Powell 'l4,
"People who like musicals love
this show, and people who
don't like musicals love this
show. It's not a standard musi
cal: there's a rock band and they
say 'fuck' and they sing 'blah'
and they have sex on stage."
