## Spring Awakening brings a twist to Stanford theater 
### Katharine Schwab | STAFF WRITER 
f â–  weekend, Ram's Head pres
ents "Spring Awakening," a
.A. rebellious rock musical that
packs an emotional punch. Based on
the 1891 play, "Spring Awakening" fol
lows young adolescents as they struggle
to reconcile their emerging sexuality
within the contexts of authoritarian
parental and academic pressure in a
small German town. The musical, in
which the play's monologues and intel
lectual discourses are transformed into
emotionally-driven rock numbers and
ballads, follows Wendla, Melchior and
Moritz, three youths as they begin the
sexual-awakening transition from
childhood to adulthood.
The Broadway show won eight
Tonies, and licensing rights were
recently released. Director Brendon
Martin 'l3, who has spent two years
thinking about and working on the
production, believes that its thematic
content will resonate deeply with a col

"We're interested in using this as a
way to create conversation about
themes that the play brings up, not just

something to absorb as entertain
ment," Martin said. "I think the show
gives something to everyone across the

board."
"It's about youth culture and
rebellion," he added. "It's about sexual

awakening. It's about academic pres
sure. It's about a lot of things that really
resonate on a college campus. It's an f

you to the establishment, in away. It's
about people learning their way in the
world."
"Spring Awakening," which dis
cusses issues such as sexual abuse, sui
cide and abortion, has partnered with
the Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center (SHPRC), the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center and the Bay Area
Youth Summit, a local LGBT organiza
tion, all of which will have tables set up
during intermission.
Artistically, Martin s vision for
this production accommodates the
show's recent Broadway run by recog
nizing that "Spring Awakening" at
Stanford is a different beast entirely.
While the original occurs in a
small, intimate space (audience mem
bers even sit on stage), Memorial
Auditorium makes this kind of intima
cy impossible. The show's striking and
memorable set design by Annie
Dauber 'l3 embraces a different aes
thetic. The set is based on an aban-
