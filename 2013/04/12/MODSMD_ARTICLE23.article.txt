## SFIFF INTERMISSION TAKES A LOOK AT WHAT TO CATCH DURING THE TWO-WEEK FESTIVAL 
### Alexandra Heeney | STAFF WRITER 
The 56th Annual San
Francisco
International Film
Festival (SFIFF), which
runs from April 25 to May 9,
mainly in Japantown at the
Sundance Kabuki and New
People Cinema, is already
shaping up to be a very excit-

ing couple of weeks. The festi
val plays host to 151 films
from 51 countries and in 31
different languages. One of
the great pleasures of attend
ing SFIFF is getting to see
these films the way they were
meant to be seen on a big
screen, in digital projection

since many won't get a wide
release, and those that do may
play only briefly at smaller
cinemas like the Embarcadero
Cinema or Opera Plaza
Cinemas, as well as sample
films from all over the world
all in one day.
Although SFIFF is at the

end of the film season
(Cannes is right on its tails) it
distinguishes itself with excel
lent live onstage events that
feature extended lectures or
Q&As with directors and
allow the artists to have in
depth discussions about their
work a rarity at festivals,
where Q&As are often rushed.
Steven Soderbergh is set
to give the State of Cinema
address on April 27 at the
Sundance Kabuki. SFIFF could
not have picked a better per
son for the job: he is a pioneer
of digital cinema, someone
who has successfully straddled

the line between Hollywood
and independent filmmaking,
and a man who is retiring
(hopefully temporarily) from
film in part because he's fed
up with where the business is
going.
The great indie director
Richard Linklater will also be
on hand at the film festival for
a live onstage event with Julie
Delpy at the Sundance Kabuki
on May 8 to discuss their lat
est film in the "Before
Sunrise" and "Before Sunset"
series "Before Midnight"
"which received rave
reviews at Sundance. "Before
Midnight" is a much-antici
pated film for fans of the
series, who first met Jesse
(Ethan Hawke) and Celine
(Delpy) in "Before Sunrise"
when they got off a train in
Vienna together and spent the
night walking and talking, met
up again in "Before Sunset"
nine years later, and are back
now nine years after that in
"Before Midnight." "Before
Midnight" will screen as the
Closing Night film at the
Castro Theatre on May 9. The
film will be followed by a cele
bration party; tickets for both
are available online.
Every year the festival
honors a director with the
"Founder's Director Award."
Past inductees include Kenneth
Branagh and Werner Herzog,
and this year the honor will go
to writer-director Philip
Kauffnan. Kauffnan will be
present for an extended Q&A at
the Castro Theatre followed by

a screening of his film "Invasion
of the Body Snatchers."
SFIFF tradition also fea
tures live music for silent
films. Mike Patton, Scott
Amendola, Matthias Bossi and
William Winant present a new
score for the German expres
sionist classic "Waxworks" live
onstage at the Castro Theatre
on May 7. Rick Prelinger also
presents his latest film "No
More Road Trips?" a silent
documentary featuring home
movie footage of road trips
from coast to coast in the U.S.
with a soundtrack to be
created by the audience dur
ing the screening.
The festival's regular
screenings include Sarah
Polley's fantastic documentary
"Stories We Tell" about her
search for her biological
father, an extremely personal
journey which is just as much
a fascinating exploration of
how we construct the stories
of our lives as it is a personal
revelation. Polley is expected
to be in attendance at the fes
tival. Olivier Assayas'
"Something in the Air," a love
ly portrait of misguided,
youthful protesting in Paris in
the '7os, will also screen at the
festival, as will the much
awaited Jack Kerouac adapta
tion "Big Sur," Noah
Baumbach's latest film,
"Frances Fla," and the new
Iranian film starring Leila
Flatami of "A Separation" and
"The Last Step." All in all, it
looks like it will be an excep
tionally good festival this year.
