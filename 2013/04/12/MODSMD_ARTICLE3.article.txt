### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Due to student complaints, the
developers of the iStanford app will
withdraw the recently updated
product on April 15, with a plan to
re-release the app in several months
after further adjustments.
The newest version of iStanford,
which launched on April 1, is cur
rently available on both the iPhone
and the iPad. The update revamped
major features like the maps, cours
es and athletics components, and al
lowed software developers to "soft
launch" their apps in iStanford be

fore sending them to the App Store.
Andrew Bellay M.S. 'll, one of
the developers of the new iStanford
platform, said that, although the de
velopment team wanted to maintain
functionality, they also focused on in
corporating "the next wave of inno
vation" in the platform's redesign.
"We have this idea of, 'Let's take
iStanford and give it back to stu
dents,"' Bellay said. "I expect that
over time the whole app will be con
trolled by students. What I know is
that we need to get out of the way."
Since the original iStanford app
was launched five years ago, the app
has undergone several rounds of

renovation, growing from four tiles
to 28 with the addition of functions
that, among other Stanford-specific
tasks, allow students to change their
class schedule online and check the
Marguerite bus schedule.
The developers of the new iStan
ford platform organized a focus
group about the old app and found
that many students were unsatisfied
with certain features.
"There was universal agreement
that there were unmet needs from
the old platform," said James
Mwaura 'l3, marketing director at
