## iStanford developers rescind upgrade 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Due to student complaints, the
developers of the iStanford app will
withdraw the recently updated
product on April 15, with a plan to
re-release the app in several months
after further adjustments.
The newest version of iStanford,
which launched on April 1, is cur
rently available on both the iPhone
and the iPad. The update revamped
major features like the maps, cours
es and athletics components, and al
lowed software developers to "soft
launch" their apps in iStanford be

fore sending them to the App Store.
Andrew Bellay M.S. 'll, one of
the developers of the new iStanford
platform, said that, although the de
velopment team wanted to maintain
functionality, they also focused on in
corporating "the next wave of inno
vation" in the platform's redesign.
"We have this idea of, 'Let's take
iStanford and give it back to stu
dents,"' Bellay said. "I expect that
over time the whole app will be con
trolled by students. What I know is
that we need to get out of the way."
Since the original iStanford app
was launched five years ago, the app
has undergone several rounds of

renovation, growing from four tiles
to 28 with the addition of functions
that, among other Stanford-specific
tasks, allow students to change their
class schedule online and check the
Marguerite bus schedule.
The developers of the new iStan
ford platform organized a focus
group about the old app and found
that many students were unsatisfied
with certain features.
"There was universal agreement
that there were unmet needs from
the old platform," said James
Mwaura 'l3, marketing director at


Courtesy of Andrew Bel lay
iStanford. "For example, the
map was outdated and you
couldn't zoom in correctly The
event feature just wasn't as
useful as it was supposed to
be."

In order to fix the flaws of
the older version and give stu
dents greater control over
their experience with the app,
the iStanford team launched
the redesigned version.

"We want to let the stu
dents control the app," Mwau
ra said. "We want the students
to be able to recognize what
they need and what needs to
be fixed and to be able to just
fix it."

By the end of last week,
20,000 users had already
downloaded the updated app,
according to Bellay While the
developers received positive
feedback about the new
graphical user interface, some
students complained about the
loss of several functions from
the old version of iStanford.

"The biggest problem that

we made was including a map
with limited functionality in
that you couldn't search,"
Mwaura said. "For example,
we just had many kids email
ing us saying that we wished
we had a better map [because]
we were lost right now"

Some students were also
confused by the interface's
new blue color scheme, a color
traditionally associated with
the University of California,
Berkeley.
After soliciting feedback
from students, the iStanford
team decided to pull back the
new version of iStanford while
they polish the features of the
platform.
"Right now there is a little
bit of a sting from [the new
platform]," Bellay said. "The
app has to take half a step
backwards, so that in the next
three months we can leap for
ward."

The team is also rolling out
the iStanford Developers
Club, which allows developers
to launch their self-designed
apps on the iStanford plat
form.

According to Mwaura, the
club will be fully launched in
six to 12 months, and the

club's developers will "have
their own space and their own
resources to form an unofficial
pipeline to the developers'
page."

While the concept of the
Developers Club is still fresh,
some developers have already
expressed enthusiasm about
the ability to have their apps
featured on iStanford.

Anda Gansca 'll, co
founder of Knotch, an app that
allows users to share with
friends their opinions on topics
ranging from TV shows to air
lines, said that she looks for
ward to seeing her app on the
new platform.
"We were incredibly excit
ed to know that we can finally
bring Knotch to the Stanford
campus in a more formal way,"
Gansca wrote in a statement
to The Daily. "There are a ton
of consumer startups similar
to us who really want to have
access to the Stanford campus
and become the next campus
app and iStanford is an amaz
ing platform to enable that so
we're veiy grateful to be part
of it."
