## Researchers interpret climate change survey 
### ALICIA HAMAR 
According to a recent survey conducted by
the Woods Institute for the Environment in col
laboration with the Center for Ocean Solutions,
a majority of Americans are in favor of prepar
ing for climate change but less than half of
those surveyed want the government to pay for
it.
Professor of Communication and Political
Science Jon Krosnick directed the survey, which
was the first in-depth study of American atti
tudes about climate change.
The survey collected 1,174 responses online
impact them before taking ac
tion.

"The results suggest that
Americans are very support
ive of preparing for the ef
fects of sea level rise and
storms likely to be induced by
climate change," Krosnick
said. "The least support ap
peared for policy approaches
that involved trying to fight
Mother Nature, building con
crete walls or putting more
and more sand along the
coastline to keep the oceans
back."

through the Knowledge Net
work platform in March 2013.
Separate survey results for
respondents in New York and
California will be released in
the near future, as the re
searchers purposefully over
sampled these areas in order
to more closely analyze the re
sults.

people and businesses along
the coasts rather than in
creasing everyone's taxes."
According to Rrosnick, an
other important part of the
survey examined how scien
tists communicate then* find
ings. He noted that scientists
are often asked to "predict
the future," and can be hesi
tant to discuss the uncertain
ty regarding the possible ef
fects of climate change.

According to Lauren
Howe Ph.D. 'l7, who was in
volved in creating the survey
questions, the survey's main
purpose was to gain a better
understanding of the level of
public support for adapta
tion policies in dealing with
climate change.
"Traditionally, when peo
ple think about global warm
ing, they think, 'Okay we
need to reduce greenhouse
gases, what can we do to re
duce emissions?'" Howe
said. "The way the scientific
community is starting to
think about things is, 'Okay
we need to prepare for what
we know is going to hap
pen.'"

The majority of the survey
respondents 62 percent
said that building codes
should be strengthened for
coastal structures, while 52
percent wanted to enact
measures preventing new
construction on the coast.
The results also reveal
that 82 percent of Americans
are supportive of preparing
for the effects of sea-level rise
and storms, but only 38 per
cent believe that the govern
ment should pay for it. Sixty
percent said that people living
or running businesses along
the coastline should be re
sponsible for funding prepa
ration efforts.

Howe said that the re
searchers found that a scien
tific acknowledgment of the
lack of precise data "enhances
people's trust in scientists
and support for adaptation
policy," as long as the uncer
tainty is within established
boundaries.

For example, the re
searchers found that scien
tists would likely elicit a posi
tive response for providing a
range of numbers that the sea
levels could rise by, but would
receive a more negative re
sponse by admitting that they
don't know how damaging a
potential storm could be.
"There is psychological re
search suggesting that people
can be overwhelmed with the
extent of fear you can create
from a message," Krosnick

Seventy-three percent of
survey respondents predict
ed that a future rise in the
sea level will be a serious
problem, and only 16 percent
of the public said they would
want to wait until the effects
of climate change directly

"If they choose to be [on
the coastline], they choose to
place themselves in harm's
way," Krosnick said. "The
message from the survey is
that after the government
does this work, the govern
ment should pay for it by in
creasing the property taxes of

said. "If you phrase it in too
threatening of away, people's
defenses kick in and they
don't respond positively to it."
Adina Abeles, director of
education at the Center for
Ocean Solutions, also worked
closely with the Woods Insti
tute to write survey ques
tions. One of Abeles' areas
of focus was "soft engineer
ing approaches" to rising sea
levels, such as using natural
habitats to protect the coast
line.

Although this survey is on
ly the start of measuring atti
tudes with regards to adapta
tion changes, Abeles was opti
mistic about the responses
that the researchers received.

"People really are willing
and interested in preparing
for a future with climate
change, and I think that re
flects other results from dif
ferent surveys that are show
ing that people are more
aware generally about cli
mate change and its impact,"
she said. "I think we're notic
ing a good shift in how the
public is thinking about cli
mate change."
