According to a recent survey conducted by
the Woods Institute for the Environment in col
laboration with the Center for Ocean Solutions,
a majority of Americans are in favor of prepar
ing for climate change but less than half of
those surveyed want the government to pay for
it.
Professor of Communication and Political
Science Jon Krosnick directed the survey, which
was the first in-depth study of American atti
tudes about climate change.
The survey collected 1,174 responses online
