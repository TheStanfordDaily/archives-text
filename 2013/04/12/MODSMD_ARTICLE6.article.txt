# Philanthropy class to donate $100,000
## PoliSci 236 students will give money by end of spring

PoliSci 236: Theories of Civil Society, Phi
lanthropy, and the Nonprofit Sector has al
ways taught its students about the nature
and challenges of donating money. Only re
cently, however, have these students been
able to learn through real philanthropic ex
perience.

For the second year- in a row, the class will
give away $lOO,OOO by the end of the quarter.
The Once Upon a Time Foundation in Foit
Worth, Texas, provided funds to this class
and to similar 1 ones at other universities such
as Yale, Princeton and the University of
Pennsylvania â€”to enable undergraduate
and graduate students to gain firsthand in
sight into the progress of giving money.
Visiting Scholar and Lecturer Bruce
Sievers has taught the course for 10 years,
instructing students on the history, nature
and challenges of the nonprofit sector and
philanthropy. Sievers said that the donation
process is far more difficult than students ini
tially imagine.

"What many people find is that it's more
of a challenge to give money away than you
might anticipate because resources in almost
all the fields that nonprofits work in are very
scarce," Sievers said. "Students quickly real
ize what a delicate responsibility it is to be
charged with that decision-making but to be
working in areas that they may be less
knowledgeable in than the people receiving
the money."

The Once Upon a Time Foundation's
grant comes to Stanford through the Center
on Philanthropy and Civil Society (PACS),
with the course instructor deciding how he or
she will incorporate the funds into the cur
riculum.

Last year, Sievers divided students into
four teams with different philanthropic fo
cuses. The teams sent out a Request for Pro
posal to nonprofits that align with their
group's interests, interviewed responding
nonprofits and donated money to between up
to three organizations.
