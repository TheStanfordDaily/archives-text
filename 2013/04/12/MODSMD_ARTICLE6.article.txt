# Philanthropy class to donate $100,000
## PoliSci 236 students will give money by end of spring 
### SARAH MOORE 
PoliSci 236: Theories of Civil Society, Phi
lanthropy, and the Nonprofit Sector has al
ways taught its students about the nature
and challenges of donating money. Only re
cently, however, have these students been
able to learn through real philanthropic ex
perience.

For the second year- in a row, the class will
give away $lOO,OOO by the end of the quarter.
The Once Upon a Time Foundation in Foit
Worth, Texas, provided funds to this class
and to similar 1 ones at other universities such
as Yale, Princeton and the University of
Pennsylvania â€”to enable undergraduate
and graduate students to gain firsthand in
sight into the progress of giving money.
Visiting Scholar and Lecturer Bruce
Sievers has taught the course for 10 years,
instructing students on the history, nature
and challenges of the nonprofit sector and
philanthropy. Sievers said that the donation
process is far more difficult than students ini
tially imagine.

"What many people find is that it's more
of a challenge to give money away than you
might anticipate because resources in almost
all the fields that nonprofits work in are very
scarce," Sievers said. "Students quickly real
ize what a delicate responsibility it is to be
charged with that decision-making but to be
working in areas that they may be less
knowledgeable in than the people receiving
the money."

The Once Upon a Time Foundation's
grant comes to Stanford through the Center
on Philanthropy and Civil Society (PACS),
with the course instructor deciding how he or
she will incorporate the funds into the cur
riculum.

Last year, Sievers divided students into
four teams with different philanthropic fo
cuses. The teams sent out a Request for Pro
posal to nonprofits that align with their
group's interests, interviewed responding
nonprofits and donated money to between up
to three organizations.
Throughout the quarter,
students apply some of the
broader knowledge gained in
class about philanthropy and
civil society in weekly sec
tions, where they do most of
the work determining which
organizations they will choose
for their donations. This
year's team topics are educa
tion, environment, interna
tional development and policy
advocacy.
Sara Conklin, who took
PoliSci 236 last year as a
graduate student, credited
the class and the skills she
learned with helping her to
obtain her current job at the
Human Rights Council in
Washington, D.C. She specifi
cally cited the experience she
gained working with a board
of directors, grant-making
and fundraising.
"The grant-making process
is so time-consuming, but it

was set up really perfectly for
spring quarter for us to be
able to have a really nice pro
gression and enabled us to
feel really confident when we
were allocating our funds that
we had taken all the neces
sary measures to make these
grants to organizations which
we were proud of and to
which we were committed,"
Conklin said.
Conklin said she was sur
prised by how intimately and
independently students were
allowed to work with the or
ganizations.
"Being entrusted with
that amount of money was
huge and it was a crazy pow
er dynamic," she said, "be
cause all of a sudden you are
being entrusted with all the
small details that make up a
nonprofit organization and
you're on the other side when
usually students are the ones
volunteering."
Sievers said that this expe
riential approach to learning
about philanthropy stresses
not just the impact but also the
strategy of giving.

"Also, there are these
larger questions of strate
gy," Sievers said. "What are
you trying to accomplish
with this money? Are you
trying to allocate it to some
thing you think is important?
Are you looking strategical
ly, asking where you can get
the most bang for your
buck?"

According to Kim Mered
ith, executive director of
PACS, classes like PoliSci 236
are particularly important in
the current economic cli
mate.
"The value of individual
philanthropy becomes even
more valuable because there
are less dollars of govern
ment and people are more
mindful and the strategic
value is really critical,"
Meredith said. "Teaching
good philanthropy and
grant-making can have a
broader effect than simple
charity-giving because it influ
ences systemic change."
