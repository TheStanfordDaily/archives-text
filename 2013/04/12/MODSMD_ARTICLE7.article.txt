## Media and Microtext Center offers extensive collections

Hidden away in the basement of Green
Library's East Wing, Stanford's Media and
Microtext Center's treasure trove of audio
visual and microfilm resources offers stu
dents and faculty opportunities for research,
gaming and plenty in between.
According to Laszlo Jakusovszky, the cen
ter's operations manager, between a dozen
and 200 students visit the center each day,
with demand surging mid-quarter and dur
ing finals season as students do research for
papers. Students from the film and language
departments, in particular, have access to a
wealth of materials on reserve every quarter
for required or suggested viewings.
Beyond its academic function, however,
the popular conception of the center is that of
a free video-rental collection from which stu
dents can check out recent films for a three
day period. That collection, which includes
formats as dated as VHS and as recent as
Blu-Ray, recently reached the milestone of

having 30,000 DVDs in its collection, a num
ber that according to Jakusovszky —is
growing exponentially
Molly Weigent-Hayes '97, who has cumu
latively worked for 10 years at the center
starting in her undergraduate years at Stan
ford also vouched for the film collection's
growth.
"It used to take three months to fill a shelf
range, and now we fill a whole bookshelf in a
week," Weigent-Hayes said. "We get films
from all over the world and I think that's re
ally great for the foreign population at Stan
ford."
This abundance of resources is not lost on
students using the center.
"I have only ever once looked for a film
they didn't have, so their selection is pretty
good," said Samuel Gibson Ph.D. 'l3.
Even so, many of the center's additional
features such as their microprint collec
tion, video game console area and VHS, DVD
and Blu-Ray viewing stations remain
