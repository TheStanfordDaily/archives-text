## Media and Microtext Center offers extensive collections

Hidden away in the basement of Green
Library's East Wing, Stanford's Media and
Microtext Center's treasure trove of audio
visual and microfilm resources offers stu
dents and faculty opportunities for research,
gaming and plenty in between.
According to Laszlo Jakusovszky, the cen
ter's operations manager, between a dozen
and 200 students visit the center each day,
with demand surging mid-quarter and dur
ing finals season as students do research for
papers. Students from the film and language
departments, in particular, have access to a
wealth of materials on reserve every quarter
for required or suggested viewings.
Beyond its academic function, however,
the popular conception of the center is that of
a free video-rental collection from which stu
dents can check out recent films for a three
day period. That collection, which includes
formats as dated as VHS and as recent as
Blu-Ray, recently reached the milestone of

having 30,000 DVDs in its collection, a num
ber that according to Jakusovszky —is
growing exponentially
Molly Weigent-Hayes '97, who has cumu
latively worked for 10 years at the center
starting in her undergraduate years at Stan
ford also vouched for the film collection's
growth.
"It used to take three months to fill a shelf
range, and now we fill a whole bookshelf in a
week," Weigent-Hayes said. "We get films
from all over the world and I think that's re
ally great for the foreign population at Stan
ford."
This abundance of resources is not lost on
students using the center.
"I have only ever once looked for a film
they didn't have, so their selection is pretty
good," said Samuel Gibson Ph.D. 'l3.
Even so, many of the center's additional
features such as their microprint collec
tion, video game console area and VHS, DVD
and Blu-Ray viewing stations remain
largely unknown to students.
Hayden Rodarte 'l3, who
works at the center, attributed
that low profile to the center's
hidden location.

"If you don't take a library
tour or hear about it from
someone, you won't know it ex
ists — unless you come here
for a class or something," Hay
den said.

Jakusovszky also noted the
increased use of the video game
area which includes Xbox
3605, Play Station 2s and Nin
tendo Game Cubes —by pro
fessors.

"Gaming is one of these ar
eas which is becoming a schol
arly pursuit too," Jakusovszky
said. "We've had classes come
in and actually demonstrate

video games to the class."
Hope Burke 'l4 said that
she initially used only the movie
portion of the center. In her
current position as a research
assistant for a history profes
sor, however, she will be spend
ing several hours a week for the
next three weeks examining
microfilm.

"Most people use the center
just for the movies, for enter
tainment," she said. "But once
you see the other side of it, you
see how valuable it is."

"They have so many micro
films that you could never
imagine them having I wish
more people knew how valuable
they were as an academic re
source," Burke added.
Jakusovszky noted that fac
ulty members also conduct a lot
of microfilm research, given
many materials are still only
available in that form.

"There's this common per
ception that you can just go on

line, or if you use some of our e
books and library websites
[that] you can get everything.
You actually can't,"
Jakusovszky said. "There are
complete newspaper runs and
scholarly articles that are only
available on microfilm, so facul
ty and students actually use
that collection quite a bit."
Jakusovszky downplayed
the significance of some of the
resources' less-intensive usage,
noting the broader purpose of
compiling such materials.

"Part of the mission of the li
brary is also to archive materi
al. It's not necessarily just to
have materials that are cur
rently in use, because when
that format changes, some
things can be lost," he said.
"We'll probably do some
preservation work, but there's
no plan to move them."
