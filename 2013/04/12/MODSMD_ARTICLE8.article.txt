## Script lets students opt out of fees 
### DOMINICA WAMBOLD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the buzz on campus about
the amount of money that voluntary
student organizations (VSOs) receive
from students through the special
fees process, Paul Benigeri 'l5 has a
simple solution a computer script
allowing students to opt out of the
special fees process.
Benigeri, a computer program
mer who has worked on projects like
the music site Dancing Astronaut,
published his script after finding out
"by default [students] are billed al
most $l5O every quarter to fund stu
dent groups." Through a simple
copy-paste mechanism, students
could switch their special fees ballot
to vote down every request instead of
the default vote in favor.
According to Benigeri, the script
has had some impact.
"Over 2,000 people viewed the
site and over 400 people were on it
for an extended period of time, so
that suggests that they probably
used the script," he said. "Unless
they were just reading the three
paragraphs I wrote for over two min
utes."
If 400 undergraduates actually
ran Benigeri's script and vot
ed against every single special
fees request, they would
shave over $llO,OOO from the
special fees budget.
"I think most people don't
really know about what is
happening with money they
are contributing to the budg
et," Benigeri said. "I think
that this should be either an
opt-in policy or the process
should be made much more
public."

Nanci Howe, Associate
Dean and Director of Student
Activities and Leadership
(SAL), argued against the use
of the script, noting that spe
cial fees decisions aren't made
under the table but rather are
determined directly by stu
dents every election.
"The special fee is the op
portunity for any student
group to apply directly to ap
ply for money in the election
and to have students directly
vote," Howe explained. "If a
student does not agree with
that group, I hope that they
vote in the election and vote
that fee down in the election."

Benigeri's link gained
traction on social media, but it
prompted some criticism.

Daniel Smith 'l2 M.S. 'l3
posted about the script on
github the same code-shar

ing site it was originally post
ed on requesting its re
moval or amendment.

"The way it is currently,
where you have to individual
ly uncheck these boxes, you
have an awareness of the im
pact you're going to have to
every single dance group,
every single cultural club,
every single play you're re
moving funding from," he
wrote.

ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Brianna Pang 'l3 point
ed out the serious implications
of opting out of special fees.
"There are a lot of implica
tions that people don't think
of. All of the groups are able
to get a list of all of the people
who have defunded from the
group," she said. "Let's say
that you defund legal coun
selling, and let's say that in
May you get into trouble with
alcohol or something and you
need some kind of legal repre
sentation... You wouldn't be
able to use that resource at all."

She emphasized, however,
that students struggle to un
derstand the ASSU and its
special fees process.
"Students are currently
voting up a group during
spring elections, and then
coming back in the fall, realiz
ing that those groups are go
ing to be asking for money,
and then requesting waivers,"
she said.
