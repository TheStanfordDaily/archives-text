# Inside the lines at the spring game

### David Cohn 
What a difference a
year makes! After
exceeding even
the most opti
mistic predictions
for the 2012 season and shocking the
college football world in the process,
the defending Pac-12 and Rose Bowl
Champions returned to Stanford
Stadium on Saturday for the Cardi
nal & White Spring Game.
This year's game was defined by
two words that will be recurring
themes as we get closer to Sept. 7's
opener against San Jose State: antic
ipation and expectation. On one
hand, the sheer talent and potential
on this roster gives the 2013 cam
paign the makings of a special sea
son. On the other hand, the pressure
and spotlight that comes with the na
tional media attention will be square
ly on the Cardinal's shoulders.
While the Card cannot respond to
the expectations for its season until
the fall, Stanford certainly delivered
on its potential at the Spring Game.
This was most apparent at the posi
tion that was perhaps the biggest
question mark coming into spring
practices: wide receiver.
Although the Cardinal lost its top
five players in receiving yards from
last year's squad, it appears that jun
ior starting quarterback Kevin
Hogan will have no shortage of tar
gets to throw to this season after
standout performances by sopho
more receiver Michael Rector and
junior wide receiver Ty Montgomery.
Rector demonstrated that he can
be the deep threat that Stanford's of
fensive attack needs. In particular,
Rector wowed the 4,350 people in at
tendance with his best Lynn Swann
impersonation on a 44-yard touch
down reception that gave the Cardi
nal team (Offense) a 12-8 lead.
Hogan went for the home-run
throw into double coverage that had
interception written all over the play.
However, Rector outfought senior
strong safety Kyle Olugbode for the
football before making a diving catch
on the tipped ball in the end zone for
six.
On the play, Rector epitomized all
of the desired qualities in a wide re
ceiver; he showed tremendous speed
and route-ranning ability to create
separation between him and senior
safety Devon Carrington, as well as
great physicality in battling a defend
er of comparable size in Olugbode.
While a receiver can normally re
ly on a size and weight advantage
against the opposing secondary, 6-
foot-1,190-pound Rector had no such
luxury against the 6-foot-l, 192-
pound Olugbode. However, Rector
was not deterred at all, winning the
aerial battle against Olugbode for his
quarterback. Finally, Rector did well
to keep the ball in his line of sight
throughout his full-extension dive.
The play will undoubtedly give quar
terback and receiver a great deal of
confidence as they continue to estab
lish their rapport.
Montgomery also had a solid day
for team Cardinal, grabbing five
catches for 59 yards and a touch
down. 2013 may finally be the year
when Montgomery becomes a No. 1
receiver. On the Cardinal team's sec
ond drive, Montgomery certainly
looked like Hogan's preferred option,
as Hogan targeted the junior on all
three first down passing plays.
On his touchdown reception,
Montgomery helped save a drive
that nearly stalled after the offense
was called for an illegal formation
penalty on third and goal inside the 1.
However, Montgomery created
great separation in the right corner
of the end zone, leading to an easy
throw from Hogan and catch for the
score.
The offensive line was also a ma
jor storyline from the Spring Game.
Although the defense was not al
lowed to hit the quarterback during
the exhibition, Hogan rarely found
himself under any significant pres
sure. The left side of the line, an
chored by sophomore Andrus Peat
and senior David Yankey, absolutely
neutralized any pass rush on
Hogan's blind side. Peat, a five-star
recruit out of high school, showed
why he has the potential to become
one of the great offensive linemen in
program history.
In turn, Peat's performance was
coupled by the play of Yankey, who
has already established himself in
that pantheon of great Stanford line
men as a consensus All-American.
Together, Peat and Yankey stymied
the push of the defensive line, help
ing give Hogan ample time to run
through his progressions.
With the Spring Game behind us,
we now stand a mere four and a half
