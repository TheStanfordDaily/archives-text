## BATS COMING ALIVE 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Washington came to Sunken Di
amond with an 8-22 record and the
least-productive offense in the Pae
-12. But it took Stanford until Sun
day to solve the Huskies' bats, over
coming a pedestrian start from sen
ior pitcher Mark Appel Friday and
an offensive onslaught Saturday to
win the series two games to one.

With the dominant Appel facing
the weakest offense of the Pac-12 in
Washington (9-24, 3-9 Pac-12),
many anticipated a special per
formance from the righty ace and
certainly a victory for Stanford (19-
11, 7-5 Pac-12).
But the Huskies jumped on Ap
pel from the start. Washington
right fielder Jayce Ray tripled to
lead off the game and scored on a
wild pitch from Appel. After the
Cardinal tied in with an unearned
run in the bottom of the first, Wash
ington went right back at Appel,
tagging him for two more runs to
take a 3-1 lead.
Stanford clawed back with a
consistent scoring effort. The Car
dinal scored in five of the first six
innings, using a three-run fourth to
reclaim the lead for good.
Junior catcher Brant Whiting,
who has been on a tear since as
cending to the starting catcher
spot, singled to start the inning.
Then junior right fielder Austin
Wilson, playing right field for the

first time since opening day, dou
bled to left center to put two run
ners in scoring position with no
body out.
Sophomore third baseman Alex
Blandino and senior designated hit
ter Justin Ringo knocked in Whit
ing and Wilson respectively with
RBI singles to take back the lead.
Junior second baseman Danny
Diekroeger added the third run
with an RBI walk.
"The whole year the pitching's
kind of carried us," Wilson said. "I
think it's about time that the bats
kind of turned around and [did] our
job."
Junior pitcher AJ Vanegas re
lieved Appel after the eight with
the Card leading 7-4 to try to earn
the save and seal Appel's sixth vic
tory of the season. It didn't go
smoothly for Vanegas, as the junior
allowed three consecutive singles to
put the tying run on base with no
body out. But Vanegas settled
down, retiring the next three
Huskies to earn the save, his fourth
of the season.
But Washington's ninth-inning
momentum carried over to Satur
day afternoon, as the Huskies again
had success at the plate from the
beginning of the game. Stanford
freshman starting pitcher Logan
James struggled with his com
mand. The freshman allowed six
runs five earned â€”on six hits
and three walks in only 3.1 innings
of work to take the loss.

Of the four Cardinal pitchers
that appeared on the mound, only
freshman Marcus Brakeman had a
day to remember. Brakeman al
lowed only one run on five hits in 3.2
innings of relief to keep the Cardi

nal within striking distance. Fresh
man Daniel Starwalt and sopho
more David Schmidt allowed two
earned runs each in the eighth and
ninth innings respectively.
Heading into Sunday's rubber
match, the pressure on Stanford
was sky high. After dropping two of
three in its other conference series
at Sunken Diamond against Utah
back in March, and with tough op

ponents in Arizona, Oregon State
and UCLA visiting the Farm soon,
the Cardinal was running out of op
portunities to improve its postsea
son resume.
The Stanford bats answered the
call in a big way. After scoring one
in the bottom of the first, the Cardi
nal exploded for six runs in the bot-

torn of the second to take a
decisive 7-0 lead en route to a
12-2 victory. Stanford sent 10
hitters to the plate in the in
ning between bookend outs

more recorded the first and
third outs of the inning, both
on hard-hit balls.

The highlight of the beat
down was back-to-back mon

more Wayne Taylor his
first career homer and
junior first baseman Brian
Ragira. Ragira's blast
chased Washington starter
Trevor Dunlap, who took the
loss after allowing six runs

on eight hits in only 1.1 in
nings.
Sophomore starting
pitcher John Hochstatter
earned the complete-game
victory, needing only 98
pitches. The lefty kept Wash
ington off-balance all game,
allowing only two runs on
seven hits while recording
his only two strikeouts in the
ninth inning.
Stanford saw its fielding
improve on Sunday as well.
Perhaps sparked by strong
performances at the plate,
junior shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila and Wilson made
great plays at shortstop and
right field. Wilson had two
more diving catches in foul
ground Friday night, demon
strating that he is ready to
play the field in his first
weekend back out from that

elbow injury.
"I got my reps in during
some intrasquads in the past
week," Wilson said. "I've got
to keep my legs in shape so I
can track down balls. I've
been working hard in batting
practice, trying to get good
reads, so [the transition
back] wasn't too bad."
Sunday's win gave Stan
ford its third consecutive se
ries victory. However, it was
the Cardinal's first win on a
Sunday since topping Texas
2-1 on March 3.
On Tuesday, Stanford
heads back on the road to
take on Pacific before a home
weekend series against Ari
zona. First pitch Tuesday is
scheduled for 6 p.m.
