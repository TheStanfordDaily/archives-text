doni followed up a strong performance against
UCLA last weekend with an eight-save effort
to hold the Women of Troy to just four goals.
USC came into Saturday's matchup averaging

er tallied fewer than nine goals in a single
match.
Senior Melissa Seidemann staked the Cardi

perimeter shot from junior

any hopes of a Trojan come
back.
USC would score once
more on a power play goal
from Monica Vavic with 34
seconds remaining, but
Stanford maintained posses
sion for the rest of the game
to earn the 6-4 victory.
The Cardinal remained in
Los Angeles for a game on
Sunday against No. 11 Loy
ola Marymount, which Stan
ford won 10-2. The Cardinal
used a 4-0 second quarter to
take a 7-1 halftime lead and
never looked back.
The Olympians Seide-

Mann, Steffens and Dries
each scored a goal in the first
and second quarters to al
most singlehandedly build
Stanford's big first-half lead.
Neushul rounded out the
second-quarter run with a
goal of her own and added
two more in the third for a
hat trick. Freshman Anna
Yelizarova scored Stanford's
lone fourth-quarter goal.
Senior Jessica Morelos
and junior Alexandra Honny
scored one goal each for the
Lions.
With the two wins this
weekend, Stanford pushed
its winning streak to 13
straight. The Cardinal closes
out the regular season with a
game against No. 5 Cal (16-
5, 2-3 MPSF) next Friday at
Berkeley.
This will be the first
matchup between the two
Bay Area rivals this season,

although they faced off in a
preseason scrimmage. After
that informal contest, Seide
mann described the Golden
Bears as "very physical and
strong."
Cal is locked into fifth
place in the MPSF, so next
weekend's matchup could be
a preview of the Cardinal's
first playoff game. As the
No. 1 seed, Stanford will get
a bye into the semifinals,
where it will meet the win
ner of the No. 4/No. 5 game.
The Golden Bears are led
by Emily Csikos, who re
cently became Cal's all-time
leading scorer. The senior
has scored 47 goals this year,
leading the team by a whop
ping 15 goals.
The match will take place
on Friday, April 19 at 5 p.m.
