## Cougars too strong for Cardinal KNELLER'S HOME CAREER COMES TO A CLOSE 
### DANIEL LUPIN STAFF WRITER 
No. 8 Stanford men's volleyball wrapped up
its home slate for the season, concluding the
regular season with a weekend split in a victo
ry over No. 5 Cal Baptist on Friday night and

a loss to top
ranked BYU on
Saturday night.
Despite the de
feat to the No. 1
team in the na-

tion, Stanford (15-12,12-12 MPSF) should en
ter the upcoming conference tournament with
confidence following its performance over the
weekend.
While Saturday's Senior Night did not con
clude as planned for the Cardinal and lone sen
ior Jake Kneller, Stanford showed fight
against top-ranked BYU (22-4, 21-3) in three
tough sets, falling 30-28, 25-18,25-21.
Stanford knew it would need a strong team
performance if it wanted to have a chance.
"They're the best team in the country," said
freshman setter James Shaw before the
match. "It's going to take all of us playing at
100 percent."
The Cardinal responded by pushing the
Cougars to the brink twice in the first set, as
Stanford gained set points at 25-24 and 27-26
behind the particularly strong play of Shaw,
who tallied 13 assists in the frame, and junior
outside hitter Steven Irvin, who registered six
kills.
Poor serving was a theme of the weekend
for the Cardinal, and it would be the team's un
doing in the first set. Stanford saw its strong
play on both sides of the ball squandered with
two service errors on each set point it had. De
spite recording 17 kills and four blocks as a
team in the set, the Cardinal would come up
empty when redshirt sophomore outside hitter
Daniel Tublin's attack at 28-29 sailed wide left
to end the set.
Set two swung wildly in BYU's favor after
Tublin's service error at 12-12 started a 13-6
BYU run to close it out. Behind an efficient at
tack that saw the team hit .400 for the frame
highlighted by junior middle blocker Devin
Young's five kills for the set the Cougars
took control and didn't look back. With Stan
ford's defense focused on holding BYU's dy
namic duo of freshman phenoms Ben Patch
and junior Ail-American Taylor Sander at bay,
Young put on a show, converting 12 of his 17
chances into kills for the evening.
The third set saw the Cardinal off to a poor
start once again, falling behind 14-8 after an
error by junior outside hitter Brian Cook. The
team showed its mettle by responding with six
straight points to even the set, and it even held
the lead at 18-17 following some terrific team
play that saw contributions from everyone on
the court. In the end, however, Stanford could-

n't answer BYU's arsenal of
weapons, falling 25-21 after
Sander's serve glanced off
the back line to seal the victo
ry for the Cougars.
Irvin finished with 15 kills
and seven digs, and Shaw had
33 assists for the Cardinal,
but the team was held to just
a .196 hitting percentage in
the defeat.
Friday night's match had
resulted in a happier conclu
sion for Stanford, which out
lasted MPSF newcomer Cal
Baptist (16-14, 12-12 MPSF)
in five sets, 25-23, 20-25, 25-
16, 23-25, 15-10. Despite the
relative unfamiliarity be
tween the two teams, the
match was a chippy one, with
emotions running so high be
tween the newcomers and the
four-time conference champi
ons that the Cal Baptist
bench was even assessed a
yellow card.
Particularly key for the
Cardinal in the match was the
rhythm Shaw developed with
his middle blockers, juniors
Denny Falls and Eric Mochal
ski. The two combined for 22
kills on 38 attempts with just
two eiTors. Mochalski fitting
ly ended the match on a set
over the middle from Shaw,
which punctuated Stanford's
7-2 run to close the final set.
"We've been connecting
really well recently," Mochal
ski said. "He found me all
night, and he just put up a ball
I could put away. I was fortu
nate enough that it went
down."
Stanford hit .303 as a
team for the match, high
lighted by Shaw's 49 assists.
Four Stanford starters
reached double figures in
kills: Irvin with 14, Cook with
13, Mochalski with 12 and

Falls with 10. The Brazilian
duo of Guilherme Koepp and
Levi Cabral finished with a
combined 32 kills for Cal
Baptist but were forced to
take 88 swings to do so.
For the Cardinal, the win
sealed the No. 6 seed and a

date with third-seeded Long
Beach State Saturday in
Long Beach, Calif., in the
first round of the MPSF
Tournament
