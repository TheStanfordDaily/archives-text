## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN ASSU Elections Recap 
### Miles Unterreiner 
This year's elections results
are in and they look prom
ising for the cause of student
freedom.
As I mentioned in my column
two weeks ago, a group of con
cerned students and alums recently
got together and founded the Stan
ford Student Freedom Project
(SSFP) an organization dedicat
ed to preserving student residential
independence and protecting cam
pus workers. We endorsed candi
dates for this year's ASSU elections
who we felt would best exemplify
SSFP's core mission: improving the
quality, frequency and transparency
of communication between
ResEd/R&DE administrators and
students; strengthening student
voices in decisions that concern res
idential life; protecting the jobs and
wages of the residential and dining
workers who make students' expe
rience here what it is; and defend
ing student residential independ
ence. By endorsing these candi
dates, we hoped that we could help
avoid future catastrophes like this
year's battle over Suites Dining.
While the numbers aren't by
any means definitive and the chains
of causation are difficult to tease
out, I think I can say with reason
able confidence that the cause of
student freedom made a positive (if
small) difference in this year's elec
tion. Here are the numbers; I'm in
terested to see if my readers agree.
All six Undergraduate Senate
candidates endorsed by SSFP
Natasha Patel, Ilya Mouzykantskii,
Ben Holston, Ryan Matsumoto,
Abby Dow and Hisham Al-Falih
won election, and SSFP-endorsed
candidates took four of the top six
spots. The Junior and Senior Class
President Slates endorsed by
SSFP Takels and SenYOUR
Time were also elected. And

candidates would do an excellent

lagher victory brings especial en
couragement to a coalition ener
gized by Billy's fiery writing in the
service of student independence.
It's more than possible, of
course, that these results were de
termined by factors far beyond,
and more important than, SSFP
Four of SSFP's six Senate en
dorsees, for instance, also received
the powerful SOCC stamp of ap
proval. And our endorsement panel
felt deeply that the candidates we
endorsed were capable and effec
tive leaders in their own right; in
other words, that they would have
succeeded in their campaigns for
office whether or not they received
the SSFP endorsement (or any en
dorsements!).
Nonetheless, two of SSFP's
Senate candidates Ilya, a major
force behind the Suites protest in
White Plaza, and Ben, a sophomore
currently living in Suites whose
campaign was inspired by the po
tential end of Suites Dining (and
who came in sixth among all Senate
candidates) â€”were elected with
out the SOCC endorsement. And
Ilya, in fact, received no other en-

dorsements at all.
Whatever the reasons for this
year's results, though, the staff at
SSFP is tremendously encouraged
to see so many (we believe) capable
candidates elected to office. As the
conclusion of a negotiated compro
mise with ResEd nears and
looks very positive the ASSU
election results lend added confi
dence to our belief that next year
will be a banner year for the de
fense of the little things on campus.
Little things like running your own
eating environment, fostering close
connections with chefs and work
ers, managing a piece of your own
board bill payment, continuing the
weird and quirky traditions that set
Stanford apar and having a say in
the decisions that affect you as stu
dents. I'm only sad that I won't be
here to see it.
Thanks for voting, Stanford!
