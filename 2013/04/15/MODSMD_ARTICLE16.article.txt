## Meet 576 Alvarado Row 
### MARK BESSEN '15 
With the opening of the 2013
Housing Draw on April
10th came a fair amount of
confusion. The tier system, preas
signment, draw groups they all
take a bit of know-how to get used
to.

But my main confusion when log
ging onto the R&DE portal to check
out my housing options for next
year was the appearance of a new
residence: 576 Alvarado Row. Next
to it, in parentheses, it explains:
"formerly Chi Theta Chi."
Now, I wasn't confused because I
didn't know where 576 Alvarado
Row was. I currently live two doors

down at Hammarskjold House (592
Alvarado Row), so I recognized my
neighbor's address.
I was confused because, despite
closely following the news of Stan
ford's acquisition of Chi Theta Chi
(XOX) over the last year and a half,
I didn't know the University had ac
tually decided to do away with the
co-op's familiar name.
XOX's story is well known on the
Stanford campus. The 30-person
house was regularly in The Daily for
a large portion of last year. Prior to
April 2012, XOX was operated inde
pendently by the owners of a long
term lease. The land has always

been Stanford's, but the house had
more autonomy than other Stan
ford-operated residences.
Citing health and safety con
cerns on the property last winter,
the University declined to reinstate
XOX's lease, thereby acquiring the
residence.
After noticing the name change
on the housing site, I tried to imag
ine the University's rationale. My
first thought was that XOX might
still have some Greek affiliation that
the new owners didn't want to main
tain, like when Kappa house
became 1035 Campus Drive for the
period when the fraternity wasn't
actually housed there. But after a
quick Google search, I found that the
house officially split from any affilia
tion with the Theta Chi fraternity in
the late 1980s. So that can't be it.
It's also possible that after the
buy-out, the former owners of XOX
didn't want the house to keep the
name while being run by Stanford,
Inc. I couldn't find any statements
about this, though, and since the
XOX board was very openly com
municative about the status of the
house during the whole ordeal, I
doubt it's the case.
The other thing I thought might
be and probably is the cause
of the name change was the exten
sive controversy surrounding the
University's re-integration of the
house as a Stanford-owned proper
ty. In my opinion, if that is the case,
the renaming does little more than
sweep the whole situation under the
rug.
The name of the house might
seem insignificant, but I don't think
it is. XOX has been a symbol of inde
pendence and open-mindedness on
Stanford's campus for decades. It's
home to a microcosm of its own dis
tinct, dynamic culture. Even if you
don't agree with or enjoy that cul
ture, I hope you can appreciate that
it is here. And I don't think it's going
anywhere, even if the name is.
