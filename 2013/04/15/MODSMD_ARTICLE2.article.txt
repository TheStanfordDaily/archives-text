# Ashton/Gallagher elected ASSU Executive
## Last-minute controversy surrounds final voting 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
Dan Ashton 'l4 and Billy Gallagher 'l4
have been elected as the 2013-14 ASSU
Executive with 55 percent of the vote after
two rounds of balloting, beating out Najla
Gomez 'l4 and Elizabeth Patino 'l4.
Around 50 students gathered at the Co-
Ho at 5 p.m. on Saturday as ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Brianna Pang 'l3 an
nounced results. Gomez and Patino sat at
the foot of the stage during the elections
party, while Ashton and Gallagher were
away attending rush retreats for their fra
ternities.
The Chaparral slate of Anthony So 'l4
and Ryan De Taboada 'l4 received 214
votes.
The results are subject to Stanford Stu
dent Enterprise (SSE) audits of items like
a $l,OOO campaign spending limit for Exec
utive slates. According to Pang, turnout in
creased by 2.2 percent from the 2012 AS
SU elections.

"It was a good affirmation that the stu
dent body believes in our experience and
our issues," Gallagher said. "They sup
ported us based on our experience and the
issues and not because of any endorsing
body."
Buzz surrounded the final hours of vot
ing in a mostly uncontroversial campaign
as Ashton/Gallagher dropped their en
dorsement from The Stanford Review af
ter the publication posted an opinions
piece by Jason Lupatkin 'l3 on Friday urg
ing students to not vote for Students of
Color Coalition (SOCC)-endorsed candi
dates. The column was pulled and modified
slightly to remove racial language before
being reposted.
According to Judith Romea 'l4, editor
in chief of The Stanford Review, the colum
n's initial removal happened due to techni
cal difficulties and not at Ashton's request,
as had been claimed by the candidate. Ac

the column's content.
"It was not supposed to be
pulled," she said. "We were having
issues with [site host] Word Press,
and we were live-updating it."
According to former Review ed
itor in chief Lisa Wallace 'l4, Ash
ton contacted her requesting that
the column be removed. Both
Romea and Wallace emphasized
that Ashton's request had had no
bearing on The Review's editorial
decisions.
"The very fact that we refused to
take the piece down shows The Re
view does not pander to school politi
cians," Romea said. "Because of Mr.
Lupatkin's bravery, we were able to
open up an issue that everyone was
mum about until five hours before
the election."
The column, which cast asper
sions on SOCC's role in influencing
ASSU elections and legislative agen
da, came under extensive criticism
on social media and mailing lists.
"Y'all been think its [sic] a game
when I say people are coming for our
communities," wrote Tianay Pulphus
'l3 in an email to the Diaspora mail
ing list. "I hope you see that this isn't
a game."
"It wasn't technically against
elections regulations and University
policy," Pang said of Lupatkin's col
umn. "You can't regulate free speech
unless it's directly harmful, and the
thing is, when we read it we thought
that it was horrible, but we couldn't
take it down."
The SOCC-backed slate of
Gomez and Patino failed to win office,
but SOCC-endorsed candidates
went 11-for-ll in Senate races.
"I felt like it was a cleaner elec
tion than last year," Pang said, ref
erencing controversial attacks on
Executive candidate Stewart Mac-
Gregor-Dennis 'l3 during last
year's election. "The Elections
Commission went out of our way to
communicate very directly with
candidates so that they know all
the University regulations govern
ing student conduct."
Amendments and Senate
Amendment A, which was put
on the ballot by the Ashton/Gal

lagher slate and which would re
serve space in the ASSU Under
graduate Senate for upperclass
men, passed with 1,458 votes in fa
vor and 466 against. 1,495 under
graduates abstained from voting on
the amendment.
In the special fees process, all
undergraduate groups and all but
one joint group requesting special
fees had their requests approved.
The Legal Counseling Office was
the only group to be denied special
fees by the electorate. It received
votes from the majority of both the
undergraduates and graduates
who voted, but it failed to garner
the requisite 15 percent of the total
student population.
Reflecting on this year's cam
paign season, Pang noted fewer fly
ers and a lower level of campaign
activity.
"I felt the level of campaign ac
tivity was a little low this year," she
said. "People didn't really gear up
until Wednesday or Thursday,
while all the years I've been here
they usually start campaigning on
the first Monday of spring quar
ter."

received more than 50 votes.
"Obviously I'm thrilled. I'm
very excited I think the group
coming in is great, [and] a lot of the
people I canvassed with won elec
tion too," Holston said. "I'm excited
to get to work. Athletes haven't
been represented in the ASSU for
a long time."
The incoming Senate, without a
single returning member for the
second straight year, will need to
rely on current senators to learn
about an institution hindered by
structural issues and plummeting
prestige.
"There are going to be chal
lenges, considering that no one in
this year's Senate has been in
volved with the ASSU before, but
we've been in contact with some of

the current senators," Matsumoto
said. "They've promised to help out
and be active in the transition peri
od so that we can get to work soon
er and learn more about the rules
of the Senate."
In their campaigns, incoming
senators almost uniformly empha
sized the need to adapt mental
health resources to better serve
students.
"I think the biggest part of my
platform was my emphasis on men
tal health," Caruso said. "I think a
lot of students understood the need
to localize mental health resources

on campus, bringing resources we
have available now to dorm com
plexes and community centers."
Cardinal Direction won election
as sophomore class presidents,
takels as junior class presidents
and SenYOUR Time as senior class
presidents. Fourteen graduate stu
dents won election to the Graduate
Student Council, with one seat
pending because of a five-way tie
between candidates with one write
in vote each.

According to Judith Romea 'l4, editor

the column's content.
"It was not supposed to be
pulled," she said. "We were having
issues with [site host] Word Press,
and we were live-updating it."
According to former Review ed
itor in chief Lisa Wallace 'l4, Ash
ton contacted her requesting that
the column be removed. Both
Romea and Wallace emphasized
that Ashton's request had had no
bearing on The Review's editorial
decisions.
"The very fact that we refused to
take the piece down shows The Re
view does not pander to school politi
cians," Romea said. "Because of Mr.
Lupatkin's bravery, we were able to
open up an issue that everyone was
mum about until five hours before
the election."
The column, which cast asper
sions on SOCC's role in influencing
ASSU elections and legislative agen
da, came under extensive criticism
on social media and mailing lists.
"Y'all been think its [sic] a game
when I say people are coming for our
communities," wrote Tianay Pulphus
'l3 in an email to the Diaspora mail
ing list. "I hope you see that this isn't
a game."
"It wasn't technically against
elections regulations and University
policy," Pang said of Lupatkin's col
umn. "You can't regulate free speech
unless it's directly harmful, and the
thing is, when we read it we thought
that it was horrible, but we couldn't
take it down."
The SOCC-backed slate of
Gomez and Patino failed to win office,
but SOCC-endorsed candidates
went 11-for-ll in Senate races.
"I felt like it was a cleaner elec
tion than last year," Pang said, ref
erencing controversial attacks on
Executive candidate Stewart Mac-
Gregor-Dennis 'l3 during last
year's election. "The Elections
Commission went out of our way to
communicate very directly with
candidates so that they know all
the University regulations govern
ing student conduct."
Amendments and Senate
Amendment A, which was put
on the ballot by the Ashton/Gal

lagher slate and which would re
serve space in the ASSU Under
graduate Senate for upperclass
men, passed with 1,458 votes in fa
vor and 466 against. 1,495 under
graduates abstained from voting on
the amendment.
In the special fees process, all
undergraduate groups and all but
one joint group requesting special
fees had their requests approved.
The Legal Counseling Office was
the only group to be denied special
fees by the electorate. It received
votes from the majority of both the
undergraduates and graduates
who voted, but it failed to garner
the requisite 15 percent of the total
student population.
Reflecting on this year's cam
paign season, Pang noted fewer fly
ers and a lower level of campaign
activity.
"I felt the level of campaign ac
tivity was a little low this year," she
said. "People didn't really gear up
until Wednesday or Thursday,
while all the years I've been here
they usually start campaigning on
the first Monday of spring quar
ter."

received more than 50 votes.
"Obviously I'm thrilled. I'm
very excited I think the group
coming in is great, [and] a lot of the
people I canvassed with won elec
tion too," Holston said. "I'm excited
to get to work. Athletes haven't
been represented in the ASSU for
a long time."
The incoming Senate, without a
single returning member for the
second straight year, will need to
rely on current senators to learn
about an institution hindered by
structural issues and plummeting
prestige.
"There are going to be chal
lenges, considering that no one in
this year's Senate has been in
volved with the ASSU before, but
we've been in contact with some of

the current senators," Matsumoto
said. "They've promised to help out
and be active in the transition peri
od so that we can get to work soon
er and learn more about the rules
of the Senate."
In their campaigns, incoming
senators almost uniformly empha
sized the need to adapt mental
health resources to better serve
students.
"I think the biggest part of my
platform was my emphasis on men
tal health," Caruso said. "I think a
lot of students understood the need
to localize mental health resources

on campus, bringing resources we
have available now to dorm com
plexes and community centers."
Cardinal Direction won election
as sophomore class presidents,
takels as junior class presidents
and SenYOUR Time as senior class
presidents. Fourteen graduate stu
dents won election to the Graduate
Student Council, with one seat
pending because of a five-way tie
between candidates with one write
in vote each.

votes.
The results are subject to Stanford Stu
