Tom Kealey is a lecturer in Stanford's Cre
ative Writing Program and the author of
"Thieves I've Known," a collection of short sto
ries that has won critical acclaim and which will
be published later this year. The Daily sat
down to talk with Kealey about "coding" sto
ries, his first day of teaching and his new book.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Where did you
attend college? When did you realize that
you wanted to be a working writer?
Tom Kealey (TK): I majored in history and
English at University of North Carolina
Greensboro, or UNCG. I took writing classes
there and liked it a lot. A group of my friends
and I started a magazine during our time there
[called] "Cities and Roads." This was big we
were in our early 20s, and we were starting to
make a fiction magazine before the Internet
was even around.
It was really interesting to get it published
and see what people liked to read. I think that
was the turning point where I realized I might
want to go into writing. I was reading both
good and bad fiction and, in the bad fiction, rec
ognized a lot of things that I knew I was not do
ing well. So that was meeting a lot of writers, a
lot of readers, and we had six issues over our
four years there.
Then I went to graduate school at the Uni
versity of Massachusetts for creative wilting
and maintained a good interest in writing then.
I basically was writing stories on a daily basis,
and I started to get published and teaching
creative writing from that point.
TSD: So tell me more about "Cities and
Roads." Did you have to support it out of
your wallet, or did someone else sponsor it?
TK: We were a group of three, and I guess
eventually I became the leader. We funded our
selves, paying out of our own pockets, and
