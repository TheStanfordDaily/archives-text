# Q&A Tom KEALEY LECTURER IN STANFORD'S CREATIVE WRITING PROGRAM
## 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Tom Kealey is a lecturer in Stanford's Cre
ative Writing Program and the author of
"Thieves I've Known," a collection of short sto
ries that has won critical acclaim and which will
be published later this year. The Daily sat
down to talk with Kealey about "coding" sto
ries, his first day of teaching and his new book.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Where did you
attend college? When did you realize that
you wanted to be a working writer?
Tom Kealey (TK): I majored in history and
English at University of North Carolina
Greensboro, or UNCG. I took writing classes
there and liked it a lot. A group of my friends
and I started a magazine during our time there
[called] "Cities and Roads." This was big we
were in our early 20s, and we were starting to
make a fiction magazine before the Internet
was even around.
It was really interesting to get it published
and see what people liked to read. I think that
was the turning point where I realized I might
want to go into writing. I was reading both
good and bad fiction and, in the bad fiction, rec
ognized a lot of things that I knew I was not do
ing well. So that was meeting a lot of writers, a
lot of readers, and we had six issues over our
four years there.
Then I went to graduate school at the Uni
versity of Massachusetts for creative wilting
and maintained a good interest in writing then.
I basically was writing stories on a daily basis,
and I started to get published and teaching
creative writing from that point.
TSD: So tell me more about "Cities and
Roads." Did you have to support it out of
your wallet, or did someone else sponsor it?
TK: We were a group of three, and I guess
eventually I became the leader. We funded our
selves, paying out of our own pockets, and

that's significant since we were
working as bartenders or waiters.
But it was important for us it
was the craft of storytelling, help
ing people get their stories out in
the world, figuring out away to
move our own stories in the world.
TSD: I read somewhere that you
force yourself to write every day.
Where do you get all your inspira
tion?
TK: There are some days when
I'm completely inspired and others
where I'm completely uninspired,
but I still sit down and write. And
when I look back at the writings
that I did those days, I can't see
the difference. When I write, I'm
trying to capture character voice
or worldview, seeing the world the
way the character sees the world.
It's like a new adventure, seeing the
world with the character's eyes.
TSD: When did you first begin
writing?
TK: [As a kid] I read a lot in the
back of my room instead of play
ing outside was always with my
head in a book. But in elementary
school, we had a soccer coach
Coach Osbourne —who also taught
English and had us write short sto
ries. He was reading the winning en
try for one of these interschool fic

tion prizes, and we were laughing
because we didn't think it was very
good. We thought we could have
done that. And he just said, "Well,
you didn't." And he really encour
aged us to write, and I remember
finding it harder than I thought it
would be.
TSD: What is your writing process
like?
TK: I like to think of witting as
coding. We have 26 letters and punc
tuations to use too—we're coding
our own stories. Writing's like figur
ing out a puzzle. I know the emotion
I want to get across, but how can I
evoke that same feeling in the read
er?

TSD: Did you follow any career
path before you decided you want
ed to write professionally?
TK: Like a lot of people graduat
ing from college, I didn't know ex
actly what I wanted to do. I knew I
wanted to do something artistic, I
knew I wanted to continue writing
in some way, whether for business
or management training or for cre
ative leadership, and for a while I
thought I would be a trainer or
teaching creativity. But I felt the
pull of creative writing.
"Cities and Roads," that's when
[creative writing] caught me. And it
fused when I walked into class as a
teacher. The first day I taught, I
knew I wasn't good at it, but I knew
I liked it. I wanted to get good at it,
and I liked the conversations I had
with my students. I remember
walking out of that class very clearly,

thinking, "That wasn't clearly or
ganized, but I'm going to do better
next time."
TSD: When did you start teach
ing?
TK: I started teaching while I
was a graduate student at the Uni
versity of Massachusetts. I taught a
PWR [Program in Writing and
Rhetoric]-like class. Right after that,
I applied for the Stegner Fellowship.
I was chosen in 2001, and, for two
years, we met in workshops and got
to write fiction and poetry with wint
ers from around the country and
around the world, and we basically
would write as much as we possibly
can. After that, I became a Jones
Lecturer, and they just keep hiring
me.

TSD: Where did the idea for your
Imaginative Realms class that
you're co-teaching with Keith
Ekiss [another Jones Lecturer]
come from?
TK: There was actually a survey
of creative writing students asking
about what sort of classes they were
interested in seeing offered, and one
of those was for science-fiction, fan
tasy, ghost stories, robots, myths,
dystopias or Utopias. I don't have a
big background in this, but I've been
reading through "Game of
Thrones," and I tell myself it's re
search for this class, but I was done
with that series in four or five
months.

TSD: Tell me more about your col
lection, "Thieves I've Known".

When did you first write these sto
ries?
TK: I wrote many of these stories
as a Stegner Fellow. Many of them
are about teenagers either from
North Carolina or the Pacific North
west. [The] Pacific Northwest be
cause when I was touring Puget
Sound taking a ferry up to Alaska,
much of the landscape and many of
the people I met there were very
similar to what I grew up with in
North Carolina. Anyway, these
teenagers are at the edges of society
they're forgotten children, often
poor or missing one or both parents
and the stories are about their
struggle to survive and make their
way in the world. The book will actu
ally be my first [work of] fiction pub
lished— my first book was about
creative writing programs.

TSD: Is there a particular time or
environment or setting for these
stories?
TK: For these stories, I walk the
line between realism and myth, and
I don't incorporate a lot of things like
cellphones or Twitter so the audi
ence wouldn't peg it and say that this
is 2013. If anything, the audience
would see this more in the 19905.
The stories are still accurate to kids
today, and while the computer and
Facebook [are] important and im
pact characters, I work on writing
about relationships with people.

TSD: What was it like to win the
Flannery O'Connor Award?
TK: It was nice. I was staying
with a friend. I yelled, and she

thought that I had hurt myself. It
was a great honor. My story collec
tion had previously come up as run
ner-up or finalist for a lot of differ
ence prizes. I came so close and did
n't win in. But I reworked a few of
the stories, and I don't know if that
made a difference at all, but I feel
like it did. And it's been really nice
to get that recognition. We're work
ing on the cover, and the people at
University of Georgia where the
prize is offered are pleasant peo
ple to work with.
[The award] was like a confi
dence builder. I don't feel like what
I'm typing is any better, but it gives
me confidence. I don't feel any dif
ference. It's hard to say what opin
ion of me there is out there in liter
ary circles, but there are lots of peo
ple coming in to talk to me.
TSD: Since you're finished with
your collection of short stories,
are you taking a break or are you
embarking on something new?
TK: I'm working on a novel that
incorporates magical realism. It's
about a winged girl that lives in our
world. Her wings are not beautiful, so
a lot of the story is about being a freak
and being comfortable with herself. I
don't know what it's like to be a 16-
year-old girl or what it's like to have
wings, but I do know what it feels like
to be awkward and to not fit in.
