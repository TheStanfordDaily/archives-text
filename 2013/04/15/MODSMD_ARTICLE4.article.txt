## Elections see small rise in graduate turnout 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
Fourteen graduate students were elected
to Graduate Student Council (GSC) seats in
this year's ASSU elections, with the Gradu
ate School of Business (GSB)'s seat still
pending because of a five-way tie with one
write-in vote each for first place.
Graduate student turnout increased
slightly over recent year, but the 1,078 votes
cast represents just 9.7 percent of the Uni
versity's 11,154 graduate students. Turnout

has almost been halved over the last three
years, from the 2,053 graduate students who
voted in 2010.
Consistent with past years, engineering
students made up about 40 percent of the
graduate student electorate. The race for en
gineering seats was also the most hotly con
tested, with nine students running for two
seats.
A number of students won election with
limited support. Petr Johanes won election to
the Graduate School of Education's seat with
only 15 votes, Adrienne Johnson was elected

to represent the School of Humanities and
Sciences' humanities students with 17 votes
and Ashveer Singh will represent the social
sciences after earning 37 votes. Johnson will
be the only returning member of this year's
GSC.
By some measures, this year's campaign
was much more competitive than last year's,
when only seven candidates ran for the 10
district seats allotted to the University's nine
schools. This year, 21 candidates stood for
election.
Bryce Anzelmo was elected for
the School of Earth Sciences, Wendy
Ni and Ateeq Suria for the School of
Engineering, Eduardo Gonzalez-
Maldonado for the School of Medi
cine, Susie Choi for the Law School
and Trevor Martin for the natural
sciences section of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences. David Hsu,
Paul Harold, Austin Hay, Adam Xu
and Saad Bhamla were elected to at
large seats.
Graduate students also voted on
five special fee groups that sought
joint special fees. The ASSU Legal
Counseling Office, which provides
confidential legal advice to Stanford
students, was the only group to be
denied special fees by the elec
torate, failing to garner the support
of 15 percent of the combined grad
uate and undergraduate student
bodies. In the end, they fell 16 votes
short of the necessary 2,329 votes.
