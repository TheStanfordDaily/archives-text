## Elections see small rise in graduate turnout

voted in 2010.

students made up about 40 percent of the
graduate student electorate. The race for en

seats.
A number of students won election with
limited support. Petr Johanes won election to
the Graduate School of Education's seat with
only 15 votes, Adrienne Johnson was elected

to represent the School of Humanities and
Sciences' humanities students with 17 votes
and Ashveer Singh will represent the social
sciences after earning 37 votes. Johnson will
be the only returning member of this year's
GSC.

schools. This year, 21 candidates stood for
