# CATCHING FIRE
## RECEIVERS SHINE IN SPRING GAME 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
In some minds, Stanford's offense (Cardi
nal) was as much of an underdog against its
defense (White) as the Cardinal was up at
Oregon last November. But, displaying a sur
prisingly pass-focused attack, the offense put
up a fight, falling just short of an upset victo
ry in a 40-34 loss.
The star of the scrimmage was last sea
son's biggest weakness, the wide receiving
corps. Sophomore wide receiver Michael Rec
tor made the play of the day and according

to ESPN's Sports Center, the No. 3 play of the
day when he climbed the ladder to deflect,
and then eventually corral, a 44-yard touch
down pass from junior quarterback Kevin
Hogan.
"I was on the ground already," Rector said,
"and I saw the ball, [l] kind of reached out and
I was able to pull it back in."
Rector also recorded an 11-yard run on a
misdirection play. Coming out of a long half
time break, the second-string offense could
feel the starting defense licking its chops. The

coaching staff called the per

Rector headed the other way
toward open pastures.
Rector flashed some seri
ous speed on the play, but so
did junior wide receiver Ty
Montgomery. At the post
scrimmage press conference,
the two had differing opin
ions on who the fastest re
ceiver is.
Though both claimed the
title, Rector promised, "We'll
find out" soon for sure, to
which Montgomery respond
ed, "We already know the an
swer."
Fifth-year senior Shayne
Skov solved the conflict, or at
least delayed it. "Forty times
in the spring don't lie," Skov
said.
But even though the focus
of the scrimmage was the
passing game, some of the
less-experienced running
backs continued to impress
in their fight for playing
time.
Senior running back
Ricky Seale led all rushers
with 29 yards on five carries,
including an 11-yarder. Run
ning backs coach Tavita
Pritchard was happy with
Seale's performance, espe
cially considering the situa
tions that he got the ball in.

"Ricky had a great day,"
Pritchard said. "He had a
couple of carries on those out
side zone plays and then cap
italized. He had a couple nice
runs into not-so-great looks.
He did a nice job running."
Sophomore running back
Barry Sanders also had a
few nice runs. Though
Sanders finished with only
12 net yards on seven car
ries, he made a few nice
jukes, even beating Skov
with an agile move on one
play for an 11-yard gain.
Sanders' development
has been one of the more
pleasant surprises of the
spring. After not making
much noise during his fresh
man year, which he redshirt
ed, Sanders has made people
notice him in pretty much
every practice session.
For Sanders and the oth
er less-established backs to
see a good chunk of playing
time, they will have to get
better at pass protection. At
receiver and running back,
blocking is often the differ
ence maker in determining
who sees the field the most.
"The thing we always
want to get better at is pass
protection," Pritchard said.
"Our guys are extremely tal
ented with the ball in their
hands I feel like I do al
most no coaching in that
record ... We've just got to
continue to come along in the
passing game because, when

we're able to go and block
the right guys and really
block them, it allows Hogan
to stay off his back, it allows
our offensive line to feel com
fortable with us helping
them out and it allows us to
push the ball down the field."
With spring practice now
officially over, Stanford's
coaching staff and players
split for two of the most im
portant aspects of building a
championship program: re
cruiting and conditioning.
The coaches will spend
the next few weeks breaking
down spring practice before
hitting the road for the most
grueling recruiting period of
the year.
"That'll be a long month
on the road," Pritchard said.
The players will go back
to spending their football
time with strength and con
ditioning coach Shannon
Turley.
"Fhom now until we re
port," Shaw said, "[Turley] is
the program. He's it, and I
think he's phenomenal.
Every year, the guys we
need to get stronger get
stronger. The guys we need
to lose weight lose weight...
We come into training camp
flexible and healthy and
strong and explosive, and
that's what this session is
about."
