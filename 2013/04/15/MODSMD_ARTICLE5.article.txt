## RECEIVERS SHINE IN SPRING GAME 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
In some minds, Stanford's offense (Cardi

defense (White) as the Cardinal was up at
Oregon last November. But, displaying a sur

"and I saw the ball, [l] kind of reached out and
I was able to pull it back in."
Rector also recorded an 11-yard run on a
misdirection play. Coming out of a long half
time break, the second-string offense could
feel the starting defense licking its chops. The
