## Clayman teams with Lean In Partnership targets gender inequalities 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's Clayman Institute
for Gender Research has been
named the "founding educational
partner" of Lean In, a new non
profit championed by Facebook
COO Sheryl Sandberg that aims to
create a global support system
committed to encouraging women
to pursue and fulfill their ambi
tions.
Lean In seeks to encourage the
creation of "Lean In Circles," small
groups offering the opportunity to
discuss workplace issues like gen
der bias. The "Voice & Influence"
curriculum offered by the Clayman
Institute provides the basis for
those circles, expanding from its
origins as a local on-campus pro
gram restricted to a limited group
of Stanford and Silicon Valley facul
ty and professionals. Gina Bianchi
ni, Lean In's cofounder, introduced
Sandberg to the program.
As a result of the partnership,
the five "Voice & Influence" videos
are now available to the public for
free at Leanln.org. Current videos,
which are approximately 25 min
utes long and come accompanied by
discussion guides and curricula,
deal with negotiation, acting with
power, working in teams, telling
stories and removing bias from the
workplace.
According to Shelley Correll
M.A. '96 Ph.D. 'Ol, director of the
Clayman Institute, the videos have
been "very successful." As a con
servative assessment, Correll esti
mated that the videos have been
viewed over 20,000 times, making
the collaboration with Lean In "the
biggest we've done, for sure."
Lily Clausen M.A. 'lO, the Clay-
man Institute's media manager,
described the Institute's involve
ment with Lean In as "a very nat
ural relationship," since both enti
ties are committed to "empower
ing men and women to be their
best."
From the Institute's perspec
tive, the partnership with Lean In
brings a large and engaged audi
ence to the table, as well as the
technical experience to make con
tent available online.
"Lean In is becoming a house
hold name," Correll said. "It
opened the door to a conversation
we're always trying to have. Sec
ondly, being able to rely on their
expertise has been very helpful
they know how to do things on a
big scale."
Lean In, meanwhile, benefits
from the association with high
quality educational content.
"What they wanted is for
groups of women and men to have
discussions and be able to support
each other but you have to inter
act over something... and we have
some really good and credible con
tent," Correll emphasized.
That content incorporates ab
breviated versions of longer talks,
tailored to increase relevancy and
inspire watchers to apply lessons
learned and take action. Lori
Mackenzie, associate director at the
Clayman Institute, described the
videos in an email to The Daily as
unique because they focus "on sto
ries and shared experiences, not on
ly on the technology behind the ed
ucational experience."
Looking toward the future,
Mackenzie cited the Institute's
plans to generate further content
focused both on empowering
women in the workplace and en
abling managers to create a better
workplace.
"As a next step, we hope to cus
tomize the experience even more
based on where a person is in her
career or how managers can help
create level playing fields," she
wrote.
