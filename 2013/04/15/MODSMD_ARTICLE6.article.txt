## Clayman teams with Lean In Partnership targets gender inequalities 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's Clayman Institute
for Gender Research has been
named the "founding educational
partner" of Lean In, a new non
profit championed by Facebook
COO Sheryl Sandberg that aims to
create a global support system
committed to encouraging women
to pursue and fulfill their ambi
tions.
Lean In seeks to encourage the
creation of "Lean In Circles," small
groups offering the opportunity to
discuss workplace issues like gen
der bias. The "Voice & Influence"
curriculum offered by the Clayman
Institute provides the basis for
those circles, expanding from its
origins as a local on-campus pro
gram restricted to a limited group
of Stanford and Silicon Valley facul
ty and professionals. Gina Bianchi
ni, Lean In's cofounder, introduced
Sandberg to the program.
As a result of the partnership,
the five "Voice & Influence" videos
are now available to the public for
free at Leanln.org. Current videos,
which are approximately 25 min
utes long and come accompanied by
discussion guides and curricula,
deal with negotiation, acting with
power, working in teams, telling
stories and removing bias from the
workplace.
According to Shelley Correll
M.A. '96 Ph.D. 'Ol, director of the
Clayman Institute, the videos have
been "very successful." As a con
servative assessment, Correll esti
mated that the videos have been
viewed over 20,000 times, making
the collaboration with Lean In "the
biggest we've done, for sure."
