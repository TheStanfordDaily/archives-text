improvement of the planet through technology and development—which requires a free market in energy.
Bruce Nilles, director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign, will argue that fossil fuels are our
country's dirtiest energy source—from mining to burning to disposing of waste—and advocate for restrictions
on the use of fossil fuels.
