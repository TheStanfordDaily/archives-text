## Persevering through the Boston tragedy 
### Tom Taylor 
I wrote this week's column a day
early, sent it into my editors
and then, free of any important
distractions, sat down to work
on my thesis on Monday.
But then it happened. I'm sure you
all know this by no\y but yesterday,
several explosions tore through one of
the world's oldest and biggest sports
traditions, the Boston Marathon.
When I found out and I found
out late I had that sick feeling of
deja vu. It felt like July 7, 2005, all
over again.
That day, I had just gotten home
fi'om the gym and was sitting, having
breakfast, when news of explosions on
the London Underground first began
to spread. At first it seemed like there
may have been some sort of terrible
accident, but, bit by bit, the horrible
truth was pieced together. It was
weird, scary. Not because I felt per
sonally threatened the little vil
lage I was in was safely tucked out of
harm's way in the English country
side— but because I know a lot of
people who live and work in London
and others who head to town on a reg
ular basis.
Events in 2001 were obviously far,
far worse, but 9/11 was surreal. It was
a scene from a horrific movie, distant
and unbelievable. Too big and devas
tating to even comprehend.
Boston, like London, though, was
terrifyingly real, scarify believable.
Living, now, in America certainly
made events feel closer to home, but
also I know Boston. My best friend
moved to the United States when I
was in middle school, to Concord,
Mass. Every year I'd come out to vis
it, flying in to Boston's Logan Interna
tional Airport.
Worse, my cousin was there this
year, in the race.
We used to see each other at least
once a year, even after her family
moved to the United States. But then
life got in the way, and I haven't seen
her in over ten years. We're Facebook
Mends, of course, so I know she's tak
en up running in a pretty serious way,
but that's not the same. I miss hang
ing out.
Fortunately, though, she was al
ready back in her hotel room when
the first two explosions hit. She could
see smoke and pandemonium out the
window, but she was safe.
Others were not as lucky As I write
this, three people have been confirmed
dead, and more than 100 more are re
portedly injured. Many others in the
race, the city and across the world will
be shocked and saddened, too.
Right now, the exact cause is not
yet clear, nor is the suspicion that
someone could have been behind this,
but with two separate explosions near
the finish line, it is hard to imagine
that this wasn't a planned attack. Per
haps by the time you read this, the
facts will be clearer.
I've written about sports in the
face of tragedy before, about the hard
decision of whether to play on in the
face of such events. The next seven
days will bring that question sharply
into focus.
This Sunday the London
Marathon, an event every bit as big
and prestigious as the Boston
Marathon, will be held around the
streets of the United Kingdom's capi
tal. It's an annual festival that sits
close to my heart I've made it
across the finish line three times, once
dressed as a giant cat.
Organizers, now, are suitably con
cerned. Any large gathering of people
in a free society is inherently risky, be
cause freedom is not something that
can be policed. It is something that re
lies on the good-natured sanity of all
present. Changes seem inevitable, not
just to tighten up security but also to
show respect for those who weren't so
lucky yesterday.
But without question, London
must go on, as must the 2014 Boston
Marathon. The North American race
is the world's oldest marathon and has
been held continuously since 1897
not even two World Wars could inter
rupt it.
Because the best way—the only
way —to remember those we have
painfully lost and heal these mental
scars is not to give in. To give no quar
ter to those who might seek to destroy
our way of life through violence and
threats. To celebrate everything that
is good about sports and what it
means to live in a free and open socie
ty To play on.
