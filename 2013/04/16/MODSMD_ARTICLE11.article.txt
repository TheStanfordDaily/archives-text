# FINISHING STRONG
## Card grabs third at Western Intercollegiate 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's golf
team capped its regular season
with a third-place finish in the
Western Intercollegiate at the
Pasatiempo Golf Club in Santa
Cruz, Calif.
"We love going over there [to
Pasatiempo]," said head coach Con
rad Ray. "We've played there a
number of years, and Stanford has
a great tradition at the Western In
tercollegiate. This year we, we did
n't win the trophy, but we compet
ed well, and there's a lot of posi
tives to draw from the week."
The Western, which had golfers
play 36 holes on Saturday and 18
on Sunday, started off with rela
tively calm course conditions on
Saturday morning. Senior Andrew
Yun and junior Cameron Wilson
both posted 1-under-par 69s in the
morning round, leaving the Cardi
nal tied for fourth.
Conditions quickly deteriorat
ed, however, as high winds were
not kind to any team in Saturday
afternoon's frame. Even so, Stan
ford fared relatively well, shooting
a combined 16-over par as a team
in the second round to move into
third behind No. 5 UCLA and No.
ICal.
"The conditions were very
tough," Ray said. "We got off to a
nice start in round one, and then,
in round two, the wind blew and it
was very chilly over there yester
day [Saturday]. We struggled a lit
tle bit in the afternoon, but all the
scores were high."
"The wind was a big factor the
second round, as it was extremely
tough to judge distances," added
Yun on the blustery conditions.
"You have to do everything you
can possible before the shot to
map out your strategy. You really
can't control the outcome, but you
can control your preparation, and
that aspect is emphasized when
conditions get tough."
Defending tournament champi
on sophomore Patrick Rodgers,
relatively quiet on the first day of
the tournament, came storming
back in Sunday's final round. The
sophomore, sitting at tied for 23rd
in the individual standings after
Saturday, birdied all three par 5s
on Sunday to finish in a tie for

ninth. His 70-74-67 was nowhere
near his winning performance of
67-71-68 a year ago.
"Being the defending champion
only gave me some confidence go
ing in knowing that I have played
well on the golf course in the
past," Rodgers said. "Still, I need

ed to execute in order to repeat. I
struck the ball nicely this weekend
and gave myself enough opportu
nities to win. I just made too many
silly mistakes and needed a sharp
er short game to contend."
Rodgers' Sunday round was
the lone bright spot for Stanford,

which was leapfrogged by No. 6
Washington for third place. But
due to what Ray called a "surpris
ing and unfortunate" disqualifica
tion of Washington golfer Chris
Williams, the Huskies slipped to
fourth in the team standings with
the conclusion of the tournament.
Yun struggled in the third
round, shooting a 76 with five bo
geys and a double bogey. He was
not the only Cardinal golfer who
had the Sunday blues: freshman
David Boote, senior Steve Kear
ney, sophomore Patrick Grimes
and Yun combined to shoot 24-over
par on Sunday.
"I felt really good about my
overall play this weekend," Yun
said. "My driving has been a weak
ness all year, but I drove it beauti
fully here this past weekend. Iron
ically, I struggled a lot on the
greens, which is usually my strong
suit. But I am excited to see my
driving getting better and work
hard to get the putting back on
track."
Wilson, as steady as they come,
shook off a 4-over second round by
carding an even-par 70 in the final
round. In the hunt for a fourth
straight top-10 individual finish
until late in the tournament, he
nullified two early birdies with two
bogeys on the back nine.
"I played poorly this week,"
Wilson said. "I gave myself plenty
of birdie chances but didn't capital
ize nearly enough. I also made
three doubles and had five or six
three putts. It will always be hard
to contend while giving away that
many shots."
Cal, Golf Week's top-ranked col
legiate team, overtook UCLA on
Sunday with a 10-under 340 round
to finish 13 strokes in front of the
Bruins, 30 clear of Stanford and 34
ahead of Washington. All three
teams, plus No. 10 USC and No. 41
Oregon, should make for an ex
tremely competitive Pac-12 Tour
nament, which starts April 29 in
Los Angeles.
"We're excited to hopefully con
tinue the good play and good vibes
into the Pac-12 Tournament," Ray
said. "We're excited to try to go
down there and win. The last time
we won [the conference tourna
ment] was 1994, and we have some
work to do. It'll be a tough task, but
I think we're up for it and I know
the guys will be excited to go play
well."

67, but it was not enough to overcome a slow start. Rodgers,
the tournament's defending champion, finished in a tie for ninth.
