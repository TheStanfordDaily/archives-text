### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
No. 41 Stanford men's tennis
picked up two decisive victories
at home this weekend against
Arizona and No. 73 Utah, key
confidence boosters heading in
to the final week of regular sea
son play.

"Those were two tough
teams, and we went out there,
and we worked on the things
that we wanted to do, and we
implemented them during the
matches," said sophomore John
Morrissey. "We were pretty
happy with the progress and
the final result, but obviously
we know there is a lot more to
do in the coming weeks."
Stanford (10-9, 3-3 Pac-12)
pulled out a 6-1 win against Ari
zona (10-12, 0-6 Pac-12) on Fri
day afternoon, picking up indi
vidual victories in every match
except for No. 2 singles.
Juniors Jamin Ball and
Daniel Ho were first to finish
with an 8-4 win at No. 3 doubles,
followed by an 8-5 victory at
No. 2 doubles, where freshman

more Robert Stineman defeated
Arizona's Naoki Takeda and
Kieren Thompson.
The No. 1 doubles match was
abandoned because Stanford had
already won the doubles point.
Romanowicz was the first sin
gles player to finish, winning 6-4,
6-3 at No. 3 singles. Stineman,
who played No. 4 singles, and Ho,
who played No. 5 singles, finished
second and third, respectively,
with 6-3, 6-2 and 6-3, 6-4 victories
to clinch the team win.
Morrissey, who is currently
ranked thirty-ninth in the nation
at singles, beat Arizona's Kieren
Thompson 6-4, 6-1 at No. 1 sin
gles. Freshman Nolan Paige, the
nation's No. 103 singles player,
lost the only match of the day for
Stanford at No. 2 singles, with a
close 6-2,3-6, 7-5 loss to Arizona's
Frederik Ask.
Last to finish was freshman
Trey Strobel, who brought in a 6-7
(2), 6-2, 6-3 victory at No. 6 sin
gles.
"The team played pretty well
against Arizona. It was pretty
windy and the conditions really
weren't easy to deal with," Morris
sey said. "All the guys stepped up
and played really, really well, par
ticularly the back courts. They
were really solid."
The Cardinal picked up a 5-2
win against No. 73 Utah (11-11,1-
5 Pac-12) the following day. Stan
ford won the doubles point again
with victories at No. 1 doubles
from Morrissey and senior Denis
Lin and No. 2 doubles from Ro
manowicz and Stineman. The No.
3 doubles match was abandoned
after the Cardinal took the dou
bles point.

The team clinched the match
with three consecutive straight
set victories at No. 4, 6 and 1 sin
gles from Stineman, Strobel and
Morrissey.
"It's great to win both [of your

own] matches, but at the end of
the day, it's more important that
the team wins, so it's like an extra
bonus if you win your own match
es," Morrissey said. "It's great
just to contribute to the team
win."
Though the Cardinal had tak
en the match after those three vic
tories, the No. 2, 3 and 5 singles
players continued to battle. At No.
2 singles, Paige lost 3-6,6-4,1-0 (6)
to Utah's Slim Hamza, ranked just
ahead of Paige at No. 101.
Romanowicz picked up anoth
er point for the Cardinal with a 6-
4, 6-3 victory at No. 3 singles, and
Ho, the last to finish, fell 3-6, 6-3,
1-0 (9) at No. 5 singles.
The Cardinal will play No. 66
Pacific (13-6, 3-1 Big West) Tues
day at home in a non-conference
match before the last Pac-12
match of the season against No. 16
Cal (12-8,4-1 Pac-12).
The Pacific Tigers have won
three of their last four matches, all
against unranked opponents.
Stanford has a 5-0 series
record against Pacific and beat the
Tigers 7-0 last year, with all six
singles players winning in straight
sets.
"We expect them, just like Ari
zona and Utah, to be a tough, com
petitive team that, as all teams do,
play their best tennis against
Stanford because they are excited
to be here," Morrissey said. "We
are going to have to be ready for a
tough match."
After Cal, the Cardinal will
play at the Pac-12 Championships
in Ojai, Calif., in late April with
hopes of qualifying for the NCAA
Championships in May.
"We are looking at the NCAAs
in a few weeks, so we are trying to
build up towards that," Morrissey
said. "Stanford teams in the past
have always managed to do a
good job of peaking at the right
time, so the NCAA's are first
and foremost on our goals, but
we have to take it match by
match."
