As per usual, freshman Mariah
Stackhouse recorded a top-10 indi
vidual finish, anchoring the No. 11
Stanford women's golf team's
third-place-tie performance at the
PING/ASU Invitational in Tempe,
Ariz., this weekend. In the process,
the Cardinal defeated a long list of
Pac-12 foes in No. 1 USC, No. 8
UCLA, No. 13 Arizona State, No.
14 Washington, No. 43 Oregon and
No. 44 Cal.
"This was a terrific perform
ance for our team and the overall
program," head coach Anne Walk
er said. "We are improving each
week, and to finish third at ASU

shows that when we play well, we
can compete with the best teams in
the country"
Stackhouse, ranked No. 4 in
Golfweek's latest collegiate indi
vidual standings, roared out of the
gates in Friday's first round. She
carded four birdies on the back
nine her first nine of the day af
ter teeing off on the 10th tee
eventually finishing with a 2-under
70 on the Karsten Golf Course.
That left her tied for 11th individu
ally and put her team in ninth posi
tion.
Saturday saw Stackhouse start
even better than she did Friday.
She birdied her first three holes
and four of her first five to move to
6-under for tournament. By day's

end the freshman was in a three
way tie for third, one stroke off the
lead of eventual champion Emma
Talley of Alabama and Laetitia
Beck of Duke.
"Mariah is a very steady play
er," Walker said. "She is not too af
fected by what lies ahead or by
what has happened in the past. Of
course, she will take confidence
from this week but I think that
more than that, she will be focused
on how to get better this week for
next [week's Pac-12 Champi
onships]."
Not only did Stackhouse play
well on moving day, so did her
teammates. Fellow freshman Lau-
