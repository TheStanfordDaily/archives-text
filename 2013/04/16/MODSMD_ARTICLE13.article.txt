As per usual, freshman Mariah
Stackhouse recorded a top-10 indi
vidual finish, anchoring the No. 11
Stanford women's golf team's
third-place-tie performance at the
PING/ASU Invitational in Tempe,
Ariz., this weekend. In the process,
the Cardinal defeated a long list of
Pac-12 foes in No. 1 USC, No. 8
UCLA, No. 13 Arizona State, No.
14 Washington, No. 43 Oregon and
No. 44 Cal.
"This was a terrific perform
ance for our team and the overall
program," head coach Anne Walk
er said. "We are improving each
week, and to finish third at ASU

shows that when we play well, we
can compete with the best teams in
the country"
Stackhouse, ranked No. 4 in
Golfweek's latest collegiate indi
vidual standings, roared out of the
gates in Friday's first round. She
carded four birdies on the back
nine her first nine of the day af
ter teeing off on the 10th tee
eventually finishing with a 2-under
70 on the Karsten Golf Course.
That left her tied for 11th individu
ally and put her team in ninth posi
tion.
Saturday saw Stackhouse start
even better than she did Friday.
She birdied her first three holes
and four of her first five to move to
6-under for tournament. By day's

end the freshman was in a three
way tie for third, one stroke off the
lead of eventual champion Emma
Talley of Alabama and Laetitia
Beck of Duke.
"Mariah is a very steady play
er," Walker said. "She is not too af
fected by what lies ahead or by
what has happened in the past. Of
course, she will take confidence
from this week but I think that
more than that, she will be focused
on how to get better this week for
next [week's Pac-12 Champi
onships]."
Not only did Stackhouse play
well on moving day, so did her
teammates. Fellow freshman Lau-

Senior Sally Watson (above) led the Cardinal with a 1 -under 71 on Sunday to move Stanford into a third-place
tie with Arizona at the PING/ASU Invitational. Watson finished in 16th place at 2-under par.
ren Kim was 4-under
through nine holes and five
under going into the 153-
yard par-3 16th. That's
where things unraveled,
however, and Kim ended up
triple-bogeying the hole af
ter an errant tee shot. She
still finished the round at 2-
under 70, one stroke better
than her senior teammate
Sally Watson. Watson, the
lone senior in the lineup for
much of the year, had an up
and-down Saturday with five
birdies and four bogeys, en
trenching herself in a tie for
16th place going into Sun
day's final round.
"I was much happier with
how I played this weekend
than I have been the rest of
the season," Watson said. "I
learned a couple of good les
sons last week [winning at
the Sonoma State Spring In
vitational] about my game
and what I need to work on
in order to perform at my
best, and so I am really look
ing forward to the rest of the

season."
Overall, the team shot a
combined 6-under 282 in the
second round, vaulting from
ninth to a tie for third in the
team standings.
Sunday was a strange
day for the Cardinal. Stan
ford's two most consistent
golfers Stackhouse and
Kim fell off from their
performances in the first
two rounds, and the Cardi
nal instead relied upon Wat
son and sophomore Mariko
Tumangan. Watson notched
another 1-under 71 to lead
Stanford in the final round,
and Tumangan was not far
behind with an even-par 72
of her own. The sophomore
from San Jose, Calif.,
showed marked improve
ment over the course of the
tournament, going from a 9-
over-par performance on
Friday to a four-birdie round
on Sunday. She was 3-under
going into her final four
holes, but a bogey at 15 and
a double at 16 undid what
could have been an even bet
ter round.
Meanwhile, Stackhouse
finished with a 1-over 73 to
fall from tied for third to a
tie for fifth in the individual

standings. Kim's final round
3-over 75 again marred
by a triple bogey, this time at
the par-4 ninth dropped
her from 12th to a tie for
26th.
"I played solid this week
at ASU," Kim said. "I had
two blow-up holes num
ber 16 on Saturday and num
ber nine [Sunday] â€”that
were extremely disappoint
ing and were out of charac
ter for me. Besides those two
holes, though, I played really
well and am happy with
everything else in my
game."
The Pac-12 Champi
onships start next Monday
in Valencia, Calif. The tour
nament will feature nine top
-50 and four top-10 teams.
Walker believes that a sound
mental approach more than
anything else will propel her
team to an excellent per
formance.
"We have to keep work
ing on our belief in our
selves," she said. "The quote
'You have to see it to achieve
it' that is what we will be
working on."
