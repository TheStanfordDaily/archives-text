## THE
						NEW MAN Men Need to Be Mature 
### Chris Herries 
For the rest of the quarter, I'm
going to focus on my concep
tion of manliness in the mod
ern world. The title of the column is
going to be "The New Man." Essen
tially, I'd like to express my opinion
about the changing dynamic of mas
culinity in the modern world and
what it means to be a man.
For all the ladies and LGBTQlA
identified individuals about to put
down the paper: Fear not! People are
people, and most, if not all, the val
ues I'll outline in "The New Man"
will be mores I think all people can
aspire to. This column will not be
about buffalo wings, MMA or scant
ily clad women because, as far as
I'm concerned, they have little to do
with true manhood.
Defining manhood is a seemingly
impossible task, and anything put
forward here will be solely my opin
ion. The first point I want to make in
this column is that manhood is in ap
position, not opposition, to woman
hood. The qualities that make a
great man are, generally speaking,
the same qualities that make a great
woman. Manhood is not lifting heavy
weights, resorting to physical vio
lence, putting oneself in needless
danger or even growing a sick
beard. Real men deal in the honest
truth, despite the pain that brings.
Real men respect people from all
walks of life, despite differences. Re
al men are flexible, despite holding
true to their core values. Real men
are on time, committed, focused,
quick to help and slow to anger. The
same is true for real women.
Undoubtedly, people will wonder
why I'm writing about manhood and
not adulthood. The fact: I'm a het
erosexual male. Therefore, I feel I
can talk with authority about cur
rent conceptions of masculinity and
my qualms abut it, whereas I can't
talk about traditional femininity in
the same way. A lot of what this col
umn will deal with in the future has
to do with the self-discovery of man
hood. At no point, however, will I be
contrasting manhood to womanhood
in a negative light, because, frankly,
most of what I value in men are qual
ities I value in women as well.
Ultimately, manhood and wom
anhood stand opposed primarily to
childhood. The qualities I listed be
fore — honesty, respect, flexibility,
values, commitment and discipline
aren't things I'd expect to see in a
child. Children are dependent crea
tures. Either they haven't learned
these qualities or they choose not to
exercise them.
For some people, the latter point
choosing not to practice certain
qualities extends far beyond ado
lescence. Laundering money, cor
ruption, bribery, pursuit of self-in
terest, abuse or generally being a
dick are all things I've seen "adults"

do that, in fact, are just plain child
ish. It shows an inherent selfishness,
an unwillingness to play by the rules
and a disregard for the well-being of
others. Adults personify, or try to
personify, virtuous behaviors. Chil
dren do not. I'm not trying to hate on
little kids they are, after all, less
responsible for them actions but I
will hate on people who are too old to
act childish.
Less extreme examples exist on
campus too. We often fail to put
friends and people before our stud
ies; we neglect, willfully or not, peo
ple who are in crisis. We put too
much work on our plate and let the
quality of that work slide, where a
true man would recognize his limita
tions and be fully committed to any
endeavor. We'll show up late, get
lazy, party recklessly and be, or pre
tend to be, apathetic to important
campus issues. On a personal level,
I've seen friendships end, and I've
ended friendships, for childish rea
sons. The takeaway about manliness
from this first column: Men need to
be mature.
I'll end with a personal anecdote.
I received a ticket for rolling
through a stop sign on my bike.
Rather than be a man, accept the ci
tation and go to the class, I choose to
be sour to the officer and bitch about
the ticket to my friends. That's just
immature. I ended up going to the
safety class, which was fantastic.
They gave me two free lights, a hel
met and a greater understanding of
bike safety in less than an hour all
while expunging my citation!
If I had been more of a man about it,
I wouldn't have given lip to an officer
who was doing his job, and I would
n't have worked myself into a fit
about such a minor infraction. I'll be
more mature in the future.

Buffalo wings,
MMA or scantily
clad women have, as
far as I'm concerned,
little to do with true
manhood.
