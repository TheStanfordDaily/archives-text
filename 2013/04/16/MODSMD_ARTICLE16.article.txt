# In Defense of Michael Bloomberg
## 
### Taylor Brady 
When I first heard that
Michael Bloomberg would
be our graduation speaker
this year, I was offended. How dare
Stanford disrespect those graduat
ing in 2013 by slumming it with
some washed-up old businessman?
This week, though, hearing
many of Mayor Bloomberg's illus
trious accomplishments, I began to
change my mind. In fact, in the
course of my research, I have come
to the conclusion that, not only is
Bloomberg worthy to address us,
he also has something to offer for
each student in our diverse popu
lace, from Sigma Nu to Kappa Sig.
I'd like to explore those admirable
attributes below.
First and foremost, Mayor
Bloomberg is a man of business.
When he was fired from Salomon
brothers in 1981, he pulled himself
up by his bootstraps and founded
Bloomberg L.E Not only is Miguel
B. successful in business, he fits the
culture as well. As Michael Wolff
stated in this New York Magazine
article: "To be a good manager to
run a profitable enterprise not
only forgives but also justifies a
wide range of unrestrained, or even
unsocialized, behavior." And I
agree. As such, it is only fitting that
he indulges in the delightful misog
yny and homophobia characteristic
of businessmen, because, as many
have apologized, "that's just how
men in business talk."
Allow me to cite from "The
Portable Bloomberg: The Wit and
Wisdom of Michael Bloomberg," a
quotation booklet circulated to
Bloomberg L.E employees in cele
bration of his 48th birthday in 1990.
The very first: "Make the customer
think he's getting laid when he's
getting fucked." Another: To
Bloomberg, a competitor in busi
ness is always a "cokehead, woman
izing, fag."
One can only hope that he im
parts such wisdom during his com
pelling commencement address.
Bloomberg is also a champion of
women's rights. Three high-profile
sexual harassment suits against
him were all thrown out because of
lack of preponderance of the evi

dence. I mean, you know that old
adage about insanity: If something
fails once and you keep trying to
make it work, it's clearly the women
leveling the strikingly similar alle
gations against him who are off
their rocker and not the respected
member of the community who ha
rasses I mean, employs them.
Beyond this, Bloomberg has ve
hemently and candidly supported a
woman's right to choose, as in 1996
when he allegedly (though I have no
idea why he'd deny such an impas
sioned defense of women's rights)
told sales executive Sekiko Garri
son, "Kill it!" when she told him that
she was pregnant and going on ma
ternity leave. Cubic-zirconia clear
about his principles, unlike many
politicians, he reiterated, "Kill it!"
when Garrison prompted him to re
peat himself.
Finally, to Stanford women, an
other quote from "The Portable
Bloomberg": "If women wanted to
be appreciated for their brains,
they'd go to the library instead of to
Bloomingdale's." I have seen
women in the Stanford library. Er
go, they want to be appreciated for
their brains.
Prefer a more traditional role
for women in the workplace? Rest
assured that Mayor Bloomberg has
made sure that women returning
from maternity leave are denied
their full former job responsibilities
and opportunities for advancement
because, as any gynecologist will
tell you, bringing the miracle of life
into the world through your birth
canal significantly impairs a
femme's ability to perform on the
job. I'm talking 22-percent dumber,
and consequently, paid 22 cents for
each dollar earned by male counter
parts.
But wait, there's more:
Bloomberg stands for justice. In a
1998 deposition for Mary Ann Ol
szewski's sexual harassment case
against him, he stated that he
wouldn't believe that a rape allega
tion was genuine unless there was
"an unimpeachable third-party wit
ness." Because, as Bloomberg went
on to sagely note, "There are times
when three people are together."

Speaking of being a defender of
the law, Bloomberg is universally
lauded for his campaign to end gun
violence in the city. During his
tenure, violent crime has dropped
29 percent in the city, and I attrib
ute that completely to the fact that
90 percent of those stopped and
frisked are minorities.
Criticized for racial profiling,
Bloomberg retorted with a devas
tating axiom: "We look to see where
the crime is, and whatever the eth
nicity of that neighborhood is, that's
what it is." It's not like the police
can selectively patrol those neigh
borhoods or anything. Further
more, Bloomberg asserts that with
out the program, "5,600 people who
are alive today would be dead...
and an overwhelming number of
those would have been young black
and Hispanic men."
Dude's such a hero for taking on
the White Man's Burden. Why are
people of color complaining when
Bloomberg just wants them safe? If
they have nothing to hide, why not
bare it all? Bloomberg certainly
hasn't hypocritically hidden the re
sults of a polygraph test that he
took to corroborate his innocence in
a sexual harassment case.
Mayor Bloomberg, cognizant of
his infallible governance, even sac
rificed himself like any great Ro
man emperor for the good of the
Republic and changed the NYC
term-limit law to allow himself an
other four years to govern the city.
It is after this glorious campaign
that Mayor Bloomberg comes to
Stanford to deliver a dry, inoffen
sive speech, which is exactly what
I'd want, considering that most au
thors asked to speak would affront
the wrinkled members of the Board
of Trustees in the audience.
Bloomberg: crusader for racial
equality, apologist for the excesses
of neoliberalism and bane of the Big
Gulp I think you stand, 5 feet, 7
inches tall, for exactly what Stan
ford stands for. I welcome you with
open arms.

course of my research, I have come
to the conclusion that, not only is
Bloomberg worthy to address us,
he also has something to offer for
each student in our diverse popu
lace, from Sigma Nu to Kappa Sig.
I'd like to explore those admirable
attributes below.
First and foremost, Mayor
Bloomberg is a man of business.
When he was fired from Salomon
brothers in 1981, he pulled himself
up by his bootstraps and founded
Bloomberg L.E Not only is Miguel
B. successful in business, he fits the
culture as well. As Michael Wolff
stated in this New York Magazine
article: "To be a good manager to
run a profitable enterprise not
only forgives but also justifies a
wide range of unrestrained, or even
unsocialized, behavior." And I
agree. As such, it is only fitting that
he indulges in the delightful misog
yny and homophobia characteristic
of businessmen, because, as many
have apologized, "that's just how
men in business talk."
Allow me to cite from "The
Portable Bloomberg: The Wit and
Wisdom of Michael Bloomberg," a
quotation booklet circulated to
Bloomberg L.E employees in cele
bration of his 48th birthday in 1990.
The very first: "Make the customer
think he's getting laid when he's
getting fucked." Another: To
Bloomberg, a competitor in busi
ness is always a "cokehead, woman
izing, fag."
One can only hope that he im
parts such wisdom during his com
pelling commencement address.
Bloomberg is also a champion of
women's rights. Three high-profile
sexual harassment suits against
him were all thrown out because of
lack of preponderance of the evi

dence. I mean, you know that old
adage about insanity: If something
fails once and you keep trying to
make it work, it's clearly the women
leveling the strikingly similar alle
gations against him who are off
their rocker and not the respected
member of the community who ha
rasses I mean, employs them.
Beyond this, Bloomberg has ve
hemently and candidly supported a
woman's right to choose, as in 1996
when he allegedly (though I have no
idea why he'd deny such an impas
sioned defense of women's rights)
told sales executive Sekiko Garri
son, "Kill it!" when she told him that
she was pregnant and going on ma
ternity leave. Cubic-zirconia clear
about his principles, unlike many
politicians, he reiterated, "Kill it!"
when Garrison prompted him to re
peat himself.
Finally, to Stanford women, an
other quote from "The Portable
Bloomberg": "If women wanted to
be appreciated for their brains,
they'd go to the library instead of to
Bloomingdale's." I have seen
women in the Stanford library. Er
go, they want to be appreciated for
their brains.
Prefer a more traditional role
for women in the workplace? Rest
assured that Mayor Bloomberg has
made sure that women returning
from maternity leave are denied
their full former job responsibilities
and opportunities for advancement
because, as any gynecologist will
tell you, bringing the miracle of life
into the world through your birth
canal significantly impairs a
femme's ability to perform on the
job. I'm talking 22-percent dumber,
and consequently, paid 22 cents for
each dollar earned by male counter
parts.
But wait, there's more:
Bloomberg stands for justice. In a
1998 deposition for Mary Ann Ol
szewski's sexual harassment case
against him, he stated that he
wouldn't believe that a rape allega
tion was genuine unless there was
"an unimpeachable third-party wit
ness." Because, as Bloomberg went
on to sagely note, "There are times
when three people are together."

Speaking of being a defender of
the law, Bloomberg is universally
lauded for his campaign to end gun
violence in the city. During his
tenure, violent crime has dropped
29 percent in the city, and I attrib
ute that completely to the fact that
90 percent of those stopped and
frisked are minorities.
Criticized for racial profiling,
Bloomberg retorted with a devas
tating axiom: "We look to see where
the crime is, and whatever the eth
nicity of that neighborhood is, that's
what it is." It's not like the police
can selectively patrol those neigh
borhoods or anything. Further
more, Bloomberg asserts that with
out the program, "5,600 people who
are alive today would be dead...
and an overwhelming number of
those would have been young black
and Hispanic men."
Dude's such a hero for taking on
the White Man's Burden. Why are
people of color complaining when
Bloomberg just wants them safe? If
they have nothing to hide, why not
bare it all? Bloomberg certainly
hasn't hypocritically hidden the re
sults of a polygraph test that he
took to corroborate his innocence in
a sexual harassment case.
Mayor Bloomberg, cognizant of
his infallible governance, even sac
rificed himself like any great Ro
man emperor for the good of the
Republic and changed the NYC
term-limit law to allow himself an
other four years to govern the city.
It is after this glorious campaign
that Mayor Bloomberg comes to
Stanford to deliver a dry, inoffen
sive speech, which is exactly what
I'd want, considering that most au
thors asked to speak would affront
the wrinkled members of the Board
of Trustees in the audience.
Bloomberg: crusader for racial
equality, apologist for the excesses
of neoliberalism and bane of the Big
Gulp I think you stand, 5 feet, 7
inches tall, for exactly what Stan
ford stands for. I welcome you with
open arms.

When I first heard that
Michael Bloomberg would
be our graduation speaker
this year, I was offended. How dare
Stanford disrespect those graduat
ing in 2013 by slumming it with
some washed-up old businessman?
This week, though, hearing
many of Mayor Bloomberg's illus
trious accomplishments, I began to
change my mind. In fact, in the
course of my research, I have come
to the conclusion that, not only is
