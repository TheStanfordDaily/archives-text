### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's
tennis team lost just one indi
vidual match this weekend in
its quest to take down its
southwestern foes. In two
crucial Pac-12 matchups, the
No. 13 Cardinal (16-3, 8-1
Pac-12) first blanked No. 75
Arizona (9-12, 1-8 Pac-12) on
Friday. The momentum con
tinued through Saturday
when No. 21 Arizona State
(15-5, 5-4 Pac-12) fell to the
Cardinal 6-1.

Both matches saw the re
turn of junior co-captain
Nicole Gibbs, who is ranked
27th nationally in singles. At
the beginning of April, Gibbs
fell to Santa Clara's Katie Le
in an uncharacteristic loss.
She expressed slight frustra
tion with how she was play
ing and sat out in the follow
ing two matches against Ore
gon and Hawaii due to a mi
nor injury.
"I personally have just
been having a little difficulty
mentally and physically,"
Gibbs said. "I haven't physi
cally been where I want to be
in terms of what I need to put
in on the track and in the
weight room, as well as in
terms of injuries. Mentally, I
felt a little bit scared to lose.
I had a rough going at the LA
schools, so I thought I could
use a win in terms of my con
fidence."
Gibbs made her presence

known this weekend. Her re
turn meant that fellow junior
co-captain Kristie Ahn finally
had her doubles partner back
on court No. 1. The national
ly ranked No. 7 duo was the
first to finish, registering an
8-4 victory over Arizona's
Lacey Smyth and Shayne
Austin.
"It was great to have
[Gibbs] back and healthy,"
Ahn said. "She's been work
ing hard to get back to the
100 percent, and I think we
can all see that it's paying
off."
The women won the dou
bles point with an 8-6 victory
from sophomore Ellen Tsay
and senior Stacey Tan on
court No. 2 over Akilah
James and Kim Stubbe. Sen
ior co-captain Natalie Dillon
and freshman Krista Harde
beck fell on Court No. 3 to
Arizona's Susan Mc Rann
and Laura Oldham 8-5.
Gibbs came out strong in
singles, capturing the victory
against Arizona's Lacey
Smyth 6-3, 6-1 on Friday. The
rest of the lineup had similar
success. Tan was the first to
finish, delivering a 6-0, 6-2
blow to Arizona's Shayne
Austin. Tsay clinched the
match for the Cardinal when
she defeated Mc Rann. Ahn,
Hardebeck and Dillon posted
victories as well, propelling
the Cardinal to its third con
secutive shutout and its
eighth this season.
The Cardinal continued to
dominate with a swift defeat
of Arizona State on Saturday,
with doubles once again com
ing out strong. The
Gibbs/Ahn pairing recorded
an 8-3 win over the No. 34

team of Jacqueline Cako and
Nicole Smith. After Tan and
Tsay cruised past Joanna
Smith and Ebony Panoho 8-3
on court No. 2 to clinch the
doubles point, the third
match was abandoned with
Stanford ahead 7-4.
Gibbs had a slightly
tougher singles match
against the 16th-ranked
Cako in her second singles
match of the Cardinal's trip
to the desert. The match was
tighter; Cako even tied the
second set at 5-5. Gibbs
pulled out a sweep regard
less, capturing a straight set
victory with a 6-4, 7-5 win.
Ahn crushed Desirae
Krawczyk with a 6-0, 6-1 vic
tory. Hardebeck and Tsay al
so delivered straight-set
wins.
Tan and Dillon both strug
gled in long three-setters.
Tan was able to pull out a vic
tory in the end, defeating
ASU's Hannah James 3-6, 6-
4, 6-4. Dillon had an extreme
ly close match as well. She
came back to win the second
set after losing the first but
ended up falling to Panoho in
the end, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4.
The Cardinal will play its
last match of the season
against cross-town rival Cal
Friday. Stanford won the first
match against then-No. 9 Cal
6-1 at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium back on March 2.
But only Friday's match will
count in the Pac-12 stand
ings.
Friday's match is sched
uled to start at 12:30 p.m. in
Berkeley.
