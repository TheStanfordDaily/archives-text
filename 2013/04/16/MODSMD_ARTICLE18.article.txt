# SPORTS BRIEF
## Baseball faces Pacific in midweek road matchup 
### â€“ Sam Fisher 
Fresh off its third consecutive series win,
Stanford (19-11, 7-5 Pac-12) heads back on
the road Tuesday to take on Pacific (9-21, 2-7
Big West) in the first of two matchups be
tween the squads in 2013.
Stanford swept 2012's two-game series
with the Tigers, but Pacific fought hard to
protect its home turf. The Cardinal needed 11
innings to dispatch the Tigers, 9-7, in only the
fourth game of the season for both teams. In
the second matchup, this time at Sunken Dia
mond, Stanford coasted to an 8-3 victory.
Pacific comes into the contest on a four
game losing skid. The Tigers were swept by
UC-Riverside in a three-game conference se-

ries over the weekend, falling to 2-15 on the
road. But with a 6-5 home record, Pacific
could put a scare in the Cardinal once again.
Junior first baseman Erik Lockwood and
sophomore center fielder Tyler Sullivan lead
Pacific at the plate with averages of .336 and
.327, respectively.
The Tigers have been solid at the plate
throughout the season, averaging 4.2 runs per
game. But the pitching has been a struggle;
Pacific's team ERA sits at 5.66, higher than all
but one member of Stanford's entire pitching
staff.
Fielding has also been an issue for Pacific.
The Tigers have given up over one unearned
run per game through their first 30 contests.
First pitch Tuesday in Stockton, Calif., is
scheduled for 6 p.m.

Sunday performance in Stanford's 12-2 win as the Cardinal heads to Pacific for a midweek
matchup. Stanford swept the season series in 2012 but needed 11 innings to clinch
the road victory over the pesky Tigers. Stanford is 58-9-1 all-time against Pacific.
