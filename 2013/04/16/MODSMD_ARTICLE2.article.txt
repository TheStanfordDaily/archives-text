## Revived class explores modern love Ph.D. student teaches course about hookup culture, sex 
### RAE STABEN 
At a university populated with ambitious and
intellectual students, it can be difficult to find a
subject Stanford undergraduates haven't mas
tered yet. But what about a less-discussed topic:
love? Or perhaps even a more common experience
in college life: hookups?
Enter 50C123: Sex and Love in Modern Soci
ety, a class offered by the Department of Sociolo
gy that attempts to shed light on contemporary is
sues of sexuality and romance.
First taught in 2005 by former Professor of So
ciology Paula England as a means of researching
the college hookup culture, the class found a
broad and receptive audience among both sociolo
gy majors and the Stanford undergraduate com
munity at large due to its unique but simultane
ously relatable subject matter.
"I started the class the second semester I was
at Stanford, in the fall of 2005, in part because I
was interested in studying about the new hookup
culture and teaching about it," England said. "To
learn more about it myself, I had focus-group as
signments that students participated in and devel
oped an online survey [about hookup culture]."
Twenty-one universities participated in Eng
land's study, with the data collected still used in
research today.
When England left Stanford to work at New
York University in 2011, the class was discontin
ued until Alison Fogarty M.A. 'O9 Ph.D. 'l3, Eng
land's former research assistant and a current so
ciology doctoral student, took on the class this
quarter.
"I've restructured the course, updated the ma
terials and added in new topics," Fogarty empha
sized. "I have done a lot of modifying the course
since the days that Paula taught it."
Although Fogarty has developed a new cur
riculum and course structure based on England's
previous lectures, she noted that the general sub
ject matter of the class has been left untouched.
"We look at both sexual interactions as well as
relationships, and so we do cover quite a broad
amount of topics," she said.
Those topics include controversial items, like
sex positivity, pornography and the college
hookup culture. Still, Fogarty said that she in
tends to look at more widely accepted and often
common elements of contemporary sexuality, in
cluding homosexual relationships and same-sex
families, as well as the effects of cohabitation on
childbirth.
"We also look at things like American families
and how the demography of them has been chang
ing, covering topics like out-of-marriage child
birth and cohabitation," she added.
David Huynh 'l4, a member of Fogarty's class,
said he enrolled in the course purely out of inter
est in the often-taboo subject matter.
"Most of the topics are interesting, including
college hookup culture," he said. "There was a dis
claimer in class that there will be some touchy ma
terial discussed."
In order to respect student privacy, the class
has a policy that any personal expe
riences shared in class cannot be
shared elsewhere on the Farm or
anywhere else at all.
Still, Huynh conceded that the
intimate nature of such storytelling
made him uncomfortable at first.
"I think the only thing that made
me uncomfortable is that there is a
lot of personal story sharing,"
Huynh said. "People have been
through a 10t...1t shows you that
there is a lot out there. People do
some crazy things."
According to Fogarty, the class
used to be a lecture-style course with
over 100 students, which she has
since reduced to a mere 25 in order
to foster a more personalized experi
ence that also focuses with greater
depth on the assigned texts. For ex
ample, students write a short analy
sis about the readings or lecture for
each class period.
"When Paula was teaching it, it
was a huge class, so it was much
harder to have assignments like
that," Fogarty said. "I think it is real
ly important for the students to inte
grate the information and to have
that opportunity to reflect on how
the material is impacting them...
and so I think that, for me, is one of
the things I am most excited about
the course offering to students."
Although the class has just en
tered its third week, students like
Jackie Lee 'l4 said they have found
the novelty of discussing issues like
sex positivity to be eye opening.
"I've never heard about sex posi
tivity," Lee said, referencing the
course's first lecture, which was led
by renowned sex educator Charlie
Gliekman. "There should be more of
an open mindset for looking at sex. I
thought it was really interesting be
cause I've never thought about it

that way. I grew up in a very sex
negative mindset."
Lee said that she enrolled in the
class simply as a means of expanding
her knowledge about sexuality, a
subject her background prevented
her from analyzing to any great ex
tent.
"I thought it would be an inter
esting class to take because I came
from of a conservative Chinese cul
ture... and I'm also Catholic," Lee
said. "I'm going in with an open
mindset. I'm thinking of it more as a
learning experience."
Similarly, Huynh commented the
class has already impacted his life.
"Just from the first class analysis
that we did, it made me reflect on
how I can improve by becoming
more sex positive versus sex nega
tive," he said. "It made me more
knowledgeable and respectful of oth
er people, just in the first two class
es."
While Huynh and Lee entered
the class with little idea of what to
expect out of such discussions, Whit
ney Wells 'l2 M.A 'l3, a former em
ployee of the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center, joined Fogarty's
course as away of grappling with
these issues in her own life.
"I'm most excited to use the class
to discover any sex negativity in my
self," Wells said. "Before taking the
class, I hadn't considered studying
sex and love. Now I want to carry it
on as I go forward in my studies."
With such positive student feed
back, the class may be on its way to
once again becoming a Stanford sta
ple.
"Gender, sexuality, relationships
and love are topics that impact all of
us in our lives," Fogarty said. "Get
ting to understand the social process
es that are involved in structuring
the way that these things operate is
hugely important, both on a person
al level and on a sociological level."

er people, just in the first two class
es."
While Huynh and Lee entered
the class with little idea of what to
expect out of such discussions, Whit
ney Wells 'l2 M.A 'l3, a former em
ployee of the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center, joined Fogarty's
course as away of grappling with
these issues in her own life.
"I'm most excited to use the class
to discover any sex negativity in my
self," Wells said. "Before taking the
class, I hadn't considered studying
sex and love. Now I want to carry it
on as I go forward in my studies."
With such positive student feed
back, the class may be on its way to
once again becoming a Stanford sta
ple.
"Gender, sexuality, relationships
and love are topics that impact all of
us in our lives," Fogarty said. "Get
ting to understand the social process
es that are involved in structuring
the way that these things operate is
hugely important, both on a person
al level and on a sociological level."

At a university populated with ambitious and
intellectual students, it can be difficult to find a
subject Stanford undergraduates haven't mas
tered yet. But what about a less-discussed topic:
love? Or perhaps even a more common experience
in college life: hookups?
Enter 50C123: Sex and Love in Modern Soci
ety, a class offered by the Department of Sociolo
gy that attempts to shed light on contemporary is
sues of sexuality and romance.
First taught in 2005 by former Professor of So
ciology Paula England as a means of researching
the college hookup culture, the class found a
broad and receptive audience among both sociolo
gy majors and the Stanford undergraduate com
munity at large due to its unique but simultane
ously relatable subject matter.
"I started the class the second semester I was
at Stanford, in the fall of 2005, in part because I
was interested in studying about the new hookup
culture and teaching about it," England said. "To
learn more about it myself, I had focus-group as
signments that students participated in and devel
oped an online survey [about hookup culture]."
Twenty-one universities participated in Eng
land's study, with the data collected still used in
research today.
When England left Stanford to work at New
York University in 2011, the class was discontin
ued until Alison Fogarty M.A. 'O9 Ph.D. 'l3, Eng
land's former research assistant and a current so
ciology doctoral student, took on the class this
quarter.
"I've restructured the course, updated the ma
terials and added in new topics," Fogarty empha
sized. "I have done a lot of modifying the course
since the days that Paula taught it."
Although Fogarty has developed a new cur
riculum and course structure based on England's
previous lectures, she noted that the general sub
ject matter of the class has been left untouched.
"We look at both sexual interactions as well as
relationships, and so we do cover quite a broad
amount of topics," she said.
Those topics include controversial items, like
sex positivity, pornography and the college
hookup culture. Still, Fogarty said that she in
tends to look at more widely accepted and often
common elements of contemporary sexuality, in
cluding homosexual relationships and same-sex
families, as well as the effects of cohabitation on
childbirth.
"We also look at things like American families
and how the demography of them has been chang
ing, covering topics like out-of-marriage child
birth and cohabitation," she added.
David Huynh 'l4, a member of Fogarty's class,
said he enrolled in the course purely out of inter
est in the often-taboo subject matter.
"Most of the topics are interesting, including
college hookup culture," he said. "There was a dis
claimer in class that there will be some touchy ma
terial discussed."
In order to respect student privacy, the class
has a policy that any personal expe
riences shared in class cannot be
shared elsewhere on the Farm or
anywhere else at all.
Still, Huynh conceded that the
intimate nature of such storytelling
made him uncomfortable at first.
"I think the only thing that made
me uncomfortable is that there is a
lot of personal story sharing,"
Huynh said. "People have been
through a 10t...1t shows you that
there is a lot out there. People do
some crazy things."
According to Fogarty, the class
used to be a lecture-style course with
over 100 students, which she has
since reduced to a mere 25 in order
to foster a more personalized experi
ence that also focuses with greater
depth on the assigned texts. For ex
ample, students write a short analy
sis about the readings or lecture for
each class period.
"When Paula was teaching it, it
was a huge class, so it was much
harder to have assignments like
that," Fogarty said. "I think it is real
ly important for the students to inte
grate the information and to have
that opportunity to reflect on how
the material is impacting them...
and so I think that, for me, is one of
the things I am most excited about
the course offering to students."
Although the class has just en
tered its third week, students like
Jackie Lee 'l4 said they have found
the novelty of discussing issues like
sex positivity to be eye opening.
"I've never heard about sex posi
tivity," Lee said, referencing the
course's first lecture, which was led
by renowned sex educator Charlie
Gliekman. "There should be more of
an open mindset for looking at sex. I
thought it was really interesting be
cause I've never thought about it

that way. I grew up in a very sex
negative mindset."
Lee said that she enrolled in the
class simply as a means of expanding
her knowledge about sexuality, a
subject her background prevented
her from analyzing to any great ex
tent.
"I thought it would be an inter
esting class to take because I came
from of a conservative Chinese cul
ture... and I'm also Catholic," Lee
said. "I'm going in with an open
mindset. I'm thinking of it more as a
learning experience."
Similarly, Huynh commented the
class has already impacted his life.
"Just from the first class analysis
that we did, it made me reflect on
how I can improve by becoming
more sex positive versus sex nega
tive," he said. "It made me more
knowledgeable and respectful of oth
er people, just in the first two class
es."
While Huynh and Lee entered
the class with little idea of what to
expect out of such discussions, Whit
ney Wells 'l2 M.A 'l3, a former em
