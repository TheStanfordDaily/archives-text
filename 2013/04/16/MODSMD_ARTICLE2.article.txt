## Revived class explores modern love Ph.D. student teaches course about hookup culture, sex 
### RAE STABEN 
At a university populated with ambitious and
intellectual students, it can be difficult to find a
subject Stanford undergraduates haven't mas
tered yet. But what about a less-discussed topic:
love? Or perhaps even a more common experience
in college life: hookups?
Enter 50C123: Sex and Love in Modern Soci
ety, a class offered by the Department of Sociolo
gy that attempts to shed light on contemporary is
sues of sexuality and romance.
First taught in 2005 by former Professor of So
ciology Paula England as a means of researching
the college hookup culture, the class found a
broad and receptive audience among both sociolo
gy majors and the Stanford undergraduate com
munity at large due to its unique but simultane
ously relatable subject matter.
"I started the class the second semester I was
at Stanford, in the fall of 2005, in part because I
was interested in studying about the new hookup
culture and teaching about it," England said. "To
learn more about it myself, I had focus-group as
signments that students participated in and devel
oped an online survey [about hookup culture]."
Twenty-one universities participated in Eng
land's study, with the data collected still used in
research today.
When England left Stanford to work at New
York University in 2011, the class was discontin
ued until Alison Fogarty M.A. 'O9 Ph.D. 'l3, Eng
land's former research assistant and a current so
ciology doctoral student, took on the class this
quarter.
"I've restructured the course, updated the ma
terials and added in new topics," Fogarty empha
sized. "I have done a lot of modifying the course
since the days that Paula taught it."
Although Fogarty has developed a new cur
riculum and course structure based on England's
previous lectures, she noted that the general sub
ject matter of the class has been left untouched.
"We look at both sexual interactions as well as
relationships, and so we do cover quite a broad
amount of topics," she said.
Those topics include controversial items, like
sex positivity, pornography and the college
hookup culture. Still, Fogarty said that she in
tends to look at more widely accepted and often
common elements of contemporary sexuality, in
cluding homosexual relationships and same-sex
families, as well as the effects of cohabitation on
childbirth.
"We also look at things like American families
and how the demography of them has been chang
ing, covering topics like out-of-marriage child
birth and cohabitation," she added.
David Huynh 'l4, a member of Fogarty's class,
said he enrolled in the course purely out of inter
est in the often-taboo subject matter.
"Most of the topics are interesting, including
college hookup culture," he said. "There was a dis
claimer in class that there will be some touchy ma
terial discussed."
