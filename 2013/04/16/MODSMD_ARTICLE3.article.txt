# Suites to remain student-run
## Negotiations between ResEd and students lead to compromise 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Suites Eating Clubs will remain a stu
dent-run entity next year, an outcome re
flecting a series of weekly negotiations be
tween Residential Education (ResEd) offi
cials, Suites residents and Governor's Cor
ner Dining Societies (GCDS) leadership.
ResEd had initially planned to contract
out the eating clubs' operations to an outside

vendor, a decision that met with extensive
student and community criticism and even
the formation of an endorsing group to ad
vance greater student autonomy through
the ASSU.
Nate Boswell '99 M.A. 'O9, associate dean
of ResEd, confirmed that Suites will be al
lowed a student CEO, CFO and eight stu
dent managers next year, as well as retain
ing the option to rehire the current four
chefs. Applications for student leadership

positions are currently being reviewed.
The negotiations also resulted in the deci
sion to create a board of directors to oversee
Suites. That board will most likely include
former eating club managers, CEOs, CFOs,
members of the ASSU and a University rep
resentative.
Boswell said that the conversation on
Suites' leadership structure is ongoing and

will reflect the input of vari
ous University offices beyond
Res Ed.
"This new entity... will be
stronger and more set up to
exist for a very long time be
cause this has been a rigorous
process [and] because it's
been hard at times," Boswell
said.
Traditionally, Suites lead
ers would have selected the
incoming CEO, CFO and stu
dent managers by the end of
winter quarter before train
ing them throughout spring
quarter and undertaking the
transition by the end of the
school year.
Miles Unterreiner 'l2
M.A. 'l3, a Daily staffer and
Suites resident, credited the
response to his long-form ar
ticle in The Daily as providing
the impetus for successful ne
gotiations.
"I was blown away by the
response of the rest of the
community at Stanford be
cause when I published the
article, initially I thought it
was going to be a Suites issue
and that Suites people would
be upset but no one else
would really care," Unter
reiner said.

Unterreiner added that
the breadth of support from
across campus, including
alumni, and Res Ed's open
ness to negotiations made the
movement to retain student
management at Suites a
unique success.
"This is the first time in
memory, that I can remem
ber, that students have really
made their voices heard and
they've been listened to so
quickly and in such a compre
hensive manner," Unterrein
er said.
Boswell attributed the re
versal of Res Ed's decision to
a variety of reasons, including
suggestions from Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
to sit down with students and
reach a mutually agreeable
decision while acknowledging
adjusted University expecta
tions.
"Our orientation is that of,
'Okay, you want independ
ence, it is important to you...
you've got to earn it,"'
Boswell said.
He added that the negoti
ations over the last few weeks
went well.
"We're in a very different
place now than we were two
years ago," Boswell said.
"Some of that is because of ef
forts we put in, and some of
that is because of the student
voice and what Miles [Unter
reiner] has said and done

whether or not I always agree
with it."
Suites residents will cur
rently not be offered positions
as hashers next year, though
Unterreiner said that may
change.
"I think that's important
but it's a detail that can be
worked out in the future,"
Unterreiner said.
Fully restoring Suites' in
dependence will also require
the creation of a federal and
state tax ID number by Au
gust in order to operate as an
incorporated vendor on cam
pus, in a process that Unter
reiner described as expen
sive.
Viraj Bindra 'l5, chair of
the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate Student Life Com
mittee and a Suites resident,
has coordinated discussions
within the Senate and its Ap
propriations Committee
geared towards financially
supporting Suites' efforts.
"While the Undergradu
ate Senate has not definitive
ly decided to what degree it
will support [GCDSI's efforts
to get a federal tax ID, we are
exploring a few different av
enues and should have an up
date in the near future,"

stronger and more set up to
exist for a very long time be
cause this has been a rigorous
process [and] because it's
been hard at times," Boswell
said.
Traditionally, Suites lead
ers would have selected the
incoming CEO, CFO and stu
dent managers by the end of
winter quarter before train
ing them throughout spring
quarter and undertaking the
transition by the end of the
school year.
Miles Unterreiner 'l2
M.A. 'l3, a Daily staffer and
Suites resident, credited the
response to his long-form ar
ticle in The Daily as providing
the impetus for successful ne
gotiations.
"I was blown away by the
response of the rest of the
community at Stanford be
cause when I published the
article, initially I thought it
was going to be a Suites issue
and that Suites people would
be upset but no one else
would really care," Unter
reiner said.

Unterreiner added that
the breadth of support from
across campus, including
alumni, and Res Ed's open
ness to negotiations made the
movement to retain student
management at Suites a
unique success.
"This is the first time in
memory, that I can remem
ber, that students have really
made their voices heard and
they've been listened to so
quickly and in such a compre
hensive manner," Unterrein
er said.
Boswell attributed the re
versal of Res Ed's decision to
a variety of reasons, including
suggestions from Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
to sit down with students and
reach a mutually agreeable
decision while acknowledging
adjusted University expecta
tions.
"Our orientation is that of,
'Okay, you want independ
ence, it is important to you...
you've got to earn it,"'
Boswell said.
He added that the negoti
ations over the last few weeks
went well.
"We're in a very different
place now than we were two
years ago," Boswell said.
"Some of that is because of ef
forts we put in, and some of
that is because of the student
voice and what Miles [Unter
reiner] has said and done

whether or not I always agree
with it."
Suites residents will cur
rently not be offered positions
as hashers next year, though
Unterreiner said that may
change.
"I think that's important
but it's a detail that can be
worked out in the future,"
Unterreiner said.
Fully restoring Suites' in
dependence will also require
the creation of a federal and
state tax ID number by Au
gust in order to operate as an
incorporated vendor on cam
pus, in a process that Unter
reiner described as expen
sive.
Viraj Bindra 'l5, chair of
the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate Student Life Com
mittee and a Suites resident,
has coordinated discussions
within the Senate and its Ap
propriations Committee
geared towards financially
supporting Suites' efforts.
"While the Undergradu
ate Senate has not definitive
ly decided to what degree it
will support [GCDSI's efforts
to get a federal tax ID, we are
exploring a few different av
enues and should have an up
date in the near future,"
Bindra wrote in an email to
The Daily.
