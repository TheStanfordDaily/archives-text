## Professor to lead BRAIN committee 
### KATIE KRAMON 
Professor of Neurobiology William
Newsome has been selected as a co-chair
of the planning committee for the Brain
Research Through Advancing Innovative
Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) project, an
initiative created by President Barack
Obama to shape the future of neuro
science in America.
Over $lOO million has already been
pledged to the initiative through the Na
tional Institutes of Health (NIH), Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA), National Science Foundation
and several other companies, foundations
and research institutions in the private
sector.
"As humans, we can identify galaxies
light years away, we can study particles
smaller than an atom, but we still haven't
unlocked the mystery of the three pounds
of matter that sits between our ears,"
Obama said when he announced the initia
tive at the White House on April 2.
Newsome and his co-chair, Cori
Bargman of Rockfeller University, will
work with 13 other committee members in
planning the project. Two of these mem
bersâ€” Associate Professor of Biology
and Applied Physics Mark Schnitzer and
Professor of Bioengineering and of Psy
chiatry and Behavioral Sciences Karl
Deisseroth Ph.D. '9B M.D. 'OO M.F. 'O3
are also from Stanford.
The committee has been charged with
establishing a timeline, estimating a
budget and setting goals for the BRAIN
initiative, which has the ultimate objective
of mapping the brain's 100 billion neurons
and diagramming the connections that
run between these neurons.
"It will be a lot of work," Newsome
said about the project. "I don't need it, but
it's a really important moment in brain
science, how we study it and treat it and
how we deal with disease."
Newsome said that he became in
volved in the project a month ago, when
NIH Director Francis Collins "called him
out of the blue." Collins told Newsome
that the Obama administra
tion was going to devote it
self to a brain-mapping ini
tiative that needed a plan
ning committee to meet over
the summer.
After considering the of
fer for a day, Newsome said
that he "decided to jump in,"
describing the project as
bold and exciting but also
"grounded in scientific reali
ty." According to Newsome,
America is at a critical
threshold in brain science
research, partially due to the
recent development of tech
nology that Newsome sees
as game changing.
"Neuroscience has made
a lot of steady progress over
the last 50 years, but we
stand at a major turning
point because there are new
technologies that have been
invented to provide us with
data that never seemed pos
sible ten years ago," New
some said.
According to Newsome,
some of these technologies
will allow scientists to create

a circuit diagram of the
brain, which he compared to
"opening up a road atlas and
seeing how the different
cities, or parts of the brain,
are connected to each other."
Another recently devel
oped process, called CLARI
TY, was pioneered at Stan
ford. The CLARITY process
turns the brain's lipids into
transparent hydrogel, let
ting researchers examine
the brain's structure and
more clearly map the con
nections between neurons.
"Knowing where the
roads are is not enough
we want to know what is on
the road, not just connectivi
ty, but activity," Newsome
said. "We used to record the
activity of one neuron at a
time. Now we can do thou
sands."
Newsome also mentioned
the importance of optogenet
ic technology, which was in
vented in Deisseroth's lab at
Stanford in 2005. This tech
nology allows researchers to
make certain circuits of neu
rons react together by excit
ing them with stimuli such as
light, which can lead to a bet
ter understanding of how to
manipulate brain activity.
According to Newsome,

these new technologies put
neuroscience "on the verge
of massively more sophisti
cated datasets on how the
brain works."
Newsome said that the
BRAIN committee hopes to
"step on the gas pedal" and
believes that focusing on the
interaction between new
technology and neuroscience
will result in a major shift in
the way that researchers un
derstand the functioning of
the brain.
One of the team's ulti
mate goals is to accelerate
the base of discovery sur
rounding the brain in away
that could contribute to the
eventual discovery of cures
for neurological disorders
like autism, Parkinson's dis
ease, Alzheimer's and schiz
ophrenia.
Collins described previ
ous studies of the brain as
comparable to "listening to
the string section of an or
chestra and trying to figure
out what the whole orchestra
sounds like" and expressed
hope that the BRAIN com
mittee will be able to provide
a more complete picture.
