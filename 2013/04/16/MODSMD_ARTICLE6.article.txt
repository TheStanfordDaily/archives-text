## Professor to lead BRAIN committee 
### KATIE KRAMON 
Professor of Neurobiology William
Newsome has been selected as a co-chair
of the planning committee for the Brain
Research Through Advancing Innovative
Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) project, an
initiative created by President Barack
Obama to shape the future of neuro
science in America.
Over $lOO million has already been
pledged to the initiative through the Na
tional Institutes of Health (NIH), Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA), National Science Foundation
and several other companies, foundations
and research institutions in the private
sector.
"As humans, we can identify galaxies
light years away, we can study particles
smaller than an atom, but we still haven't
unlocked the mystery of the three pounds
of matter that sits between our ears,"
Obama said when he announced the initia
tive at the White House on April 2.
Newsome and his co-chair, Cori
Bargman of Rockfeller University, will
work with 13 other committee members in
planning the project. Two of these mem
bersâ€” Associate Professor of Biology
and Applied Physics Mark Schnitzer and
Professor of Bioengineering and of Psy
chiatry and Behavioral Sciences Karl
Deisseroth Ph.D. '9B M.D. 'OO M.F. 'O3
are also from Stanford.
The committee has been charged with
establishing a timeline, estimating a
budget and setting goals for the BRAIN
initiative, which has the ultimate objective
of mapping the brain's 100 billion neurons
and diagramming the connections that
run between these neurons.
"It will be a lot of work," Newsome
said about the project. "I don't need it, but
it's a really important moment in brain
science, how we study it and treat it and
how we deal with disease."
Newsome said that he became in
volved in the project a month ago, when
NIH Director Francis Collins "called him
out of the blue." Collins told Newsome
