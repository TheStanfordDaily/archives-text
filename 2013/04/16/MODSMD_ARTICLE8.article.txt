## Recent grad helps pioneer competitor to Google Glass 
### KIANA HUI 
For Jon Rodriguez 'l2, a computer science
honor thesis was more than just an academic
exercise. Instead, it was the launching pad for
Epiphany Eyewear, alternative reality eye
glasses set to compete against Google Glass.
Rodriguez co-founded Vergence Labs, the
company behind the glasses, in 2011 with Er
ick Miller. Rodriguez said that he spent his en
tire senior year working on the technology be
hind the eyeglasses, quitting an internship at
Facebook to devote more time to his new com
pany.
Epiphany Eyewear offers a general-pur
pose computer that can share photos on social
media sites and live stream video on Facebook,
as well as sunglass lenses that can be turned on
and off with a simple button.
According to Rodriguez, Epiphany Eye
wear differs from Google Glass in the product's
subtle nature.
"The puipose of the glasses is to be an in
creasingly powerful computer inside a regular,
stylish eyewear," Rodriguez said. "Our soft
ware is designed to maximize potential for soft
ware integration, particularly social networks."
David Meisenholder M.S. 'l3, a member of
the Vergence Labs team, said that the glasses'
style is an integral aspect of the product.
"We're hoping to keep hitting the style on
the head, making it a real fashion product
rather than a consumer electronic," Meisen
holder said.
Eric Smalls 'l6, an intern with Vergence
Labs who helped incorporate robotics into the
glasses, identified a different corporate philos
ophy from that encountered at Google.
"The vision of the team is very different
from Google Glass. It's definitely more person
al and focused on the users," Small said.
While the Vergence Labs team expressed
optimism that the glasses will offer a viable al-

ternative to Google Glass, critics have contend
ed that Epiphany Eyewear offers limited capa
bilities, citing the lack of a display to watch
recorded videos and the omission of more ad
vanced features like the ability to access
Google Apps.
However, the team said that they plan on
releasing annual updates to the glasses, adding
new components like the ability to incorporate
prescriptions and, eventually, to program the
glasses to allow students to take notes or
record audio of a lecture or allow a golfer to
watch a playback of his swing from a friend's
pair of glasses.
"I think there's great potential in the dis
plays we're researching to absolutely erase the
lines between virtual reality and real reality,"
Rodriguez said.
The glasses are currently available for pre
order, with Rodriguez estimating that they will
be ready for purchase by the end of summer
2013. Google Glass is expected to be made
available to the public in late 2013.
The Vergence Labs team emphasized Stan
ford's influence on the glasses' development,
with Rodriguez noting that the Stanford De
sign Program's "strong focus on thinking out
side of the box" played a large role in the prod
uct's design.
Meisenholder added that he is "always
stabbing the alumni network for information
on manufacturing and design and getting feed
back from the alumni of [his] program."
Smalls agreed that Stanford connections
have been an integral part of the company's
success.
"[The company's] relationship with Stan
ford is very important because it brings people
to the team who are motivated and excited
about working on really cool things," Smalls
said.
