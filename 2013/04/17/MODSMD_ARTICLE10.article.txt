## No. 9 Stanford heads to NCAAs 
### Conor Scherer STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team is one of 12 competing in
the NCAA Championships this
weekend in Pauley Pavilion at
UCLA. After earning second place
at the Regional Championships on
April 6 finishing just a few
tenths of a point behind Oklahoma
the Cardinal was given the No. 9
seed heading into this weekend's
competition. One advantage the
Cardinal has, however, is plenty of
experience heading into the Cham
pionships. This will mark the sixth
time in seven years that Stanford
will be hunting for the national title.
The team tournament is broken
up into two separate days. On Fri
day at noon, Stanford will compete
in the first of two semifinal rounds.
Along with Stanford, the other
teams included in its semifinal are
top-seeded Florida, No. 4 Georgia,
No. 5 LSU, No. 8 Minnesota and
No. 12 Illinois. In the second of the
semifinal rounds are No. 2 Oklaho
ma, No. 3 Alabama, No. 6 UCLA,
No. 7 Michigan, No. 10 Utah and
No. 11 Arkansas. To advance to
Saturday's competition, the Super
Six, Stanford needs to finish in the
top three in its group, as three
teams from each semifinal advance
to the final round. While this may
seem like a daunting task as a No. 9
seed, the Cardinal has shown that it
can defy expectations; last year the
team was ranked No. 10 and ulti
mately advanced to the Super Six,
finishing fourth in the nation.
Of the teams in its semifinal
group, this season the Cardinal has
faced both Illinois, which it defeat
ed 196.025-193.750 in a quad meet
on Jan. 12, and Georgia, which beat
Stanford 197.000-195.400 on a Jan.
21 contest. However, the loss to the
Bulldogs was just Stanford's third
of the season, and the team has
lived up to its mantra of focusing on
improving since then. The team
score of 195.400 was its worst score
of the season, and in each of the
past eight competitions heading in
to the Championships, the Cardinal
has scored at least 196.000 points.
In order to place in the top three
of its group, Stanford will need to
build on its recent success and put
together one of the team's strongest

performances of the season. This
will take an all-around effort, but
the team will look to its AU-Ameri
cans to lead the way. On Sunday,
three Cardinal gymnasts received
AU-American honors: junior Aman
da Spinner received First Team
honors in beam, while senior Ash
ley Morgan (floor) and sophomore
Ivana Hong (beam) both received
Second Team honors.
Hong is coming off individual ti
tles on beam and vault in the Re
gional Championships, though after
the meet expressed that her team's

success was more important to her
than individual accolades. Heading
into this weekend's competition,
she will give the Cardinal a good
chance to succeed if she performs
at her maximum potential.
"Qualifying for NCAAs is al
ways exciting and we've got even
more potential than we've shown,
so I'm thrilled to continue this sea
son with this amazing group of
girls," Hong said.
If the Cardinal advances to the
Super Six, it will compete at 4 p.m.
on Saturday for the national title.

Once all team competitions are
wrapped up, the top four individu
als in each event from the semifi
nals will then compete on Sunday
with hopes of earning individual
honors. Last year, sophomore Sam
Shapiro represented Stanford well
by earning second place nationally
in uneven bars. But the team has
much bigger goals this weekend, as
it hopes to return to the Farm with
the national title.
