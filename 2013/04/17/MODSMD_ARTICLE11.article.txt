## Gaels visit the Farm tonight 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
After easily dispatching San Jose
State last week, No. 15 Stanford (28-12,
5-7 Pac-12) returns to action Wednesday
night to face off against the Saint Mary's
Gaels (16-26, 8-8 PCSC). The Cardinal
enters Wednesday's contest in fine form,
having won its last Pac-12 game against
No. 3 Arizona State a week and a half
ago before routing the Spartans last
Wednesday. The Card will also be well
rested against Saint Mary's, as the team
enjoyed a bye from conference play this
past weekend.
On paper, Wednesday's game figures
to be a mismatch in favor of the Cardinal.
In the history of the program, Stanford
owns a 29-6 record, or a .829 winning
percentage, against its local rivals from
Moraga. The Gaels have also struggled
mightily on the road this season, posting
a 2-9 record away from home this season.
Saint Mary's lone road wins have come
against Santa Clara and lowly Sacra
mento State.
In particular, Saint Mary's has had
major problems generating any offense.
The Gaels are hitting only .194 on the
season, with only one player batting
above .240. Saint Mary's offensive out
put has been entirely dependent upon
senior Megan Smith; the Rolling Hills
Estates, Calif, native has driven in over
25 percent of the Gaels runs while hitting
a team-best .315 at the plate. Smith also
leads the team in slugging and on-base
percentages.
Outside of Smith, sophomore Sarah
Lira has provided the Gaels with a bit of
power, as the Gilroy product paces her
team with five home runs; her 19 RBI
are second behind Smith. However, in
PCSC play, neither Lira nor the rest of
her Saint Mary's teammates have faced
as dominant of a pitcher as Stanford's
