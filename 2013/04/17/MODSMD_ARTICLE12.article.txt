# COMEBACK FOR CARD
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
After opening its inaugural
season with a decisive 4-1 win
over Santa Clara earlier this
month, the Stanford women's
sand volleyball team has experi
enced great success with a
record of 4-1. Yesterday's 3-2 win
over Pacific also ensured that it
would head into its own Stanford
Tournament this Sunday and
the remaining four games of the
season with momentum.
The Card downed Santa
Clara in its match last week in its
first program sweep, 5-0. The
new number one pairing of jun
ior Carly Wopat and freshman
Brittany Howard led the team.
They combined for 25 kills, 25
digs and seven aces. Howard re
placed freshman Jordan Burgess
in the No. 1 spot after her im-

"Carly had played well with
Jordan, we just did [the change]
to kind of switch things up and
see, and [junior] Rachel
[Williams] and Jordan have won
their last two matches together,
so it's worked out really well,"
said Stanford head coach John
Dunning.
The Card lost the following
match to Saint Mary's soon after
however, 4-1 it's first and only
loss of the season.
Stanford narrowly beat Pacif
ic 3-2 last night, though. After its
dominating display the second

time against Santa Clara last
week, the team kept the same
pairings. The Card took the first
match of the day 2-0 with fresh
man Inky Ajanaku and junior
Mary Ellen Luck. The duo re
mains undefeated on the season.
However, sophomore Morgan
Boukather and freshman Megan
McGehee, along with freshman
Maddi Bugg and sophomore
Kyle Gilbert dropped both their
matches to put Pacific up 2-1
heading into the final matches of
the night.
No. 2 duo Williams and
Burgess swept their match to tie
it with the Tigers, leaving the
fate of the contest to No. 1 Wopat
and Howard.
"[We knew] if we win this, we
win as a team," Howard said. "If
we lose this, we lose as a team. So

pressive display in the Card's 3-2
win over Sacramento State.

there's always pressure
overall but we just wanted to
win, that's what we were fo
cusing on, not the overall
outcome."
After losing the first set,
the Card rallied to steal the
second. The communication
between the rookie Howard
and beach volleyball veteran,
Wopat, was instrumental in
their comeback.
"Carly and I felt that af
ter the first time we played
[together], we had this really
great sixth sense of where
the other person was, so we
covered the court really

well," Howard said. "I felt
that we were very much in
sync."
Howard and Wopat start
ed the final set on a 4-0 run.
Pacific kept the game close,
capitalizing on short and
deep shots and the set went
down to the wire with the
Card eventually taking the
win 15-13.
With only a couple of
weeks of practice under its
belt prior to the start of the
season, the team has come
together quickly to establish
itself in the young sport.
"This was a fun match be
cause we got behind and had
to come back," Dunning said.
"So they were feeling the
pressure and the last couple
teams had to win the match
so that's a fun situation to

get in, and we handled it re
ally well."
It is expected that once
Stanford starts recruiting
specifically for sand volley
ball instead of having the
crossover with indoor volley
ball players the Card will
have a top-notch program
experiencing success compa
rable to that of the highly
touted indoor volleyball
team.
For now though, the play
ers accustomed to playing
indoors almost year-round
get a break from the monot
ony of off-season training
while enjoying the fresh air
and keeping the competitive
spirit alive in the sand.
