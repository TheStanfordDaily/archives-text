# COMEBACK FOR CARD

### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
After opening its inaugural
season with a decisive 4-1 win
over Santa Clara earlier this
month, the Stanford women's
sand volleyball team has experi
enced great success with a
record of 4-1. Yesterday's 3-2 win
over Pacific also ensured that it
would head into its own Stanford
Tournament this Sunday and
the remaining four games of the
season with momentum.
The Card downed Santa
Clara in its match last week in its
first program sweep, 5-0. The
new number one pairing of jun
ior Carly Wopat and freshman
Brittany Howard led the team.
They combined for 25 kills, 25
digs and seven aces. Howard re
placed freshman Jordan Burgess
in the No. 1 spot after her im-

"Carly had played well with
Jordan, we just did [the change]
to kind of switch things up and
see, and [junior] Rachel
[Williams] and Jordan have won
their last two matches together,
so it's worked out really well,"
said Stanford head coach John
Dunning.
The Card lost the following
match to Saint Mary's soon after
however, 4-1 it's first and only
loss of the season.
Stanford narrowly beat Pacif
ic 3-2 last night, though. After its
dominating display the second

time against Santa Clara last
week, the team kept the same
pairings. The Card took the first
match of the day 2-0 with fresh
man Inky Ajanaku and junior
Mary Ellen Luck. The duo re
mains undefeated on the season.
However, sophomore Morgan
Boukather and freshman Megan
McGehee, along with freshman
Maddi Bugg and sophomore
Kyle Gilbert dropped both their
matches to put Pacific up 2-1
heading into the final matches of
the night.
No. 2 duo Williams and
Burgess swept their match to tie
it with the Tigers, leaving the
fate of the contest to No. 1 Wopat
and Howard.
"[We knew] if we win this, we
win as a team," Howard said. "If
we lose this, we lose as a team. So

pressive display in the Card's 3-2
win over Sacramento State.
