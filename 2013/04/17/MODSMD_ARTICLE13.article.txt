## OP-ED Refusing to Discuss Divestment is Divisive 
### JASON KAUFMAN '14 
As Israel Day is celebrated on
campus this week, my
thoughts turn to the events of
last quarter, as the Jewish Student
and Students for Palestinian Equal
Rights email lists were bombarded
with emails about the senate hear
ings on divestment. During these
online conversations, I was specifi
cally troubled by the fact that out of
all the messages sent over both
lists, only one email overlapped be
tween them. This email, forwarded
from SPER to the Jewish chat list,
was quickly met with opposition,
and ultimately the conversation was
moved to a separate discussion list.
I have spent the past three years
at Stanford engaged, with varying
levels of involvement, with different
on-campus communities that deal
with the Israel/Palestine conflict. I
have also participated in several
one-on-one discussions with mem
bers of Hillel's staff. From these
discussions, I have gleaned that the
Jewish community stands against
divestment because it divides the
Jewish community at Stanford.
This article concerns neither di
vestment nor the Israel/Palestine
conflict. Instead, I hope to share my
feelings of progressive alienation
from Stanford's Jewish community
alienation that has occurred
largely because of the ways we
avoid talking about issues like di
vestment.
I spent six weeks at the end of
high school living with family in
Jerusalem, traveling in both Israel
and the West Bank while listening
to as many opinions on the conflict
as possible. I quickly became dis
gusted by the naivete of the educa
tion I had received about Israel to
that point in my life. Though disap
pointed with my past, I was excited
by my future at Stanford: a future
filled with opportunities to interact
with the Israel/Palestine conflict in
Stanford's more diverse and (ex
pectedly) well-informed intellectual
environment.
At my first activities fair, I ea
gerly signed up for both the Stan
ford Israel Alliance and Students
for Palestinian Equal Rights, com
munities that I assumed could, and
necessarily should, cooperate. Dur
ing my sophomore year, I began
regularly attending SPER meet
ings while also meeting just as fre
quently with Hillel's Israel chair.

Later that year marked the mo
ment I began to feel alienated from
Stanford's Jewish community. At a
dialogue event, I was particularly
ready to discuss divestment, given
the campaign's pertinence on our
campus at the time. When the mod
erator raised the issue, however,
numerous members of the discus
sion got up and left; one student
even muttered something about a
"cue to leave."
If a fear of division in our Jewish
community precludes discussion of
divestment, from whence does my
own alienation from the community,
rooted in the fact that we refuse to
talk about divestment, originate?
I do not wish to assert that di
vestment is not a polarizing issue
nor that we should not care about
the unity of our Jewish community.
We need to acknowledge, though,
that this "unity" we are trying to
preserve by silencing topics like di
vestment is already, in my case, an
illusion. In this context, I pose the
question: is preserving the notion of
"unity" within our community real
ly more important than discussing
how our campus can tangibly im
pact political realities in the Middle
East?
I will raise the same question
posed in a 2010 article by City Uni
versity of New York Associate Pro
fessor Peter Beinart. Beinart pres
ents a group of Israeli students who
protest the eviction of a Palestinian
family and asks, "What if American
Jewish organizations brought these
young people to speak at Hillel?
What if this was the face of Zionism
shown to America's Jewish young?"
Beinart supposes "an uncomfort
able Zionism, a Zionism angry at
what Israel risks becoming, and in
love with what it still could be."
I hope that severing ties with
Stanford's Jewish community is not
the only means to rid my embar
rassment of, and discomfort with,
its refusal to discuss what is, quite
undeniably, a human rights abomi
nation. If we as a community choose
to ignore my argument entirely and
continue to silence certain discus
sions, I urge us to find other medi
ums through which to talk con
structively about Israel and Pales
tine.
