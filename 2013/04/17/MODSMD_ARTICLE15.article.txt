# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## The 						Mice in My Head 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
When I think of the different
tasks my brain carries out
each day, I think of little
mice running around inside there to
get everything done as quickly as
possible. Key word: running. They
run all day without pause, with dis
tracted focus and shortness of
breath. They stumble; they careen
into corners; they fall flat on their
faces. They are impatient and rude.
They snap at the mice in other peo
ples' brains. They are quick to
judge and in too big a rush to em
pathize or understand. And for all
their hurry, they are still inefficient.
Maybe mice aren't your thing
pick whatever metaphor you like.
My point is that rushing slows me
down. Yet I can't resist the tempta
tion to go faster, faster, faster.
Everywhere I turn there is a sign
post shouting "Hurry up!" "Multi
task!" "Get ahead!" The climate at
Stanford positively reinforces impa
tience by promising rewards to
those who follow the signposts. And
while the signposts seem like they
should direct you straight to the
Gumdrop Mountains, you inevitably
end up mired in the Molasses
Swamp (Candyland, anyone?). Turn
around, reset and roll the dice
again. This time more slowly.
A psychology-major friend of
mine explained to me how when you
rush, the little mice running franti
cally around your brain stimulate
your body to run at a higher rev.
You trick your body into thinking it
needs to move faster than it actual

ly does in a vicious positive-feed
back loop. The result? When you
make it to class on time, you end up
a whole lot more exhausted than
getting to class on time warrants.
This is bad news.
Even when I do slow down, the
mice in my brain keep running.
They preemptively rush. They
make superfluous to-do lists. They
schedule out the rest of the day with
time blocked out for showering, eat
ing, exercising, breathing. They run
around to fit everything into a man
ic schedule so that even just sitting
on my butt thinking about what I
have to do next, I exhaust myself.
The irony is that by trying to sched
ule each minute to be the most effi
cient machine I can be, I cripple
myself with exhaustion and turn in
efficient. I end up distracted in class
or asleep halfway through my read
ing. Sound familiar?
Unfortunately, most schedules
here require that students rush to
fit all activities into a day and still
get a decent amount of sleep at
night. I wish I could tell you to stop
rushing entirely, but that would be
unrealistic. The only advice I can of
fer regards the signposts. Rush as
much as you like on your own terms
but let the signposts go. Give your
self the space to ignore the pressure
to hurry up, multitask and get
ahead. When you have some free
time, give yourself the gift of spac
ing out, or taking a yoga class, or
calling your sister. Let your mice
hunker down in a hammock, and

don't allow yourself an ounce of
guilt for putting on hold the
thoughts about the next hour or this
summer or next year. You might
find your focus refreshed. You
might even be able to make it
through your reading afterward.
