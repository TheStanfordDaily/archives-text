## Baseball crushes Pacific behind Blandino, heart of order 
### â€“ Sam Fisher 
Stanford (20-11, 7-5 Pac-12) remembered
how close it came to falling at Pacific (9-22,2-7
Big West) last year, barely sneaking by in ex
tra innings. The Cardinal made sure to put the
game away early, riding a strong stalling
pitching performance from freshman Bobby
Zarubin and five runs in the first three innings
to put the game out of reach en route to a 9-2
victory.
Zarubin, who has struggled with command
over his past few appearances, bounced back
against the Tigers. The freshman earned the
victory with a three-hit, two-walk perform
ance in five innings of one-run ball before giv
ing way to senior relief pitcher Dean McAr

die. McArdle and fellow senior relief pitcher
Garrett Hughes combined to allow only one
run in for four innings to close out the game.
Stanford got all nine of its RBI from its
four-through-eight hitters. Junior first base
man Brian Ragira got it started with a two
run blast in the top of the first inning, and
Stanford never gave back the lead.
Sophomore third baseman Alex Blandino
provided the dagger with a three-run home
run in the top of the eighth inning to put
Stanford ahead 9-1.
It gets tougher for Stanford on Friday, as
the Cardinal welcomes defending NCAA
champion Arizona to the Farm for a three
game Pac-12 series. First pitch is scheduled
for 7 p.m.
