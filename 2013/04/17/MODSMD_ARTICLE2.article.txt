## Departments look to boost accessibility Undergrads, faculty prioritize openness and student outreach 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a recent Yale University study suggest
ing that students in smaller majors are happier
than their counterparts in larger programs due to
greater access to and familiarity with faculty,
Stanford's professors and department chairs have
emphasized their own efforts to avoid such a di
vide.
According to Robert Simoni, chair of the biolo
gy department, any such issue may be of students'
own making, through a failure to take advantage
of opportunities to establish relationships with
otherwise accessible faculty.
"It's not very hard for professors to be acces
sible [in large majors]... They each have multiple
office hours," he said. "[However] few students
take advantage of [professors' office hours], which
can be disheartening."
William Abrams, professor of human biology,
framed his department's approach as a more
proactive one, citing efforts to actively reach out
to students.
"[Human biology] is a large major but we're
very well organized," Abrams said. "We have a lot
of programs to make faculty accessible... and the
faculty want to be accessible. We look for ways to
make ourselves available to students."
Alex Mullin 'l5, a human biology major, em
phasized the benefits of that approach.
