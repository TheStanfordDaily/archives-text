## Departments look to boost accessibility Undergrads, faculty prioritize openness and student outreach 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a recent Yale University study suggest
ing that students in smaller majors are happier
than their counterparts in larger programs due to
greater access to and familiarity with faculty,
Stanford's professors and department chairs have
emphasized their own efforts to avoid such a di
vide.
According to Robert Simoni, chair of the biolo
gy department, any such issue may be of students'
own making, through a failure to take advantage
of opportunities to establish relationships with
otherwise accessible faculty.
"It's not very hard for professors to be acces
sible [in large majors]... They each have multiple
office hours," he said. "[However] few students
take advantage of [professors' office hours], which
can be disheartening."
William Abrams, professor of human biology,
framed his department's approach as a more
proactive one, citing efforts to actively reach out
to students.
"[Human biology] is a large major but we're
very well organized," Abrams said. "We have a lot
of programs to make faculty accessible... and the
faculty want to be accessible. We look for ways to
make ourselves available to students."
Alex Mullin 'l5, a human biology major, em
phasized the benefits of that approach.
"The professors are will
ing to get to know the stu
dents and all have office
hours," she said. "Even the
professors who are just guest
lecturing seem interested in
students asking questions
and coming to office hours."
Mullin also cited the value
of student advisors in making
a larger major more open
and manageable.
"Having student advisors
helps," she said. "They make
it really easy to get more in
formation about our work or
the department."
Schuyler Smith 'l5, a
computer science major, ac
knowledged both the benefits
and disadvantages of study
ing in a larger department.
"In a smaller department,
it would be easier to get to
know other students because
you would get to see them in
other classes, and I guess
that's a good thing," he said.
"But I think part of the rea
son the CS program is so

large is because the profes
sors are so fantastic, so stu
dents want to take the class
es. I certainly wouldn't trade
that for a smaller student
body."
Bruce Owen Ph.D. '7O, di
rector of the public policy pro
gram, said that his depart
ment a notably small major
is able to reach out to its
students unusually well.
"The students who come
and hang around the offices
or show up for various
events, we get to know very
well," he said. "You get to
know everyone by name
pretty well."
Owen said that the faculty
and staff in his department
are surprised when they re
ceive an application to gradu
ate from a student they didn't
know.
"They knew they were a
major, but we didn't know
who they were," he said.
"Other than that, it's a fairly
close-knit group."
Abrams emphasized the
human biology program's
constant efforts to improve
as allowing continued acces
sibility.
"[Human biology] is

known for being accessible,
and students have told me
they appreciate that," he said.
"We work hard as a faculty,
spending a lot of time with
colleagues talking about our
students, how we can be more
available or better at meeting
the needs of students."
Owen, however, singled
out the public policy pro
gram's small size as a source
of student satisfaction.
"We just finished our
five-year review process and
students were very posi
tive," he said. "The average
responder said they value
the small size of the program
and hope that it doesn't get
any bigger. They really like
getting to know the faculty
and staff and other stu
dents."
Reflecting on his own ex
periences, Smith credited
professors themselves
rather than departmental size
or programming—as foster
ing student satisfaction.
"They seem genuinely in
terested in helping me
learn," he said.
