## Winners use algorithm in finance game 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The top three competitors in this year's Stan
ford Women in Business (SWIB) Fantasy Stock
Exchange (FSE) used a trading algorithm for the
first time in the competition's history, allowing
them to make thousands of trades and achieve dai
ly rates of return above 20 percent.
The algorithm, which was created by Andrew
Han 'l6, Jessica Xu 'l6 and Miraj Rahematpura
'l6 during spring break, was applied towards the
end of the 10-week competition. Han, Xu and Ra
hematpura were propelled to the top of the leader
board, displacing competitors who had been in the
lead for weeks.
Each of the 135 competitors was initially given
$1,000,000 to make virtual trades. Han placed first
with total returns of $509,750.42, winning a $3OO
prize from SWIB. Rahematpura came in second
and won a $2OO prize for his returns of $421,925.43,
and Xu placed third with $397,832.56 in total re
turns, winning $lOO. The fourth place competitor,
Lucas Thompson 'l6, had total returns of
$240,398.16.
According to Han, the algorithm is pro
grammed to purchase high volumes of cheap and
volatile stocks, such as Zynga and Groupon, wait
for small gains in the price and sell the stocks to
profit off these price increases.
"We found stocks that were really volatile so
they were constantly changing, and since the com
puter could constantly update it while we couldn't
ourselves, that's why our
stocks went up a lot more
than if we did it by hand," Xu
explained.
Han, Xu and Rahematpu
ra each played a different role
in the algorithm's develop
ment, with Xu researching
stocks, Han writing code and
Rahematpura doing the
mathematical calculations.
While the three used similar
algorithms, they invested in
different stocks and made dif
ferent numbers of trades.
"The algorithm would look
at stock prices, and if certain
conditions held, it would buy.
If certain conditions held, it
would sell," Han said. "It was
sort of a learning experience
for us, too. [Xu] selected a
couple of stocks and we would
each choose different ones
that would interface with
whatever combination of al
gorithms that we had set."

Though Han said that he
would understand if other
competitors were "a little
miffed" by the use of the algo
rithm, Thompson, who had
been in the lead for four
weeks before the last week of
the game, thought the algo
rithm was fair.
"I think if you can come up
with a trading algorithm that
works that well, that's awe
some," Thompson said.
"Clearly it worked extremely
well. If you are willing to put
that amount of effort into it to
come up with something like
that, I have no problem with
that."
Sohaib Shaikh 'l6, who
came in sixth in the competi
tion, said that creating algo
rithms is "really what a lot of
the stock market has become
nowadays."
"It is honestly about who
can develop the fastest algo
rithm," he said. "In the game,
sure, I think it's a completely
reasonable thing for people to
use [algorithms]. It is an op
portunity for them to test
these algorithms."

According to Paige Gonye
'l4, director of FSE, the use
of a trading algorithm in the
FSE is "unprecedented." Af
ter speaking with Han, Xu
and Rahematpura to ensure
that they had each con
tributed to the algorithm,
Gonye determined that the
use of the algorithm, though
unconventional, was fair.
"We were definitely sur
prised, but true to Stanford
fashion there is always a new
approach that students are
willing to experiment with,"
Gonye said. "Because they
were able to prove that they
each contributed something
to the project and they each
have said exactly what they
contributed, they are enti
tled to the prizes."
While Gonye said that
Han, Xu and Rahematpura
earned their prizes, she not
ed that SWIB will likely re
structure the game in future
years, either limiting the
number of trades or creating
two games one where the
use of algorithms is encour
aged and one where a long

term strategy is emphasized.
"The game has continued
to change and evolve over the
years, but this is going to
probably be a larger change
than we would have made,"
Gonye said. "We are trying to
teach students who aren't as
sophisticated necessarily, and
we want to make the game
fair."
Han said that he would
participate in the game next
year if SWIB decides to offer
a second game that encour
ages the use of algorithms.
However, he said that that he
would be wary of using trad
ing algorithms again in the
normal competition.
"It's kind of like a weapons
of mass destruction kind of
thing, one or two weeks of
running the program and
there's no point in even trying
anymore," Han said. "To pre
serve [SWIB's] purpose,
which is to teach people the
basics of investing, I wouldn't
join it."

years, but this is going to
probably be a larger change
than we would have made,"
Gonye said. "We are trying to
teach students who aren't as

we want to make the game
fair."
Han said that he would
participate in the game next
year if SWIB decides to offer
a second game that encour
ages the use of algorithms.
However, he said that that he
would be wary of using trad

normal competition.
"It's kind of like a weapons
of mass destruction kind of
thing, one or two weeks of
running the program and
there's no point in even trying

basics of investing, I wouldn't
join it."

The top three competitors in this year's Stan
ford Women in Business (SWIB) Fantasy Stock
Exchange (FSE) used a trading algorithm for the
first time in the competition's history, allowing
them to make thousands of trades and achieve dai
ly rates of return above 20 percent.
The algorithm, which was created by Andrew
Han 'l6, Jessica Xu 'l6 and Miraj Rahematpura
'l6 during spring break, was applied towards the
end of the 10-week competition. Han, Xu and Ra
hematpura were propelled to the top of the leader
board, displacing competitors who had been in the
lead for weeks.
Each of the 135 competitors was initially given
$1,000,000 to make virtual trades. Han placed first
with total returns of $509,750.42, winning a $3OO
prize from SWIB. Rahematpura came in second
and won a $2OO prize for his returns of $421,925.43,
and Xu placed third with $397,832.56 in total re
turns, winning $lOO. The fourth place competitor,
Lucas Thompson 'l6, had total returns of
$240,398.16.
According to Han, the algorithm is pro
grammed to purchase high volumes of cheap and
volatile stocks, such as Zynga and Groupon, wait
for small gains in the price and sell the stocks to
profit off these price increases.
"We found stocks that were really volatile so
they were constantly changing, and since the com
puter could constantly update it while we couldn't
ourselves, that's why our
stocks went up a lot more
than if we did it by hand," Xu
explained.
Han, Xu and Rahematpu
ra each played a different role
in the algorithm's develop
ment, with Xu researching
stocks, Han writing code and
Rahematpura doing the
mathematical calculations.
While the three used similar
algorithms, they invested in
different stocks and made dif
ferent numbers of trades.
"The algorithm would look
at stock prices, and if certain
conditions held, it would buy.
If certain conditions held, it
would sell," Han said. "It was
sort of a learning experience
for us, too. [Xu] selected a
couple of stocks and we would
each choose different ones
that would interface with
whatever combination of al
gorithms that we had set."

Though Han said that he
would understand if other
competitors were "a little
miffed" by the use of the algo
rithm, Thompson, who had
been in the lead for four
weeks before the last week of
the game, thought the algo
rithm was fair.
"I think if you can come up
with a trading algorithm that
works that well, that's awe
some," Thompson said.
"Clearly it worked extremely
well. If you are willing to put
that amount of effort into it to
come up with something like
that, I have no problem with
that."
Sohaib Shaikh 'l6, who
came in sixth in the competi
tion, said that creating algo
rithms is "really what a lot of
the stock market has become
nowadays."
"It is honestly about who
can develop the fastest algo
rithm," he said. "In the game,
sure, I think it's a completely
reasonable thing for people to
use [algorithms]. It is an op
portunity for them to test
these algorithms."

According to Paige Gonye
'l4, director of FSE, the use
of a trading algorithm in the
FSE is "unprecedented." Af
ter speaking with Han, Xu
and Rahematpura to ensure
that they had each con
tributed to the algorithm,
Gonye determined that the
use of the algorithm, though
unconventional, was fair.
"We were definitely sur
prised, but true to Stanford
fashion there is always a new
approach that students are
willing to experiment with,"
Gonye said. "Because they
were able to prove that they
each contributed something
to the project and they each
have said exactly what they
contributed, they are enti
tled to the prizes."
While Gonye said that
Han, Xu and Rahematpura
earned their prizes, she not
ed that SWIB will likely re
structure the game in future
years, either limiting the
number of trades or creating
two games one where the
use of algorithms is encour
aged and one where a long

term strategy is emphasized.
"The game has continued
to change and evolve over the
years, but this is going to
probably be a larger change
than we would have made,"
Gonye said. "We are trying to
teach students who aren't as
sophisticated necessarily, and
we want to make the game
fair."
Han said that he would
participate in the game next
year if SWIB decides to offer
a second game that encour
ages the use of algorithms.
However, he said that that he
would be wary of using trad
ing algorithms again in the
normal competition.
"It's kind of like a weapons
of mass destruction kind of
thing, one or two weeks of
running the program and
there's no point in even trying
anymore," Han said. "To pre
serve [SWIB's] purpose,
which is to teach people the
basics of investing, I wouldn't
join it."
