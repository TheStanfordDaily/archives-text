# Cantor collaborates with Google
## More than 100 works made available for online viewing and discussion 
### CLARISSE PERALTA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 100 works of art from the Can
tor Arts Center have been made available on
line for in-depth public viewing through a new
partnership between the Center and the
Google Art Project.
The Google Art Project offers high-resolu
tion images of more than 40,000 works of ait
from 200 institutions across the globe, includ
ing the Metropolitan Museum of Ait, the
Musee d'Orsay and the Tate Modern.
The project allows online visitors to zoom
in and explore the art, save a work of art in
their personal "gallery," share it with friends
or start a Google hangout to discuss a partic
ular piece with others.
Each piece of artwork comes accompanied
by a description of the artist, the medium and
information about the work's creation. For
some works, viewers can watch videos or lis
ten to audio files, or trace where the artist was
born and died on a map.
"[The Google Art Project] uses a combina
tion of various Google technologies and infrna
tion provided by our museum partners to re

ally create a unique online experience, so peo
ple can explore a wide range of artwork at
brushstroke-level detail," Google spokesper
son Rebecca Ginsberg said.
Connie Wolf 'Bl, director of the Cantor
Arts Center, said that Google contacted Can
tor about a possible partnership in the fall,
with the works uploaded on April 3. Wolf said
she was "really excited" about the opportuni
ty to add some of Cantor's works to the proj
ect.
"We [are becoming] part of the dialogue
about art around the world that's accessible,"
Wolf said. "We're just so happy to be part of
that and to make sure that the work in our col
lection is accessible to people all over the
world."
According to Wolf, the 105 works that were
chosen for the Google Ait Project
are representative of the museum's 36,000-
item collection. Selected works range from
"Brothel Scene (Dans le Salon d'une Maison
Close)," a monotype by Edgar Degas, to
"Georgia Granite Circle," a marble sculpture
created by Richard Long.
"The Cantor is such an encyclopedic mu
seum— it covers so many continents, so

many thousands of years, so many kinds of
styles," Wolf said. "We decided that we were
looking at each department of the museum,
having 10 objects in it to give a flavor of what
we do, so people could learn a little bit about
the museum."
Wolf referenced The Last Spike, a golden
ceremonial spike that was forged in San Fran
cisco and connected the Central Pacific and
Union Pacific railroads, as one of the collec
tion's more famous pieces that is now avail
able online.
"Having the gold spike there really speaks
about the history of the museum, the history
of the campus and of America, so it's very ex
citing to have that," Wolf said.
While Wolf expressed enthusiasm about
sharing some of Cantor's artwork with view
ers around the world, Nancy Troy, chair of
the Department of Art and Art History, em
phasized various differences between view
ing a piece of art online and in person, includ
ing the scale of the work, the accuracy of the
colors and the relationship of the individual
object to the works around it.
"Many of these features of your visit to a
museum signify that the work you're seeing
is special, that they are valuable and that
these objects have a cultural value," Troy
said.
Troy claimed that as more art becomes
widely available for online viewing, museums
will have to convince visitors of the merits of
seeing art in person and may struggle to "re
tain the freshness" of works that can be
viewed online in high-definition.
"I think it is up to museums to help poten
tial visitors understand the difference in ex
perience and kind of mediate the widespread
availability and reproducibility of the ob
jects," Troy said.
While Troy acknowledged uncertainty
over whether or not art students will take ad
vantage of Cantor's online offerings, Ginsberg
said that Google was optimistic about the col
laboration.
"We were thrilled to partner with Stanford
on this. The collection is obviously amazing,"
Ginsberg said. "We have a long history with
Stanford. It's our neighbor out there and so
we're glad that they were interested in joining
the project."
