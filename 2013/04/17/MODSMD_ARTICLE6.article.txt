## Senate discusses committees, study abroad policy 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At its April 16 meeting, the AS
SU Undergraduate Senate debat
ed issues surrounding the policies
and structure of the Senate, in
cluding the organization of com
mittees, whether senators should
be allowed to study abroad and
how many Senate seats should be
reserved for upperclassmen.
Before a lengthy discussion of
concerns regarding the transition

to next year's Senate, senators
heard updates from ASSU Assis
tant Financial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 and Elec
tions Commissioner Brianna Pang
'l3.
Pang asked the Senate to con
sider allocating funds to the Legal
Counseling Office (LCO), the only
special fees group that did not re
ceive funding from the student
body. According to Pang, the
LCO's request for approximately
$130,000 in special fees failed to

pass by a margin of just 17 votes.
Incoming ASSU Executives
Dan Ashton 'l4 and Billy Gal
lagher 'l4 said that they hope to
work with the Senate to ensure
that the LCO receives the neces
sary funding to operate next year,
with Ashton calling the LCO "the
most important of all the groups"
and serving "an incredibly impor
tant mission."
Senators agreed to continue
the discussion about funding the
LCO at future meetings.

Several newly-elected senators
present at the meeting were asked
to provide input on issues that
have been debated in the Senate's
transition sub-committee, includ
ing the Senate's study abroad pol
icy. The Senate's Bylaws currently
state that senators who study
abroad during their term will be
expelled from the Senate.
In a straw poll conducted by
Senator Viraj Bindra '15,10 sena
tors recommended making no
change to the Bylaws, and two vot-

Ed to consider allowing senators to
study abroad in spring quarter,
provided they had a "compelling
reason" and declared their intent
to study abroad during their cam
paign.
"I think it is really necessary to
have hopefully all 15 people here
all three quarters," said Senator
Shahab Fadavi 'l5, who supported
leaving the Bylaws un
changed. "Looking back in retro-
spect this year, there was
some difficulty in us trying
to pass votes."
The Senate also ad
dressed potentially restruc
turing the current commit
tee system. Senator Kimber
ly Bacon 'l5 said that the
two committees most in
need of "revamping" were
Student Life and Academic
Affairs.
Deputy Chair Garima
Sharma 'l5 said that the
transition sub-committee
had discussed either merg
ing the Student Life and Ac
ademic Affairs committees
or alternately disbanding
them and appointing point
people to lead specific proj
ect teams.
Fadavi, current chair of
the Academic Affairs com
mittee, argued against dis
banding the committees.
"Those are two big com
mittees that handle big, big
issues," Fadavi said. "Espe
cially with Academic Affairs,
I do recommend that there
be a chair of the committee
and a deputy chair because
when you are dealing with
administrators, they often
want to talk with someone
they see as a representative
of that group."
In a straw poll, seven
senators recommended dis
banding the committees, and
four voted to make no
changes to the current sys
tem.
Senators also discussed
reforming the Appropria
tions Committee. Bindra
presented two alternatives
to the current committee
structure either requir
ing every senator to rotate
through the Appropriations
Committee or asking all sen
ators to be knowledgeable
about appropriations and
help the committee when
necessary.
All 11 senators present
voted in favor of the second
option in another straw poll
conducted by Bindra.
The Senate also debated
whether or not to take action
on an amendment passed
during the spring election,
which would allow the Sen
ate to reserve seats for up

perclassmen in their Bylaws.
Senators considered sug
gesting a specific number of
seats for the new Senate to
add to the Bylaws or decid
ing on the number them
selves.
"If these guys are going
to come in and define [the
number of reserved seats],
they are going to do it early
on in their term," Fadavi
said. "Given that we have a
year of experience, it would
be better for us to define
[the number]."

In a straw poll, six sena
tors voted to refrain from
changing the Bylaws but
give recommendations to the
new Senate, three senators
voted to add the amendment
text to the Bylaws but set
the reserved number of
seats to zero, and two voted
to establish a specific num
ber of reserved seats in the
Bylaws.
At the end of the meet
ing, a bill was put on previ
ous notice to approve the
2013-2014 ASSU Operating
Budget. Bindra and Senate
Chair Branden Crouch 'l4
presented the budget, not
ing that there were few
changes other than adding
additional money to the dis
cretionary fund due to an in
crease in the endowment.
At next week's meeting,
Crouch is expected to make
an announcement about Ap
propriations Committee
Chair Nancy Pham 'l4, who
has been absent for the first
three weeks of the quarter.
According to the Bylaws, a
bill for Pham's expulsion
should be presented at the
Senate meeting next week.
Crouch did not comment
on whether Pham would re
turn to the Senate and said
that the issue would be re
solved by the next meeting.

Sharma 'l5 said that the
transition sub-committee
had discussed either merg
ing the Student Life and Ac
ademic Affairs committees
or alternately disbanding
them and appointing point
people to lead specific proj
ect teams.
Fadavi, current chair of
the Academic Affairs com
mittee, argued against dis
banding the committees.
"Those are two big com
mittees that handle big, big
issues," Fadavi said. "Espe
cially with Academic Affairs,
I do recommend that there
be a chair of the committee
and a deputy chair because
when you are dealing with
administrators, they often
want to talk with someone
they see as a representative
of that group."
In a straw poll, seven
senators recommended dis
banding the committees, and
four voted to make no
changes to the current sys
tem.
Senators also discussed
reforming the Appropria
tions Committee. Bindra
presented two alternatives
to the current committee
structure either requir
ing every senator to rotate
through the Appropriations
Committee or asking all sen
ators to be knowledgeable
about appropriations and
help the committee when
necessary.
All 11 senators present
voted in favor of the second
option in another straw poll
conducted by Bindra.
The Senate also debated
whether or not to take action
on an amendment passed
during the spring election,
which would allow the Sen
ate to reserve seats for up

perclassmen in their Bylaws.
Senators considered sug
gesting a specific number of
seats for the new Senate to
add to the Bylaws or decid
ing on the number them
selves.
"If these guys are going
to come in and define [the
number of reserved seats],
they are going to do it early
on in their term," Fadavi
said. "Given that we have a
year of experience, it would
be better for us to define
[the number]."

In a straw poll, six sena
tors voted to refrain from
changing the Bylaws but
give recommendations to the
new Senate, three senators
voted to add the amendment
text to the Bylaws but set
the reserved number of
seats to zero, and two voted
to establish a specific num
ber of reserved seats in the
Bylaws.
At the end of the meet
ing, a bill was put on previ
ous notice to approve the
2013-2014 ASSU Operating
Budget. Bindra and Senate
Chair Branden Crouch 'l4
presented the budget, not
ing that there were few
changes other than adding
additional money to the dis
cretionary fund due to an in
crease in the endowment.
At next week's meeting,
Crouch is expected to make
an announcement about Ap
propriations Committee
Chair Nancy Pham 'l4, who
has been absent for the first
three weeks of the quarter.
According to the Bylaws, a
bill for Pham's expulsion
should be presented at the
Senate meeting next week.
Crouch did not comment
on whether Pham would re
turn to the Senate and said
that the issue would be re
solved by the next meeting.

At its April 16 meeting, the AS
SU Undergraduate Senate debat
ed issues surrounding the policies
and structure of the Senate, in
cluding the organization of com
mittees, whether senators should
be allowed to study abroad and
how many Senate seats should be
reserved for upperclassmen.
Before a lengthy discussion of
concerns regarding the transition

to next year's Senate, senators
heard updates from ASSU Assis
tant Financial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 and Elec
tions Commissioner Brianna Pang
'l3.
Pang asked the Senate to con
sider allocating funds to the Legal
Counseling Office (LCO), the only
special fees group that did not re
ceive funding from the student
body. According to Pang, the
LCO's request for approximately
$130,000 in special fees failed to

pass by a margin of just 17 votes.
Incoming ASSU Executives
Dan Ashton 'l4 and Billy Gal
lagher 'l4 said that they hope to
work with the Senate to ensure
that the LCO receives the neces
sary funding to operate next year,
with Ashton calling the LCO "the
most important of all the groups"
and serving "an incredibly impor
tant mission."
Senators agreed to continue
the discussion about funding the
LCO at future meetings.

Several newly-elected senators
present at the meeting were asked
to provide input on issues that
have been debated in the Senate's
transition sub-committee, includ
ing the Senate's study abroad pol
icy. The Senate's Bylaws currently
state that senators who study
abroad during their term will be
expelled from the Senate.
In a straw poll conducted by
Senator Viraj Bindra '15,10 sena
tors recommended making no
change to the Bylaws, and two vot-

Ed to consider allowing senators to
study abroad in spring quarter,
provided they had a "compelling
reason" and declared their intent
to study abroad during their cam
paign.
"I think it is really necessary to
have hopefully all 15 people here
all three quarters," said Senator
Shahab Fadavi 'l5, who supported
leaving the Bylaws un
changed. "Looking back in retro-
spect this year, there was
some difficulty in us trying
to pass votes."
The Senate also ad
dressed potentially restruc
turing the current commit
tee system. Senator Kimber
ly Bacon 'l5 said that the
two committees most in
need of "revamping" were
Student Life and Academic
Affairs.
Deputy Chair Garima
Sharma 'l5 said that the
transition sub-committee
had discussed either merg
ing the Student Life and Ac
ademic Affairs committees
or alternately disbanding
them and appointing point
people to lead specific proj
ect teams.
