### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At its April 16 meeting, the AS
SU Undergraduate Senate debat
ed issues surrounding the policies
and structure of the Senate, in
cluding the organization of com
mittees, whether senators should
be allowed to study abroad and
how many Senate seats should be
reserved for upperclassmen.

concerns regarding the transition

to next year's Senate, senators

Pang asked the Senate to con

present at the meeting were asked
to provide input on issues that
have been debated in the Senate's
transition sub-committee, includ

expelled from the Senate.

Senator Viraj Bindra '15,10 sena

Ed to consider allowing senators to
study abroad in spring quarter,
provided they had a "compelling
reason" and declared their intent
to study abroad during their cam
paign.
"I think it is really necessary to
have hopefully all 15 people here
all three quarters," said Senator
Shahab Fadavi 'l5, who supported
leaving the Bylaws un
changed. "Looking back in retro-
