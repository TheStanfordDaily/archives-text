## Lakers missing Black Mamba magic 
### Winston Shi 
For the past six months, the
sacrificial lambs have been
slaughtering the butcher. I
apologize that I just recycled
an old gem from Sports Il
lustrated, but the sentence seems
more than appropriate right now.
The Miami Heat's epic winning
streak will most likely be what peo
ple remember from this NBA season
fifty years later, but the most sur
prising event of the season is the
crashing and burning of the 2012-13
Los Angeles Lakers, fresh off the ac
quisitions of superstars Dwight
Howard and Steve Nash. I don't
want to go into the gory details, but
before the season, many people (not
me) were talking about breaking the
'96 Bulls' record of 72 wins and suf
fice to say that the Los Angeles Lak
ers have had them eating crow for
the past six months.
In fact, the Lakers are in danger
of missing the playoffs for only the
sixth time in their 65 years of exis
tence, and, as it stands, need to win
their final game of the season just to
sneak into the playoffs as the No. 8
seed, where they would await some
thing resembling a Quentin Taranti
no blood fantasy at the hands of the
Thunder.
I'm actually writing this before
the season finale against Houston;
there's no need to spoil the story
they'll play today at 7:30 p.m., if
you're interested. Either way, the
song remains mostly the same. The
Lakers have almost no hope of play
off victory, but they are fighting nev
ertheless because of their admirable
pride and because the terms of the
Steve Nash trade mean that if the
Lakers miss the playoffs altogether,
their first-round draft pick goes to
Phoenix.
To better illustrate the point, the
Lakers were swept by the Clippers,
a basketball "franchise" [sic] with no
history, no money and almost no ap
preciable fan base until last year.
(And one that would still be fairly
mediocre if the NBA had not previ
ously blocked the Chris Paul trade to
the Lakers.)
In fact, the last on-paper super
team to disappoint this badly was
the 2003-04 Lakers, and they
m.ade the NBA Finals. I suppose
that that only goes to show how
spoiled Lakers fans are, but to tell
the truth, when you have as many in
stitutional advantages as the Lakers
do, anything short of a championship
every year is a bit disappointing.
Of course, crashing and burning
always has a reason, and the Lakers'
primary boogeyman has been in
juries. The team have played ap
proximately five games at full
strength, and to add insult to injury,
Kobe Bryant just ripped his Achilles
tendon and will be lucky to be able to
play at the start of next season if
he ever makes back.
For Kobe, the only constant
throughout my lifetime as a sports
fan, this season absolutely should
not have ended this way. This was
meant to be his coronation; it ended
up with him mirroring his years in
the wilderness, when he dragged a
barren Lakers squad to the playoffs
two years out of three.
Playing with a brutal workload
45 minutes a game by the end of
the season Kobe wore down, re
minding us all that he is not the play
er he used to be. This last epiphany
was something we all ought to have
known and indeed somewhere
along the road of my fandom I ac
knowledged that Leßron James is
the superior player but Friday
night was the first time I ever really
had to come to terms with it.
Kobe Bryant may never play
again; more shockingly, he is getting
old. (Old for a basketball player, that
is another way in which sports
can be disorienting.)
I have probably spent more time
shouting at Kobe on the TV than I
have cheering for him. There are a
number of things I intensely dislike
about Kobe's game constantly
calling isolation plays for himself, his
general disinterest in playing de
fense (and how he was picked year
after year for the All-Defense team,
I'll never know), his lack of passing
and his willingness to take the sort of
shots that my coach benched me for
in high school.
Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals
was the perfect Kobe Bryant game
6-for-24 from the field, countless
bad decisions, countless moments of
unthinkable brilliance and eventual
ly the victory.
However, this last season was
bizarre; Kobe was constantly adjust
ing his style to the Lakers' personnel
and even averaged ten assists a
game for a good stretch of the sea-
son. As star after star went
down, he remained the sole
constant through the entire
year. Without Kobe Bryant,
the Lakers would be a 35-win
team.
But now he is gone at
least for the time being
the Lakers are on the verge
of missing out on the playoffs
for the first time since 2005.
For a fan who's as accus
tomed to success as I am, the
world now looks completely
different.

Winston Shi is still exasper
ated that his high school
coach never recognized his
inner Kobe. Applaud his lack
of passing or defense and en
courage him to throw his
name, into the NBA Draft at

For the past six months, the
sacrificial lambs have been
slaughtering the butcher. I
apologize that I just recycled
an old gem from Sports Il
lustrated, but the sentence seems
more than appropriate right now.
The Miami Heat's epic winning
streak will most likely be what peo
ple remember from this NBA season
fifty years later, but the most sur
prising event of the season is the
crashing and burning of the 2012-13
Los Angeles Lakers, fresh off the ac
quisitions of superstars Dwight
Howard and Steve Nash. I don't
want to go into the gory details, but
before the season, many people (not
me) were talking about breaking the
'96 Bulls' record of 72 wins and suf
fice to say that the Los Angeles Lak
ers have had them eating crow for
the past six months.
In fact, the Lakers are in danger
of missing the playoffs for only the
sixth time in their 65 years of exis
tence, and, as it stands, need to win
their final game of the season just to
sneak into the playoffs as the No. 8
seed, where they would await some
thing resembling a Quentin Taranti
no blood fantasy at the hands of the
Thunder.
I'm actually writing this before
the season finale against Houston;
there's no need to spoil the story
they'll play today at 7:30 p.m., if
you're interested. Either way, the
song remains mostly the same. The
Lakers have almost no hope of play
off victory, but they are fighting nev
ertheless because of their admirable
pride and because the terms of the
Steve Nash trade mean that if the
Lakers miss the playoffs altogether,
their first-round draft pick goes to
Phoenix.
To better illustrate the point, the
Lakers were swept by the Clippers,
a basketball "franchise" [sic] with no
history, no money and almost no ap
preciable fan base until last year.
(And one that would still be fairly
mediocre if the NBA had not previ
ously blocked the Chris Paul trade to
the Lakers.)
In fact, the last on-paper super
team to disappoint this badly was
the 2003-04 Lakers, and they
m.ade the NBA Finals. I suppose
that that only goes to show how
spoiled Lakers fans are, but to tell
the truth, when you have as many in
stitutional advantages as the Lakers
do, anything short of a championship
every year is a bit disappointing.
Of course, crashing and burning
always has a reason, and the Lakers'
primary boogeyman has been in
juries. The team have played ap
proximately five games at full
strength, and to add insult to injury,
Kobe Bryant just ripped his Achilles
tendon and will be lucky to be able to
play at the start of next season if
he ever makes back.
For Kobe, the only constant
throughout my lifetime as a sports
fan, this season absolutely should
not have ended this way. This was
meant to be his coronation; it ended
up with him mirroring his years in
the wilderness, when he dragged a
barren Lakers squad to the playoffs
two years out of three.
Playing with a brutal workload
45 minutes a game by the end of
the season Kobe wore down, re
minding us all that he is not the play
er he used to be. This last epiphany
was something we all ought to have
known and indeed somewhere
along the road of my fandom I ac
knowledged that Leßron James is
the superior player but Friday
night was the first time I ever really
had to come to terms with it.
Kobe Bryant may never play
again; more shockingly, he is getting
old. (Old for a basketball player, that
is another way in which sports
can be disorienting.)
I have probably spent more time
shouting at Kobe on the TV than I
have cheering for him. There are a
number of things I intensely dislike
about Kobe's game constantly
calling isolation plays for himself, his
general disinterest in playing de
fense (and how he was picked year
after year for the All-Defense team,
I'll never know), his lack of passing
and his willingness to take the sort of
shots that my coach benched me for
in high school.
Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals
was the perfect Kobe Bryant game
6-for-24 from the field, countless
bad decisions, countless moments of
unthinkable brilliance and eventual
ly the victory.
However, this last season was
bizarre; Kobe was constantly adjust
ing his style to the Lakers' personnel
and even averaged ten assists a
game for a good stretch of the sea-
son. As star after star went
down, he remained the sole
constant through the entire
year. Without Kobe Bryant,
the Lakers would be a 35-win
team.
But now he is gone at
least for the time being
the Lakers are on the verge
of missing out on the playoffs
for the first time since 2005.
For a fan who's as accus
tomed to success as I am, the
world now looks completely
different.
