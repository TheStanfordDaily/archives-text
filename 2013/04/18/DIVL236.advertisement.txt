Art exhibit 6:30 - 9:00 pm
Panel: 7:00 - 8:30 pm
Cubberley Auditorium
School of Education
Stanford University
Free and open to public
Over the years, artists, scientists, engineers, and humanities
schotars have explored the grand themes that define the human
condition from radically different perspectives. Too infrequently,
they are given the opportunity to listen to each other and engage
in conversations that cross boundaries and mix up categories.
Join us for SMMMASH "Language", which will feature some of
the most exciting thinkers in the Bay Area. Panelists for this
program include: Lera Boroditsky, Psychologist and Stanford
Assistant Professor of Psychology; Curtis Frank, Stanford
Professor of Chemical Engineering; Jeanne Finley, Filmmaker
and Video Artist and Amy X Neuburg; Composer and Performer.
The panel will be moderated by author Piero Scaruffi.
To complement the panel, artists from different media genres will
exhibit works that relate to "Language" in the lobby of the auditorium.
