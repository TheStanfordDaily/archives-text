## Violations silly, do Ducks no good 
### Joseph Beyda 
Over the last two years,
NCAA violations have
given me a whole lot to
write about: how Stan
ford's academics-first
approach casts doubt on pay-for-play
systems for collegiate athletes, how
sanctions like those at Ohio State often
harm fan bases and entire institutions
instead of the perpetrators within the
violating athletic department and how
USC's postseason ban made a mock
ery of the inaugural Pac-12 Title
Game.
This week it's Oregon, which ad
mitted to at least one major recruiting
violation (while contesting another) on
Monday night and proposing a self
imposed two-year probationary peri
od and the loss of one scholarship for
three seasons. Those penalties will
still likely be increased by the NCAA,
which is slightly more suspicious that
Oregon's $25,000 payment to recruit
ing evaluator Willie Lyles was a front
for Lyles to direct recruits to Eugene
—which would be another major viola
tion.
Regardless, Oregon's sanctions will
be light compared to those received by
other big-name violators of the recent
past because the Ducks' missteps were
relatively minor. But even without bowl
bans or significant scholarship cuts,
there's still something incredibly funny
about what transpired at Oregon.
The high-flying Ducks are now
veering just a little bit south and
they had to be pretty dumb to let it
happen.
In January 2010, Oregon was com
ing off of a close loss (against none oth
er than Ohio State) in the Rose Bowl,
its fifth consecutive postseason appear
ance. The Ducks would return most of
the big names from the team that
reached Pasadena: 1,500-yard rusher
LaMiehael James, reliable backup
Kenjon Barner and a host of defensive
playmakers (Casey Matthews, John
Boyett, Spencer Paysinger, Kenny
Rowe). At the time it looked like quar
terback Jeremiah Masoli would be
back as well; for the sake of argument,
though, even after Masoli was sus
pended for a felony burglary experi
enced senior Nate Costa and speedy
redshirt sophomore Darron Thomas
were ready to step up as more than
competent replacements.
The moral of the story is that the
Pac-10 belonged to Oregon that offsea
son. The Ducks had creamed once
powei'house USC in 2009 and the Tro
jans were expected to receive signifi
cant sanctions due to their own NCAA
violations. (As it turned out, USC was
n't eligible for a bowl—Rose or other
wise —in 2010). Stanford wasn't quite
on the national map, and with Tbby
Gerhart gone, few people expected the
Cardinal to compete with the Ducks
for a second straight year. Nike
founder Phil Knight had just donated
$lOO million, much of which would go to
state-of-the-art facilities, to the Oregon
athletics program.
Why, then, did Oregon head coach
Chip Kelly find the need to pay Lyles
thousands of dollars to steer a single
player, Lache Seastrunk, to the pro
gram? Seastrunk might have been
one of the best recruits in the country,
but at a time when the USC case had
put everyone on alert for recruiting
violations, why would Oregon, a pro
gram that was already dominant and
had a roster chock-full of future col
lege stars, stick its neck out?
A year later, when Yahoo! Sports
reported on the incident, Kelly re
portedly scrambled to request player
profiles from Lyles to justify the
$25,000 payment. Of course, the pro
files were a year old and clearly useless
to Oregon at that point, only adding
to the program's embarrassment.
If you're Kelly, would it have hurt
to ask for those profiles when you
made the paymentl
To top it all off, Oregon never
needed Seastrunk in the first place.
The Ducks' depth chart at running
back was so deep that he left for
greener (yes, greener than Oregon)
pastures at Baylor, where he rushed
for over 1,000 yards in 2012, when
the scandal broke.
Maybe those out-of-date player
profiles weren't the most useless
part of the deal for Oregon after all.
The net result is that Oregon has
had to deal with a black cloud hang
ing over its head for two-plus years
(spanning multiple recruiting sea
sons), lost the recruit it worked so
hard to bring to Eugene and now will
forfeit at least three scholarship
years. It was predictable, and it has
stupid written all over it.
Oh yeah, and the Ducks' purse is

now $25,000 lighter. But I'm
not one to complain I al
ways thought Oregon had a
bit too much green.
