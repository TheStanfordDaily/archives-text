## OREGON ADMITS TO 'MAJOR' RECRUITING VIOLATION 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's main football rival
over the last three seasons, Ore
gon, admitted to at least one major
NCAA violation by its football

coaches in a report released Mon
day night, marking the most defin
itive move since the Ducks' contro
versial dealings with talent evalua
tor Willie Lyles were exposed in
early 2011.
Oregon has proposed a self-im

posed two-year probation and the
loss of a single scholarship for the
next three years.
Portland's KATU television
first reported the Ducks' suggest
ed penalties after the program ac
knowledged that its football coach

es committed at least one major vi
olation related to the NCAA's ongo
ing investigation into their recruit
ing practices from 2008 to 2011.
Oregon will still face the
NCAA's infractions committee,
which may very well increase the
penalties, regarding the investiga
tion. Negotiations by the two sides
broke down in December.
Former head coach Chip Kelly,
who was at the helm of the pro
gram when the violations occurred,
may have left the University of
Oregon behind for green(er) pas
tures in Philadelphia, but the for
mer Stanford football nemesis ap
pears to have bailed out of Eugene
at exactly the right time.
Yahoo Sports! reported in 2011
that Oregon had paid Lyles' service
$25,000 for a national recruiting
package. Lyles later admitted that,
in the days before the story ran,
Kelly had asked him to compile
player profiles to legitimize the
transaction. But those profiles
were a year out of date, and suspi
cion spread that the payment was
actually meant for Lyles to direct
one of his advisees, running back
Lache Seastrunk, to sign with Ore
gon. Seastrunk did end up with the
Ducks before later transferring to
Baylor.
The NCAA's ensuing investiga
tion marked the Pac-12's most sig
nificant incident since a scandal in

the USC football, men's bas
ketball and women's tennis
programs. The Trojan foot
ball team was punished with
a two-year bowl ban (in 2010
and 2011) and lost 30 scholar
ships over three years.
Oregon's penalties won't
be as harsh, as NCAA inves
tigators had "no finding of
lack of institutional control
and no finding of unethical
conduct," two of the most im
portant factors in the USC
case.

Stanford upset the then-
No. 2 Ducks 17-14 at Autzen
Stadium last year, marking
the Cardinal's first win
against Oregon since 2009. In
each of the last three seasons,
the game has kept the other
wise undefeated loser out of

onship.
This season, Oregon and
Stanford meet in a marquee
showdown on a Thursday
night, Oct. 7, at Stanford Sta
dium.
