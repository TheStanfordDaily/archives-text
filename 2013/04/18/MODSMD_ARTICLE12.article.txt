# NO. 8 BEARS BACK FOR REVENGE
## 
### WILL SEATON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis
team (16-3, 8-2 Pac-12) knows the
proper way to finish the regular
season by facing off against big
time rival Cal (14-5, 8-1 Pac-12) in
the Big Slam.
Stanford hasn't lost a match to
Cal in its last seven competitions,
dating back to April 2009. The last
time these two teams met, Stanford
came away with a demonstrative 6-
1 victory that proceeded to kick off
a seven-match winning streak. In
that game, the Cardinal proved
dominant in doubles and singles,
taking the doubles point and the top
five singles points before losing at
the No. 6 spot.
"It's a great matchup for us be
cause it's been going well for our
team the past few years," explained
junior Nicole Gibbs. "It's their
home court, so we're expecting a
closer battle than we had against
them last time earlier in the season.
They also had a couple injuries so
it's going to be a more competitive
match this time but we're feeling
confident in our play and excited to
face them."
The matchup will be more com
petitive for Stanford this time
around as both teams are hovering
around a top 10 ranking. The Cardi
nal is ranked 12th in the nation and
playing for a chance to share the
Pac-12 title if UCLA can upset No.
5 USC this weekend. California is
ninth in the nation and fighting for
its own chance to share the title.
This match falls on Berkeley's sen
ior day and will provide extra moti
vation for Cal's two senior players

Taylor Davis and Annie Goransson.
Stanford is coming into the
match with great momentum. It
has won five matches in a row, in
cluding two impressive wins over
the ranked A'izona schools. Every
player has been peaking, but none
more so than Gibbs, who was re
cently named Pac-12 Player of the
Week. She achieved this by defeat
ing Arizona's Lacey Smyth 6-3, 6-1
and then overcoming 16th ranked
Jacqueline Cako of Arizona State 6-

4, 7-5. She also went 2-0 in doubles
competitions with partner and fel
low junior Kristie Ahn.
"It was a really cool honor for
me to receive this week and really
good for my confidence in my sin
gles play," explained Gibbs. "It's
nice to get back to form. I had a
couple of really good matches re
cently and it was awesome to get
recognized like that going into such
a big match against Cal, but I'm not
really thinking about that anymore.

I'm just trying to continually im
prove and get ready for NCAAs
and the postseason."
Cal is also riding on its own end
of-season momentum. The Bears
have won four straight and nine out
of their last 10 matches. Against op
ponents they share with Stanford
this season, the Golden Bears have
gone 10-3. Their biggest losses
came against the Los Angeles

Recent Pac-12 Player of the Week Nicole Gibbs (above) will lead No. 12 Stanford in its quest for an eighthstraight
win against archrival Cal. The Bears, however, have surged to No. 8 in the national rankings and
are looking to defend their home court in the Big Slam to close out the 2012-13 regular season.
