# SPORTS BRIEF
## Saint Mary's shocks Stanford 5-2 
### â€“ George Chen 
No. 15 Stanford Softball certainly
wasn't expecting a loss on Wednesday
night when it played host to Saint
Mary's, a team that had a 2-9 road
record coming into the contest.
But the Gaels got the best of the
Cardinal in the midweek matchup, with
freshman pitcher Kelsey Stevens giv
ing up three earned runs in four in
nings of work and senior Teagan Ger
hart allowing two runs in relief to pick
up the loss.
Saint Mary's started heating up
when Brittany Sabatini hit a solo home
run to leftfield in the top of the third.
Stanford answered immediately, as
sophomore Cassandra Roulund's single
in the bottom of the inning brought soph
omore Leah White home from second.
The Cardinal briefly broke the 1-1
tie when senior Sarah Hassman batted
in pinch runner Tyiyn Wells in the
fourth, but Saint Mary's came roaring
back with two runs off a solo shot and
a sacrifice fly to take the lead for good.
Stanford hopes to bounce back this
weekend when it travels to Washing
ton for a three-game series. Friday's
first pitch is scheduled for 5 p.m.
