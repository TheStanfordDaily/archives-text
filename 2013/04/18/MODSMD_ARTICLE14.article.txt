## GROWING IN A MODERN WORLD Pollination and Pesticides 
### Graciela Watrous 
Honeybee hives are collapsing
at alarming rates in the
United States. Over the last
several years, annual losses have av
eraged around 33 percent, while de
mand for pollinating bees around
the country has grown. California
will be especially affected by contin
uous decline in bees and bee health,
as the state produces $l6 billion
worth of specialty crops in need of
pollination.
Specialty crops, which are fruits
and vegetables, require more polli
nation in order to grow than crops
like corn and soy and are the back
bone of California's agricultural out
put. Nearly all of our almonds, for
instance, are grown in California,
and two bees are needed for every
acre of almonds. The decline of the
bee population has the potential to
lead to unemployment and deprive
many people of nutritious food. The
USDA estimates that one in three
mouthfuls of our food benefited
from bee pollination in some way.
It remains unclear why bee
colonies are collapsing, and politics
and economic force have obscured
the truth, pitching the pesticide in
dustry against environmentalists
and beekeepers. Simply put, the de
bate goes something like this: envi
ronmental and consumer groups ar
gue that a specific class of pesticides
called neonicotinoids are causing
beehive collapse, while the pesticide
industry mainly Syngenta and
Bayer, two large corporations
claims that the decline in the bee
population is due to a complex range
of reasons.
The science is unclear about the
decline in health among bee
colonies, and there have been sever
al studies supporting each side of
the argument. But a recent USDA
study represents perhaps the most
significant voice on the problem, not
because only because of what the
data shows, but also because it high
lights our government's aversion to
meaningful action on the topic. The
study, published in 2011, links pesti
cides to the weakened immune sys
tem of bees. Compounding the prob
lem, there's no incentive for the cor
porations that make the chemicals
to change; fines for misusing prod
ucts like these are minimal.
On April 10, 2013, various non
profit organizations concerned with
consumer protection and the envi
ronment, along with beekeepers
themselves, announced that they
are going to sue the EPA for allow
ing conditional registration of neon
icotinoids. (Conditional registration
means that any new pesticide of the
kind in question will be approved
without going through a complete
background investigation process.)
This is not the first time that the
EPA has been at the center of the
pesticide debate. In 2010, an EPA
memo was leaked that acknowl
edged the negatives effects of pesti
cides on bees. The language of the
memo was definitive. It stated that
"Acute toxicity studies to honey bees
show that clothianidin is highly tox
ic on both a contact and oral basis."
But controversially, the EPA contin
ues to claim that more research on
the problem needs to be done, and

more importantly, they continue to
loosen regulation of these products.
But there are also important cri
tiques to be made of the position
that the environmental and con
sumer groups take. The first is that
Syngenta and Bayer's products ap
pear to be safe in moderation. The
companies' side of the story goes
something like this: farmers are un
der pressure to keep their yields up,
so instead of using the specified
amount of product, they overuse
these pesticides without realizing
the potential consequences on bees.
The other major arguments to be
made are that, while these pesti
cides may be contributing to colony
collapse, there are several other
more influential factors, like varroa
mites, transportation pressure (who
knew bees get transported coast to
coast to pollinate our crops?), and
malnutrition due to crop monocul
tures; bees simply don't have
enough variety in their diet to stay
alive.
Debate about this topic reaches
beyond the US and into Europe.
The EU is in the process of attempt
ing to ban the type of pesticides in
question, and countries like France,
Germany, Italy, and Slovenia have
already suspended their use in some
cases.
In some ways, this debate is a
symbol of many other debates in the
American agricultural system. It
highlights the power dynamics be
tween small specialty crops growers
and large agribusinesses. Our gov
ernment, with its publicization of
this issue through Senate hearings
in the Environment and Public
Works Committee, has attempted to
bring pesticide usage concerns to
the forefront of the agricultural is
sues today, but has not specified any
intention of changing legislation to
address this problem. And this
seemingly obscure issue not only ef
fects beekeepers, it has the poten
tial to hinder the specialty crops
movement sweeping this country
and change our food system in
unimaginable ways.
This may be one of those cases
where large corporations, like Bay
er and Syngenta, are simply evil and
profit driven. But this also might be
a case in which just because one of
these corporations makes an argu
ment that would protect their profit,
it doesn't automatically make their
argument illegitimate.

It remains
unclear why
bee colonies are
collapsing.
Honeybee hives are collapsing
at alarming rates in the
United States. Over the last
several years, annual losses have av
eraged around 33 percent, while de
mand for pollinating bees around
the country has grown. California
will be especially affected by contin
uous decline in bees and bee health,
as the state produces $l6 billion
worth of specialty crops in need of
pollination.
Specialty crops, which are fruits
and vegetables, require more polli
nation in order to grow than crops
like corn and soy and are the back
bone of California's agricultural out
put. Nearly all of our almonds, for
instance, are grown in California,
and two bees are needed for every
acre of almonds. The decline of the
bee population has the potential to
lead to unemployment and deprive
many people of nutritious food. The
USDA estimates that one in three
mouthfuls of our food benefited
from bee pollination in some way.
It remains unclear why bee
colonies are collapsing, and politics
and economic force have obscured
the truth, pitching the pesticide in
dustry against environmentalists
and beekeepers. Simply put, the de
bate goes something like this: envi
ronmental and consumer groups ar
gue that a specific class of pesticides
called neonicotinoids are causing
beehive collapse, while the pesticide
industry mainly Syngenta and
Bayer, two large corporations
claims that the decline in the bee
population is due to a complex range
of reasons.
The science is unclear about the
decline in health among bee
colonies, and there have been sever
al studies supporting each side of
the argument. But a recent USDA
study represents perhaps the most
significant voice on the problem, not
because only because of what the
data shows, but also because it high
lights our government's aversion to
meaningful action on the topic. The
study, published in 2011, links pesti
cides to the weakened immune sys
tem of bees. Compounding the prob
lem, there's no incentive for the cor
porations that make the chemicals
to change; fines for misusing prod
ucts like these are minimal.
On April 10, 2013, various non
profit organizations concerned with
consumer protection and the envi
ronment, along with beekeepers
themselves, announced that they
are going to sue the EPA for allow
ing conditional registration of neon
icotinoids. (Conditional registration
means that any new pesticide of the
kind in question will be approved
without going through a complete
background investigation process.)
This is not the first time that the
EPA has been at the center of the
pesticide debate. In 2010, an EPA
memo was leaked that acknowl
edged the negatives effects of pesti
cides on bees. The language of the
memo was definitive. It stated that
"Acute toxicity studies to honey bees
show that clothianidin is highly tox
ic on both a contact and oral basis."
But controversially, the EPA contin
ues to claim that more research on
the problem needs to be done, and

more importantly, they continue to
loosen regulation of these products.
But there are also important cri
tiques to be made of the position
that the environmental and con
sumer groups take. The first is that
Syngenta and Bayer's products ap
pear to be safe in moderation. The
companies' side of the story goes
something like this: farmers are un
der pressure to keep their yields up,
so instead of using the specified
amount of product, they overuse
these pesticides without realizing
the potential consequences on bees.
The other major arguments to be
made are that, while these pesti
cides may be contributing to colony
collapse, there are several other
more influential factors, like varroa
mites, transportation pressure (who
knew bees get transported coast to
coast to pollinate our crops?), and
malnutrition due to crop monocul
tures; bees simply don't have
enough variety in their diet to stay
alive.
Debate about this topic reaches
beyond the US and into Europe.
The EU is in the process of attempt
ing to ban the type of pesticides in
question, and countries like France,
Germany, Italy, and Slovenia have
already suspended their use in some
cases.
In some ways, this debate is a
symbol of many other debates in the
American agricultural system. It
highlights the power dynamics be
tween small specialty crops growers
and large agribusinesses. Our gov
ernment, with its publicization of
this issue through Senate hearings
in the Environment and Public
Works Committee, has attempted to
bring pesticide usage concerns to
the forefront of the agricultural is
sues today, but has not specified any
intention of changing legislation to
address this problem. And this
seemingly obscure issue not only ef
fects beekeepers, it has the poten
tial to hinder the specialty crops
movement sweeping this country
and change our food system in
unimaginable ways.
This may be one of those cases
where large corporations, like Bay
er and Syngenta, are simply evil and
profit driven. But this also might be
a case in which just because one of
these corporations makes an argu
ment that would protect their profit,
it doesn't automatically make their
argument illegitimate.
