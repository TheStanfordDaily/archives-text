## Beauty in Boston 
### Adam Johnson 
I One week ago, Boston's NPR ra
dio station ran a piece called
"The 'Beauty' of the Marathon."
After the events on Monday, this ti
tle would surely be replaced with a
phrase portraying chaos, casualties,
terrorists and explosions. Surely it
was a tragic day. But despite the hor
rors, there was beauty to be found.
To quote wise words from the late
Mr. Rogers: "When I was a boy and
I would see scary things in the news,
my mother would say to me, 'Look
for the helpers. You will always find
people who are helping.'"
Indeed, within seconds of the
blasts, people were rushing to give
aid. Fortunately, there were dozens
of EMTs and police already on the
scene. But photos and videos also
show military veterans, doctors and
other civilians rushing to aid the vic
tims, whether that meant applying
tourniquets, clearing fences to allow
ambulances and paramedics to ac
cess the scene, or comforting the
wounded.

One of these responders' stories
is particularly touching. Carlos
Arredondo, an immigrant from Cos
ta Rica, had already amassed quite
the life story before Monday's
events. In 2004, his eldest son died in
battle while serving our nation in
Iraq. Shortly after being notified of
his son's death, Carlos doused him
self in gasoline and lit himself on fire,
after which he was rescued but not
after suffering severe burns. After
his yearlong recovery he joined oth
er families of deceased soldiers to
advocate for peace, only to be beaten
in 2007 by members of a right-wing
group at an anti-war march. And
just four years later, Carlos' younger
son, coping with depression stem
ming in part from his brother's
death, took his own life. Since then,
Carlos has also been a promoter of
improved suicide prevention policy.
Despite having countless reasons
to despise this country Carlos (now
a citizen) passed out American flags
for the first four hours of the
marathon. And when the bombs
went off, he rushed towards the
scene and helped in whatever way he
could. In the iconic photo where Jeff
Bauman —in grave condition —is
being carted away in a wheelchair
with both legs severed, Carlos is by
his side.

Carlos, with an intense look of de
termination on his face, is holding
shut what appears to be an artery
with his ungloved hands. Today, Jeff
is alive and in stable condition;
Arredondo, who also applied a
tourniquet to Jeff's other leg, almost
certainly saved his life. While the
three lives lost should not be forgot
ten, the fatality count would have
been higher were it not for the brav
ery and resolve of Carlos and other
first responders.
Following our survival instinct,

many of us would have turned from
the blast and ran. If this were not
enough, we are taught to avoid dan
ger- a tenet of basic first aid courses
is to only approach the scene once it
is determined to be safe (the Boston
sidewalk was anything but safe at
that moment). And yet, as Mr.
Roger's mother told him, there will
always be people running towards
chaos, ready to help. Sometimes,
these first responders are doing
their job. But, like the principal at
Sandy Hook who rushed from rela
tive safety to defend her children,
they could be people like you and
me.
Some people reacted to the
bombing in Boston with utter gloom:
<rp**« wor id" was a common
phrase posted on Facebook and
Twitter. Although there is a time for
grief and anger, if we constantly ap
proach humanity with pessimism,
we will surely not be lost to find
countless other unexplainable, tragic
events; a fact of life is death, and few
among us are fortunate enough to
die peacefully in old age. Indeed,
with media outlets that push the
gloomy stories front and center, it is
easy to overlook moments of beauty.
It is easy to forget that for every one
perpetrator, there are countless oth
er humans supporting and loving
each other. For every one bomber in
Boston on Monday, there were
scores of people who rushed into
danger to give aid, hundreds in
cluding exhausted runners—who
swiftly donated blood, thousands
who attended candlelight vigils in
memory of the victims, and millions
who made sure to call their loved
ones.
If we allow it, the world can be a
beautiful place. Whereas some may
see a wounded soldier, I saw a corri
dor in Midway Airport a few months
ago erupt in standing ovation as he
returned home. Whereas some may
see a Stanford student with alcohol
poisoning, I notice how there is al
most always a friend, or even a
stranger, comforting her. These mo
ments are easy to forget, but they're
there. And while they do not bring
those lost back to life nothing will
they give the survivors, all of us,
reason to not only endure, but also
appreciate what we still have.

If we allow it,
the world can
be a beautiful
place.
