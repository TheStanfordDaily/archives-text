Since its inception, Addepar a wealth man
agement consulting firm founded by Joe Lons
dale 'O4 and currently led by Mike Paulus 'lO M.S.
'll has been working to make strides in the
area of data usage for financial analysis and man
agement.
'After the crisis, there has been a recognition
that investors need better technology," Paulus,
Addepar's president, said, referencing the firm's
extensive use of data analysis. "They need tools
to analyze what is going on in their portfolios,
what is the risk, what are they holding and so on.
That was really the genesis of Addepar it was
solving this problem."
Banking on data
In 2009, Addepar was founded in a small house
in the Marina area of San Francisco. After the
first six months of work, according to Paulus, all
that the firm had determined was the complexity
of the financial system they sought to address.
"If you look at finance today, the core problem
is that no one has their money in one place, espe
cially after the financial crisis," he said. "Until
then, people never thought about where they put

their money, but after that they did. Now every
one has money diversified and stored all over."
The firm turned to data analysis as a means of
addressing that disparate distribution of assets,
integrating business acumen with technological
savvy.
"What you need, if you're managing a lot of
money, like an endowment or a pension fund, is to
have all that data in one format and an analysis
report so that you can see your global expo
sures," Paulus said.
"We aggressively seek out the best engineers
in the world, and empower them to build beauti
ful, truly innovate platforms," he added. "There
is a partnership between the business and engi
neering side for that... We think it is really im
portant to get the best group of people in a
room."
Paulus cited the integration of both market
data and data on firms' holdings as differentiating
Addepar's approach to consulting and allowing
more complex analysis.
"Theoretically, you have the kind of data
where you could predict the market and make a
lot of money [for ourselves]", he said. "We're not
going to do that, thoughâ€”we're the good guys."
According to Paulus, that analysis and the
transparency it encourages could play a role in

preventing another financial crisis.
"One of the problems that cause the financial
crisis was that people did not know what kind of
and how much risk they were exposed to," he said.
"If you want to prevent the next financial crisis,
part of it is regulatory, but the other part is giving
the end wealth holder the power to understand
what is going on."
"We are very passionate about changing fi
nance if you want to change the world, finance
is a huge lever," he elaborated, commenting on the
firm's greater vision. "By helping a retirement
