# ALL OZER THE PLACE
## Junior returns from injury to lead Cardinal in scoring 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
After missing the majority of last
season with an injury, Stanford
lacrosse's junior Rachel Ozer was
recently named to the watch list
for the Tewaarton Award. The at
tacker joins teammates and classmates Anna
Kim and Lyndsey Munoz on the list of top
prospects for the honor, which is given annually
to the top women's collegiate lacrosse player in
the country
Ozer has tallied 31 goals and 15 assists in 12
games this season to lead the Cardinal in her
triumphant return to the field.
"[Ozer] is one of the most dynamic attackers
in the country with her stature she's really
difficult for defenders to match up against, and
she just creates a lot of opportunities," said
Stanford head coach Amy Bokker. "She's a
great player, and she's starting to really make a
name for herself because she's so difficult to
keep up with."
After scoring 15 goals and nine assists while
appearing in every game of her 2011 freshman
campaign, Ozer and her team entered 2012
with high hopes. That came crashing down
literally when Ozer broke her collarbone five
games into the season.
"I was just driving into the goal and I think
I was trying a little bit too hard to get in there
when there were a lot of defenders," Ozer re
called. "I either got tripped or pushed, but I

from her injury in 2011-12 with 31 goals and 15
assists this season, numbers that have earned her
notice as a national player of the year candidate.
was suddenly in the air and I
landed right on my shoulder."
Ozer ended up having sur
gery and was forced to watch
from the sideline as the Car
dinal produced an 8-10 sea
son that ended with a loss to
Oregon in the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation
championship game, falling
short of earning a play-in
game bid for the NCAA
Tournament.
"We didn't have our
strongest season last year
and it's hard to be on the
sideline and feel like you
couldn't help out the team
when you really wanted to,"
Ozer said.
Despite the injury, Ozer
remained an active part of the
program, even continuing to
travel with the team to road
games. While she was on the
sidelines, her coaches worked
to keep Ozer involved mental
ly even if she couldn't partic
ipate physically.
"We charged her with
trying to gain a coach's per
spective from the sideline,
trying to watch and see dif
ferent developments and
watch how different defenses
played," Bokker said. "We
were hoping to train her to
become that coach-figure on
the field leading into this
year."
Bokker said that despite
Ozer's natural inclination to
be more quiet and humble,
her insights help the team
perform better.
"She's not someone who
will call out orders on the
field," Bokker said. "But

when the team comes in the
huddle, she will explain what
she sees and give her opinion
that way."
Ozer was able to start
playing casually last summer
and was fully recovered by
the time the Cardinal began
training again in the fall. Oz
er said she was helped by the
fact that broken collarbones
are usually not lingering in
juries.
"It's an injury where I got
the surgery and then I am
able to be fully recovered,"
Ozer explained. "When I
started playing again, being
able to have full range of mo
tion was kind of weird, but
you adjust pretty quickly
it was a pretty smooth recov
ery."
The attacker's presence
on the field has certainly
helped her team this year as
the Cardinal has put togeth
er an 8-4 record, with all four
losses coming against teams
currently ranked in the top
11 nationally.
Ozer ranks seventh in the
MPSF in points per game
and has scored in every
game this season except for
the Cardinal's loss to No. 4
Northwestern last Sunday.
Ozer gave credit to her
teammates for helping her
both during and after the in
jury, noting that after the in
jury, she counted on her
teammates to help with basic
tasks like driving her car or
putting her hair up into a
ponytail.
This season, Ozer said a
supportive offense has
helped her succeed in her re
turn to the field.
"The nice thing about our
team is that anyone on the
attack can score and we have
a lot of depth this year," Ozer
said. "The defense can't just
focus on shutting me off be
cause if they do, my team

mates will all be there. That
definitely eases the burden
of not feeling like I have to do
everything."
Although Ozer is academ
ically a junior, the Cardinal
can look forward to contribu
tions from her on the field for
the next three years. Be
cause Ozer only played five
games last year, she was able
to redshirt the season and
maintain her eligibility.
Ozer, who is currently
majoring in atmosphere and
energy engineering, plans to
take advantage of Stanford's
coterm opportunities and re
main with the team for a fifth
year, which Bokker de
scribed as "huge" for her
squad.
"That just says a lot
about our program and a lot
about what it means to her,"
Bokker said. "Her potential
to get even better as she
grows through the next
three years is going to be
huge, and we're really excit
ed to have her be a part of it."
But for now, Ozer's focus
is on the present as the Car
dinal looks to bounce back
from its disappointing post
season result last season.
"We're all really fierce
competitors, so we all want
to get back to where we were
and go even further," Ozer
said. 'We all have dreams of
the national championship,
and it starts with an MPSF
championship, but we think
we're on track to do good
things."
The Cardinal has four
regular season games left be
fore it enters the MPSF
Tournament, with a berth in
the NCAA tournament po
tentially following. The win
ner of the Tewaarton Award
will be announced on May 30.
