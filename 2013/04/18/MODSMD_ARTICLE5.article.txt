# Library builds living archive
## Digital, print collection first of its kind 
### BRITTANY TORREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's archives might not be
the first place one looks on the Farm
for innovation and new technologies.
However, Stanford Libraries' recent
partnership with renowned environ
mental architect William McDo
nough may change that with the cre
ation of a "living archive," the first of
its kind.
The archive will hold not only all
of McDonough's papers but also
reflecting an era of increasing digital
ization and technological innovation
recordings of all his meetings and
phone calls, sent to the University in
near-real time.
"It started when I first met Bill
McDonough in relationship to work
ing on a museum exhibition project

with the Buckminster Fhller
archive," said Roberto Trujiilo, head
of the libraries' Special Collections.
McDonough said that Fhller, who
influenced McDonough's work, and
IMer's archive, which is also housed
by Special Collections, inspired his
participation in the project. He began
his role as a living archive a few years
after his initial meeting with Trujiilo.
"I just can't imagine a better
place to do it," McDonough said.
"[Stanford] is so perfect."
McDonough's own personal phys
ical archive a collection of sketch
es, writings, and other various paper
material —is estimated to be over
2,000 linear feet. It will take approxi
mately three years to process all of
the current material.
Rather than posing a chal
lenge of time, however, com
piling a digital archive has
posed tests of technological
innovation. Throughout the
project's preliminary stages,
University archivists have
worked to establish a archiv
ing method for digital docu
mentation in an effort led by
Michael Olson, digital collec
tions project manager.
'M this point what we're
doing is the scoping exercise
for what it would take to do the
software development," Olson
said.
Olson framed his role as de
termining the personnel and
software needs posed by the
project, as well as devising
means of working with both
the physical and digital
archives.
"There's all these new for
mats of media coming along,"
Olson said. "What we're trying
to do is to hopefully be able to
build in some emulations so
you'll be able to look at some of
the older stuff and some of the
newer stuff to create a more
seamless environment."
Olson said that he ultimate
ly envisioned software that
could be leveraged for other
archives and made open
source.
"This isn't going to be a
stand alone thing," Olson said.
"McDonough has hopes that
other people can use this sort of
infrastructure and that it will
create new ways of collaborat
ing in the architectural world
and in environmental design."
"We had worked a few
years ago on an online delivery
tool for bom-digital material
and money had run out," said
Glynn Edwards, head of tech
nical service for Special Collec
tions. "But this is going to give
us the opportunity to do inter
views with... other people who
are part of this archive and fig
ure out what everybody's
needs and desires are when
working with these materials
online."
Trujillo expressed hope
that a variety of students would
benefit from the archive's con
tent.
"His w0rk...1 felt was
broad enough to have an inter

est to a student at Stanford
working on an undergraduate
paper, or a doctoral student
working in School of Engineer
ing or the design school or the
art department or public policy
[program]," Trujillo said.
"I'm hoping they can get
their own archive out of it," Mc-
Donough said, describing the
archive as a gift that will keep
on giving.
During a public talk on
Wednesday, McDonough
stressed the importance of
leaving a legacy behind.
"If you give someone the
notion that what they're doing
matters and they can record it
and that somebody might care
about it like their great-great
grandchildren, they'll find out

'Who was grandma?'" McDo
nough said.
Trujillo emphasized the po
tential for the archive's expan
sion and the emphasis on shar
ing and collaboration with oth
er institutions.
"We're starting with Bill
and we're going to see how this
goes," Trujillo said. "I think in
the archiving community, this
is the next step."
"We can't do it all so some
body else should do it too," he
added. "Others will do others
and between all of us there's
that much more access to this
kind of content. It's a public
good in a bunch of ways."

"I'm hoping they can get
their own archive out of it," Mc-
Donough said, describing the
archive as a gift that will keep
on giving.
During a public talk on
Wednesday, McDonough
stressed the importance of
leaving a legacy behind.
"If you give someone the
notion that what they're doing
matters and they can record it
and that somebody might care
about it like their great-great
grandchildren, they'll find out

'Who was grandma?'" McDo
nough said.
Trujillo emphasized the po
tential for the archive's expan
sion and the emphasis on shar
ing and collaboration with oth
er institutions.
"We're starting with Bill
and we're going to see how this
goes," Trujillo said. "I think in
the archiving community, this
is the next step."
"We can't do it all so some
body else should do it too," he
added. "Others will do others
and between all of us there's
that much more access to this
kind of content. It's a public
good in a bunch of ways."
