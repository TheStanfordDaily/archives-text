Stanford's archives might not be
the first place one looks on the Farm
for innovation and new technologies.
However, Stanford Libraries' recent
partnership with renowned environ
mental architect William McDo
nough may change that with the cre
ation of a "living archive," the first of
its kind.
The archive will hold not only all
of McDonough's papers but also
reflecting an era of increasing digital
ization and technological innovation
recordings of all his meetings and
phone calls, sent to the University in
near-real time.
"It started when I first met Bill
McDonough in relationship to work
ing on a museum exhibition project

with the Buckminster Fhller
archive," said Roberto Trujiilo, head
of the libraries' Special Collections.
McDonough said that Fhller, who
influenced McDonough's work, and
IMer's archive, which is also housed
by Special Collections, inspired his
participation in the project. He began
his role as a living archive a few years
after his initial meeting with Trujiilo.
"I just can't imagine a better
place to do it," McDonough said.
"[Stanford] is so perfect."
McDonough's own personal phys
ical archive a collection of sketch
es, writings, and other various paper
material â€”is estimated to be over
2,000 linear feet. It will take approxi
mately three years to process all of
the current material.
