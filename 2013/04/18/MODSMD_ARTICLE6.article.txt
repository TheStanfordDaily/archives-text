## PBS films doc about design class 
### SARAH MOORE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ME 206A&B: Entrepreneurial Design
for Extreme Affordability a two-quar
ter course offered by the Hasso Plattner
Institute of Design (d.school) through the
Graduate School of Business (GSB) and
the department of mechanical engineer
ingâ€”will be featured in an hour-long
documentary on PBS this fall.
The class, which is in its 10th year, has
allowed 325 students to work with global
partners in 14 countries to create prod
ucts that improve the lives of impover
ished people. This year, the 40 graduate
students in the course are collaborating
with five global partners to manage the
design of 10 new products.
James Patell, a GSB professor and a
member of the teaching team, said that
the course aims to teach students valuable
lessons that can be difficult to impart in a
traditional classroom setting.
"We want students to have the experi
ence of having taken a difficult project
from beginning to end, to have worked on
a real-world project for real people and to
have developed the creative confidence
that would enable them to be dropped
down into any difficult, messy situation, to
land on their feet and to make real
progress quickly," Patell said.
The class is open to students of all de
partments, and students from almost 30
programs have participated. More than
130 students applied for 40
spots in the course this year.
Patell said that when review
ing applications, he and the
teaching team focus more on
a student's enthusiasm than
his or her major or program.
"First of all, we're looking
for people's passion [and] if
they're really committed to
this," Patell said. "It's a big
undertaking, and we're look
ing for people who really
want to make it happen."
Additionally, the teaching
team looks for students with
the right combination of spe
cific skills needed by the
courses' global partners. For
example, in a year with pre
dominantly medical partners,
the teaching team will pick
more students with medical
backgrounds.
According to Patell, sever
al products created during
the course have become ex
tremely successful. D.light, a
solar-rechargeable LED light
developed by students in 2006
for use in Myanmar, has sold
almost three million products
in 40 countries.
Patell also referenced Em
brace, a low-cost infant
warmer originally designed
by students in 2007, as anoth
er notable product developed
during the course. Hospitals
and orphanages around the
world now use Embrace,
which students created in

partnership with Medicine
Mondiale.
Seth Norman MBA 'l2,
who took the class in 2010,
worked with hospitals in
Bangladesh to create an infu
sion pump that functions with
any type of IV bag or tubing.
Such a pump reduces costs
for hospitals by eliminating
the need to buy more expen
sive bags and tubes from
American or British compa
nies.
Norman cited the ability
to meet and work with stu
dents from other programs as
one of the class' distinguish
ing appeals.
"The biggest things that I
learned dealt with having dif
ferent types of people on the
same team, people who work
differently and have different
backgrounds," Norman said.
'At the same time, the biggest
challenges were sorting out
the process of working as a
team."
While Norman called the
class a "life-changing experi
ence," he acknowledged that
the course also offers a heavy
workload and experiences po
tentially beyond some stu
dents' comfort zones.
Ralph King '7B, who pro
duced and co-directed the
documentary, originally
learned about the course as a
student at the GSB. He audit
ed the class in 2010, traveling
to Myanmar with a project
group, and was inspired to
create the film.
"I was just filled with what
I'll call ecstasy because for
the first time in 25 years [as a

journalist], I understood the
difference between gathering
facts and observing with an
open heart," King said. "Not
only did I have an insight for
the team that helped in the
design of the product, but I
had a sense of a new capacity
within myself to take in infor
mation that wasn't strictly
factual but on an emotional
level."
King raised $650,000 for
the documentary and filmed
from January to June 2011.
His crew did pre-interviews
with all 40 students in the
course, eventually choosing to
focus on three who were ar
ticulate, emotionally honest
and interesting to a general
audience, according to King.
The editing process took
approximately a year, and the
documentary premiered to a
Stanford audience at a
packed CEMEX Auditorium
on April 9.
Patell said that he was sat
isfied with how the film de
picted the course and the way
in which King told the story
of three specific students' ex
periences.
"I think overall, Ralph did
a good job of acknowledging
the flow of what goes on, but
the story is about the stu
dents," Patell said. "He
picked three students on
whom he focused, and it's
much more the story of then
three personal experiences,
what they did, what they felt,
how they changed."
