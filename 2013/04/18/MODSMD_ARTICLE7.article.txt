## Flipside's app wins hackathon 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of current and former
staffers of The Stanford Flipside, a
weekly satirical publication, won a
"comedy hackathon" held at Twit
ter's San Francisco headquarters in
early April with an app that allows
users to quickly insert text into
modified Wikipedia pages.
Flipside President Conor Do
herty 'l3 said that the motivation
behind the "Citation Needed" app
was to "prove to your friends things
that you made up that aren't true."
"There can never be factual dis
putes anymore because everything
is Googleable," Doherty said. "[The
app] won't actually edit the
Wikipedia page, but it will make a
facsimile page with the false infor
mation that you wanted to prove to
your friends."
More than 65 participants com
peted through 16 projects at the
Comedy Hack Day, which was host
ed by Cultivated Wit. According to
Cultivated Wit CEO Baratunde
Thurston, the hackathon was the
first third-party event hosted at the
Twitter headquarters.
Thurston compared the event to
a next-generation comedy show,
put on with the intent of creating a
new genre of humor. In the future,
Thurston expressed hope that com
edy hackathons will become regu
lar events, just like other comedy
shows.
"The idea was to take a
hackathon and make it better,"
Thurston said. "It was definitely
successful â€”we had participants
make comedy apps in a weekend, or
less. It was brilliant."
Thurston said that while there
were "a bunch of weird, fun proj
ects" at the event, The Flipside's
app stood out because it was fully
functional as well as funny.
"It was good tech that actually
works," Thurston said about The
Flipside's entry. "They had real
code that ran."
The Flipside team was one of the
largest at the event, with 15 mem
bers. Doherty said that the leaflet's
founder Jeremy Keeshin 'l2 and
former vice president Zach Galant
'l2 wrote most of the code in less
than an hour, though other team
members contributed to the coding
as well.
"We had the best combination of
a product that actually worked and
something funny," Doherty said.
"There were a lot of other good
ideas, but they weren't able to quite
implement them."
According to Doherty, the com-
ical theme of the theme of
the event continued through
the awards ceremony, where
the team members were
handed "a ridiculous number
of trophies."
"The whole thing was a
visual gag," said current
Flipside vice president Kyle
Hoffer 'l4 said. "They hand
ed us a comically large num
ber of trophies and took pho
tos of us struggling with
them."
The team also won one
year subscriptions to
Git Hub and Radio, a promo
tional suite for the app from
funnyordie.com, 100,000
Mail Chimp credits and a trip
to Los Angeles for an event
hosted by The Nerdist.
According to Doherty,

the event was probably the
last comedy hackathon that
the Flipside will compete in.
Doherty said that the team
would "like to go out on top,"
and expressed uncertainty
about whether development
on Citation Needed would
continue.
"Some people might
work on it in the future, but
right now, not much," Do
herty said. "No one really
penciled in working on a
comedy app into their spring
quarter schedule."
Hoffer, however, was
more optimistic about the fu
ture of the app.
"All the work was there,"
he said. "Some people might
be excited about it and might
want to turn it into an actual
app right now, it's just a
website optimized for mobile
devices."
