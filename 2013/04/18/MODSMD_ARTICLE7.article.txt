## Flipside's app wins hackathon 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of current and former
staffers of The Stanford Flipside, a
weekly satirical publication, won a
"comedy hackathon" held at Twit
ter's San Francisco headquarters in
early April with an app that allows
users to quickly insert text into
modified Wikipedia pages.
Flipside President Conor Do
herty 'l3 said that the motivation
behind the "Citation Needed" app
was to "prove to your friends things
that you made up that aren't true."
"There can never be factual dis
putes anymore because everything
is Googleable," Doherty said. "[The
app] won't actually edit the
Wikipedia page, but it will make a
facsimile page with the false infor
mation that you wanted to prove to
your friends."
More than 65 participants com
peted through 16 projects at the
Comedy Hack Day, which was host
ed by Cultivated Wit. According to
Cultivated Wit CEO Baratunde
Thurston, the hackathon was the
first third-party event hosted at the
Twitter headquarters.
Thurston compared the event to
a next-generation comedy show,
put on with the intent of creating a
new genre of humor. In the future,
Thurston expressed hope that com
edy hackathons will become regu
lar events, just like other comedy
shows.
"The idea was to take a
hackathon and make it better,"
Thurston said. "It was definitely
successful â€”we had participants
make comedy apps in a weekend, or
less. It was brilliant."
Thurston said that while there
were "a bunch of weird, fun proj
ects" at the event, The Flipside's
app stood out because it was fully
functional as well as funny.
"It was good tech that actually
works," Thurston said about The
Flipside's entry. "They had real
code that ran."
The Flipside team was one of the
largest at the event, with 15 mem
bers. Doherty said that the leaflet's
founder Jeremy Keeshin 'l2 and
former vice president Zach Galant
'l2 wrote most of the code in less
than an hour, though other team
members contributed to the coding
as well.
"We had the best combination of
a product that actually worked and
something funny," Doherty said.
"There were a lot of other good
ideas, but they weren't able to quite
implement them."
According to Doherty, the com-
