## Researchers cultivate blood database Biobank will allow researchers to identify cancer's blood markers 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at the Stan
ford Cancer Institute and the
Cancer Prevention Institute
of California (CPIC) have laid
the groundwork for a compre
hensive database that will
contribute to earlier detection
of cancer through blood tests,
through soliciting tens of
thousands of blood samples.
More than 50,000 female
teachers and school adminis
trators around California
were recently approached
about submitting blood sam
ples to the database. Accord
ing to Tina Clarke, a CPIC re
search scientist and a member
of the Stanford Cancer Insti
tute, about 25,000 people are
expected to agree to blood
sampling.

Clarke said that those will
ing to participate will be asked
to fill out five detailed ques
tionnaires and schedule an ap
pointment to get their blood
drawn. Their blood samples
will be frozen in a biobank and
analyzed over time to see
whether there are similarities
among the blood samples of
those subjects who eventually
develop cancer.
"We store samples from
women who are healthy, but
also at the age where cancer
rates are high," Clarke said.
"If they develop cancer later
on in life, we can go back to
these samples and look for
early markers of cancer."
The effort is part of the
California Teachers Study,
which collected data on more
than 133,000 current and for
mer public school teachers
and administrators through
questionnaires in 1995 and
1996.

Researchers have stayed
in contact with the partici
pants to determine whether
or not their answers to ques

tions about their lifestyle,
health and medical history
correlate with the probability
of cancer incidence.

Since the study initially
sought to investigate breast
cancer, the participants are all
female, although researchers
hope to use the samples for
the early detection of other
kinds of cancer as well.

Professor of Urology
James Brooks M.D. 'BB, who
is also a member of the Stan
ford Cancer Institute, said
that the process of using blood
tests for the early detection of
cancer is "very challenging,"
as it involves finding blood
markers that are both sensi
tive and specific to cancer.
"By sensitive, I mean you
need to find the cancer when
it's curable," Brooks said.
"Sometimes that means find
ing a cancer that is one cubic
centimeter the size of a
sugar cube —in order to
make a big difference in the
number of women dying of
ovarian cancer."

According to Brooks, find
ing such markers is no easy
feat, as many of the proteins
that indicate the presence of
cancerous cells are also sig
nals of other diseases. Once
those markers are identified,
researchers can run tests on
the biobank's collection of old
blood samples to determine
which components predict
cancer's onset.

However, though DNA se
quencing technologies capa
ble of finding mutations that
signify the presence of certain
types of cancer currently ex
ist, the technologies are still
too expensive to be used regu
larly and need refinement be
fore they can be incorporated
into reproducible clinical
tests.

According to Clarke, it will
likely take 15 to 20 years, as
well as the right expertise, for
the study's "exciting vision" of
allowing early cancer detec
tion through blood tests to be
translated to reality.

Researchers nonetheless
emphasized the study's significance,
noting that it can be linked to other
databases and participants' infor
mation updated as long as they con
tinue to reside in California.

"What CPIC has put together is
very valuable, and will get more
valuable with the passing of time,"
Brooks said. "People underestimate
how hard and expensive this is to
do."
