## SEEING GREEN Sacred 
### Holly Moeller 
lam a runner. I was born a run
ner: I was the kid at recess
sprinting back and forth on the
field for the sheer joy of it. (Some
times, I pretended to be a horse and,
post-Jurassic Park, a velociraptor. I
was not the most popular child.)
I was raised a runner; Mom took
me to the trails behind her gym
every week, and Dad spent count
less hours timing splits while I tried
to lower my mile time.
And, many years after leaving
competition behind, if you ask me
for a few words that describe my
self, "runner" always comes first.
That's why, every year that I lived in
Boston, Patriots Day found me
strapping on my running shoes and
jogging out to the nearest point on
the Marathon race course. There I'd
sit or, as my body temperature
dropped, jog in place long after
the elite runners passed, cheering at
random for those who passed by,
feeling my legs twitch with a special
kind of envy. "Maybe next year I'll
qualify." And, year after year, ex
cuse after excuse, remembering the
sights and sounds and smells, re
peating "Maybe next year."
This year was not my year.

A small, ashamed voice (which
I've tried to ignore all week while
continually refreshing The Boston
Globe's Twitter feed) is grateful.
Grateful for blistering new shoes in
January, laziness in May, even a
quad tear in August. Grateful that I
spent Marathon Monday a continent
away from two shrapnel-packed
pressure cookers and the carnage
they would inflict.

The rest of me is heartbroken.
And, for the first time in many
years, there's a place in the pit of my
stomach that is filled with cold, un
wavering fury. I know it will be a
long time before I can forgive.
The Boston Marathon bombing
hit hard because it hit things that are
sacred. It destroyed human life. It at
tacked human achievement in (per
haps only a runner would say this)
one of its purest forms. It left perma
nent scars of varying severity on all
who bore witness, who know the city,
who love the race. It shook us.

That's the thing about all that we
find sacred. The sacred has, almost

by definition, the power to uplift us,
to move us, to challenge us. But its
loss has an equal power: that of dev
astation.

Monday's attack was also sud
den. Dramatic. Shocking. The im
ages streaming through televisions,
computers, and phones were vivid.
It was impossible not to be shaken.

Such events throw our lives into
sharp relief. They give us perspec
tive on our own struggles, and our
individual achievements. The stories
of the victims fill us with sadness,
but the stories of the heroes fill us
with hope. When we turn away from
the news and, as we must, back to
the tasks at hand, we are filled with
new resolve. We move forward, with
a new appreciation for life.
Let some of that appreciation in
clude a greater awareness of all that
is sacred to us.

The sacred is also the deeply per
sonal. In the strictest sense, it is the
holy and the divine. For many, it is al
so the unconditional love of friends
and family. For some, it is fundamen
tal rights and freedoms, like those
enshrined in this country's law. For
others, it is the stillness of nightfall in
the High Sierra, or the rhythm of the
sea hundreds of miles from land.

It is easy to believe that what we
hold sacred is unshakeable, unas
sailable. So often, we think of these
sacred things only when they are
threatened or, worse, lost to us. And

not all losses happen with a bang, as
in Boston. Some of them are grad
ual, insidious. They erode in parts,
far away, with little acknowledge
ment and less media coverage.
Sometimes, we do not even notice
the sacred, slipping slowly away.
Let us, then, be vigilant. Let us
pray our prayers and run our races.
Let us say "I love you" and hike in
wild places. Let us know the sacred
today so that we can protect it, res
cue it, and treasure it tomorrow.
