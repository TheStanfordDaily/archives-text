## Ghosts of baseball games past 
### Sam Fisher 
I'm coming up on the three-year
anniversary of the most fun trip
I've taken in my life so far. For the
last six weeks of high school, two
of my friends and I traveled the East
Coast and Midwest to see Major-
League Baseball games at the differ
ent parks.
I'm not sure IH ever come up with
an idea that better melds my love of
sports, adventure and, of course, food.
For those six weeks, besides a few
breaks for AP exams, my life was just
travel, friends and baseball. I'm still
not sure how I sold it to my school as an
acceptable "Independent Senior Proj
ect." There was something in that pro
posal about rediscovering my love for
America through baseball... and the
promise of a blog.
It may sound silly but there was
something almost therapeutic about
waking up, driving 300 miles, going to
a baseball game, going to sleep, and
waking up to do it all again the next
day It almost mimicked a baseball sea
son, or at least a short segment of one.
The day of the trip that I'll never
forget was the day we woke up in Day
ton, Ohio, planning to drive 200 miles
north to catch a Tigers game that night
We had the tickets bought, the accom
modations at my aunt's in Ann Arbor all
set up, but Mother Nature intervened.
When I woke up, it was raining, and
the weather map showed that the game
in Detroit was nearly certain to be
rained out With only a few weeks to see
as many games as possible, a night
without baseball did not sound very
good.

So while my Mends showered, I
looked up all the places within driving
distance before a night game that would
leave us close enough to Chicago to
catch the Cubs game the following day
—we weren't going to take Wrigley
Field out of our plans for anything.
As it turned out, St. Louis was the
perfect fit. We booked a hotel, bought
tickets, called my aunt to cancel our
lodging and our* parents to let them
know, and made an audible. And we
were rewarded Busch Stadium
ended up being perhaps our favorite
stadium.

So why bring this up now? Unfor
tunately life at Stanford is about as far
from that trip as it gets for a 20-year
old. The not-having-to-worry-about
the-rain part isn't too bad, but the abil
ity to drop everything and just go? I
haven't had that in a while.

Ironically, it's been the opposite. As
the spring has become busier and
busier, I've found myself chopping
more and more baseball to stay afloat.
First, it was so that I could have more
time at home over spring break with
my family to relax. Then it was so I
wouldn't have to miss spring football.
Now, it's sometimes just so I have time
to sleep or see my friends from fresh
man and sophomore year* all the way
across campus in Suites.
It's taken almost three years, but
I'm becoming the Stanford student
that I've always joked about. I'm the
kid who is too busy to go the sporting
events, even ones I love like baseball.
I never thought it could happen. I
mean, I might be the biggest sports fan
on campus—much to the dismay of
my parents. But it's happened to me.
For some, it's the struggles of
freshman year* and learning how to
succeed at a place like Stanford. For
others, it's the rigors of the Humßio
core or ME 101 that rock your world
sophomore year. But, as I'm finding
out now, it happens to everyone.
But sports aren't the only casualty
For me, because of how much I love
them, they're becoming the final casu
alty. But much goes before them. Out
side of the dining halls and The Daily,
I'm finding less and less time for the
quintessential Stanford activity:
spontaneous conversations with
those around me.
So what's the answer? I don't
know, but I don't think 8:30 a.m.
classes are going to fix anything...
It might sound crazy, but maybe
Stanford, at least after freshman
year, is a little too hard, a little too
much work. Because if I, the kid who
chose to drive 300 miles a day to
watch baseball, can't find the time to
go to baseball games that are a
three-minute bike ride away, there's
something wrong.
And I think you'd be surprised at
how much good can come out of a lit
tle down time. Anyone who's lived in
a Stanford freshman dorm certainly
knows. Why not keep it going?

The real reason Sam Fisher is too
busy far baseball is because of his in
ternship at CoHo. Ask him why he
isn't blagging about that at safish
