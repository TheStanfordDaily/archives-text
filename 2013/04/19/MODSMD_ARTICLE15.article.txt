# STACKING 'EM UP
## 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Seven top-10 finishes, two in
dividual victories and a 10-
under 61 round. Even for
your above-average colle
giate golfer, these may be
performances accumulated over a
couple seasons or perhaps an entire
career. A 61 might seem like a score
only attainable by those in the profes
sional ranks. But that particular stat
line belongs to one Mariah Stack
house, who is not just your above-av
erage collegiate golfer—she's a su
perstar, albeit a budding one, who has
accomplished more in eight collegiate
tournaments than some do in 80.

Staekhouse picked up a club for
the first time at age two and began
tournament play at age six, but the
child prodigy was kept grounded by
her parents, saying that "golf was
never something that was forced on
me."

"I was never raised to be a golfer,"
Stackhouse said. "My parents always
put school first. If my academics were
suffering, then I wasn't going to play
golf. There's a life after golf, and I
don't want to play it forever I have
dreams past golf and other things I
want to do."

With priorities on athletics and ac
ademics, Stanford seemed like the ob
vious choice for Stackhouse. Stack
house said that balancing school and
golf has been a challenge, but by man
aging her time, she has enjoyed both.
"I don't think the academic rigors
of Stanford impact the way I prepare.
I'm not one of those people who likes
to spend my life on the golf course,"
Stackhouse explained. "I definitely
have time to do my schoolwork, and I
use my weekends for that purpose. I
just don't believe in being on the golf
course for hours —it can be almost
counterproductive if you spend too

much time out there."
Don't be fooled, though she
puts in her work, usually between
two-and-a-half and five hours on the
course per day. But while consistent
practice allows her to excel with her
drives, chips and putts, Stackhouse
credits her father for her cool, calm
on-course demeanor.

"My dad [Ken] did not tolerate me
having a bad attitude on the golf
course," she explained. "He would
get more upset at the fact that I had
a bad attitude than if I had a bad
round, which really brought things
into perspective for me."
It's that kind of collected, mature
on and off-course personality that has

allowed Stackhouse to block out all
kinds of challenges, including a
coaching change before arriving at
Stanford. When the coach who re
cruited her to Stanford, Caroline O'-
Connor, resigned last May, Stack
house admitted to being a bit unset
tled.

"There was about a month block
where nobody knew who the coach
was going to be, and I was kind of
freaking out," Stackhouse said. "I
liked Coach O'Connor and I had an
idea of what I was getting into [before
the change]. I was like 'Oh my god, I
could end up with a crazy coach.'"
Sudden coaching changes like the
one Stackhouse and her teammates

endured often result in players de
committing from or leaving a particu
lar program. Despite the upheaval,
Stackhouse kept an open mind and
immediately reached out to new
coach Anne Walker, who was hired in
late July 2012.

Stackhouse said she likes that
Walker provides both the structure
needed for success and the sense of
humor to keep golf enjoyable.
"Most importantly, she knows
how to make everyone believe in
themselves. She talks to each one of
us and pumps us up," Stackhouse
said. "She believes that we can do it,
