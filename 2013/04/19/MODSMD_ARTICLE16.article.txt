## Stanford faces Long Beach in MPSF quarters 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford hits the road
this Saturday to take on No. 2 Long
Beach State in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) quarter
finals this weekend. At this point, a
loss will likely mean the end of the
season for the Cardinal (15-12,12-12
MPSF) as only four teams make the
NCAA Tournament.

The two previous meetings with
the 49ers have resulted in 3-0 and 3-
2 Cardinal losses, but Stanford
hopes to reverse that when it mat
ters most.

Long Beach State features a pro
lific offensive attack lead by junior
outside hitter Taylor Crabb. Crabb
ranks third in the MPSF with 4.15
kills per set while hitting an excep
tional .353 on the season. In the ear
lier meetings between the two teams
this season, Crabb led all players
with 15 kills in one match and 17 in
the other, while hitting a combined
.413. Shutting him down will be cru
cial for the Cardinal.

Stanford, however, is not to be
cowed by Crabb's numbers. Junior
opposite Daniel Tublin stated that
the key to stopping any great play
er down is simply to "take away his
tendencies," and Stanford will be
sure to try to do that on Saturday
night.

The 49ers are no one-man show,
however, as they feature dangerous
offensive players at multiple posi
tions — in then* last matchup with
Stanford on March 30, four players
posted double-digit kills. Then* of
fensive attack is controlled by junior
setter Connor Olbright, who ranks
fourth in the MPSF with 10.76 as
sists per set.
Long Beach State also brings a
lot of balance on the defensive end.
The 49ers are ranked first in the
MPSF in digs per set, and fourth in
opposing hitting percentage. Long
Beach State has three players in
Rthe top 15 in digs per set, demon
strating that they have defensive

playmakers all over the court.
Stanford, however, is more than
ready for the challenge of the 49ers.
The Cardinal enters the match hav
ing won three of its past five games,
including a massive 3-2 victory over
then-No. 5 Cal Baptist. Stanford al
so played Long Beach State tough in
the last meeting, rallying from a 2-0
to take the match into a fifth set,
where the Cardinal ultimately lost.
While Stanford has consistently
been led on offense by its star jun
iors, opposite Brian Cook and out
side hitter Steven Irvin, both of
whom are in the top 15 in the MPSF
in kills per set, the Cardinal has been
happy to see other players raising
their level of play in recent weeks.
The junior middle blocker tan
dem of Denny Falls and Eric
Mochalski has averaged 15 kills and
nine blocks a game between them
over the past five games, while
Tublin has chipped in eight kills and
five digs per contest over the same
span.

Similar to the 49ers, the Cardinal
features a strong defensive effort,
ranked third in the MPSF in digs
per set and fifth in opposing hitting
percentage. In what is certain to be a
defensive battle, Stanford hopes that
its recent uptick in offensive per
formance from supporting players
will be enough to overcome Long
Beach State.

If Stanford wins, they will still
face an uphill battle in the quest for
the MPSF championship, as they
face the winner between No. 2 UC-
Irvine and No. 7-UC Santa Barbara.
Surviving that will put them in the
championship match, where a re
match with No. IBYU likely awaits.

Stanford needs to win all three of
these games to put themselves in po
sition to compete for the NCAA
Championship. The Cardinal's quest
for its third national championship
will begin at 7 p.m. Saturday night in
Long Beach.
