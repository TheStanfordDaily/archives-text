# Revenge series looms for Card
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
It all began with Arizona.
Last March, Stanford baseball
traveled to Tucson as the No. 2
team in the country but the No. 8
Wildcats tore the Cardinal apart in
a three-game sweep. Arizona went
on to become the conference co
champion en route to its fourth na
tional title. Stanford, on the other
hand, finished in a tie for fourth in
the Pac-12 and couldn't make it to
Omaha.

So even though this year's show
down between the No. 21 Wildcats
(24-12, 8-7 Pac-12) and No. 17 Car
dinal (20-11, 7-5 Pac-12) isn't being
billed as a showdown of West Coast
heavyweights, it still could shake up
the Pac-12 standing and has the
chance to, once again, throw the los
er's season off course.

"It stung... they kind of embar
rassed us last year," said junior
right-hander A.J. Vanegas. "We're
pretty pumped up as a team to have
them come in here and play us and
hopefully get a shot at revenge."
The Cardinal is three games be
hind conference-leading No. 5 Ore
gon State, with the Wildcats a game
and a half behind their host this
weekend. Stanford is coming off
three straight 2-1 series victories,
which is something the team hangs
its hat on even though those tri
umphs have come against Pac-12
bottom-feeders Washington State,
USC and Washington.
"We keep telling ourselves that
college baseball is all about winning

series," said redshirt sophomore
catcher Brant Whiting. "We have
played the four worst teams in the
conference so far, but I think our
past couple of games we've played
our best baseball, as far as our of
fense and our pitching clicking at
the same time."

Vanegas and Whiting have been
two of the biggest parts of that im
provement, even though neither
one was expected to factor in very
much a couple of months ago. Vane
gas injured his back before the sea
son, while Whiting was coming off
an injury-plagued year that saw
him relegated to bullpen duty.
But Whiting took over for strug
gling sophomore Wayne Taylor be
hind the dish and has kept up his
hot streak ever since, now leading
all Cardinal hitters with a .418 aver
age. He is just three RBI short of
the team lead, even with 30 fewer
at-bats than his fellow starters, and
enters the weekend having record
ed two hits in each of Stanford's last
three games.
Vanegas, on the other hand, has
provided solid relief work for the
last month while mentoring a host
of young Cardinal hurlers. Fresh
men Bobby Zarubin, Logan James
and Marcus Brakeman started 2013
with several dominant outings but
have fallen off significantly since
the start of conference play.
"A lot of people don't see what
we think out there as pitchers, but
especially [when we're] young, we

to reverse that result in this weekend's series at the Sunken Diamond.
sort of don't know how long
the season is," Vanegas said.
"Once we experience failure,
it's like you start panicking,
you try to change yourself.
We don't realize that it's a
long season. We start getting
in our heads a little bit.
"As an older guy, it's sort
of our responsibility to keep
reminding them that it hap
pens, it's baseball, it's a long
season. It's our job to just
keep on reminding them to
keep trusting the process,
and hopefully the results will
show."
After senior ace Mark
Appel (6-2) on Friday, Stan
ford is expected to start
righty Dean McArdle (2-1)
on Saturday and lefty John
Hochstatter (2-1) on Sunday.
Hochstatter is coming off a
complete-game win against
Washington a week ago.
Offensively, the Cardinal

will look to get some of its
slumbering bats going
against a Wildcat pitching
staff that has yet to give up
double-digit runs this season.
In particular, Stanford hasn't
gotten the contributions it
expected in 2013 from veter
ans Brian Ragira (.270), Lon
nie Kauppila (.229) and soph
omore Alex Blandino (.238),
who broke onto the scene as
a freshman before falling
back so far this year. Ragira
and Blandino combined for
five RBI in the Cardinal's 9-2
win against Pacific on Tues
day.
Ragira also had three hits
and three runs in the team's
win last Sunday, which
marked the Cardinal's first
victory in a series finale since
March 3.
"When you win the first
two and you lose the Sunday
game, you won the series,
but you're still kind of dissat
isfied after the series," Vane
gas said. "So it's kind of a
good motivation tool I'd say."
Stanford will have its
hands full this weekend,

however, as the Wildcats'
third starter, sophomore
lefty Tyler Crawford (4-1,
2.56 ERA) has arguably had
more success than any other
Arizona pitcher this season.
That's saying something, giv
en that the Wildcats will also
send out to the mound a pair
of juniors who have com
bined for 62 starts over their
Arizona careers.
It's a sign of things to
come for the Cardinal, which
now enters one of the tough
est stretch runs in recent
memory. Five of the team's
last six series are against
ranked conference oppo
nents.
"We've been waiting a
long time for this part of the
schedule," Yanegas said. "We
feel like everything's sort of
been building up to here."
Appel takes the mound
tonight at 7 p.m., with 2-p.m.
matinees at the Sunken Dia
mond on Saturday and Sun
day.
