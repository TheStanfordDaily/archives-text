## GARETH BARKER WELSH ARTIST BRINGS JAZZ-POP FUSION TO MUSIC SCENE 
### Tracy Vu | Staff Writer 
-w- * -y+iile only eighteen years
\ l\ / old, Gareth Barker has
T â–¼ already gained interna
tional attention in his newly founded
music career. With no family in the

music industry, Gareth has had to
build his own career from the bottom
up. His musical education has includ
ed an emersion in artists like Ronan

Keating and Gary Barlow, allowing
him to quickly gain prominence as a
young new jazz-pop artist. He's
already snagged the attention of
Hollywood, having performed in a

private show for Peter Jackson, lan
McKellen and the entire cast of "The
Hobbit." Recently arriving back to
New Zealand after months of conti

nent-hopping, Gareth Barker takes a
break from the recording of his new
album to speak with the Stanford
Daily about how his music journey
has been so far.

Intermission (INT): Gareth, your
website says that you've always been
shy singing, but when did you decide

that you had the courage to start
singing in front of other people?
Gareth Barker (GB): Two years ago,
I moved halfway around the world
from Wales to New Zealand. It was a
scary move, being in a new place so
far from home. I made this recording
of me singing and decided to drop it
off with the only music teacher in my
new school. He didn't even know who
I was, but he gave me such good feed
back. Shortly after that, he got me on
stage, and I went from being this shy,
new kid to singing in front of the
whole school.
INT: Your music has been compared
to various artists from Michael Buble
to Bruno Mars. How would you
describe your sound and which artists
have influenced you?
GB: I would describe it as a more
youthful Michael Buble with a mix of

Ed Sheeran or Bruno Mars. I do draw
a lot of my influences from Michael
Buble's music, as he inspired me by
the way he sings, performs and inter
acts with fans. I like artists like Ed
Sheeran and Bruno Mars because
they sound just as good live as they do
in the studio. That's really something I
strive for.
INT: How did you know that you
wanted to pursue a music career? Did
you have any other plans?
GB: Well, I only really decided that I
would pursue music two years ago. I
always sang around the house and it
used to always make me happy, but I
really didn't consider a music career
until moving to New Zealand. Before
that, I was thinking of doing some-

thing with animals, looking at being a
vet or something. But my parents'
support has been everything to me. I
couldn't have done it without them.
They really pushed me to pursue my
passion, and they've been behind me
every step of the way.

INT: From your Facebook statuses, it
seems like you've been traveling a lot
lately to work on your music. Where
did you go and what was that experi
ence like?
GB: Absolutely amazing. My new
album, "Hello World," is the result of

my music journey that has taken me
across three different continents. For
example, I went to New York to write
music, recorded the album in
Canada, hopped on a plane to France
for a music conference ... I mean lit
erally, I was traveling and seeing new

things every week. It wasn't just all
fun though. This whole year working
on the album has been a lot of work.
Every song is original and they each
have a personal meaning to me in
their own way. It's exciting to see the
album finally come together, defi-

nitely like a dream come true. I can't
wait to hear the feedback from my
fans!

"Hello World," Barker's debut album,
will be released on Apr. 23. Listen to
his lead single, "Say," here.
