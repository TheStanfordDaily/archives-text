came under fire yesterday after
the writer of an article published in
Imprint Magazine in 2006 tweeted
that The Review had plagiarized
his work.

Dan Cassavaugh and The Re

Athletes Get Paid? by Yasant Ra
machandran 'll M.S. 'l2 shows
distinct similarities in structure
and phrasing, including one para
graph (the second-to-last in both
cases) that is almost identical be
tween the two versions.
Of the 120 words in Cas
savaugh's second-to-last paragraph,
103 were directly replicated in Ra
machandran's second-to-last para
graph.
