# MAKE SURE TO SEE THIS
## Spring Breakers Skin, skin-on-skin and maybe some feminism 
### Sarah Lyo | Staff Writer 
It's already been a full three now going
on four weeks since spring break, but
you can still revisit the vacation through
director Harmony Korine's latest film,
"Spring Breakers." Selena Gomez, Vanessa
Hudgens, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine
star as American college students whose hedo
nistic spring break turns distinctly criminal.
Before heading to the party proper, they hold
up a fast-food restaurant with hammers and
realistic-looking water pistols to obtain cash
for their trip. When they eventually make it to
a Florida beach, they are jailed for the use of
illegal substances during a beachfront party.
Rather unbelievably, the girls are then bailed
out by Alien, a gangster and rapper (played,
with great enthusiasm and often to unintend
ed humorous effect, by James Franco), who
introduces the quartet to his illicit and luxuri
ous lifestyle.
Though excessive both in terms of style
and content, "Spring Breakers" is not
"American Pie." There's a lot of skin, skin on
skin, alcohol, drugs and passed-out girls
the movie is R-rated for a reason but there
are also pink ski masks, guns and violence, as
well as enough intelligent undercurrents to
make this an interesting film.
In fact, it's not too much of a stretch to
describe the movie as "feminist." A bit count
er-intuitive, maybe, to label a movie satiated
with images of breasts and bikini-clad girls
this way. But if you look at the controversy the

movie has garnered simply on the basis of the
nudity and its inclusion of gun-wielding girls,
it's not so surprising after all. The girls refuse
to be objectified in the most traditional sense:
they defy the moviegoer's expectations by
shooting guns and killing people instead of
pouting and generally looking stupid.
"Spring Breakers" can also be read as a
critique of contemporary youth, especially of
that privileged, mostly white socioeconomic
class that can afford to party wildly for a week
before returning to the safe and insulated
environment of the college campus. The
generic beach in Florida exists as a playground
for them another 1950s Cuba again at
the expense of the locals who belong to an
emphatically different background.
One scene is especially striking. After the
bail-out, the girls meet Franco's genuinely
sleazy friends for the first time, and one of the
girls a devout Christian aptly named Faith
(Gomez) wants out, despite having been
open earlier to all manners of partying. The
movie offers a clever depiction of the culture
that middle America is so frequently stereo
typed by: the willingness of middle-class
white people to adopt black culture so long as
there is no direct interaction with the actual
people.
As Franco observes, "Spring break is
when the scum arrive." Harmony Korine
clearly doesn't fudge the issue.
