## EANAB bars to operate on Row 
### LIAM KINNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cardinal Nights the Office of Alcohol Policy and
Education (OAPE)'s alcohol-free entertainment ini
tiative will operate equally attractive non-alcoholic
beverages (EANAB) bars on the Row on weekend
nights starting at Admit Weekend's Black Recruit
ment & Orientation Committee (BROC) party.
According to Matthew Billman 'l5, one of the stu
dents leading the project, the bars will offer an alter
native for students choosing not to drink.
"I call them nucleation sites for people who choose
not to drink [and] have the Row experience without
the alcohol pressure," Billman said. "They'll serve al
most as social networking opportunities for sub
stance-free people."

The bars will be transferred between party loca
tions using a golf cart and will feature virgin cocktails
inspired by those served at last year's Lagunita Din
ing Hall Mocktail Thursday nights.
"We'll be mixing drinks and then maybe having
information sheets saying 'this is what we're doing;
this is why we're here, etc.,"' Billman said. "It will
[have] all the furnishings of a normal bar without the
alcohol."
