## EANAB bars to operate on Row 
### LIAM KINNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cardinal Nights the Office of Alcohol Policy and
Education (OAPE)'s alcohol-free entertainment ini
tiative will operate equally attractive non-alcoholic
beverages (EANAB) bars on the Row on weekend
nights starting at Admit Weekend's Black Recruit
ment & Orientation Committee (BROC) party.
According to Matthew Billman 'l5, one of the stu
dents leading the project, the bars will offer an alter
native for students choosing not to drink.
"I call them nucleation sites for people who choose
not to drink [and] have the Row experience without
the alcohol pressure," Billman said. "They'll serve al
most as social networking opportunities for sub
stance-free people."

The bars will be transferred between party loca
tions using a golf cart and will feature virgin cocktails
inspired by those served at last year's Lagunita Din
ing Hall Mocktail Thursday nights.
"We'll be mixing drinks and then maybe having
information sheets saying 'this is what we're doing;
this is why we're here, etc.,"' Billman said. "It will
[have] all the furnishings of a normal bar without the
alcohol."
The bar will also provide
students who choose to
drink with a chance to
sober up with some EAN
AB s that are more elabo
rate than the average mix
er, according to Billman.
"We really hope that this
project will lower transports
and encourage healthier
drinking habits such as
keeping yourself hydrated if
you do choose to drink," said
Elizabeth Patino 'l4, who
has collaborated with Bill
man on the project.

The EANABs bars idea
came out of a brainstorm
ing meeting hosted by
OAPE last fall, reflecting
input from OAPE, the In
ter-Fraternity Council, the
Inter-Sorority Councils, a
group of Stanford parents
and Billman and Patino,
who are residents in Mir
rielees' substance-free
housing program. The com
mittee will meet again in

coming years to discuss
progress on the initiative.
Angelina Cardona 'll,
OAPE assistant director
and community engage
ment coordinator, high
lighted the project's stu
dent leadership.
"[Billman and Patino]
came to me for advise on
how to move their concept
forward," Cardona said.
"We will work with [them]
to evaluate the effective
ness of the EANAB bar and
strategize next steps."

Billman and Patino will
submit the project budget
next week as they prepare
for the bar's trial run dur
ing Admit Weekend.
"It makes me incredibly
proud as a member of our
community to know that
students are not only think
ing of ways to better the
health and wellness of
peers and promote inclu
sion, but that they are also
willing to put the time and
energy into making it a real
ity," Cardona said.
