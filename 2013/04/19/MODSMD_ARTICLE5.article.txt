# Privacy policy offers strict protections
## Administrators' access to student accounts limited 
### FOLUKE NUNN 
Even as the controversy surrounding
Harvard's secret searches of staff mem
bers' email accounts deepens, an examina
tion of Stanford's privacy policies suggests
that such a controversy may be precluded
by severe limitations on the information
and account access afforded to University
administrators.

Stanford's Internet Privacy Policy
By registering on Stanford's network,
computer users allow Academic Computing
Services (ACS) to collect basic information
about their devices, including make and
model, IP addresses, operating systems
and hardware addresses.

ACS also collects personal information
from network users, including phone num
bers, email addresses and residential in
formation. According to ACS, this data is
used primarily to provide technical sup
port or generate statistics about device
trends, which inform policy and user support
decisions.

Access to information collected by ACS
is restricted to employees who are involved
with user support, and no personally identi
fiable information is shared outside the
University unless it is requested by court
order, subpoena or emergency circum
stances.

Brad Hayward, senior director for
strategic communications, wrote in a state
ment to The Daily that Stanford "does not
monitor individual student or employee
email or Internet usage in any ongoing
way."

According to Hayward, only Tina Dar
mohray, chief information security officer,
can authorize a review of user information.
Hayward said that these reviews are done
in consultation with the Office of General
Counsel to "fully ensure the appropriate
practices are followed."
Hayward emphasized that the Universi
ty "only accesses information in response
to a situation that truly demands it," adding
that these situations arise very infrequent-
ly. According to Hayward,
whether or not an individual
is notified before their infor
mation is accessed depends
largely on the situation.

"If a member of the Uni
versity community went
missing for an extended peri
od and there was a serious
safety concern for that indi
vidual, or if an investigation
was underway with respect to
employee fraud or misuse of
funds, it obviously would not
be feasible to provide notice
to the individual involved,"
Hayward said.
However, Hayward said
that if a student or faculty
member's information were
the subject of a subpoena,
the University would offer
notice before accessing the
information.

Ryan Globus'l4, a Resi
dential Computer Consultant
(RCC) in Florence Moore
West, said that RCCs also
have limited access to student
information.

According to Globus,
RCCs can view the types of
electronic devices registered

to each network user, as well
as the IP addresses, phone
numbers, SUNet IDs and
room numbers of the users.

"We're only allowed to use
those for RCC purposes, and
we're allowed to disclose
them to other RCCs for our
RCC purposes," he said. "If
there's any violation of that,
we get fired."

Concerns with Google Apps
Aleecia McDonald, direc
tor of privacy at the Center for
Internet and Society at Stan
ford Law School, expressed
general satisfaction with Stan
ford's Internet privacy poli
cies, noting that some univer
sities monitor traffic to cer
tain sites or limit bandwidth
to limit incidents of online
piracy.

"Of the academic policies
I'm familiar with, [Stanford's
policy] strikes a reasonable
balance between the Univer
sity and the people using uni
versity facilities," McDonald
said. "There are a number of
universities more restrictive
than Stanford."

However, McDonald did
express reservations about
Stanford's use of Google
Apps, which IT Services be
gan using in January 2012.
Currently, both Stanford

and Google's privacy policies
cover the Gmail, Google Cal
endar and Google Docs appli
cations. All other Google ap
plications are covered only by
Google's privacy policy and
terms of use.

In addition to basic per
sonal information that users
share when they create
Google accounts, Google also
collects search queries and
device information like IP ad
dresses, and records location
information gathered from
GPS signals, cell towers and
sensor data from will access
points.

Google has come under
fire recently for working
around privacy settings in
Apple's Safari browser to
track browser users for ad
vertising puiposes, and also
drew criticism after utilizing
Gmail user data in behavioral
advertising.

McDonald said that she is
not comfortable with storing
her calendar or email infor
mation on Google's servers
because she makes "strong
promises" to subjects in her
research to keep their infor
mation confidential.

"If I have human subjects'
data and it's personally iden
tifiable in some way, I've
made pledges that that data

will not get reused for other
purposes," she said. "I can't
know that I can uphold those
promises forever if Google
has the data. They can change
their policies at any time."
According to McDonald,
many universities use services
like Google for email to avoid
the expense of hosting their
own servers and securing their
networks against hackers.
"Rather than hiring more
staff to deal with security, it's
less money for universities to
just hand off their infrastruc
ture to Google and let Google
take care of it," she said.
However, McDonald ac
knowledged the many com
peting factors that contribute
to the development of the
University's privacy policy,
and said that a perfect priva
cy policy would be extremely
difficult to achieve.
"Is it ideal for the financial
aspects of the University? Is
it ideal for protecting the pri
vacy of the individuals? Is it
ideal for intellectual property
protection?" she said. "These
are all valid things to want, but
it might be impossible to get
all three perfectly at the same
time."

those for RCC purposes, and
we're allowed to disclose
them to other RCCs for our
RCC purposes," he said. "If
there's any violation of that,
we get fired."

Concerns with Google Apps
Aleecia McDonald, direc
tor of privacy at the Center for
Internet and Society at Stan
ford Law School, expressed
general satisfaction with Stan
ford's Internet privacy poli
cies, noting that some univer
sities monitor traffic to cer
tain sites or limit bandwidth
to limit incidents of online
piracy.

"Of the academic policies
I'm familiar with, [Stanford's
policy] strikes a reasonable
balance between the Univer
sity and the people using uni
versity facilities," McDonald
said. "There are a number of
universities more restrictive
than Stanford."

However, McDonald did
express reservations about
Stanford's use of Google
Apps, which IT Services be
gan using in January 2012.
Currently, both Stanford

and Google's privacy policies
cover the Gmail, Google Cal
endar and Google Docs appli
cations. All other Google ap
plications are covered only by
Google's privacy policy and
terms of use.

In addition to basic per
sonal information that users
share when they create
Google accounts, Google also
collects search queries and
device information like IP ad
dresses, and records location
information gathered from
GPS signals, cell towers and
sensor data from will access
points.

Google has come under
fire recently for working
around privacy settings in
Apple's Safari browser to
track browser users for ad
vertising puiposes, and also
drew criticism after utilizing
Gmail user data in behavioral
advertising.

McDonald said that she is
not comfortable with storing
her calendar or email infor
mation on Google's servers
because she makes "strong
promises" to subjects in her
research to keep their infor
mation confidential.

"If I have human subjects'
data and it's personally iden
tifiable in some way, I've
made pledges that that data

will not get reused for other
purposes," she said. "I can't
know that I can uphold those
promises forever if Google
has the data. They can change
their policies at any time."
According to McDonald,
many universities use services
like Google for email to avoid
the expense of hosting their
own servers and securing their
networks against hackers.
"Rather than hiring more
staff to deal with security, it's
less money for universities to
just hand off their infrastruc
ture to Google and let Google
take care of it," she said.
However, McDonald ac
knowledged the many com
peting factors that contribute
to the development of the
University's privacy policy,
and said that a perfect priva
cy policy would be extremely
difficult to achieve.
"Is it ideal for the financial
aspects of the University? Is
it ideal for protecting the pri
vacy of the individuals? Is it
ideal for intellectual property
protection?" she said. "These
are all valid things to want, but
it might be impossible to get
all three perfectly at the same
time."

Even as the controversy surrounding
Harvard's secret searches of staff mem
bers' email accounts deepens, an examina
tion of Stanford's privacy policies suggests
that such a controversy may be precluded
by severe limitations on the information
and account access afforded to University
administrators.

Stanford's Internet Privacy Policy
By registering on Stanford's network,
computer users allow Academic Computing
Services (ACS) to collect basic information
about their devices, including make and
model, IP addresses, operating systems
and hardware addresses.

ACS also collects personal information
from network users, including phone num
bers, email addresses and residential in
formation. According to ACS, this data is
used primarily to provide technical sup
port or generate statistics about device
trends, which inform policy and user support
decisions.

Access to information collected by ACS
is restricted to employees who are involved
with user support, and no personally identi
fiable information is shared outside the
University unless it is requested by court
order, subpoena or emergency circum
stances.

Brad Hayward, senior director for
strategic communications, wrote in a state
ment to The Daily that Stanford "does not
monitor individual student or employee
email or Internet usage in any ongoing
way."

According to Hayward, only Tina Dar
mohray, chief information security officer,
can authorize a review of user information.
Hayward said that these reviews are done
in consultation with the Office of General
Counsel to "fully ensure the appropriate
practices are followed."
Hayward emphasized that the Universi
ty "only accesses information in response
to a situation that truly demands it," adding
that these situations arise very infrequent-
ly. According to Hayward,
whether or not an individual
is notified before their infor
mation is accessed depends
largely on the situation.

"If a member of the Uni
versity community went
missing for an extended peri
od and there was a serious
safety concern for that indi
vidual, or if an investigation
was underway with respect to
employee fraud or misuse of
funds, it obviously would not
be feasible to provide notice
to the individual involved,"
Hayward said.
However, Hayward said
that if a student or faculty
member's information were
the subject of a subpoena,
the University would offer
notice before accessing the
information.

Ryan Globus'l4, a Resi
dential Computer Consultant
(RCC) in Florence Moore
West, said that RCCs also
have limited access to student
information.

According to Globus,
RCCs can view the types of
electronic devices registered

to each network user, as well
as the IP addresses, phone
numbers, SUNet IDs and
room numbers of the users.

"We're only allowed to use
those for RCC purposes, and
we're allowed to disclose
them to other RCCs for our
RCC purposes," he said. "If
there's any violation of that,
we get fired."
