Even as the controversy surrounding
Harvard's secret searches of staff mem

Stanford's Internet Privacy Policy
By registering on Stanford's network,
computer users allow Academic Computing
Services (ACS) to collect basic information

University unless it is requested by court
order, subpoena or emergency circum
