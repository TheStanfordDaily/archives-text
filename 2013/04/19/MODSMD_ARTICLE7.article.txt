## Hennessy delivers annual recap 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
President John Hennessy delivered his
annual address to the Academic Council on
Thursday afternoon in Cemex Auditorium,
in a meeting that also offered another spe
cial report from Faculty Senate Chair Ray
mond Levitt M.S. '73 Ph.D. '75.
The meeting began with Levitt's re
port, which acknowledged the lack of an
Academic Council Meeting last year by re
capping the Faculty Senate's work over the
past two years.

Levitt said that last year's Senate "fun
damentally re-imagined the Stanford un
dergraduate educational experience"
through the implementation of a report
produced by the Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES) Committee.
Notable changes referenced by Levitt
included the transition from the three
quarter Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) program to a one-quarter Think
ing Matters course and the replacement of
general education requirements (GERs)
