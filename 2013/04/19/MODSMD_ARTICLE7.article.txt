## Hennessy delivers annual recap 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
President John Hennessy delivered his
annual address to the Academic Council on
Thursday afternoon in Cemex Auditorium,
in a meeting that also offered another spe
cial report from Faculty Senate Chair Ray
mond Levitt M.S. '73 Ph.D. '75.
The meeting began with Levitt's re
port, which acknowledged the lack of an
Academic Council Meeting last year by re
capping the Faculty Senate's work over the
past two years.

Levitt said that last year's Senate "fun
damentally re-imagined the Stanford un
dergraduate educational experience"
through the implementation of a report
produced by the Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES) Committee.
Notable changes referenced by Levitt
included the transition from the three
quarter Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) program to a one-quarter Think
ing Matters course and the replacement of
general education requirements (GERs)
with new Ways of Thinking/Ways of
Doing requirements.
Levitt said that this year's Sen
ate has continued to act upon the
recommendations made by the
SUES committee while also dis
cussing class scheduling issues and
the future of online education,
among other issues.
According to Levitt, the Senate
will hear a panel discussion on the
future of the doctoral degree, re
ports from student representatives
and a presentation of the Provost's
annual budget report in the body's
last four meetings of this year.

The Senate will also debate the
Alternative Review Process (ARP),
a proposed revision of the Universi
ty's approach to sexual assault cas
es.

Hennessy spoke next, present
ing a history of the past 30 years at
Stanford. He focused his comments
on faculty, students and financial
aid, finances, facilities and the
Medical Center; he framed his ap
preciation of the latter's growth as
necessary to charting a successful
path for the University's future.

"Where are we as an institution
trying to go?" Hennessy asked.
"Any good decision on that comes
from looking back and seeing
where we've come from."

Faculty
Hennessy first discussed
growth in the faculty population,
growth in the tenure line, major
awards won by faculty members,
national program rankings and the
faculty age distribution.
"Even though we had many
strong programs, we now have pro
grams that are ranked even high
er," Hennessy said, noting dramat
ic improvements in the humanities
programs over the past three
decades.

Though Hennessy discussed
several significant advancements,
including an increase in faculty
quality, he acknowledged that fac
ulty diversity has continued to be
an area of weakness.

"This has been a long, slow haul
for the University," Hennessy said.
"This is going to something that we
continue to focus on, and we spend
time every year in the Senate look
ing at it, but it continues to be a
long slug."
Hennessy said that the current

trend in the age distribution of fac
ulty is also troubling, as the median
age of faculty members has in
creased by seven years from 1981
to 2012, with a particularly notable
growth in the proportion of faculty
members in the 60-69-year-old age
range.

"That's probably okay, but if
this trend were to continue, what
we would really worry about is our
ability to bring in younger faculty,
as we couldn't replace older facul
ty," he said.
Students
Hennessy then examined issues
relating to students, including en
rollment, admissions, diversity, fi
nancial aid and net tuition for both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents over the past 30 years.
According to Hennessy, net tu
ition (as calculated by subtracting
financial aid from total costs of at
tending Stanford) was $16,586 in
2010-2011, compared to $16,090 in
1991-1992 on an inflation-adjusted
basis.

"We've actually made the insti
tution more affordable over time,
and that no doubt bears directly on
what's happened with our student
body in terms of more socio-eco
nomic diversity in it, and of course
lots of applications," Hennessy
said.

Hennessy noted that while the
undergraduate population is ex
tremely diverse, graduate pro
grams still aim to attract more
African-American and Hispanic
students.

"This bears directly on the issue
of faculty diversity, which is why we
are putting so much emphasis on
the pipeline and getting diversity in
graduate programs," Hennessy
said. "This is a long-term problem."
According to Hennessy, future
initiatives include a potential rebal
ancing of resources among majors,
building a significant endowment
for undergraduate financial aid and
potentially limiting the size of grad
uate programs if federal resources
are reduced for graduate financial
aid.
Hennessy also mentioned the
possible need to increase the num
ber of undergraduates in the future
to match the "considerably larger"
graduate population.
Finances
Hennessy then addressed the
University's financial standing
from the 1980s to the present, fo
cusing on the endowment value,
University revenues and revenue

composition and development re
sults.
"We've been in a very blessed
period," Hennessy said. "The en
dowment has grown at 6.7 percent
above inflation, so that's a stunning
growth number."
While revenues from the en
dowment and medical service have
grown, the federal research budget
has fallen, which Hennessy predict
ed will prove a challenge in the fu
ture.
Though Hennessy acknowl
edged that continued strong en
dowment growth isn't a certainty,
he expressed confidence that the
University is in "a good reserve po
sition," a particularly notable asset
given the potential for further cuts
in federal funding.
"We are well-protected for a
federal downturn, particularly if
that federal downturn is not sus
tained over a long period of time,"
he said.
Facilities
According to Hennessy, Stan
ford's facilities have grown exten
sively during the past 30 years,
with a recent wave of renovations
to replace older buildings.
"We have largely finished a re
newal of the buildings on campus
that were in the most desperate
shape, those built in the 'sos and
'6os in the post-World War II
boom in the University," Hen
nessy said.
Hennessy also mentioned that
several new building projects are in
the planning stages or are current
ly being constructed, including the
Anderson Building, the McMurtry
Art and Art History Building and
the Bass Biology Building.
According to Hennessy, the Uni
versity recently found a donor to
fund a renovation of the Old Chem
istry Building, which will become
an undergraduate science center
with both classrooms and laborato
ry space. That renovation would
fulfill a "long-standing goal" for
both Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2.
"That building is an architectur
al treasure, and we are delighted

we can restore it," Hennessy said.
Longer-term construction proj
ects include the replacement of
Meyer Library and the possible
construction of new buildings for
the Graduate School of Education,
the School of Earth Sciences and
the departments of neuroscience
and chemical biology, according to
Hennessy.
Medical Center
Following a summary of the
University's finances, Hennessy
discussed hospital finances and
Medical Center revenues, focusing
on potential challenges to the cen
ter's continued growth.
The Medical Center currently
generates 62 percent of Universi
ty's combined revenue. Medical
Center revenues have grown at 6
percent annually over the past 30
years, a substantially higher rate
than the two percent growth rate of
revenues on campus.
"We've got great growth in rev
enues as well as total net assets,"
Hennessy said. "The issue that we
face in the hospital and the Medical
Center will be healthcare reform
and what that will do to long-term
revenues for hospitals."
Hennessy also noted that the
current expansion of the Medical
Center will exhaust most of the
growth capacity on the west side of
campus, making it difficult to locate
future construction initiatives in
the same area.
"It will be hard to build much
more on that side of campus," he
said. "We have to think about how
we balance that. Longer term,
we're going to have to think about
further expansions of the Medical
Center, particularly clinical servic
es, being off campus somewhere."
Conclusion
Hennessy concluded with sever
al remarks on Stanford's expansion
and development over the past
three decades and his vision for the
University in the future.
"Stanford's growth and its pre
eminence have really been driven
by an entrepreneurial culture,"
Hennessy said. "By an entrepre

neurial culture, I don't mean start
ups and Silicon Valley, I mean facul
ty who are willing to head new di
rections, establish new fields and
lead in development of their fields."
Looking back at the past 30
years, Hennessy noted that Stan
ford's capacity for growth has been
crucial in allowing faculty to contin
ue pursuing their research inter
ests and beginning new initiatives.
"We haven't very often had to
make the decision of saying, 'ln or
der to do something new, we have
to close something down,"' Hen
nessy said, adding that the Univer
sity has been able to continuing ex
panding both because of its large
campus and its ability to generate
revenue through research funding
and development.
Hennessy predicted several
changes moving forward, including
a more limited capacity for growth
on campus and continued uncer
tainties surrounding federal expen
ditures leading to slower growths
in research funding.
However, Hennessy expressed
optimism that Stanford will acquire
the resources needed to continue to
thrive.

"The key for Stanford going for
ward will be to develop a vision and
set of priorities for the institution
that we can talk about to our
friends, our donors and our alumni
that will compel them to help sup
port that mission through their
philanthropic dollars," Hennessy
said. "If we do that well, I'm confi
dent that we will continue to flour
ish as one of the great universities
in the world."

dergraduate educational experience"
through the implementation of a report
produced by the Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES) Committee.
Notable changes referenced by Levitt
included the transition from the three
quarter Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) program to a one-quarter Think
ing Matters course and the replacement of
general education requirements (GERs)
with new Ways of Thinking/Ways of
Doing requirements.
Levitt said that this year's Sen
ate has continued to act upon the
recommendations made by the
SUES committee while also dis
cussing class scheduling issues and
the future of online education,
among other issues.
According to Levitt, the Senate
will hear a panel discussion on the
future of the doctoral degree, re
ports from student representatives
and a presentation of the Provost's
annual budget report in the body's
last four meetings of this year.

The Senate will also debate the
Alternative Review Process (ARP),
a proposed revision of the Universi
ty's approach to sexual assault cas
es.

Hennessy spoke next, present
ing a history of the past 30 years at
Stanford. He focused his comments
on faculty, students and financial
aid, finances, facilities and the
Medical Center; he framed his ap
preciation of the latter's growth as
necessary to charting a successful
path for the University's future.

"Where are we as an institution
trying to go?" Hennessy asked.
"Any good decision on that comes
from looking back and seeing
where we've come from."

Faculty
Hennessy first discussed
growth in the faculty population,
growth in the tenure line, major
awards won by faculty members,
national program rankings and the
faculty age distribution.
"Even though we had many
strong programs, we now have pro
grams that are ranked even high
er," Hennessy said, noting dramat
ic improvements in the humanities
programs over the past three
decades.

Though Hennessy discussed
several significant advancements,
including an increase in faculty
quality, he acknowledged that fac
ulty diversity has continued to be
an area of weakness.

"This has been a long, slow haul
for the University," Hennessy said.
"This is going to something that we
continue to focus on, and we spend
time every year in the Senate look
ing at it, but it continues to be a
long slug."
Hennessy said that the current

trend in the age distribution of fac
ulty is also troubling, as the median
age of faculty members has in
creased by seven years from 1981
to 2012, with a particularly notable
growth in the proportion of faculty
members in the 60-69-year-old age
range.

"That's probably okay, but if
this trend were to continue, what
we would really worry about is our
ability to bring in younger faculty,
as we couldn't replace older facul
ty," he said.
Students
Hennessy then examined issues
relating to students, including en
rollment, admissions, diversity, fi
nancial aid and net tuition for both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents over the past 30 years.
According to Hennessy, net tu
ition (as calculated by subtracting
financial aid from total costs of at
tending Stanford) was $16,586 in
2010-2011, compared to $16,090 in
1991-1992 on an inflation-adjusted
basis.

"We've actually made the insti
tution more affordable over time,
and that no doubt bears directly on
what's happened with our student
body in terms of more socio-eco
nomic diversity in it, and of course
lots of applications," Hennessy
said.

Hennessy noted that while the
undergraduate population is ex
tremely diverse, graduate pro
grams still aim to attract more
African-American and Hispanic
students.

"This bears directly on the issue
of faculty diversity, which is why we
are putting so much emphasis on
the pipeline and getting diversity in
graduate programs," Hennessy
said. "This is a long-term problem."
According to Hennessy, future
initiatives include a potential rebal
ancing of resources among majors,
building a significant endowment
for undergraduate financial aid and
potentially limiting the size of grad
uate programs if federal resources
are reduced for graduate financial
aid.
Hennessy also mentioned the
possible need to increase the num
ber of undergraduates in the future
to match the "considerably larger"
graduate population.
Finances
Hennessy then addressed the
University's financial standing
from the 1980s to the present, fo
cusing on the endowment value,
University revenues and revenue

composition and development re
sults.
"We've been in a very blessed
period," Hennessy said. "The en
dowment has grown at 6.7 percent
above inflation, so that's a stunning
growth number."
While revenues from the en
dowment and medical service have
grown, the federal research budget
has fallen, which Hennessy predict
ed will prove a challenge in the fu
ture.
Though Hennessy acknowl
edged that continued strong en
dowment growth isn't a certainty,
he expressed confidence that the
University is in "a good reserve po
sition," a particularly notable asset
given the potential for further cuts
in federal funding.
"We are well-protected for a
federal downturn, particularly if
that federal downturn is not sus
tained over a long period of time,"
he said.
Facilities
According to Hennessy, Stan
ford's facilities have grown exten
sively during the past 30 years,
with a recent wave of renovations
to replace older buildings.
"We have largely finished a re
newal of the buildings on campus
that were in the most desperate
shape, those built in the 'sos and
'6os in the post-World War II
boom in the University," Hen
nessy said.
Hennessy also mentioned that
several new building projects are in
the planning stages or are current
ly being constructed, including the
Anderson Building, the McMurtry
Art and Art History Building and
the Bass Biology Building.
According to Hennessy, the Uni
versity recently found a donor to
fund a renovation of the Old Chem
istry Building, which will become
an undergraduate science center
with both classrooms and laborato
ry space. That renovation would
fulfill a "long-standing goal" for
both Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2.
"That building is an architectur
al treasure, and we are delighted

we can restore it," Hennessy said.
Longer-term construction proj
ects include the replacement of
Meyer Library and the possible
construction of new buildings for
the Graduate School of Education,
the School of Earth Sciences and
the departments of neuroscience
and chemical biology, according to
Hennessy.
Medical Center
Following a summary of the
University's finances, Hennessy
discussed hospital finances and
Medical Center revenues, focusing
on potential challenges to the cen
ter's continued growth.
The Medical Center currently
generates 62 percent of Universi
ty's combined revenue. Medical
Center revenues have grown at 6
percent annually over the past 30
years, a substantially higher rate
than the two percent growth rate of
revenues on campus.
"We've got great growth in rev
enues as well as total net assets,"
Hennessy said. "The issue that we
face in the hospital and the Medical
Center will be healthcare reform
and what that will do to long-term
revenues for hospitals."
Hennessy also noted that the
current expansion of the Medical
Center will exhaust most of the
growth capacity on the west side of
campus, making it difficult to locate
future construction initiatives in
the same area.
"It will be hard to build much
more on that side of campus," he
said. "We have to think about how
we balance that. Longer term,
we're going to have to think about
further expansions of the Medical
Center, particularly clinical servic
es, being off campus somewhere."
Conclusion
Hennessy concluded with sever
al remarks on Stanford's expansion
and development over the past
three decades and his vision for the
University in the future.
"Stanford's growth and its pre
eminence have really been driven
by an entrepreneurial culture,"
Hennessy said. "By an entrepre

neurial culture, I don't mean start
ups and Silicon Valley, I mean facul
ty who are willing to head new di
rections, establish new fields and
lead in development of their fields."
Looking back at the past 30
years, Hennessy noted that Stan
ford's capacity for growth has been
crucial in allowing faculty to contin
ue pursuing their research inter
ests and beginning new initiatives.
"We haven't very often had to
make the decision of saying, 'ln or
der to do something new, we have
to close something down,"' Hen
nessy said, adding that the Univer
sity has been able to continuing ex
panding both because of its large
campus and its ability to generate
revenue through research funding
and development.
Hennessy predicted several
changes moving forward, including
a more limited capacity for growth
on campus and continued uncer
tainties surrounding federal expen
ditures leading to slower growths
in research funding.
However, Hennessy expressed
optimism that Stanford will acquire
the resources needed to continue to
thrive.

"The key for Stanford going for
ward will be to develop a vision and
set of priorities for the institution
that we can talk about to our
friends, our donors and our alumni
that will compel them to help sup
port that mission through their
philanthropic dollars," Hennessy
said. "If we do that well, I'm confi
dent that we will continue to flour
ish as one of the great universities
in the world."

cussing class scheduling issues and
the future of online education,
among other issues.
According to Levitt, the Senate
will hear a panel discussion on the
future of the doctoral degree, re
ports from student representatives
and a presentation of the Provost's
annual budget report in the body's
last four meetings of this year.

The Senate will also debate the
Alternative Review Process (ARP),
a proposed revision of the Universi
ty's approach to sexual assault cas
es.

Hennessy spoke next, present
ing a history of the past 30 years at
Stanford. He focused his comments
on faculty, students and financial
aid, finances, facilities and the
Medical Center; he framed his ap
preciation of the latter's growth as
necessary to charting a successful
path for the University's future.

"Where are we as an institution
trying to go?" Hennessy asked.
"Any good decision on that comes
from looking back and seeing
where we've come from."

Faculty
Hennessy first discussed
growth in the faculty population,
growth in the tenure line, major
awards won by faculty members,
national program rankings and the
faculty age distribution.
"Even though we had many
strong programs, we now have pro
grams that are ranked even high
er," Hennessy said, noting dramat
ic improvements in the humanities
programs over the past three
decades.

Though Hennessy discussed
several significant advancements,
including an increase in faculty
quality, he acknowledged that fac
ulty diversity has continued to be
an area of weakness.

"This has been a long, slow haul
for the University," Hennessy said.
"This is going to something that we
continue to focus on, and we spend
time every year in the Senate look
ing at it, but it continues to be a
long slug."
Hennessy said that the current

trend in the age distribution of fac
ulty is also troubling, as the median
age of faculty members has in
creased by seven years from 1981
to 2012, with a particularly notable
growth in the proportion of faculty
members in the 60-69-year-old age
range.

"That's probably okay, but if
this trend were to continue, what
we would really worry about is our
ability to bring in younger faculty,
as we couldn't replace older facul
ty," he said.
Students
Hennessy then examined issues
relating to students, including en
rollment, admissions, diversity, fi
nancial aid and net tuition for both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents over the past 30 years.
According to Hennessy, net tu
ition (as calculated by subtracting
financial aid from total costs of at
tending Stanford) was $16,586 in
2010-2011, compared to $16,090 in
1991-1992 on an inflation-adjusted
basis.

"We've actually made the insti
tution more affordable over time,
and that no doubt bears directly on
what's happened with our student
body in terms of more socio-eco
nomic diversity in it, and of course
lots of applications," Hennessy
said.

Hennessy noted that while the
undergraduate population is ex
tremely diverse, graduate pro
grams still aim to attract more
African-American and Hispanic
students.

"This bears directly on the issue
of faculty diversity, which is why we
are putting so much emphasis on
the pipeline and getting diversity in
graduate programs," Hennessy
said. "This is a long-term problem."
According to Hennessy, future
initiatives include a potential rebal
ancing of resources among majors,
building a significant endowment
for undergraduate financial aid and
potentially limiting the size of grad
uate programs if federal resources
are reduced for graduate financial
aid.
Hennessy also mentioned the
possible need to increase the num
ber of undergraduates in the future
to match the "considerably larger"
graduate population.
Finances
Hennessy then addressed the
University's financial standing
from the 1980s to the present, fo
cusing on the endowment value,
University revenues and revenue

composition and development re
sults.
"We've been in a very blessed
period," Hennessy said. "The en
dowment has grown at 6.7 percent
above inflation, so that's a stunning
growth number."
While revenues from the en
dowment and medical service have
grown, the federal research budget
has fallen, which Hennessy predict
ed will prove a challenge in the fu
ture.
Though Hennessy acknowl
edged that continued strong en
dowment growth isn't a certainty,
he expressed confidence that the
University is in "a good reserve po
sition," a particularly notable asset
given the potential for further cuts
in federal funding.
"We are well-protected for a
federal downturn, particularly if
that federal downturn is not sus
tained over a long period of time,"
he said.
Facilities
According to Hennessy, Stan
ford's facilities have grown exten
sively during the past 30 years,
with a recent wave of renovations
to replace older buildings.
"We have largely finished a re
newal of the buildings on campus
that were in the most desperate
shape, those built in the 'sos and
'6os in the post-World War II
boom in the University," Hen
nessy said.
Hennessy also mentioned that
several new building projects are in
the planning stages or are current
ly being constructed, including the
Anderson Building, the McMurtry
Art and Art History Building and
the Bass Biology Building.
According to Hennessy, the Uni
versity recently found a donor to
fund a renovation of the Old Chem
istry Building, which will become
an undergraduate science center
with both classrooms and laborato
ry space. That renovation would
fulfill a "long-standing goal" for
both Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2.
"That building is an architectur
al treasure, and we are delighted

we can restore it," Hennessy said.
Longer-term construction proj
ects include the replacement of
Meyer Library and the possible
construction of new buildings for
the Graduate School of Education,
the School of Earth Sciences and
the departments of neuroscience
and chemical biology, according to
Hennessy.
Medical Center
Following a summary of the
University's finances, Hennessy
discussed hospital finances and
Medical Center revenues, focusing
on potential challenges to the cen
ter's continued growth.
The Medical Center currently
generates 62 percent of Universi
ty's combined revenue. Medical
Center revenues have grown at 6
percent annually over the past 30
years, a substantially higher rate
than the two percent growth rate of
revenues on campus.
"We've got great growth in rev
enues as well as total net assets,"
Hennessy said. "The issue that we
face in the hospital and the Medical
Center will be healthcare reform
and what that will do to long-term
revenues for hospitals."
Hennessy also noted that the
current expansion of the Medical
Center will exhaust most of the
growth capacity on the west side of
campus, making it difficult to locate
future construction initiatives in
the same area.
"It will be hard to build much
more on that side of campus," he
said. "We have to think about how
we balance that. Longer term,
we're going to have to think about
further expansions of the Medical
Center, particularly clinical servic
es, being off campus somewhere."
Conclusion
Hennessy concluded with sever
al remarks on Stanford's expansion
and development over the past
three decades and his vision for the
University in the future.
"Stanford's growth and its pre
eminence have really been driven
by an entrepreneurial culture,"
Hennessy said. "By an entrepre

neurial culture, I don't mean start
ups and Silicon Valley, I mean facul
ty who are willing to head new di
rections, establish new fields and
lead in development of their fields."
Looking back at the past 30
years, Hennessy noted that Stan
ford's capacity for growth has been
crucial in allowing faculty to contin
ue pursuing their research inter
ests and beginning new initiatives.
"We haven't very often had to
make the decision of saying, 'ln or
der to do something new, we have
to close something down,"' Hen
nessy said, adding that the Univer
sity has been able to continuing ex
panding both because of its large
campus and its ability to generate
revenue through research funding
and development.
Hennessy predicted several
changes moving forward, including
a more limited capacity for growth
on campus and continued uncer
tainties surrounding federal expen
ditures leading to slower growths
in research funding.
However, Hennessy expressed
optimism that Stanford will acquire
the resources needed to continue to
thrive.

"The key for Stanford going for
ward will be to develop a vision and
set of priorities for the institution
that we can talk about to our
friends, our donors and our alumni
that will compel them to help sup
port that mission through their
philanthropic dollars," Hennessy
said. "If we do that well, I'm confi
dent that we will continue to flour
ish as one of the great universities
in the world."
