# SLATED FOR SUCCESS
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
Successful players await
their opportunity to break
through and seize their
chance when it arises. Lou
Gehrig's legendary streak
of appearances started when he was
penciled in to the starting lineup
one day in the stead of slumping
first baseman Wally Pipp. Gehrig
made the most of his opportunity,
and —2,130 consecutive games later
found himself the owner of one of
baseball's most legendary records.
It always starts somewhere.
Just ask Austin Slater.
After entering Stanford as one
of the premier baseball prospects in
the country, sitting on the bench his
freshman year was an adjustment
for current sophomore Slater.
"My role was to be a backup, you
know, come in whenever I needed to
be called in, get at bats whenever
we were up or down by a lot," Slater
reminisced as he chuckled. "It was
tough, sitting on the bench. That
was really the first time I'd ever
done that in my life."
But Slater said his time on the
bench was motivation for him to
work harder over the summer and

during the fall to prove to the coach
es that he deserved a spot on the
field.

Earlier this season, Slater final
ly got his shot when one of Stan
ford's premier power hitters, right
fielder Austin Wilson, went down
with an injury that left a hole in the
middle of the lineup.
Slater was slotted into light field
in the injured slugger's place and he
took advantage of the opportunity.
After going 0-3 in his first start at
Rice, he notched two hits in each of
four games in a row and played a
role in helping the Cardinal team
achieve its early-season nine-game
winning streak. The sophomore
currently leads the team with eight
doubles, has a .308 batting average
third among the Cardinal's
everyday starters and is tied for
the team lead with 18 RBI.
However, it wasn't always so
clear to Slater that his story would
take that happy turn.
As a senior at The Bolles School
in Jacksonville, Fla., in 2011, Austin
Slater was considered the best
prospect in the state by Prospect
Wire. He was prepared to anchor
the left side of the infield and lead
Bolles to its third consecutive state

championship as the team's
captain. Even though he had
already committed to Stanford,
several professional baseball
franchises were keeping an eye
on him, some even inviting him
to workouts. All signs pointed
to future success.

All that, however, changed
in the blink of an eye after he
landed awkwardly during a
friendly game of Frisbee. X
rays showed that his ankle
was broken and would require
surgery. The prognosis was
grim: the star infielder would
likely be out for the duration
of the season, with a possibili
ty of returning for the play
offs.

"You never see an injury
like that happening," said
Slater. "I was just messing
around with my friends, not
even on the baseball field. It's
always shocking when you in
jure yourself doing something
kind of mundane, and it kind
of changes your mentality

about how you go about ap
proaching regular activities."
Not only did the injury rob
him of what could have been a
spectacular senior season, but
it also affected Slater's men
tality moving forward as he
came to Stanford, making
Slater what he described as "a
little trigger-shy."
"I felt like my summer and
the fall coming back after [the
injury], I was kind of still feel
ing the effects mentally, not
really feeling like I was at 100-
percent, and not really sure
what my body could do,"
Slater recalled. "I had a men
tal block, I guess, coming off
that injury."
Despite sitting out his sen
ior season, Slater was drafted
by the Los Angeles Dodgers
in the 44th round of the 2011
MLB draft. However, he hon
ored his commitment to Stan
ford and passed up the chance
to sign in order to get an edu
cation on The Farm.
His baseball career at
Stanford, however, started out
slowly. There was simply no
space for the freshman Slater
in the crowded 2012 Stanford
lineup big names like

Stephen Piscotty and Kenny
Diekroeger manned the left
side of the infield. The former
high school star found himself
in an unfamiliar situation
relegated to a bench role, he
only appeared in seven games
all season.

The outlook has changed
this season, as a solid showing
last summer gave Slater the
boost he needed to succeed for
the Cardinal this spring.

"A lot of it's the confidence
thing. Coming off that injury,
I guess I wasn't really com
fortable at the plate," Slater
said. "I played summer ball in
Rhode Island and got a lot of
at-bats and came into the fall
ready to hit."
Filling Wilson's spot in the
lineup did involve a signifi
cant position change, as
Slater shifted to right field
from his natural position at
shortstop. Slater said al
though he felt shaky at first,
he is feeling "pretty good
about it right now." He added
that playing a little bit of
right field in high school
helped him make the adjust
ment.

"It was nice, you know, it's

definitely a confidence-boost
er once you start getting on a
roll, feeling like you belong in
the lineup," Slater said.
"That's huge for confidence
and confidence is a big part of
baseball, especially at the
plate, and I've carried that
through the rest of the year
so far."

With a healthy Austin
Wilson returning to man his
position in right field, howev
er, Slater is back to fighting
for playing time at spots
around the field. Even
though he was kept out of the
lineup the past two games,
Slater said he is focused on
continuing to work hard.

When asked about the
possibility of being drafted a
second time, Slater simply
stated, "If I'm drafted again
or someone thinks I'm able to
play baseball at the next lev
el, I'd love to play. I'm just
playing it by ear at this point
and hopefully I'll get a shot to
play at the next level. Hope
fully, I'll be able to follow my
dreams."

said. "I played summer ball in
Rhode Island and got a lot of
at-bats and came into the fall
ready to hit."
Filling Wilson's spot in the
lineup did involve a signifi
cant position change, as
Slater shifted to right field
from his natural position at
shortstop. Slater said al
though he felt shaky at first,
he is feeling "pretty good
about it right now." He added
that playing a little bit of
right field in high school
helped him make the adjust
ment.

"It was nice, you know, it's

definitely a confidence-boost
er once you start getting on a
roll, feeling like you belong in
the lineup," Slater said.
"That's huge for confidence
and confidence is a big part of
baseball, especially at the
plate, and I've carried that
through the rest of the year
so far."

With a healthy Austin
Wilson returning to man his
position in right field, howev
er, Slater is back to fighting
for playing time at spots
around the field. Even
though he was kept out of the
lineup the past two games,
Slater said he is focused on
continuing to work hard.

When asked about the
possibility of being drafted a
second time, Slater simply
stated, "If I'm drafted again
or someone thinks I'm able to
play baseball at the next lev
el, I'd love to play. I'm just
playing it by ear at this point
and hopefully I'll get a shot to
play at the next level. Hope
fully, I'll be able to follow my
dreams."

Successful players await

Gehrig's legendary streak
of appearances started when he was
penciled in to the starting lineup

It always starts somewhere.
Just ask Austin Slater.
After entering Stanford as one
of the premier baseball prospects in
the country, sitting on the bench his
freshman year was an adjustment
for current sophomore Slater.
"My role was to be a backup, you
know, come in whenever I needed to
be called in, get at bats whenever
we were up or down by a lot," Slater
reminisced as he chuckled. "It was
tough, sitting on the bench. That
was really the first time I'd ever
done that in my life."
But Slater said his time on the
bench was motivation for him to
work harder over the summer and

during the fall to prove to the coach
es that he deserved a spot on the
field.

Earlier this season, Slater final
ly got his shot when one of Stan
ford's premier power hitters, right
fielder Austin Wilson, went down
with an injury that left a hole in the
middle of the lineup.
Slater was slotted into light field
in the injured slugger's place and he
took advantage of the opportunity.
After going 0-3 in his first start at
Rice, he notched two hits in each of
four games in a row and played a
role in helping the Cardinal team
achieve its early-season nine-game
winning streak. The sophomore
currently leads the team with eight
doubles, has a .308 batting average
third among the Cardinal's
everyday starters and is tied for
the team lead with 18 RBI.
However, it wasn't always so
clear to Slater that his story would
take that happy turn.
As a senior at The Bolles School
in Jacksonville, Fla., in 2011, Austin
Slater was considered the best
prospect in the state by Prospect
Wire. He was prepared to anchor
the left side of the infield and lead
Bolles to its third consecutive state

championship as the team's
captain. Even though he had
already committed to Stanford,
several professional baseball
franchises were keeping an eye
on him, some even inviting him
to workouts. All signs pointed
to future success.

All that, however, changed
in the blink of an eye after he
landed awkwardly during a
friendly game of Frisbee. X
rays showed that his ankle
was broken and would require
surgery. The prognosis was
grim: the star infielder would
likely be out for the duration
of the season, with a possibili
ty of returning for the play
offs.

"You never see an injury
like that happening," said
Slater. "I was just messing
around with my friends, not
even on the baseball field. It's
always shocking when you in
jure yourself doing something
kind of mundane, and it kind
of changes your mentality

about how you go about ap
proaching regular activities."
Not only did the injury rob
him of what could have been a
spectacular senior season, but
it also affected Slater's men
tality moving forward as he
came to Stanford, making
Slater what he described as "a
little trigger-shy."
"I felt like my summer and
the fall coming back after [the
injury], I was kind of still feel
ing the effects mentally, not
really feeling like I was at 100-
percent, and not really sure
what my body could do,"
Slater recalled. "I had a men
tal block, I guess, coming off
that injury."
Despite sitting out his sen
ior season, Slater was drafted
by the Los Angeles Dodgers
in the 44th round of the 2011
MLB draft. However, he hon
ored his commitment to Stan
ford and passed up the chance
to sign in order to get an edu
cation on The Farm.
His baseball career at
Stanford, however, started out
slowly. There was simply no
space for the freshman Slater
in the crowded 2012 Stanford
lineup big names like

Stephen Piscotty and Kenny
Diekroeger manned the left
side of the infield. The former
high school star found himself
in an unfamiliar situation
relegated to a bench role, he
only appeared in seven games
all season.

The outlook has changed
this season, as a solid showing
last summer gave Slater the
boost he needed to succeed for
the Cardinal this spring.

"A lot of it's the confidence
thing. Coming off that injury,
I guess I wasn't really com
fortable at the plate," Slater
said. "I played summer ball in
Rhode Island and got a lot of
