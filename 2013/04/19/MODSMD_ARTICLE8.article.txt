# SLATED FOR SUCCESS
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
Successful players await
their opportunity to break
through and seize their
chance when it arises. Lou
Gehrig's legendary streak
of appearances started when he was
penciled in to the starting lineup
one day in the stead of slumping
first baseman Wally Pipp. Gehrig
made the most of his opportunity,
and â€”2,130 consecutive games later
found himself the owner of one of
baseball's most legendary records.
It always starts somewhere.
Just ask Austin Slater.
After entering Stanford as one
of the premier baseball prospects in
the country, sitting on the bench his
freshman year was an adjustment
for current sophomore Slater.
"My role was to be a backup, you
know, come in whenever I needed to
be called in, get at bats whenever
we were up or down by a lot," Slater
reminisced as he chuckled. "It was
tough, sitting on the bench. That
was really the first time I'd ever
done that in my life."
But Slater said his time on the
bench was motivation for him to
work harder over the summer and

during the fall to prove to the coach
es that he deserved a spot on the
field.

Earlier this season, Slater final
ly got his shot when one of Stan
ford's premier power hitters, right
fielder Austin Wilson, went down
with an injury that left a hole in the
middle of the lineup.
Slater was slotted into light field
in the injured slugger's place and he
took advantage of the opportunity.
After going 0-3 in his first start at
Rice, he notched two hits in each of
four games in a row and played a
role in helping the Cardinal team
achieve its early-season nine-game
winning streak. The sophomore
currently leads the team with eight
doubles, has a .308 batting average
third among the Cardinal's
everyday starters and is tied for
the team lead with 18 RBI.
However, it wasn't always so
clear to Slater that his story would
take that happy turn.
As a senior at The Bolles School
in Jacksonville, Fla., in 2011, Austin
Slater was considered the best
prospect in the state by Prospect
Wire. He was prepared to anchor
the left side of the infield and lead
Bolles to its third consecutive state
