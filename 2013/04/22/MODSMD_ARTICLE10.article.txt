## The
						resilience of Boston, my hometown 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
We like to think of
sports as a true
fantasy. Uninflu
enced by outside
events, they are a
separate reality from the harsh truth
of the real world, governed by arbi
trary and archaic rules, a visible ruler
and outcomes determined exclusively
by what goes on inside the arena as
opposed to some sneakiness outside
of it. In short, when we watch sports,
we want to get sucked in. We want to
be consumed by their spectacle. We
want to escape from the real world.
Events like those of the last week
tend to crush that idealistic vision.
Tragedies like the one unfolding in
Boston, tragedies that bring the real
world into the sports world, tend to
put everything into a stark perspec
tive.
Many have argued that post-9/11
America has become desensitized to
horrific violence. We cannot go even
a few days without reading the al
most-templated headline "Attacks in
X kill Y, wound Z others."
But most of the time we have no
real idea of where those places are or
what they are like. We foolishly tend
to think of them as an entire world
away, separated by circumstance
and geography and ideology. We
mourn the tragedy and the signifi
cant losses in human life, but we
rarely stop to consider exactly how
we would feel in those same shoes.
This time, things are different for
me. I am a Bostonian by birth, and
lived in Waltham, Mass., for 11 years
before moving to California. The at
tacks on the Boston Marathon and
the subsequent manhunt that
spanned a night and a day were
more tangible to me than anything
else I can recall witnessing from
afar.
I have proudly celebrated Patriot
Day, one of the most irreverent of
Boston sporting holidays, and wide
ly derided as an excuse for the en
tirety of Massachusetts to get drunk
before noon. It remains one of my fa
vorite holidays. I have stood near the
finish line of the Boston Marathon,
run the last half-mile with my uncle,
and stayed home from school to
watch the early afternoon Red Sox
game, which was much more fun be
fore the era of the chicken and beer
clubhouse.
And I know Boston well. When
the news reports that a police officer
was shot and killed in the line of du
ty at the corner of Vassar Street and
Main Street, I know exactly where
that is. I've spent entire afternoons
less than a stone's throw away from
that very street corner.
When the pursuit finally ended, it
was in Watertown, less than a few
miles from my old home in Waltham.
The harsh reality of the situation is
that events aren't unfolding half a
world away; they are happening in
places I know and love. That thought
in and of itself is devastating.
Some events are just bigger than
sports; the horrors of the past few
days serve as a tragic example. Yes
terday, all the major Boston sports
teams were in action, and yet I took
only a passing glance at the scores. I
was still digesting exactly what had
happened when I received a call
from a close childhood friend from
Boston.
I picked up the phone and asked
what was up, if everyone was okay.
My friend responded, "Dude, every
one's fine. But did you see the
Celtics game? The Knicks must have
paid off the refs or something." I
stared blankly for a few seconds be
fore bursting into uncontrollable
laughter.
This is the notorious strength of
Boston. I am convinced something in
the water there makes people un
shakeable. No matter what the cir
cumstances are, the hearty guaran
tee is that the people of Massachu
setts will persevere and endure.
Stubbornness is in their DNA, along
with an unwillingness to give up
without a fight. That is the true
power of the New England commu
nity. It is that power that gives me
great hope for the future. Time is the
greatest healer of all; by this time
next year, I pray that all wounds are
healed, all loose ends tied up and all
hatred dissipated. And I know that
next year's Boston Marathon won't
just happen, but that it will be a fes
tive, joyous and happy affair. The
strong spirits of the people of Boston
all but guarantee that.
