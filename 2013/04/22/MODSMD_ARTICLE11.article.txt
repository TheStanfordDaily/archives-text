### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Coming off what was arguably its best per

play today in Valencia, Calif., for the Pac-12
Championships and the team appears primed

finishes to seven, and will be looking to record

title. Despite describing herself as a "risk tak

will require her to be a bit more conservative
than usual.
"I know Valencia is a challenging course,"
Stackhouse said. "I think this course is different
[from Karsten] in that it requires a lot of strate
gy. When I go into tournaments, my goal is to
make as many birdies as I can, and that's still
going to be my aim. For this tournament,

week. Each team will need to count its top five golfers per day, so depth should be crucial.
