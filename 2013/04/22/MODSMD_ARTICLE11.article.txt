# POSTSEASON PRESSURE
## CARDINAL PREPS FOR PAC-12 TOURNEY 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Coming off what was arguably its best per
formance of the season at the PING/ASU Invi
tational, the Stanford women's golf team begins
play today in Valencia, Calif., for the Pac-12
Championships and the team appears primed
for a postseason run.
In Tempe, Ariz., on the Karsten Golf Course,
the Stanford women had what Head Coach
Anne Walker called a "terrific performance."
The Cardinal defeated seven conference oppo
nents, including top-ranked USC, while tying
for third with then-No. 7 Arizona State.
"We know that we have a strong enough
team to win this week," Walker said, "but we al
so know that we play in the strongest confer
ence in women's golf, with six teams ranked
11th or higher... The team that wins will have to
play extremely well."
Not only should the team be in the hunt,
freshman Mariah Stackhouse should be in con
tention for the individual title. This freshman
sensation has run her string of top-10 individual
finishes to seven, and will be looking to record
her 100 th career victory and her third collegiate
title. Despite describing herself as a "risk tak
er," Stackhouse knows the course in Valencia
will require her to be a bit more conservative
than usual.
"I know Valencia is a challenging course,"
Stackhouse said. "I think this course is different
[from Karsten] in that it requires a lot of strate
gy. When I go into tournaments, my goal is to
make as many birdies as I can, and that's still
going to be my aim. For this tournament,

week. Each team will need to count its top five golfers per day, so depth should be crucial.
though, I'm going to have to change
my mindset to think more strategi
cally. I'll keep my aggressive mindset
but on certain holes I'll need to think
smarter and focus on my tenden
cies."
However talented Stackhouse
may be, Stanford's depth, just as it
was at PING, will be key to its plac
ingâ€” especially crucial at Pac-12s,
where five scores are counted each
day instead of the usual four. This
means freshman Lauren Kim, senior
Sally Watson and sophomore Mariko
Ibmangan will need solid perform
ances in order to ensure Stanford
doesn't become a one-player show.
Watson, the only senior who has
seen regular tournament play this

season, has heated up at just the
right time. After tying for second at
the Edean Ihlanfeldt tournament in
October, she didn't post another top
-15 individual finish until her victory
at the Sonoma State Invitational in
early April. She finished 16th at
PING, and her two-under-par per
formance was the Scotland native's
best cumulative score of the season.
"I think in order to be successful
on the Valencia Course we will need
to drive the ball well and like in any
championship, we will need to putt
well, but all in all I think this course
plays to our strengths as you have to
plan your way around the course and
play smart," Watson said. "I don't
feel any extra pressure being a sen
ior, I am just looking forward to com
peting as always and hoping that we
all perform our best."
Kim is on the opposite side of the
spectrum from Watson, as this is her
first collegiate postseason event.

Stanford's most consistent golfer
other than Staekhouse, the freshman
has fully embraced Walker's "see-it
to-achieve-it" mantra, and despite
her youth, carries the swagger of a
tested veteran.
"We are very confident after our
finish at ASU," Kim said. "We
showed ourselves that we can com
pete with any team in the country. I
do believe we can come home with a
win, but we're staying in the present
and not getting too far ahead of our
selves."
This team hopes it is the one that
can break the long dry spell for Stan
ford's women's golf program. Since
winning for the only time in 1999,
Stanford's average finish at the con
ference tournament is sixth. The
Cardinal's best performance since
2002 is a fifth-place finish in 2011.
