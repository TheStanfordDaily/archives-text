# Card wins wild series
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
In a matchup between the
small-ball loving defending na
tional champions and a Cardinal
squad that seems to prefer
pitcher's duels to shootouts,
fans at Sunken Diamond got the
opposite of what was expected.
Stanford continued its offensive
resurgence spurred by the re
turn of junior right-fielder
Austin Wilson to put up 25 runs
on the weekend, including 21 in
the final two games, to take the
series againt Arizona 2-1.

The first two games of the
series had no shortage of excite
ment, with No. 17 Stanford (22-
12, 9-6 Pac-12) and No. 21 Ari
zona (25-14, 9-9 Pac-12) trading
blows to set up a rubber match.
Friday did not start on a
good foot for the Cardinal or its
senior ace Mark Appel. Appel, a
favorite for the Golden Spikes
Award (given to the nation's
best collegiate baseball player)

looked more like the nation's
unluckiest player through four
innings.
Arizona leadoff hitter John
ny Field skied to deep center in
the first at-bat of the series.
Sophomore catcher-turned-cen
terfielder Wayne Taylor could
n't make the catch, allowing the
ball to bounce off his glove for a
three-base error. Field scored
on a double two batters later.
In the third inning, the Wild
cats took a 2-0 lead on another
wild, and unlucky, play, again
coming off the bat of Field.

BOTAO HU/The Stanford Daily
Junior first baseman Brian Ragira (above) helped lead the charge with three RBI Sunday as
Stanford took a critical Pac-12 series against NCAA defending champion Arizona, 2-1.
Field hit a pop fly to right
field, an easy play for Wilson,
but Wilson slipped and fell
while tracking the ball down
and Field ended up with a no
out RBI triple.
Appel buckled down to
strand Field, which would
prove vital later, and allowed
only one more run in the re
mainder of his 6.2 innings of
work.
Stanford charged back
behind the clutch hitting of
Wilson, who atoned for his
slip in right field. With the
bases loaded, two outs and
one run already in, Wilson
muscled a two-strike pitch up
the middle for the game-tying
two-RBI single.
And that single signaled a
change of luck. A throwing
error allowed sophomore des
ignated hitter Austin Slater
to get on base in the sixth in
ning with nobody out. After
junior catcher Brant Whiting
bunted him over to second,
sophomore third baseman
Alex Blandino came through
in the clutch, delivering the
game-winning RBI double to
left field that put Stanford up
by the final score of 4-3.
The Cardinal almost saw
its hard-fought lead slip away
at the very end. Senior pitch
er Garrett Hughes, who had
relieved Appel with 1.1 score
less innings through the
eighth, allowed the first two
Wildcats to reach base on a
hit-by-pitch and a walk. Jun
ior Sam Lindquist came in to
try to bail Hughes out and
faced a tough spot.
After a sacrifice bunt,
Lindquist intentionally walked
Field to load the bases with
only one out and Stanford
clinging to its 4-3 edge.
Lindquist got the ground ball
he needed, and Blandino
made a great play to retire
the lead runner at home while
falling to the ground to keep
Stanford ahead. On the next
play, Lindquist made anoth
er great play on a come
backer to the mound to record
the final out, earn the save and
give Stanford and Appel a big
victory.

"I thought we battled,"
said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We made a couple er
rors which gave them some
runs, but Mark came up with
some big spots when they
could have really added on."
Saturday's contest had
about everything a baseball
game could possibly have.
From the bottom of the third
through the bottom of the
fifth, the Cardinal and the
Wildcats combined for 14
runs, scoring in all five half in
nings.
That stretch saw three
Stanford pitchers chased from
the game. Senior starting
pitcher Dean McArdle left af
ter allowing five runs in 3.2 in
nings, and freshmen Marcus
Brakeman and Logan James
combined to allow four more
runs while retiring just two
Wildcat hitters.
But Stanford fought back
late, scoring two in the sev
enth and one in the eighth to
tie the game at nine. That
ninth run came off the bat of
junior first baseman Brian Ra
gira, who singled in the eighth
for his fourth hit of the game.
Freshman relief pitcher
Daniel Starwalt couldn't keep
it tied for long. Starwalt had
pitched 3.1 scoreless innings
coming into the ninth, but af
ter striking out the leadoff hit
ter, allowed a solo homer to
Wildcat third baseman Bran
don Dixon that proved to be
the winning margin.
Somehow, Sunday's rub
ber match proved to be the
craziest of them all, starting
with Stanford's defense falling
apart in the second inning.
Errors by Blandino and
junior second baseman Danny
Diekroeger helped the Wild

cats load the bases with only
one out against sophomore
starting pitcher John
Hochstatter. Pinch hitter Ri
ley Moore drove in everybody
with a grand slam to turn a 2-
0 Stanford lead into a 4-2 Ari
zona edge.
On the next pitch,
Hochstatter plunked first
baseman Joseph Maggi and
was promptly ejected by um
pire Ramon Armendariz.
Stanford players said after
the game that they were
stunned by the ejection, and
the shock quickly turned into
more Wildcats runs. Fresh
man reliever Bobby Zarubin
gave up two runs on four hits
while recording only the sec
ond out of the inning before
Hughes ended the rally.
But just like on Saturday,
Stanford came roaring back.
Slater contributed in a big
way, going 3-5 with five RBI
and three runs scored while
playing back in right field.
Ragira homered in the thud
to cut the lead to one and a
five-run fourth inning gave
Stanford the lead for good.
Lindquist shined again on
Sunday, but in a very differ
ent way than Friday night.
The junior threw 76 pitches
over five scoreless innings to
earn his first win of the sea
son and seal the series for the
Cardinal.
Stanford takes on San
Jose State at Sunken Dia
mond Hiesday before head
ing to Oregon for the first of
two consecutive Pac-12 road
trips. First pitch Tuesday is
scheduled for 5:30 p.m.
