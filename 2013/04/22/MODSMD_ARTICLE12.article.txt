# Card wins wild series
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
In a matchup between the
small-ball loving defending na
tional champions and a Cardinal
squad that seems to prefer
pitcher's duels to shootouts,
fans at Sunken Diamond got the
opposite of what was expected.
Stanford continued its offensive
resurgence spurred by the re
turn of junior right-fielder
Austin Wilson to put up 25 runs
on the weekend, including 21 in
the final two games, to take the
series againt Arizona 2-1.

The first two games of the
series had no shortage of excite
ment, with No. 17 Stanford (22-
12, 9-6 Pac-12) and No. 21 Ari
zona (25-14, 9-9 Pac-12) trading
blows to set up a rubber match.
Friday did not start on a
good foot for the Cardinal or its
senior ace Mark Appel. Appel, a
favorite for the Golden Spikes
Award (given to the nation's
best collegiate baseball player)

looked more like the nation's
unluckiest player through four
innings.
Arizona leadoff hitter John
ny Field skied to deep center in
the first at-bat of the series.
Sophomore catcher-turned-cen
terfielder Wayne Taylor could
n't make the catch, allowing the
ball to bounce off his glove for a
three-base error. Field scored
on a double two batters later.
In the third inning, the Wild
cats took a 2-0 lead on another
wild, and unlucky, play, again
coming off the bat of Field.
