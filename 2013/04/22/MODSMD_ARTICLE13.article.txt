## Stanford falls short at NCAA semifinals 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
For the sixth time in seven years, and the
13th time overall, Stanford women's gymnas
tics earned a spot in the NCAA Champi
onship weekend. But the Cardinal couldn't
live up to its expectations, nor to last year's
fourth-place performance, as it finished sixth
place out of six teams in its semifinal round on

the lone bright spot for the Cardinal, scoring
a 9.900 to tie for third overall. Dayton, by fin
ishing in the top three, earned a chance to
compete on Sunday in the individual events,
where she finished 14th overall with a score of
