## Stanford falls short at NCAA semifinals 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
For the sixth time in seven years, and the
13th time overall, Stanford women's gymnas
tics earned a spot in the NCAA Champi
onship weekend. But the Cardinal couldn't
live up to its expectations, nor to last year's
fourth-place performance, as it finished sixth
place out of six teams in its semifinal round on
Friday afternoon.
The weekend was split up into two semifi
nal rounds with six teams in each round; the
top three teams in each group advanced to the
Super Six competition on Saturday. No. 9
Stanford was matched up with No. 1 Florida,
No. 4 Georgia, No. 5 LSU, No. 8 Minnesota
and Illinois. Stanford needed a much higher
team score than its 194.700, as Florida, LSU,
and Georgia advanced to the Super Six with
scores of 197.775, 197.325, and 197.150, re
spectively.
Stanford began the meet on floor, scoring
a team score of 49.025. Stanford was led by
freshman Taylor Rice, whose 9.875 in her
NCAA Championships debut tied her season
high. Senior Ashley Morgan, who earned sec
ond-team Ail-American honors on floor this
season, finished second for the Cardinal with
a score of 9.825. Stanford's 49.025 was good
for third place, as the Cardinal remained in
contention after the first round.
The team next performed on vault, where
it began to face major problems. The team
scored a 48.950, its only vault score of the sea
son below 49.000. Senior Nicole Dayton was
the lone bright spot for the Cardinal, scoring
a 9.900 to tie for third overall. Dayton, by fin
ishing in the top three, earned a chance to
compete on Sunday in the individual events,
where she finished 14th overall with a score of
9.8583.
However, two of Stan
ford's most consistent gym
nasts, Morgan and sopho
more Ivana Hong, each fin
ished with a score of 9.675,
which were Morgan's sec
ond-worst vault score of the
season and Hong's worst.

Even worse for the Cardinal,
Hong, who had been slated
to be one of Stanford's all
around performers, injured
herself on her routine and
had to sit out the next two
rounds. Stanford was still
alive heading into the third
rotation, but would need a
strong performance to get
back into the meet.
That strong performance
was not in the cards, as
things continued to go down
hill on bars, where Stan

ford's 48.200 score was the
team's worst event score of
the season. Stanford suf
fered two falls to begin the
event, both earning sub
-9.000 scores. Sophomore
Becky Wing, who has only
competed in two meets all
season and is coming off an
ACL tear, did her best to
help Stanford get back on
track, filling in for Hong
with a score of 9.700.
After a pair of 9.850's by
sophomores Samantha
Shapiro and Kritina Vaculik,
sophomore Alex Archer un
leashed a career-best 9.875
to lead Stanford.
"I can't say it was my
score that made that routine
my career best," Archer
said, "because it was the mo
ment that I will remember
forever. Being able to do that
at a NCAA Championships
meant more to me than any
score the judges could've
given me."
Despite Archer's per
formance, Stanford knew its
deficit was too large heading
into the final rotation. It had
a team score of 146.175, but
would need a score in the
197-point range to earn a
top-three finish. However,
the Cardinal continued to
compete, earning a score of
48.525 on the beam. Rice and
Junior Shona Morgan each
put up a 9.850 for their last
events of the season.
With the season now over,
Stanford loses seniors Ash
ley Morgan and Dayton, two
of the team's strongest com
petitors for years on end.

into the final rotation. It had
a team score of 146.175, but
would need a score in the
197-point range to earn a
top-three finish. However,
the Cardinal continued to
compete, earning a score of
48.525 on the beam. Rice and
Junior Shona Morgan each
put up a 9.850 for their last
events of the season.
With the season now over,
Stanford loses seniors Ash
ley Morgan and Dayton, two
of the team's strongest com
petitors for years on end.
