## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Final Thoughts on Suites 
### Miles Unterreiner 
This will be my final individ
ual column on Suites Dining.
(I may, however, co-author a
short op-ecl with Associate Dean
of Residential Education Nate
Boswell on the process of working
together and the lessons we've
learned.) After weeks of negotia
tion and discussions between
Suites representatives, Boswell
and ResEd Director of Operations
Aaron Buzay, I am very happy to
report, as The Daily did last week,
that Suites Dining will remain stu
dent-run next year, as it has for
the past 30 years.
In this column, I'd like to do a
few things: first, clarify what ex
actly Suites is going to look like
next year; second, outline what
still has to be done before the final
papers are signed; and third, offer
a few thoughts on how the process
has gone, and share a few brief re
flections on why I think it has
gone so well.
First, it is my pleasure to re
port that the governance struc
ture of Suites Dining will look
nearly identical to the form it has
had since Suites Dining's founding
in 1982. This year's CEO and CFO
have already selected next year's
student leadership team. There
will be, as there have been in past
years, eight student managers
(two per club) and one CFO and
CEO pair to oversee all four clubs.
That student leadership team will
retain independent control over
Suites Dining's finances and oper
ations to the same (or perhaps, as
I'll note later, even greater) extent
that managers have exercised up
to this point.
Suites Dining will also be able
to rehire the current four chefs:
Dennis, Caroline, Tony, and
Frank. (This is something about
which I am, and I think many
Suites residents are, especially
happy.) The chefs' compensation
levels have yet to be finalized, al
though they will likely be similar,
and the current CEO and CFO of
Suites are currently compiling
next year's projected budget.
That budget, happily, will likely in
clude the continued hiring of stu
dent hashers another major
component of Suites Dining cul
ture. Furthermore, the budget is
likely to eliminate the fiscal prob
lems caused by Res Ed's over-allo
cation of student money to food by
reducing the percentage of money
that must be directed towards
food purchases.
There will be one major change
to Suites Dining's current gover
nance structure: the establish
ment of a long-term Board of Di
rectors to oversee and provide ad
vice to all eight managers, the
CEO and CFO and the chefs. That
Board of Directors will most likely
include former student man
agers/CEOs/CFOs, current Suites
residents, one or more ASSU rep
resentatives from the Senate or
Exec and one University repre
sentative. (Who in particular that
will be has not yet been deter
mined.)
The Board will serve three cru
cial functions: first, providing a
continuous body (with the same or
similar membership composition
each year) to be accountable for
any major complaints that future
Suites residents might have; sec
ond, serving as the body responsi
ble for any major structural
changes to Suites Dining's struc
ture or governing policies, in case
those prove to be necessary; and
third, serving as a communicative
liaison between Suites residents
and the University.
There are, to be fair, some rel
atively significant issues that still
have to be worked out. Perhaps
most seriously, there remain bar
riers to the efficient allocation of
food and capital expenses between
all four clubs. Prior to 2008, food
and capital expenditures were al
most entirely flexible; money
could be freely moved between
clubs as well as between food and
non-food expenses almost at will,
meaning that money was very
rarely wasted or misallocated.
That flexibility is unlikely to
return completely, given height
ened (and often quite reasonable)
University restrictions on the
management of student money.
But by working together with
ResEd and other University of
fices over the next year, we hope
that we can move in that direction
by establishing and maintaining
our own reserve accounts, rather
than accounts held by the Univer
sity; rendering the process of pur
chasing capital improvements eas
ier and less cumbersome for stu
dent managers; and assuming

greater responsibility for the
training, payment and manage
ment of Suites staff and hashers.
Overall, however, I think I can
honestly report that the campaign
to save Suites has been almost en
tirely successful. I believe that
there are a few big reasons for
that, and I'd like to share them
with you.
First, the tremendous amount
of support Suites has received
from the entire student body
made an enormous difference.
This campaign has awakened me
to the remarkable solidarity that
communities across campus can
share when we really put in the ef
fort â€” solidarity that proved es
sential to gaining over 2,500 signa
tures on a petition to save Suites,
solidarity that earned a unani
mous statement of support for
Suites' independence from the
Undergraduate Senate, and soli
darity that showed up in serious
force at a protest in White Plaza.
Thank you so much for the help,
Stanford! We owe you one.
Second, when we speak up
forcefully about things we as stu
dents really care about, the ad
ministration can and often will lis
ten. That is a huge blessing and
not one that should be taken light
ly. Nate Boswell and Aaron Buzay,
after enduring some pretty heated
rhetoric from the student side,
were happy and willing to sit down
with us and work out a satisfacto
ry solution. I'm very grateful for
that, and I think they'll be equally
happy to listen the next time this
type of situation rolls around. And
I'd also like to sincerely thank
whoever it was in the higher eche
lons of the Stanford hierarchy who
changed his or her mind and de
cided to make the decision to keep
Suites the way it is. Thank you so
much.
And third, there is a lot of work
left to be done across campus, and
it will be hard work. One of the
biggest lessons I took away from
this whole experience is that the
need for student freedom and in
dependence reaches way beyond
Suites. The last five years have
brought, as I have mentioned be
fore, a new institutional attitude
toward the management of inde
pendent residences and kitchens
an attitude that tends to priori
tize subcontracting, standardiza
tion and risk management over
student autonomy, residential
freedom and the interests of cam
pus workers.
In some cases, that institution
al attitude is entirely justified and
warranted. In others, it isn't.
I won't be here next year a
moving-on I couldn't regret more,
as I have loved this place since the
day I arrived but I hope that, if
our campaign this year did any
thing, it inspired future students
to push back against that trend in
ways that are reasonable, in
formed and built off the memory
of what Stanford used to be.
This is a pretty special campus.
It's weird, quirky, and thrives on
the little things the little things
that can all-too-often get ground
up in the gears of administrative
machinery.
Let's keep Stanford special,
and keep it free.

Miles would like to thank everyone
who helped keep Suites free (that's a
lot of you!). Email him anytime at
milesul @ Stanford, edu.

When we speak up
forcefully about
things we as
students care about
the administration
can and often will
listen.
