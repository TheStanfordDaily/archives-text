## Remembering Sandy Hook 
### MATTHEW COLFORD '14 
When Hurricane Sandy hit
the East Coast, I cried
every morning at 7 a.m. for
a week. Like clockwork, every day, I
would get up and send a summary
of the latest death reports and a list
of local officials affected by the
storm to my boss at the White
House. With time, though, I over
came the grief that came from read
ing and summarizing countless sto
ries about people losing homes,
friends losing friends, and families
losing them loved ones. And then
came Sandy Hook.
On December 14th, my boss
walked into the small office I shared
with another intern and asked me
with a distinct urgency to prepare a
bio of the Mayor of Newtown, Con
necticut. Thinking nothing of it, I
sent the bio off and returned to my
desk. As updates about the shoot
ings at Sandy Hook Elementary
School began to filter in, however, I
realized it was the beginning of
what was going to be a very long
day. Without warning, and
somewhat unconsciously, I once
again began to cry for those whose
lives and whose pain and despair I
could not help but feel despite my

official capacity as an outsider.
In the weeks that followed, how
ever, this despair was replaced by
hope, as I watched officials from all
over the country and from both
parties tell our office that they
shared in the President's senti
ment: something had to be done.
And so, many months later, long
gone from my internship and hop
ing that the emotions I felt had
been shared by our lawmakers, I
looked forward to a day like this
last Wednesday, when the Senate
had the opportunity to codify what
90 percent of Americans support
and believe is already law: manda
tory universal background checks.
To the surprise of few, however,
this reasonable, bi-partisan bill
failed. And so, many months after
the terrible tragedy I was forced to
respond to, I watched as the Presi
dent announced the bad news:
Wednesday was a shameful day in
Washington. And so, once again,
many months after the terrible
tragedy to which I was forced to re
spond.
I do not have a friend or relative
who has been killed by gun violence.
I cannot begin to understand the

pain of such a loss, and I am devas
tated for those individuals who
have.
More than devastated, though, I
am fearful. I fear that we will never
have meaningful, reasonable gun
control legislation in this country. I
fear that our representatives will
continue to vote with their interests
rather than their conscience. I fear
that there will come a day when I
have no more tears to shed for the
victims of tragedies such Sandy
Hook, and I fear that we will some
how all forget the 20 children who
were gunned down in their class
rooms.
But while I am afraid, I am de
termined. And unwavering. And
motivated. And if you share in this
feeling, I urge you to speak up,
write and call your representatives,
have these conversations with your
peers. With your voice and mine
and those of the millions in this
country who hope for meaningful
change on this issue, we may yet
still be able to honor the countless
souls who have perished at the
hands of gun violence.
