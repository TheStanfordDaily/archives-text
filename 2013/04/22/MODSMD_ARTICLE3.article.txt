# Review writer under fire
## Former columnist accused of several instances of plagiarism TECHNOLOGY 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH EDITOR IN CHIEF 
After a former Stanford Review columnist came under
fire last week for alleged plagiarism in a 2012 article, evi
dence of further plagiarism in some of the columnist's oth
er articles has come to light. As of Sunday night, all but
one story attributed to the former columnist Vasant
Ramachandran 'll M.S. 'l2 had been removed from
The Review's website.
The original controversy centered on a 2012 Review
article Should College Athletes Get Paid? by Ra
machandran which bore extensive similarities to a 2006
article The Other Side: College Athletes Shouldn't Be
Paid, by Dan Cassavaugh published in Imprint Maga
zine.
While that article was quickly removed from The Re
view's website on Thursday, The Daily used an online pla-
giarism checker tool to ex
amine the other stories list
ed on Ramachandran's Re
view archive.

The checker highlighted
two of 15 stories written by
Ramachandran as contain
ing "possible plagiarism."
Daily editors subsequently
compared the original arti
cles line-by-line with Ra
machandran's works, both of
which offered fairly clear ev
idence of plagiarism from the
previously published sources.
In a May 2011 column ti
tled Conservative Prison Re
form: Less Crime, Less
Waste, Ramachandran wrote
about conservative lawmak
ers latching onto prison re
form in a piece that bore ex
tensive similarities to a Los
Angeles Times article on
the same subject written
four months earlier.
In addition to sharing a
nearly identical tone, struc
ture and message, one para
graph was in effect lifted di
rectly from the earlier arti
cle, with the only alteration
to a complex concluding sen
tence being the addition of
quotation marks.
Another of Ramachan
dran's columns, which was
published in February 2011
and which focused on fixing
California's rising high
school dropout rate, offers
similar indications of plagia
rism, borrowing from
a piece by Tom Elias that
had been published by The
Record Searchlight a few
weeks before Ramachan
dran's column.
For one sentence, only
the beginning's structure and
a few of the connecting
words have been changed. An
other section offers more dif
ferences between Ra
machandran's column and
Elias' piece, but retains
unaltered a phrase com
menting on "the rise of char
ter schools and the prolifera
tion of private schools."
Current Review Editor
in Chief Judith Romea 'l4
made the decision to remove
the remainder of Ramachan
dran's articles from The Re
view's site over the weekend

until their staff could check
them for signs of plagiarism.
"We took them [all of Ra
machandran's articles] down
to ensure that they did not
contain any other evidence
of plagiarism," Romea said.
"The ones that we deem to
be original we will put back
up immediately."
Kevin Baumgartner 'll,
who was The Review's opin
ion editor from February to
June 2011, said that he was
able to find Ramachandran's
original rough draft on the
California high school
dropout rate. According to
Baumgartner, that draft was
also flagged as "possibly pla
giarized" by an online pla
giarism detection tool.
"The evidence you've
presented is overwhelming,"
he wrote in an email to The
Daily, "and I'm forced to
conclude that the [three arti
cles] you highlighted were
probably plagiarized. To the
best of my knowledge, the
Review had no policy man
dating plagiarism checks for
any section, neither during
my term nor during the
tenure of my immediate
predecessor."
"Obviously, I should have
been more diligent," Baum
gartner added. "I regret be
ing involved in this incident
and apologize on behalf of
the 2010-2011 Review. I am
confident that the current
Review leadership will re
spond to this incident quick
ly and firmly and I hope
that they will consider tight
ening the pre-publication
editing and assessment
process."
Romea said that The Re
view will release an official
statement this morning. As
of Sunday evening, The Dai
ly has not been able to reach
Ramachandran for com
ment.

The tivo articles above,
and the first column dis
covered on Thursday, were
the only potential incidents
of plagiarism flagged by
the free version of the on
line checker used by The
Daily.
