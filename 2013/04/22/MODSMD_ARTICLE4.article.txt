# Q&A ADAM JOHNSON ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH, PULITZER WINNER
## 
### SOO JI LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Adam Johnson, Associate Profes
sor of English, recently won the 2013
Pulitzer Prize in fiction for his novel
"The Orphan Master's Son." The
work focuses on a fictional character
who initially works for and then falls
victim to the North Korean state,
and it was described as "an exquis
itely crafted novel" by the Pulitzer
committee. The Daily sat down with
Johnson to discuss his work at Stan
ford, his novel and the experience of
winning a Pulitzer Prize.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
was the inspiration for "The Or
phan Master's Son?"
Adam Johnson (AJ): I teach a
class on novel-writing and we read
novels and I usually try to throw in
one memoir. So as we try to create
fictional people in fake stories, we
could look at one real person telling
his or her real story just to help keep
perspective.
One year I chose a memoir called
"The Aquariums of Pyongyang,"
released [in] 2004 ... It was the sto
ry of Kang Chol-Hwan and his time
in a North Korean gulag called Yo
dok, which is [formally named]
Camp 15.1 didn't really understand
[that] the gulag system was alive
and well in the world, and I started
reading more and more books
about North Korea. Even though I
thought I was informed and educat
ed, I realized I didn't know any
thing about that part of the world.
I'm a writer and the more I read,
the more I started writing little
voices and dialogues and descrip
tions. And suddenly my story just
started coming. I didn't set out to do
anything.
TSD: Could you describe your ini
tial reactions when you found out
that the novel was awarded a
Pulitzer?
AJ: The committee that gives the
prize doesn't tell the finalists or
the recipients. They just put it on
a website. I was talking to some
one and he said, "Hey I heard you
won the Pulitzer Prize," and I
barked at him. He said "Congrat
ulations on winning the Pulitzer
Prize" and I barked at him. I said,
"Don't say shit like that!" in an an
gry way. I don't know why â€”it
just came out. But then he googled
it and showed it to me and said,
"Actually you did." That's how I
found out.
TSD: How challenging was the
writing process for the book?
AJ: It was a really challenging
book to write, though very reward
ing. I had to go far outside my own
experience [in] writing about anoth
er culture in a very different kind of
society that sees the world
much differently from me. So
I had to leave my comfort
zone. But it was very, very re
warding to try to capture
lives of other people that are
so much different than my
own. That sounds like a pret
ty lame answer. It was really
hard to write.
I would show my work to
my Korean-American friends
and they were like, "Dude, I
don't know anything about
Korea." I showed it to a friend
from mine, she's from South
Korea and she's a writer: "I
don't know anything about
North Korea." It was just
hard to find people to help me
get it light.

TSD: What did your re
search entail?
AJ: I read a lot of books. I
read a lot of the testimonials
of defectors online. I be
friended one man who was
from North Korea he was
very helpful. He read the
book and helped me and I
tried to immerse myself in
Korean history, Korean cul
ture and Korean music. If I
had known when I first
taught that book that I was
going to spend six years
writing about Korean cul
ture, I would have learned
Korean. That's the first
thing I would have done. The
book just grew in a strange
way.
TSD: Do you have any con
cerns about the current sit
uation in North Korea?
AJ: Yes, there are many.
I'm no expert on the political,

military, nuclear or economic
dimensions. My book was
about normal people in North
Korea, and I really feel for
those people who are trapped
by a regime that's acting dan
gerously.
TSD: What are you working
on right now?
AJ: I just finished a long
article on North Korea and
I've been working on a short
story not about North Ko
rea.
TSD: Who are your favorite
fiction writers?
AJ: Tobias Wolff and Eliz
abeth Tallent.

TSD: To you, what's most
appealing about teaching
Stanford students?
AJ: Where do I begin?
Stanford students are awe
some. They're ravenous for

narratives. They love short
stories. They're so insightful.
They're way better writers
than I was as an undergradu
ate. I believe we're going to
hear from a lot of the writers
here in the undergraduate
program some day. They're
going to be famous writers,
not famous as in, 'Oh they're
stars,' but as in writing books
that matter.
TSD: If you could give any
advice to aspiring student
writers, what would it be?
AJ: I favor labor over tal
ent. I think if you read a lot
and you have your ear tuned
to stones, and they speak to
you and haunt you, those are
the stories to write. If you do
a lot of work, you're going to
do justice to them.
