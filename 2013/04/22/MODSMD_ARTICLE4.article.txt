# Q&A ADAM JOHNSON ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH, PULITZER WINNER
## 
### SOO JI LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Adam Johnson, Associate Profes
sor of English, recently won the 2013
Pulitzer Prize in fiction for his novel
"The Orphan Master's Son." The
work focuses on a fictional character
who initially works for and then falls
victim to the North Korean state,
and it was described as "an exquis
itely crafted novel" by the Pulitzer
committee. The Daily sat down with
Johnson to discuss his work at Stan
ford, his novel and the experience of
winning a Pulitzer Prize.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
was the inspiration for "The Or
phan Master's Son?"
Adam Johnson (AJ): I teach a
class on novel-writing and we read
novels and I usually try to throw in
one memoir. So as we try to create
fictional people in fake stories, we
could look at one real person telling
his or her real story just to help keep
perspective.
One year I chose a memoir called
"The Aquariums of Pyongyang,"
released [in] 2004 ... It was the sto
ry of Kang Chol-Hwan and his time
in a North Korean gulag called Yo
dok, which is [formally named]
Camp 15.1 didn't really understand
[that] the gulag system was alive
and well in the world, and I started
reading more and more books
about North Korea. Even though I
thought I was informed and educat
ed, I realized I didn't know any
thing about that part of the world.
I'm a writer and the more I read,
the more I started writing little
voices and dialogues and descrip
tions. And suddenly my story just
started coming. I didn't set out to do
anything.
TSD: Could you describe your ini
tial reactions when you found out
that the novel was awarded a
Pulitzer?
AJ: The committee that gives the
prize doesn't tell the finalists or
the recipients. They just put it on
a website. I was talking to some
one and he said, "Hey I heard you
won the Pulitzer Prize," and I
barked at him. He said "Congrat
ulations on winning the Pulitzer
Prize" and I barked at him. I said,
"Don't say shit like that!" in an an
gry way. I don't know why â€”it
just came out. But then he googled
it and showed it to me and said,
"Actually you did." That's how I
found out.
TSD: How challenging was the
writing process for the book?
AJ: It was a really challenging
book to write, though very reward
ing. I had to go far outside my own
experience [in] writing about anoth
er culture in a very different kind of
