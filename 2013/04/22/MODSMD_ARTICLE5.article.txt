# Researchers study Twitter's influence on stocks
## 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Social media websites like Twitter can play a
key role in increasing visibility for small busi
nesses, according to a recent study led by Eliza
beth Blankespoor, associate professor of account
ing at the Graduate School of Business.
Blankespoor, who collaborated on the study
with University of Michigan Professors of Ac
counting Gregory Miller and Hal White, found

that companies who used Twitter to communicate
with investors experienced an increase in the liq
uidity the demand at market value of their
stocks.
"The big takeaway is that [Twitter] is being
used as another channel to get information out,
and it seems to be effective in getting information
to a broader set of investors," Blankespoor said.
"This isn't a niche area. This is something that
firms can use in their normal investor communi
cation, in combination with other ways to disclose

information."
Blankespoor emphasized that, while other re
searchers have studied how social media can be
used to predict market returns, her team's ap
proach was "pretty unique" in focusing on the im
pact of social media in market communications.
The researchers first discussed the project in
March 2009 when Blankespoor, at the time a sec
ond-year Ph.D. student at the University of
Michigan, offered to help
Miller with research.
Once Miller, Blankespoor
and White realized a shared
interest in how firms com
municate with their in
vestors, the trio decided to
look into the impact of rela
tively new forms of commu
nication.
"We were just talking
about some of the interesting
changes that are occurring,
and the assumptions that
people make about how com
munication flows but how
technology could change
that," Miller said. "Through
those discussions, we started
thinking about how this new
way of being able to reach out
and connect with your in
vestors can really change
things."
The trio chose to focus on
Twitter because Blankespoor
said that the social media
platform "really started tak
ing off and getting a lot of at
tention," and had also re
ceived coverage in investor
relations publications.
"Our first response was,
'Twitter, really? That can be
used for investor relations?'"

Blankespoor said. "We went
and just started investigat
ing it because we wanted to
understand if this is really
something that is being used
and can be useful for firms."
The team collected data
from mid- to late 2009. Ac
cording to Miller, collecting
data from financial markets
was relatively easy, but gath
ering Twitter data was "one
of the big challenges in the
paper."
"We had to go out and
learn about the structure of
Twitter [and] how they kept
the data," he said. "Basically
we did a combination of set
ting up computer programs
to help pull the data down,
and also used hand-collection
processes where we hired
[University of Michigan] stu
dents to go collect some of
the data as [research assis
tants]."
The team presented the
first version of their paper at
colleges and universities
across the world, including
the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) and the
London Business School.
Miller said that, after re
ceiving feedback on the ini
tial paper, the team collected
more data on items such as
whether links posted on
Twitter impacted website
traffic. In the second round

of tests and analysis, the re
searchers focused on the
benefits of using Twitter for
smaller firms.
"If you're just a slightly
smaller firm, visibility issues
kick in relatively soon in mar
ket cap," Miller said. "They
can't be sure when they put
information out that it is get
ting to everyone they want it
to. What we saw was the ben
efits [from using Twitter] re
ally come in for these mid
size or smaller firms."
While Miller and Blanke
spoor said that their conclu
sions indicate that all firms
should consider using social
media websites like Twitter,
they emphasized that their
study, which will likely be
published in The Accounting
Review in January 2014, also
offers implications for in
vestors.
"They might want to get
on Twitter, too, because this
is away to lower their search
costs to get information
about firms and increase the
investment set that they can
follow," Miller said. "They
can feel more certain about
following smaller firms, and
not worry that they are not
getting information about
them."
