This is the first piece of a three-part
feature on Shannon Turley, the sports
performance coordinator entering his
seventh season with Stanford football.
Part. I focuses on the team's attitude,
performance and culture change un
der Turley's guidance.

I'm not totally dumbstruck by Shan
non Turley, but I probably should be.
The Cardinal football strength coach,
now in his seventh year in the pro
gram, has been widely credited for
his role in Stanford's rise as a football pro
gram: the whiz behind the Cardinal's grow

ing assembly line of hard-hitting lineback
ers, punishing fullbacks, and above all
gigantic offensive linemen.
Toby Gerhart graduates? Stanford wins
the Orange Bowl. Jim Harbaugh takes the
49ers job? The team doesn't miss a beat.
Andrew Luck graduates? Stanford goes
from Fiesta Bowl loss to Rose Bowl victory.
As the $l7 million, 30,000-square-foot ex
pansion to the Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter rises behind me a project at least
partially inspired by the newfound success
of the football team Turley's star seems
to be shining brighter than ever.

Stanford football strength coach Shannon Turley (above) is widely credited for being
one of the key players in the football program's rise to national prominence. Turley
arrived with Jim Harbaugh in 2007 and is now entering his seventh year on the Farm.
he has made a name for him
self outside the Farm: he is
extensively praised by the
New York Times, active in
the National Strength and
Conditioning Association (his
online tutorial on pre-work
out warm-ups sells for $29.99
on the NSC A website, if
you're interested) and even
given a shout-out by a former
player on Reddit.
At the same time, howev
er, the incongruity of the
strength coach's importance
and his visibility to those out
side of the program could not
be greater. When a TV cam
era shows the strength
coach, it will be a first.

Before the interview it
self, it was clear that Coach
Turley's reputation preceded
him; in fact, he seemed like
the archetypal strength and
conditioning coach. That im
plied a few things: toughness,
direction and discipline
and especially the latter; dur
ing Bennie Wylie's tenure as
Texas Tech's strength coach,
a common punishment for
miscreants was to run around
the Texas Tech campus hold
ing cinderblocks above their
heads.
In his office, it quickly
turned out that Shannon Tur
ley is a perfectly nice man,

certainly kind enough to in
vite me into his office for an
hour on a beautiful California
morning. Although his job
entails giving orders to men
nearly twice his size, he ex
udes an aura of reassuring
normalcy; if you took the
Stanford logos off his clothes,
he would have no problem
blending into a crowd. But he
also has muscles.
As the saying goes, coach
es who have never played
lack a certain credibility. A
former track athlete at Vir
ginia Tech, Ibrley exhibits a
certain economy of move
ment that seems to be a pre
requisite for athletic success,
although a little later he will
ruefully refer to himself as a
"no-talent never-was."
Indeed, Turley's commit
ment to efficiency is reflected
everywhere he goes. When
entering his office, one won
ders, Where did he find
space for the chair? The
room has windows on three
sides looking out onto the
weight room, and what re
mains of the walls is covered
with posters, notes, and
bookcases stuffed to over
flowing. Boxes and boxes of
mystery materials are
stacked wherever space al
lows. And while Turley
meticulously files and stacks
his paperwork, he clearly
needs another desk.
There is something
vaguely resembling a space
ship in the corner. Tbrley ex
plains that it analyzes a play

er's body composition.
However, what truly
stands out to me, even now as
I write this, is his ability to
speak. Shannon Turley has
the rare gift of never being at
a loss for words; he talks
faster than any man I have
ever met; I've spent seven or
so hours transcribing the in
terview recording onto Mi
crosoft Word and the final
product comes out to 17
pages and more than 10,000
words.
Phew.

Strength and conditioning
coaches like Ibrley occupy a
strange place in the often
byzantine hierarchy of col
lege football.
The first thing to keep in
mind: "I'm not a football
coach," Tbrley explains.
At the same time, howev
er, strength coaches are the
foundation of the football pro
gram, tasked with producing
the players that make the dif
ference between winning and
losing. From Pop Warner
youth football to the NFL,
every football coach in Amer
ica knows that, without play
ers that can compete, his
playbook means nothing. Af
ter signing Mickey Mariotti
from Florida, Ohio State
Head Coach Urban Meyer
went so far as to say in the
New York Times, "You can't
function in today's era of col
lege football without a super
star as a weight coach...
That's more important than a

coordinator or a line coach."
This importance has only
deepened in recent years. In
accordance with NCAA regu
lations, only strength coaches
are allowed to conduct condi
tioning practices during the
offseason. Scholarship limits
have forced today's thinner
and more short-handed
teams to pay more attention
to injury prevention as well.
For these reasons, strength
coaches like Turley have be
come more critical for pro
grams seeking to gain the up
per hand. Although college
football has been around
since 1869, the first paid foot
ball strength coach was Ne
braska's Boyd Epley a full
hundred years later; in 2011,
the average SEC team (ex
cluding Vanderbilt, which
doesn't report its salaries)
paid its conditioning staff ap
proximately $375,000 per
year, and Meyer is paying
Mariotti alone even more
than that.
This surge in salaries is
even more reflective of the
fact that a strength coach is
expected to set the tone of the
entire program. The condi
tioning staff has the most ac
cess to the players and there
fore the most connections
and personal influence.
"We're not around the
coaches all year round," fifth
year senior linebacker Alex
Debniak said. "We're around
Turley and his staff. So I
would really attribute a great
amount of our personality
change to him and him alone,
and obviously whoever else
works with him."
Offensive guard Andrew
Phillips, who was a freshman
during the disastrous 2006
season, explains that when
the coaching staff was
switched after 2006, changes
were immediately felt: there
were no more excuses.
"If you watch the [2006]
season, we were about five
plays away from being com
petitive in every game, and
football's a crazy game in that
those five plays can make a
difference. And in our case,
watching this team, 15,20,30
plays made a difference for a
one-win season," Phillips
said. "[When the new coach
ing staff came,] expectations
were raised. It wasn't, 'Hey, if
we have some time, let's win a
couple football games.'"
Indeed, Stanford is a case
in point: the remarkable
turnaround of the Cardinal
program from 1-11 in 2006 to

Rose Bowl champions in
2012-13 could not have oc
curred with an attitude and
cultural change from top to
bottom. I ask Turley about
this, and he points to the
posters behind him: lists of
team goals ("covenants," in
football parlance) from differ
ent years in Turley's tenure.
The first covenant is approxi
mately the size of a door.
"Look up here, in 2007,"
he explains. "We had a lot of
outcome goals. That was our
mission —to win the next
game, to have a winning
record, earn a bowl berth, win
the Pac-10 title, win a national
title those were our goals.
And then look at all those
rules. You see that? On the
field and practice and games,
these are the things we're go
ing to have to do. Off the field,
at home, at school, social set
tings, the classroom this is
how we're going to have to op
erate off the field. In life in
general, this is how we're go
ing to have to operate."
"2008. Another losing
team. See all the rules? In our
second year we're still asking
guys to believe in and buy into
Stanford football, to trust in
then* coaches and then* team
mates and the directions of
Stanford football; to approach
then* training, practice, and
games with the desire to be
great —do you think these
are conversations we have to
have with our players now?"
They aren't.

According to the unofficial
number-one rule of Stanford
conditioning, a technician is a
teammate who trains and
competes with a detailed focus
and commitment to the
process in relentless pursuit of
championship-caliber per
formance.
How do you torn a cellar
dweller, routinely mocked by
those outside of the program,
into a confidently imposing
college football powerhouse?
Culture change comes
from a lot of different places,
but often just from changing
perspective on the situation at
hand. Some are obvious: for
example, ever since Pop Warn
er (who won the 1926 National
Championship with the Cardi
nal, then the Indians) left Palo
Alto complaining about Stan
ford's academic requirements,
the Admissions Office had
been a handy scapegoat for
coaches and sports pundits
alike. Regardless of the rea
son, there was a sense of in

evitability to Stanford's foot
ball program hover around
.500, occasionally make a Rose
Bowl, be good enough to beat
Cal and nothing more and
in some players' words, that
inevitability bred a culture of
lackadaisicalness.
As Hu'ley explains, it took
time for the players to buy in
to the new staff's vision, espe
cially Tlirley's own particular
vision of the "technician" ideal.
During the first spring (in
2007), the staff literally
banned the team from saying
"I," "me," or "my." Phillips
elaborates on one of the first
times he realized that Tbrley
was truly determined to
change the attitude of Stan
ford football:
"Coach Harbaugh has just
come in [in spring 2007],
They're out on the practice
field, they're about to get into
a set of sprints, and Coach
Turley's out there in shorts
and a T-shirt, and it starts
pouring rain, absolutely out
of nowhere. Just torrentially
pouring rain. And we all start
looking at each other like, oh
gosh, it's terrible, oh no,
ivhat are we going to do,
somebody's going to tear
their groin, it's going to be
awful, we're going to be
cold."
"And Coach Turley says,
'Well, boys, sometimes it
rains. Get on the line.'"
The rest, to oversimplify,
is history.
As Stanford's players coa
lesced into a formidable unit
of mass destruction, self-dis
cipline was always at the core
of that cohesion.
"There was kind of a lack
of mental discipline and a
lack of toughness," said Deb
niak, who entered the pro
gram in Turley's first year.
"A lot of people fell off from
the side; a lot of people gave
up and quit, and [Turley]
kind of weeded us out. And
I'm proud to say that I'm
part of really one of the first
two or three classes that
came and really turned
things around."
Turley reciprocates Deb
niak's sentiment in turn.
"I've gotten to be a part of
great teams and got to know
some great people and I love
what I do, so it's not really a
job, it's not really work to me
there's nothing else I
would rather do with my
time than this."

have forced today's thinner
and more short-handed
teams to pay more attention
to injury prevention as well.
For these reasons, strength
coaches like Turley have be
come more critical for pro
grams seeking to gain the up
per hand. Although college
football has been around
since 1869, the first paid foot
ball strength coach was Ne
braska's Boyd Epley a full
hundred years later; in 2011,
the average SEC team (ex
cluding Vanderbilt, which
doesn't report its salaries)
paid its conditioning staff ap
proximately $375,000 per
year, and Meyer is paying
Mariotti alone even more
than that.
This surge in salaries is
even more reflective of the
fact that a strength coach is
expected to set the tone of the
entire program. The condi
tioning staff has the most ac
cess to the players and there
fore the most connections
and personal influence.
"We're not around the
coaches all year round," fifth
year senior linebacker Alex
Debniak said. "We're around
Turley and his staff. So I
would really attribute a great
amount of our personality
change to him and him alone,
and obviously whoever else
works with him."
Offensive guard Andrew
Phillips, who was a freshman
during the disastrous 2006
season, explains that when
the coaching staff was
switched after 2006, changes
were immediately felt: there
were no more excuses.
"If you watch the [2006]
season, we were about five
plays away from being com
petitive in every game, and
football's a crazy game in that
those five plays can make a
difference. And in our case,
watching this team, 15,20,30
plays made a difference for a
one-win season," Phillips
said. "[When the new coach
ing staff came,] expectations
were raised. It wasn't, 'Hey, if
we have some time, let's win a
couple football games.'"
Indeed, Stanford is a case
in point: the remarkable
turnaround of the Cardinal
program from 1-11 in 2006 to

Rose Bowl champions in
2012-13 could not have oc
curred with an attitude and
cultural change from top to
bottom. I ask Turley about
this, and he points to the
posters behind him: lists of
team goals ("covenants," in
football parlance) from differ
ent years in Turley's tenure.
The first covenant is approxi
mately the size of a door.
"Look up here, in 2007,"
he explains. "We had a lot of
outcome goals. That was our
mission —to win the next
game, to have a winning
record, earn a bowl berth, win
the Pac-10 title, win a national
title those were our goals.
And then look at all those
rules. You see that? On the
field and practice and games,
these are the things we're go
ing to have to do. Off the field,
at home, at school, social set
tings, the classroom this is
how we're going to have to op
erate off the field. In life in
general, this is how we're go
ing to have to operate."
"2008. Another losing
team. See all the rules? In our
second year we're still asking
guys to believe in and buy into
Stanford football, to trust in
then* coaches and then* team
mates and the directions of
Stanford football; to approach
then* training, practice, and
games with the desire to be
great —do you think these
are conversations we have to
have with our players now?"
They aren't.

According to the unofficial
number-one rule of Stanford
conditioning, a technician is a
teammate who trains and
competes with a detailed focus
and commitment to the
process in relentless pursuit of
championship-caliber per
formance.
How do you torn a cellar
dweller, routinely mocked by
those outside of the program,
into a confidently imposing
college football powerhouse?
Culture change comes
from a lot of different places,
but often just from changing
perspective on the situation at
hand. Some are obvious: for
example, ever since Pop Warn
er (who won the 1926 National
Championship with the Cardi
nal, then the Indians) left Palo
Alto complaining about Stan
ford's academic requirements,
the Admissions Office had
been a handy scapegoat for
coaches and sports pundits
alike. Regardless of the rea
son, there was a sense of in

evitability to Stanford's foot
ball program hover around
.500, occasionally make a Rose
Bowl, be good enough to beat
Cal and nothing more and
in some players' words, that
inevitability bred a culture of
lackadaisicalness.
As Hu'ley explains, it took
time for the players to buy in
to the new staff's vision, espe
cially Tlirley's own particular
vision of the "technician" ideal.
During the first spring (in
2007), the staff literally
banned the team from saying
"I," "me," or "my." Phillips
elaborates on one of the first
times he realized that Tbrley
was truly determined to
change the attitude of Stan
ford football:
"Coach Harbaugh has just
come in [in spring 2007],
They're out on the practice
field, they're about to get into
a set of sprints, and Coach
Turley's out there in shorts
and a T-shirt, and it starts
pouring rain, absolutely out
of nowhere. Just torrentially
pouring rain. And we all start
looking at each other like, oh
gosh, it's terrible, oh no,
ivhat are we going to do,
somebody's going to tear
their groin, it's going to be
awful, we're going to be
cold."
"And Coach Turley says,
'Well, boys, sometimes it
rains. Get on the line.'"
The rest, to oversimplify,
is history.
As Stanford's players coa
lesced into a formidable unit
of mass destruction, self-dis
cipline was always at the core
of that cohesion.
"There was kind of a lack
of mental discipline and a
lack of toughness," said Deb
niak, who entered the pro
gram in Turley's first year.
"A lot of people fell off from
the side; a lot of people gave
up and quit, and [Turley]
kind of weeded us out. And
I'm proud to say that I'm
part of really one of the first
two or three classes that
came and really turned
things around."
Turley reciprocates Deb
niak's sentiment in turn.
"I've gotten to be a part of
great teams and got to know
some great people and I love
what I do, so it's not really a
job, it's not really work to me
there's nothing else I
would rather do with my
time than this."

The Cardinal football strength coach,

his role in Stanford's rise as a football pro

gigantic offensive linemen.
Toby Gerhart graduates? Stanford wins

he has made a name for him
self outside the Farm: he is
extensively praised by the
New York Times, active in
the National Strength and
Conditioning Association (his
online tutorial on pre-work
out warm-ups sells for $29.99
on the NSC A website, if
you're interested) and even
given a shout-out by a former
player on Reddit.
At the same time, howev
er, the incongruity of the
strength coach's importance
and his visibility to those out
side of the program could not
be greater. When a TV cam
era shows the strength
coach, it will be a first.

Before the interview it
self, it was clear that Coach
Turley's reputation preceded
him; in fact, he seemed like
the archetypal strength and
conditioning coach. That im
plied a few things: toughness,
direction and discipline
and especially the latter; dur
ing Bennie Wylie's tenure as
Texas Tech's strength coach,
a common punishment for
miscreants was to run around
the Texas Tech campus hold
ing cinderblocks above their
heads.
In his office, it quickly
turned out that Shannon Tur
ley is a perfectly nice man,

certainly kind enough to in
vite me into his office for an
hour on a beautiful California
morning. Although his job
entails giving orders to men
nearly twice his size, he ex
udes an aura of reassuring
normalcy; if you took the
Stanford logos off his clothes,
he would have no problem
blending into a crowd. But he
also has muscles.
As the saying goes, coach
es who have never played
lack a certain credibility. A
former track athlete at Vir
ginia Tech, Ibrley exhibits a
certain economy of move
ment that seems to be a pre
requisite for athletic success,
although a little later he will
ruefully refer to himself as a
"no-talent never-was."
Indeed, Turley's commit
ment to efficiency is reflected
everywhere he goes. When
entering his office, one won
ders, Where did he find
space for the chair? The
room has windows on three
sides looking out onto the
weight room, and what re
mains of the walls is covered
with posters, notes, and
bookcases stuffed to over
flowing. Boxes and boxes of
mystery materials are
stacked wherever space al
lows. And while Turley
meticulously files and stacks
his paperwork, he clearly
needs another desk.
There is something
vaguely resembling a space
ship in the corner. Tbrley ex
plains that it analyzes a play

er's body composition.
However, what truly
stands out to me, even now as
I write this, is his ability to
speak. Shannon Turley has
the rare gift of never being at
a loss for words; he talks
faster than any man I have
ever met; I've spent seven or
so hours transcribing the in
terview recording onto Mi
crosoft Word and the final
product comes out to 17

Strength and conditioning
coaches like Ibrley occupy a
strange place in the often
byzantine hierarchy of col
lege football.
The first thing to keep in
mind: "I'm not a football
coach," Tbrley explains.
At the same time, howev
er, strength coaches are the
foundation of the football pro
gram, tasked with producing
the players that make the dif
ference between winning and
losing. From Pop Warner
youth football to the NFL,
every football coach in Amer
ica knows that, without play
ers that can compete, his
playbook means nothing. Af
ter signing Mickey Mariotti
from Florida, Ohio State
Head Coach Urban Meyer
went so far as to say in the
New York Times, "You can't
function in today's era of col
lege football without a super
star as a weight coach...
That's more important than a

coordinator or a line coach."
This importance has only
deepened in recent years. In
accordance with NCAA regu
lations, only strength coaches
are allowed to conduct condi
tioning practices during the
offseason. Scholarship limits
have forced today's thinner
and more short-handed
teams to pay more attention
to injury prevention as well.

I'm not totally dumbstruck by Shan

The Cardinal football strength coach,
now in his seventh year in the pro

his role in Stanford's rise as a football pro

gigantic offensive linemen.
Toby Gerhart graduates? Stanford wins
the Orange Bowl. Jim Harbaugh takes the
49ers job? The team doesn't miss a beat.
Andrew Luck graduates? Stanford goes
from Fiesta Bowl loss to Rose Bowl victory.

Stanford football strength coach Shannon Turley (above) is widely credited for being
one of the key players in the football program's rise to national prominence. Turley
arrived with Jim Harbaugh in 2007 and is now entering his seventh year on the Farm.
he has made a name for him
self outside the Farm: he is
extensively praised by the
New York Times, active in
the National Strength and
Conditioning Association (his
online tutorial on pre-work
out warm-ups sells for $29.99
on the NSC A website, if
you're interested) and even
given a shout-out by a former
player on Reddit.
At the same time, howev
er, the incongruity of the
strength coach's importance
and his visibility to those out
side of the program could not
be greater. When a TV cam
era shows the strength
coach, it will be a first.

Before the interview it
self, it was clear that Coach
Turley's reputation preceded
him; in fact, he seemed like
the archetypal strength and
conditioning coach. That im
plied a few things: toughness,
direction and discipline
and especially the latter; dur
ing Bennie Wylie's tenure as
Texas Tech's strength coach,
a common punishment for
miscreants was to run around
the Texas Tech campus hold
ing cinderblocks above their
heads.
In his office, it quickly
turned out that Shannon Tur
ley is a perfectly nice man,

certainly kind enough to in
vite me into his office for an
hour on a beautiful California
morning. Although his job
entails giving orders to men
nearly twice his size, he ex
udes an aura of reassuring
normalcy; if you took the
Stanford logos off his clothes,
he would have no problem
blending into a crowd. But he
also has muscles.
As the saying goes, coach
es who have never played
lack a certain credibility. A
former track athlete at Vir
ginia Tech, Ibrley exhibits a
certain economy of move
ment that seems to be a pre
requisite for athletic success,
although a little later he will
ruefully refer to himself as a
"no-talent never-was."
Indeed, Turley's commit
ment to efficiency is reflected
everywhere he goes. When
entering his office, one won
ders, Where did he find
space for the chair? The
room has windows on three
sides looking out onto the
weight room, and what re
mains of the walls is covered
with posters, notes, and
bookcases stuffed to over
flowing. Boxes and boxes of
mystery materials are
stacked wherever space al
lows. And while Turley
meticulously files and stacks
his paperwork, he clearly
needs another desk.
There is something
vaguely resembling a space
ship in the corner. Tbrley ex
plains that it analyzes a play

er's body composition.
However, what truly
stands out to me, even now as
I write this, is his ability to
speak. Shannon Turley has
the rare gift of never being at
a loss for words; he talks
faster than any man I have
ever met; I've spent seven or
so hours transcribing the in
terview recording onto Mi
crosoft Word and the final
product comes out to 17
pages and more than 10,000

Strength and conditioning
coaches like Ibrley occupy a
strange place in the often
byzantine hierarchy of col
lege football.
The first thing to keep in
mind: "I'm not a football
coach," Tbrley explains.
At the same time, howev
er, strength coaches are the
foundation of the football pro
gram, tasked with producing
the players that make the dif
ference between winning and
losing. From Pop Warner
youth football to the NFL,
every football coach in Amer
ica knows that, without play
ers that can compete, his
playbook means nothing. Af
ter signing Mickey Mariotti
from Florida, Ohio State
Head Coach Urban Meyer
went so far as to say in the
New York Times, "You can't
function in today's era of col
lege football without a super
star as a weight coach...
That's more important than a

coordinator or a line coach."
This importance has only
deepened in recent years. In
accordance with NCAA regu
lations, only strength coaches
are allowed to conduct condi
tioning practices during the
offseason. Scholarship limits
have forced today's thinner
and more short-handed
teams to pay more attention
to injury prevention as well.
For these reasons, strength
coaches like Turley have be
come more critical for pro
grams seeking to gain the up
per hand. Although college
football has been around
since 1869, the first paid foot
ball strength coach was Ne
braska's Boyd Epley a full
hundred years later; in 2011,
the average SEC team (ex
cluding Vanderbilt, which
doesn't report its salaries)
paid its conditioning staff ap
proximately $375,000 per
year, and Meyer is paying
Mariotti alone even more
than that.
This surge in salaries is
even more reflective of the
fact that a strength coach is
expected to set the tone of the
entire program. The condi
tioning staff has the most ac
cess to the players and there
fore the most connections
and personal influence.
"We're not around the
coaches all year round," fifth
year senior linebacker Alex
Debniak said. "We're around
Turley and his staff. So I
would really attribute a great
amount of our personality
change to him and him alone,
and obviously whoever else
works with him."
Offensive guard Andrew
Phillips, who was a freshman
during the disastrous 2006
season, explains that when
the coaching staff was
switched after 2006, changes
were immediately felt: there
were no more excuses.
"If you watch the [2006]
season, we were about five
plays away from being com
petitive in every game, and
football's a crazy game in that
those five plays can make a
difference. And in our case,
watching this team, 15,20,30
plays made a difference for a
one-win season," Phillips
said. "[When the new coach
ing staff came,] expectations
were raised. It wasn't, 'Hey, if
we have some time, let's win a
couple football games.'"
Indeed, Stanford is a case
in point: the remarkable
turnaround of the Cardinal
program from 1-11 in 2006 to

Rose Bowl champions in
2012-13 could not have oc
curred with an attitude and
cultural change from top to
bottom. I ask Turley about
this, and he points to the
posters behind him: lists of
team goals ("covenants," in
football parlance) from differ
ent years in Turley's tenure.
The first covenant is approxi
mately the size of a door.
"Look up here, in 2007,"
he explains. "We had a lot of
outcome goals. That was our
mission —to win the next
game, to have a winning
record, earn a bowl berth, win
the Pac-10 title, win a national
title those were our goals.
And then look at all those
rules. You see that? On the
field and practice and games,
these are the things we're go
ing to have to do. Off the field,
at home, at school, social set
tings, the classroom this is
how we're going to have to op
erate off the field. In life in
general, this is how we're go
ing to have to operate."
"2008. Another losing
team. See all the rules? In our
second year we're still asking
guys to believe in and buy into
Stanford football, to trust in
then* coaches and then* team
mates and the directions of
Stanford football; to approach
then* training, practice, and
games with the desire to be
great —do you think these
are conversations we have to
have with our players now?"
They aren't.

According to the unofficial
number-one rule of Stanford
conditioning, a technician is a
teammate who trains and
competes with a detailed focus
and commitment to the
process in relentless pursuit of
championship-caliber per
formance.
How do you torn a cellar
dweller, routinely mocked by
those outside of the program,
into a confidently imposing
college football powerhouse?
Culture change comes
from a lot of different places,
but often just from changing
perspective on the situation at
hand. Some are obvious: for
example, ever since Pop Warn
er (who won the 1926 National
Championship with the Cardi
nal, then the Indians) left Palo
Alto complaining about Stan
ford's academic requirements,
the Admissions Office had
been a handy scapegoat for
coaches and sports pundits
alike. Regardless of the rea
son, there was a sense of in

evitability to Stanford's foot
ball program hover around
.500, occasionally make a Rose
Bowl, be good enough to beat
Cal and nothing more and
in some players' words, that
inevitability bred a culture of
lackadaisicalness.
As Hu'ley explains, it took
time for the players to buy in
to the new staff's vision, espe
cially Tlirley's own particular
vision of the "technician" ideal.
During the first spring (in
2007), the staff literally
banned the team from saying
"I," "me," or "my." Phillips
elaborates on one of the first
times he realized that Tbrley
was truly determined to
change the attitude of Stan
ford football:
"Coach Harbaugh has just
come in [in spring 2007],
They're out on the practice
field, they're about to get into
a set of sprints, and Coach
Turley's out there in shorts
and a T-shirt, and it starts
pouring rain, absolutely out
of nowhere. Just torrentially
pouring rain. And we all start
looking at each other like, oh
gosh, it's terrible, oh no,
ivhat are we going to do,
somebody's going to tear
their groin, it's going to be
awful, we're going to be
cold."
"And Coach Turley says,
'Well, boys, sometimes it
rains. Get on the line.'"
The rest, to oversimplify,
is history.
As Stanford's players coa
lesced into a formidable unit
of mass destruction, self-dis
cipline was always at the core
of that cohesion.

Turley reciprocates Deb
niak's sentiment in turn.
"I've gotten to be a part of

some great people and I love
what I do, so it's not really a
job, it's not really work to me
