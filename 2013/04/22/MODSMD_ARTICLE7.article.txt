## Student designs to be featured in new Coursework 
### BAKER TILNEY 
An upcoming redesign of Coursework, Stanford's
class management platform, will feature elements de
signed by Roger Chen 'l5 and Ashley Ngu 'l6, the
winners of a competition hosted by Academic Com
puter Services (ACS) and Coursework User Experi
ence (UX) to solicit student proposals for an update of
the platform.
Elements of both Chen and Ngu's designs will be
incorporated into a renovated version of Coursework,
which will have enhanced operational features and an
upgraded user interface. Coursework staff may also
include components of the 10 other contest submis
sions in the new design.
Chen, who came in first place, won a Mac√üook Air.
Ngu received an iPad Mini for her second-place de
sign.
Sylvia Lowden, Coursework's UX manager, ex
plained that ACS and Coursework staff launched the
contest to get student input on how to address the
platform's outdated visuals.
"One thing that we didn't really have on our team
was a skilled visual designer. We're all pretty good at
interaction design but the visual part can be tricky,"
Lowden said. "We thought, 'Oh, there's a lot of really
good talent on campus. Why don't we try to tap into
that?"'
According to Lowden, the first phase of the
Coursework update will involve an upgrade to Ver
sion 2.9 of the Sakai software in June. The team ex
pects to begin making visual design modifications in
fall quarter, incorporating elements of Chen's and
Ngu's winning entries.
"It's up to [the Coursework UX team] to decide
what elements [of my design] they want to incorpo
rate or not," Chen said. "There are parts of my con
cept that might have involved significant re-architec
turing of their core system. We'll see what happens,
but I'm just throwing my ideas out there for them to
use."
Chen, who called himself a recreational designer,
said that he decided to enter the Coursework contest
one afternoon when he "didn't feel like working."
"I went on Coursework and saw that there was
this contest, and I figured that I might as well try
this," Chen said. "The PWR [Program in Writing and
Rhetoric class] that I had been taking that quarter
was on infographic design so I was picking up design
concepts, and I felt that this would be a cool way to
try out some of the stuff that I had learned."
Chen's design focused on modernizing the visuals
of Coursework's core features.
"I was looking at trends
in modern web design in re
cent years and seeing the
way design is going, and
structuring Coursework to
reflect that shift in design
thinking," Chen said.
Ngu also entered the con

test to experiment with de
sign, attempting in her entry
to bring Coursework in line
with Stanford's new word
mark. Ngu's design also fea
tured a new color palette
that she believes would make
the site more visually inter
esting.
"I wanted to make it a lot
cleaner in terms of color
choices and layout," she said.
"I think the current one
looks kind of drab and makes

you feel like you're just doing
homework. I wanted to bring
some color to it."
According to Lowden, the
UX team hopes to incorporate
at least half of the visual de
sign changes into an updated
version of Coursework by fall
quarter, with the second half
of updates to be implemented
during fall quarter.
