How I Write:
A Conversation with Clarence B. Jones
Wednesday, April 24
7:30 pm
History Corner
(Bldg. 200), Room 002
Stanford University
As the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington approaches,
we have the opportunity to talk with Clarence B. Jones, a key
speechwriter and counsel to Martin Luther King, Jr. From 1960
until King's assassination in 1968, Clarence Jones worked closely
with Reverend King, assisting him in drafting the celebrated
"I Have a Dream" speech that King delivered August 28, 1963.
He is the co-author of What Would Martin Say? Behind the Dream:
The Making of the Speech That Transformed a Nation; and Uprising
Understanding Attica, Revolution, and the Incarceration State.
Free and open to the public Jones is a writer in residence and visiting professor at the Martin
Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford.
Hilton Obenzinger, an accomplished fiction and nonfiction writer
and lecturer in the Stanford Department of English, American
Studies Program, and Stanford Continuing Studies, will engage
Clarence Jones in conversation, focusing on the techniques,
quirks, and joys of writing.
