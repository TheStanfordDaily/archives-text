# SPARTAN INVASION
## Baseball looks for season sweep of SJSU 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball squad has a lot to be
happy about going into tonight's matchup
against San Jose State.
The red-hot Cardinal has finally started to
put it all together and a resurgent offense has
recently compensated for uncharacteristically
shaky pitching performances to keep the ball
rolling. The No. 14 Cardinal (22-12, 9-6 Pac
-12), victorious in each of its last three weekday
games and its last three series against Pac-12
opponents, will look to carry that success into
its date with San Jose State (13-26, 7-8 WAC)
at Sunken Diamond.
In their previous meeting two weeks ago,
the Spartans took advantage of an ineffective
Stanford bullpen to pressure the Cardinal all
the way through the ninth inning. Although
Stanford was eventually able to squeak by San
Jose State by a score of 10-8 due to late hero
ics from the offense, the Cardinal hopes that
there will be less drama in this second and fi
nal matchup of the season against the Spar
tans.
The Stanford offense has recently roared
to life, averaging over nine runs per game over
its last 10 contests, including three games
against defending national champion Arizona.
After struggling mightily for the early goings
of the season and having to be bailed out by ef
fective pitching, it is the hitting that has res
cued the pitchers as of late.
Junior first baseman Brian Ragira, who
earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors yes
terday, has been wreaking havoc from the
three-hole in Stanford's rejuvenated lineup.
He collected seven hits in 13 at-bats in the
Cardinal's most recent series against Arizona
while driving in six runs.
The junior from Texas has hit at an impres
sive .462 clip (12-for-26) with four home runs
in the last six games, giving the Cardinal a po
tent power threat in the middle of its lineup.
The Cardinal has also been greatly boosted
by the return from injury of junior right field
er Austin Wilson, who is batting .342 and driv
ing runs in at a rate that would easily lead the
team in RBI had he played the full season. The
continued presence of the star slugger at the
heart of Stanford's lineup looks to pay divi
dends.
As the offensive firepower only gets
stronger, the strong pitching that the team re
lied on during its extended offensive slump
has become surprisingly inconsistent. The last
time these two teams met, Stanford's team
ERA was sitting at a stingy 2.60 mark. Since
then, however, the pitching staff has scuffled
significantly.
