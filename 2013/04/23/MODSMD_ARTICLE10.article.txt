# SPARTAN INVASION
## Baseball looks for season sweep of SJSU 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball squad has a lot to be
happy about going into tonight's matchup
against San Jose State.
The red-hot Cardinal has finally started to
put it all together and a resurgent offense has
recently compensated for uncharacteristically
shaky pitching performances to keep the ball
rolling. The No. 14 Cardinal (22-12, 9-6 Pac
-12), victorious in each of its last three weekday
games and its last three series against Pac-12
opponents, will look to carry that success into
its date with San Jose State (13-26, 7-8 WAC)
at Sunken Diamond.
In their previous meeting two weeks ago,
the Spartans took advantage of an ineffective
Stanford bullpen to pressure the Cardinal all
the way through the ninth inning. Although
Stanford was eventually able to squeak by San
Jose State by a score of 10-8 due to late hero
ics from the offense, the Cardinal hopes that
there will be less drama in this second and fi
nal matchup of the season against the Spar
tans.
The Stanford offense has recently roared
to life, averaging over nine runs per game over
its last 10 contests, including three games
against defending national champion Arizona.
After struggling mightily for the early goings
of the season and having to be bailed out by ef
fective pitching, it is the hitting that has res
cued the pitchers as of late.
Junior first baseman Brian Ragira, who
earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors yes
terday, has been wreaking havoc from the
three-hole in Stanford's rejuvenated lineup.
He collected seven hits in 13 at-bats in the
Cardinal's most recent series against Arizona
while driving in six runs.
The junior from Texas has hit at an impres
sive .462 clip (12-for-26) with four home runs
in the last six games, giving the Cardinal a po
tent power threat in the middle of its lineup.
The Cardinal has also been greatly boosted
by the return from injury of junior right field
er Austin Wilson, who is batting .342 and driv
ing runs in at a rate that would easily lead the
team in RBI had he played the full season. The
continued presence of the star slugger at the
heart of Stanford's lineup looks to pay divi
dends.
As the offensive firepower only gets
stronger, the strong pitching that the team re
lied on during its extended offensive slump
has become surprisingly inconsistent. The last
time these two teams met, Stanford's team
ERA was sitting at a stingy 2.60 mark. Since
then, however, the pitching staff has scuffled
significantly.

momentum going from their series win over Arizona as San Jose State comes to town.
In the seven games that
the Cardinal has played
since it last faced the Spar
tans, the Cardinal pitching
staff has given up an average
of almost six runs per game,
an alarming statistic consid
ering that three of those
games came against the low
ly Washington Huskies, who
sport an 11-26 record that is
good for last place in the
Pac-12.
Stanford's starting rota
tion was hit especially hard
in its last series against Ari
zona. Senior Dean McArdle
didn't make it out of the
fourth inning on Saturday
afternoon and was charged

with five earned runs. Soph
omore lefty John Hochstat
ter was also ineffective in the
series finale on Sunday, exit
ing in the second inning
charged with five runs, al
beit none earned.
Not even senior ace Mark
Appel had his best stuff in
his latest outing. The righty
failed to pitch seven full in
nings for the first time since
the season opener at Rice
and allowed two earned
runs. Although it was a
strong outing nonetheless, it
was a notch below what
Stanford fans has become
accustomed to seeing out of
their seasoned ace.
San Jose State hasn't ex
actly been on top of its game
since it last faced Stanford,
either. After its close loss to
the Cardinal in their last
meeting, San Jose State was

promptly swept by UT-Ar
lington in three games be
fore taking two of three from
Texas State.
The upstart Stanford of
fense should again have no
problem teeing off on Spar
tan pitching. San Jose
State's pitching staff comes
into the contest with an un
derwhelming 5.95 ERA. In
the last meeting between the
two teams, Stanford's of
fense had no trouble scoring
10 runs, and with the offense
firing on all cylinders it
would not be surprising to
see another dominant per
formance by the Cardinal
hitters.
First pitch against San
Jose State will be at 5:30
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.

As the offensive firepower only gets
stronger, the strong pitching that the team re
lied on during its extended offensive slump
has become surprisingly inconsistent. The last
time these two teams met, Stanford's team
ERA was sitting at a stingy 2.60 mark. Since
then, however, the pitching staff has scuffled
significantly.

Sophomore third baseman Alex Blandino (above) and the No. 14 Cardinal look to keep the
momentum going from their series win over Arizona as San Jose State comes to town.
In the seven games that
the Cardinal has played
since it last faced the Spar
tans, the Cardinal pitching
staff has given up an average
of almost six runs per game,
an alarming statistic consid
ering that three of those
games came against the low
ly Washington Huskies, who
sport an 11-26 record that is
good for last place in the
Pac-12.
Stanford's starting rota
tion was hit especially hard
in its last series against Ari
zona. Senior Dean McArdle
didn't make it out of the
fourth inning on Saturday
afternoon and was charged

with five earned runs. Soph
omore lefty John Hochstat
ter was also ineffective in the
series finale on Sunday, exit
ing in the second inning
charged with five runs, al
beit none earned.
Not even senior ace Mark
Appel had his best stuff in
his latest outing. The righty
failed to pitch seven full in
nings for the first time since
the season opener at Rice
and allowed two earned
runs. Although it was a
strong outing nonetheless, it
was a notch below what
Stanford fans has become
accustomed to seeing out of
their seasoned ace.
San Jose State hasn't ex
actly been on top of its game
since it last faced Stanford,
either. After its close loss to
the Cardinal in their last
meeting, San Jose State was

promptly swept by UT-Ar
lington in three games be
fore taking two of three from
Texas State.
The upstart Stanford of
fense should again have no
problem teeing off on Spar
tan pitching. San Jose
State's pitching staff comes
into the contest with an un
derwhelming 5.95 ERA. In
the last meeting between the
two teams, Stanford's of
fense had no trouble scoring
10 runs, and with the offense
firing on all cylinders it
would not be surprising to
see another dominant per
formance by the Cardinal
hitters.
First pitch against San
Jose State will be at 5:30
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
