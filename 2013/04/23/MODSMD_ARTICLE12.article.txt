early 8-4 deficit in the first set
to pull within one at 15-14 fol
lowing a kill by junior outside
hitter Brian Cook. Three con
secutive LBSU kills followed
by a block on junior outside
hitter Steven Irvin's attempt
pushed the margin between
the two teams back up to five
at 19-14, allowing the 49ers to
have the upper hand for the
remainder of the set.
The Cardinal would get
no closer than two points, and
LBSU would close out the set
on a kill by senior middle
blocker Colten Echave. Stan
ford was held to just a .133
hitting percentage for the set,
masking an errorless seven
kill performance by Cook.
Stanford's hitting im
proved to a .286 clip in the
second set, but it was no
match for LBSU's .458 per
centage. Tied at six, the 49ers
embarked on a 6-0 run
sparked by Echave, who pro
vided two kills and two blocks
during the spurt that put
LBSU back in control of the
match. Despite eight kills
by Irvin during the set, the
Cardinal would never again
pull closer than five. Junior
opposite lan Satterfield em
phatically closed out the set
with one of his team-high 12
kills to end the second set.
The third set provided
most of the fireworks for the
match, and again the Cardi
nal showed its resilience. De
spite facing a 17-12 deficit in
what would prove to be the
team's final set of the season,
Stanford rallied all the way
back to tie it at 21 after the
16th of Irvin's match-high 17
kills for the night. The teams
would trade points until a kill
by Cook gave the Cardinal its
first set point, one of the four
that it would not be able to
convert.
Kills by Satterfield erased
two of these set points, but
the Cardinal self-destructed
at a time when it simply
could not afford to do so, con
demning itself to its fate with
service errors on the other
two set points. The match
would end on an Irvin attack
error, following the last kill
by Satterfield and a kill by
junior outside hitter Dalton
Ammerman.

"I have to congratulate
Long Beach. They are a great
team who brought their A
game when they needed to,
and we didn't," said junior
middle blocker Eric Mochals
ki. "We failed to stop what
they wanted to do as well as
they stopped what we wanted
to do."
For the match, Stanford
finished with a .204 hitting
percentage to LBSU's .309.
Irvin and Cook led the Cardi
nal with 17 and 14 kills re
spectively, while Satterfield
and junior outside hitter Tay
lor Crabb led the 49ers with

12 and 11 each.
Despite the disappointing
end to the season, the Cardi
nal figures to be back in the
thick of the conference and
perhaps national title hunt
next season when it returns all
six starters and a bevy of other
contributors, plus a talented
incoming freshman class.
"The future is bright for
this team. Next year is going
to be an exciting year for
Stanford men's volleyball,"
said Mochalski.

team's final set of the season,
Stanford rallied all the way
back to tie it at 21 after the
16th of Irvin's match-high 17
kills for the night. The teams
would trade points until a kill
by Cook gave the Cardinal its
first set point, one of the four
that it would not be able to
convert.
Kills by Satterfield erased
two of these set points, but
the Cardinal self-destructed
at a time when it simply
could not afford to do so, con
demning itself to its fate with
service errors on the other
two set points. The match
would end on an Irvin attack
error, following the last kill
by Satterfield and a kill by
junior outside hitter Dalton
Ammerman.

"I have to congratulate
Long Beach. They are a great
team who brought their A
game when they needed to,
and we didn't," said junior
middle blocker Eric Mochals
ki. "We failed to stop what
they wanted to do as well as
they stopped what we wanted
to do."
For the match, Stanford
finished with a .204 hitting
percentage to LBSU's .309.
Irvin and Cook led the Cardi
nal with 17 and 14 kills re
spectively, while Satterfield
and junior outside hitter Tay
lor Crabb led the 49ers with

12 and 11 each.
Despite the disappointing
end to the season, the Cardi
nal figures to be back in the
thick of the conference and
perhaps national title hunt
next season when it returns all
six starters and a bevy of other
contributors, plus a talented
incoming freshman class.
"The future is bright for
this team. Next year is going
to be an exciting year for
Stanford men's volleyball,"
said Mochalski.
