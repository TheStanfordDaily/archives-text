## To Stanford Writers 
### Taylor Brady 
To call myself a writer would
be a gross overstatement. I'm
unpublished, and more im
portantly, I simply haven't written
something worth publishing
yet. But one reason for my inexpe
rience stems from a profound mis
conception that I allowed to over
whelm my better judgement for
three years at this university. With
that in mind, I would like to try to
spare my peers the same trouble.
The first thing, that aforemen
tioned misconception, is this: Stop
denying that you love writing. I
picked up my first book at an age so
young I can't actually recall doing
so, and I have read voraciously ever
since. No other art form captivates
me quite like the written word. I
have always known this, and I think
that every other writer here does,
too, if they have the courage to ad
mit it.
Fall quarter freshman year, I
took four classes: IHUM, Math 51,
Econ 102A, in which I pulled
straight B minuses, and a lyric po
etry class taught entirely in Span
ish, where I managed an A. Glanc
ing back at that quarter's tran
script, I have to laugh at what it
should have showed me: the blatant
conclusion that I should have stud
ied writing instead. Yet I still be
came an engineering major, and
I'm about to start an engineering
Master's program.
My second point leads partly
from the first, and it is twofold:
Don't cry over untaken courses or
unmet people. Our lives are nothing
but opportunities missed because
we chose something else. It is nev
er too late. There's a curious fasci
nation with fixed destinations
among the graduating classes each
Spring, and I think it's because we
want to cling to the comfort of a sta
ble life when any adult will guffaw
and tell you that you won't have
one.
These days, I'm grateful for the
nineteen-year-old incarnation of
myself that went into engineering
for the money. I refuse to find my
self at the kind of engineering firms
that would cash in that freshman's
investment, but a few years doing
earthquake engineering in Nepal, I
think, will lend me much more in
teresting stories to write than if I
had earned an English degree and
woke up one day realizing I worked
in advertising at Google. I believe
that the roundabout path to author
is the path for me, because in all
likelihood, I will change jobs multi
ple times during my lifetime. Why
not recognize the beauty of unan
ticipated opportunities?
Those opportunities, though,
will always remain unfulfilled if you
do not make the sacrifices neces
sary to pursue them. Stanford is
like playing a game with golden
dodgeballs. Labs, alumni, compa
nies, faculty are incessantly throw
ing incredible opportunities at you;
hell, you're even making some for
yourself. If you give in to the temp
tation to catch 'em all, you will drop
every single one.
In fact, you have to actively
dodge the ones that you don't have
time to catch. For much of last year,
I was intimately involved in run

ning an engineering project which
consistently provides its leaders
with excellent opportunities for ca
reer advancement. Come Septem
ber, though, after working on it
every day for nearly a year, I
stopped entirely. I had to make that
sacrifice for the sake of my wilt
ing. If I would not, as I have this
year, written every other day then
I would have been denying that
writing, like any other profession,
is something that you must consis
tently work at.
That's another thing. Creative
professions, and the wonderful
catharsis of inspired creative ex
pression, mislead us to believe that
you can only create art when the
mood strikes.
Wrong.
Exhausted at two in the morning
last weekend, I sat down and ham
mered out some of the best dialogue
that I have ever written. You won't
ever write good pieces by waiting
until you fancy composing them, be
cause even our best ideas take care
ful editing just to be good enough to
strike a chord with other people.
Whimsy alone is not enough to
pen a novel. It takes mechanics,
and heavy, heavy editing. An excel
lent place to start, one which I can
clearly recommend, would be wilt
ing a column for this paper. The
pressure of a weekly deadline
forces you to spend at least four or
five hours each week brainstorm
ing and writing something worth
the ink on the page or the bits on
the hard disk.
Writing is a profoundly selfless
exercise, because language is ulti
mately a tool for communication. I
relish the flaws of this university, in
particular its undergraduate cul
ture, because they present oppor
tunities like tee-balls to swing into
home-run pieces. As I mentioned
before, though, that ball will stay
on the tee if you don't step up to the
plate.
That is an untenable legacy to
leave behind. Homogeneous ideolo
gies on this campus can be like the
game Go, where pieces of one type
surround those of the opposite type
until they get to actually remove
them from the board entirely.
Writers, it is your job to ferret
out those disempowered voices,
sometimes silenced so that they are
only implied as the opposite of the
hegemonic dialectics in your com
munities, and speak for them. You
have to play a clever game just to
make yourself heard, and even
then, expect that your enemies,
"those desk-bound men and women
with their hearts in a safe deposit
box" (via the old Stegner fellow Ed
ward Abbey), will never stop fight
ing to throttle you as well.
Here's my challenge for the
week: writers, write. Drop your
homework, pick up the pen, and tell
a story. Recount your friends' joy
and their anguish, research work
ers' rights at Stanford hospital or
pen a poem testifying to the beauty
of the oak groves on your weekend
hike.

..., then send it to Taylor at
tabrady@stanford.edu. He'd love to
read it.
