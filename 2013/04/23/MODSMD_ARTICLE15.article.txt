## Considering Climate Change on Earth Day 
### SOPHIE HARRISON GRAHAM PROVOST, Fossil Free Stanford 
Earth Day is a time to cele
brate our planet and reflect
on how our personal choices
have an impact on the world around
us. However, it is also a time to rec
ognize that we need not only per
sonal responsibility, but also social
and institutional changes to address
the colossal challenges facing our
planet.
We know you've heard it before:
Climate change poses an enormous
threat not only to our natural
ecosystems but also to the quality of
life of humans around the world.
Though scientists continue to tweak
their sensitivity parameters and to
better understand the precise im
pacts of a warmer world, the
essence of our challenge is clear:
Our society must rapidly curb our
greenhouse gas emissions in order
to avoid disaster.
Earth Day has a rich history of
environmental activism. The first
Earth Day in 1970 marked the be
ginning of the modern environmen
tal movement; twenty million peo
ple in schools and communities
across the country took to the
streets to demand greater environ

mental protection. The momentum
of this new movement prompted the
creation of the Environmental Pro
tection Agency, the expansion of the
Clean Air Act and the passage of
the Endangered Species Act and
the Clean Water Act.
Today's environmental chal
lenges are more complex and more
terrifying than those of the 19705.
The scale of the threat posed by cli
mate change would have been
unimaginable to those early envi
ronmentalists 43 years ago. But
thankfully, the environmental
movement is again gaining steam.
And again, across the country and
the planet, university students are
leading the way. We are taking ac
tion to protect our future.
We are making personal changes
to reduce our carbon footprints so
as to live our lives in accordance
with our own values, but we recog
nize that this alone will not be
enough. We are demonstrating sup
port for political action on climate
change. And now, specifically, we
are looking at the moral implica
tions of Stanford's investments in
the fossil fuel industry.

I broach this subject for an obvi-
We can afford to burn only one
fifth of fossil fuel companies' exist
ing reserves if we wish to avoid in
ternationally agreed upon two-de
gree warming benchmark of cata
strophic climate change. However,
the value of these companies is de
pendent upon their entire reserves.
Their net worth is based on a mas
sive "carbon bubble," which will pop
as humanity recognizes that most of
these reserves are unburnable.
But aside from being poor in
vestment strategy, investing in fos
sil fuels is simply wrong. Given all
we know about climate change, and
given our school's founding commit
ment to "promote the public welfare
by exercising an influence on behalf
of humanity and civilization," we
must divest from companies whose
business model is based on extreme
climate change and whose massive
lobbying budget has strangled all
attempts at real government action.
Students at Stanford and more
than 300 other colleges and univer
sities are calling on our schools to
divest our endowments from fossil
fuel companies. The climate crisis
cannot be solved by divestment

sation and apologize by saying,
alone, nor can it be solved if we con
tinue to support business-as-usual
environmental destruction. Divesti
ture will help to remove the social li
cense of companies to exploit our
planet and will open the door for
meaningful dialogue and policy
progress.
We are living at a pivotal time in
Earth's history, one that our kids
will look back on in their history
books. Climate change will be a
defining issue of our generation. As
the window for meaningful action
gets smaller and smaller, we must
decide to be on the right side of his
tory. It's time for Stanford to divest
from fossil fuels. It's time for us, as
students, to keep our school's ac
tions in line with its mission. It's
time to fight for a stable climate
for our own future, for our children,
and for the lives of millions of peo
ple around the world.
