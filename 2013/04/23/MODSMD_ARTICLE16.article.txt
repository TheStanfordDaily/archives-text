# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## Manliness and Vulnerability 
### Chris Herries 
Researcher-storyteller Brene
Brown once gave a TED talk
entitled "The Power of Vul
nerability." I highly suggest you
check it out, because it definitely
changed my life.
There were a lot of ideas thrown
around, but foremost among them
was the idea that we can't be gen
uine unless we're vulnerable. In her
words, we can't "selectively numb."
We can't shut off pain, shame and
rejection without hurting our ability
to experience joy, pride and accept
ance. This twenty-minute talk
changed my life in a radical way: It
inspired me to counsel at the
Bridge, speak for SPoM panels and
be more open in my life so others
could be more open to me.

ous reason: It's not manly to open
up. A lack of emotional intelligence
is an oft-cited ill on our campus, but
I think it applies to men in particu
lar because men have fewer outlets,
resources and personal tools to
grapple with emotionally charged
issues. It is unnecessary to go into
the details of why this culture of si
lence exists; we all know that for
men, more so than women, it's dif
ficult to admit to experiencing
heartbreak or sorrow or pain.
There's little room in male culture
for vulnerability or, heaven forbid,
sensitivity.
I recently had a guy open up to
me about some serious issues he's
been dealing with, only to shut
down halfway through the conver-

"Sorry, I don't usually get this
whiny and vulnerable."
Sure, there are problems that,
when expressed, should be consid
ered whining. Men also don't whine
about trivial affairs. But the differ
ence between bitching about the lit
tle things and confronting serious
emotional situations is pretty obvi
ous. Real men do the latter and
avoid the former. Real men allow
themselves to be vulnerable from
time to time.
So what can we do to break this
cycle? Well, it's important to recog
nize that we all suffer. Some of us
suffer materially, some emotionally;
some are made to suffer by others,
and some self-inflict. We could ar
gue there are varying degrees of
suffering, but that misses the point;
different events impact people dif
ferently, and what is an inconven
ience for one person may be suffer
ing for another.
Once we recognize that we all
have demons, we can begin to be
more open about what we're going
through, if only because it'd be less
embarrassing. I think a lot of guys
have an "oh shit" moment after
they open up, because they're
afraid that no one else has that type
of problem, that the listener is judg
ing them or that they might come
off as "weak." But we're all weak,
and recognizing that is a first step
towards becoming more vulnerable.
Finally, communication and re
ciprocation are key. Men who com
municate what they experience, in
cluding the moments of vulnerabili
ty, are more emotionally intelligent,
more attuned to the needs of others
and ultimately more comfortable
with themselves.
I would encourage readers to be
come more vulnerable in their lives
and to put more of their authentic
selves out there. You'll get some let
downs, but I've found the important
people end up reciprocating. By be
ing vulnerable and authentic with
each other, we won't have to try and
numb the lows of our emotional
lives, because we'll have friends and
networks of support.
