# Best of Coachella
## 
### — Edward Ngai Jana Persky 
With Coachella 2013 hav
ing just come to an end, The Daily
sat down with Stanford students in at
tendance to get the inside scoop on celebri
ties, tent shortages, lightning machines and, of course, the music.
Best act: "Definitely Major Lazer. They interacted with the crowd a lot; at one point
they got into plastic bubbles, like gerbil balls, and just started rolling around in the crowd, •
trying to run." Brielle.Butler 'l6 - *
Cool nes bancf: "I thought [new wave band] Tonight was really g00d... it was in the
[smaller] Mojave tent but they never drop the music when you expect them to, so the an
ticipation builds. Overall it was a great concert." Pooja Pradhan 'l4
Favorite discovered band: "During Jurassic s's performance, a bunch of
DJs battled for five minutes. It was completely different than the music
I listen to. I think that's the Coachella experience, discovering
*.

a band that you never listen
to and falling in love."

Best law enforcement
run-in: "Someone who can
not be named had molly and
accidentally left through the
wrong exit. He came back
and forgot to hide it. Security
asked for it, but he said he'll
keep it and pretty much
broke into Coachella. He
jumped over barbed wire and
fields to break back in, secu
rity was chasing him and
everything." Tunmise

Most problematic hous
ing situation: "We forgot
half of our supplies and didn't
even realize until we got
there. We bought a tent, we
bought sunscreen, we bought
all these chairs —we didn't
even remember to bring the
tent. We slept in sleeping
bags on the grass." Jenna
Wisch 'l6
Best (or only) celebrity
sighting: "[My friend] poked
me and was like 'Do you think
that is [Pretty Little Liars ac
tress] Lucy Hale?' while
[Hale] was walking away. I
decided that if I didn't run up
to her and ask, I'd regret it
for a long, long time, so I kind

of ran up to her... She was so
sweet. I had my phone out
and she was like 'oh, no, the
lighting will be better this
way' so she had us turn
around." —Kierstyn Smith

Most memorable mo
ment: "James Blake was
playing a late afternoon show,
so the sun was setting and
was in his eyes the whole
time. It was hot, so security
was using those... industrial
misters to spray water and
cool people off, and the way

the sun hit the water, he was
playing under a rainbow."
Tevin Tatro 'l5
Coolest thing you saw:
"There was a huge lightning
machine you know, the
glass balls that you touch your
fingers to and lightning comes
out? It was like those, but no
glass, and huge, and so the
lightning was just shooting
out. They had a fence around
it so no one could get too
close." Trevor Freed 'l6

He jumped over barbed
wire...to break back in.
