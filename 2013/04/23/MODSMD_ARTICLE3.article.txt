# Q&A ALEXANDRA CHONG FOUNDER OF LULU APP
## 
### MOLLY VORWERCK DESK EDITOR 
In recent weeks, the mobile app Lulu has taken
Stanford by storm despite not having an official pres
ence on campus. The app allows women to anonymous
ly rate and review men on appearances, skills and per
sonality, among other categories, and has received
both plaudits and flack from users due to its controver
sial nature. The Daily sat down with Lulu founder
Alexandra Chong to talk about her road to entrepre
neurial fame and her inspiration for the app, as well as
perceptions of and misconceptions about her
app.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Tell me a little bit about
yourself. I read somewhere that you were on the
road to becoming a professional tennis player. Is
that still a dream of yours?
Alexandra Chong (AC): I grew up in Jamaica and
then went to boarding school in England and Canada,
and then landed in a boarding school in Florida, at a
tennis academy. In fact, I almost went professional as
a tennis player. I played on the Jamaican National
Team and the Jamaican World Cup Federation Team.
Then I made a decision when I was 19, almost 20, that
I was not going to pursue a professional career in ten
nis.
TSD: How did you first get involved in the startup
industry? Was that always a career goal for you?
AC: I moved to Madrid for a year preparing for law
school and later got into [the] London School of Eco
nomics to study law. [lnitially], I wanted to go back to
Jamaica and get involved in politics, because my dream
was actually it's not something that I've forgone
to get involved particularly in large-scale family plan
ning there. I believe that a big part of the socioeconom
ic breakdown in Jamaica is due in part to the break
down of the nuclear family. There's kind of a culture
now where you've got a lot of women becoming preg
nant very young, around the early years of high school.
There's a lack of parental responsibility on the [part] of
the father, and it becomes the cultural norm.
So I went to the London School of Economics to get
my degree to come back to Jamaica, but my parents
wanted me to get some more experience abroad, and I
agreed, so I stayed in London. I knew I never wanted
to be a lawyer that was never my intention so I
randomly got a job at a startup. It was an online music
licensing startup. Their vision was to streamline [a]
process [through] which commercial buyers of music
could easily find music and clear the copyright online.
I was completely fascinated by the space. I found my
own in a startup. I loved the passion to be disruptive,
to create something, and to also have this crazy vision.
I think I knew at that point that I wanted to have
my own startup, and it was really a matter of what that
was going to be ... When I left, I went into consulting to
learn a lot about process management sales, and while
I was doing that, I was toying with a couple of ideas. It
wasn't until I had the idea for Lulu
that I really felt that I could em
brace it because I could understand
it. And I really got going from
there.
TSD: How did your idea to create
Lulu get off the ground?
AC: Once I had the idea for Lu
lu, which was back a few years ago,
I had to raise money. Basically, I
was working as head of PR and
marketing for UpStream, which is
a mobile marketing company. At
the time, I was kind of using half
my salary, and I was basically
moonlighting. I would send half
my salary to an agency here in
London called Glow Labs, and
they would start building early
versions of Lulu.
I finally realized that if I don't
jump out of the plane and build my
parachute on the way down, I
wouldn't start anything because it
was too difficult to start something
and work for a company at the
same time. So finally I quit, and
my boss who was also the CEO
of my company gave me my first
SISOK. When I told him the idea,
he was like "I love it here's your
first investment," and then I raised
a bit more money, and then I raised
a million dollars. Then I hired my
first developers, and then we start
ed to work on the site.
The idea was always to build
this destination place for women
where they could communicate
with their best friends as well as
other women and kind of tap into
collective wisdom. It was really
about empowerment, and the web
site had this one particular feature
called Wiki Date where women
could review their dates and share
this information with their girl
friends and create this database of
guys.
We had a lot 0f... interest in the
product we were building, and it
was kind of coined [as] "Sex and
the City" meets Facebook. It was
very powerful, given the fact that
women are very dominant on
these social platforms, but there
are very few women who are actu
ally building these products for
other women, so it was unique in
that sense.
TSD: What did you learn from
building this product?
AC: I think what we learnt
from that is, number one, when
you're launching a social platform,
it has to have relevance for users.
So what happened to us is we got a
lot of excitement globally around
the website, but that meant that
several thousand girls would jump
on the website one day when we'd
be featured in the press in India,
and then the next day, girls from
France would hear about us on the
news, and they'd see all these Indi
an girls and boys and it would not
really have relevance [to them].
We knew that we needed to fo
cus on a targeted marketing
launch, so that's why we decided
we needed to focus on colleges in
the U.S., going school by school.
We also knew that mobile was re
ally important, and a lot of users
were like, "We needed to use this
on our phones!" [Mobile] was just
kind of a clear direction that our
target demographic young
women age 18 to 24 needed: an
on-the-go tool that they could use
to share and tap into collectivism
with their friends.
Lastly was paring down into a
product of [the] most sought-after
feature. Girls really seemed to
covet the ability to write reviews
of guys they know and share these
reviews with other girls in this
sort of girls-only private space
where they felt comfortable doing
that. We just kind of decided that
we would take that product and

build something simple, some
thing very straightforward to
build this company.
TSD: When did you officially
launch the app?
AC: We just launched, and as I
mentioned, our focus is to go into
colleges in the U.S. and go college
by college with girls in these com
munities. We started doing that
early this year when we did our
early betas at University of Flori
da and Florida State University.
We got a lot of support from the
Greek community at these
schools, and we kind of went into
our launch there.
We have slowly now decided to
go into more schools across the
U.S. We've gone into USC in Cali
fornia, University of Arizona, Uni
versity of Kentucky, and then it
spreads by word of mouth to col
leges outside of this bubble. Hope
fully we'll be at Stanford!
TSD: You've also launched an
application for guys to control
their reviews called Lulu Dude,
correct?
AC: We've had a lot of interest
from boys since launching. Actual
ly, every three people that register
to Lulu, we have at least one boy
trying to get in. Guys go to [ex
tremes] to get on Lulu they cre
ate fake female accounts on Face
book, they go at it from every an
gle. Obviously they want to know
if they're on Lulu.
We felt that it was important
that we could harness the energy
that they were throwing at the
platform, but also that they had a
place on Lulu too where they could
manage their own profiles, and if
they're not on Lulu already, they
can put themselves out there to be
discovered by girls.
On Lulu Dude, basically guys
can put their best faces forward on
Lulu, so they can change their pro
file pictures, they can add their
own personal hashtags about
themselves, they can tell a girl
what their turn-ons and turn-offs
are, they can change their rela
tionship status, and, at the same
time, we give them a hint of how
they're performing on Lulu. If a
girl does a review of them and
they score high in one of the cate
gories, they get a trophy, so it kind
of gives them a sense of how
they're doing.
We launched it in a mobile web
version, and the response has been
so good that we decided to create
an app for it, and that will be
launching soon. And certainly with
Lulu Dude, if a guy decides he
doesn't want to be on Lulu, he can
remove himself.
TSD: One question that has
come up a lot when talking with
my girl friends is whether or not
the app is derogatory towards
men. Do you think that Lulu is
ultimately a positive social ex
perience, or is it simply a means
for women to exact revenge on
guys that have wronged them?
AC: You've got to understand ...
why [Lulu] was created in the first
place. Valentine's Day, several
years ago, I had a great date and
wanted to share this experience
with my friends, but ultimately he
wasn't the guy for me, and I want
ed to share this with other people,
and there was nowhere to share
this experience. We do this in real
life, but there's nowhere on mobile
technology that allows us to really
harness this experience.
Ultimately, Lulu is controver
sial. There are people that love
Lulu, and there are people that
hate Lulu. We believe that the con
troversy is certainly an element of
our success so far. All kind of truly
successful breakout products and
services have to be sort of contro
versial or how the industry
calls them disruptive, because
the disruptive and controversial
products are what challenges us
and what pushes our boundaries.

Think back to the early years
of Facebook face match, tag
ging, poking. When these features
were launched they were very con
troversial. You know, many people
wag their tongues and talk bitter
ly about them, but they were the
things that made the company dif
ferent, made Facebook innovative.
Now tagging is completely nor
mal.
What we're doing is allowing
girls who do this anyway they
Google the guys they like and are
interested in, they Facebook
search them and we're just
kind of recreating that in a differ
ent experience. I think successful
companies must challenge the
norm and buck conventional
thinking to achieve true innova
tion.
TSD:What has been the general
response to Lulu among the col
lege campuses you've visited?
AC: So far phenomenal, actual
ly. All of the colleges campuses
that we have an active program in
... we penetrate probably about 35
to 40 percent of the female popula
tion. They join Lulu in the first
couple weeks of entering the col
lege campus, and then at least 60
percent of the guys are on Lulu af
ter we enter these communities.
So among those that speak against
Lulu, you actually see that they're
quite active users of it.
TSD: Did you intend for Lulu to
be used as a serious ratings sys
tem or more of a fun, light
hearted activity?
AC: I think we wanted to start
with something that was fun. I
think the activity is a fun activity.
But we wanted to make sure that it
was informative, that there was
enough breadth and room to be in
formative. You know, often people
that write about Lulu, they kind of
say that it is all about sex and
looks, and that's not the case. We
try to update almost daily with
hashtags that users give us.
At the same time, we still want
Lulu to be a fun place, not a vindic
tive place where people can totally
trash someone and be really hurt
ful and mean. It's still a place that's
fun, lighthearted and informative.
I think that ultimately girls don't
want to be in a place that's bitchy
and catty, and they don't want to
be in a place that's negative.
We want to make sure that we
set ourselves apart from those
websites like College ACB on
which you can ... write whatever
you want about a person and total
ly trash them publically. You can
write whatever you want. All you
can do on Lulu is create a review,
create hashtags or vote yes or no.
That's how we try to create checks
and balances. Another statistic
you should know is that over 48
percent of our reviews and
there's almost half a million now
are actually friends reviewing
other friends. A lot of girls see this
as a place where they can put their
best guy friends and give them a
great review.
TSD: What do you envision as
the future of your product?
AC: We created this as a prod
uct for women because we under
stand them and we feel as though
we're creating a destination mobile
site where women can tap into the
collective wisdom of one another.
We hope to tap into this knowledge
not just about guys, but potentially
later on about other things that
girls have in common or care
about, whether that's careers or
health or fashion. [This is] some
thing that they can tap into and
learn from each other. [The launch
of this Lulu app] is really just sort
of the beginning of our journey.
