### MOLLY VORWERCK DESK EDITOR 
In recent weeks, the mobile app Lulu has taken
Stanford by storm despite not having an official pres
ence on campus. The app allows women to anonymous
ly rate and review men on appearances, skills and per
sonality, among other categories, and has received
both plaudits and flack from users due to its controver
sial nature. The Daily sat down with Lulu founder
Alexandra Chong to talk about her road to entrepre
neurial fame and her inspiration for the app, as well as
perceptions of and misconceptions about her
app.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Tell me a little bit about
yourself. I read somewhere that you were on the
road to becoming a professional tennis player. Is
that still a dream of yours?
Alexandra Chong (AC): I grew up in Jamaica and
then went to boarding school in England and Canada,
and then landed in a boarding school in Florida, at a
tennis academy. In fact, I almost went professional as
a tennis player. I played on the Jamaican National
Team and the Jamaican World Cup Federation Team.
Then I made a decision when I was 19, almost 20, that
I was not going to pursue a professional career in ten
nis.
TSD: How did you first get involved in the startup
industry? Was that always a career goal for you?
AC: I moved to Madrid for a year preparing for law

ic breakdown in Jamaica is due in part to the break
down of the nuclear family. There's kind of a culture
now where you've got a lot of women becoming preg
nant very young, around the early years of high school.
There's a lack of parental responsibility on the [part] of
the father, and it becomes the cultural norm.
So I went to the London School of Economics to get
my degree to come back to Jamaica, but my parents
wanted me to get some more experience abroad, and I
agreed, so I stayed in London. I knew I never wanted
to be a lawyer that was never my intention so I
randomly got a job at a startup. It was an online music
licensing startup. Their vision was to streamline [a]
process [through] which commercial buyers of music
could easily find music and clear the copyright online.
I was completely fascinated by the space. I found my
own in a startup. I loved the passion to be disruptive,
to create something, and to also have this crazy vision.
I think I knew at that point that I wanted to have
my own startup, and it was really a matter of what that
was going to be ... When I left, I went into consulting to
learn a lot about process management sales, and while
I was doing that, I was toying with a couple of ideas. It
