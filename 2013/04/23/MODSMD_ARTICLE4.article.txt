## Alum wins NSF's Waterman Award 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mung Chiang 'OO M.S.'OO Ph.D.'o3, as
sistant professor of electrical engineering
at Princeton University, was recently an
nounced as this year's recipient of the Na
tional Science Foundation's Alan T. Wa
terman Award for his application of math
ematical analysis to wireless network de
sign.
Chiang will receive the award, consid
ered to be the nation's highest honor for
scientists under the age of 35, at a cere
mony on May 9 at the U.S. Department of
State. Awardees are given one million dol

lars over the course of five years to ad
vance their research.
Chiang said that he was extremely
surprised to be notified that he had won.
"I couldn't believe it because it was a
mix of all sciences, social sciences and en
gineering," Chiang said. "I have a four
year-old son, and I told him first. He did
n't have much reaction to the news."
According to Mayra Montrose, pro
gram manager for the Waterman Award,
the judging committee sought candidates
with exceptional individual achievement
in scientific or engineering research.
"[The judging criteria] is very holistic,
and they will look at the complete portfo

lio for each of the nominees," Montrose
said, noting that the judges were im
pressed by Chiang's ability to implement
his theoretical research in the network in
dustry.
Chiang, who has worked with AT&T
and other companies, said that a major
part of his research methodology is to "go
from proofs to prototypes."
"We work on mathematical and theo
retical research, but we also take what the
math predicts and build network sys
tems," Chiang said. "So we build up sys
tems guided by theories and then prove
more theorems."
Montrose said that the
committee also highly valued
Chiang's commitment to ed
ucating the next generation
of engineers and scientists.
Chiang's online courses, in
cluding "ELE 381: Net
works: Friends, Money and
Bytes," have attracted a to
tal of 65,000 students.
"He is quite impressive
as a teacher and had quite an
amazing following," said
Lisa-Joy Zgorski, media
representative for the Wa
terman Award. "These are
the fine details that distin
guish one nominee from the
other."
Chiang's research in opti
mizing wireless networks
started at Stanford under the
mentorship of the late

Thomas Cover M.S. '6l Ph.D.
'64, professor of electrical en
gineering and statistics, and
Stephen Boyd, professor of
electrical engineering.
According to Chiang, his
research with Cover and
Boyd inspired him to pursue
an undergraduate honors
thesis and a doctoral degree
in electrical engineering
(EE).
"I learned so much from
[the] EE department, espe
cially from my two advisors
about the extremely high
standard of scholarly work
that they set an example
through their own liking and
research," Chiang said. "I
have always been, since
then, trying to pursue that
bar."
Chiang described Stan
ford as a"paradise," fondly
remembering time spent
studying in the Oval, and
praised the University's en
trepreneurial atmosphere,
which he cited as a heavy in

fluence on his later work.
"[Entrepreneurship] is
something that Stanford ex
cels like no other institution
ever in history," Chiang said.
"That really drives me to
think about how to take
equations that very few can
appreciate into products that
many can use."
Chiang plans to use the
funding provided by the
award to continue research
into networks, with a focus
on improving spectrum
sharing, optimizing and de
ploying wireless mobile net
works and managing traffic
on wireless networks.
"The demand for mobile
network is projected to dou
ble every single year. That
means in 10 years, there will
be a need for 10-thousand
fold increase," Chiang said.
"We have to come up with a
solution."
