### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mung Chiang 'OO M.S.'OO Ph.D.'o3, as
sistant professor of electrical engineering
at Princeton University, was recently an
nounced as this year's recipient of the Na
tional Science Foundation's Alan T. Wa
terman Award for his application of math
ematical analysis to wireless network de
sign.
Chiang will receive the award, consid
ered to be the nation's highest honor for
scientists under the age of 35, at a cere
mony on May 9 at the U.S. Department of
State. Awardees are given one million dol

lars over the course of five years to ad
vance their research.
Chiang said that he was extremely
surprised to be notified that he had won.
"I couldn't believe it because it was a
mix of all sciences, social sciences and en
gineering," Chiang said. "I have a four
year-old son, and I told him first. He did
n't have much reaction to the news."
According to Mayra Montrose, pro
gram manager for the Waterman Award,
the judging committee sought candidates
with exceptional individual achievement
in scientific or engineering research.
"[The judging criteria] is very holistic,
and they will look at the complete portfo

lio for each of the nominees," Montrose
said, noting that the judges were im
pressed by Chiang's ability to implement
his theoretical research in the network in
dustry.
Chiang, who has worked with AT&T
and other companies, said that a major
part of his research methodology is to "go
from proofs to prototypes."
"We work on mathematical and theo
retical research, but we also take what the
math predicts and build network sys
tems," Chiang said. "So we build up sys
tems guided by theories and then prove
