### DAILY NEWS STAFF — Ileana Najarro 
Coursera— the online learning plat
form developed by Stanford computer sci
ence professors Daphne Koller Ph.D. '94
and Andrew Ng recently hosted the
first massive open online course (MOOC)
developed by an Asian university.
Over 17,000 students registered for

Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology (HKUST)'s "Science, Technol
ogy and Society in China" course, accord
ing to a report from The Chronicle of
Higher Education.
"I was astonished and overwhelmed,"
said Naubahar Sharif, an HKUST associ
ate professor who developed the course, to
The Chronicle. "This is far more than the
8,000-10,000 students we were expecting."
Coursera will host other MOOCs from
HKUST in upcoming months, including
one on Chinese history and
one titled "Science of Gas
tronomy."
The Chinese University
of Hong Kong and Japan's
Tokyo University plan to fol
low HKUST into the MOOC
market this fall, potentially
releasing courses on the Chi

nese currency's international
role and the evolution of the
universe, respectively.
Accordingly, Coursera ex
pects to launch a Chinese
language platform in August
with courses from the Na
tional Taiwan University and
the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, in an effort to
work around the language
barrier and facilitate online
interactivity.
