## Grad student develops Email Valet 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
For people swamped with emails and
looking to be more productive, Nicolas
Kokkalis, a doctoral student in the School
of Engineering, has a suggestion hire
someone else to manage that email for
them.
That outsourcing process takes the
form of Email Valet, an application pro
duced through collaboration between
Kokkalis and members of Stanford's Hu
man-Computer Interaction group, which
allows users to connect with a remote
email assistant while restricting the as
sistant's access to the user's personal in
formation.
Kokkalis said that Email Valet's cre
ation was motivated by his struggles with
"email overload" after founding Gamey
ola Inc., an online gaming platform, in
2009.
"There were a lot of people sending me
emails, and maybe I wouldn't follow up be
cause I didn't see the emails or I was doing
other things," Kokkalis said. "Someone
would send me an urgent message and I
wouldn't reply on time just because I was
focusing on something else and I wasn't
paying attention to my inbox."
After hiring a remote assistant to
manage his emails for $2OO a
month, Kokkalis said that he be
came much more productive. How
ever, he was uncomfortable with
giving his assistant access to his
username, password and all of his
emails, and created Email Valet as
a solution to these privacy issues.
"What our system tends to do is
help alleviate [user] concerns about
how they can share their inbox
with those assistants, because
without our system they have to
share their password," he said.
"The users can set their own pref
erences about what the assistants
can access."
Assistant Professor of Comput
er Science Michael Bernstein 'O6,
who helped Kokkalis develop the
application, said that Email Valet is
particularly beneficial for people
who cannot afford to hire a full
time assistant.
"The vision of Email Valet is to
take the notion of having an execu
tive or administrative assistant and
democratize it, [to] make it avail
able for many, many more people
than what was possible before,"
Bernstein said. "For the most part,
the people who we are going to be
impacting are the people who don't
have assistants."
The product is currently inte
grated with Gmail and is available
free of charge to Stanford students
and faculty as well as to anyone not
from Stanford who wants to use
the system with his or her own as
sistant.
Though many of the Stanford
users have chosen to work with one
of the assistants provided by
Email Valet, others have used the
system with their own assistants.
Kokkalis said users who already
have an assistant benefit from
Email Valet because the application
gives them more control over the
assistant's access to their email ac
count. The system only allows the
assistant to view the user's last 100
emails, and gives the user the abil
ity to block access to messages con
taining certain keywords.
Bernstein compared using
Email Valet to giving a valet a key
to park your car.
"It gives the assistant access to
parts of your email but they can't

go and do everything with it," he
said. "They can read it, they can
mark tasks, but they can't reply,
they can't delete, they can't search
your old emails, that kind of thing."
The system also monitors all ac
tions taken by the assistant, which
are recorded in log form and made
available to users.
Kokkalis and Stanford's HCI
group conducted a one-week ex
periment on the effectiveness of
EmailYalet with 28 participants
from Stanford. Each participant
rotated through three conditions:
managing their email normally, ex
tracting tasks themselves and al
lowing an Email Valet assistant to
extract tasks for them.
At the end of the study, the re
searchers found that participants
completed twice as many of their
tasks when helped by a remote as
sistant compared to normal email
usage. Self-extraction of tasks, the
second condition, resulted in al
most no improvement in productiv
ity.
Though 18 of the participants
initially felt uncomfortable with a
remote assistant reading their
emails, 10 of these participants re
ported feeling more comfortable
after continued use of Email Valet.
"Over time, with people who
were concerned about privacy, they
became more and more relaxed
about it. They enjoyed using the
assistant," Kokkalis said, referenc
ing one participant who initially
blocked access to emails from her
boyfriend but eventually changed
the setting to allow the assistant to
see those emails as well.
According to Kokkalis, Email-
Valet's user base has grown to
thousands after the service was
featured on NBC Bay Area and in
several other media outlets.
Kokkalis said that he plans to
take the service to "the next level"
and potentially transform it into a
full-fledged business. He said de
veloping a company around Email-
Valet would be a possibility if "the
right people get together."
"We are looking for other stu
dents or students who are graduat
ing who want to help take this to
the next level and work on it or
start a company with it," Kokkalis
said. "If students are interested,
then great. We can help them join
the team."
