## No hiding from soccer team's woes 
### Tom Taylor 
It's that time of year when I can
escape this no longer. The col
lege football season is long past
even Spring Game can't
make that not true and the
end of the Madness was sealed two
weeks back. With American pro sports
failing to really capture this fan's hopes
and dreams, and —in spite of a half
hearted attempt to pretend otherwise
—my empty, loveless relationship with
baseball, I can't keep deceiving myself
This year, the feeling's worse too.
As the clock begins to run out on my
time as a PhD student, the realities of
my situation are becoming harshly
clear. Once I get that diploma in my
hands, this home won't be home any
more. I might appear to fit in out here
at least until my accent gives it all
away—but my visa says otherwise.
Given the choice, I'm not sure whether
I would stay in the US, but I'm not
given that choice.
Pretty soon I'll likely be on a
plane back to England. Back to the
rain, the cold, the infamous food.
And back to the soccer.
Now don't get me wrong. I love
soccer. It is the greatest sport on the
face of the Earth, no question. But it
is also the one sport that can rip my
heart to shreds. Something it does
on a far too regular basis.
Here I've been able to escape for
a little while the torture of all this.
When things go well the homesick
ness kicks in and I spend many an
hour trawling the web for news and
commenting on Reading FC's latest
successes. But when things go badly
I can hide. I can't distract myself
with football or basketball, or even
my PhD. I can't go outside, too, with
out the fear of meeting someone who
might remind me of the pain, or,
worse, catching a glimpse of the lat
est failure on a TV or in a newspaper
And, in case you hadn't quite re
alized, things aren't going well.
Just a year ago Reading surged
up from near the bottom of the
Championship table to win the divi
sion and earn promotion to the Pre
mier League. We had also been ac
quired by a consortium that included
a Russian billionaire, offering the
chance of serious investment in the
club for the first time in many years.
And the new owners had thrown their
support behind the coach, hinting at
the sort of stability that is essential for
any club to succeed long term.
Now, all that optimism has been
crushed into the dirt. Reading are
now dead last at the foot of the table,
10 points from safety, with a goal dif
ference of -28 and just four games
remaining. However much I might
want to believe, there is no way we
can scrape enough points from the
total of 12 available to escape the
drop. Worse, the manager who took
us up a year ago, and perhaps the
only man with the slightest hope of
keeping us there, was sacked in mid-
March. Reading are clearly going
down.
What's next, I don't know. The
Championship is no easy league to
escape from, and even with Premier
ship money, clubs can sink like
stones. Blackburn Rovers, Premier
League champions in 1994-95 and a
top-flight club less than 12 months
ago are in danger of not even being a
Championship team next year. The
leagues further below are littered
with the carcasses of former big
teams.
Perhaps I should look on the
bright side and be grateful. Grateful
that I have one less distraction from
what I should be doing right now:
writing my thesis, and then finally
joining the real world.
But the real world is just far too
scary a place to contemplate why
else would I have been in school so
long? and all those years as a stu
dent have taught me one thing and
one thing only: Why do now what
you could get done in a coffee-pow
ered all-nighter hours before the
deadline?
Instead, searching for solace
away from my studies and away
from heartbreak, and trying some
how to fill that soccer void in my life,
I signed up for IM soccer. I hit two
goals past our first opponents a
week ago, but our most recent game
ended in a 4-0 defeat.
As much as I might be trying to es
cape, it seems that the harsh realities
of life and soccer are coming for me.

Tom Taylor's teammates don't have
the heart to tell him that his two
goals went in the wrong net, If you
