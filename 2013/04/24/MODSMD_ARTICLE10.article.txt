# Card knocks SJSU out of the park
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
When San Jose State and Stan
ford last met on a baseball field
two weeks ago, the boys from the
Farm jumped out to an early lead
but were unable to hold on to it,
sweating out a late scare by a
resurgent Spartan offense to
scrape out a victory.

In the early goings of last
night's game at Sunken Diamond,
it was deja vu as the Cardinal
leaped out to a huge lead early.
However, the counterattack from
the Spartan offense never came
this time.

Things got ugly very quickly as
the relentless Stanford team (23-
12,9-6 Pac-12) never stopped piling
runs on the board in its most lop
sided victory of the season, claim
ing an easy win over San Jose State
(13-27, 9-13 WAC) by a score of 17-
2.

In the top of the first inning, the
Spartans rolled out of the gate and
plated a run without recording an
out as senior leadoff hitter Michael
Gerlach doubled down the left field
line before being promptly plated
by sophomore center fielder Andre
Mercurio's soft single into right.
Freshman righty Bobby Zarubin,
Stanford's starter, quickly bore

down by striking out the side to
end the threat.
Spartan junior starter Daniel
Chavez, Zarubin's counterpart,
came into the game with an un
sightly 10.04 ERA. Unfortunately
for the junior, his miserable season
only got worse as the Cardinal hit
ters roared back in the bottom of
the first.
Chavez allowed all five runners
he faced to reach base and allowed

three runs before exiting with run
ners on the corners without having
recorded an out. He was ultimately
charged with five earned runs as
the Cardinal exploded for nine
runs in the first inning, highlighted
by a mammoth grand slam to right
field off the bat of senior first base
man Justin Ringo.
The Cardinal offense chugged
on relentlessly as the sun went
down over Sunken Diamond, with

contributions coming from every
spot of the lineup. Sophomore right
fielder Austin Slater and sopho
more third baseman Alex Blandino
were the only members of Stan
ford's starting lineup who failed to
drive in runs on this record-setting
night.
