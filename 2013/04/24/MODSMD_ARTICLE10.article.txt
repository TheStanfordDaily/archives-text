# Card knocks SJSU out of the park
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
When San Jose State and Stan
ford last met on a baseball field
two weeks ago, the boys from the
Farm jumped out to an early lead
but were unable to hold on to it,
sweating out a late scare by a
resurgent Spartan offense to
scrape out a victory.

In the early goings of last
night's game at Sunken Diamond,
it was deja vu as the Cardinal
leaped out to a huge lead early.
However, the counterattack from
the Spartan offense never came
this time.

Things got ugly very quickly as
the relentless Stanford team (23-
12,9-6 Pac-12) never stopped piling
runs on the board in its most lop
sided victory of the season, claim
ing an easy win over San Jose State
(13-27, 9-13 WAC) by a score of 17-
2.

In the top of the first inning, the
Spartans rolled out of the gate and
plated a run without recording an
out as senior leadoff hitter Michael
Gerlach doubled down the left field
line before being promptly plated
by sophomore center fielder Andre
Mercurio's soft single into right.
Freshman righty Bobby Zarubin,
Stanford's starter, quickly bore

down by striking out the side to
end the threat.
Spartan junior starter Daniel
Chavez, Zarubin's counterpart,
came into the game with an un
sightly 10.04 ERA. Unfortunately
for the junior, his miserable season
only got worse as the Cardinal hit
ters roared back in the bottom of
the first.
Chavez allowed all five runners
he faced to reach base and allowed

three runs before exiting with run
ners on the corners without having
recorded an out. He was ultimately
charged with five earned runs as
the Cardinal exploded for nine
runs in the first inning, highlighted
by a mammoth grand slam to right
field off the bat of senior first base
man Justin Ringo.
The Cardinal offense chugged
on relentlessly as the sun went
down over Sunken Diamond, with

contributions coming from every
spot of the lineup. Sophomore right
fielder Austin Slater and sopho
more third baseman Alex Blandino
were the only members of Stan
ford's starting lineup who failed to
drive in runs on this record-setting
night.

Stanford senior first baseman Justin Ringo (above) had a career night yesterday against San Jose State.
Going 2-for-5 at the plate, he hit a pair of tremendous home runs into right field, finished with five RBI
and three runs of his own in the Cardinal's 17-2 demolition of the Spartans at Sunken Diamond.
of late, continued his torrid
hitting with a 4-for-6 night in
which he homered to left and
also drove in three runs.

"We've been swinging it
well, man," said Ragira after
the game. "We've been put
ting up runs. We put up 10
against Arizona on Saturday,
12 the next day, and putting
up 17 today, we're just feed
ing off of each other in the
lineup and swinging the bat
well, so we'll be keeping it
going."
Ringo also had a career
night, as the senior went 2-
for-5 at the plate with two
tremendous home runs into
right field, finishing with five
RBI and three runs scored.
Junior center fielder Austin
Wilson also finished with a
loaded stat line, going 4-for
-4 while scoring four runs and
driving in three, all of which
came via two towering
moonshots over the left field
fence.

Although easily over
looked in a lopsided game
such as this one, Zarubin's
five uneventful innings on
the mound were incredibly
significant for a Stanford
pitching staff that had been
depleted in last weekend's
series against Arizona. The
freshman infielder-turned
pitcher settled down after
the first inning and struck
out seven Spartans while on

ly allowing one earned run
and walking none.
"For the most part, Bob
by's been throwing really
well this year," said Ragira.
"He has great stuff. When
ever he's in the zone, he's re
ally tough to hit. It was good
seeing Bobby throw well and
to see some other guys who
haven't gotten so many in
nings come in and throw well
also."

After the game got out of
hand in a hurry, several Car
dinal players that had not
been seeing regular playing
time came in to seal the vic
tory. Sophomore lefty
Spenser Linney made his
first appearance after re
turning from an extended in
jury and recorded a 1-2-3 in
ning. Tall sophomore righty
Jordan Kutzer made his
Stanford debut in the ninth
inning, shutting down both
hitters he faced before being
lifted in favor of sophomore
David Schmidt. Finally, out
fielder and two-sport athlete
Zach Hoffpauir, a freshman
out of Glendale, Ariz., record
ed his first hit in Cardinal
and White in the eighth, a
double into left-center.
The Cardinal will face
one of its toughest Pac-12
opponents when the team
travels to Oregon for a
three-game series this week
end. Stanford will hope to
maintain its recent offensive
success through those con
tests.
