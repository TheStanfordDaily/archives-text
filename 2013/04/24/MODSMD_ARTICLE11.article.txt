## Saint Sandberg 
### Uttara Sivaram 
Last week, my Mend Laine told
me that she had the distinct
pleasure of nearly getting
knocked off her bike when Sheryl
Sandberg prematurely opened the
door of her large black Escalade.
Thankfully, she swerved quickly and
made it to class unharmed.

"Well, this time," I told Laine,
"I'm glad you didn't lean in."
As a disclaimer, that may be the
funniest one-liner you'll find in this
article. But Laine sure didn't appreci
ate it; in fact, she's a huge Sheryl
Sandberg fan and almost regretted
swerving out of the way. This is not to
say that I don't like Ms. Sandberg
as an intelligent, beautiful female stu
dent with big dreams, I should be at
every book signing, conference, Q&A,
Japanese tea ceremony that Sand
berg hosts.
But in reality, the most I've done is
read "Lean In," since it was a gift
from my uncle and I had quickly
found out that reading "Game of
Thrones" wasn't nearly as fun as
watching the TV series.
To be sure, "Lean In" was inter
esting, and at times, informative. But
on the whole, it was relatively unin
spiring. I felt that the book could have
been more aptly titled "Common
Sense for the Average Business
woman, Plus 10 Bonus Tips for How
to Keep Your Hydrangeas Healthy
While Taking Care of a Kid in the
Middle of Your Hong Kong Business
Trip." In other words, it seemed like a
glorified instruction booklet for ambi
tious businesswomen and not the
"Feminist Manifesto" that the media
likes to glorify.
Let me be clear, there's nothing
wrong with this kind of literature. But
it's always a little dangerous to use a
personal success story as the basis for
an entire movement. This tension was
made very apparent two years ago,
when Amy Chua published her "Bat
tle Hymn of the Tiger Mother," even
tually excerpted by the Wall Street
Journal. I remember that, for a few
weeks, it was a huge phenomenon,
sparking furious debates via online
forums, blog posts and more. Even
my parents started looking at me a
little suspiciously, wondering how I
would've turned out had they been a
little more feline in their parenting
methods (my mom started growling
when it came to going out at night
thanks for that, Ms. Chua). I greatly
appreciated what Chua had brought
to the table, but I found her general
ization of Western vs. Eastern par
enting to be surprisingly unscientific
uncharacteristic of a Yale law pro
fessor.

Sandberg makes similarly sweep
ing generalizations her tendency

to conflate female empowerment with
ducking through loopholes in the cor
porate system seems inconsistent. In
one chapter, Sandberg emphasizes, in
ringing rhetoric, the necessity of
equality in the workplace. But in the
next, she elaborates upon the cart
wheels women must perform in order
to navigate through an antiquated
corporate environment as nothing
more than smart strategy. In other
words, she vacillates between (1) de
nouncing social inequity and (2) ma
nipulating the same social inequity to
one's advantage.
Sandberg made this dilemma
the tension between ideological
equality and social reality clear in
the body of the book. But publicly, she
chooses the ideological banner and, as
a result, is hailed as an exemplar for
all women that is, one with a book
promotion deal and a convenient per
sonal spot in Eacebook's parking lot.
Without a doubt, Sandberg is a
highly qualified example for so many
inspired young women, and Amy
Chua's Harvard-bound children have
work ethics that should be admired.
Neither woman has any obligation to
the world at large, and oftentimes, it's
necessary to break up social issues in
to more manageable strataâ€”West
ern parents, young women in busi
ness, etc.

But over-extending personal anec
dotes is a poor way of introducing a
general idea or assertion. They be
come inconsistent, and soon, the idea
itself is defined by its exceptions
many of which contributed to the
slow decline of the "Tiger Mother"
piece.

Sandberg has earned her fair
share of criticism as well. But she and
her message have proven to be more
resilient that I had expected, and I
see the effects of her work here at
Stanford, whether it's for the upcom
ing Q&A with the woman herself or a
campus organization with Sandberg's
name stamped on its latest event.
If I sound overly critical, I don't
mean to be. I'm just wary about the
influence that powerful and success
fill women wield in today's (much
needed) feminist movement. The way
I see it, these women have the poten
tial to do a lot of good for the women
making 70 cents on the dollar, the
women who are fired due to age or
pregnancy, the women who struggle
to receive adequate compensation for
maternity leave. The experience that
women like Sandberg have can be of
great use. But no single experience
should be chopped, sliced, diced into a
memoir and sold as a manifesto.
