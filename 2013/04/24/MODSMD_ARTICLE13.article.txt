# OP-ED
## As We Start A New Year of Taxes 
### MATTHEW KAHANE, BS '12 MS '13 
I am sure many have seen the vi
ral (and apocryphal) story cir
culating on the internet about
the economics professor who
demonstrates the flaws of liberal
"socialism" by averaging his stu
dents' test grades.
The gist is this: the professor
had a class that insisted that "Oba
ma's socialism worked." The profes
sor decided to do an "experiment"
in which the test grades in his class
would be averaged and everyone
would receive the same grade. The
test scores steadily declined, and
everyone failed because the incen
tive to work hard was taken away.
This fable seems logical enough. In
deed I think it would prove true in
many classrooms.
I would like to respond to this
story and highlight its flaws as a
model for society and taxation. I
will not respond to the fact that
completely averaging grades is far
too extreme a model for even the
most hardcore liberal. Anyone who
thinks liberal Americans are propo
nents of such a system should not
continue reading. They will not be
convinced anyway. Rather, I will
propose a slightly less inaccurate
situation modeling the classroom as
society and grades as money.
A calculus professor walks into
his class on the first day of school.
He decides, before beginning his
lectures, to ask about everybody's
background in mathematics. By a

show of hands, many of the students
are in the right place. They just fin
ished trigonometry the semester
before and are ready to go. Some,
though, do not have this back
ground. Some are math Ph.D. stu
dents and could do this class in their
sleep. Even worse, a good portion of
the class is very far behind. They
are three or four semesters away
from studying anything on this lev
el. Unfortunately, though, they can
not drop the class. It is the only
class offered, and they have to play
the hand they are dealt.

As the first lectures and tests
roll by, this stratification does not
work itself out. Even the students
on track struggle to learn the mate
rial. Some do all right, and some do
not. The math Ph.D. students ace
every test. No matter how many
hours the inexperienced students
put in, though, they are simply un
able to learn calculus. After all, how
can you integrate a sine function if
you don't know what a sine function
is? As long as the less experienced
students have to compete with the
more experienced students, they
stand little chance of passing.
The professor needs a plan to
help the failing students catch up. I
would like to emphasize that grades
are an extremely poor model for
money. Giving people free grade
boosts does not help them to suc
ceed, but getting people above the
poverty line absolutely helps them

succeed. So I will try to make a tax
ation metaphor that is slightly less
flawed:
The university decides to start a
remedial math class. With some
tongue in cheek, let us call it the
middle [math] class. Unfortunately,
you cannot simply enroll in the mid
dle [math] class. You must have a
certain grade in calculus to get in.
Thus the more advanced stu
dents in calculus are asked to give
some of their points on each test to
ward the less experienced students
such that they may try to enroll in
the remedial class. They are also
encouraged to volunteer at the tu
toring center (though most do not).
The Ph.D. students lose these
points but remain at the same letter
grade.
How unfair that a math genius
should have to give some points to
all those lazy freeloaders who never
got the chance to learn algebra!
Again, these points are not just to
boost the grade: They are there to
help students get into the middle
[math] class.
So as we start a new year of tax
es, remember that the system is not
in place to make you poor. It is not
in place to keep Vonnegut's Harri
son Bergeron from dancing. It is
not in place to make everyone
equal. It is there to make sure we all
get a chance to learn math.
