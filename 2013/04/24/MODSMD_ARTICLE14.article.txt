## Kenney wins CSCAA Lifetime Achievement Award 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
Skip Kenney, who retired last May after
33 years at the helm of the Stanford men's
swimming program, won the College Swim
ming Coaches Association of America
(CSCAA) Speedo Lifetime Achievement
Award this week.
The award is conferred to "the individual
whose efforts exemplify the integrity and
ideals of collegiate swimming and who has
achieved significant success in the sport while
still imparting the educational and character
building qualities of the collegiate swimming
experience."
With the Cardinal, Kenney coached 31
consecutive Pac-10/12 championship teams
and won seven NCAA team titles, becoming
known as one of the top swimming coaches in
the country. Kenney, 20-time Pae-10 Coach of
the Year and six-time NCAA Coach of the
Year, also coached the U.S. Olympic Team
three times over the course of his prestigious
career. Despite the fact that he never swam
competitively, Kenney is currently in both the
International Swimming Hall of Fame and
the American Swim Coaches Hall of Fame.
