# A1 Gore blasts 'hacked' politics
## Former VP warns of climate, democracy crises 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
Former Vice President A1 Gore
pulled no punches in a 45-minute
speech in Memorial Auditorium on
Tuesday evening, calling on students
to "change the conversation" around
climate change and reclaim a democ
racy that has been "hacked" by the
wealthy and special interests.
"Change often comes quickly,
when consciousness changes," Gore
said, referencing shifts in public opin
ion on issues like civil rights, gay mar
riage and even technological ad
vances. "We have to become conscious
of the fact that our home is in pro
found danger... We are destroying the
climate balance and destroying the
ecological integrity of the earth."
The sold-out speech was the first

annual Stephen Schneider Memorial
Lecture, named after the late Stan
ford biology professor who, as part of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli
mate Change, was named co-winner
with Gore â€”of the 2007 Nobel
Peace Prize.

Schneider, who passed away unex
pectedly in 2010, was featured in a
video before Gore's speech. The two
touched on similar issues, especially
Schneider's principal cause in his later
life: the better communication of sci
entific information for policy change.
"This is not just an academic exer
cise, this is something we need to have
people deeply engaged in," Schneider
said in a speech delivered to Climate
One, an environmental advocacy
group. "We've got to take back the air

Former Vice President AI Gore spoke before a sold-out audience at Memorial Auditorium on Tuesday
evening for the first annual Stephen Schneider Memorial Lecture. Addressing a lack of climate change
leadership, he took aim at special interest groups that have "hacked" American democracy.
waves in some way and make sure
that what we're hearing is credible."
Gore spent some time discussing
the planet's current climate situa
tion but reserved most of his wrath
for special interest groups, which he
argued contaminate the news media
and paralyze the political system.
"What if I told you that after [the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks], we
sought revenge by sending hun
dreds of thousands of soldiers to oc
cupy a country that had nothing to
do with the attack?" he asked to ap
plause. "A country that just happens
to have a lot of oil?"
Speaking without notes and pac
ing across the stage, Gore elaborated.
"I know [lraq] is a lot more com
plicated than that, but it's really
not," he said.
In tracing the causes behind
Congress' failure to tackle climate
change, Gore pointed the finger
squarely at corporations and inter
est groups.
"Corporations are increasingly
demanding of quid pro quos," he
said. "The average congressman
spends an average of five hours a
day on the phone and at cocktail
parties begging rich people and cor
porations for money."
Gore used a number of current
events to argue his case, referencing
Congress's recent failure to pass a
bill legislating background checks
on gun purchases despite polls
showing an overwhelming majority
of Americans as supportive.
On current environmental issues
facing the United States, Gore was
dismissive of much of the discourse
suiTounding perceived solutions.
"The tar sands? Please," he

scoffed. "When I was in Alberta a
few years ago, I was asked...
'Should we use [the tar sands]?' And
I said, 'Well, junkies use veins in
their toes when the ones in their
arms and legs give out.'"
Even more detrimental, accord
ing to Gore, is the manipulation of
the media by businesses.

"The airwaves are filled with ads
for 'clean coal' and Exxon Mobil
'solving it,' whatever 'it' is," he said.
"When you see those ads to clean

coal, they're not designed to get you
to turn to your dormmate and say,
'Lets go down to the store and get
some clean coal.' They're designed
to condition political thinking."

As he neared the end of his
speech, Gore raised his voice in de
manding more of Americans.
"Our democracy is in such pa
thetic disrepair that not a single re
form [has been enacted]," he said.
"Where is our pride? As Americans
who believe in the majesty and in

tegrity of democracy, it is time for us
to stand up and restore it."
Though his speech offered ex
tensive criticisms of the political
process, the media and con
sumerism, Gore concluded with a
story suggesting that much can be
changed in a short period of time.
Referring to the famous space
challenge that President John F.
Kennedy issued in 1962, he noted
that many thought such a goal
would be impossible to attain. When

American astronauts landed on the
moon in 1969, however, a cheer rose
from the systems engineers in
Houston, whose average age was 26.
When Kennedy had issued the chal
lenge, they were just 18 years old.
"You have a challenge," Gore
said to finish his speech. "I hope that
you will decide to be a part of it. We
need you."
