## Cancer activist aims for Olympics 
### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Even among the academically talented
students of Stanford's Online High School
(OHS), 14-year-old Winter Vinecki can list
some unusual accomplishments.
Alongside running her own nonprofit or
ganization, called "Team Winter," Vinecki is
in training to become an Olympic skier and
may soon be the youngest person to run a
marathon on all seven continents. She be

came the youngest runner to complete the
Antarctic Marathon last month, finishing in
four hours and 49 minutes, and hopes to com
plete her quest of running marathons on
every continent by November.
Team Winter
Vinecki started running marathons and
triathlons at age five. At eight years old,
she was the top fundraiser for the Iron
Girl marathon, at which she competed for
the cause of obesity prevention. Vinecki's

father was diagnosed
with prostate cancer a
year after the Iron Girl

race, and he died 10 months later.
"It was the last triathlon he ever saw me
compete in," Vinecki said. "When he passed
away, I knew I could do an Olympic distance,
even though people said I couldn't. The
biggest challenge was getting people to allow
me into races."


Winter Vinecki
Vinecki is now a two-time
Iron Kids triathlon national champi
on and has raised over $400,000 for
prostate cancer research through
"Team Winter," a nonprofit devoted
to raising awareness about prostate
cancer that she founded in 2008.

"One in six men get prostate can
cer, more than the one in eight
women with breast cancer," Vinecki
said. "But people never want to talk
about it, so they need a 14 year old to
do it for them."

Aerial skiing
Although Vinecki has garnered
attention for her running times and
fundraising ability, she is also a gift
ed aerial skier with hopes of qualify
ing for the 2018 Winter Olympics in
ski jumping.

Vinecki was invited to an
Olympic aerial skiing recruitment
camp last year by Emily Cook, a
member of the U.S. national team.
She recently became the youngest
member of Fly Elite, an aerial ski
ing Olympic development team, and
qualified for the 2013 Junior World
Championships for aerial skiing in
Italy.
Vinecki lives with a host family in
Park City, Utah, and trains eight
hours a day at the Utah Olympic
Park. However, she said that she
stays connected with her mother
and three brothers, who live in Ore
gon.
"My mom and my brothers are
my biggest supporters," Vinecki
said. "The team wouldn't be possible
without mom. She helps with every
aspect of it and runs all my races
with me."
Participation in OHS
Vinecki enrolled at OHS two
years ago, becoming too busy to go
to public school but not wanting to
"give up the social aspect of school"
by homeschooling. OHS allows stu
dents to communicate through chat
rooms and microphones and also

hosts social events.
The flexibility of going to school
online has allowed Vinecki to take
courses while traveling around the
world running races, raising funds
for her foundation and giving moti
vational speeches at schools.
"It has been so amazing and chal
lenging at the same time," Vinecki
said. "I never thought I'd be doing
college work in ninth grade, able to
work while traveling and able to
stay in touch with friends who are in
Germany, Singapore and all over the
U.S."

However, Vinecki admitted that
it's been "tough" balancing her ath
letic career with running "Team
Winter" and taking classes.
"It's definitely really challenging
sometimes," Vinecki said. "I have to
make a lot of sacrifices, but I know if
I save one life it will make it all
worth it."

Though Vinecki may sometimes
struggle to juggle a busy schedule,
her teachers credited her ability to
focus on schoolwork.

"Winter participates a lot in class
and is very gregarious. She is an in
credibly energetic person," said
Jenny Nadaner, Vinecki's Spanish
teacher. "She makes a point of con
necting to class even if she's at the
airport she is really remarkable."

Nadaner said that Vinecki has
one of the highest grades in the class
and is always "very active" in com
ing to extra classes and scheduling
Skype meetings to review assign
ments.

Adam Rzepka, Vinecki's English
teacher, echoed Nadaner's senti
ments, describing Vinecki as "a won
derful student with a tremendous
amount of energy."
"We just had a service day for
OHS, and she presented there,"
Rzepka said. "She did great and is
an amazing student."
Though Vinecki still has several
years left at OHS, she has already
set her sights on one college in par
ticular.

"Stanford University is definite
ly my ultimate goal," Vinecki said.
