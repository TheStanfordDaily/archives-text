## Cancer activist aims for Olympics 
### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Even among the academically talented
students of Stanford's Online High School
(OHS), 14-year-old Winter Vinecki can list
some unusual accomplishments.
Alongside running her own nonprofit or
ganization, called "Team Winter," Vinecki is
in training to become an Olympic skier and
may soon be the youngest person to run a
marathon on all seven continents. She be

came the youngest runner to complete the
Antarctic Marathon last month, finishing in
four hours and 49 minutes, and hopes to com
plete her quest of running marathons on
every continent by November.
Team Winter
Vinecki started running marathons and
triathlons at age five. At eight years old,
she was the top fundraiser for the Iron
Girl marathon, at which she competed for
the cause of obesity prevention. Vinecki's

father was diagnosed
with prostate cancer a
year after the Iron Girl

race, and he died 10 months later.
"It was the last triathlon he ever saw me
compete in," Vinecki said. "When he passed
away, I knew I could do an Olympic distance,
even though people said I couldn't. The
biggest challenge was getting people to allow
me into races."
