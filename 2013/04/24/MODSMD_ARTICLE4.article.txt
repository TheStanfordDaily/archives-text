## Senators hold last meeting Routine budget business for the 2013-14 year passed 
### LUCY SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate passed the ASSU's 2013-14 Oper
ating Budget in its last full meeting
of the year before the transition to
the 15th Undergraduate Senate.
The budget includes several no
table changes from last year, includ
ing the allocation of an additional
$5,000 to the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) general discretionary
fund, $2,000 to the Senate's general
discretionary fund and $l,OOO to Sen
ate committee discretionary funds.
Changes were also made to the
ASSU Executive's portion of the
budget, with $3,000 transferred from
discretionary funds to stipends for
the salaries of Executive cabinet
members. An additional $l,OOO was
added to the Executive's general dis
cretionary fund.
Newly elected Executives Billy
Gallagher'l4 and Dan Ashton'l4
were given equal salaries, as they
plan to serve as co-Presidents.
According to Senator Viraj
Bindra 'l5, $1,500 was removed from
the Constitutional Council stipends
and $3,500 from the Nominations
Commission (NomCom) discre
tionary fund, two proposals that
Bindra implemented based on sug
gestions made in an email from AS
SU Assistant Financial Manager
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.'l4.
"In the past years, the largest
amount that NomCom has ever used
was close to $l,OOO. Removing $3,500
still leaves them with $1,675 in their
budget, which is an adequate buffer
but frees up more usable money,"
Bindra said, adding that there "effec
tively is no Constitutional Council"
and that the money for stipends has
gone unused.
