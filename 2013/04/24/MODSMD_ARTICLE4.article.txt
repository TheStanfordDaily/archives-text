# STUDENT GOVT
## Senators hold last meeting Routine budget business for the 2013-14 year passed 
### LUCY SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate passed the ASSU's 2013-14 Oper
ating Budget in its last full meeting
of the year before the transition to
the 15th Undergraduate Senate.
The budget includes several no
table changes from last year, includ
ing the allocation of an additional
$5,000 to the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) general discretionary
fund, $2,000 to the Senate's general
discretionary fund and $l,OOO to Sen
ate committee discretionary funds.
Changes were also made to the
ASSU Executive's portion of the
budget, with $3,000 transferred from
discretionary funds to stipends for
the salaries of Executive cabinet
members. An additional $l,OOO was
added to the Executive's general dis
cretionary fund.
Newly elected Executives Billy
Gallagher'l4 and Dan Ashton'l4
were given equal salaries, as they
plan to serve as co-Presidents.
According to Senator Viraj
Bindra 'l5, $1,500 was removed from
the Constitutional Council stipends
and $3,500 from the Nominations
Commission (NomCom) discre
tionary fund, two proposals that
Bindra implemented based on sug
gestions made in an email from AS
SU Assistant Financial Manager
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.'l4.
"In the past years, the largest
amount that NomCom has ever used
was close to $l,OOO. Removing $3,500
still leaves them with $1,675 in their
budget, which is an adequate buffer
but frees up more usable money,"
Bindra said, adding that there "effec
tively is no Constitutional Council"
and that the money for stipends has
gone unused.
NomCom Co-Chair Jonathan
York 'l3 also spoke at the meeting,
notifying the Senate that NomCom
has almost completed the process of
choosing student representatives for
University councils.
According to York, NomCom re
ceived 500 applications from 270 stu
dents for committee positions. York
said that he plans to attend the Sen
ate meeting next week with a final
list of the committee's selections.
"The goal is to fill every single
student spot, which hasn't been done

for the last couple of years," he said.
"We're almost there, and I think we
are actually in good shape."
Sophomore Class Presidents
Costner McKenzie 'l5 and Monica
Dey 'l5 also attended the meeting,
seeking funds to sponsor an advance
screening of "The Great Gatsby" on
May 9.

McKenzie and Dey requested a
grant of $1,321.20 for the remaining
costs that will not be covered by the
budget for the Class of 2015 and tick
et sales. Students will be charged $8
to attend the event.

According to McKenzie and Dey,
the event will be capped at 220 un
dergraduate students and will not be
restricted to sophomores. The re
quested money would be used to pay

for an additional two charter buses in
order to be able to transport all at
tendees and would also cover the
Event√ürite fee.
Senators then debated the
amount of money left in the body's
funds, concluding that they will like
ly have about $2,500 left in usable
funds after reimbursing senators for
several purchases made during the
year and setting aside funds for the
next Senate.
Bindra said that he had also told
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3 that
the Senate would likely be able to
grant about $1,500 to contribute to
the incorporation fee for a student
run nonprofit that might operate
Suites Dining next year.
Unterreiner is a Daily editor.

According to Bindra, Unterreiner
said that the incorporation fee would
cost about $5,000, though Bindra
said that he had not yet received an
official written quote from Unter
reiner. The Senate will not grant the
money before receiving a quote.

Senator Lauren Miller 'l5 in
formed McKenzie and Dey that they
would need to discuss the proposal
with Appropriations Committee
Deputy Chair Christos Haveles 'l5,
who was absent from the meeting
due to a midterm, and that they will
decide on the requested grant by to
morrow evening.

According to Miller, Appropria
tions Committee Chair Nancy Pham
'l4, who has been absent from the
Senate's last four meetings, submit

ted a letter of resignation to the Sen
ate after deciding to study abroad
this quarter.
The Senate's bylaws state that all
senators must remain on campus for
the duration of their term "with the ex
ceptions of official university breaks
and other brief trips" and stipulate
that a senator will be automatically
expelled for a breach of this rule.
Though Haveles, who has pre
sented funding bills in Pham's ab
sence, was absent from the meeting,
the Senate unanimously passed
$26,395.57 in general fees funding re
quests and special fees budget modi
fications.
