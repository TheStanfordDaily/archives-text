This is the second piece of a three
part feature on Shannon Turley, the
sports performance coordinator en
tering his seventh season with Sta?i
ford football. Part II focuses on the
nuts and bolts of Turley's training
regimen.

What drives the wildly
successful training phi
losophy of Shannon Tur
ley? Here is an example:
It's a beautiful spring
day on the Farm, and instead of being to
tally dumbstruck by Shannon Turley, I am

now positively terrified by the freshman
year version of Alex Debniak.
"I was spotting Andrew Luck on squats,
and it was actually a little too heavy for him
at the time," Debniak says. "This was
when I first got here. And he actually end
ed up crashing on the squat rack, and it
made this loud noise, and everybody in the
weight room thought that he broke his leg
or shattered or something. And of course
I'm standing behind him looking dumb
founded because I wasn't paying much at
tention."

Debniak sheepishly grins, "I got a pret
ty good mouthful from Turley. He was
pretty angry. He couldn't talk to me for the

rest of the day."

The Luck incident pres
ents a question: What is more
important, the outcome or
the process? Luck, then a
freshman, was not injured
and in fact went on to have a
fine college career, so the out
come of the accident was ac
ceptable. But the accident
was clearly unacceptable,
and if repeated, would likely
have laid waste to not just
Luck but the entire Stanford
football team. The key take
away from Turley's philoso
phy is that the process is
more important than the out
come.
"We're very process-ori
ented as players and as a
program," Turley says. "'We
want to concentrate on those
things we can control and
take absolutely no talent to
master.
"Winning games, winning
awards and trophies we're
going to leave that up to oth
er people, because we don't
have any control over that.
"That's a big concept," he
admits.
♦♦♦
As might be expected, the
Stanford players initially had
trouble digesting Turley's
philosophy. "It was incredibly
frustrating to deal with at
first," remembers Andrew
Phillips. "Memorizing little
passages and talking about
getting your foot over the
line [during sprints] you
gotta win football games!"
Coming off a one-win season
in 2006, focusing on perform
ance seemed more critical
than ever.
Turley attempted to in
still a commitment to the
process by being very partic
ular about how his players
performed their exercises
and drills. A system of re
wards and punishments was
devised for everything from
lifting to sprints. Slogans
were assigned and expected
to be memorized. Daily at

required.
"You have to be demand
ing," Turley insists. "You
can't compromise."
However, the hallmark of
Turley's method was, and
still is, the goal system. Be
fore each practice, every
Stanford player is given a set
of goals to achieve, the na
ture of the goals reflecting
Turley's own beliefs: One of
the goals is outcome-based,
two are performance-based
and five are process-based
(give or take a goal or two).
The latter goals might en

creased effort in practice.
If Stanford was going to
improve, it would require a
workable, innovative plan for
doing so, and it would have to
convince its players that that
plan would be effective. At
the same time 2,300 miles
away, Nick Saban then
just beginning his highly suc
cessful tenure at Alabama
was installing the slogan
"It's All Part of the Process,"
but the Cardinal and Crim
son Tide were two different
animals.
"I can't tell these kids to
do something 'just because,'
and I can't say that we need
to do something because Ala
bama does it that way and
Alabama wins national cham
pionships," Turley says.
"They're not going to buy it.
I couldn't really say, 'Well,
this is how we did it at San
Diego,' a 1-AA non-scholar
ship team. So you have to be
able to explain why what
you're doing is going to make
them a better player."
♦♦♦
Part of this internal re
sistance to the process comes
from football analysts' long
standing fixation with num
bers. Even now, with today's
Stanford football miles better
than its 2006 counterpart,
Turley sees a certain degree
of skepticism among the foot
ball community, where the
NFL Combine has turned
quantifications such as the
bench-press test into a fetish.

As Turley pointed out to
Phillips years ago, "If you're
at the point where you're on
your back... pushing weight
up off the ground, you've al
ready lost."
The recently graduated
Debniak, whom Turley is cur
rently preparing for this
week's NFL draft, is going
through this same problem
with the pro scouts.
"They really put a lot of
emphasis on a lot of those
numbers," he says. "And why
not? That's what they've
been doing for so many years
now. But I think the sport is
evolving always, and I think
if some of these scouting
services and the NFL don't
wish to change their views on
stuff, I think it's a little bit
frustrating for Coach Turley
and our staff, because they
have different ideas."

"Too often, in my role you
see a guy that is number
hungry," Turley adds, "and
he's more concerned with the
NFL Combine type of statis
tics— how much a guy can
bench press, how much a guy
can back squat, how much a
guy can power clean."
Debniak who benched
225 pounds 25 times at Stan
ford's pro day, which would
have placed an impressive
eighth among linebackers at
the NFL Combine is then
quick to clarify: "He'll play to
their game, though, and
we've consistently put up re
ally good numbers in bench,
so I don't think you can real
ly complain much about
that."
♦♦♦
Put simply, the purpose of
Turley's program is not to
get big. When describing his
system, Turley even shies
away from the word "lifting,"
preferring to use the more
expansive term "sports per
formance." True to form,
even his official title is sports
performance coordinator, not
strength coach.
The new paradigm of foot
ball training, he insists, en
compasses not just condition
ing but nutrition, psychology

(especially the aforemen
tioned goals) and sports med
icine. A specialist in nutrition
at Virginia Tech and psychol
ogy as a graduate student at
Missouri, Turley refuses to
allow these areas to go over
looked.

Philosophically, the num
ber one goal of Stanford's
conditioning program is to
avoid injuries. Upon joining
the team, Stanford football
players are extensively test
ed for their movement, flexi
bility, balance and physical
stability, as well as potential
risk factors. Steve Bartlinski,
the team's trainer and coordi
nator of injury rehab, esti
mates that the staff's focus
on identifying possible causes
of injury has reduced Stan
ford's re-injury rate signifi
cantly, and indeed, the Cardi
nal's 2012 Rose Bowl cam
paign enjoyed fantastic ros
ter continuity and relatively
few major injuries in a sport
full of them. Every single
starter at the beginning of
the season was healthy and
available for action in the
Rose Bowl.

Most astonishingly, Stan
ford's Director of Football
Operations Matt Doyle esti
mated that Stanford's
starters missed a combined
total of more than 60 games
in 2006; six years later, one
"could count the number of
games lost by starters on one
hand."

Turley never relaxes his
standards, even when a play
er is sidelined. An individual
rehabilitation plan is devel
oped for every recovering
athlete. "There's going to be
a stepwise process that these
guys have to go through to
earn their way back out into
practice," he says. "So
they're going to have to be
able to do things first in phys
ical therapy and then in the
athletic training room before
they can do them with me...

We want him back on the
field better than he was be
fore."

"The old days of 'Hey, you
look pretty good, go play' are

over. We have to quantify and
qualify them through a
process in order to have them
return," Bartlinski says. "I
think people still unfortu
nately still go by timelines. If
past literature dictates that
somebody's out for six
months, when that six-month
mark comes up, they're ei
ther cleared to return,
whether they're ready or
not."

Stanford's sparkling in
jury record has not gone un
noticed, especially by the ath
letes whose bodies are being
entrusted to Cardinal foot
ball. Five years after com
mitting to Stanford, Debni
ak remains grateful for Tur
ley's emphasis on player
safety.
"I had a lot of security,
going into Stanford with the
understanding that they
were really going to take care
of us," he says. "Coming out
of high school, I had a couple
injury issues, and that was
something I really appreciat
ed from him."
♦♦♦
Turley's guiding principle
on injuries is that players
who are stronger on the foot
ball field are less susceptible
to injury in the first place.
Consequently, everything in
Stanford's conditioning pro
gram is designed with foot
ball in mind. If an exercise is
not relevant to football in
some way, Turley deempha
sizes it, and if an exercise is
relevant to football, Turley
may incorporate it into his
program. Some of his more
unorthodox methods include
pushing trucks, squatting
with one foot in front of the
other ("It's actually pretty
challenging," Phillips ex
plains) and an end-of-practice
favorite resembling an ex
tremely one-sided game of
tug-of-war.
Turley is also not afraid to
borrow ideas from other peo
ple. Trained in the classic
Olympic lifts (power cleans,
jerks and the like) under
Mike Gentry at Virginia
Tech, Turley nevertheless
has adopted elements from
many different schools of
conditioning, convinced that
no single style of lifting cor
responds perfectly to foot
ball. "Power cleans, Olympic
style lifting that's a sport.
Bodybuilding, that's a sport.
Powerlifting, that's a sport,"
Turley says.
Experienced in special
ized training in track and
football at Virginia Tech,
baseball with the Kansas
City Royals minor league
system and volleyball and
wrestling at Missouri, Turley
understands the similarities
and differences between
sports more than most.
"We're not training our
athletes to be weightlifters,"
Bartlinski adds. "Functional
ity on the field is our most
important goal."
To this extent, Turley and
his equally overworked staff
Bartlinski estimates that

at peak times, he and Turley
typically work from 5 a.m. to
8 p.m. take a very individ
ualized approach to training
for each of the football
team's 100-odd athletes.
But how?
♦♦♦
Perhaps inevitably at a
school in Silicon Valley, Tur
ley has made technology a
notable part of his program,
allowing him to effectively
keep tabs on every athlete on
the team.
He brings in training
equipment from a wide vari
ety of sources. The "space
ship" in his office is actually a
Bod Pod, which uses air dis
placement systems to ana
lyze a player's levels and con
centrations of body fat and
muscle. The Functional
Movement Screen is a set of
physical tests that surveys
players' physical abilities and
limitations; Turley explains,
"If there are compensatory
movement patterns, if there
are asymmetries, right ver
sus left, in their movement
patterns, then we're going to
have issues because that
player is now predisposed to
injury risk." Perhaps the
most remarkable innovation
of all is the core-cooling glove
developed by Stanford's Den
nis Grahn and Craig Heller,
which allows athletes to work
harder and longer in the
weight room and on the play
ing field.
"We have great opportu
nities that only come because
we're at Stanford," Bartlinski
says.

At the same time, howev
er, sometimes the old ways
are best. Despite his use of
technology, Turley espouses a
fairly old-school approach to
his charges' nutrition.
"If they're not eating
right, if they're not hydrat
ing, if they're not fueling for
that work and recovering im
mediately after and then
sleeping adequately, then all
that work in that hour and a
half does not mean any
thing," he says.
Turley was more straight
forward in an interview at
Examiner.com: "If you can't
pick it, pluck it or kill it, you
don't eat it. It is not real food."

Consequently, despite all
of the various sources that
make up the Cardinal sys
tem, there is one common
goal: a focus on the player.
Turley's multi-faceted educa
tion has opened him to new
ideas in the weight room, but
only as long as it helps him
put the players first.
"Until I understand [a
new training technique]...
I'm not going to utilize it with
our team until I know where
it fits in to the bigger picture
of all those areas of our com
prehensive program," Turley
says. "We want to make sure
that we're going right by our
players. That's first and fore
most."
