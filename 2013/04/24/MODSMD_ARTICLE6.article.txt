# Q&A CAROLINE WINTERER
## PROFESSOR OF HISTORY 
### BENJAMIN PHAM 
Caroline Winterer, professor of history, was
recently named the new director of the Stanford
Humanities Center, a post she will assume on
Sept. 1. The Daily sat down with Winterer to dis
cuss her research interests in early America's in
tellectual and cultural history, her vision for the
Humanities Center and the state of the humani
ties on campus.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What drew you to
Stanford's History Department? How has
Stanford been supportive of your research in
terests?

Caroline Winterer (CW): This is my ninth
year in the History Department, and what drew
me to it is, of course, [that] it's one of the top five
or so history departments in the country. It's got
overall excellence in all fields of history, but in
American history it's extremely strong, and also
in early modern European and global history,
it's got some of the best scholars out there, so
given my own research interests which I
think of as American early modern history it
seemed like a perfect fit, and it has been.
It's been a really fruitful place to think about
the history of ideas, of art and material culture,
of political thought all of these fields have
wonderful specialists in my department, but also
institutionally. I've had a chance to do the Amer
ican Enlightenment exhibit at Green Library in
2011. I also did a printed catalog of the exhibit
that was supported by the university, among
other projects, so everything fits together.

TSD: What drew you to directing the Stan
ford Humanities Center?

CW: In some ways, I've been thinking about
this since I started my career as a graduate stu
dent. I'm really interested in how people think
about the world today and how they have
thought abut the world in the past, and that in
terest in graduate school drove me to write my
dissertation on the transformation of approaches
to classical antiquity. How people between 1500
and 1900 transformed the way they think about
ancient Greece and Rome is interesting, because
we think they're done, they're over what
could be new to learn from them? but what I
learned is that we re-invent the past all the time.
In 1500, we thought one thing about the an
cient world, and, in 1900, we thought something
different about it. Those thoughts made people
completely transform higher education in Amer
ica. At the end of the 19th century, they decided
the classics were pointless, unlike the sciences,
which were more immediately useful. I just
thought that was interesting, how somehow this
subject we call the humanities was formed dur
ing that transformation of the university, so that
suddenly, you went from just having classics to
having all of these new subjects in the university
under this banner of humanities. History, Eng
lish literature, art history, philosophy all of
these subjects were moved to the university, and
they were being called something called the hu
manities. I thought that [the changing interpre
tations of the ancient world] was an interesting
transformation in human history, and now I'm
directing a humanities center and I get to think
about these things some more.
TSD: What does this job actually entail? Will
you continue to teach, research and advise as
much as you do now?
CW: From what I can see right now, my actu
al undergraduate teaching is going to go away for
a while —it's a big administrative
job, and so I'll be taken out of the un
dergraduate classroom, but it doesn't
mean I'll entirely stop talking to un
dergraduates, who are a huge con
stituency to the university, especially
in their capacity as research assis
tants to the scholars in humanities
departments and at the center. My
role to the undergraduates will
change but not go away.
My job as director is to steer this
ship forward. One of the primary
initiatives of the center is its won
derful fellowship program for visit
ing and internal scholars. These fel
lowships allow scholars to spend a
full academic year, in many cases,
thinking very deeply about their re
search. That research is internally
important for those questions it rais
es in specific disciplines, but it's also
important to scholars so they can
stay active and fresh as teachers.
It's both about monastic solitude
and cooperation among the fellows
to let these ideas see the light of day,
so I see my role as director as help
ing to maintain the Humanities Cen
ter's excellence in the fellowship
program and the workshop pro
gram for faculty and students to ex
plore specific topics of interests and
bring in outside scholars.

TSD: What role, if any, do you see
the Stanford Humanities Center
playing in undergraduate human
ities education and research?
CW: The role that the humanities
play in undergraduate education is
extremely important, but it's not one
that undergraduates necessarily see
very clearly. They come to the hu
manities through the disciplines
if I'm fascinated by the Middle Ages,
or some philosophical question, I
major in history or philosophy or
French literature. The role of the
Humanities Center in the lives of
undergraduates is indirect. It en
sures the excellence and vigor of the
faculty who are teaching these un
dergraduate courses at the most so
phisticated level, but there's also a
direct role that the Humanities Cen
ter plays in the research projects of
the scholars in residence at the cen
ter, so undergraduates can come and
participate with scholars who are
doing cutting-edge research.

TSD: How important do you think
humanities education and research
is to the university community?
CW: Obviously, I think humani
ties education is very important to
the university community, and the

university has been promoting ini
tiatives to increase the profile of the
humanities. We've expanded [the
Summer Humanities Institute] this
summer and added a whole new
module in philosophy and literature.
This is an effort to address what we
call the pipeline problem —to get
high school students interested in
coming to Stanford to get them to
major in the humanities at Stanford.
It's exciting to see the seriousness
with which the university is support
ing humanities endeavors.

TSD: Given flagging enrollment
in humanities majors, what is the
state of the humanities on cam
pus? What can the Center do?
CW: I don't have a crystal ball, so
I don't have an exact answer, but
what you say is true. Humanities en
rollment is declining at Stanford,
but it's been declining all around the
country. One of the things the Hu
manities Center can do is remind us
that the humanities and sciences are
approaching the major questions of
human existence. We all want to
know what makes us better people,
what our obligations are to our
selves and society.
We're all worried [about] the
problems of being human beings in
the world, but the sciences and the
humanities aren't necessarily en
gaged in opposing projects. They're
engaged, in some cases, in really sim
ilar projects, but they just approach
them in different ways. Opening up
conversations between humanists
and other parts of the university like
medicine, law, education and art to
find the points of contacts is a role
that the Humanities Center can play.

TSD: How does the Humanities
Center compare to other schools?
Do other schools have similar in
stitutions?
CW: This has been one of the
great things in the past 20 or 30
years universities have estab
lished humanities centers on campus
with similar roles like Stanford's as
enablers and sort of clearinghouses
for humanistic scholarship. What
makes Stanford's unique is that it's
the largest campus-based humanities
center in the country. The only larger
institute is the National Humanities
Center in Research Triangle Park, in
North Carolina, but it's not actually
on a campus, so we are the largest of
a growing species. Because of its size,
the Center is very well equipped to
enter a national conversation about
the role of the humanities.

This interview has been con
densed and edited.

Caroline Winterer, professor of history, was
recently named the new director of the Stanford
Humanities Center, a post she will assume on
Sept. 1. The Daily sat down with Winterer to dis
cuss her research interests in early America's in
tellectual and cultural history, her vision for the
Humanities Center and the state of the humani
ties on campus.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What drew you to
Stanford's History Department? How has
Stanford been supportive of your research in
terests?

Caroline Winterer (CW): This is my ninth
year in the History Department, and what drew
me to it is, of course, [that] it's one of the top five
or so history departments in the country. It's got
overall excellence in all fields of history, but in
American history it's extremely strong, and also
in early modern European and global history,
it's got some of the best scholars out there, so
given my own research interests which I
think of as American early modern history it
seemed like a perfect fit, and it has been.
It's been a really fruitful place to think about
the history of ideas, of art and material culture,
of political thought all of these fields have
wonderful specialists in my department, but also
institutionally. I've had a chance to do the Amer
ican Enlightenment exhibit at Green Library in
2011. I also did a printed catalog of the exhibit
that was supported by the university, among
other projects, so everything fits together.

TSD: What drew you to directing the Stan
ford Humanities Center?

CW: In some ways, I've been thinking about
this since I started my career as a graduate stu
dent. I'm really interested in how people think
about the world today and how they have
thought abut the world in the past, and that in
terest in graduate school drove me to write my
dissertation on the transformation of approaches
to classical antiquity. How people between 1500
and 1900 transformed the way they think about
ancient Greece and Rome is interesting, because
we think they're done, they're over what
could be new to learn from them? but what I
learned is that we re-invent the past all the time.
In 1500, we thought one thing about the an
cient world, and, in 1900, we thought something
different about it. Those thoughts made people
completely transform higher education in Amer
ica. At the end of the 19th century, they decided
the classics were pointless, unlike the sciences,
which were more immediately useful. I just
thought that was interesting, how somehow this
subject we call the humanities was formed dur
ing that transformation of the university, so that
suddenly, you went from just having classics to
having all of these new subjects in the university
under this banner of humanities. History, Eng
lish literature, art history, philosophy all of
these subjects were moved to the university, and
they were being called something called the hu
manities. I thought that [the changing interpre
tations of the ancient world] was an interesting
transformation in human history, and now I'm
directing a humanities center and I get to think
about these things some more.
TSD: What does this job actually entail? Will
you continue to teach, research and advise as
much as you do now?
CW: From what I can see right now, my actu
al undergraduate teaching is going to go away for
a while —it's a big administrative
job, and so I'll be taken out of the un
dergraduate classroom, but it doesn't
mean I'll entirely stop talking to un
dergraduates, who are a huge con
stituency to the university, especially
in their capacity as research assis
tants to the scholars in humanities
departments and at the center. My
role to the undergraduates will
change but not go away.
My job as director is to steer this
ship forward. One of the primary
initiatives of the center is its won
derful fellowship program for visit
ing and internal scholars. These fel
lowships allow scholars to spend a
full academic year, in many cases,
thinking very deeply about their re
search. That research is internally
important for those questions it rais
es in specific disciplines, but it's also
important to scholars so they can
stay active and fresh as teachers.
It's both about monastic solitude
and cooperation among the fellows
to let these ideas see the light of day,
so I see my role as director as help
ing to maintain the Humanities Cen
ter's excellence in the fellowship
program and the workshop pro
gram for faculty and students to ex
plore specific topics of interests and
bring in outside scholars.

TSD: What role, if any, do you see
the Stanford Humanities Center
playing in undergraduate human
ities education and research?
CW: The role that the humanities
play in undergraduate education is
extremely important, but it's not one
that undergraduates necessarily see
very clearly. They come to the hu
manities through the disciplines
if I'm fascinated by the Middle Ages,
or some philosophical question, I
major in history or philosophy or
French literature. The role of the
Humanities Center in the lives of
undergraduates is indirect. It en
sures the excellence and vigor of the
faculty who are teaching these un
dergraduate courses at the most so
phisticated level, but there's also a
direct role that the Humanities Cen
ter plays in the research projects of
the scholars in residence at the cen
ter, so undergraduates can come and
participate with scholars who are
doing cutting-edge research.

TSD: How important do you think
humanities education and research
is to the university community?
CW: Obviously, I think humani
ties education is very important to
the university community, and the

university has been promoting ini
tiatives to increase the profile of the
humanities. We've expanded [the
Summer Humanities Institute] this
summer and added a whole new
module in philosophy and literature.
This is an effort to address what we
call the pipeline problem —to get
high school students interested in
coming to Stanford to get them to
major in the humanities at Stanford.
It's exciting to see the seriousness
with which the university is support
ing humanities endeavors.

TSD: Given flagging enrollment
in humanities majors, what is the
state of the humanities on cam
pus? What can the Center do?
CW: I don't have a crystal ball, so
I don't have an exact answer, but
what you say is true. Humanities en
rollment is declining at Stanford,
but it's been declining all around the
country. One of the things the Hu
manities Center can do is remind us
that the humanities and sciences are
approaching the major questions of
human existence. We all want to
know what makes us better people,
what our obligations are to our
selves and society.
We're all worried [about] the
problems of being human beings in
the world, but the sciences and the
humanities aren't necessarily en
gaged in opposing projects. They're
engaged, in some cases, in really sim
ilar projects, but they just approach
them in different ways. Opening up
conversations between humanists
and other parts of the university like
medicine, law, education and art to
find the points of contacts is a role
that the Humanities Center can play.

TSD: How does the Humanities
Center compare to other schools?
Do other schools have similar in
stitutions?
CW: This has been one of the
great things in the past 20 or 30
years universities have estab
lished humanities centers on campus
with similar roles like Stanford's as
enablers and sort of clearinghouses
for humanistic scholarship. What
makes Stanford's unique is that it's
the largest campus-based humanities
center in the country. The only larger
institute is the National Humanities
Center in Research Triangle Park, in
North Carolina, but it's not actually
on a campus, so we are the largest of
a growing species. Because of its size,
