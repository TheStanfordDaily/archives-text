# Q&A CAROLINE WINTERER
## PROFESSOR OF HISTORY 
### BENJAMIN PHAM 
Caroline Winterer, professor of history, was
recently named the new director of the Stanford
Humanities Center, a post she will assume on
Sept. 1. The Daily sat down with Winterer to dis
cuss her research interests in early America's in
tellectual and cultural history, her vision for the
Humanities Center and the state of the humani
ties on campus.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What drew you to
Stanford's History Department? How has
Stanford been supportive of your research in
terests?

Caroline Winterer (CW): This is my ninth
year in the History Department, and what drew
me to it is, of course, [that] it's one of the top five
or so history departments in the country. It's got
overall excellence in all fields of history, but in
American history it's extremely strong, and also
in early modern European and global history,
it's got some of the best scholars out there, so
given my own research interests which I
think of as American early modern history it
seemed like a perfect fit, and it has been.
It's been a really fruitful place to think about
the history of ideas, of art and material culture,
of political thought all of these fields have
wonderful specialists in my department, but also
institutionally. I've had a chance to do the Amer
ican Enlightenment exhibit at Green Library in
2011. I also did a printed catalog of the exhibit
that was supported by the university, among
other projects, so everything fits together.

TSD: What drew you to directing the Stan
ford Humanities Center?

CW: In some ways, I've been thinking about
this since I started my career as a graduate stu
dent. I'm really interested in how people think
about the world today and how they have
thought abut the world in the past, and that in
terest in graduate school drove me to write my
dissertation on the transformation of approaches
to classical antiquity. How people between 1500
and 1900 transformed the way they think about
ancient Greece and Rome is interesting, because
we think they're done, they're over what
could be new to learn from them? but what I
learned is that we re-invent the past all the time.
In 1500, we thought one thing about the an
cient world, and, in 1900, we thought something
different about it. Those thoughts made people
completely transform higher education in Amer
ica. At the end of the 19th century, they decided
the classics were pointless, unlike the sciences,
which were more immediately useful. I just
thought that was interesting, how somehow this
subject we call the humanities was formed dur
ing that transformation of the university, so that
suddenly, you went from just having classics to
having all of these new subjects in the university
under this banner of humanities. History, Eng
lish literature, art history, philosophy all of
these subjects were moved to the university, and
they were being called something called the hu
manities. I thought that [the changing interpre
tations of the ancient world] was an interesting
transformation in human history, and now I'm
directing a humanities center and I get to think
about these things some more.
TSD: What does this job actually entail? Will
you continue to teach, research and advise as
much as you do now?
CW: From what I can see right now, my actu
al undergraduate teaching is going to go away for
