## Sports is not bigger than real life

What does A1 Gore
have to do with
sports? A1 Gore is
not an American
sporting legend;
however, he's won the Nobel Peace
Prize, which is considerably more im
portant. Typ™g in 'AI Gore sports"
returns 40.8 million hits on Google,
but if you scan the first page of re
sults, none of them actually links Gore
to sports in any meaningful way. In
high school, Gore captained the foot
ball team and also participated in bas
ketball and track, but like the thou
sands upon thousands of high school
varsity captains dotting the American
landscape, A1 Gore is not defined by
sports.
In fact, A1 Gore gave a speech on
climate change and the democratic
process yesterday, right here on cam
pus, and he did not mention sports
once. One imagines that if he had
mentioned sports, it would have de
tracted from his message.

Sometimes we have to have some
perspective: When football coaches
say that their sport "isn't a matter of
life or death, it's more than that,"
that's a motivational saying, not de
rived from any true belief (At least I
hope that's a motivational saying.)
Regardless of whether you agree
with A1 Gore on anything, Gore tran
scends sports.
Meanwhile, a little over three hun
dred miles from Gore's family home,
Auburn just removed the fabled oaks
from Toomer's Corner. Celebrating at
the corner by rolling toilet paper has
been an Auburn football tradition for
many decades now, but the trees were
recently marked for death. Specifical
ly, after Auburn football defeated Al
abama in 2009, Alabama fan Harvey
Updyke poisoned them and subse
quently made a deranged phone call
to the Paul Finebaum radio show (de
ranged even by Finebaum standards,
which is really saying something)
confessing his guilt.
Updyke—who even named his
children Crimson Tyde and Bear
Bryant, after the team name and the
legendary coach, respectively —is
now in prison, and I doubt that he
was watching a live feed of Gore's
speech. That is a pity, because Gore
had some decidedly interesting
things to say about the medium that
really brought big-time college foot
ball to Updyke and millions of other
Americans: television.

Gore's point was that (especially
at a tech-sawy university in Silicon
Valley) people can often be disorient
ed and believe that the Internet is
dominant. It is not. Television is still
the main information superhighway
in this country. Television attracts (ac
cording to Gore) 80 percent of election
campaign funds. The Internet carries
with it explosive potential, but the tel
evision industry has gotten very good
at simplifying complex issues into
short two- or three-minute segments
that a busy viewer can easily digest.

But one of the downsides of televi
sion is that it not only enables reduc
tion but is inherently and inescapably
reductive; as Gore alluded to when
talking about Thomas Paine's "Com
mon Sense," television only captures a
small part of a greater story. TV cam
eras try to catch longtime fans and
students covered in paint shouting
their slogans, but there is still a world
of difference between watching a
game on TV and being there in per
son.

Football is not all about the score:
It is about playing the game, cheering
the team, celebrating in victory and
commiserating in defeat. Football is
history; football is tradition for rea
sons inexplicable; football is tens of
thousands of people gathering at an
intersection in Auburn, Ala., to say
goodbye to two trees that survived

Football is
not all about
the score:
It is about
playing the
game
horrendous teams and spec
tacular failures, but not Spike
80DF herbicide. Football the
sport is not limited to football
the game, and it would be dis
respectful to reduce it to such.
And at the same time, all
the pomp and circumstance
and traditions that make foot
ball such a compelling sport
serve to remind us fans that
they are still, on some level, a
shadow to the realities of the
life surrounding the field. Hu
man existence did not begin at
the tailgate, and it does not
end when the game clock
strikes 00:00.

Does this fact absolve Up
dyke of his wrongdoing, under
the assumption that what he
did is to a large extent irrele
vant? In fact, misreading this
last point, a defender of Up
dyke might say, "Hey, what's
the big deal, it's just trees."
A1 Gore cares about sports,
but I suppose he would say in
response (and I would agree),
"Hey, what's the big deal, it's
just football." Auburn's stun
ning comeback against Ala
bama may have wounded Up
dyke's pride, but that's no ex
cuse for real vengeance in the
real world.

Contrary to public opinion,
Winston Shi did not invent
football. Confront him about
this inconvenient truth at
