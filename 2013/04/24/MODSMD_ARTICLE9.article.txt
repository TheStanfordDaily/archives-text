# STEPPING UP
## Klahn and Thacher a tough act to follow for new star Morrissey 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
John Morrissey had big shoes
to fill on the Stanford men's
tennis team this year. With
the departure of the team's
top two players, Bradley
Klahn 'l2 and Ryan Thacher 'l2,
the sophomore stepped up to the
No. 1 singles position, leading a
relatively young team against
some of the toughest competition
in the nation.
While Klahn admitted that it
"really put pressure on the entire
team" when he and Thacher grad
uated, he was confident in Morris
sey's leadership capabilities. Klahn
and Morrissey played together as
a doubles team in some matches
near the end of last season, giving
Klahn the opportunity to pass on
some of his knowledge and advice.
"[Morrissey] came to work
every day and was excited to prac
tice, and I think that's the biggest
thing about being a leader," Klahn
said. "He certainly has those char
acteristics of getting the work
done and a great team guy and all
these positives."
It's taken time for Morrissey to
adapt to his role as the new team
leader and No. 1 singles player, as
just last spring he was playing No.
4 singles and dreaming of following
in the footsteps of a confident sen
ior with an NCAA singles title.
"Coming in as a freshman, I

was playing a little bit of a follow
er's role," Morrissey said. "Brad
and Ryan were our two leaders and
had so much experience, so I was
playing a support role and trying
to do my job back there on the
back courts and learn as much as I
could."

Morrissey said that adjusting
to collegiate play in general has
been a significant challenge, as col
lege tennis is "completely differ
ent" from playing in the junior cir
cuit and he has been facing tough
competition at the No. 1 spot this
year.

"I'm no longer playing against
guys my age I'm playing against
guys who are a lot older than me,"
Morrissey said. "[The coaches]
taught me how to combat that and
play more aggressive and change
up my style."
Klahn agreed that collegiate
tennis is a"a whole different ball
game," and said that the pressure
of playing in the top spot can weigh
on young but experienced players
like Morrissey, who may still be
adjusting to the team atmos
phere.
"You're getting the best of
each team every match, and you
have to be really up to the task,"
Klahn vsaid. "It can set the tone
for the rest of the match when the
guys down at the bottom of the
lineup and everyone else is just
kind of looking up at you. You
have to be composed and have a

confident presence about you."
While Klahn expressed confi
dence in Morrissey's ability to
steer the team, the Cardinal's
transition to new leadership has
not come without challenges. Un
der Klahn, who now plays profes
sionally, the team advanced to two
straight NCAA quarterfinals and
ended last year ranked ninth in the
nation.

This year, the team has strug
gled to close out matches and will
enter the Pac-12 Championships
with a 3-4 conference record and a
No. 42 national ranking.
Klahn has been following the
team's progress this year and said
that, though this year has been a
"tough time" for the team, he is op
timistic that some of the closer
matches will "start falling their
way."

Klahn was also impressed with
Morrissey's transition to the top
position, praising his increasingly
aggressive yet consistent play
throughout the past two seasons.
"[Morrissey] was always able to
play really well, and I think it was
just kind of gaining that belief that
he could hang in there with those
guys," Klahn said. "Sometimes you
may have the game to play with the
top guys, but the confidence takes
a little while to catch up."
While Klahn may be traveling
around the world to play in profes
sional tournaments, he still takes
time to mentor the players he left
back on the Farm. Though Klahn
hasn't been able to come back to
campus as often as he would like,
he said that he is "always checking
up" on the team, which hasn't gone

unappreciated by Morrissey.
"I still keep in touch with him, I
send him messages and he watches
some of my matches and gives me
pointers," Morrissey said. "He ob
viously has helped me a ton. I think
just trying to feed off his experi
ence and pick his brain about little
things might make a huge differ
ence in my game."
The Cardinal's regular season
concluded with a 4-3 loss to No. 18
Cal on Saturday, and the team's
next match will come with the start
of the Pac-12 Championships to
morrow. Stanford is the No. 4 seed
and will be playing either Arizona
or Washington, which the team de
feated 6-1 and 4-3, respectively,
earlier in the season.

"We know we're a really good
team, and we've just been a few
games away from making a really
big breakthrough," Morrissey
said. "We are going to go down
there and hopefully make a state
ment and bring that forward to the
NCAAs."

Regardless of the outcome of
the Pac-12 Tournament, Morrissey
is looking forward to a strong sea
son next year.
"As a team, I think there are re
ally bright spots ahead. We are a
really young team getting in a cou
ple of good recruits next year,"
Morrissey said. "I think we can
look forward to a big season next
year and hopefully build on every
thing we learned this year and the
tough times and the tough losses
we've had."
