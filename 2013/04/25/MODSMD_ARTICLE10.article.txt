# CARD CLINCHES TOP SEED
## 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
With its 33rd straight win
over rival Cal last Friday, the
No. 1 Stanford women's water
polo team wrapped up its fourth
straight undefeated Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) regular season. The
Cardinal (26-1, 6-0 MPSF) now
turns its attention to the MPSF
Championship, which will take
place this weekend in Berkeley.
As the top-seeded team, the
Cardinal receives a quarterfinal
bye and will enter the tourna
ment at the semifinal stage.
Stanford's first matchup will be
on Saturday against the winner
of an earlier match between
fourth-seeded UCLA and fifth
seeded Cal.
Stanford has already faced
UCLA twice this season. On
Feb. 3, the Cardinal claimed the
Stanford Invitational title with
an 8-5 win over the Bruins in the
tournament final. Two months
later, on April 6, Stanford held
the Bruins scoreless until the fi
nal five minutes in an 8-1 victory

on Stanford's Senior Day.
Last week's game against
Cal was the Bay Area rivals' on
ly matchup this season. Sopho
more Kiley Neushul and fresh
man Maggie Steffens both tal
lied hat tricks as the Cardinal
pulled away from the Golden
Bears in the second half to take
an 8-4 win. Cal and UCLA will
face off at 2:30 p.m. on Friday. In
two previous meetings between
the teams, UCLA emerged vic
torious both times. The Bruins
also defeated the Golden Bears
at the Stanford Invitational by a
7-4 score. On March 9, UCLA
made it two for two with a 10-7
conference victory in Los Ange
les.
Both possible opponents fea
ture strong offenses, with Cal
averaging 11.27 goals per game
and UCLA just behind with an
11.17 mark.
Both teams have also seen
scoring from a variety of play
makers. UCLA has two players
in the top 25 in MPSF scoring,
sophomore Emily Donohoe (61
goals) and freshman Rachel Fat
tal (54 goals). In addition, four

other Bruins have at least 20
goals this season.
Four Cal players made the
list of top scorers, led by senior
Emily Ciskos, who has tallied 47
goals in 22 games.
On defense, the rankings are
reversed as UCLA has allowed
6.07 goals per game and Cal has
allowed 6.64. However, Bruins
sophomore goalkeeper Sami
Hill ranks second in the MPSF
with 10.35 saves per game while
Cal sophomore Savanna Smith
is last in the conference with just
5.92 saves per game.
No matter whom it faces,
Stanford will fire away with its
own roster of dangerous scor
ers. Cardinal senior Melissa Sei
demann finished the regular
season fifth in the MPSF with
60 goals this year. She is sup
ported by Steffens (51 goals),
Neushul (47 goals), freshman
Anna Yelizarova (43 goals) and
junior Annika Dries (27 goals in
17 games). Stanford's
defense has also been masterful
in recent weeks, holding its last
