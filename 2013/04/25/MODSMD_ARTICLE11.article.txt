## Prepping for Pac-12 postseason 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The postseason has finally arrived for
the Stanford women's teannis team. After
dropping a hard-fought battle to No. 9 Cal
last Saturday in its final regular season
match, the No. 12 Cardinal (16-4, 8-2 Pac
-12) traveled to Ojai on Wednesday to pre
pare for the Pac-12 singles and doubles
tournament with new determination.
"We actually are getting more fired up
than ever," said freshman Krista Harde
beck. "We've had a lot of team meetings
with just the players recently, and we are
trying our best to make as many adjust
ments and improvements as we can in the
next three weeks before NCAAs."
Stanford lost to the Golden Bears (15-
5, 9-1 Pac-12) for the first time since 2009,
despite coming out with a 1-0 lead after
capturing the doubles point. Even more
disappointing for the team was that the
women had cruised past Cal earlier this
season, 6-1, in a match that did not count
for conference standings. Cal finished the
season second in the Pac-12 behind USC,
while Stanford finished at the No. 3 spot.
Now that dual matches are over, the
Cardinal players will focus on individual
play this weekend at the Pac-12 Tourna
ment. Last year, Stanford's No. 1 player,
Nicole Gibbs, captured her first singles ti
tle of her collegiate career at the Pac-12
Tournament. This year, Gibbs will instead
be competing in a pro-circuit tournament
in Virginia.
The Pac-12 Tournament consists of a
32-person main singles draw and a 16-
team main doubles draw. Hardebeck, sen
ior Stacey Tan and junior co-captain
Kristie Ahn will all represent the Cardinal
in the main draw.
Hardebeck has a team-high 28 overall
wins and won the ITA Northwest Region
al singles championship earlier this year.
