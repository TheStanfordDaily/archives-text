## Prepping for Pac-12 postseason 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The postseason has finally arrived for
the Stanford women's teannis team. After
dropping a hard-fought battle to No. 9 Cal
last Saturday in its final regular season
match, the No. 12 Cardinal (16-4, 8-2 Pac
-12) traveled to Ojai on Wednesday to pre
pare for the Pac-12 singles and doubles
tournament with new determination.
"We actually are getting more fired up
than ever," said freshman Krista Harde
beck. "We've had a lot of team meetings
with just the players recently, and we are
trying our best to make as many adjust
ments and improvements as we can in the
next three weeks before NCAAs."
Stanford lost to the Golden Bears (15-
5, 9-1 Pac-12) for the first time since 2009,
despite coming out with a 1-0 lead after
capturing the doubles point. Even more
disappointing for the team was that the
women had cruised past Cal earlier this
season, 6-1, in a match that did not count
for conference standings. Cal finished the
season second in the Pac-12 behind USC,
while Stanford finished at the No. 3 spot.
Now that dual matches are over, the
Cardinal players will focus on individual
play this weekend at the Pac-12 Tourna
ment. Last year, Stanford's No. 1 player,
Nicole Gibbs, captured her first singles ti
tle of her collegiate career at the Pac-12
Tournament. This year, Gibbs will instead
be competing in a pro-circuit tournament
in Virginia.
The Pac-12 Tournament consists of a
32-person main singles draw and a 16-
team main doubles draw. Hardebeck, sen
ior Stacey Tan and junior co-captain
Kristie Ahn will all represent the Cardinal
in the main draw.
Hardebeck has a team-high 28 overall
wins and won the ITA Northwest Region
al singles championship earlier this year.
Hardebeck, who is coming off a 4-6, 2-6
singles loss to Cal's nationally ranked No.
5 Zsofi Susanyi and a 4-8 doubles loss with
her senior co-captain part
ner Natalie Dillon, is focused
on how she can rebound for
the upcoming tournament.
"The dual match losses
happened and it's over," she
said. "The main key is to
move on and forget it. I need
to focus instead on improving
my good shots and playing
my game more solidly."
Ahn and Tan will both re
turn to the main draw as well.
Ahn, who did not compete in
last year's tournament due to
injury, won the Pac-10 Tour
nament two years ago. Go
ing 23-4 overall this season
and currently on a team
best six-match winning
streak, she has high hopes of
repeating her success from
two years ago. Tan made it
all the way to the semi-finals
of the tournament last year,
where Gibbs ultimately end
ed her run.
"You just have to focus on
your match and keep it as
professional as possible,"
Hardebeck said of playing
teammates. "Once it's over,
you are back to being team
mates and that's the main
priority."
Sophomore Ellen Tsay
and Tan will be competing as
a doubles team together in
the main draw. The duo is en

tering the tournament with
momentum. They defeated
Cal's Klara Fabikova and
Zsofi Susanyi in a close 9-7
nail-biter to clinch the dou
bles point for Stanford this
past weekend.
Dillon, Tsay junior Amelia
Herring and freshman Lind
sey Kostas will compete in the
Pac-12 invitational draw this
weekend. The Pac-12 doubles
invitational draw will also fea
ture two Stanford teams: the
pairing of Herring and
Kostas and the duo of Dillon
and Hardebeck. With a three
week break until NCAAs, the

tournament will provide the
players with ongoing match
play practice.
"The tournament fires up
that drive to fight for your
self)" Hardebeck said. "The
individual mindset con
tributes to the team mindset
in the end."
The Pac-12 Tournament
begins today and runs
through Sunday. The cham
pionship action will be
broadcast from Ojai on the
Pac-12 Networks.
