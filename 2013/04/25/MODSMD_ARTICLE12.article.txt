# SAND VOLLEYBALL
## Team transitions back to the hardwood 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
If it was looking to bring more
success to the Fkrm, Stanford ath
letics made the right decision when
it decided to add women's sand vol
leyball to its existing 35 varsity
sports programs. In its inaugural
season, the Card finished 7-1,
sweeping all three meetings with
Santa Clara, falling only to Saint
Mary's and coming out on top

against Sacramento State, San
Francisco and Pacific.
"It was really fun, because you're
outside and it's a different, more re
laxed environment," said junior-
Mary Ellen Luck. "Ball control is re
ally different [than in indoor volley
ball], and it's less about power and
more about placing the ball. It was
good because it helped everyone get
more well-rounded in their game be
cause you have to do everything."
While not yet an NCAA sport,

sand volleyball is gaining momen
tum across the nation. Fellow Pac-12
schools that have added the sport in
clude Cal, UCLA, USC and Arizona.
Arizona will see its inaugural season
next year and USC, which just com
pleted its second season, already of
fers sand volleyball scholarships.
Head coach John Dunning ex
plained that the university will offer
scholarships to sand volleyball play
ers once funding is available to start
recruiting specifically for the bud

ding sport, instead of just having in
door players play for both teams.
With all that the team has accom
plished in its first season and es
pecially considering the players' lack
of previous experience with the
sport it is likely that the universi
ty will put more fimds towards sand
volleyball once it becomes an NCAA
sport.
In sand volleyball's second sea-
son, 31 schools from all across
the country competed. At
least three schools have com
mitted to adding the sport to
its list of varsity programs for
the 2014 season, and once the
magic number of 40 schools is
met it will become an NCAA
sanctioned sport.
Despite only practicing a
couple times before the start
of the season, the players
quickly adjusted to the differ
ent style of play and learned
their strengths and weak
nesses.
"It's hard transitioning be
tween the two because some
of the rules in sand are differ
ent," Luck said. "It was most
apparent when we first went
out to the sand and we tried to
do things that were illegal in
sand [volleyball]. It's funny
going back and forth since the
games are so different."
The coaches, also on a
learning curve, were able to
assess the skill levels of the
girls throughout the short
season and make changes ac
cordingly.
Three different pairs, for
example, held the No. 1 spot.
Santa Barbara native Carly
Wopat started off the first
three matches with freshman
Jordan Burgess, before play
ing with freshman Brittany
Howard. Wopat is the only
player to enter the season
with any previous beach vol
leyball experience.
A full transition was made
for the final match of the sea
son against Santa Clara, with
Burgess and junior Rachel

Williams replacing Wopat and
Howard. All three pairs had
great success, combining for
only one loss at the No. 1 spot.
"Mainly I think when you
have to look at the game in a
new way it can spark new
ideas and change the way
you're playing and get you to
improve at a new level. We've
been playing indoor for a real
ly long time, so it makes you
feel like you're doing the same
thing and its hard to get out of
a funk, but then you play out
doors and it's a completely dif
ferent game," said Burgess. "I
felt like we were re-learning
even the most basic things, like
how to bump and how to move
and set up our approaches. Be
ing forced to rethink the basics
of volleyball, itH make us much
better players."
While in the midst of the
sand volleyball season, the
players had to take a break
from indoor training. However,

attention will now be moved
from the sand to the court as
the team prepares for the 2013
season and works toward de
fending its Pac-12 title in the
faU.
"I think that sand is going
to help us a lot with indoor:
moving faster, covering more
ground, jumping higher," said
freshman Madi Bugg. "I'm ex
cited [to see the improve
ments]."
For now the Cardinal has a
break from team practices, as
only individual practices will
be held until the fall. Many
players will be playing on the
national team in the summer
or assisting with volleyball
camps on campus, while
freshman Inky Ajanaku will
be representing the Card in
China on the Pac-12 All Star
Team.
