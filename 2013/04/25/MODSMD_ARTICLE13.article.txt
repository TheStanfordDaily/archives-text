## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY A 						Case for Spontaneity 
### Adam Johnson 
Stanford students are all about
planning. A majority of us
probably have some form of
to-do lists and personal calendars.
We also love to ask other people
about their plans. What are your
plans for this weekend? What are
your plans for this summer? And
for seniors, what are your plans for
next year?
Planning is how we got into
Stanford, after all. A great many of
us selected our high school course
load well in advance, determined
what activities would look good on
our college applications and planned
teacher recommendations well be
fore the end of junior year so that
we could develop positive relation
ships with those faculty members.
And planning is how a majority
of us continue to operate. Who here
has spent hours, if not days, con
structing the perfect "four-year
plan," researched opportunities for
the next summer before the cur
rent one finished or placed every
last commitment and semi-commit
ment into a calendar? I've heard of
students who even plan time into
their packed schedules for being
spontaneous.
It all seems a bit excessive.
Sometimes, of course, planning is
desirable, if not necessary. If I'm
leading a backpacking trip and I
don't do any planning beforehand, I
am risking lives. If I am directing a
group of actors in a traditional the
atre performance, I should make
sure they have memorized their
lines and blocking. If I am deter
mined to work for a large corpora
tion over the summer, I better start
researching the application process
well in advance. If we want to work
within defined systems then out
side factors limit how spontaneous
we can be.
And yet blaming these outside
factors is an excuse. First, there is
no reason a priori why we should
want to work within rigid systems.
And second, we are often part of

the system that demands people
make plans far in advance. It is
people, after all, who are responsi
ble for setting the early deadlines
for corporate internships.
Even if we are resolved to work
within rigid systems and the bu
reaucratization of all facets of life
often leaves little choice —we have
more freedom to be flexible than we
imagine. I still think, then, that we
plan far too much. This is a problem,
because incessantly scheduling for
our future constricts us. It limits
the opportunity to improvise, to be
spontaneous. Why explore other
classes when you have a four-year
plan expertly laid out? Why go on a
hike on beautiful day when you
planned to spend the day studying?
I am taking an improv class
right now, and a cardinal sin of the
discipline is planning ahead. In
deed, it is almost entirely incompat
ible with the definition of improvi
sation (I say "almost" because
some planning, for instance organ
izing a group of improvisers to per
form, can be beneficial). When an
improviser plans ahead, he is no
longer responding to the scene,
partners, and the moment. And
while a line of dialogue or action
planned well in advance may end up
being funny, more often than not
these moments end up being at
best awkward and obvious to the

viewer and, at worst, moments that
can derail and constrict the full de
velopment of the scene.
Life, I think, is a similar way.
When we construct plans assum
ing we generally follow through on
them we can disrupt the natural
flow of our lives and limit our poten
tial. I think this is why the default
answer for Stanford students
seems to be "no." When I ask
friends if they want to come shoot
hoops for a few minutes before din
ner, or if I want to go to a campus
arts performance early on a Friday
night, I am all too often met with
negative responses.
I don't think it's me. And I don't
think it's that these people literally
do not have the time— we have
more free time than we imagine.
Rather, I think we say no because
we have not planned for what is be
ing offered to us; what we do not
plan for is therefore not worthy of
our precious time.
I wish we could incorporate the
tenets of improv into our everyday
lives. Besides not planning ahead, a
related rule is to "say yes" to offers.
Saying yes allows us to open our
minds to other possibilities that

perhaps we had not envisioned. It
makes planning ahead futile. Try
saying yes for an entire day, and (if
you are an average person) you will
realize just how often you end up
saying no. Another rule of improv I
find refreshing is to embrace mis
takes. Whereas for the average
Stanford student a mistake is a
black mark, something to hide, in
improv mistakes are gifts. For
when we embrace our mistakes, we
embrace being human.
If you reflect back on the more
memorable moments you have had

in your life, how many of those
were intensely planned? Some
probably were, no doubt, but I'm
guessing that more than a few such
moments came as a result of spon
taneity, saying yes and making mis
takes. As children we were likely
much more unfettered than we are
now, and we probably had a lot
more fun. Why not try to rekindle
some of those characteristics?

When we embrace
our mistakes, we
embrace being
human.
