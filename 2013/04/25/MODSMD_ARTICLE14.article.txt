# GROWING IN A MODERN WORLD
## A Healthier Fast Food Nation?
### Graciela Watrous 
Over the last several years,
fast food companies have be
gun to expand their product
portfolios to reflect a change in con
sumer taste. Some recent develop
ments include Burger King an
nouncing the production of a turkey
burger; Coca-Cola's acquisition of a
smoothie company called Innocent;
and McDonald's introduction of a
chicken wrap, a whole-wheat bun,
egg white McMuffm and certifica
tion of its fish products by the Ma
rine Stewardship Council. Chipotle,
meanwhile, has expanded its menu
to incorporate a tofu option, and
Taco Bell is attempting to reinvent
itself with a healthier image.
While the actual nutritional val
ue of these new products may be
questionable, such changes do sug
gest important underlying shifts in
American consumer preferences.
Large corporations follow markets,
and their movements can therefore
be away of tracking and quantify
ing social change.
Obviously large food corpora
tions don't change what they do for
moral reasons, so the changing
menus suggest that major food cor
porations have sensed that a grow
ing percentage of the general popu
lation wants cheap, healthy food.
But it is also possible that these cor
porations are simply tapping into a
new market of people who already
eat healthily, and they are just ex
panding their consumer base. And
lastly, it's possible that both of these
things are happening at once.
Some of the most recent evi
dence of a shift in marketing strate
gy comes from a Coca-Cola adver
tisement released in January 2013.
It shows the company's dedication
to nutrition by displaying its use of
less sugar and fewer calories in its
products. Many critics have called
this ad deceptive, claiming that it
aims to trick the public into think
ing that Coca-Cola products do not
play a large role in the obesity epi
demic sweeping the country.
What Coca-Cola marketed in its
ads does, in fact, contradict many of
its actions, and much of what the
company claims in its promotional
video is only part of the truth. But
Coca-Cola's revised market strate
gy, at its core, still shows that its
marketing team, at the very least,
acknowledges the population's
change in taste.
This change in taste suggests
that, collectively, consumers have
much more power than previously
recognized. A Hudson Institute
study released in February 2013
concluded that "between 2006 and
2011, lower-calorie foods and bever
ages were the key growth engine
for the restaurants studied." The
report considered restaurant
chains like Burger King, McDon
ald's, Applebee's, Wendy's, Taco
Bell and Chili's, among others.
To put it bluntly, fewer people
are eating French fries and more
people are drinking lower-calorie

beverages. All this is happening
while these restaurant chains in
crease their profits. And now, with
an upswing in the production of
cheaper yet healthier food, under
served populations previously
locked out of the health food market
by high prices may finally begin
to be able to afford healthy food.
This potential outshines the fact
that there is a surge in relatively
more expensive salad and health
food chains that most likely do not
market to or serve this population.
It's more important that the under
served have access to cheap,
healthy food than it is important
that relatively wealthier Americans
have access to a quicker salad.
Ultimately, the fact that major
food corporations can make money
off of lowering the calorie count in
foods is a good thing for the Ameri
can population (for all the obvious
reasons, including reducing obesity
to take the strain off the health care
system, increasing food choice and
redirecting American agriculture).
But important questions still re
quire further exploration: Is this
food in fact healthier? Do these
foods have the potential to decrease
obesity rates across the country?
Will costs for higher-end products
come down if the market for these
kinds of foods grows? And most im
portantly, are these changes
enough? (The answer to this final
question, by the way, is definitely
not. McDonald's still markets heav
ily to kids and Pepsi still sells drinks
with the same amount of sugar in
them as four slices of pie. And some
of these new products have more
calories in them than staple prod
ucts.)
But still, in this information lies
hope. Perhaps the most encourag
ing is that it suggests a sort of eat
ing democracy, and that the chang
ing needs of the American people
can have a direct influence on cor
porate existence. We can only hope
that these changes signal that the
American population has decided to
put health on its decision agenda,
and that in a rare moment of re
sponsiveness, corporations have de
cided to listen.

don't change what
they do for moral
