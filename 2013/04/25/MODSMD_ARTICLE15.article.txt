Stanford softball overpowered by Pacific 9-6

After shutting out Pacific (28-22, 12-6 Big
West) in early March, No. 15 Stanford softball
(29-16, 6-9 Pac-12) fell to Pacific 9-6 in
Wednesday night's midweek road game.
Senior Teagan Gerhart was uncharacteris
tically shaky on the mound, giving up five
earned runs on eight hits in 3.2 innings of
work. Her freshman counterpart, Kelsey
Stevens, didn't fare much better when she
came in the fourth inning for relief duty, allow
ing four earned runs in picking up her eighth
loss of the year.
Pacific's bats were alive right from the be
ginning, with third baseman Taylor Petty's
two-run home run off Gerhart giving the
Tigers an early 2-0 lead. The Cardinal struck
back in the top of the third when sophomore
leftfielder Leah White plated three runs with
a monster shot to right field.
But the Tigers knotted the score at three

in the next frame before putting the game
away by scoring three runs each in the fifth
and sixth innings.
It looked as if Stanford would mount a ral
ly in the top of the sixth when sophomore Erin
Ashby hit a three-run homer, but the Cardinal
couldn't carry its momentum into the final in
ning to complete the comeback.
Stanford jumps back into Pac-12 play this
weekend, hosting Utah for a three-game se
ries.

Sophomore leftfielder Leah White (above) gave her team a burst of energy in the top of
the third with a three-run homer, but her efforts weren't enough in Stanford's 9-6 loss.
The Houston native has
made his presence known on
Friday nights three of his
nine starts so far resulted in
complete games. Appel, a
preseason Ail-American, is
7-2 on the season with a
1.54 ERA. The righthander
has been unhittable at
times, tallying a confer
ence-leading 84 strikeouts
while giving up just one
home run in over 70 innings
pitched.
The winner of the Senior
CLASS Award will be an
nounced in late June, at the
College World Series in Oma
ha.
