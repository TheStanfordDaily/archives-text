## Team maps Grand Tour of Europe Researchers aim to expand academic field by visualizing travelers interactions

Networking, in its modern form, may be no
stranger to Stanford faculty and students. A ground
breaking new digital humanities project, however,
aims to explore the networking of the 18th century,
delving into the routes, people and places that made
up the Grand Tom' of Europe.
The project's researchers, led by Associate Pro
fessor of Classics Giovanna Ceserani, have worked
for five years to discover the networks and patterns
presented by the Tour, an educational rite of passage
taken in the 18th century by male aristocratic stu
dents and their entourages to widen their under
standing of topics they learned about in secondary
school, such as art, culture and architecture.
The project to digitally map this intellectual jour
ney began after Ceserani and some colleagues at
tended a conference on mapping the Republic of
Letters, a century-long phenomenon of intellectual
correspondence in Europe that existed from rough
ly 1400 to 1800.
Shortly after an initial meeting about the umbrel
la project Mapping the Republic of Letters
with Dan Edelstein, professor of French, and Paula
Findlen, professor of history, Ceserani began work
on her specific case study: The Grand Tour of Italy.
"We thought that it would be nice to explore this
information... in a geographical way, to map the in
formation and look for patterns," said Sarah Murray,
a graduate student in classics and researcher for the
Grand Tom' Traveler's project.
Their research has led them to discover patterns
such as increased travel to Sicily as the 18th century
progressed and variations in the travel patterns of dif
ferent professions, such as merchants traveling to
poits.
"The purpose was to see the parts of the Grand
Tour that are hidden from traditional scholarship,"
Murray said. "What are the patterns overall and who
are the people we don't usually hear much about?"
In answering that question, researchers relied ex
tensively on the "Dictionary of British and Irish Trav
elers to Italy, 1701-1800," a dictionary that includes the
identities of over 6,000 Grand Tom' travelers.
"There is this unbalance of attributing the impor
tance of this phenomenon to affecting a large num
ber of people but then the account of the phenome

non is still based on the few most prominent individ
uals," Ceserani said, claiming that traditional ac
counts of the Grand Tom 1 tend to focus on the most
famous or wealthy travelers. "A challenge for us now
is to think of visualizations that will account for all of
these other people who were part of the phenome
non but for whom we can't trace a complete route."
As her research ventures into uncharted intellec
tual territory, Ceserani acknowledged the difficulty
in mapping out the distinct academic and geograph
ic routes of each traveler.
"It's a chance for us to tell a story which keeps
present how much is always missing from any story
we tell about the past," Ceserani said. "We want all
of these 6,000 people to be there, but some of them
are only a name and a place."
As the project progressed, Ceserani and her re
searchers have addressed an evolving set of ques
tions.
"When we started putting more than one person
on the map... it became about how the people inter
acted in networks and now a lot of the project is about
networks and 'who met whom?"' Ceserani said.
Approaching those questions most recently took
the form of focusing specifically on the role and trav
els of architects during the Grand Tour.
"We are building a story that becomes a story of
architecture in the 18th century," she said. "It's a sto
ry of how networking changes."
A historical change that researchers noted
through their mapping was the shift from the travel
of prominent people who viewed architecture as a
