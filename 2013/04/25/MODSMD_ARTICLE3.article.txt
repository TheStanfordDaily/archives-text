## Team maps Grand Tour of Europe Researchers aim to expand academic field by visualizing travelers interactions 
### BRITTANY TORREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Networking, in its modern form, may be no
stranger to Stanford faculty and students. A ground
breaking new digital humanities project, however,
aims to explore the networking of the 18th century,
delving into the routes, people and places that made
up the Grand Tom' of Europe.
The project's researchers, led by Associate Pro
fessor of Classics Giovanna Ceserani, have worked
for five years to discover the networks and patterns
presented by the Tour, an educational rite of passage
taken in the 18th century by male aristocratic stu
dents and their entourages to widen their under
standing of topics they learned about in secondary
school, such as art, culture and architecture.
The project to digitally map this intellectual jour
ney began after Ceserani and some colleagues at
tended a conference on mapping the Republic of
Letters, a century-long phenomenon of intellectual
correspondence in Europe that existed from rough
ly 1400 to 1800.
Shortly after an initial meeting about the umbrel
la project Mapping the Republic of Letters
with Dan Edelstein, professor of French, and Paula
Findlen, professor of history, Ceserani began work
on her specific case study: The Grand Tour of Italy.
"We thought that it would be nice to explore this
information... in a geographical way, to map the in
formation and look for patterns," said Sarah Murray,
a graduate student in classics and researcher for the
Grand Tom' Traveler's project.
Their research has led them to discover patterns
such as increased travel to Sicily as the 18th century
progressed and variations in the travel patterns of dif
ferent professions, such as merchants traveling to
poits.
"The purpose was to see the parts of the Grand
Tour that are hidden from traditional scholarship,"
Murray said. "What are the patterns overall and who
are the people we don't usually hear much about?"
In answering that question, researchers relied ex
tensively on the "Dictionary of British and Irish Trav
elers to Italy, 1701-1800," a dictionary that includes the
identities of over 6,000 Grand Tom' travelers.
"There is this unbalance of attributing the impor
tance of this phenomenon to affecting a large num
ber of people but then the account of the phenome

non is still based on the few most prominent individ
uals," Ceserani said, claiming that traditional ac
counts of the Grand Tom 1 tend to focus on the most
famous or wealthy travelers. "A challenge for us now
is to think of visualizations that will account for all of
these other people who were part of the phenome
non but for whom we can't trace a complete route."
As her research ventures into uncharted intellec
tual territory, Ceserani acknowledged the difficulty
in mapping out the distinct academic and geograph
ic routes of each traveler.
"It's a chance for us to tell a story which keeps
present how much is always missing from any story
we tell about the past," Ceserani said. "We want all
of these 6,000 people to be there, but some of them
are only a name and a place."
As the project progressed, Ceserani and her re
searchers have addressed an evolving set of ques
tions.
"When we started putting more than one person
on the map... it became about how the people inter
acted in networks and now a lot of the project is about
networks and 'who met whom?"' Ceserani said.
Approaching those questions most recently took
the form of focusing specifically on the role and trav
els of architects during the Grand Tour.
"We are building a story that becomes a story of
architecture in the 18th century," she said. "It's a sto
ry of how networking changes."
A historical change that researchers noted
through their mapping was the shift from the travel
of prominent people who viewed architecture as a

neyed to Italy under travel
fellowships from a university.
"By the very end of the
century, Cambridge started
giving fellowships and it's a
very different type of travel
and the networks are very dif
ferent," Ceserani said.
"Here we see how this
travel is not only about learn
ing about the past but estab
lishing contacts that will help
you," she added. "It's social
networking basically that
helps you."

A broader impact
Ceserani emphasized the
project's broader academic
impact, noting that it had even
inspired a Thinking Matters
course THINK 29: Net

works: Ecological, Revolution
ary, Digital taught in part
by Edelstein.
"Something that is so im
portant to convey is... the tru
ly collaborative nature of the
project," said Nicole Coleman,
a technology specialist with
the project.
Coleman acknowledged
the challenges of interpreting
the data on hand and present
ing it appropriately
"It's kind of a dance be
tween the questions we want
to ask and the data that we
have to work with and figuring
out between those two what
we can do," Coleman said.
'And then we figure out what
visualization techniques we
can use that will best leverage
the data that's available."
Coleman suggested that
although these visualization
tools may not be fully function
al at this stage in the project,
they have led regardless to im
portant discoveries about data

modeling.
"The idea is that these are
tools for data discovery," she
said. "Having a visualization
as an outcome is not necessar
ily the end goal."
Eliza Lupone 'l5, a re
search assistant on the proj
ect, said that she decided to
join Ceserani's team because
she was interested in the op
portunity to apply quantifiable
research to the humanities.
"One of the reasons that I
was so drawn to the project
was that we live in Silicon Val
ley and we hear Big Data
thrown around by so many
people, but I never really
thought that it could apply to
the humanities," Lupone said.
"What's important is not let

that already exist, but think

taken in the 18th century by male aristocratic stu
dents and their entourages to widen their under
standing of topics they learned about in secondary
school, such as art, culture and architecture.
The project to digitally map this intellectual jour
ney began after Ceserani and some colleagues at
tended a conference on mapping the Republic of
Letters, a century-long phenomenon of intellectual
correspondence in Europe that existed from rough
ly 1400 to 1800.
Shortly after an initial meeting about the umbrel
la project Mapping the Republic of Letters
with Dan Edelstein, professor of French, and Paula
Findlen, professor of history, Ceserani began work
on her specific case study: The Grand Tour of Italy.
"We thought that it would be nice to explore this
information... in a geographical way, to map the in
formation and look for patterns," said Sarah Murray,
a graduate student in classics and researcher for the
Grand Tom' Traveler's project.
Their research has led them to discover patterns
such as increased travel to Sicily as the 18th century
progressed and variations in the travel patterns of dif
ferent professions, such as merchants traveling to
poits.
"The purpose was to see the parts of the Grand
Tour that are hidden from traditional scholarship,"
Murray said. "What are the patterns overall and who
are the people we don't usually hear much about?"
In answering that question, researchers relied ex
tensively on the "Dictionary of British and Irish Trav
elers to Italy, 1701-1800," a dictionary that includes the
identities of over 6,000 Grand Tom' travelers.
"There is this unbalance of attributing the impor
tance of this phenomenon to affecting a large num
ber of people but then the account of the phenome

non is still based on the few most prominent individ
uals," Ceserani said, claiming that traditional ac
counts of the Grand Tom 1 tend to focus on the most
famous or wealthy travelers. "A challenge for us now
is to think of visualizations that will account for all of
these other people who were part of the phenome
non but for whom we can't trace a complete route."
As her research ventures into uncharted intellec
tual territory, Ceserani acknowledged the difficulty
in mapping out the distinct academic and geograph
ic routes of each traveler.
"It's a chance for us to tell a story which keeps
present how much is always missing from any story
we tell about the past," Ceserani said. "We want all
of these 6,000 people to be there, but some of them
are only a name and a place."
As the project progressed, Ceserani and her re
searchers have addressed an evolving set of ques
tions.
"When we started putting more than one person
on the map... it became about how the people inter
acted in networks and now a lot of the project is about
networks and 'who met whom?"' Ceserani said.
Approaching those questions most recently took
the form of focusing specifically on the role and trav
els of architects during the Grand Tour.
"We are building a story that becomes a story of
architecture in the 18th century," she said. "It's a sto
ry of how networking changes."
A historical change that researchers noted
through their mapping was the shift from the travel
of prominent people who viewed architecture as a

neyed to Italy under travel
fellowships from a university.
"By the very end of the
century, Cambridge started
giving fellowships and it's a
very different type of travel
and the networks are very dif
ferent," Ceserani said.
"Here we see how this
travel is not only about learn
ing about the past but estab
lishing contacts that will help
you," she added. "It's social
networking basically that
helps you."

A broader impact
Ceserani emphasized the
project's broader academic
impact, noting that it had even
inspired a Thinking Matters
course THINK 29: Net

works: Ecological, Revolution
ary, Digital taught in part
by Edelstein.
"Something that is so im
portant to convey is... the tru
ly collaborative nature of the
project," said Nicole Coleman,
a technology specialist with
the project.
Coleman acknowledged
the challenges of interpreting
the data on hand and present
ing it appropriately
"It's kind of a dance be
tween the questions we want
to ask and the data that we
have to work with and figuring
out between those two what
we can do," Coleman said.
'And then we figure out what
visualization techniques we
can use that will best leverage
the data that's available."
Coleman suggested that
although these visualization
tools may not be fully function
al at this stage in the project,
they have led regardless to im
portant discoveries about data

modeling.
"The idea is that these are
tools for data discovery," she
said. "Having a visualization
as an outcome is not necessar
ily the end goal."
Eliza Lupone 'l5, a re
search assistant on the proj
ect, said that she decided to
join Ceserani's team because
she was interested in the op
portunity to apply quantifiable
research to the humanities.
"One of the reasons that I
was so drawn to the project
was that we live in Silicon Val
ley and we hear Big Data
thrown around by so many
people, but I never really
thought that it could apply to
the humanities," Lupone said.
"What's important is not let
ting us be limited by the tools
that already exist, but think
ing about how we can build
new ones."

Networking, in its modern form, may be no
stranger to Stanford faculty and students. A ground
breaking new digital humanities project, however,
aims to explore the networking of the 18th century,
delving into the routes, people and places that made
up the Grand Tom' of Europe.
The project's researchers, led by Associate Pro
fessor of Classics Giovanna Ceserani, have worked
for five years to discover the networks and patterns
presented by the Tour, an educational rite of passage
taken in the 18th century by male aristocratic stu
dents and their entourages to widen their under
