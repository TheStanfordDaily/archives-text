## Students search for marrow donor Professor's battle with leukeumia inspires efforts 
### NIUNIU TE'O CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With just seven weeks left before
Nalini Ambady, professor of psychology,
goes through another round of
leukemia-induced chemotherapy, a team
of students, colleagues and peers have
come together in an international effort
to find a bone marrow donor before
then.
"Right now, the cancer is technically
in remission, but it's not a long term so
lution," said Taylor Phillips, a second
year doctoral student. "In a few months
it will probably come back, and she'll
have to do chemo again, and that cycle
would just continue forever. So, it would
be best if we could find a match within
that time frame, because it's best to
have a bone marrow transplant when
your body's healthy."
Ambady is South Asian, which
means her match most likely will be
South Asian as well. However, matches
can only be found from the pool of regis
tered donors who have submitted their
DNA through a cheek swab and entered
it into the registry.
Unfortunately, South Asians are "not
just underrepresented [in the registry],
but underrepresented even in terms of
how many you'd expect there to be, tak
ing into account their being a minority,"
according to Phillips. To address that,
Ambady's students have created a
worldwide effort to register more peo
ple, focusing on the South Asian demo
graphic.
Ambady was unavailable for an in
terview.
"We were at both days of Holi doing
drives," Phillips said. "We actually got
400 people registered, and almost all of
them were South Asian, so that was
pretty amazing."
The students' efforts, from hosting
registration drives to starting initiatives
in India, have attracted international
media attention for their use of the In
ternet and social media.
"We've had NBC and CBS Bay Area
come and talk to us, there've been arti
cles in the Wall Street Journal, and
there are a few newspapers in India,"
Phillips said. "I think the big thing is the
fact that social media exists, which
makes it a lot easier for almost anyone
to have a big campaign."
The effort's leaders emphasized the
value of online coordination.
"It's pretty amazing how all the peo
ple are putting all the efforts together,
from all the places," said Fiona Lee, a
first year doctoral student. "We did a lot
of drives on campus, her colleagues are
doing it there and we're collaborating."
"We have a website where people
can find details about how to help, regis
ter for free and help host a drive. They
can also just spread the word, which is
the big thing for us," Phillips added.
"We also have a Facebook page, a Twit
ter account and this great informative
You Tube channel that explains the
whole process."
Students have focused them efforts

primarily on spreading awareness, ar
guing that common misconceptions
about the donation process have hin
dered registration efforts.
"There's this big myth around bone
marrow donation. A lot of people think it
involves this crazy needle being stuck
into your hip or something like that,
which is how it used to be," Phillips said.
"It still is, a small percent of the time,
but almost all the time it's just a simple
blood transfusion process."
Continuing on
When Ambady relapsed in Novem
ber, many of her students were caught
by surprise.
"It was kind of really shocking," said
Rachel Grunwald, who was an under
graduate at Tufts with Ambady and who
helps oversee the effort's website. "But
it's almost been kind of amazing, to see
how strong she's been through this en
tire thing."
According to her students, it's been
business as usual for Ambady.
"When we went to the hospital for
the first time, [Ambady] was like 'Oh, I
have leukemia, but it's fine, just keep
calling me and come see me. We'll just
have lab meetings at the hospital, it's
fine,"' Grunwald recalled.
The lab has continued to run its nor
mal hours, with Ambady's students sim
ply integrating the recent cause into
their everyday lives.
"We've still continued to do research,
so we've been having lab meetings still,"
Phillips said. "It was recently Dr. Am
bady's birthday, so we had hats and
cakes and all that stuff. I think we are
definitely coming together."
"She's been helping me through grad
school, and she's always there for re
search questions. She's done that for so
many people, so it's such an easy situa
tion," Phillips reminisced. "We find a
match, and things will work out. So if
the solution's there, and it's so easy to
do, even if it's time consuming, why
would someone not do it?"
Some students have found overlaps
between then- research and their efforts
to recruit potential bone marrow donors.
"We're in way over our heads for all
the PR stuff and the website," Grun
wald said. "The one thing that's kind of
funny is that we're all social psycholo
gists, so we've been thinking about how
you encourage people to contribute to a
cause, and how you convince someone.
So that's one aspect where we feel like
we have some knowledge to bring to the
situation."
Future efforts will include a "Save-A-
Thon" competition, to be held at the
d.school on Saturday, and other pro
gramming both on campus and interna
tionally.
"I'm super optimistic that we will
continue getting even more traffic,"
Phillips said. "If cat videos can go viral,
then a Nalini video that is important and
meaningful can go viral."

"There's this big myth around bone
marrow donation. A lot of people think it
involves this crazy needle being stuck
into your hip or something like that,
which is how it used to be," Phillips said.
"It still is, a small percent of the time,
but almost all the time it's just a simple
blood transfusion process."

When Ambady relapsed in Novem
ber, many of her students were caught
by surprise.
"It was kind of really shocking," said
Rachel Grunwald, who was an under
graduate at Tufts with Ambady and who
helps oversee the effort's website. "But
it's almost been kind of amazing, to see
how strong she's been through this en
tire thing."
According to her students, it's been
business as usual for Ambady.
"When we went to the hospital for
the first time, [Ambady] was like 'Oh, I
have leukemia, but it's fine, just keep
calling me and come see me. We'll just
have lab meetings at the hospital, it's
fine,"' Grunwald recalled.
The lab has continued to run its nor
mal hours, with Ambady's students sim
ply integrating the recent cause into
their everyday lives.
"We've still continued to do research,
so we've been having lab meetings still,"
Phillips said. "It was recently Dr. Am
bady's birthday, so we had hats and
cakes and all that stuff. I think we are
definitely coming together."
"She's been helping me through grad
school, and she's always there for re
search questions. She's done that for so
many people, so it's such an easy situa
tion," Phillips reminisced. "We find a
match, and things will work out. So if
the solution's there, and it's so easy to
do, even if it's time consuming, why
would someone not do it?"
Some students have found overlaps
between then- research and their efforts
to recruit potential bone marrow donors.
"We're in way over our heads for all
the PR stuff and the website," Grun
wald said. "The one thing that's kind of
funny is that we're all social psycholo
gists, so we've been thinking about how
you encourage people to contribute to a
cause, and how you convince someone.
So that's one aspect where we feel like
we have some knowledge to bring to the
situation."
Future efforts will include a "Save-A-
Thon" competition, to be held at the
d.school on Saturday, and other pro
gramming both on campus and interna
tionally.
"I'm super optimistic that we will
continue getting even more traffic,"
Phillips said. "If cat videos can go viral,
then a Nalini video that is important and
meaningful can go viral."

With just seven weeks left before
Nalini Ambady, professor of psychology,
goes through another round of
leukemia-induced chemotherapy, a team
of students, colleagues and peers have
come together in an international effort
to find a bone marrow donor before
then.
"Right now, the cancer is technically
in remission, but it's not a long term so
lution," said Taylor Phillips, a second
year doctoral student. "In a few months
it will probably come back, and she'll
have to do chemo again, and that cycle
would just continue forever. So, it would
be best if we could find a match within
that time frame, because it's best to
have a bone marrow transplant when
your body's healthy."
Ambady is South Asian, which
means her match most likely will be
South Asian as well. However, matches
can only be found from the pool of regis
tered donors who have submitted their
DNA through a cheek swab and entered
it into the registry.
Unfortunately, South Asians are "not
just underrepresented [in the registry],
but underrepresented even in terms of
how many you'd expect there to be, tak
ing into account their being a minority,"
according to Phillips. To address that,
Ambady's students have created a
worldwide effort to register more peo
ple, focusing on the South Asian demo
graphic.
Ambady was unavailable for an in
terview.
"We were at both days of Holi doing
drives," Phillips said. "We actually got
400 people registered, and almost all of
them were South Asian, so that was
pretty amazing."
The students' efforts, from hosting
registration drives to starting initiatives
in India, have attracted international
media attention for their use of the In
ternet and social media.
"We've had NBC and CBS Bay Area
come and talk to us, there've been arti
cles in the Wall Street Journal, and
there are a few newspapers in India,"
Phillips said. "I think the big thing is the
fact that social media exists, which
makes it a lot easier for almost anyone
to have a big campaign."
The effort's leaders emphasized the
value of online coordination.
"It's pretty amazing how all the peo
ple are putting all the efforts together,
from all the places," said Fiona Lee, a
first year doctoral student. "We did a lot
of drives on campus, her colleagues are
doing it there and we're collaborating."
"We have a website where people
can find details about how to help, regis
ter for free and help host a drive. They
can also just spread the word, which is
the big thing for us," Phillips added.
"We also have a Facebook page, a Twit
ter account and this great informative
You Tube channel that explains the
whole process."
Students have focused them efforts

primarily on spreading awareness, ar
guing that common misconceptions
about the donation process have hin
dered registration efforts.
"There's this big myth around bone
marrow donation. A lot of people think it
involves this crazy needle being stuck
