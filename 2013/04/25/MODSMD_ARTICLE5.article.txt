# Anthropology prof, explores evolution

### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many, childhood dreams fade in
to obscurity over time. For some others,
however, those ambitions and aspira
tions remain as fresh as ever, becoming
the compasses guiding their lives.
Richard Klein, professor of anthro
pology, may fall into the latter category,
with an affinity for paleoanthropology
the study of evolution through fossils
and artifacts that began when he was
a fifth-grader living in the suburbs of
Chicago.
"They would pack kids on the school
bus once or twice a year, and take us into
the museums in Chicago," Klein recalled.
"One of them was called the Field Muse
um of Natural History. They had these
wonderful diagrams of ancient people
sitting around a campfire... and arti
facts. I thought it was very interesting."
Initially, however, Klein believed that
the study of fossil forms was something
he would outgrow and refrained from
taking a related course until later in his

undergraduate ca
reer at the University
of Michigan.
"I didn't know
much about the subject
except that it had inter
ested me a long time
ago," he confessed.
During a summer
as a graduate student

at the University of Chicago, Klein em
barked upon his first excavation, spend
ing four months in Spain "excavating a
500,000-year-old site with hand axes and
elephant bones."
His stint in Spain was just the start
of an archeological career that would
span the globe, with experiences rang
ing from bleak winters and citizen's ar
rests in St. Petersburg to beautiful
wildlife safaris in South Africa's Kruger
National Park, all in the pursuit of bones
and artifacts.

Klein's proficiency in Russian led to
his choice of artifacts from Russia
then the Soviet Union as the focus of
his doctoral degree. He also spent time

in France and Yugoslavia and currently
spends his summers doing fieldwork in
South Africa, where he has worked since
1969.
"I go there every summer and I dig
up some old bones and artifacts," he
said. "I'm mostly interested in bones
I would love to find human ones, but that
seems to be not my luck."
Through his research, Klein devel
oped a special interest in different kinds
of antelopes, the animals most abundant
ly represented in the sites he has exca
vated. His work offers much of the infor
mation gathered to date, for example, on
the habits and environments of the Blue
Antelope, which became extinct in the
1870s.
"It's not the center of my research,
but I find it very interesting... I'm a
kind of an antelope specialist, I guess,"
Klein said.
In addition to travelling and teach
ing, Klein has also written several books
about his research, producing among


Richard Klein
other works an evolution
ary theory grounded in his
study of Neanderthal arti
facts.
"I've been mainly inter
ested in the last 200,000
years, when people who
looked and behaved like we
do emerged," Klein said. "We
know they emerged in Africa
first, and were confined there
until perhaps 50,000 years
ago when they moved from
Africa and replaced other
kinds of people elsewhere,
like the Neanderthals from
Europe... in probably just a
few thousand years... I'm in
terested in trying to find out
why that happened."
Klein disputed the widely
accepted rationale for hu
manity's spread, which em
phasizes the development of
sexual divisions of labor and a
resultantly different econom
ic system.
"This makes no sense to
me there is no evidence for
population increase," he
added. "The major alterna
tive, and the one that I be
lieve, is that there was genetic
or genomic change in Africa."
Klein acknowledged a
lack of support for his hy
pothesis.

"It's not a popular idea,"
he conceded. "To some peo
ple it almost seems like some
kind of intellectual Nazism
like you're suggesting people
before 50,000 years ago were
not human. I'm not. We know
that over the course of evolu
tion, there's been a huge
amount of genetic change.
We start with people with
brains one-third the size of
ours, and then we have us.
That's not population in
crease, that's genes."
Klein expressed opti
mism, however, that modern
science's ability to compare
Neanderthal and modern
genes might offer a conclu
sive resolution.
Since he arrived on the
Farm in 1993, Klein has
taught HUMBIO 2B: Cul
ture, Evolution, and Society
every fall. He also teaches
specialized courses on human
evolution, which used to at
tract more than 100 students
before the rise of more "tech
nical" subjects caused inter
ests to taper out.
"Two or three years ago,
the demand dropped precipi
tously, as it has for all more
liberal-arts type classes...
The students are more inter
ested now on coursework
that will help them in their fu
ture life," he said. "I some
times think that it would be
better if students came to
Stanford when they were 30."

Klein described the listing
of his courses under the an
thropology department as
"awkward," saying that most
interested students have no
intention of pursuing the ma
jor.
"In anthropology, they
think the courses on evolution
are too scientific and they're
more into interpretive work,"
he said. "Then you go to biolo
gy, and they don't think it's
scientific enough."
This ambiguity surround
ing the classification of evolu
tion classes has not, however,
deterred the enthusiasm for
the students who do enroll.
Tim Weaver M.A. '9B Ph.D.
'O2 recalled that "it was fun"
to be Klein's student, empha
sizing Klein's scientific in
tegrity.
"I certainly learned a lot
from him, not only about the
field of paleoanthropology,
but also about how to conduct
myself as a scientist," he said.
Ann Horsburgh Ph.D. 'OB
echoed Weaver's sentiments.
"My favorite thing about
Richard as a scientist, is that
nothing matters more than the
work," she said. "His integrity
is absolute. He takes a real in
terest in his students and con
cerns himself with their well
being, as well is with the qual
ity of their work."

ture life," he said. "I some
times think that it would be
better if students came to
Stanford when they were 30."

Klein described the listing
of his courses under the an
thropology department as
"awkward," saying that most
interested students have no
intention of pursuing the ma
jor.
"In anthropology, they
think the courses on evolution
are too scientific and they're
more into interpretive work,"
he said. "Then you go to biolo
gy, and they don't think it's
scientific enough."
This ambiguity surround
ing the classification of evolu
tion classes has not, however,
deterred the enthusiasm for
the students who do enroll.
Tim Weaver M.A. '9B Ph.D.
'O2 recalled that "it was fun"
to be Klein's student, empha
sizing Klein's scientific in
tegrity.
"I certainly learned a lot
from him, not only about the
field of paleoanthropology,
but also about how to conduct
myself as a scientist," he said.
Ann Horsburgh Ph.D. 'OB
echoed Weaver's sentiments.
"My favorite thing about
Richard as a scientist, is that
nothing matters more than the
work," she said. "His integrity
is absolute. He takes a real in
terest in his students and con
cerns himself with their well
being, as well is with the qual
ity of their work."

For many, childhood dreams fade in
to obscurity over time. For some others,
however, those ambitions and aspira
tions remain as fresh as ever, becoming
the compasses guiding their lives.
Richard Klein, professor of anthro
pology, may fall into the latter category,
with an affinity for paleoanthropology
the study of evolution through fossils
and artifacts that began when he was
a fifth-grader living in the suburbs of
Chicago.
"They would pack kids on the school
bus once or twice a year, and take us into
the museums in Chicago," Klein recalled.
"One of them was called the Field Muse
um of Natural History. They had these
wonderful diagrams of ancient people
sitting around a campfire... and arti
facts. I thought it was very interesting."
Initially, however, Klein believed that
the study of fossil forms was something
he would outgrow and refrained from
taking a related course until later in his

undergraduate ca
reer at the University
of Michigan.
"I didn't know
much about the subject
except that it had inter
ested me a long time
ago," he confessed.
During a summer
as a graduate student

at the University of Chicago, Klein em
barked upon his first excavation, spend
ing four months in Spain "excavating a
500,000-year-old site with hand axes and
elephant bones."
His stint in Spain was just the start
of an archeological career that would
span the globe, with experiences rang
ing from bleak winters and citizen's ar
rests in St. Petersburg to beautiful
wildlife safaris in South Africa's Kruger
National Park, all in the pursuit of bones
and artifacts.

Klein's proficiency in Russian led to
his choice of artifacts from Russia
then the Soviet Union as the focus of
his doctoral degree. He also spent time

in France and Yugoslavia and currently
spends his summers doing fieldwork in
South Africa, where he has worked since
1969.
"I go there every summer and I dig
up some old bones and artifacts," he
said. "I'm mostly interested in bones
I would love to find human ones, but that
seems to be not my luck."
Through his research, Klein devel
oped a special interest in different kinds
of antelopes, the animals most abundant
ly represented in the sites he has exca
vated. His work offers much of the infor
mation gathered to date, for example, on
the habits and environments of the Blue
Antelope, which became extinct in the
1870s.
"It's not the center of my research,
but I find it very interesting... I'm a
kind of an antelope specialist, I guess,"
Klein said.
In addition to travelling and teach
ing, Klein has also written several books
about his research, producing among


Richard Klein
other works an evolution
ary theory grounded in his
study of Neanderthal arti
facts.
"I've been mainly inter
ested in the last 200,000
years, when people who
looked and behaved like we
do emerged," Klein said. "We
know they emerged in Africa
first, and were confined there
until perhaps 50,000 years
ago when they moved from
Africa and replaced other
kinds of people elsewhere,
like the Neanderthals from
Europe... in probably just a
few thousand years... I'm in
terested in trying to find out
why that happened."
Klein disputed the widely
accepted rationale for hu
manity's spread, which em
phasizes the development of
sexual divisions of labor and a
resultantly different econom
ic system.
"This makes no sense to
me there is no evidence for
population increase," he
added. "The major alterna
tive, and the one that I be
lieve, is that there was genetic
or genomic change in Africa."
Klein acknowledged a
lack of support for his hy
pothesis.

"It's not a popular idea,"
he conceded. "To some peo
ple it almost seems like some
kind of intellectual Nazism
like you're suggesting people
before 50,000 years ago were
not human. I'm not. We know
that over the course of evolu
tion, there's been a huge
amount of genetic change.
We start with people with
brains one-third the size of
ours, and then we have us.
That's not population in
crease, that's genes."
Klein expressed opti
mism, however, that modern
science's ability to compare
Neanderthal and modern
genes might offer a conclu
sive resolution.
Since he arrived on the
Farm in 1993, Klein has
taught HUMBIO 2B: Cul
ture, Evolution, and Society
every fall. He also teaches
specialized courses on human
evolution, which used to at
tract more than 100 students
before the rise of more "tech
nical" subjects caused inter
ests to taper out.
"Two or three years ago,
the demand dropped precipi
tously, as it has for all more
liberal-arts type classes...
The students are more inter
ested now on coursework
that will help them in their fu
ture life," he said. "I some
times think that it would be
better if students came to
Stanford when they were 30."
