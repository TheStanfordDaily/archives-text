For many, childhood dreams fade in
to obscurity over time. For some others,
however, those ambitions and aspira
tions remain as fresh as ever, becoming
the compasses guiding their lives.
Richard Klein, professor of anthro
pology, may fall into the latter category,
with an affinity for paleoanthropology
the study of evolution through fossils
and artifacts that began when he was
a fifth-grader living in the suburbs of
Chicago.
"They would pack kids on the school
bus once or twice a year, and take us into
the museums in Chicago," Klein recalled.
"One of them was called the Field Muse
um of Natural History. They had these
wonderful diagrams of ancient people
sitting around a campfire... and arti
facts. I thought it was very interesting."
Initially, however, Klein believed that
the study of fossil forms was something
he would outgrow and refrained from
taking a related course until later in his

undergraduate ca
reer at the University
of Michigan.
"I didn't know
much about the subject
except that it had inter
ested me a long time
ago," he confessed.
During a summer
as a graduate student

at the University of Chicago, Klein em
barked upon his first excavation, spend
ing four months in Spain "excavating a
500,000-year-old site with hand axes and
elephant bones."
His stint in Spain was just the start
of an archeological career that would
span the globe, with experiences rang
ing from bleak winters and citizen's ar
rests in St. Petersburg to beautiful
wildlife safaris in South Africa's Kruger
National Park, all in the pursuit of bones
and artifacts.

Klein's proficiency in Russian led to
his choice of artifacts from Russia
then the Soviet Union as the focus of
his doctoral degree. He also spent time

in France and Yugoslavia and currently
spends his summers doing fieldwork in
South Africa, where he has worked since
1969.
"I go there every summer and I dig
up some old bones and artifacts," he
said. "I'm mostly interested in bones
I would love to find human ones, but that
seems to be not my luck."
Through his research, Klein devel
oped a special interest in different kinds
of antelopes, the animals most abundant
ly represented in the sites he has exca
vated. His work offers much of the infor
mation gathered to date, for example, on
the habits and environments of the Blue
Antelope, which became extinct in the
1870s.
"It's not the center of my research,
but I find it very interesting... I'm a
kind of an antelope specialist, I guess,"
Klein said.
In addition to travelling and teach
ing, Klein has also written several books
about his research, producing among
