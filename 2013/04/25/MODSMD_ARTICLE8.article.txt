## Headlines without headshots? 
### Joseph Beyda 
Everybody's new favorite
Shark is one hell of a ham
merhead. Few NHL play
ers hit like Raffi Tbrres.
Maybe it's his 6-foot, 225-
pound frame, or his puck-hawk in
stincts, or his penchant for throwing
an elbow eveiy time he checks an op
ponent, but he's the definition of a
hockey player that you hate playing
against —and you love to have skat
ing on your side. Plus, he just looks
mean.
He's known as one of the toughest
players in the game. He's also known
as one of the dirtiest.
In last year's playoffs, Torres
leapt off the ice to deliver a resound
ing blow to the head of Chicago for
ward Marian Hossa, a clearly illegal
hit that sent Hossa to the hospital and
earned Torres a 25-game suspension,
the third-longest ban in league histo
ry. Just a year earlier, Torres had
committed another head shot in the
postseason against the Blackhawks, so
he quickly built a reputation as a mali
cious player.
As webpages by fed-up opposing
fans sprung up last offseason explor
ing his history of dirty hits, Torres
strove to rework his bad-guy image;
that image, after all, was probably re
sponsible for the fact that he had been
shipped between six different NHL
teams in 11 years. But nonetheless, he
was moved yet again this month when
the Phoenix Coyotes sent him to my
San Jose Sharks in a trade for a third
round pick.
The Sharks, like any other West
ern Conference team, have a history
with Torres. With San Jose looking to
take a 2-0 series lead against the Ed
monton Oilers in the 2006 Western
Conference Semifinal, Torres deliv
ered a dirty hit on speedy Sharks
winger Milan Michalek, who missed
the next two games with injury.
Though San Jose did win game two,
the hit changed the momentum of the
series and the Oilers won the next four
contests, advancing 4-2.
With hits flying everywhere, hock
ey fans don't usually have the longest
of memories. But we Sharks fans are a
little different. We're going to the play
offs for the ninth straight year, and we
have consistently put one of the best
teams in the NHL out on the ice over
that stretch, but we've still never made
it to the Stanley Cup Finals. Postsea
son heartbreak lasts a lot longer for
those who wear teal.
So as you would expect, Torres
wasn't welcomed to San Jose with open
arms. "Sharks complete most awk
ward trade in history" read one fan
blog headline; "Sharks acquire Tbrres,
ruin trade deadline," cried another, ac
companied by the subhead: "Ugh."
It didn't take long for him to
change our minds. In his debut, a 54
loss at Dallas, Tones notched two as
sists and was arguably the Sharks'
best player on the ice. At home nine
days later, he scored the shootout-de
ciding goal against division rival L.A;
his two goals since then were both
skilled plays made on home ice.
In his nine games with San Jose,
Torres has contributed six points to go
along with only two minor penalties
heck, he only has 17 penalty minutes
all season. He's no longer booed at HP
Pavilion, and there's a pretty signifi
cant contingent of fans that wants the
team's management to resign Torres
after the season. But has he really
changed, or are Sharks fans just
subliminally pleased that players in
teal are no longer Torres' targets?
Personally, I'm not quite sold yet.
Don't get me wrong; Torres is one of
the greatest forecheckers I've ever
seen and has absolutely been an in
jection of energy in the Sharks' re
cent playoff push (12-4-1 in then 1 last
17 games).
But I want to see how he plays in
the postseason, where his most infa
mous hits have come in the past.
The Stanley Cup Playoffs bring an
entirely new level of intensity, espe
cially on an aging team whose fans
have come to expect a whole lot over
the last decade. If Torres can tem
per his physicality the way he has
over the last three weeks with San
Jose, then all, in my mind, is forgiv
en. If he makes head lines as a
head hunter for a third straight
postseason, though, I'm not sure
Torres' reputation will ever be re
covered, in San Jose or elsewhere.

Joseph Beyda has disregarded the
NBA Playoffs and NFL Draft to
morrow in the hopes of turning
everyone, into hockey fans. Let him

companied by the subhead: "Ugh."
It didn't take long for him to
change our minds. In his debut, a 54
loss at Dallas, Tones notched two as
sists and was arguably the Sharks'
best player on the ice. At home nine
days later, he scored the shootout-de
ciding goal against division rival L.A;
his two goals since then were both
skilled plays made on home ice.
In his nine games with San Jose,
Torres has contributed six points to go
along with only two minor penalties
heck, he only has 17 penalty minutes
all season. He's no longer booed at HP
Pavilion, and there's a pretty signifi
cant contingent of fans that wants the
team's management to resign Torres
after the season. But has he really
changed, or are Sharks fans just
subliminally pleased that players in
teal are no longer Torres' targets?
Personally, I'm not quite sold yet.
Don't get me wrong; Torres is one of
the greatest forecheckers I've ever
seen and has absolutely been an in
jection of energy in the Sharks' re
cent playoff push (12-4-1 in then 1 last
17 games).
But I want to see how he plays in
the postseason, where his most infa
mous hits have come in the past.
The Stanley Cup Playoffs bring an
entirely new level of intensity, espe
cially on an aging team whose fans
have come to expect a whole lot over
the last decade. If Torres can tem
per his physicality the way he has
over the last three weeks with San
Jose, then all, in my mind, is forgiv
en. If he makes head lines as a
head hunter for a third straight
postseason, though, I'm not sure
Torres' reputation will ever be re
covered, in San Jose or elsewhere.
