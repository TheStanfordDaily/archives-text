# TOP FINISH FOILED
## PAC-12 TITLE NOT MEANT TO BE 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's golf team
tied for fourth as play concluded
Wednesday at the Pac-12 Champi
onships hosted by UCLA at the Va
lencia Golf Course. The finish is the
highest for Stanford at the confer
ence tournament since the Cardinal
placed second in 2001.
After roughing up most of its
conference foes at the recent
PING/ASU Invitational, the team
was unable to replicate that per
formance at Pac-12s, especially in
rounds one and two. Stanford was
fifth after Monday's first round,
shooting a 10-over 298 as a team, al
ready 18 strokes behind No. 1
Southern California. Senior Sally
Watson lead the Cardinal in round
one, shooting 3-over on her first
nine but roaring back with a birdie
and eagle on the 13th and 15th
holes, respectively. Watson was lat
er named the Pac-12's Scholar Ath
lete of the Year.
Tuesday's second round saw a
return to normalcy for Stanford
with Mariah Stackhouse leading
the way. The freshman torched the
Valencia course, posting five birdies
to card a 5-under-par 67 tied for
the second-best score of the tourna
ment. With her first bogey-free col
legiate round, Stackhouse moved
into a tie for first in the individual
standings with the eventual confer
ence champion, USC's Annie Park,
at 4-under.

"My approach shots were great
Tuesday, and I was able to convert a
fair share of my birdie opportuni

ties as well as avoid bogeys," Stack
house said.
As for the team performance,
the Card improved on its Monday
score by two strokes yet slipped
from fifth to seventh in the team
standings. Watson struggled after
her solid round on Monday with an
8-over 80, and freshman Lauren
Kim saw her woes continue with a
6-over 78, leaving her at 11-over for
the tournament.
"I struggled with my feel, tempo
and rhythm the first two days,"
Kim remarked. "Coach [Walker]
and my dad helped me find my tem
po after Tuesday's post-round
range session and it completely

changed how I was hitting the ball
[Wednesday] I was hitting it
close and giving myself opportuni
ties to make birdie."
Indeed, Kim improved marked
ly in yesterday's final round, shoot
ing a 1-under 71, scattering five bo
geys with five birdies.
She was not the only Stanford
golfer to find her zone on Wednes
day, as it was sophomore Mariko
Tumangan who recorded the team's
low score for the day with a 2-under
70. Tumangan posted 3 birdies, in
cluding one on her final hole to
move into a tie for 14th in the indi
vidual race.
Stackhouse was still in con

tention with Park, USC's Sophia
Popov and Colorado's Jennifer
Coleman early in her round on
Wednesday, but bogeys on the
fourth and sixth hole followed by a
double-bogey on the par-3 seventh
ended the Cardinal freshman's
chances for what would have been
her 100 th lifetime victory. She end
ed up in a tie for third with Cole
man, shooting 1-over in the final
round.
"I feel like I had a great tourna
ment," Stackhouse said. "This was
my first ever Pac-12 Championship
and I placed in the top three. I had
