# DOUBLING DOWN

For most sibling pairs, it's
the older one that blazes
the trail for the younger to
follow. But for Cardinal
women's water polo play
ers Kaley and Cory Dodson, it was
actually Cory, who is a grade behind
Kaley in school, who led the push to
Stanford.

Cory said that she always wanted
to go to Stanford, and so when her
sister was deciding a year before
Cory would make her own choice,
Cory pushed Kaley towards the
Farm.
"She was set on Stanford it
was kind of up to me." Kaley, a cur
rent junior, remembered. "I was re
ally the one who was on the fence and
she was like, 'no, you have to go so
we can go to school together.'"
Kaley ultimately did choose Stan
ford and made an immediate contri
bution upon arriving on campus in
the fall of 2010. As a freshman, she
scored 27 goals and earned a spot on
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion All-Newcomer Team as the Car
dinal captured the national champi

onship for the second time in its his
tory.
Cory also fulfilled her "childhood
dream" and joined her sister on the
team last season. She tallied seven
goals, including three at the Nation
al Collegiate Championship, as Stan
ford successfully defended its nation
al title.
This year, Kaley has recorded 27

goals and Cory has scored 11 times
for a stacked Cardinal squad. The
team heads into the MPSF champi
onships this weekend with a 26-1
record and the top ranking in the na
tion.
Stanford head coach John Tanner
said that the Stanford water polo
program has a long history of having
sisters on the team. Last year, in ad

dition to the Dodsons, current junior
Kaitlyn Lo and her sister Alyssa'l2
played together for the Cardinal.
Tanner said that although he re
cruits every player as an individual,
he recognizes that within the same
household you can often find similar
positive traits, and the Dodsons are
no exception.
"They have a drive to excel and
are very intense competitors," Tan
ner said. "They're self-disciplined,
good students Cory and Kaley
certainly fit the Stanford profile."
Tanner also said that the team of
ten benefits from the similar ways in
which the sisters see the game.
"You see stuff where they just
connect on things," Tanner said.
"They are both really comfortable
with a dynamic style [so] as things
are changing, evolving during the
course of a possession, they seem to
maintain that unity."
That connection arises from
years of playing together. According
to the sisters, since they began play
ing, they have been on the same
team with the exception of every oth
er year in club although only a

year apart in school, the sis
ters are actually 19 months
apart in age. They also played
together for three years at
Los Alamitos High School in
Seal Beach, Calif.
"We've had the same
coaches so that kind of con
tributes to it," Cory said. "We
learned the same style of play
and we've learned each oth
er's tendencies."
While the sisters often ap
proach the game in the same
way, their physical styles are
different. Tanner described
Kaley as "long and really
fast," while Cory is a more
"tactical thinker" who has
"the view of a coach."
Despite hours in the pool to
gether the sisters say they rarely
compete with each other.
"I can think of very few
times when we've been com
petitive, which I think why
we've gotten along so well,"
Kaley said. "We have differ
ent strengths and weaknesses
and we've both succeeded in
different areas."
Out of the water, both sis
ters are quick to describe
each other as their best
friend.
"We kind of have each oth

er's backs and stick together
through everything," Cory
said. "We have each other's
backs out of the water and we
do it in the water and we have
a really strong relationship."

Both sisters also said that
the other is the first person
they turn to when they need
support, which is made easier
by the fact that they live in ad
jacent dorms in the Cowell
Cluster. Kaley said that when
she was younger, she appreci
ated her friendship with her
sister much less than she does
now.

"At the time, I wasn't like
'Oh, I'll die if I don't go to
school with Cory,' but now, I'd
die if I didn't go to school with
Cory," Kaley laughed.

"I don't know what I
would do either," Cory
agreed.
Tanner said that although
the sisters are certainly close,
they don't let their bond stop
them from connecting with
the rest of team.

"The strength of their re
lationship is a great example
for the whole team, but they
also realize the importance of
embracing all 21 people on the
team," Tanner said. "It's real
ly fun to watch them in the
water interacting during
practices and during games."

"I can think of very few
times when we've been com
petitive, which I think why
we've gotten along so well,"
Kaley said. "We have differ
ent strengths and weaknesses
and we've both succeeded in
different areas."
Out of the water, both sis
ters are quick to describe
each other as their best
friend.
"We kind of have each oth

through everything," Cory
said. "We have each other's
backs out of the water and we
do it in the water and we have
a really strong relationship."

Both sisters also said that
the other is the first person
they turn to when they need
support, which is made easier
by the fact that they live in ad

Cluster. Kaley said that when
she was younger, she appreci

sister much less than she does
now.

"At the time, I wasn't like
'Oh, I'll die if I don't go to
school with Cory,' but now, I'd
die if I didn't go to school with
Cory," Kaley laughed.

"I don't know what I
would do either," Cory
agreed.
Tanner said that although
the sisters are certainly close,

them from connecting with

"The strength of their re

for the whole team, but they
also realize the importance of
embracing all 21 people on the
team," Tanner said. "It's real

water interacting during
practices and during games."

For most sibling pairs, it's
the older one that blazes
the trail for the younger to
follow. But for Cardinal
women's water polo play
ers Kaley and Cory Dodson, it was
actually Cory, who is a grade behind
Kaley in school, who led the push to
Stanford.

Cory said that she always wanted
to go to Stanford, and so when her
sister was deciding a year before
Cory would make her own choice,
Cory pushed Kaley towards the
Farm.
"She was set on Stanford it
was kind of up to me." Kaley, a cur
rent junior, remembered. "I was re
ally the one who was on the fence and
she was like, 'no, you have to go so
we can go to school together.'"
Kaley ultimately did choose Stan
ford and made an immediate contri
bution upon arriving on campus in
the fall of 2010. As a freshman, she
scored 27 goals and earned a spot on
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion All-Newcomer Team as the Car
dinal captured the national champi

onship for the second time in its his
tory.
Cory also fulfilled her "childhood
dream" and joined her sister on the
team last season. She tallied seven
goals, including three at the Nation
al Collegiate Championship, as Stan
ford successfully defended its nation
al title.
This year, Kaley has recorded 27

goals and Cory has scored 11 times
for a stacked Cardinal squad. The
team heads into the MPSF champi
onships this weekend with a 26-1
record and the top ranking in the na
tion.
Stanford head coach John Tanner
said that the Stanford water polo
program has a long history of having
sisters on the team. Last year, in ad

dition to the Dodsons, current junior
Kaitlyn Lo and her sister Alyssa'l2
played together for the Cardinal.
Tanner said that although he re
cruits every player as an individual,
he recognizes that within the same
household you can often find similar
positive traits, and the Dodsons are
no exception.
"They have a drive to excel and
are very intense competitors," Tan
ner said. "They're self-disciplined,
good students Cory and Kaley
certainly fit the Stanford profile."
Tanner also said that the team of
ten benefits from the similar ways in
which the sisters see the game.
"You see stuff where they just
connect on things," Tanner said.
"They are both really comfortable
with a dynamic style [so] as things
are changing, evolving during the
course of a possession, they seem to
maintain that unity."
That connection arises from
years of playing together. According
to the sisters, since they began play
ing, they have been on the same
team with the exception of every oth
er year in club although only a

year apart in school, the sis
ters are actually 19 months
apart in age. They also played
together for three years at
Los Alamitos High School in
Seal Beach, Calif.
"We've had the same
coaches so that kind of con
tributes to it," Cory said. "We
learned the same style of play
and we've learned each oth
er's tendencies."
While the sisters often ap
proach the game in the same
way, their physical styles are
different. Tanner described
Kaley as "long and really
fast," while Cory is a more
"tactical thinker" who has
"the view of a coach."
Despite hours in the pool to
gether the sisters say they rarely
compete with each other.
"I can think of very few
