For most sibling pairs, it's
the older one that blazes
the trail for the younger to
follow. But for Cardinal
women's water polo play
ers Kaley and Cory Dodson, it was
actually Cory, who is a grade behind
Kaley in school, who led the push to
Stanford.

Cory said that she always wanted
to go to Stanford, and so when her
sister was deciding a year before
Cory would make her own choice,
Cory pushed Kaley towards the
Farm.
"She was set on Stanford it
was kind of up to me." Kaley, a cur
rent junior, remembered. "I was re
ally the one who was on the fence and
she was like, 'no, you have to go so
we can go to school together.'"
Kaley ultimately did choose Stan
ford and made an immediate contri
bution upon arriving on campus in
the fall of 2010. As a freshman, she
scored 27 goals and earned a spot on
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion All-Newcomer Team as the Car
dinal captured the national champi

onship for the second time in its his
tory.
Cory also fulfilled her "childhood
dream" and joined her sister on the
team last season. She tallied seven
goals, including three at the Nation
al Collegiate Championship, as Stan
ford successfully defended its nation
al title.
This year, Kaley has recorded 27

goals and Cory has scored 11 times
for a stacked Cardinal squad. The
team heads into the MPSF champi
onships this weekend with a 26-1
record and the top ranking in the na
tion.
Stanford head coach John Tanner
said that the Stanford water polo
program has a long history of having
sisters on the team. Last year, in ad

dition to the Dodsons, current junior
Kaitlyn Lo and her sister Alyssa'l2
played together for the Cardinal.
Tanner said that although he re
cruits every player as an individual,
he recognizes that within the same
household you can often find similar
positive traits, and the Dodsons are
no exception.
"They have a drive to excel and
are very intense competitors," Tan
ner said. "They're self-disciplined,
good students Cory and Kaley
certainly fit the Stanford profile."
Tanner also said that the team of
ten benefits from the similar ways in
which the sisters see the game.
"You see stuff where they just
connect on things," Tanner said.
"They are both really comfortable
with a dynamic style [so] as things
are changing, evolving during the
course of a possession, they seem to
maintain that unity."
That connection arises from
years of playing together. According
to the sisters, since they began play
ing, they have been on the same
team with the exception of every oth
er year in club although only a
