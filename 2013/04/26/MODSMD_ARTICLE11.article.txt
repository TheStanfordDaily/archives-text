# Baseball to clash with Ducks
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Football isn't Stanford's only team with an
Oregon problem.
Though Cardinal got that monkey off its
back on the gridiron in the fall, No. 22 Stan
ford baseball will also be looking to avenge
consecutive season-changing defeats when it
travels to Eugene this weekend.
In both 2011 and 2012, Stanford came off a
series win only to be edged by the Ducks in a
three-game set; Oregon finished just a game
ahead of Stanford in the 2012 conference
standings. The stakes are no lower this year,
as the Cardinal (23-12, 9-6 Pac-12) travels to
Eugene this weekend two and a half games be
hind the No. 7 Ducks (30-10,13-5) in the con
ference standings.
It's the early part of a brutal, six-weekend
home stretch for Stanford that includes series
against five of the Pac-12's six top team√ü.

"It's going to be good playing the guys at
the top of the conference and being right in it,"
said junior first baseman Brian Ragira.
"That's how we're going to see who the best in
the Pac-12 is."
Oregon's baseball program is now in just
its fifth year after a hiatus from 1982 to 2008,
but that hasn't stopped it from quickly becom
ing a Pac-12 contender. Past the midway point
of the conference season, the Ducks are just a
half game behind in-state rival Oregon State
for the Pac-12 lead.
They've produced that success with small
ball, which the nascent Oregon program has
played by since its revival. With a .983 fielding
percentage, the Ducks are the third-best de
fensive team in the country, and they've got
the pitching to boot; Oregon's three-man rota
tion of sophomores Jake Reed and Tommy
Thorpe and freshman Cole Irvin has stayed

Junior first baseman Brian Ragira (above) was
named Pac-12 Player of the Week after leading a
Stanford offensive explosion last weekend against
Arizona. The Card travels to Oregon this weekend
constant since opening day.
Backing them up is closer
Jimmie Sherfy, a junior
righty whose 13 saves rank
second in the country.
That would've been a mis
match a few weeks ago for a
Stanford team that struggled
out of the gates offensively.
But since recording double
digits for the first time on
April 6, the Cardinal has
eclipsed 10 runs four times in
10 games, going 5-0 in those
contests.
After a 12-8 victory to
close out a crucial series win
against another conference
nemesis, Arizona, on Sunday,
Stanford followed up with its
strongest hitting perform
ance of the season on Tues
day, a 17-2 clobbering of San
Jose State.
Ragira, who had earned
Pac-12 Player of the Week
honors on Monday, ignited
the Cardinal's explosion with
four hits, three RBI and a
home run, his fifth long fly in
seven games.
"I feel like I've been
swinging it pretty well most
of the season," he said on
Tuesday. "Hits weren't falling
early... I've been just staying
the course, so it's nice to see
some results."
Senior designated hitter
Justin Ringo and junior
rightfielder Austin Wilson
added two homers each on
Tuesday. After missing most
of the first half of the season
with an elbow injury, Wilson
is suddenly playing like the
slugger he was expected to

be in 2013; his .405 average
and one RBI per contest lead
all Cardinal hitters, albeit on
ly over the 12 games he has
played this year.
Oregon is also coming off
a dominant day at the plate,
an 11-7 midweek win against
Portland that saw the Ducks
hit three homers of their
own. Though only two of
their starters, junior Ryon
Healy and freshman Mitchell
Tolman, are hitting above
.300, the Ducks put runs on
the board pretty consistently
and hadn't been held score
less this season until last
weekend, when UCLA shut
out Oregon twice by identical
1-0 scores.

On the mound, Stanford
has still yet to find much con
sistency behind senior ace
Mark Appel. Neither sopho
more John Hochstatter nor
senior Dean McArdle made it
out of the fourth inning last
weekend, and Hochstatter
incurred an automatic four
game suspension after being
ejected for hitting Arizona's
Joseph Maggi last weekend.
"Everyone thought it was
a ridiculous call," head coach
Mark Marquess told
Scout.com, but with relievers
A.J. Vanegas and Sahil
Bloom also out due to mono
and a finger injury, respec
tively, Marquess himself may
be making some pretty
ridiculous calls to the bullpen
this weekend.
First pitch tonight be
tween Appel (7-2) and Reed
(5-3) is at 6 p.m., with a 2 p.m.
start time tomorrow and a
12:30 p.m. start time for Sun
day's series finale.
