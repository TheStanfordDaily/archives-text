# Baseball to clash with Ducks
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Football isn't Stanford's only team with an
Oregon problem.
Though Cardinal got that monkey off its
back on the gridiron in the fall, No. 22 Stan
ford baseball will also be looking to avenge
consecutive season-changing defeats when it
travels to Eugene this weekend.
In both 2011 and 2012, Stanford came off a
series win only to be edged by the Ducks in a
three-game set; Oregon finished just a game
ahead of Stanford in the 2012 conference
standings. The stakes are no lower this year,
as the Cardinal (23-12, 9-6 Pac-12) travels to
Eugene this weekend two and a half games be
hind the No. 7 Ducks (30-10,13-5) in the con
ference standings.
It's the early part of a brutal, six-weekend
home stretch for Stanford that includes series
against five of the Pac-12's six top team√ü.

"It's going to be good playing the guys at
the top of the conference and being right in it,"
said junior first baseman Brian Ragira.
"That's how we're going to see who the best in
the Pac-12 is."
Oregon's baseball program is now in just
its fifth year after a hiatus from 1982 to 2008,
but that hasn't stopped it from quickly becom
ing a Pac-12 contender. Past the midway point
of the conference season, the Ducks are just a
half game behind in-state rival Oregon State
for the Pac-12 lead.
They've produced that success with small
ball, which the nascent Oregon program has
played by since its revival. With a .983 fielding
percentage, the Ducks are the third-best de
fensive team in the country, and they've got
the pitching to boot; Oregon's three-man rota
tion of sophomores Jake Reed and Tommy
Thorpe and freshman Cole Irvin has stayed
