## SEEING GREEN Beauty and the Beholder 
### Holly Moeller 
One of the best things about
having a visitor is breaking
out of my routine, I think, as
Abby slowly thawing after her
plane flight from Nebraska and
I roam the Stanford campus.
Eventually, we find ourselves in
the Papua New Guinea sculpture
garden, a place that I'd somehow
spent two and a half years running
by without ever stopping. Now,
though, I had my chance to explore
alongside an outsider's different
perspective.
The sculpture garden, intended
to unite artistic perspectives with a
landscape half a world away, is the
perfect place to reflect on the im
portance of divergent viewpoints.
It's also a microcosm that directly
celebrates nature, both for its role
in cultural traditions and for its im
portance as a medium for artistic
expression. Here, the Papua New
Guinean artists integrated foreign
and local media, working in tradi
tional styles with imported wood
and regional stone and finishing
with a display landscape that is un
deniably North American.
There's an intriguing irony un
derlying the art installation. It is at
once a beautiful garden both su
perficially and conceptually and
also a delicate reflection of the ten
sion between old and new, funda
mentally divergent and gently ho
mogenized, the hidden treasures of
the remote past and the widely
broadcast media of the present.
The country of Papua New
Guinea takes up half an island. On a
land area a twentieth the size of the
United States, its people developed
more than 800 languages, forming
countless small communities and
more than 1,000 distinct cultural
groups. Some of them became tal
ented wood carvers, whose descen
dants crossed an ocean to design
and install pieces at Stanford Uni
versity.
This is hardly the first example
of globe-trotting indigenous art
or artists. Everything from
weaponry to ceremonial clothing
has found its way into private and
museum collections over centuries
of trade and colonialism. Today,
with technology that can bring us
instantaneous glimpses of almost
every part of our planet and in
creasing cultural sensitivity in the
modern age, we have a deeper un
derstanding of the significance of
all these pieces.
Simultaneously, however, glob
alization erodes cultural individual
ity.
Although for the most part
we've shed our old notions like the
"White Man's Burden" and salva
tion through religious conversion,
we nonetheless continue to homog
enize the planet. The process seems
almost inevitable: an almost con
stant stream of technological inno
vation and social mores cross and
erode international boundaries.
Prom both environmental and
humanitarian perspectives, this can
often be beneficial. Medical innova
tion reduces infant and childhood
mortality rates, and new agricul-

tural technologies stabilize crop
volatility. This increased family and
food security transforms the social
potential of societies. And, as social
values particularly related to
gender equality transfer, women
become increasingly educated and
increasingly active in the work
force. This generally results in re
duced birth rates, putting the
brakes on global population
growth, which can only benefit our
already overpopulated planet.
Yet it would be a terrible shame
to turn the entire globe into a seri
al echo of the "Western World."
Not only are our rates of consump
tion particularly of fossil fuels
unsustainable on a global scale, but
the cultural losses would be un
thinkable. And I don't just mean
the arts or languages.
Local knowledge continues to
prove critical insights for sustain
able living. On the one hand, it pro
vides fundamental knowledge
about a particular ecosystem. What
crops grow best in these soils? How
many people can this wedge of land
and sea support? Additionally, it
holds the results of hundreds
sometimes thousands of years of
creativity and innovation. What
plant combinations thrive growing
side-by-side? How hard can this
reef be fished before it shows signs
of wear?
Of course, the annals of history
are filled with accounts of overex
ploitation and ecosystem collapse.
Few, if any, societies seem to have
established a true long-term bal
ance between themselves and na
ture, though some were certainly
far better at maintaining equilibri
um than others. Yet acknowledging
and maintaining the diversi
ty of knowledge engrained in these
cultures makes it easy to draw from
a toolbox of working parts, rather
than reinventing the wheel every
time we encounter an unfamiliar (to
us) situation.
And in the meantime, Abby and
I can wander the gardens, enjoying
a glimpse of far-flung tradition in a
distinctive landscape.
