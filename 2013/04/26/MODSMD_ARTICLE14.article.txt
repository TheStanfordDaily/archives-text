# ERTZ STILL WAITING
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
It was deja vu for a Stan
ford tight end at the 2013 NFL
Draft. Just like in 2012 when
Coby Fleener 'll, M.A. 'l2
barely slipped out of the first
round, senior Zach Ertz was not
taken in Round No. 1 Thursday
night but is projected to be one
of the first players taken when
Round No. 2 begins Friday
evening.
Heading into the draft, ex
perts were split on whether
Ertz would be a late first
round pick, potentially to the
Atlanta Falcons or the San
Francisco 49ers at picks No. 30
and No. 31 respectively, or an
early second rounder. Fleener
had a similar rating when he
was picked with the second
pick of the second round
34th overall by the Indi
anapolis Colts in 2012.
In that 2012 draft, Stanford
had two first round picks. The
Colts took Andrew Luck 'l2
with the first overall pick and
the Pittsburgh Steelers took
David DeCastro 'l2 with the
24th pick.
With the first overall pick

Thursday, the Kansas City
Chiefs selected Central Michi
gan offensive tackle Eric Fish
er, a move that was expected
for most of the day Thursday.
That pick sparked a run of line
man; three of the first four
picks were offensive tackles.
Oregon had two of the first
three picks from the Pac-12,
which had five players taken in
the first round overall. The Mi
ami Dolphins moved up to the
third slot to select the Ducks'
defensive end Dion Jordan.
Utah defensive tackle Star Lo
tulelei went next at 14th overall
to the Carolina Panthers. Then
the Chicago Bears made Ore
gon offensive lineman Kyle
Long the 20th overall selection.
The Falcons traded up to
take Washington cornei'back
Marcus Trufant with the 22nd
overall pick. UCLA defensive

end Datone Jones was the last
Pac-12 player taken Thursday
night, going to the Green Bay
Packers with the 26th pick.
Ertz is widely regarded as
the second-best tight-end
prospect in the draft behind
Notre Dame's Tyler Eifert.
The Cincinnati Bengals select
ed Eifert with the 21st overall
pick.
The first five picks of the
second round belong to the
Jacksonville Jaguars, the
49ers, the Philadelphia Eagles,
the Detroit Lions and the Ben
gals. Of those five, the 49ers
have been the most closely
linked to Ertz.
Ertz led Stanford in receiv
ing in 2012 with 69 catches for
898 yards and six touchdowns.
Ertz finished his collegiate ca
reer with 112 catches for 1,434
yards and 15 touchdowns.
The second round is set to
begin Friday at 3:30 p.m. The
third round will run immedi
ately following the second
round, with the fourth through
seventh rounds coming on Sat
urday.

Former Stanford tight end Zach Ertz (above) was not selected in the NFL Draft's first
round but is likely to be picked early in the second round. The San Francisco 49ers
and former Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh are rumored to be interested in Ertz.
