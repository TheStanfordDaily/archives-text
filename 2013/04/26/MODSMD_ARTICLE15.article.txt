## Card seeks turnaround against Utes 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
After a difficult week filled with
seemingly never-ending rain delays
and a pair of shocking losses to weak
er non-conference opponents, No. 15
Cardinal softball (29-16, 6-9 Pac-12)
will look to rebound in this weekend's
three-game series against Utah (23-
24-1, 6-12 Pac-12).
Since pulling off its most impres
sive win of the season against then-
No. 2 Arizona State on April 7, the
Card is only 2-4 in its last six con
tests. The ongoing slide includes a 5-

2 home defeat to the Saint Mary's
Gaels (20-27, 11-9 PCSC), ranked
No. 146 in the NCAA Women's Soft
ball RPI, as well as a 9-6 road loss to
Pacific (28-22, 12-6 Big West), mark
ing the first time the Cardinal has
lost to the Tigers since 2005.
Stanford has particularly strug
gled in the circle in its recent losses,
yielding a total of 27 runs in its last
four defeats. In Wednesday's loss to
Pacific, senior Teagan Gei'hart and
freshman Kelsey Stevens combined
to give up nine runs on 12 hits, in
cluding a two-run home run to Tigers
third baseman Taylor Petty, as well

as three doubles in the fifth and sixth
innings. The late extra base hits al
lowed Pacific to finally pull away
from the Cardinal in the back-and
forth slugfest.
However, Gerhart, Stevens and
sophomore Nyree White will have an
opportunity this weekend to assert
themselves against a steadily im
proving Utes lineup. While Utah has
the third worst batting average in
the Pac-12 (.288), the Utes have
scored the third most runs in confer
ence games, averaging over four
runs per game against Pac-12 compe
tition.

At the plate, Utah's offense is led
by senior Jackie Sweet and sopho
more Kate Dickman. Sweet, a Coro
na, Calif., native who transferred to
Utah from UC-Santa Barbara after
her freshman season, currently leads
her team in batting average with a
.382 mark, 37 points clear of Dick
man. A versatile batter who can also
readily hit for power, Sweet also
holds the Utes' highest slugging per
centage at .626. Gerhart, Stevens and
White will have to be extra careful in
hitting then* locations when facing off
against Sweet.
While Sweet is certainly Utah's

best hitter, Dickman has also had a
strong year for the Utes. A Pac-12
Freshman Team Honorable Mention
selection from last season, the Mis
sion Viejo, Calif., product has paced
her team's ran production with a to
tal of 32 RBI on the season. In addi
tion, Dickman is also second on the
team in slugging percentage and on
base percentage behind Sweet.
Dickman has proven that she has
the ability to drive in runs in bunch
es, as the sophomore already has
eight multi-RBI games on the sea-
son. In particular, Dickman
had a standout performance
back on April 13 against Ore
gon State; the leftfielder went
3-for-4 that day with seven
RBI and two home runs
against the Beavers. In the
process, Dickman tied a Utah
all-time record for the most
RBI in a single game.
While hitting has been
Utah's strength during its
Pac-12 schedule, the Utes
have struggled mightily in
the circle. On the season,
Utah has posted the second

worst ERA in the Pac-12 at
3.81. Since the start of the
conference play, Utah's pitch
ing difficulties have only been
exacerbated; the Utes' pitch
ing staff has given up nearly
five runs per game (4.90)
while allowing its Pac-12 op
ponents to hit a conference
worst .342 at the plate.
Stanford and Utah will be
gin their three-game series at
Smith Family Stadium on Fri
day evening at 5:00 p.m., with
Saturday's and Sunday's
games starring at 1:00 p.m.
Friday's and Sunday's con
tests will be broadcast on the
Pac-12 Networks.
