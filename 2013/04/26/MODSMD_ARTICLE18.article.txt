## A 						lesson in storytelling 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY | STAFF WRITER 
Three of the best films at this
year's San Francisco
International Film
Festival "Something in the Air,"
"Before Midnight" and "Stories We
Tell" are as much about their
direct subject matter as the nature
of storytelling itself: how our own
personal mythologies shape our
experiences and mold or corrupt
our memories.
Olivier Assayas' autobiograph
ical film, "Something in the Air" is
as much about the student protests
against the bourgeoisie in 1971
Paris as it is about how the adoles
cents' viewpoint leaves them blind
to their own hypocrisy: the film's
student protesters are themselves
members of the bourgeoisie, and
their parents are the ones
bankrolling their revolutionary
schemes. Assayas immerses us in
the excitement, the terror and the
exhilaration of the protests and
organizing for political purposes,
but he also views his characters
from a distance. We see what the
characters cannot how misguid

ed and idealistic they now are
because their own experiences are
so conflated with their personal
narrative of changing the world.
"Something in the Air" is an
imperfect film it runs about 30
minutes too long and includes an
esoteric and irrelevant sequence
toward the end but it is emo
tionally rousing and makes you
question how age changes how
you remember events.
In "Before Midnight," the
brilliant third installment in what
is now the "Before..." series, direc
tor Richard Linklater and actors
Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke,
who all co-wrote the screenplay,
weave a complex meta-narrative
about the stories the characters
are telling themselves and the sto
ries the previous films seemed to
be telling us. Nine years ago in
"Before Sunset," we saw the cou
ple reunite for the first time in
nine years and revise their own
versions of what had happened
that night in Vienna in "Before
Sunrise" when they met. We meet
the couple, Jesse and Celine, now
in their 40s, on a pivotal and
emotionally fraught day, as they
struggle to reconcile their as
we do our story of their own
courtship from the first two films
with the reality of a long-term
relationship. "Before Midnight" is
as much a slice-of-life film as its
predecessors it unfolds largely
in real time, with the familiar
long takes of uninterrupted intel
lectual and emotional conversa
tion but it's deeper still, more

mature, both because the charac
ters have grown and because the
film itself builds on and questions
the events of the previous films.
Lastly, director Sarah Polley's
highly intelligent, perceptive and
emotionally resonant documen
tary "Stories We Tell" takes the
process of storytelling as its sub
ject. Polley's recent discovery that
the father who raised her is not
her biological father is the means
of exploring this. Polley inter
views family members, including
her siblings, her father and her
biological father, to get each of
their own personal, and often con
flicting, perspectives. This gives the

appearance of objectivity, but the
subjects are all somewhat unreli
able narrators: the story of the past
is conflated with their own person
al narratives. The interviews are
interspersed with footage from
home videos as well as re-enact
ments by present-day actors, which
flow together so seamlessly that it
can be difficult to tell what is
footage of record and what is
imagined, directed and assembled
by Polley. The form the film pres
ents it in has been edited and
assembled in the way that Polley
wishes to tell the tale, which ulti
mately gives us her own subjective
version.

"Something in the Air," "Before
Midnight" and "Stories We Tell" are
all excellent must-see films at this
year's festival that, taken together,
are a fascinating exploration of the
how and why of personal narra
tives.
