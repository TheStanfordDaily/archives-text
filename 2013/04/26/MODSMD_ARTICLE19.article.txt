# 'Trance' brings violence, femme fatale to the big screen

### SARAH LYO | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Renowned for movie darlings like
"Trainspotting," "28 Days Later"
and "Slumdog Millionaire," director
Danny Boyle has been described as one of
the finest directors of his generation. It's
not difficult to see why once you've seen
his latest film, "Trance," though it may dis
appoint some.
To give a quick summary of the plot:
fine art auctioneer Simon (James McAvoy)

loses his memory during an art heist
involving a priceless Goya painting. Since
Simon is unable, even under significant
physical duress, to recall where he hid the
painting (FYI, it's Goya's "Witches in the
Air"), criminal and fellow partner-in-crime
Frank (Vincent Cassel) teams up with hyp
notherapist Elizabeth Lamb (gorgeously
played by Rosario Dawson in what must
be her strongest performance to date) to

search for the lost artwork hidden deep
within Simon's innermost psyche.
The movie has received mixed
responses from critics which is not too
surprising. In some ways the movie's a bril
liant thriller-noir intelligent, stylish and
dizzyingly precipitous, complete with
skewed angle shots and Dawson's femme
fatale whose tripper scenes recall some
of the director's signature cinematic moves

in other Boyle classics. "Trance," for instance,
opens with a clever voice-over that instantly
calls to mind Ewan McGregor's version in
"Trainspotting." And like with
"Trainspotting," there are compelling per
formances all around, especially from the
lead, James McAvoy, who is at times appro
priately and terrifyingly unnerving.
But other moviegoers are hesitant. It's
like "Inception" all over again: the movie
might be stylish, fun and imaginative, but
you'll either love it or you'll hate it, and the
reasons will differ. As Christopher Orr of
The Atlantic writes in his review, "It's just
that kind of film, one that will inevitably
divide audiences along fault lines that are
hard to predict."
Well, you'll just have to go and find out,
won't you?
(But be prepared: there's lots of nudity
and violence. The shocking kind.)
