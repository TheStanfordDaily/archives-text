Over 1,300 prospective freshmen (ProFros) ar
rived on campus yesterday for Admit Weekend
2013, which will offer ProFros and their relatives
programming through Saturday.
This year's Admit Weekend will feature several
new events, including limited tours of the Bing Con
cert Hall, panels on the new Integrated Learning
Environment (ILEs) science and art programs to
be housed in Burbank, and discussions on the new
graduation breadth requirements called Ways of
Thinking/Ways of Doing which the Class of 2017
will pilot.
According to Admit Weekend event coordinator
Oswaldo Hasbun 'l3, there was a slight increase in
the number of registered ProFros over last year's

total. In 2011, The Daily reported 1,190 registered
admits.
Despite the growing number of ProFros, Admit
Weekend host recruitment coordinator Andres
Gutierrez 'l4 said that enough room hosts (RoHos)
registered to accommodate all visiting ProFros.
According to Marcus Alvarez 'l6, head House
Host (HoHo) for Casa Zapata, by last weekend the
Weekend's coordinators were reportedly in need of
400 more RoHos to accommodate all ProFros. By
the end of the weekend that number had reported
ly been reduced to about 250 after coordinators and
HoHos started sending out messages to multiple
mailing lists.
Alvarez added that HoHos and some RoHos
have been asked to host more than one Pro Fro in
