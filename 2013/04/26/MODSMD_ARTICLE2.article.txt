# STUDENT LIFE
## ProFros, parents sample Farm life 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Over 1,300 prospective freshmen (ProFros) ar
rived on campus yesterday for Admit Weekend
2013, which will offer ProFros and their relatives
programming through Saturday.
This year's Admit Weekend will feature several
new events, including limited tours of the Bing Con
cert Hall, panels on the new Integrated Learning
Environment (ILEs) science and art programs to
be housed in Burbank, and discussions on the new
graduation breadth requirements called Ways of
Thinking/Ways of Doing which the Class of 2017
will pilot.
According to Admit Weekend event coordinator
Oswaldo Hasbun 'l3, there was a slight increase in
the number of registered ProFros over last year's

total. In 2011, The Daily reported 1,190 registered
admits.
Despite the growing number of ProFros, Admit
Weekend host recruitment coordinator Andres
Gutierrez 'l4 said that enough room hosts (RoHos)
registered to accommodate all visiting ProFros.
According to Marcus Alvarez 'l6, head House
Host (HoHo) for Casa Zapata, by last weekend the
Weekend's coordinators were reportedly in need of
400 more RoHos to accommodate all ProFros. By
the end of the weekend that number had reported
ly been reduced to about 250 after coordinators and
HoHos started sending out messages to multiple
mailing lists.
Alvarez added that HoHos and some RoHos
have been asked to host more than one Pro Fro in

case not enough students
were recruited. Students
were generally receptive to
this request, which Alvarez
framed as advantageous for
busy RoHos.
"If you're not able to stay
with your Pro Fro the whole
time, the Profro will have an
other buddy to stick with so
they can be together and do
whatever they want," Al
varez said.
Alvarez said his own ex
periences with a busy RoHo
during last year's Admit
Weekend inspired him to
work as a HoHo this year.
"It's a really important

time. It's when a lot of big
decisions are made, and if we
can show what's Stanford's
like and show everything
that's good about it, we can
help them choose what the
best school is for them," Al
varez said.
Dean of Freshmen Rob
Urstein said that he looks
forward to helping ProFros
experience the wealth of re
sources available to them
should they choose to ma
triculate at Stanford.
"The whole idea I think
from our perspective ... is to
get students interacting with
current students about what
it's like to be a student at
Stanford and how they can
access and take advantage of
all the resources and oppor
tunities that are here,"
Urstein said.

"The more people stu
dents meet, whether it's fac
ulty or current students, the
more perspectives they're
going to get," Urstein added,
emphasizing the value of di
verse aspects of the Stanford
experience. "We're not all
talking from a single script
about what makes Stanford
unique. The most important
thing when students are
choosing a school is that they
are choosing a place where
they are going to feel wel
come and at home and the
school choice is about a place
where people can be them
selves."
Admitted students have
until May 1 to accept the
University's offer.
