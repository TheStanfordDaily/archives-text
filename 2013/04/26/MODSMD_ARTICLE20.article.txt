# THE
						TOP FIVE
## Places for ProFros on ADMIT WEEKEND 
### 
Admit Weekend is here, and amid suitcases,
wrinkled maps and ProFros asking where the
restroom is when they're, in fact, standing
right in front of it, you may find yourself if anyone
remembers that classes are still happening. The 5.7
percent is here, and as you take time to convince
them to come to Stanford, take them to these classic
campus spots to show them the best of the Farm.

The Quad
Perhaps the most touristy spot on campus, the
Main Quad showcases all the grandeur of Leland
and Jane's lifestyle and gives you a taste of
Stanford history without having to go to the
kind-of-creepy mausoleum. If the parents are
around as well, make sure they check out the lit
tle rose gardens next to MemChu for some peace
and quiet.

The Adverb Wall in the GSB
Some of your more ahem academic
ProFros will appreciate the swapping synonyms
on the board right next to Coupa Cafe. You
might even get to hear about how many of the
words they saw on the SAT ... But in all seri
ousness, the Adverb Wall can suck up time
unexpectedly, so make sure to allot a couple
extra moments as you attempt to figure out the
pattern in which words come up (yes, there is

one).
Engineering Quad
The Engineering Quad gets mixed reviews from
students: some hate how 'stark' it feels, while
others think the sleek Hewlett and Packard
buildings are state-of-the-art. Whatever the case,
there's a chance your Pro Fro will be spending
some serious time there (#allnightersatY2E2).
Show them what's up and don't forget to
take them to Ike's for lunch.
Rodin Sculpture Garden
For the more artistic or historically-stimulated
ProFros, the sculpture garden outside Cantor
Arts Center showcases a huge number of
Rodin's pieces the largest collection outside
of France, in fact. Bonus point: the cafe is awe
some.
Bing Concert Hall
Also for the arts folks, Bing is the newest home
to both Stanford performers and world-renown
artists (Yo-Yo Ma, anyone?). The hall will be
open for tours as well as a show on Friday and
Saturday night at 8 p.m. with the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra and pianist Jon
Nakamatsu.
The Claw
One word: fountain hopping. Because, really,
what's more Stanford?
