## 
### SOO Jl LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Professor of Biology Elizabeth Hadly was recently
named senior vice provost for undergraduate educa
tion (VPUE), replacing fellow biology professor
Martha Cyert at the end of Cyert's three-year term on
Aug. 31. The Daily sat down with Hadly to discuss her
new role, in which she will lead VPUE's undergradu
ate research grant programs and serve as a voice of
students and faculty working in the sciences.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What are your upcom
ing duties as senior associate vice provost for un
dergraduate education? Why did you choose to ac-

cept the position?
Elizabeth Hadly (EH): My
duties are to be the scientific
voice for faculty and for stu
dents on campus. I'm really ex
cited to be paired with [Vice
Provost for Undergraduate
Education] Harry [Elam], who
represents the humanities end
of undergraduate education.
I chose to accept the posi
tion because I actually love
teaching Stanford undergradu
ates and I find that they're re-

ceptive to all different ways of learning... I want to
make sure that the infrastructure that has been pret
ty well developed over the last several decades and
in particular over the last year with the [Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stanford] program that
was presented to the Faculty Senate last year and
[that] is starting to be implemented by Harry Elam
[works]. I figured it was really important to help im
plement those guidelines ways of thinking, ways of
knowing, ways of doing at Stanford. And so I want
ed to provide a scientific perspective on that.
TSD: One of your main duties is to oversee under
graduate research. Did you do research as an un
dergrad? How has that research guided you to the
work you do today?
EH: I did undergraduate research. I did an honors
project on athletes I was a runner at Colorado
when I was in college. I did a research project looking
at how body fat in women contributed to their cycles.
I was really curious to follow that through with re
spect to the people that I was exercising with.
I've guided many undergraduate students in honor
theses at Stanford and also in research projects that
don't necessarily amount to honors. I find that to be
one of my most exciting parts of my job. I spend a lot
of time with the undergrad students in my lab, trying
to help them find their own path to the questions that
