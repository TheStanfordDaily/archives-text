# Q&A ELIZABETH HADLY SENIOR VICE PROVOST
## 
### SOO Jl LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Professor of Biology Elizabeth Hadly was recently
named senior vice provost for undergraduate educa
tion (VPUE), replacing fellow biology professor
Martha Cyert at the end of Cyert's three-year term on
Aug. 31. The Daily sat down with Hadly to discuss her
new role, in which she will lead VPUE's undergradu
ate research grant programs and serve as a voice of
students and faculty working in the sciences.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What are your upcom
ing duties as senior associate vice provost for un
dergraduate education? Why did you choose to ac-

cept the position?
Elizabeth Hadly (EH): My
duties are to be the scientific
voice for faculty and for stu
dents on campus. I'm really ex
cited to be paired with [Vice
Provost for Undergraduate
Education] Harry [Elam], who
represents the humanities end
of undergraduate education.
I chose to accept the posi
tion because I actually love
teaching Stanford undergradu
ates and I find that they're re-

ceptive to all different ways of learning... I want to
make sure that the infrastructure that has been pret
ty well developed over the last several decades and
in particular over the last year with the [Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stanford] program that
was presented to the Faculty Senate last year and
[that] is starting to be implemented by Harry Elam
[works]. I figured it was really important to help im
plement those guidelines ways of thinking, ways of
knowing, ways of doing at Stanford. And so I want
ed to provide a scientific perspective on that.
TSD: One of your main duties is to oversee under
graduate research. Did you do research as an un
dergrad? How has that research guided you to the
work you do today?
EH: I did undergraduate research. I did an honors
project on athletes I was a runner at Colorado
when I was in college. I did a research project looking
at how body fat in women contributed to their cycles.
I was really curious to follow that through with re
spect to the people that I was exercising with.
I've guided many undergraduate students in honor
theses at Stanford and also in research projects that
don't necessarily amount to honors. I find that to be
one of my most exciting parts of my job. I spend a lot
of time with the undergrad students in my lab, trying
to help them find their own path to the questions that


Elizabeth Hadly
are the most interesting to them
and then help support them in fig
uring out how best to address those
questions.
In terms of how my own re
search has contributed to my inter
est in undergrads, I would say that
because my curiosity for address
ing research questions was really
stimulated when I was in college
and I've had the freedom... to ad
dress my own questions, it's the
most exciting part of my intellectu
al life... to ask questions and to
come up with ways to address them
and to somehow disseminate those
results. And so because it's been so
fulfilling to me, I find it really im
portant and valuable to help other
people in the same way. Under
graduate research is something I
really prioritize in my lab and I
think it's important to experience
for every Stanford student if they
want to experience it.
TSD: What does your research at
the Hadly Lab entail, and how did
it get started?
EH: All of us address questions
about the generation and mainte
nance of diversity. We look at that
diversity in many different levels.
We look at it with respect to genet
ic variation. We look at it with re
spect to species differences and
with respect to the number of indi
viduals within a species and how
that's distributed across time and
space. That's a longer way of say

ing we particularly investigate how
climate change influences genetic
species and community diversity
through time and space.... We try
and understand what the genetic
variation that we unravel means in
terms of time and the response to
near environmental events in the
area.
TSD: How have your views on ed
ucation and teaching techniques
evolved?
EH: My views of teaching have
evolved. I started here thinking the
way to teach was to stand up and
give a lecture. That was pretty well
rehearsed, organized, with a lot of
background information and basi
cally just conveying the information
to the students. I have evolved into
a teacher that thinks that probably
the most exciting way to teach is
and probably is at least in my ex
perience with my own teaching
methods one of the most effec
tive ways of teaching is to actually
learn along with the students and
show them how I learn.
Sometimes, for example, I start
asking questions that I don't know
the answer to and I find that it's a
really fun way to get the students
involved with the thinking and the
learning and the curiosity part of
addressing that question. I spend
more time walking around the
room; I spend less time trying to
throw a lot of information in the stu
dents' brains. I try and get them in
volved by getting them up on the
board and having them work in
small groups. Having them teach
me is probably one of the most in
formative experiences I've ever
had.

TSD: How did you become pas
sionate about geological/earth
sciences and biology?
EH: There are a couple of
things. First when I was in elemen
tary school, I spent some time in
the Washington, D.C., area and I
ended up going to the Smithsonian
at every opportunity I could. That
kind of stimulation with artifacts,
not just human artifacts but seeing
animals from other places, learning
about cultures from other times,
made me realize and [be] curious
about the dynamics of the planet in
different places at different times.
I thought for the longest time
when I went to high school I was
going to be a doctor. I was pre-med
when I started college, but that
ended up really being curious not so
much about the health of humans
but about them interaction with the
environment and what led to the de
mise of human health. I ended up
taking a class on the natural history
of disease and I found myself being
more interested in the fleas infect
ing the rats and that kind of envi
ronmental changes going on than
how plague affected humans. It
made me realize I wasn't as inter
ested in human health than I
thought.
That got me to thinking about
environments in the absence of hu
mans and just the dynamics of that.
How the dynamics of species tran
spired through times why did
they boom and bust and what was
the climate doing at those times?
I ended up getting really inter
ested in the fossil record. I worked
for the Park Service for a while in
Yellowstone National Park. I was
curious about the extent of ecosys

tem and what the modern species of
the landscape were like 100, 200,
1,000 or 2,000 years ago. That got
me into wanting to know more
about the fossil record and got me
ultimately into my own excavations.
Most people who do this excavation
of fossils paleontologists are
in the geological community.
They're geologists trained in the
rock record, work in deep time, mil
lions and millions of years ago, on
species that are extinct.
But I found myself in this inter
esting place where I was most in
terested in the modern ecosystem
and what the fossil record of our
modern ecosystem was. That meant
I was more of a biologist than a ge
ologist; I was a little bit of both
[and] straddling those two words is
something I've never given up. I
find it to be the most interesting be
cause it brings not only the past
back to life but gives you a sense of
the dynamics of the modern diversi
ty on the planet. It also gives you
this amazing perspective of about
where we're going and what hu
mans have done. I haven't quite left
either geology or biology. I couldn't
imagine relinquishing either of
them in my science.
TSD: What are some of your fa
vorite memories teaching at
Stanford?
EH: One of my very favorite mo
ments, virtually every fall, is the
very first day of class in my fresh
man seminar at 10 a.m. on Monday
morning. All the freshmen come in
their very first day and I just ab
solutely love that day. I love learn
ing about where everyone's from
and seeing how excited they are

and how nervous they are, and
hearing about what they want to
learn about that's always been
my favorite day of the year.
I also love seeing undergradu
ates graduate with honors ... I like
to keep in touch with a lot of my un
dergrads; it makes me feel so won
derful how they've grown and how
they've come in not knowing what
they wanted to do and they leave
with this sense of closing up some
thing in four years at Stanford.
They seem ready to go off into this
future; that's a pretty wonderful
time. I have really loved the field
work I've done with the students at
Stanford. It's an opportunity to get
to know students around the camp
fire when they're freezing, trying to
stay warm around a cup of hot co
coa ... I really love opening people's
eyes to something in away in their
own backyard. Those are wonderful
experiences for me as well. And
then another great time is when the
undergrads come to my office with
their first data, their first grant, the
final paper or final thesis at hand.
It's really rewarding for me to see
them succeed at what they're try
ing to do.
TSD: Do you plan on teaching af
ter accepting this position?
EH: I'm going to teach an upper
division seminar or two. This is a
half-time position; it's just a two
year job for now. We'll see how that
goes.

dergrad? How has that research guided you to the
work you do today?
EH: I did undergraduate research. I did an honors
project on athletes I was a runner at Colorado
when I was in college. I did a research project looking
at how body fat in women contributed to their cycles.
I was really curious to follow that through with re
spect to the people that I was exercising with.
I've guided many undergraduate students in honor
theses at Stanford and also in research projects that
don't necessarily amount to honors. I find that to be
one of my most exciting parts of my job. I spend a lot
of time with the undergrad students in my lab, trying
to help them find their own path to the questions that


Elizabeth Hadly
are the most interesting to them
and then help support them in fig
uring out how best to address those
questions.
In terms of how my own re
search has contributed to my inter
est in undergrads, I would say that
because my curiosity for address
ing research questions was really
stimulated when I was in college
and I've had the freedom... to ad
dress my own questions, it's the
most exciting part of my intellectu
al life... to ask questions and to
come up with ways to address them
and to somehow disseminate those
results. And so because it's been so
fulfilling to me, I find it really im
portant and valuable to help other
people in the same way. Under
graduate research is something I
really prioritize in my lab and I
think it's important to experience
for every Stanford student if they
want to experience it.
TSD: What does your research at
the Hadly Lab entail, and how did
it get started?
EH: All of us address questions
about the generation and mainte
nance of diversity. We look at that
diversity in many different levels.
We look at it with respect to genet
ic variation. We look at it with re
spect to species differences and
with respect to the number of indi
viduals within a species and how
that's distributed across time and
space. That's a longer way of say

ing we particularly investigate how
climate change influences genetic
species and community diversity
through time and space.... We try
and understand what the genetic
variation that we unravel means in
terms of time and the response to
near environmental events in the
area.
TSD: How have your views on ed
ucation and teaching techniques
evolved?
EH: My views of teaching have
evolved. I started here thinking the
way to teach was to stand up and
give a lecture. That was pretty well
rehearsed, organized, with a lot of
background information and basi
cally just conveying the information
to the students. I have evolved into
a teacher that thinks that probably
the most exciting way to teach is
and probably is at least in my ex
perience with my own teaching
methods one of the most effec
tive ways of teaching is to actually
learn along with the students and
show them how I learn.
Sometimes, for example, I start
asking questions that I don't know
the answer to and I find that it's a
really fun way to get the students
involved with the thinking and the
learning and the curiosity part of
addressing that question. I spend
more time walking around the
room; I spend less time trying to
throw a lot of information in the stu
dents' brains. I try and get them in
volved by getting them up on the
board and having them work in
small groups. Having them teach
me is probably one of the most in
formative experiences I've ever
had.

TSD: How did you become pas
sionate about geological/earth
sciences and biology?
EH: There are a couple of
things. First when I was in elemen
tary school, I spent some time in
the Washington, D.C., area and I
ended up going to the Smithsonian
at every opportunity I could. That
kind of stimulation with artifacts,
not just human artifacts but seeing
animals from other places, learning
about cultures from other times,
made me realize and [be] curious
about the dynamics of the planet in
different places at different times.
I thought for the longest time
when I went to high school I was
going to be a doctor. I was pre-med
when I started college, but that
ended up really being curious not so
much about the health of humans
but about them interaction with the
environment and what led to the de
mise of human health. I ended up
taking a class on the natural history
of disease and I found myself being
more interested in the fleas infect
ing the rats and that kind of envi
ronmental changes going on than
how plague affected humans. It
made me realize I wasn't as inter
ested in human health than I
thought.
That got me to thinking about
environments in the absence of hu
mans and just the dynamics of that.
How the dynamics of species tran
spired through times why did
they boom and bust and what was
the climate doing at those times?
I ended up getting really inter
ested in the fossil record. I worked
for the Park Service for a while in
Yellowstone National Park. I was
curious about the extent of ecosys

tem and what the modern species of
the landscape were like 100, 200,
1,000 or 2,000 years ago. That got
me into wanting to know more
about the fossil record and got me
ultimately into my own excavations.
Most people who do this excavation
of fossils paleontologists are
in the geological community.
They're geologists trained in the
rock record, work in deep time, mil
lions and millions of years ago, on
species that are extinct.
But I found myself in this inter
esting place where I was most in
terested in the modern ecosystem
and what the fossil record of our
modern ecosystem was. That meant
I was more of a biologist than a ge
ologist; I was a little bit of both
[and] straddling those two words is
something I've never given up. I
find it to be the most interesting be
cause it brings not only the past
back to life but gives you a sense of
the dynamics of the modern diversi
ty on the planet. It also gives you
this amazing perspective of about
where we're going and what hu
mans have done. I haven't quite left
either geology or biology. I couldn't
imagine relinquishing either of
them in my science.
TSD: What are some of your fa
vorite memories teaching at
Stanford?
EH: One of my very favorite mo
ments, virtually every fall, is the
very first day of class in my fresh
man seminar at 10 a.m. on Monday
morning. All the freshmen come in
their very first day and I just ab
solutely love that day. I love learn
ing about where everyone's from
and seeing how excited they are

and how nervous they are, and
hearing about what they want to
learn about that's always been
my favorite day of the year.
I also love seeing undergradu
ates graduate with honors ... I like
to keep in touch with a lot of my un
dergrads; it makes me feel so won
derful how they've grown and how
they've come in not knowing what
they wanted to do and they leave
with this sense of closing up some
thing in four years at Stanford.
They seem ready to go off into this
future; that's a pretty wonderful
time. I have really loved the field
work I've done with the students at
Stanford. It's an opportunity to get
to know students around the camp
fire when they're freezing, trying to
stay warm around a cup of hot co
coa ... I really love opening people's
eyes to something in away in their
own backyard. Those are wonderful
experiences for me as well. And
then another great time is when the
undergrads come to my office with
their first data, their first grant, the
final paper or final thesis at hand.
It's really rewarding for me to see
them succeed at what they're try
ing to do.
TSD: Do you plan on teaching af
ter accepting this position?
EH: I'm going to teach an upper
division seminar or two. This is a
half-time position; it's just a two
year job for now. We'll see how that
goes.

Professor of Biology Elizabeth Hadly was recently
named senior vice provost for undergraduate educa

Martha Cyert at the end of Cyert's three-year term on
Aug. 31. The Daily sat down with Hadly to discuss her
new role, in which she will lead VPUE's undergradu
ate research grant programs and serve as a voice of
students and faculty working in the sciences.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What are your upcom

Education] Harry [Elam], who

of undergraduate education.
I chose to accept the posi
tion because I actually love
teaching Stanford undergradu
ates and I find that they're re-

ceptive to all different ways of learning... I want to
make sure that the infrastructure that has been pret
ty well developed over the last several decades and
in particular over the last year with the [Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stanford] program that
was presented to the Faculty Senate last year and
[that] is starting to be implemented by Harry Elam
[works]. I figured it was really important to help im
plement those guidelines ways of thinking, ways of
knowing, ways of doing at Stanford. And so I want
ed to provide a scientific perspective on that.

it get started?
EH: All of us address questions
about the generation and mainte
nance of diversity. We look at that
diversity in many different levels.
We look at it with respect to genet
ic variation. We look at it with re
spect to species differences and
with respect to the number of indi
viduals within a species and how
that's distributed across time and
space. That's a longer way of say

ing we particularly investigate how
climate change influences genetic
species and community diversity
through time and space.... We try
and understand what the genetic
variation that we unravel means in
terms of time and the response to
near environmental events in the
area.
TSD: How have your views on ed
ucation and teaching techniques
evolved?
EH: My views of teaching have
evolved. I started here thinking the
way to teach was to stand up and
give a lecture. That was pretty well
rehearsed, organized, with a lot of
background information and basi
cally just conveying the information
to the students. I have evolved into
a teacher that thinks that probably
the most exciting way to teach is
and probably is at least in my ex
perience with my own teaching
methods one of the most effec
tive ways of teaching is to actually
learn along with the students and
show them how I learn.
Sometimes, for example, I start
asking questions that I don't know
the answer to and I find that it's a
really fun way to get the students
involved with the thinking and the
learning and the curiosity part of
addressing that question. I spend
more time walking around the
room; I spend less time trying to
throw a lot of information in the stu
dents' brains. I try and get them in
volved by getting them up on the
board and having them work in
small groups. Having them teach
me is probably one of the most in
formative experiences I've ever
had.

TSD: How did you become pas
sionate about geological/earth
sciences and biology?
EH: There are a couple of
things. First when I was in elemen
tary school, I spent some time in
the Washington, D.C., area and I
ended up going to the Smithsonian
at every opportunity I could. That
kind of stimulation with artifacts,
not just human artifacts but seeing
animals from other places, learning
about cultures from other times,
made me realize and [be] curious
about the dynamics of the planet in
different places at different times.
I thought for the longest time
when I went to high school I was
going to be a doctor. I was pre-med
when I started college, but that
ended up really being curious not so
much about the health of humans
but about them interaction with the
environment and what led to the de
mise of human health. I ended up
taking a class on the natural history
of disease and I found myself being
more interested in the fleas infect
ing the rats and that kind of envi
ronmental changes going on than
how plague affected humans. It
made me realize I wasn't as inter
ested in human health than I
thought.
That got me to thinking about
environments in the absence of hu
mans and just the dynamics of that.
How the dynamics of species tran
spired through times why did
they boom and bust and what was
the climate doing at those times?
I ended up getting really inter
ested in the fossil record. I worked
for the Park Service for a while in
Yellowstone National Park. I was
curious about the extent of ecosys

tem and what the modern species of
the landscape were like 100, 200,
1,000 or 2,000 years ago. That got
me into wanting to know more
about the fossil record and got me
ultimately into my own excavations.
Most people who do this excavation
of fossils paleontologists are
in the geological community.
They're geologists trained in the
rock record, work in deep time, mil
lions and millions of years ago, on
species that are extinct.
But I found myself in this inter
esting place where I was most in
terested in the modern ecosystem
and what the fossil record of our
modern ecosystem was. That meant
I was more of a biologist than a ge
ologist; I was a little bit of both
[and] straddling those two words is
something I've never given up. I
find it to be the most interesting be
cause it brings not only the past
back to life but gives you a sense of
the dynamics of the modern diversi
ty on the planet. It also gives you
this amazing perspective of about
where we're going and what hu
mans have done. I haven't quite left
either geology or biology. I couldn't
imagine relinquishing either of
them in my science.
TSD: What are some of your fa
vorite memories teaching at
Stanford?
EH: One of my very favorite mo
ments, virtually every fall, is the
very first day of class in my fresh
man seminar at 10 a.m. on Monday
morning. All the freshmen come in
their very first day and I just ab
solutely love that day. I love learn
ing about where everyone's from
and seeing how excited they are

and how nervous they are, and
hearing about what they want to
learn about that's always been
my favorite day of the year.
I also love seeing undergradu
ates graduate with honors ... I like
to keep in touch with a lot of my un
dergrads; it makes me feel so won
derful how they've grown and how
they've come in not knowing what
they wanted to do and they leave
with this sense of closing up some
thing in four years at Stanford.
They seem ready to go off into this
future; that's a pretty wonderful
time. I have really loved the field
work I've done with the students at
Stanford. It's an opportunity to get
to know students around the camp
fire when they're freezing, trying to
stay warm around a cup of hot co
coa ... I really love opening people's
eyes to something in away in their
own backyard. Those are wonderful
experiences for me as well. And
then another great time is when the
undergrads come to my office with
their first data, their first grant, the
final paper or final thesis at hand.
It's really rewarding for me to see
them succeed at what they're try
ing to do.
TSD: Do you plan on teaching af
ter accepting this position?
EH: I'm going to teach an upper
division seminar or two. This is a
half-time position; it's just a two
year job for now. We'll see how that
goes.
