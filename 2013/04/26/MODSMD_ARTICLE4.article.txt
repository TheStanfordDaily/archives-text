# THE 						TECHNICIAN
## THE 						JOURNEY CONTINUES 
### WINSTON SHI STAFF WRITER 
This is the final piece of a three-part
feature on Shannon Turley, the sports
performance coordinator entering his
seventh season with Stanford football,
Part 111 focuses on Turley's personal
journey and the future.

At the end of the 2010 season,
Stanford football announced
its arrival in the only way that
a truly relevant program
should: by celebrating a com
ing-out party of historic proportions.
The Cardinal closed its 12-1 campaign in
style, opening the new year against Virginia

Tech (VT) in the 2011 Orange Bowl and
crushing the Hokies 40-12. It finished the
season ranked fourth in the country.
Stanford's triumph was an especially big
win for Shannon Thrley, a 'OO graduate of
Virginia Tech, who had seen Tech's rise to
prominence firsthand. While Turley had no
illusions as to which team he wanted to win,
there remained a certain irony to Stan
ford's victory: a Hokie supporter since birth
and an alumnus and former coach to boot,
Turley had naturally sought to help build
Stanford in the VT mold.
"A lot of these programs don't just
spring up out of nowhere," Turley says.
"They were able to do that at Virginia Tech,

so where else can you do that in college
football?"
It turned out that Palo Alto was a
great place to do it.
♦♦♦
Tbrley enjoyed playing Virginia Tech,
if only because it would allow him to see
his friends and family, as well as the man
who gave him his first college coaching
job, VT's strength coach Mike Gentry.
"No one offered me a scholarship to
play football in college; I wasn't even re
ally looked at as a walk-on at Virginia
Tech," Turley explains. "I found out
about their strength program and the job
Mike Gentry was doing, and he got a lot
of credit and praise for his role in Vir
ginia Tech finishing 10-2 when I was a
freshman [in 1995-6] won the Big East
title, beat Texas in the Sugar Bowl. And I
said, 'Well, look, that's what I need to do:
I need to be a strength coach.'"
That season, Virginia Tech had won
its first conference championship and
recorded only the second 10-win season
in school history. The Hokies, coming
from obscurity to become the newly
anointed football power of the Mid-At
lantic, were the toast of the region.
Looking back, Tbrley appreciates the
similarities between his employer and his
alma mater.
"For us, a team built in a blue-collar
work ethic, like [Virginia Tbch], and want
ing to physically dominate our opponents
and impose our will—we saw a lot of our
selves in that program," Tbrley says.
But the eventual strength coach started
not with football but by walking onto the
track team. After a (by his own admission)
mostly unsuccessful year—"l did that just
to get my foot in the door with the strength
and conditioning staff," he says Tbrley
asked Gentry for a job.
"Shannon just showed great interest,
enthusiasm and seemed very motivated,"
Gentry remembers. "I like to see people de
velop and realize their goals and be part of
the process, and I noticed Shannon shares
that interest as well."
It was at Virginia Tech that the under
pinnings of Tbrley's training philosophy fell
into place: weightlifting techniques, to be
sure, but also uncompromising standards,
high expectations and as Gentry's praise
indicates a deep commitment to the
process.
The two men still keep in touch to this
day, swapping stories, tips and experiences.
"We've talked training—he's shared
training philosophies with me." Gentry said.
'And just encouragement. At different
times we've each encouraged each other."
'And of course our teams played in the
Orange Bowl a couple years ago, and they
crushed us. The student kind of taught the
teacher."
♦♦♦
Gentry's sentiment speaks to a deeper
trend in strength training: the lines be
tween student and teacher are constantly
blurred.
In contrast to the public's typical per
ception of the ultra-secretive football coach
—think of Eric Mangini burning his files or
the late A1 Davis' coaching counterespi
onage strength and conditioning coaches
share information freely. In fact, Tbrley will
be speaking at the annual conference of the
National Strength Coaches Association in
July.
"I don't have any secrets, and it's by and
large because I learned it from someone
else," Tbrley says. "Someone was willing to
teach me."
Indeed, Tbrley matured under Gentry's
guidance, but he was also heavily influenced
by his time under Jeff Fish at Missouri, a
coach with a strong reputation for using the

unorthodox exercises that Tbrley now em
ploys.
History tends to blur under these open
circumstances: even Gentry, an Olympic
lifting stalwart, is not sure who was the first
strength coach to apply the Olympic lifts to
football.
With Tbrley the cycle of coaching has
continued. Perhaps the greatest sign of Tbr
ley's achievement as a strength coach is his
staff's coaching turnover: in recent years,
he has lost two of his top assistants, Dave
Forman and Hans Straub, to head strength
coaching positions at Colorado and South
Florida. Needless to say Tbrley will not be
afraid to ask them questions about their
own programs.
"Those are guys that I'll go back to be
cause they were here with me, and say,
'Hey, what are you doing differently' based
on the program that I ran and developed,"
Tbrley says. "If they're having success with
it, then obviously I'd be a fool not to listen to
what they'd been doing."
This symbiotic relationship extends to
Tbrley's players as well as his former
mentees. Many veterans of Tbrley's pro
gram have firmly acknowledged his impact
on their lives, and in turn, Tbrley cites his
former players as a great influence on his
freshmen. As Stanford football alumni visit
and guide the new players, Tbrley sees a cy
cle in the making.
"If we're working to get some change
from some of those young freshmen and
get them to buy into the way we want them
to work, and they're immature and some
what reluctant to do it and they see those
great players that are now great NFL play
ers here, training and doing it our way
seeking coaching and wanting to do it our
way, well, it makes it a little easier for them
to buy in," Tbrley says. "It makes my job
easier. So I'm happy to work with them and
thrilled to have them around."
Alex Debniak concurs. 'As the younger
kids started coming in," he says, "they
started to see that, and they wanted to have
that as well. Novy there's a combined cama
raderie: to be aggressive and to be tough
and to give out for each other. I think that's
really the biggest thing that's changed,
without a doubt."
♦♦♦
With an NFL factory in the making, a
massive facilities expansion underway and
three straight BCS bowls under his belt,
one could forgive Shannon Tbrley for eas
ing his foot off the accelerator a bit
However, coaches are not known for
their tendency to relax.
"I don't think I'm ever 'satisfied.' I don't
think anyone's ever 'satisfied,'" Tbrley says.
In particular, Tbrley sees the need to
build Stanford football into not only a con
sistent winner but an enduring institution
in Stanford and Northern California. Stan
ford's relatively small local alumni popula
tion means that it traditionally relies on
non-alumni fans to fill the bulk of its stadi
um.
"I would love it if people in the area were
more passionate about football," Tbrley ex
plains. "It hurts to have a great team play
so well at home and play a Pac-12 Champi
onship Game in front of less than a full sta
dium. But you also understand —that's
part of the culture that you're in, and we
embrace that. Having grown up where I
did, you know football's really important,
but there's also a lot less going on."
About to leave the Farm, Debniak is re
flective about that side of Cardinal football
as well.
"I think, when you first get to Stanford,
you have these dreams of grandeur—
everyone's always thinking, you know, the
LSUs or the Alabamas, having women af
ter you... everything like that," he says. "At

least from my personal perspective, when I
first got here as a freshman, I was a little
disappointed. I was like, this can't be what
it's all about."
"But I've come to realize that yes, you
give a lot of yourself to come in here, but
you need to sacrifice your pride and you
need to humble yourself, coming here. This
place will do that to you. And I think as I've
matured and gotten older here, I've come
to realize that this place is bigger than me,
it's bigger than the team."
♦♦♦
As Thrley watches his players grow
closer into a second family, he also recog
nizes the need for a family of his own. He re
cently got engaged to his girlfriend, a nurse
working at Stanford Hospital's angiogra
phy lab. Displaying a keen flair for the mo
ment, he made sure to propose on New
"fear's Day right after Stanford won the
Rose Bowl.
Thrley is at a special period of his life,
and the setting of his proposal further ac
centuates the intersection between his life
and his career. He is embarking on two
great unfolding adventures: Stanford foot
ball is fielding its finest teams in seventy
years, and soon Thrley will be awaiting his
bride at the altar.
"We're getting married in June," he
says and smiles.
With both his personal and coaching
lives on the upswing and a bright future
ahead, it seems as though Thrley has found
his place at Stanford.
"I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying
here," he says. "I've had opportunities to go
other places and I choose to stay here. I love
working with the guys that I get a chance to
work with every day, and my profession and
my role —that's what I do, I spend time
with the players. I love those guys and the
opportunity to grind with them every day is
not something I am willing to walk away
from for more money or what I perceive to
be a "better job.'
"There's nothing else I could do and be
happy" he continues. "I tell people when
they want to be volunteer interns: if there's
something else that you could do and be
happy then you should go do that, because
there's not enough money there's not
enough credit, there's not enough free time.
It's a consuming profession, but it's very re
warding because of the impact that you can
have on the young men and women that you
get a chance to work with."
Saying this, he looks out the window,
gazing into the distance.
"My father died when I was four... it
was a situation where at a young age I had
to fend for myself and I had to figure things
out for myself. I paid my way through col
lege; I did it in taking out student loans and
working, and I had to grow up a little faster
than maybe other people did, and what I
learned was I had to take responsibility for
my actions, and that if I wanted to achieve
things in life I was going to have to do it my
selfj and I was going to have to be account
able for the choices I made — and if I made
positive choices, I would get rewards, and if
I made negative choices, I was going to
have to deal with the consequences.
"And I can assure you I made mis
takes along the way — I'm by no means
perfect — but I learned. I learned from
those mistakes, and I leaned on my
mother and my brothers and sisters and
my family — but, really, without growing
up with a positive male influence, I grav
itated towards my coaches as strong
male influences. I found my calling as a
coach, and I try to have the same impact
on young people now."

This is the final piece of a three-part
feature on Shannon Turley, the sports
performance coordinator entering his
seventh season with Stanford football,
Part 111 focuses on Turley's personal
journey and the future.

At the end of the 2010 season,
Stanford football announced
its arrival in the only way that
a truly relevant program
should: by celebrating a com
ing-out party of historic proportions.
The Cardinal closed its 12-1 campaign in
style, opening the new year against Virginia

Tech (VT) in the 2011 Orange Bowl and
crushing the Hokies 40-12. It finished the
season ranked fourth in the country.
Stanford's triumph was an especially big
win for Shannon Thrley, a 'OO graduate of
Virginia Tech, who had seen Tech's rise to
prominence firsthand. While Turley had no
illusions as to which team he wanted to win,
there remained a certain irony to Stan
ford's victory: a Hokie supporter since birth
and an alumnus and former coach to boot,
Turley had naturally sought to help build
Stanford in the VT mold.
"A lot of these programs don't just
spring up out of nowhere," Turley says.
"They were able to do that at Virginia Tech,

so where else can you do that in college
football?"
It turned out that Palo Alto was a
great place to do it.
♦♦♦
Tbrley enjoyed playing Virginia Tech,
if only because it would allow him to see
his friends and family, as well as the man
who gave him his first college coaching
job, VT's strength coach Mike Gentry.
"No one offered me a scholarship to
play football in college; I wasn't even re
ally looked at as a walk-on at Virginia
Tech," Turley explains. "I found out
about their strength program and the job
Mike Gentry was doing, and he got a lot
of credit and praise for his role in Vir
ginia Tech finishing 10-2 when I was a
freshman [in 1995-6] won the Big East
title, beat Texas in the Sugar Bowl. And I
said, 'Well, look, that's what I need to do:
I need to be a strength coach.'"
That season, Virginia Tech had won
its first conference championship and
recorded only the second 10-win season
in school history. The Hokies, coming
from obscurity to become the newly
anointed football power of the Mid-At
lantic, were the toast of the region.
Looking back, Tbrley appreciates the
similarities between his employer and his
alma mater.
"For us, a team built in a blue-collar
work ethic, like [Virginia Tbch], and want
ing to physically dominate our opponents
and impose our will—we saw a lot of our
selves in that program," Tbrley says.
But the eventual strength coach started
not with football but by walking onto the
track team. After a (by his own admission)
mostly unsuccessful year—"l did that just
to get my foot in the door with the strength
and conditioning staff," he says Tbrley
asked Gentry for a job.
"Shannon just showed great interest,
enthusiasm and seemed very motivated,"
Gentry remembers. "I like to see people de
velop and realize their goals and be part of
the process, and I noticed Shannon shares
that interest as well."
It was at Virginia Tech that the under
pinnings of Tbrley's training philosophy fell
into place: weightlifting techniques, to be
sure, but also uncompromising standards,
high expectations and as Gentry's praise
indicates a deep commitment to the
process.
The two men still keep in touch to this
day, swapping stories, tips and experiences.
"We've talked training—he's shared
training philosophies with me." Gentry said.
'And just encouragement. At different
times we've each encouraged each other."
'And of course our teams played in the
Orange Bowl a couple years ago, and they
crushed us. The student kind of taught the
teacher."
♦♦♦
Gentry's sentiment speaks to a deeper
trend in strength training: the lines be
tween student and teacher are constantly
blurred.
In contrast to the public's typical per
ception of the ultra-secretive football coach
—think of Eric Mangini burning his files or
the late A1 Davis' coaching counterespi
onage strength and conditioning coaches
share information freely. In fact, Tbrley will
be speaking at the annual conference of the
National Strength Coaches Association in
July.
"I don't have any secrets, and it's by and
large because I learned it from someone
else," Tbrley says. "Someone was willing to
teach me."
Indeed, Tbrley matured under Gentry's
guidance, but he was also heavily influenced
by his time under Jeff Fish at Missouri, a
coach with a strong reputation for using the

unorthodox exercises that Tbrley now em
ploys.
History tends to blur under these open
circumstances: even Gentry, an Olympic
lifting stalwart, is not sure who was the first
strength coach to apply the Olympic lifts to
football.
With Tbrley the cycle of coaching has
continued. Perhaps the greatest sign of Tbr
ley's achievement as a strength coach is his
staff's coaching turnover: in recent years,
he has lost two of his top assistants, Dave
Forman and Hans Straub, to head strength
coaching positions at Colorado and South
Florida. Needless to say Tbrley will not be
afraid to ask them questions about their
own programs.
"Those are guys that I'll go back to be
cause they were here with me, and say,
'Hey, what are you doing differently' based
on the program that I ran and developed,"
Tbrley says. "If they're having success with
it, then obviously I'd be a fool not to listen to
what they'd been doing."
This symbiotic relationship extends to
Tbrley's players as well as his former
mentees. Many veterans of Tbrley's pro
gram have firmly acknowledged his impact
on their lives, and in turn, Tbrley cites his
former players as a great influence on his
freshmen. As Stanford football alumni visit
and guide the new players, Tbrley sees a cy
cle in the making.
"If we're working to get some change
from some of those young freshmen and
get them to buy into the way we want them
to work, and they're immature and some
what reluctant to do it and they see those
great players that are now great NFL play

The Cardinal closed its 12-1 campaign in
style, opening the new year against Virginia

Tech (VT) in the 2011 Orange Bowl and
crushing the Hokies 40-12. It finished the
season ranked fourth in the country.
Stanford's triumph was an especially big
win for Shannon Thrley, a 'OO graduate of
Virginia Tech, who had seen Tech's rise to
prominence firsthand. While Turley had no
illusions as to which team he wanted to win,
there remained a certain irony to Stan
ford's victory: a Hokie supporter since birth
and an alumnus and former coach to boot,
Turley had naturally sought to help build
Stanford in the VT mold.
"A lot of these programs don't just
spring up out of nowhere," Turley says.
"They were able to do that at Virginia Tech,

so where else can you do that in college
football?"
It turned out that Palo Alto was a
great place to do it.
♦♦♦
Tbrley enjoyed playing Virginia Tech,
if only because it would allow him to see
his friends and family, as well as the man
who gave him his first college coaching
job, VT's strength coach Mike Gentry.
"No one offered me a scholarship to
play football in college; I wasn't even re
ally looked at as a walk-on at Virginia
Tech," Turley explains. "I found out
about their strength program and the job
Mike Gentry was doing, and he got a lot
of credit and praise for his role in Vir
ginia Tech finishing 10-2 when I was a
freshman [in 1995-6] won the Big East
title, beat Texas in the Sugar Bowl. And I
said, 'Well, look, that's what I need to do:
I need to be a strength coach.'"
That season, Virginia Tech had won
its first conference championship and
recorded only the second 10-win season
in school history. The Hokies, coming
from obscurity to become the newly
anointed football power of the Mid-At
lantic, were the toast of the region.
Looking back, Tbrley appreciates the
similarities between his employer and his
alma mater.
"For us, a team built in a blue-collar
work ethic, like [Virginia Tbch], and want
ing to physically dominate our opponents
and impose our will—we saw a lot of our
selves in that program," Tbrley says.
But the eventual strength coach started
not with football but by walking onto the
track team. After a (by his own admission)
mostly unsuccessful year—"l did that just
to get my foot in the door with the strength
and conditioning staff," he says Tbrley
asked Gentry for a job.
"Shannon just showed great interest,
enthusiasm and seemed very motivated,"
Gentry remembers. "I like to see people de
velop and realize their goals and be part of
the process, and I noticed Shannon shares
that interest as well."
It was at Virginia Tech that the under
pinnings of Tbrley's training philosophy fell
into place: weightlifting techniques, to be
sure, but also uncompromising standards,
high expectations and as Gentry's praise
indicates a deep commitment to the
process.
The two men still keep in touch to this
day, swapping stories, tips and experiences.
"We've talked training—he's shared
training philosophies with me." Gentry said.
'And just encouragement. At different
times we've each encouraged each other."
'And of course our teams played in the
Orange Bowl a couple years ago, and they
crushed us. The student kind of taught the
teacher."
♦♦♦
Gentry's sentiment speaks to a deeper
trend in strength training: the lines be
tween student and teacher are constantly
blurred.
In contrast to the public's typical per
ception of the ultra-secretive football coach
—think of Eric Mangini burning his files or
the late A1 Davis' coaching counterespi
onage strength and conditioning coaches
share information freely. In fact, Tbrley will
be speaking at the annual conference of the
National Strength Coaches Association in
July.
"I don't have any secrets, and it's by and
large because I learned it from someone
else," Tbrley says. "Someone was willing to
teach me."
Indeed, Tbrley matured under Gentry's
guidance, but he was also heavily influenced
by his time under Jeff Fish at Missouri, a
coach with a strong reputation for using the

unorthodox exercises that Tbrley now em
ploys.
History tends to blur under these open
circumstances: even Gentry, an Olympic
lifting stalwart, is not sure who was the first
strength coach to apply the Olympic lifts to
football.
With Tbrley the cycle of coaching has
continued. Perhaps the greatest sign of Tbr
ley's achievement as a strength coach is his
staff's coaching turnover: in recent years,
he has lost two of his top assistants, Dave
Forman and Hans Straub, to head strength
coaching positions at Colorado and South
Florida. Needless to say Tbrley will not be
afraid to ask them questions about their
own programs.
"Those are guys that I'll go back to be
cause they were here with me, and say,
'Hey, what are you doing differently' based
on the program that I ran and developed,"
Tbrley says. "If they're having success with
it, then obviously I'd be a fool not to listen to
what they'd been doing."
This symbiotic relationship extends to
Tbrley's players as well as his former
mentees. Many veterans of Tbrley's pro
gram have firmly acknowledged his impact
on their lives, and in turn, Tbrley cites his
former players as a great influence on his
freshmen. As Stanford football alumni visit
and guide the new players, Tbrley sees a cy
cle in the making.
"If we're working to get some change
from some of those young freshmen and
get them to buy into the way we want them
to work, and they're immature and some
what reluctant to do it and they see those
great players that are now great NFL play
ers here, training and doing it our way
seeking coaching and wanting to do it our
way, well, it makes it a little easier for them
to buy in," Tbrley says. "It makes my job
easier. So I'm happy to work with them and
thrilled to have them around."
Alex Debniak concurs. 'As the younger
kids started coming in," he says, "they
started to see that, and they wanted to have
that as well. Novy there's a combined cama
raderie: to be aggressive and to be tough
and to give out for each other. I think that's
really the biggest thing that's changed,
without a doubt."
♦♦♦
With an NFL factory in the making, a
massive facilities expansion underway and
three straight BCS bowls under his belt,
one could forgive Shannon Tbrley for eas
ing his foot off the accelerator a bit
However, coaches are not known for
their tendency to relax.
"I don't think I'm ever 'satisfied.' I don't
think anyone's ever 'satisfied,'" Tbrley says.
In particular, Tbrley sees the need to
build Stanford football into not only a con
sistent winner but an enduring institution
in Stanford and Northern California. Stan
ford's relatively small local alumni popula
tion means that it traditionally relies on
non-alumni fans to fill the bulk of its stadi
um.
"I would love it if people in the area were
more passionate about football," Tbrley ex
plains. "It hurts to have a great team play
so well at home and play a Pac-12 Champi
onship Game in front of less than a full sta
dium. But you also understand —that's
part of the culture that you're in, and we
embrace that. Having grown up where I
did, you know football's really important,
but there's also a lot less going on."
About to leave the Farm, Debniak is re
flective about that side of Cardinal football
as well.
"I think, when you first get to Stanford,
you have these dreams of grandeur—
everyone's always thinking, you know, the
LSUs or the Alabamas, having women af
ter you... everything like that," he says. "At

least from my personal perspective, when I
first got here as a freshman, I was a little
disappointed. I was like, this can't be what
it's all about."
"But I've come to realize that yes, you
give a lot of yourself to come in here, but
you need to sacrifice your pride and you
need to humble yourself, coming here. This
place will do that to you. And I think as I've
matured and gotten older here, I've come
to realize that this place is bigger than me,
it's bigger than the team."

As Thrley watches his players grow
closer into a second family, he also recog
nizes the need for a family of his own. He re
cently got engaged to his girlfriend, a nurse
working at Stanford Hospital's angiogra
phy lab. Displaying a keen flair for the mo
ment, he made sure to propose on New
"fear's Day right after Stanford won the
Rose Bowl.
Thrley is at a special period of his life,
and the setting of his proposal further ac
centuates the intersection between his life
and his career. He is embarking on two
great unfolding adventures: Stanford foot
ball is fielding its finest teams in seventy
years, and soon Thrley will be awaiting his
bride at the altar.
"We're getting married in June," he
says and smiles.
With both his personal and coaching
lives on the upswing and a bright future
ahead, it seems as though Thrley has found
his place at Stanford.
"I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying
here," he says. "I've had opportunities to go
other places and I choose to stay here. I love
working with the guys that I get a chance to
work with every day, and my profession and
my role —that's what I do, I spend time
with the players. I love those guys and the
opportunity to grind with them every day is
not something I am willing to walk away
from for more money or what I perceive to
be a "better job.'
"There's nothing else I could do and be
happy" he continues. "I tell people when
they want to be volunteer interns: if there's
something else that you could do and be
happy then you should go do that, because
there's not enough money there's not
enough credit, there's not enough free time.
It's a consuming profession, but it's very re
warding because of the impact that you can
have on the young men and women that you
get a chance to work with."
Saying this, he looks out the window,
gazing into the distance.
"My father died when I was four... it
was a situation where at a young age I had
to fend for myself and I had to figure things
out for myself. I paid my way through col
lege; I did it in taking out student loans and
working, and I had to grow up a little faster
than maybe other people did, and what I
learned was I had to take responsibility for
my actions, and that if I wanted to achieve
things in life I was going to have to do it my
selfj and I was going to have to be account
able for the choices I made — and if I made
positive choices, I would get rewards, and if
I made negative choices, I was going to
have to deal with the consequences.
"And I can assure you I made mis
takes along the way — I'm by no means
perfect — but I learned. I learned from
those mistakes, and I leaned on my
mother and my brothers and sisters and
my family — but, really, without growing
up with a positive male influence, I grav
itated towards my coaches as strong
male influences. I found my calling as a
coach, and I try to have the same impact
on young people now."
