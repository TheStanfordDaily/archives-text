# Living wage policy under fire
## Activists cite lack of coverage, differing burdens 
### FOLUKE NUNN 
Ten years after the creation of
Stanford's living wage policy, the pro
gram has seen significant alterations
while continuing to serve as a source of
controversy.
The policy, which is reviewed annu
ally by University Human Resources,
was established to ensure that Stan
ford employees providing services
such as maintenance, housing, food
service and groundskeeping earn
enough money to cover them basic
needs.
As of October 2012, the policy stip
ulates that workers must be paid a
minimum hourly wage of $12.40 if then
employer provides health insurance. If
health insurance is not provided, the
workers must be paid a minimum
hourly rate of $14.10.
The policy also requires employers
to provide 10 compensated days off an
nually for full-time employees who
have worked with the contractor for at
least one year.
Monitoring contractors
According to Vice President for
Business Affairs and Chief Financial
Officer Randy Livingston '75 M.B.A.
'79, Stanford regularly audits all major
contractors to ensure that they comply
with the living wage policy.
"When we find contractors that
have not been in compliance, we re
quire them to correct their perform
ance, including [providing] additional
back pay to those contractor employ
ees who were underpaid," Livingston

wrote in a statement to The Daily.
However, some critics of Stanford's
policy argued that the University
should monitor contractors more
closely, to ensure that the living wage
policy is being followed.
Professor Emeritus of Law William
Gould suggested that the University
and students create "some sort of mon
itoring mechanism" for contractors un
der the living wage policy, boosting the
likelihood of contractors complying
with the policy by having someone
"looking over their shoulder and press
ing them."
Laurel Fish 'l4 and Najja Kossally
'l3, members of the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition (SLAC), a student
group that was instrumental in imple
menting the living wage policy, agreed
that students should be more involved
in implementing and regulating the liv
ing wage policy.
"Currently the living wage is up
dated behind closed doors by adminis
trators only, and we would like the
process to involve students as well,"
Kossally said.
Fish said that the first step toward
more student involvement in the living
wage policy is educating students
about the issue.
"Right now there's a lack of aware
ness about what a living wage is and
why it's important," Fish said, adding
that while some students know about
Stanford's living wage policy, many are
unaware of its exceptions.
Fish cited the lack of coverage af
forded some workers including
some independent contractors, em
ployees at the Stanford Hospital
and employees of tenant businesses
that lease space on Stanford's prop
erty, such as stores at the Stanford
Shopping Center and non-Stanford
operated eateries on campus as
one such exception.
Fish and Kossally argued that
those workers are the most vulner
able to mistreatment by managers,
largely due to their isolation from
students who might otherwise mon
itor the workers' treatment.
Supporting different burdens
Gould identified further issues
with the living wage policy, includ

ing the University's lack of an accu
rate measure of average family
size. Under Stanford's current poli
cy, the living wage does not vary
based on a worker's family situa
tion and thus may be insufficient in
some cases.
In his statement, Livingston ac
knowledged that "the cost of living
for a family is quite different from a
single individual" but emphasized
that he has "never heard of any em
ployer who varies compensation
based on an employee's family situ
ation."
A full-time employee of a cam
pus eatery not covered by the living
wage policy said that she is current
ly paid $12.50 per hour, a rate high
er than the minimum wage set by
both Stanford and Santa Clara
County but one at which she still
struggles to make ends meet.
"As an employee, it would be
nice to get higher wages. Just for

someone to work at Stanford
there's parking to consider, there's
gas to consider, there's rent to con
sider," she said. "However, Califor
nia isn't in the best of financial
states right now. It just sucks it
sucks on both ends."
Another campus eatery employ
ee, who is covered by the living
wage policy, is paid $17.57 per hour.
She said that she believes the cur
rent living wage of $12.40 is not
enough to support someone living
in the Bay Area.
"Let's be real. They charge an
arm and a leg in this area Silicon
Valley is costly," she said. "I don't
have children, and I was fortunate
enough to get a place where my
rent was based on my income ... but
if it wasn't for that I don't know how
I would make it."
