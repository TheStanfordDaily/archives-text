# Living wage policy under fire
## Activists cite lack of coverage, differing burdens 
### FOLUKE NUNN 
Ten years after the creation of
Stanford's living wage policy, the pro
gram has seen significant alterations
while continuing to serve as a source of
controversy.
The policy, which is reviewed annu
ally by University Human Resources,
was established to ensure that Stan
ford employees providing services
such as maintenance, housing, food
service and groundskeeping earn
enough money to cover them basic
needs.
As of October 2012, the policy stip
ulates that workers must be paid a
minimum hourly wage of $12.40 if then
employer provides health insurance. If
health insurance is not provided, the
workers must be paid a minimum
hourly rate of $14.10.
The policy also requires employers
to provide 10 compensated days off an
nually for full-time employees who
have worked with the contractor for at
least one year.
Monitoring contractors
According to Vice President for
Business Affairs and Chief Financial
Officer Randy Livingston '75 M.B.A.
'79, Stanford regularly audits all major
contractors to ensure that they comply
with the living wage policy.
"When we find contractors that
have not been in compliance, we re
quire them to correct their perform
ance, including [providing] additional
back pay to those contractor employ
ees who were underpaid," Livingston

wrote in a statement to The Daily.
However, some critics of Stanford's
policy argued that the University
should monitor contractors more
closely, to ensure that the living wage
policy is being followed.
Professor Emeritus of Law William
Gould suggested that the University
and students create "some sort of mon
itoring mechanism" for contractors un
der the living wage policy, boosting the
likelihood of contractors complying
with the policy by having someone
"looking over their shoulder and press
ing them."
Laurel Fish 'l4 and Najja Kossally
'l3, members of the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition (SLAC), a student
group that was instrumental in imple
menting the living wage policy, agreed
that students should be more involved
in implementing and regulating the liv
ing wage policy.
"Currently the living wage is up
dated behind closed doors by adminis
trators only, and we would like the
process to involve students as well,"
Kossally said.
Fish said that the first step toward
more student involvement in the living
wage policy is educating students
about the issue.
"Right now there's a lack of aware
ness about what a living wage is and
why it's important," Fish said, adding
that while some students know about
Stanford's living wage policy, many are
unaware of its exceptions.
