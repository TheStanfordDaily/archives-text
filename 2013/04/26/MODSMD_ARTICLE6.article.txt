# CAMPUS LIFE
## Ogwumike leaves mark in Nigeria 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
If spring practices for the Stan
ford women's basketball team feel a
little empty, it may be because two
time All-American and Pac-12 Play
er of the Year Chiney Ogwumike
'l4 is halfway around the world,
studying abroad in Nigeria.
"It's definitely different because
she is such a big leader for us," said
teammate Sara James 'l4. "We're
obviously missing her because she's
such a hard worker and she is a
loud voice in the gym. It actually all
happened kind of fast the whole
Nigeria thing."

Having garnered national
praise for her on-court dominance,
Ogwumike has more recently at
tained a different kind of recogni
tion for using her platform as a suc
cessful student-athlete to help oth
ers and serve as a philanthropist.
"Just being a Stanford student
athlete, people tend to see you as
more than just an athlete," Ogwu
mike said. "I want to leave my own
mark that it's not about what you
do as an individual. It's about what
you do for other people, so that's
my goal. I want to be able to en
courage people to find their passion
and use those opportunities to
achieve something and find a better
life. I think that's what sports did
for me."

Giving back
This quarter, Ogwumike will be
fulfilling the international relations
major's study abroad requirement
by serving as an assistant to the
senior advisor for the minister of
petroleum in her parents' native
Nigeria for seven weeks.
However, Ogwumike said that
she most looks forward to the last
week of her time in Nigeria when
she will be volunteering for Access
to Success (A2S), a non-profit foun-
dation based in Benin City
that aims to provide under
privileged youth with athlet
ic, educational and spiritual
programs.
"When things should be
winding down [after the sea
son], they're really ramping
up," Ogwumike said. "So go
ing to Nigeria is going to be
crazy."
Ogwumike knew when
she chose to major in inter
national relations that the
lengthy basketball season
would make studying abroad
through a Stanford program
challenging. However, she
was determined to fulfill the
study abroad requirement
and complete her specializa
tion in Comparative Interna
tional Governance and
Africa.
That opportunity finally
presented itself this year
when her internship and
planned volunteer work fell
into place.
As part of that volunteer
work, Ogwumike started an
A2S campaign The
Dream Team: Let's Build a
Court in February. The
campaign aims to raise
$30,000 by June, through
fundraising and grants, to
build a basketball court in
tended to break down barri
ers for girls in sports and to
promote confidence in the
next generation. Ogwumike
will also lead afterschool
programs in leadership and
basketball clinics.
"In high school I was al
ways in student council and
civil rights club, so all these
things have meant a lot to
me," she said. "I came to col
lege so caught up with bas
ketball and doing well in
classes that now I want to do
something so that I can leave
my mark not only at Stan
ford, but knowing that I
came to this university and I
did something special. So
I've been looking for oppor
tunities [to make a differ
ence] but it's hard to do
something on your own."
Ogwumike found that op
portunity after talking with
Solomon Hughes, an aca
demic advisor for student
athletes, who recommended

Ogwumike to his friend An
drew Lovedale, A2S's
founder and a native Niger
ian who played college bas
ketball at Davidson.
"I told him [Lovedale] I
was willing to do anything,"
Ogwumike said. "So I built
my campaign and I loved the
court idea because it's relat
ed to basketball and I'm try
ing to make it as successful
as it can be."
A different experience
Ogwumike's desire to
give back may stem from her
father, Peter, who worked for
Hewlett-Packard before
leaving to start a communi
cations company in Nigeria
to bring technology to peo
ple.
"I'm really happy she will
come here to learn. Visiting
is different, but living you
really get into the culture,"
Peter Ogwumike told the As
sociated Press. "We can use
every bit of help we can from
outside."
This will be Ogwumike's
longest time away from
campus since starting her
career on the Farm and her
first time going back to
Nigeria in four years. Two
summers ago, instead of
traveling back with her fam
ily, she chose to stay on cam
pus for summer session to
get ahead in her major and
spend more time honing her
basketball skills.
The trip was originally
scheduled for the summer,
but she changed her plans
because she wanted to be
able to take full advantage of
her last true summer before
becoming a professional.
"This summer is really
important. I not only want to
work on my skills for basket
ball, I want to be able to go
visit Nneka [Ogwumike 'l2]
more freely this summer,"
she said. "I haven't seen my
[younger] sisters play bas
ketball since they were 10
and 12 and they're now in
high school, so I want to be
able to slip away on week
ends."
Although Ogwumike will
not take part in formal
spring training this year, she
will work out in Nigeria to
get ready for summer prac
tices and her final season of
basketball on the Farm. Og
wumike acknowledged, how
ever, that missing spring

quarter will mean an elevat
ed workload next year on
top of the season's pressures
â€”in order to graduate on
time.
During her time on the
Farm, Ogwumike has mas
tered the art of balancing a
student-athlete's schedule,
maintaining a 3.41 GPA
while, among other activities,
serving on the Cardinal
Council and helping to or
ganize the Athlete Date Auc
tion.
"It doesn't surprise me at
all [her desire to do good],"
said teammate Joslyn Tinkle
'l3. "That's just the way she
is. She is always a busy bee,
trying to get into new things
and taking advantage of all of
her connections, and that's
something that I really ad
mire in her."
Hughes expressed opti
mism that Ogwumike's time
in Nigeria might increase
awareness of athletes' poten
tial to create an impact be
yond their sport.
"Chiney is unique without
question," Hughes said. "But
one of the things that should
be praised about the Stan
ford culture is that the atti
tude around here for stu
dent-athletes is that not only
do they want to thrive athlet
ically, but they also want to
thrive academically and also
thrive in regards to how they
serve people around them."
According to women's
basketball head coach Tara
VanDerveer, Ogwumike's
absence will also contribute
to the growth of the women's
basketball team as a whole.
While VanDerveer empha
sized how much Ogwumike's
enthusiasm and leadership is
missed, she also stressed the
importance of other players
seizing the opportunity to be
more vocal leaders within
the team.
"We depend on her so
much all year that this is the
time for other people to step
up, which we need them to
for next year," VanDerveer
said. "But we miss every
thing about her her en
thusiasm, her awesome play
but I've been following
her on Facebook and she's a
happy person and this is go
ing to be a great experience
for her."
