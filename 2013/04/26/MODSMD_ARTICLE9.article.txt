## Drinking up the Draft in New York City 
### Sam Fisher 
Last night reminded me of
how the most seemingly
boring sporting events can
sometimes be the most fun.
Those of you in the know
must have already figured it out I'm
talking about the NFL Draft.
Five years ago—yes, I'm reminisc
ing again I went to the NFL
Draft at Radio City Music Hall in
New York, and it was awesome.
See, what makes the draft fun to
watch on television is the actual
draft: which teams are going to
trade, will your favorite team draft
that quarterback you want so badly,
how will my Eagles screw it up again.
They're all fun for a big football fan
like me.

But attending the draft in person
is fun for a whole other laundry list of
reasons. For example, did you know
that Buffalo Bills fans exist in places
outside of Buffalo? I certainly hadn't
ever seen one before that day.
Every type of fan was welcome.
Sure, some got teased more than oth
ers, but it was all in good fun.
Except for Patriots fans.
I never thought I'd find a place in
New York City where my views as an
Eagles fan were so welcome. While
waiting in line blocks down the road
from Radio City, every few minutes I
would hear a rumble. As the seconds
ticked by, the rumble turned louder.
Eventually, a minute later, it would
reach a roar.
A roar of boos.
Because that noise meant that a
Patriot fan was walking from the
front of the line, where he thought he
would just sneak in, all the way to the
back with the rest of us. And every
single person he walked past along
the way chipped in with some boos.

The Draft wasn't all fun
and games. Unfortunately, as
I mentioned above, I'm a
Philadelphia Eagles fan. I
joke that making me an Ea
gles fan is one of the worst
things my dad could've done
tome.
But back in that era, unlike
last night where I got to enjoy
the Eagles making a smart
choice in Oklahoma offensive
tackle Lane Johnson in Chip
Kelly's first year as head
coach, I had to sit through the
nightmare that is an Andy
Reid draft.
After taking a 7 a.m. bus to
Manhattan, waiting in line for

hours, taking a quick break
for lunch and sitting through
18 long picks, my good friend
and I finally got we had wanted
for: the Eagles were on the
clock.
A few minutes later, with us
on our feet leading "E-A-G-L-
E-S Eagles" chants, the an
nouncer told the crowd there
had been a trade. Start the
waiting room clock again.
And it was a long clock. The
Eagles moved down 25 picks in
the trade with Carolina. As
much fun as the draft is, watch
ing other teams pick before
your team pick after pick gets
pretty rough.
But Andy Reid hadn't even
pulled his final trick. When the
Eagles finally came back on the
clock again and with the top
wide receivers still tantaMng
ly available, Reid did the un

thinkable: he traded down
again.
At that point, we became
the laughingstocks of Radio
City. Out of all the things Andy
had done in his tenure, that mo
ment was about as angry as I'd
ever been.
How could Andy do that?
How could he ruin what had
been one of the most fun sports
days I'd ever had?
But redemption was com
ing. After one of the longest
(non-work) days I've ever had,
Andy came through. With the
49th pick, the Eagles took my
man DeSean Jackson I
wouldn't hate his alma mater
Cal until I got my acceptance
letter from Stanford 20 months
later and I went home hap
py-
So what's the point of this
whole thing? Besides allowing

myself to write another self-in
dulging column and what do
you expect from a columnist
who writes on #Throwßack-
Thursdays I wanted to give
you a glimpse into the NFL
Draft.
I've been to a Super Bowl.
I've been to the MLB playoffs.
The NFL Draft was more fun
than either. It's a cross between
sports talk radio, a tailgate
party and opening day. If you
have a chance, you have to go.
And wear your favorite jersey.

Sam Fisher mil be back at the
20U NFL Draft, where the
Eagles can certainly expect to
have the first pick after yet an
other disastrous season. Tell

How could Andy do that?
How could he ruin what had
been one of the most fun sports
days I'd ever had?
But redemption was com
ing. After one of the longest
(non-work) days I've ever had,
Andy came through. With the
49th pick, the Eagles took my
man DeSean Jackson I
wouldn't hate his alma mater
Cal until I got my acceptance
letter from Stanford 20 months
later and I went home hap
py-
So what's the point of this
whole thing? Besides allowing

myself to write another self-in
dulging column and what do
you expect from a columnist
who writes on #Throwßack-
Thursdays I wanted to give
you a glimpse into the NFL
Draft.
I've been to a Super Bowl.
I've been to the MLB playoffs.
The NFL Draft was more fun
than either. It's a cross between
sports talk radio, a tailgate
party and opening day. If you
have a chance, you have to go.
And wear your favorite jersey.

Sam Fisher mil be back at the
20U NFL Draft, where the
Eagles can certainly expect to
have the first pick after yet an
other disastrous season. Tell
him there's no need to be nos
talgic at safisher@ Stanford,
