## Drinking up the Draft in New York City 
### Sam Fisher 
Last night reminded me of
how the most seemingly
boring sporting events can
sometimes be the most fun.
Those of you in the know
must have already figured it out I'm
talking about the NFL Draft.
Five years agoâ€”yes, I'm reminisc
ing again I went to the NFL
Draft at Radio City Music Hall in
New York, and it was awesome.
See, what makes the draft fun to
watch on television is the actual
draft: which teams are going to
trade, will your favorite team draft
that quarterback you want so badly,
how will my Eagles screw it up again.
They're all fun for a big football fan
like me.

But attending the draft in person
is fun for a whole other laundry list of
reasons. For example, did you know
that Buffalo Bills fans exist in places
outside of Buffalo? I certainly hadn't
ever seen one before that day.
Every type of fan was welcome.
Sure, some got teased more than oth
ers, but it was all in good fun.
Except for Patriots fans.
I never thought I'd find a place in
New York City where my views as an
Eagles fan were so welcome. While
waiting in line blocks down the road
from Radio City, every few minutes I
would hear a rumble. As the seconds
ticked by, the rumble turned louder.
Eventually, a minute later, it would
reach a roar.
A roar of boos.
Because that noise meant that a
Patriot fan was walking from the
front of the line, where he thought he
would just sneak in, all the way to the
back with the rest of us. And every
single person he walked past along
the way chipped in with some boos.
