John Merrow's latest film, based on 6 1/2 years of filming in
post-Katrina New Orleans, reveals how a failing school system
has become a fair-to-middling system of public charter schools.
The cast of characters in the one-hour documentary includes Brittne
Jackson, a 19-year-old senior who has failed the graduation exit
exam about a dozen times; Bobby Calvin, an engaging young man
chafing under the harsh behavior code at his charter high school;
two Teach for America corps members having dramatically different
classroom experiences; and Clarke Bordelon, a special needs student
whose mother cannot find a charter school willing to take on the
challenge of teaching her son. As the film reveals, real change is
possible, but anyone looking for a silver bullet will be disappointed.
Merrow and Professor Carter will use the film as a springboard to a
broad range of issues. Audience participation will be encouraged.
