## Raiders and 49ers:A tale of two drafts 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
There was a point in the last
10 years when the 49ers
and Raiders both seemed
destined for decades of
mediocrity.
The Raiders cycled through head
coaches faster than Roman
Abramovich fired his managers at
Chelsea FC; meanwhile, the 49ers
conspired to blow seemingly every
draft pick they caught sight of and
trotted out a pupu platter of horren
dous quarterbacks in the post Jeff
Garcia era.
Fast forward to today, and the di
chotomy couldn't be clearer; the
49ers are among the kingpins of the
NFL, while the Raiders are among
the most holey (as opposed to holy)
rosters in all of professional football,
potentially including college as well.
The turnaround has been stunning.

Never was this more evident than
in the NFL Draft that just concluded.
The 49ers filled every need on
their roster, took calculated risks
on potentially game-changing
players and played the game of
numbers better than just about
anyone else.
San Francisco squashed swirling
speculations of a deteriorating sec
ondary in an otherwise fearsome de
fense by picking up LSU safety Eric
Reid. Reid isn't Darrelle Revis by
any means, but the young man al
ready wants to be the cause of many
sleepless nights for Aaron Rodgers.
Unlike the Raiders (cough, JaMarcus
Russell, cough), the 49ers had the
common sense to know that the
SEC's strength lies in defense, not of
fense. Picking up Stanford's own
Zach Ertz wasn't a bad idea, either,
considering that the 49ers needed a
promising replacement for Delanie
Walker.
The Raiders? Because of the ill
advised and shortsighted trade for
Carson Palmer, they found them
selves with a dearth of picks and sad
ly possessed a very high pick in a
draft that had no real elite talent past
the first two picks. They were forced
to trade out of a great position in or
der to recoup all the picks they had
frittered away over the years.
The reason for this drastic change
in fortunes can be attributed to a few
major and key philosophical differ
ences between the two organizations.
The 49ers made the conscious move
to hire an incredibly talented front of
fice, led by secretive GM Trent
Baalke, and mortgaged the farm to
raid The Farm for head coach Jim
Harbaugh (pun fully intended).
This new regime a breath of
fresh air after the backstabbing of
head coach Mike Nolan and the plain
idiocy of the Mike Singletary era
built the team around a core of great
draft picks and smart and inexpen
sive free-agent signings. It put to
gether a firm system within which
players could thrive.
Meanwhile, the Raiders did no
such thing. They hired and fired
coaches at a whim, used the brilliant
draft strategy of "speed, speed,
speed" and otherwise tried to fit
square pegs into A1 Davis-shaped
holes (may he ever rest in peace). The
consequences of those ten wasted
years are clearly evident now, as the
Raiders can barely put a CFL-quali
ty team on the field.
The Raiders drafted for quantity
over quality; with so many glaring
holes, they need to get some actual
bodies on their team for cheap prices
as they begin the tough rebuilding
process. As they move forward, they
might want to look across the Bay at
the 49ers for how to rise from the
ashes.
However, one piece of advice
holds universally: when your top pick
nearly died from a heart condition, he
might not be the best investment of
your pick and your money.
