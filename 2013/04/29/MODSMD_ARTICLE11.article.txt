# READY FOR PAC-12
## CARD LOOKS TO DEPTH IN TOURNEY 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Senior Andrew Yun will seek to repeat as indi
vidual conference champion as he leads the No. 9
Stanford men's golf team into the first round of
the Pac-12 Championships today at the Los Ange
les Country Club. The Cardinal is vying for its
first Pac-12 title since 1994.
"We're excited about the course [LA North],"
head coach Conrad Ray, a freshman on the 1994
team, said. "It was actually designed by the same
architect who designed the Stanford golf course,
George Thomas. So there's some similarities in
the layout and the framework of the course, and
we're looking forward to getting down there and
playing well."
But No. 8 Stanford will likely have to rely on its
depth and endurance and not its course familiari
ty if it is to improve on its sixth place finish of a
year ago. The Pac-12 Tournament is unique in that
it will record five scores each day instead of the
regular four, and the event will be 72 holes instead
of 54.
"It's a six-man, count-five tournament and
we've appreciated our depth this year and tried to
build upon that," Ray said. "With an extra person
in the lineup and an extra score to count, we're
hoping the depth on our team will pay off for us
well as we get into the event."
Yun is aiming to become the fourth Stanford
golfer with multiple Pac-12 titles, a group that in
cludes Pete Choate ('62, '64), Mike Peck ('77, '7B)
and Christian Cevaer ('B9, '92). Despite being the
defending champion, he doesn't think history will
help him one iota.
"It doesn't matter whether I'm the defending
champion or not," Yun stated. "It doesn't give me
any advantage once I step on that first tee. What
it does give me is confidence that I've been in the
situation before and succeeded, so if I'm in a simi
lar situation this year I'll know what to do."
Although Yun enters as Stanford's highest re
turning finisher, sophomore Patrick Rodgers fig
ures to be Stanford's top man as he has been for
most of the season. Rodgers will surely be looking
to improve upon his eighth-place finish in the con
ference tournament last year, garnering Pac-12
Freshman of the Year honors in the process.
Rodgers knows the course will be challenging and
that "par is an extremely good score," but believes
the team is ready to challenge for the win in an ul
tra-competitive league.

Junior Cameron Wilson (above), ranked in the nation's top-50, looks forward to this year's
Pac-12 Championships as a fresh start after being disqualified in last season's tournament.
"We are very confident,"
Rodgers commented on the
team's mentality. "We feel
that we have gotten better
and progressed as the spring
has continued and now it's
about playing well when it
counts. These are the
biggest events of the year
and we are prepared to play
our best. Now it comes down
to performing when it counts
and we are up to that chal
lenge."
In addition, Rodgers may
have to rearrange his current
trophy case or purchase a
new one, as he was again
named to the eight-man
Palmer Cup team, which
competes at an international
collegiate golf event between
the US and Europe, and as a
semifinalist for the Ben
Hogan Award (collegiate
golf's MVP).
Junior Cameron Wilson,
Stanford's third top-50 play
er, had his 2012 Pac-12 Tour
nament end prematurely due
to disqualification from sign
ing an incorrect scorecard.
One of the Cardinal's most
consistent players during the
spring season, Wilson seems
to have put the past behind
him and is focusing on the
specific aspects of the course
he can exploit in order to
score well.
"LA North has some wide
fairways, but on most holes

there are still advantages to
being accurate off the tee,"
Wilson remarked. "Usually
one side of the fairway offers
a better angle or lie than does
the other. I've been driving it
well and should be able to
take advantage of this."
Senior Steve Kearney,
junior Shane Lebow and
freshman David Boote round
out the rest of the lineup.
Stanford will face ex
tremely stiff competition:
there are four Pac-12 teams
in the Golf Week team rank
ings and seven in the top-50,
including No. 1 California,
No. 5 UCLA and No. 7 Wash
ington. As for the individual
race, Rodgers, ranked No. 6
in the nation, will battle with
top-ranked Michael Kim of
Cal and 2013 Western Inter
collegiate champion Pedro
Figueiredo of UCLA.
"Our guys played well in
qualifying last week and
we're looking forward to see
ing how it pans-out," Ray
said. "The feel of the course
is that it will be set up very
difficult, there will be a high
premium on hitting the ball
in the fairway and relying on
a good short game to shoot a
good score. We're the
fourth-ranked team in the
conference and still eighth in
the national rankings, so
that gives an indication of
how strong the field will be.
It's a neat opportunity and
one that we're looking for
ward to."

the other. I've been driving it
well and should be able to
take advantage of this."
Senior Steve Kearney,
junior Shane Lebow and
freshman David Boote round
out the rest of the lineup.
Stanford will face ex
tremely stiff competition:
there are four Pac-12 teams
in the Golf Week team rank
ings and seven in the top-50,
including No. 1 California,
No. 5 UCLA and No. 7 Wash
ington. As for the individual
race, Rodgers, ranked No. 6
in the nation, will battle with
top-ranked Michael Kim of
Cal and 2013 Western Inter
collegiate champion Pedro
Figueiredo of UCLA.
"Our guys played well in
qualifying last week and
we're looking forward to see
ing how it pans-out," Ray
said. "The feel of the course
is that it will be set up very
difficult, there will be a high
premium on hitting the ball
in the fairway and relying on
a good short game to shoot a
good score. We're the
fourth-ranked team in the
conference and still eighth in
the national rankings, so
that gives an indication of
how strong the field will be.
It's a neat opportunity and
one that we're looking for
ward to."

Senior Andrew Yun will seek to repeat as indi
vidual conference champion as he leads the No. 9
Stanford men's golf team into the first round of
the Pac-12 Championships today at the Los Ange
les Country Club. The Cardinal is vying for its
first Pac-12 title since 1994.
"We're excited about the course [LA North],"
head coach Conrad Ray, a freshman on the 1994
team, said. "It was actually designed by the same
architect who designed the Stanford golf course,
George Thomas. So there's some similarities in
the layout and the framework of the course, and
we're looking forward to getting down there and
playing well."
But No. 8 Stanford will likely have to rely on its
depth and endurance and not its course familiari
ty if it is to improve on its sixth place finish of a
year ago. The Pac-12 Tournament is unique in that
it will record five scores each day instead of the
regular four, and the event will be 72 holes instead
of 54.
"It's a six-man, count-five tournament and
we've appreciated our depth this year and tried to
build upon that," Ray said. "With an extra person
in the lineup and an extra score to count, we're
hoping the depth on our team will pay off for us
well as we get into the event."
Yun is aiming to become the fourth Stanford
golfer with multiple Pac-12 titles, a group that in
cludes Pete Choate ('62, '64), Mike Peck ('77, '7B)
and Christian Cevaer ('B9, '92). Despite being the
defending champion, he doesn't think history will
help him one iota.
"It doesn't matter whether I'm the defending
champion or not," Yun stated. "It doesn't give me
any advantage once I step on that first tee. What
it does give me is confidence that I've been in the
situation before and succeeded, so if I'm in a simi
lar situation this year I'll know what to do."
Although Yun enters as Stanford's highest re
turning finisher, sophomore Patrick Rodgers fig
ures to be Stanford's top man as he has been for
most of the season. Rodgers will surely be looking
to improve upon his eighth-place finish in the con
ference tournament last year, garnering Pac-12
Freshman of the Year honors in the process.
Rodgers knows the course will be challenging and
that "par is an extremely good score," but believes
the team is ready to challenge for the win in an ul
tra-competitive league.

Junior Cameron Wilson (above), ranked in the nation's top-50, looks forward to this year's
Pac-12 Championships as a fresh start after being disqualified in last season's tournament.
"We are very confident,"
Rodgers commented on the
team's mentality. "We feel
that we have gotten better
and progressed as the spring
has continued and now it's
about playing well when it
counts. These are the
biggest events of the year
and we are prepared to play
our best. Now it comes down
to performing when it counts
and we are up to that chal
lenge."
In addition, Rodgers may
have to rearrange his current
trophy case or purchase a
new one, as he was again
named to the eight-man
Palmer Cup team, which
competes at an international
collegiate golf event between
the US and Europe, and as a
semifinalist for the Ben
Hogan Award (collegiate
golf's MVP).
Junior Cameron Wilson,
Stanford's third top-50 play
er, had his 2012 Pac-12 Tour
nament end prematurely due
to disqualification from sign
ing an incorrect scorecard.
One of the Cardinal's most
consistent players during the
spring season, Wilson seems
to have put the past behind
him and is focusing on the
specific aspects of the course
he can exploit in order to
score well.
"LA North has some wide
fairways, but on most holes

there are still advantages to
being accurate off the tee,"
Wilson remarked. "Usually
one side of the fairway offers
a better angle or lie than does
the other. I've been driving it
well and should be able to
take advantage of this."
