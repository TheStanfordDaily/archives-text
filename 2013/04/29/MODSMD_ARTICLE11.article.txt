# READY FOR PAC-12
## CARD LOOKS TO DEPTH IN TOURNEY 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Senior Andrew Yun will seek to repeat as indi
vidual conference champion as he leads the No. 9
Stanford men's golf team into the first round of
the Pac-12 Championships today at the Los Ange
les Country Club. The Cardinal is vying for its
first Pac-12 title since 1994.
"We're excited about the course [LA North],"
head coach Conrad Ray, a freshman on the 1994
team, said. "It was actually designed by the same
architect who designed the Stanford golf course,
George Thomas. So there's some similarities in
the layout and the framework of the course, and
we're looking forward to getting down there and
playing well."
But No. 8 Stanford will likely have to rely on its
depth and endurance and not its course familiari
ty if it is to improve on its sixth place finish of a
year ago. The Pac-12 Tournament is unique in that
it will record five scores each day instead of the
regular four, and the event will be 72 holes instead
of 54.
"It's a six-man, count-five tournament and
we've appreciated our depth this year and tried to
build upon that," Ray said. "With an extra person
in the lineup and an extra score to count, we're
hoping the depth on our team will pay off for us
well as we get into the event."
Yun is aiming to become the fourth Stanford
golfer with multiple Pac-12 titles, a group that in
cludes Pete Choate ('62, '64), Mike Peck ('77, '7B)
and Christian Cevaer ('B9, '92). Despite being the
defending champion, he doesn't think history will
help him one iota.
"It doesn't matter whether I'm the defending
champion or not," Yun stated. "It doesn't give me
any advantage once I step on that first tee. What
it does give me is confidence that I've been in the
situation before and succeeded, so if I'm in a simi
lar situation this year I'll know what to do."
Although Yun enters as Stanford's highest re
turning finisher, sophomore Patrick Rodgers fig
ures to be Stanford's top man as he has been for
most of the season. Rodgers will surely be looking
to improve upon his eighth-place finish in the con
ference tournament last year, garnering Pac-12
Freshman of the Year honors in the process.
Rodgers knows the course will be challenging and
that "par is an extremely good score," but believes
the team is ready to challenge for the win in an ul
tra-competitive league.
