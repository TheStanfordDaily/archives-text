## Ducks sweep Card on the road 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
With its offense finally clicking
and the team back to its winning
ways, No. 22 Stanford headed up
north to Eugene, Ore., for its
toughest series of the season at
No. 7 Oregon. An error Friday, a
rough starting pitching perform
ance Saturday and a blown save on
Sunday gave the Ducks a series
sweep, including two walk-off
wins, and sent the Cardinal crash
ing back down to earth.

Friday night's loss was eerily
reminiscent of Stanford's early-sea
son struggles. Senior starting
pitcher Mark Appel (7-3) had an
other strong performance, allowing
only two runs one earned
over 8.1 innings of work to take the
complete-game loss.
In the end, a lack of hitting and

one defensive mistake did the Car
dinal in. An RBI double from junior
second baseman Danny Diekroeger
gave Appel the lead in the top of the
third inning, but the senior erased
the advantage in the bottom of the
third thanks to a rare mistake.
With two outs and a runner on
first, Appel threw a wild pitch, al
lowing Oregon second baseman
Aaron Payne to advance into scor
ing position. During the same at
bat, Appel allowed a single that
scored Payne from second to tie
the ballgame. Appel retired the

next batter to end the inning, mak
ing the wild pitch even more devas
tating.
As it turned out, that was the
last sniff Appel and Stanford would
have of the lead. The Cardinal
mustered only two outs over its
next six innings at the plate, forcing
Appel to be perfect, which he was
through eight.
But in the bottom of the ninth, a
throwing error from freshman
shortstop Drew Jackson allowed

Oregon pinch-hitter Steven
Packard to reach base and
advance to second base with
nobody out. A bunt single and
an intentional walk loaded the
bases still with no outs.
Appel fought back, strik
ing out Oregon left fielder
Brett Thomas to set up a po
tential game-saving double
play situation. But on an 0-2
pitch, Payne singled to center
to win the game for Oregon in
walk-off fashion.
Saturday's game was ugly
from the very start for Stan
ford. Senior starting pitcher
Dean McArdle (2-2) gave up
five runs all earned in
just three-plus innings to
take the loss.
McArdle allowed two runs
in the first and one in the sec
ond, but seemed to settle
down with a shutout third.
However, the wheels came off
in the fourth as the senior al
lowed a leadoff triple, a wild
pitch that scored the runner

and a walk before being re
lieved by freshman pitcher
Logan James.
James gave up a two-run
homer in that fourth inning to
clinch the Cardinal's fate, but
gathered himself well after
wards. With the Stanford
bullpen desperately thin,
James finished the game
without allowing another run,
both keeping the Cardinal's
chances alive on Saturday
and saving some key arms for
Sunday.
Stanford slowly clawed
back, cutting the lead to two
in the seventh inning on an
Oregon error. But the Cardi
nal's best comeback chance
ended when junior pinch-hit
ter Brant Whiting struck out
with runners on second and
third and two outs to end the
eighth inning.
Stanford seemed to put
the disappointment of Friday
and Saturday in the past for
Sunday's final game of the se
ries. Freshman pitcher
Daniel Starwalt made his
first ever start and was very
successful, allowing only two
runs one earned over
5.1 innings pitched.

Trailing 2-0 and facing a
disappointing sweep in the
face, junior first baseman
Brian Ragira came up big
with a two-RBI single in the
sixth inning to tie the game.
Two innings later, senior des
ignated hitter Justin Ringo
homered with two outs and
nobody on base to give the
Cardinal a 3-2 lead and put
Stanford six outs away from a
series salvaging win.
Senior relief pitcher Gar
rett Hughes, who relieved
Starwalt in the sixth, got out
of a jam in the eighth to put
Stanford even closer. But af
ter allowing a one-out walk in
the ninth, Hughes gave way
to fellow junior reliever Sam
Lindquist. Lindquist (1-1)
could not get it done, giving
up another walk and then a
double to tie the game and put
the winning run on third base
with only one out.
Then Oregon, one of the
most prolific bunting teams in
the nation, caught Stanford
by surprise with a suicide
squeeze to walk off with a win
and sweep the series.
Oregon was the first oppo
nent to take a series from the

Cardinal since Utah stunned
Stanford at Sunken Diamond
to win two out of three back in
March. Between that upset
and the trip to Oregon, Stan
ford had won four consecutive
series, all two games to one

against conference oppo
nents.
Stanford next faces Saint
Mary's in a home midweek
matchup before heading on
the road again to face No. 17
Arizona State in another crit

ical conference series. First
pitch against Saint Mary's
Tuesday at Sunken Diamond
is scheduled for 5:30 p.m.

Sunday's final game of the se
ries. Freshman pitcher
Daniel Starwalt made his
first ever start and was very
successful, allowing only two
runs one earned over
5.1 innings pitched.

Trailing 2-0 and facing a
disappointing sweep in the
face, junior first baseman
Brian Ragira came up big
with a two-RBI single in the
sixth inning to tie the game.
Two innings later, senior des
ignated hitter Justin Ringo
homered with two outs and
nobody on base to give the
Cardinal a 3-2 lead and put
Stanford six outs away from a
series salvaging win.
Senior relief pitcher Gar
rett Hughes, who relieved
Starwalt in the sixth, got out
of a jam in the eighth to put
Stanford even closer. But af
ter allowing a one-out walk in
the ninth, Hughes gave way
to fellow junior reliever Sam
Lindquist. Lindquist (1-1)
could not get it done, giving
up another walk and then a
double to tie the game and put
the winning run on third base
with only one out.
Then Oregon, one of the
most prolific bunting teams in
the nation, caught Stanford
by surprise with a suicide
squeeze to walk off with a win
and sweep the series.
Oregon was the first oppo
nent to take a series from the

Cardinal since Utah stunned
Stanford at Sunken Diamond
to win two out of three back in
March. Between that upset
and the trip to Oregon, Stan
ford had won four consecutive
series, all two games to one

against conference oppo
nents.
Stanford next faces Saint
Mary's in a home midweek
matchup before heading on
the road again to face No. 17
Arizona State in another crit

ical conference series. First
pitch against Saint Mary's
Tuesday at Sunken Diamond
is scheduled for 5:30 p.m.

Senior designated hitter Justin Ringo (above) hit a home run on Sunday, but junior
reliever Sam Lindquist blew a save opportunity that allowed Oregon to sweep the Card.
With its offense finally clicking
and the team back to its winning
ways, No. 22 Stanford headed up
north to Eugene, Ore., for its
toughest series of the season at
No. 7 Oregon. An error Friday, a
rough starting pitching perform
ance Saturday and a blown save on
Sunday gave the Ducks a series
sweep, including two walk-off
wins, and sent the Cardinal crash
ing back down to earth.

Friday night's loss was eerily
reminiscent of Stanford's early-sea
son struggles. Senior starting
pitcher Mark Appel (7-3) had an
other strong performance, allowing
only two runs one earned
over 8.1 innings of work to take the
complete-game loss.
In the end, a lack of hitting and

one defensive mistake did the Car
dinal in. An RBI double from junior
second baseman Danny Diekroeger
gave Appel the lead in the top of the
third inning, but the senior erased
the advantage in the bottom of the
third thanks to a rare mistake.
With two outs and a runner on
first, Appel threw a wild pitch, al
lowing Oregon second baseman
Aaron Payne to advance into scor
ing position. During the same at
bat, Appel allowed a single that
scored Payne from second to tie
the ballgame. Appel retired the

next batter to end the inning, mak
ing the wild pitch even more devas
tating.
As it turned out, that was the
last sniff Appel and Stanford would
have of the lead. The Cardinal
mustered only two outs over its
next six innings at the plate, forcing
Appel to be perfect, which he was
through eight.
But in the bottom of the ninth, a
throwing error from freshman
shortstop Drew Jackson allowed

BASEBALL
STANFORD 3
OREGON 4
4/28, Eugene, Ore.
Oregon pinch-hitter Steven
Packard to reach base and
advance to second base with
nobody out. A bunt single and
an intentional walk loaded the
bases still with no outs.
Appel fought back, strik
ing out Oregon left fielder
Brett Thomas to set up a po
tential game-saving double
play situation. But on an 0-2
pitch, Payne singled to center
to win the game for Oregon in
walk-off fashion.
Saturday's game was ugly
from the very start for Stan
ford. Senior starting pitcher
Dean McArdle (2-2) gave up
five runs all earned in
just three-plus innings to
take the loss.
McArdle allowed two runs
in the first and one in the sec
ond, but seemed to settle
down with a shutout third.
However, the wheels came off
in the fourth as the senior al
lowed a leadoff triple, a wild
pitch that scored the runner

and a walk before being re
lieved by freshman pitcher
Logan James.
James gave up a two-run
homer in that fourth inning to
clinch the Cardinal's fate, but
gathered himself well after
wards. With the Stanford
bullpen desperately thin,
James finished the game
without allowing another run,
both keeping the Cardinal's
chances alive on Saturday
and saving some key arms for
Sunday.
Stanford slowly clawed
back, cutting the lead to two
in the seventh inning on an
Oregon error. But the Cardi
nal's best comeback chance
ended when junior pinch-hit
ter Brant Whiting struck out
with runners on second and
third and two outs to end the
eighth inning.
Stanford seemed to put
the disappointment of Friday
and Saturday in the past for
