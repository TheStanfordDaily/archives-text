## Ducks sweep Card on the road 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
With its offense finally clicking
and the team back to its winning
ways, No. 22 Stanford headed up
north to Eugene, Ore., for its
toughest series of the season at
No. 7 Oregon. An error Friday, a
rough starting pitching perform
ance Saturday and a blown save on
Sunday gave the Ducks a series
sweep, including two walk-off
wins, and sent the Cardinal crash
ing back down to earth.

Friday night's loss was eerily
reminiscent of Stanford's early-sea
son struggles. Senior starting
pitcher Mark Appel (7-3) had an
other strong performance, allowing
only two runs one earned
over 8.1 innings of work to take the
complete-game loss.
In the end, a lack of hitting and

one defensive mistake did the Car
dinal in. An RBI double from junior
second baseman Danny Diekroeger
gave Appel the lead in the top of the
third inning, but the senior erased
the advantage in the bottom of the
third thanks to a rare mistake.
With two outs and a runner on
first, Appel threw a wild pitch, al
lowing Oregon second baseman
Aaron Payne to advance into scor
ing position. During the same at
bat, Appel allowed a single that
scored Payne from second to tie
the ballgame. Appel retired the

next batter to end the inning, mak
ing the wild pitch even more devas
tating.
As it turned out, that was the
last sniff Appel and Stanford would
have of the lead. The Cardinal
mustered only two outs over its
next six innings at the plate, forcing
Appel to be perfect, which he was
through eight.
But in the bottom of the ninth, a
throwing error from freshman
shortstop Drew Jackson allowed
