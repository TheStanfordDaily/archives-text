### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's water polo
team has made a habit of using
quick starts to overwhelm oppo
nents early in the game. On Sunday,
the tables were turned as the Car
dinal (27-2) fell five goals behind
No. 2 USC in the opening period of
Sunday's Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation championship game.
That early deficit proved the differ
ence as USC ultimately captured
the MPSF title with a shocking 11-
7 win.

This was the third meeting be
tween the teams this season. USC
handed Stanford its first loss of the
season on Feb. 24 at the UC-Irvine
Invitational, but the Cardinal
evened the score on April 13 in Los
Angeles.
The Women of Troy are the only
team to beat Stanford this season,
but the Cardinal may have the op
portunity for the ultimate revenge
at the National Collegiate Champi
onships, which will be held from

4/28, Berkeley, Calif.
May 10-12 in Boston. By
virtue of winning the MPSF
title, the Women of Troy
earned an automatic bid into
the tournament, but Stanford
is expected to take one of the
two at-large bids when the
field is announced on Monday
at 5 p.m.
On Sunday, USC senior
Monica Vavic opened the
scoring just 27 seconds into
the game and junior Hannah
Buckling doubled the lead at
6:23. The Women of Troy re
ceived a further momentum
boost when USC goalie Flora
Bolonyai blocked Stanford
freshman Maggie Steffens'
five-meter penalty attempt a
minute later, sparking anoth
er run of two goals in less
than a minute. Buckling
would score again in the final
minute of the period to put
Stanford behind 5-0 at the
first break.
Stanford senior Melissa
Seidemann opened the sec
ond period with two goals of

her own to try to bring the
Cardinal back into the game.
USC answered back with two
more goals before Seidemann
completed the hat trick just
before halftime for a 7-3
score going into the break.
USC scored the first three
goals of the second half to ex

tend the lead to 10-3. Steffens
scored twice and junior Kaley
Dodson chipped in a goal in
the third quarter to give the
Cardinal hope going into the
final eight minutes, but after
freshman Anna Yelizarova
made it 11-7 with 4:35 left in
the game, USC's defense

locked down and closed out
the win.

Bolonyai made nine saves
for the Trojans while senior
Kate Baldoni recorded four
saves for the Cardinal.
Stanford reached the final
by defeating No. 4 UCLA in
the semifinals on Saturday

afternoon in another contest
that ended with an 11-7
scoreline.
In this matchup, Stan
ford's typical formula worked
as junior Annika Dries
staked the Cardinal to a 3-0
lead with a hat trick in the
first 2:39 of the game. Sopho
more Kiley Neushul also
added a goal in the first peri
od, which ended with Stan
ford leading 4-2.
The Cardinal then took
control with a 5-0 streak that
went through the halftime
break. UCLA closed to 9-4,
but Dries and Seidemann
each added another goal to
put the game out of reach.
Dries finished with five goals
while Seidemann recorded
four. Neushul and Steffens
were the other two scorers.
"[Dries and Seidemann]
are really strong in front of
the goal, but the thing that
impressed me [on Saturday]
was how quickly they moved
the ball," said Stanford head
coach John Tanner. "They
played like drivers in terms of
their quickness with the ball
and their perimeter play, and
they were really strong in
front of the goal."

Baldoni made 10 saves for
the game as the Bruins
showed more offensive fire
power than they did in the
last meeting between the
teams, an 8-1 Cardinal win on
April 6.
"They had a couple people
back from the last time we
played them where they did
n't have a presence at two
meters," Tanner said. "We
knew we needed to be aggres
sive on defense and we want
ed to be on attack as well."
Freshman Gabby Stone al
so stepped into goal for the fi
nal minutes of the game and
made three saves, including a
UCLA penalty shot attempt.
With the championship
game loss, Stanford's MPSF
title drought extends to seven
years the Cardinal has not
won the MPSF championship
since 2006. In 2011 and 2012,
however, Stanford bounced
back from conference tourna
ment losses to take the top
prize of a national champi
onship. The Cardinal now has
two weeks to prepare to do
the same in 2013.

Senior Melissa Seidemann (above) finished Sunday's game with four goals, while team-mate
Annika Dries captured five. Despite their efforts, the Women of Troy stole the show.
Stanford women's water polo
team has made a habit of using
quick starts to overwhelm oppo
nents early in the game. On Sunday,
the tables were turned as the Car
dinal (27-2) fell five goals behind
No. 2 USC in the opening period of
Sunday's Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation championship game.
That early deficit proved the differ
ence as USC ultimately captured
the MPSF title with a shocking 11-
7 win.

This was the third meeting be
tween the teams this season. USC
handed Stanford its first loss of the
season on Feb. 24 at the UC-Irvine
Invitational, but the Cardinal
evened the score on April 13 in Los
Angeles.
The Women of Troy are the only
team to beat Stanford this season,
but the Cardinal may have the op
portunity for the ultimate revenge
at the National Collegiate Champi
onships, which will be held from

W. WATER POLO
STANFORD 7
USC 11
4/28, Berkeley, Calif.
May 10-12 in Boston. By
virtue of winning the MPSF
title, the Women of Troy
earned an automatic bid into
the tournament, but Stanford
is expected to take one of the
two at-large bids when the
field is announced on Monday
at 5 p.m.
On Sunday, USC senior
Monica Vavic opened the
scoring just 27 seconds into
the game and junior Hannah
Buckling doubled the lead at
6:23. The Women of Troy re
ceived a further momentum
boost when USC goalie Flora
Bolonyai blocked Stanford
freshman Maggie Steffens'
five-meter penalty attempt a
minute later, sparking anoth
er run of two goals in less
than a minute. Buckling
would score again in the final
minute of the period to put
Stanford behind 5-0 at the
first break.
Stanford senior Melissa
Seidemann opened the sec
ond period with two goals of

her own to try to bring the
Cardinal back into the game.
USC answered back with two
more goals before Seidemann
completed the hat trick just
before halftime for a 7-3
score going into the break.
USC scored the first three
goals of the second half to ex

tend the lead to 10-3. Steffens
scored twice and junior Kaley
Dodson chipped in a goal in
the third quarter to give the
Cardinal hope going into the
final eight minutes, but after
freshman Anna Yelizarova
made it 11-7 with 4:35 left in
the game, USC's defense

locked down and closed out
the win.

Bolonyai made nine saves
for the Trojans while senior
Kate Baldoni recorded four
saves for the Cardinal.
Stanford reached the final
by defeating No. 4 UCLA in
the semifinals on Saturday

afternoon in another contest
that ended with an 11-7
scoreline.
In this matchup, Stan
ford's typical formula worked
as junior Annika Dries
staked the Cardinal to a 3-0
lead with a hat trick in the
first 2:39 of the game. Sopho
more Kiley Neushul also
added a goal in the first peri
od, which ended with Stan
ford leading 4-2.
The Cardinal then took
control with a 5-0 streak that
went through the halftime
break. UCLA closed to 9-4,
but Dries and Seidemann
each added another goal to
put the game out of reach.
Dries finished with five goals
while Seidemann recorded
four. Neushul and Steffens
were the other two scorers.
"[Dries and Seidemann]
are really strong in front of
the goal, but the thing that
impressed me [on Saturday]
was how quickly they moved
the ball," said Stanford head
coach John Tanner. "They
played like drivers in terms of
their quickness with the ball
and their perimeter play, and
they were really strong in
front of the goal."

Baldoni made 10 saves for
the game as the Bruins
showed more offensive fire
power than they did in the
last meeting between the
teams, an 8-1 Cardinal win on
April 6.
"They had a couple people
back from the last time we
played them where they did
n't have a presence at two
meters," Tanner said. "We
knew we needed to be aggres
sive on defense and we want
ed to be on attack as well."
Freshman Gabby Stone al
so stepped into goal for the fi
nal minutes of the game and
made three saves, including a
UCLA penalty shot attempt.
With the championship
game loss, Stanford's MPSF
title drought extends to seven
years the Cardinal has not
won the MPSF championship
since 2006. In 2011 and 2012,
however, Stanford bounced
back from conference tourna
ment losses to take the top
prize of a national champi
onship. The Cardinal now has
two weeks to prepare to do
the same in 2013.
