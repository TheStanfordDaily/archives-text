## Doomed from the start 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's water polo
team has made a habit of using
quick starts to overwhelm oppo
nents early in the game. On Sunday,
the tables were turned as the Car
dinal (27-2) fell five goals behind
No. 2 USC in the opening period of
Sunday's Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation championship game.
That early deficit proved the differ
ence as USC ultimately captured
the MPSF title with a shocking 11-
7 win.

This was the third meeting be
tween the teams this season. USC
handed Stanford its first loss of the
season on Feb. 24 at the UC-Irvine
Invitational, but the Cardinal
evened the score on April 13 in Los
Angeles.
The Women of Troy are the only
team to beat Stanford this season,
but the Cardinal may have the op
portunity for the ultimate revenge
at the National Collegiate Champi
onships, which will be held from
