"We were obviously really
looking forward to playing [Wash

there on the road a couple of
weeks ago," said sophomore
Robert Stineman. "We were very
happy with how the results ended
because it was a match we needed
to win."

Sophomore Robert Stineman (above) teamed up with freshman
Maciek Romanowicz to win the doubles point for an 8-3 victory
over Washington's Jeff Hawke and Max Manthou on Thursday.
defeating Stanford's No. 1
doubles team of senior Denis
Lin and sophomore John
Morrissey 8-5.
The Cardinal rallied to
win the doubles point, with
an 8-3 victory from the No. 2
doubles team of freshman
Maciek Romanowicz and
Stineman over Jeff Hawke
and Max Manthou. Stan
ford's No. 3 doubles team,
juniors Jamin Ball and
Daniel Ho, also defeated
Hudson Barnhart and Em
mett Egger 8-6.
The first singles match to
finish was No. 5, where Ho
pulled out a 6-3, 6-2 victory
over Washington's Viktor
Farkas.
The Huskies took the
next two singles matches to
even out the score. Fresh
man Nolan Paige, Stanford's
No. 2 singles player, lost 6-3,
1-6, 2-6 to Washington's
Bots. Stineman, who played
No. 4 singles, was also de
feated in a close match,
dropping a 7-5, 6-4 decision
to Egger.
"Unfortunately it didn't
go my way this time. [Egger]
is a tough player and it was
really close, but ultimately I
just didn't get the job done,"
Stineman said. "I was happy
with how I competed, but not
as happy with the way I
played."
The Cardinal started to
regain the lead with a victo
ry at No. 6 singles from
freshman Trey Strobel, who

defeated the Huskies'
Nicholas Kamisar 4-6, 6-3, 6-
4. A 7-5, 7-5 win at No. 3 sin
g'les from Romanowicz
clinched the match for Stan
ford.
On Friday afternoon, the
Cardinal faced off against
No. 1 UCLA for the third
time this year, losing 4-0.
Stanford had previously
been defeated by the Bruins
in Los Angeles and at home,
with final scores of 7-0 and 5-
2, respectively.
However, Stineman said
that the team was hopeful
they could pick up an upset
against the Bruins.
"We actually were really
excited, because we played
them really tough when they
came up to Stanford to play,
and we felt like we had a re
ally good shot," Stineman
said. "Unfortunately they
just played really well and
they beat us up pretty
good."
Stineman described the
match as less competitive
than the team's previous
matches against the Bruins
this season, as UCLA picked
up momentum early on and
never gave the Cardinal a
chance to recover.
"They came out with
some fire and really got up
on us early and it was tough
to come back from that,
whereas the first couple of
times we got off to pretty
decent starts," Stineman
said. "We won the doubles
point against them the last
time. If you have a bad start
and they get up with you,
they will continue well and
ultimately finish off the
match."

The first match to finish
was No. 3 doubles, where
Ball and Ho lost 8-1 to
UCLA's Dennis Mkrtchian
and Clay Thompson. The
Bruins' Alex Brigham and
Karue Sell beat Romanowicz
and Stineman 8-3 at No. 2
doubles, taking the doubles
point.
Ho lost 6-1, 6-0 to Sell at
No. 5 singles, which was fol
lowed by a 6-2, 6-4 loss from
Paige to the Bruins' Marcos
Giron at No. 2 singles.
Thompson sealed the match
for UCLA with a 6-2, 6-0 win
over Stineman at No. 4 sin
gles.
UCLA went on to win the
tournament, defeating No. 5
USC 4-2 on Sunday. The
Bruins now have a 24-1 sea
son record.
Both UCLA and USC au
tomatically qualified for the
NCAA Men's Tennis Cham
pionships, which will be held
in Urbana, 111. in mid to late
May. The Cardinal may still
have a chance to qualify for
the tournament based on
postseason selections that
will be announced on Tues
day.
Stineman said that while
the team is still "patiently
waiting" to hear whether or
not they were selected for
the NCAAs, they are opti
mistic about their chances of
playing in the tournament.
"I think we're pretty con
fident that we are going to
make the tournament,"
Stineman said. "We are ex
cited to see the draw and
what lies ahead for us."
