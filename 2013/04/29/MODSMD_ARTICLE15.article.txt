## OP-ED Stanford Dreams 
### KEVIN HSU '09, M.S. '11 
Earlier in April, myriad Fhcebook
statuses broadcast Harvard's
fall from grace, gleefully echo
ing the HufSngton Post's report that
"In Dream College Rankings, Har
vard University is Unseated." Stan
ford now tops the list of "dream
schools."
This weekend, Stanford was flood
ed with ProFVos (prospective fresh
men) here to get a glimpse of the Farm
Many of them will choose this to be
their new home. More than a handful
might have considered this a dream
school, too.
If we are indeed a "dream school,"
then I hope this "dream" is to con
tribute something to the world, not just
to make money and get rich. It would
n't burnish Stanford's reputation if
prospective students simply sought en
tree into wealth (through a distorted
vision of the tech industry and what Sil
icon Valley does, for instance).
This news comes, for instance, just
as CS becomes the most popular major
at Stanford. While it's great that we
are growing a corps of engineers for
this country I'm a little scared that,
much as the East Coast universities of
old served as finishing schools for
those entering the corridors of high so
ciety, Stanford could degenerate into a
playground for the aspiring tech elite.
(Thankfully, engineering isn't quite
that easy folks. You gotta work, and
you gotta do problem sets to survive.)
At Stanford, we are open to new
ideas and new ways of thinking. We
strive for difference, we explore the
novel, we embrace the unconventional.
Innovation is in our blood, and we cele
brate it.
But remember, it's not a catch
phrase, and it's not a gimmick. It's in
novation in service to our ideals. In the
end, we want to be the place that cares
for society and seeks to make a differ
ence— an ethical university, not the
school of tycoons.
To be sure, plenty of aspiring stu
dents do not think of our institution in
such a mercenary way; they have thou
sands of reasons to regard Stanford as
a "dream" school. Yrt even the phrase
"dream school" sounds tawdry bring
ing to mind prom queens and tiaras
and pink frosting. These aren't dreams
but conversation pieces for those who
can afford it —passed ostentatiously
around the dinner table accompa
nied by hearty backslapping and the
expectation they ought to be fulfilled.
The rest dream silently, with internal
ized hopes whispered into the sky
Even though we want ProFl'os to
choose "us" over "them," let's not re
sort to mudslinging or throwing
around meaningless statistics. Cele-

brating the dethroning of Harvard in a
scramble to the top of a questionable
heap reflects the kind of zero-sum
thinking that motivates at least a sub
set of those aspirants and pretenders
a motivation that is profoundly dis
tasteful. It's about image rather than
substance, sex appeal rather than
heart.
That's why this ranking doesn't feel
like a victory. Unfortunately, these
Princeton Review rankings perpetuate
glib answers rather than considered
statements of vision. They cede princi
ple to the masses instead of stamping
down and answering: This is what we
stand for. I think that's what gets me:
It's a popularity contest, but is that
how we want to be defined? If we know
who we are, we shouldn't care what
these kids or their parents think. It's
not an honor to be recognized for a
flimsy, throwaway statement like
"dream school."
It's thus misguided for students
and alumni to crow about "beating"
Harvard. A constellation of many
great institutions is far better for socie
ty— and for democracy—than one
centralizing font of greatness sur
rounded by mediocre neighbors. My
friend and fellow Stanford alum Jen
nifer Rabedeau pointedly observes
that competition from worthy peer in
stitutions can keep us on our toes.
So please, dreamers, understand
what it means to join the Stanford com
munity. It's not a golden ticket to com
fort or riches, though maybe that hap
pens now and again. It's the opportuni
ty to be trained in skills humanistic and
practical, to exercise new ways of
thinking and to find compatriots to join
you, hand in hand, in a lifelong mission.
Or rather, a whole array of missions
some of which seek changes that won't
even be realized in this lifetime, but are
worthwhile nonetheless.
To become part of this place is to
live and breathe and believe in an idea.
If that is your dream, welcome to Stan
ford.

contest, but is
that how we want
to be defined?

and alumni to crow about "beating"
Harvard. A constellation of many
great institutions is far better for socie
ty— and for democracy—than one
centralizing font of greatness sur
rounded by mediocre neighbors. My
friend and fellow Stanford alum Jen
nifer Rabedeau pointedly observes
that competition from worthy peer in
stitutions can keep us on our toes.
So please, dreamers, understand
what it means to join the Stanford com
munity. It's not a golden ticket to com
fort or riches, though maybe that hap
pens now and again. It's the opportuni
ty to be trained in skills humanistic and
practical, to exercise new ways of
thinking and to find compatriots to join
you, hand in hand, in a lifelong mission.
Or rather, a whole array of missions
some of which seek changes that won't
even be realized in this lifetime, but are
worthwhile nonetheless.
To become part of this place is to
live and breathe and believe in an idea.
If that is your dream, welcome to Stan
ford.

Its a popularity
contest, but is
that how we want
to be defined?
