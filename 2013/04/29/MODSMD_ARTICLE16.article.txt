# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## Men and Drugsandalcohol 
### Chris Herries 
Drugsandalcohol. Three words
that, like mathandscience, are
said in such quick succession
that they should be one.
I remember that in elementary
school we used to have programs
dedicated to teaching us the evils of
drugsandalcohol. For a good number
of people, drugsandalcohol are truly
evil, leading to addictions and bro
ken lives. I'm not understating that.
However, for most of us drugsandal
cohol are a facet of near-everyday
life and away to socialize. Used re
sponsibly, they can be positive
things. So that brings me to the
theme of this column: men use drugs
and alcohol responsibly. I think using
drugs and alcohol responsibly in
volves two things: reasonable
amounts and reasonable times.
My first point is that a man uses
drugs and alcohol safely, i.e. in rea
sonable amounts. You might think
we already know this, but surpris
ingly few people actually practice it.
I've seen plenty of parties turn from
a fun evening into an ordeal in a mat
ter of minutes because of over-drink
ing, or binging or crossfading. Any
transport to the hospital was avoid
able at some point, if the person had
recognized his or her limits or a
friend had stepped in to help. I've
been caught up in it as much as any
boy, trying to be macho by kicking
back more shots than the guy next to

me. Fortunately, I haven't gotten in
to any trouble, but that type of be
havior can cause things to go south
quickly.
Someone once remarked to me
that people are always going to have
to push limits to find their bound
aries, so unsafe drinking is unavoid
able. I couldn't disagree more. No
body heads out on a Friday night and
says, "Fuck it, I'm gonna drink 'til I
vomit. It might be dangerous but at
least I'll find my boundaries." Even
people that have found then' alleged
boundaries can still cross them con
sistently. Now, everyone has a differ
ent body but we're generally the
same. Therefore, we can educate
ourselves about drinking guidelines,
follow basic safety tricks like meas
uring drinks and go out with friends
who are educated or caring enough
to help us watch our limits.
I cite alcohol because I think it's
the most common example of drug
abuse in which people think they
know what they're doing when they
really don't. Given the number of re
sources we have to educate our
selves about safe drinking, coupled
with the availability of sober events
on weekend nights, double-digit
transports per quarter is way too
high. A man knows his limits, not be
cause he's exceeded them before,
but because he and his friends are
educated about alcohol consumption.

My second point about responsi
bility has to do with taking certain
substances at reasonable times.
Drugs shouldn't dictate a man's so
cial experience; they should comple
ment it. Essentially, baking shouldn't
be on a social agenda. Marijuana is a
great drug to enhance certain social
experiences and hang out with
friends. However, there's a reason
able limit. If you and your friends
can't get together without marijua
na, then you have a problem. Men
should be able to have a good time
together in the absence of drugs.
Similarly, your free time should
n't be dedicated to getting high. Bak
ing is not a hobby. Your free time
here at Stanford is best used learn
ing a new skill, joining a student
group or getting ahead in classes.
Take your mates to go play soccer, or
fountain hop or exercise. My pur
pose is not to chastise marijuana use;
I have plenty of friends who smoke
pot, and it affects their lives positive
ly. However, there are plenty of boys
for whom marijuana is a negative in
fluence when it begins to dominate
their social life and free time. A man
doesn't let drugs or alcohol dominate
any aspect of his life, even in small,
easily overlooked ways.
