# ASSU weighs funding Legal Counseling Office
## Special fees rejection creates uncertainty about service's future 
### SARAH MOORE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After becoming the only special fees group to
be denied their funding request in this year's AS
SU elections, the Legal Counseling Office (LCO)
a service offered by the ASSU to both under
graduate and graduate students faces uncer
tainty about its future.
Over 50 percent of the students who voted on
the LCO's petition approved the funding request.
However, the total number of students voting to
approve the request did not meet the minimum
threshold of 15 percent of the aggregate student

body.
According to LCO Office Manager Heather
Kirton, the Office offers free legal advice to stu
dents. It is open for four hours twice a week, pro
viding advice to an average of five-and-a-half stu
dents per day. On average, 126 students use the
service each quarter, seeking advice on a wide
range of issues from possession of alcohol by a mi
nor to landlord disputes.
The LCO requested $133,715 in special fees
during this year's ASSU elections, a sum that
would have covered the entirety of Office's opera-
tion, including the rental of
office space, payment for
consulting attorneys and
marketing. The last category
includes advertisements in
the Stanford Unofficial
Guide, dorm flyering, an AS
SU website page and a Face
book page.
"We probably should have
made a better effort [to cam
paign for special fees], but
when you're approved more
than 20 years in a row and
you get people that come in
and thank you for the help
and appreciate the service,
you just assume that at least
enough people will vote," Kir
ton said.
According to Senator Vi
raj Bindra 'l5, there are no
current plans to find alter
nate sources of funding for
the LCO through the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate.
"I definitely see [the
LCO] as an incredibly valu
able resource, and I think we
should find some way to keep
it or the ASSU should pro
vide it with funding," Bindra
said. "That being said, I also
do believe in the integrity of
the process. If students de
cide that they don't necessar
ily want to fund it because

they don't see value in it, we
don't have a right to circum
vent that process. I'm really
torn on the issue."
Outgoing ASSU Presi
dent Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
M.A.13 said that he wants to
collaborate with the Senate
on other possible ways of
funding the LCO, including
reserve fees or buffer funds.
Reserve fees are general un
spent ASSU funds, and
buffer funds comprise what
remains of a 10 percent and
an eight percent surcharge
levied on undergraduates'
and graduates' special fees,
respectively.
"This is a great case study
to think about what the buffer
fund and reserve fees are
for," Zimbroff emphasized,
citing last year's controversy
surrounding the use of buffer
fund monies to support Frost
Revival and Blackfest with
out any clear or uniform rules
to govern that spending.
In an email sent to the
Graduate Student Council on
Sunday, Zimbroff outlined
the current funding status of
the LCO. Zimbroff wrote that
he and ASSU Vice President
William Wagstaff 'l2 M.A.T3
will allocate the ASSU Exec
utive's remaining discre
tionary funds to the LCO's
budget. Even after that fund
ing injection and the LCO's
reserves, a $90,000 shortfall
exists from the Office's spe
cial fees request.
Zimbroff argued that be
cause the LCO's history of
successful special fees re
quests has resulted in the
gradual accrual of sur
charges to the buffer fund,
the use of some of that fund
ing to sustain the LCO in the
year to come would be justi
fied. He emphasized, howev
er, the importance of consid
ering ways to reduce the
LCO's expenses if other
funding doesn't materialize.
"My general thought is
that the LCO is an important
enough service to the student
body that we should really
strongly consider helping it
out, but the question is how,"
Zimbroff said. "However,
what kind of precedent does
it set if you bail out this group
and not some group in the fu
ture that might not get joint
special fees?"
