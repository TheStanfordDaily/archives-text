## Scholars model, address political polarization 
### LAN ANH LE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the partisan divides in American soci
ety continue to deepen, a team of Stanford
researchers has developed an algorithm
demonstrating the process behind that po
larization and created Internet-based so
cial systems to counter the trend.
The team, composed of Associate Pro
fessor of Management Science and Engi
neering Ashish Goel M.S. '9B Ph.D. '99 and
doctoral candidates Pranav Dandekar and
David Lee, examined how people form
opinions and how their viewpoints evolve
over time due to outside influences such as

social networks.
"When two people look at a blog and as a
result their beliefs become more extreme in
opposite directions, the blog has a polariz
ing effect," Dandekar explained. "We want
ed to come up with a model to explain this
effect."
Before developing their own model, the
researchers looked at existing models that
attempt to describe the formation of public
opinion based on homophily, the sociological
theory which assumes that "like seeks like."
However, homophily models predict in
creasing uniformity of opinion over time, as
people seek to minimize disagreement with
in their networks of friends and relations

and as holders of similar opinions tend to
aggregate. Those attributes made the mod
el unsuitable to explaining America's polar
ization.
"It turns out that you can't have polar
ization with this kind of model," Dandekar
said. "When an individual's opinion con
verges to an average of those in his or her
network, depolarization happens. Instead,
polarization is when opinions diverge."
The team sought to create an alterna
tive model to explain polarization based on
biased assimilation, a different psychologi
cal concept.
