## Scholars model, address political polarization 
### LAN ANH LE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the partisan divides in American soci
ety continue to deepen, a team of Stanford
researchers has developed an algorithm
demonstrating the process behind that po
larization and created Internet-based so
cial systems to counter the trend.
The team, composed of Associate Pro
fessor of Management Science and Engi
neering Ashish Goel M.S. '9B Ph.D. '99 and
doctoral candidates Pranav Dandekar and
David Lee, examined how people form
opinions and how their viewpoints evolve
over time due to outside influences such as

social networks.
"When two people look at a blog and as a
result their beliefs become more extreme in
opposite directions, the blog has a polariz
ing effect," Dandekar explained. "We want
ed to come up with a model to explain this
effect."
Before developing their own model, the
researchers looked at existing models that
attempt to describe the formation of public
opinion based on homophily, the sociological
theory which assumes that "like seeks like."
However, homophily models predict in
creasing uniformity of opinion over time, as
people seek to minimize disagreement with
in their networks of friends and relations

and as holders of similar opinions tend to
aggregate. Those attributes made the mod
el unsuitable to explaining America's polar
ization.
"It turns out that you can't have polar
ization with this kind of model," Dandekar
said. "When an individual's opinion con
verges to an average of those in his or her
network, depolarization happens. Instead,
polarization is when opinions diverge."
The team sought to create an alterna
tive model to explain polarization based on
biased assimilation, a different psychologi
cal concept.
"We wanted to capture this phe
nomenon that leads to polarization
in the way that we define it," Dan
dekar said. "The model would final
ly provide an adequate answer to
the question of whether or not peo
ple have some biases that they nat
urally gravitate to."
According to the theory of bi
ased assimilation, people favor evi
dence that confirms their beliefs
and reject information that goes
against their preconceptions, which
explains why two people can come
to completely different conclusions
given identical evidence.
"In seeing mixed evidence,
meaning both the pros and cons, of

issues like gun control or nuclear
proliferation, people usually take in
information that affirms their ex
isting viewpoint and reject whatev
er that goes against it," Lee said.
"At the end, people have more ex
treme opinions."
The researchers used their
knowledge about polarization to
create Internet-based social sys
tems that allow people to identify
similarities instead of differ
ences between their political
views and collaborate on solutions
to issues such as the budget crisis.
"The important question is
when people have to come up with a
budget, it's difficult for them to do
it because of polarized views and
disagreements," Lee said. "We are
finding away to promote consensus
in such situations."
One system developed by the
team is a federal budget simulation

called Widescope, which allows
users to propose their own budgets
with detailed annotations explain
ing their viewpoints. Through
Widescope, users can collaborate
on budgets and eventually vote on

the proposals.
"It's like a process of elimina
tion. Eventually the best budget
proposals will make it to the end
through a series of voting proce
dures," Dandekar said. "The goal is
to come to a consensus and collabo
rate to find solutions in a democrat
ic manner."
Lee and Dandekar said that
Widescope was inspired by direct
democracy systems, in which the
entire electorate takes part in mak
ing laws and other political deci
sions. Through Widescope, Ameri
cans can simulate playing a larger
role in the legislative process in
cluding learning how to come to a
consensus on divisive issues
than they might otherwise do.
"In the last few years, there has
been an explosion of social net
works," Dandekar said. "The ques
tion here is can we harmonize

this engagement in social network
ing to drive public policy? Can peo
ple come together on these Inter
net-based social platforms to dis
cuss an issue and come to agree
ment?"

Both Dandekar and Lee agreed
that a website like Widescope has
the potential to generate relatively
accurate representations of the
public opinion on a wide range of
political issues, from health care re
form to federal budgets.

"We are interested in whether
or not we can use the Internet to
promote consensus and power
democracy," Lee said. "Aggregate
solutions from the crowd can be a
very effective one. So can we use
the wisdom of the majority to make
decisions?"

views and collaborate on solutions
to issues such as the budget crisis.
"The important question is
when people have to come up with a
budget, it's difficult for them to do
it because of polarized views and
disagreements," Lee said. "We are
finding away to promote consensus
in such situations."
One system developed by the
team is a federal budget simulation

called Widescope, which allows
users to propose their own budgets
with detailed annotations explain
ing their viewpoints. Through
Widescope, users can collaborate
on budgets and eventually vote on

the proposals.
"It's like a process of elimina
tion. Eventually the best budget
proposals will make it to the end
through a series of voting proce
dures," Dandekar said. "The goal is
to come to a consensus and collabo
rate to find solutions in a democrat
ic manner."
Lee and Dandekar said that
Widescope was inspired by direct
democracy systems, in which the
entire electorate takes part in mak
ing laws and other political deci
sions. Through Widescope, Ameri
cans can simulate playing a larger
role in the legislative process in
cluding learning how to come to a
consensus on divisive issues
than they might otherwise do.
"In the last few years, there has
been an explosion of social net
works," Dandekar said. "The ques
tion here is can we harmonize

this engagement in social network
ing to drive public policy? Can peo
ple come together on these Inter
net-based social platforms to dis
cuss an issue and come to agree
ment?"

Both Dandekar and Lee agreed
that a website like Widescope has
the potential to generate relatively
accurate representations of the
public opinion on a wide range of
political issues, from health care re
form to federal budgets.

"We are interested in whether
or not we can use the Internet to
promote consensus and power
democracy," Lee said. "Aggregate
solutions from the crowd can be a
very effective one. So can we use
the wisdom of the majority to make
decisions?"
