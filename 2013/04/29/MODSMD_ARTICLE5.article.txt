The MobiSocial Computing
Lab, an industrial affiliate program
in the School of Engineering, re
cently began accepting entries for
its first-ever design competition for
middle and high school students in
terested in developing mobile
phone applications.
The lab will award two $l,OOO
scholarships, sponsored by Google,
to the individual or team winners of
the competition. Participants will
be judged on a video advertisement
for their mobile creation, which
must be uploaded to both You Tube
and the event's Facebook page by
May 20. The winners will be an
nounced on June 3.
Monica Lam, professor of com
puter science and the Lab's faculty
director, said that she expects most
entries will be mobile apps, but she
emphasized that the contest is open
to any kind of mobile experience.
"There are other things that you
can do with your phones, and it's
just a matter of how you use a mo
bile device," Lam said, referencing
the virtual corkboard at Arrillaga
Family Dining Commons. "You can
use your phone to interact with the
corkboard that is an experience
that is not just the app on your
phone. It can be an app that inter
acts with other objects around
you."
Lam said that she and an indus
try professional will judge entries
for one of the two scholarships.
While Lam said that she is looking
for designs that are "feasible with
in physical limits," she emphasized
prioritizing creativity and innova
tion over programming expertise.
"Programming is a means, not
an end. You learn English grammar
so that you can write creative
things and express your thoughts.
It's the thoughts that are important
