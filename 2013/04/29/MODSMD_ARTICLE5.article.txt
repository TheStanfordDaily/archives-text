## Lab starts app contest for youth Contest hopes to lure middle-and high-schoolers to CS 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The MobiSocial Computing
Lab, an industrial affiliate program
in the School of Engineering, re
cently began accepting entries for
its first-ever design competition for
middle and high school students in
terested in developing mobile
phone applications.
The lab will award two $l,OOO
scholarships, sponsored by Google,
to the individual or team winners of
the competition. Participants will
be judged on a video advertisement
for their mobile creation, which
must be uploaded to both You Tube
and the event's Facebook page by
May 20. The winners will be an
nounced on June 3.
Monica Lam, professor of com
puter science and the Lab's faculty
director, said that she expects most
entries will be mobile apps, but she
emphasized that the contest is open
to any kind of mobile experience.
"There are other things that you
can do with your phones, and it's
just a matter of how you use a mo
bile device," Lam said, referencing
the virtual corkboard at Arrillaga
Family Dining Commons. "You can
use your phone to interact with the
corkboard that is an experience
that is not just the app on your
phone. It can be an app that inter
acts with other objects around
you."
Lam said that she and an indus
try professional will judge entries
for one of the two scholarships.
While Lam said that she is looking
for designs that are "feasible with
in physical limits," she emphasized
prioritizing creativity and innova
tion over programming expertise.
"Programming is a means, not
an end. You learn English grammar
so that you can write creative
things and express your thoughts.
It's the thoughts that are important
and not the grammar itself,"
Lam said. "But when people
think about [computer sci
ence], all they are learning is
the grammar program
ming. It takes all the fun out
of it."
The second scholarship
will be given to the partici
pant or team whose entry re
ceives the most likes through
Google Wildfire, a social me
dia marketing platform.
"High school students
come up with different ideas,
and I want them to be evalu
ated by other high school stu
dents because I want to hear
what they think is really
good," Lam said. "We want
them to come with ideas and
evaluate themselves."
Joy Kim, a doctoral stu
dent in computer science who

has been involved in planning
and running the contest, said
that the entries will be
judged on design instead of
coding to attract students
who might find programming
intimidating.
"We kind of want to tem
porarily move [program
ming] aside for now and get
them started with step one,"
Kim said. "Just give them an
idea, and emphasize you
don't sit down and start pro
gramming and stuff happens.
You think about an idea, you
go out and talk to people, you
collaborate with others be
fore you even start doing
anything."
Lam concurred that the
contest was specifically de
signed to introduce computer
science to students who may
not want to start with com
puter or mobile program
ming.
"We might catch another
group of people we think
especially girls will be inter
ested in this," Lam said.
"There are just not enough
girls going into computer sci
ence, and they would proba
bly welcome that."
Although only two teams
will win scholarships, Lam
expressed hope that all com
petitors will keep in contact
with the MobiSocial Comput
ing Lab, portraying the con
test as an important step in
the lab's outreach to middle
and high school students.
Last year, the lab hosted a

six-week summer camp to in
troduce high school and col
lege students to computer
science through creating mo
bile devices. While students
had expected programming
to be "solitary and tedious,"
according to Lam, many ex
perienced computer science
in a collaborative and interac
tive way.
One of the students at the
camp, Sarah Nader 'l5, came
up with the idea of a design
competition as away to show
other students the potential
for creativity within comput
er science.
"Computer science people
love computer science be
cause it is a very useful tool
for creating everything,"
Lam said. "So that's the mes
sage we want to get out. For
the video competition, all you
have to do is have some imag
ination, and that's where it
should start."
Though Lam said that
she expects "very few en
tries" in the contest this
year, she predicted that stu
dent awareness and interest
will grow over time.
"This is just the begin
ning, and hopefully we will
keep growing this," Lam
said. "Once you have the
competition, people will
learn of people winning and
be looking out for the second
round."
