# PRIME PICKS
## THREE SELECTED IN NFL DRAFT 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford football had three former
players drafted in the 2013 NFL Draft
this weekend in New York City, all be
tween the second and fifth rounds.
Senior tight end Zach Ertz was the
first Cardinal prospect selected when the
Philadelphia Eagles took him with the
third pick of the second round.
It is an ironic twist of fate for Ertz.
The 6-foot-8 tight end will now play for
former Oregon football head coach Chip
Kelly, whom Ertz helped Stanford defeat
with a dominant 11-reception, 106-yard
performance that included the game-ty
ing touchdown grab with under two min
utes remaining.
"I couldn't be happier to be going to
play for Coach Kelly and the Eagles,"
Ertz said. "My mom and dad were both
born in Pennsylvania, so it feels like this
very cool circle of life."
The next Stanford player to come off
the board was, somewhat surprisingly,
Ertz's fellow senior tight end Levine
Toilolo, who went to the Atlanta Falcons
with the last pick of the fourth round.
Toilolo surprised many with his deci
sion to declare for the draft after a disap
pointing 2012 season. Toilolo grabbed 24
catches for 393 yards and four touch
downs, solid numbers yet below expecta
tions after an almost equally productive
season in his first full year of action in
2011.
Toilolo redshirted the 2009 season and
missed most of 2010 with an injury in the
season's first game against Sacramento
State, so he would have had at least one
additional year of eligibility at Stanford.
"I'm beyond excited right now. I'm
looking forward to being a part of the Fal
cons organization," Toilolo said. "I'll be
able to learn from Tony Gonzalez, a fu
ture Hall of Famer and one of the best to
ever play the position in the game."
The final Stanford player to hear his
name called in the draft was senior run
ning back Stepfan Taylor, who the Ari
zona Cardinals selected with the seventh
pick of the fifth round.

Zach Ertz
2nd round, Philadelphia
Scout's take

In this new Chip Kelly offense, there
is a demand for a lot of varied per
sonnel groupings and multi-tight
end sets. Starter Brent Celek might
be getting close to the end, and the

other tight ends on this roster aren't
big threats in the passing game. The
Eagles will use Ertz as a matchup
guy in motion and even flex him
outside, and he will constantly be on
the move. New offensive coordinator
Pat Shurmur is a huge advocate of
using the tight end position, so we
will likely see Ertz and Celek on the
field together a lot. - ESPN

Levine Toilolo
4th round, Atlanta
Scout's take
Ihe Falcons need a guy in place to

step in for Tony Gonzalez after the
2013 season. The guys they have
on the roster are complementary
players and not very productive in
the passing game for a Matt Ryan
led offense that loves to throw to
the tight end. You would think the
Falcons would look for an athletic,
move guy who can flex and motion,
but Toilolo is more of an inline guy
with great size. He should have
great production in the red zone,
catching the high ball similar to
Gonzalez. But asking him to make
all those athletic catches we've seen
from Gonzalez is probably overly
optimistic. - ESPN

Stepfan Taylor
sth round, Arizona
Scout's take

Taylor has ideal size and runs
with excellent power and bal
ance. He also shows good vision,
and does a nice job setting his
pads and getting upfield when
finding a crease. While he has ad
equate lateral agility, he lacks
juice and doesn't have great ac
celeration out of his cuts. In addi
tion, he is just average in terms of
versatility as a pass-catcher. Tay

lor has the chance to add depth
and develop into a No. 2 back.
The Cardinals' top two veteran
backs, Rashard Mendenhall and
Ryan Williams, have health issues
and durability questions, which
could push Taylor up. - ESPN
