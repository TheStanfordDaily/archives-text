# PRIME PICKS
## THREE SELECTED IN NFL DRAFT 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford football had three former
players drafted in the 2013 NFL Draft
this weekend in New York City, all be
tween the second and fifth rounds.
Senior tight end Zach Ertz was the
first Cardinal prospect selected when the
Philadelphia Eagles took him with the
third pick of the second round.
It is an ironic twist of fate for Ertz.
The 6-foot-8 tight end will now play for
former Oregon football head coach Chip
Kelly, whom Ertz helped Stanford defeat
with a dominant 11-reception, 106-yard
performance that included the game-ty
ing touchdown grab with under two min
utes remaining.
"I couldn't be happier to be going to
play for Coach Kelly and the Eagles,"
Ertz said. "My mom and dad were both
born in Pennsylvania, so it feels like this
very cool circle of life."
The next Stanford player to come off
the board was, somewhat surprisingly,
Ertz's fellow senior tight end Levine
Toilolo, who went to the Atlanta Falcons
with the last pick of the fourth round.
Toilolo surprised many with his deci
sion to declare for the draft after a disap
pointing 2012 season. Toilolo grabbed 24
catches for 393 yards and four touch
downs, solid numbers yet below expecta
tions after an almost equally productive
season in his first full year of action in
2011.
Toilolo redshirted the 2009 season and
missed most of 2010 with an injury in the
season's first game against Sacramento
State, so he would have had at least one
additional year of eligibility at Stanford.
"I'm beyond excited right now. I'm
looking forward to being a part of the Fal
cons organization," Toilolo said. "I'll be
able to learn from Tony Gonzalez, a fu
ture Hall of Famer and one of the best to
ever play the position in the game."
The final Stanford player to hear his
name called in the draft was senior run
ning back Stepfan Taylor, who the Ari
zona Cardinals selected with the seventh
pick of the fifth round.

Zach Ertz
2nd round, Philadelphia
Scout's take

In this new Chip Kelly offense, there
is a demand for a lot of varied per
sonnel groupings and multi-tight
end sets. Starter Brent Celek might
be getting close to the end, and the

other tight ends on this roster aren't
big threats in the passing game. The
Eagles will use Ertz as a matchup
guy in motion and even flex him
outside, and he will constantly be on
the move. New offensive coordinator
Pat Shurmur is a huge advocate of
using the tight end position, so we
will likely see Ertz and Celek on the
field together a lot. - ESPN

Levine Toilolo
4th round, Atlanta
Scout's take
Ihe Falcons need a guy in place to

step in for Tony Gonzalez after the
2013 season. The guys they have
on the roster are complementary
players and not very productive in
the passing game for a Matt Ryan
led offense that loves to throw to
the tight end. You would think the
Falcons would look for an athletic,
move guy who can flex and motion,
but Toilolo is more of an inline guy
with great size. He should have
great production in the red zone,
catching the high ball similar to
Gonzalez. But asking him to make
all those athletic catches we've seen
from Gonzalez is probably overly
optimistic. - ESPN

Stepfan Taylor
sth round, Arizona
Scout's take

Taylor has ideal size and runs
with excellent power and bal
ance. He also shows good vision,
and does a nice job setting his
pads and getting upfield when
finding a crease. While he has ad
equate lateral agility, he lacks
juice and doesn't have great ac
celeration out of his cuts. In addi
tion, he is just average in terms of
versatility as a pass-catcher. Tay

lor has the chance to add depth
and develop into a No. 2 back.
The Cardinals' top two veteran
backs, Rashard Mendenhall and
Ryan Williams, have health issues
and durability questions, which
could push Taylor up. - ESPN




all-time career leader with 4,300 rush
ing yards and 45 total touchdowns. Tay
lor had the most productive season of
his career in 2012, rushing for 1,530
yards and 13 touchdowns.
"It's a blessing to be a part of the Ari
zona Cardinals' (organization)," Taylor
said. "This is the perfect situation for
me. I want to thank the Stanford family
for the last four years, all of their sup
port and best wishes."
The surprise of the draft for Stanford
was fifth-year senior outside linebacker
Chase Thomas not being selected.
Thomas was projected by most to go
in the third or fourth round, falling be
low even higher original projections due
to his 4.91 40-yard dash time at Febru
ary's NFL Scouting Combine.
Production was certainly not an issue
for Thomas. The outside linebacker fin
ished second on the Cardinal with 71
tackles and tied for second with 7.5 sacks
in 2012. Thomas finished his career with
50 tackles for a loss.
Thomas signed with the New Orleans
Saints as an undrafted free agent Satur
day after the draft concluded. Packer
Report reported on Twitter that the
Packers were also interested, but
Thomas chose to sign with the Saints.
Senior wide receiver Drew Terrell
announced that he would attend a rookie
minicamp with the Kansas City Chiefs
after going undrafted. Fellow senior
wide receiver Jamal-Rashad Patterson
will head to the Indianapolis Colts after
also going undrafted. Fifth-year senior
outside linebacker Alex Debniak will re
portedly be switching positions to full
back when he reports to the 49ers as an
undrafted free agent as well.
The undrafted free agent route is a

path that has been fruitful for Stanford
players in the past —l2 of the 25 former
Stanford players currently on active
NFL rosters began their careers as un
drafted free agents, including Griff
Whalen 'l2 with the Indianapolis Colts.
Stanford's 2013 NFL Draft class
did not have the same top-end success
as the Class of 2012 did last April. In
the 2012 NFL Draft, the Cardinal had
four players drafted in the first 42 slots,
including No. 1 overall pick Andrew
Luck 'l2 to the Colts and No. 24 overall

selection David DeCastro 'l2 to the
Pittsburgh Steelers. But no Cardinal
player was drafted after Jonathan Mar
tin 'l2 at No. 42 overall to the Miami
Dolphins.

Early indications have fifth-year
senior inside linebacker Shayne Skov
and fifth-year senior outside linebacker
Trent Murphy as the Cardinal's top
prospects for the 2014 NFL Draft.

using the tight end position, so we
will likely see Ertz and Celek on the
field together a lot. - ESPN

Levine Toilolo
4th round, Atlanta
Scout's take
Ihe Falcons need a guy in place to

step in for Tony Gonzalez after the
2013 season. The guys they have
on the roster are complementary
players and not very productive in
the passing game for a Matt Ryan
led offense that loves to throw to
the tight end. You would think the
Falcons would look for an athletic,
move guy who can flex and motion,
but Toilolo is more of an inline guy
with great size. He should have
great production in the red zone,
catching the high ball similar to
Gonzalez. But asking him to make
all those athletic catches we've seen
from Gonzalez is probably overly
optimistic. - ESPN

Stepfan Taylor
sth round, Arizona
Scout's take

Taylor has ideal size and runs
with excellent power and bal
ance. He also shows good vision,
and does a nice job setting his
pads and getting upfield when
finding a crease. While he has ad
equate lateral agility, he lacks
juice and doesn't have great ac
celeration out of his cuts. In addi
tion, he is just average in terms of
versatility as a pass-catcher. Tay

lor has the chance to add depth
and develop into a No. 2 back.
The Cardinals' top two veteran
backs, Rashard Mendenhall and
Ryan Williams, have health issues
and durability questions, which
could push Taylor up. - ESPN




all-time career leader with 4,300 rush
ing yards and 45 total touchdowns. Tay
lor had the most productive season of
his career in 2012, rushing for 1,530
yards and 13 touchdowns.
"It's a blessing to be a part of the Ari
zona Cardinals' (organization)," Taylor
said. "This is the perfect situation for
me. I want to thank the Stanford family
for the last four years, all of their sup
port and best wishes."
The surprise of the draft for Stanford
was fifth-year senior outside linebacker
Chase Thomas not being selected.
Thomas was projected by most to go
in the third or fourth round, falling be
low even higher original projections due
to his 4.91 40-yard dash time at Febru
ary's NFL Scouting Combine.
Production was certainly not an issue
for Thomas. The outside linebacker fin
ished second on the Cardinal with 71
tackles and tied for second with 7.5 sacks
in 2012. Thomas finished his career with
50 tackles for a loss.
Thomas signed with the New Orleans
Saints as an undrafted free agent Satur
day after the draft concluded. Packer
Report reported on Twitter that the
Packers were also interested, but
Thomas chose to sign with the Saints.
Senior wide receiver Drew Terrell
announced that he would attend a rookie
minicamp with the Kansas City Chiefs
after going undrafted. Fellow senior
wide receiver Jamal-Rashad Patterson
will head to the Indianapolis Colts after
also going undrafted. Fifth-year senior
outside linebacker Alex Debniak will re
portedly be switching positions to full
back when he reports to the 49ers as an
undrafted free agent as well.
The undrafted free agent route is a

path that has been fruitful for Stanford
players in the past —l2 of the 25 former
Stanford players currently on active
NFL rosters began their careers as un
drafted free agents, including Griff
Whalen 'l2 with the Indianapolis Colts.
Stanford's 2013 NFL Draft class
did not have the same top-end success
as the Class of 2012 did last April. In
the 2012 NFL Draft, the Cardinal had
four players drafted in the first 42 slots,
including No. 1 overall pick Andrew
Luck 'l2 to the Colts and No. 24 overall

selection David DeCastro 'l2 to the
Pittsburgh Steelers. But no Cardinal
player was drafted after Jonathan Mar
tin 'l2 at No. 42 overall to the Miami
Dolphins.

Early indications have fifth-year
senior inside linebacker Shayne Skov
and fifth-year senior outside linebacker
Trent Murphy as the Cardinal's top
prospects for the 2014 NFL Draft.

Senior tight end Levine Toilolo (left) was selected by the Atlanta Falcons with the
last pick of the fourth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Zach Ertz was picked by
the San Francisco 49ers while Stepfan Taylor went to the Arizona Cardinals.
Stanford football had three former
players drafted in the 2013 NFL Draft
this weekend in New York City, all be
tween the second and fifth rounds.
Senior tight end Zach Ertz was the
first Cardinal prospect selected when the
Philadelphia Eagles took him with the
third pick of the second round.
It is an ironic twist of fate for Ertz.
The 6-foot-8 tight end will now play for
former Oregon football head coach Chip
Kelly, whom Ertz helped Stanford defeat
with a dominant 11-reception, 106-yard
performance that included the game-ty
ing touchdown grab with under two min
utes remaining.
"I couldn't be happier to be going to
play for Coach Kelly and the Eagles,"
Ertz said. "My mom and dad were both
born in Pennsylvania, so it feels like this
very cool circle of life."
The next Stanford player to come off
the board was, somewhat surprisingly,
Ertz's fellow senior tight end Levine
Toilolo, who went to the Atlanta Falcons
with the last pick of the fourth round.
Toilolo surprised many with his deci
sion to declare for the draft after a disap
pointing 2012 season. Toilolo grabbed 24
catches for 393 yards and four touch
downs, solid numbers yet below expecta
tions after an almost equally productive
season in his first full year of action in
2011.
Toilolo redshirted the 2009 season and
missed most of 2010 with an injury in the
season's first game against Sacramento
State, so he would have had at least one
additional year of eligibility at Stanford.
"I'm beyond excited right now. I'm
looking forward to being a part of the Fal
cons organization," Toilolo said. "I'll be
able to learn from Tony Gonzalez, a fu
ture Hall of Famer and one of the best to
ever play the position in the game."
The final Stanford player to hear his
name called in the draft was senior run
ning back Stepfan Taylor, who the Ari
zona Cardinals selected with the seventh
pick of the fifth round.
Taylor leaves the Farm as the Cardinal's

Zach Ertz
2nd round, Philadelphia
Scout's take

In this new Chip Kelly offense, there
is a demand for a lot of varied per
sonnel groupings and multi-tight
end sets. Starter Brent Celek might
be getting close to the end, and the

other tight ends on this roster aren't
big threats in the passing game. The
Eagles will use Ertz as a matchup
guy in motion and even flex him
outside, and he will constantly be on
the move. New offensive coordinator

using the tight end position, so we
will likely see Ertz and Celek on the
field together a lot. - ESPN
