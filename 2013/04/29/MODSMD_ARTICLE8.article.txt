# Q&A
## CRISTI√ÅN SAMPER PRESIDENT AND CEO OF EHE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY 
### MOLLY VORWERCK DESK EDITOR 
Cristian Samper is the president and CEO of
the Wildlife Conservation Society, a role he as
cended to in 2010 after serving as Director of
the Smithsonian Institute's National Museum of
Natural History. The Daily sat down with Sam
per, who is in town to speak in Silicon Valley, to
discuss his start as a botanist, the steps Stan
ford students can take to lead ecologically con
scious lives and (one of) his favorite species
the short-billed hummingbird.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Where did you
grow up? Did your childhood in South Amer
ica influence your passion for tropical envi
ronments?
Cristian Semper (CS): I grew up in Bogota,
Colombia, in the Andes, surrounded by tropical
nature. So that's one of the things that captivat
ed me from the time that I was a small child. I
used to take long hikes and see all these tropical
creatures, and I was always wondering what
they where, and that's what inspired me to be
come a biologist.
Fortunately, I had parents that supported me
and let me go [to] all sorts of crazy places across
the country, as well as a few teachers that gave
me opportunities to go out in the field and the
rainforest. You either love it or you hate it, and I
loved it.
TSD: Within your research on tropical envi
ronments and conservation, do you have a
specific focus for instance, a type of
ecosystem or animal?
CS: My training is actually in botany. I
worked in plants, and I did my Ph.D. work in the
Andean cloud forests, so that's where it started.
With any biologist, you focus on one organism or
one place until you start developing interests in
other areas, and over time you discover the
whole ecosystem.
I started as a botanist and then worked on
birds, and then bird-plant interactions, and from
there I became an ecologist and then over time
a conservation biologist.
TSD: Can you explain what you mean by con
servation biology, and how did you find your
self interested in it?
CS: Well, this is a relatively new field. One of
the things that captivated many of us to study
conservation biology is that you find that many
of the places that we study [and] the plants and
animals that we cherish, that we admire and ex
amine, are increasingly under threat. The num
ber of places that I studied when I was a teenag
er or college student, where there's been an in
creasing pressure on losing some of these
