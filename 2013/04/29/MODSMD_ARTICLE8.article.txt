# Q&A
## CRISTI√ÅN SAMPER PRESIDENT AND CEO OF EHE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY 
### MOLLY VORWERCK DESK EDITOR 
Cristian Samper is the president and CEO of
the Wildlife Conservation Society, a role he as
cended to in 2010 after serving as Director of
the Smithsonian Institute's National Museum of
Natural History. The Daily sat down with Sam
per, who is in town to speak in Silicon Valley, to
discuss his start as a botanist, the steps Stan
ford students can take to lead ecologically con
scious lives and (one of) his favorite species
the short-billed hummingbird.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Where did you
grow up? Did your childhood in South Amer
ica influence your passion for tropical envi
ronments?
Cristian Semper (CS): I grew up in Bogota,
Colombia, in the Andes, surrounded by tropical
nature. So that's one of the things that captivat
ed me from the time that I was a small child. I
used to take long hikes and see all these tropical
creatures, and I was always wondering what
they where, and that's what inspired me to be
come a biologist.
Fortunately, I had parents that supported me
and let me go [to] all sorts of crazy places across
the country, as well as a few teachers that gave
me opportunities to go out in the field and the
rainforest. You either love it or you hate it, and I
loved it.
TSD: Within your research on tropical envi
ronments and conservation, do you have a
specific focus for instance, a type of
ecosystem or animal?
CS: My training is actually in botany. I
worked in plants, and I did my Ph.D. work in the
Andean cloud forests, so that's where it started.
With any biologist, you focus on one organism or
one place until you start developing interests in
other areas, and over time you discover the
whole ecosystem.
I started as a botanist and then worked on
birds, and then bird-plant interactions, and from
there I became an ecologist and then over time
a conservation biologist.
TSD: Can you explain what you mean by con
servation biology, and how did you find your
self interested in it?
CS: Well, this is a relatively new field. One of
the things that captivated many of us to study
conservation biology is that you find that many
of the places that we study [and] the plants and
animals that we cherish, that we admire and ex
amine, are increasingly under threat. The num
ber of places that I studied when I was a teenag
er or college student, where there's been an in
creasing pressure on losing some of these

species as causing ecological change.
forests, I think more and
more of us at some point de
cide to do something about it.
The challenge is that
when you make that transi
tion to conservation biology
you discover that the process
of biology and other disci
plines are interconnected.
For instance, economics and
many other disciplines [are
crucial to] understanding the
social and environmental dy
namics of what's happening
[in an ecosystem]. In some
ways, this is still a field that's
evolving, and we're increas
ingly combining biology with
other fields everything
from economics to engineer
ing to really try to under
stand and preserve some of
the things we care about.
TSD: In your opinion, what
have been the most promi
nent causes of ecological
change? Is it global warm
ing?
CS: It depends on where
you are. Clearly, global
warming is one. Habitat
transformation still is a big
driver in many areas, partic
ularly in the tropics. Every
thing from deforestation to
infrastructural dams and
rivers there are a lot of is
sues about transforming the
natural habits to giving way
to kinds of production.
Global warming is cer
tainly having an impact. I've
seen it first hand in the An
des. Colombia where I
grew up has more than
twenty glaciers in the tropi
cal mountains with high ele
vation. Half of the glaciers
that existed when I was a
teenager have disappeared
at this point. This impacts
the creatures that live there,
and increasingly it impacts
the people affected by the
water. So that's a second big
driver.

In particular places, inva
sive species are ruining fresh
water systems. So it is a com
bination of all these drivers
of change that are happening
increasingly in many parts of
the world. Some of them we
can fix short-term and some
of them will have global im
pacts that we can help with
long-term projects, like cli
mate change.

TSD: What are some of the
problems we can fix in the
short-term?
CS: We're trying to tackle
all of them to some extent.
For habitat transformation, I
think there are a couple of
things we can do. One is iden
tifying areas that are critical
for conservation and trying
to set some of them aside for
conservation. In fact, we've
passed a lot through Con
gress in the last 20 years set
ting aside places for conser
vation.
More and more we're try
ing to look at the various as
pects of cultural production
systems ... try to mitigate
some of the impacts that
they're having. There are dif
ferent ways to produce food.
There's no doubt that food
production is going to be one
of the big, big changes. We
have to produce about 50
percent more food for our
growing population, and for
the climate that's huge. The
question is how we're going
to produce that.
Of course in the area of
climate change there are a
number of steps that need to
be taken. A big one is avoid
ing deforestation, as defor
estation contributes to big
emissions of carbon. About
70 percent of global emis
sions of CO2 come from de
forestation ... There are a
number of steps that need to
be taken, everything from
the choices you make every
day and the work we do in
the field and the decisions
politicians make or don't
make. We need a better mod
el for development.
TSD: How did your posi
tion as Director of the
Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of Natu
ral History prepare you for
your role as President and
CEO of the Wildlife Con
servation Society?
CS: I think the two ele
ments that really prepared
me ...was first of all [that]
these museums are a lot
about the public side and how
you use the museum. For
many, these are windows into
nature and the way you con
nect people in the urban en
vironment with the changes
that are happening out there.
Secondly the fact [is] that
scientists at museums have a
wide variety of documents
and you can use the re

sources at the museum to
make better decisions and
better choices. I want us to
spend more time not only
studying nature and talking
about nature, but actually do
ing something about it in the
field.
This is a big moment for
me, as my current role allows
me to combine all of my in
terests in one institution.
TSD: What does your new
position entail, and what
do you foresee as your
agenda with the organiza
tion?
CS: The Wildlife Conser
vation Society is one of the
oldest environmental organi
zations in the U.S. From the
very beginning, it had a two
pronged focus, on the one
hand building the Bronx
Zoo in New York, and then
on the other, doing field re
search and conservation ini
tially focused on North
American mammals. Over
the years it has grown dra
matically with field pro
grams and conservation pro
grams in more than 67 coun
tries around the world. So I
oversee the forests and
aquariums of New York and
the many global conservation
programs. It's a fun job, but
it's a team effort more than
anything. I have great col
leagues both in New York and
around the world that are real
ly committed to its mission.
TSD: How can students and
members of the Stanford
community lead ecologi
cally conscious lives and
contribute to more wide
scale conservation efforts?
CS: Everything from the
daily choices that you make
as a citizen including issues
like what you eat and what
you drink. For instance, how
you deal with elements like
fisheries, and making sure
you're looking at [eating fish
from] sustainable fisheries,
driving some of the markets
of the goods of certified
products with ways of pro
ducing things that are envi
ronmentally more friendly. I
think that being aware of
them and making smart
choices about what we do,
one person at a time... can
really start changing the
world.
At a place like Stanford,
[the] environment touches
every dimension of every
profession and so I think the

question is to ask what the
Stanford community can do
to help the environment. For
instance, researchers can use
engineering for developing
ways of managing natural re
sources or reducing emis
sions. Sometimes people
think that conservation is left
up to the biologists, but we
need every profession and
every kind of skill set to have
an impact.
TSD: This might seem like
a silly question, but given
that you are President of
the Wildlife Conservation
Society, do you have a fa
vorite species?
CS: Asking me if I have a
favorite animal is like asking
if I have a favorite child! I'll
tell you, though, one of the
animals that have always
blown me away are hum
mingbirds. Having grown up
in Colombia, which has more

than 100 species of hum
mingbirds, they are extraor
dinary animals that, when
you think about it, have de
veloped a very particular
lifestyle in co-evolution be
tween many plants and has
with incredible adaptations.
One of my favorite hum
mingbirds is the short-billed
hummingbird and it is found
in the Andes in Columbia
and Ecuador. [The short
billed hummingbird] is
about three inches long with
a three-inch bill, which is
quite extraordinary. Hu
mans in the field have stud
ied it, and I just think it's an
incredible creature. So
that's one, but there are
many others.

Cristian Samper is the president and CEO of
the Wildlife Conservation Society, a role he as
cended to in 2010 after serving as Director of
the Smithsonian Institute's National Museum of
Natural History. The Daily sat down with Sam
per, who is in town to speak in Silicon Valley, to
discuss his start as a botanist, the steps Stan
ford students can take to lead ecologically con
scious lives and (one of) his favorite species
the short-billed hummingbird.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Where did you
grow up? Did your childhood in South Amer
ica influence your passion for tropical envi
ronments?
Cristian Semper (CS): I grew up in Bogota,
Colombia, in the Andes, surrounded by tropical
nature. So that's one of the things that captivat
ed me from the time that I was a small child. I
used to take long hikes and see all these tropical
creatures, and I was always wondering what
they where, and that's what inspired me to be
come a biologist.
Fortunately, I had parents that supported me
and let me go [to] all sorts of crazy places across
the country, as well as a few teachers that gave
me opportunities to go out in the field and the
rainforest. You either love it or you hate it, and I
loved it.
TSD: Within your research on tropical envi
ronments and conservation, do you have a
specific focus for instance, a type of
ecosystem or animal?
CS: My training is actually in botany. I
worked in plants, and I did my Ph.D. work in the
Andean cloud forests, so that's where it started.
With any biologist, you focus on one organism or
one place until you start developing interests in
other areas, and over time you discover the
whole ecosystem.
I started as a botanist and then worked on
birds, and then bird-plant interactions, and from
there I became an ecologist and then over time
a conservation biologist.
TSD: Can you explain what you mean by con
servation biology, and how did you find your
self interested in it?
CS: Well, this is a relatively new field. One of
the things that captivated many of us to study
conservation biology is that you find that many
of the places that we study [and] the plants and
animals that we cherish, that we admire and ex
amine, are increasingly under threat. The num
ber of places that I studied when I was a teenag
er or college student, where there's been an in
creasing pressure on losing some of these

transformation, global warming and invasive
species as causing ecological change.
forests, I think more and
more of us at some point de
cide to do something about it.
The challenge is that
when you make that transi
tion to conservation biology
you discover that the process
of biology and other disci
plines are interconnected.
For instance, economics and
many other disciplines [are
crucial to] understanding the
social and environmental dy
namics of what's happening
[in an ecosystem]. In some
ways, this is still a field that's
evolving, and we're increas
ingly combining biology with
other fields everything
from economics to engineer
ing to really try to under
stand and preserve some of
the things we care about.
TSD: In your opinion, what
have been the most promi
nent causes of ecological
change? Is it global warm
ing?
CS: It depends on where
you are. Clearly, global
warming is one. Habitat
transformation still is a big
driver in many areas, partic
ularly in the tropics. Every
thing from deforestation to
infrastructural dams and
rivers there are a lot of is
sues about transforming the
natural habits to giving way
to kinds of production.
Global warming is cer
tainly having an impact. I've
seen it first hand in the An
des. Colombia where I
grew up has more than
twenty glaciers in the tropi
cal mountains with high ele
vation. Half of the glaciers
that existed when I was a
teenager have disappeared
at this point. This impacts
the creatures that live there,
and increasingly it impacts
the people affected by the
water. So that's a second big
driver.

In particular places, inva
sive species are ruining fresh
water systems. So it is a com
bination of all these drivers
of change that are happening
increasingly in many parts of
the world. Some of them we
can fix short-term and some
of them will have global im
pacts that we can help with
long-term projects, like cli
mate change.

TSD: What are some of the
problems we can fix in the
short-term?
CS: We're trying to tackle
all of them to some extent.
For habitat transformation, I
think there are a couple of
things we can do. One is iden
tifying areas that are critical
for conservation and trying
to set some of them aside for
conservation. In fact, we've
passed a lot through Con
gress in the last 20 years set
ting aside places for conser
vation.
More and more we're try
ing to look at the various as
pects of cultural production
systems ... try to mitigate
some of the impacts that
they're having. There are dif
ferent ways to produce food.
There's no doubt that food
production is going to be one
of the big, big changes. We
have to produce about 50
percent more food for our
growing population, and for
the climate that's huge. The
question is how we're going
to produce that.
Of course in the area of
climate change there are a
number of steps that need to
be taken. A big one is avoid
ing deforestation, as defor
estation contributes to big
emissions of carbon. About
70 percent of global emis
sions of CO2 come from de
forestation ... There are a
number of steps that need to
be taken, everything from
the choices you make every
day and the work we do in
the field and the decisions
politicians make or don't
make. We need a better mod
el for development.
TSD: How did your posi
tion as Director of the
Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of Natu
ral History prepare you for
your role as President and
CEO of the Wildlife Con
servation Society?
CS: I think the two ele
ments that really prepared
me ...was first of all [that]
these museums are a lot
about the public side and how
you use the museum. For
many, these are windows into
nature and the way you con
nect people in the urban en
vironment with the changes
that are happening out there.
Secondly the fact [is] that
scientists at museums have a
wide variety of documents
and you can use the re

sources at the museum to
make better decisions and
better choices. I want us to
spend more time not only
studying nature and talking
about nature, but actually do
ing something about it in the
field.
This is a big moment for
me, as my current role allows
me to combine all of my in
terests in one institution.
TSD: What does your new
position entail, and what
do you foresee as your
agenda with the organiza
tion?
CS: The Wildlife Conser
vation Society is one of the
oldest environmental organi
zations in the U.S. From the
very beginning, it had a two
pronged focus, on the one
hand building the Bronx
Zoo in New York, and then
on the other, doing field re
search and conservation ini
tially focused on North
American mammals. Over
the years it has grown dra
matically with field pro
grams and conservation pro
grams in more than 67 coun
tries around the world. So I
oversee the forests and
aquariums of New York and
the many global conservation
programs. It's a fun job, but
it's a team effort more than
anything. I have great col
leagues both in New York and
around the world that are real
ly committed to its mission.
TSD: How can students and
members of the Stanford
community lead ecologi
cally conscious lives and
contribute to more wide
scale conservation efforts?
CS: Everything from the
daily choices that you make
as a citizen including issues
like what you eat and what
you drink. For instance, how
you deal with elements like
fisheries, and making sure
you're looking at [eating fish
from] sustainable fisheries,
driving some of the markets
of the goods of certified
products with ways of pro
ducing things that are envi
ronmentally more friendly. I
think that being aware of
them and making smart
choices about what we do,
one person at a time... can
really start changing the
world.
At a place like Stanford,
[the] environment touches
every dimension of every
profession and so I think the

question is to ask what the
Stanford community can do
to help the environment. For
instance, researchers can use
engineering for developing
ways of managing natural re
sources or reducing emis
sions. Sometimes people
think that conservation is left
up to the biologists, but we
need every profession and
every kind of skill set to have
an impact.
TSD: This might seem like
a silly question, but given
that you are President of
the Wildlife Conservation
Society, do you have a fa
vorite species?
CS: Asking me if I have a
favorite animal is like asking
if I have a favorite child! I'll
tell you, though, one of the
animals that have always
blown me away are hum
mingbirds. Having grown up
in Colombia, which has more

than 100 species of hum
mingbirds, they are extraor
dinary animals that, when
you think about it, have de
veloped a very particular
lifestyle in co-evolution be
tween many plants and has
with incredible adaptations.
One of my favorite hum
mingbirds is the short-billed
hummingbird and it is found
in the Andes in Columbia
and Ecuador. [The short
billed hummingbird] is
about three inches long with
a three-inch bill, which is
quite extraordinary. Hu
mans in the field have stud
ied it, and I just think it's an
incredible creature. So
that's one, but there are
many others.

Cristian Samper is the president and CEO of
the Wildlife Conservation Society, a role he as
cended to in 2010 after serving as Director of
the Smithsonian Institute's National Museum of
Natural History. The Daily sat down with Sam
per, who is in town to speak in Silicon Valley, to
discuss his start as a botanist, the steps Stan
ford students can take to lead ecologically con
scious lives and (one of) his favorite species
the short-billed hummingbird.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Where did you
grow up? Did your childhood in South Amer
ica influence your passion for tropical envi
ronments?
Cristian Semper (CS): I grew up in Bogota,
Colombia, in the Andes, surrounded by tropical
nature. So that's one of the things that captivat
ed me from the time that I was a small child. I
used to take long hikes and see all these tropical
creatures, and I was always wondering what
they where, and that's what inspired me to be
come a biologist.
Fortunately, I had parents that supported me
and let me go [to] all sorts of crazy places across
the country, as well as a few teachers that gave
me opportunities to go out in the field and the
rainforest. You either love it or you hate it, and I
loved it.
TSD: Within your research on tropical envi
ronments and conservation, do you have a
specific focus for instance, a type of
ecosystem or animal?
CS: My training is actually in botany. I
worked in plants, and I did my Ph.D. work in the
Andean cloud forests, so that's where it started.
With any biologist, you focus on one organism or
one place until you start developing interests in
other areas, and over time you discover the
whole ecosystem.
I started as a botanist and then worked on
birds, and then bird-plant interactions, and from
there I became an ecologist and then over time
a conservation biologist.
TSD: Can you explain what you mean by con
servation biology, and how did you find your
self interested in it?
CS: Well, this is a relatively new field. One of
the things that captivated many of us to study
conservation biology is that you find that many
of the places that we study [and] the plants and
animals that we cherish, that we admire and ex
amine, are increasingly under threat. The num
ber of places that I studied when I was a teenag
er or college student, where there's been an in
creasing pressure on losing some of these

Christian Samper, president and CEO of the
Wildlife Conservation Society, cited habitat
transformation, global warming and invasive
species as causing ecological change.
forests, I think more and
more of us at some point de
cide to do something about it.
The challenge is that
when you make that transi
tion to conservation biology
you discover that the process
of biology and other disci
plines are interconnected.
For instance, economics and
many other disciplines [are
crucial to] understanding the
social and environmental dy
namics of what's happening
[in an ecosystem]. In some
ways, this is still a field that's
evolving, and we're increas
ingly combining biology with
other fields everything
from economics to engineer
ing to really try to under
stand and preserve some of
the things we care about.
TSD: In your opinion, what
have been the most promi
nent causes of ecological
change? Is it global warm
ing?
CS: It depends on where
you are. Clearly, global
warming is one. Habitat
transformation still is a big
driver in many areas, partic
ularly in the tropics. Every
thing from deforestation to
infrastructural dams and
rivers there are a lot of is
sues about transforming the
natural habits to giving way
to kinds of production.
Global warming is cer
tainly having an impact. I've
seen it first hand in the An
des. Colombia where I
grew up has more than
twenty glaciers in the tropi
cal mountains with high ele
vation. Half of the glaciers
that existed when I was a
teenager have disappeared
at this point. This impacts
the creatures that live there,
and increasingly it impacts
the people affected by the
water. So that's a second big
driver.

In particular places, inva
sive species are ruining fresh
water systems. So it is a com
bination of all these drivers
of change that are happening
increasingly in many parts of
the world. Some of them we
can fix short-term and some
of them will have global im
pacts that we can help with
long-term projects, like cli
mate change.

TSD: What are some of the
problems we can fix in the
short-term?
CS: We're trying to tackle
all of them to some extent.
For habitat transformation, I
think there are a couple of
things we can do. One is iden
tifying areas that are critical
for conservation and trying
to set some of them aside for
conservation. In fact, we've
passed a lot through Con
gress in the last 20 years set
ting aside places for conser
vation.
More and more we're try
ing to look at the various as
pects of cultural production
systems ... try to mitigate
some of the impacts that
they're having. There are dif
ferent ways to produce food.
There's no doubt that food
production is going to be one
of the big, big changes. We
have to produce about 50
percent more food for our
growing population, and for
the climate that's huge. The
question is how we're going
to produce that.
Of course in the area of
climate change there are a
number of steps that need to
be taken. A big one is avoid
ing deforestation, as defor
estation contributes to big
emissions of carbon. About
70 percent of global emis
sions of CO2 come from de
forestation ... There are a
number of steps that need to
be taken, everything from
the choices you make every
day and the work we do in
the field and the decisions
politicians make or don't
make. We need a better mod
el for development.
TSD: How did your posi
tion as Director of the
Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of Natu
ral History prepare you for
your role as President and
CEO of the Wildlife Con
servation Society?
CS: I think the two ele
ments that really prepared
me ...was first of all [that]
these museums are a lot
about the public side and how
you use the museum. For
many, these are windows into
nature and the way you con
nect people in the urban en
vironment with the changes
that are happening out there.
Secondly the fact [is] that
scientists at museums have a
wide variety of documents
and you can use the re

sources at the museum to
make better decisions and
better choices. I want us to
spend more time not only
studying nature and talking
about nature, but actually do
ing something about it in the
field.
This is a big moment for
me, as my current role allows
me to combine all of my in
terests in one institution.
TSD: What does your new
position entail, and what
do you foresee as your
agenda with the organiza
tion?
CS: The Wildlife Conser
vation Society is one of the
oldest environmental organi
zations in the U.S. From the
very beginning, it had a two
pronged focus, on the one
hand building the Bronx
Zoo in New York, and then
on the other, doing field re
search and conservation ini
tially focused on North
American mammals. Over
the years it has grown dra
matically with field pro
grams and conservation pro
grams in more than 67 coun
tries around the world. So I
oversee the forests and
aquariums of New York and
the many global conservation
programs. It's a fun job, but
it's a team effort more than
anything. I have great col
leagues both in New York and
around the world that are real
ly committed to its mission.
TSD: How can students and
members of the Stanford
community lead ecologi
cally conscious lives and
contribute to more wide
scale conservation efforts?
CS: Everything from the
daily choices that you make
as a citizen including issues
like what you eat and what
you drink. For instance, how
you deal with elements like
fisheries, and making sure
you're looking at [eating fish
from] sustainable fisheries,
driving some of the markets
of the goods of certified
products with ways of pro
ducing things that are envi
ronmentally more friendly. I
think that being aware of
them and making smart
choices about what we do,
one person at a time... can
really start changing the
world.
At a place like Stanford,
[the] environment touches
every dimension of every
profession and so I think the

question is to ask what the
Stanford community can do
to help the environment. For
instance, researchers can use
engineering for developing
ways of managing natural re
sources or reducing emis
sions. Sometimes people
think that conservation is left
up to the biologists, but we
need every profession and
every kind of skill set to have
an impact.
TSD: This might seem like
a silly question, but given
that you are President of
the Wildlife Conservation
Society, do you have a fa
vorite species?
CS: Asking me if I have a
favorite animal is like asking
if I have a favorite child! I'll
tell you, though, one of the
animals that have always
blown me away are hum
mingbirds. Having grown up
in Colombia, which has more

than 100 species of hum
mingbirds, they are extraor
dinary animals that, when
you think about it, have de
veloped a very particular
lifestyle in co-evolution be
tween many plants and has
with incredible adaptations.
One of my favorite hum
mingbirds is the short-billed
hummingbird and it is found
in the Andes in Columbia
and Ecuador. [The short
billed hummingbird] is
about three inches long with
a three-inch bill, which is
quite extraordinary. Hu
mans in the field have stud
ied it, and I just think it's an
incredible creature. So
that's one, but there are
many others.
