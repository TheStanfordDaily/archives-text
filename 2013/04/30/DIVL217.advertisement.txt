Stanford Continuing Studies presents
The Other Bagpipes: Exotic and Lesser-Known
Piping Traditions of the World
Wednesday, May 1
7:30 pm
Annenberg Auditorium
Cummings Art Building
Stanford University
Free & open to the public
For a thousand years, across Europe, North Africa, and much of
the Near East, rural people danced to, performed rituals with,
and treasured the music of their indigenous bagpipes—once one
of the most übiquitous of folk instruments. Today, though, the
bagpipe is most often thought of as a uniquely Scottish instrument,
a circumstance largely due to the British Army's use of Scottish
regiments as the vanguard in their creation of the British Empire.
Join Kevin Carr, traditional musician, as he introduces listeners
to the bagpipes of many cultures, along with a bit of the folklore
associated with this powerful, beguiling, almost shamanic instrument.
The piping traditions of Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Spain,
Italy, Sweden, Slovakia, Croatia, Georgia, Iran, and Tunisia will
be represented.
