# Narcolepsy...Zzzzzzzzz
## 
### Taylor Brady 
I If you've never listened to "Nar
colepsy", by Third Eye Blind,
do it now. In fact, slot out 57:40
this evening to listen to their entire
self-titled album. Apparently cul
ture runs on a roughly 15-year cy
cle, so this disc should be hip
again. Anyway, anachronistic alt
rock isn't the subject of today's col
umn, but the lyrics of "Narcolepsy"
have a lot to do with what I'm trying
to say.
At a birthday party the last week
of winter quarter, I convened with a
friend whom I hadn't seen in quite
some time. Happy with what we
saw of one another's lives, we
arranged to have lunch Monday and
continue the conversation.
I slept through that lunch. And
while I could excuse it by recount
ing that I spent 2:15 Sunday after
noon to 6:15 Monday morning
working in Y2E2, I know that ulti
mately I find my behavior abhor
rent. The point is not that I should
n't complete my assignments, how
ever inane and onerous, but that I
know better than to selfishly allow
somebody to wait for me in a dining
hall. At the very least, I could have
sent him a message saying that I'd
probably need to crash in the morn
ing and would have to reschedule.
Last week, I presented my
metaphor of the golden dodgeballs,
and while it rings true in some
sense, the way that I phrased it also
implied that the relative weight of
each way that we can spend our
time here is equivalent or can be
quantified like currency.
It's not. In fact, one of the most
fundamental truths that Stanford's
culture of obsessive individualism
scoffs at is the idea that we can and
must stop playing the game alto
gether. If we view people as valu
able baubles to juggle along with all
of our other commitments, hookups
to get our rocks off, marginal costs
in the ledger, then we delegitimize
the diversity of contributions that
we can make to one another's lives.
More importantly, perhaps, by
narrowing our perspective on what
people are, we cheapen them as
soon as they stop serving our pur
poses. What's so insidious about
this mentality is that it fools us into
believing that real human relation
ships are a choice instead of the
baseline power that makes us all
okay.
Most exemplary of the fact that
we are encouraged to and do ignore
necessities at this university are our
sleeping habits. When I began in

sisting on a more regular sleep
schedule this year, I found myself
proud of catching six, even five,
hours of sleep each evening and
dropping into a fourteen hour veri
table coma Friday night. How pre
posterous. I'm always weary. I fall
asleep in strange places during the
middle of the day.
Here's a list of a few of the
strangest places that I've slept on
Stanford campus:
1.) On top of a washing machine
so that when the timer went
off, I could wake up and keep
doing laundry
2.) In my math TAs office the af
ternoon before a final
3.) The bookstore cafe, where, in
fact, the employees and I of
ten bet on how many cups of
coffee before I crash
4.) On a stool next to a scorching
polymer extruding machine
5.) Blume Center lab floor
Laugh all you want. I've long
joked with myself that all that I'll be
remembered for here are narcolep
tic fits in the strangest places.
Yet there's something more sin
ister than a medical condition at
work here. Adderall and modafinil
can't cure it. Our insomnia is a con
scious choice, and worse, as Mark
Slouka pointed out in "Quitting the
Paint Factory," we worship this
sleeplessness, wear it like a
masochistic badge of honor. We
consult Buckminster Fuller on
polyphasic sleeping, on ways to
maximize our productivity, spinning
and spinning more quickly and

more efficiently like shrinking sili
con hard disks, cramming terabits
of memory into our ever narrowing
minds.
There's an undeniable connec
tion between the way that we com
modity our relationships and the
way that we commodify our
sleep. They take time, and time, as
we are constantly reminded, is mon
ey. So we starve ourselves thinking
that we have better, more valuable
things to be doing. But it's time
that we recognize that each of them
are priceless foundations without
which we could not have our super
human bursts of productivity.
I don't want to be remembered
only for narcolepsy, so I'm making
the conscious choice to rest. To rec
ognize that there are some prereq
uisites to being human, and that if
we stop seeing them as burdens we
might just make all of our lives a lit
tle better. Don't starve yourself of
humanity until you have a physiolog
ical or psychological breakdown in
the middle of class. Dr. Dement, you
may be preaching to the choir with
me, but I feel like the two of us are
shrieking in a cloistered echo cham
ber when we try to spread the mes
sage about healthy doses of sleep.
Here's my challenge for the
week: sleep. No, seriously. Go to
bed at ten tonight. See if, as I heard
a young woman say on the way to
class today, "I just feel so much bet
ter when I get sleep."
