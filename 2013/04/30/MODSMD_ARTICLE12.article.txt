## Jason Collins shapes me once again 
### Joey Beyda 
The first time I watched Ja
son Collins 'Ol play basket
ball, I was four. Fifteen
years later, I can't say that
I remember what his shot
looked like, how quickly he hustled
down the Maples Pavilion floor or
whether I could tell the difference be
tween him and his twin brother Jar
ron Collins 'Ol.
But I absolutely remember that,
back in 1997,1 couldn't care less about
Collins' sexual orientation.
So when Collins announced in a
Monday Sports Illustrated article that
he was gay, becoming the first athlete
in major American sports history—
that's the MLB, NFL, NBA and
NHL—to come out while he was still
a player, I felt myself asking: Why
should I care now ?
Of course, we're not all toddlers.
People have their prejudices; some
fans carry those prejudices with
them into arenas and ballparks.
And, in my view, that's their loss.
Here's why: I've always thought
that the true joy in being a sports
fan is something that is born early
on. It's about knowing the players
by name, getting lost in the flow of
the game, learning which opposing
teams to hate the sorts of things
that a four-year-old can do.
When you get older, all of that is
augmented by analyzing the action,
understanding the full course of a
team's season and learning about
what players are like off the court.
But none of those additions are at
the heart of what makes a sporting
event fun. As much as possible, I try
to be a four-year-old in the stands
and a 19-year-old on the car ride
home. That kind of sporting experi
ence is blind to the X's and O's, blind
to the bigger picture and blind to
prejudice. So if you go to a game
looking to heckle Collins, as he says
he expects some fans to do, you're
the one missing out.
But even for those of us without
those prejudices, it's also a step in
the wrong direction to see Collins as
any different than the next NBA
star or any different than we saw
him on Sunday evening. Here's a
player who has dumped his heart
and soul into his sport at the profes
sional level for over a decade, yet re
gardless, today's announcement is
bound to define his legacy. Barring
some huge strides late in his career,
in 25 years Collins will be known
simply as the first active American
pro sports player to come out.
It took courage to do what
Collins did on Monday, and his
achievement should be recognized.
But it's a crime to reduce his other
achievements in life and there
are many: graduating from Stan
ford, playing pro basketball for so
long, reaching nine NBA postsea
sons —to his acknowledgement of
an identity that's a bit different than
we're used to out of a professional
athlete.
Stanford Athletics Director
Bernard Muir said it best in a press
release this morning: "On behalf of
a diverse athletic community, I hope
that we progress to the point in soci
ety where truthful moments like
these are no longer newsworthy."
He's right that we're not at that
point yet, when Collins' announce
ment is front-page news for ESPN,
the New York Times and everyone
in between.
In the near future, a whole bunch
of cameras will be turned in Collins'
direction disproportionally many
for a role player who played 10 min
utes per game this season. The issue
of LGBT tolerance in major sports
will get another serious look. (The
Daily, at least, is working on a fea
ture.) Maybe a few other players
will follow Collins' example. And
judging by their initial reactions on
Monday morning, Stanford stu
dents and alumni will once again
take pride in the trails blazed by one
of their own.
But Collins made a point of say
ing that he didn't want his sexual
orientation to define him. So the
next time I turn on an NBA game
which, admittedly, is quite rare
and see Jason Collins, I'm going
to try my hardest not to think of him
as a pioneer or a national hero. In
the years to come we'll have the
chance to reflect on the impact and
bravery of his decision, but for now,
I'm going to take Collins' game at
face value, just like he would want
me to. I owe him that much because
I do actually think of him as a pio
neer and a national hero, and he de-
