# TWO-SPORT STAR
## FARR STRIKES A TOUGH BALANCE 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Less than 40 minutes into
the 2013 Stanford
women's lacrosse sea
son, midfielder Hannah
Farr had already picked
up two yellow cards. Farr could be
forgiven for her aggressiveness,
however, as she was in the process
of adjusting to the more tightly reg
ulated women's lacrosse game after
playing soccer all fall the sopho
more is the rare Stanford student
athlete who competes for the Cardi
nal in more than one sport.
Her coaches say that if anyone
is equipped to handle the rigors of
playing two sports at a collegiate
level, it is Farr.
"You have to look at the individ
ual and see if they can battle
through an entire season of being
in-season," said Stanford women's
lacrosse head coach Amy Bokker.
"For anyone who knows Hannah,
that's not a question she's a
great student, a great athlete, and
she's dedicated to whatever she's
doing at that time."
Growing up in Hillsborough,
Calif., Farr thought her collegiate
future would be in soccer, with
lacrosse as a less-serious hobby.
"I knew since I was an eighth
grader that I wanted to play Divi
sion I soccer in college, so starting
sophomore year when the soccer
process really stalled, I was fully
focused on my club soccer," Farr
said. "I was playing high school
lacrosse and I really enjoyed that,
but I felt like I wanted to do college
soccer."
But after a strong performance
at a lacrosse showcase tournament,
Farr said she began hearing from
college lacrosse coaches, including
Bokker. Bokker helped Farr con

nect with Stanford women's soccer
head coach Paul Ratcliffe, and once
both coaches assured Farr that she
could play for their teams on the
Farm, Farr was sold.
"We were really impressed with
her," Ratcliffe said, "because she
had shown so much talent and drive
in both sports."
Farr appealed in six games for
the women's soccer team during its
2011 national championship season,
but in the 2012 season she took on a
much larger role. Farr played in 23
games, usually as one of the first
substitutes off the bench as Rat
cliffe often used her to inject a
spark into his team's midfield.
The midfielder made a more im
mediate impact on the Cardinal
lacrosse squad as she scored 23
goals and was named a first team
All-MPSF selection during her
freshman campaign. So far in 2013,
Farr has tallied 24 goals and 12 as
sists while chipping in with 28 draw
controls and 12 ground balls as
Stanford heads into the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation playoffs,
which begin this Thursday with a
semifinal matchup against Cal.
While at Stanford, Farr com
partmentalizes her time so that she
is only focused on one sport at a
time. In the summer and fall, she
trains "100 percent for soccer"
Farr said she literally does not pick
up a lacrosse stick until the soccer
season finishes. During winter
break, Farr transitions into
lacrosse and keeps her attention
completely on that sport through
the end of the season.
"She's done a great job balanc
ing it because she's such a hard
worker," Ratcliffe said. "I think she
gives 100 percent energy into
lacrosse during lacrosse season,
and then 100 percent energy into
soccer when she's with us."
The way her schedule is set up,

Fan- rarely has an off-season but
she likes it that way.
"My friends who play just
lacrosse or just soccer say that off
season is when you are working re
ally hard, but you don't have a game
that weekend so it's harder to real
ly stay focused, whereas I always
have a game to look forward to,"
Fan- said. "I love competing and

when I have a game, it really fires
me up, so I'd say that it's awesome
to play [two sports]."
Although the physical rigors can
be difficult Farr said she is "best
friends" with the training staff—
the sophomore also said playing
two sports keeps her mentally

"I'm the type of person
that is very focused on my
flaws and what I can be better
at in each sport," Farr said.
"[Playing two sports] lets me
not think about that for a little
bit and focus on an entire oth
er sport."
Both coaches said they al
low Farr to be solely focused
on the other sport during
that season. As a former two
sport collegiate athlete her
self— Bokker played both
field hockey and lacrosse at
The College of William &
Mary Bokker said her ad
vice to Farr is to "stay fo
cused on whatever you are

doing at the time."
According to her coaches,
Farr quickly adjusts to the
each sport, and her energy
when she returns is a
tremendous boost to both
teams. Bokker said that Farr
made an immediate impact
on the level of competition at
the lacrosse team's practices
once she joined training in
January.
"She really challenges her
teammates, and that was
something that was super ev
ident, especially to our fresh
men." Bokker said. "She
came out and competed for
every ground ball and every
draw and every one-v-one,
and that really elevated [our
team]."
Farr said that although
she gets asked all the time,
she can't decide which sport
she likes better.

"I love how you can be so
physical in soccer and it's just
a purely athletic sport," Fan
said. "But in lacrosse, I love
how it's more like basketball
where there's an offensive
and defensive end and you're
going more one-on-one."
Given her passion for both
sports, Farr said that she
plans to continue playing
both all four years at Stan
ford. Afterward, she doesn't
know what the future will
hold.
"It will be weird not play
ing organized sports, but
that's kind of why I'm playing
two now," Farr said. "I want
to get the most out of college
athletics because I think that
right now, that's the pinnacle
of women's sports."

sport collegiate athlete her
self— Bokker played both
field hockey and lacrosse at
The College of William &
Mary Bokker said her ad
vice to Farr is to "stay fo
cused on whatever you are

doing at the time."
According to her coaches,
Farr quickly adjusts to the
each sport, and her energy
when she returns is a
tremendous boost to both
teams. Bokker said that Farr
made an immediate impact
on the level of competition at
the lacrosse team's practices
once she joined training in
January.
"She really challenges her
teammates, and that was
something that was super ev
ident, especially to our fresh
men." Bokker said. "She
came out and competed for
every ground ball and every
draw and every one-v-one,
and that really elevated [our
team]."
Farr said that although
she gets asked all the time,
she can't decide which sport
she likes better.

"I love how you can be so
physical in soccer and it's just
a purely athletic sport," Fan
said. "But in lacrosse, I love
how it's more like basketball
where there's an offensive
and defensive end and you're
going more one-on-one."
Given her passion for both
sports, Farr said that she
plans to continue playing
both all four years at Stan
ford. Afterward, she doesn't
know what the future will
hold.
"It will be weird not play
ing organized sports, but
that's kind of why I'm playing
two now," Farr said. "I want
to get the most out of college
athletics because I think that
right now, that's the pinnacle
of women's sports."

Less than 40 minutes into
the 2013 Stanford
women's lacrosse sea
son, midfielder Hannah
Farr had already picked
up two yellow cards. Farr could be
forgiven for her aggressiveness,
however, as she was in the process
of adjusting to the more tightly reg
ulated women's lacrosse game after
playing soccer all fall the sopho
more is the rare Stanford student
athlete who competes for the Cardi
nal in more than one sport.
Her coaches say that if anyone
is equipped to handle the rigors of
playing two sports at a collegiate
level, it is Farr.
"You have to look at the individ
ual and see if they can battle
through an entire season of being
in-season," said Stanford women's
lacrosse head coach Amy Bokker.
"For anyone who knows Hannah,
that's not a question she's a
great student, a great athlete, and
she's dedicated to whatever she's
doing at that time."
Growing up in Hillsborough,
Calif., Farr thought her collegiate
future would be in soccer, with
lacrosse as a less-serious hobby.
"I knew since I was an eighth
grader that I wanted to play Divi
sion I soccer in college, so starting
sophomore year when the soccer
process really stalled, I was fully
focused on my club soccer," Farr
said. "I was playing high school
lacrosse and I really enjoyed that,
but I felt like I wanted to do college
soccer."
But after a strong performance
at a lacrosse showcase tournament,
Farr said she began hearing from
college lacrosse coaches, including
Bokker. Bokker helped Farr con

nect with Stanford women's soccer
head coach Paul Ratcliffe, and once
both coaches assured Farr that she
could play for their teams on the
Farm, Farr was sold.
"We were really impressed with
her," Ratcliffe said, "because she
had shown so much talent and drive
in both sports."
Farr appealed in six games for
the women's soccer team during its
2011 national championship season,
but in the 2012 season she took on a
much larger role. Farr played in 23
games, usually as one of the first
substitutes off the bench as Rat
cliffe often used her to inject a
spark into his team's midfield.
The midfielder made a more im
mediate impact on the Cardinal
lacrosse squad as she scored 23
goals and was named a first team
All-MPSF selection during her
freshman campaign. So far in 2013,
Farr has tallied 24 goals and 12 as
sists while chipping in with 28 draw
controls and 12 ground balls as
Stanford heads into the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation playoffs,
which begin this Thursday with a
semifinal matchup against Cal.
While at Stanford, Farr com
partmentalizes her time so that she
is only focused on one sport at a
time. In the summer and fall, she
trains "100 percent for soccer"
Farr said she literally does not pick
up a lacrosse stick until the soccer
season finishes. During winter
break, Farr transitions into
lacrosse and keeps her attention
completely on that sport through
the end of the season.
"She's done a great job balanc
ing it because she's such a hard
worker," Ratcliffe said. "I think she
gives 100 percent energy into
lacrosse during lacrosse season,
and then 100 percent energy into
soccer when she's with us."
The way her schedule is set up,

Fan- rarely has an off-season but
she likes it that way.
"My friends who play just
lacrosse or just soccer say that off
season is when you are working re
ally hard, but you don't have a game
that weekend so it's harder to real
ly stay focused, whereas I always
have a game to look forward to,"
Fan- said. "I love competing and

when I have a game, it really fires
me up, so I'd say that it's awesome
to play [two sports]."
Although the physical rigors can
be difficult Farr said she is "best
friends" with the training staff—
the sophomore also said playing
two sports keeps her mentally

"I'm the type of person
that is very focused on my
flaws and what I can be better
