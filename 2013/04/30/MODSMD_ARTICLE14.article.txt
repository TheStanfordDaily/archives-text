### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
After the streaking Cardinal
baseball squad was abruptly
stopped in its tracks over the week
end by a heartbreaking sweep at
the hands of a scrappy Oregon
Ducks team, No. 25 Stanford (23-15,
9-9 Pac-12) will try to regroup
tonight as it meets Saint Mary (17-
26,8-7 WCC) at Sunken Diamond.
This will be the second meeting
of the season between the Cardinal
and the Gaels, as the two teams met
back in February before conference
play started. The Gaels had the mis
fortune of running into the Cardinal
in the middle of Stanford's early
nine-game winning streak.
In that game, the Cardinal
cruised to a 7-2 victory as it grabbed
an early 3-1 lead and took advan
tage of a weak Saint Mary's bullpen
to add late insurance runs to seal
the win.
This time around, Stanford will
have to take a similar approach
against the Gaels pitching staff to
muscle its way to victory. Saint
Mary's starting pitchers have held
down the fort for the most part but
its bullpen has been a glaring weak
ness.
The Gaels' regular weekday
starting pitcher, senior righty
Kelsey Outram, owns a 5.08 ERA
and has been mediocre at best; in
his last outing against Sacramento
State, he only allowed one earned
run in three innings but allowed
four runs in five innings in a previ

ous relief outing.
Cardinal hitters could also take
advantage of the weak Saint Mary's
bullpen. Only two pitchers in the
bullpen have an ERA lower than
5.08.
After getting its recently hot
bats quieted in Eugene over the

weekend, the Cardinal offense will
need a good game to get back on
track, regardless of whether it
comes against the starters or the re
lievers.
The Cardinal hitters could only
combine for six RBI over the week
end, four of which came off the bats
of senior designated hitter Justin
Ringo and junior first baseman Bri
an Ragira.
Ringo has proven to be both a
table-setter and run producer from
his leadoff spot in the lineup. His
.333 average and .408 on-base-per
centage indicate that he gets on
base consistently to give the team
opportunities to score. In addition,
he has blasted six home runs this
year good for second on the
team and driven in 28 runs, tied
for first on the squad with Ragira.
Ragira, after a torrid stretch in
which he homered four times in
seven games, continued his solid
hitting at Oregon, tallying four hits
in the series and driving in two
runs. The first baseman has come
up huge as of late for the Cardinal
and has provided a welcome dose
of power in the heart of the lineup.
The stage is set for the re
match. Once again, Saint Mary's is
playing the Cardinal fresh off of a
weekend sweep over Santa Clara.
Stanford will hope to put a halt to
that momentum and regain some
of its own. First pitch at Sunken
Diamond is scheduled for 5:30 p.m.
