## 
### â€“ Sam Fisher 
Freshman Krista Hardebeck and sophomore Ellen
Tsay fell in the singles finals of the Championship Di
vision and Invitational Division respectively of the
Pac-12 Championships in Ojai, Calif, on Sunday.
After cruising through the first two rounds in
straight sets while losing only nine games combined,
Hardebeck almost saw herself knocked out by an un
ranked opponent. Utah's Sarah Pham gave Harde
beck a scare, winning the first set of their match 6-0.
But Hardebeck fought back, taking the second set 7-
5 and dominating the third
set 6-1 to advance to the
semifinals.
In the semifinals, Harde
beck had the rare opportuni
ty to play the underdog role
against No. 8 Anett Schut
ting from Cal. But Schutting
could not put up much of a
fight, as Hardebeck rolled to
a 6-4, 6-2 victory to advance
to the finals.
Her opponent, No. 40
Kyle McPhillips from
UCLA, almost did not make
it that far, thanks to Stan
ford junior Rristie Ahn. The
No. 29 Ahn, who won the
Pac-12 singles title in 2011,
took the first set from

McPhillips in their semifinal
match, but lost the last
match 3-6, 6-1, 6-4.
In the final, McPhillips
took no mercy on Harde
beck, stunning the Cardinal
freshman 6-1, 6-0 to grab the
Championship Division title
easily.
In the Invitational Divi
sion, all four Stanford play
ers, senior Natalie Dillon,
junior Amelia Herring,
freshman Lindsey Kostas
and Tsay, advanced to the
Round of 16. Dillon and Her
ring advanced no further,
falling to Washington State's
Elizaveta Luzina and USC's
Kaitlyn Christian respec
tively.
Tsay cruised over Cal's
Cecilia Estlander, but
Kostas needed a third-set
tiebreaker to defeat the
pesky Hannah James from

Arizona State. Those wins
set up an all-Stanford quar
terfinal matchup between
Tsay and Kostas, in which
Tsay prevailed 6-3, 6-0.
After advancing when
Cal's Tayler Davis retired
due to injury, Tsay faced
Christian in the final. Chris
tian and Tsay split the first
two sets, but Christian pre
vailed in the third set for a 6-
1, 3-6, 6-4 victory her sec
ond over a Cardinal player
during the tournament
and the Invitational Division
title.
Stanford now turns its fo
cus to the NCAA Champi
onships, which begin on Fri
day, May 10. The site of
Stanford's first round
matchup is still to be deter
mined.
