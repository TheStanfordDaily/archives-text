## Cardinal earns easy sweep 
### MICHAEL PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though Stanford Softball
showed no mercy over the visiting
Utah Utes, the sport's rules did.
The No. 15 Cardinal swept the Utes
at Smith Family Stadium over the
weekend, winning by the mercy
rule in all three games, 8-0, 12-0
and 9-1 on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday respectively. Over the
weekend, Stanford (32-16, 9-9 Pac
-12) produced 29 runs on 41 hits,
easily its most productive offensive
series on the year, that resulted in a
three-game sweep of the Utes (23-
27-1, 6-15 Pac-12).

Freshman first baseman Kayla
Bonstrom continued her string of
impressive displays with six hits,
including two home runs and seven
RBI over the weekend. She came
into the series with seven hits in her
previous 16 at bats with six RBI in
that stretch. Although Bonstrom
may have been Stanford's star at
the plate over the weekend, the
Cardinal won with production from
the entire lineup.
"One through nine," Bonstrom
said, "right now we're all hitting the
ball really well."
The Card's new leadoff hitter,
sophomore third baseman Hanna
Winter finished the series with sev
en hits and nine RBI. Heading into
Sunday's game, the only stat miss
ing from Winter's strong weekend
was a home run.
Speaking about Bonstrom's
mammoth home run blast to center
field after Saturday's game, Winter
commented, "I'm jealous, I want to
hit a home run. Hopefully, some
time soon, I'll get one."
And in fact, in Sunday's finale,
Winter hit her first collegiate home
run to put the Cardinal up 5-0 in the
second inning.
In addition to the solid perform
ance at the plate, Stanford wit
nessed a revival in the pitching staff
as senior Teagan Gerhart and
freshman Kelsey Stevens combined
to limit Utah to just eight hits and
one run over the three-game set.

dered 26 runs over the previous four games,
but Gerhart and Stevens showed no signs of
that slump as they dispatched a Utah lineup
that came in hot, scoring 25 runs in its two
previous games against Southern Utah.
"They pitched really well; they bounced
back," Stanford head coach John Rittman
said of Gerhart and Stevens. "They've had a
rough stretch of games coming into this
weekend but they're both very capable pitch
ers and it's a lot about trust, going out there
and knowing that you can do the job and they
both have done that."
Stanford will need the improved pitching
to continue as it heads into a battle with UC-
Davis on Wednesday and the always-critical
series with No. 10 California over the week
end. The key to Stanford's success, at least in
Rittman's eyes, is simple.
"We need to continue to pitch well,"
Rittman said. "That's the start of everything
for us."
Stanford topped the Aggies (21-24, 8-10
Big West) 8-0 at the Stanford Nike Invita
tional at Smith Family Stadium back in Feb
ruary. While not the greatest threat offen
sively, the Aggies do possess four solid pitch
ers with sub-3.00 ERAs that can certainly
slow down opposing offenses. As a whole, the
Aggies' 2.36 team ERA on the season ranks
in the top 50 nationally.
Though the looming showdown against
Cal is this weekend, the Cardinal cannot for
get about the Aggies. The Cardinal has
dropped two mid-week non-conference
games in a row, falling to Pacific 9-6 and
Saint Mary's 5-2 the past two Wednesdays.
In the hunt for hosting a regional in the post
season with only eight regular season games

remaining, another loss to a weaker non-con
ference opponent could prove devastating.
First pitch Wednesday at UC-Davis is
scheduled for 3 p.m.
