## Cardinal earns easy sweep 
### MICHAEL PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though Stanford Softball
showed no mercy over the visiting
Utah Utes, the sport's rules did.
The No. 15 Cardinal swept the Utes
at Smith Family Stadium over the
weekend, winning by the mercy
rule in all three games, 8-0, 12-0
and 9-1 on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday respectively. Over the
weekend, Stanford (32-16, 9-9 Pac
-12) produced 29 runs on 41 hits,
easily its most productive offensive
series on the year, that resulted in a
three-game sweep of the Utes (23-
27-1, 6-15 Pac-12).

Freshman first baseman Kayla
Bonstrom continued her string of
impressive displays with six hits,
including two home runs and seven
RBI over the weekend. She came
into the series with seven hits in her
previous 16 at bats with six RBI in
that stretch. Although Bonstrom
may have been Stanford's star at
the plate over the weekend, the
Cardinal won with production from
the entire lineup.
"One through nine," Bonstrom
said, "right now we're all hitting the
ball really well."
The Card's new leadoff hitter,
sophomore third baseman Hanna
Winter finished the series with sev
en hits and nine RBI. Heading into
Sunday's game, the only stat miss
ing from Winter's strong weekend
was a home run.
Speaking about Bonstrom's
mammoth home run blast to center
field after Saturday's game, Winter
commented, "I'm jealous, I want to
hit a home run. Hopefully, some
time soon, I'll get one."
And in fact, in Sunday's finale,
Winter hit her first collegiate home
run to put the Cardinal up 5-0 in the
second inning.
In addition to the solid perform
ance at the plate, Stanford wit
nessed a revival in the pitching staff
as senior Teagan Gerhart and
freshman Kelsey Stevens combined
to limit Utah to just eight hits and
one run over the three-game set.
