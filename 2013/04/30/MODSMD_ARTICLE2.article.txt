## Collins' decision sparks pride, hope 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
As former Stanford basketball
star Jason Collins 'Ol's announce
ment that he is gay continues to re
verberate around the nation, Stan
ford community members reacted
with surprise and pride to the news
that the first openly gay active male
athlete in a major U.S. professional
sport was a Stanford graduate.
"It really makes me proud to
hear that Collins competed for
Stanford and that we have that as
pect of our lives in common," said
Noah Garcia 'l4, an openly gay
member of the men's swimming
and diving team.
Collins was a member of the
Cardinal basketball team from
1997-2001 before being drafted
18th overall by the Houston Rock
ets in the 2001 NBA Draft. Collins
is currently a free agent after play
ing for the Boston Celtics and the
Washington Wizards during the
2012-13 season.
In a first-person Sports Illus
trated article released on Monday
morning, Collins wrote, "I am a 34-
year-old NBA center. I'm black.
And I'm gay." He went on to detail
the process of coming to terms with
and publicly expressing his identity.
Former teammates express shock,
support
Collins' announcement came as
a surprise to some former team
mates. Julius Barnes 'O3, who
played with Collins for two seasons,
said he "did a double take" after
seeing the news on ESPN.com.
"I just never knew, not that it
would make any difference at all,"

Barnes said.
Barnes said that he has also
been in contact with other team
mates, who he described as "still in
shock" but also cognizant of the
emotional weight lifted by Collins'
announcement.
"To say the least, it takes a
brave and encouraging person to do
what he's done," Barnes said. "I
know for a fact that his former
teammates and anybody that knows
Jason is 100 percent behind him."
Current Stanford basketball as
sistant coach Mark Madsen 'OO
MBA 'l2, who played alongside
Collins in college and as a profes
sional, called Collins "one of the
greatest people you will ever meet
in your life" in a statement.
"Basketball does not define Ja
son Collins. His decision to come
out publicly doesn't define Jason
Collins," Madsen wrote. "What de
fines Jason, is he is a first-rate hu
man being who made a huge contri
bution to this University, and every
team or community he has been a
part of."
Continuing the conversation
In the Sports Illustrated article,
Collins wrote, "I didn't set out to be
the first openly gay athlete playing
in a major American team sport.
But since I am, I'm happy to start
the conversation."
Many students voiced hope that
Collins' words would help to contin
ue to improve conditions for LGBT
athletes and students on campus.
"This is really just a watershed
moment, just because it's such a
public sphere and the stage that he

It really makes me proud that
Collins competed for Stanford.

Former Stanford basketball player Jason Collins '01, currently
a free agent in the NBA, announced that he was gay,
making him the first openly gay active male athlete in a major
U.S. professional sport. Collins' former Stanford team-mates
expressed their support for his announcement.
chose to come out on is so
massive," said Nathaniel
Williams 'l3 M.A. 'l4, com
munity coordinator for the
Queer-Straight Alliance.
"It's really great that he's a
Stanford alum and I think
we'll start to see the impact
here at Stanford."
Members of Stanford
Athletes and Allies Together
(STAAT), a student group
that aims to create a safe
space for LGBT and allied
varsity and club athletes on
campus, also expressed opti
mism that Collins' message
would encourage students
and athletes to support one
another.
Toni Kokenis 'l4, who co
founded STAAT with Garcia,
Annie Graham 'l4 and Smri
ti Sridhar 'l5, noted that fe
male athletes and retired
male competitors had come

out before Collins but added
that Collins' status as an ac
tive professional athlete am
plifies his message.
"It creates an environ
ment that you can play and
you can be LGBT and still be
successful, and you don't feel
like you need to completely
separate those and hide
from yourself or your team,"
said Kokenis, a member of
the Stanford women's bas
ketball team. "It's encourag
ing people to be themselves,
whether they're playing
their sport or socializing
with their friends."
Following Collins' an
nouncement, Athletic Direc
tor Bernard Muir also re
leased a statement in sup
port.
"I am proud to hear that
Jason, one of our Stanford
sons, has taken a leadership
role on this topic," Muir
wrote. "On behalf of a di
verse athletic community, I
hope that we progress to the
point in society where truth
ful moments like these are

no longer newsworthy."
Garcia said that although
Stanford's culture is gener
ally accepting of LGBT stu
dents, athletes can struggle
to feel comfortable. He ex
pressed hope that Collins'
announcement would res
onate within the athletic
community and spark
change in the way that par
ticipants, administrators and
spectators think about
LGBT issues in athletics.
"Enormous personal sac
rifices are involved with con
cealing part of one's identi
ty," Garcia said. "All athletes
should be able to practice
and compete in an environ
ment where these sorts of
sacrifices do not have to be
made especially at Stan
ford."
