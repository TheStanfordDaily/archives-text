## Researchers create peel-and-stick solar cells 
### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of Stanford researchers has col
laborated with scientists at the Department
of Energy's National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) to produce the first suc
cessful demonstration of peel-and-stick solar
cells, which can be attached to almost any
surface or object.
Qi Wang, an NREL scientist who has
done extensive work with solar cells, first met
Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineer

ing Xiaolin Zheng at a conference last year.
The two decided to form a partnership after
realizing that peel-and-stick technology de
veloped at Stanford could be applied to solar
cells.
The research team also included NREL
research engineer William Nemeth, Dong
Rip Kim, an assistant professor in the divi
sion of mechanical engineering at Hanyang
University in Seoul, South Korea, and doctor
al students Chi Hwan Lee and In Sun Cho.
According to Zheng, the ability to attach
lighter and thinner solar cells to more sur

faces and objects, "from cars to light posts,"
will expand the energy source's potential us
es. The cells could even be affixed to items
like backpacks that are too small to accom
modate large and unwieldy solar panels.
While other researchers have previously
made flexible solar cells, the team's work is
unique for the cells' creation on a nickel-sili
con wafer, from which the cells are then
peeled off when dipped in water. The wafer
can subsequently be reused to fabricate new
solar cells.
After the cell is peeled from the
wafer, it is exposed to heat for ap
proximately 90 seconds before it
can be stuck to any surface. This
method preserves the integrity of
the cells, which maintain the same
level of performance even after be
ing dipped in water, peeled off of
the wafer and heated.
Though a study detailing the
preliminary stages of the team's re
sults was published in December in
the online version of Scientific Re
ports, Zheng said that work with
the peel-and-stick cells has contin
ued as researchers try to improve
the technology.
"We proved the idea works, and
that's really exciting," Zheng said.
"We have two ultimate goals. One is
to lower the cost of the solar cells
by lowering the weight of substrate
they are mounted on. The second is
to make the substrate lighter and
more flexible."
Lee, a co-author of the study,
agreed that the research team is
now "mainly focused on how to put
the cells on more flexible sub

strates."
According to Lee, several com
paniesâ€” both within and outside
the solar technology industry
have approached the team in the
hope of collaboration.
"They want to apply our method
to attach the solar cells on the sur
face of cars and boats unusual
applications of solar cells," Lee
said.
Zheng said that interested cus
tomers have also contacted the re
searchers about when the technolo
gy will reach the commercial mar
ket.
"The team receives a lot of in
quiries on where this product is
available," Zheng said. "But we
need more money to get it on the
market sooner. Our next step is to
scale this up, to apply the technolo
gy on a larger scale."
While the researchers ex
pressed satisfaction with their work
so far, they plan to expand the proj
ect by recruiting more people for
the research team and raising addi
tional funds.
"This is really a demonstration
applications will be decided lat
er," Wang said. "Right now we have
a good start."
