## Researchers create peel-and-stick solar cells 
### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of Stanford researchers has col
laborated with scientists at the Department
of Energy's National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) to produce the first suc
cessful demonstration of peel-and-stick solar
cells, which can be attached to almost any
surface or object.
Qi Wang, an NREL scientist who has
done extensive work with solar cells, first met
Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineer

ing Xiaolin Zheng at a conference last year.
The two decided to form a partnership after
realizing that peel-and-stick technology de
veloped at Stanford could be applied to solar
cells.
The research team also included NREL
research engineer William Nemeth, Dong
Rip Kim, an assistant professor in the divi
sion of mechanical engineering at Hanyang
University in Seoul, South Korea, and doctor
al students Chi Hwan Lee and In Sun Cho.
According to Zheng, the ability to attach
lighter and thinner solar cells to more sur

faces and objects, "from cars to light posts,"
will expand the energy source's potential us
es. The cells could even be affixed to items
like backpacks that are too small to accom
modate large and unwieldy solar panels.
While other researchers have previously
made flexible solar cells, the team's work is
unique for the cells' creation on a nickel-sili
con wafer, from which the cells are then
peeled off when dipped in water. The wafer
can subsequently be reused to fabricate new
