# Economics major sees reforms
## Changes include track system, consolidation 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an effort to combat an ongoing trend of
diminishing student interest, the Department
of Economics will implement a set of sweep
ing curricular changes next year.
The reforms, which were based on student
recommendations, will include the consolida
tion of Econ 1A and Econ IB into one intro
ductory class, the creation of a flexible track
system and the fostering of initiatives meant
to foster a sense of community among eco
nomics majors.
Peter Klenow Ph.D. '9l, director of under
graduate studies for the economics depart
ment, attributed the decreasing number of
students pursuing economics majors to the
impact of the global financial crisis and in
creases in other majors' popularity. Over the
past five years, the graduating class of eco
nomics majors has shrunk from about 150 to
100.
"One possibility is fewer jobs for econ
grads in the wake of the global financial cri
sis," Klenow wrote in a statement. "Over the
same period, public policy rose by about 15
grads. The major that really stands out as
having expanded, however, is computer sci
ence, which went from around 100 to over 250
grads in 2012."
Greater freedom and community
The department's Undergraduate Policy
Committee (UPC) first started an exit survey
of graduating majors two years ago, in an ef
fort to solicit feedback on ways of redesigning
the major. Survey responses focused on en
couraging greater flexibility within prerequi
site classes in order to allow students to take
more field courses.
Allen Xu 'l5, an economics major, noted
that it currently takes about two years to fin
ish the major's core classes.
"Before that it's pretty hard to take elec
tive field courses. Traditionally, the econ de
partment is pretty strict about not breaking
prereqs," Xu said.
Xu described the consolidation of Econ 1A
and Econ IB into one class as indicative of
some progress.
"This frees us a little bit, not a whole lot,
but I think it's in the right direction," Xu said.
Frank Wolak, professor of economics, em
phasized the value of the current system of
core classes in fostering students' ability to
think like economists.
"I think for the most part students see it as
