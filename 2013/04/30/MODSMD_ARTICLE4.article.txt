# Economics major sees reforms
## Changes include track system, consolidation 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an effort to combat an ongoing trend of
diminishing student interest, the Department
of Economics will implement a set of sweep
ing curricular changes next year.
The reforms, which were based on student
recommendations, will include the consolida
tion of Econ 1A and Econ IB into one intro
ductory class, the creation of a flexible track
system and the fostering of initiatives meant
to foster a sense of community among eco
nomics majors.
Peter Klenow Ph.D. '9l, director of under
graduate studies for the economics depart
ment, attributed the decreasing number of
students pursuing economics majors to the
impact of the global financial crisis and in
creases in other majors' popularity. Over the
past five years, the graduating class of eco
nomics majors has shrunk from about 150 to
100.
"One possibility is fewer jobs for econ
grads in the wake of the global financial cri
sis," Klenow wrote in a statement. "Over the
same period, public policy rose by about 15
grads. The major that really stands out as
having expanded, however, is computer sci
ence, which went from around 100 to over 250
grads in 2012."
Greater freedom and community
The department's Undergraduate Policy
Committee (UPC) first started an exit survey
of graduating majors two years ago, in an ef
fort to solicit feedback on ways of redesigning
the major. Survey responses focused on en
couraging greater flexibility within prerequi
site classes in order to allow students to take
more field courses.
Allen Xu 'l5, an economics major, noted
that it currently takes about two years to fin
ish the major's core classes.
"Before that it's pretty hard to take elec
tive field courses. Traditionally, the econ de
partment is pretty strict about not breaking
prereqs," Xu said.
Xu described the consolidation of Econ 1A
and Econ IB into one class as indicative of
some progress.
"This frees us a little bit, not a whole lot,
but I think it's in the right direction," Xu said.
Frank Wolak, professor of economics, em
phasized the value of the current system of
core classes in fostering students' ability to
think like economists.
"I think for the most part students see it as
'Okay, there is Econ 50 and
51 this is pretty much ap
plied mathematics,"' Wolak
said. "Our view is that this is
more like the language you
need to be able to learn and to
discipline yourself in terms of
thinking like an economist."
Under the reformed ma
jor, the department will also
offer Econ in the News, a
one-unit spring quarter class
aimed at demonstrating eco
nomics' application in the re
al world.
"The idea is to try to bring
a closer connection between
the world at large and the po
tential careers that student
might have," Wolak said.
As students move beyond
introductory courses, they
will also be able to pursue
different categories of fields
courses, based on individual
interests, through a track
system.
"In the focus groups last
year, students spoke often
about how econ majors have
diverse interests," Klenow
wrote. "They suggested we
provide more guidance and
customization."
Following the focus group's
discussions, UPC exit sur

veys found that most gradu
ating seniors would have pre
ferred the track system.
"As a freshman, I fol
lowed the mainstream cours
es but I didn't know what
they meant and what I would
be doing with them," Xu
said. "Now, you can look
ahead, saying 'I want to fo
cus on finance or I want to
focus on development and
strategy.'"
The new track system
groups students into six
tracks: policy, international
and development, finance,
strategy, research and be
havioral.
"They are voluntary for
now, partly to avoid transition
issues," Klenow wrote. "If our
students urge us to make
them more formal in the fu
ture, we will likely do so."
Students' ability to spe
cialize within a track may al
so lead to overlaps with oth
er majors such as public pol
icy or international rela
tions.
"One of them [the tracks]
is policy and that will overlap
considerably with the public
policy program's curricu
lum," noted Bruce Owen
Ph.D. '7O, professor in public
policy. "That means students
who are interested both the
program and public policy
will have a harder choice be
tween the two programs."

According to Sara Bascetta-
Bohn, student services officer
for the international rela
tions program, the program
has yet to make any final de
cisions regarding to any
changes in its major require
ments.
The final component of
the reform aims to build a
stronger community among
current economics majors
while cultivating connections
with graduated alumni.
"Starting next year we
plan to have about 10 events
a year to bring back alumni
to talk about their experi
ences and insights in busi
ness, policy, service and oth
er areas," Klenow wrote.
As part of the initiative,
the Stanford Institute for
Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR) will extend invita
tions for policy events to eco
nomics majors.
"Ultimately, I think the
changes are great because it
gives young students more
insight past Econ 1 into what
they can study in the econ
major," said Rajiv Suresh
'l5, an economics major. "It's
really great to see that the
department is responding to
students' suggestions and
taking what we think into ac
count."
