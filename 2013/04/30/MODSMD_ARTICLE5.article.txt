## Stanford+Connects launches in Arizona 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford+Connects, a four-year
outreach initiative launched by the
Stanford Alumni Association, re
cently kicked off an 18-city event
tour as part of an effort to bring
University content and connections
to alumni communities worldwide.
The tour's first event, which
took place in Scottsdale, Ariz., on
April 20, featured a range of Stan
ford faculty and alumni speakers,
including President John Hennessy
and former U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor '5O
LLB '52.
Approximately 300 alumni at
tended the five-hour event, which
was hosted by Dan Klein '9O, a lec
turer in the drama department and
at the Graduate School of Business
(GSB).
Participants listened to 10-
minute micro-lectures, which Klein
compared to TED talks, before at
tending one of four in-depth semi
nars led by Professor of Law Hank
Greely '74, Professor of Surgery
Jill Helms, Professor Emerita of
Art History Wanda Corn and Klein.
The event also featured a Q&A

session with Hennessy and a dis
cussion between O'Connor and cur
rent Law School dean Elizabeth
Magill. Hennessy will attend all of
the Stanford+Connects events
over the next four years, traveling
to cities around the world including
Paris, New York, Shanghai, Tokyo
and Seoul, South Korea.
"We're not fundraising, we're
friend-raising," Klein said about
the Stanford+Connects tour. "It's
about reconnecting people to Stan
ford, reminding them what they
value in it and letting them know
what's going on today."
Klein, who led a seminar about
improvisation, has participated in
events for the Alumni Association
before. He became involved with
Stanford+Connects last year after
he was invited to a discussion about
"innovative new ways" to engage
alumni and help them reconnect
with the Stanford community.
"I talked to some younger alum
ni and they said, 'The price is kind
of amazing for everything we get.
We wanted to hear all the talks. It
was really fun to interact with peo
ple and be here at the hotel,"' Klein

said. "They seemed to all
have really positive experi
ences."
The Stanford+Connects
initiative also includes a web
component, where alumni
can view Stanford-related
content including articles,
social media postings and
videos. The website will soon
host live webcasts of Stan
ford lectures and events.
"Stanford+Connects, as
the name would suggest, is
all about connection with
ideas, with fellow alumni and
with the University," wrote
Howard Wolf 'BO, president
of the Alumni Association, in
a statement. "Quite simply,
Stanford+Connects will
bring the best of Stanford to
alumni around the world
over the next four years in
person and online."
According to Wolf, Stan
ford's "top faculty" will ap
pear at Stanford+Connects
events. Different faculty
members will be selected for
each city based on online
surveys from alumni about
topics that they would like to
learn more about.
Wolf said that cities were
chosen for the tour based on
several factors, such as the
size and growth of the alum
ni population in certain areas
and the length of time since

the Alumni Association last
visited the region.
The next event, which
will take place in Minneapo
lis, Minn., in May, will fea
ture lectures by Dean of Un
dergraduate Admission
Richard Shaw, Professor of
Environmental Earth Sys
tem Science Rosamond Nay
lor Ph.D. 'B9, Professor of
English Elaine Treharne
and Executive Director of
the Stanford Technology
Ventures Program Tina
Seelig Ph.D. 'B5.
Wolf said that while the
Alumni Association has pre
viously hosted a variety of
outreach projects, he be
lieves Stanford+Connects is
unique in its "use of technol
ogy both at the events and
online," citing the use of
iClickers to allow alumni to
answer questions during the
faculty sessions as one ex
ample of technology's inte
gration.
"Stanford+Connects is a
more interactive outreach
program than many of the
past," he wrote. "This is our
attempt to mimic what is
happening in many class
rooms today on campus,
where classrooms are being
flipped and [lntroductory
Seminars] are some of the
most popular courses at
Stanford."
Corn, who said that she
has participated in many
alumni lectures in the past,
agreed that the
Stanford+Connects event

"had more variety and was
faster-paced" than other
alumni meetings.

After the Arizona alumni
gathering expressed interest
in learning more about con
temporary art, Corn was in
vited to speak about the fu
ture of museums. She also
held a seminar titled "Dress
ing Modern: Georgia O'Ke
effe and Her Clothes."
"I would have loved to
have gone to any one of the
other three breakout semi
nars but I had to give my
own," Corn said. "I found
from talking to the alumni
that they were pleased. They
felt a little tugged, they said,
as to which direction to go
for the seminars because
they found it all so interest
ing."
Six student ambassadors,
who also spoke to alumni
about their Stanford experi
ence, assisted the speakers
and presenters. Klein, who
brought two students from
the Stanford Improvisers,
an improvisation troupe that
he coaches, said that both he
and his students enjoyed at
tending the event.
"I loved it. It was a little
bit stressful, there were 300
strangers in the audience,
but it was really nicely put
together and it was exciting
and it was a neat location,"
he said. "It was fun to get to
do."

compared to TED talks, before at
tending one of four in-depth semi
nars led by Professor of Law Hank
Greely '74, Professor of Surgery
Jill Helms, Professor Emerita of
Art History Wanda Corn and Klein.
The event also featured a Q&A

session with Hennessy and a dis
cussion between O'Connor and cur
rent Law School dean Elizabeth
Magill. Hennessy will attend all of
the Stanford+Connects events
over the next four years, traveling
to cities around the world including
Paris, New York, Shanghai, Tokyo
and Seoul, South Korea.
"We're not fundraising, we're
friend-raising," Klein said about
the Stanford+Connects tour. "It's
about reconnecting people to Stan
ford, reminding them what they
value in it and letting them know
what's going on today."
Klein, who led a seminar about
improvisation, has participated in
events for the Alumni Association
before. He became involved with
Stanford+Connects last year after
he was invited to a discussion about
"innovative new ways" to engage
alumni and help them reconnect
with the Stanford community.
"I talked to some younger alum
ni and they said, 'The price is kind
of amazing for everything we get.
We wanted to hear all the talks. It
was really fun to interact with peo
ple and be here at the hotel,"' Klein

said. "They seemed to all
have really positive experi
ences."
The Stanford+Connects
initiative also includes a web
component, where alumni
can view Stanford-related
content including articles,
social media postings and
videos. The website will soon
host live webcasts of Stan
ford lectures and events.
"Stanford+Connects, as
the name would suggest, is
all about connection with
ideas, with fellow alumni and
with the University," wrote
Howard Wolf 'BO, president
of the Alumni Association, in
a statement. "Quite simply,
Stanford+Connects will
bring the best of Stanford to
alumni around the world
over the next four years in
person and online."
According to Wolf, Stan
ford's "top faculty" will ap
pear at Stanford+Connects
events. Different faculty
members will be selected for
each city based on online
surveys from alumni about
topics that they would like to
learn more about.
Wolf said that cities were
chosen for the tour based on
several factors, such as the
size and growth of the alum
ni population in certain areas
and the length of time since

the Alumni Association last
visited the region.
The next event, which
will take place in Minneapo

ture lectures by Dean of Un

Richard Shaw, Professor of
Environmental Earth Sys
tem Science Rosamond Nay
lor Ph.D. 'B9, Professor of
English Elaine Treharne
and Executive Director of
the Stanford Technology
Ventures Program Tina
Seelig Ph.D. 'B5.
Wolf said that while the
Alumni Association has pre
viously hosted a variety of
outreach projects, he be
lieves Stanford+Connects is
unique in its "use of technol
ogy both at the events and
online," citing the use of
iClickers to allow alumni to
answer questions during the
faculty sessions as one ex
ample of technology's inte
gration.
"Stanford+Connects is a
more interactive outreach
program than many of the
past," he wrote. "This is our
attempt to mimic what is
happening in many class
rooms today on campus,
where classrooms are being
flipped and [lntroductory
Seminars] are some of the
most popular courses at
Stanford."
Corn, who said that she
has participated in many
alumni lectures in the past,
agreed that the
Stanford+Connects event

"had more variety and was
faster-paced" than other
alumni meetings.

After the Arizona alumni
gathering expressed interest
in learning more about con
temporary art, Corn was in
vited to speak about the fu
ture of museums. She also
held a seminar titled "Dress
ing Modern: Georgia O'Ke
effe and Her Clothes."
"I would have loved to
have gone to any one of the
other three breakout semi
nars but I had to give my
own," Corn said. "I found
from talking to the alumni
that they were pleased. They
felt a little tugged, they said,
as to which direction to go
for the seminars because
they found it all so interest
ing."
Six student ambassadors,
who also spoke to alumni
about their Stanford experi
ence, assisted the speakers
and presenters. Klein, who
brought two students from
the Stanford Improvisers,
an improvisation troupe that
he coaches, said that both he
and his students enjoyed at
tending the event.
"I loved it. It was a little
bit stressful, there were 300
strangers in the audience,
but it was really nicely put
together and it was exciting
and it was a neat location,"
he said. "It was fun to get to
do."
