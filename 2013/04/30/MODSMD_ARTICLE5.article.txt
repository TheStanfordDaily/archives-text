## Stanford+Connects launches in Arizona 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford+Connects, a four-year
outreach initiative launched by the
Stanford Alumni Association, re
cently kicked off an 18-city event
tour as part of an effort to bring
University content and connections
to alumni communities worldwide.
The tour's first event, which
took place in Scottsdale, Ariz., on
April 20, featured a range of Stan
ford faculty and alumni speakers,
including President John Hennessy
and former U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor '5O
LLB '52.
Approximately 300 alumni at
tended the five-hour event, which
was hosted by Dan Klein '9O, a lec
turer in the drama department and
at the Graduate School of Business
(GSB).
Participants listened to 10-
minute micro-lectures, which Klein
compared to TED talks, before at
tending one of four in-depth semi
nars led by Professor of Law Hank
Greely '74, Professor of Surgery
Jill Helms, Professor Emerita of
Art History Wanda Corn and Klein.
The event also featured a Q&A

session with Hennessy and a dis
cussion between O'Connor and cur
rent Law School dean Elizabeth
Magill. Hennessy will attend all of
the Stanford+Connects events
over the next four years, traveling
to cities around the world including
Paris, New York, Shanghai, Tokyo
and Seoul, South Korea.
"We're not fundraising, we're
friend-raising," Klein said about
the Stanford+Connects tour. "It's
about reconnecting people to Stan
ford, reminding them what they
value in it and letting them know
what's going on today."
Klein, who led a seminar about
improvisation, has participated in
events for the Alumni Association
before. He became involved with
Stanford+Connects last year after
he was invited to a discussion about
"innovative new ways" to engage
alumni and help them reconnect
with the Stanford community.
"I talked to some younger alum
ni and they said, 'The price is kind
of amazing for everything we get.
We wanted to hear all the talks. It
was really fun to interact with peo
ple and be here at the hotel,"' Klein
