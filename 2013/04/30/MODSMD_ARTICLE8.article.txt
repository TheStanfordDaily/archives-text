# OPINIONS
## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Cheers to Jason Collins 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Much has already been writ
ten about former Stanford
basketball star and current
NBA free agent Jason Collins 'ol's
coming-out party and justifiably
so.
It's a historic moment for the
sporting world; with yesterday's
announcement, Collins becomes the
first male athlete in a major Ameri
can professional team sport to come
out as gay while still an active play
er. Collins' decision will provide a
positive role model for young ath
letes struggling to come out to
teammates, parents and friends; his
aggressive, physical style of play
should help debunk the malicious
myth that homosexuality makes
you weak and unathletic.
Observers from the sports world
to the heights of the punditocracy
have rushed the court of public
opinion like fans after a major win.
"We are proud he has assumed the
leadership mantle on this very im
portant issue," wrote NBA commis
sioner David Stern. "The time has
come. Maximum respect," tweeted
Steve Nash. And former President
Bill Clinton, whose daughter
Chelsea graduated from Stanford
alongside Collins in 2001, issued a
statement declaring that "Jason's
announcement today is an impor
tant moment for professional sports
and in the history of the LGBT
community."
In short, this is a pretty big deal.
But what most struck me about
Collins' story a story that, it
seems to me, mirrors the larger dy
namics at work in the national
struggle for marriage equality is
that he doesn't think it should be.
Collins wants everyone to know
that he's a basketball player first,
and everything else, including a gay,
African-American man, second. "I
don't let my race define me," wrote
Collins in his eloquent coming-out
article in Sports Illustrated "any
more than I want my sexual orien
tation to. I don't want to be labeled,
and I can't let someone else's label
define me."
When he looks in the mirror, he
doesn't see anybody else's blink
ered vision of what society thinks a
gay man should be; he sees a "7-
foot, 255-pound body" who led the
NBA in personal fouls during the
2004-05 season, who's "not afraid to
take on any opponent," who loves
"playing against the best," who
"once fouled a player so hard that
he had to leave the arena on a
stretcher."
With wry understatement,
Collins notes, "I go against the gay
stereotype." His is a world in which
how much you score during the
game matters a great deal more
than who you score with after it.
There is no gay basketball or
straight basketball; there are only
wins and losses. (Asked how they
would react to the coming-out of a
player on their favorite team, 73
percent of Sports Illustrated read
ers responded that it "would have
no impact.")
And Collins would be more than
happy if he got none of the attention
the press has given him for a com
ing-out he wishes weren't neces
sary. "I wish I wasn't the kid in the
classroom raising his hand and say
ing, 'l'm different.' If I had my way,
someone else would have already
done this. Nobody has," he explains,
"which is why I'm raising my hand."
Collins' inspirational story may

grab the biggest headlines and pre
occupy the most talking heads, of
any coming-out this year. It proba
bly should.
But it many respects, it's also
the exact same story we've been
hearing all year: a story played out
in city halls across the country, at
emotional demonstrations in front
of the Supreme Court, in living
rooms and at kitchen tables and in
all the quiet places the cameras nev
er capture and about which ink is
rarely, if ever, spilled.
I'm straight, so I don't pretend
to fully understand the inner dy
namics of a gay community of which
I have never been a part. All I know
is what I see, through a looking
glass darkly. And what I see are
people who want nothing more than
to be treated as normal, to peaceful
ly enter the mainstream of Ameri
can life and to be recognized for
what they do, not who they are born
to be.
The fight against Proposition 8
and DOMA is a fight for the great
est normalizing and stabilizing
force in American life: a (hopefully)
lifelong marriage between two peo
ple who care for each other. A victo
ry for marriage equality doesn't
look like the Armageddon of con
servative nightmare, with naked
orgies rampaging through the
streets while owners marry their
dogs and children wander about
parentless over the cursed terrain
of a vast moral wasteland. It does
n't look like special treatment,
identity politics or the demise of
traditional Christian ethics ("I take
the teachings of Jesus seriously,"
notes Collins, "particularly the ones
that touch on tolerance and under
standing.")
It looks like wedding dresses
and black tuxes. It looks like kids
drinking orange juice and hurriedly
spooning Golden Grahams before
rushing off to school. It looks like a
seven-foot-tall basketball player
getting sent off the court for a bru
tal foul. It looks like nothing more,
and nothing less, than the healthy
expression of this American life.
Cheers to Jason Collins for tak
ing one more step on the road to
nowhere new and nothing special
a place we should have gotten to a
long, long time ago.

Cheers to Jason Collins for tak
ing one more step on the road to
nowhere new and nothing special
a place we should have gotten to a
long, long time ago.

What struck me
most about Collins
story is that he
doesn't think it
should be one.

Much has already been writ
ten about former Stanford
basketball star and current
NBA free agent Jason Collins 'ol's
coming-out party and justifiably
so.
It's a historic moment for the
sporting world; with yesterday's
announcement, Collins becomes the
first male athlete in a major Ameri
can professional team sport to come
out as gay while still an active play
er. Collins' decision will provide a
positive role model for young ath
letes struggling to come out to
teammates, parents and friends; his
aggressive, physical style of play
should help debunk the malicious
myth that homosexuality makes
you weak and unathletic.
Observers from the sports world
to the heights of the punditocracy
have rushed the court of public
opinion like fans after a major win.
"We are proud he has assumed the
leadership mantle on this very im
portant issue," wrote NBA commis
sioner David Stern. "The time has
come. Maximum respect," tweeted
Steve Nash. And former President
Bill Clinton, whose daughter
Chelsea graduated from Stanford
alongside Collins in 2001, issued a
statement declaring that "Jason's
announcement today is an impor
tant moment for professional sports
and in the history of the LGBT
community."
In short, this is a pretty big deal.
But what most struck me about
Collins' story a story that, it
seems to me, mirrors the larger dy
namics at work in the national
struggle for marriage equality is
that he doesn't think it should be.
Collins wants everyone to know
that he's a basketball player first,
and everything else, including a gay,
African-American man, second. "I
don't let my race define me," wrote
Collins in his eloquent coming-out
article in Sports Illustrated "any
more than I want my sexual orien
tation to. I don't want to be labeled,
and I can't let someone else's label
define me."
When he looks in the mirror, he
doesn't see anybody else's blink
ered vision of what society thinks a
gay man should be; he sees a "7-
foot, 255-pound body" who led the
NBA in personal fouls during the
2004-05 season, who's "not afraid to
take on any opponent," who loves
"playing against the best," who
"once fouled a player so hard that
he had to leave the arena on a
stretcher."
With wry understatement,
Collins notes, "I go against the gay
stereotype." His is a world in which
how much you score during the
game matters a great deal more
than who you score with after it.
There is no gay basketball or
straight basketball; there are only
wins and losses. (Asked how they
would react to the coming-out of a
player on their favorite team, 73
percent of Sports Illustrated read
ers responded that it "would have
no impact.")
And Collins would be more than
happy if he got none of the attention
the press has given him for a com
ing-out he wishes weren't neces
sary. "I wish I wasn't the kid in the
classroom raising his hand and say
ing, 'l'm different.' If I had my way,
someone else would have already
done this. Nobody has," he explains,
"which is why I'm raising my hand."
Collins' inspirational story may

grab the biggest headlines and pre
occupy the most talking heads, of
any coming-out this year. It proba
bly should.
But it many respects, it's also
the exact same story we've been
hearing all year: a story played out
