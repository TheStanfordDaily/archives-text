# CARD ROUTS GAELS
## HUGE OPENER SETS UP WIN 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
For a Cardinal team in need of a
pick-me-up after a sweep at the
hands of the Oregon Ducks in Eu
gene, a weeknight matchup against
the nonconference Saint Mary's
Gaels was just what the doctor or
dered. The No. 25 Cardinal (24-15,
9-9 Pac-12) roared back to life
against a shaky Saint Mary's (17-
27, 8-7 WCC) pitching staff and
jumped out to an early lead that it
never relinquished, cruising to a 9-

1 victory at home.
The events unfolded in a man
ner eerily reminiscent of the game
against San Jose State a week ago.
In that contest, the Cardinal put up
nine runs the first inning and
chased the Spartan starter before
he recorded a single out.

Senior starting pitcher Kelsey
Outram was the unfortunate victim
of this week's first-inning outburst
by the Cardinal offense. Outram,
like San Jose State's Daniel Chavez
before him, did not record an out as
the first five Stanford hitters all
reached base against him before he

was pulled in favor of freshman
Gary Cornish.
One of those first five hitters
was junior first baseman Brian Ra
gira, who continued his torrid hit
ting with a huge three-run home
run to left his team-leading
eighth of the season that put the
Cardinal up 3-0 early.
Even after the pitching change,
the hit barrage continued as sopho
more third baseman Alex Blandino
and junior catcher Brant Whiting
each smashed RBI singles to in
crease the lead to 5-0 after only an
inning of play.
That was part of a 4-for-4 day
for Whiting at the plate, who raised
his batting average to a team-best
.405 with his continued hot hitting.
"I'm just seeing the ball pretty
well right now, getting good pitches
to hit and putting good swings on
them," said Whiting. "I credit that
a lot to the coaching here, you know,
being able to work on it every day."
The Gaels' bats, on the other
hand, never materialized against a
Stanford pitching staff that suf
fered from control issues at times
but was largely dominant. Sopho
more John Hochstatter, making his
first start after a hotly contested
suspension for hitting a batter,
pitched three sparkling innings be
fore laboring through a fourth in
ning plagued by problems getting
the ball into the strike zone.
In that fourth inning, Hochstat
ter hit a batter and walked two oth
ers, including one with the bases
loaded, to force in a run. That run
proved to be the only one that the
Gaels' hitters could muster
throughout the whole contest.
"I think he's feeling really good
out there," Whiting said about
Hochstatter. "He was looking really
good tonight, hitting his spots real
ly well, throwing all four of his
pitches for strikes. It was huge for
him, having a successful outing af
ter four games off, basically. We're
going to need him this next week

end [at Arizona State], so it was re
ally good seeing that out of him."
Stanford was able to tack on
four more runs for good measure in
the home half of the third inning
when senior designated hitter
Justin Ringo, who has been ex
tremely successful out of the lead
off spot, added two more RBI with
a deep double to right to bring his
total to 30, good for second on the
team.
Junior right fielder Austin Wil
son provided the rest of the scoring
with a two-run single that looked to
be a harmless, inning-ending
ground ball to second base but took
a bad hop and eluded Saint Mary's
sophomore second baseman Darian
Ramage as it bounced into right
field.
After the eventful third inning,
however, the Stanford offense went
cold, knocking only two more base
hits. Freshman righty Jacob Yaldez
entered the game for the Gaels
with two outs in the third and was
lights-out over 4.1 scoreless innings
in which he scattered only three
hits.
However, Saint Mary's was sim
ply unable to play catch-up as
freshman Bobby Zarubin hurled
three scoreless innings before giv
ing way to the bullpen, which closed
out the game in a relatively quiet
manner.
This was a victory that the Car
dinal desperately needed to regain
its momentum heading into a
tough, do-or-die series against Ari
zona State (28-12-1, 11-7 Pac-12),
one of the toughest teams in the
conference.
"It's real good getting this win,
kind of getting that sour taste out
of our mouth [after the Oregon se
ries]," said Whiting. "It doesn't
matter what the team is, a win's a
win. It's just good that we were
able to swing the bats tonight."
