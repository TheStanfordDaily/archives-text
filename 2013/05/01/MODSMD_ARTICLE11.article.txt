# SETTING UP ON THE FARM

### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
When freshmen James Shaw
and Josef Ctvrtlik stepped
onto Stanford's campus for
the first time this fall, they
immediately felt a great burden of respon
sibility. The two were new members of the
Stanford men's volleyball team, and they
had big roles to play.
For one, with last year's setter Evan
Barry 'l2 lost to graduation and no setters
left on the roster, Shaw and Ctvrtlik were
both expected to play large parts in leading
the Stanford offense. It was heavy respon
sibility for players yet to experience the
pressure of college volleyball.
Redshirt sophomore opposite Daniel
TUblin commented on the spot that they
were immediately shoved into, stating that
"in their roles as the only two setters, Shaw

and Ctvrtlik had to mature quickly to not
only learn the tempo and rhythm of the of
fense, but also lead the other five older guys
when things were not running smoothly."
This was certainly a giant task to hand to
freshmen untested at that level of play.
Secondly Shaw and Ctvrtlik had to fol
low some big footsteps. The previous two
key Stanford setters were Barry and Kawi
ka Shoji 'lO, legends who both achieved Ail-
American status and are currently playing
in professional leagues overseas.
Lastly, both players come from impres
sive volleyball pedigree. Shaw's father,
Don, is a former Stanford men's and
women's volleyball coach who led Stanford
to four national championships.
Not to be outdone, Ctvrtlik's father is
one of the greatest volleyball players of all
time. Bob Ctvrtlik was a two-time most
