# SETTING UP ON THE FARM
## 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
When freshmen James Shaw
and Josef Ctvrtlik stepped
onto Stanford's campus for
the first time this fall, they
immediately felt a great burden of respon
sibility. The two were new members of the
Stanford men's volleyball team, and they
had big roles to play.
For one, with last year's setter Evan
Barry 'l2 lost to graduation and no setters
left on the roster, Shaw and Ctvrtlik were
both expected to play large parts in leading
the Stanford offense. It was heavy respon
sibility for players yet to experience the
pressure of college volleyball.
Redshirt sophomore opposite Daniel
TUblin commented on the spot that they
were immediately shoved into, stating that
"in their roles as the only two setters, Shaw

and Ctvrtlik had to mature quickly to not
only learn the tempo and rhythm of the of
fense, but also lead the other five older guys
when things were not running smoothly."
This was certainly a giant task to hand to
freshmen untested at that level of play.
Secondly Shaw and Ctvrtlik had to fol
low some big footsteps. The previous two
key Stanford setters were Barry and Kawi
ka Shoji 'lO, legends who both achieved Ail-
American status and are currently playing
in professional leagues overseas.
Lastly, both players come from impres
sive volleyball pedigree. Shaw's father,
Don, is a former Stanford men's and
women's volleyball coach who led Stanford
to four national championships.
Not to be outdone, Ctvrtlik's father is
one of the greatest volleyball players of all
time. Bob Ctvrtlik was a two-time most

valuable player in the world,
as well as a former Olympian.
Ctvrtlik appeared in three
Olympics, starting in the
team that captured gold in
1988, and then serving as
team captain for the next two
Games, taking bronze in
1992.
Even the jersey numbers
inherited by the two carried
significant meaning, as
Ctvrtlik received four-time
Ail-American Erik Shoji's
No. 1, while Shaw was given
Stanford's all-time block
leader Gus Ellis' No. 3.
With these backgrounds
in place, the two faced great
expectations the second they
walked into Maples Pavilion.
At first, both recognized that
they were facing unique tri
als that were unlike anything
they had seen at previous lev
els of competition.
Ctvrtlik stated that "the
level of setting in college is a
lot quicker than in high
school, and all the hitters hit
at a much higher spot." As
such, both setters had to ad
just their game quickly to
adapt to a completely new
style of play.
At the same time, Shaw
faced another distinct chal
lenge in that he functioned as
both an outside hitter and
setter on his club and high
school teams, and thus had to
face the challenge of becom
ing solely a setter. This tran
sition was tough for him, but
ultimately he felt as though
"it was one that worked out
well for [him] and for [his] fu
ture as a volleyball player."
Neither Shaw nor Ctvrt
lik shied away from the chal
lenge. While, in Shaw's
words, "becoming an MPSF
caliber player is not easy
[and] being a freshman setter
is even more difficult," both
worked tirelessly to step up
to the plate in their freshman
campaign.
From their debut appear
ances, it was clear that both
were able to adjust to the
new setting. Shaw started
Stanford's first game of the
season with authority, post
ing 38 assists, seven digs and
six kills on eight attempts.
He followed this with 46 as

sists and 10 digs the next
night, for his first collegiate
double-double.
Ctvrtlik got his chance to
shine in the next match, en
tering for the final two sets
and playing impressively,
posting 17 assists and seven
digs, both match-highs, and
even recording a block de
spite standing at just six-foot
one.
Even so, both Ctvrtlik and
Shaw felt as though there
were improvements that
could be made to bring their
games to the next level. A
good portion of this was sim
ply realized through the pas
sage of time. With more time
to adjust not only to the style
of college volleyball, but also
the tendencies of the new
teammates they were playing
with, both were able to make
impressive strides.
Ctvrtlik, for example,
commented that he definitely
saw a distinct improvement
in his game as "[he] became
more comfortable with the

rate of play, as well as bet
tered [his] relationship with
[the] team."
Later in the season,
Ctvrtlik would be given his
first chance to start and
seized it, putting up 33 as
sists, eight digs, three blocks
in leading Stanford to a 3-0
victory over UC-San Diego.
Ultimately, even if it was a
slight down season for the
Cardinal, both freshmen left
fans and teammates confi
dent of their successes in the
future. Shaw proved himself
as a worthy inheritor to the
starting setter job, as his
10.48 assists per game placed
him in the top five in the
MPSF, and his overall strong
play earned him a spot on the
MPSF All-Freshman Team.
These honors were not
enough for him, however, as
he has lofty goals in sight. He
stated that he would love to
see his team "grow, challenge
each other and keep each
other accountable as a fami
ly" while on a competitive
level win the MPSF regular
season title and compete for
the national championship.
At the same time, he will
not rest until he has "made
[himself] into the best setter
in the country." While this is
certainly a lofty goal, it is def
initely in reach. Rest assured,
he will be pushed the whole
way by his teammate, friend
and fellow competitor, Ctvrt
lik. The two have certainly
earned their place as leaders
on the Stanford team, and
they, along with the rest of
their stellar freshman class,
will be sure that the Cardinal
will be a force to be reckoned
with in the MPSF for years
to come.

spite standing at just six-foot
one.
Even so, both Ctvrtlik and
Shaw felt as though there
were improvements that
could be made to bring their
games to the next level. A
good portion of this was sim
ply realized through the pas
sage of time. With more time
to adjust not only to the style
of college volleyball, but also
the tendencies of the new
teammates they were playing
with, both were able to make
impressive strides.
Ctvrtlik, for example,
commented that he definitely
saw a distinct improvement
in his game as "[he] became
more comfortable with the

rate of play, as well as bet
tered [his] relationship with
[the] team."
Later in the season,
Ctvrtlik would be given his
first chance to start and
seized it, putting up 33 as
sists, eight digs, three blocks
in leading Stanford to a 3-0
victory over UC-San Diego.
Ultimately, even if it was a
slight down season for the
Cardinal, both freshmen left
fans and teammates confi
dent of their successes in the
future. Shaw proved himself
as a worthy inheritor to the
starting setter job, as his
10.48 assists per game placed
him in the top five in the
MPSF, and his overall strong
play earned him a spot on the
MPSF All-Freshman Team.
These honors were not
enough for him, however, as
he has lofty goals in sight. He
stated that he would love to
see his team "grow, challenge
each other and keep each
other accountable as a fami
ly" while on a competitive
level win the MPSF regular
season title and compete for
the national championship.
At the same time, he will
not rest until he has "made
[himself] into the best setter
in the country." While this is
certainly a lofty goal, it is def
initely in reach. Rest assured,
he will be pushed the whole
way by his teammate, friend
and fellow competitor, Ctvrt
lik. The two have certainly
earned their place as leaders
on the Stanford team, and
they, along with the rest of
their stellar freshman class,
will be sure that the Cardinal
will be a force to be reckoned
with in the MPSF for years
to come.

Freshman Josef Ctvrtlik
(above) impressed with 33
assists, eight digs and three
blocks to lead Stanford past
UC-San Diego 3-0 in his
first collegiate start back in
early February.
When freshmen James Shaw
and Josef Ctvrtlik stepped
onto Stanford's campus for
the first time this fall, they
immediately felt a great burden of respon
sibility. The two were new members of the
Stanford men's volleyball team, and they
had big roles to play.
For one, with last year's setter Evan
Barry 'l2 lost to graduation and no setters
left on the roster, Shaw and Ctvrtlik were
both expected to play large parts in leading
the Stanford offense. It was heavy respon
sibility for players yet to experience the
pressure of college volleyball.
Redshirt sophomore opposite Daniel
TUblin commented on the spot that they
were immediately shoved into, stating that
"in their roles as the only two setters, Shaw

and Ctvrtlik had to mature quickly to not
only learn the tempo and rhythm of the of
fense, but also lead the other five older guys
when things were not running smoothly."
This was certainly a giant task to hand to
freshmen untested at that level of play.
Secondly Shaw and Ctvrtlik had to fol
low some big footsteps. The previous two
key Stanford setters were Barry and Kawi
ka Shoji 'lO, legends who both achieved Ail-
American status and are currently playing
in professional leagues overseas.
Lastly, both players come from impres
sive volleyball pedigree. Shaw's father,
Don, is a former Stanford men's and
women's volleyball coach who led Stanford
to four national championships.
Not to be outdone, Ctvrtlik's father is
one of the greatest volleyball players of all
time. Bob Ctvrtlik was a two-time most

valuable player in the world,
as well as a former Olympian.
Ctvrtlik appeared in three
Olympics, starting in the
team that captured gold in
1988, and then serving as
team captain for the next two
Games, taking bronze in
1992.
Even the jersey numbers
inherited by the two carried
significant meaning, as
Ctvrtlik received four-time
Ail-American Erik Shoji's
No. 1, while Shaw was given
Stanford's all-time block
leader Gus Ellis' No. 3.
With these backgrounds
in place, the two faced great
expectations the second they
walked into Maples Pavilion.
At first, both recognized that
they were facing unique tri
als that were unlike anything
they had seen at previous lev
els of competition.
Ctvrtlik stated that "the
level of setting in college is a
lot quicker than in high
school, and all the hitters hit
at a much higher spot." As
such, both setters had to ad
just their game quickly to
adapt to a completely new
style of play.
At the same time, Shaw
faced another distinct chal
lenge in that he functioned as
both an outside hitter and
setter on his club and high
school teams, and thus had to
face the challenge of becom
ing solely a setter. This tran
sition was tough for him, but
ultimately he felt as though
"it was one that worked out
well for [him] and for [his] fu
ture as a volleyball player."
Neither Shaw nor Ctvrt
lik shied away from the chal
lenge. While, in Shaw's
words, "becoming an MPSF
caliber player is not easy
[and] being a freshman setter
is even more difficult," both
worked tirelessly to step up
to the plate in their freshman
campaign.
From their debut appear
ances, it was clear that both
were able to adjust to the
new setting. Shaw started
Stanford's first game of the
season with authority, post
ing 38 assists, seven digs and
six kills on eight attempts.
He followed this with 46 as

sists and 10 digs the next
night, for his first collegiate
double-double.
Ctvrtlik got his chance to
shine in the next match, en
tering for the final two sets
and playing impressively,
posting 17 assists and seven
digs, both match-highs, and
even recording a block de
spite standing at just six-foot
one.
