# Something for soccer fans to chew on
## 
### Tom Taylor 
It's hard to ever be truly unbi
ased as a sports fan. Decisions
by referees that help your
team are usually correct; deci
sions that hurt it are often
wrong, or at least questionable.
Sometimes, though, a player man
ages to do something so utterly stu
pid that only the most delusional can't
agree.

A little over a week ago, Liveipool
striker Luis Suarez was caught on
camera biting yes, biting
Chelsea defender Branislav
Ivanovic during a contest between
their two teams. Though unpun
ished during the game, the English
Football Association took it upon it
self to review the incident in the en
suing days and subsequently
banned Suarez for 10 matches, a
punishment that will keep him out
of action not just this season, but
for a hefty chunk of the start of the
next, too.
In case you're not familiar with
the name Suarez, you might re
member him as the Uruguayan
player who infamously crushed
Ghana's dreams of making it to the
semifinals of the 2010 World Cup
by keeping Dominic Adiyiah's
header out of the net with his hand.
His rap sheet, though, is longer and
much more damning than that. He
has already served a seven-match
ban also for biting from his
time at Ajax, an eight-match ban
for racially abusing Manchester
United defender Patrice Evra and
a one-match ban for making an
abusive gesture towards Fulham
fans yeah, he's not exactly a role
model.
To their credit, many Liverpool
fans, including the official support
ers club, came out in support of the
FA's decision. Suarez may have
been the club's top scorer over the
last year, but any number of goals
doesn't make it ok to behave like a
naughty first grader.
The club, though, has taken a
rather different approach, express
ing shock and disappointment over
the severity of the punishment.
"If I had more players of a simi
lar mentality, we would be in a dif
ferent position," said manager
Brendan Rodgers, referring to the
team's current seventh-place posi
tion in the league standings and
Suarez's goal-scoring abilities, not
his taste for human flesh. "He has
not let me down one bit."
Now I understand that Rodgers
has a responsibility to stand up for
his players, but he also has the re
sponsibility to keep them in line, to
ensure they play the game and
don't constantly get banned for
their behavior. And ultimately the
buck for everything that happens
on and off the field stops with
Rodgers. Turning a blind eye does
not make you a strong manager,
nor does criticizing a player make
you disloyal.
Is Suarez's punishment harsh?
Was the FA probably influenced by
his troubled reputation? And does a
lengthy ban fail to address the root
causes for why he would bite some
one? Yes, yes and yes. But it is still
unquestionably the correct deci
sion.
Suarez has clearly earned his
reputation, and a lighter touch this
time would only send the wrong
message. Fines have little impact
on star soccer players because
they don't make much of a dent in
their huge salaries. The only real
punishment is a ban, not just
stopping them from playing the
game they love, but even making
repeat offenders less attractive to
big clubs; there is little point in
signing a talented player who is
just going to spend his career on
the bench.
Whether this will work with
Suarez is unclear. It's hard to imag
ine the bite was premeditated if
so he's far from the smartest cook
ie. Whether the referees saw it or
not, the television cameras were
clearly going to. And if it really was
a spur-of-the-moment reaction, sit
ting out for a few games probably
won't, on its own, change much
though his opponents at least won't
be in danger of being bitten for the
next few months.
If he can be changed, that is not
the FA's responsibility but that of
Liverpool and Suarez himself. In
stead of laying the blame on the
punishment, they could both do
everything that they can to ensure
he doesn't spend any more time on
