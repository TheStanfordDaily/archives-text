# OPINIONS
## The 						Woes of Our ProFros 
### Uttara Sivaram 
Admit Weekend is the only
weekend in the entire year
during which I deeply, deeply
sympathize with high school stu
dents. Indeed, I always marvel at
the staggering number of admits
who decide to commit after such a
harrowing few days. I'd like to at
tribute it to the weather, which is so
consistently beautiful that it makes a
terrible experience like getting lost
in Huang just a little bit less painful.
But I suspect there's more to it.
I'm actually not criticizing the
general idea or organization of Ad
mit Weekend heck, I think
spending a few days on campus is
what any prospective student needs
to do. But after my own experience
at Admit Weekend, coupled with the
conversations I had with some high
school students I met a few days
ago, I feel pretty confident that re
leasing 1,000 high school seniors in a
school that better resembles a sub
urb than a campus, armed only with
only a map, a packet of fairly irrele
vant academic seminars and a name
card as large as a piece of toast, is
just an awful idea.
I was lucky my brother was a
senior at Stanford at the time of my
Admit Weekend, so I typically had
an exit strategy when things went
south (except for when he ditched
me at Broc party so he could hang
out in Suites and made me go to his
Physics section so I could sign his
name on the roll call sheet). But dur
ing the daylight hours, I was on my
own on level footing with my oth

er hopelessly lost peers. Then again,
it may not have been all that level
while the rest of the admits enjoyed
the sunshine, I was busy locking
myself inside a stairwell in Encina,
trying to find a water fountain.
What made matters worse was
that I wholeheartedly believed I
had wandered into the Braun Mu
sic Hall because there was a huge
painting of an orchestra where I
was trapped. So when I called my
brother to let me out, he spent a
good hour trying to find me in
Braun while I played Bejeweled in
an emergency stairwell nearly a
quarter of a mile away.
This is the rhythm of Stanford
Admit Weekend. You get lost, make
friends, lose those friends and then
get lost again. To make matters
worse, you have people telling you
how amazing and exciting Stanford
is how fun the football games
are, how naked Rill Moon really is,
how cool it is to play ultimate Fris
bee in the Oval. Thing is, as an ex
hausted high school senior who
could probably get lost between the
bathroom and the lounge in an av
erage freshman dorm, all he or she
really wants to know is where the
nearest Starbucks is.
I used to think that my experi
ence in Admit Weekend was
unique. But after meeting a high
school girl who was in tears be
cause she had walked the length of
Junipero Serra trying to find Ju
nipero (which actually is kind of
logical, poor thing), I realize how

challenging it is to feel at home at a
massive place like Stanford, espe
cially on foot.
Thing is, students really do come
back for good. And I think that per
haps what makes Stanford so im
possibly intimidating also makes
Stanford incredibly inspiring. I
think that the kids who stay know
that someday, this large and terrify
ing place will be their home. They
won't be a Pro Fro, they won't have
a RoHo, and they'll probably live in
Flo Mo. In fact, most words will end
in an "o". They'll never again try to
get to Cantor by foot, and they'll
probably try to fake an injury at
some point in the hopes of getting a
golf cart for the quarter. They won't
be loud and embarrassing in Mem-
Chu anymore, and they'll never re
fer to buildings in the quad by num
ber. They won't go to Green for the
books, and the next time they go to
Hoover Tower will be when they get
dared to shotgun a beer at the top.
Spending a Saturday night in
Tresidder Oak Lounge will shortly
become an inside joke.
In summary, these high school
seniors go through Admit Weekend
wishing they hadn't canceled their
senior prom plans to get stuck in
the stairwell of what they thought
was a music hall. But they always
come back. I did! And thank good
ness for that.
