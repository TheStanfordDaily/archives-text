# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## Missed Meanings 
### Renée Donovan 
U"T "TT T"hile people are fairly
\/\J young and the musical
V V composition of their
lives is still in its opening bars, they
can go about writing it together and
sharing motifs ... but if they meet
when they are older ... their musi
cal compositions are more or less
complete, and every motif, every
object, every word means some
thing different to each of them."
I found this quote in Milan Kun
dera's "The Unbearable Lightness
of Being." It struck a chord be
cause it seemed to explain the rea
son for every misunderstanding
I've had in the last month. Maybe
all those misunderstandings
weren't due to clumsiness but to a
lack of shared language. A differ
ence in dialects, if you will.
I speak a language that com
prises every experience I have ever
had. It's not only the connotations
of words that are different from
anyone else's dialect, but the defini
tions themselves. For the most part
I get by just fine. I imagine that I
convey my meaning and that peo
ple understand me. The illusion is
sufficient in almost every scenario.
Until you bring in the big words.
Success. This one comes up a lot
at Stanford. For one person success
is working at a hedge fund and
making lots of money; for another it
means not having to rely on other
people; for a third success is bal
ancing work and mental health.
Success gets tied up in your par
ents' expectations, your own goals
for your future, the value that you
put on the results of your work or
the process of it. Some of these def
initions may overlap, but they cer
tainly don't convey the exact same
meaning. The phrase "I just want
to succeed" gets complicated.
Perfect. Perfect is a world in my
head where the vertical asymptote
can cross the axis. It is a world
where things are pure and excite
ment is unattenuated. To me per
fect has to do with an interior state
and I go crazy when I try to make
the exterior world resemble that in
terior state. To some of my friends
perfect means the mathematical
proof that shows that the asymp
tote can never reach the axis. For
them perfect is something that ex
ists in the outside world, a goal that
you can work toward. "That was
perfect" stops making sense.
Ambition. Ambition is stubborn
ly not accepting the answer "No."
For me it implies a productive com
petitiveness in the interest of per
sonal advancement. Ambition is
sharp and has a masochistic edge,
but it is attractive nonetheless. I
have friends for whom ambition
means something quite different.

For them it means arrogance, self
centeredness and an unwillingness
to compromise. Suddenly, "I wish
you would show more ambition"
gets muddied up as well.
Love. Love is why I cry when I
hear certain pieces of music. Love
is a deep nostalgic fondness for
someone you've grown up with.
Love is learning how to fight re
spectfully with someone else. Love
is feeling thrilled when you see
someone walking up to meet you.
All of these are valid. Yet none of
them are quite the same. No won
der the difficulty with things like,
"I'd love to," "I love you," or even,
"Hi, love."
I bring this up because I don't
have clear definitions for these
words. I take for granted the expe
riences that have shaped their defi
nitions for me, and expect those
definitions to be transparent to
everyone. I treat these words care
lessly, as though they were fungi
ble. I see now how absurd this ex
pectation is, how advanced the
theme of my musical composition
already is and how strange it must
sound to everyone except my fami
ly and my childhood friends.
At the risk of being overly ex
plicit, give your friends a window
into the context that shapes your
dialect. You'll give them a gift by
explaining. I'm not saying your mu
sical composition is complete by
college. Still, its themes may al
ready be in place, the tonic already
set when you shed light on the
opening bars that are already writ
ten, you can begin to build more
motifs with the people who enter
your life in a later variation.
