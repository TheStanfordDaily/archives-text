## JEFF FISHER PROFESSOR OF LAW & CO-DIRECTOR OF THE LAW SCHOOL'S SUPREME COURT LITIGATION CLINIC 
### ANGELA ZHANG 
Professor of Law Jeff Fisher is
the co-director of the Law School's
Supreme Court Litigation Clinic
and an expert on Supreme Court
practice and criminal procedure.
On April 17, Fisher argued Salinas
v. Texas for petitioner Genovevo
Salinas in front of the Court. The
Daily sat down with Fisher to talk
about Salinas, his legal career and
the experience of presenting an ar
gument to America's highest judi

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
did you first develop your interest
in Supreme Court practice and
criminal court procedure?
Jeff Fisher (JF): That's a big
question. I suppose through college

and growing up, the same way I de
veloped interest in the law: the im
portance of the way the law affects
people's lives. And the Supreme
Court, of course, is one of the most
important legal institutions in the
country.
TSD: How many cases have you ar
gued before the Court previously?
JF: Well, this is number 21.
TSD: How did you become in

JF: Through my work as co-di
rector of the Stanford Supreme
Court Litigation Clinic. What the
clinic does is, we offer pro bono
services in terms of student re
sources and faculty supervision to
help people who have cases that are
either in the Court or headed there,

that don't otherwise have the abili
ty to pay for top-flight Supreme
Court counsel.
We learned about the case after
the highest court in Texas decided
it. We called the local lawyers in
Houston and offered our assistance
to them, the client and his family,
and they accepted it.

TSD: Can you talk about the ba
sics of the case?
JF: The case is about the Fifth
Amendment right not to be com
pelled to be a witness against your
self, which in common vernacular is
the right to remain silent. And so
the question in this case is whether
somebody who's asked by the police
to do a voluntary interview before
