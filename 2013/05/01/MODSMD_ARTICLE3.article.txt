# Q&A
## JEFF FISHER PROFESSOR OF LAW & CO-DIRECTOR OF THE LAW SCHOOL'S SUPREME COURT LITIGATION CLINIC 
### ANGELA ZHANG 
Professor of Law Jeff Fisher is
the co-director of the Law School's
Supreme Court Litigation Clinic
and an expert on Supreme Court
practice and criminal procedure.
On April 17, Fisher argued Salinas
v. Texas for petitioner Genovevo
Salinas in front of the Court. The
Daily sat down with Fisher to talk
about Salinas, his legal career and
the experience of presenting an ar
gument to America's highest judi
cial body.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
did you first develop your interest
in Supreme Court practice and
criminal court procedure?
Jeff Fisher (JF): That's a big
question. I suppose through college

and growing up, the same way I de
veloped interest in the law: the im
portance of the way the law affects
people's lives. And the Supreme
Court, of course, is one of the most
important legal institutions in the
country.
TSD: How many cases have you ar
gued before the Court previously?
JF: Well, this is number 21.
TSD: How did you become in
volved with Salinas v. Texas?
JF: Through my work as co-di
rector of the Stanford Supreme
Court Litigation Clinic. What the
clinic does is, we offer pro bono
services in terms of student re
sources and faculty supervision to
help people who have cases that are
either in the Court or headed there,

that don't otherwise have the abili
ty to pay for top-flight Supreme
Court counsel.
We learned about the case after
the highest court in Texas decided
it. We called the local lawyers in
Houston and offered our assistance
to them, the client and his family,
and they accepted it.

TSD: Can you talk about the ba
sics of the case?
JF: The case is about the Fifth
Amendment right not to be com
pelled to be a witness against your
self, which in common vernacular is
the right to remain silent. And so
the question in this case is whether
somebody who's asked by the police
to do a voluntary interview before
he's under arrest has that
same right to remain silent
and is protected in legal pro
ceedings the same way as
somebody else who's under
arrest or already in the
courtroom.
TSD: What is the precedent
case law applicable here?
Would your argument re
quire an upheaval of that
precedent?
JF: No, we don't think it
requires any significant
change. You know, the rea
son the Supreme Court took
the case, which is consistent
with the reason they took
most cases, is because the
Supreme Court itself has
never answered this partic
ular question. And lower
courts across the country
lower federal and state
courts are divided as to
what the answer is.
TSD: You were presented
with a lot of hypotheticals
during the oral argu
ments. Were any of the hy
potheticals presented by
the judges surprising or
unexpected?
JF: I don't think this
time we got any that were
terribly surprising. When
we're developing our legal
argument and then prepar
ing to go to Washington and
present it, we spent a lot of
time in the clinic the stu
dents and I asking our
selves about all the different
various implications of our
position, and one way to test
that out is to be conjuring
up a lot of hypotheticals.
TSD: Which justice gave
you the hardest time?
JF: It depends. They're
all incredibly smart and in
credibly well-prepared. So,
I don't think there's any
particular justice I would
single out. You know, when
you're doing a criminal case
and representing a criminal
defendant... people like,
for example, Justice
[Samuel] Alito, who was a
former prosecutor [and] is
not just incredibly smart

but has a lot of personal ex
perience in the system, can
sometimes ask probing
questions. But he was rela
tively quiet in this case, and
many others asked ques
tions. So I wouldn't single
anyone out, really.

TSD: Do you have any in
teresting anecdotes from
the oral arguments?
JF: I think one moment
that we hope is beneficial
for us was when the lawyer
representing the state of
Texas was asked, "Well, if
[you] prevail, won't police
officers tell people that they
better not be silent, because
otherwise that's going to be
used against them?"
He resisted that and
said, "Oh, I don't think they
would do that. There'd be a
problem if they did."
I think he actually said
it'd be coercive if they did.
And so for us, that was a
telling moment in the argu
ment because the hypothet
ical is just an officer saying
the law that they're advo
cating, and if he's not willing
to defend it in practice, then
one hopes you start to ques
tion the correctness of their
position. But, we'll see if it
plays out that way or not.
TSD: What will be the im
plications of the ruling for
the criminal justice sys
tem?
JF: I think it has the po
tential to be an incredibly
important case, because, in
our country, police conduct
thousands of interviews a
day of witnesses and sus
pects ... who are not under
arrest. And the ground
rules for those interviews,
and whether or not some-

body has a sanctuary of si
lence, are enormously im
portant both to individual
rights and dignity, and to
how cases will get prosecut
ed and how police will act in
those interviews.

TSD: Have you ever ar
gued a case that you won
or lost unanimously?
JF: Yes and yes. The
unanimous cases are easier
to live with, because you
sort of feel like, "Well, not
much I could have done ei
ther way," whether you win
or lose.
It's the 5-4 decisions that
if you win, you're thrilled
with, and if you lose, you
spend a lot of time with
what-ifs.
TSD: What kind of atti
tude do you have going in
to an oral argument?
JF: You know, obviously
part of you is nervous. Sure,
I'm not as nervous as I was
the first time, but it's an in
timidating setting and
somewhat grand spectacle
on some levels ... part of
you is just trying to deal
with that.
But what I try to do is
have as much fun with it as I
can and be confident... and
enjoy this amazing opportu
nity to interact with the coun
try's highest jurists ... to
hear what's on their mind,
what they're concerned with,
and to try to help them in a
way.
It's not every day that an
ordinary person gets to go
up before the highest offi
cials in any branch of our
government and have that
kind of interaction. And so
it's kind of an incredible
privilege.

TSD: Do you ever try to tai
lor your argument to a par
ticular justice?
JF: Justice Brennan once
said, "The most important
rule in the Supreme Court is
how to count to five." So you
try to get five of the nine jus
tices to agree with you, and
you spend a lot of time think
ing about which individuals
are more likely to be persuad
ed by your position, and how
you might appeal to some jus
tices who might not be as in
tuitively persuaded by it.

TSD: And the decision
comes out?
JF: June, sometime in
June.

JEFF FISHER, PROFESSOR OF LAW
Professor of Law Jeff Fisher is
the co-director of the Law School's
Supreme Court Litigation Clinic
and an expert on Supreme Court
practice and criminal procedure.
On April 17, Fisher argued Salinas
v. Texas for petitioner Genovevo
Salinas in front of the Court. The
Daily sat down with Fisher to talk
about Salinas, his legal career and
the experience of presenting an ar
gument to America's highest judi
cial body.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
did you first develop your interest
in Supreme Court practice and
criminal court procedure?
Jeff Fisher (JF): That's a big
question. I suppose through college

and growing up, the same way I de
veloped interest in the law: the im
portance of the way the law affects
people's lives. And the Supreme
Court, of course, is one of the most
important legal institutions in the
country.
TSD: How many cases have you ar
gued before the Court previously?
JF: Well, this is number 21.
TSD: How did you become in
volved with Salinas v. Texas?
JF: Through my work as co-di
rector of the Stanford Supreme
Court Litigation Clinic. What the
clinic does is, we offer pro bono
services in terms of student re
sources and faculty supervision to
help people who have cases that are
either in the Court or headed there,

that don't otherwise have the abili
ty to pay for top-flight Supreme
Court counsel.
We learned about the case after
the highest court in Texas decided
it. We called the local lawyers in
Houston and offered our assistance
to them, the client and his family,
and they accepted it.

TSD: Can you talk about the ba
sics of the case?
JF: The case is about the Fifth
Amendment right not to be com
pelled to be a witness against your
self, which in common vernacular is
the right to remain silent. And so
the question in this case is whether
somebody who's asked by the police
to do a voluntary interview before
he's under arrest has that
same right to remain silent
and is protected in legal pro
ceedings the same way as
somebody else who's under
arrest or already in the
courtroom.
TSD: What is the precedent
case law applicable here?
Would your argument re
quire an upheaval of that
precedent?
JF: No, we don't think it
requires any significant
change. You know, the rea
son the Supreme Court took
the case, which is consistent
with the reason they took
most cases, is because the
Supreme Court itself has
never answered this partic
ular question. And lower
courts across the country
lower federal and state
courts are divided as to
what the answer is.
TSD: You were presented
with a lot of hypotheticals
during the oral argu
ments. Were any of the hy
potheticals presented by
the judges surprising or
unexpected?
JF: I don't think this
time we got any that were
terribly surprising. When
we're developing our legal
argument and then prepar
ing to go to Washington and
present it, we spent a lot of
time in the clinic the stu
dents and I asking our
selves about all the different
various implications of our
position, and one way to test
that out is to be conjuring
up a lot of hypotheticals.
TSD: Which justice gave
you the hardest time?
JF: It depends. They're
all incredibly smart and in
credibly well-prepared. So,
I don't think there's any
particular justice I would
single out. You know, when
you're doing a criminal case
and representing a criminal
defendant... people like,
for example, Justice
[Samuel] Alito, who was a
former prosecutor [and] is
not just incredibly smart

but has a lot of personal ex
perience in the system, can
sometimes ask probing
questions. But he was rela
tively quiet in this case, and
many others asked ques
tions. So I wouldn't single
anyone out, really.

TSD: Do you have any in
teresting anecdotes from
the oral arguments?
JF: I think one moment
that we hope is beneficial
for us was when the lawyer
representing the state of
Texas was asked, "Well, if
[you] prevail, won't police
officers tell people that they
better not be silent, because
otherwise that's going to be
used against them?"
He resisted that and
said, "Oh, I don't think they
would do that. There'd be a
problem if they did."
I think he actually said
it'd be coercive if they did.
And so for us, that was a
telling moment in the argu
ment because the hypothet
ical is just an officer saying
the law that they're advo
cating, and if he's not willing
to defend it in practice, then
one hopes you start to ques
tion the correctness of their
position. But, we'll see if it
plays out that way or not.
TSD: What will be the im
plications of the ruling for
the criminal justice sys
tem?
JF: I think it has the po
tential to be an incredibly
important case, because, in
our country, police conduct
thousands of interviews a
day of witnesses and sus
pects ... who are not under
arrest. And the ground
rules for those interviews,
and whether or not some-

body has a sanctuary of si
lence, are enormously im
portant both to individual
rights and dignity, and to
how cases will get prosecut
ed and how police will act in
those interviews.

TSD: Have you ever ar
gued a case that you won
or lost unanimously?
JF: Yes and yes. The
unanimous cases are easier
to live with, because you
sort of feel like, "Well, not
much I could have done ei
ther way," whether you win
or lose.
It's the 5-4 decisions that
if you win, you're thrilled
with, and if you lose, you
spend a lot of time with
what-ifs.
TSD: What kind of atti
tude do you have going in
to an oral argument?
JF: You know, obviously
part of you is nervous. Sure,
I'm not as nervous as I was
the first time, but it's an in
timidating setting and
somewhat grand spectacle
on some levels ... part of
you is just trying to deal
with that.
But what I try to do is
have as much fun with it as I
can and be confident... and
enjoy this amazing opportu
nity to interact with the coun
try's highest jurists ... to
hear what's on their mind,
what they're concerned with,
and to try to help them in a
way.
It's not every day that an
ordinary person gets to go
up before the highest offi
cials in any branch of our
government and have that
kind of interaction. And so
it's kind of an incredible
privilege.

TSD: Do you ever try to tai
lor your argument to a par
ticular justice?
JF: Justice Brennan once
said, "The most important
rule in the Supreme Court is
how to count to five." So you
try to get five of the nine jus
tices to agree with you, and
you spend a lot of time think
ing about which individuals
are more likely to be persuad
ed by your position, and how
you might appeal to some jus
tices who might not be as in
tuitively persuaded by it.
