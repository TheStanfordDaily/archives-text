# Senate leaves mixed legacy
## Body shapes minor projects, revision of sexual assault policy 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
As the 14th ASSU Undergrad
uate Senate leaves office, many of
the body's accomplishments are
some that a majority of students
may already take for granted.
The Senate finally completed
their website, which had been un
der construction for more than a
year, started live-tweeting during
meetings and approved every
funding request save one, reject
ing an application from FLiCKS,
a student group that shows
movies at University auditoriums,
because of a $9,900 request for of
ficer salaries.
However, FLiCKS successful
ly petitioned the student body and
received special fees while the
ASSU Legal Counseling Office,
which has been funded by special
fees for the last 20 years, fell 17
votes short of receiving money. In
a final flurry of activity at their
last meeting, senators decided to
fund the Legal Counseling Office
out of general fees reserves re
gardless.
"Special fees... is definitely a
really complex process," said
Christos Haveles 'l5, who became
chair of the Appropriations Com
mittee after former chair Nancy
Pham 'l4 left to study abroad in
Beijing this quarter.
The by-laws of the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate explicitly bar
senators from studying abroad
while in office, saying that sena
tors "shall remain on campus for
the duration of their term." Sena
tors that are not on campus are to
be "automatically expelled."

Small projects, lasting changes
Small projects undertaken by
this year's Senate include the

opening of a music practice room
in Stern Dining and the appropri
ation of more than $lOO,OOO to stu
dent groups as part of a concerted
effort to spend some of the $1.2
million of student money that the
ASSU has accrued from unspent
student group funds.
The 14th Senate's most endur
ing legacy may, however, be the
eventual passage of the Alterna
tive Review Process (ARP), a re
vised judicial procedure for cases
involving sexual assault. ASSU
action on the ARP had been de
layed since 2010, when the policy
was originally developed, unilat
erally revised and subsequently
implemented by the Office of the
President.
Senator Lauren Miller 'l5, co
chair of the ARP committee,
claimed that the urgency behind
the ARP allowed the passage of a
final bill. Miller's joint committee
sought to address student body
concerns about the revised policy,
though the final language would
include controversial provisions
like the establishment of the bur
den of proof as "preponderance of
evidence" rather than "beyond a
reasonable doubt."
Though Miller argued that the
final document was successful,
she noted that the committee
would have appreciated additional
input from the community.
"Ultimately, we would have
liked more student voices but the
fact is that we reached out multi
ple times and we got the respons
es that we did," she said. "There is
always room for improvement,
but I think it was a fantastic docu
ment that the [Board of Judicial
Affairs], Faculty Senate, the
[Graduate Student Council] and
the Senate were really hap
py with."
Some senators were less
effusive in their praise.
"It was a solid document
that was more fair to all par
ties involved in such cases
than its predecessor," said
ARP committee member Vi
raj Bindra 'l5. "There's still
more room for the dialogue

to continue."
No senators sought re
election this year, a trend
carried over from the previ
ous Senate. That lack of up
perclassmen representation
prompted the passage of a
constitutional amendment
backed by incoming ASSU
Executives Dan Ashton 'l4
and Billy Gallagher 'l4 that
would reserve a certain
number of Senate seats for
upperclassmen.
"I think one of our
biggest goals is re-legitimiz
ing the ASSU," Ashton said,

referencing efforts to moti
vate upperclassmen to join
an organization dominated
by rising sophomores. "[Out
going ASSU Executives]
Robbie [Zimbroff 'l2 M.A.
'l3] and Will [Wagstaff 'l2
M.A. 'l3] have done a great
job of turning around a ship
that probably wasn't in the
right direction, and I think
we can build off of that."
Even though Bindra ex
pressed some disillusion
ment with the Senate as an
institution, he voiced com
mitment to its broader goals.

"I think the thing that
I've realized most [this] year
is that the Senate is not the
vehicle of massive or institu
tional change that I expected
it to be when I was a [fresh
man]," he said. "Despite the
frustrations that arise...
there's a purposeful method
to the madness."

involving sexual assault. ASSU
action on the ARP had been de
layed since 2010, when the policy
was originally developed, unilat
erally revised and subsequently
implemented by the Office of the
President.
Senator Lauren Miller 'l5, co
chair of the ARP committee,
claimed that the urgency behind
the ARP allowed the passage of a
final bill. Miller's joint committee
sought to address student body
concerns about the revised policy,
though the final language would
include controversial provisions
like the establishment of the bur
den of proof as "preponderance of
evidence" rather than "beyond a
reasonable doubt."
Though Miller argued that the
final document was successful,
she noted that the committee
would have appreciated additional
input from the community.
"Ultimately, we would have
liked more student voices but the
fact is that we reached out multi
ple times and we got the respons
es that we did," she said. "There is
always room for improvement,
but I think it was a fantastic docu
ment that the [Board of Judicial
Affairs], Faculty Senate, the
[Graduate Student Council] and
the Senate were really hap
py with."
Some senators were less
effusive in their praise.
"It was a solid document
that was more fair to all par
ties involved in such cases
than its predecessor," said
ARP committee member Vi
raj Bindra 'l5. "There's still
more room for the dialogue

to continue."
No senators sought re
election this year, a trend
carried over from the previ
ous Senate. That lack of up
perclassmen representation
prompted the passage of a
constitutional amendment
backed by incoming ASSU
Executives Dan Ashton 'l4
and Billy Gallagher 'l4 that
would reserve a certain
number of Senate seats for
upperclassmen.
"I think one of our
biggest goals is re-legitimiz
ing the ASSU," Ashton said,

referencing efforts to moti
vate upperclassmen to join
an organization dominated
by rising sophomores. "[Out
going ASSU Executives]
Robbie [Zimbroff 'l2 M.A.
'l3] and Will [Wagstaff 'l2
M.A. 'l3] have done a great
job of turning around a ship
that probably wasn't in the
right direction, and I think
we can build off of that."
Even though Bindra ex
pressed some disillusion
ment with the Senate as an
institution, he voiced com
mitment to its broader goals.

"I think the thing that
I've realized most [this] year
is that the Senate is not the
vehicle of massive or institu
tional change that I expected
it to be when I was a [fresh
man]," he said. "Despite the
frustrations that arise...
there's a purposeful method
to the madness."
