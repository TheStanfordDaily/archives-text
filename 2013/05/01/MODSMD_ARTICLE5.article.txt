## Senate to fund student legal services ASSU general funds to make up Legal Counseling Offices special fees rejection 
### LUCY SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At its last meeting, the 14th ASSU Under
graduate Senate voted to fund the Legal Coun
seling Office (LCO) through general fees re
serves. The 15th ASSU Undergraduate Senate
was sworn in after the meeting's conclusion.
The LCO had previously fallen 17 votes
short of receiving funding on the special fees
ballot, the only group to be denied special fees
funding.
Prior to the transition, senators also con
firmed a Nominations Committee (NomCom)
bill nominating students to University com
mittees, with nine voting in favor and three ab
staining due to conflicts of interest with nomi
nees. NomCom co-chairs John Dodini 'l3 and
Jonathan York 'l3 said that they were general
ly satisfied with the interest expressed in Uni
versity committees.
"I am very confident in all the nominees,"
York said. "One disappointment is that we did
n't have the opportunity to appoint a male stu
dent to the Sexual Assault Advisory Board,
purely because we did not have an applicant."
A bill that proposed a $40,000 grant for the
LCO consumed almost an hour of debate. The
organization has been funded by special fees
for the past 20 years, and despite its rejection
on the spring ballot, Deputy Chair Garima
Sharma 'l5 proposed granting the LCO mon
ey from the ASSU buffer fund.
Senators eventually decided to allocate
funding from the ASSU's general fees re
serves, unspent funds previously earmarked
for student groups. Both the
general fees reserves and
the buffer funds are com
prised of student money.
Over the course of de
bate, senators took three
straw polls to gauge opin
ions. On the first vote, 10
senators voted to fund the
LCO through the buffer
fund and two through the
general fees reserves. By
the third vote, the vast ma
jority of senators had
changed their minds and de
cided unanimously to use
the general fees reserves.
Senator Daniela Olivos
'l5, one of the original two
voters in favor of using the
general fees reserves,

stressed that it would set a
bad precedent if the Senate
bypassed use of money that
was specifically set aside for
this purpose. The buffer
funds, on the other hand,
have significantly fewer
guidelines governing its use.
Buffer fund spending would
also require approval by the
Graduate Student Council.
"I think the general fees
reserve is for exactly this
money we are asking for,
and the buffer fund doesn't
have a set goal," Olivos said.
"The general fees reserve is
already set for things like
this, so I am confused as to
why we wouldn't use it."
Outgoing ASSU Presi
dent Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
M.A. 'l3 said that the de
bate should be instructive
for incoming senators, who
attended the meeting be
fore being sworn in.

"This should be a great
test case for the future Sen
ate, to think about what dif
ferent funds can and should
be used for and why some
times it is helpful to have
those funds in existence for
things that come up that
you can't quite foresee," he
said.
Ben Holston 'l5 was
sworn in as the 15th ASSU
Undergraduate Senate's
chair, Annalis Breed 'l6 as
deputy chair, and Ryan Mat
sumoto 'l6 as treasurer. The
2013-2014 academic year
will mark the first time
since 2010 that neither the
ASSU Executive nor the
ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate Chair were endorsed by
the Students of Color Coali
tion.
