## Senate to fund student legal services ASSU general funds to make up Legal Counseling Offices special fees rejection 
### LUCY SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At its last meeting, the 14th ASSU Under
graduate Senate voted to fund the Legal Coun
seling Office (LCO) through general fees re
serves. The 15th ASSU Undergraduate Senate
was sworn in after the meeting's conclusion.
The LCO had previously fallen 17 votes
short of receiving funding on the special fees
ballot, the only group to be denied special fees
funding.
Prior to the transition, senators also con
firmed a Nominations Committee (NomCom)
bill nominating students to University com
mittees, with nine voting in favor and three ab
staining due to conflicts of interest with nomi
nees. NomCom co-chairs John Dodini 'l3 and
Jonathan York 'l3 said that they were general
ly satisfied with the interest expressed in Uni
versity committees.
"I am very confident in all the nominees,"
York said. "One disappointment is that we did
n't have the opportunity to appoint a male stu
dent to the Sexual Assault Advisory Board,
purely because we did not have an applicant."
A bill that proposed a $40,000 grant for the
LCO consumed almost an hour of debate. The
organization has been funded by special fees
for the past 20 years, and despite its rejection
on the spring ballot, Deputy Chair Garima
Sharma 'l5 proposed granting the LCO mon
ey from the ASSU buffer fund.
Senators eventually decided to allocate
funding from the ASSU's general fees re
serves, unspent funds previously earmarked
