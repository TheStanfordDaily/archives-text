## University set to renovate Old Chem 
### MARGARET WENZLAU 
The University has moved forward with
plans to renovate the historic Old Chemistry
(Old Chem) Building and construct a new Bass
Biology Building, with both projects expected to
be completed by the 2016-17 academic year.
Though the Office of Development has al
ready solicited initial donations for both projects,
which are currently in the planning stages, addi
tional donors are still being sought. According to
Senior Development Writer and Editor Anneke
Cole, gifts are confidential between the donor
and the University, and the origins and size of
each donation will not be released.
Renovating Old Chem
In his annual report to the Academic Council
on April 18, President John Hennessy referred
to the Old Chemistry building as an "architectur
al treasure," and noted that renovating Old
Chem had long been one of his goals.
The renovation of Old Chem will allow for
more advanced research and experiments among
students and faculty through converting the
building into an undergraduate science center for
both the chemistry and biology departments.
Plans for the future of Old Chem have been
debated for decades, as the building has been un
used and fenced off since 1987.
According to Director of the Department of
Project Management Laura Goldstein, the build
ing was initially closed because it did not meet
seismic standards. While other buildings on cam
pus were rebuilt following the Loma Prieta
earthquake in 1989, Old Chem remained vacant.
Even so, the building will be renovated rather
than torn down due to its historical and aesthet
ic significance. Commissioned by Jane Lathrop
in 1900, the building is cur
rently one of the oldest on
campus and one of the few
dating from before the 1906
earthquake.
According to Robert Si
moni, chair of the depart
ment of biology, the renova
tion will benefit the depart
ment in "every possible way."
Currently, about 400 stu
dents take biology classes
each year in the Herrin
Building, which Simoni de
scribed as "outdated and
compromised."
"There are some kinds of
experiments we can't do be
cause the place doesn't have
fume hoods and so on," Si
moni said. "A new Old Chem
will allow us to modernize our
undergraduate teaching labs,
which frankly is long over
due, and we are very excited
about that."

Bass Biology Building
Plans for the construction
of a new biology research
building, which will provide
additional laboratory space,
began in 2007. Plans were
put on hold after the 2008 fi
nancial crisis, before a dona
tion from the Bass family
restarted the initiative.
According to Simoni, the
University is still seeking
donors for the building, to

meet the entire cost.
After construction is com
pleted, many biology re
search faculty members cur
rently working in Herrin will
move to laboratories in
the new Bass building. Ac
cording to Goldstein, the
building will be located adja
cent to the Mudd Chemistry
Building.
The University has cho
sen an architect for the ren
ovation of the Old Chem
building, and plans to select
an architect for the Bass
building by May. In his ad
dress to the Faculty Senate,
Hennessy said that construc
tion on the Bass building
should "begin shortly."
Simoni emphasized that
the creation of a new building
has become more necessary
to offer more advanced re
search, and said that a reno
vation of Herrin Hall would
not provide adequate im
provements.
"Faculty that are moving
into the Bass Biology build
ing are coming from the Her
rin research building
[which was] first occupied in
1957 and there are lots of
things that can't be done in
that building," Simoni said.
"Renovations of the space
would be exceedingly expen
sive and compromise the
quality. The building was not
built for modern day re
search."
