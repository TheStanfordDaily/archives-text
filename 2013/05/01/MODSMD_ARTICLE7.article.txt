## University set to renovate Old Chem 
### MARGARET WENZLAU 
The University has moved forward with
plans to renovate the historic Old Chemistry
(Old Chem) Building and construct a new Bass
Biology Building, with both projects expected to
be completed by the 2016-17 academic year.
Though the Office of Development has al
ready solicited initial donations for both projects,
which are currently in the planning stages, addi
tional donors are still being sought. According to
Senior Development Writer and Editor Anneke
Cole, gifts are confidential between the donor
and the University, and the origins and size of
each donation will not be released.
Renovating Old Chem
In his annual report to the Academic Council
on April 18, President John Hennessy referred
to the Old Chemistry building as an "architectur
al treasure," and noted that renovating Old
Chem had long been one of his goals.
The renovation of Old Chem will allow for
more advanced research and experiments among
students and faculty through converting the
building into an undergraduate science center for
both the chemistry and biology departments.
Plans for the future of Old Chem have been
debated for decades, as the building has been un
used and fenced off since 1987.
According to Director of the Department of
Project Management Laura Goldstein, the build
ing was initially closed because it did not meet
seismic standards. While other buildings on cam
pus were rebuilt following the Loma Prieta
earthquake in 1989, Old Chem remained vacant.
Even so, the building will be renovated rather
than torn down due to its historical and aesthet
ic significance. Commissioned by Jane Lathrop
