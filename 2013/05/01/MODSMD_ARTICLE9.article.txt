Taekwondo has approximately 30 people in
its club and an additional 15 people on the team.
About half of them came in with experience al
ready, but many people also stalled out as white
belts or first tried out other martial arts. For ex
ample, cotercn Kaz Gunning, currently presi-

dent of the club, started out with karate
and tried out different martial arts like
muay thai before eventually sticking with
taekwondo because of its competitiveness
and the high level he could compete at.
While Stanford Taekwondo is a club
sport, the student-athletes enjoy many
of the same resources as varsity athletes.
Tim Ghormley, who has been coaching the
club since January 2004, praised the Stan
ford administration for all the support that

taekwondo has gotten, drawing comparisons
with his time coaching at Cal State University.
"It's a really positive environment," Ghorm
ley said. "We're lucky that we have a very sup
portive administration and that's a little unusual
from what I'm used to."
The team also enjoys a great number of
award-winning coaches. Ghormley
himself was named National

Coach of the Year in 2009, and Kent Kitagawa,
now the head sparring coach for Stanford, spent
two years as head coach of the U.S. National Col
legiate Team. Additionally, Reynaldo Soriano,
the assistant sparring coach, is a former member
on the Australian National Team.

Stanford Taekwondo holds seven practices a

week that last at least an hour and
a half. Some members also at
tend private training sessions to
work on personal goals and
skills.
Training is taken very se
riously even while balanc
ing a heavy computer sci
ence major course load, soph
omore Haley Kong trains prac
tically every day.
"Training taekwondo translates
f into what you do in life, so just like how
you focus with school work, you have to
focus with every millisecond in taekwondo
because every decision you make can
change the outcome in a match," Kong said.
"We have goals each week and have sem
inars with our coaches to discuss what we
I want to improve on," said John Do ' 12, who
I has been with Stanford Taekwondo since his
' freshman year.
Do also mentioned cross-training, including
plyometric workouts after training that target
