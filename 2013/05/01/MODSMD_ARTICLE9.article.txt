Taekwondo has approximately 30 people in
its club and an additional 15 people on the team.
About half of them came in with experience al
ready, but many people also stalled out as white
belts or first tried out other martial arts. For ex
ample, cotercn Kaz Gunning, currently presi-

dent of the club, started out with karate
and tried out different martial arts like
muay thai before eventually sticking with
taekwondo because of its competitiveness
and the high level he could compete at.
While Stanford Taekwondo is a club
sport, the student-athletes enjoy many
of the same resources as varsity athletes.
Tim Ghormley, who has been coaching the
club since January 2004, praised the Stan
ford administration for all the support that

taekwondo has gotten, drawing comparisons
with his time coaching at Cal State University.
"It's a really positive environment," Ghorm
ley said. "We're lucky that we have a very sup
portive administration and that's a little unusual
from what I'm used to."
The team also enjoys a great number of
award-winning coaches. Ghormley
himself was named National

Coach of the Year in 2009, and Kent Kitagawa,
now the head sparring coach for Stanford, spent
two years as head coach of the U.S. National Col
legiate Team. Additionally, Reynaldo Soriano,
the assistant sparring coach, is a former member
on the Australian National Team.

Stanford Taekwondo holds seven practices a

week that last at least an hour and
a half. Some members also at
tend private training sessions to
work on personal goals and
skills.
Training is taken very se
riously even while balanc
ing a heavy computer sci
ence major course load, soph
omore Haley Kong trains prac
tically every day.
"Training taekwondo translates
f into what you do in life, so just like how
you focus with school work, you have to
focus with every millisecond in taekwondo
because every decision you make can
change the outcome in a match," Kong said.
"We have goals each week and have sem
inars with our coaches to discuss what we
I want to improve on," said John Do ' 12, who
I has been with Stanford Taekwondo since his
' freshman year.
Do also mentioned cross-training, including
plyometric workouts after training that target

different muscle groups. "We work
on fast-twitch muscles, like a sprint
er, because we need to engage and
throw out fast, precise kicks."
Every year, Stanford Taekwon
do takes part in several competi
tions, including the PacWest Confer
ence, where it faces seven other
West Coast colleges, and the Na
tional Collegiate Taekwondo Cham
pionships. Some members of the
team also compete outside of the
collegiate circuit in competitions
such as state championships, the
U.S. Open and as well as interna
tional contests.
Competitions are made up of
both poomsae and sparring
events. Poomsae can be thought of
as a choreographed set of moves in
which the competitor has to move
with precision, style and technique
that judges score on, while sparring
is scored by electronic protective
gear that counts how many kicks
are landed on certain regions of the
body Earlier this winter, Stanford
tied for first place with UC-Davis at
the PacWest Conference, and in the
second week of spring quarter,
Stanford won the championship di
vision at nationals in the Colorado
Springs Olympic Training Center.
"We go there and we're a group
of Spartans," Do said. "We don't
come in with a lot of people com
pared to other teams they just
get to go up to the podium just by
sheer numbers. And we were able
to place by just three people going
to compete."
"Well for one thing let just say
how proud I am," Ghormley said.
"They work really hard just like
any other team. Lots of hours of
practice and sacrifice. [Winning]
definitely solidified my position na
tionally as a part of a quality pro
gram that produces athletes as well
as one of the largest recreational
sports on campus."

Physical attributes, endurance,

speed and flexibility are all impor
tant to the martial artist. However,
mental acuity, strategy and execu
tion are just as significant.
"To me, what a taekwondo ath
lete should encompass is one, on
the physical side of things, training
your body hard, but then the other
part is the philosophy behind what
ever you do. You aren't just kicking
for the sake of kicking. You have a
reason," Do explained. "What sep
arates some from others is that
they strive for excellence in not just
themselves but also in others
around them, as a team building
synergy. That to me is the excellent
taekwondo [athlete]."
Respect is also paid to the roots
and tradition of taekwondo. Before
training, all members are expected
to bow into the ring and pay re
spect to the coaches, as well as to
the judges during competition.
"It's a martial sport," Ghormley
said, "with all the components of a
regular competitive sport and the
underpinning nature of martial
arts. Everyone adapts to their own
strengths and weaknesses, and as a
coach you have to determine all
that."
Kong remarked on how every
one's kiap is extremely unique to
each individual. "I also love how
when people are wearing their
headgear and shoulder protectors
and everything, you can't identify
them but then within five seconds of
watching them fight, you can tell
who they are."

Taekwondo is not only open to
Stanford as a whole, but also to the
community, and the club hosts op
portunities for locals from outside of
Stanford. In fact, Stanford Taek
wondo hosts two junior scrimmages,
in which clubs from all over the Bay
Area (some clubs coming in from
Oregon, Nevada and even Alaska)
are invited to an open tournament
competition that the Stanford team
judges.
The club also collaborates with
Team-M, a demonstration team
based in San Jose. Team-M's head
poomsae coach, Huy Nguyen, re
cently named Coach of the Year,

helps the Stanford team with its
poomsae. As poomsae has be
come more popular during competi
tions, this relationship with the local
group has definitely given it an ad
vantage.
Additionally, the club has close
ties with teams abroad, contribut
ing to an even more comprehensive
and international experience for its
members, and also participates in
exchange programs with other na
tional teams. Members from teams
based in Taiwan, Mexico or Cuba
have been invited to travel to Stan
ford to train on the Farm, and ath
letes from Stanford have also
trained elsewhere.
Stanford Taekwondo had also
hired two interns from Korea to
help the club train, and during the

practices, it's evident that the stu
dent-athletes really appreciate the
extra input.
"They're world champions," said
William Nguyen, a graduate stu
dent who has been part of the team
for two years. "It's pretty cool hav
ing a foreign national champion
come to help us train so that we get
better."
"They're just that much above
us, and they're [people] I aspire to
wards. As our coaches, even
though you can tell that there's a
language barrier and it's hard to
communicate with them, they real
ly care about us and how we do as
individuals."

For many of the club members
however, taekwondo is not just

about the sport. Stanford Taekwon
do hosts many internal social events
and many members agree that
they've met their best friends on the
training mat.
"People aren't just interested in
competition," Nguyen said. "It's to
have a place where people can
come and have a good workout,
training and exercise. [The team]
is really welcoming, which draws
me to [taekwondo]. When I first
joined, the people kept me here. I
never wanted to ever leave be
cause of taekwondo. It's made my
time at Stanford. I honestly can't
imagine life without taekwondo
now."

Taekwondo has approximately 30 people in
its club and an additional 15 people on the team.
About half of them came in with experience al
ready, but many people also stalled out as white
belts or first tried out other martial arts. For ex
ample, cotercn Kaz Gunning, currently presi-

dent of the club, started out with karate
and tried out different martial arts like
muay thai before eventually sticking with
taekwondo because of its competitiveness
and the high level he could compete at.
While Stanford Taekwondo is a club
sport, the student-athletes enjoy many
of the same resources as varsity athletes.
Tim Ghormley, who has been coaching the
club since January 2004, praised the Stan
ford administration for all the support that

taekwondo has gotten, drawing comparisons
with his time coaching at Cal State University.
"It's a really positive environment," Ghorm
ley said. "We're lucky that we have a very sup
portive administration and that's a little unusual
from what I'm used to."
The team also enjoys a great number of
award-winning coaches. Ghormley
himself was named National

Coach of the Year in 2009, and Kent Kitagawa,
now the head sparring coach for Stanford, spent
two years as head coach of the U.S. National Col
legiate Team. Additionally, Reynaldo Soriano,
the assistant sparring coach, is a former member
on the Australian National Team.

Stanford Taekwondo holds seven practices a

week that last at least an hour and
a half. Some members also at
tend private training sessions to
work on personal goals and
skills.

"Training taekwondo translates
f into what you do in life, so just like how
you focus with school work, you have to
focus with every millisecond in taekwondo
because every decision you make can
change the outcome in a match," Kong said.
"We have goals each week and have sem

different muscle groups. "We work
on fast-twitch muscles, like a sprint

throw out fast, precise kicks."
Every year, Stanford Taekwon
do takes part in several competi
tions, including the PacWest Confer
ence, where it faces seven other
West Coast colleges, and the Na
tional Collegiate Taekwondo Cham
pionships. Some members of the
team also compete outside of the
collegiate circuit in competitions
such as state championships, the
U.S. Open and as well as interna
tional contests.
Competitions are made up of
both poomsae and sparring
events. Poomsae can be thought of
as a choreographed set of moves in
which the competitor has to move
with precision, style and technique
that judges score on, while sparring
is scored by electronic protective
gear that counts how many kicks
are landed on certain regions of the
body Earlier this winter, Stanford
tied for first place with UC-Davis at
the PacWest Conference, and in the
second week of spring quarter,
Stanford won the championship di
vision at nationals in the Colorado
Springs Olympic Training Center.
"We go there and we're a group
of Spartans," Do said. "We don't
come in with a lot of people com
pared to other teams they just
get to go up to the podium just by
sheer numbers. And we were able
to place by just three people going
to compete."
"Well for one thing let just say
how proud I am," Ghormley said.
"They work really hard just like
any other team. Lots of hours of
practice and sacrifice. [Winning]
definitely solidified my position na
tionally as a part of a quality pro
gram that produces athletes as well
as one of the largest recreational
sports on campus."

Physical attributes, endurance,

speed and flexibility are all impor
tant to the martial artist. However,
mental acuity, strategy and execu
tion are just as significant.
"To me, what a taekwondo ath
lete should encompass is one, on
the physical side of things, training
your body hard, but then the other
part is the philosophy behind what
ever you do. You aren't just kicking
for the sake of kicking. You have a
reason," Do explained. "What sep
arates some from others is that
they strive for excellence in not just
themselves but also in others
around them, as a team building
synergy. That to me is the excellent
taekwondo [athlete]."
Respect is also paid to the roots
and tradition of taekwondo. Before
training, all members are expected
to bow into the ring and pay re
spect to the coaches, as well as to
the judges during competition.
"It's a martial sport," Ghormley
said, "with all the components of a
regular competitive sport and the
underpinning nature of martial
arts. Everyone adapts to their own
strengths and weaknesses, and as a
coach you have to determine all
that."
Kong remarked on how every
one's kiap is extremely unique to
each individual. "I also love how
when people are wearing their
headgear and shoulder protectors
and everything, you can't identify
them but then within five seconds of
watching them fight, you can tell
who they are."
