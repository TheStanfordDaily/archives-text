## Seattle would benefit from expansion 
### Winston Shi 
Where is Seattle
basketball going
now? On Monday,
an NBA commit
tee unanimously
recommended against Seattle's bid
to relocate the Sacramento Kings to
the Emerald City. The committee
was composed of seven team owners,
and since the Seattle group needs 23
out of 30 owners' votes in order to
purchase the team, Seattle's chances
of getting the Kings are almost zero.
The clock has not struck midnight on
Seattle basketball, but the dream is
living on borrowed time.
Recently, I penned a column in
this space arguing for this very thing
to happen for Sacramento, one of
the best fanbases in sports, to keep
its only professional spoils team.
However, that doesn't mean that
I like what I see right now.
There are no good guys or bad
guys in this struggle. Seattle de
serves a team every bit as much as
Sacramento does.
Seattle lost the SuperSonics to
Oklahoma City because the city gov
ernment in Seattle refused to pay
half a billion dollars for a new arena.
The specious argument has been
thrown around that if Seattle fans
wanted to keep their team, they
should have elected officials that
would have made appeasing the Son
ics their first priority. But if Seattle
residents had voted for politicians
because of pro basketball, that
wouldn't have said much for the dem
ocratic process. Seattle's politicians
did not step up to the plate, but that
is not the fault of the fans.
Admittedly, half a billion dollars is
a staggering amount of money, but
that is the price of doing business
these days, and Seattle is ready to
pay that price. $5OO million spread
out among the Seattle metropolitan
area's 3.5 million residents, works
out to approximately seven dollars a
year over 20 years.
Just as important is the idea of
pro basketball in Seattle. The city is
well known for being a hotbed of bas
ketball talent and is easily a top-ten
producer of NBA players. Chris
Hansen and Steve Ballmer's bidding
group has both the money and the
will to bring a team to Seattle. Plans
for the new basketball arena have al
ready been established. Land has
been secured. And before the NBA
committee's decision, the Kings'
owners had already agreed to a deal.
The Seattle group overstepped;
they thought they had won the race
when in reality they still had a lap to
go. Sacramento put together a com
peting offer, complete with an expen
sive new arena, in record time, and
proved that they deserved to keep
the Kings.
Still, not having an NBA team in
Seattle a city that Nielsen esti
mates is the 12th-largest TV market
in the United States makes about
as much sense as not having an NFL
team in Los Angeles.
As with Los Angeles and football,
Seattle will continue playing basket
ball and producing NBA talent. The
game is part of the lifeblood of the
city. But the Kings represented Seat
tle's best chance to get a basketball
team in a long time a chance that
may be the last for the foreseeable
future. At this point, most NBA
teams are quite firmly entrenched in
their home cities, and it was shocking
that the Kings were even available to
the Seattle bidding group in the first
place.
Where does Seattle go now?
There are two things that the
NBA could do. It could move a differ
ent team from a saturated market to
Seattle, but there is very little over
lap between NBA fanbases. The
Kings were considered a candidate
for relocation in part because Sacra
mento is fairly close to Oakland and
the Warriors, but Sacramento and
the Bay Area are miles apart. The
Brooklyn Nets probably shouldn't
pack up and move yet again two
years after relocating from New Jer
sey. The Clippers are a prime candi
date to move, although that is up to
Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who
has shown no interest in either sell
ing or moving the team in the past.
In any case, Seattle should not
have to choose between ripping a
fanbase's heart out basically, what
Oklahoma City's owners did to Son
ics fans and going without a team.
The irony of the Kings situation was
already palpable. There are not too
many Clippers fans, but those that
exist would likely give up on the
NBA rather than cheer for the Lak
ers.
It seems as though the only way
to go from here is expansion.
