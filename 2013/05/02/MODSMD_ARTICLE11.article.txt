# IN PRIME POSITION
## CAL CLASHES WITH CARD 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
After an up-and-down season,
the Stanford lacrosse team is right
where it wants to be going into the
playoffs.
"It feels good that the dirty
work is done. We're in great posi
tion and now we go out and lay it all
on the line," said Stanford head
coach Amy Bokker. "We got to what
we wanted to the MPSF tourna
ment and now our goal is to win
the championship as has been our
goal for the whole season."
That quest kicks off tonight as
second-seeded Stanford (11-5, 6-2
MPSF) faces third-seeded Cal (9-6,
6-2 MPSF) in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation semifinals in
Oregon.
Cal will be out for revenge after
the Cardinal ruined the Golden
Bears' Senior Night last week. On
April 27, Stanford junior Rachel
Ozer scored with eight seconds left
on the clock to give the Cardinal a
dramatic 14-13 comeback victory in
Berkeley.
"It's weird playing the same
team consecutively, but I think it's
helpful to have them fresh in your
mind," Ozer said. "You know their
tendencies, remember what it was
like and are able to have a good
game plan."
The win capped off a slightly
rocky closing month for the Cardi
nal that Bokker attributed partially
to a tough travel schedule. Stanford
lost three of its final seven games,
including a shocking overtime loss
to unranked UC-Davis in the penul
timate game of the season. Howev
er, every other team that beat the
Cardinal this season is currently
ranked in the top 11 nationally.
Stanford opened the season with
a 12-10 loss to then-No. 9 Notre
Dame; although disappointing, the
performance proved that the Car
dinal could hang close with the top
teams in the country. Stanford
drove that point home with a 12-10
win over then-No. 13 Ohio State in
Columbus, Ohio, on March 2, a vic
tory that Stanford junior goalkeep
er Lyndsey Munoz said was one of
the biggest moments of the season.
"We had taken a crazy red-eye
flight and even though they had a
dome, we were playing outside in
the snow, but we took that and ran
with that," Munoz said. "It made us

realize that we could do that
we're not just Cali girls, we can
handle ourselves in the snow and
make a statement."
After a loss to another tradition
al powerhouse, then-No. 11 George
town, the Cardinal ripped off a
string of five straight wins includ
ing two key victories over Vander
bilt and James Madison during a

spring break trip.
"To come out of that break for fi
nals and the switchover in the quar
ter and play at a high level was one
of the high points for me," Bokker
said. "We really dominated at Van
derbilt which is typically a really
tough opponent then [travelled] to
Harrisburg and still [did] well."
Stanford's two conference loss

es came against No. 11 Denver, the
top seed in the conference, and UC-
Davis. If Stanford wins its first
round game, it may get another
shot at the Pioneers, who play
fourth-seeded USC in the other
semifinal.
"We're looking to get a good
game against Cal and then we lost
to Denver earlier this season, so
we're looking to get back at them,"
Ozer said. "We do expect to pull off
the wins and get to NCAAs."
Ozer said that the Cardinal is
looking to use its extended time in
Oregon to recreate the spring
break magic. The team flew to Ore
gon on Tiiesday and has been train
ing and practicing since then, and
according to Ozer, the space allows
the team to avoid distractions.
Bokker concurred that the team
will focus on one game at a time
and, specifically, the goals the team
sets for each contest.
"We have individual game goals
that we try to reach for each game,"
Bokker said. "I think those are re
ally realistic for leading us to a
championship."
Bokker said that the offensive
keys will be limiting turnovers and
taking advantage of shooting op
portunities. On defense, Bokker
said her team will try to use its fa
miliarity with Cal's attack to take
control of the game.
The biggest emphasis for the
entire team, however, will be draw
controls. In the last meeting, the
Cardinal won 16 of 29 draw con
trols, but according to Stanford
players and coaches, that wasn't
good enough.
"We want to do a much

since they were getting more of
those than we would like," Munoz
said. "Their draw taker, Megan
Takacs, is very good at winning
draws to herself and we want to
get more of those."
The Cardinal will counter
Takacs, the two-time MPSF Play
er of the Year, with junior defender
Megan Lerner, who set the Stan
ford school record by tallying 55
draw controls this season.
"[Lerner] has a total nose for
the ball and just a 'see ball, get
ball' mentality," Bokker said.
"We've been really lucky to have

her in that position and I'm really
happy for her in terms of the
school record."
On Wednesday, Lerner was
named a first-team All-MPSF se
lection along with teammates soph
omore Hannah Farr and juniors
Anna Kim and Rachel Ozer. Fresh
man Lucy Dikeou and junior Nina
Swanson were selected to the sec
ond team. All of those players will
be key for the Cardinal as it tries to
advance deep into the playoffs.
"We had high expectations at
the beginning of the season and I
don't think any of us have lowered
our expectations," Ozer said. "It's
crazy how fast the season has gone
by, but we're really excited about
the postseason."
