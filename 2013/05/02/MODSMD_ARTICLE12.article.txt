# Golf settles for fourth at Pac-12s
## 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
In any sport, there are times
when rankings can be thrown out
the window and seen for what they
really are: simple numbers and cal
culations, oftentimes not worth the
paper on which they're printed. In
golf, especially, rankings and
stroke averages often aren't good
indicators of tournament perform
ance and can largely be ignored be
cause of the great parity the game
carries. But, in the saga of colle
giate golf, there are events where
the numbers are indeed right, and
the 2013 Pac-12 men's golf champi
onship was one of them. Just call it
The Rankings Strike Back.
No. 1 California repeated as
Pac-12 champions beating out
No. 5 UCLA and No. 6 Washington
while the No. 8 Stanford men's
golf team inched ahead of Arizona
State for fourth. The Cardinal im
proved on its sixth place finish a
year ago but extended its winless
streak at the conference tourna
ment to 19 years.
"We were happy with [Wednes
day's] round. We actually made a
little bit of a comeback and were
able to secure fourth all alone in the
team competition," head coach
Conrad Ray said. "Obviously, the
Pac-12 is stacked in terms of talent
and rankings this year, so fourth is
n't all bad."
"Stacked" is an understate
ment, with seven Pac-12 teams in
the nation's top 50. The conference
also boasts seven of the nation's top
15 players. Oddly enough, No. 1
Michael Kim of Cal and No. 5
Patrick Rodgers of Stanford
weren't really factors in this year's
tournament.
Rodgers, the reigning Pac-12
Rookie of the Year, wasn't able to
break par in the last three rounds
of the event, and things went from
bad to worse on his final hole of the
fourth round, the 498 yard, par-4
18th.
"Patrick Rodgers had a bad

break on the last hole making a
double bogey, but he still had a very
nice finish," Ray said. "He hit a
rake near the bunker on the 18th
hole, and his ball caromed off the
green and had a really tough chip
and ended up with a double. So mi

nus a couple of those shots, he
played decently well [Wednes
day]."
The sophomore out of Avon,
Ind., finished in a tie for 11th at 7-
over par, failing to improve upon
his eighth-place performance last

year.
With Rodgers off his game, jun
ior Cameron Wilson stepped up as
Stanford's leader for the final two
rounds. In a tie for seventh place
and within two shots of third place
after 54 holes, Wilson wasn't able
to maintain his consistency yester
day, recording four bogeys, three
birdies and his only double bogey
of the tournament on the pai'-4 2nd
hole.
"I was impressed with Cameron
Wilson's play this week, finishing
ninth overall in a very strong field,"
commented Ray. "He really played
solid and was in control of his
game. I think he felt that, if a few
more putts would've dropped, he'd
been right there in contention."
A name surprisingly absent
from the top of the leaderboard
was Stanford's senior Andrew Yun.
The defending Pac-12 individual
champion failed to break par in any
of the tournament's four rounds
but did shoot his best score of 1-
over 71 in Wednesday's final round,
moving up 15 places into a tie for
29th.
Fellow senior Steve Kearney
had a great end to his final confer
ence event, carding a 2-under 68 in
the fourth round, tied for the best
of the day. His four-birdie, two-bo
gey performance left him tied for
24th, his best finish at the Pac-12
Tournament. His only other ap
pearance at the Pac-12s was a tie
for 30th in 2011.
"Steven Kearney's round is of
note, tying the low round of the day
as our fifth man this week," Ray re
marked. "68 today on a very, very
difficult golf course and very diffi
cult set-up was a great round and
was a huge part of us moving up
the leaderboard today."
Junior Shane Lebow and fresh
man David Boote, both playing
their first conference tournament,
tied for 45th and 66th, respectively,
in the 72-man field.
