## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY Stanford Perpetuates the Elite Class 
### Adam Johnson 
Five years ago, then-Yale profes
sor and Columbia graduate
William Deresiewicz wrote a
lengthy attack on top-tier universities
in a piece entitled "The Disadvan
tages of an Elite Education." There
were many points of criticism in the
article, but the main gist was that top
universities like Harvard and Yale
were no longer in the business of ex
panding minds but rather in creating
and refining the next generation of
the elite.
Deresiewicz mainly focused his
criticism on the bastions of higher ed
ucation on the East Coast, but his
conclusions apply equally to Stanford.
Of course, we like to fool ourselves in
to thinking that we are not members
of the elite class. We go to class in bro
tanks and sweatpants, we fountain
hop or play volleyball in the sun, we
believe in equality and social justice,
and our jobs of choice are not on Wall
Street or Capitol Hill. And yet, as I
approach my graduation, it is becom
ing increasingly clear that this is an il
lusion and always has been. Many of
us will soon trade in our bro-tanks
and volleyballs for suits and business
cards. Even if we end up working at
Dropbox or Google, the elites in Sili
con Valley are still elite.
As Deresiewicz wrote, "the way
students are treated in college trains
them for the social position they will
occupy once they get out." Stanford,
then, is one of the major forces re
sponsible for reproducing the "prop
er" norms and customs in the next
generation of elite. If the university
faculty and upper members of the ad
ministration tolerate us being slightly
irreverent during our time here, it is
only with the full understanding that
when we finish our schooling we will
nevertheless enter into their world.
When we were instructed during
NSO to connect with faculty mem
bers in our time here, was that in or
der to further our intellectual devel
opment or rather to give us connec
tions to the upper echelons of society
that would prove useful later on? Is a
class like French 60 ("Wine Tasting")
an earnest intellectual endeavor to
explore the field of viticulture, or is it
an attempt to train us how to order
the proper wine when we are dining
with power brokers in five years? Is it
any wonder that the administration is
indifferent to how the CDC's recruit
ment policies provide Stanford stu
dents with unparalleled access to the
wealthiest banks, consulting firms
and tech companies?
Or how about our residential sys
tem? Most students, for instance,
have their cleaning and cooking done
for them for all four years of our
guaranteed housing. On The Unoffi
cial Stanford Blog, contributor
Megan recently lamented that stu
dents all-too-often abuse this privi
lege by neglecting our living spaces.
She muses, "We're at the country's
number-one dream school and I don't
see why we would want to trash any
part of it."
To me, though, it all makes sense.
We are more than capable of doing
these things for ourselves, yet Stan
ford has decided that the ethic of
shared responsibility in maintaining
our surrounding environment is not
worth our time. Time is money, and
our time is apparently better spent
doing problem sets, leading student
groups and partying (read: network
ing) with the other future elite. It is a
wonder that we still have to do our
own laundry.
Needless to say, we end up with a
large dose of entitlement. Even those
of us who are well-intentioned are not
immune to inflating our importance.
My colleague Chris Hemes 'l5 re
cently wrote that "the burden of cur
ing HIV solving world hunger, ending
war, bringing justice and expanding
the human literary corpus fall on the
shoulders of elites like us."
While Chris wanted to remind us
of our privilege, that line still troubles
me. If we adopt his perspective, why
should we the elite who are des
tined to save humanityâ€”waste time,
say, cleaning up after ourselves or vol
unteering at a local school? I am re
minded of a critique in the Dere
siewicz piece that schools like Stan
ford place their students "in the para
doxical position of wanting to advo
cate on behalf of the working class
while being unable to hold a simple
conversation with anyone in it." If we
believe Chris's words, even if you
wanted to engage with members of
the working class, how could you be
gin to relate?
Some of you may still resist my ar
gument that Stanford faithfully pro
duces the next generation of elite; you
may point to the expansion of our fi
nancial aid program, which on its face
has promise to narrow class distinc
tions. And some of the students from
underserved backgrounds do give

back in direct ways to their home
communities.
But others, perhaps a majority,
embrace the elite class and become
almost indistinguishable from stu
dents financially privileged from
birth. While it is generally regarded
as morally upright that Stanford
throws so much money at its under
graduates, this practice establishes
an upper-class lifestyle where money
is of little concern, thus allowing class
differences to fly under the radar and
avoid critical discussion.
Why is the peipetuation of the
elite and Stanford's role therein
a problem? First, I think it reduces
our autonomy With so much pressure
to enter the elite class, and the oppor
tunity to be rich if we just do our work
and make the right connections, it be
comes that much harder to resist the
path to power and wealth. There is an
expectation that if you go to one of
these top universities, you ought to
get a good financial return on the in
vestment. If not, you are (as some
have told me) "wasting" the opportu
nity given to you.
Another problem I have with per
petuating the elite class is that it as
sumes the norms and customs of the
current elite class are worth keeping.
Given our custodial staff's readiness
to clean up after every mess, our eas
ily-gained extensions on problem
sets, and the trivial slaps on the wrist
for students who perhaps should have
been expelled, should we be surprised
when graduates of elite universities
like Stanford compromise our na
tion's financial system or send troops
into unjust wars? Things may get
messy like a Stanford bathroom
on a Monday morning but hey,
someone else will clean up the mess
from which we, the elite, profited
greatly. Virtues like responsibility
and selflessness are of little service in
the elite world as it is currently de
signed.
One way forward is to reform the
system from within, as Deresiewicz
attempted to do by criticizing institu
tions of higher education for not ful
filling their mission of broadening the
mind. Another way forward is to by
pass the system. In the immediate &-
ture, there will most likely be an elite
class to populate, so why not try to fill
it with people removed from the uni
versity system that is stuck in its old
ways?
While I was initially critical of Pe
ter Thiel's attempts to encourage stu
dents to drop out of universities and
work on their own companies, my
criticism was rooted in the assump
tion that universities were transfor
mative places for the mind. Now, I am
not so sure, and Thiel's efforts seem
more attractive. While the initial ap
plicants to his program have predom
inantly originated from institutions
like Harvard and Stanford, he be
lieves that someday he will draw stu
dents from more diverse back
grounds; if they become the new elite,
and bypass the university system
that presently socializes students into
the upper class, society may be funda
mentally transformed.
