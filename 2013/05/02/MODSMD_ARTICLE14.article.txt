# GROWING IN A MODERN WORLD
## Call it Genetically Engineered Salmon, not "Frankenfish" 
### Graciela Watrous 
When you Google "genetically
engineered salmon," the sec
ond link that appeal's is titled
"Stop Frankenfish." Several non
profits have begun campaigns in the
last several months demanding the
FDA reject this product, many with
similarly hyperbolic titles, among
them "Stop the Frankenfish Attack."
Unfortunately, the term 'Frankenfish'
has become synonymous with geneti
cally engineered salmon, which
brings to mind a much more grue
some and destructive picture than the
fish is in reality. Genetically engi
neered salmon doesn't have to mean
the end of the world and has the po
tential to provide cheaper, healthier
food to people, something the left
usually supports.
Opposition to this product has
manifested itself in three different
ways. First, the FDA published re
ports on the safety of GE salmon, and
the comment period on the documen
tation has been open on-and-off since
2010; it officially closed April 26th,
2013. More than one organization has
reported that over 1.5 million com
ments against GE salmon have come
in during that period. Even 1.5 million
people, however, is less than one per
cent of the United States' population.
Second, two bills have been re
cently introduced in the 113 th Con
gress, both of which prohibit the do
mestic shipment and sale of geneti
cally engineered salmon. In both cas
es, an Alaskan senator or representa
tive sponsored the bill, which subjects
their bills to increased scrutiny given
the fact that the majority of our
salmon industry has roots in Alaska.
About a month ago, the New York
Times reported that grocery store
chains like Trader Joe's, Whole Foods
and Aldi have stated they will not sell
genetically engineered salmon.
While most Americans do not
shop at any of those grocery stores,
the unfortunate result of these stores'
action would be to stratify the food
system even further and highlight the
differences already in place. It's even
possible that these grocery stores

have the power to catalyze a trend
that other larger chain grocery stores
will follow.
There are, moreover, safeguards
in place. Before the FDA can approve
a type of genetically engineered
salmon (this would be the first time),
the agency has to publish several re
ports to show that the product isn't
dangerous. The two reports the FDA
has published on the product that
Aquabounty, an American company,
has created are the Environmental
Assessment and the Finding of No
Significant Impact. The reports out
line the strict regulation under which
the fish will be grown.
All of it will be grown in tanks in
Panama in a facility miles from water.
If fish were to escape, the water they
would enter would be above the tem
perature survivable for the fish. Fhr
thermore, over 95 percent of the
salmon are bred to be infertile. The
reports also conclude that the fish are
safe for human consumption and do
not affect the (United States') envi
ronment. (While it's true that the re
port does not assess the effect the fish
could have on the Panamanian envi
ronment, this is something the FDA
doesn't require.)
There are, however, some legiti
mate reasons to question this prod
uct. Even before considering contam
ination concerns, the most important
and obvious issue is that the product
is unlikely to be labeled. People
should have the right to choose not to

eat an engineered animal.
What I find most interesting
about labeling is the paradox behind
the controversy. In order for a genet
ically modified product to be labeled,
it needs to be viewed as significantly
different than the naturally occurring
product. Companies that are in the
GMO business argue their products
aren't that different and therefore
shouldn't be labeled. But these same
companies do everything in then
power to protect their patented prod
uct. If the product wasn't that differ
ent, how, then, did it get the patent?
Nevertheless, there are some ma
jor reasons why an everyday con
sumer should be in favor of genetical
ly engineered salmon. The primary
benefits are related to health, the
economy and the environment. Fish
is famously good for you, with its high
concentration of Omega 3 and vita
min B-12 and its ability to ward off
heart disease. It's also widely seen as
a healthy alternative to red meat.
In order to get more people to eat
fish, though, there has to be more fish
available. And in order to ensure that
fish is cheap enough to be accessible
by a wide variety of people, reduc
tions in labor and feed costs need to
occur. GM salmon may be the solution
to those issues because it requires
less of both. As for the environment,
most of the benefits from GM salmon
accrue to aquaculture in general
(which is how this salmon would be
raised). As most people are aware,
the vast majority of wild fisheries are
either in the process of collapsing or
have already collapsed. Aquaculture
is one way to take the pressure off
these systems.
In short, we are in the process of
making radical changes to the way we
feed people. Instead of trying to fight
genetically engineered products
products that are likely unstoppable
â€”we should focus our efforts on
making sure they are marketed and
regulated strictly.
