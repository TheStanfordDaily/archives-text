# SPORTS BRIEF
## Softball drops third straight mid-week contest 
### â€” David Cohn 
After playing nearly flawless
softball to sweep Utah over the
weekend, No. 16 Stanford (32-17,9-
9 Pac-12) was unable to maintain its
momentum, dropping its third
straight non-conference game on
Wednesday evening to UC-Davis
(22-24,8-10 Big West).
In a game that could have im
portant postseason ramifications
for the Cardinal as it seeks to host a
regional in the NCAA Tournament,
Stanford failed to close out the Ag
gies. The Card yielded three runs
after taking a 4-2 lead into the bot
tom of the seventh inning to fall 5-4
in walk-off fashion.
Kayla Bonstrom had a strong
day at the plate for the Cardinal,

going 3-for-4 while driving in two
RBI. The freshman gave Stanford a
1-0 lead in the top of the first inning
with a single down the right-field
line. Bonstrom subsequently plated
a seemingly decisive run in the top
of the seventh when she sent a 3-1
pitch into centerfield for a big RBI
single, giving the Card a two-run
lead.
Teagan Gerhart took the loss in
the circle for Stanford, falling to 18-
9 on the season. Although Gerhart
managed to go the distance for the
Cardinal, she gave up five earned
runs on seven hits.
Stanford will next travel to
Berkeley for a weekend series
against its rival, No. 13 California
(35-12, 9-9 Pac-12). First pitch Fri
day is scheduled for 3 p.m.
