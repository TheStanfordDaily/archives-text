## Speakers include David Shaw '94, Michael Tubbs '12 and Clifford Nass 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Following the positive re
sponse to last year's TEDxStan
ford conference, the University's
Office of Public Affairs will offer a
second installation on May 11 in
Cemex Auditorium.
At time of publication, 22
speaking acts and seven perform
ers were scheduled to present at
the conference, produced in part
nership with the School of Earth
Sciences, the Graduate School of
Business and the Precourt Insti
tute for Energy. According to
event organizers, the theme of
conference is "Breakthroughs,"

but topics will range from the im
pact of multitasking to a stand-up
comedy routine to a discussion of
neural prosthetics.
The current lineup for
TEDxStanford 2013 includes no
table figures like current Stock
ton, Calif., City Councilman
Michael Tubbs 'l2, Stanford foot
ball head coach David Shaw '94
and Professor of Communication
Clifford Nass.
"TEDxStanford is a unique
opportunity for us because it real
ly gives the University the chance
to showcase the great stories, re
search and people that make up
this University," said Melin
da Sacks '74, director of me
dia initiatives and the confer
ence's producer. "What's re
ally terrific about this partic
ular platform is that it's ac
cessible and engaging for
everyone certainly people
don't have to be an expert on
any one topic to appreciate
the content."
According to the TED
website, the TEDx program
is intended to "stimulate dia
logue through TED-like ex
periences at the local level,"
with events being planned
independently by the host
community.
TED itself is a non-profit
devoted to "Ideas Worth
Spreading," having started
as a conference to bring to
gether people from the
worlds of technology, enter
tainment and design. It has
since grown to include a
website hosting thousands of
online TED Talks that the
organization claims have
been collectively viewed
more than a billion times.

Extensive planning process
TEDxStanford began
last year as a collaboration
between the Office of Public
Affairs and interested
alumni. The original event
included 27 speakers and
artists who presented over
three sessions. The 2013
version of the conference
will be similarly formatted
according to Sacks, each
of the three segments will
be about an hour and 45
minutes.
Speakers were selected

in a process that, according
to Sacks, takes "six or seven
months." Last year, the or
ganizers pursued each per
former; this year, however,
the lineup is split "half and
half" between performers
who nominated themselves
and those who were ap
proached by event planners.
All speakers have a Stanford
affiliation as alumni or facul
ty, staff members or stu
dents.
"It's a combination, sort
of a puzzle of putting togeth
er the program," Sacks said.
"You want a really diverse
group of people in terms of
age and topic and ethnicity
and approach."
While there was no for
mal audition process, Sacks
said she used You Tube
videos of potential speakers
to help vet candidates, who
must present their topic in
approximately 15 minutes or
less.
"Being a good presenter
is obviously really important
to this program," Sacks said.
"Giving a TED talk is very
different than giving a lec
ture or going to a three-day
conference where you have
an endless amount of time to
talk."

Speakers prepare
Once speakers and per
formers are selected, they
are given freedom to develop
their talks in collaboration
with the conference's speak
er coach.
"In general, when we re
cruit someone, we expect
that they are going to give a
good talk no matter what, so
we try not to interfere," said
Sukrit Narula 'l4, who co
chairs the student organiz
ing committee with Jay Patel
'l4.

Jack Rakove, professor of
history and political science,
will present on the Electoral
College, emphasizing that he
"would like to get rid of it to
morrow."
"It's counterintuitive
most observers think we're
kind of stuck with it and will
be indefinitely," Rakove said.
"But in the wake of a presi
dential election, both for
general principles and be
cause of specific calculations,
this is actually a great time
to think about it."
Rakove said that al
though he has written and
spoken extensively on the
Electoral College, he has
never participated in a TED
event. In fact, he said he has
never seen a talk besides
brief online excerpts.
According to Rakove, the
novelty of the event is part of
what attracted him to it.
"It's a curious event be
cause people talk about a
whole range of subjects and
there's not one connection
as far as I can tell from
one topic to the next,"
Rakove said. "I'll be curious
to see how it flows and how
it goes and how both the au
dience and the participants
react."

Overwhelming demand
Tickets to this year's
event sold out in less than 30
minutes, despite the inclu
sion of two overflow rooms
that will allow 160 extra at
tendees in addition to Ce
mex's capacity of 583. Ac
cording to Sacks, the audi
ence consists of 30 percent
students, 35 percent general
public, 10 percent
faculty/staff and 25 percent
miscellaneous, which in
cludes speakers and per
formers, invited guests and

event staff.
While at the event, audi
ence members will be able to
mingle with performers and
even take photos with them
at an outdoor photo booth
sponsored by the Stanford
group mediaX.
"One of the coolest things
about the event is that when
you are there, you actually
get to interact with the
speakers," Narula said.
"They'll come out and you
can sit and eat lunch with
them that was my fa
vorite part last year and
probably will be this year as
well."
The conference will also
include an outdoor gallery
that will replace the product
demo that was held last year.
Sacks said the gallery, which
will be held in Arbuckle
Cafe, will give conference at
tendees "a chance to interact
with all types of art proj
ects."
For those who couldn't
obtain a ticket, the event will
be available on live stream
on the TEDxStanford web
site. Sacks added that all ma
terial will be made available
online after it undergoes
post-production.
Sacks said that although
she had been slightly nerv
ous about the audience re
sponse last year, this year
she is confident that atten
dees will enjoy the show.
"I just think the range of
topics and the different
kinds of people we have in
this program will really de
light and surprise our audi
ence in a whole new way,"
Sacks said. "It's like an intel
lectual variety show of fan
tastic Stanford content."
