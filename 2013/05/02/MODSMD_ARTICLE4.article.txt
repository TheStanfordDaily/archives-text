## Researchers find brain's numbers node

Researchers in the Stanford Human In
tracranial Cognitive Electrophysiology pro
gram recently identified the specific cluster of
neurons in the brain that recognizes numerals.
The team's findings were published on
April 17 in the Journal of Neuroscience. The
study was co-authored by Associate Professor
of Neurology and Neurological Sciences Josef
Parvizi; postdoctoral research fellows Dora
Hermes-Miller, Brett Foster and Mohammad
Dastjerdi; research associate Jonathan
Winawer; research assistant Yinitha Rangara
jan; and neurosurgery resident Kai Miller.
"We have been working on this for a while,"
Hermes-Miller said. "This is a very exciting
finding. It is great that we have been able to
test for and find the existence of a number re
gion in the brain."
Parvizi said that the discovery originated in
his study of patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. For those patients, Parvizi uses in
tracranial electrodes to track when and how a
seizure is triggered.
"The electrodes record data from a group
of neurons and will detect epileptic activity
from any group of pathological neurons," he
said. "The coverage is different for each pa
tient depending on clinical signs, and we look
for the site of seizure origina
tion â€” say, in the occipital
lobe, or the frontal lobe, or so
on, depending on the pa
tient."
Researchers have to wait
for up to seven days to record
a seizure signal, according to
Parvizi. During this time, the
researchers asked patients to
volunteer for other studies
about brain functions.
While these experiments
varied in purpose, Parvizi said
that they shared the common
theme of helping the re
searchers determine the loca
tion of brain functions.
"We try to discover how
certain parts of the brain are
localized for certain functions
and how different areas with
related functions work to
gether," Parvizi said.
According to Parvizi, the
most interesting results came
from an experiment to test
whether or not a certain
group of neurons in the brain
was preferentially responsive
to visual stimuli, including
numbers, symbols and let
ters.
Each patient first looked
at numerals and other similar
symbols like letters while re
searchers tracked which por
tion of the patient's brain was
most responsive to each sym
bol.
The patients then viewed
numerals, number-words like
"three" and words that sound
ed similar to the number
words, with researchers again
monitoring brain activity.
Through the experiments,
the researchers were able to
confirm the existence of a spe

cific group of neurons that
preferentially responded to
numerals. This clump of neu
rons, which is less than one
fifth of an inch wide, is located
within the inferior temporal
gyrus, a superficial region of
the brain's outer cortex.
"The location of these neu
rons, or population of neu
rons, was strikingly consis
tent from one subject to an
other, at least in the right
hand hemisphere where we
had good evidence and good
sensor coverage," Parvizi
said.
According to Parvizi, these
neurons are able to recognize
numerals because of the pat
tern of their wiling with other
parts of the brain, as they are
"connected to the areas of the
brain which decode magni
tude and numerosity."
According to Parvizi, the
study is unique because it in
dependently examines each
patient's brain rather than
looking at a normalized brain
composed of aggregated da
ta. The research also con
firmed that the strong corre
lation found in the brains of
different patients existed on
ly for numbers, and not for
colors and shapes.
Although the team's dis
covery sheds some light on
how the brain functions,
Parvizi said that the finding
leaves more questions unan
swered about the fundamen
tal processes of the brain,
such as how human brains
develop these functions.
"When do you acquire the
ability to recognize data, and
how is it acquired?" Parvizi
said. "That is a fascinating
question, and one that I can
not answer."
