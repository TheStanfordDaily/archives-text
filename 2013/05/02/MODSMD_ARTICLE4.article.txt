Researchers in the Stanford Human In
tracranial Cognitive Electrophysiology pro
gram recently identified the specific cluster of
neurons in the brain that recognizes numerals.
The team's findings were published on
April 17 in the Journal of Neuroscience. The
study was co-authored by Associate Professor
of Neurology and Neurological Sciences Josef
Parvizi; postdoctoral research fellows Dora
Hermes-Miller, Brett Foster and Mohammad
Dastjerdi; research associate Jonathan
Winawer; research assistant Yinitha Rangara
jan; and neurosurgery resident Kai Miller.
"We have been working on this for a while,"
Hermes-Miller said. "This is a very exciting
finding. It is great that we have been able to
test for and find the existence of a number re
gion in the brain."
Parvizi said that the discovery originated in
his study of patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. For those patients, Parvizi uses in
tracranial electrodes to track when and how a
seizure is triggered.
"The electrodes record data from a group
of neurons and will detect epileptic activity
from any group of pathological neurons," he
said. "The coverage is different for each pa
tient depending on clinical signs, and we look
