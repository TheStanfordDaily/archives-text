'74, moving from Stanford's
Center for Advanced Study in
Behavioral Sciences to become
the founding dean of the Min
erva Project may offer a
unique experience to redefine
the collegiate experience.
Minerva, which will wel
come its inaugural class in
2015, will attempt to combine
elements of classical and mod
ern educational models in or
der to offer a more effective
and affordable college experi

take all classes online but
despite the lack of a central
campus will live together in
traditional dorms in several
countries, from which they will
participate in online seminars
in real-time and in classes no
bigger than 25 students.
Kosslyn, who assumed his

like Harvard are qualified to
do the work, and there is a
need that is not being met,"
Kosslyn said. 'At Minerva, we
want to avoid all that. We can
expand and take anybody who
is qualified."
Kosslyn said he had not im
mediately been eager to leave
Stanford for such an untested
model. After being introduced
by his wife to the university's
founder and CEO Ben Nelson,
though, Kosslyn's skepticism
soon disappeared.
"The more I talked to him,
the more convinced I was that
he has effectively diagnosed
the problems of higher educa
tion and has solid ideas of how
to deal with them," Kosslyn
said.
Kosslyn said he became
more and more involved in the
project, eventually deciding he
had to work on it full-time in
