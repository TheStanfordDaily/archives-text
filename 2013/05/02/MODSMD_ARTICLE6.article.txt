For Stephen Kosslyn Ph.D.
'74, moving from Stanford's
Center for Advanced Study in
Behavioral Sciences to become
the founding dean of the Min
erva Project may offer a
unique experience to redefine
the collegiate experience.
Minerva, which will wel
come its inaugural class in
2015, will attempt to combine
elements of classical and mod
ern educational models in or
der to offer a more effective
and affordable college experi
ence. Enrolled students will
take all classes online but
despite the lack of a central
campus will live together in
traditional dorms in several
countries, from which they will
participate in online seminars
in real-time and in classes no
bigger than 25 students.
Kosslyn, who assumed his
new position on April 1, previ
ously served as one of the
youngest professors of psy
chology in Harvard's history,
rising to become Harvard's
Dean of Social Sciences before
leaving to direct Stanford's Be

havioral Sciences Center in
2011. He described the projec
t's model as one that will po
tentially allow offers of admis
sion to all qualified applicants.
"A huge number of stu
dents who applied to a school
like Harvard are qualified to
do the work, and there is a
need that is not being met,"
Kosslyn said. 'At Minerva, we
want to avoid all that. We can
expand and take anybody who
is qualified."
Kosslyn said he had not im
mediately been eager to leave
Stanford for such an untested
model. After being introduced
by his wife to the university's
founder and CEO Ben Nelson,
though, Kosslyn's skepticism
soon disappeared.
"The more I talked to him,
the more convinced I was that
he has effectively diagnosed
the problems of higher educa
tion and has solid ideas of how
to deal with them," Kosslyn
said.
Kosslyn said he became
more and more involved in the
project, eventually deciding he
had to work on it full-time in
order to effectively change
the culture of higher educa
tion.
"I wasn't looking for an
other job, but at Minerva I
would have the chance to of
fer change in away that I just
wouldn't if I stayed at my
previous job," he said. "I was
really happy at Stanford, but
this was an opportunity that I
couldn't pass by."
Kosslyn also emphasized
the distinct nature of the Min
erva Project's model of edu
cation, such as the use of
flipped classrooms, compen
sating faculty in accordance
with students' performance,
an emphasis on practical con
tent and rotating students
through campuses around
the world.
"It's about deep learning,"
Kosslyn said. "We aim to
shape intuitions so people can
use the information and skills
they learn creatively. We are
a liberal arts college that

wants to invent new ways of
learning to equip people with
the tools to live a full life and
succeed."
Kosslyn also noted the
participation of other promi
nent individuals in the proj
ect. Former Treasury Secre
tary and Harvard President
Larry Summers and former
Senator Bob Kerrey (D
Neb.) both serve on the Pro
ject's advisory board.
"Minerva is already hav
ing an impact because people
are starting to pay more at
tention to it," Kosslyn said.
'At this point, it is clear what
we are doing and how well it
is going."
To date, work has focused
on developing the software
platform and composing the
curriculum, among other
tasks.
"We're also organizing the
different majors, so the next
step for me is to start hiring
faculty additional administra
tors," Kosslyn said. "Every
thing is pretty much on
track."
