# FINAL CHAPTER
## TAN, DILLON REFLECT ON THEIR FOUR YEARS ON THE FARM 
### WILL SEATON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seniors Stacey Tan and Na
talie Dillon of the Stanford
women's tennis team have
seen their share of change
and development through
their four years on the Farm, lead
ing to memorable victories, a little
frustration and a lot of hard work.
"It's been an incredible jour
ney," Dillon said. "Stanford was so
much of a dream school for me.
Since I was five years old, my
grandparents would take me here.
When you see all the families
around here, I was one of those
kids. I didn't know any other school
apart from Stanford which was a
blessing and a curse."
The Class of 2013 has experi
enced success on the court, starting
their careers by winning the NCAA
Team National Championship. The
next year, the team made it to the fi
nals again before losing to the
Florida Gators. Tan appeared in the

NCAA Singles Championship title
match in 2011, becoming the lowest
ranked player to compete in the
championship match as No. 43, and
she also played in last year's NCAA
Singles Championship. Dillon cap
tured the Pac-10 Championships
Invitational doubles title with Mal
lory Burdette in 2011; both players
have won a share of the Pac-12 title
three times. Most importantly, the
Class of 2013 holds a 7-1 record
against Cal.
"It's kind of hard to believe how
fast it went by," Tan said. "This is
our last chance at NCAAs, last year
to be here. But it's with a great
group of people each year and I
don't think I would have changed
that."
Before this year, there was a
third member of the Class of 2013.
Mallory Burdette was one of the
biggest contributors to the Stan
ford program during her three-year
stint on the Farm before deciding to
try her luck at the pro circuit. She

Although senior Stacey Tan (above) has predominantly been a role-player during her four years at Stanford,
she made history in 2011 when she became the lowest ranked player to advance to the NCAA singles final.
Two years later, she is preparing to compete for the doubles title at the NCAA Championships.
clinched the NCAA title her fresh
man year, won the NCAA doubles
title with Hilary Barte her sopho
more year and again her junior
year with Nicole Gibbs. She was al
so the runner-up in the NCAA sin
gles title last season, losing to
teammate Gibbs in the final. Her
decision to not return for her senior
year came after she reached the
third round of the 2012 U.S. Open
and lost only to third-seeded Maria
Sharapova.
"I wish Mallory could have been
here," Tan said, "but she made the
decision she needed to. She's also
been coming out to matches when
she can; she was there at the Cal
match. She's been doing a great job
of keeping in touch with us which
makes her feel like she's here with
out being physically here."
Tan had been groomed for top
tier tennis: She was a talented re
cruit coming in her freshman year
and a player comfortable being on
her own. She has a 108-35 record so
far during her singles career at
Stanford. Her biggest challenge
playing for the Cardinal was learn
ing that winning was no longer de
fined by her personal success alone,
but by that of her teammates as
well.
"I was a very independent, indi
vidual person coming in and had
tennis as an individual sport," Tan
explained. "I didn't really turn to
anybody for help if I needed it and
I tried to solve it on my own. Being
on the tennis team [at Stanford]
has helped a ton. It helped me learn
the team aspect a lot better and
that I wasn't just playing for my
self. I was playing for the team."
For Dillon, having Tan there to
grow and transition with as well
as to play with has been neces
sary and valuable support.
"When I first met her, she was
quieter and more reserved," Dillon
said. "It's been really wonderful to
see her be more independent, as
sertive. It's been really cool having
someone there to grow with and go
through this experience with."
Dillon may say she's your classic
underdog story, but there is more
to her than that. She turned down
scholarship offers from New Mexi
co, Santa Clara and Denver to walk
on to the Stanford team her fresh
man year, committed to being "the
best practice partner, the best team
mate" and to "do whatever I can
outside of the tennis court to help
the team."
After a year, she began earning
more playing time. After two, she
was awarded a scholarship from the
coaching staff. She is now a deter
mined and vocal leader her senior
year. So far she owns a career
record of 31-32 in singles.
"I feel like an underdog and I
like feeling like an underdog,"
Dillon said. "I never want to feel
complacent. I think the second
you feel complacent is when you

stop growing."
Dillon has used her story and
dedication to Stanford to inspire the
rest of her teammates to greater
levels of commitment.
"Natalie is a very hard worker,"
Tan described. "With her improve
ment from freshman year to now, it's
very drastic and you can see how
much effort she's put in for the team
and how much she cares about the
team and in that sense I feel like it's
rubbed off on us as a class and us as
a team."
Both of the graduating women
have bright futures ahead of them
off the court, although tennis will
maintain some presence in their
next chapters. Natalie will work
next year at Goldman Sachs in the
Bay Area. Stacey will take a job in
the Information Systems Depart
ment of Toyota in Southern Califor
nia. Both plan to keep tennis in them
lives in some way or another.

"I think playing tennis is very
much ingrained in my identity as a
person," Dillon said. "I'm not ready
to give tennis up. I don't want to. It's
a sport you can play your whole life,
so why stop playing when I'm 21?"
They are quick to admit that
leaving their teammates will be one
of the hardest challenges about
graduation. Both graduated and cur
rent players have served as role
models for Dillon and Tan in their
personal growth. Fortunately, there

still remains the NCAA Tournament
and both are excited for the opportu
nities they'll have in their last couple
weeks in Cardinal and White.
"We're all working so hard, put
ting in so much effort and we spend
a ton of time together," Tan said.
"Having that ultimate common goal
in the end and it being so close, it
brings us a lot closer."
The arrival of NCAAs means the
end of the school year and, unique to
this year, the fast-approaching date

of graduation. Both Tan and Dillon
are excited about their lives after
college but say that Stanford will
stay with them in the lessons they
have learned and the people they
have met.
"One of the great things about
Stanford and great things about be
ing a student-athlete is that it does
promote being well-rounded," Dil
lon said. "You're not just a student
here, you're not just an athlete.
Everyone here is a mini Renais
sance-man or -woman. I always feel
here that I constantly have to keep
pushing and not just in one direc
tion. It's that attitude that you
shouldn't be complacent. [That's]
the biggest thing Stanford has
taught me and that will continue to
be ingrained with me for a long time
to come."

Senior Natalie Dillon (above) walked on to the team her freshman year, despite having scholarship offers from multiple schools. In her four years
on the Farm, she has worked hard to become a great 'practice partner' and teammate and, along the way, earned a scholarship after two years.
Seniors Stacey Tan and Na
talie Dillon of the Stanford
women's tennis team have
seen their share of change
and development through
their four years on the Farm, lead
ing to memorable victories, a little
frustration and a lot of hard work.
"It's been an incredible jour
ney," Dillon said. "Stanford was so
much of a dream school for me.
Since I was five years old, my
grandparents would take me here.
When you see all the families
around here, I was one of those
kids. I didn't know any other school
apart from Stanford which was a
blessing and a curse."
The Class of 2013 has experi
enced success on the court, starting
their careers by winning the NCAA
Team National Championship. The
next year, the team made it to the fi
nals again before losing to the
Florida Gators. Tan appeared in the

NCAA Singles Championship title
match in 2011, becoming the lowest
ranked player to compete in the
championship match as No. 43, and
she also played in last year's NCAA
Singles Championship. Dillon cap
tured the Pac-10 Championships
Invitational doubles title with Mal
lory Burdette in 2011; both players
have won a share of the Pac-12 title
three times. Most importantly, the
Class of 2013 holds a 7-1 record
against Cal.
"It's kind of hard to believe how
fast it went by," Tan said. "This is
our last chance at NCAAs, last year
to be here. But it's with a great
group of people each year and I
don't think I would have changed
that."
Before this year, there was a
third member of the Class of 2013.

Although senior Stacey Tan (above) has predominantly been a role-player during her four years at Stanford,
she made history in 2011 when she became the lowest ranked player to advance to the NCAA singles final.
Two years later, she is preparing to compete for the doubles title at the NCAA Championships.
clinched the NCAA title her fresh
man year, won the NCAA doubles
title with Hilary Barte her sopho
more year and again her junior
year with Nicole Gibbs. She was al
so the runner-up in the NCAA sin
gles title last season, losing to
teammate Gibbs in the final. Her
decision to not return for her senior
year came after she reached the
third round of the 2012 U.S. Open
and lost only to third-seeded Maria
Sharapova.
"I wish Mallory could have been
here," Tan said, "but she made the
decision she needed to. She's also
been coming out to matches when
she can; she was there at the Cal
match. She's been doing a great job
of keeping in touch with us which
makes her feel like she's here with
out being physically here."
Tan had been groomed for top
tier tennis: She was a talented re
cruit coming in her freshman year
and a player comfortable being on
her own. She has a 108-35 record so
far during her singles career at
Stanford. Her biggest challenge
playing for the Cardinal was learn
ing that winning was no longer de
fined by her personal success alone,
but by that of her teammates as
well.
"I was a very independent, indi
vidual person coming in and had
tennis as an individual sport," Tan
explained. "I didn't really turn to
anybody for help if I needed it and
I tried to solve it on my own. Being
on the tennis team [at Stanford]
has helped a ton. It helped me learn
the team aspect a lot better and
that I wasn't just playing for my
self. I was playing for the team."
For Dillon, having Tan there to
grow and transition with as well
as to play with has been neces
sary and valuable support.
"When I first met her, she was
quieter and more reserved," Dillon
said. "It's been really wonderful to
see her be more independent, as
sertive. It's been really cool having
someone there to grow with and go
through this experience with."
Dillon may say she's your classic
underdog story, but there is more
to her than that. She turned down
scholarship offers from New Mexi
co, Santa Clara and Denver to walk
on to the Stanford team her fresh
man year, committed to being "the
best practice partner, the best team
mate" and to "do whatever I can
outside of the tennis court to help
the team."
After a year, she began earning
more playing time. After two, she
was awarded a scholarship from the
coaching staff. She is now a deter
mined and vocal leader her senior
year. So far she owns a career
record of 31-32 in singles.
"I feel like an underdog and I
like feeling like an underdog,"
Dillon said. "I never want to feel
complacent. I think the second
you feel complacent is when you

stop growing."
Dillon has used her story and
dedication to Stanford to inspire the
rest of her teammates to greater
levels of commitment.
"Natalie is a very hard worker,"
Tan described. "With her improve
ment from freshman year to now, it's
very drastic and you can see how
much effort she's put in for the team
and how much she cares about the
team and in that sense I feel like it's
rubbed off on us as a class and us as
a team."
Both of the graduating women
have bright futures ahead of them
off the court, although tennis will
maintain some presence in their
next chapters. Natalie will work
next year at Goldman Sachs in the
Bay Area. Stacey will take a job in
the Information Systems Depart
ment of Toyota in Southern Califor
nia. Both plan to keep tennis in them
lives in some way or another.

"I think playing tennis is very
much ingrained in my identity as a
person," Dillon said. "I'm not ready
to give tennis up. I don't want to. It's
a sport you can play your whole life,
so why stop playing when I'm 21?"
They are quick to admit that
leaving their teammates will be one
of the hardest challenges about
graduation. Both graduated and cur
rent players have served as role
models for Dillon and Tan in their
personal growth. Fortunately, there

still remains the NCAA Tournament
and both are excited for the opportu
nities they'll have in their last couple
weeks in Cardinal and White.
"We're all working so hard, put
ting in so much effort and we spend
a ton of time together," Tan said.
"Having that ultimate common goal
in the end and it being so close, it
brings us a lot closer."
