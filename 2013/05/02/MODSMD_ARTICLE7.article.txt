# FINAL CHAPTER
## TAN, DILLON REFLECT ON THEIR FOUR YEARS ON THE FARM 
### WILL SEATON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seniors Stacey Tan and Na
talie Dillon of the Stanford
women's tennis team have
seen their share of change
and development through
their four years on the Farm, lead
ing to memorable victories, a little
frustration and a lot of hard work.
"It's been an incredible jour
ney," Dillon said. "Stanford was so
much of a dream school for me.
Since I was five years old, my
grandparents would take me here.
When you see all the families
around here, I was one of those
kids. I didn't know any other school
apart from Stanford which was a
blessing and a curse."
The Class of 2013 has experi
enced success on the court, starting
their careers by winning the NCAA
Team National Championship. The
next year, the team made it to the fi
nals again before losing to the
Florida Gators. Tan appeared in the

NCAA Singles Championship title
match in 2011, becoming the lowest
ranked player to compete in the
championship match as No. 43, and
she also played in last year's NCAA
Singles Championship. Dillon cap
tured the Pac-10 Championships
Invitational doubles title with Mal
lory Burdette in 2011; both players
have won a share of the Pac-12 title
three times. Most importantly, the
Class of 2013 holds a 7-1 record
against Cal.
"It's kind of hard to believe how
fast it went by," Tan said. "This is
our last chance at NCAAs, last year
to be here. But it's with a great
group of people each year and I
don't think I would have changed
that."
Before this year, there was a
third member of the Class of 2013.
Mallory Burdette was one of the
biggest contributors to the Stan
ford program during her three-year
stint on the Farm before deciding to
try her luck at the pro circuit. She

she made history in 2011 when she became the lowest ranked player to advance to the NCAA singles final.
