## SEEING GREEN The
						EPA's Procrastination Problem

lam a procrastinator. Frankly,
most of us are, to some extent.
(And if you're one of those rare
get-the-job-done-immediately
types, feel free to gloat quietly in
your corner.)
But checking Facebook several
dozen times when I should be writ
ing this column or pulling the occa
sional exam cram session is nothing
compared to the massive dawdling
job that the United States Environ
mental Protection Agency is doing
when it comes to regulating green
house gas emissions.
Late last month, the EPA
missed its own deadline to impose a
new rule on carbon dioxide emis
sions from new power plants. The
"New Source Performance Stan
dard" would have applied only to
plants built after the rule's pas
sage, limiting their emissions to
1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per
megawatt-hour of electricity gener
ated. The emissions cap, while plau
sible for natural gas-fired plants
and, of course, for renewable ener
gy sources, would have halted con
struction of coal-fired power plants,
at least until technology improves.
This latest bureaucratic blunder
is only the latest stall in a series of
legal battles stretching back 14
years.
Back in 1999, before most
Americans had even heard of glob
al warming, the EPA was peti
tioned to regulate greenhouse gas
emissions from new motor vehicles.
It took a decade for the petition and
its associated lawsuits culminat
ing in a Supreme Court ruling to
force the EPA to agree that, yes,
greenhouse gas emissions pose a
threat to the American public and
the environment. And, under the
Clean Air Act, the EPA now had le
gal standing to regulate these emis
sions.

Of course, deciding you ought to
do something and actually doing it
are two different things.
It was 2011 before any regula
tions came into force, and most of
2012 was consumed by promises
and proposals, followed by this
year's ball-dropping. The pattern is
frustratingly predictable: The EPA
stalls. Lawsuits are filed to force
the Agency's hand. Years are spent
in courtrooms before the EPA is
legally compelled to take action. At
least 10 states are threatening to
sue over this latest episode, accus
ing the EPA of failing to take action
in the face of scientific consensus
that the agency itself has acknowl
edged.
But for every environmentally
proactive state, there's a slough of
opposing commercial interests.
By doing nothing, the EPA up
holds the status quo and a very
comfortable status quo it is, partic
ularly for the oil and gas industry.
Obviously, those who make their
living off our addiction to fossil fu
els would hate to see their profits
damped by restrictions on the car
bon dioxide inevitably emitted by
combustion reaction. And the rest
of us cringe at the thought of rising
prices or restrictions on our energy
consumption. That's why we cling
to phrases like "clean coal" and the
idea that we'll be able to use Amer
ica's abundant coal reserves in a fu-

ture, zero-emissions lifestyle.
Unfortunately, "clean coal" is a
myth, at least for now.
Certainly, there is such a thing
as "cleaner coal." After all, "cleanli
ness" used to refer to the degree of
secondary pollution associated with
coal power plants, like asthma-in
ducing soot, acid rain and smog. By
adding scrubbers, increasing
smokestack height and taking some
pre-processing steps, the coal in
dustry cleaned up in part (under
the supervision of none other than
the EPA). But cleaning coal of car
bon emissions is a much harder
task.

When politicians bandy about
the term "clean coal," they're usu
ally referring to carbon capture
and storage (CCS) technology. In
theory, CCS is a multi-step process
that collects carbon dioxide emis
sions at their generation site, pack
ages them up and stashes them
somewhere safe (for example,
tucked away in geological forma
tions or chemically transformed in
to stable carbonate compounds).
And it does work in practice just
not at the scale coal-fired power
plants would need to meet the
EPA's new standard.

Where CCS technology is ad
vancing, so too are concerns: How
do the additional energy require
ments of capture and transport af
fect the efficiency of electricity gen
eration? Which geological features
are stable enough to store carbon
dioxide? How securely will they
hold it, and for how long?
So perhaps it's no wonder that
the EPA is waffling. The United
States has a pressing need to join
the rest of the developed world in
facing the realities of climate
change. Prevention or, at least,
reduction in magnitude â€”is the
first, best solution. But if the tech
nology's not there, and a world
without coal-fired power is too
frightening, what else is there to do
but wait?
