# NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND
## Don't Bother Reading This Column 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
When I came back from Cape
Town this quarter, I expect
ed to be veiy sad about be
ing back on campus. I had thought
that I would hate to return from liv
ing in an urban setting, from living in
"the real world" to a campus whose
isolation grew to feel stifling in the
weeks and months before I left.

While I did not experience those
things in the first few weeks of the
quarter, I am feeling them quite
heavily right now and for rea
sons that have very little to do with
my time in South Africa.
I am at a complete loss of words
to explain how I have been feeling
this week in any coherent way.
Some words or phrases that
work: "detached," "my head is not on
campus," "wishing the quarter were
over," "wishing graduation were
here already," "wishing I could move
out of the United States already."
Since I returned Sunday from
spending 10 days off campus, I have
been experiencing the feelings and
issues I expected to but did not
experience initially having re
turned from Cape Town.
Withdrawal, sadness to be on
campus (even a loathing sometimes)
and an apathy about or lack of moti
vation for things like school work or
extracurriculars have rounded out
this week.

I am seemingly out of things to
say for this column. I wanted to re
spond further to Jason Lupatkin's
op-ed from two weeks ago that at
tacked minority students. I wanted
to continue sharing the lessons I
learned in Cape Town. I wanted to
discuss some of the things I learned
over the last two weeks during my
absence from campus.

I would still like to do all of these
things, but I do not have the energy.
Prom April 17 to 27, I was a
scholar at the 2013 School of Au
thentic Journalism, which focused
on the intersections of journalism
and nonviolent civil resistance. With
39 other scholars who were working
in some combination of media and
community organizing around the
globe, we spent 10 days learning
from people who have fought large
battles for humanity and won.
These 10 days were a gift from
the marginalization I tend to feel on
campus or in the United States. For
just under two weeks, I was able to
live free from the internalized and
external shackles of being black in
the context of American racism
where I didn't need to feel as suspi
cious about every interaction I had
with another person.
For just under two weeks, I was
able to be in a place where revolu
tionary politics were not isolated as

some weird, fringe phenomenon but
celebrated for fulfilling the etymo
logical meaning of "radical" and ad
dressing the roots of structural op
pression. And for just under two
weeks, I was able to feel safe and
comfortable enough with my sur
roundings that I opened up to oth
ers, enough to fall in love for the
first time.

So while I am not completely sure
whether I am having a delayed reac
tion returning from Cape Town, I can
almost certainly say the detachment
I feel is the result of my experiences
at the School of Authentic Journal
ism over the last two weeks.

I hope to elaborate further on
these topics from a better mental
space sometime soon —in next
week's column, I'll further discuss
how this week's detachment from
campus life the detachment that
made it so difficult to write a column
this week flows from my experi
ences at the School of Authentic
Journalism.

Kristian extends his apologies to
those of you who have suffered
through this largely rhetorical exer
cise in saying nothing by talking
about saying nothing in order to fill
space in a newspaper (but he did
warn you!). Write him, anytime at
