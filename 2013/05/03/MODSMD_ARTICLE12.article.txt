## Enjoy your retirement, Josh Nunes 
### Sam Fisher 
Back in August, I never
could have envisioned that
this day would come so
soon. In fact, there's so
much I never would have
expected. But after a football season
that featured a crazy series of events
and an even crazier offseason injury
it's time to say goodbye to you, senior
quarterback Josh Nunes, at least as a
football player.
About 16 months ago, as Andrew
Luck's Stanford career ended with an
Oklahoma State field goal, a fear of the
Mure began to creep over me. I be
lieved in life after Gerhart. I believed in
life after Harbaugh. But I must admit,
I was skeptical of life after Luck.
Tb complicate things, none of us
well, none of us outside the team
knew who was going to be the one to
replace Luck. And as a member of
the Class of 2014, I'd be lying if I did
n't tell you that I was quietly pulling
for my classmate Brett Nottingham.
But you wouldn't let that happen,
Josh. From everything I've heard in
interviews and casual conversations
off the field, you fought to win that
job. You were in the film room study
ing all offseason. Your center, Sam
Schwartzstein 'l2 M.A. 'l3, de
scribed you most eloquently when
he said that you became not just a
student, but indeed a teacher of the
game by the time September came.
And because of all of that, when
your head coach David Shaw named
you the starter and Nottingham the
backup, I wasn't upset. I had come to
believe in Josh Nunes. Sure, you
weren't going to be Luck — anyone
who expected that was crazy— but
you were good enough to be a win
ner. You had to be. You worked so
hard, you're a good guy and you
were so focused; it had to work.

But sometimes football, like life,
isn't fair. The San Jose State game
scared me. The Duke game, while
better, still had me questioning
whether things were going to work
out. By halftime of USC, the press
box was abuzz with the sentiment
that Nottingham would be the quar
terback for the start of the third
quarter.

You didn't give up though. When
you didn't have it with your arm, you
somehow and I don't think any of
us will ever know how this worked
made enough plays with your feet
to keep Stanford in the game. And
that wobbly pass to your classmate,
tight end Zach Ertz, hit him in a
good enough spot for the game-win
ning score.

Who were we to doubt you, Josh?
That was the spark you needed. But
then we were taken back to reality
with the loss at Washington. You
went 18-37 for 170 yards, no touch
downs, one interception. Surely that
was the end; you couldn't recover
from that. But Coach Shaw didn't
agree, and you proved him right
with the best game of your career
against Arizona, saving the day in
the dominant defense's worst per
formance of the season.
Who knew that the Arizona win
would be the last high moment of
your career? Three weeks later, af
ter the offense struggled against
weak Cal and Washington State
teams, when you didn't score on
your first two drives against Col
orado, the door was finally open for
someone to take your job. And soph
omore Kevin Hogan did just that,
with a masterful performance
against an admittedly weak Buf
faloes team.

And that was it. It's amazing how
fickle a football career can be. But
none of us could have predicted how
yours would officially end. As Anto
nio Gonzalez of the Associated Press
reported, your career ended with
your work off the field. A bench
press accident causing the nastiest
of upper body injuries robbed you of
your last year playing football.
So now it's time for closure,
something that we really never had
with the rapid, mid-game ascension
of Hogan. I'm not sure what the
words to say are. You'd be the first
to admit that your season, and now
career, did not go as well as you
hoped. Too many times, the ball just
didn't get to where it had to be. But
once senior running back Stepfan
Taylor picked up the first down to
clinch the Rose Bowl victory on New
Year's Day, who could've asked for
this season to have gone any differ
ently?

Anyone who claims that a Pac-12
title and a Rose Bowl win wasn't ex
ceeding expectations for the first

year of life after Luck is kidding
himself. We'll never be sure exact
ly what would've happened if you
made a few more completions
against Washington or Notre
Dame, or if Nottingham beat you
out in camp. But what we do know
is that it all worked out.
So enjoy your retirement.

quarterback Josh Nunes, at least as a
football player.
About 16 months ago, as Andrew
Luck's Stanford career ended with an
Oklahoma State field goal, a fear of the
Mure began to creep over me. I be
lieved in life after Gerhart. I believed in
life after Harbaugh. But I must admit,
I was skeptical of life after Luck.
Tb complicate things, none of us
well, none of us outside the team
knew who was going to be the one to
replace Luck. And as a member of
the Class of 2014, I'd be lying if I did
n't tell you that I was quietly pulling
for my classmate Brett Nottingham.
But you wouldn't let that happen,
Josh. From everything I've heard in
interviews and casual conversations
off the field, you fought to win that
job. You were in the film room study
ing all offseason. Your center, Sam
Schwartzstein 'l2 M.A. 'l3, de
scribed you most eloquently when
he said that you became not just a
student, but indeed a teacher of the
game by the time September came.
And because of all of that, when
your head coach David Shaw named
you the starter and Nottingham the
backup, I wasn't upset. I had come to
believe in Josh Nunes. Sure, you
weren't going to be Luck — anyone
who expected that was crazy— but
you were good enough to be a win
ner. You had to be. You worked so
hard, you're a good guy and you
were so focused; it had to work.

But sometimes football, like life,
isn't fair. The San Jose State game
scared me. The Duke game, while
better, still had me questioning
whether things were going to work
out. By halftime of USC, the press
box was abuzz with the sentiment
that Nottingham would be the quar
terback for the start of the third
quarter.

You didn't give up though. When
you didn't have it with your arm, you
somehow and I don't think any of
us will ever know how this worked
made enough plays with your feet
to keep Stanford in the game. And
that wobbly pass to your classmate,
tight end Zach Ertz, hit him in a
good enough spot for the game-win
ning score.

Who were we to doubt you, Josh?
That was the spark you needed. But
then we were taken back to reality
with the loss at Washington. You
went 18-37 for 170 yards, no touch
downs, one interception. Surely that
was the end; you couldn't recover
from that. But Coach Shaw didn't
agree, and you proved him right
with the best game of your career
against Arizona, saving the day in
the dominant defense's worst per
formance of the season.
Who knew that the Arizona win
would be the last high moment of
your career? Three weeks later, af
ter the offense struggled against
weak Cal and Washington State
teams, when you didn't score on
your first two drives against Col
orado, the door was finally open for
someone to take your job. And soph
omore Kevin Hogan did just that,
with a masterful performance
against an admittedly weak Buf
faloes team.

And that was it. It's amazing how
fickle a football career can be. But
none of us could have predicted how
yours would officially end. As Anto
nio Gonzalez of the Associated Press
reported, your career ended with
your work off the field. A bench
press accident causing the nastiest
of upper body injuries robbed you of
your last year playing football.
So now it's time for closure,
something that we really never had
with the rapid, mid-game ascension
of Hogan. I'm not sure what the
words to say are. You'd be the first
to admit that your season, and now
career, did not go as well as you
hoped. Too many times, the ball just
didn't get to where it had to be. But
once senior running back Stepfan
Taylor picked up the first down to
clinch the Rose Bowl victory on New
Year's Day, who could've asked for
this season to have gone any differ
ently?

Anyone who claims that a Pac-12
title and a Rose Bowl win wasn't ex
ceeding expectations for the first

year of life after Luck is kidding
himself. We'll never be sure exact
ly what would've happened if you
made a few more completions
against Washington or Notre
Dame, or if Nottingham beat you
out in camp. But what we do know
is that it all worked out.
So enjoy your retirement.
