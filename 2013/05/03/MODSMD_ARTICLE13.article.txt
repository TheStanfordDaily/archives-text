# IT'S CRUNCH TIME
## CRUCIAL SERIES IN TEMPE FOR CARD BASEBALL 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
For the first time in three years,
the last month of Stanford basebal
l's season won't be about fighting
for a conference title or the right to
host a Super Regional.
This time around, it's about
making the postseason.
The No. 25 Cardinal (24-15, 9-9
Pac-12) is at risk of missing out on
a regional berth for the first time
since 2009 and just the third time in
the last 20 years. After being swept
at No. 7 Oregon last weekend,

Stanford's RPI (No. 97) has sunken
low enough that some predict that
the Cardinal must win all four of its
remaining series including tilts
with No. 16 Arizona State, No. 5
Oregon State and No. 11 UCLA
to just make it to the postseason.
Stanford will try to begin filling
that tall order tonight in Tempe,
where it faces a Sun Devil (29-12-1,
11-7) team that hits as well as any
in the conference and has won sev
en of eight games coming into the
weekend.
The Cardinal has shown it can
get hot when it needs to. After
starting the season 11-8, it rattled
off four straight conference series
wins against Pac-12 bottom-feed
ers to put itself back in the NCAA
Tournament contenders.
But the four teams left for Stan
ford to play are a whole different
level of competition, as Oregon con

clusively demonstrated in Eugene
last weekend.
The Cardinal was competitive in
all three losses by the scores of
2-1, 6-4 and 4-3 but good teams
find away to win close games, and
the Ducks were clearly the better
team on their home field.
"I think the thing that hurt us
most was our defense this past
weekend," said junior catcher Brant
Whiting. "We had a couple key er
rors in key situations, especially
that Friday game, and we're just go
ing to try and go into this weekend
and play good defense, keep pitch
ing the way we're pitching."
Oregon's small-ball, however,
couldn't be more different from the
slugging Sun Devils' approach at
the plate. Arizona State leads the
Pac-12 in home runs (29), slugging
percentage (.450) and doubles (93)
and ranks second in scoring with

6.3 runs per game. Maybe that will
play right into the hands of the
Cardinal, which upset the Pac-12's
top scoring team, Arizona, at home
two weeks ago before falling short
against the less-flashy Ducks.
The Sun Devils have a penchant
for extra-base hitting. Local prod
uct Trever Allen is tied for third in
the conference with seven home runs
(behind Stanford's Brian Ragira,
who is second with eight) and Ari
zona State ranks in the top 20 in Di
vision I in both doubles and triples.
If anyone can put a stop to that,
it's senior Mark Appel, who has
made a case once again this season
to be the No. 1 pick in the upcom
ing MLB draft. But will Appel have
any defense behind him? Only 13 of
the 22 runs he has allowed this sea
son have been earned, and those
other nine tallies have accounted
for a large part of his 7-3 record
great for most starters, but a bit
pedestrian for the ace after his 10-
2 mark last season.

With sophomore John
Hochstatter (3-1) back from a four
game suspension, the Cardinal will
have at least two game-tested
starters ready for the weekend.
But should either of them falter,
the fate of the series could very
well rest on the right arm of fresh
man Daniel Starwalt, who im
pressed in his first career start last
weekend by giving up just three
hits in 5.1 innings.
For Stanford at the plate, it will
be all about getting the ball in play
against an Arizona State team that
is one of the few in the conference
with a worse fielding percentage
(.962) than the Cardinal (.969).
That will especially be a challenge
on Saturday, when Stanford
squares off against one of only four
10-game winners in college base
ball, freshman lefty phenom Ryan
Kellogg (10-0).
Tonight's series opener begins
at 7 p.m. and will be televised on
ESPNU, which also covered the
Cardinal's walk-off loss at Oregon
last Sunday. After an unusual Sat
urday evening start at 6:30 p.m.,
the three-game set concludes on
Sunday at 12:30 p.m.

last weekend.
The Cardinal was competitive in
all three losses by the scores of
2-1, 6-4 and 4-3 but good teams
find away to win close games, and
the Ducks were clearly the better
team on their home field.
"I think the thing that hurt us
most was our defense this past
weekend," said junior catcher Brant
Whiting. "We had a couple key er
rors in key situations, especially
that Friday game, and we're just go
ing to try and go into this weekend
and play good defense, keep pitch
ing the way we're pitching."
Oregon's small-ball, however,
couldn't be more different from the
slugging Sun Devils' approach at
the plate. Arizona State leads the
Pac-12 in home runs (29), slugging
percentage (.450) and doubles (93)
and ranks second in scoring with

6.3 runs per game. Maybe that will
play right into the hands of the
Cardinal, which upset the Pac-12's
top scoring team, Arizona, at home
two weeks ago before falling short
against the less-flashy Ducks.
The Sun Devils have a penchant
for extra-base hitting. Local prod
uct Trever Allen is tied for third in
the conference with seven home runs
(behind Stanford's Brian Ragira,
who is second with eight) and Ari
zona State ranks in the top 20 in Di
vision I in both doubles and triples.
If anyone can put a stop to that,
it's senior Mark Appel, who has
made a case once again this season
to be the No. 1 pick in the upcom
ing MLB draft. But will Appel have
any defense behind him? Only 13 of
the 22 runs he has allowed this sea
son have been earned, and those
other nine tallies have accounted
for a large part of his 7-3 record
great for most starters, but a bit
pedestrian for the ace after his 10-
2 mark last season.

With sophomore John
Hochstatter (3-1) back from a four
game suspension, the Cardinal will
have at least two game-tested
starters ready for the weekend.
But should either of them falter,
the fate of the series could very
well rest on the right arm of fresh
man Daniel Starwalt, who im
pressed in his first career start last
weekend by giving up just three
hits in 5.1 innings.
For Stanford at the plate, it will
be all about getting the ball in play
against an Arizona State team that
is one of the few in the conference
with a worse fielding percentage
(.962) than the Cardinal (.969).
That will especially be a challenge
on Saturday, when Stanford
squares off against one of only four
10-game winners in college base
ball, freshman lefty phenom Ryan
Kellogg (10-0).
Tonight's series opener begins
at 7 p.m. and will be televised on
ESPNU, which also covered the
Cardinal's walk-off loss at Oregon
last Sunday. After an unusual Sat
urday evening start at 6:30 p.m.,
the three-game set concludes on
Sunday at 12:30 p.m.
