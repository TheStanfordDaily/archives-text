# TRACK AND FIELD
## Championship season begins in LA 
### ANNA BLUE STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford track and field
squad heads to the Pac-12 Champi
onships in Los Angeles this week
end with its eyes focused on Ore
gon, which has won both the male
and female meet in each of the past
four years. Last year, the Stanford
women (124 points) finished sec
ond to the Ducks, who tallied 200.5

points to win the meet. The Oregon
men also won their side of the meet
with 124 points, while the Cardinal
men recorded 78 points to take
fifth place.
The Pac-12 Championships is
one of the culminating meets of the
season for the team and has huge
implications for the NCAA Cham
pionships in June.
"As long as we all trust in the
work that we've been putting in for

months and just focus on getting
out and competing, Pac-12 is going
to be a great stepping stone to the
West Regional in Austin," said
freshman distance runner Justin
Brinkley.
The Cardinal is coming off a
strong performance last weekend
in several meets. At the Payton
Jordan Invitational, which attract
ed some of the world's top track
talent to Stanford's campus, Cardi

nal runners produced three U.S.
Championship A' Standards and
four additions to the Stanford's all
time top-10 lists.
Amy Weissenbach continued
her spectacular freshman cam
paign by winning the women's 800-
meter race. Although pinned to the
rail with 200 meters left, Weis
senbach broke away down the
stretch to post a U.S. 'A' standard
time of 2:04.24, which was the sec
ond-best in Stanford's history.
"If there's one thing I've
learned over the course of the sea
son, it's always worse if I panic and
try to shuffle around and waste a
lot of energy with tiny moves that
don't really do much," Weis
senbach told GoStanford.com. "So
I had to trust that it would start to
open up, and tried to relax until I
saw an opening."
In the 1500-meter race, senior
Justine Federonic took second
with a time of 4:14.69, the seventh
fastest time in Stanford history.
"Justine is a phenom in prac
tice," Weissenbach said. "She's
awesome in training, always really
aggressive. She holds me account
able, for sure. I can't slack off in
workouts."

Junior Michael Atchoo and sen
ior Tyler Stutzman also turned in
personal records in the 1,500-me
ter race. In their respective 5,000-
meter races, junior Jessica Tonn
ran the fifth-fastest time in school
history while fellow junior Erik Ol
son posted a U.S. 'B' standard
time.

At other meets last weekend,
Stanford added four more addi
tions to its all-time lists. At the Tri
ton Invitational in La Jolle, Calif.,
senior Alyssa Wisdom moved up to
No. 3 on the women's shot put all
time chart with a throw of 54-4 and

3/4. Freshmen men's javelin
throwers Charlie Kerr and An
drew Rondema also cracked the
top-10 list while classmate Kristyn
Williams posted the seventh
fastest time in history in the
women's 400.

"Not only did the performance
make me more confident about my
abilities and what I can contribute
to Stanford track," Williams said,
"but ... hopefully this accomplish
ment creates momentum that will
carry me through the remainder of
the season."
Stanford head coach Chris Mil
tenburg has been pushing diversi
ty all season, and the Cardinal will
need all of its athletes to be at top
strength at the conference champi
onship. Kerr describes the track
team as a "series of working
parts," with each member con
tributing to team unity and suc
cess.

The biggest challenge facing
the team as they head into this
weekend, emphasized by runners
and coaches alike, is mental and
physical fatigue. But despite the
rigors of a long season, the team is
confident that it will reach its peak
this weekend.

"With the trajectory and grow
ing momentum of the underclass
men performances over the past
couple of weeks," Kerr said, "I
think we really are capable of going
down to Los Angeles and turning
some heads toward the new-and
improved Stanford track and field
program."
