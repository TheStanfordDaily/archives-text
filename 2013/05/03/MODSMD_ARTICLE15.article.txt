# Card seeks revenge against Cal
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It may not determine the fate of
The Axe, but plenty is still on the
line this weekend for Stanford
against Cal. The No. 16 Cardinal
softball squad (32-17, 9-9 Pac-12)
heads to Berkeley for a three-game
series against the No. 12 Golden
Bears (35-12, 9-9 Pac-12) that will
likely decide the Cardinal's destina
tion for the first round of the post
season. A successful trip for Stan
ford may earn them a postseason
regional in Palo Alto, a valuable
commodity that provides both fan
support and much-needed rest
from travel. Standing in the way,
however, is the Cardinal's Bay Area
rival.

Last year, Stanford hosted Cal
for a three-game series at home to
open Pac-12 play. Despite coming in
hot with a 25-3 record and a No. 9
national ranking, the Cardinal was
defeated in three consecutive
games by scores of 9-0,4-3, and 8-0.
Stanford had not been shut out in a
single game prior to that series, so
the fact that the offense mustered
just three runs in the series was
shocking.
This year, Stanford has the op
portunity to seek payback and beat
the Bears on then- home turf. A se
ries win would vault Stanford ahead
of Cal in Pac-12 play and put them
in prime position heading into the
postseason.
Stanford heads into the biggest
series of its season amid mixed re
cent results. After a dominant
sweep of the Utah Utes last week

end, the Cardinal fell to UC-Davis
5-4 on Wednesday. The Aggies ral
lied to score three runs in the bot
tom of the seventh inning and steal
the victory from Stanford's grasp.
The Cardinal has now lost three
straight non-conference matchups
against lower-ranked opponents.
One of the few positives to take
away from the game for the Cardi
nal was again the performance of
Kayla Bonstrom, who provided
three hits and two RBI in four at

bats. The freshman is currently
ninth in the Pac-12 with a .378 bat
ting average, and she has been es
pecially hot as of late with 11 hits in
her last 19 at-bats.
Fellow freshman Jess Plaza has
also been strong for the Cardinal in
her return from injury. The catcher
hit .625 with a .750 slugging per
centage last weekend against the
Utes.

Shortshop Jenna Rich recently
earned a spot in the top 10 on Stan

ford's career hits list. The senior,
who has posted 233 career hits, will
be looking to tack on more in what
is likely her last chance to face
Stanford's biggest rival.

Stanford will look to take advan
tage of Cal's pah- of freshman pitch
ers, Nisa Ontiveros and Nikki
Owens, who have taken the place of
injured senior ace Jolene Hender
son. Cal's dynamic power duo of

Freshman Kayla Bonstrom (left) has been one of the Cardinal's most consistent hitters this season with a
.378 batting average. Stanford will look to solidify its postseason position this weekend in Berkeley.
Cheyenne Cordes and Lindsey
Ziegenhirt, who have combined for
23 home runs and 79 RBI over the
course of the season, will try to pro
vide run support for then' young
pitchers.
The Cardinal will bring its own
duo of senior Teagan Gerhart and
freshman Kelsey Stevens to the
circle in Berkeley. Since the start
of April, Gerhart has allowed 42
runs in 64 innings of work, causing
her ERA to rise by more than a full
point. Although she suffered a
rough outing against UC-Davis,
Gerhart's form against Utah
she surrendered only one run in
two victories served as a re
minder as to why she is Stanford's
ace and one of the best pitchers in
the Pac-12. A good outing for Ger
hart against Cal could go a long
way in bringing her back to top
form just in time for the postseason.
Cal comes into the series reeling
from four straight losses, albeit
three of them were at the hands of
mighty No. 5 Arizona State. Before
the current losing streak, Cal had
yet to lose more than two games in
a row, so this series has heavy impli
cations for both squads.
Friday's first pitch is scheduled
for 3:00 p.m. Saturday's game will
begin at 1 p.m. before the series
concludes at noon on Sunday.

she surrendered only one run in
two victories served as a re
minder as to why she is Stanford's
ace and one of the best pitchers in
the Pac-12. A good outing for Ger
hart against Cal could go a long
way in bringing her back to top
form just in time for the postseason.
Cal comes into the series reeling
from four straight losses, albeit
three of them were at the hands of
mighty No. 5 Arizona State. Before
the current losing streak, Cal had
yet to lose more than two games in
a row, so this series has heavy impli
cations for both squads.
Friday's first pitch is scheduled
for 3:00 p.m. Saturday's game will
begin at 1 p.m. before the series
concludes at noon on Sunday.
