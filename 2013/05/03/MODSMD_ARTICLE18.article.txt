# THE 						STATE OF CINEMA
## Director Steven Soderbergh addresses lack of support in film industry 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY | STAFF WRITER 
Last Saturday afternoon, newly
retired director Steven
Soderbergh delivered a
thought-provoking, if somewhat
bleak, address on the "State of
Cinema": creativity is alive and well,
but the systems to support it and get it
seen by the world film studios
are failing. But on the bright side,
movies, America's third biggest export,
are "one of the few things that we do
that the world actually likes,"
Soderbergh said. Although initially
Soderbergh intended to only be seen
and heard by those in attendance,
after popular demand, he granted
SFIFF permission to post the video
and transcript of his talk online,
which you can now view. He gave his
speech with a self-deprecating sense of
humor, incisive metaphors and insider
anecdotes about his recent films like
"Side Effects," "Magic Mike,"
"Contagion" and "Behind the
Candelabra" to illustrate his points.
To frame the discussion,
Soderbergh first differentiated
between movies and cinema.
"A movie is something you see,
and cinema is something that's made.
It has nothing to do with the captured
medium, it doesn't have anything to
do with the where the screen is, if it's
in your bedroom, your iPad it
doesn't even really have to be a movie:
it could be a commercial, it could be
something on You Tube," Soderbergh
said. As a champion of digital cinema
and the first to release a film in cine
mas and in Video on Demand simul
taneously with "Bubble," this should
come as little surprise.
Soderbergh explained that "cine
ma is a specificity of vision; it's an
approach in which everything matters.
It's the polar opposite of generic or
arbitrary and the result is as unique as
a signature or a fingerprint. It isn't
made by a committee, and it isn't
made by a company, and it isn't made
by the audience. It means that if this
filmmaker didn't do it, it either
wouldn't exist at all, or it wouldn't
exist in anything like this form."
I was reminded, here, of the audio
commentary on "Solaris," where
Soderbergh and James Cameron agree

that had Cameron directed it, the
result would be a very different film.
Soderbergh reassures us that "as long
as you have filmmakers out there who
have that specific point of view, then
cinema is never going to disappear
completely."
But, Soderbergh expressed that,
regretfully, cinema "is under assault by
the studios and, from what I can tell,
with the full support of the audience.
The reasons for this, in my opinion,
are more economic than philosophi
cal, but when you add an ample
amount of fear and a lack of vision,
and a lack of leadership, you've got a
trajectory that I think is pretty difficult
to reverse."
Studio executives that make deci
sions about what gets made are less
and less knowledgeable or passionate
about film and they aren't hiring
experts to pick up the slack.
"Executives don't get punished for
making bombs the way that filmmak
ers do, and the result is there's no
turnover of new ideas there's no
new ideas about how to approach the
business or how to deal with talent or
material," Soderbergh said.
So, he asked, "How does a studio
decide what movies get made? One
thing they take into consideration is
the foreign market, obviously. It's
become very big. So that means, you
know, things that travel best are going
to be action-adventure, science fiction
... Obviously the bigger the budget,
the more people this thing is going to

have to appeal to the more homog
enized it's got to be, the more simpli
fied it's got to be.
"So things like cultural specificity
and narrative complexity, and, God
forbid, ambiguity: those become real
obstacles to the success of the film
here and abroad," Soderbergh said.
The solution he offered is that
the studios need to think "about
horses, not races" because the indus
try is totally talent-driven.
Soderbergh explained, "I think, if I
were to run a studio, I'd just be gath
ering the best filmmakers I could
find and sort of let them do their
thing within certain economic
parameters. So I would call Shane
Carruth, or Barry Jenkins or Amy
Seimetz and I'd bring them in [and
tell them] 'l'm going to let you make
three movies over five years, I'm going
to give you this much money in pro
duction costs, I'm going to dedicate
this much money on marketing
you can sort of proportion it how you
want, you can spend it all on one and
none on the other two go make
something.'"
But since no one will give him half
a billion dollars to run this experiment
(and though he did give a shout out to
Kickstarter), we can only hope that
someone will heed this advice so that
we can bring cinema back to the
movies. In the meantime, there's a
plethora of cinema to be seen at the
festival even if much of it won't
make it to the mainstream.

that the world actually likes,"
Soderbergh said. Although initially
Soderbergh intended to only be seen
and heard by those in attendance,
after popular demand, he granted
SFIFF permission to post the video
and transcript of his talk online,
which you can now view. He gave his
speech with a self-deprecating sense of
humor, incisive metaphors and insider
anecdotes about his recent films like
"Side Effects," "Magic Mike,"
"Contagion" and "Behind the
Candelabra" to illustrate his points.
To frame the discussion,
Soderbergh first differentiated
between movies and cinema.
"A movie is something you see,
and cinema is something that's made.
It has nothing to do with the captured
medium, it doesn't have anything to
do with the where the screen is, if it's
in your bedroom, your iPad it
doesn't even really have to be a movie:
it could be a commercial, it could be
something on You Tube," Soderbergh
said. As a champion of digital cinema
and the first to release a film in cine
mas and in Video on Demand simul
taneously with "Bubble," this should
come as little surprise.
Soderbergh explained that "cine
ma is a specificity of vision; it's an
approach in which everything matters.
It's the polar opposite of generic or
arbitrary and the result is as unique as
a signature or a fingerprint. It isn't
made by a committee, and it isn't
made by a company, and it isn't made
by the audience. It means that if this
filmmaker didn't do it, it either
wouldn't exist at all, or it wouldn't
exist in anything like this form."
I was reminded, here, of the audio
commentary on "Solaris," where
Soderbergh and James Cameron agree

that had Cameron directed it, the
result would be a very different film.
Soderbergh reassures us that "as long
as you have filmmakers out there who
have that specific point of view, then
cinema is never going to disappear
completely."
But, Soderbergh expressed that,
regretfully, cinema "is under assault by
the studios and, from what I can tell,
with the full support of the audience.
The reasons for this, in my opinion,
are more economic than philosophi
cal, but when you add an ample
amount of fear and a lack of vision,
and a lack of leadership, you've got a
trajectory that I think is pretty difficult
to reverse."
Studio executives that make deci
sions about what gets made are less
and less knowledgeable or passionate
about film and they aren't hiring
experts to pick up the slack.
"Executives don't get punished for
making bombs the way that filmmak
ers do, and the result is there's no
turnover of new ideas there's no
new ideas about how to approach the
business or how to deal with talent or
material," Soderbergh said.
So, he asked, "How does a studio
decide what movies get made? One
thing they take into consideration is
the foreign market, obviously. It's
become very big. So that means, you
know, things that travel best are going
to be action-adventure, science fiction
... Obviously the bigger the budget,
the more people this thing is going to

have to appeal to the more homog
enized it's got to be, the more simpli
fied it's got to be.
"So things like cultural specificity
and narrative complexity, and, God
forbid, ambiguity: those become real
obstacles to the success of the film
here and abroad," Soderbergh said.
The solution he offered is that
the studios need to think "about
horses, not races" because the indus
try is totally talent-driven.
Soderbergh explained, "I think, if I
were to run a studio, I'd just be gath
ering the best filmmakers I could
find and sort of let them do their
thing within certain economic
parameters. So I would call Shane
Carruth, or Barry Jenkins or Amy
Seimetz and I'd bring them in [and
tell them] 'l'm going to let you make
three movies over five years, I'm going
to give you this much money in pro
duction costs, I'm going to dedicate
this much money on marketing
you can sort of proportion it how you
want, you can spend it all on one and
none on the other two go make
something.'"
But since no one will give him half
a billion dollars to run this experiment
(and though he did give a shout out to
Kickstarter), we can only hope that
someone will heed this advice so that
we can bring cinema back to the
movies. In the meantime, there's a
plethora of cinema to be seen at the
festival even if much of it won't
make it to the mainstream.
