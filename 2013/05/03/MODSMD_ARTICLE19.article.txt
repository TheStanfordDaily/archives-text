# QUICK Tine films of the moment

### ALEXANDRA HEENEY | STAFF WRITER 
Jntermission will be covering the San Francisco International Film
Festival (SFIFF) over the next couple of weeks. Here is a look at some of
the films that will be showing throughout the festival

"Youth"
There are so many raw emotional
truths in Justine Malle's quietly
observed, feature film debut
"Youth." Twenty-year-old Juliette is
preparing for her exams when she
meets a seemingly-worldly-but
mosdy-insecure bullshitting boy
who catches her eye and plays with
her emotions. Things develop
sweetly and tentatively until he
shows his immaturity. At the same
time, she discovers her filmmaker
father is dying, and we watch as
she navigates the tricky waters of
her complicated family: her father
has had three children with three
different women, meaning there
are many relationships and feelings
to manage. We see how her father's
womanizing plays into her insecu
rities her father dated intimi
datingly beautiful women, yet
none of those relationships lasted.
She seems convinced that compas
sion in love affairs can't be expect
ed and that passion can be any
thing but fleeting. What unfolds
could be described as her sexual
awakening, but it's more compli
cated than that. "Youth" is more
about maturing emotionally than
it is about sex, which is why there
are many post-coital and pre-coital
scenes and nothing in between.
Friday, May 4, 6:45 p.m. and
Saturday, May 4, 1:30 p.m. at
Sundance Kabuki; director Malle
will be in attendance at both.
"Museum Hours"
Winner of this year's Golden Gate
Persistence of Vision award pre
sented last Sunday, Jem Cohen's
first narrative feature is a cross
between "Before Sunrise" and
"Summer Hours." It is a highly
intelligent, extremely watchable
exploration of what art is and
what it means to us, as well as the
role museums play. The film cen
ters on the Viennese
Kunsthistorisches Museum, where
Johann (Bobby Sommer) works
as a guard who keenly observes
the visitors and paintings. There,
he meets Anne (Mary Margaret
O'Hara), who is visiting the city
on a small budget to see her
cousin now in a vegetative state,
and they become friends. We are
reminded that public museums
like the Louvre were opened to
democratize art, and the film
attempts to help us rediscover
this: art is there to be looked at
and experienced, not just venerat
ed. We spend time looking at
many of the paintings both in
the museum and as posters in the
cafes visited as they are dis
cussed by experts, our protago
nists and the museum's visitors.

"Sofia's Last Ambulance"
This Bulgarian film is a day-in
the-life look at one of the few
remaining functioning ambu
lances in Sofia. We watch the
paramedic team driving through
the streets, answering calls and
dealing with a variety of unex
pected problems the enor
mous and frequent potholes that
shake the ambulance, the unreli
able dispatch system, calls that
abuse the system through a

series of vignettes. Much of the
team's time is spent dealing with
people, often those with self
inflicted problems: a mother calls
the team, for instance, to convince
her son to stop using heroin.
They handle these obstacles with
surprisingly calmness, despite the
frustration of being kept from
real emergencies. Patients come
and go we never even see them
and paramedics don't get to
see the cases all the way through,
but there's always someone new
who needs help. Friday, May 3,
3:30 p.m. at Sundance Kabuki

for free the libraries provided
access and Google started tam
pering with copyright scan
ning and uploading in-copyright
books without the knowledge or
consent of the authors. It's a com
plicated dilemma: Google is help
ing the world by providing access
to a digital world library, but is
the cost copyright infringe
ments and Google's monopoly on
world knowledge too great?
Through excellent interviews with
Google executives, copyright
experts, authors, chief librarians
and others, the film starts to
answer this. Sunday, May 5, 6:30
p.m. at Sundance Kabuki

"Google and the World Brain"
"Google and the World Brain"
examines what it means that, to
quote an interviewee, "Google
thinks of itself as an NGO that
just happens to sell stocks" in the
context of the Google Books proj
ect. When Google offered to do
what was too expensive for others
to do scan all the books of the
Harvard and Bodleian libraries

"Nights with Theodore"
Two young lovers meet at a party
and head to the park for some
spontaneous passion but then
find themselves drawn back
nightly, a magnetic pull that even
affects Theodore's health. We
watch the park as if it is itself a
force and alive: people coming
through in present day mixed
with historical footage and stories
of people moving through the
park. The film opens with a tour
of its grounds. Sebastian Betbeder
has strong directorial vision with
inventive ideas: the park as a
metaphor for routine and the
draw of certain parts of the city,
the mindlessness and recklessness
of young romance and how close
ly it can be tied to place and how
ephemeral our interactions are
with urban centres which endure.
But the script is inchoate and
while this short feature lasts only
67 minutes, it won't leave much
of a mark. Sunday, May 5, 9:30
p.m. at Sundance Kabuki
