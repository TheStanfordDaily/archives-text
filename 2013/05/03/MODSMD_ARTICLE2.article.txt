## Pre-assign numbers up 10 percent Application process meets mixed reviews from students 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The pre-assignment process re
ceived over 876 completed applica
tions for the 2013-14 academic
year, according to Zac Sargeant,
Residential Education (ResEd)'s
assistant director for operations.
This year's total constitutes an
increase of more than 10 percent
over last year's figure. Overall, 470
students were accepted to the 23
theme houses.

According to Sophie Meyer 'l4,
Synergy's pre-assignment over
seer, her house enjoyed a similar
demand to last year.
"Most of the pre-assigners were
freshmen and returners," Meyer
noted. "This is fairly equivalent to
most other co-ops."
Meyer added that Synergy's
staff felt like they were turning
away too many current residents
that they wished could have
stayed.

"We could have staffed the
whole house with qualified peo
ple," Meyer said. "We had to de
cide which people we loved not to
let in."
Meyer complained, however,
that the burden of selecting next
year's Synergy residents wasn't
evenly distributed.
"This year, it was primarily me
meeting people who applied," she
said. "My staff was not as involved,
so it ended up with me collecting
impressions about the people and
my other staff members not being
as involved. In the past, we've tried
to do it as a group."
This year, Synergy chose people
based on a lottery system in an ef
fort to accelerate the process.
"We had a certain number of re
turner spots and freshmen spots
and pooled those who didn't get in
into a general tier and drew from
there," Meyer said. "But it was re
ally hard because we turned down
people we loved. Some staff mem
bers had close friends that got
turned down. I really wish we
could have had more spots."
Jan Barker-Alexander, one of
Ujamaa's two resident fellows, also
said that her dorm was very popu
lar this year.
"It was very competitive this
year," she commented. "We have a
very robust intellectual communi
ty, and we're not hurting for people
to live in the dorm."
In order to pre-assign to Uja
maa, students must write up a pro
posal for a presentation related to
the African diaspora that they will
present on during the year as part
of the Ujamaa Scholars Program.
Even with that obligation, Ujamaa
continued to receive a high number
of applicants comparable to past
years.

Laura Cussen 'l5 said that she
pre-assigned to La Casa Italiana to
take full advantage of the house's
community.
"I thought it was a good way, be
fore the draw, to see if I could get
somewhere that I really liked," she
said. "I wanted to try to reach first,
and then if it didn't work out, then
I'd do the draw. I just wanted to in
crease my chances of getting some
where cool."

Cussen added that most pre-as
signment options offered similarly
strong communities.
"I'm definitely looking forward
to the community next year,"
Cussen said. "Having lived in rela
tively large dorms ... my first two
years, it'll be nice to have that small
er group of people you can start
the year knowing that you're going
to know them relatively well by the

end of the year. You don't have to
choose who you're going to get to
know."

Cussen added that she is also in
terested in the cultural side of Casa
Italiana as well.
"I kind of took a break from lov
ing Italy for a few years, after I
went abroad there in high school,
and it will be really nice to indulge
in another culture again," she said.
Barker-Alexander emphasized
that the pre-assignment process
took place without any technical
glitches.
"The process went smoothly,"
she said. "ResEd was very support
ive and helpful."
However, some students re
ported problems with the website,
citing confusion over whether in
terviews were required for all
theme house applicants and where
students could check the status of
their application.
"Overall, I was happy with the
experience, but I wish the website
was clearer with instructions and
about when we would be informed of
the decision," said Elena Leon 'l4,
who pre-assigned to Casa Italiana.
