# ID readers come to Lake houses
## University cites safety concerns as students prepare for installation 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Amid sustained student con
cerns, the University will complete
the installation of ID card readers in
the Lake Lagunita houses by May
15, according to an email from the
Row's Housing Front Desk.
Residential & Dining Enterpris
es (R&DE) Student Housing and
Residential Education (ResEd) rep
resentatives have met with Row
house student staff members in re
cent weeks to review installation
plans and discuss concerns regard
ing the flow of workers in the resi
dences.

Though an official schedule for
the card readers' activation is not
available, Kyle Keahey, assistant
dean of ResEd for the Row, said
that there have been ongoing con
versations on how to potentially cus
tomize door alarm settings to best
fit each house's culture and tradi
tional programming, such as silenc
ing the alarms for certain events or
on certain programmed schedules.

"There is a collaborative conver
sation that's occurring that to this

point has been highly productive,"
Keahey said. "That's not to say that
students haven't been concerned
about how something like this is go
ing to impact their individual com
munities."

Nate Boswell '99 M.A. 'O9, asso
ciate dean of ResEd, acknowledged
a growing sense within the student
body of concern over University in
fringements, as may be symbolized
by remotely controlled card scan
ners. He noted that concern over
the installation of card readers
varies among each house with its
own culture but emphasized the
overarching intent of increasing stu
dent safety.
"I think that the driving force is
student safety and being able to say
that if there is a large-scale shooting
or something else that the Universi
ty has the ability to have some con
trol over what people have access to
and what they don't," Boswell said.
"Stanford is a very decentralized
campus, and we lag behind many
other campuses with regard to that
capability."
