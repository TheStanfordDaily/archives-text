# ID readers come to Lake houses
## University cites safety concerns as students prepare for installation 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Amid sustained student con
cerns, the University will complete
the installation of ID card readers in
the Lake Lagunita houses by May
15, according to an email from the
Row's Housing Front Desk.
Residential & Dining Enterpris
es (R&DE) Student Housing and
Residential Education (ResEd) rep
resentatives have met with Row
house student staff members in re
cent weeks to review installation
plans and discuss concerns regard
ing the flow of workers in the resi
dences.

Though an official schedule for
the card readers' activation is not
available, Kyle Keahey, assistant
dean of ResEd for the Row, said
that there have been ongoing con
versations on how to potentially cus
tomize door alarm settings to best
fit each house's culture and tradi
tional programming, such as silenc
ing the alarms for certain events or
on certain programmed schedules.

"There is a collaborative conver
sation that's occurring that to this

point has been highly productive,"
Keahey said. "That's not to say that
students haven't been concerned
about how something like this is go
ing to impact their individual com
munities."

Nate Boswell '99 M.A. 'O9, asso
ciate dean of ResEd, acknowledged
a growing sense within the student
body of concern over University in
fringements, as may be symbolized
by remotely controlled card scan
ners. He noted that concern over
the installation of card readers
varies among each house with its
own culture but emphasized the
overarching intent of increasing stu
dent safety.
"I think that the driving force is
student safety and being able to say
that if there is a large-scale shooting
or something else that the Universi
ty has the ability to have some con
trol over what people have access to
and what they don't," Boswell said.
"Stanford is a very decentralized
campus, and we lag behind many
other campuses with regard to that
capability."
Boswell also noted that Row
houses have seen more break-in in
cidents over the last few years, an
issue that the card readers' installa
tion might mitigate.
Scott Sakaida 'l4, community
manager of Kappa Alpha (KA), said
that his fellow residents acknowl
edge the idea of improving safety
measures and value the Universi
ty's attentiveness.
"I think it's well supported be
cause [residents] see that the Uni
versity is invested in our house,"
Sakaida said. "This project is de
signed to make accessibility and
security better for us, and I think

the house members appreciate
that."

He added that the card readers
would not pose a serious hindrance
on KA's open-door culture since
residents would hopefully still be
able to let guests in, both for their
programming and on a more gener
al, day-to-day basis.
"I think it's a stretch to say it's
going to change our image," Sakai
da said.

Magdalena Kaluza 'l3, resident
assistant of Enchanted Broccoli
Forest, noted that her residents are
more torn about the issue.

"Some people are happy for the
potential of more security," Kaluza
said. "However, that is also accom
panied by a lot of worrying that we
won't be able to operate program
ming in the house."
While she noted the open nature

of recent conversations with Uni
versity officials, she cited ongoing
concern as to how the use of out
door spaces especially the
house's deck for daily recreation
and coordinated programming
could be potentially hindered by the
card readers' activation.
Kaluza added that confusion
over when the installation phase
was to begin with some resi
dents having believed they would
be using card readers at the start of
this year made communication
with University administrators ini
tially doubtful.
"Open communication has
started very recently, and I don't
think there has been enough com
munication," Kaluza said.
