# O&A OLYMPIA SNOWE
## FORMER REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATOR 
### MOLLY VORWERCK DESK EDITOR 
Olympia Snowe, a former Re
publican U.S. Senator from Maine,
visited campus on May 2 to deliver
an address at the Stanford School
of Medicine on the necessity of bi
partisanship in Congressional poli
tics. Snowe, who last fall decided to
retire from a safe seat in the Sen
ate after 24 years in Congress,
spoke to students about women in
politics, the future of the Republi
can Party and the failure of consen
sus-building in the nation's senior
legislative body. Prior to her
speech, The Daily sat down with
Snowe to get a greater grasp on
her perspectives regarding these
issues.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Do
you think President Obama has
been an effective leader for Con
gress?
Olympia Snowe (OS): It's inter
esting— I think he should have
started a long time ago, but that
doesn't excuse today. I think that
he should have worked more ag
gressively with Congress from the
outset of his own presidency be

cause that's how it works. You can't
have the executive and legislative
branches operating on parallel
courses and never integrating.
I don't think he exerted the
strong leadership that is essential
for these times and on some of
these key matters, and of course
you have people who weren't re
sponsible, including people in my
party. I often think back when I
look to 2009, when his presidency
began, it seemed like the wheels
came off so quickly between the
Congress and the President in a
time when it mattered so much for
the country.
I was one of three Republicans
to support the stimulus not that
I loved the stimulus, but] I also un
derstood it was an imperative for
the times because the economy was
on the edge. [The stimulus] resus
citated [the economy] from collaps
ing entirely, but then you needed
that injection in the private sector
you get the economy on its feet,
and that's the point.
And so now Obama has made
overtures, which I think is impor
tant with Republicans ... And I
think he has to appreciate and un
derstand the power of his office

and how important it is for his for
him to be that voice but to weigh in
and make sure that he's doing
everything within the auspices of
his authority to work with mem
bers of Congress.
TSD: What do you view as your
greatest accomplishment in Con
gress? You were there for 24
years, so that's quite a signifi
cant amount of time. Have you
always been so passionate about
bipartisanship?
OS: Well, absolutely, because I
know now of no other way of ac
complishing great achievements
for this country. Working through
those differences is the bridge by
which you can get the very best leg
islation. That was true of the great
est legislative achievements of the
20th century, whether it was Social
Security, Medicare, the Voting
Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act
they were all voted on a bipartisan
basis and not along party lines, and
that's why it's woven into the fabric
of our country.
TSD: When you came to Congress
in the late 19705, was this issue of
partisanship as big as it is today?

OS: Oh, no. You had your differ
ences, and there were divisions, but
it wasn't to the exclusion of solving a
problem. It wasn't the impediment
and the barrier for crafting solutions
to the problem you never thought
that you couldn't get there from
here, as people say in Maine. And it
was true.

It was natural that you would
work out those differences, and the
process by which to accomplish it is
in the committees, which is where
you were able to exercise your

has become increasingly polarized
in recent years.
views through the amendment
process. And then, of course, on the
floor of the House, and that was
true in the United States Senate,
which is a more deliberate body be
cause it's smaller and it's designed
to focus and be more methodical in
addressing the issues, so the
process ordinarily would allow for
that, but that's not what's happen
ing today, regrettably so.

So much is transformed in the
legislative landscape, let alone the
political landscape, that has pre
vented the possibilities of reaching
consensus on even the smallest is
sues, let alone the most significant
ones facing us at this time.

TSD: Do you that there are any
specific groups or set of individu
als who are most responsible for
this lack of bipartisanship?
- OS: I mean certainly, it hasn't
been everybody, and I've said that,
when I was there, that we each indi
vidually have a responsibility and
the same is true of my party in Con
gress, and the President and the
Congress they should have
worked it out.

You know, there are a lot of good

people in Congress, there's no ques
tion. Unfortunately, there's this dys
function that's emanated from cam
paigns and policies of politics and so
many other things. It's just spilled
over into this legislative process,
but I think you've got to rise above
and do what's right for the country.

TSD: I read that you now back
same-sex marriage. You voted for
the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act.
Can you please address this shift
in opinion?
OS: Since that time, there's been
a major evolution and change. And I
think that's as it should be —it
takes gradualism sometimes before
you can act, you know, and bringing
it to the public when the public has a
better understanding builds greater
support. Ultimately, I think you're
seeing what's happening today
across the country, including in my
state of Maine, which had a referen
dum last year to approve same-sex
marriage. It's all part of the gradual
ism that is involved on some of these
key societal questions. Sometimes
they do take time, but it's important
for the country to come along on
those questions as it has been evolv
ing and developing. Ultimately, I've
come to the same conclusion, and
that's why I made the decision that I
did.

TSD: You recently launched a

project called Olympia's List in
order to promote bipartisanship
in government. Can you explain
the list to me?

OS: I launched this, first of all,
to create a sort of multi-candidate
committee which will support can
didates who are consensus
builders, who believe as I do that it
is important to use the position of
public office to craft solutions to,
you know, be consensus-builders
and to maximize that potential. So I
will support candidates who are
willing to work across the political
aisle and to hopefully build a na
tional following through my Face
book and Twitter and website be
cause I think it's important to do,
and it will be an extension of my
new book coming out in two weeks,
"Fighting for Common Ground."
It's all about how [bipartisan
ship] used to work in Congress, and
how it can again. I'm a can-do per
son, and I just know that we can
solve our problems if we are willing
to work together. I want to demon
strate how it has worked in both
the House and the Senate and
what's happening now and what we
can do to change it.
