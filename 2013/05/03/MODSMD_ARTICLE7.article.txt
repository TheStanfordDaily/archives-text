## FacSen approves revisions to ARP 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard re
ports from student representa
tives and voted on revisions to
the Alternative Review Process
(ARP), the University's judicial
procedure for sexual assault cas
es, at its meeting on Thursday.
Shahab Fadavi 'l5, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate's repre
sentative to the Faculty Senate,
spoke briefly about the Alterna
tive Review Process, noting that
the Undergraduate Senate had
sought to reevaluate the Univer
sity's approach to sexual assault
by creating an ad hoc committee
to look at the ARP
Fadavi reiterated the impor
tance of listening to student
feedback by noting the disap
pointment students have ex
pressed this year at a lack of
willingness by faculty and ad
ministrators to incorporate that
feedback.
"I'd rather focus on the suc

cesses rather than the failures,"
Fadavi said. "Late last quarter,
an article was published in The
Daily on shifting class times to
8:30 a.m. and banning double
booking on classes. There was a
huge uproar in the student com
munity."
Fadavi added that he met
with Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Harry
Elam the next morning concern
ing this issue. Later that
evening, Elam attended an open
forum for students and faculty
to express them opinions and
pose questions concerning the
issue.
"I think that should serve as
a role model," Fadavi said. "It
helped to answer some ques
tions."
Outgoing ASSU President
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 M.A 'l3 dis
cussed the importance of open
communication between stu
dents and the administration,
noting that both ASSU legisla
tive bodies had approved stu

dents to serve on 50 committees
across the University.
Zimbroff went on to reem
phasis the significance of the
process of soliciting student
feedback.
Representatives of the Board
of Judicial Affairs (BJA) subse
quently spoke about the revi
sions to the ARE Michele
Dauber, professor of law and
BJA co-chair, described the
ARP as the process under which
all allegations of sexual assault,
sexual misconduct, sexual ha
rassment, stalking, relationship
abuse and dating violence are
addressed.
"In 10 of the 13 years prior to
the adoption of the ARIJ Stan
ford didn't have a single adjudi
cation for any sexual assault or
sexual violence," Dauber said.
"During that entire 13 year peri
od, Stanford reported 175 cases
of sexual offenses to the federal
government under the Cleary
Act, but only four cases went to a
hearing and only two students
were found responsible."
Dauber added that it is impossi
ble to know precisely how many as
saults took place during those
years and how many were commit
ted by Stanford students, rather
than people from off campus.
According to Dauber, through
three years of the ARP pilot pro
gram, Stanford has had 53 reports
of cases of sexual offenses, with 11
cases going to a hearing and seven
guilty findings.

"We needed to create a new
process because the Student Judi
cial Charter of 1997 was not de
signed to handle sexual assault cas

es," Dauber said. "Some of the spe
cific issues that we found to be in
hibiting the use of the process by
alleged victims were that our
process was trial-like... We wanted
to make the process more open for
students."

In the pilot program, there are a
series of private interviews, with
each party listening to the other's
interview and responding with
questions via email in real time.
The process increased the number
of reviewers from four to five, with
three students and two faculty or
staff members determining re
sponsibility. The reviewers make
their findings by using the prepon
derance of evidence standard, as
suggested by federal guidelines.
According to Dauber, the new
process also allows for more oppor
tunities to respond and appeal and
provides more protection and con
fidentiality.

Jonathan York 'l3, BJA co
chair, spoke about student involve
ment in the changes made to the
ARE

"[The new process] provides
support and resources to students
going through the process," York
said. "It also remains non-con
frontational. Students have the op
portunity to propose questions via
email, which strengthens the
rights of both parties."
According to York, students cit
ed a high level of engagement in
the entire process of reviewing and
changing the ARI] allowing victims
to feel more comfortable.

During faculty questioning, Pro
fessor of Psychiatry and Behavioral
Sciences David Spiegel asked about
sanctions proposed in the amend
ment and how results are communi
cated to the community.
"The typical sanction for a sexu
al assault finding of responsibility

is that the person found responsi
ble has to be off campus for an av
erage of three quarters and can't
be on campus until the victim grad
uates," Dauber said. "We don't re
flect this on a transcript and don't
communicate the finding of respon
sibility to anyone, ever ... The com
munity does not know and should
not know."

Lauren Schoenthaler, a staff
member on the BJA, added that
there are certain professions for
which applicants are asked
whether they have a past discipli
nary record, resulting in the infor
mation being released with a spe
cial written request.
The Faculty Senate unanimous
ly approved the which will go
before President John Hennessy
for final approval.
