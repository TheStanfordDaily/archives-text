## FacSen approves revisions to ARP 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard re
ports from student representa
tives and voted on revisions to
the Alternative Review Process
(ARP), the University's judicial
procedure for sexual assault cas
es, at its meeting on Thursday.
Shahab Fadavi 'l5, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate's repre
sentative to the Faculty Senate,
spoke briefly about the Alterna
tive Review Process, noting that
the Undergraduate Senate had
sought to reevaluate the Univer
sity's approach to sexual assault
by creating an ad hoc committee
to look at the ARP
Fadavi reiterated the impor
tance of listening to student
feedback by noting the disap
pointment students have ex
pressed this year at a lack of
willingness by faculty and ad
ministrators to incorporate that
feedback.
"I'd rather focus on the suc

cesses rather than the failures,"
Fadavi said. "Late last quarter,
an article was published in The
Daily on shifting class times to
8:30 a.m. and banning double
booking on classes. There was a
huge uproar in the student com
munity."
Fadavi added that he met
with Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Harry
Elam the next morning concern
ing this issue. Later that
evening, Elam attended an open
forum for students and faculty
to express them opinions and
pose questions concerning the
issue.
"I think that should serve as
a role model," Fadavi said. "It
helped to answer some ques
tions."
Outgoing ASSU President
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 M.A 'l3 dis
cussed the importance of open
communication between stu
dents and the administration,
noting that both ASSU legisla
tive bodies had approved stu

dents to serve on 50 committees
across the University.
Zimbroff went on to reem
phasis the significance of the
process of soliciting student
feedback.
Representatives of the Board
of Judicial Affairs (BJA) subse
quently spoke about the revi
sions to the ARE Michele
Dauber, professor of law and
BJA co-chair, described the
ARP as the process under which
all allegations of sexual assault,
sexual misconduct, sexual ha
rassment, stalking, relationship
abuse and dating violence are
addressed.
"In 10 of the 13 years prior to
the adoption of the ARIJ Stan
ford didn't have a single adjudi
cation for any sexual assault or
sexual violence," Dauber said.
"During that entire 13 year peri
od, Stanford reported 175 cases
of sexual offenses to the federal
government under the Cleary
