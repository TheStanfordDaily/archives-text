# CARD WINS MPSF
## REMATCH WITH IRISH LOOMS 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Before the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) play
offs, Stanford lacrosse junior
goalie Lyndsey Munoz reflected
upon her first tournament experi
ence. In 2011, the Cardinal went
down 7-0 to Oregon early in the
MPSF final before Munoz, who
had seen minimal action all year,
stepped in to spark a furious come
back that ended with a 12-10 Stan

ford win. The then-freshman was
named tournament MVP for her
seven-save performance.
"That was the first time as a
freshman I got to see playing
time," Munoz said last week.
"Tournament time means a lot to
me because it's where I started."

In 2013, Munoz entered the
postseason firmly entrenched as
the Cardinal's starter. But the dra
ma â€” and most importantly, the
result was the same as Stanford
(13-5, 6-2 MPSF) pulled off a nar

row 7-6 victory over top-seeded
Denver (17-2, 7-1 MPSF) to claim
the conference championship on
Saturday afternoon.
The Cardinal was led by an op
portunistic attack and standout
play from Munoz and the Stanford
defense. The junior goalkeeper
made 10 saves, including a stop of
a Denver free-position attempt
with 33 seconds remaining to
maintain the slim lead.
"[Munoz] was really locked in
all tournament so I hope this gives
her a lot of confidence going into
the NCAA Tournament," Stanford
head coach Amy Bokker told
GoStanford.com. "She did awe
some and was really focused, and
knew she wanted to win a champi

onship."
At the other end of the field,
midfielder Hannah Farr also
stepped up on the big stage for the
Cardinal. The sophomore scored
two goals, picked up two ground
balls and controlled two draws
which, coupled with a four-goal
performance against Cal in the
semifinals, gave her the MPSF
Tournament Most Outstanding
Player award. She was joined on
the all-tournament team by senior
captain Elizabeth Adam, freshman
Lucy Dikeou, junior captain Anna
Kim and Munoz.
This was the eighth MPSF title
in the past nine years for the Car
dinal, which fell to Oregon 13-10 in
last year's championship game.
With the win, the Cardinal claims
an automatic bid for the NCAA
Tournament. In the first round,
unseeded Stanford will travel to
Evanston, 111., to face unseeded
Notre Dame, with the winner tak
ing on the host and two-time de
fending NCAA Champions, No. 2
Northwestern.
Coming into the game, No. 11
Denver boasted a 17-1 record that
included a 14-10 victory over Stan
ford on April 5. But in the game
that mattered most, the Cardinal
knocked off the Pioneers in a close
fought battle.
"We really stuck to our game
plan and worked those great pos
sessions and waited for our oppor
tunities," Bokker told GoStan
ford.com.
The Cardinal took a 3-0 lead
nine minutes into the game with
goals from junior Rachel Ozer,
Dikeou and Farr.
But Denver, which entered the
game leading the conference in
scoring with an average of 14.8
goals per game, would not be held
down for long as the Pioneers re
sponded with three straight goals
of their own in an eight-minute
span. Munoz made five saves in the
final 8:28 of the half to keep the
score locked at three until half
time.
