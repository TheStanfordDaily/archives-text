# Baseball takes two from ASU
## Series win keeps NCAA goal alive 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
No. 25 Stanford baseball head
ed to the desert needing a series
victory over No. 16 Arizona State
to keep its postseason hopes alive.
A strong outing from senior start
ing pitcher Mark Appel on Friday
and some late-game heroics from
junior first baseman Brian Ragira
gave Stanford just enough to win
the series before falling short of
the sweep Sunday afternoon.
Junior shortstop Lonnie Kaup
pila kicked off a strong weekend
with a bang Friday night, picking
up three hits and scoring two runs
to lead the Cardinal charge.
Kauppila started things off with

a leadoff single in the third. After
two walks and a sacrifice bunt,
Stanford had the bases loaded and
only one out for junior Austin Wil
son. Wilson delivered again, knock
ing in two runs with a single to put
Stanford up 2-0.

Junior second baseman Danny
Diekroeger knocked in another run
before Arizona State starting
pitcher Trevor Williams got junior
catcher Brant Whiting to ground
into an inning-ending double play.
Kauppila also helped build
Stanford's only other run-scoring
inning, the two-run fourth, when he
singled and scored the Cardinal's
fifth and final run of the evening.
And that's when the Sun Devils

mounted their comeback against
Appel. Appel struck out 13 while al
lowing only five hits and a walk in
7.2 innings, but he gave up three
runs two earned starting in
the bottom of the fourth.
With one out and a runner on
first, Appel allowed back-to-back
doubles to ASU's RJ Ybarra and
Trevor Allen to cut the lead to 5-2.
But Appel settled down, getting a
strikeout and a fly out to strand
Allen and keep momentum on
Stanford's side. The Sun Devils'
only other run came from a sev
enth-inning error.
When Appel exited, Stanford
turned to senior relief pitcher Gar
rett Hughes, who got the job done
in dramatic fashion. The big lefty
allowed two runners to reach base
in the eighth and one in the ninth,
but he kept the Sun Devils off the
board to get the save for Stanford's
5-3 victory.

Saturday's game was a wild one
from the start. Stanford scored two
runs without recording an out in
the top of the first on a two-run
homer by sophomore right fielder
Austin Slater. But freshman start
ing pitcher Daniel Starwalt could
n't hold the lead, lasting just 3.1 in
nings while allowing four runs on
five hits.
Freshman relief pitcher Logan
James' fate wasn't much better, as
he allowed three more runs on six
hits and four walks in another 3.1
innings of work. The Stanford bats
bailed out their freshman pitchers
though, tying the game at seven in
the seventh inning with a three-run
home run from Wilson.
And that's when junior relief
pitcher Sam Lindquist came in to
stop the bleeding. The junior was
at his best, keeping the game tied

Junior shortstop Lonnie Kauppila (left) helped spark Stanford with three hits and two runs Friday night as the Cardinal took the first two games
of the weekend to clinch the series. Stanford almost pulled off the sweep, but its dramatic comeback fell short in the ninth inning on Sunday.
through his first 3.1 innings as
Stanford and ASU headed to the
11th inning still tied 7-7.
Three consecutive one-out walks
in the top of the 11th gave Stanford
its best opportunity to take the ball
game, and Ragira delivered with a
two-RBI single, his only hit in six
plate appearances, to give the Cardi
nal a 9-7 lead.
Lindquist made it interesting in
the bottom of the inning. With one
out, Lindquist allowed a double, a
single and a hit batter to cut the lead
to 9-8 and put runners on first and
second.
After Lindquist recorded the sec
ond out, a wild pitch and a four-pitch
walk loaded the bases for ASU lead
off hitter Kasey Coffman. On the
first pitch, the 371 st pitch of the
game, Lindquist got Coffman to
ground out to Diekroeger to end the
ballgame.
On Sunday, Stanford again strug
gled on the mound but couldn't
mount another offensive attack to
keep pace with the Sun Devils as the
Cardinal fell 11-8.
Sophomore starting pitcher John
Hochstatter began struggling in the
second inning with a 2-0 lead. The
lefty allowed three runs to score with
two more on base and two outs be
fore giving way to senior reliever
Dean McArdle, a move that back

fired immediately.
On his first pitch, McArdle al
lowed a three-run homer to ASU
catcher Max Rossiter. On McArdle's
next pitch, Ybarra homered to al
most the exact same spot. Three
pitches later, Allen made it back-to
back-to-back home runs, giving the
Sun Devils an 8-2 lead on an eight
run second inning.
The Cardinal made a late charge
back behind some unlikely sources.
Freshman catcher Austin Barr cut
the lead to 10-7 with a three-run
homer in the seventh, his first career
home run.
The rally came up short when
Slater, as the tying run in the ninth,

grounded into a double play and Ra
gira struck out looking in the next at
bat to end the game.
Stanford returns to the Farm for
a critical five-game home stand, be
ginning with a Tuesday contest
against the University of San Fran
cisco. After the midweek game
against the Dons, the Cardinal wel
comes No. 5 Oregon State, the cur
rent leader of the Pac-12, to Sunken
Diamond for perhaps its toughest se
ries of the season.
First pitch Tuesday is scheduled
for 5:30 p.m.
