# OPINIONS
## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN What I Wish I'd Done 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Former Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education John
Bravman's speech to my in
coming freshman class, delivered to
a Memorial Auditorium filled with
kids who had no idea what they were
getting into but couldn't wait to
start, seems like I heard it just yes
terday His message was simple: Time
moves fast, and, before you know it,
your four years at Stanford will be
over. Make the most of it, he advised
us. A few minutes later, his speech was
over, and we were back out in the
warm Palo Alto dusk, waving our
dorm flags and thinking we had all the
time in the world ahead of us.
Turns out we didn't. Time runs
quick. And even though I managed
to stretch four years into five, I'm
leaving soon, wishing I had done a lot
of things I never quite managed to
do.
What follows is the advice I wish
I could have given myself four and a
half years ago, sourced from the re
flections of a guy who's only now re
alizing what he's losing. I don't want
to pretend that this advice applies to
or will have value for everyone; I
don't want to pretend that it is any
more valuable than the guidance
you've already received, and will
continue to receive, from friends,
parents and teachers. Take of it what
you will, and ignore the rest.
1. Go to more campus events.
I'm not talking about the A1 Gores
and the Rachel Maddows, although
you shouldn't miss the big fish either.
I'm talking about the countless
chatlist event emails that somehow
get ignored in favor of procrastina
tion on Facebook, the posters on
those concrete pillars in White Plaza
you bike by without a second glance.
The number of lectures and free
talks I now wish I'd attended is stag
gering. Outside Stanford's sand
stone arches lies a world in which top
foreign dignitaries, Supreme Court
litigators and biomedical re
searchers don't give free lectures on
a daily basis within five minutes of
your home. Do a better job than I
did. Go listen to somebody brilliant,
and do it as much as possible.
2. Don't waste the free food!
The meal plan here is among the
best in the country. Use it. Don't skip
meals, and when you see a campus
event offering free food, go for it. You
won't get the chance again after you
graduate.
3. Scroll through Explore-
Courses, find a class that looks in
teresting and sit in on a lecture or
two. The few times I've done this
have been among my best experi
ences at Stanford. AIL once invited
me to listen to a Con Law lecture; it

was amazing. Rock, Sex and Rebel
lion is the most fun you will ever
have in a lecture hall, and Apple
baum is like a much smarter version
of Jack Black in "School of Rock."
Don't miss out.
4. Stay in touch with old
friends. It's easy to let them go, and
you'll regret it. I sure do.
5. Sleep a little more. You'll feel
happier, perform better in school
and get through the year with a
slightly lower chance of burning out.
If you're a varsity athlete, this one
should read, "sleep a LOT more."
(For more info, see #3 on this list
and search for "Sleep and Dreams."
Drowsiness is Red Alert!)
6. Go to as many athletic events
as you can. We have the best overall
collegiate athletics program in the
world, and all those tickets are free.
You won't get chances like this again
after you leave; this is it. Go see
women's basketball at Maples.
Watch some record-setting track
and field performances at the world
class Payton Jordan Invitational
(missed your chance this year; come
back next April). And whatever you
do, see at least one football game.
7. Take one or more of the fol
lowing classes: Econ 1A and IB
(preferably with Marcelo or Ten
clall), History 106A/B/C with Martin
Lewis (well, actually, anything in the
History department!) and a foreign
language you haven't taken before.
8. Challenge a belief or opinion
everyone around you appears to
share. For your benefit and for the
intellectual benefit of people around
you, speak up and disrupt the para
lyzing comfort of conformity. Don't
do it to be a jerk or grab attention;
do it respectfully and after a lot of
thought about what to say and how
exactly to say it. If you run with the
Occupy crowd, read some Milton
Friedman and really engage with his
arguments. If you've already memo
rized Friedman and have a poster of
him hanging on your wall, go protest
on behalf of Stanford Hospital work
ers. Having a debate in class about
whether the full Islamic veil is op
pressive or liberating for women in
the West? Thoughtfully take the side
no one else is taking.
It'll expand your mind, and hope
fully everyone else's. And chances
are, there are a lot of people out
there who think the same way you do

and are just afraid to say it.
9. Go abroad. I never had this
chance (three-season varsity ath
lete), but NO ONE I know who's
gone abroad has EVER regretted it.
See a bit of the world while you can
do it with your fellow students, on fi
nancial aid and in an academic set
ting. Bon voyage and arrivederci.
10. Really get to know a profes
sor. Professors here have spent a
lifetime accumulating knowledge
you can't get anywhere else. They
love to talk and to teach; it's a big

part of why they're here. And they
get lonely when no one comes up to
talk to them after lecture or in office

hours they think no one enjoyed
hearing them speak, when the reali
ty is that most students are just plain
scared, intimidated or in a rush.
Don't be afraid that you're too
dumb to have a conversation with a
professor. Embrace your lack of
knowledge, because every professor
is going to know a whole lot more
than you do. It's supposed to be that
way. That's why they're teaching and

you're learning. And don't go into
the conversation with a future letter
of rec in mind or even necessarily
your own interests or goals. Start off
by just asking them about them
selves and their work; chances are,
you'll learn a lot and have fun doing
it.
That's not all I wish I'd heard my
freshman year. But it's a big part of
it. Let me know what you think.

thought about what to say and how
exactly to say it. If you run with the
Occupy crowd, read some Milton
Friedman and really engage with his
arguments. If you've already memo
rized Friedman and have a poster of
him hanging on your wall, go protest
on behalf of Stanford Hospital work
ers. Having a debate in class about
whether the full Islamic veil is op
pressive or liberating for women in
the West? Thoughtfully take the side
no one else is taking.
It'll expand your mind, and hope
fully everyone else's. And chances
are, there are a lot of people out
there who think the same way you do

and are just afraid to say it.
9. Go abroad. I never had this
chance (three-season varsity ath
lete), but NO ONE I know who's
gone abroad has EVER regretted it.
See a bit of the world while you can
do it with your fellow students, on fi
nancial aid and in an academic set
ting. Bon voyage and arrivederci.
10. Really get to know a profes
sor. Professors here have spent a
lifetime accumulating knowledge
you can't get anywhere else. They
love to talk and to teach; it's a big

part of why they're here. And they
get lonely when no one comes up to
talk to them after lecture or in office

hours they think no one enjoyed
hearing them speak, when the reali
ty is that most students are just plain
scared, intimidated or in a rush.
Don't be afraid that you're too
dumb to have a conversation with a
professor. Embrace your lack of
knowledge, because every professor
is going to know a whole lot more
than you do. It's supposed to be that
way. That's why they're teaching and

you're learning. And don't go into
the conversation with a future letter
of rec in mind or even necessarily
your own interests or goals. Start off
by just asking them about them
selves and their work; chances are,
you'll learn a lot and have fun doing
it.
That's not all I wish I'd heard my
freshman year. But it's a big part of
it. Let me know what you think.

Former Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education John
Bravman's speech to my in
coming freshman class, delivered to
a Memorial Auditorium filled with
kids who had no idea what they were
getting into but couldn't wait to
start, seems like I heard it just yes
terday His message was simple: Time
moves fast, and, before you know it,
your four years at Stanford will be
over. Make the most of it, he advised
us. A few minutes later, his speech was
over, and we were back out in the
warm Palo Alto dusk, waving our
dorm flags and thinking we had all the
time in the world ahead of us.
Turns out we didn't. Time runs
quick. And even though I managed
to stretch four years into five, I'm
leaving soon, wishing I had done a lot
of things I never quite managed to
do.
What follows is the advice I wish
I could have given myself four and a
half years ago, sourced from the re
flections of a guy who's only now re
alizing what he's losing. I don't want
to pretend that this advice applies to
or will have value for everyone; I
don't want to pretend that it is any
more valuable than the guidance
you've already received, and will
continue to receive, from friends,
parents and teachers. Take of it what
you will, and ignore the rest.
1. Go to more campus events.
I'm not talking about the A1 Gores
and the Rachel Maddows, although
you shouldn't miss the big fish either.
I'm talking about the countless
chatlist event emails that somehow
get ignored in favor of procrastina
tion on Facebook, the posters on
those concrete pillars in White Plaza
you bike by without a second glance.
The number of lectures and free
talks I now wish I'd attended is stag
gering. Outside Stanford's sand
stone arches lies a world in which top
foreign dignitaries, Supreme Court
litigators and biomedical re
searchers don't give free lectures on
a daily basis within five minutes of
your home. Do a better job than I
did. Go listen to somebody brilliant,
and do it as much as possible.
2. Don't waste the free food!
The meal plan here is among the
best in the country. Use it. Don't skip
meals, and when you see a campus
event offering free food, go for it. You
won't get the chance again after you
graduate.
3. Scroll through Explore-
Courses, find a class that looks in
teresting and sit in on a lecture or
two. The few times I've done this
have been among my best experi
ences at Stanford. AIL once invited
me to listen to a Con Law lecture; it

was amazing. Rock, Sex and Rebel
lion is the most fun you will ever
have in a lecture hall, and Apple
baum is like a much smarter version
of Jack Black in "School of Rock."
Don't miss out.
4. Stay in touch with old
friends. It's easy to let them go, and
you'll regret it. I sure do.
5. Sleep a little more. You'll feel
happier, perform better in school
and get through the year with a
slightly lower chance of burning out.
If you're a varsity athlete, this one
should read, "sleep a LOT more."
(For more info, see #3 on this list
and search for "Sleep and Dreams."
Drowsiness is Red Alert!)
6. Go to as many athletic events
as you can. We have the best overall
collegiate athletics program in the
world, and all those tickets are free.
You won't get chances like this again
after you leave; this is it. Go see
women's basketball at Maples.
Watch some record-setting track
and field performances at the world
class Payton Jordan Invitational
(missed your chance this year; come
back next April). And whatever you
do, see at least one football game.
7. Take one or more of the fol
lowing classes: Econ 1A and IB
(preferably with Marcelo or Ten
clall), History 106A/B/C with Martin
Lewis (well, actually, anything in the
History department!) and a foreign
language you haven't taken before.
8. Challenge a belief or opinion
everyone around you appears to
share. For your benefit and for the
intellectual benefit of people around
you, speak up and disrupt the para
lyzing comfort of conformity. Don't
do it to be a jerk or grab attention;
do it respectfully and after a lot of
thought about what to say and how
exactly to say it. If you run with the
Occupy crowd, read some Milton
Friedman and really engage with his
