## On "Tel Aviv Meets Bombay" And Mutual Respect 
### AMRITA RAO '15 
A recent article published in
STATIC, "On 'Tel Aviv Meets
Bombay' and South Asian As
similation" by Janani Balasubraman
ian 'l2, disparaged Sanskriti, Stan
ford's South Asian cultural organiza
tion, for hosting a mixer with the
Stanford Israel Alliance on May 3.
This event had no political purpose
nor any intention other than to bring
together a few dozen students from
both communities to sit on Flomo
field and engage socially over falafel
and samosas.
We did not "celebrate the colonial
Israeli state" or even talk about it.
We did, however, marvel over the
presence of the hamsa (swan) as a
symbol in both cultures, an example
of the many principles they share.
Janani took this event as an opportu
nity to put down not just Sanskriti
but Indian, and specifically Hindu,
culture as a whole. I write this re
sponse not as a Sanskriti representa
tive but as a Hindu and an Indian
American concerned about the deri
sive and incorrect image of my her
itage propagated by this article and
the threat it presents to the atmos
phere of mutual respect desired in
the Stanford community.
First of all, the Indian education
system does not favor upper-caste
Hindus. The caste system as a social
practice does still exist on some level
but has no intrinsic roots in Hindu
scripture. The reality in India today,
especially in the state of Tamil Nadu,
sees upper-caste Brahmins actively
discriminated against for both educa
tion and jobs, with reservation quo
tas of more than 70 percent for back
ward and scheduled castes in private
and public sectors and additional
quotas for minority religions.
Indians of our parents' generation
immigrated to the United States as
skilled professionals in high demand.
Perhaps they did not face the same
level of discrimination as other com
munities, partly because the first wave

of immigration happened after the
passage of the 1968 Civil Rights Act.
Still, one cannot simply ignore the
violent hate crimes of the "Dot
busters" in New Jersey in the 1980s,
named with reference to the red dots
called bindis that Hindus wear on
them foreheads. More recently, one
cannot forget the mass shooting at a
Sikh gurudwara in Wisconsin just
last year. Janani also neglects to
mention that the Indian Americans
with the highest political offices, gov
ernors Bobby Jindal and Nikki Ha
ley, both identified as Christians be
fore the stai*t of their political ca
reers, after converting from Hin
duism and Sikhism respectively.
Janani's claim that "it was often
safer [for Indians] to collaborate
with the British colonial government
than to challenge its White suprema
cy" should raise red flags for anyone
with any knowledge of the (anti-colo
nial) Indian freedom movement. Ma
hatma Gandhi's philosophy of nonvi
olent protest inspired both the lead
ers of the South African Anti-
Apartheid movement and the Amer
ican Civil Rights movement. To call a
nation that gained its independence
through nonviolent means, a nation
that today has a Sikh Prime Minister
and a Muslim Vice President, a cause
of "Hindu-nationalist duress" re
veals deep ignorance.
And if India truly did embrace
Hindu principles, what would that
look like? Like Janani, I too studied
classical music and dance growing
up, and attended weekly classes at
Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, an in
stitute for the study of Hindu ad
vaita Vedanta philosophy and oth
er classical disciplines. The gu
rukulam gave me a learning envi
ronment in which there were no
wrong questions. I learned the value
of ahimsa, causing the least possi
ble harm. I learned responsibility for
both the direct and indirect effects of
one's actions, karma. I learned

about dharma, a framework for
moral behavior that places one in
harmony with the universal order. I
learned the importance of pluralism
and mutual respect among religions
rather than mere tolerance. Hin
duism bases itself on understanding
rather than belief, and one need not
be a follower of the religion to attain
enlightenment.
I do not understand Janani's re
peated reference to "Hindu patri
archy," since Hindu tradition person
ifies divine energy in feminine form
as Shakti and has a history replete
with female religious leaders. My
thorough immersion in Hindu tradi
tion through the gurukulam has
given me a strong sense of religious
and cultural identity, and I am com
fortable, no, proud to identify as a
Hindu, as an Indian and as a woman.
Furthermore, I take issue with
Janani's endorsement of the term
"South Asian" rather than Indian.
The term works for an umbrella or
ganization like Sanskriti that seeks
to involve as many people as possible
in cultural and social events, but it
proves problematic in most other
contexts. India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh differ greatly on issues
of religion, politics and human
rights. Of the three, only India iden
tifies as secular and as a democracy
and supports equal (or extra) rights
for minorities.
The three countries have differ
ent goals and needs, and, in the in
ternational arena, no foreign policy
could be framed to deal with "South
Asia" categorically. Identifying as
"South Asian" individually means
embracing an inherently fractured,
contradictory self-image. In a collec
tive context the term serves a pur
pose of inclusion but on the individ
ual level only leads to cultural confu
sion.
Janani, I appreciate your desire
to question ideologies, going beyond
a purely aesthetic angle, but you

seem to draw only upon the Neocolo
nialist viewpoint of Indian history
and to confuse socio-political prac
tices with religious ones. If you
would really like to view the Indian
subcontinent without a "White
gaze," I encourage you to read Rajiv
Malhotra's books: "Breaking India"
for the non-colonialist view of Indian
history, "Invading the Sacred" to
learn about the anti-Hindu nature of
Hinduism studies in universities and
"Being Different" to approach the
history of the West through the lens
of Indian intellectual philosophy in
stead of the other way around. I
would welcome the opportunity to
further discuss all of these topics
with you.
Now to come to the actual event
and what it represents. India and Is
rael have a rich, mutually beneficial
relationship that stems from the
similar challenges they face. In addi
tion, the Hindu and Jewish tradi
tions share many values of practice
and lifestyle confidently recognized
by religious leaders of both faiths. In
an American context, Indian Ameri
cans have followed in the footsteps of
the American Jewish to enjoy suc
cess in academia, business and cul
ture, and they look to the Jewish as
role models for a strong political
voice.
Both India and Israel are sole
democracies in locations of instability
and face aggression from their neigh
bors. Unlike these other nations,
they both offer citizenship and equal
rights to their large populations of
minority religions, with members of
these communities serving in politi
cal office. India has developed a
strong relationship with Israel not
only through defense and security
like the West, Russia and China, but
also through technology. Israeli tech
niques for soil management in desert
climates have helped states like Ra
jasthan grow exportable crops. Irri
gation techniques have changed the

face of Indian agriculture, the means
of subsistence for a majority of the
population. The two democracies
that represent the world's two oldest
religious traditions have much to
share with each other.
In terms of religion, Hinduism
and Judaism are both non-aggres
sive in practice and propagation. Nei
ther religion actively proselytizes,
and both experience dwindling num
bers in the face of other religions that
do actively convert through a variety
of means. Since 2007, the most promi
nent Hindu and Jewish leaders from
the Chief Rabbinate of Israel and the
Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha have
engaged in dialogue to promote mutu
al respect through three Hindu-Jew
ish Leadership Summits organized by
the World Council of Religious Lead
ers. I was fortunate enough to tag
along to the third Summit in New
York and Washingon D.C. with my fa
ther, the Executive Director of the Fo
rum for Religious Freedom, and I at
tribute my continuing passion for mu
tual respect among religious commu
nities and for Hindu American advo
cacy to such opportunities.
I agree with you, Janani, that stu
dents at schools like Stanford will
probably go on to have significant so
cial and political influence, but I find
that all the more reason to stimulate
intercultural and interfaith dialogue
in our community with the intention
of fostering mutual respect. Mutual
respect means respect for all commu
nities, including those with which one
might not agree.
The SIA-Sanskriti mixer created
new friendships across the two or
ganizations, friendships that will fur
ther the discovery of abundant simi
larities between the two countries,
religions and cultures, giving us the
chance to support each other and
learn from each other's successes
past and successes to come.
