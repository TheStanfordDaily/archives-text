## Men's crew takes down Cal, but women's team falls short 
### â€“ George Chen 
No. 7 Stanford men's rowing upset No. 3
Cal in the Big Row on Saturday, hoisting the
Schwabacher Cup for just the second time in
23 seasons.

"Today we witnessed a tremendous team
effort," Stanford head coach Craig
Amerkhanian told GoStanford.com. "Stanford
men's crew stood side by side and battled Cal
from start to finish. As coach, I was proud of
the effort, speed and conviction."

The Cardinal clocked a 5:31.2 in the varsi
ty eight race, edging out the Golden Bears by
1.5 seconds, a margin of approximately one
boat length. Though the varsity eight victory
was all Stanford needed to take the Big Row,
the Cardinal was easily defeated by its cross
bay rival in the two events that were held ear
lier in the day. The Bears topped Stanford in
the second varsity eight by over ten seconds

5:45.4 to 5:55.9 and produced a one-two
sweep in the freshman eight.
On the women's side, Cal dominated from
top to bottom.
The lOth-ranked Cardinal lost all four
races against the second-ranked Bears, failing
to capture the Lambert cup for the fourth
consecutive season.
In the varsity eight, Cal finished six sec
onds ahead of Stanford with a blistering time
of 6:14.7 a new Redwood Shores course
record. The Bears also defeated the Cardinal
in the second varsity eight by fewer than five
seconds, though Stanford was in the lead up to
the 1,000-meter mark.
"Cal earned the day today and gave us a
good gauge for where we are at this moment,"
Stanford head coach Yasmin Farooq told
GoStanford.com.
The teams now turn their focus to the Pac
-12 Championships held at Gold River, Calif.,
on May 19.
