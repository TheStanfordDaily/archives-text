## Student course explores zombies 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Zombies may not have always been the
brain-loving, dehumanized remnants of
corpses that we now associate with "The
Walking Dead" and other similar television
shows. In fact, according to Elizabeth
Rosen 'l3 and Bri Evans 'l3, leaders of the
student-initiated course Zombies: Anthro
pology of the American Undead, the mod
ern zombie is just the latest iteration of a
complex and compelling subject.
Rosen and Evans framed the creation
of the course, which they co-teach, as in
spired by a mutual obsession with the liv
ing undead.
"We wanted to do something you could
n't usually take and something that you'd
have fun and we'd have fun with," Rosen
said. "I don't know the context that we
first thought of it in, but we were into zom
bies last year, and we liked to talk about it
and wanted to learn more about it."
Evans cited the dynamism and diversi
ty of the zombie's history as an impetus for
exploring the topic through a student-led
class.
"The zombie is such an interesting fig
ure because you can map its history out,"
Evans emphasized.
In addition to tracing the zombie's his
torical trajectory, the spring quarter class
focuses on the ethnography and culture
surrounding the creature.

"Some people are very obsessed and
have done other research with other per
spectives even before taking this class at
all," she said. "And then some people, they
think it's like a survival class, putting it in
a classroom setting."
History of a monster
Rosen observed that zombies first orig
inated as a Haitian myth, in which dead
bodies were later dug up by a witch doctor,
revived and forced to do labor. It wasn't
until the early 19205, however, that zom
bies appeared in American fictional works,
and until 1932 that the first feature-length
zombie movie, "White Zombie," premiered
to American audiences.
In recent years, zombies have made in
creasingly frequent appearances in Amer
ican culture, from contemporary movies
like "I Am Legend" to books meant for
children and mobile applications.
According to Evans, zombies historical
ly represented a figure akin to slaves,
sharing a lack of control over their move
ments, insufficient nutrition, and even
ragged clothing. She posited, however,
that zombies now allude more frequently
to different trends in American culture,
such as capitalist greed.
"Capitalism is itself a zombie, a mind
less desire to have," she said. "And the rea
son why zombies are so popular is in part
because of the gore and the heroism, but
the idea survives because it's so mutable

for whatever we're feeling at the time."
Evans suggested that zombies might
also represent one side of an ongoing poli
cy debate.
"Early on, it provided a good way to
talk about xenophobia, especially with all
the Eastern European immigrants coming
in during the '6os and '7os," she said. "Dur
ing the Cold War, zombies represented so
cial eonformism â€”the lather, rinse, re
peat lifestyle. It was more a fear of the
zombie rather than of the zombie. Now,
zombies represent nature taking revenge
because science is going too far terror
ism and biological warfare."
Rosen and Evans also argued that zom
bie films provide a broader lens through
which one might view societal upheaval
and apocalypse.
"What happens when we run out of re
sources or food?" Evans said. "What hap
pens when we run out of oil? When there's
an apocalypse, what would we do? Zombie
shows and films are not about zombies [as
much as] about an examination of human
relations."
Preparing for apocalypse
While class discussions often focus on
film screenings or assigned readings, a
prevalent theme in the course is how best
to prepare for a zombie apocalypse.
In fact, students are graded on, among
