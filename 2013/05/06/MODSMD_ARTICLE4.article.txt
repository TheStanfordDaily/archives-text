# University reviews security
## Officials emphasize value of preparedness 
### BRITTANY TORREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In light of last month's manhunt in Boston, which in
cluded a shooting on the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology (MIT) campus, University emergency manage
ment officials have sought to increase awareness within
the University community of responses to such "active
threat" situations.
While the University has never had to deal with an ac
tive threat situation, Chief of Police Laura Wilson '9l not
ed that the Department of Public Safety (SUDPS) has
previously issued "stay away" warnings for specific ar
eas.
In October 2012, students were warned to avoid the
area surrounding the Stanford Golf Course because of a
gas leak. A warning was also issued when shots were
fired in the Lagunita parking lot after Blackfest in 2011.
Wilson said the police presence on campus increases
when such warnings are issued, as well as on days when
more students are present on campus.
"We generally try to match our staffing to the popula
tion as well as activities and events on campus," Wilson
said, noting that the number of SUDPS officers on cam
pus can range from two to more than thirteen.
In an active threat situation, however, campus police
presence could increase to hundreds of officers from sur
rounding agencies.
According to Wilson, SUDPS' main role is to ensure
the safety of the community by mitigating threats and
teaching community members to promote campus safety
through reporting suspicious behavior, taking safety pre
cautions and having a personal preparedness plan.
Wilson suggested that students should create a com
munication plan for active threat situations and attempt
to minimize the number of calls they make during an
emergency, since excessive cellular communication might
hinder emergency responders.
"One of my big concerns is that in a major crisis like
an active shooter, people are going to start tweeting and
sending photos and calling people," Wilson said. "We
could easily overwhelm our cellphone towers."
Ongoing preparation
According to Associate Vice Provost for Emergency
Health and Safety Larry Gibbs, University officials con
stantly re-evaluate their preparedness for any kind of
emergency.
The current policy for dealing with an active threat,
such as an on-campus shooter, has three components:
taking direction from law enforcement, maintaining out
reach to keep the community notified and personal pre
paredness.
Gibbs emphasized the importance of students inform
ing themselves about proper protocol for emergency sit
uations by reading the guidelines and procedures listed
in the Stanford University Emergency Guide. He also
recommended that students keep their contact informa
tion in Axess updated so they can receive AlertSU mes
sages.
"With the very large population that we have here, it's
very important that individuals also become prepared
and knowledgeable," Gibbs said. "Information is very
valuable, and periodically reviewing it to know what to do
in those types of situations is
one of the best things individ
uals can do to protect them
selves."
According to Gibbs, the
first step in managing an
emergency situation tak
ing direction from law en
forcement is crucial in
keeping students safe in the
midst of an active threat, as
emergency situations are
"very fluid in nature" and
"can take many different
pathways."
Gibbs said that in the case
of an active threat situation,
students, faculty and staff
would be asked to "shelter in
place" stay where they
are and take action to protect
themselves until more infor
mation is available.
A shelter in place order
was recently implemented
throughout the entire city of
Boston, including Boston
area schools such as MIT
and Harvard, following the

shooting at MIT.
"One of the things we did
learn [from the MIT shooting]
was that because of the sheer
magnitude of what occurred in
the area that students did stay
in the residences," Gibbs said.
"They did stay in until [the
school] got clearance of what
was going on from law en
forcement."
Though Wilson said that
property crimes like bicycle
and laptop theft are more
common at Stanford than
crimes like sexual assault,
robbery and homicide, she
recommended that students
stay attentive to potential
dangers.
"I do consider it a safe
place for people to be around,
but, with that said, I do think
that people do need to take
appropriate steps to ensure
their own safety," Wilson
said. "This is an open campus
we allow the general pub
lic to come onto campus so
in order to make the commu
nity safe, everyone needs to
play a role."
