# University reviews security
## Officials emphasize value of preparedness 
### BRITTANY TORREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In light of last month's manhunt in Boston, which in
cluded a shooting on the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology (MIT) campus, University emergency manage
ment officials have sought to increase awareness within
the University community of responses to such "active
threat" situations.
While the University has never had to deal with an ac
tive threat situation, Chief of Police Laura Wilson '9l not
ed that the Department of Public Safety (SUDPS) has
previously issued "stay away" warnings for specific ar
eas.
In October 2012, students were warned to avoid the
area surrounding the Stanford Golf Course because of a
gas leak. A warning was also issued when shots were
fired in the Lagunita parking lot after Blackfest in 2011.
Wilson said the police presence on campus increases
when such warnings are issued, as well as on days when
more students are present on campus.
"We generally try to match our staffing to the popula
tion as well as activities and events on campus," Wilson
said, noting that the number of SUDPS officers on cam
pus can range from two to more than thirteen.
In an active threat situation, however, campus police
presence could increase to hundreds of officers from sur
rounding agencies.
According to Wilson, SUDPS' main role is to ensure
the safety of the community by mitigating threats and
teaching community members to promote campus safety
through reporting suspicious behavior, taking safety pre
cautions and having a personal preparedness plan.
Wilson suggested that students should create a com
munication plan for active threat situations and attempt
to minimize the number of calls they make during an
emergency, since excessive cellular communication might
hinder emergency responders.
"One of my big concerns is that in a major crisis like
an active shooter, people are going to start tweeting and
sending photos and calling people," Wilson said. "We
could easily overwhelm our cellphone towers."
Ongoing preparation
According to Associate Vice Provost for Emergency
Health and Safety Larry Gibbs, University officials con
stantly re-evaluate their preparedness for any kind of
emergency.
The current policy for dealing with an active threat,
such as an on-campus shooter, has three components:
taking direction from law enforcement, maintaining out
reach to keep the community notified and personal pre
paredness.
Gibbs emphasized the importance of students inform
ing themselves about proper protocol for emergency sit
uations by reading the guidelines and procedures listed
in the Stanford University Emergency Guide. He also
recommended that students keep their contact informa
tion in Axess updated so they can receive AlertSU mes
sages.
"With the very large population that we have here, it's
very important that individuals also become prepared
and knowledgeable," Gibbs said. "Information is very
valuable, and periodically reviewing it to know what to do
