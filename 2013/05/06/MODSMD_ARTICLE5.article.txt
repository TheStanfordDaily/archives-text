## Research team develops hybrid flow battery 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A team of Stanford researchers recently unveiled a
new low-cost, high-capacity, hybrid flow battery that
can stabilize fluctuations in wind and solar power to en
able greater use of renewable energy sources.
The researchers published their findings in a study
co-authored by Associate Professor of Materials Sci
ence and Engineering Yi Cui, Yuan Yang M.S. 'lO Ph.D.
'l2 and third-year doctoral candidate Wesley Zheng.
Cui, who began teaching at Stanford eight years ago,
put together a research team to create innovative meth
ods of energy storage, such as batteries for cellphones,
laptops and electrical cars, as well as stationary forms
of storage like solar cells and wind farms.
According to Cui, the new hybrid battery differs sig
nificantly from the traditional flow battery, which Cui
described as "battery electrodes that are liquid and can
flow."
The team's hybrid battery uses a new cathode with
higher energy density and a
solid as the negative elec
trode so that the battery on
ly "half flows," according to
Cui. The researchers also
eliminated the need for an
ion-selective membrane,
which is typically found in
flow batteries and can be ex
pensive.
"We potentially have
four-times-higher energy
compared to the other flow
batteries that have already
been developed," Cui said.
"[The new battery] stores a
lot of charges, which is so im
portant for solar storage to
reduce the cost."
Zheng, Yang and Cui be
gan collaborating on the bat
tery's creation last year. Ac
cording to Zheng, the proj
ect was born out of a discus
sion about how to improve
lithium-sulfur batteries so
that the sulfur would not dis
solve into the electrolytes.
Zheng said that the bat
tery was specifically de
signed to fix some of the

problems found in other
types of flow batteries, such
as the high operating tem
perature of the sodium-sul
fur battery.
"Most technologies have
been developed a while back
and have a lot of disadvan
tages," Zheng said. "The
system that we have devel
oped here is trying to adjust
to those problems. We are
trying to apply the system at
room temperature and work
without the ion-selective
membrane. It's pretty prom
ising technology."
The battery developed by
Cui's team uses solid lithium
anodes and a polysulfide
catholyte in liquid form that
is stored in a separate tank.
Yang said that the battery's
design is unique in that the
voltage range of cycling is
controlled, eliminating some
of the detrimental discharge
effects of traditional lithium
sulfur batteries.
According to Yang, the
battery is also distinguished
by its high-energy density
and low cost, as the materi
als used to create it are rela
tively inexpensive. Though
the battery has not yet been
deployed in a real energy

system, Zheng estimated
that it will cost $45 per kilo
watt hour less than half of
the price of competing flow
batteries, which can cost up
wards of $lOO per kilowatt
hour.
"In large-scale energy
storage, the most important
thing is the cost and the cy
cle life," Yang said. "It will
stabilize the power output
for renewable energy, which
is its major application."
According to Zheng, the
team plans to focus on imple
menting the battery in solar
and wind energy systems, as
it could be used to store ex
cess energy as a backup in a
time of an energy deficit.
"Solar and wind energy
are intermittent in nature.
The disadvantage of a lot of
renewable energy sources is
that they cannot produce en
ergy all the time," Zheng
said. "If you can store the
energy and then produce en
ergy from the grid, you allow
these renewable energy
sources to be more applica
ble to a lot of situations and
you can allow it to play a
more important role."
Cui's team is currently
working on improving the

battery's performance, and
Cui estimated that within
the next three years, the
team will test the battery on
a real electrical grid. Cui
said that he eventually hopes
to make the battery avail
able in the commercial mar
ket.
"Our plan is to under
stand some of the logical
constraints and potential is
sues and then to build a big
ger system so we can plug it
together with the solar cell
or wind device and do the re
al demonstration," he said.
