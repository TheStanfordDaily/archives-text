## Research team develops hybrid flow battery 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A team of Stanford researchers recently unveiled a
new low-cost, high-capacity, hybrid flow battery that
can stabilize fluctuations in wind and solar power to en
able greater use of renewable energy sources.
The researchers published their findings in a study
co-authored by Associate Professor of Materials Sci
ence and Engineering Yi Cui, Yuan Yang M.S. 'lO Ph.D.
'l2 and third-year doctoral candidate Wesley Zheng.
Cui, who began teaching at Stanford eight years ago,
put together a research team to create innovative meth
ods of energy storage, such as batteries for cellphones,
laptops and electrical cars, as well as stationary forms
of storage like solar cells and wind farms.
According to Cui, the new hybrid battery differs sig
nificantly from the traditional flow battery, which Cui
described as "battery electrodes that are liquid and can
flow."
The team's hybrid battery uses a new cathode with
