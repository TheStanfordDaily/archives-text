## BAF protein complex may prevent cancer 
### â€” Justine Moore 
Researchers at the Stan
ford School of Medicine have
discovered that BAF protein
complexes may prevent the
development of tumors in mul
tiple kinds of human tissue.
The team's results, which
found mutations in the com
plex in about one-fifth of all
human cancers, were pub
lished in a study in Nature Ge
netics on May 5. The study
was co-authored by postdoc
toral scholars Cigall Kadoch
Ph.D. 'l2 RD. 'l3, Diana Harg
reaves and Courtney Hodges,
former lab members Laura
Elias and Lena Ho Ph.D. 'lO,
Professor of Pathology and of
Developmental Biology Ger
ald Crabtree and Jeff Ranish,
an assistant professor at the
Institute of Systems Biology.

The researchers used data
from their own experiments,
as well as shared data from 44
previous studies, to determine

that a mutation of even one of
the subunits of the BAF com
plex could spur the develop
ment of cancer. In the future,
the researchers hope to inves
tigate how the mutations im
pact the ability of the protein
complex to suppress the devel
opment of tumors.
"We certainly want to fur
ther our understanding of the
mechanism behind these find
ings," Hargreaves told Inside
Stanford Medicine. "Do they
promote cancer development
by inhibiting the proper pro
gression of the cell cycle? Or
perhaps they affect how the
complex is positioned on the
DNA. We'd like to determine
how to recapitulate some of
these mutations experimental
ly to see what types of defects
they introduce into the com
plex."
The study was funded by
the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute, the Helen Hay
Whitney Foundation, the Na
tional Science Foundation and
the National Institutes of
Health.
