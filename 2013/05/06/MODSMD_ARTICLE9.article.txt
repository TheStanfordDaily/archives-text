## Treat Griner like you treat Jason Collins 
### Ashley Westhem 
For the past week, ESPN
broadcasts and newspaper
sports' sections have been
analyzing the announce
ment made by Jason
Collins that he's gay and the effect
that it will have on the LGBT commu
nities, and most importantly, in the
realm of sports.
In the week following Baylor
basketball sensation Brittney
Griner's announcement that she is
gay, there wasn't close to the same
amount of coverage. And I wouldn't
be surprised if this is your first time
hearing this news about Griner.
All the talk I've heard on campus
has evolved around Collins and how
he is going to help so many people
with his announcement and promote
acceptance for gay athletes every
where. My friends were shocked
when I told them that Griner also
recently came out and even more
shocked that they hadn't heard of it
anywhere, considering what a public
figure she is in the world of basket
ball.
So why didn't Griner's coming
out have the same effect?
Because she can dunk, is so
strong and plays a stereotypically
male sport she has unfeminine
qualities, basically â€”it was easier
to accept that she is gay.
The mostly welcome reception of
Collins' sexuality proves that maybe
we didn't have that much to worry
about after all the athletic com
munity and nation as a whole are be
coming a lot more accepting.
The bigger issue, I believe, is the
differing reaction to Griner and
Collins coming out. Both are suc
cessful basketball players, but
Griner is an even more relevant
sports figure because of the recent
nature of her achievements.
I am a little biased though, since
I have been covering women's bas
ketball all year and know that
women on the Stanford team are
friends with Griner so naturally
I'm going to come to her defense.
But it is interesting that people
have been waiting for the first male
athlete in a major sport to come out
before the concept of athletes being
gay could be legitimized. The as
sumption is that the implications of
being gay for a female athlete are
smaller than for a male, so they
don't garner that much attention.
Male or female, it shouldn't matter,
because both have to come to terms
with combining their social lives
with their athletic careers.
Both Collins and Griner stated
that they wanted to start the con
versation of athletes being gay for
the next generation, so that others
would feel more comfortable and ac
cepted. Collins was definitely a fig
ure looked up to during his time
here on the Farm and his declara
tion will no doubt provide inspira
tion for athletes and others who
share his sexuality around the na
tion.
But female athletes are also
looked up to and should be given the
same national attention to promote
progress in relation to gay sports.
Unfortunately, Griner was not given
that opportunity.
The non-reaction to Griner is al
most an insult to female athletes. It
assumes that they don't have the
same anxiety and pressures to deal
with since they're considered mas
culine already, or that they don't
have the same impact as the male
athletes who share their sport. It
proves that there is still a distinct
gap between and a sexist mentality
surrounding the perception of male
and female athletes.
Collins may have been the first
male athlete to come out as an ac
tive player of a major American
profession sport, but let's not for
get that Billie Jean King began
paving the way for gay athletes in
1981. But because she is a female,
she is hardily given any recogni
tion.
Griner may not be the most
feminine female athlete, but just
because she can dunk and has
been talked about as potentially
being able to play in the NBA be
cause of her strength and other
worldly basketball skills doesn't
mean that her announcement
should be any less shocking or
have any less of an impact on the
LGBT and athletic communities.
Give credit where credit is due.
