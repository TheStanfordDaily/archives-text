# CARD KEEPS ON CLICKING
## Earns first ever sweep of Cal 
### MICHAEL PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a crucial weekend series
with Cal, about the only thing hot
ter than the Cardinal bats was the
weather. No. 16 Stanford (35-17,
12-9 Pac-12) cruised to a three
game sweep of No. 12 Cal (35-15,9-
12 Pac-12) with 13-5, 17-2 and 7-5
victories on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday respectively to record its
first-ever season sweep of Cal. The
Cardinal's 37 runs on the weekend
marked the most runs that the
team has produced in a series on
the year, easily eclipsing the previ
ous high of 29 runs set last week
end against Utah.
"We made some switches to the
lineup and those switches have
paid dividends," said head coach
John Rittman. "The kids are
swinging the bat well; they're see
ing the ball we 11... Hitting is conta
gious, I think that's what's hap-

On a weekend of shattered of
fensive records, senior shortstop
Jenna Rich made the most impres
sive one on Friday as she broke
Stanford's all-time RBI record,
previously set by Sarah Beeson 'O2
with 201 RBI. Other records taken
down included the largest margin
of victory ever over Cal (15), most
hits in a single game on the season
(17) and most runs in a single game
on the season (17).
Rich was not only the star on
Friday with her RBI record but al
so the most explosive player of the
entire weekend. Rich collected sev
en hits, including two home runs
and 10 RBI in the three-game
sweep, raising her batting average
to .327. Rich's 44 career home runs
rank second in school history. For
her dominant performance at the
plate, Rich was named Pac-12
Player of the Week on Monday.

Freshman first baseman Kayla
Bonstrom had four hits and four
runs, both career highs, as well as
four RBI in Saturday's game to
add to what has been a superb
freshman campaign. Bonstrom's
seven home runs and 43 RBI rank
second on the team behind only
Rich, and her .396 batting average
is by far the highest on the squad.
She now has 15 hits in her last 22 at
bats with three home runs in that
span.
"[Bonstrom] has been on fire
lately," Rich said. "She has a really
good eye, she gets on base,
whether it's a walk or getting a hit
with two strikes... It's setting the
tone for the rest of us."
On the other side of the ball,
Kelsey Stevens threw a masterful
one-hitter against Cal on Saturday,
allowing only one hit, and tied her
season-high with 12 strikeouts.
She also picked up the win on Sun
day with another complete game
her ninth on the season.
Stevens and senior Teagan
Gerhart outpitched an over

pened over the last two weekends."

were unable to adequately fill her
spot, surrendering most of the runs
in the series.
Stanford now returns home to
host Santa Clara on Tuesday before
a three-game series against Ari
zona to wrap-up the regular season
this weekend. Stanford and Santa
Clara met back in February, when
the Cardinal took down the Bron
cos (8-45, 5-19 WCC) in an 8-0 mer
cy-rule win.
In that first game, Gerhart dom
inated, giving up only one hit in five
innings for her first shutout of the
season. Senior centerfielder Sarah
Hassman had a strong day at the
plate, knocking in three runs on two
hits, including an RBI single in the
bottom of the fifth to seal the lop
sided victory.
After starting 6-9 in a brutal Pac
-12 field filled with elite teams, Stan
ford has rebounded with six straight
conference victories and proven it
self to be a legitimate contender. Af
ter back-to-back series sweeps of
Utah and California, Stanford could
potentially secure the chance to host
a postseason regional with a good

performance against Arizona.
But during that impressive Pac
-12 streak, Stanford suffered a string
of midweek slides that could be its
undoing, falling in three straight
non-conference games to much
weaker opponents. A fourth consec
utive midweek loss to Santa Clara
could very well shoot down the Car
dinal's hopes of hosting an NCAA
Regional.
That's why Rittman is so focused
on the Broncos.
"[The biggest thing] for us is to
come out mentally, physically, and
emotionally ready to play against
Santa Clara on Tuesday night,"
Rittman said, "so we build some mo
mentum going into the next week

After starting 6-9 in a brutal Pac
-12 field filled with elite teams, Stan
ford has rebounded with six straight
conference victories and proven it
self to be a legitimate contender. Af
ter back-to-back series sweeps of
Utah and California, Stanford could
potentially secure the chance to host
a postseason regional with a good

performance against Arizona.
But during that impressive Pac
-12 streak, Stanford suffered a string
of midweek slides that could be its
undoing, falling in three straight
non-conference games to much
weaker opponents. A fourth consec
utive midweek loss to Santa Clara
could very well shoot down the Car
dinal's hopes of hosting an NCAA
Regional.
That's why Rittman is so focused
on the Broncos.
"[The biggest thing] for us is to
come out mentally, physically, and
emotionally ready to play against
Santa Clara on Tuesday night,"
Rittman said, "so we build some mo
mentum going into the next week
end."
First pitch TUesday against San

In a crucial weekend series
with Cal, about the only thing hot
ter than the Cardinal bats was the
weather. No. 16 Stanford (35-17,
12-9 Pac-12) cruised to a three
game sweep of No. 12 Cal (35-15,9-
12 Pac-12) with 13-5, 17-2 and 7-5
victories on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday respectively to record its
first-ever season sweep of Cal. The
Cardinal's 37 runs on the weekend
marked the most runs that the
team has produced in a series on
the year, easily eclipsing the previ
ous high of 29 runs set last week
end against Utah.
"We made some switches to the
lineup and those switches have
paid dividends," said head coach
John Rittman. "The kids are
swinging the bat well; they're see
ing the ball we 11... Hitting is conta
gious, I think that's what's hap-

On a weekend of shattered of
fensive records, senior shortstop
Jenna Rich made the most impres
sive one on Friday as she broke
Stanford's all-time RBI record,
previously set by Sarah Beeson 'O2
with 201 RBI. Other records taken
down included the largest margin
of victory ever over Cal (15), most
hits in a single game on the season
(17) and most runs in a single game
on the season (17).
Rich was not only the star on
Friday with her RBI record but al
so the most explosive player of the
entire weekend. Rich collected sev
en hits, including two home runs
and 10 RBI in the three-game
sweep, raising her batting average
to .327. Rich's 44 career home runs
rank second in school history. For
her dominant performance at the
plate, Rich was named Pac-12
Player of the Week on Monday.

Freshman first baseman Kayla
Bonstrom had four hits and four
runs, both career highs, as well as
four RBI in Saturday's game to
add to what has been a superb
freshman campaign. Bonstrom's
seven home runs and 43 RBI rank
second on the team behind only
Rich, and her .396 batting average
is by far the highest on the squad.
She now has 15 hits in her last 22 at
bats with three home runs in that
span.
"[Bonstrom] has been on fire
lately," Rich said. "She has a really
good eye, she gets on base,
whether it's a walk or getting a hit
with two strikes... It's setting the
tone for the rest of us."
On the other side of the ball,
Kelsey Stevens threw a masterful
one-hitter against Cal on Saturday,
allowing only one hit, and tied her
season-high with 12 strikeouts.
She also picked up the win on Sun
day with another complete game
her ninth on the season.

Gerhart outpitched an over
