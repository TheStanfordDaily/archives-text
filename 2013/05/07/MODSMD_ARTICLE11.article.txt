## USF looks to play spoiler 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
Going into last weekend's series
against No. 17 Arizona State, the
Cardinal baseball squad needed a
series victory to keep its hat in the
postseason ring. Aided by timely
hitting, a Pac-12 Player of the Week
performance from senior starting
pitcher Mark Appel and a harrow
ing 11-inning escape, No. 21 Stan
ford claimed two games in the
three-game series and escaped
Tempe with its postseason hopes
still alive. Before another critical
three-game set this weekend
against Pac-12 heavyweight Oregon
State, the Cardinal (26-16, 11-10
Pac-12) will welcome San Francisco
(29-19, 14-7 WCC) to Sunken Dia
mond tonight.
The Dons are arguably Stan
ford's toughest Tuesday night draw
this season, as USF is riding a hot
streak into the matchup. The Dons
have won five straight and seven of
their last eight games. USF has
been a streaky team all year, with
its losses and wins coming in bunch
es, including a stretch earlier this
season in which it won 11 of 12.
In addition, USF has shown an
ability to hang with the big boys, as
it has claimed a victory against both
defending national champion Ari
zona and Oregon State earlier this
season, outscoring both teams in
their three and two game series, re
spectively. The Dons are fully com
fortable playing the role of spoiler.
The Cardinal had a tough time
against USF in last year's matchup
with the Dons, as Stanford had to
push across four late runs en route
to a 6-3 comeback victory. Stanford
will look to take the drama out of
this year's matchup heading into
the crucial Oregon State series.
The Dons mirror the Cardinal in
that their strength lies in their
pitching. USF boasts a formidable
team ERA of 3.26 with a lights-out
bullpen, as six Dons relievers have
ERAs of below 2.89.
