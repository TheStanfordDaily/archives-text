## WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE Thank God Almighty for Elites 
### Chris Herries 
I was fortunate enough to go to
Stanford Taiko's spring show at
the Bing Concert Hall this past
Saturday. First off, major props to
Stanford Taiko for an amazing per
formance; it was really fun to
watch. And second, thank God for
elites like the Bing family for mak
ing world-class concert venues pos
sible!
My fellow-columnist Adam
Johnson recently wrote a piece
based loosely off William Deresei
wicz's "The Disadvantages of an
Elite Education," which, if my
reading is correct, was a condemna
tion of Stanford's perpetuation of
an elite class. As with all of Mr.
Johnson's columns, it's worth the
read. However, I must take excep
tion to some of his points.
To reiterate, thank God
Almighty we're creating elites! In
the past 150 years, medical elites
have doubled human life expectan
cy all over the world. Elite Western
medical establishments have given
mankind the ability to literally
eradicate diseases like smallpox
and rinderpest. And, no matter how
much you loathe pharmaceutical
companies, the elite executives who
runs these businesses have created
platforms for sustained research
while making medications avail
able.
Hell, I'm typing on a device that
gives me access to the entire corpus
of human knowledge. Who devel
oped these things? Elite engineers
and programmers. Who made them
available to me? Elite entrepre
neurs and businessmen. It's hard to
look around my room and find
something that wasn't the product
of a dynamic, innovative, talented,
free man who was either elite in his
field or was funded by elites.
Now, for the sake of not talking
straight past each other, I'll offer a
caveat. I probably take a much
more expansive view of the phrase
elite than most people. Most people
envision a fictitious group of old
white guys in a room, smoking ci
gars, rubbing their hands together
while examining gold doubloons
through their monocles.
I, however, take the more ex
pansive view of elites: that they're
people valued by society, and con
sidered the best of that society, be
cause of things like talent, charisma
and wealth. That probably doesn't
sound too appealing either, but
think about it: Without wealthy,
powerful people, there would be no
Stanford University. There would
be no patrons of the arts. There
would be no masterpieces to read.
My Classics professors would nev
er have been able to become classi-

cists without a wealthy university
willing to support them.
That's the long way of saying
that there is nothing wrong with the
existence of, or being, a member of
the elite. So what's the problem?
Well, to oversimplify the argument
for the sake of a column, there are
two potential dangers with the con
cept of elites. The first is being an
asshole. Unfortunately, articles like
Mr. Johnson's make it easy to con
flate being an elite with being a shit
ty human being. Suffice it to say,
there is something wrong with be
ing an asshole. Not cleaning up af
ter yourself in the lounge is some
thing very few of us do. The few
that are messy are assholes. It's a
titanic step in logic to say that the
handful of people who mess up a
lounge are indicative of culture of
entitlement, or that eating in a din
ing hall for four years somehow
hampers my ability to interact with
other people. Heck, loads of univer
sity students will be cared for dur
ing their tenure, but that doesn't
equate to a life of being out of touch.
And as for Dereseiwicz's piece,
the idea that easy extensions or lax
grading creates leaders who'll be
irresponsible enough to tank the
United States' economy is absurd.
These guys aren't the inevitable
product of a university system gone
haywire; they're just assholes.
Hard truth time: Assholes can be
found throughout society. A greedy
car mechanic may only screw indi
viduals while a greedy corporate
executive screws countries, but,
guess what, they're both greedy.
So, yes, there are elites who are
assholes and tank the US economy.
To make the leap and say Stan
ford's education made this particu
lar bad executive, keeping in mind
that bad CEOs are a minority of
CEOs, is ridiculous. There are also
elites who fund trusts that are com

bating the HIV epidemic and creat
ing microfinance opportunities in
the third world. And, yes, there are
companies, for-profit companies,
that provide invaluable services. If
we're going to criticize institutions
like Stanford for bad elites, our
next breath better laud the elites it
produces who champion and lead
humanity. As I pointed out in a pre
vious, albeit verbose, column, we
here, with our wealth of resources,
are practically obliged to become
those good elites and continue to
serve humanity.
For brevity, I'll keep my second
point about elites short. An elite
class is only bad in the absence of

fluidity. I'd love to live in a world
where the elite class is accessible to
anyone who is hardworking, talent
ed and charismatic enough to break
in. The upper echelons of our socie
ty could certainly use some more
diversity and Stanford helps do
just that. We draw on the most tal
ented individuals from vastly dif
ferent backgrounds, and give gen
erous financial aid to those who
can't afford to come here. The Ivy
League, and other elite universities
worth their salt, do the same. This
increased diversity will be a boon to
society down the road.
Is that all to say that non-elites
are somehow worthless? Of course

not. Everyone is deserving of love
and respect. With that in mind, we
need to be the kind of elites that
cure cancer, build cheap, earth
quake-proof structures in Pakistan,
end wars and generate famine-re
sistant crops for East Africa. I
think Stanford provides the oppor
tunities for us to do these great
things and attempts to produce
these types of elites.

So get out in the world, start
helping people and be the best our
civilization has to offer.

Without wealthy,

there would be
no Stanford
University.
