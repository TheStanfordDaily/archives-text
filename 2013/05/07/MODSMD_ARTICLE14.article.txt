## The 						Guilt of Having an Ordinary Summer 
### Alex Bayer 
UT F your back is hurting,
I maybe don't stretch so
J. much. Check your align
ment." I was in yoga class, and this
phrase, which normally slips
through my ears without notice,
caught my attention. You see, I have
been preoccupied with this very
thought for the last two weeks:
What is the balance between cen
tering myself and pushing myself?
At a place like Stanford, this is
no easy task. Take, for example,
summer plans. I've found that
whenever I pose that question to
my classmates, I leave with a
bruised ego. One of my friends is
doing a photography study of hip
hop culture in Norway; another one
of my friends is working with a so
cial activist circus in Cape Town.
Still another one of my friends is in
terning with an NGO in Santiago
and going to Rio to study its favelas.
I did try; months ago, I sat down
and researched grants and fellow
ships. I researched about places and
people I could research. I was on
the lookout for some story, some
niche in the universe that would fire
me up. Maybe food culture in Hong
Kong... ? Attitudes about death in
Japan... ? Folklore in Ireland? But
at the end of the day, I could not
muster the energy to write a grant
proposal, and the deadlines, as they
are wont to do, slipped by.
February, March, April... as the
months passed, my options began to
winnow themselves out. I submitted
a few applications here and there,

just to stay afloat. But to cut a long
story short, it looks like I am head
ing home for the summer.
I say this with a tinge of reti
cence, as if not quite ready to be
lieve it myself. Why the guilt? Isn't
this a thing normal college kids do?
Go back home, mow lawns for some
spending money, haunt some high
school parties? I think back to the
college students trolling around my
hometown. There was an air of mys
tery about them and they seemed
older, cooler. Now I'm them,
strangely enough. Wouldn't it be
kind of fun to pretend I'm a little
cooler?
It's never easy to trust your own
voice; such is the lot of twenty
somethings still figuring out who
they are. But the problem is espe
cially magnified at Stanford: We're
worried about our future, we're in
secure, and we're success-driven.
It's a given that we compare our-

selves to others, but the caliber of
things we're doing is abnormally
awesome. A circus? Biking across
America? A fellowship in Sao Paolo?
It's a sheer effort of will, every time,
to remind myself that it's OK I'm
not doing any of these things. I'm
going... home. Maybe I'll work at
my public library. Maybe I'll spend
my afternoons walking my dog.
"That's OK," I have to tell myself
(it's harder than it looks).
When I sit back and allow myself
to be all right with it, I actually start

getting excited more than I will ad
mit to most people. I think of the
mundane possibilities (Grocery
shopping! Eating at the Chili's
where all the high schoolers go!
Walking my dog!) and a swell of joy
rises in me. I'm even thinking of
ways I can rediscover my home
town and change it in meaningful
ways, and all of a sudden I feel the
passion I kept waiting for a cool
sounding fellowship in a foreign
country to elicit in me.
Then I realize: The reason I've

been driving to Barnes and Noble
or studying in Starbucks? They re
mind me of their carbon copies back
home. Home was tugging at me all
along. Home was what I needed.
And now it's what I'm wanting. Ah,
clarity. Once I stopped trying to find
something to want and simply lis
tened to what I needed, it took care
of itself. It turns out the two are
sometimes the same.
