## For Johnny Moreno, an unsung passing Moreno, 21, passed away in March 2012 accident 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On March 9th, 2012, 21-year
old Johnny Moreno was struck
by a frontloading garbage truck
on the corner of Mayfield Avenue
and Santa Ynez Street. The acci
dent, which occurred between La
Maison Frangaise and Phi Kappa
Psi, just a few blocks from Presi
dent John Hennessy's house,
would later prove fatal for
Moreno, who passed away sever
al weeks later.
Death at Stanford is general
ly big news. Most students know
the names of Sam Wopat, Cady
Hine, Akash Dube or Elizabeth
Gao the University is a small
community, and such loss reach
es far and deep. For Johnny

Moreno, however, there was no
such recognition, no matter how
overdue or merited.

Moreno became a driver for
Peninsula Sanitary Services Inc.
(PSSI) at the age of 19. Accord
ing to his childhood friend and
coworker Andrew Pellegrini,
Moreno was headed in a bad di
rection during his freshman year
of high school. Before too long,
his dad sent him off to a family
friend's house in Coalinga, Calif.
"His dad said, 'l'm not gonna
let this happen,' so he sent him
off to the cattle ranch," Pellegrini
remembered.
Pellegrini, also a driver at
PSSI, recalled that Moreno re
turned with more than just a
cowboy twang.
"He came back a great per
son," Pellegrini said. "He came
back a cowboy with really great

Johnny Moreno, a driver for Peninsula Sanitary Services, was hit by
a garbage truck between French House and Phi Psi in March
2012, passing away weeks later. Colleagues and friends remember
him as a cowboy with a selfless attitude and great work ethic.
morals and a really great
work ethic. They don't make
people with work ethic like
that anymore."
Thomas Ott, fleet manag
er and safety officer at PSSI,
called Moreno "a throw
back."
"He was a true cowboy,"
Ott said.
One night, Moreno and
Pellegrini went to the Old
Pro bar in Palo Alto with
some friends. Putting his
newfound cowboy skills to
the test, Moreno decided to
take a ride on the bar's me
chanical bull.
"We went with [Johnny]
and, I mean, he's actually rid
den bulls before, so they could
n't throw him off of it," Pelligri
ni remembered, laughing. "He
ended up getting a T-shirt
and his picture on the wall,
all that stuff."
On the morning of March
9th, 2012, Moreno took a
route he'd driven before,
emptying dumpsters on
Mayfield Ave. According to
Ott, some dumpsters have
wheels on them, to make it
easier to roll them out of
their resting places.
That morning, Moreno
failed to follow proper safety
procedures. PSSI training
teaches drivers to always po
sition the truck downhill
from the dumpster, allowing
the truck to stop the dump
ster if it starts to roll.

Moreno's truck, however,
was parked uphill from this
particular dumpster.
Soon after, Moreno some
how lost control of the bin.
As it rolled down the street,
he jumped out of his truck to
grab the dumpster but
left his truck in neutral. The
truck rolled down the hill and
into a house on Mayfield, but
only after crushing Moreno
against the dumpster.
"The bin started to roll,
and I guarantee you the first
thing he thought was 'I don't
want that bin to hit that per
son's car,"' Pellegrini said.
"That's the type of person
he was. He didn't want to
damage someone else's prop
erty."
Ott agreed, reflecting
that Moreno's pride in his
work likely meant he reacted
without considering his own
safety.
After the accident,
Moreno was rushed to hospi
tal, where friends and family

would visit him every day for
several weeks as he recov
ered.
"It was common knowl
edge that it was touch-and
go, and we didn't have a lot of
hope," Ott, who visited
Moreno every day and some
times several times a day,
said. "Then it took a turn for
the better, and we had a lot of
hope."
"The last time I saw
Johnny alive, I left the hospi
tal thinking this kid is gonna
make it," Ott recalled. "He
shook my hand and looked
me in the eyes. I walked out
thinking, 'He's gonna survive
this.'"
Later that day, Moreno
went into respiratory arrest.
He was eventually revived,
but it was too late. Brain
scans revealed little to no ac
tivity. He passed away sever
al days later.
