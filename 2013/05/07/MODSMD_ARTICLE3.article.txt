# Counseling sees gender gap
## Women more likely to go to CAPS, men to Bridge 
### LUCY SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A sustained gender gap in stu
dents' usage of different mental
health resources has emerged on
campus, according to data from the
University's Counseling and Psycho
logical Services (CAPS) and the
Bridge Peer Counseling Center.
While female students constitute
48 percent of Stanford's undergradu
ate population and 37 percent of
Stanford's graduate population, 58
percent of students who have sought
assistance from CAPS over the past
four years have been female.
"In general, what you find
through all medical care as well as in
mental health care is that women
tend to use services more than men,"
said Ronald Albucher, director of
CAPS. "In the general population
that's true, it's true in mental health
and it's true at CAPS also."
Meanwhile, the Bridge has seen a
gender gap emerge in the opposite
direction. Patrick McGuire '73, a
Bridge peer counselor, reported that
in the 2011-2012 academic school
year, the Bridge found that 57 per
cent of those seeking counseling
services were male and 43 percent
were female.
"For us it is always encouraging
to see the kind of data that is atypi
cal, because it does reinforce the no
tion that our services are providing
something that is not solely provided
by CAPS or by professional servic
es," McGuire said. "It is reassuring
that perhaps we do provide a more
accessible resource for some popula
tions."
Addressing the gender disparity
at CAPS, Albucher acknowledged
several different hypotheses.
"Women tend to interact more
with other people, so this model is
more familiar and comfortable," Al
bucher said. "Men are taught to
tough it out and it shows weakness if
you have to go to somebody and so I
think there are all of those stereo
types that men have to deal with."
Nikita Desai 'l5, co-president of

the student health organization
Stanford Peace of Mind (SPoM), not
ed that her group has noticed pre
dominately female interest among
students involved with SPoM's men
tal health panels.
"I think that just goes back to the
unfortunate fact that in our society it
is not necessarily considered 'manly'
to open up and talk about issues that
you may be facing, express your
emotions and as a result be able to

seek out help for it," Desai said. "I
think that they don't feel as comfort
able opening up about things and
there is a larger culture of silence in
general among males."
Desai framed the Bridge's pre
dominantly male audience as indicative
of an equal need across genders for
mental health support and services.
"Clearly, based on the Bridge

counselors' experiences,
there is the need, though not
expressed overtly, for mental
health services and increased
dialogue and openness within
the male community," Desai
said.
"Male students may be
less inclined where they get
to the point to go get services,
open up to people about con
cerns and deal with them, but
that's not to say that those is
sues don't exist and that they
don't deal with the same is

sues," she added.
Both SPoM and CAPS
have mounted efforts to ad
dress the gender gap. CAPS
has notably sought to in
crease outreach to the male
international graduate stu
dent population, a group that
is according to Albueher
naturally predisposed to
underutilization of mental
health services.
SPoM, meanwhile, is cur
rently working to schedule a
mental health panel for the
Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) this quarter. SPoM had
a panel focused on the Inter-
Sorority Council at the end of
fall quarter, which Desai said
received a strong reception.

According to Desai, the
IFC expressed interest in
having such a panel because
it recognized the existence of
mental health issues among
members.
"I think that the key to
open discussion is revealing
vulnerability and letting oth
er people reveal their own
vulnerability and that's what
fosters dialogues," she said.
"In general that is more in
line with the female culture
than the male culture and I
think that leads to some of
these issues, but hopefully
that can be addressed."
