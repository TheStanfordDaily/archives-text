## Morality of money affects view of value Research by Robb Willer finds moral judgment shapes economic decisions 
### JACKLYN TREJO 
How you earn your money may actually
matter, according to a recent study by Profes
sor of Sociology Robb Wilier that suggests that
most people consider "morally tainted" money
to be less valuable than money earned fairly.
Wilier co-authored the study with Jennifer
Stellar, a doctoral student at UC-Berkeley,
who became interested in working on the study
after witnessing recent examples of companies
acting immorally.
"These incidents [meant] to cut corners and
make more profit are unfortunate," she said. "I
wanted to know how people felt."
The study challenges the commonly accept
ed idea that people are willing to compromise
their morality when tempted with financial
gain and instead emphasizes the role of a moral
compass in making choices about money.
"Morality is an important force shaping
economic decisions," Wilier said. "It explains
why companies vet investors to ensure they
are not immoral, why we boycott goods and
companies that we believe have behaved im
morally and, in turn, why companies go to such
great lengths to behave morally, or to at least
appear that way to the public."
The team worked for two and a half years
on the study, which was conducted in two parts.
During the first part of the study, 59 college
students at UC-Berkeley were split into two
groups and asked to place a value on a basket
of goods.
The first group was told that they could fill
out up to 70 raffle tickets that would enter
them to win a $5O cash prize sponsored by Tar
get, and the second group was told they would
compete to win a $5O cash
prize sponsored by Wal-
Mart.
The second group was
then asked to read an article
about the 2005 lawsuit
against Wal-Mart for failing
to meet labor standards.
The group members were
also told that the raffle prize
was likely being paid for by
morally tainted profits.
Participants who filled
out raffle tickets that they
felt were linked to immoral
money filled out far fewer
than those who felt that the
money was neutral.
Both groups were also
asked to estimate the value
of a variety of goods similar
to the first basket of goods
that they evaluated. Partici
pants acted under the as
sumption that they would
purchase this second basket
using the $5O from the raf
fle.
The researchers found
that those with morally

tainted money perceived
the value of their money to
be much less than the par
ticipants with normal mon
ey-
"For me, the most sur
prising finding is that moral
associations are so strong
that they can affect how
much you think your money
can buy you," Stellar said.
"Money isn't just money."
In the second part of the
study, which was conducted
online, the team recruited
140 participants ranging in
age from 18 to 68, in an ef
fort to prove that the stu
dent sample's conclusion
would "also hold in a more
diverse sample of Ameri
cans," according to Wilier.
The online participants
were given the same infor
mation about the Wal-Mart
lawsuit and again split into
two groups. The first group
was asked to describe a time
when they recently acted
morally, while the second
group was asked to describe
a neutral event.
Both groups were then
told that Wal-Mart had pro
vided the funding to pay for
the online tasks they corn

pleted. Those who had de
scribed a recent moral ac
tion did not hesitate to take
the morally tainted money,
according to Stellar.
"If we can take away the
feeling of immorality, taking
the money isn't a problem,"
Stellar said. "People think,
'I know I'm a good person,
this isn't going to make me a
bad person.'"
Stellar is currently de
veloping another study to
investigate how people
spend money that they con
sider to be morally tainted.
She said that she expects
that they may attempt to
"cleanse it" by donating or
through other means.
"When we asked people
whether they wanted the
[tainted] money in a hypo
thetical situation, a lot of
people didn't want the mon
ey, but a few said, 'l'll take it
and donate it,"' Stellar said.
"We think they might be
cleansing the money and fix
ing the negative valence of
the money to make it neu
tral."
