## MasterCard to fund 5 student scholarships Credit card, giant will disburse $500 million through education initiative 
### CARA REICHARD DESK EDITOR 
When the Class of 2017 arrives on campus
this fall, there will be a unique group of students
among them. Five students from sub-Saharan
Mica will join Stanford as the inaugural class of
MasterCard Foundation Scholars, receiving full
financial aid through the MasterCard Founda
tion.
Though the Foundation was established
through funding from MasterCard Worldwide, it
remains an independent organization that, ac
cording to Director of Financial Aid Karen Coop
er, will disburse $5OO million in an education ini
tiative for sub-Saharan M'ica.
As one of nine schools chosen to participate in
the initiative, Stanford will receive a total of $6.5
million in funding enough to support scholar
ships for five students each year for the next
eight years.
"They're thinking about the big picture,"
Cooper said. "Then aim is to really make a differ
ence on the continent, to create real leaders and
real change."
As part of that effort to make a broader dif
ference, scholarship recipients commit to spend
ing the summer between their junior and senior
years working at an internship somewhere in
Mica, supported by Foundation funding.
"One of their goals is that these students who
are receiving this funding in the United States
will eventually go back to Mica and make a real
difference," Cooper said.
The Foundation is also working with the
African Leadership Academy in South Africa to
help develop networks for post-graduation ca
reer opportunities.
