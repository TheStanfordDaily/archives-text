## MasterCard to fund 5 student scholarships Credit card, giant will disburse $500 million through education initiative 
### CARA REICHARD DESK EDITOR 
When the Class of 2017 arrives on campus
this fall, there will be a unique group of students
among them. Five students from sub-Saharan
Mica will join Stanford as the inaugural class of
MasterCard Foundation Scholars, receiving full
financial aid through the MasterCard Founda
tion.
Though the Foundation was established
through funding from MasterCard Worldwide, it
remains an independent organization that, ac
cording to Director of Financial Aid Karen Coop
er, will disburse $5OO million in an education ini
tiative for sub-Saharan M'ica.
As one of nine schools chosen to participate in
the initiative, Stanford will receive a total of $6.5
million in funding enough to support scholar
ships for five students each year for the next
eight years.
"They're thinking about the big picture,"
Cooper said. "Then aim is to really make a differ
ence on the continent, to create real leaders and
real change."
As part of that effort to make a broader dif
ference, scholarship recipients commit to spend
ing the summer between their junior and senior
years working at an internship somewhere in
Mica, supported by Foundation funding.
"One of their goals is that these students who
are receiving this funding in the United States
will eventually go back to Mica and make a real
difference," Cooper said.
The Foundation is also working with the
African Leadership Academy in South Africa to
help develop networks for post-graduation ca
reer opportunities.
Bridging a gap
According to Cooper, the
Foundation first approached
President John Hennessy in
February 2012. Cooper subse
quently worked with Dean of
Undergraduate Admission
and Financial Aid Richard
Shaw to put together a pro
posal, which was approved
last June.
"They reached out to us
because they saw a natural fit
between a lot of then- aims
and what Stanford tries to
do," Cooper said. "And that's
what our proposal was really
about fleshing out why
Stanford is such a great place
for people to come here and
learn how to be leaders, and
the special opportunities they
have here."
Cooper noted the value of
fered by the program consid
ering the lack of need-blind
admission for international
students.
"The admissions commit
tee gets some instruction
from us as to how many stu
dents from what parts of the
world we have funding avail
able for," she said. "Over the
last five to ten years, typically
we've had three to five stu
dents in every freshman class
who are from sub-Saharan
Africa and are receiving finan
cial aid."
One aspect of the agree
ment with the MasterCard
Foundation is that the funding
be in addition to whatever
Stanford was previously giv
ing to students from the re
gion.
"So now we really needed
eight to 10 students from sub-
Saharan Africa, so it was a
pretty big increase," Cooper
said.
According to John Pearson,
director of the Bechtel Inter
national Center, Stanford cur
rently has 82 students from
sub-Saharan Africa. The num
ber of undergraduates from
that total is in the "mid-thir
ties," Pearson said.
Pari of the grant from the
MasterCard Foundation was
designated to support Stan
ford's recruitment efforts in

the sub-Saharan region. Last
fall, an admissions officer was
able to use these funds to
travel to Africa and connect
with students.
"She was able to make
contacts with high schools and
meet actual prospective stu
dents in person and answer
their questions," Cooper said.
Stanford will now be able
to fund a trip from the Office
of Undergraduate Admission
to Africa every year, as op
posed to every five years or so
as had been done in the past.
Cooper said that future trips
will ideally be able to target
high schools often overlooked
by admissions visits, including
schools with high numbers of
low-income students.
"We're always looking for
ways to reach out to the right
people," she said. "One of the
goals with this program is to
be able to reach out to stu
dents who might not have
other opportunities without
the scholarship."
Pearson acknowledged
the difficulty of expanding
Stanford's outreach in sub-
Saharan Africa.
"The issue is, how do you
communicate with these stu
dents," he said. "How do they
know about these opportuni
ties? How do they take the
SATs? I think it's a slow
process of building these net
works."
Both Cooper and Pear-son
agreed that even after the
students arrive at Stanford,
they are likely to face a
unique set of challenges as
they adjust to life on the
Farm.
"These students are really
coming from a different world
in a lot of ways," Cooper said.
"There's the typical [process
of] international students get
ting acclimated to US culture,
but these students are also
coming from very low-income
backgrounds."
She noted that some of
these students have grown up
"in rural villages in Africa
that don't have electricity.
They literally grew up in mud
huts that families had built,
doing subsistence farming to
support themselves. So it is a
huge transition to come to
Stanford at that point."
"It's a long way to come,"
Pearson agreed. "Stanford is

a remarkably welcoming but
affluent place. So it's that
sense of not just academic
changes but broad culture
shock about coming to an en
vironment like this."
Cooper and Pearson em
phasized the variety of proj
ects being put into motion to
ensure as smooth a transition
as possible, both for these
students as well as for other
low-income and international
students.
"We're working with vari
ous groups in Student Affairs
and in [Student] Housing and
Dining to make sure support
systems are in place not just
for the five MasterCard stu
dents but really for all of our
international students who
come here receiving aid,"
Cooper said.
According to Pearson,
their efforts will be helped by
the designation of some Foun
dation funding to help pro
vide a support system for stu
dents once they arrive in the
United States.
Pearson attended a con
ference at Arizona State Uni
versity last month with repre
sentatives from other univer
sities participating in the pro
gram. Those schools include
Arizona State, Michigan
State, Duke and UC-Berke
ley.
"[The conference] was re
ally getting to the practicali
ties of learning from each oth
er, sharing best practices,"
Pearson said. "It was actually
quite interesting, because
what you realize is that every
school is veiy different about
how it structures itself, how
students live, how they inter
act, how they form communi
ties."
According to Pearson, the
various institutions will meet
again in June to discuss data
analysis.
"MasterCard really wants
to show, at the end, that
they've had some impact," he
said. "So they're very much
into data collection and analy
sis."
Though the scholarship's
inaugural recipients have
been chosen, Cooper declined
to release their names by time
of publication.
