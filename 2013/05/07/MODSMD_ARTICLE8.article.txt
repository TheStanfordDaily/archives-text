## Is football the future for world's best? 
### Tom Taylor 
Is football the future of sports? In
the wake of this year's NFL
Draft, the San R'ancisco 49ers
took a gamble on an athlete with
absolutely zero football experi
ence. Lawrence Okoye, an Olympic dis
cus thrower, was signed as a free agent
and reportedly will play defense on a
three-year deal.
Every April hundreds of college
players who have actually handled a
football are not even picked up as free
agents, but 49ers head coach Jim Har
baugh chose Okoye over them, obvious
ly not for his on-field displays but in
stead for his vital statistics, for his head
line-making performance in the NFL
Super Regional Combine. Like the
Scouting Combine but open to those
not invited to that showcase, the test
breaks down what it means to be a foot
ball player into a series of skills and
abilities, attempting to measure a
prospect with cold, hard statistics
seemingly detached from the actual
game of football.
"He's just an Adonis. Just a great
physical specimen of a man. Our* cre
ator created a beautiful man," Har
baugh said, explaining the decision to
sign Okoye.

Iterhaps this is a glimpse of the fu
ture. Football has been described as
chess on aplaying field, and whoever said
that might just be right. The real players
are no longer- on the field but on the side
lines, controlling a set of pieces with then
own highly specific, but limited, abilities.
Harbaugh doesn't need his pawns to
know anything about the game
they're playing; he just needs them to
hold the line and move up the board
when he tells them to.
It's maybe not quite how Oakland
Athletics general manager Billy
Beane would design a team. Statistics
are just as crucial across the Bay but
in a different way. Beane cares more
about in-game numbers than physical
attributes; there is no way he'd pick up
a player who never even stood on a
baseball diamond. He might, though,
celebrate the attempt to think outside
the box.
This is not the first time that the
NFL has looked beyond football to
find tomorrow's stars. Teams once
tried —unsuccessfully—to lure leg
endary fly-half Jonny Wilkinson
across the Pond, offering millions of
dollar's to the player who kicked Eng
land to glory in the 2003 Rugby World
Cup. New York Jets tight end Hayden
Smith, meanwhile, made the switch
from rugby last year'. Smith, though, is
one of those frustratingly talented ath
letes he played basketball through
college and if he ever gets tired of foot
ball, who knows which sport he'll
choose to succeed at next.
But there are also many more out
there who clearly could earn their
place on a football field. Rugby is per
haps the easiest place to look because
football evolved directly from that
sport and there are still some obvious
similarities between the two, but
breaking down a player into his key
abilities leaves the door open to many
other athletes. Hack sprinters would
have the explosiveness weightlifters
the strength and perhaps wrestlers
would be able to take down players far
bigger than they are. Even some soc
cer players might be able to kick
themselves onto a team.
Football is unlikely to be able to gut
the brightest talent from those sports
no soccer star- is going to take the
risk of switching sports to make less
money and earn far less respect as an
NFL placekicker—but there is little
reason that the smaller sports should
feel secure.
In just a single year a player could
earn far* more gold on the gridiron
than he will ever win in Olympic
medals. Timing down even the mini
mum starting salary of an NFL rook
ie would be a hard tiring for most; give
me $405,000 and I'd willingly get
crushed week after week on the line of
scrimmage.
Whether this tactic can work,
though, I'm not yet convinced. Im
pressive as the Athletics have been
during his tenure, Beane still doesn't

There's little

have that World Series to his name.
Maybe attention to statistics can only
take you so far.
Or perhaps it is just that I don't
want this approach to succeed.
Though the scientist in me is fascinat
ed by Beane's and Harbaugh's exper
imentation, there is something dis
tinctly unappetizing about it all.
Surely football and baseball are
more than just a process of assem
bling neatly defined pieces.

sprinters, three rugby players and an
Olympic shot-putter. Unfortunately,
it went horribly wrong. To remind
