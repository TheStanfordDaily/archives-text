## 'ICEMAN' YUN IN FINAL STRETCH 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
The mind is a beautiful thing.
Physiologically, the brain is a
coach, doing everything
from keeping our hearts
beating to directing complex
movements. Psychologically, the brain is
a composer, creating thoughts and stor
ing experiences. For any athlete, the
mind is at the core of performance
playing a lead role in everything from
muscle memory to self-confidence.
In the game of golf, the mental side
of the game is said to far outweigh the
physical. Golfers spend hours on the
course during competition, but only a
minute fraction actually swinging the
club. The rest of the time is spent pon
dering the next shot, the lie, the condi
tions; the list could go on forever. This
process of mental preparation is posi
tive in that it shows the player is en
gaged, but overthinking is often detri
mental.
Just as the mind is beautiful and can
be one's greatest ally, it can turn into
one's biggest enemy. For Stanford jun
ior golfer and 2012 Pac-12 Champion
Andrew Yun, the mental approach to his
game is paramount, although he dis
agrees with the Golden Bear Jack Nick
laus, who once said golf was "90% men
tal and 10% physical," on the percent
age.
"My mental approach is extremely
important," the soft-spoken Yun said.
"There's a cliche in golf that says the
game is 90 percent mental, and even
though I don't agree that it's 90, it's at
least half. Once you get to a certain lev
el, you're capable of hitting all the shots
that others are capable of hitting. At

Senior Andrew Yun (above) has earned the nickname 'lceman' from his teammates for his ability to
stay calm under pressure. Yun's mental game has taken big strides since NCAAs his freshman year.
that point, it's just a matter of con
sistently allowing yourself to hit
those kind of shots."
"It's something we continually
learn here in collegiate golf, but es
pecially at Stanford because you
have such high expectations of
yourself and a lot of times that can
be detrimental to your golf game.
You expect so much out of yourself,
and when you don't achieve that,
you get frustrated and your atti
tude is poor. Mentally, you're not
there and you're not allowing your
self to play your best golf."
But for the man the team now
calls 'lceman' because of his cool,
collected on-course demeanor, the
process of handling expectations
has not come easy and is still a
work in progress. Yun does be
lieve, however, that he's gradually
improving his mental game, and he
recalls an experience at the NCAA
Regional his freshman year that
changed everything.
"My freshman year, I came in
playing pretty well and had high
expectations," Yun said. "When I
starting playing tournaments, I
started placing pressure on myself,
and every time I hit a bad shot I
would get disappointed because I
knew that not only was I letting
myself down, I was letting my
team down as well. "Con
sequently, I would never finish that
well. Then I remember the seniors
on the team telling me: 'Hey, just
relax and don't worry about us.
Just go out there and worry about
your own game. Just have fun. And
when you do that, you're going to
help out the team.' I remember
them telling me that the morning
before the final round, and I
played really well that day. I went
on to play really well at NCAAs
and since then, I've been playing a
lot better."

The strategy has certainly
worked for Yun, who has since be

come one of the greatest Stanford
golfers of all time. The Tacoma,
Wash., native has amassed 15 top
-10 tournament finishes, two wins,
two AU-American honors and two
Pac-12 first-team honors.
In 2012 Yun became the ninth
Cardinal golfer to win the Pac-12
Championships. This season, Yun
was the Pac-12 Men's Golf Scholar-
Athlete of the Year and named a fi
nalist for the prestigious Byron
Nelson Award.

Despite all his accomplishments,
Yun wants to be remembered for his
character and not the success he ac
crued.
"The relationships that you make
are going to last forever," Yun said
when asked what he'll take away
from his Stanford experience. "The
results, accolades and all that stuff
it doesn't necessarily stay with
you. A lot of the times that's not
what people remember.
"People remember more about
the person and who they were and
what they stood for. Hopefully by
the end of my career here at Stan
ford I'm not just recognized for
what I've done on the golf course
but for the person who I was. That's
something I would rather be re
membered for, not just all the
awards I've won or the stuff I've ac
complished, because that's what re
ally makes a difference in people's
lives."
Some of the tightest relation
ships Yun has formed are with his
teammates, especially sophomore
Patrick Rodgers and junior
Cameron Wilson. All three are
ranked in the top 50 in Golfweek's
Men's Collegiate individual rank

ings and will lead Stanford into an
NCAA Regional Tournament start
ing May 16.
Yun enjoys the camaraderie the
trio share on and off the course.
Yun, Rodgers and Wilson practice
together, play together and even go
out to eat together. Those experi
ences have helped them grow very
close and allowed Yun to see first
hand all of the work that his team
mates put in.
"I haven't seen many people
work as hard as Rodgers does," Yun
said, "and that's something I really
admire. Cam's not any less of a hard
worker, but I feel like the biggest
difference of why he's done so well
this year compared to year's past is
his attitude. He has more confi
dence in his process and prepara
tion â€”he knows exactly what
works for him. He has that swagger,
and that's really cool to see. It's
something I know I lack right now
and something I'd like to have. So
just hanging out with these two
guys and being around them, it's
good because it pushes me to im
prove on the stuff that I'm weak at
or I lack."
It's that kind of attitude inten
sity and focus in practice that
has vaulted Yun into stardom and
caught the eye of Stanford men's
golf head coach Conrad Ray. Ray
has seen firsthand how Yun has
matured over the years, letting go
of his worries about the day-to-day
results and seeing the bigger, long
term picture.
"He's been a senior leader for us
this year and it's been great to
spend four years with him, seeing
him mature in golf and his person
ality during his time at Stanford,"
Ray said. "He's been a great am
bassador for our program. Andrew
is very strong mentally and very
even-keeled. He does a great job
managing his emotions while on
the course... There would be noth
ing better than for him to go out
with a bang and lead the team to a
championship this spring."
