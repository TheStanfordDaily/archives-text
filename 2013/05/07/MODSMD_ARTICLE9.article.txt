## 'ICEMAN' YUN IN FINAL STRETCH

The mind is a beautiful thing.
Physiologically, the brain is a
coach, doing everything
from keeping our hearts
beating to directing complex
movements. Psychologically, the brain is
a composer, creating thoughts and stor
ing experiences. For any athlete, the
mind is at the core of performance
playing a lead role in everything from
muscle memory to self-confidence.
In the game of golf, the mental side
of the game is said to far outweigh the
physical. Golfers spend hours on the
course during competition, but only a
minute fraction actually swinging the
club. The rest of the time is spent pon
dering the next shot, the lie, the condi
tions; the list could go on forever. This
process of mental preparation is posi
tive in that it shows the player is en
gaged, but overthinking is often detri
mental.
Just as the mind is beautiful and can
be one's greatest ally, it can turn into
one's biggest enemy. For Stanford jun
ior golfer and 2012 Pac-12 Champion
Andrew Yun, the mental approach to his
game is paramount, although he dis
agrees with the Golden Bear Jack Nick
laus, who once said golf was "90% men
tal and 10% physical," on the percent
age.
"My mental approach is extremely
important," the soft-spoken Yun said.
"There's a cliche in golf that says the
game is 90 percent mental, and even
though I don't agree that it's 90, it's at
least half. Once you get to a certain lev
el, you're capable of hitting all the shots
that others are capable of hitting. At

Senior Andrew Yun (above) has earned the nickname 'lceman' from his teammates for his ability to
stay calm under pressure. Yun's mental game has taken big strides since NCAAs his freshman year.
