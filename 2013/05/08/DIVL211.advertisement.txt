CEMEX Auditorium
The Future of Food is about the intersection
of food, politics, the environment, and
personal health. New York Times
columnist Mark Bittman will discuss
"non-foods, like soda, and their
impact, as well as how policy
pushes foods, like wheat,
meat, and dairy, that may
be in no one's best interest"
as well as "the sticks and
carrots that we need to
move out of this mess."
