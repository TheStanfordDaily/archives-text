# SOFTBALL'S SENIOR STARS
## PROFILING STANFORD'S SENIOR SOFTBALL CLASS 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
As the Softball regular season draws
to a close, the members of the
Class of 2013 enter the final few
weeks of their senior seasons. To
gether, Teagan Gerhart, Tegan
Schmidt, Jenna Rich and Sarah Hassman have
epitomized the quality of resiliency, overcoming
tremendous challenges throughout their time
on the Farm to achieve high levels of success
both on and off the field.
In the following two-part feature story, The
Daily will profile these four seniors' journeys as
student-athletes while highlighting their impact
on the Cardinal program. In addition, the lead
ership that they have provided has helped galva
nize their teammates while strengthening the
Card's ability to make a deep run in the NCAA
tournament this season.
Today's piece focuses on Teagan Gerhart and
Tegan Schmidt, with tomorrow's installment
featuring Jenna Rich and Sarah Hassman.
Teagan Gerhart: Ace of the Rotation
As the face of the Cardinal pitching staff for
most of her Stanford career, Gerhart has aptly
handled the expectations that have been placed
on her shoulders with focus and dedication.
Since making her first appearance in the pitch
ing circle as a freshman in 2010, Gerhart has
been called upon to carry a significant portion of
the pitching workload for the Cardinal; Gerhart
is currently third on Stanford's all-time innings
pitched list at 891.2 innings. In turn, Gerhart
has certainly delivered on head coach John
Rittman and his coaching staff's faith in her,
posting 99 career victories, the third-most in
program history.
However, for all the success that Gerhart has
had during her time on the Farm, her accom
plishments are all the more remarkable given
the injuries that she has dealt with. During her
freshman year, Gerhart broke her pitching arm,
an injury that required surgery and caused her
to miss a significant portion of Pac-12 confer
ence play. Furthermore, Gerhart re-aggravated
that injury last season, leaving her in a consider
able amount of pain.
Nevertheless, in spite of these setbacks, Ger
hart has continued to lead the Cardinal in the
circle; in her career, Gerhart has helped deliver

nearly 64 percent of the Card's victories since
2010 (99 career wins out of 155 wins for the pro
gram), while facing what Softball alum Jenna
Becerra 'l2 M.A. 'l3 calls "the tremendous pres
sure of being the No. 1 pitcher." In particular,
Becerra commended Gerhart for "trying to do
what she can and not think too much about what
others expect of her."
While her performance on the softball field
has certainly been noteworthy, Gerhart high
lights the value of receiving a Stanford educa
tion as extremely important to her as well. A
Human Biology major with a particular interest
in Exercise Physiology, Gerhart noted that,
"Once you are done with softball, all you have is
your academics. We [the softball team] take a lot
of pride in our academics and our degree... a lot
of us are engineers, biology, and CS majors, and
once we step off this field, it is strictly academ

ics..."
No matter what happens over the rest of the
season on the softball field, Gerhart will receive
her diploma in June and be primed to contribute
in the medical field in her post-Stanford career.
Tegan Schmidt: Selfless Teammate
When asked to describe Schmidt, her fellow
seniors and former teammates unanimously
called her the ideal teammate. Becerra said
about Schmidt, "I am always impressed by her
in terms of her ability to come back from tearing
her ACL in back-to-back years. Not only that,
she is also a double major in biology and philos
ophy ... Even when she was hurt, she would be

the one raking the field when no
one else would be. She would be
the one helping the coaches out
[and] getting balls for the girls.
Any way that she could contribute,
she would do it."
As Becerra mentioned in her
praise of Schmidt, the Rocklin,
Calif., product has overcome two
serious knee injuries that occurred
during her first two seasons on the
Farm. Schmidt's first ACL tear
forced her to redshirt and miss her
entire freshman season. After re
covering from that injury, Schmidt

subsequently tore her other ACL
prior to the start of the 2011 sea
son.
Following these two devastat
ing injuries, Schmidt worked tire
lessly to get back on the field.
With incredible resiliency, she
participated in her first set of col
lege softball games last season.
In the process, Schmidt produced
for the Cardinal, starting in 26
games at second base while driv
ing in fifteen runs in only 78 plate
appearances. This season,
Schmidt has started in another 27
games for the Card, hitting .268
with 9 RBI.
Schmidt gave some very mean
ingful advice to the incoming Class
of 2017 when asked what would be
her message to the next group of

Stanford Softball players and stu
dents. "Sometimes it is better to go
out for ice cream with your friends,
hang out, and do something fun be
cause honestly, after college, you
are not going to remember the B +
instead of a B," the 2012 Pac-12
All-Academic Honorable Mention
selection said.
"You are going to remember
the people you meet and the rela
tionships that you form. Those
[things] will last after college. I re
ally think it is important to study,
obviously, to do well here. Howev
er, I think it is even more impor
tant to form good relationships
and have fun," she added.

gram), while facing what Softball alum Jenna
Becerra 'l2 M.A. 'l3 calls "the tremendous pres
sure of being the No. 1 pitcher." In particular,
Becerra commended Gerhart for "trying to do
what she can and not think too much about what
others expect of her."
While her performance on the softball field
has certainly been noteworthy, Gerhart high
lights the value of receiving a Stanford educa
tion as extremely important to her as well. A
Human Biology major with a particular interest
in Exercise Physiology, Gerhart noted that,
"Once you are done with softball, all you have is
your academics. We [the softball team] take a lot
of pride in our academics and our degree... a lot
of us are engineers, biology, and CS majors, and
once we step off this field, it is strictly academ

ics..."
No matter what happens over the rest of the
season on the softball field, Gerhart will receive
her diploma in June and be primed to contribute
in the medical field in her post-Stanford career.
Tegan Schmidt: Selfless Teammate
When asked to describe Schmidt, her fellow
seniors and former teammates unanimously
called her the ideal teammate. Becerra said
about Schmidt, "I am always impressed by her
in terms of her ability to come back from tearing
her ACL in back-to-back years. Not only that,
she is also a double major in biology and philos
ophy ... Even when she was hurt, she would be

the one raking the field when no
one else would be. She would be
the one helping the coaches out
[and] getting balls for the girls.
Any way that she could contribute,
she would do it."
As Becerra mentioned in her
praise of Schmidt, the Rocklin,
Calif., product has overcome two
serious knee injuries that occurred
during her first two seasons on the
Farm. Schmidt's first ACL tear
forced her to redshirt and miss her
entire freshman season. After re
covering from that injury, Schmidt

subsequently tore her other ACL
prior to the start of the 2011 sea
son.
Following these two devastat
ing injuries, Schmidt worked tire
lessly to get back on the field.
With incredible resiliency, she
participated in her first set of col
lege softball games last season.
In the process, Schmidt produced
for the Cardinal, starting in 26
games at second base while driv
ing in fifteen runs in only 78 plate
appearances. This season,
Schmidt has started in another 27
games for the Card, hitting .268
with 9 RBI.
Schmidt gave some very mean
ingful advice to the incoming Class
of 2017 when asked what would be
her message to the next group of

Stanford Softball players and stu
dents. "Sometimes it is better to go
out for ice cream with your friends,
hang out, and do something fun be
cause honestly, after college, you
are not going to remember the B +
instead of a B," the 2012 Pac-12
All-Academic Honorable Mention
selection said.
"You are going to remember
the people you meet and the rela
tionships that you form. Those
[things] will last after college. I re
ally think it is important to study,
obviously, to do well here. Howev
er, I think it is even more impor
tant to form good relationships
and have fun," she added.

As the Softball regular season draws
to a close, the members of the
Class of 2013 enter the final few
weeks of their senior seasons. To
gether, Teagan Gerhart, Tegan
Schmidt, Jenna Rich and Sarah Hassman have
epitomized the quality of resiliency, overcoming
tremendous challenges throughout their time
on the Farm to achieve high levels of success
both on and off the field.
In the following two-part feature story, The
Daily will profile these four seniors' journeys as
student-athletes while highlighting their impact
on the Cardinal program. In addition, the lead
ership that they have provided has helped galva
nize their teammates while strengthening the
Card's ability to make a deep run in the NCAA
tournament this season.
Today's piece focuses on Teagan Gerhart and
Tegan Schmidt, with tomorrow's installment
featuring Jenna Rich and Sarah Hassman.
Teagan Gerhart: Ace of the Rotation
As the face of the Cardinal pitching staff for
most of her Stanford career, Gerhart has aptly
handled the expectations that have been placed
on her shoulders with focus and dedication.
Since making her first appearance in the pitch
ing circle as a freshman in 2010, Gerhart has
been called upon to carry a significant portion of
the pitching workload for the Cardinal; Gerhart
is currently third on Stanford's all-time innings
pitched list at 891.2 innings. In turn, Gerhart
has certainly delivered on head coach John
Rittman and his coaching staff's faith in her,
posting 99 career victories, the third-most in
program history.
However, for all the success that Gerhart has
had during her time on the Farm, her accom
plishments are all the more remarkable given
the injuries that she has dealt with. During her
freshman year, Gerhart broke her pitching arm,
an injury that required surgery and caused her
to miss a significant portion of Pac-12 confer
ence play. Furthermore, Gerhart re-aggravated
that injury last season, leaving her in a consider
able amount of pain.
Nevertheless, in spite of these setbacks, Ger
hart has continued to lead the Cardinal in the
circle; in her career, Gerhart has helped deliver

nearly 64 percent of the Card's victories since
2010 (99 career wins out of 155 wins for the pro
gram), while facing what Softball alum Jenna
Becerra 'l2 M.A. 'l3 calls "the tremendous pres
sure of being the No. 1 pitcher." In particular,
Becerra commended Gerhart for "trying to do
