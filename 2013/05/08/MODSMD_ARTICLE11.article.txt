# Cardinal's streak broken by Dons
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal baseball team,
in the middle of an incredibly
challenging stretch of its sched
ule, needed to keep the momen
tum from its series victory at Ari
zona State rolling as it welcomed
the San Francisco Dons to
Sunken Diamond. Despite its ef
forts, Stanford (26-17,11-10 Pac
-12) was stopped in its tracks, as it
was unable to overcome USF
(30-19,14-7 WCC) in losing 4-3.

Last night's loss was Stan
ford's first non-conference loss in
over a month, as the Cardinal
had claimed victory in every mid
week matchup dating back to
March 26 against UC-Davis,
which it also lost by a one-run
margin. That winning streak

couldn't have ended at a worse
time.
With the formidable Oregon
State Beavers looming on the
horizon, the Cardinal hitters
were unable to string hits togeth
er against a Dons pitching staff
that was by leaps and bounds the
most solid non-conference staff
they had faced in recent memory.
Seven USF pitchers com
bined to limit the Cardinal to on
ly three runs after the Stanford
offense had averaged seven per
game in its last series against
Arizona State.
Stanford claimed an early
lead in the second inning by
countering the Dons' one run in
the top of the frame with two
scores of its own. With runners
on first and third and one out,
sophomore third baseman Alex
Blandino lofted a fly ball to cen
ter that brought home junior
center fielder Austin Wilson
from third to quickly knot the

game at one apiece.
The tie proved to be short-lived,
however, as sophomore Wayne Tay
lor, back at catcher for a game after
playing in the outfield for most of
the last month, lined an opposite
field double down the left field line
that scored junior second baseman
Danny Diekroeger all the way from
first, giving the Cardinal a 2-1 lead.
However, freshman righty Bob
by Zarubin had a rough outing, as
the Dons hitters tagged the Stan

ford starter for nine hits and four
earned runs in his four-plus innings
of work. The Dons pushed across
three runs in the top of the fourth
inning on four singles to push ahead
of the Cardinal for good.
The USF bullpen prevented
Stanford from getting anything go
ing offensively after another
Blandino sacrifice fly in the bottom
of the fourth. The Cardinal hitters
only mustered three more hits
from the fifth inning onward, fail
ing to capitalize on the few chances
that they produced.
Stanford made one last push in
the ninth as Wilson made it to sec
ond base, representing the tying
run as Blandino stepped into the

batter's box trying to drive in his
third run of the day. Although the
third baseman ran the count full,
he waved and missed at the 3-2 of
fering and the Cardinal were un
able to push the equalizer across
the plate.
Going into a do-or-die series
against Oregon State this weekend,
the Cardinal needed this victory to
face the Beavers with momentum
on its side. Though the Cardinal
failed that task, it must prepare it
self for potentially the toughest
challenge of the season, with mo
mentum or without momentum.
