### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal baseball team,
in the middle of an incredibly
challenging stretch of its sched
ule, needed to keep the momen
tum from its series victory at Ari
zona State rolling as it welcomed
the San Francisco Dons to
Sunken Diamond. Despite its ef
forts, Stanford (26-17,11-10 Pac
-12) was stopped in its tracks, as it
was unable to overcome USF
(30-19,14-7 WCC) in losing 4-3.

Last night's loss was Stan
ford's first non-conference loss in
over a month, as the Cardinal
had claimed victory in every mid
week matchup dating back to
March 26 against UC-Davis,
which it also lost by a one-run
margin. That winning streak

couldn't have ended at a worse

horizon, the Cardinal hitters
were unable to string hits togeth

that was by leaps and bounds the
most solid non-conference staff
they had faced in recent memory.
Seven USF pitchers com
bined to limit the Cardinal to on
ly three runs after the Stanford
offense had averaged seven per
game in its last series against
Arizona State.
Stanford claimed an early
lead in the second inning by
countering the Dons' one run in
the top of the frame with two
scores of its own. With runners
on first and third and one out,
sophomore third baseman Alex
Blandino lofted a fly ball to cen
ter that brought home junior
center fielder Austin Wilson
from third to quickly knot the
