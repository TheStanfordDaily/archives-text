## OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD To Do: Fall in Love 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
A few months ago I wrote a
column investigating a few
reasons why some students
at Stanford choose not to date. To
day I want to take a different angle:
When students do choose to date,
how do they make it work? How do
people find the emotional space for
somebody else, the energy re
serves necessary to invest in ro
mance, and most importantly, how
do people find the time?
Two of my dearest friends have
been making it work for most of
this year. It's an uphill battle. Re
cently, they weren't seeing enough
of each other, so they condensed
their Google calendars into one mo
saic of color-coded obligations. Just
looking at the monster calendar
stressed me out, and suddenly I un
derstood why both of them needed
to work so hard just to make time
for each other.

The problem is not just the
sheer number of commitments that
two people in a relationship face;
rather, it's an unfortunate byprod
uct of two overscheduled lives awk
wardly trying to mesh. When
you're that busy, you find yourself
needing to schedule the person you
love into your Google calendar. Ro
mantic, I know. The person who is
supposed to make all of your wor
ries disappear turns into another
item to check off your to-do list, an
other color-coded rectangle on a
calendar begging for white space.
For the poor guy who feels like
he's being penciled into his girl
friend's calendar, it's easy to feel
like a chore. When he tries to bring
it up with her, she may get hostile
and defensive, feeling that he does
n't appreciate the logistical gym
nastics she went through to see him
for thirty minutes at lunch. Maybe
if he brought it up when she wasn't
so stressed, she wouldn't flare up so
much. But as long as her schedule
is overstuffed, his requests that she
treat him less like a chore only
come across as one more demand
on the laundry list. Hence the cycle:
too much to do, remember to see
boyfriend, boyfriend feels over
looked, one more thing to do.
As is the case with most prob
lems I bring up in this column, I
don't have a solution. I may have a

suggestion, though. Finding time
for the person you love may not be
enough. Instead, I suggest you try
to make time. Not out of thin air,
but out of those color-coded com
mitments on your calendar. Finding
time suggests prioritizing your oth
er commitments and fitting in a re
lationship in the precious white
space left over. Making time sug
gests making sacrifices because
you prioritize your relationship
above your problem set.
Maybe your relationship isn't
your top priority. This is absolutely
your prerogative as a young person
with a million opportunities before
you. Even so, the same principle
can be applied to anything: your
health, your grades, your family.
What matters is that you stick your
head in the sand and figure out
what your priorities are. Once you
find out what the most important
things are, don't allow yourself to
fit them into gaps in your schedule.
After all, the time that you allocate
to an activity should in theory
match its rank on your list of prior
ities. With relationships, or with
anything else while you're this
busy, the bottom line is this: If it
matters, make the time for it.
