# Finding the Eye of the Storm
## 
### Taylor Brady 
I've spent a lot of column space
this year bemoaning a culture of
restlessness at this university,
but I haven't presented many spe
cific places where people who agree
with my message can find the tran
quility they're looking for. With that
in mind, I have decided to open up
the chest of secrets and share my
sacred spots on and around campus
with the next generation. What I'm
counting on here is that the people
who actually want profound soli
tude, and the times when they seek
it, are few and far enough between
to ensure that, if you follow my
words into the wild, you'll still find a
place quiet enough to actually hear
yourself think.
1. Where: Arizona Cactus Gar
den
How (to get there): Follow Palm
Drive toward Palo Alto, left oblique
to the walkway to the mausoleum,
follow it around to the backside
Best time to go (When): Late af
ternoon, spring
Why: I used to love how it re
minded me of home, but then I real

ized that it was man-made nature
and started abhorring it. Typical.
But I have seen somebody else
there literally once in four years, so
it's a great place to get away.
2. Where: Second/Third Floors
of Pigott Hall
How: Internet, seriously.
When: In the morning with a cup
of coffee
Why: Soft leather armchairs,
warm-colored carpet and wood, se
cret nooks where you're assured
some peace. Looks like the Brad
bury Building in LA.
3. Where: Rope swing on old oak
bough, up Frenchman's Road.
How: Mayfield past Slav, take a
right on Frenchman's Road, follow
it to a confluence of two streets and
you'll see the rope hanging from the
tree
When: I like walking these
streets late at night with a good
friend. There are few lights, so you
can see the stars, but again, go with
somebody close to you.
Why: Many of my most intimate
conversations have happened along
these roads. They feel profoundly
private.
4. Where: "Bench of the Stars"
How: Take Peter Coutts Road
between Stanford Avenue and Page
Mill, park the car/bike by the side of
the road, and climb what is marked
on maps as "Kite Hill"
When: Cold winter night
Why: Awesome view of the south
bay and surrounding exurbs. The
clearest views with the least light
pollution that I have seen were win
ter evenings.
5. Where: Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium
How: Take the path between
Maples and Arrillaga Family Sports
Center toward Avery, turn right at
Nelson Road then left at Churchill
Mall
When: Another nighttime spot,
when all the athletes have gone
home and the bleachers are empty
Why: Perhaps nostalgia for
baseball (or softball) gets me in the
mood to be reflective, but the
stands are cozy when they're not
scorching in the sun and I had my
best conversation this year at this
spot.
6. Where: Alpine Inn
How: Take Alpine Road south
past the 280, for a ways, it'll be on
your left
When: Lunch or an early dinner
Why: The burgers are delicious,

really, they are, and their fried sides
and pickles are the best in the
area. Way cheaper and less bougie
than Dutch Goose or the Counter.
It's got a pleasantly kitschy feel,
kind of like Shenanigans as de
scribed in the movie "Super Troop
ers" (you know what I mean), and is
close to the cool hiking trails in Por
tola Valley.
7. Where: Big Basin
How: Take the 280 southeast to
California Highway 85, take that
south to the CA9, then that roughly
west to CA236. There will be signs
for Big Basin.
When: Early on a Saturday
morning
Why: The day hike to the water
fall in Big Basin is great. Just
enough distance, and a great rest
ing spot for a picnic lunch. Alterna
tively, you can take about the same
distance as a day hike for an
overnight to a wilderness beach,
which is gorgeous. Hike back the
next day. Watch out for parking,
there are special designations and if
you park in the wrong lot, you'll get
a ticket.
8. Where: Bamboo Grove
How: Between Mudd Chem and
Lorry Lokey Labs
When: Anytime of day, really
Why: Feels so far away, and you
can peer in on the exhausted re
searchers in Lokey late at night.
9. Where: Boulware Park
How: Take El Camino east to
Fernando Ave.
When: Sunny afternoon
Why: For some reason, this little
segment of Palo Alto has lower
rents and way better food than
downtown and the Menlo Park area.
There is some great Chinese food
around (Da Sichuan), and the area
actually has some community. Very
close to my apartment for the sum
mer.
Of course, there are so many
more than I am able cover here, so
don't imagine that I'm holding back.
Many of you already go to these
places, but I hope that some of them
are novel, and that you can find
peace in these quiet spaces when
you need it most. Next week, I'll be
covering housing on and off cam
pus, and providing some more sug
gestions for finding a balance be
tween the two.

You can find inner tranquility an
other way, too: by emailing Taylor
at tabrady@stanford.edu.

7. Where: Big Basin
How: Take the 280 southeast to
California Highway 85, take that
south to the CA9, then that roughly
west to CA236. There will be signs
for Big Basin.
When: Early on a Saturday
morning
Why: The day hike to the water
fall in Big Basin is great. Just
enough distance, and a great rest
ing spot for a picnic lunch. Alterna
tively, you can take about the same
distance as a day hike for an
overnight to a wilderness beach,
which is gorgeous. Hike back the
next day. Watch out for parking,
there are special designations and if
you park in the wrong lot, you'll get
a ticket.
8. Where: Bamboo Grove
How: Between Mudd Chem and
Lorry Lokey Labs
When: Anytime of day, really
Why: Feels so far away, and you
can peer in on the exhausted re
searchers in Lokey late at night.
9. Where: Boulware Park
How: Take El Camino east to
Fernando Ave.
When: Sunny afternoon
Why: For some reason, this little
segment of Palo Alto has lower
rents and way better food than
downtown and the Menlo Park area.
There is some great Chinese food
around (Da Sichuan), and the area
actually has some community. Very
close to my apartment for the sum
mer.
Of course, there are so many
more than I am able cover here, so
don't imagine that I'm holding back.
Many of you already go to these
places, but I hope that some of them
are novel, and that you can find
peace in these quiet spaces when
you need it most. Next week, I'll be
covering housing on and off cam
pus, and providing some more sug
gestions for finding a balance be
tween the two.

You can find inner tranquility an
other way, too: by emailing Taylor
at tabrady@stanford.edu.
I've spent a lot of column space
this year bemoaning a culture of
restlessness at this university,
but I haven't presented many spe
cific places where people who agree
with my message can find the tran
quility they're looking for. With that
in mind, I have decided to open up
the chest of secrets and share my
sacred spots on and around campus
with the next generation. What I'm
counting on here is that the people
who actually want profound soli
tude, and the times when they seek
it, are few and far enough between
to ensure that, if you follow my
words into the wild, you'll still find a
place quiet enough to actually hear
yourself think.
1. Where: Arizona Cactus Gar
den
How (to get there): Follow Palm
Drive toward Palo Alto, left oblique
to the walkway to the mausoleum,
follow it around to the backside
Best time to go (When): Late af
ternoon, spring
Why: I used to love how it re
minded me of home, but then I real

ized that it was man-made nature
and started abhorring it. Typical.
But I have seen somebody else
there literally once in four years, so
it's a great place to get away.
2. Where: Second/Third Floors
of Pigott Hall
How: Internet, seriously.
When: In the morning with a cup
of coffee
Why: Soft leather armchairs,
warm-colored carpet and wood, se
cret nooks where you're assured
some peace. Looks like the Brad
bury Building in LA.
3. Where: Rope swing on old oak
bough, up Frenchman's Road.
How: Mayfield past Slav, take a
right on Frenchman's Road, follow
it to a confluence of two streets and
you'll see the rope hanging from the
tree
When: I like walking these
streets late at night with a good
friend. There are few lights, so you
can see the stars, but again, go with
somebody close to you.
Why: Many of my most intimate
conversations have happened along
these roads. They feel profoundly
private.
4. Where: "Bench of the Stars"
How: Take Peter Coutts Road
between Stanford Avenue and Page
Mill, park the car/bike by the side of
the road, and climb what is marked
on maps as "Kite Hill"
When: Cold winter night
Why: Awesome view of the south
bay and surrounding exurbs. The
clearest views with the least light
pollution that I have seen were win
ter evenings.
5. Where: Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium
How: Take the path between
Maples and Arrillaga Family Sports
Center toward Avery, turn right at
Nelson Road then left at Churchill
Mall
When: Another nighttime spot,
when all the athletes have gone
home and the bleachers are empty
Why: Perhaps nostalgia for
baseball (or softball) gets me in the
mood to be reflective, but the
stands are cozy when they're not
scorching in the sun and I had my
best conversation this year at this
spot.
6. Where: Alpine Inn
How: Take Alpine Road south
past the 280, for a ways, it'll be on
your left
When: Lunch or an early dinner
Why: The burgers are delicious,

really, they are, and their fried sides
and pickles are the best in the
area. Way cheaper and less bougie
than Dutch Goose or the Counter.
It's got a pleasantly kitschy feel,
kind of like Shenanigans as de
scribed in the movie "Super Troop
ers" (you know what I mean), and is
close to the cool hiking trails in Por
tola Valley.
7. Where: Big Basin
How: Take the 280 southeast to
California Highway 85, take that
south to the CA9, then that roughly
west to CA236. There will be signs
