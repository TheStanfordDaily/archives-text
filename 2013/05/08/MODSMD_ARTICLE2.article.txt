## SARA MRSNY PHILOSOPHY DOCTORAL CANDIDATE 
### SOO Jl LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sara Mrsny is a fifth-year philoso
phy doctoral candidate and the au
thor of an attention-getting thesis on
the philosophical necessity of an of
fice environment accommodating of
working parents. The Daily sat down
with Mrsny to discuss her take on the
work-life balance, her views on Sh
eryl Sandberg's effort to bridge a
similar divide and the challenges
posed by other social institutions on
working caregivers.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did
you become interested in philoso
phy, and gender studies more
broadly?
Sara Mrsny (SM): I took my first
philosophy course by accident [at
Wellesley], I didn't even know what
philosophy was and I just needed an
extra class to fill in my course sched
ule. I have always been interested in
feminism and feminist activism as an
undergraduate, [but] I didn't really
study it academically until I was a
graduate student.
TSD: Can you explain your thesis
briefly? How does it stand out from

the other types of gender studies
research out there?
SM: The question that my disser
tation considers is how should care
work be organized in a just and fair
society. I look at several different an
swers to that question given by polit
ical philosophy traditions or various
traditions of political philosophy. I
am particularly interested in finding
a political justification and even
developing my own for policies
and ways of organizing work that al
low people to both have a job and
take care of a family so that work is
no longer specialized. Policies like
family leave and flextime that allow
people to do both things I'm de
veloping a political justification for
those kinds of policies.
TSD: Does your research reflect
your own personal take on this is
sue?
SM: I think that it's important
for political equality for people to
be able to do both. There's a certain
status and fulfillment for people that
comes with having a job and also sta
tus and fulfillment that come with
having family. It should be easier
than it is now for people to engage in
both spheres instead of specializing
of being a stay-at-home parent or a
breadwinner who's not as engaged
in family life.
TSD: What inspired you to pursue
such a specific and certainly
pertinent issue from a philo
sophical standpoint?
SM: A lot of women I've known
in my personal life have had this dif
ficulty. My mother, various other
relatives, Mends I know are start
ing to struggle with the choices of

whether or not to pursue their ca
reers or slow down and have a fam
ily. Men face this problem too, but
it's still mostly being emphasized
and talked about by women and cer
tainly in the past it was more of a
woman's problem.
TSD: What do you hope to accom
plish with your research?
SM: I hope to get people to un
derstand why it's important for
[workers] to be able to combine
work and family life why equality
demands it if you want to treat peo
ple as equals. It's important that we
have policies like this. I want to be
able to explain what's valuable
about these kinds of policies, and
political philosophy is exactly what
you need to explain what values are
at stake.
TSD: What has been the most
challenging aspect of your re
search? Have you come up with
any surprising conclusions?
SM: I think the challenging
thing for me is that a lot of people in
academia sort of assume that these
are good policies and support them
and so forth, [but] don't really see
the need to offer justifications. Es
pecially in gender studies, I think
there's often an assumption that we
should support all these kind of poli
cies.
Nationally we don't have the
support for them there are no
bills [being] considered right now in
Congress for furthering these poli
cies. I think that the surprising

thing is that a lot of people don't re
alize how much we need these justi
fications to get any action done.
TSD: Sheryl Sandberg recently
visited campus to give a talk on
how individuals in the workplace
can manage this work-life bal
ance. What is your response to
her argument about equality in
the office as being achieved
through a combination of both
personal and workforce initia
tives?
SM: So, Sheryl Sandberg seems
to be focusing on encouraging indi
vidual women to have a certain
proactive attitude to their own ca
reers and workplaces. I think we
can't lose sight of the fact that work
place policy matters a lot too.
The onus, the burden should not
only be on individual women t0...
"lean in" to the workplace. We
should also make sure that the
workplace is a friendly and support
ive place to lean into. And that's the
kind of thing that policy both
governmental and employer policies
can help do. So both sides are
needed. Yes, women have to lean in,
but they have to be able to lean into
a hospitable environment. And
that's the side of the equation that
I'm interested in.
TSD: As both a mother and a stu
dent, have you been able to
achieve this work-life balance?
SM: My twin daughters are sev
en weeks old so no, I haven't been
able to balance anything yet. I'm
still figuring this out for myself. I
don't have the answers, I don't
know. This is important to me per
sonally as well as academically.

I think that it's
important...for people to
be able to do both.
