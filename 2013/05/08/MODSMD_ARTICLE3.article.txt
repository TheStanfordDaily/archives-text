# Alumni pioneer accessible genetic test
## 
### MARGARET WENZLAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Accessible genetic screenings for
anyone considering having children
could soon be a reality, if Counsyl
a genetic testing company founded
by a team of Stanford alumni
achieves its aim.
The company, which provides
screenings to two and a half percent
of all prospective parents in the
United States, was co-founded by
Ramji Srinivasan 'O2 M.S. 'O4, Balaji
Srinivasan 'OO M.S. 'O4 M.S. 'O5
Ph.D. 'O6, Eric Evans Ph.D. 'OB and
Rishi Kacker 'O3.
After graduating from Stanford,
Ramji Srinivasan worked in Morgan
Stanley's research division before
returning to Silicon Valley and re
cruiting his three co-founders to
start Counsyl.
"I thought to myself, 'These guys
are changing the world, and I'm here
moving around pieces of paper. What
am I doing with my life?"' he said.
"My brother told me, 'You need to
come back to Stanford and Silicon
Valley, the genome is going to be the
next Internet.'"
Counsyl's screening kits test for
more than 400 mutations and 100 ge
netic diseases, including cystic fibro
sis, spinal muscular atrophy and var
ious forms of muscular dystrophy.
The process of genetic screening
is itself relatively simple. After pick
ing up a testing kit from a healthcare
provider and mailing a saliva sample
to Counsyl's lab, results are viewable
online within two or three weeks.
'Anyone, regardless of family his
tory, should be thinking of getting
carrier screening," Ramji Srinivasan
said. "Many children born with a ge
netic disease don't have a family his-

Tory in the first place because these
are genetic mutations are passed on
from generation to generation silent
ly."
Professor of Chemistry Vijay
Pande, who is one of Counsyl's scien
tific advisors, said that Counsyl's
tests have many practical applica
tions.
Diseases like cystic fibrosis,
spinal muscular atrophy and Tay-
Sachs have no cure, but a Counsyl
test can prompt preventative meas
ures. Parents who learn their child
has a high expectancy of being born
with a mutated gene can take in
formed action, such as deciding to
use a donor egg or sperm, to ensure
they will have a healthy baby.

"One of the big issues with ge
nomics is, what can this information
do for you?" Pande said. "It was very
exciting what [Counsyl] proposed
right away, and I think that all of that
has come into fruition."
According to Srinivasan, Coun
syl's use of customized software,
hardware and webware allows the
firm to offer tests as a much lower
price than competitors. While a full
panel of tests may cost between
$4,000 and $5,000 elsewhere, a Coun
syl test is priced at $99 for customers
with commercial insurance.
"We think of ourselves as a soft
ware company that just happens to
run a lab," Srinivasan said. "There is
no one single intervention [for the

low cost], but customizing all three of
those makes something work."
Looking into the future, the com
pany is focused on continuing to im
prove the aesthetic appeal and ease
of use of the test kits, with Srini
vasan noting that many companies in
the medical field offer products with
poor user interfaces.
"We want to reinvent genome
medicine as it's practiced in terms of
all the aesthetic details down to our
kit," Srinivasan said. "Attention to fit
and finish is not something that is
present in medicine and we want to
reshape that."
