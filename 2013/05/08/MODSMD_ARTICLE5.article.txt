## Senate suffers shaky start, passes first bill 
### LUCY SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 15th ASSU Undergraduate
Senate got off to an inauspicious start
in its first official meeting on Tuesday
evening, failing to book the body's
regular meeting room and conse
quently starting fifteen minutes late
in another Old Union room.
"I want to start by apologizing for

the room snafu," said new Senate
Chair Ben Holston 'l5. "I was un
aware that that was our responsibili
ty, but that still falls on me. We have
it fixed and will be back in Nitery for
the rest of the quarter and next year."
The 15th Senate successfully
passed its first bill, which amended
the body's committee structure from
the previous Senate. The bill, au
thored by the Administration and

Rules (A&R) Committee Chair John-
Lancaster Finley 'l6, dissolved the
Student Life, Housing, and Educa
tion Committee and created an Aca
demic Affairs Committee and a Stu
dent Life Caucus.
The 14th Senate, in fact, also had
an Academic Affairs Committee, the
structure and relevance of which came
under debate towards the end of the
previous Senate's time in office.
"All this did was... reinforce the
necessity of having an Academics
Affairs committee," said former
Senator Shahab Fadavi 'l5, who
chaired the committee during the
14th Senate, after the meeting.
During debate, Senator Hisham
Al-Falih 'l6 proposed an amend
ment to the bill which would strike
the changes and amend the bill to
leave the Student Life committee
unchanged while still adding an Aca
demic Affairs Committee.
"I am really afraid that we will
take this stance on our first official
meeting and then realize later that
this was not the wisest choice," Al-
Falih said. "I think we should keep
in mind that we can review this in its
whole situation at the beginning of
next year. I don't think we should
try to leap into anything. I am just
trying to play it safe."
Finley did not include the
amendment in the bill, explaining
that Al-Falih's amendment wasn't
feasible because Student Life is not
a designated committee per the Sen
ate's bylaws.
Frustrations flared quickly, how
ever, as the new Senate grew testy
during debate.
"We spent 45 minutes today
passing a relatively simple amend
ment," complained Senator Ilya
Mouzykantskii 'l6. "Perhaps it's
worth thinking about how we are
spending our time."
Senator Natasha Patel 'l6 clari
fied that in reality the debate lasted
about 17 minutes. The bill ultimate
ly passed with only Al-Falih in oppo
sition.
Finley framed the bill's passage

as an important step in A&R's ef
forts to update the Undergraduate
Senate's Bylaws, of which there is
no fully updated version. In fact, the
online version has not been updated
since 2010 despite changes having
been made in the interim.
"It's our belief that we should
start actually operating from the by
laws that are existing," Finley said.
"I want to change the bylaws now
because I think that it should be
precedent for the Senate that when
we are operating to make sure our
operating bylaws say what we are
doing. I think that's part of being ac
countable to the student body."
The newly formed Student Life
Caucus, headed by Mouzykantskii
and Eilaf Osman 'l6, spent some time
discussing the future of the buffer
fund. Spending from the buffer fund
unspent student group reserves
caused much debate in the 14th
Senate's final meeting and is not yet
subject to regulation.
Osman and Mouzykantskii said
that they hope to distinguish this
year's Senate by serving as a re
source for ad-hoc committees and
using the buffer fund to grant mon
ey to different student groups and
individuals to put on larger student
life events.
"We see ourselves as another
place to get money from. It's much
easier for us to issue money than it is
to go through [appropriations],"
Mouzykantskii said. "We see our
selves in a more reactionary capaci
ty with regards to events and cir
cumstances that are taking place on
campus."
To conclude the meeting, the
Senate created a new ad-hoc com
mittee currently named the Mental
Health Initiative. Senators also
passed a series of funding bills total
ing $22,180.78.
