## Study finds MRI scans best assess math skill 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine's Stanford Brain Devel
opment Project have recently dis
covered that MRI scans rather
than IQ tests or academic achieve
ment measures can most suc
cessfully predict how much a stu
dent's math skills will improve af
ter intensive tutoring.
The team's results were de
tailed in a study co-authored by
Professor of Psychiatry and Be
havioral Sciences Vinod Menon,
postdoctoral scholar Kaustubh Su
pekar Ph.D. 'lO PD. 'lO and re
search assistants Anna Swigart
and Caitlin Tenison. Postdoctoral
scholars Dietsje Jolles and Miriam
Rosenberg-Lee also collaborated
on the study.
According to Rosenberg-Lee,
the researchers found that certain
features of a student's hippocam
pusâ€” one of the major compo
nents of the brain's limbic system
determined how much the stu
dent's math skills improved af
ter tutoring.

"Children who had a larger hip
pocampus got more out of our
training," Rosenberg-Lee said.
"We found that the connections be
tween this memory area and other
parts of the brain also predicted
how much these kids would get out
of our training."
The team recruited 24 eight and
nine-year-old participants from
schools in Palo Alto and around the
Bay Area by distributing flyers
that encouraged students who
struggled with math to sign up for
the study.
At the beginning of the study,
the participants went through a
"pretty thorough" series of stan
dardized tests that included meas
urements of IQ, reading compre
hension and other cognitive skills,
according to Rosenberg-Lee. The
researchers also assessed the par
ticipants' arithmetic performance,
which was later used to measure
how much each student improved
