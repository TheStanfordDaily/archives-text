## Study finds MRI scans best assess math skill 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine's Stanford Brain Devel
opment Project have recently dis
covered that MRI scans rather
than IQ tests or academic achieve
ment measures can most suc
cessfully predict how much a stu
dent's math skills will improve af
ter intensive tutoring.
The team's results were de
tailed in a study co-authored by
Professor of Psychiatry and Be
havioral Sciences Vinod Menon,
postdoctoral scholar Kaustubh Su
pekar Ph.D. 'lO PD. 'lO and re
search assistants Anna Swigart
and Caitlin Tenison. Postdoctoral
scholars Dietsje Jolles and Miriam
Rosenberg-Lee also collaborated
on the study.
According to Rosenberg-Lee,
the researchers found that certain
features of a student's hippocam
pus— one of the major compo
nents of the brain's limbic system
determined how much the stu
dent's math skills improved af
ter tutoring.

"Children who had a larger hip
pocampus got more out of our
training," Rosenberg-Lee said.
"We found that the connections be
tween this memory area and other
parts of the brain also predicted
how much these kids would get out
of our training."
The team recruited 24 eight and
nine-year-old participants from
schools in Palo Alto and around the
Bay Area by distributing flyers
that encouraged students who
struggled with math to sign up for
the study.
At the beginning of the study,
the participants went through a
"pretty thorough" series of stan
dardized tests that included meas
urements of IQ, reading compre
hension and other cognitive skills,
according to Rosenberg-Lee. The
researchers also assessed the par
ticipants' arithmetic performance,
which was later used to measure
how much each student improved
after tutoring.
For the next four weeks, each
student received one-on-one math
tutoring for 40 minutes a day, three
times a week. The lab's research as
sistants and Stanford students
served as tutors, focusing on teach
ing the participants to memorize
and recall math facts.
"Everybody got better at this
arithmetic task after doing the tu
toring, but there was wide variation
in how much they improved,"

Rosenberg-Lee said. "Some kids
improved only eight percent, while
others improved 198 percent, and
so what we really wanted to under
stand is what predicted how much
kids were going to improve."
According to Rosenberg-Lee,
none of the standardized tests ad
ministered at the beginning of the
study, such as the IQ test, accurate
ly predicted which students would
benefit the most from tutoring, dis
proving a commonly-held belief
that students who have well-devel
oped math skills will benefit more
from tutoring than those who strug
gle with math.
"It wasn't the case that the kids
who were good at math were the

ones who learned the most,"
Rosenberg-Lee said. "At all differ
ent levels of ability, it was how big
the brain area was that predicted
how much a student was going to
learn."
Swigart noted that the study
was a continuation of the lab's in
vestigation into how math skills are
developed and whether or not stu
dents who struggle with math have
the potential to improve.
Though Swigart said that the
team's findings were significant,
she cautioned against assuming
that the size of a student's hip
pocampus could predict how much a
student would benefit from all types
of math tutoring, as the team's re

search was focused on testing mem
orization of math skills.
"Right now [the study] won't
have direct implications other than
saying that there are individual dif
ferences in learning and we can
predict from the brain which chil
dren will benefit from this particu
lar training more than other chil
dren," Swigart said. "But it could be
that there are other types of train
ing that other children would bene
fit more from, and that's something
that we don't know."
The researchers hope to conduct
a series of follow-up studies ranging
in focus from how students feel
about being tutored in math to fur
ther investigation into numerosity,

which Swigart described as one of
the "core principles that math cog
nition is built on."
Rosenberg-Lee noted that the
team also hopes to investigate what
makes a successful tutoring pro
gram, and which types of math tu
toring help students improve the
most.
"We found that the tutoring was
very effective, but we didn't know
how much was due to flashcards or
understanding the concepts,"
Rosenberg-Lee said. "For our fol
low-up study, we are going to try to
pull those apart."

dents who struggle with math have
the potential to improve.
Though Swigart said that the
team's findings were significant,
she cautioned against assuming
that the size of a student's hip
pocampus could predict how much a
student would benefit from all types
of math tutoring, as the team's re

search was focused on testing mem
orization of math skills.
"Right now [the study] won't
have direct implications other than
saying that there are individual dif
ferences in learning and we can
predict from the brain which chil
dren will benefit from this particu
lar training more than other chil
dren," Swigart said. "But it could be
that there are other types of train
ing that other children would bene
fit more from, and that's something
that we don't know."
The researchers hope to conduct
a series of follow-up studies ranging
in focus from how students feel
about being tutored in math to fur
ther investigation into numerosity,

which Swigart described as one of
the "core principles that math cog
nition is built on."
Rosenberg-Lee noted that the
team also hopes to investigate what
makes a successful tutoring pro
gram, and which types of math tu
toring help students improve the
most.
"We found that the tutoring was
very effective, but we didn't know
how much was due to flashcards or
understanding the concepts,"
Rosenberg-Lee said. "For our fol
low-up study, we are going to try to
pull those apart."
