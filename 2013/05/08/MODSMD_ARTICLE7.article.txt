# WATER OES
## TOUGH EXPECTATIONS FOR STAR-PACKED TEAM 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
The best college water polo
team ever. That's what
people called Stanford
women's water polo's
2013 squad before it even
played a game. The team has won
the last two NCAA championships
and now adds three players who took
a gap year from Stanford last season
to play for the U.S. National Team
that won the gold medal at the Lon
don Olympics.

This team should dominate. This
team shouldn't lose a game. This
team should have the easiest path to
the NCAA title in history. Or at least,
that's what outsiders said. Expecta
tions for this team have never been
higher.
But not everything has gone
smoothly. Stanford has already lost
twice, falling in the finals of the UC-
Irvine Invitational to USC back in
February and to the Trojans again in

the MPSF Championship game in
April, and managing egos has
proven to be a challenge.
"I think people want to know,
'what is it like to have these expecta
tions,'" said Stanford women's water
polo head coach John Tanner, "but
every kid who comes here knows
they have expectations. Their
teachers have expectations, their
classmates, their dormmates,
there's just an understanding that
you are going to bring your A-game
every day wherever you are on
campus. And that's why we're here.
"So, it's sort of, embrace that
kind of challenge and love having
people coming after us. 'Oh you're
getting everyone's best game'
well, we want nothing less than that
at any time, because that's what
we're expecting from one another."
Sophomore Kiley Neushul
played a big part of the most recent
of Stanford's NCAA champi
onships: last season's national title.

Neushul received the Peter J. Cuti
no award as the nation's top colle
giate water polo player in the after
math of the championship run.
"It was really great," Neushul
said, "but it was nothing less than
expected being recruited to this uni
versity and this team."
Last year's team won that cham
pionship without some of its biggest
stars. Senior Melissa Seidemann,
junior Annika Dries and freshman
Maggie Steffens were off training
with the national team for the
Olympics.
Just two months after Neushul
led Stanford to the NCAA title, her
fellow 2011 signee Steffens pro
pelled the National Team to the
gold medal, earning Olympic Most
Valuable Player honors along the
way.
Steffens earned her fame by
scoring goals. The talented fresh
man has a knack for beating goalies
in many different ways. On the
Olympic team, her role was to score.
But according to Tanner, she affects
the game in so many ways. And on
Stanford's loaded roster, Steffens'
other talents might be more impor
tant than her scoring.
With seven freshmen and the
three Olympians joining —or re
joining— Neushul and the defend
ing national champions, the pool is
getting crowded with talented play
ers unaccustomed to playing a sup
porting role.

"lt's been a little bit different in
corporating everyone in, even so

daily," Neushul said. "It's a bigger
team, and it's a different dynamic."
"At practice we have subs, and
sometimes more people sit out for
longer periods of time. So you're
kind of contributing in different
ways. Playing less minutes, maybe,
sitting out longer in practice, the
whole thing is reps, getting reps in."
While Neushul has been work
ing to adapt to changes in practice,
Seidemann has been working to ad
just back to life as a student-athlete
after a full year away from classes.
Seidemann, who called the transi
tion "really hard," took a full course
load of 20 units in the fall and winter
quarters.
Seidemann has assumed a dif
ferent role on the team this season,
coming off her Olympic experi
ences. In the Olympics, especially
the semifinal against Australia, Sei
demann would go through stretches
where she completely took over the
game. According to Tanner, the ex
perience has made her a completely
different player.
The change has shown in the
pool. Through the first 29 games of
the season 27 Stanford victories
and the two losses to USC Seide
mann has averaged 2.31 goals per
game. In 2011, the last time she
played for Stanford, Seidemann av
eraged 1.75 goals per game.
But Steffens and Neushul, who
won the award for best player in the
Olympics and best player in the
NCAA last season, respectively,
have seen their roles as scorers de

crease.
Neushul is scoring more than
half a goal less per game than in her
2012 National Player of the Year
campaign. After leading the team in
2012, she's now scoring less than
Seidemann and Steffens, and
trailed freshman Anna Yelizarova
for much of the season.
And Steffens' decline in goal
scoring has been much steeper.
Over the six-game Olympic tourna
ment, Steffens averaged 3.5 goals
per game. Her Stanford average
sits almost two goals per game low
er at 1.86.
For two players who achieved so
much success at such a high level
last season, accepting decreased of
fensive roles has been a tough pill to
swallow.
"There are a lot of egos on our
team," Neushul said. "We were all
the best players at our high schools,
but that's the challenge coming into
this program: suppressing those
egos and getting everybody to work
together as a team."
While Neushul and Steffens
have seen their goal scoring de
crease, some of their teammates
have suffered even harsher conse
quences from the very large influx
of top talent.
"We can't travel everyone all the
time," Neushul said, "so that's kind
of a bummer too. Whereas last year
everyone traveled, like there was
no competing for spots it was more
like I don't want to say it was
more of a family because this team

is always going to be a family to me
but I would say it's a little bit
more competitive in some re
spects."
The competitiveness within the
team may have increased, but most
of Stanford's games this season
have been nothing resembling com
petition. The Cardinal has
outscored opponents by almost nine
goals per contest.
So with the perhaps the best col
legiate water polo team of all time in
Cardinal red, at least on paper, Tan
ner has seen his competition turn to
unconventional methods just to try
to compete.
"Coaches have gone all over the
world," Tanner said, "trying to reel
in Australians, Canadians,
Spaniards, Hungarians, Dutch,
Germans, you name it, to load their
teams up quickly with talent to
chase us. A lot of teams this year
have very competitive teams be
cause they've seen the writing on
the wall and they want to come af
ter us."
With the surplus of internation
al talent fueling Stanford's rivals,
the college game may start to feel
like the Olympics. If Stanford can't
find away to integrate its stars, the
Cardinal, even with its surplus of
talent from defending Olympic and
NCAA champions, could come up
short this weekend at the NCAA
Tournament.
