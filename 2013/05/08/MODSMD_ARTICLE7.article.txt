# WATER OES
## TOUGH EXPECTATIONS FOR STAR-PACKED TEAM 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
The best college water polo
team ever. That's what
people called Stanford
women's water polo's
2013 squad before it even
played a game. The team has won
the last two NCAA championships
and now adds three players who took
a gap year from Stanford last season
to play for the U.S. National Team
that won the gold medal at the Lon
don Olympics.

This team should dominate. This
team shouldn't lose a game. This
team should have the easiest path to
the NCAA title in history. Or at least,
that's what outsiders said. Expecta
tions for this team have never been
higher.
But not everything has gone
smoothly. Stanford has already lost
twice, falling in the finals of the UC-
Irvine Invitational to USC back in
February and to the Trojans again in
