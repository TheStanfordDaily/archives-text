## NBA is bigger, but NCAA is better 
### Winston Shi 
I don't know why everybody likes
to complain about the NBA.
College basketball is fun. I will
grant the college fans that.
Standing in the cheering section
has been a revelation; Lakers games
are hardly so involved.
I have heard the same argument
over and over for why college basket
ball is superior: college players play
harder than NBA players. The sad
part is that that criticism is true; de
spite the fact that NBA players play
ing at half speed would still destroy
college teams, the NBA regular sea
son is intensely boring.
The season is too long; players
don't play 100 percent. Yes, the NBA
season is 10 or 20 games too long. Tes,
players are more intent on conserving
energy than on winning eveiy game.
But there are always compelling
games, even during the regular sea
son, and the NBA is at a special point
in its history: There is just so much tal
ent in the league and so many recog
nizable stars.
The Lakers played at 100 percent
during the regular season and made
the playoffs. But I doubt college fans
would have liked the Lakers. Granted,
they weren't exactly the most sympa
thetic bunch. Everyone laughed at the
Heat when they initially struggled af
ter forming their superteam. The
Lakers have the deck stacked in their
favor. I guess they don't deserve any
sympathy
But now that the playoffs are com
ing in, how many arguments are left?
Eveiy team is playing at maxi
mum effort. Every team is handing
the ball to their stars, and with the
worse teams in the NBA weeded out,
the level of competition is simply in
credible.
Pound-for-pound, the NBA might
have the finest athletes on the planet.
The Association has come under fire
for having so many playoff teams
half the league makes the playoffs
but amazingly enough, for perhaps the
first time in recent memory, it doesn't
feel as though there are any teams
that don't deserve to be in the postsea
son. That is how good the game is
right now
Monday's transcendent Warriors-
Spurs game was the best thing on tel
evision in months. Stephen Curry has
been a one-man offense for the entire
postseason, erupting night after night
as ESPN pointed out, in precisely
the same way that March Madness is
so famous for. Curry carried his
Davidson team to the Elite Eight in
his sophomore season. He is doing the
same thing right now.
I never expected Curry to be this
good. I thought he would be just an
other one of those designated shoot
ers in the Adam Morrison mold that
ends up as a role player at best. Per
haps that's why college fans are so
uncomfortable watching the NBA:
it's understandably strange for fans
to see their college favorites so often
crash and burn in the Association.
Why is the NBA so different? Why
couldn't basketball IQ make up the
difference?
But that's the cost of playing at a
high level. So many players have bas
ketball IQ and athleticism. NBA play
ers run the same pick-and-roll over
and over and over again at times, but
there are so many variants and little
decisions that players have to make on
that one play Every play in the NBA
is refined to perfection. The San Anto
nio Spurs, who defeated Curry's War
riors on Monday are famous for tech
nical perfection, selfless play and hard
work, but nevertheless they are derid
ed as boring.
Is it because the Spurs don't have
players that are transcendent charac
ters; Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili
have quiet personal lives, and while
Tony Parker was married to Eva Lon
goria for a while, the most interesting
thing he's done off the court is get in
jured accidentally when two rappers'
entourages were brawling nearby.
I suppose that the real reason why
NCAA basketball is compelling is that
unlike the Spurs' players, the fans feel
a real connection to college players.
The Lakers do not really represent
me; only one player on the team (Steve
Nash) even went to college in Califor
nia, and he's Canadian. But college
players go to the same school as we do;
they have a different experience be
cause of their monstrous time commit
ments, but they still do substantially
the same things. They are always part
of the school in the same way that a
virtuoso pianist is part of the school.
We don't have that in the NBA
And that's why I like college ball
too.

Winston Shi wants it known that he
almost lives the life of a college bas
ketball star. Encourage him to take
that final step and walk on next
year at wshi9Jf@stanford.edu.
