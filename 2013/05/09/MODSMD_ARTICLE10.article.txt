## One Canuck's Canadian complex 
### Joseph Beyda 
There are a few differences
between Daily editor-in
chief-to-be Ed Ngai and I
that you should know
about. I'm a Sharks fan;
he's a Canucks fan. My team just
swept his in the first round of the
Stanley Cup Playoffs. I can't help but
write about the NHL right now, but
he's so sick of hockey that he proba
bly won't even read this column, de
spite my effort to include (poke fun
at?) him in this paragraph.
There's one other thing you've
probably already figured out: Ed is
Canadian; I am American. That is to
say: he is supposed to love hockey; I
am not.
Nationality is a label that's all too
easy to associate with fans of the
greatest professional sport on earth.
American fans definitely feel the dis
parity. As a living counterexample to
that stereotype, I do feel a bit mar
ginalized in a sports market that
treats the NHL as the awkward
younger cousin of the MLB, NFL
and NBA (though the NHL was
founded second of the four), and I do
feel like Canadian fans think they're a
bit better than my 17,561 friends and
I at HP Pavilion (though 23 of the
NHEs 30 teams are located south of
the border).

But even though American hock
ey fans are aware of the pseudo-rival
ry between North and South, we
don't really mind it. There's noth
ing an American fan hates more
than having to listen to a second na
tional anthem how dare you
keep me from my hockey! and
even if we rarely boo "0 Canada,"
which is only played at a game
against a Canadian team, the start
of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
