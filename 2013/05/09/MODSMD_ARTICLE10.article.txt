## One Canuck's Canadian complex 
### Joseph Beyda 
There are a few differences
between Daily editor-in
chief-to-be Ed Ngai and I
that you should know
about. I'm a Sharks fan;
he's a Canucks fan. My team just
swept his in the first round of the
Stanley Cup Playoffs. I can't help but
write about the NHL right now, but
he's so sick of hockey that he proba
bly won't even read this column, de
spite my effort to include (poke fun
at?) him in this paragraph.
There's one other thing you've
probably already figured out: Ed is
Canadian; I am American. That is to
say: he is supposed to love hockey; I
am not.
Nationality is a label that's all too
easy to associate with fans of the
greatest professional sport on earth.
American fans definitely feel the dis
parity. As a living counterexample to
that stereotype, I do feel a bit mar
ginalized in a sports market that
treats the NHL as the awkward
younger cousin of the MLB, NFL
and NBA (though the NHL was
founded second of the four), and I do
feel like Canadian fans think they're a
bit better than my 17,561 friends and
I at HP Pavilion (though 23 of the
NHEs 30 teams are located south of
the border).

But even though American hock
ey fans are aware of the pseudo-rival
ry between North and South, we
don't really mind it. There's noth
ing an American fan hates more
than having to listen to a second na
tional anthem how dare you
keep me from my hockey! and
even if we rarely boo "0 Canada,"
which is only played at a game
against a Canadian team, the start
of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
will elicit quite a round of cheers at
any two-anthem game played on
American soil. It's all fine, as long
as it's left in the realm of the fans.

But that bubble was burst by
Vancouver defenseman Kevin
Bieksa (one of Ed's own) on Mon
day, the day after the Canucks had
fallen to 0-3 in the series. Vancou
ver had allowed three power-play
goals in its 5-2 loss in game three,
but the Canucks weren't too
pleased with the eight penalties
they had to kill. So Bieksa called
out Sharks stars Joe Thornton and
Logan Couture for embellishing on
penalty calls, referring to them as
"so-called Canadians."

"Those are two Canadian guys
who are supposed to be playing the
game with integrity," he added.
The comments were laughed at
around the league. The refs had
been spot-on the night before and
Bieksa is considered one of the
worst culprits on a Vancouver team
that is itself well known for diving.
But just as interesting is Biek
sa's implication that Canadians are
somehow supposed to uphold hock
ey's integrity. Maybe it was just a
bit of gamesmanship Bieksa
was, of course, speaking from a
locker room in sunny San Jose
yet there's something distinctly na
tionalist (in a bad way) about what
he said. For those not familiar with
the origin of the team name,
"Canuck" is to Canada what "Yan
kee" is to America. But I can't re
member the last time Derek Jeter,
a clean, American baseball player
for the Yankees, pinned his sport's
steroid problems on the MLB's

Central Americans or Ichiro.
So why should diving in hockey
have anything to do with Canadi
an-ness? What does Bieksa have
to say about the playing style of
the Sharks' Joe Pavelski, a Wis
consin native? (Bad example;
Pavelski scored two goals each in
games three and four to help elim
inate Vancouver. But you get the
point.)
I doubt Bieksa really meant
that non-Canadians play dirty
hockey. His own team's stars, the
Sedin twins, are Swedish; the
goalie he plays in front of (almost)
every night, Cory Schneider, is
Bostonian. But it's a bit disturbing
that, in searching for a backhand
ed insult to deliver to the Vancou
ver media, "so-called Canadian"
seemed to do the trick.
Mr. Bieksa, the NHL wouldn't
exist without non-Canadians. U.S.
fans fill your pockets while Ameri
can and European players fill your
rosters. The league's offices are lo
cated in New York City and the
Stanley Cup has been won by an
American team 20 years in a row.
So if the Canucks were just
dominated by a team that is located
in California which is about as
close to the opposite of Canada as
you can get and is led by Cou
ture and Thornton, the two On
tario-born players who you don't
believe deserve to call themselves
your countrymen... well, then
maybe Canadians aren't so good at
hockey after all.
Take that, Ed.

The San Jose Sharks moving on to
the second round means another
week of Joseph Beyda sharking his
responsibilities. Tell him whether
that is a valid excuse or not atjbey

Stanley Cup Playoffs. I can't help but
write about the NHL right now, but
he's so sick of hockey that he proba
bly won't even read this column, de
spite my effort to include (poke fun
at?) him in this paragraph.
There's one other thing you've
probably already figured out: Ed is
Canadian; I am American. That is to
say: he is supposed to love hockey; I
am not.
Nationality is a label that's all too
easy to associate with fans of the
greatest professional sport on earth.
American fans definitely feel the dis
parity. As a living counterexample to
that stereotype, I do feel a bit mar
ginalized in a sports market that
treats the NHL as the awkward
younger cousin of the MLB, NFL
and NBA (though the NHL was
founded second of the four), and I do
feel like Canadian fans think they're a
bit better than my 17,561 friends and
I at HP Pavilion (though 23 of the
NHEs 30 teams are located south of
the border).

But even though American hock
ey fans are aware of the pseudo-rival
ry between North and South, we
don't really mind it. There's noth
ing an American fan hates more
than having to listen to a second na
tional anthem how dare you
keep me from my hockey! and
even if we rarely boo "0 Canada,"
which is only played at a game
against a Canadian team, the start
of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
will elicit quite a round of cheers at
any two-anthem game played on
American soil. It's all fine, as long
as it's left in the realm of the fans.

But that bubble was burst by
Vancouver defenseman Kevin
Bieksa (one of Ed's own) on Mon
day, the day after the Canucks had
fallen to 0-3 in the series. Vancou
ver had allowed three power-play
goals in its 5-2 loss in game three,
but the Canucks weren't too
pleased with the eight penalties
they had to kill. So Bieksa called
out Sharks stars Joe Thornton and
Logan Couture for embellishing on
penalty calls, referring to them as
"so-called Canadians."

"Those are two Canadian guys
who are supposed to be playing the
game with integrity," he added.
The comments were laughed at
around the league. The refs had
been spot-on the night before and
Bieksa is considered one of the
worst culprits on a Vancouver team
that is itself well known for diving.
But just as interesting is Biek
sa's implication that Canadians are
somehow supposed to uphold hock
ey's integrity. Maybe it was just a
bit of gamesmanship Bieksa
was, of course, speaking from a
locker room in sunny San Jose
yet there's something distinctly na
tionalist (in a bad way) about what
he said. For those not familiar with
the origin of the team name,
"Canuck" is to Canada what "Yan
kee" is to America. But I can't re
member the last time Derek Jeter,
a clean, American baseball player
for the Yankees, pinned his sport's
steroid problems on the MLB's

Central Americans or Ichiro.
So why should diving in hockey
have anything to do with Canadi
an-ness? What does Bieksa have
to say about the playing style of
the Sharks' Joe Pavelski, a Wis
consin native? (Bad example;
Pavelski scored two goals each in
games three and four to help elim
inate Vancouver. But you get the
point.)
I doubt Bieksa really meant
that non-Canadians play dirty
hockey. His own team's stars, the
Sedin twins, are Swedish; the
goalie he plays in front of (almost)
every night, Cory Schneider, is
Bostonian. But it's a bit disturbing
that, in searching for a backhand
ed insult to deliver to the Vancou
ver media, "so-called Canadian"
seemed to do the trick.
Mr. Bieksa, the NHL wouldn't
exist without non-Canadians. U.S.
fans fill your pockets while Ameri
can and European players fill your
rosters. The league's offices are lo
cated in New York City and the
Stanley Cup has been won by an
American team 20 years in a row.
So if the Canucks were just
dominated by a team that is located
in California which is about as
close to the opposite of Canada as
you can get and is led by Cou
ture and Thornton, the two On
tario-born players who you don't
believe deserve to call themselves
your countrymen... well, then
maybe Canadians aren't so good at
hockey after all.
Take that, Ed.

The San Jose Sharks moving on to
the second round means another
week of Joseph Beyda sharking his
responsibilities. Tell him whether
that is a valid excuse or not atjbey
