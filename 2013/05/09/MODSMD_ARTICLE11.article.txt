# TOURNEY TEE-OFF
## Card looks to defend home course at Regionals 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford women's golf team will look
to qualify for its fourth consecutive NCAA Champi
onships when it begins play at the NCAA West Re
gional on its home course today.
The West Regional will be extremely competitive.
The 24-team field features four top-10 teams, includ
ing familiar foes No. 1 USC and No. 5 Arizona in ad
dition to No. 8 Vanderbilt and No. 9 Purdue. Five of
the nation's top 15 individuals will square off, at
tempting to book a trip to the NCAA Championships
in Athens, Ga. with a top-eight team finish.
"For us to compete this week, all five players will
have to contribute at a high level," said head coach
Anne Walker. "We can't rely on our 'top' players. We
will need a full team effort to qualify for the National
Championship. The field is very strong this week... we
can compete with all of these teams and hope to do so."
No doubt the Cardinal will need its 2-3-4-5 players
to play well in order to advance, but if the team wants
to compete for a championship, freshman Mariah
Stackhouse will have to be firing on all cylinders. The
superstar-to-be has risen to No. 3 in the
GolfWeek/Sagarin individual rankings and is coming
off a tie for third place at her first Pac-12 Champi
onships. This will be her first competitive round at
the Stanford Golf Course since her record-setting
performance at the Peg Barnard Invitational in Feb
ruary, when Stackhouse fired a mind-boggling 61 on
the tournament's final day.
On the individual front, Stackhouse will grapple
with No. 1 Annie Park and No. 4 Sophia Popov of
USC the last two Pac-12 individual champions
in addition to No. 7 Grace Na of Pepperdine and No.
14 Hayley Davis of Baylor. Na's 9-under-par single
round performance at the Las Vegas Collegiate
Showdown in 2011 is tied for the second-lowest colle
giate round of all time, rivaled only by Stackhouse's
10-under this year.
"I feel very prepared for this tournament," Stack
house said. "Over the last few days I've worked a lot
on the accuracy of my iron shots, and they've been
looking g00d... That was a great round earlier this
year, but this is a new tournament and I'll leave
thoughts of the Peg Barnard out of my head as we
stai*t Regionals tomorrow."
Fellow freshman Lauren Kim also comes into Re
gionals having played well on her home course back
in February. While she tied for fifth at the Peg

Senior Sally Watson (above) has placed in the top 10 at two NCAA Regionals, and
another such performance this week could help propel the Card past the opening round.
