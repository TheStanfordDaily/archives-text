## Card looks to defend home course at Regionals 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford women's golf team will look
to qualify for its fourth consecutive NCAA Champi
onships when it begins play at the NCAA West Re
gional on its home course today.
The West Regional will be extremely competitive.
The 24-team field features four top-10 teams, includ
ing familiar foes No. 1 USC and No. 5 Arizona in ad
dition to No. 8 Vanderbilt and No. 9 Purdue. Five of
the nation's top 15 individuals will square off, at
tempting to book a trip to the NCAA Championships
in Athens, Ga. with a top-eight team finish.
"For us to compete this week, all five players will
have to contribute at a high level," said head coach
Anne Walker. "We can't rely on our 'top' players. We
will need a full team effort to qualify for the National
Championship. The field is very strong this week... we
can compete with all of these teams and hope to do so."
No doubt the Cardinal will need its 2-3-4-5 players
to play well in order to advance, but if the team wants
to compete for a championship, freshman Mariah
Stackhouse will have to be firing on all cylinders. The
superstar-to-be has risen to No. 3 in the
GolfWeek/Sagarin individual rankings and is coming
off a tie for third place at her first Pac-12 Champi
onships. This will be her first competitive round at
the Stanford Golf Course since her record-setting
performance at the Peg Barnard Invitational in Feb
ruary, when Stackhouse fired a mind-boggling 61 on
the tournament's final day.
On the individual front, Stackhouse will grapple
with No. 1 Annie Park and No. 4 Sophia Popov of
USC the last two Pac-12 individual champions
in addition to No. 7 Grace Na of Pepperdine and No.
14 Hayley Davis of Baylor. Na's 9-under-par single
round performance at the Las Vegas Collegiate
Showdown in 2011 is tied for the second-lowest colle
giate round of all time, rivaled only by Stackhouse's
10-under this year.
"I feel very prepared for this tournament," Stack
house said. "Over the last few days I've worked a lot
on the accuracy of my iron shots, and they've been
looking g00d... That was a great round earlier this
year, but this is a new tournament and I'll leave
thoughts of the Peg Barnard out of my head as we
stai*t Regionals tomorrow."
Fellow freshman Lauren Kim also comes into Re
gionals having played well on her home course back
in February. While she tied for fifth at the Peg

Senior Sally Watson (above) has placed in the top 10 at two NCAA Regionals, and
another such performance this week could help propel the Card past the opening round.
Barnard with an even-par two
round 142, Kim knows that she and
her teammates will face a much
tougher task this time around.
"Because the setup of the course
is left to the NCAA to decide, it will
play much longer and more difficult
than the Peg Barnard did in Febru
ary," Kim said. "The rough will be
long and thick and the green's a bit
faster... We play the course at least
twice every week and we all know it
so well. We are very comfortable on
our course and I think that comfort
will play to our advantage."
Walker echoed those sentiments,
but the coach who has preached a
"see-it-to-achieve-it" mentality of
fered an important caveat.
"There are more advantages
than disadvantages of playing at
home," Walker commented. "We
know the course, we have the home
crowd support and we are comfort
able in the environment. The disad
vantage is that there are quite a few
distractions for our players versus
other teams. However, I feel confi
dent that our team will make the
most of this opportunity to compete
in front of a home crowd."
While Stackhouse and Kim each

are just two tournaments into what,
in all likelihood, will be long and suc
cessful postseason careers, this
event may be Sally Watson's last.
The senior from Scotland is seeking
her third top-10 regional finish after
tying for seventh and placing fourth
at the West Regionals her freshman
and junior years, respectively. De
spite the air of finality, Watson plans
on keeping the same mindset that
has made her successful for the last
four years.
"As a senior, my biggest advan
tage is just knowing what it feels like
to play Regionals and at home,
since we hosted my freshman year
but other than that, everything is
the same," Watson said. "That is
something coach [Walker] has really
stressed these past few weeks. Just
keep doing everything the same:
having fun and fighting until the
end."

This Stanford team will be look
ing to improve upon its recent track
record of qualifying for the NCAA
Championships but faltering there
after. In the past three years, the
Cardinal women have recorded an
average regional finish of sixth, but
a 22nd-place average in the 24-team
NCAA Championship field.
The NCAA West Regional kicks
off at 7:30 a.m. Thursday morning.
