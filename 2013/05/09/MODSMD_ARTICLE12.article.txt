## Tennis threatened by Tigers 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
After a rocky season, the
No. 40 Stanford men's tennis
team qualified for the NCAA
Championships in Malibu,
Calif., through an at-large bid
and will face off against No.
20 LSU in the first round of
the tournament this Friday.
Though the Cardinal has
a 6-0 series record against
LSU, the two teams have not
played each other since 1998.
LSU has a 15-11 record this
season and lost in the first
round of the Southeastern
Conference (SEC) Champi
onships.

LSU has two nationally
ranked singles players, No.
42 Chris Simpson and No. 91
Stefan Szacinski. The Tigers
also have two ranked doubles
teams: No. 31 Szacinski and
Tarn Trinh and No. 74 Simp
son and Szacinski.

Stanford's sophomore
John Morrissey, who is cur
rently ranked 50th, is Stan
ford's only nationally ranked
singles player. Morrissey and
senior Denis Lin are ranked
54th in doubles.

Although Morrissey said
that the outcome of the
match against LSU will be

"very difficult to call" since
the teams play in different
conferences, he believes that
the Cardinal can pick up a
victory if the team focuses on
improving upon the momen
tum gained from the end of
the season.

"[LSU] had some really
good results this year and
they are obviously a really
good team with a lot of talent
ed players," Morrissey said.
"We are going to try to build
off some of the good perform
ances we have put in towards
the latter half of the year."

While the Cardinal has a
12-11 season record and 3-4
Pac-12 record, the team's
conference matches have
been against some of the
toughest teams in the nation,
including No. 1 UCLA and
No. 4 USC.

Stanford was seeded
fourth in the Pac-12 Champi
onships in late April and fell
to UCLA 4-0 in the semifi
nals after a 4-3 victory over
No. 33 Washington in the
quarterfinals. UCLA and
USC automatically qualified
for the NCAA Champi
onships after finishing first
and runner-up, respectively,
in the Pac-12 Championships.
"We definitely weren't

satisfied with how things
went down there," Morrissey
said. "We were happy with
the win against Washington,
but definitely thought we
could have done more against
UCLA."

The Cardinal has suffered
narrow defeats against high
ly ranked teams, falling 4-3 to
both No. 7 Pepperdine and
No. 18 Berkeley at home at
the end of the season, but
was able to pull off decisive
victories against lower
ranked or unranked teams,
including Arizona, No. 73
Utah and No. 71 Pacific.
If the Cardinal advances
past the first round of the
NCAAs, they will play the
winner of the match be
tween Pepperdine, who is
hosting the first two rounds
of the tournament, and UC-
Santa Barbara.

The Cardinal has played
in all but four of the NCAA
Championships held since
1977 and has won the tourna
ment's team title 15 times,
with the most recent victory
in 2000. Last season, the
team advanced to the quar
terfinals before falling 4-0 to
Virginia.
Under Bradley Klahn 'l2 the
team's former No. 1 player, Stan
ford reached two consecutive
NCAA semifinals in 2010 and 2011.
Klahn also claimed the NCAA sin
gles title in 2010 and was the run
ner-up doubles champion in 2011
with Ryan Thacher 'l2.

Stanford has had 14 NCAA sin
gles champions, including Bob
Bryan and John McEnroe '7B, who
won the tournament in 1998 and
1978, respectively.
"Stanford is definitely no
stranger to doing well in this tour
nament, and I think that even
though we are a young team, we

feel that we can be extremely dan
gerous if we go out there and play
with a lot of intensity," Morrissey
said.

Morrissey was the Cardinal's
only player to qualify for the indi
vidual portion of the NCAA Tour
nament, which will be held from
May 22 to 27 in Urbana, 111. The fi
nal rounds of the team champi
onships will also be held in Urbana
in late May.
"It's a huge honor to qualify for
that, and I'm really happy to be go
ing to that tournament, but for the
moment it is at the back of my
mind," Morrissey said. "I'm focus
ing on getting the team to Illinois as
well, and hopefully we can all be
there together."
