## Tennis threatened by Tigers 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
After a rocky season, the
No. 40 Stanford men's tennis
team qualified for the NCAA
Championships in Malibu,
Calif., through an at-large bid
and will face off against No.
20 LSU in the first round of
the tournament this Friday.
Though the Cardinal has
a 6-0 series record against
LSU, the two teams have not
played each other since 1998.
LSU has a 15-11 record this
season and lost in the first
round of the Southeastern
Conference (SEC) Champi
onships.

LSU has two nationally
ranked singles players, No.
42 Chris Simpson and No. 91
Stefan Szacinski. The Tigers
also have two ranked doubles
teams: No. 31 Szacinski and
Tarn Trinh and No. 74 Simp
son and Szacinski.

Stanford's sophomore
John Morrissey, who is cur
rently ranked 50th, is Stan
ford's only nationally ranked
singles player. Morrissey and
senior Denis Lin are ranked
54th in doubles.

Although Morrissey said
that the outcome of the
match against LSU will be

"very difficult to call" since
the teams play in different
conferences, he believes that
the Cardinal can pick up a
victory if the team focuses on
improving upon the momen
tum gained from the end of
the season.

"[LSU] had some really
good results this year and
they are obviously a really
good team with a lot of talent
ed players," Morrissey said.
"We are going to try to build
off some of the good perform
ances we have put in towards
the latter half of the year."

While the Cardinal has a
12-11 season record and 3-4
Pac-12 record, the team's
conference matches have
been against some of the
toughest teams in the nation,
including No. 1 UCLA and
No. 4 USC.

Stanford was seeded
fourth in the Pac-12 Champi
onships in late April and fell
to UCLA 4-0 in the semifi
nals after a 4-3 victory over
No. 33 Washington in the
quarterfinals. UCLA and
USC automatically qualified
for the NCAA Champi
onships after finishing first
and runner-up, respectively,
in the Pac-12 Championships.
"We definitely weren't

satisfied with how things
went down there," Morrissey
said. "We were happy with
the win against Washington,
but definitely thought we
could have done more against
UCLA."

The Cardinal has suffered
narrow defeats against high
ly ranked teams, falling 4-3 to
both No. 7 Pepperdine and
No. 18 Berkeley at home at
the end of the season, but
was able to pull off decisive
victories against lower
ranked or unranked teams,
including Arizona, No. 73
Utah and No. 71 Pacific.
If the Cardinal advances
past the first round of the
NCAAs, they will play the
winner of the match be
tween Pepperdine, who is
hosting the first two rounds
of the tournament, and UC-
Santa Barbara.

The Cardinal has played
in all but four of the NCAA
Championships held since
1977 and has won the tourna
ment's team title 15 times,
with the most recent victory
in 2000. Last season, the
team advanced to the quar
terfinals before falling 4-0 to
Virginia.
