## GROWING IN A MODERN WORLD Graciela Watrous The
						Promise of For-Profit Urban Agriculture 
### 
Four years ago, something
novel happened in Detroit.
John Hantz, a rich entrepre
neur, decided to pursue the cre
ation of Detroit's largest for-profit
urban garden.

Hantz's initial plan was to buy
10,000 acres from the city and turn
it into a farm that housed a diversi
ty of crops and trees. That's a lot of
land, but it's important to remem
ber that over the last decade, De
troit's population has declined by
25 percent and that 40 square
miles, or about 2,5000 acres, are
now vacant within the city due to
foreclosures. Hantz's idea was sim
ple: to provide work, fresh food,
and a hospitable, pleasant outdoor
space in an environment that was
short on all three. Urban garden
ing isn't totally new to Detroit, but
its scale was unlike anything pro
posed by a private developer.
Unlikely as it sounds, Detroit
has no real shortage of small-scale
urban farms. In the last couple of
years it has been estimated that
there are as many as 355 urban
agricultural farms and gardens in
the city. Most of them are small,
and many of them are non-profit
community gardens. Detroit Black
Community Food Security Net
work, for example, runs one of the
more successful community gar
dens within the city limits. It hosts
a 1.5-acre vegetable garden and an
apple orchard. Several other NGOs
have sprung up in the last couple of
years, like Greening of Detroit,
which has given the urban agricul
tural movement in Detroit legiti
macy and force. Even an institu
tion like Detroit's Eastern Market
(a farmer's market founded in
1891) has changed its purpose to
become part of this new movement.
Michigan State University has
even been pouring money into ur
ban agricultural research, spend
ing $lOO million on an urban agri
cultural center in Detroit and fi
nancing a $1.5-million project
called Metro Food Plus, which aims
to reshape the food system in De
troit and beyond.

But Hantz stepped into a
morass of competing visions for the
future of Detroit and all the vari
ous ideologies that butt heads over
how to best use the vacant land to
rebuild the city. Since the time of
his initial idea, the city government
and various citizen groups have
scrutinized and arm-wrestled the
plan to the point that now the land
will be converted into a 200-acre
tree farm.

Debate around the Hantz farm
spanned more than what should be
grown there and included whether
the farm should exist at all. Even
advocates of urban farming in De
troit questioned its existence.
Some characterized it as a "corpo
rate land grab," stating that Hantz
had bought the land at a hugely un
dervalued price and suggesting the
government gave him special
treatment. With population declin
ing and high poverty rates in De
troit, activists wonder why the city
can't offer those prices to the peo
ple who already live there. They
wondered whether a for-profit
farm of this size would change the
role of urban agriculture in the
area. Community organizations
view urban gardening as a commu
nity-building tool, not a business,
as Hantz has proposed. I attempt
ed to contact several urban agricul
turally focused non-profits in De
troit, and none of them returned
my calls to comment.

I recently spoke to Mike Score,
the president of Hantz Farms,

about the specific charges that var
ious writers and community board
advocates had leveled against the
farm. He told me that the main op
ponents actually came from within
the local government, and that dur
ing the time the farm has been pro
posed, there have been four may
ors and many changes to the city
council, which therefore required
restarting discussions several
times. On an ideological level, the
local government resisted the farm
because of its own development
plans for the city. The local govern
ment did not return my calls for
comment.

But as Score pointed out, the
city does not necessarily have the
money to put any of their large
scale plans into play. Non-profits
also raised some objections to
Hantz' plan, such as the aforemen
tioned price of the land, the city's
responsibility to its people and a
need for urban gardening to re
main solely a mechanism for com
munity empowerment. Score
agrees that the current price of
city land is too high and that citi
zens of Detroit should have an op
portunity to buy vacant plots if
they so desire.

He objects, however, to the idea
that Hantz Farms won't build com
munity. In fact, when I asked how
Hantz Farm had accommodated
the surrounding neighborhoods, he
had a list ready for me. Scope told
me that 90 percent of the people
one square mile from the parame
ters of the farm support the proj
ect. Second, community members
were concerned that food crops
would attract rodents. So Hantz
Farm became a tree farm. Third,
Score initiated a program where
vacant lots next to properties sur
rounding the farm must be offered
to the neighboring property owner
at a lower price. Fourth, Score
plans to keep all roads and streets
through the 200-acre property in
tact so that community members
feel free to walk through the farm
and enjoy the trees. When I asked
Score whether he considered for
profit urban agriculture to be part
of Detroit's future, he answered af
firmatively. He expects both large
and small companies to emerge in
Hantz Farm's footsteps.
This process has already begun.
Farms like Food Field have sprung
up in the last couple of years with
the mission of creating an alterna
tive (not simply a supplement) to
our industrialized food system.
Food Field grows organic produce
on four acres of land in Detroit and
is looking to expand into aquapon
ics, a closed-loop system where
both vegetables and fish are grown.
Both Food Field and Hantz Farm
stand as testaments to the need for
a for-profit urban gardening initia
tive that can work at scale to truly
change the food system and make
Detroit a more habitable place.
Furthermore, the ideology of
the city government and non-prof
its are not fundamentally opposed
to farms like these; both would like
to see a greener, economically
healthy Detroit. Some green initia
tives can and will be governmental
or prompted by NGOs. But when
something as potentially useful as
two hundred acres of a tree farm
growing in the middle of a city
come along, it is hard to not think
that it's a step for a better future
one in which government, NGOs
and private capital all combine to
produce a brilliant mosaic.
