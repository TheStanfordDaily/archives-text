# THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## Is Drugging the Answer? 
### Adam Johnson 
In late October of last year, I
wrote a column on the presiden
tial election in which I asked my
readers which third party candidate
they believed I should cast my vote
for. At the time, I had every inten
tion of voting; my absentee ballot
was sitting on my desk, waiting to
be filled in. Some of my readers
might be surprised to learn, then,
that I never did vote in the 2012
election. This was not out of protest,
or disinterest, but rather careless
ness; I missed the deadline to send
in my absentee ballot.

This chain of events did not sur
prise me; I am moderately forgetful,
often inattentive to "minor" details
like deadlines and neglectful of basic
tasks like getting my car serviced. In
fact, I recently took three online
tests which unanimously concluded
that I had anywhere from a mild to
moderate attention deficit disorder.
These tests may very well have giv
en me an inaccurate diagnosis
and I still do not view myself as "dis
ordered" â€” but perhaps the aver
age doctor would conclude that I do,
in fact, have ADHD; one can only
wonder, especially given the increas
ing rates of ADHD diagnoses in the
United States today.

While I was never formally test
ed for ADHD or put on ADHD med

ications, a staggering number of
children today have been found to
have the disorder. The New York
Times, analyzing CDC data, recent
ly found that almost 1 in 5 high
school boys are diagnosed with AD
HD. Girls are diagnosed with less
frequency, but still at an alarmingly
high rate that has only increased
over the years. Roughly two-thirds
of the millions of children found to
have the disorder are prescribed
psychotropic medications like
Adderall. These drugs are, from
what I understand, quite powerful,
occasionally exhibiting side effects
ranging from difficulty sleeping to
depression.

And here is where the debate be
gins. The increasing diagnosis of
ADHD and the resultant prescrip
tion of psychotropic drugs is surely a
complex issue with multiple promi
nent stakeholder groups. Even with
out taking into account the abuse of
these drugs, a topic addressed last
spring by the Editorial Board that I
chaired, there is the argument over
whether children today are more hy
peractive and unable to focus,
whether doctors (and parents and
teachers who send children to doc
tors) are more likely to medicate
children, or whether the home and
school environments for today's
youth are more likely to lead to "ab
normal" behavior.

Most likely, it is a combination of
all three: there is reason to believe
that the increasing presence of tech
nology and its ever-shortening stim
uli serves to reduce attention spans,
although research in this field is still
in its infancy. On the second front,
the criteria for diagnosing ADHD as
established by the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disor
ders have become more lenient over
time, a process no doubt welcomed
by the pharmaceutical industry,
which stands to gain billions of dol
lars from selling more drugs. And fi
nally, the average public school to
day, under the specter of high-stakes
testing that emphasizes rote memo
rization and abolishes high-energy
courses like gym and art, fosters a
classroom environment that makes
children on the ADHD spectrum
stand out as "poor" students.
Surely, there are those with AD
HD who would have been diagnosed
in most eras under the most strin
gent definitions of the disorder. And
medication, for these youth, is often

a godsend. But if we are approach
ing the point where the average boy
is being labeled as "disordered,"
something is clearly wrong. The
loosening of diagnostic standards is
one problem; a pediatric neurologist
quoted in The New York Times arti
cle stated that "mild symptoms are
being diagnosed so readily, which
goes well beyond the disorder and
beyond the zone of ambiguity to
pure enhancement of children who
are otherwise healthy."
While it is easy to place blame on
the medical system, we must re
member who is often demanding the
ADHD diagnosis and drugs to boot:
the parents. But I don't blame par
ents either they are merely look
ing out for their children's best inter
ests. Rather, I believe our
technophilic system demands too
much of our children. Today's youth
are placed in environments that are
antithetical to the human condition.
While I actually love taking tests, it is
wrong that we judge intelligence and
merit based on who can fill in the
right bubbles life is about so much
more than that. And while we're at it,
perhaps our system demands too
much of adults; mundane tasks like
paying bills and filing taxes are the
proper work of machines, not hu
mans, yet completing these and re
lated actions are all but necessary to
be labeled as a functional adult.

Perhaps I am foolish, but I long
for the time when children were ed
ucated by reading the literary canon
or taking on apprenticeships. I long
for a time when the average adult
did not have to worry about paying
off half a dozen credit cards. Such a
time, if it ever existed, seems much
more compatible with human na
ture.

But instead we have today's
world in which we define success as
our ability to provide answers to
predetermined questions and per
form dull tasks at the service of the
system. Some of us including
many students here are suited
quite well for such a life. The rest of
us are labeled as "disordered" and
given psychotropic drugs to get
with the program. I generally like
to end my articles on a positive
note, but right now the only words
that I can think of are c'est la vie.
