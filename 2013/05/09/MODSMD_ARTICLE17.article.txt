# Postseason pressure
## 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
After a brief hiatus following the
end of the regular season and the
conclusion of the Pac-12 Individual
Tournament, the Stanford women's
tennis team will begin its quest for
a national title this Friday against
Miami (OH) in its 32nd consecutive
NCAA Tournament appearance.
The lull in match play has given
the players even more impetus to
prepare for the pinnacle of their
season. Junior co-captain Nicole
Gibbs, who spearheads the top of
Stanford's lineup in both singles
and doubles, attested to the disci
pline of all the players at this point
in the season.

"We've been really insistent up
on people having good attitudes,"
said Gibbs. "We've even imple
mented a policy that if anyone has
an unproductive response to some
thing that happens in practice, we
do self-enforced running. This gets
our attitude where we want it to be
going into tournament."
As the 12th seed, the Cardinal
(16-4, 8-2 Pac-12) won't have an
easy pass to the finals. It hopes to
deliver an upset just as it did when
it last won the NCAA Champi
onships in 2010 as the No. 8 seed.

The NCAA draw includes 64
teams and the first rounds are
played at various campuses around
the country. Stanford will host Mia
mi (13-12, 7-1 Mountain Athletic
Conference) in the first round. If it
successfully disposes of the Red-
Hawks on Friday, the Cardinal will

take on the winner of Rice (20-4, 2-
1 Conference USA) and Pepperdine
(12-11) on Saturday.
Gibbs anticipates Miami to be a
formidable opponent, considering
that the Red Hawks won the MAC
Championship Tournament 4-3
over Bowling Green. This will be Mi
ami's third NCAA appearance, the
last being in 2010. Of the three ten
nis programs, the Cardinal is really
only familiar with Pepperdine, who it
beat in a 5-2 match in February.
"They're a really gritty team,
and definitely not a walk-through,"
Gibbs said of Pepperdine. "We
know a little bit about Rice. They're
probably a bit deeper than Pepper
dine is, but it's kind of a shot in the
dark."

If the Cardinal makes it out of
the regional this weekend, it would
potentially come up against USC,
who it lost to 6-1 in March, in the
Sweet 16.

"USC is one of my personal top
picks in terms of its level of play go
ing into the postseason," Gibbs
said. "Florida is consistently tough,
and Georgia is playing really well
this year. Those are the teams we
are most weary of but also most ex
cited to potentially play in tourna
ment."

Gibbs, fellow junior co-captain
Rristie Aim, junior Amelia Her
ring, senior Stacey Tan, senior co
captain Natalie Dillon and sopho
more Ellen Tsay have all experi
enced NCAA play before. Stan
ford's two rookies, freshman Rrista
Hardebeck and freshman Lindsey
Kostas, will witness their first colle

giate postseason.
"My advice to them is to be
aware that anything can happen
when it comes to NCAAs," Gibbs
said. "A lot of players don't find
their best tennis at NCAAs. It's
about being grittier and tougher
than the team you're playing.
They're so tough and have been do
ing so well, but their best tennis
may not come. It's about who fights
harder."

Gibbs recalled playing Florida's
Sofie Oyen at the No. 3 spot her
freshman year.

"She had kind of a non-stellar
regular season, but she was some
one who I felt threatened by. We
had a really competitive match and
I was really nervous. Learning to
navigate nerves is critical to suc
cess," Gibbs said.
Gibbs clearly drew on her fresh
man year experience in her sopho
more year postseason run, winning
both the NCAA singles and doubles
tournaments with then-partner
Mallory Burdette. She hopes to re
peat that this year but isn't the on
ly Cardinal representative looking
to snatch an individual title. Ahn
and Hardebeck will also make ap
pearances in the 64-player NCAA
singles draw. The duo of Gibbs and
Ahn and the pairing of Tsay and
Tan are seeded in the 32-team dou
bles draw as well.

The Cardinal will play Miami
this Friday at 2 p.m. at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium.

nis programs, the Cardinal is really
only familiar with Pepperdine, who it
beat in a 5-2 match in February.
"They're a really gritty team,
and definitely not a walk-through,"
Gibbs said of Pepperdine. "We
know a little bit about Rice. They're
probably a bit deeper than Pepper
dine is, but it's kind of a shot in the
dark."

If the Cardinal makes it out of
the regional this weekend, it would
potentially come up against USC,
who it lost to 6-1 in March, in the
Sweet 16.

"USC is one of my personal top
picks in terms of its level of play go
ing into the postseason," Gibbs
said. "Florida is consistently tough,
and Georgia is playing really well
this year. Those are the teams we
are most weary of but also most ex
cited to potentially play in tourna
ment."

Gibbs, fellow junior co-captain
Rristie Aim, junior Amelia Her
ring, senior Stacey Tan, senior co
captain Natalie Dillon and sopho
more Ellen Tsay have all experi
enced NCAA play before. Stan
ford's two rookies, freshman Rrista
Hardebeck and freshman Lindsey
Kostas, will witness their first colle

giate postseason.
"My advice to them is to be
aware that anything can happen
when it comes to NCAAs," Gibbs
said. "A lot of players don't find
their best tennis at NCAAs. It's
about being grittier and tougher
than the team you're playing.
They're so tough and have been do
ing so well, but their best tennis
may not come. It's about who fights
harder."

Gibbs recalled playing Florida's
Sofie Oyen at the No. 3 spot her
freshman year.

"She had kind of a non-stellar
regular season, but she was some
one who I felt threatened by. We
had a really competitive match and
I was really nervous. Learning to
navigate nerves is critical to suc
cess," Gibbs said.
Gibbs clearly drew on her fresh
man year experience in her sopho
more year postseason run, winning
both the NCAA singles and doubles
tournaments with then-partner
Mallory Burdette. She hopes to re
peat that this year but isn't the on
ly Cardinal representative looking
to snatch an individual title. Ahn
and Hardebeck will also make ap
pearances in the 64-player NCAA
singles draw. The duo of Gibbs and
Ahn and the pairing of Tsay and
Tan are seeded in the 32-team dou
bles draw as well.

The Cardinal will play Miami
this Friday at 2 p.m. at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium.

Junior Nicole Gibbs (above) arrived on the Farm just one year after the Cardinal made a surprise run for
the NCAA title in 2010. Now as the team's singles No. 1, she will lead the 12th-seed Card this postseason.
