# Q&A DANIEL HARTWIG
## UNIVERSITY ARCHIVIST 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While Stanford's students and faculty members frequently
win acclaim for their contributions to the intellectual community,
the behind-the-scenes work of University archivist Daniel
Hartwig may be just as noteworthy and valuable. The Daily sat
down with Hartwig to discuss the most challenging aspects of
conservation, entrepreneurship in the library and his love for
19th-century photography
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can you tell us a little bit about
your background? How did you first get involved in the field
of library science?
Daniel Hartwig (DH): I grew up in lowa, and I did my under
graduate [studies] at the University of lowa. I double majored in
history and philosophy At the time, I wasn't quite sure what I
wanted to do professionally, but I was somewhat interested in
teaching history. I also had an interest in science so I went to the
University of Indiana, Bloomington, and then got master's [de
grees] in history and the philosophy of science.
On the history side of things, I worked in the Lilly Library [at
the University of Indiana] and did a lot of research with primary
resources, [or] historic documents. I loved the archives there and
I loved the work, and I thought there might be some type of ca-

reer in that.
I then went to library
school at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison, and
worked at the Wisconsin His
torical Society for two years.
So that was how I got started
and that's how I fell in love
with archives and the work
that we do.
TSD: Why did you decide to
make the transition to Stan
ford?
DH: Throughout my ca
reer and with most archival
positions these days, the em
phasis is on technology transi
tioning from a primary analog
world — paper-based docu
ments—to a digital world. I
had a lot of web design experi
ence, did a lot of digitalization,
did a lot of computer applica
tions at my time at Yale, and
given Stanford's innovative
ways and various projects in
terms of digital libraries, there
was a real need to move the
archives from an analog to a
digital environment, so that
was my foot in the door so to
speak.
TSD: How has technology
changed the culture of
archiving?
DH: [This change has] rad
ically uprooted the traditional
skillset for [an] archivist, just
as with any professional track
or education the things that
you learn 20 years ago are ob
solete now.
Digital preservation is per
haps the most pressing issue.
We [used to be able to] put
things in a box or in a cold, dry
dark room and they'd be good
for 500 years... well we can't
do that with computer files.
You really have to curate the
things over time... and be
much more aware in terms of
technology.
TSD: What is your favorite
part about your position at
Stanford?
DH: When I interviewed, I
heard the word entrepreneur
ial maybe 20 times, so coming
from Yale it was a different en
vironment. I thought, "what is
entrepreneurial?" Whenever I
talk with people and try to ex
plain what's different about
Stanford, it is that word
"entrepreneurial."
[I think entrepreneurship
is] understanding and enjoy
ing change, innovation, cre
ativity and flexibility being
agile. You have your responsi
bilities, or your mission, but
you have full flexibility and
freedom to implement that in
the way you see fit... That's
what I love and that's what
makes the job most exciting.
It's the totality of what we do
that we enjoy, which is really
collecting a lot of things not
just to collect but to make
them used... in research,
teaching, learning, documen
taries, exhibits. It's seeing at
the end of the day how re
sources are used that might be
the most fulfilling aspect of
what we do.

TSD: Can you describe an in
stance in your work with the
archives during which you
employed this entrepreneur
ial spirit?
DH: When I came here, we
maybe only had 100 of our col
lections with online descrip
tions. Now, almost all of our
200 collections do. So, it's
transforming our online pres
ence, in terms of the descrip
tion about our collections and

online access. I think over 200
of our collections are now
available online and those 200
collections ... include hun
dreds of thousands of images
and videos.

TSD: What are some of your
favorite items in the Stan
ford archives?

DH: I have a fondness [for]
and a bit of a background in
photography architecture, and
design. My favorites would in
clude Eadweard Muybridge
photographs. He did motion
experiments [with Leland
Stanford] and was one of the
innovators in cinema and
movies. His photographs are
amazing.
We also have the Hanna
House collections the
Frank Lloyd Wright house on
campus. We have blueprints,
architectural designs, a few
sketches of Wright and a lot of
photographs. We also have a
print collection, which includes
some of the original prints and
campus plan by [architect]
Frederick Law Olmsted.

TSD: Where are the univer
sity's artifacts stored?
DH: More often than not,
we'll provide item-level conser
vation so we'll put them in a
Mylar sleeve and then put
them in acid-free folders and
boxes, and [finally] put them in
our climate-controlled envi
ronment.

For digital files, there are
several levels. One is having an
open and well-understood file
format; for images the format
of choice is a TIFF file
they're non-compressed, open,
and will last for quite a while.
For audio it's a WAV file, and
for motion pictures it's some
type of motion JPEG 2000.
[We have to] convert those for
mats, get them into the Stan
ford Digital Repository and
make sure all of the bits are
transferred and backed up in
the process.

TSD: How do you generate
the material that goes into
the archives? Where do all of
the artifacts come from?
DH: It's a bit of a combina
tion — sometimes people do
nate their materials to us. We
work with faculty to give [us]
their papers. But we also ana
lyze our holdings, so we're
very strong in science and en
gineering, physics, chemistry,
to some extent psychology, but
[we don't have as much] in...

mathematics, economics [and]
ait.

A third area is student or
ganizations and student
groups. Students are here for
a short period of time. They're
very busy —they don't always
create materials that last.

TSD: How do you determine
what is worthy of being
archived?

DH: More often than not,
there really isn't [a] choice. It's
'does it speak to Stanford's his
tory?' If so, then yes. If we al
ready have similar materials,
it's 'what story does this tell
that isn't already told?' or sup
plements what we already
have. We are very fortunate
that we have adequate space
so that we don't have to say
'no' a lot. In terms of student
groups, it's the high-level deci
sion making materials that are
most valuable so that when fu
ture students are doing re
search they can see what those
students [in the past] were
thinking.
