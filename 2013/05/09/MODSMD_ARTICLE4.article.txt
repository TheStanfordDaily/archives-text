# Students seek housing online
## Location, cost of campus housing prompts broader search 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students seeking off-campus hous
ing for this summer have become in
creasingly reliant on social networks
and other online tools as a means of
dealing with high price ranges and
keeping in touch with other students in
the area.
According to surveyed students, In
ternet searches mainly through
Craigslist and Facebook provide the
most widely used resources for those
looking to rent or sublet accommoda

tions.
Heidi Thorsen 'l2, who currently
lives in a four-bedroom apartment with
three other Stanford alumni in San
Francisco's Ingleside district, said that
she will sublet her room for the sum
mer, having advertised solely through
Facebook.

"I didn't have that much interest,
but the interest I did have ended up
materializing," Thorsen said.
While Facebook proved to be a suc
cessful tool for Thorsen, Shubham Goel
'l6 expressed doubts about the utility of
Facebook groups like Stanford Summer

in San Francisco 2013, which has 95
members to-date.

"In general, it's a good strategy to
look for people interested in living to
gether," Goel said. "When people have
different work locations and different
budgets, then it gets more complicat
ed."

Justin Wiguna 'l5, who will work at
a start-up near Union Square this sum
mer, said he joined the Facebook group
more to connect with other students for
social events, since most students seek
housing with friend groups.
He observed that a Facebook
group including Stanford alumni in
the Bay Area would make for a
more helpful tool.
Narjis Sarehane 'l5, who will
work at Houlihan Lokey in San
Francisco's Financial District, said
that she is still searching for accom
modations and has relied primarily
on alumni connections in doing so.
"I have a couple of my friends
who are also interning in San Fran
cisco, and who know alumni who
will be subletting their apart
ments," Sarehane said. "They can
put me in contact with these peo
ple."
Price Ranges
Housing options' pricing can al
so narrow down choices for stu
dents seeking to avoid the summer
rates levied on-campus housing,
which start at $1,761 for an eight
week contract.
Students still interested in
staying on campus may seek some
form of financial aid. Since no
scholarship funds are allocated
strictly for the summer, such aid
would normally come through
loans or work-study eligibility. Ex
ceptions would include students
who missed a quarter during the
academic year or who need one
more quarter to graduate.
"Generally at this point of the
year we've spent all our scholarship
money and don't have a lot of funds
available for summer," noted Karen
Cooper, director of financial aid.
In cases where financial aid is
awarded, the packages are based
on the full cost of attendance re
gardless of whether the student
will be living on- or off-campus.
Cooper encouraged students to ap
ply as soon as possible for summer
financial aid, which has no strict
deadline.
"If [students] think they're go
ing to need financial aid to help
them with their summer expenses,
now is a good time to apply," Coop
er said.
Thorsen, on the other hand,
suggested that those looking main
ly for off-campus accommodations
be ready to look for last-minute
openings.
"When people sublet, they want
to get rid of their room last-minute
... you can't really plan ahead for it,"
Thorsen said. "You have to keep
looking out and stay in touch."
Extra Factors
For students living off-campus,
other pieces of housing arrange
ments such as leasing contracts,
transportation and homeowner
rules can be complex.
"There are so many things be
tween both parties [students and
landlords] that need to be figured
out, and a lot of time has to be
spent doing that," Goel said. "As a
student, you don't have lots of
time."

Thorsen emphasized the impor
tance of keeping an open mind and
being flexible.
"If you look at Craigslist, there
are a lot of middle-aged people
who tend to lease out a room,"
Thorsen said. "They tend to be a
lot more restrictive in terms of
what you can do [and] people you
can have over, but it's a really
great option and it's probably the
least expensive thing."
