# STUDENT LIFE
## Campus groups campaign for sexual consent 
### SAMANTHA NEUBER 
A group of student organizations and
University offices have collaborated on a
campus-wide campaign to educate the
University community on issues sur
rounding sexual consent.
The student-initiated campaign
led by the Women's Community Center
(WCC), Men Against Abuse Now
(MAAN), the Office of Sexual Assault
and Relationship Abuse (SARA) and Sig

ma Theta Psi Multicultural Sorority
was launched at the start of this quarter
to facilitate an active discourse on the
subject, according to MAAN Co-Presi
dent Jake Winkelman 'l5.
"The idea behind it was that there are
conversations had about sexual assault
on campus but there isn't always space
for discourse just about consent, or hav
ing a more positive constructive conver
sation about consent," Winkelman said.
To date, the campaign has mainly con

sisted of a brief emailed survey that asks
what it means to give consent, and what
it means to ask for it.
Surabhi Nirkhe 'l3, social justice out
reach coordinator at the WCC, said the
survey has received 40 to 50 responses
for each question.
"We've been getting a diverse range
of responses," Nirkhe said. "Initially
[there were] a lot of responses that I
guess you could say we sup
port based on the stance of
the Women's Community
Center and MAAN has on
the issue."

Responses are subse
quently uploaded to a Word-
Press site, where students
can read and comment on
posted responses as well as
add their own perspectives
on consent.

"By asking students how
they give consent, how they
ask for it, it really encour
ages them to think critically
about how they engage with
consent and sexuality," said
Sarah Roberts 'l6, a WCC
staffer.

Angela Exson, director
of the SARA office, pointed
out that survey responses
might have applications be
yond simply encouraging
student discourse and re
flection, through allowing
staff and administrators to
assess progress and deter
mine areas for improvement
in dealing with consent-re
lated issues.
"If we don't have this
common understanding or
common ground around
what consent is and what it
entails, then it makes it
more difficult for us to un
derstand when boundaries
are being crossed," Exson
said.

In the future, campaign
ers hope to add more con
tent and interactive materi
al to the website in addition
to hosting some events.
"Hopefully this is the
spark that starts the conver
sation, and we'd like to do
more forms of outreach later
on," Nirkhe said.
