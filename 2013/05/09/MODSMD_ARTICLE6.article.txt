# SENIORS' SAGA
## RICH, HASSMAN REFLECT ON INJURIES, RECORD-SETTING PERFORMANCES 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
The members of Stanford's
softball class of 2013, in con
trast to previous senior class
es, have described them
selves as not being the most
vocal group of team leaders. Instead, the
four seniors have relied upon then- per
formance on the field to set the example
for the rest of their teammates.
In Part II of this feature story detail
ing the journeys of Softball's four senior
student-athletes, The Daily will profile
the record-setting accomplishments of
Jenna Rich and Sarah Hassman, while
describing the positive impact that Rich
and Hassman's "lead-by-example" style
has had on their fellow softball players.
Jenna Rich: calm leader
The first quality that Rich's team
mates consistently mention when talk
ing about the third-team NFCA Ail-
American is her calm demeanor, regard
less of her own personal success or fail
ure on that particular day.

"She doesn't wear her emotion on her
sleeve at all," Hassman said. "I think
what makes her such a good player is
that you can't tell if she has had a good
day or a bad day. She has the same look
on her face all the time."
Senior Tegan Schmidt echoed the
sentiments of Hassman while express
ing her admiration for Rich.
"[When] I am asked who my role
model is in terms of softball, I always
say Jenna Rich," Schmidt said. "Obvi
ously, she is one of the most amazing ath
letes because her numbers show that.
However, her demeanor and how she
carries herself is one of the greatest
things ever. I never really had an
Olympic player as a role model [growing
up], so coming here and seeing her play,
she is definitely my role model."
On the field, Rich has accomplished
almost everything that can be achieved
in a college softball career. In particular,
she recently passed Sarah Beeson 'O2 to
become Stanford's all-time career leader
in RBI. In addition, Rich is second in
program history in home runs behind
Olympic icon Jessica Mendoza 'O2. Along
the way, Rich has twice been named to

the NFCA All-West Region
First Team to supplement
her Ail-American honor.

Last year as a junior, Rich
posted one of the finest sea-

sons in recent program history. Unde
terred by a shoulder injury that made it
difficult for her to play in the field, Rich
hit .368 with 11 home runs and 66 RBI,
which tied a Stanford single-season
record for the most runs batted in.
Her .665 slugging percentage and 53
runs scored also rank in the school's
top 10 for single-season totals in
their respective categories.
Under head coach John Rittman,
however, Rich has learned that her
experience on the Farm is about
more than just setting personal
records.
