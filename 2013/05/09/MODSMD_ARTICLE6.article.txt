# SENIORS' SAGA
## RICH, HASSMAN REFLECT ON INJURIES, RECORD-SETTING PERFORMANCES 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
The members of Stanford's
softball class of 2013, in con
trast to previous senior class
es, have described them
selves as not being the most
vocal group of team leaders. Instead, the
four seniors have relied upon then- per
formance on the field to set the example
for the rest of their teammates.
In Part II of this feature story detail
ing the journeys of Softball's four senior
student-athletes, The Daily will profile
the record-setting accomplishments of
Jenna Rich and Sarah Hassman, while
describing the positive impact that Rich
and Hassman's "lead-by-example" style
has had on their fellow softball players.
Jenna Rich: calm leader
The first quality that Rich's team
mates consistently mention when talk
ing about the third-team NFCA Ail-
American is her calm demeanor, regard
less of her own personal success or fail
ure on that particular day.

"She doesn't wear her emotion on her
sleeve at all," Hassman said. "I think
what makes her such a good player is
that you can't tell if she has had a good
day or a bad day. She has the same look
on her face all the time."
Senior Tegan Schmidt echoed the
sentiments of Hassman while express
ing her admiration for Rich.
"[When] I am asked who my role
model is in terms of softball, I always
say Jenna Rich," Schmidt said. "Obvi
ously, she is one of the most amazing ath
letes because her numbers show that.
However, her demeanor and how she
carries herself is one of the greatest
things ever. I never really had an
Olympic player as a role model [growing
up], so coming here and seeing her play,
she is definitely my role model."
On the field, Rich has accomplished
almost everything that can be achieved
in a college softball career. In particular,
she recently passed Sarah Beeson 'O2 to
become Stanford's all-time career leader
in RBI. In addition, Rich is second in
program history in home runs behind
Olympic icon Jessica Mendoza 'O2. Along
the way, Rich has twice been named to

the NFCA All-West Region
First Team to supplement
her Ail-American honor.

Last year as a junior, Rich
posted one of the finest sea-

sons in recent program history. Unde
terred by a shoulder injury that made it
difficult for her to play in the field, Rich
hit .368 with 11 home runs and 66 RBI,
which tied a Stanford single-season
record for the most runs batted in.
Her .665 slugging percentage and 53
runs scored also rank in the school's
top 10 for single-season totals in
their respective categories.
Under head coach John Rittman,
however, Rich has learned that her
experience on the Farm is about
more than just setting personal
records.

The leading base-stealer in school history, senior Sarah
Hassman (right) is known as a silent leader for the
Cardinal, which begins play against Arizona tonight.
"Our coach emphasizes how you are never
going to get the opportunity again to work
with a group of people who are working to
ward the same goal," she said. "I never really
considered that until [coach Rittman] brought
it up. It's true. Once you get into the real
world, you don't really have that type of team
environment where you are all working to
ward one goal."
"I have always considered myself a team
player," she added, "but I feel like our coaches
definitely engrain that in our minds."
Sarah Hassman: 'super' senior
Lovingly referred to as the "super" senior
in honor of the five years that she has spent in
the program, Hassman is known among her
teammates for her great advice. Softball alum
Jenna Becerra 'l2 M.A. 'l3 called her "one of
the hardest workers I know."
"She is more of a silent leader," Becerra
added, "but her example speaks for itself. She
is a very selfless person, as she is all about her
teammates both on and off the field. It is not
just a cliche. I still see the girls a lot of times
over talking to Hass[man] about their lives."
Hassman has had a distinguished career in
a Cardinal uniform, as the Cupertino, Calif.,
product has one of the highest career batting
averages in program history at .294. Hassman
is also Stanford's all-time record holder in
stolen bases, as the speedster has stolen 99
bags in her career. In setting this stolen base
record, Hassman passed all-time great Jessi
ca Mendoza earlier this season.
Hassman produced a standout season in
2011, batting .398 and driving in 15 RBI while
stealing 35 bases to set a Stanford single-sea
son record. Her batting average from that
season also currently stands ninth among the
single-season totals for the program. In recog
nition of her outstanding campaign and her

performance in the classroom as a Human Bi
ology major, Hassman earned NFCA All-West
First Team honors and was selected as a NF
CA All-America Scholar-Athlete.
After having her most successful year in
2011, Hassman suffered a devastating ACL

tear 11 games into the 2012 season that forced
her to postpone her senior campaign. Howev
er, Hassman has not allowed her injury to dic
tate her final year on the Farm; the center
fielder has started in all 53 contests for the
Card in 2013 while posting a career-high 19

RBI. Hassman also once again leads her team
in stolen bases, stealing 17 bags on 19 at
tempts.
When asked what would be the main take
away from her five years at Stanford, Hass
man cited the one quality that has become the
defining feature of this softball class of 2013:
perseverance.
"[To] never give up," she said. "To never
have that doubt in your mind that someone
else is going to beat you. There are so many
times in softball [when you face] so many dif
ferent negativities that you can crowd your
mind with, and just crash and burn from
there. However, if you stay more toward the
positive side, if you put in the time, if you put
in the effort, if you put in the hard work, if you
have the passion for it [softball], anything can
happen."
'This is what we work for'
As the 2013 regular season winds down,
Stanford's four seniors remain focused on the
perennial goal of the program: reaching
Oklahoma City and the Women's College
World Series. Rich, Gerhart, Schmidt, and
Hassman all know that if this team plays to
its potential in the upcoming NCAA Tourna
ment, the World Series will be within reach.
"We know this our last shot at going to
the World Series, so we are really hoping to
persevere," Rich said. "That is the main ob
jective."
To that end, they will continue to provide
the steady leadership that the rest of the
team has come to expect from them. And
maybe, with collective and continued dedica
tion and focus, and perhaps bit of luck, the
class of 2013's dream will become a reality.

become Stanford's all-time career leader
in RBI. In addition, Rich is second in
program history in home runs behind
Olympic icon Jessica Mendoza 'O2. Along
the way, Rich has twice been named to

the NFCA All-West Region
First Team to supplement
her Ail-American honor.

Last year as a junior, Rich
posted one of the finest sea-

sons in recent program history. Unde
terred by a shoulder injury that made it
difficult for her to play in the field, Rich
hit .368 with 11 home runs and 66 RBI,
which tied a Stanford single-season
record for the most runs batted in.
Her .665 slugging percentage and 53
runs scored also rank in the school's
top 10 for single-season totals in
their respective categories.
Under head coach John Rittman,
however, Rich has learned that her
experience on the Farm is about
more than just setting personal
records.

The leading base-stealer in school history, senior Sarah
Hassman (right) is known as a silent leader for the
Cardinal, which begins play against Arizona tonight.
"Our coach emphasizes how you are never
going to get the opportunity again to work
with a group of people who are working to
ward the same goal," she said. "I never really
considered that until [coach Rittman] brought
it up. It's true. Once you get into the real
world, you don't really have that type of team
environment where you are all working to
ward one goal."
"I have always considered myself a team
player," she added, "but I feel like our coaches
definitely engrain that in our minds."
Sarah Hassman: 'super' senior
Lovingly referred to as the "super" senior
in honor of the five years that she has spent in
the program, Hassman is known among her
teammates for her great advice. Softball alum
Jenna Becerra 'l2 M.A. 'l3 called her "one of
the hardest workers I know."
"She is more of a silent leader," Becerra
added, "but her example speaks for itself. She
is a very selfless person, as she is all about her
teammates both on and off the field. It is not
just a cliche. I still see the girls a lot of times
over talking to Hass[man] about their lives."
Hassman has had a distinguished career in
a Cardinal uniform, as the Cupertino, Calif.,
product has one of the highest career batting
averages in program history at .294. Hassman
is also Stanford's all-time record holder in
stolen bases, as the speedster has stolen 99
bags in her career. In setting this stolen base
record, Hassman passed all-time great Jessi
ca Mendoza earlier this season.
Hassman produced a standout season in
2011, batting .398 and driving in 15 RBI while
stealing 35 bases to set a Stanford single-sea
son record. Her batting average from that
season also currently stands ninth among the
single-season totals for the program. In recog
nition of her outstanding campaign and her

performance in the classroom as a Human Bi
ology major, Hassman earned NFCA All-West
First Team honors and was selected as a NF
CA All-America Scholar-Athlete.
After having her most successful year in
2011, Hassman suffered a devastating ACL

tear 11 games into the 2012 season that forced
her to postpone her senior campaign. Howev
er, Hassman has not allowed her injury to dic
tate her final year on the Farm; the center
fielder has started in all 53 contests for the
Card in 2013 while posting a career-high 19

RBI. Hassman also once again leads her team
in stolen bases, stealing 17 bags on 19 at
tempts.
When asked what would be the main take
away from her five years at Stanford, Hass
man cited the one quality that has become the
defining feature of this softball class of 2013:
perseverance.
"[To] never give up," she said. "To never
have that doubt in your mind that someone
else is going to beat you. There are so many
times in softball [when you face] so many dif
ferent negativities that you can crowd your
mind with, and just crash and burn from
there. However, if you stay more toward the
positive side, if you put in the time, if you put
in the effort, if you put in the hard work, if you
have the passion for it [softball], anything can
happen."
'This is what we work for'
As the 2013 regular season winds down,
Stanford's four seniors remain focused on the
perennial goal of the program: reaching
Oklahoma City and the Women's College
World Series. Rich, Gerhart, Schmidt, and
Hassman all know that if this team plays to
its potential in the upcoming NCAA Tourna
ment, the World Series will be within reach.
"We know this our last shot at going to
the World Series, so we are really hoping to
persevere," Rich said. "That is the main ob
jective."
To that end, they will continue to provide
the steady leadership that the rest of the
team has come to expect from them. And
maybe, with collective and continued dedica
tion and focus, and perhaps bit of luck, the
class of 2013's dream will become a reality.

Senior Jenna Rich (above) has knocked in more runs than any other Softball player in
Stanford history and has been named to the NFCA All-West Region First Team twice.
The members of Stanford's
softball class of 2013, in con
trast to previous senior class
es, have described them
selves as not being the most
vocal group of team leaders. Instead, the
four seniors have relied upon then- per
formance on the field to set the example
for the rest of their teammates.
In Part II of this feature story detail
ing the journeys of Softball's four senior
student-athletes, The Daily will profile
the record-setting accomplishments of
Jenna Rich and Sarah Hassman, while
describing the positive impact that Rich
and Hassman's "lead-by-example" style
has had on their fellow softball players.
Jenna Rich: calm leader
The first quality that Rich's team
mates consistently mention when talk
ing about the third-team NFCA Ail-
American is her calm demeanor, regard
less of her own personal success or fail
ure on that particular day.

"She doesn't wear her emotion on her
sleeve at all," Hassman said. "I think
what makes her such a good player is
that you can't tell if she has had a good
day or a bad day. She has the same look
on her face all the time."
Senior Tegan Schmidt echoed the
sentiments of Hassman while express
ing her admiration for Rich.
"[When] I am asked who my role
model is in terms of softball, I always
say Jenna Rich," Schmidt said. "Obvi
ously, she is one of the most amazing ath
letes because her numbers show that.
However, her demeanor and how she
carries herself is one of the greatest
things ever. I never really had an
Olympic player as a role model [growing
up], so coming here and seeing her play,
she is definitely my role model."
On the field, Rich has accomplished
almost everything that can be achieved
in a college softball career. In particular,
she recently passed Sarah Beeson 'O2 to
become Stanford's all-time career leader
in RBI. In addition, Rich is second in
program history in home runs behind
Olympic icon Jessica Mendoza 'O2. Along
the way, Rich has twice been named to

the NFCA All-West Region
First Team to supplement
