## WILL IT BE THREE? CARD SEEKS THIRD STRAIGHT NCAA TITLE 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
In 2011 and 2012, the Stanford women's wa
ter polo team responded from losses in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
Tournament to storm though the NCAA Tour
nament and seize the national title. After losing

in the MPSF final two weeks ago, the No. 2
Cardinal (27-2) hopes to continue that streak
and take a third straight national championship
in this year's tournament, which kicks off
tonight in Boston.
This is the 13th straight appearance in the
National Collegiate Championship for the Car
dinal. It has reached the national title game in
eight of the past 12 years and has never finished
worse than third at the tournament.
Stanford faces No. 7 lona in the tournamen
t's first round. In 2011, the two teams also met

in the quarterfinals with the Cardinal coming
away with a 22-7 win.
Stanford head coach John Tanner noted that
lona, the Metro Athletic Athletic Conference
champion, plays a "wide-open and fast-paced
style" and has done well in high-scoring games,
but he also said he doubted that the Gaels had
the depth to match up with his squad.
Instead, Tanner said his team was focused
on a likely matchup with UCLA in Saturday's

semifinal. This would be the third
matchup between the California ri
vals this season. Stanford followed
up an 8-1 regular season victory
with an 11-7 win over the Bruins on
April 27 in the MPSF semifinals.
Tanner said that starting fast
would be key for his team in all
games.
"We've played well defensively
but haven't gotten ourselves ready
on offense when the whistle blows,"
Tanner said. "We have to be pre
pared to start at 7 and not at 7:15."
If the Cardinal can makes it to
the finals, it could face No. 1 USC
for the fourth time this season.
Last year, Stanford beat USC 6-4
in the NCAA Tournament. This
season, the two teams have been

ranked No. 1 and No. 2 all year
neither Stanford nor USC has lost
to another team.
After both squads took a victory
during the regular season, the
Women of Troy won the MPSF
Championship with an 11-7 win in
the final.
"It's disappointing that we did
n't play better [in the MPSF]," said
Tanner said. "We had some lapses.
We aren't really going to change
much, but we are focused on being
more consistent and sharp on of
fense and defense."
Regardless of the opponent,
Stanford has the firepower to score
goals in bunches. The Cardinal has
averaged an MPSF-leading 13.03
goals per game.
On Thursday, Stanford players
junior Annika Dries, senior Melissa
Seidemann and freshman Maggie
Steffens were all named as finalists
for the Peter J. Cutino Award which
is given annually to the top collegiate

water polo player. USC's Monica
Vavic was the fourth player nominat
ed.
In 2011, Dries won the award,
and Seidemann was named a finalist
the same year. Stanford sophomore
Kiley Neushul won the award last
year.
In goal, Kate Baldoni will try to
cap off her senior season with anoth
er national title. Last season, Bal
doni was named NCAA Tournament
MVP after a standout performance
throughout the championship.
Stanford's opening-round match
will begin at 10:45 a.m. PST. A po
tential semifinal would begin at 4
p.m. PST on Saturday with the final
at 2:15 p.m. PST on Sunday.
"It's great being out in Boston
and playing at Harvard," Tanner
said. "We're really excited to start
playing."
