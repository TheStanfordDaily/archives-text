## Stanford attempts first NCAA tourney win 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
For Stanford women's lacrosse, the sea
son opened with a loss to Notre Dame. Now,
the team must fight to ensure its season
doesn't end the same way.
The No. 20 Cardinal (13-5, 8-2 MPSF)
faces the No. 9 Fighting Irish (12-4, 5-3 Big
East) in the opening round of the NCAA
Tournament this Friday in Evanston, 111. On
Feb. 16, Stanford jumped out to a 7-2 half
time lead only to see the Fighting Irish roar
back in the second half to take a 12-10 victo
ry.
Stanford has previously appeared in the
NCAA three times but has never advanced
past the first round. In its last appearance in
2011, the Cardinal was eliminated with a 13-
11 loss to Florida in the opening round. The
Cardinal will look to reverse that trend
against a Notre Dame team making its eighth
NCAA appearance.
Despite the tough competition, the Cardi

GAME NOTES: Stanford seeks its first ever NCAA Tour
nament win in a rematch against No. 9 Notre
Dame, which came back to defeat the Cardinal 12-
10 on Feb. 16. The winner of the first round
matchup will face No. 2 Northwestern on Sunday.

goalkeeper Lyndsey Munoz said her team
was "really excited" when it saw the draw.
"A lot of people might be surprised at that
since they are obviously one of the best teams
in the country," Munoz said. "But after our
first game being up by so much at halftime
and allowing them to come back in the second
half—we all really want to get to redo that."
The Fighting Irish have a first-team all-

Big East selection in every zone of the field.
Senior attacker Jenny Granger posted 31
goals and 22 assists this season to lead
Notre Dame's offense, while fellow first
team selection junior midfielder Margaret
Smith contributed in all areas with 14 goals,
35 ground balls and 35 draw controls.
Sophomore defender Barbara Sullivan,
who was also one of 25 players nominated
for the Tewaaraton Trophy, picked up 49
ground balls this season for the seventh-best
per-game average in the nation. She also
made the top 10 in caused turnovers per
game (2.00) and top 25 in draw controls per
game (3.88).
In goal, Fighting Irish senior Ellie Hilling
anchored a top-20 defense that allowed just
8.75 goals per game. Hilling posted a .467
save percentage while making 7.2 saves per
game this season.
Stanford will use the momentum built
through its run to the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) championship
last weekend. The Cardinal earned an auto
matic berth in the NCAA Tournament by
handily defeating Cal in the semifinals and
knocking off top-seeded Denver 7-6 in the
MPSF final.
"We peaked the right time and played two
really good games against two good teams,"
said sophomore Hannah Farr. "The offense
played really well and we want to continue
that."
One key for the Cardinal will be remain
ing poised on both offense and defense.
Munoz noted that Stanford gave away just
three free-position opportunities for its oppo
nents in the two-game tournament.
"Our defense was controlled, and there
were very few fouls," Munoz said. "That was
great because before, we had kind of gotten
away from that and were becoming more
undisciplined."
Munoz said that Stanford's defense will be
watching out for Notre Dame's quick feeds,

as the Fighting Irish have a tendency to send
passes into players cutting to the goal even if
they are only slightly open.
On offense, coach Amy Bokker wants her
team to continue with the sharp ball control
and lack of turnovers that it displayed in the
MPSF Tournament. Bokker also said that
the team's ability to shoot and finish effective
ly will be key for the Card to advance.
Fan* has been on a tear as of late, tallying
six goals and one assist in the MPSF Tourna
ment to take Most Outstanding Player honors.
Junior attacker Rachel Ozer also had seven
points on three goals and four assists over the
two games. Ozer was recently named to the
Intercollegiate Women's Lacrosse Coaches
Association (IWLCA) all-region second team
after leading the Cardinal in scoring (47 goals,
22 assists) and recording a goal in 17 of 18
games this season.
Junior captain Anna Kim, who was also
named to the IWLCA all-region second team,
is second on the team in the points (31 goals, 11
assists) and draw controls (53). Junior defend
er Megan Lerner set the school record with
59 draw controls this season.
Munoz said the team is taking confidence
from the way the Cardinal matched up with
the Fighting Irish in the first half of Febru
ary's meeting and is hoping to put together a
full game effort on Friday.
"The biggest thing is playing two halves
consistently and keeping up the positive en
ergy," Munoz said. "With the playoffs, the
next game is never guaranteed, so we have to
lay it all on the line and give everything we
have to come up with a win."
The winner of the first-round game will
face second-seeded Northwestern in the
second round on Sunday at 11 a.m. That
game would also be a rematch for the Car
dinal, who lost to the Wildcats 12-8 on April
14 in Evanston.
"We all want to take this program to fur
ther heights than it's ever gone," Munoz
said. "We want to finally get out of the first
round losses and make it to the second
round and hopefully keep going."

2011, the Cardinal was eliminated with a 13-

NOTRE DAME
(12-4)

5/10 Evanston, 111., 5 RM.

GAME NOTES: Stanford seeks its first ever NCAA Tour
nament win in a rematch against No. 9 Notre
Dame, which came back to defeat the Cardinal 12-
10 on Feb. 16. The winner of the first round
matchup will face No. 2 Northwestern on Sunday.

goalkeeper Lyndsey Munoz said her team
was "really excited" when it saw the draw.
"A lot of people might be surprised at that
since they are obviously one of the best teams
in the country," Munoz said. "But after our
first game being up by so much at halftime
and allowing them to come back in the second
half—we all really want to get to redo that."
The Fighting Irish have a first-team all-

Big East selection in every zone of the field.
Senior attacker Jenny Granger posted 31
goals and 22 assists this season to lead
Notre Dame's offense, while fellow first
team selection junior midfielder Margaret
Smith contributed in all areas with 14 goals,
35 ground balls and 35 draw controls.
Sophomore defender Barbara Sullivan,
who was also one of 25 players nominated
for the Tewaaraton Trophy, picked up 49
ground balls this season for the seventh-best
per-game average in the nation. She also
made the top 10 in caused turnovers per
game (2.00) and top 25 in draw controls per
game (3.88).
In goal, Fighting Irish senior Ellie Hilling
anchored a top-20 defense that allowed just
8.75 goals per game. Hilling posted a .467
save percentage while making 7.2 saves per
game this season.
Stanford will use the momentum built
through its run to the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) championship
last weekend. The Cardinal earned an auto
matic berth in the NCAA Tournament by
handily defeating Cal in the semifinals and
knocking off top-seeded Denver 7-6 in the
MPSF final.
"We peaked the right time and played two
really good games against two good teams,"
said sophomore Hannah Farr. "The offense
played really well and we want to continue
that."
One key for the Cardinal will be remain
ing poised on both offense and defense.
Munoz noted that Stanford gave away just
three free-position opportunities for its oppo
nents in the two-game tournament.
"Our defense was controlled, and there
were very few fouls," Munoz said. "That was
great because before, we had kind of gotten
away from that and were becoming more
undisciplined."
Munoz said that Stanford's defense will be
watching out for Notre Dame's quick feeds,

as the Fighting Irish have a tendency to send
passes into players cutting to the goal even if
they are only slightly open.
On offense, coach Amy Bokker wants her
team to continue with the sharp ball control
and lack of turnovers that it displayed in the
MPSF Tournament. Bokker also said that
the team's ability to shoot and finish effective
ly will be key for the Card to advance.
Fan* has been on a tear as of late, tallying
six goals and one assist in the MPSF Tourna
ment to take Most Outstanding Player honors.
Junior attacker Rachel Ozer also had seven
points on three goals and four assists over the
two games. Ozer was recently named to the
Intercollegiate Women's Lacrosse Coaches
Association (IWLCA) all-region second team
after leading the Cardinal in scoring (47 goals,
22 assists) and recording a goal in 17 of 18
games this season.
Junior captain Anna Kim, who was also
named to the IWLCA all-region second team,
is second on the team in the points (31 goals, 11
assists) and draw controls (53). Junior defend
er Megan Lerner set the school record with
59 draw controls this season.
Munoz said the team is taking confidence
from the way the Cardinal matched up with
the Fighting Irish in the first half of Febru
ary's meeting and is hoping to put together a
full game effort on Friday.
"The biggest thing is playing two halves
consistently and keeping up the positive en
ergy," Munoz said. "With the playoffs, the
next game is never guaranteed, so we have to
lay it all on the line and give everything we
have to come up with a win."
The winner of the first-round game will
face second-seeded Northwestern in the
second round on Sunday at 11 a.m. That
game would also be a rematch for the Car
dinal, who lost to the Wildcats 12-8 on April
14 in Evanston.
"We all want to take this program to fur
ther heights than it's ever gone," Munoz
said. "We want to finally get out of the first
round losses and make it to the second
round and hopefully keep going."
