# CARDINAL FACES PAC-12 LEADERS
## APPEL EYES CAREER STRIKEOUT RECORD 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Ace Mark Appel has an outside
chance to break Stanford's career
strikeout record tonight, but when
No. 5 Oregon State comes to the
Farm this weekend for the No. 21
Cardinal's toughest series of the
season, all eyes will be on the
Beavers' shutdown staff.
Oregon State (38-8,17-4 Pac-12)
boasts one of the best rotations in
the country, a group that has post
ed an impressively low 2.04 ERA,
good for second in Division I, and a
1.04 WHII? good for third. If Stan
ford (26-17,11-10) wants to make it
out of the series with a pair of wins
which would be a huge step to
wards punching a ticket to the
NCAA Tournament it will have
to be firing on all cylinders at the
plate against the Beavers, who cur
rently lead the conference stand
ings.
Almost out of nowhere, Oregon
State's three-man rotation of senior
lefty Matt Boyd (9-2) on Fridays,
freshman righty Andrew Moore (9-
1) on Saturdays and junior lefty
Ben Wetzler (5-1) on Sundays has
made a name for itself as one of the
most formidable staffs in college
baseball. Last summer, Boyd was a
career reliever and a 13th-round
draft pick and Moore hadn't played
a lick of college baseball. But that
duo has won nearly half of the
Beavers' games, and Moore pitched
his first career complete game, a
two-hitter, against Cal last week
end.

To make matters worse for the
Cardinal, Oregon State is coming
off consecutive conference sweeps
against USC and Cal in which it al
lowed just 10 total runs in six
games.
Stanford's bats heated up some
what in April after a slow start to
the season, but a lackluster three
run performance in a loss to San
Francisco on Tuesday looked like a
step in the wrong direction. In the
Cardinal's last two games (both
losses), it averaged 11 hits, so the
offense has been there —just not
always at the right time.
The Cardinal proved that it is
capable of playing giant-killer in its
series win against then-No. 16 Ari
zona State on the road, no less
last weekend. It beat the Sun
Devils by pulling off a 9-8 victory in
11 innings last Saturday despite 3.1
shaky innings by freshman Daniel
Starwalt, who was yanked after al
lowing four runs. Crucial relief
work by junior Sam Lindquist (4.1
innings, three hits), however,
helped send it to extras and allowed
Stanford to clinch the series.
So it's a perceived weakness of
the Cardinal its bullpen that
could make the difference this
weekend. Though Appel who
could set Stanford's career record
in strikeouts if he punches out 15
Beavers tonight, tying his best for a
single game and Boyd are ex
pected to pitch late into the night in
the opener, the Cardinal's starting
rotation is not nearly as reliable af
ter its senior righty. Without strong
pitching by its relievers, Stanford
will be hard-pressed to get out of
the weekend still in contention for a
postseason berth.
Oregon State, like the Cardinal,
is a middle-of-the-pack hitting team

with a couple of sluggers to watch
out for. Leftfielder Michael Confor
to, who led the Pac-12 in home runs
and RBI last season as a freshman,
has fallen back ever so slightly as a
sophomore but still leads the
Beavers with seven long flies.
Across from him in right field, fellow
sophomore Dylan Davis has more
doubles (17) than any other player
in the conference and leads his
team with 34 RBI.
Appel goes for the record
against those dangerous hitters
tonight at 6:30 p.m., with a 2 p.m.
first pitch slated for Saturday and a
1 p.m. Sunday start to follow.

Stanford's bats heated up some
what in April after a slow start to
the season, but a lackluster three
run performance in a loss to San
Francisco on Tuesday looked like a
step in the wrong direction. In the
Cardinal's last two games (both
losses), it averaged 11 hits, so the
offense has been there —just not
always at the right time.
The Cardinal proved that it is
capable of playing giant-killer in its
series win against then-No. 16 Ari
zona State on the road, no less
last weekend. It beat the Sun
Devils by pulling off a 9-8 victory in
11 innings last Saturday despite 3.1
shaky innings by freshman Daniel
Starwalt, who was yanked after al
lowing four runs. Crucial relief
work by junior Sam Lindquist (4.1
innings, three hits), however,
helped send it to extras and allowed
Stanford to clinch the series.
So it's a perceived weakness of
the Cardinal its bullpen that
could make the difference this
weekend. Though Appel who
could set Stanford's career record
in strikeouts if he punches out 15
Beavers tonight, tying his best for a
single game and Boyd are ex
pected to pitch late into the night in
the opener, the Cardinal's starting
rotation is not nearly as reliable af
ter its senior righty. Without strong
pitching by its relievers, Stanford
will be hard-pressed to get out of
the weekend still in contention for a
postseason berth.
Oregon State, like the Cardinal,
is a middle-of-the-pack hitting team

with a couple of sluggers to watch
out for. Leftfielder Michael Confor
to, who led the Pac-12 in home runs
and RBI last season as a freshman,
has fallen back ever so slightly as a
sophomore but still leads the
Beavers with seven long flies.
Across from him in right field, fellow
sophomore Dylan Davis has more
doubles (17) than any other player
in the conference and leads his
team with 34 RBI.
Appel goes for the record
against those dangerous hitters
tonight at 6:30 p.m., with a 2 p.m.
first pitch slated for Saturday and a
1 p.m. Sunday start to follow.
