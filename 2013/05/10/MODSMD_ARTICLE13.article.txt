# SPORTS BRIEF
## Women's golf off to a sluggish start at the NCAA West Regional 
### â€“ Cameron Miller 
Despite feeling confident about the
prospect of continued success on its home
course, the No. 11 Stanford women's golf team
struggled in Thursday's opening round of the
NCAA West Regional. After one round of play,
the team is in a four-way tie for 12th place, four
spots and four strokes behind No. 8 Cal. The
top eight teams qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships.
Sophomore Mariko Tumangan and fresh
man Lauren Kim led the Cardinal on the day
and ended as part of a large group of golfers
tied for 36th at 3-over par 74. Tumangan
recorded three birdies but posted double bo
geys on the par-5 first hole and par-3 eighth
hole. Kim also had three birdies to go along
with four bogeys and a double bogey on the
par-4 18th hole. Freshman Mariah Stackhouse
Stanford's usual lowest scorer had an in
auspicious start to her first NCAA Regional,
shooting 4-over through her first nine holes.

She followed that with two birdies and two bo
geys on the back nine.
The Cardinal certainly has its work cut out
for itself to earn a spot in the NCAA Champi
onship: In each of the past three seasons, the
lowest Stanford has finished after the opening
day of the Regional was ninth in 2010. All
three teams ultimately advanced to the NCAA
Championships.
No. 8 Vanderbilt leads the tournament by
one stroke over heavily favored No. 1 USC.
Trojan Annie Park (-4), the 2013 Pac-12 Cham
pion and top-ranked collegiate golfer in the na
tion, has a one-stroke advantage over Geor
gia's Emilie Burger (-3) atop the individual
leaderboard.
Friday's second round will start in two
waves, the first at 7:30 a.m. and the second at
11:50 a.m.
