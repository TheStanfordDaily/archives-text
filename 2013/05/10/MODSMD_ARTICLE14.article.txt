## NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND Culture, Politics and the "Elite" 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
Over the past week, we have
seen a lot of articles focusing
on some combination of cul
ture, politics and the "elite." My fel
low Daily columnist Adam Johnson
seems to have sparked a mini-crisis
on the comment boards by simply
claiming, "Stanford perpetuates the
elite."
Adam writes in his eloquent col
umn: "Given our custodial staff's
readiness to clean up after every
mess, our easily-gained extensions
on problem sets and the trivial slaps
on the wrist for students who per
haps should have been expelled,
should we be surprised when grad
uates of elite universities like Stan
ford compromise our nation's finan
cial system or send troops into un
just wars?"
This in turn prompted Chris
Hemes, another of our rank, to
produce "Thank God Almighty for
the Elite" in Tuesday's edition of
The Daily.
"We need to be the kind of elites
that cure cancer, build cheap, earth
quake-proof structures in Pakistan,
end wars and generate famine-re
sistant crops for East Africa. I
think Stanford provides the oppor
tunities for us to do these great
things and attempts to produce
these types of elites," Chris con
cludes.
At exactly the same time, my
friend and comrade Janani Bala
subramanian penned a post for
STATIC last week calling out San
skriti — a group for the South
Asian Diaspora and its allies at
Stanford for co-hosting an event
with Stanford Israel Alliance. San
skriti, which had hosted an event in
2007 called "South Asian Solidarity
Against Israeli Apartheid," be
trayed solidarity with the Palestini
ans, who live under a similar history
of colonial oppression, Janani said.
"Because Stanford students will
go on to accumulate much more
wealth and political power, it is a
dangerous game to reinforce the at
titude on our campus that Israel is a
great party theme, rather than an
enactor of apartheid," Janani
writes.
Janani's piece then sparked a se
ries of responses and counter re
sponses.
"This event had no political pur
pose, nor any intention other than

to bring together a few dozen stu
dents from both communities to sit
on FloMo field and engage socially
over falafel and samosas," wrote
Amrita Rao, a member of Sanskriti
and author of the first response to
Janani's piece. "We did not 'cele
brate the colonial Israeli state' or
even talk about it. We did, however,
marvel over the presence of
the hamsa (swan) as a symbol in
both cultures, an example of the
many principles they share."
The number of pieces on this
topic currently stands at five.
My response to these series of
posts is brief: The oppositional com
ments on Adam's column and re
sponses to Janani's posts, and the
content of Chris' pieces, all indicate
a divide between the cultural and
the political that does not, in fact,
exist.
Adam correctly asserts that the
culture we inhabit at Stanford or
any elite university implicates us
in politically exploitative and de
structive situations as world leaders
(and, I would add, as current stu
dents).
A friend of mine offered one in
tervention to Adam's piece, howev
er. Replacing "elite" with "upper
class" (or "ruling class") would have
crystallized the column further
and would have made it very diffi
cult for Chris to write a column ti
tled "Thank God Almighty for the
Ruling Class."
As Chris points out, elite or se
lective institutions have produced
valuable contributions to society.
(Chris cites medicine and technolo
gy as two such examples.) Yet, what
Chris misses is that the culture of
the upper or ruling class (and its
politics) make it impossible to do
things like end wars.
Amrita's response to criticism of
the SIA-Sanksriti event illustrates
the danger of drawing distinctions
between the cultural and the politi
cal. Illegal military occupations and
colonial violence become drowned
out by discussions of swans over
falafel and samosas. But not even
falafel is divorced from politics
the food originates from the culture
of the Palestinians, whose land the
state occupies. Events like this say,
"We can have your land and food
and eat it, too!"
As Janani writes, "Culture must

be contextualized in its political con
text. This is particularly relevant in
the case of Zionism (Israeli nation
alism). Indeed, the initiative to
mark Israel as a site of cultural and
progressive vibrancy and there
by erase its colonial occupation of
Palestine —is literally called
'Brand Israel.'"
To take Chris at his word and ac
cept that we must be the type of
elites who cure cancer, end wars
and combat famine, we must then
also take critical and constructive
looks at the systems that operate
around us. This means acknowledg
ing what exploitation and oppres
sion look like and how our actions
could or could not participate in
them.
Facilitating this process is what
I seek to do with this column, and it
is what I hope my peers continue to
do with their writing.

ford compromise our nation's finan
cial system or send troops into un
just wars?"
This in turn prompted Chris
Hemes, another of our rank, to
produce "Thank God Almighty for
the Elite" in Tuesday's edition of
The Daily.
"We need to be the kind of elites
that cure cancer, build cheap, earth
quake-proof structures in Pakistan,
end wars and generate famine-re
sistant crops for East Africa. I
think Stanford provides the oppor
tunities for us to do these great
things and attempts to produce
these types of elites," Chris con
cludes.
At exactly the same time, my
friend and comrade Janani Bala
subramanian penned a post for
STATIC last week calling out San
skriti — a group for the South
Asian Diaspora and its allies at
Stanford for co-hosting an event
with Stanford Israel Alliance. San
skriti, which had hosted an event in
2007 called "South Asian Solidarity
Against Israeli Apartheid," be
trayed solidarity with the Palestini
ans, who live under a similar history
of colonial oppression, Janani said.
"Because Stanford students will
go on to accumulate much more
wealth and political power, it is a
dangerous game to reinforce the at
titude on our campus that Israel is a
great party theme, rather than an
enactor of apartheid," Janani
writes.
Janani's piece then sparked a se
ries of responses and counter re
sponses.
"This event had no political pur
pose, nor any intention other than

to bring together a few dozen stu
dents from both communities to sit
on FloMo field and engage socially
over falafel and samosas," wrote
Amrita Rao, a member of Sanskriti
and author of the first response to
Janani's piece. "We did not 'cele
brate the colonial Israeli state' or
even talk about it. We did, however,
marvel over the presence of
the hamsa (swan) as a symbol in
both cultures, an example of the
many principles they share."
The number of pieces on this
topic currently stands at five.
My response to these series of
posts is brief: The oppositional com
ments on Adam's column and re
sponses to Janani's posts, and the
content of Chris' pieces, all indicate
a divide between the cultural and
the political that does not, in fact,
exist.
Adam correctly asserts that the
culture we inhabit at Stanford or
any elite university implicates us
in politically exploitative and de
structive situations as world leaders
(and, I would add, as current stu
dents).
A friend of mine offered one in
tervention to Adam's piece, howev
er. Replacing "elite" with "upper
class" (or "ruling class") would have
crystallized the column further
and would have made it very diffi
cult for Chris to write a column ti
tled "Thank God Almighty for the
Ruling Class."
As Chris points out, elite or se
lective institutions have produced
valuable contributions to society.
(Chris cites medicine and technolo
gy as two such examples.) Yet, what
Chris misses is that the culture of
the upper or ruling class (and its
politics) make it impossible to do
things like end wars.
Amrita's response to criticism of
the SIA-Sanksriti event illustrates
the danger of drawing distinctions
between the cultural and the politi
cal. Illegal military occupations and
colonial violence become drowned
out by discussions of swans over
falafel and samosas. But not even
falafel is divorced from politics
the food originates from the culture
of the Palestinians, whose land the
state occupies. Events like this say,
"We can have your land and food
and eat it, too!"
As Janani writes, "Culture must

be contextualized in its political con
text. This is particularly relevant in
the case of Zionism (Israeli nation
alism). Indeed, the initiative to
mark Israel as a site of cultural and
progressive vibrancy and there
by erase its colonial occupation of
Palestine —is literally called
'Brand Israel.'"
To take Chris at his word and ac
cept that we must be the type of
elites who cure cancer, end wars
and combat famine, we must then
also take critical and constructive
looks at the systems that operate
around us. This means acknowledg
ing what exploitation and oppres
sion look like and how our actions
could or could not participate in
them.
Facilitating this process is what
I seek to do with this column, and it
is what I hope my peers continue to
do with their writing.
