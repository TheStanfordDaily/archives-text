## The
						Great Northern Science Freeze Out 
### Holly Moeller 
I have a big crush on Canada. I
love the country's beautiful, un
populated expanses. I adore its
friendly, warm people. My favorite
part of watching playoff hockey is
hearing the announcers' Canadian
accents. And in general, I thought
of the country's sociopolitical atti
tudes as falling closer to my own
liberal values. I hoped that some of
our northern neighbor's forward
thinking on equality and environ
mental protection might rub off on
the United States.
Now, I've changed my mind:
Canada is in trouble.
Perhaps I shouldn't be sur
prised. After all, before Stephen
Harper became Prime Minister in
2006, he wrote a memo calling the
Kyoto Protocol an international
agreement to address climate
change a "socialist conspiracy"
that was wasting time trying to
regulate carbon dioxide, which
everyone knows is a nutrient, not a
pollutant. Not only did the memo
reveal a woeful disregard for scien
tific knowledge (yes, carbon dioxide
is used by plants to grow, but it's al
so a potent greenhouse gas emitted
by human activity and responsible
for climate change), but it foreshad
owed Canada's divestment from
the Kyoto objectives in 2007 and,
ultimately, withdrawal altogether
in December 2011.
By dropping out, Harper and
the Conservative government also
neatly ducked a series of penalties
for failing to meet promises of
emissions reductions. And that's a
very good thing, given their
unswerving commitment to drilling
Alberta's tar sands.
The tar sands are an economic
gold mine in today's fossil fuel
crazed world, but that's about all
they have going for them. They're
environmentally costly you've
got to clear pristine forest and con
taminate local groundwater to ex
tract the sludgy bitumen trapped in
the geological matrix and not
particularly efficient the return
on investment is about six joules of
energy out for every one put in,
compared to 15:1 in conventional
North American oil production.
Plus, by grounding yet another pil
lar of the Canadian economy in nat
ural resource extraction, they
drown out development in other,
more sustainable, sectors.
All right, so I might not agree
with Canada's choice to prioritize
economy over environment, but it's
the responsibility of that country's
voters to check that decision. So
long as they're properly informed.
That's the latest worry in Cana
da, where the government seems
happy to pull the curtain over sci
entific progress whenever it con
flicts with its political interests.
In the past year, Canada has
made the news for a series of sci
ence policy decisions that suggest
that scientific discovery and,
worse, honest scientific communi
cation are low on its priority list.
A year ago, the federal govern
ment announced plans to defund
several long-term research facili
ties, including the Experimental
Lakes Area (home to landmark dis
coveries about water pollution that
transformed policy around the
world) and the Polar Environment
Atmospheric Research Lab (key to
understanding changes in high-lati
tude airspace). The government

claimed these closures would save
money. Sure: a whopping $3.5 mil
lion, less than a 20th of a percent of
an $ll billion science and technolo
gy budget. The move drew world
wide protest and, as of last week, a
promise from the Ontario (Liberal)
government to step in and tem
porarily pick up the tab of the Ex
perimental Lakes Area.
More damning, though, are ac
cusations that the government has
been muzzling its scientists. The
"media protocol" implemented by
Harper's government in 2008 re
quires government scientists to
clear all interview requests with
higher-ups before speaking to jour
nalists. Some of these requests are
never granted or are so delayed
by the bureaucratic practice that
they take the scientists out of the
fast-paced media cycle. Further
more, the protocol also instructs of
ficials to "[ask] the programme ex
pert to respond with approved
lines." That is, to say only what the
government wants the people to
hear.
As a result, according to a com
plaint by the University of Victori
a's Environmental Law Centre,
Canadians have lost access to im
portant information about declin
ing fisheries stocks, a new Arctic
ozone hole and a host of other envi
ronmental issues. Last month,
Canada's Information Commission
finally agreed to investigate the
complaint hopefully before the
government's information cloak
completely undermines public de
bate.
You see, an informed citizen
base is the cornerstone of democra
cy. The work of government scien
tists is funded by, and should in
form, those citizens. When Canada
starts cutting corners, it sends an
alarming global message about pri
orities and censorship.
That's a message that hopefully
won't prove contagious. Yesterday,
President Obama issued an execu
tive order insisting that govern
ment information be open and
highly accessible, traits that he be
lieves strengthen the United States
in the long run. Wouldn't you
agree?
