# Who is GATSBY?
## Baz Luhrmann film brings opulence, little substance 
### MEIHSIN CHENG I STAFF WRITER 
From the moment "The
Great Gatsby" starts, it is
clear that this is Baz
Luhrmann's Gatsby, not F. Scott
Fitzgerald's. While the movie is a
pretty faithful word-by-word adap
tion of "The Great Gatsby," it lacks
the spirit of its original source. In
the novel, the images Fitzgerald
conjures are beautiful simply
because they are there. It's also a
relatively short and compact novel
filled with subtleties you only
notice on rereads. In the movie,
not only must Fitzgerald's best
descriptions be depicted with
heavy amounts of gaudy CGI, but
sometimes the words even need to
be plastered on screen. The movie
really tries too hard to convey the
messages and meaning of "The
Great Gatsby." Everything is too
obvious, overstated, and overdra
matic. Even for the Roaring
Twenties, there is a little too much
glitter and sparkling baubles for
viewers to take seriously.
In the Great Gatsby, we fol
low Nick Carraway (Tobey
Maguire) as he recalls and recov

ers from his recent experience
with the decadence of New York.
Nick is disgusted by everyone he
met in New York except for the
mysterious Jay Gatsby, a newly
wealthy man who throws giant,
crazy parties in his casde-like
mansion (Leonardo DiCaprio).
The movie starts off shaky with
Maguire trying too hard in his

narration to show that he is
world-weary and cynical.
Unfortunately, as the movie pro
gresses, it is clear that Maguire is
probably the least guilty of over
acting among the usually talented
cast. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay
Gatsby is not very memorable,
except for how he seems to look
unusually shiny and airbrushed

compared to everyone else. Carey
Mulligan's Daisy Buchanan comes
off as oddly sympathetic, mainly
because Daisy is too superficial to
know any better. The rest of the
main cast is rounded out by: Joel
Edgerton as Tom Buchanan;
Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker;
and Isla Fischer as Myrtle Wilson.
There's one scene early on

that captures everything wrong
with the movie. Gatsby's smile is
famously described to be one of
those rare smiles that have "a
quality of eternal reassurance."
When Nick meets Gatsby for the
.very first time, not only does the
music swell and Gatsby seem to
glow via CGI magic, but a slew of
fireworks also happen to explode
in the background. There are sev
eral moments like this in the
movie that made me wonder if I
was watching a strange version of
"Alice in Wonderland: the Flapper
Edition" instead.
I expected that the use of
modern music, including Jay-Z
rap instead of jazz during the
characters' celebrations, would be
off-putting. Surprisingly, this was
not the case; I found the sound
track to actually be one of the bet
ter aspects of a deeply flawed film.
"The Great Gatsby" is filled
with complicated visuals, but
unfortunately, like the bottles of
champagne and confetti that the
characters open, the movie is light
on actual substance.
