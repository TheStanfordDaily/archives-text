## 'Death of a Salesman' links to Asian American experience 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the Asian American The
ater Project (AATP) will put on a production
of "Death of a Salesman" with a twist.
Rather than relying on an all-white cast appro
priate to the play's 1949 composition, the
AATP version has cast a largely Asian ensem
ble, an unorthodox decision framed by co-pro
ducer Ken Savage 'l4 as offering a distinctive
take on the American classic.
According to Savage, AATP was inspired
to put on the production because the group
thought that the themes explored in Miller's
play were also relevant to the Asian American
experience.
"Part of AATP's mission is to look at all
plays through an Asian and Asian American

lens and see how each of these plays speak to
our culture, our family values, the ideas and
themes that matter most to us," Savage said.
"What does the American dream mean to an
immigrant family?"
For Asia Chiao 'l5, AATP's artistic direc
tor, being involved in the play allowed her to
better grasp some of the issues concerning
Asian American actors.
"Since coming to the U.S. for college, I've
realized how many problems of representa
tion, both underrepresentation and misrepre
sentation, there are in theater, particularly
with regards to Asian Americans," Chiao said.
Chiao, Savage and other members of the
AATP board of directors made the decision to
put on "Death of a Salesman" this quarter

In adapting Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," the Asian American Theater Project
chose a mostly Asian cast to help connect the play to the Asian American experience.
