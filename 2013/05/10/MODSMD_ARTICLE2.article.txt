## 'Death of a Salesman' links to Asian American experience 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the Asian American The
ater Project (AATP) will put on a production
of "Death of a Salesman" with a twist.
Rather than relying on an all-white cast appro
priate to the play's 1949 composition, the
AATP version has cast a largely Asian ensem
ble, an unorthodox decision framed by co-pro
ducer Ken Savage 'l4 as offering a distinctive
take on the American classic.
According to Savage, AATP was inspired
to put on the production because the group
thought that the themes explored in Miller's
play were also relevant to the Asian American
experience.
"Part of AATP's mission is to look at all
plays through an Asian and Asian American

lens and see how each of these plays speak to
our culture, our family values, the ideas and
themes that matter most to us," Savage said.
"What does the American dream mean to an
immigrant family?"
For Asia Chiao 'l5, AATP's artistic direc
tor, being involved in the play allowed her to
better grasp some of the issues concerning
Asian American actors.
"Since coming to the U.S. for college, I've
realized how many problems of representa
tion, both underrepresentation and misrepre
sentation, there are in theater, particularly
with regards to Asian Americans," Chiao said.

AATP board of directors made the decision to

In adapting Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," the Asian American Theater Project
chose a mostly Asian cast to help connect the play to the Asian American experience.
with a primarily Asian cast as
a means of exploring some of
these issues.
"We wanted to see how
AATP could put a fresh spin
on it, looking at the play in the
context of an Asian American
community," Chiao said.
Dina Hassan 'l5, director
of the play, suggested that
Miller's piece was chosen be
cause of the ability of the top
ics addressed to transcend
ethnic boundaries.
"The themes [in the play]
relate to humanity and to us
as Americans," Hassan said.
"It's a classic American play,
not a classic white American
play."
Hassan argued that such
universalism extends beyond
plot lines to the makeup of the
cast itself.
"People can relate because
they can see themselves in
those shoes," she said. "In
AATI] we want to encourage
Asian American participa
tion in the theater because
there's a stigma that minori
ty actors face. Some say, 'You
couldn't play this role be
cause it doesn't pertain to
your world.' We all can relate
to this play. The experiences
are universal."
By pushing the horizons of
what is traditionally expected
of such a performance, Has
san hopes to challenge the au
dience to embrace the non
conventional.
"One of my goals for the
play is to open the minds of
the audience and allow them
to see that the Asian Ameri
can experience is not limited
to what you see on TV or any
thing like that," Hassan
added. "It's very expansive
and can be related to quite
easily."
Chiao framed her goals
for the play as inducing the
audience to consider them be
liefs concerning theater.
"I want people to think,
'This is really interesting,"'
Chiao said. "'Why does it
have to be played by an all
white cast? Why do we come
in with these assumptions
about ethnicity?' This is a
chance to see a production of
'Death of a Salesman' unlike
anything before."
Chiao and her fellow di

rectors also aimed to prompt
the Asian American theater
community to embrace diver
sity in the types of roles they
choose to take on.
"Productions like this
where we're giving opportu
nities to Asian American ac
tors, directors, artists, to give
them a chance to work on
projects that encourage peo
ple to think, reinterpret, eval
uate— this is why I joined
AATP at the end of last year
and why I will continue to be
a part of it," Chiao said.
According to Savage, this
production was many of the
actors' first forays into the
ater.
"We want to make sure
they have an opportunity
that they have never had,"
Savage said. "Our goal is to
make sure that everyone is
enjoying themselves and
feels supported and safe. A
secondary goal I have is to
really [make] sure this play
sparks dialogue between the
production, actors and the
audience about what the
American dream means, es
pecially among minority
groups."
Despite their casting of a
predominately Asian Ameri
can ensemble, Hassan said
that the production team has
not had to make many
changes to the script in order
to accommodate an Asian
American family.
"At first it was hard, be
cause I was thinking about,
how I can change this to
make it work for an Asian
American family," Hassan
said. "But we just needed to
look at it from a different per
spective ... You don't think, 'I
have to make this Asian.' You
think, 'How is this relatable
to the minority experience?"'
Catherine Zaw 'l5, the set
designer, emphasized that
she did not have to make too

many changes for an Asian
American family.
"The only changes I had
to make were because of
space constraints and tiny
changes, like using a tea pot
[instead of a pitcher]," Zaw,
who is a Daily staffer, said. "I
wanted a very minimalistic
stage because I didn't want it
to be so personalized that it
was clearly Asian. I wanted it
to be contemporary to its
time, but it could go in either
direction about whose how it
is. We didn't put distinct
things or cultural things in
the play."
Savage noted that the
production's leaders hadn't
realized how well the concept
of an all-Asian family would
work.
"The synergy between
casting and the text itself has
been wonderful," he said.
"This is something new that
Stanford hasn't seen before."
Although Hassan said
that her crew has not re
ceived much criticism from
the Stanford community
about changing the play's
traditional casting, she con
ceded that some people did
not think it was a good idea.
"Yale did an all-black ver
sion of 'Death of a Salesman'
and got so much flack about
it, that it doesn't reflect black
history and the black experi
ence in America," Hassan
said.
Still, Hassan and Savage
concluded that the play's ex
periences and references
work in an Asian American
context.
"Arthur Miller thought it
would work, too, because [ap
parently] he brought the play
to Beijing," Hassan said.
"['Death of a Salesman'] is
very relatable."

"I want people to think,
'This is really interesting,"'
Chiao said. "'Why does it
have to be played by an all
white cast? Why do we come
in with these assumptions
about ethnicity?' This is a
chance to see a production of
'Death of a Salesman' unlike
anything before."
Chiao and her fellow di

rectors also aimed to prompt
the Asian American theater
community to embrace diver
sity in the types of roles they
choose to take on.
"Productions like this
where we're giving opportu
nities to Asian American ac
tors, directors, artists, to give
them a chance to work on
projects that encourage peo
ple to think, reinterpret, eval
uate— this is why I joined
AATP at the end of last year
and why I will continue to be
a part of it," Chiao said.
According to Savage, this
production was many of the
actors' first forays into the
ater.
"We want to make sure
they have an opportunity
that they have never had,"
Savage said. "Our goal is to
make sure that everyone is
enjoying themselves and
feels supported and safe. A
secondary goal I have is to
really [make] sure this play
sparks dialogue between the
production, actors and the
audience about what the
American dream means, es
pecially among minority
groups."
Despite their casting of a
predominately Asian Ameri
can ensemble, Hassan said
that the production team has
not had to make many
changes to the script in order
to accommodate an Asian
American family.
"At first it was hard, be
cause I was thinking about,
how I can change this to
make it work for an Asian
American family," Hassan
said. "But we just needed to
look at it from a different per
spective ... You don't think, 'I
have to make this Asian.' You
think, 'How is this relatable
to the minority experience?"'
Catherine Zaw 'l5, the set
designer, emphasized that
she did not have to make too

many changes for an Asian
American family.
"The only changes I had
to make were because of
space constraints and tiny
changes, like using a tea pot
[instead of a pitcher]," Zaw,
who is a Daily staffer, said. "I
wanted a very minimalistic
stage because I didn't want it
to be so personalized that it
was clearly Asian. I wanted it
to be contemporary to its
time, but it could go in either
direction about whose how it
is. We didn't put distinct
things or cultural things in
the play."
Savage noted that the
production's leaders hadn't
realized how well the concept
of an all-Asian family would
work.
"The synergy between
casting and the text itself has
been wonderful," he said.
"This is something new that
Stanford hasn't seen before."
Although Hassan said
that her crew has not re
ceived much criticism from
the Stanford community
about changing the play's
traditional casting, she con
ceded that some people did
not think it was a good idea.
"Yale did an all-black ver
sion of 'Death of a Salesman'
and got so much flack about
it, that it doesn't reflect black
history and the black experi
ence in America," Hassan
said.
Still, Hassan and Savage
concluded that the play's ex
periences and references
work in an Asian American
context.
"Arthur Miller thought it
would work, too, because [ap
parently] he brought the play
to Beijing," Hassan said.
"['Death of a Salesman'] is
very relatable."

This weekend, the Asian American The
ater Project (AATP) will put on a production
of "Death of a Salesman" with a twist.
Rather than relying on an all-white cast appro
priate to the play's 1949 composition, the
AATP version has cast a largely Asian ensem
ble, an unorthodox decision framed by co-pro
ducer Ken Savage 'l4 as offering a distinctive
take on the American classic.
According to Savage, AATP was inspired
to put on the production because the group
thought that the themes explored in Miller's
play were also relevant to the Asian American
experience.
"Part of AATP's mission is to look at all
plays through an Asian and Asian American

lens and see how each of these plays speak to
our culture, our family values, the ideas and
themes that matter most to us," Savage said.
"What does the American dream mean to an
immigrant family?"
For Asia Chiao 'l5, AATP's artistic direc
tor, being involved in the play allowed her to
better grasp some of the issues concerning
Asian American actors.
"Since coming to the U.S. for college, I've
realized how many problems of representa
tion, both underrepresentation and misrepre
sentation, there are in theater, particularly
with regards to Asian Americans," Chiao said.
Chiao, Savage and other members of the
AATP board of directors made the decision to
put on "Death of a Salesman" this quarter

In adapting Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," the Asian American Theater Project
chose a mostly Asian cast to help connect the play to the Asian American experience.
with a primarily Asian cast as
a means of exploring some of
these issues.
"We wanted to see how
AATP could put a fresh spin
on it, looking at the play in the
context of an Asian American
community," Chiao said.
Dina Hassan 'l5, director
of the play, suggested that
Miller's piece was chosen be
cause of the ability of the top
ics addressed to transcend
ethnic boundaries.
"The themes [in the play]
relate to humanity and to us
as Americans," Hassan said.
"It's a classic American play,
not a classic white American
play."
Hassan argued that such
universalism extends beyond
plot lines to the makeup of the
cast itself.
"People can relate because
they can see themselves in
those shoes," she said. "In
AATI] we want to encourage
Asian American participa
tion in the theater because
there's a stigma that minori
ty actors face. Some say, 'You
couldn't play this role be
cause it doesn't pertain to
your world.' We all can relate
to this play. The experiences
are universal."
By pushing the horizons of
what is traditionally expected
of such a performance, Has
san hopes to challenge the au
dience to embrace the non
conventional.
"One of my goals for the
play is to open the minds of
the audience and allow them
to see that the Asian Ameri
can experience is not limited
to what you see on TV or any
thing like that," Hassan
added. "It's very expansive
and can be related to quite
easily."
Chiao framed her goals
