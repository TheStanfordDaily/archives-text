# DANGEROUS Liaisons
## Stanford Theater Lab brings modernity to hedonistic play 
### ANDREA HINTON I MANAGING EDITOR 
cc -w- es Liaisons Dangereuses" is perhaps the antithe
sis of all things romantic. Adapted from the 1782
-L—/novel by Pierre Choderlos de Lados, "Liaisons"
introduces audiences to the hedonistic French aristocracy of
the 18th century. The Stanford Theater Lab performance,
which opened Thursday night, wows audiences with equal
parts opulence and modernity.
Though the supporting cast is carefully woven into its
plot, "Liaisons" is, at its heart, a tale of two lovers. The theme

of the show is, in a word, sex. The play centers on the
Vicompte de Valmont (Paul Princen 'l3), whose female
equivalent, the Marquise de Merteuil (Safiya Nygaard 'l4),
leads him on a vicious game of seduction culminating in a
love pentagon with their younger, more innocent counter
parts, Tourvel (Jessica Waldman 'l5), Voulanges (Max
Walker-Silverman 'l5) and Cecile (Kasie Udo-Okoye 'l5).
Princen is a near-flawless Valmont, whose perfect arro
gance and perpetual smirks play second fiddle only to those
of his lady-love, Merteuil. "Liaisons" is heavy on the scenes
between these two; fortunately, both have the talent to carry
most of the emotional weight of "Liaisons." Nygaard, in par
ticular, is nothing short of wicked, and her character never
wavers for an instant; yet, her blunt assessments ("Women,"
she says, "are obliged to be far more skillful than men") and
feminist leanings have us rooting for her almost the entire
time. Princen, too, brings a malicious wit to the script, effort
lessly switching between ice-cold upper-cruster and shame

less, masterful womanizer.
The Stanford production of "Liaisons" is a study in con
trasts. The sight of an 18th-century, corseted French woman
reading a love letter off a Macßook Pro is somewhat jarring,
and yet director and producer David Raymond 'l3 for
whom "Liaisons" is a senior project brings a Luhrmann
esque quality to the production that feels updated rather than
gaudy. Between scenes, we are courted by Lana Del Rey and
hip-hop; even the set itself, a meticulously geometric stage
arrangement supplemented by plush lounge chairs and rich
fabrics, nods to the frivolity of Marie Antoinette's reign.
With sex, lies and betrayal as its selling factors, "Liaisons"
stands out as a stellar, modern production of a classic tale,
with the help of a high-power cast and design.
"Les Liaisons Dangereuses" will be playing May 9-11 at 8
p.m. in the Nitery Theater. Admission is free.
