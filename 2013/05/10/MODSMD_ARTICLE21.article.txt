At the San Francisco International
Film Festival on Wednesday, writer
director Richard Linklater and
actress-writer Julie Delpy took the stage at
the Sundance Kabuki to discuss their film
"Before Sunrise" and its sequel "Before
Sunset." In the first film, Jesse (Ethan Hawke)
and Celine (Delpy) meet on a train in
Europe; she's going home to Paris, while he's
going to Vienna to catch a flight back to the
United States. He convinces her to get off the
train in Vienna with him and spend the
night walking around the city and talking.
Nine years later, they meet again in Paris in
"Sunset," now in their 30s and in relation
ships, to discover what might have been.
The third film, "Before Midnight,"
which had its premiere Thursday as the festi
val's closing night film, was made and takes
place nine years after "Before Sunset"; the
characters are now in their 40s, in a relation
ship together and have children. Screenwriter
Michael Jones joined them as their inter
viewer, with an excellent set of prepared
questions about their process for working on
the films. He selected and showed a series of
clips from the first two films, throughout the
evening, to help frame the discussion.
Although Linklater wrote the screenplay
for "Before Sunrise" with Kim Krizan and
brought the actors in afterward, Delpy,
Hawke and Linklater co-wrote "Before
Sunset" and "Before Midnight" in what was a
very collaborative process, in which they
thought everything through the motiva
tions for why each character says and does
everything and had to agree on every
thing. When one person brings an idea to
the group, Linklater explained, "You're going
to have two people going, 'Hmm, let's talk
about that. What would that mean?' And

you might have two weeks of conversation
and see if that would end up in a movie, and
it's going to be fully thought out."
Delpy elaborated, "We really work
together on every character. Sometimes, I
will call Ethan on something he wrote about
his character that I don't think is right
because it brings something that I think is
wrong for Celine, or she wouldn't have
stayed if he was like that."
Delpy articulated the difference between
Jesse and Celine and how meeting up again
in "Before Sunset" affected the latter.
"She's pissed off that she's in love with
him in away," Delpy said. "She keeps resist
ing it. She is the less romantic one in away,
the more rational one. You know, she works
in a job that's rational. She's not a creative
person; she's not a writer like he is. He can
romanticize things. And I think she keeps
shutting down that part of her, and then it's
all revived by seeing him again and him basi
cally telling her that he loves her and that
he's loved her for years."
Linklater talked about what it was like
to have such a long "gestation period"
between the films and how that lets them
really explore the characters in depth.
"We've lived 19 more years since we
started this," he said. "We have eight kids
between the three of us. All that is fodder. So
much of our time together is spent talking
about how things go in our own lives ... In
the movie, they're on holiday but we had an
idea for a long time for it to just be a regular
Tuesday in their fives showing where they five
and what that's like, and that introduced a lot
of domestic thinking about the characters."
Delpy added, "We thought about where
they are professionally, their friends, how
they felt, what happened when they had a

kid. We're all using our life experience.
Celine, how she felt when she had a kid.
Maybe she didn't say everything to Jesse."
Linklater also pointed out that the
process helps them "work through all the
cliches."
"Because there are a lot of things where,
okay, you can't do that because then that
makes them unlikable characters who have
some unattractive qualities," she said. "But

maybe we have an audience for these movies
[who are willing to accept that] or we want
to express something that we find honest in
our own lives, that you don't always see, that
isn't always attractive."
t, "Before Sunrise" and "Before Sunset" are
available at Green Library. "Before
Midnight" opens in San Francisco on May
