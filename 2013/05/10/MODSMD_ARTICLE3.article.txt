Throughout her yearlong battle with
brain cancer, friends described Elizabeth Gao
'l5 as strong, positive and hopeful. Tomor
row, a team of friends will run in her memory
at the American Cancer Society Relay for
Life.
Jessia Hoffman 'l5, a freshman dorm
mate and fellow singer in the a cappella
group Mixed Company, created the Relay for
Life team "Inspired by Elizabeth," which had
raised $3,900 for the American Cancer Socie
ty at time of publication.
"I was having a really hard time with the
fact that Elizabeth was gone," Hoffman said.
"The only way to start to heal is by doing
something proactive."
Caroline Zhang 'l5, Gao's Delta Delta
Delta sorority sister and close friend, urged
not only participation in the 24-hour walking
relay but also reflection on cancer's ability to
touch the heart of a community.
"I hope people can come out and, if people
knew her, then remember her, and, if not,
then they can get to know her," Zhang said.
"She was just a very beautiful, inspiring per
son, and she has a great story."
When Gao arrived on the Farm as a fresh
man in 2011, she immediately made an im
pression on her peers with an upbeat attitude
and easy smile.
"She's just like a light," Zhang recalled.
"When you're around her, you just want to
smile. We joke that she just can't close her
lips. She's always smiling."
She drew people in effortlessly, continuing
to be positive even after she was diagnosed
with cancer.
"She was so strong, and she was always
just so positive about everything," said Patri
cia Costacurta 'l3, Gao's peer health educa
tor in Trancos last year. "You couldn't know

Elizabeth without loving her."
Her battle began in February 2012, when
she had her first seizure the day of Mixed
Company's annual performance. When Gao
returned to Trancos, Mixed Company wel
comed her back with a surprise performance.
"She was like taking a shower, and she got
out, and we started singing to her, and she
started crying," Hoffman said. "We all start
ed crying it was one of the most beautiful
moments I've ever experienced."
The reunion was short lived. Weeks into
spring quarter, Gao experienced another
seizure and was diagnosed with brain cancer.
She took a leave of absence for treatment,
while continuing to occasionally visit Traneos.
Throughout the summer, Gao continued
her fight. Hoffman, who visited her for the
last time in the fall of 2012, remarked on how
chemotherapy had taken a toll on both her
body and her spirit.
"Just a few months before, [Gao] had been
this really vivacious, huge presence," Hoff
man said. "It was almost like this disease had
condensed her spirit and squelched it a little
bit. That was so hard to see."
Jamie Kim 'l5, another friend and dorm
mate, said that seeing Gao as she went
through treatment was particularly difficult.
"I had kind of trained myself to kind of
see it coming, but still," Kim said. "Seeing
her condition deteriorate and seeing her in a
wheelchair, I couldn't even look at her with
out crying."
When Gao passed away on March 6, 2013,
the news hit her friends and the Trancos
community hard.
"It was just inconceivable," Hoffman said.
"I just started sobbing and 1... yelled at the
world."
On May 8, a memorial service for Gao was
conducted at Memorial Church, with speak-
