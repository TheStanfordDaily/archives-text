## Study shows rising heart failure costs Prof estimates total burden of treating heart failure will more than double by 2030 
### SARAH SALAMEH 
A study led by Professor of Medicine Paul Heidenre
ich 'B4 ED. '95 M.S. '9B has found that by 2030, one of
every 33 Americans more than eight million individu
als â€” will have heart failure and the overall cost of
treating heart failure patients will have risen from $3l
billion in 2012 to $7O billion in 2030.
Heidenreieh was asked to chair the study, which was
co-authored by 13 other doctors, by the American Heart
Association (AHA). The researchers released a state
ment detailing the study's findings on the behalf of the
organization.
"I was asked to lead this study by the AHA because
they knew in general that heart disease is going to in
crease in the population and they wanted to estimate the
impact," Heidenreieh said, noting that the AHA was
particularly interested in projecting the growth in heart
failure rates within the next 20 years.
According to Heidenreieh, heart disease is currently
the leading cause of patient hospitalization in the United
States. The projected dramatic increase in heart failure
patients over the next two decades will cost each Amer
ican taxpayer an additional $244 per year.
To estimate this cost, Heidenreieh and the research
team identified the prevalence of heart failure and the
initial cost per taxpayer for each additional incidence of
heart failure among 32 different demographic groups
using data from the National Health and Nutrition Ex
amination surveys conducted between 1999 and 2008.
With this data set, the researchers generated a pro
jection for the total prevalence and cost among all demo
graphic groups in 2030 by multiplying the prevalence
rates and estimated costs by the projected population
for each demographic group. The projected costs were
based on historical rates of growth in medical spending
and the assumption of constant rates of inflation and
technological innovation.
Heidenreieh said that the predicted rise in heart fail
ure prevalence and cost can partially be attributed to an
increase in the American population's average age, as
older people tend to be at higher risk for heart failure.
The study predicts that total costs for heart failure in
the 18-44 age group will increase from $1.51 billion to
$2.48 billion, while the costs for the 65-79 age group will
increase from $11.50 billion to $29.9 billion.
"I don't think there is anything we can do about the
aging of the population that's the thing that's going to
happen no matter what," Heidenreieh said. "What we
need to do is, for any person
of any given age, try to de
crease the risk of developing
heart failure through pre
vention."
According to Heidenre
ich, these prevention meas
ures are not unique to efforts
to address heart failure.
"In some ways, things
that one would do to prevent
heart failure are things one
would do to prevent heart
disease in general con
trolling high blood pressure,
trying to decrease the risk of
heart attack by knowing
one's cholesterol and, if that
is normally elevated, trying
to improve that with diet or
drugs if needed," he said.
According to Heidenre
ich, the Stanford Hospital
has specialists who work
with patients that are al
ready dealing with heart
failure. However, the hospi
tal also attempts to prevent
future incidents of heart fail
ure by encouraging patients
to maintain a healthy diet
and an active lifestyle.
Nancy Brown, CEO of

the AHA, also stressed pre
vention as the key to lessen
ing the impact of heart fail
ure prevalence.

"We have the solutions
we need to change the
course of heart failure in this
country, but we must take
steps now to reverse the
trend," Brown wrote in a
statement to The Daily. "If
we treat patients using ex
isting guidelines, improve
care transitions, adequately
train our healthcare work
force and reduce disparities
in the health outcomes of
specific populations, we can
lessen the burdens of heart
failure."
