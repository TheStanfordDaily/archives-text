## 
### MARGARET WENZLAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's 42nd annual Powwow will
take place this weekend in Eucalyptus
Grove. The event, which celebrates Native
American culture through traditional na
tive dance, arts and vendors, is expected to
see 10,000 visitors per day, solidifying its
reputation as the largest student-run pow
wow in the United States.
Powwow begins at 5 p.m. on May 10
with the opening of various Native Ameri
can art markets and special performances
of tribal dances. Dance competitions begin
at 7 p.m. with a grand entry by dancers

and will continue all day on May 11 and
May 12. The weekend will also feature the
annual Stanford Powwow Run, which in
cludes a 5K race and a one-mile youth run
around campus.
According to Katie Cromack 'l3, co
chair of this year's Powwow, the festival ul
timately aims to bring together various
groups within the nation's Native Ameri
can community in an effort to spread
awareness and appreciation of their cul
tural identities.
"Powwow —in general is a gather
ing of nations, away for different native
groups to come together and really ex
press cultures, through dance, through

music, through sharing tribal arts," Cro
mack said.
Cromack and other event organizers
estimated that over 100 arts and crafts
vendors selling tribal items such as jewel
ry, paintings and clothes will be at this
year's Powwow. The event will also host in
formational booths and food booths, some
of which will feature traditional native
foods like buffalo meat and frybread.
Despite the wide range of vendors, food
booths and educational opportunities,

the festival's main focus is the annu
al dance competitions.
According to Dutschke, there are
dance categories for men, women,
teens and children and competi
tion genres including Men and
Women's Fancy Dance, Men and
Women's Traditional, Teen Boys'
Grass and Teen Girls' Jingle
dances. She suggested that Pow
wow offers a unique opportunity for
firsthand exposure to Native Ameri
can culture and history.
"Through the process of watch
ing the Powwow, you learn a little bit
about the culture," she said. "Maybe
you have never been to a powwow,
and you ask someone, 'What is this
dance called?' and they tell you, and
they tell you a little bit of the history,
or when you go to buy a piece of jew
elry, you ask what it's made of, and
you learn not just what it's made of,
but why it's important."
Although the Stanford Powwow
has a rich history, multi-tribal pow
wows aren't a traditional feature of
Native American culture. Dutschke
pointed out that powwows are a

more modern development, having
emerged as a mid-century celebra
tion of Native American heritage.
"Powwow itself is not historical
it emerged as a pan-Indian move
ment to bring Indian native cultures
together and keep dancing alive, so
all those dances are not really tradi
tional dances. They emerged and
are becoming traditions," she said.
According to Cromack, the tradi
tion of the Stanford Powwow began
in the 19705, when the Native Amer
ican Cultural Center and the Stan
ford American Indian Organization
first organized the event.
"[The '7os] was the central peri
od when the native community real
ly banded together for the banning
of the Indian mascot," Dutschke
said, noting that Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk was also founded during that
decade.
Cromack noted that Powwow has
grown in popularity over the years,
now drawing visitors from around
the world. Due to the rising number
of attendees, the event has had to
move to the sprawling Eucalyptus
Grove near the Mausoleum.
"[The Powwow] was originally on
a soccer field," Cromack said. "It has
grown from a smaller venture to a
very large powwow one of the
largest powwows on the West Coast

[and] the largest student-run pow
wow in the country."
Planning such a large event has
required extensive preparation. Ac
cording to Cromack, who will co
chair the Powwow with Leah Bel
garde 'l3, student organizers di
vided themselves into about 15
sub-committees, with two to six
members each, depending on
workload. There are also 200 to
300 volunteers from across the
Farm and extensive support from
both the Native American Cultural
Center and students living in
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk.
"Part of theme requirements for
everyone to live in house is to volun
teer at Powwow," Dutschke said.
"We get a lot of people volunteering
and running committees."
This year will be Kohler's fourth
year working at the Stanford Pow
wow.
"I like being around the Powwow
and would come anyway," Kohler
said. "I like contributing to being a
part of my culture and helping my
peers. I have a lot of fun working on
facilities, working with friends,
working with a lot of people in the
community."

now drawing visitors from around
the world. Due to the rising number
of attendees, the event has had to
move to the sprawling Eucalyptus
Grove near the Mausoleum.

a soccer field," Cromack said. "It has
grown from a smaller venture to a
very large powwow one of the
largest powwows on the West Coast

[and] the largest student-run pow

chair the Powwow with Leah Bel

sub-committees, with two to six
members each, depending on
workload. There are also 200 to
300 volunteers from across the

both the Native American Cultural
Center and students living in
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk.

Stanford's 42nd annual Powwow will
take place this weekend in Eucalyptus
Grove. The event, which celebrates Native
American culture through traditional na
tive dance, arts and vendors, is expected to
see 10,000 visitors per day, solidifying its
reputation as the largest student-run pow
wow in the United States.
Powwow begins at 5 p.m. on May 10
with the opening of various Native Ameri
can art markets and special performances
of tribal dances. Dance competitions begin
at 7 p.m. with a grand entry by dancers

and will continue all day on May 11 and
May 12. The weekend will also feature the
annual Stanford Powwow Run, which in
cludes a 5K race and a one-mile youth run
around campus.
According to Katie Cromack 'l3, co
chair of this year's Powwow, the festival ul
timately aims to bring together various
groups within the nation's Native Ameri
can community in an effort to spread
awareness and appreciation of their cul
tural identities.
"Powwow —in general is a gather
ing of nations, away for different native
groups to come together and really ex
press cultures, through dance, through

music, through sharing tribal arts," Cro
mack said.
Cromack and other event organizers
estimated that over 100 arts and crafts
vendors selling tribal items such as jewel
ry, paintings and clothes will be at this
year's Powwow. The event will also host in
formational booths and food booths, some
of which will feature traditional native
foods like buffalo meat and frybread.
Despite the wide range of vendors, food
booths and educational opportunities,

the festival's main focus is the annu
al dance competitions.
According to Dutschke, there are
dance categories for men, women,
teens and children and competi
tion genres including Men and
Women's Fancy Dance, Men and
Women's Traditional, Teen Boys'
Grass and Teen Girls' Jingle
dances. She suggested that Pow
wow offers a unique opportunity for
firsthand exposure to Native Ameri
can culture and history.
"Through the process of watch
ing the Powwow, you learn a little bit
about the culture," she said. "Maybe
you have never been to a powwow,
and you ask someone, 'What is this
dance called?' and they tell you, and
they tell you a little bit of the history,
or when you go to buy a piece of jew
elry, you ask what it's made of, and
you learn not just what it's made of,
but why it's important."
Although the Stanford Powwow
has a rich history, multi-tribal pow
wows aren't a traditional feature of
Native American culture. Dutschke
pointed out that powwows are a

more modern development, having
emerged as a mid-century celebra
tion of Native American heritage.
"Powwow itself is not historical
it emerged as a pan-Indian move
ment to bring Indian native cultures
together and keep dancing alive, so
all those dances are not really tradi
tional dances. They emerged and
are becoming traditions," she said.
According to Cromack, the tradi
tion of the Stanford Powwow began
in the 19705, when the Native Amer
ican Cultural Center and the Stan
ford American Indian Organization
first organized the event.
"[The '7os] was the central peri
od when the native community real
ly banded together for the banning
of the Indian mascot," Dutschke
said, noting that Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk was also founded during that
decade.

grown in popularity over the years,
now drawing visitors from around
the world. Due to the rising number
of attendees, the event has had to
