# Problems with the playoff system
## 
### Sam Fisher 
Tuesday night felt like deja
vu. I sat in The Daily office
and watched the Warriors
take a big lead over the
Spurs and then start to
blow it. The Warriors held on to win,
which gave some relief, but it still felt
like deja vu.
I'm going to say it. The NBA and
NHL playoffs are too long.
Don't get me wrong. I love spoils
as much asâ€”let's be real, way more
than the next guy. But two
months of NHL and NBA playoff
games pretty much every night is
ridiculous. And it's unfair to the best
teams in each league, for very dif
ferent reasons.
Let's start with hockey well,
that's something nobody's ever said
in America before. In this year's
lockout-shortened season, it took
about 24 wins to make it to the post
season. It will take 16 more to win
the Stanley Cup. Isn't that a little
crazy?
I don't want to make too much of
a fuss over the one shortened sea
son. Critics will point out that last
year, the eighth-seeded Los Angeles
Kings won the Stanley Cup. Surely
this debunks any argument against
the current playoff model, doesn't
it?
I would disagree, and to do so, I'll
use the argument against Virginia
Commonwealth, which made a simi
lar miracle run a little over a year
earlier in the NCAA men's basket
ball tournament to reach the Final
Four.
Many people argued that VCU
was unworthy of a tournament bid
based on its resume. There were oth
er teams, many argued, that had
done more to earn the opportunity.
