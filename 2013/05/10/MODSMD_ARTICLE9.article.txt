# Problems with the playoff system
## 
### Sam Fisher 
Tuesday night felt like deja
vu. I sat in The Daily office
and watched the Warriors
take a big lead over the
Spurs and then start to
blow it. The Warriors held on to win,
which gave some relief, but it still felt
like deja vu.
I'm going to say it. The NBA and
NHL playoffs are too long.
Don't get me wrong. I love spoils
as much as—let's be real, way more
than the next guy. But two
months of NHL and NBA playoff
games pretty much every night is
ridiculous. And it's unfair to the best
teams in each league, for very dif
ferent reasons.
Let's start with hockey well,
that's something nobody's ever said
in America before. In this year's
lockout-shortened season, it took
about 24 wins to make it to the post
season. It will take 16 more to win
the Stanley Cup. Isn't that a little
crazy?
I don't want to make too much of
a fuss over the one shortened sea
son. Critics will point out that last
year, the eighth-seeded Los Angeles
Kings won the Stanley Cup. Surely
this debunks any argument against
the current playoff model, doesn't
it?
I would disagree, and to do so, I'll
use the argument against Virginia
Commonwealth, which made a simi
lar miracle run a little over a year
earlier in the NCAA men's basket
ball tournament to reach the Final
Four.
Many people argued that VCU
was unworthy of a tournament bid
based on its resume. There were oth
er teams, many argued, that had
done more to earn the opportunity.

Then VCU started winning
games. The Rams took down USC
in the First Four, Georgetown and
Purdue to reach the Sweet 16, and
then Florida State and Kansas to
earn a trip to the Final Four. Obvi
ously, VCU showed that it was a
much better team than its llth-seed
signified.
However, it does not mean that
VCU had any more right to be in
the NCAA Tournament. As much as
we all love underdog stories and
I jumped right on the VCU band
wagon— doesn't a team have to
earn its chance to be that underdog?
Otherwise, the regular season is
just a waste of time, and nobody
wants that.
With so much parity, and 16 play
off teams, I feel like the NHEs reg
ular season takes almost no value.
You just have to get into the tourna
ment. So, for everyone besides the
few teams on the bubble in the final

weeks, the regular season lacks
much excitement. There's a reason
so many people turn on hockey only
when the postseason begins.
The NBA, on the other hand, has
a very different problem. There just
isn't enough parity to support a 16-
team field. The top few seeds have
overwhelmingly large odds to ad
vance, making the first round or two
pretty hard to watch.
But even more importantly, the
large field provides too many op
portunities for bad things to hap
pen to the best teams.
I don't like the NBA very much
at all, but I have to admit, even I
was excited about the prospect of
the Heat taking on the Thunder in
the NBA Finals for the second sea
son in a row. Then Russell West
brook blew out his knee in the first
round against the Houston Rock
ets, and my interest vanished al
most as quickly as the Thunder's
NBA title hopes, which really is too
bad.
And don't tell me that the San
Antonio Spurs would be just as in
triguing of an opponent for the
Heat. After two games at home

against the Golden State Warriors,
it has become pretty clear that the
Spurs aren't close to the Heat. Bar
ring something crazy, like another
fluke injury, I would be stunned to
see anyone besides Lebron James
hoisting the championship trophy
once again in a few weeks.
Don't get me wrong, I under
stand why the system is the way it
currently is. Playoff games mean
more money, and more playoff
games means even more money. As
long as people keep treating the
first round of the playoffs as if they
are the playoffs and with so few
other television options in late April
and early May, who can blame them
—then nothing will change.
So I guess with both of my teams
falling short of the postseason, I'll
have to take the NCAA Tournament
approach.
Bring on the Madness.

Sam Fisher is really just mad that
he husn't been able to watch all the
