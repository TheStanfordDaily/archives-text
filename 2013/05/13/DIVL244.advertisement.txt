Free and open to the public
Robert Buelteman developed his love of landscape
growing up on the Peninsula, and over a career that has
spanned forty years he has produced award-winning
portfolios of black-and-white photography and, more
recently, revolutionary camera-less color photographs,
Much of the recent work has been done at Stanford's
Jasper Ridge—a space he knew intimately as a child
and where he has been a guest artist since 2010, His
newest portfolio, Life and Shadow, sees the native flora
of the Preserve as only Buelteman could, through the
remarkable technique of high-voltage, fiber-optic ally
illuminated photogrammetry. A review in Wired magazine
describes the technique as "a combination of Frankenstein
and Georgia O'Keeffe... so dangerous and laborious
that no one else will attempt it—even if they could get
through aii the steps."
