# Curry carrying the Warriors

Over the last ten years,
the correlation be
tween success in col
lege basketball and in
the NBA itself has
been all over the map. Think of the
most recognizable collegiate players,
like Tyler Hansbrough, Adam Morri
son, JJ Redick, John Wall and Derrick
Rose. Among that list, some players
have flashed brilliance, some have
shown true greatness and the rest
have been "meh". Hansbrough, Mor
rison and Redick seem to typify this
player: incredible in college, but just
another body in the hyper-competitive
NBA
Notably absent from the previous
"meh" list is one Stephen Curry and
this omission is with good reason. A
media darling through his days at
Davidson, Curry dragged talent-de
void teams through the early rounds
of the NCAA Tournament, shooting
and gunning his way into the minds of
fans nationwide. With the way things
stand right no\y Curry does not fit in
to the scrub list for one simple reason:
He is a bona-fide NBA superstar.
In the context of the 2009 NBA
draft, Curry was regarded as a one-di
mensional shooter, offering little in the
way of elite athleticism or defensive
prowess. His biggest claim to fame
was his incredible shooting ability,
something that was unstoppable and
deadly in college. The concern was
whether Curry, a small individual,
would be able to cope with the physical
demands of the league and whether
his incredible shooting would stand up
against the rugged defenders that
teams would be sure to run at him.
On draft day it was a foregone con
clusion that the Los Angeles Clippers
would select Blake Griffin out of Okla
homa, the consensus top player in the
draft. After that, the waters became
much murkier; there seemed to be lit
tle to separate a loaded class of point
guards. The Warriors held the seventh
pick in the draft and were shopping it
in an effort to pick up an established
superstar. In fact, some draft pundits
claimed that the Warriors would trade
the pick, straight-up, to Phoenix for
Amar'e Stoudemire, contingent on the
fact that the player the Suns wanted to
take was still on the board.
However, the draft slots fell in such
away as to leave Stephen Curry on
the board when the Warriors were to
pick. Then-GM Chris Mullin took Cur
ry with zero hesitation and held pat
while Phoenix tried in vain to pry Cur
ry from the Warriors. At the end of the
day, Mullin believed that Curry was a
player with the skills to be the center
piece of a competitive team. It bears
mentioning that the Timberwolves
held two top-10 picks ahead of the
Warriors and three overall picks in the
first round of the draft that year; their
selections were (in order) Ricky Ru
bio, Jonny Flynn and Ty Lawson, with
Rubio electing to stay in Em-ope for a
few more years, the Flynn pick back
firing and Lawson ending up on the
Nuggets through a trade.
Fast-forward a few years to today
and Curry's popularity and reputation
have soared to uncharted heights. The
pre-draft scouting report failed to rec
ognize a willing and instinctive passer
who can run the pick and roll efficient
ly, while also recognizing mismatches
and exploiting them all over the floor.
The report also understated the im
pact of Curry's shooting; as the
Nuggets and Spurs can attest to, giv
ing Curry even a glimmer of daylight
is enough for him to drain a shot,
range be damned. We're talking about
a player who beat Rick Reilly (admit
tedly not a professional basketball
player, but still) in a shooting contest
while shooting from half court!
When Curry gets hot, anything he
throws at the basket seems to go in
(cue Nuggets fans nodding slowly).
Paired with his "Splash Brothers"
sidekick in Klay Thompson anoth
er brilliant (if streaky) shooter with a
lockdown defender's mentalityâ€”the
Warriors have the "best shooting
backcourt in the history of the NBA,"
if their coach Mark Jackson is to be
believed. Regardless, over the last few
weeks, we have seen firsthand that
Curry can singlehandedly change the
outcomes of games. That is a powerful
statement that cannot be applied to
just any player. It takes someone spe
cial to deserve that praise.
The poison darts in the strawberry
tart are, as feared, Curry's injury
woes. To put it bluntly, his ankles ap
peal- to be made of a combination of
brittle glass and paper mache; it
seems like he suffers some ankle-re
lated setback at least once a month.
He has missed numerous games in
each of his seasons in the NBA and his
inability to stay healthy is reflected in
his relatively modest contract; much of
