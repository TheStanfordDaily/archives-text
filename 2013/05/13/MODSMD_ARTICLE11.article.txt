### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team pulled off one historic upset
but was unable to keep the mo
mentum rolling as its season ended
with a 15-8 loss to No. 2 North
western on Sunday afternoon.

"I was really proud of the
team's effort throughout the entire
game," Stanford head coach Amy
Bokker told GoStanford.com.
"Northwestern is a great opponent
and reigning national champions
so we knew we were going to have
our work cut out for us."
On Friday, the No. 20 Cardinal
(14-6, 6-2 MPSF) earned the pro
gram's first NCAA Tournament
win in history by knocking off No. 9
Notre Dame (12-5, 5-3 BIG EAST).
The Fighting Irish had previously
defeated the Cardinal 12-10 in the
season opener on Feb. 16, but a 7-2
halftime lead in that game gave
Stanford confidence for the re
match.
In the game that mattered most,
the Cardinal put together a full 60-
minute effort to take the victory.
On attack, freshman Lucy
Dikeou led the way with three
goals, including the game-tying
goal with 1:51 to play.
Sophomore midfielder Hannah
Farr chipped in with two scores,
including the game-winning goal
on a free-position shot with four
seconds remaining. Freshman at
tacker Julia Burns' two goals and
junior midfielder Anna Kim's one
rounded out the scoring for Stan
ford. Junior goalkeeper Lyndsey
Munoz made six saves in goal.

Until the very end, the rematch
looked a lot like the season opener.
Stanford jumped out to a 4-2 half
time lead, holding the Irish score
less for the final 11:53. After Stan
ford built the lead to 6-3 in the first
13 minutes of the second half,
Notre Dame began its comeback
charge.
The Irish scored three goals
over a stretch of 4:07 to tie the con
test with seven minutes remaining.
Two minutes later, Notre Dame's
Kaitlyn Brosco scored to give the
Irish its first lead since 1-0 early in
the first few minutes of the game.
But unlike in the first matchup,
the Cardinal had some more fight
left. Stanford won all three draw
controls remaining in the game to
spark a late run. First, Dikeou tied
the game when junior defender
Megan Lerner forced a key Notre
Dame turnover. Then, after Lern
er won the draw, Farr earned a
free-position shot and converted to
give the Cardinal its first-ever
NCAA Tournament victory.
"It's awesome to be able to ad
vance in the NCAA Tournament,"
Bokker told GoStanford.com after
the game. "We set our goals high
this season and it's something
we're really proud of."
The win earned Stanford an
other rematch, this time against
the Wildcats (18-2, 4-1 American
Lacrosse Conference), who defeat
ed the Cardinal 12-8 on April 14. In
this rematch, Stanford was unable
to pull off the upset as the Wild
cats' firepower proved too much.
Northwestern has won seven of
the past eight national champi
onships, including each of the last
three.
Stanford hung close through
halftime, but Northwestern pulled
away in the second half, in large
part by winning 12 of 14 draw con
trols in the period.

25 minutes into the game, the
score was tied 4-4 as sophomore
Kyle Eraser, junior Rachel Ozer
and freshmen Meg Lentz and
Lucy Dikeou each scored once to
match the Wildcats goal for goal.
Northwestern scored twice in the
final five minutes of the half to take
a 6-4 lead at halftime, but fresh
man Julia Burns scored just over a
minute into the second half to keep
the Card within one.
At that point, Northwestern
scored seven of the next eight
goals broken up by a Farr tally
for the Cardinal to take a con
trolling 13-6 lead with just under

eight minutes remaining. Burns
added two more scores in the final
seven minutes, but the Wildcats
put away the final two goals of the
game to wrap up the 15-8 win.
Stanford junior goalkeeper
Lyndsey Munoz made two saves
on the day.
Stanford, which won the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation to
earn a berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment, will return all but two play
ers from its current squad for the
2014 season.

over a stretch of 4:07 to tie the con
test with seven minutes remaining.
Two minutes later, Notre Dame's
Kaitlyn Brosco scored to give the
Irish its first lead since 1-0 early in
the first few minutes of the game.
But unlike in the first matchup,
the Cardinal had some more fight
left. Stanford won all three draw
controls remaining in the game to
spark a late run. First, Dikeou tied
the game when junior defender
Megan Lerner forced a key Notre
Dame turnover. Then, after Lern
er won the draw, Farr earned a
free-position shot and converted to
give the Cardinal its first-ever
NCAA Tournament victory.
"It's awesome to be able to ad
vance in the NCAA Tournament,"
Bokker told GoStanford.com after
the game. "We set our goals high
this season and it's something
we're really proud of."
The win earned Stanford an
other rematch, this time against
the Wildcats (18-2, 4-1 American
Lacrosse Conference), who defeat
ed the Cardinal 12-8 on April 14. In
this rematch, Stanford was unable
to pull off the upset as the Wild
cats' firepower proved too much.
Northwestern has won seven of
the past eight national champi
onships, including each of the last
three.
Stanford hung close through
halftime, but Northwestern pulled
away in the second half, in large
part by winning 12 of 14 draw con
trols in the period.

25 minutes into the game, the
score was tied 4-4 as sophomore
Kyle Eraser, junior Rachel Ozer
and freshmen Meg Lentz and
Lucy Dikeou each scored once to
match the Wildcats goal for goal.
Northwestern scored twice in the
final five minutes of the half to take
a 6-4 lead at halftime, but fresh
man Julia Burns scored just over a
minute into the second half to keep
the Card within one.
At that point, Northwestern
scored seven of the next eight
goals broken up by a Farr tally
for the Cardinal to take a con
trolling 13-6 lead with just under

eight minutes remaining. Burns
added two more scores in the final
seven minutes, but the Wildcats
put away the final two goals of the
game to wrap up the 15-8 win.
Stanford junior goalkeeper
Lyndsey Munoz made two saves
on the day.
Stanford, which won the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation to
earn a berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment, will return all but two play
ers from its current squad for the
2014 season.
