# Cardinal swept by Beavers
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
There is a talent gap in the Pac-12.
And for the first time in a few years,
Stanford is clearly on the wrong side
of it.
The Oregon State Beavers came
into Sunken Diamond and mercilessly
demonstrated why they are the class
of the conference, dominating the
Cardinal en route to a three-game
sweep to put Stanford's postseason
hopes in doubt.

The series got off to an ominous
start from the very first at-bat. Ore
gon State leadoff hitter lyier Smith
grounded to Stanford sophomore
third baseman Alex Blandino, but
Blandino's throw went all the way to
the wall, allowing Smith to advance to
third base. Smith scored on a ground
out two batters later.
The Cardinal briefly spotted sen
ior starting pitcher Mark Appel a lead
in the bottom of the fourth inning.
Four consecutive Stanford hitters

reached base, starting with a one-out
single from junior first baseman Bri
an Ragira and ending with a three-
RBI double from Blandino, to give
the Card a 3-1 lead.
But the lead was short-lived. In
the top of the fifth, Appel imploded,
giving up five runs on four walks, a hit
batsman and three hits to cough up
the lead for good.
The usually dominant Appel (8-4)
did not have his best stuff from the
beginning. The senior needed 103
pitches to get through five innings, al
lowing six runs five earned on
six hits and five walks with only four
strikeouts to take the loss.
The lone bright spot for Stanford,
besides the always impressive yearly
post-game fireworks display, was the
strong relief performance from soph
omore pitcher Jordan Kutzer. Kutzer
relieved Logan James with one out in
the seventh and was almost perfect
through the rest of the evening, allow
ing no runs on two hits in front of a
jam-packed crowd for Firework
Night.
"I didn't really notice that every
one was there," Kutzer said. "You're
into the game and you're just trying
to focus on getting ahead and getting
the win ... When I got in I didn't real

ly realize until the last inning that
there were 4,000 people in the
stands."
Saturday's contest, somehow,
proved to be even uglier, without a
performance like Kutzer's or fire
works to numb the pain.
Sophomore starting pitcher John
Hochstatter (3-3) took the loss thanks
to command problems, allowing four
runs all unearned due to a fielding
error from junior shortstop Lonnie
Kauppilaâ€”with two outs in the third
inning on two hits, three walks and
two very wild pitches.
That inning sucked all of the life
out of Sunken Diamond. The Beavers
continued to build their lead against
senior reliever Dean McArdle with
two runs unearned due to another
throwing error by Blandino in the
fourth and two more in the sixth to
make it 8-0.
Junior centerfielder Austin Wil
son put Stanford on the board with a
two-run homer in the sixth inning that
just stayed fair down the left field line,
but Oregon State added two runs in
the eighth to get the lead back up to
eight runs.

Junior centerfielder Austin Wilson (above) gave Stanford its first runs in the sixth inning with a two-run homer
against Oregon State on Saturday. The Card's failure to win a game puts its postseason prospects in doubt.
