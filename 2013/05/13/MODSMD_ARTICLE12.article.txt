# Cardinal swept by Beavers
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
There is a talent gap in the Pac-12.
And for the first time in a few years,
Stanford is clearly on the wrong side
of it.
The Oregon State Beavers came
into Sunken Diamond and mercilessly
demonstrated why they are the class
of the conference, dominating the
Cardinal en route to a three-game
sweep to put Stanford's postseason
hopes in doubt.

The series got off to an ominous
start from the very first at-bat. Ore
gon State leadoff hitter lyier Smith
grounded to Stanford sophomore
third baseman Alex Blandino, but
Blandino's throw went all the way to
the wall, allowing Smith to advance to
third base. Smith scored on a ground
out two batters later.
The Cardinal briefly spotted sen
ior starting pitcher Mark Appel a lead
in the bottom of the fourth inning.
Four consecutive Stanford hitters

reached base, starting with a one-out
single from junior first baseman Bri
an Ragira and ending with a three-
RBI double from Blandino, to give
the Card a 3-1 lead.
But the lead was short-lived. In
the top of the fifth, Appel imploded,
giving up five runs on four walks, a hit
batsman and three hits to cough up
the lead for good.
The usually dominant Appel (8-4)
did not have his best stuff from the
beginning. The senior needed 103
pitches to get through five innings, al
lowing six runs five earned on
six hits and five walks with only four
strikeouts to take the loss.
The lone bright spot for Stanford,
besides the always impressive yearly
post-game fireworks display, was the
strong relief performance from soph
omore pitcher Jordan Kutzer. Kutzer
relieved Logan James with one out in
the seventh and was almost perfect
through the rest of the evening, allow
ing no runs on two hits in front of a
jam-packed crowd for Firework
Night.
"I didn't really notice that every
one was there," Kutzer said. "You're
into the game and you're just trying
to focus on getting ahead and getting
the win ... When I got in I didn't real

ly realize until the last inning that
there were 4,000 people in the
stands."
Saturday's contest, somehow,
proved to be even uglier, without a
performance like Kutzer's or fire
works to numb the pain.
Sophomore starting pitcher John
Hochstatter (3-3) took the loss thanks
to command problems, allowing four
runs all unearned due to a fielding
error from junior shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila—with two outs in the third
inning on two hits, three walks and
two very wild pitches.
That inning sucked all of the life
out of Sunken Diamond. The Beavers
continued to build their lead against
senior reliever Dean McArdle with
two runs unearned due to another
throwing error by Blandino in the
fourth and two more in the sixth to
make it 8-0.
Junior centerfielder Austin Wil
son put Stanford on the board with a
two-run homer in the sixth inning that
just stayed fair down the left field line,
but Oregon State added two runs in
the eighth to get the lead back up to
eight runs.

against Oregon State on Saturday. The Card's failure to win a game puts its postseason prospects in doubt.
Doran homered to left field to lead off
the ninth and freshman shortstop
Drew Jackson knocked in junior
pinch hitter Brian Guymon to make
the final score 10-4.
On Sunday, the desperate Cardi
nal turned to junior pitcher Sam
Lindquist for the start. It was
Lindquist's 21st appearance of the
season, and 30th of his career, but his
first collegiate start. The big righty
allowed five runs on two hits and four
walks in four innings of work to take
the loss.
Trailing 5-0 after five innings,
Stanford showed signs of life for the
first time since early in Friday's con
test. Senior designated hitter Justin
Ringo and sophomore rightfielder
Austin Slater singled to lead off the
bottom of the sixth inning. Ragira
knocked in a run on a fielder's choice
and Wilson knocked in Ragira with a

single to right to cut the lead to three.
With senior relief pitcher Garrett
Hughes, sophomore reliever David
Schmidt and freshman reliever Lo
gan James combining for five score
less innings of relief, the Cardinal
bats had three more chances to fry to
tie or win the game.
In the eighth, Slater and Ragira
led off with walks to bring Wilson up
as the tying ran. The slugger deliv
ered an opposite-field RBI double to
put the tying runners in scoring posi
tion with nobody out. Junior second
baseman Danny Diekroeger hit into
a fielder's choice, but everyone was
safe after a throwing error.
Freshman catcher Austin Barr
grounded to third, forcing Wilson to
wait as Kavin Keyes forced
Diekroeger out at second. After the
throw, Wilson ran for home, but was
thrown out for a double play. Blandi
no struck out swinging to end the
threat and Stanford went down in or
der in the ninth to give the Beavers
the sweep.

Junior centerfielder Austin Wilson (above) gave Stanford its first runs in the sixth inning with a two-run homer
against Oregon State on Saturday. The Card's failure to win a game puts its postseason prospects in doubt.
Doran homered to left field to lead off
the ninth and freshman shortstop
Drew Jackson knocked in junior
pinch hitter Brian Guymon to make
the final score 10-4.
On Sunday, the desperate Cardi
nal turned to junior pitcher Sam
Lindquist for the start. It was
Lindquist's 21st appearance of the
season, and 30th of his career, but his
first collegiate start. The big righty
allowed five runs on two hits and four
walks in four innings of work to take
the loss.
Trailing 5-0 after five innings,
Stanford showed signs of life for the
first time since early in Friday's con
test. Senior designated hitter Justin
Ringo and sophomore rightfielder
Austin Slater singled to lead off the
bottom of the sixth inning. Ragira
knocked in a run on a fielder's choice
and Wilson knocked in Ragira with a

single to right to cut the lead to three.
With senior relief pitcher Garrett
Hughes, sophomore reliever David
Schmidt and freshman reliever Lo
gan James combining for five score
less innings of relief, the Cardinal
bats had three more chances to fry to
tie or win the game.
In the eighth, Slater and Ragira
led off with walks to bring Wilson up
as the tying ran. The slugger deliv
ered an opposite-field RBI double to
put the tying runners in scoring posi
tion with nobody out. Junior second
baseman Danny Diekroeger hit into
a fielder's choice, but everyone was
safe after a throwing error.
Freshman catcher Austin Barr
grounded to third, forcing Wilson to
wait as Kavin Keyes forced
Diekroeger out at second. After the
throw, Wilson ran for home, but was
thrown out for a double play. Blandi
no struck out swinging to end the
threat and Stanford went down in or
der in the ninth to give the Beavers
the sweep.
Stanford hosts Santa Clara Tues

There is a talent gap in the Pac-12.
And for the first time in a few years,
Stanford is clearly on the wrong side
of it.
The Oregon State Beavers came
into Sunken Diamond and mercilessly
demonstrated why they are the class
of the conference, dominating the
Cardinal en route to a three-game
sweep to put Stanford's postseason
hopes in doubt.

The series got off to an ominous
start from the very first at-bat. Ore
gon State leadoff hitter lyier Smith
grounded to Stanford sophomore
third baseman Alex Blandino, but
Blandino's throw went all the way to
the wall, allowing Smith to advance to
third base. Smith scored on a ground
out two batters later.
The Cardinal briefly spotted sen
ior starting pitcher Mark Appel a lead
in the bottom of the fourth inning.
Four consecutive Stanford hitters

reached base, starting with a one-out
single from junior first baseman Bri
an Ragira and ending with a three-
RBI double from Blandino, to give
the Card a 3-1 lead.
But the lead was short-lived. In
the top of the fifth, Appel imploded,
giving up five runs on four walks, a hit
batsman and three hits to cough up
the lead for good.
The usually dominant Appel (8-4)
did not have his best stuff from the
beginning. The senior needed 103
pitches to get through five innings, al
lowing six runs five earned on
six hits and five walks with only four
strikeouts to take the loss.
The lone bright spot for Stanford,
besides the always impressive yearly
post-game fireworks display, was the
strong relief performance from soph
omore pitcher Jordan Kutzer. Kutzer
relieved Logan James with one out in
the seventh and was almost perfect
through the rest of the evening, allow
ing no runs on two hits in front of a
jam-packed crowd for Firework
Night.
"I didn't really notice that every
one was there," Kutzer said. "You're
into the game and you're just trying
to focus on getting ahead and getting
the win ... When I got in I didn't real

ly realize until the last inning that
there were 4,000 people in the
stands."
Saturday's contest, somehow,
proved to be even uglier, without a
performance like Kutzer's or fire
works to numb the pain.
Sophomore starting pitcher John
Hochstatter (3-3) took the loss thanks
to command problems, allowing four
runs all unearned due to a fielding
error from junior shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila—with two outs in the third
inning on two hits, three walks and
two very wild pitches.
That inning sucked all of the life
out of Sunken Diamond. The Beavers
continued to build their lead against
senior reliever Dean McArdle with
two runs unearned due to another
throwing error by Blandino in the
fourth and two more in the sixth to
make it 8-0.
Junior centerfielder Austin Wil
son put Stanford on the board with a
two-run homer in the sixth inning that
just stayed fair down the left field line,
but Oregon State added two runs in
the eighth to get the lead back up to
eight runs.
