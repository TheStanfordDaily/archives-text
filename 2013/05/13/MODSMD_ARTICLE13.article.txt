## Cats take two out of three Card drops final season series 
### MICHAEL PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a wild conclusion to the
regular season on Saturday,
Arizona (32-24, 9-15 Pac-12)
defeated No. 13 Stanford
softball (37-19, 13-11 Pac-12)
4-3 in nine innings of play to
clinch the series victory. The
Wildcats also won 5-3 in
Thursday's contest while the
Cardinal came out on top 2-0
on Friday. The victory
marked the second straight
Pac-12 series taken by the
Wildcats, who also defeated
No. 5 Arizona State (45-10,
16-8 Pac-12) in the prior se
ries. Stanford had previously
swept its last two Pac-12 op
ponents before losing this
series.

After jumping out to the
early 2-0 lead in the bottom
of the first inning on a Kayla
Bonstrom triple, Stanford
surrendered a run in the
fifth and two runs in the
sixth to trail 3-2. Down to the
final out in the bottom of the
seventh, sophomore Leah
White hit an RBI double to
left field to knot the game at
three apiece. However, the
Wildcats would take the lead
for good off Chelsea
Goodacre's solo home run in
the ninth inning and the Car
dinal stranded the bases
loaded in the bottom half of
the inning.
Missed opportunities de
fined the two Cardinal losses
on the weekend, as Stanford
left the bases loaded three
times in the game on Thurs
day night and also saw soph

thrown out at the plate on a

single to left field. In Sunday's
game, the Cardinal outhit the Wild
cats 8-6, yet left 10 runners on base
over the course of the game.
Roulund and freshman Bon
strom performed well on the week
end, collecting four hits a piece
across the three games. Bonstrom
picked up 4 RBI as well and ended
the season with a team-best .414
batting average. Bonstrom also led
the team in slugging percentage,
on base percentage and doubles
and tied for the lead in RBI cul
minating in an extremely success
ful first season on the Farm.
Senior Jenna Rich went hitless
in her final regular season with the
Cardinal, but, nonetheless her sea
son capped off a spectacular career
that saw her set the Stanford all
time RBI record and finish second

all-time in home runs. She an
chored the middle of the Stanford
lineup, collecting a team-leading 12
home runs and tied for the team
lead with 51 RBI.
In addition, senior Teagan Ger
hart also wrapped up her Cardinal
regular season career on Saturday,
taking the loss despite scattering
six hits and a run over seven and
two-thirds innings. She finishes the
year with a 19-11 record and a 2.53
ERA, leading the Cardinal pitch
ing staff in wins and ERA.
Stanford will begin the quest
for its first College World Series
since 2004 by first playing in the
NCAA Lincoln Regional, struc
tured in the double-elimination for
mat. The Cardinal will be joined by
Tulsa, Northern lowa and the re
gional's host, Nebraska. Stanford
will face Tulsa Friday afternoon to
start the postseason.
