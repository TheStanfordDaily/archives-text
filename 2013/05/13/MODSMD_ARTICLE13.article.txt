## Cats take two out of three Card drops final season series 
### MICHAEL PETERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a wild conclusion to the
regular season on Saturday,
Arizona (32-24, 9-15 Pac-12)
defeated No. 13 Stanford
softball (37-19, 13-11 Pac-12)
4-3 in nine innings of play to
clinch the series victory. The
Wildcats also won 5-3 in
Thursday's contest while the
Cardinal came out on top 2-0
on Friday. The victory
marked the second straight
Pac-12 series taken by the
Wildcats, who also defeated
No. 5 Arizona State (45-10,
16-8 Pac-12) in the prior se
ries. Stanford had previously
swept its last two Pac-12 op
ponents before losing this
series.

After jumping out to the
early 2-0 lead in the bottom
of the first inning on a Kayla
Bonstrom triple, Stanford
surrendered a run in the
fifth and two runs in the
sixth to trail 3-2. Down to the
final out in the bottom of the
seventh, sophomore Leah
White hit an RBI double to
left field to knot the game at
three apiece. However, the
Wildcats would take the lead
for good off Chelsea
Goodacre's solo home run in
the ninth inning and the Car
dinal stranded the bases
loaded in the bottom half of
the inning.
Missed opportunities de
fined the two Cardinal losses
on the weekend, as Stanford
left the bases loaded three
times in the game on Thurs
day night and also saw soph
