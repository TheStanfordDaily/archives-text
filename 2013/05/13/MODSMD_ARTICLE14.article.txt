## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Quasi-Obituary: The Stanford Review 
### Miles Unterreiner 
The following is a public plea
for increased quality from, a
once-regular reader of the Re
view. This author feels that hav
ing a well-written, intellectual
ly informed conservative news
paper on campus is extremely
valuable, and that if the Review
continues to decline in quality,
Stanford will be the worse for it.
Campus was saddened Sunday
night to learn of the demise of
the formerly great Stanford
Review, which entered total irrele
vance recently after a long period of
decline. It was 26.
Birthed in 1987 by Pay Pal
founder and eventual Silicon Valley
giant Peter Thiel, the Review grew
up in a happily libertarian home,
weaned on Capitalism and Free
dom and Atlas Shrugged on tape.
A startlingly precocious child, the
Review spent its formative years
leading the charge against in
creased faculty and student diversi
ty, ultimately being forced to admit
defeat with the advent of the 21st
century.
Dark hints, however, emerged
early in the tumultuous life of the
paper, foreshadowing the outline of
the long fall to follow. Childhood
friends of the Review recall the pa
per's difficulty working and playing
well with other publications. "The
Review sometimes seemed like it
lived only to criticize other papers
and entities on campus," recalled
one anonymous student. "Its con
tent was basically written by finding
something someone else had al
ready said and saying the exact op
posite, just to prove it could."
Riding the annual wave of con
troversy created by student govern
ment elections, however, and under
the guidance of a pantheon of hard
driving editors-in-chief, the Review
eventually earned a position of cam
pus prominence and respect. Pro
viding a much-needed conservative
counterpoint to everyday campus
discourse and fostering pointed in
tellectual discussion on a biweekly
basis, the Review showed every
sign of having a bright future ahead
of it a bright future this writer, at
least, welcomed with open arms.
Sometime over the last year,
however, the paper began a down
ward spiral from which it would nev
er recover. Content level declined
precipitously. The once-vibrant blog,

Fiat Lux, ceased regular- updating,
occasionally jerking to life in fits and
starts to offer sparse commentary
on Stanford sporting events.
The Review's website lapsed in
to a discouraging stasis. Its front
page, as of Sunday night, boasted
keenly up-to-date coverage of Jor
dan Williamson and the Fiesta Bowl
and a recap of Stanford Football's
matchup with USC in 2011. Its last
five blog updates occurred on April
sth, March 6th, March Ist, Febru
ary 14th, and January 28th. The
most recently updated links appear
to be advertisements: "Large and
comfy bean bag sofas offered by The
Soothing Company." "A large selec
tion of wall fireplaces offered by
YentlessFireplacePros.com." "Stan
ford students can buy Cheap Cell
Phones and Makeup Brushes Prod
ucts on DHgate.com."
The final days of its fall were
marked not by kind farewells and
reminiscences, but by discord and
controversy. The end began auspi
ciously: A controversial opinions
piece targeting SOCC was put up,
taken down and put up again within
hours, temporarily returning the
Review to the mainstream of cam
pus conversation and, for one glori
ous moment, providing the paper's
editors with something, anything, to
talk about.
The revelation that a former

columnist had plagiarized several
articles nearly word-for-word, how
ever, was the final straw for the Re
view. Thinking that a major news
story was underway, The Daily ran
breaking coverage of the plagiarism
accusations, anticipating the start of
a significant campus controversy.
None was forthcoming, because
by this point, no one really cared
much. The Review's last headline

was a letter from its editor-in-chief
emeritus apologizing for not check
ing his writer's work. Tweets of the
article: 0. Facebook shares: 0. Com
ments: 1.
Reports began to surface Mon
day morning, however, that reports
of the Review's death had been
greatly exaggerated. Driven by a
desire to lift the Review from the
ashes of its irrelevance into the fires

of a new rebirth, Stanford conserva
tives and libertarians banded to
gether to improve the paper's con
tent, publish it more regularly, and
craft a Review worthy of the intel
lectual caliber of the Stanford politi
cal right.
At least, one can always hope.
