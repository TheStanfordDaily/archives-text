## TEDx event draws 700 attendees Second annual conference features 27 speakers and performers 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Approximately 700 people gathered at
Cemex Auditorium on Saturday for the
second annual TEDxStanford event, which
featured Stanford-affiliated speakers and
performers including football coach David
Shaw '94, Indian folk dance group Basmati
Raas and Rhodes Scholar Rachel Kolb 'l2
M.A. 'l3.
The five-hour event's 27 talks and per
formances revolved around the theme of
"research, reinvent and recreate," focusing
on topics from groundbreaking research
on multitasking to the process of designing
a sustainable house.
TEDx events are independently organ
ized but modeled after the nonprofit or
ganization TED, which annually hosts two
conferences at which according to the
TED website "the world's most fasci
nating thinkers and doers" give speeches
of 18 minutes or less.
The first TEDx Stanford event, hosted
last year by the Office of Public Affairs,
drew almost 600 attendees. Tickets for
this year's event became available online
on April 8 and sold out in less than 30 min
utes.
Director of Media Initiatives Melinda
Sacks '74, the conference's producer, said
she attempted to reach out
to departments and schools
across the University to find
speakers. While the Office of
Public Affairs will solicit feed
back about this year's
TEDxStanford through on
line surveys and monitoring
tweets, Sacks said that she
believes that the event lived
up to the hype.
"I heard people talking at
the break and everybody seems
very moved," Sacks said.
"What you hope is that people
walk out and continue to talk
about these topics and to think
about things differently"

Starting research early
The youngest speaker at
the event was Tara Adiseshan
'l3 M.A. 'l3, who will gradu
ate this spring at the age of
18. Adiseshan, who was home
schooled, began searching for
collegiate research opportuni
ties at age 12.
After seven months of
looking during which she
was repeatedly turned down
because of her age Adise
shan began working on a
project with endangered am
phibians at the Harris Lab
at James Madison Universi
ty, and she eventually pub
lished a paper detailing her
findings.
Adiseshan has since con
ducted research in the Tay
lor Lab at the University of
Virginia and the Hadly Lab

at Stanford, winning the
2009 Intel Young Scientist
award for her work in the
Taylor Lab.
"What I have learned
over the years is to see barri
ers that I thought existed
and ignore them," Adiseshan
said.
In an interview with The
Daily after the event, Adise
shan said that she wanted
her talk to convey the impor
tance of privileges, such as a
strong family support sys
tem, in motivating young
thinkers and researchers.
"We see certain things
like going to college early as
a sign of intelligence," Adise
shan said. "While they could
be interpreted as a sign, we
also need to be aware of the
privileges that come with be

ing born with the situations
that make things possible."
Reinventing Stanford football
Shaw gave a five-minute
speech about the history of
the Stanford football team,
focusing on the 2006 season
when the program lost
eleven of twelve games.
"Some people believed
that Stanford football is
hopeless, just like saying
that a shark couldn't fly,"
said Shaw, referring to an
earlier TEDxStanford talk
about an "air-swimming"
shark toy designed by Blake
English 'O9 M.S. 'lO.
In Shaw's two years as
head coach, the football team
has appeared in back-to-back
BCS Bowls and amassed an
overall record of 23-4. A two

time Pac-12 Coach of the
Year, Shaw most recently
guided the Cardinal to its
first Rose Bowl victory in
over four decades.
Though Shaw found suc
cess on the field, he said he
was focused on getting the
players to "take full advan
tage of the University" and
wanted to improve player
graduation rates.
"What I was told when I
graduated [from] Stanford
was that whatever you do, do
it extremely well so that you
can change the world," Shaw
said. "These things com
bined to give me the topic of
Stanford football changing
the world."
In an interview with The
Daily after his speech, Shaw
said that TEDxStanford was

different from many other
events he has spoken at be
cause of the audience's high
energy level.
"There is an energy at
TED talks which is hard to
explain," Shaw said. "[From]
every speaker, you can learn
something, and everyone is
doing something that other
people are not doing. There
is just this anticipation from
the audience like they can't
wait for the next speaker."
Tubbs on rejection and loss
The event also featured a
speech from Michael Tubbs
'l2 M.A. 'l2, who ran for City
Council in his hometown of
Stockton, Calif, earlier this
year. He is just the third
politician to be endorsed by
Oprah Winfrey after Pres
ident Barack Obama and
Newark Mayor Cory Booker
'9l M.A. '92 and was
elected with over 60 percent
of the vote.
Tubbs is also a Truman
Scholar, a former president of
the Stanford NAACP chap
ter and a recipient of the
Dinkelspiel Award, an honor
that recognizes exceptional
contributions to undergradu
ate education or the quality of
student life at Stanford.
After growing up with a
single mother and incarcer
ated father, Tubbs founded
The Phoenix Scholars, a non
profit organization aiming to
help young people become
the first in their families to
go to college.
Tubbs referenced his re
jection from a fellowship that
he applied to during his jun
ior year, the loss of a cousin
while Tubbs was participat
ing in the Stanford in Wash
ington Program and the re
cent death of a friend as ex
periences that helped him
reevaluate his career path
and realize what he wanted
to accomplish with his life.
"When my friend passed,
it reminded me of all the oth
er low points that trans
formed me into being a city
councilor," Tubbs said. "To
get to those mountain-top
experiences, we have to go
through the valleys."
