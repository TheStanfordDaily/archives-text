Approximately 700 people gathered at
Cemex Auditorium on Saturday for the
second annual TEDxStanford event, which
featured Stanford-affiliated speakers and
performers including football coach David
Shaw '94, Indian folk dance group Basmati
Raas and Rhodes Scholar Rachel Kolb 'l2
M.A. 'l3.
The five-hour event's 27 talks and per
formances revolved around the theme of
"research, reinvent and recreate," focusing
on topics from groundbreaking research
on multitasking to the process of designing
a sustainable house.
TEDx events are independently organ
ized but modeled after the nonprofit or
ganization TED, which annually hosts two
conferences at which according to the
TED website "the world's most fasci
nating thinkers and doers" give speeches
of 18 minutes or less.
The first TEDx Stanford event, hosted
last year by the Office of Public Affairs,
drew almost 600 attendees. Tickets for
this year's event became available online
on April 8 and sold out in less than 30 min
utes.
