The Business Association of Stanford
Entrepreneurial Students (BASES)
awarded $150,000 to 14 startups on Friday
in the finale of a multi-round entrepreneur
ial competition that began in January.
Teams entered the group's 150K Chal

E-Challenge), the Entrepreneur ship Chal

lenge (E-Challenge) and the Product
Showcase. BASES received 96 entries for
the E-Challenge, 41 entries for the Social
E-Challenge and 81 entries for the Product
Showcase.
Product Showcase
The Product Showcase competition was
open only to Stanford-affiliated entrepre
neurs, and participants applied to the pro
gram with products they had already cre
ated. The BASES team selected a group of

finalists to demonstrate their prototypes at
the finale.
"It's like a science fan- on steroids," said
Zineb Laraki 'l2 M.S. 'l3, vice president of
external relations at BASES. "It is very
product- and idea-driven."
More than 50 companies presented
their products at the Product Showcase, in
cluding Auralyze, an acoustic modeling
firm founded by Charles Mbatia 'l3, An-
drew Tener 'l3, Konstantine
Buhler 'l4 and Jonathan Abel
M.S. 'B4 Ph.D. 'B9, a consult
ing professor of music.
Auralyze's co-founders
voiced them appreciation for
the opportunity provided by
the showcase to reach a
broad network of potential in
vestors.
"I think the BASES pro
gram is fantastic they
have given Auralyze away to
show our technology to a
large group of investors and
we are already rapidly gain
ing interest," Buhler said.
The top Product Show
case prize and $20,000 went
to ALICE, an artificial intelli
gence product that reduces
the amount of time necessary
to schedule a construction
project. Stratio came in sec
ond place, winning $15,000,
and Flamestower took third
and the $lO,OOO prize. Med-
Able and Refresh tied for
fourth place, with each re
ceiving $2,500.
E-Challenges
The Social Entrepreneur

ship Challenge showcased
novel ideas in social innova
tion and technology, while the
Entrepreneurship Challenge
featured companies with
products in a wider range of
markets.

According to Laraki, both
E-Challenges were business
model competitions. En
trants went through several
rounds of judging and men
torship before six companies
from the Social E-Challenge

and nine companies from the
E-Challenge were selected as
finalists.
In the Social E-Challenge,
Anjna Patient Education, a
non-profit focused on inform
ing patients about their

health conditions using text
messaging and voice technol
ogy, received the top prize
and $25,000. Adapt Air won
$15,000 as runner-up, and
Flamestower and Vynca won
$5,000 apiece in third place.
Vineet Singal 'l2, co
founder of Anjna Patient Ed
ucation, said that the compe
tition provided valuable expe
rience in presenting to and
networking with potential in
vestors.
"I think that for me it was
a great experience to have a
public presentation, because
it is important for us to be
able to tailor one pitch to dif
ferent audiences," Singal re
flected.
In the E-Challenge,
AWAIR took home the top
prize of $25,000, with Resido
Medical winning $12,500 for
second place. Third place and
$7,500 went to Cinder√üio,
and ChemoFilter and AL
ICE tied for fourth place, re
ceiving $2,500 each.
Matthew Goodyear 'l2
M.S. 'l4, co-president of
BASES, described this
year's finalists as especially
talented and noted that the
competition had attracted
more medical, healthcare
and information technology
companies than in previous

years.
"They seem to get better
every year," he said. "I think
they're all good they had
to get through three rounds."
Keynote speech
At the end of the event,
attendees heard a speech
from keynote speaker Steven
Vassallo M.S. '95 M.B.A. 'O4.
A general partner at Founda
tion Capital, Vassallo encour
aged student entrepreneurs
to clearly identify the prob
lem they are trying to solve
with their companies.
Vassallo also discussed
the changes occurring in the
startup world, and men
tioned a "troubling pattern"
he has recently seen in the
Stanford graduates he re
cruits and hires.
"Too many folks are not
willing to take the less grand
responsibilities," he said.
"Too many people want to be
CEOs before they slay their
first dragon. This prevents
you from standing out, from
being the hero who slays the
dragon. You've got plenty of
time to be the CEO. Now is
the time to be the heroic
young dragon slayer."
