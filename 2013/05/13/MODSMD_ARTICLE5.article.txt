# ORL keeps interfaith fellowships
## Programs aim to bring religious groups together 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Office for Religious Life (ORL) will again offer two
fellowships next year in an ongoing effort to build connec
tions between various religious and spiritual groups on
campus.
According to Dean of Religious Life Reverend Scotty
McLennan, teaching students how to understand others'
beliefs is crttical in training students for positions of global
leadership.
"We need to graduate people from Stanford ideally
it would be every Stanford student—who understand the
power and role of religion in the world and are able to help
people talk across differences," McLennan emphasized.
The two fellowships aim to contribute to interfaith dia
logue in different ways. The Interfaith Fellowship, which
offers a $4,000 stipend, selects two students to support in
terfaith programming in conjunction with the ORL, while
the Rathbun Fellowship for Religious Encounter (FRE),
which grants a $5OO stipend, creates a weekly discussion
space for up to 16 students.
Senior Associate Dean for Religious Life Rabbi Patri
cia Karlin-Neumann described the FRE fellowship as an
opportunity for people from different religious communi
ties to "get to know one another, develop trust and learn
about one another's religious experiences."
Karlin-Neumann said that the significance of religious
diversity—in relation to people's values can often be
understated or misunderstood, and the fellowship is in
tended to overcome that.
"Part of what we're able to do in the fellowship is build
up enough trust to have some hard conversations and to
understand perspectives that, in too many settings, we ei
ther don't hear or can disregard or discount," Karlin-Neu
mann said.
Current fellow Kasiemobi Udo-okoye 'l5 said that her
group has discussed topics like race, religion and, in the
wake of the recent Boston bombings, how violence affects
people emotionally and spiritually
Karlin-Neumann said the fellowship has helped people
with diametrically opposed viewpoints develop an appreci
ation for one another. She recalled an occasion in which two
FRE fellows participated in competing demonstrations in
White Plaza and then, after the rallies were over, put down
their placards and hugged.
"To me, that was a real manifestation of FRE," Karlin-
Neumann said.
Udo-okoye said that the fellowship has provided her
with the opportunity to remove herself from the constant
pressures of everyday life at
Stanford, giving her time and
space to reflect.
"It's taught me that it's im
portant to step back and evalu
ate myself, who I am and
where I'm going especially
thinking of myself within the
larger community," Udo-okoye
reflected.
According to the ORL web
site, fellows are required to
make two presentations to the
campus community during the
year. Karlin-Neumann also
said many fellows bring the
lessons learned from discus
sions into other areas of cam
pus, citing a student-initiated
course RELIGST 28SI: In
terfaith@Noon, sponsored by
one current and two former
fellows as an example.
The Interfaith Fellowship,
on the other hand, is specifical
ly intended to facilitate events
and programs that foster rela
tionships between different
communities. McLennan said
that the Interfaith Fellowship

was established two years ago
because the ORL felt that
there were inadequate connec
tions among the 34 different
Stanford Associated Religions
(SAR).
"They were all understand
ably concerned about trying to
further their own tradition,"
McLennan said. "We felt by
hiring these interfaith fellows,
we could stimulate more pro
gramming and help people re
late to each other better."
McLennan said there is no
religious affiliation needed to
become a fellow as long as an
applicant exhibits a passion
for promoting interfaith dia
logue. Programming includes
collaborative community serv
ice projects, joint worship
services and events that repre
sent people from various back
grounds.
As an example, McLennan
cited an event put on by the
Hindu community this winter

that invited people from all re
ligious traditions to present
music, poetry or speeches in
Memorial Church. He noted
there are often multi-faith or
intei'faith worship services
during holidays or campus
events like Parents' Weekend.
Current fellow Chase Ishii
'l3 said the position has ex
posed him to a wide variety of
backgrounds and traditions.
"A lot of times people get
too caught up in the categories
and the labels of a religion and
forget that there's a universal
humanity that underlies all
these different things," Ishii
said. "Getting to really learn
about other religions is just an
other way to understand a per
son's humanity"

2014 Intei'faith Fellowship

It taught me that it's important to
step back and evaluate myself.
