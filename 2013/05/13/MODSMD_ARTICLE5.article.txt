# ORL keeps interfaith fellowships
## Programs aim to bring religious groups together 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Office for Religious Life (ORL) will again offer two
fellowships next year in an ongoing effort to build connec
tions between various religious and spiritual groups on
campus.
According to Dean of Religious Life Reverend Scotty
McLennan, teaching students how to understand others'
beliefs is crttical in training students for positions of global
leadership.
"We need to graduate people from Stanford ideally
it would be every Stanford student—who understand the
power and role of religion in the world and are able to help
people talk across differences," McLennan emphasized.
The two fellowships aim to contribute to interfaith dia

offers a $4,000 stipend, selects two students to support in

the Rathbun Fellowship for Religious Encounter (FRE),
which grants a $5OO stipend, creates a weekly discussion
space for up to 16 students.
Senior Associate Dean for Religious Life Rabbi Patri

about one another's religious experiences."
Karlin-Neumann said that the significance of religious
diversity—in relation to people's values can often be
understated or misunderstood, and the fellowship is in

understand perspectives that, in too many settings, we ei
ther don't hear or can disregard or discount," Karlin-Neu
mann said.
Current fellow Kasiemobi Udo-okoye 'l5 said that her
group has discussed topics like race, religion and, in the
wake of the recent Boston bombings, how violence affects
people emotionally and spiritually
Karlin-Neumann said the fellowship has helped people
with diametrically opposed viewpoints develop an appreci
ation for one another. She recalled an occasion in which two
FRE fellows participated in competing demonstrations in
White Plaza and then, after the rallies were over, put down
their placards and hugged.
"To me, that was a real manifestation of FRE," Karlin-
Neumann said.
Udo-okoye said that the fellowship has provided her
with the opportunity to remove herself from the constant
