## Knight Fellow relates power of journalism 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Musikilu Mojeed, his passion for
journalism began in high school, when the
John S. Knight Journalism Fellow wrote an
article about teachers whipping students
for leaving the school through a hole in the
fence surrounding the school and then leav
ing through the same hole themselves.
When the article identifying specific
teachers —was published in the school
newspaper, Mojeed was forced to go under
ground for some time to avoid punishment
from the angry teachers. Eventually, the
principal held a staff meeting and ordered
the teachers to stop victimizing Mojeed and
to set a better example by no longer using
that exit.
"I saw that journalism was a powerful
point to push for change," Mojeed said.
Having been born and raised in the
small agrarian town of Iwo, Nigeria, Mo
jeed stressed his humble origins.
"We didn't have a TV or radio," Mojeed
said. "I wondered how we survived, be
cause we depended on one stream in the vil
lage ... we ate good food because my father
was a farmer."
Mojeed began primary school in a gov
ernment-funded school ten kilometers from
his village. He said he was lucky to attend
the school, even though it was far from his
home.
"My mother dressed me up in the best
clothes I had," Mojeed recalled.
After primary school, Mojeed's
uncle returned from his posting in
another part of the country and de
cided that Mojeed, whom he
thought was unusually bright,
needed to receive an education at a
better school.
In high school, Mojeed was ini
tially interested in engineering. Af
ter becoming president of the press
club that published his article about
the teachers' offenses, however, he
realized his passion for journalism
and channeled that interest into cul
tivating a reputation for the club.

"We wrote about examination
malpractices, bullying of juniors by
seniors... stories about affairs be
tween female students and male
students... a story about students
urinating anywhere on campus,"
Mojeed said. "People were scared
when a member of the press club
was around... If you did something
wrong, we wrote about it."
"We were correcting a lot of
things that were wrong," he added.
"I started realizing how powerful
journalism could be."
Mojeed subsequently attended
the University of Uyo in Nigeria,
where he completed his undergradu
ate degree in Communication Arts
and remained very active as a cam
pus journalist. After graduating, he
worked at a number of Nigerian
newspapers before settling at the

Premium Times, where he now
works as the managing editor.
During his journalistic career,
Mojeed focused on uncovering cor
ruption, trafficking and human
rights violations, abuses that extend
ed to the highest reaches of the
Nigerian government. In one in
stance, Mojeed investigated the Hal
liburton bribery scam in which
Nigerian officials took bribes from
companies in exchange for allowing
them to build on Nigerian land
and uncovered the corruption in
volved in the transaction.
"I exposed the former president
of Nigeria, and the present presi
dent, who was his deputy, for keep
ing 17 ambulances to themselves in
the presidential village," Mojeed
added. "Some of the hospitals [in the
country] have only one ambulance. I

exposed the presence of those ambu
lances packed in the presidential vil
lage, whereas people were dying be
cause there were no ambulances ...
Once we exposed that, the ambu
lances disappeared from the presi
dential village."
Mojeed also exposed a respected
Nigerian scientist who lied about
helping to invent the Internet, as
well as several state government of
ficials including one currently im
prisoned in the UK for corrup
tion.
"Many [Nigerian] officials are ex
cited that I'm out of Nigeria," Mo
jeed said.
While Mojeed's work has won
him many awards, including the Ed
itor's Courage Award from the Fo
rum for African Investigative Re
porters (FAIR), the Wole Soyinka

Investigative Reporting Award and
the Celebrity Media Award, it has al
so prompted threats and harass
ment.
"I was severely harassed in 2011
by [the] police about a story involv
ing officials in the administration
getting bribes from people import
ing into the country," Mojeed said.
"I exposed it with video and audio
evidence. The police harassed me
and I had to go underground...
Even though the stories are uncom
fortable for some people, it is diffi
cult for authorities to fight my re
porting [because] I try to be as ac
curate as possible."
Mojeed said distrust of his work
extends beyond government and
the police to society at large.
"I have very few friends because
I don't know who to trust," he said.
"I fear for my life but just feel that
it's a job that must be done, espe
cially in a country that is very rich
but where people are still very
poor."
Mojeed said he was flattered to
receive a Knight Fellowship. The
program brings about 20 journal
ists to Stanford every year.
"They come here to create
things that could help journalism,
interact with the campus, all of
that," Mojeed said. "I feel very
lucky to be selected. I am the only
fellow selected from Africa in my
class of 2013."
At Stanford, Mojeed has worked
on the IMOLE project, a platform
connecting investigative journalists
in Nigeria with resources and docu
ments that authorities would prefer
to keep hidden and private. "Imole"
means transparency or light in Mo
jeed's native Yoruba language.
"I am trying to point journalists
reporting on Nigeria in directions
where they can get information about
Nigeria," Mojeed explained.
Mojeed stressed the importance
of investigative journalism in main
taining a healthy, transparent society.
"I believe that every type of
journalism should be investigative,"
he said. "As long as you go under
the surface, dig out the facts, all
journalism, whatever you're report
ing 0n... make it investigative."

said. "I wondered how we survived, be
cause we depended on one stream in the vil
lage ... we ate good food because my father
was a farmer."
Mojeed began primary school in a gov
ernment-funded school ten kilometers from
his village. He said he was lucky to attend
the school, even though it was far from his
home.
"My mother dressed me up in the best
clothes I had," Mojeed recalled.
After primary school, Mojeed's
uncle returned from his posting in
another part of the country and de
cided that Mojeed, whom he
thought was unusually bright,
needed to receive an education at a
better school.
In high school, Mojeed was ini
tially interested in engineering. Af
ter becoming president of the press
club that published his article about
the teachers' offenses, however, he
realized his passion for journalism
and channeled that interest into cul
tivating a reputation for the club.

"We wrote about examination
malpractices, bullying of juniors by
seniors... stories about affairs be
tween female students and male
students... a story about students
urinating anywhere on campus,"
Mojeed said. "People were scared
when a member of the press club
was around... If you did something
wrong, we wrote about it."
"We were correcting a lot of
things that were wrong," he added.
"I started realizing how powerful
journalism could be."
Mojeed subsequently attended
the University of Uyo in Nigeria,
where he completed his undergradu
ate degree in Communication Arts
and remained very active as a cam
pus journalist. After graduating, he
worked at a number of Nigerian
newspapers before settling at the

Premium Times, where he now
works as the managing editor.
During his journalistic career,
Mojeed focused on uncovering cor
ruption, trafficking and human
rights violations, abuses that extend
ed to the highest reaches of the
Nigerian government. In one in
stance, Mojeed investigated the Hal
liburton bribery scam in which
Nigerian officials took bribes from
companies in exchange for allowing
them to build on Nigerian land
and uncovered the corruption in
volved in the transaction.
"I exposed the former president
of Nigeria, and the present presi
dent, who was his deputy, for keep
ing 17 ambulances to themselves in
the presidential village," Mojeed
added. "Some of the hospitals [in the
country] have only one ambulance. I

exposed the presence of those ambu
lances packed in the presidential vil
lage, whereas people were dying be
cause there were no ambulances ...
Once we exposed that, the ambu
lances disappeared from the presi
dential village."
Mojeed also exposed a respected
Nigerian scientist who lied about
helping to invent the Internet, as
well as several state government of
ficials including one currently im
prisoned in the UK for corrup
tion.
"Many [Nigerian] officials are ex
cited that I'm out of Nigeria," Mo
jeed said.
While Mojeed's work has won
him many awards, including the Ed
itor's Courage Award from the Fo
rum for African Investigative Re
porters (FAIR), the Wole Soyinka

Investigative Reporting Award and
the Celebrity Media Award, it has al
so prompted threats and harass
ment.
"I was severely harassed in 2011
by [the] police about a story involv
ing officials in the administration
getting bribes from people import
ing into the country," Mojeed said.
"I exposed it with video and audio
evidence. The police harassed me
and I had to go underground...
Even though the stories are uncom
fortable for some people, it is diffi
cult for authorities to fight my re
porting [because] I try to be as ac
curate as possible."
Mojeed said distrust of his work
extends beyond government and
the police to society at large.
"I have very few friends because
I don't know who to trust," he said.
"I fear for my life but just feel that
it's a job that must be done, espe
cially in a country that is very rich
but where people are still very
poor."
Mojeed said he was flattered to
receive a Knight Fellowship. The
program brings about 20 journal
ists to Stanford every year.
"They come here to create
things that could help journalism,
interact with the campus, all of
that," Mojeed said. "I feel very
lucky to be selected. I am the only
fellow selected from Africa in my
class of 2013."
At Stanford, Mojeed has worked
on the IMOLE project, a platform
connecting investigative journalists
in Nigeria with resources and docu
ments that authorities would prefer
to keep hidden and private. "Imole"
means transparency or light in Mo
jeed's native Yoruba language.
"I am trying to point journalists
reporting on Nigeria in directions
where they can get information about
Nigeria," Mojeed explained.
Mojeed stressed the importance
of investigative journalism in main
taining a healthy, transparent society.
"I believe that every type of
journalism should be investigative,"
he said. "As long as you go under
the surface, dig out the facts, all
journalism, whatever you're report
ing 0n... make it investigative."

For Musikilu Mojeed, his passion for
journalism began in high school, when the
John S. Knight Journalism Fellow wrote an
article about teachers whipping students
for leaving the school through a hole in the
fence surrounding the school and then leav
ing through the same hole themselves.
When the article identifying specific
teachers —was published in the school
newspaper, Mojeed was forced to go under
ground for some time to avoid punishment
from the angry teachers. Eventually, the
principal held a staff meeting and ordered
the teachers to stop victimizing Mojeed and
to set a better example by no longer using
that exit.
"I saw that journalism was a powerful
point to push for change," Mojeed said.
Having been born and raised in the
small agrarian town of Iwo, Nigeria, Mo
jeed stressed his humble origins.
"We didn't have a TV or radio," Mojeed
said. "I wondered how we survived, be
