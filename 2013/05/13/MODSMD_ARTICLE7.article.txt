### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR

overtime and the fifth overtime
period overall.

Stanford led for the majority
of the game before USC put to
gether a furious comeback late in

the second half. After the Women

overtime.
Stanford had the better scor

Freshman Maggie Steffens (above) ended her first campaign on the Farm with two goals in the Card's 10-9 loss to USC. She finshed
the season with 60 goals, second only to senior Melissa Siedemann, and was ranked 10th in the nation with 1.86 goals per game.
saves ultimately proved to be the
difference.
The Cardinal reached the final
game by crushing lona 20-3 in the
first round of the tournament and
then sliding past UCLA 5-3 in the
semifinals to set up a fourth meet
ing with the Trojans this season.
Coming into the game, USC had
won two of three previous meetings,
including an 11-7 victory in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) Tournament Final on April
28.
Before the weekend, Stanford
head coach John Tanner had said
that getting off to a quick start
would be key for his team. The Car
dinal took that message to heart in
the championship game as they
broke out to a 3-0 lead early in the
second quarter behind goals from
freshman Maggie Steffens, senior
Melissa Seidemann and junior Ka
ley Dodson.
Early in the game, Stanford's
defense completely stifled USC's
attack and allowed very few clean
looks at goal. When shots did get

through, senior goalkeeper Kate
Baldoni, who made 11 saves on the
day, was there to keep the ball out of
the net.
The Women of Troy finally got
on the scoreboard on a 6-on-5 op
portunity with 6:05 remaining in the
first half and then added a second
goal a minute later when USC's
Nicolina McCall backhanded a shot
past Baldoni. After Stanford sopho
more Kiley Neushul put away an
outside shot, USC's Madeline
Rosenthal took advantage of anoth
er power play opportunity to make
the score 4-3 going into halftime.
The back-and-forth action con
tinued after the break as the Cardi
nal maintained the lead but was un
able to pull away. Dodson and Sei
demann both scored in the third
quarter, but after each tally USC
junior Hannah Buckling who had
a game-high five goals answered
to keep USC within one.
Stanford clung to its 6-5 lead
deep into the fourth quarter until
Buckling came up big once again.
With just under two minutes to go
in the game and two seconds on the
shot clock, the junior skipped a long
shot past Baldoni to tie the game
for the first time since 0-0.
USC capped off the comeback
when Espar scored to give USC a 7-
6 lead with just 45 seconds remain
ing the game the first time the
Trojans had led all game.
On the ensuing possession, the
Cardinal drew an exclusion and
coach John Tanner called timeout.
Junior Annika Dries had the first
attempt for Stanford, but Bolonyai
made a huge save to preserve the
lead. The Cardinal maintained pos

session and worked the ball inside
to Grossman, who poked it past
Bolonyai to keep Stanford's hopes
alive.
NCAA rules dictate that once
teams enter overtime, they will play
two three-minute periods regard
less of score. If the game is still tied
after the guaranteed six minutes,
then sudden death comes into play.
USC scored to open overtime,
but Steffens added her second goal
with 10 seconds remaining in the
first period. Dodson, who won all
eight sprints on the day, gave the
Cardinal possession to open the sec
ond period and Stanford took ad
vantage when Seidemann put away
her third goal of the game to give
the Cardinal a 9-8 lead.
But another Stanford exclusion
gave USC the chance to tie and
Buckling capitalized once again to
even the game with 55 seconds to
go.
Both defenses locked down as
they entered sudden-death over
time. Stanford continually forced
USC into turnovers or weak at
tempts at goal, but was unable to
take advantage at the other end. In
the second sudden-death period,
USC had close to a minute of sus
tained possession but Baldoni and
her defense stood tall. When the
Cardinal finally got the ball, Seide
mann fired two rockets that hit the
crossbar and stayed out.
In the fifth period of overtime,
the Cardinal seemed to be on the
verge of breaking through as Seide
mann, Dries and Steffens all had
good looks at goal, but Bolonyai
came up big time and time again to
keep the ball out.
After more than 45 minutes of
play, Espar finally ended the game
by placing an outside shot past Bal
doni, off the crossbar and down into
the net, and with that, the Cardi
nal's hopes of a three-peat were ex
tinguished.
Although the Cardinal only lost
three games all year, a team that
was billed as potentially one of the
best teams in collegiate water polo
history ends the season in disap
pointment after failing to capture
either the conference or the nation
al title.
The loss also puts the Stanford
athletic program's record of 36
straight years with a national cham
pionship at risk. The Cardinal has
yet to win an NCAA title in 2012-13
the synchronized swimming na
tional title came from U.S. Colle
giate competition and many ob
servers believed that the women's
water polo team was Stanford's last
legitimate chance at earning a
championship this year.

after the guaranteed six minutes,
then sudden death comes into play.
USC scored to open overtime,
but Steffens added her second goal
with 10 seconds remaining in the
first period. Dodson, who won all
eight sprints on the day, gave the
Cardinal possession to open the sec
ond period and Stanford took ad
vantage when Seidemann put away
her third goal of the game to give
the Cardinal a 9-8 lead.
But another Stanford exclusion
gave USC the chance to tie and
Buckling capitalized once again to
even the game with 55 seconds to
go.
Both defenses locked down as
they entered sudden-death over
time. Stanford continually forced
USC into turnovers or weak at
tempts at goal, but was unable to
take advantage at the other end. In
the second sudden-death period,
USC had close to a minute of sus
tained possession but Baldoni and
her defense stood tall. When the
Cardinal finally got the ball, Seide
mann fired two rockets that hit the
crossbar and stayed out.
In the fifth period of overtime,
the Cardinal seemed to be on the
verge of breaking through as Seide
mann, Dries and Steffens all had
good looks at goal, but Bolonyai
came up big time and time again to
keep the ball out.
After more than 45 minutes of
play, Espar finally ended the game
by placing an outside shot past Bal
doni, off the crossbar and down into
the net, and with that, the Cardi
nal's hopes of a three-peat were ex
tinguished.
Although the Cardinal only lost
three games all year, a team that
was billed as potentially one of the
best teams in collegiate water polo
history ends the season in disap
pointment after failing to capture
either the conference or the nation
al title.
The loss also puts the Stanford
athletic program's record of 36
straight years with a national cham
pionship at risk. The Cardinal has
yet to win an NCAA title in 2012-13
the synchronized swimming na
tional title came from U.S. Colle
giate competition and many ob
servers believed that the women's
water polo team was Stanford's last
legitimate chance at earning a
championship this year.

vious two national titles, but the
chance at a three-peat ended
abruptly when USC freshmen

Anni Espar fired home a shot in
the third period of sudden-death
overtime and the fifth overtime
period overall.

Stanford led for the majority
of the game before USC put to
gether a furious comeback late in

the second half. After the Women
of Troy took their first lead in the
final minute, Stanford sophomore
Ashley Grossman scored with 12
seconds left in the game to force
overtime.
Stanford had the better scor
ing opportunities throughout the
game, but USC's efficiency on the

saves ultimately proved to be the
difference.
The Cardinal reached the final
game by crushing lona 20-3 in the
first round of the tournament and
then sliding past UCLA 5-3 in the
semifinals to set up a fourth meet
ing with the Trojans this season.
Coming into the game, USC had
won two of three previous meetings,
including an 11-7 victory in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) Tournament Final on April
28.
Before the weekend, Stanford
head coach John Tanner had said
that getting off to a quick start
would be key for his team. The Car
dinal took that message to heart in
the championship game as they
broke out to a 3-0 lead early in the
second quarter behind goals from
freshman Maggie Steffens, senior
Melissa Seidemann and junior Ka
ley Dodson.
Early in the game, Stanford's
defense completely stifled USC's
attack and allowed very few clean
looks at goal. When shots did get

through, senior goalkeeper Kate
Baldoni, who made 11 saves on the
day, was there to keep the ball out of
the net.
The Women of Troy finally got
on the scoreboard on a 6-on-5 op
portunity with 6:05 remaining in the
first half and then added a second
goal a minute later when USC's
Nicolina McCall backhanded a shot
past Baldoni. After Stanford sopho
more Kiley Neushul put away an
outside shot, USC's Madeline
Rosenthal took advantage of anoth
er power play opportunity to make
the score 4-3 going into halftime.
The back-and-forth action con
tinued after the break as the Cardi
nal maintained the lead but was un
able to pull away. Dodson and Sei
demann both scored in the third
quarter, but after each tally USC
junior Hannah Buckling who had
a game-high five goals answered
to keep USC within one.
Stanford clung to its 6-5 lead
deep into the fourth quarter until
Buckling came up big once again.
With just under two minutes to go
in the game and two seconds on the
shot clock, the junior skipped a long
shot past Baldoni to tie the game
for the first time since 0-0.
USC capped off the comeback
when Espar scored to give USC a 7-
6 lead with just 45 seconds remain
ing the game the first time the
Trojans had led all game.
On the ensuing possession, the
Cardinal drew an exclusion and
coach John Tanner called timeout.
Junior Annika Dries had the first
attempt for Stanford, but Bolonyai
made a huge save to preserve the
lead. The Cardinal maintained pos

session and worked the ball inside
to Grossman, who poked it past
Bolonyai to keep Stanford's hopes
alive.

teams enter overtime, they will play
