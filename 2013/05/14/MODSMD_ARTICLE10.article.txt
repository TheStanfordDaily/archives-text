# Card sweeps twice, ready for Trojans
## 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team
breezed through the first two rounds of
the NCAA Tournament this weekend,
sweeping Miami (OH) (13-13,7-1 MAC) in
the first round and registering another
shutout the following day against No. 22
Rice (21-5,2-1 Conference USA). The No.
12 Cardinal (184, 8-2 PAC-12) will get a
chance at revenge this Friday against Pac
-12 champion No. 5 Southern California in
the Round of 16.

Stanford made quick work of the Red-
Hawks in the first round. The duo of sen
ior Stacey Tan and sophomore Ellen Tsay
blew past Nimisha Mohan and Alix Thur
man 8-0 on Court No. 2 in doubles. Junior
co-captains Nicole Gibbs and Kristie Ahn
then captured an 8-2 victory over Chris
tine Guerrazzi and Ana Rajkovic on Court
No. 1 to secure the doubles point.
Entering singles play with momen

turn, the women delivered three crashing
defeats to clinch the match 4-0. Tan fin
ished first with a dominant 6-0, 6-1 win
over Guerrazzi. Gibbs' 6-1, 6-0 victory
over Mohan came next before Tsay
clinched the match 6-0,6-1 over Rajkovic.
"I think the quote 'to fear no one, but
respect everyone' couldn't have been
more relevant this weekend," Ahn said.
"Just because Miami (OH) is a small name
in tennis doesn't mean they can't have a
big impact."
The Cardinal didn't even have a full
day's rest before its second-round match
against Rice on Saturday. Rice, who bare
ly slid past Pepperdine 4-3 the day before,
fell quickly to the Cardinal.
Tan and Tsay cashed in another shut
out over Katie Gater and Liat Zimmer
mann on Court No. 2 to kick off the match.
Once again, the eighth-ranked nationally
pairing of Gibbs and Ahn prevailed as
well, capturing an 8-4 victory over Natalie
Beazant and Dominique Harmath to
clinch the doubles point.
In singles, it was the three co-captains
who put up quick victories. Gibbs defeated
Beazant 6-2,6-2 while Ahn beat Harmath

Junior Kristie Ahn (above) went a combined 3-0 in singles and doubles as
Stanford swept Miami (OH) and Rice to advance to the Round of 16 at the
NCAA Tournament. The Cardinal lost only 19 total games over the weekend.
64, 6-2 to put the Cardinal on
the brink of advancing. Senior
Natalie Dillon clinched the
match her last home match
at Stanford over Solo Zinko
6-3,6-1 to send the Cardinal to
the Round of 16.
"It's been so much fun
playing with [Gibbs] this whole
season," Ahn said of her dou
bles teammate. "I think we feel
comfortable with each other
and have fun, which is when
we're playing our best tennis.
We're trying to work on stay
ing aggressive both at the
baseline and at the net, and I
think we're headed in the right
direction."
Gibbs and Ahn will be one
of several on the Stanford
squad to get a chance at re
demption this Friday against
USC (23-2, 9-0 Pac-12). The
Trojans crashed the Cardinal
earlier this season 6-1 in Los
Angeles. Ahn and Gibbs them
selves fell 8-1 to the No. 2-
ranked doubles team of Kait
lyn Christian and Sabrina San
tamaria.

"Our biggest challenge is
the mental part, dealing with
our history," Ahn said. "But I
think we've been waiting for
our revenge as soon as we lost
to them."
USC is currently on a 15-
mateh win streak and is one of
two teams, along with top
seeded Florida, to have as few
as two losses. Both of the TFo
jans' losses came against top
eight opponents.
The Women of Troy are al
so looking for redemption in
this year's tournament after
losing a close battle to UCLA
4-3 in last year's semifinals.
The Stanford women leave
for Urbana, 111., on Tuesday.
Receiving a day of rest on
Sunday, the team has time for
just one day of practice before
flying east.
"The weather is going to
be different, and there's a
time change, so we're hoping
to be all geared in by the time
Friday rolls around," Ahn
said. "I think at this point, it's
about trying to make every
player feel good about her
game and getting ours minds
right more than anything."
The Cardinal and the Tro
jans meet this Friday at 10
a.m. at the Khan Outdoor

Tennis Complex on the cam
pus of University of Illinois.
The winner will take on the
winner of No. 4 Georgia and
No. 13 Clemson Sunday at
10 a.m. for a berth in the
semifinals.
