### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team
breezed through the first two rounds of
the NCAA Tournament this weekend,
sweeping Miami (OH) (13-13,7-1 MAC) in
the first round and registering another
shutout the following day against No. 22
Rice (21-5,2-1 Conference USA). The No.
12 Cardinal (184, 8-2 PAC-12) will get a
chance at revenge this Friday against Pac
-12 champion No. 5 Southern California in
the Round of 16.

Stanford made quick work of the Red-
Hawks in the first round. The duo of sen
ior Stacey Tan and sophomore Ellen Tsay
blew past Nimisha Mohan and Alix Thur
man 8-0 on Court No. 2 in doubles. Junior
co-captains Nicole Gibbs and Kristie Ahn
then captured an 8-2 victory over Chris
tine Guerrazzi and Ana Rajkovic on Court
No. 1 to secure the doubles point.
Entering singles play with momen

turn, the women delivered three crashing
defeats to clinch the match 4-0. Tan fin
ished first with a dominant 6-0, 6-1 win
over Guerrazzi. Gibbs' 6-1, 6-0 victory
over Mohan came next before Tsay
clinched the match 6-0,6-1 over Rajkovic.
"I think the quote 'to fear no one, but
respect everyone' couldn't have been
more relevant this weekend," Ahn said.
"Just because Miami (OH) is a small name
in tennis doesn't mean they can't have a
big impact."
The Cardinal didn't even have a full
day's rest before its second-round match
against Rice on Saturday. Rice, who bare
ly slid past Pepperdine 4-3 the day before,
fell quickly to the Cardinal.
Tan and Tsay cashed in another shut
out over Katie Gater and Liat Zimmer
mann on Court No. 2 to kick off the match.
Once again, the eighth-ranked nationally
pairing of Gibbs and Ahn prevailed as
well, capturing an 8-4 victory over Natalie
Beazant and Dominique Harmath to
clinch the doubles point.
In singles, it was the three co-captains
who put up quick victories. Gibbs defeated
Beazant 6-2,6-2 while Ahn beat Harmath
