# OPINIONS
## An Attempt at Reflection 
### Alex Bayer 
When I think of fall, it seems
incredibly long ago. I had
different roommates, dif
ferent classes. I was a little wider in
the hips, a little more twinkly in the
eyes. After a summer away, I was
re-energized and full of big plans.
Forget sophomore slump; this was
going to be my time to shine.
Columbae! Friends! Maybe even a
relationship? The night before
school, I lay awake in my bed too
excited to fall asleep; it grew light
outside, and the dump trucks came,
and still I was smiling.
In retrospect, the best moments
happened when I was expecting
nothing. In the spaces in between
the big plans. Isn't that always how
it works? Coachella wasn't the
highlight moment of my year; find
ing an old Columbae alum sprawled
on our floor, entranced by the star
projector and that eventually lead
ing to a chanting circle with a bunch
of strangers was the highlight of
my year.
Alas, life and Stanford are often
at odds. My friend and I were hav
ing a conversation about this. When
I say life, I mean people, conversa
tions, play, leisure ... the things that
make you happy. In my experience,
life exists in pockets at Stanford,
penciled in with everything else.
I must confess, I have, of late,
been prioritizing the latter more
than I should. On weekends where
I should have been doing my work
like a responsible student, I went to
a Killer's concert in the city, ex
plored the Mission, attended a con
cert at Bing alone. It was magnifi
cent at times: I rediscovered a love
for poetry, for the joy of giving into
the music. I made memories; they
may not be permanent, but they
certainly have a greater shelf life
than working in the cluster on a
Saturday night.
Why the intervention? Why did
I feel the need to pump a little
blood into my spring quarter, when
this year was already supposed to
be the best year ever? Well, it was
n't. At least not in the ways I ex
pected. I expected it to be a never
ending stream of sunshine and
rainbows and Instagrammed pic
ture where my friends and I would
be skateboarding down Mayfield in
rally gear en route to some party.
This is not how years work. This
is not how college works. And cer

tainly is not how Stanford works,
despite my valiant efforts. Life
does not move in a steady stream
but like a wave, undulating. I have
experienced some high highs, but I
also have experienced moments of
darkness and these weigh upon my
recollection of the year and cloud
its better attributes. In truth, these
will in time reveal themselves to be
its gems. I will look back on
lovesick or lonely nights and see
that I did most of my growing dur
ing them.
That is one thing I know I do not
possess as long as I'm here: per
spective. I have a vague idea that I
have grown as a human being, but I
don't have the time nor distance to
see how. The emails are always
pressing; the paper is always
knocking on my door. When I allow
myself to think, I think of what I
have to do. And when I shut that
impulse off, I think of home; I
dream of how the light falls on the
cornfields at 6 p.m. and how the
soft-shell crab at my favorite Thai
restaurant smells.
None of this is productive
thought. It is just the wishful think
ing of a soldier who allows himself
to remember what ice cream tastes
like and then dutifully sticks his eye
back into the periscope; but the
scent of ice cream, once triggered,
does not leave and keeps pawing at
his thoughts like a fruit fly, and
soon the soldier regrets pausing to
think about it in the first place, so
much trouble has it caused. So
maybe in time this will be the
"best" year ever, but for now all I
can think about is the route I have
taken from Columbae to class for
the past eight months, so fried is
this brain of mine. "How has this
quarter been?" I can't even answer
that question. My mind dulls and
goes fuzzy and provides me with a
useless grab bag of recollections:
Killers concert... Coachella... Spe
cial D... if I manage to blurt out
any of these, I sound like an idiot.
So usually I am upfront about my
myopia, which proves very unhelp
ful to any conversation so that I
would not be surprised if I am on a
blacklist for small talk partners.
Where to return to? Stanford,
life, perspective (or rather lack of
it), living without expectations... all
of them are intertwined, and given
my conundrum, I cannot only begin

to piece out the hairs. I have
learned a lot. And I have grown a
lot. I keep expecting sophomore
year to turn into the all-out party I
somehow thought it would be, but
maybe that's not what I need right
now. I can save that for next year,
when I'm drinking in life abroad.
Maybe what I needed this year was
growth, pure and unadulterated
growth and maybe it's not pretty,
but maybe it will look beautiful in

retrospect.
I have just about one month left
until departing into the great
study-abroad-gap-year-unknown. I
am scared by the uncertain look of
my future, and so the fact that
come June I can depend on ResEd
to kick me out of Palo Alto is oddly
comforting. I'll fly home, collapse
into my bed, remember the smell of
my covers. At some point, I'll
emerge from my hibernation and

start piecing together what this
year meant to me.
Two months of this and I will
grow bored, and then restless. So I
will fly to a far-away place, reinvent
myself through the gazes of
strangers and thus the cycle will re
peat. Rising and falling, rising and
falling. Like a wave.

Alex would love to hear from you at
