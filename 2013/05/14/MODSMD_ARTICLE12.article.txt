# Housing Next Year? Go Off Campus
## 
### Taylor Brady 
Last week I spoke about seek
ing out places on and around
campus that provide the tran
quility you might be seeking. This
week, I'd like to focus on your living
community. I am going beyond the
extent of the draw guide published
by The Daily earlier this month in
order to give you a picture of how
housing has been evolving on cam
pus and why you might consider go
ing off. I owe a debt of gratitude to
my friend, Dan Kozlowski 'l4, for the
research that he did that contributed
to this article.
Of structures on campus current
ly used to house undergraduates, the
oldest are Mars, Phi Sig, Muwekmah,
Hammarskjold and Theta Chi, con
structed in 1896. The University also
used the Encina Commons for hous
ing in the early days but began ex
panding to Toyon (1923), Lagunita
(19305), and Stern and Wilbur (1948),
among others. There was a huge
building boom in the 19605, when
Stanford added the lake houses
(1963-65), fraternities such as KA and
SAE (1965), and all of the Cowell
Cluster houses (1967). All of the Gov
ernor's Corner houses were added in
1982, and Manzanita/Kimball in
1991. After that, though, no new un
dergraduate housing has been con
structed. For 22 years.
Crothers was converted to under
graduate housing within the past
decade (I was unable, yet, to find out
exactly when), but the next longest
drought of undergraduate housing
construction was 13 years long, be
tween the construction of Lagunita in
the 30s and Crothers in the 40s.
On the other hand, the University
has added quite a bit of housing for
graduate students since the early
90s. Lyman went up in 1997, with ca
pacity for 224 students, EV Studios
opened in 2000 and 2003 with capaci
ty for 834 students, and the infamous
ly nice Munger, named for its bene
factor Chuck "Heavy T" Munger, was
still being constructed when I was a

freshman. Its official capacity is not
provided by Stanford Housing on
their website, but I speculate that it is
well over one thousand, given the
number of floors and the floor plans.
Before I reflect on what this
means for housing on campus, allow
me to construct a little soapbox of
ethos on which to stand. I have
worked with Land Buildings and Re
al Estate (LBRE), project managers
like Laura Goldstein and campus ar
chitect Dave Lennox on a couple of
projects and have found them to be
fantastic people; Goldstein was al
ways particularly helpful. They art
fully handle complex demands from
the Board of Trustees and onerous
restrictions from Santa Clara County
when building new projects. The lat
est General Use Permit (GUP) ap
proval process was a long, hard fight,
and restrictions on what the Univer
sity can build are heavy and very ex
pensive to change.
Beyond the fact that the Universi
ty avoided complying with require
ments under the GUP (where are the
two nature trails that actually serve
the community?), though, the plan it
self was negligent with regards to un
dergraduate housing. In a letter
from October 25, 2000 to alumni and
friends, President Hennessy touted
the fact that "Over half of all the con
struction in Stanford's proposal will
be much-needed housing." Looking
deeper, though, the final agreement
calls for "2000 net new student hous
ing units," and in the document itself,
there is a table breaking down the
proposed distribution of residential
development. What does it say about
undergraduate housing? The plan
only called for the university to add
125 new units on Mayfield
Avenue/The Row, mostly achieved
through renovations, and 100 new
units in Manzanita.
At the same time, the full-time un
dergraduate population (those guar
anteed on-campus housing) has
jumped from 6342 in 2000-01 to 7003

in 2012-13. The yield rate has indeed
spiked in the last few years, with the
2009-10 to 2010-11 transition reflect
ing that trend most accurately. Yet
the primary coping mechanisms of
the University have been to increase
the number of undergraduate stu
dents placed in each room, to the
point where not eveiy staff member
in Durand gets a single or to ship stu
dents out to Oak Creek, where over
200 undergraduates lived this fall.
Part of this plays into the issue of
affordable housing (for people who
are not students, post-doctoral fel
lows or medical residents), which I
do not have space to cover here, but
one thing is clear: the University is
not committed to providing strong
living communities, by my standard,
for much of its undergraduate popu
lation.
Yet here is where I differ from
most of the people covering this issue
this year. The cold truth is, the Uni
versity has every legal right and
every financial imperative, no matter
how perverse, to streamline and
stack its undergraduate housing
units like monastery cells. Stanford
mostly constructs buildings that

house lucrative research facilities.
Case in point: engineering quad.
Your contribution to the Universi
ty's coffers, even as a fantastically af
fluent alum (or one who drops out of
Stanford's precious housing early to
run a tech startup), is a pittance, per
square foot of occupied space, com
pared to research. That's why Row
houses are increasingly mechanical
and nobody's building better ones
where community actually flourishes.
I see this as an opportunity,
though, for students to make a state
ment. We complain about Housing
infantilizing us, but the dominant nar
rative has been that the University
has an obligation to provide the kind
of living community that we
want. That is the most naive and en
titled view I've ever heard.
Here's the solution: look off cam
pus. There is enormous inertia pre
venting it: most of your friends and
their parties stay on campus all four
years, housing in Palo Alto is expen
sive and the commute is hard when
you're tired in the morning. But
nothing will change if you just accept
what Stanford hands you. Hit 'em
where it hurts: their wallet.

A basic breakdown of the off-cam
pus alternative: this summer I paid
$lBOO per month (all expenses) for a
fantastic apartment with my own
room and bathroom, a ten-minute car
ride from campus. Room and board
for the 2013-14 year are $13,166,
which, divided over 30 weeks is
$1755. This does not include person
al expenses, which the University es
timates at $2,400 per year (hahaha,
I'm dying with laughter).
Community is not handed to
you. You must build it. Friends on
staff, even in desirable Row houses
where the staff go out of their way to
organize great events, have lamented
to that how their residents don't par
ticipate enough in making their house
a home. Here's my challenge for the
week: retract your housing applica
tion, absorb the withdrawal fee and
create your own community off cam
pus next year.

doubles by house can be found on

(19305), and Stern and Wilbur (1948),
among others. There was a huge
building boom in the 19605, when
Stanford added the lake houses
(1963-65), fraternities such as KA and
SAE (1965), and all of the Cowell
Cluster houses (1967). All of the Gov
ernor's Corner houses were added in
1982, and Manzanita/Kimball in
1991. After that, though, no new un
dergraduate housing has been con
structed. For 22 years.
Crothers was converted to under
graduate housing within the past
decade (I was unable, yet, to find out
exactly when), but the next longest
drought of undergraduate housing
construction was 13 years long, be
tween the construction of Lagunita in
the 30s and Crothers in the 40s.
On the other hand, the University
has added quite a bit of housing for
graduate students since the early
90s. Lyman went up in 1997, with ca
pacity for 224 students, EV Studios
opened in 2000 and 2003 with capaci
ty for 834 students, and the infamous
ly nice Munger, named for its bene
factor Chuck "Heavy T" Munger, was
still being constructed when I was a

freshman. Its official capacity is not
provided by Stanford Housing on
their website, but I speculate that it is
well over one thousand, given the
number of floors and the floor plans.
Before I reflect on what this
means for housing on campus, allow
me to construct a little soapbox of
ethos on which to stand. I have
worked with Land Buildings and Re
al Estate (LBRE), project managers
like Laura Goldstein and campus ar
chitect Dave Lennox on a couple of
projects and have found them to be
fantastic people; Goldstein was al
ways particularly helpful. They art
fully handle complex demands from
the Board of Trustees and onerous
restrictions from Santa Clara County
when building new projects. The lat
est General Use Permit (GUP) ap
proval process was a long, hard fight,
and restrictions on what the Univer
sity can build are heavy and very ex
pensive to change.
Beyond the fact that the Universi
ty avoided complying with require
ments under the GUP (where are the
two nature trails that actually serve
the community?), though, the plan it
self was negligent with regards to un
dergraduate housing. In a letter
from October 25, 2000 to alumni and
friends, President Hennessy touted
the fact that "Over half of all the con
struction in Stanford's proposal will
be much-needed housing." Looking
deeper, though, the final agreement
calls for "2000 net new student hous
ing units," and in the document itself,
there is a table breaking down the
proposed distribution of residential
development. What does it say about
undergraduate housing? The plan
only called for the university to add
125 new units on Mayfield
Avenue/The Row, mostly achieved
through renovations, and 100 new
units in Manzanita.
At the same time, the full-time un
dergraduate population (those guar
anteed on-campus housing) has
jumped from 6342 in 2000-01 to 7003

in 2012-13. The yield rate has indeed
spiked in the last few years, with the
2009-10 to 2010-11 transition reflect
ing that trend most accurately. Yet
the primary coping mechanisms of
the University have been to increase
the number of undergraduate stu
dents placed in each room, to the
point where not eveiy staff member
in Durand gets a single or to ship stu
dents out to Oak Creek, where over
200 undergraduates lived this fall.
Part of this plays into the issue of
affordable housing (for people who
are not students, post-doctoral fel
lows or medical residents), which I
do not have space to cover here, but
one thing is clear: the University is
not committed to providing strong
living communities, by my standard,
for much of its undergraduate popu
lation.
Yet here is where I differ from
most of the people covering this issue
this year. The cold truth is, the Uni
versity has every legal right and
every financial imperative, no matter
how perverse, to streamline and
stack its undergraduate housing
units like monastery cells. Stanford
mostly constructs buildings that

house lucrative research facilities.
Case in point: engineering quad.
Your contribution to the Universi
ty's coffers, even as a fantastically af
fluent alum (or one who drops out of
Stanford's precious housing early to
run a tech startup), is a pittance, per
square foot of occupied space, com
pared to research. That's why Row
houses are increasingly mechanical
and nobody's building better ones
where community actually flourishes.
I see this as an opportunity,
though, for students to make a state
ment. We complain about Housing
infantilizing us, but the dominant nar
rative has been that the University
has an obligation to provide the kind
of living community that we
want. That is the most naive and en
titled view I've ever heard.
Here's the solution: look off cam
pus. There is enormous inertia pre
venting it: most of your friends and
their parties stay on campus all four
years, housing in Palo Alto is expen
sive and the commute is hard when
you're tired in the morning. But
nothing will change if you just accept
what Stanford hands you. Hit 'em
where it hurts: their wallet.

A basic breakdown of the off-cam
pus alternative: this summer I paid
$lBOO per month (all expenses) for a
fantastic apartment with my own
room and bathroom, a ten-minute car
ride from campus. Room and board
for the 2013-14 year are $13,166,
which, divided over 30 weeks is
$1755. This does not include person
al expenses, which the University es
timates at $2,400 per year (hahaha,
I'm dying with laughter).
Community is not handed to
you. You must build it. Friends on
staff, even in desirable Row houses
where the staff go out of their way to
organize great events, have lamented
to that how their residents don't par
ticipate enough in making their house
a home. Here's my challenge for the
week: retract your housing applica
tion, absorb the withdrawal fee and
create your own community off cam
pus next year.

Last week I spoke about seek
ing out places on and around
campus that provide the tran
quility you might be seeking. This
week, I'd like to focus on your living
community. I am going beyond the
extent of the draw guide published
by The Daily earlier this month in
order to give you a picture of how
housing has been evolving on cam
pus and why you might consider go
ing off. I owe a debt of gratitude to
my friend, Dan Kozlowski 'l4, for the
research that he did that contributed
to this article.
Of structures on campus current
ly used to house undergraduates, the
oldest are Mars, Phi Sig, Muwekmah,
Hammarskjold and Theta Chi, con
structed in 1896. The University also
