# Case study finds flawed, slanted judicial process
## 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
Students subject to the Universi
ty's judicial process may be exposed
to a system implicitly slanted to
wards finding respondents guilty
and willfully indifferent to rights en
shrined in the Student Judicial
Charter of 1997, according to a case
study of a 2011 judicial proceeding.
The study was undertaken by the
three students acquitted of plagia
rism charges in the 2011 case and
their alumni representatives.
"Unless it's entirely clear that
you're innocent, you're pretty much
[presumed] guilty," reflected one of
the acquitted students, a current
senior. "They'll go after you to get a
conviction."
University administrators, mean

while, acknowledged flaws within
the process but emphasized efforts
to correct those shortcomings while
depicting the case in question as an
outlier.

Extensive judicial abuses
The case study references the
experiences of three students
charged with plagiarism in a June
2011 human biology final. All three
students were eventually acquitted
though two of the three were on
ly one vote removed from a guilty
finding in November 2011, but
only after undergoing a process
that, according to Bob Ottilie '77,
who represented one of the stu
dents, showed extensive misconduct
by the University.
"We have absolute proof that
there were gross, continuous [and]

serial violations of the [Judicial]
Charter," Ottilie emphasized. 'At a
minimum, you have to stop this
process until you can assure [partic
ipants] that you've stopped the vio
lations."
Such violations of the Judicial
Charter, as alleged by the study, in
clude efforts to discourage students
from calling witnesses on their be
half or from cross-examining in
criminatory witnesses; the selection
of an untrained and biased set of
panelists; the presentation of inad
missible evidence; efforts by a nom
inally impartial Judicial Officer to
pursue a guilty finding by the selec
tive admission and exclusion of evi
dence and witnesses; and the bring
ing of charges without the participa
tion of the original student com
plainant and without for one stu

dent any evidence at all.
"The presumption of guilt per
meated this entire process," Ottilie
said. "Everything that was done
could only have been done with a
presumption of guilt... The Charter
was being violated at every step of
the process."
Both Rick Yuen and Morris
Graves, the case's Judicial Officer
and Judicial Advisor respectively,
declined to comment for this article.
Ottilie expressed concern that
similar misconduct had taken place
in other cases brought by the Office
of Judicial Affairs, which has since
been renamed the Office of Commu
nity Standards.
"This isn't one or two people," he
asserted. "This was an office that
was out of control at the time."
Describing the Office of Commu

nity Standard's conviction rate as
artificially high, Ottilie suggested
that past cases in which anonymity
had been granted to the complaining
party denying the respondent
the opportunity to cross-examine
the complainant should be re
viewed and, if appropriate, their
verdicts set aside.
"John [Martin 'BO, a lawyer who
represented another student in the
case] and I agree that there've been
scores —or even more —of stu
dents who have been convicted in
hearing processes in which their
fundamental rights were violated,"
Ottilie said.
During the 2010-11 academic
year, the Office of Community Stan
dards obtained guilty findings in 87
