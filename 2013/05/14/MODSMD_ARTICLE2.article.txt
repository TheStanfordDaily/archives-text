# Case study finds flawed, slanted judicial process
## 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
Students subject to the Universi
ty's judicial process may be exposed
to a system implicitly slanted to
wards finding respondents guilty
and willfully indifferent to rights en
shrined in the Student Judicial
Charter of 1997, according to a case
study of a 2011 judicial proceeding.
The study was undertaken by the
three students acquitted of plagia
rism charges in the 2011 case and
their alumni representatives.
"Unless it's entirely clear that
you're innocent, you're pretty much
[presumed] guilty," reflected one of
the acquitted students, a current
senior. "They'll go after you to get a
conviction."
University administrators, mean

while, acknowledged flaws within
the process but emphasized efforts
to correct those shortcomings while
depicting the case in question as an
outlier.

Extensive judicial abuses
The case study references the
experiences of three students
charged with plagiarism in a June
2011 human biology final. All three
students were eventually acquitted
though two of the three were on
ly one vote removed from a guilty
finding in November 2011, but
only after undergoing a process
that, according to Bob Ottilie '77,
who represented one of the stu
dents, showed extensive misconduct
by the University.
"We have absolute proof that
there were gross, continuous [and]

serial violations of the [Judicial]
Charter," Ottilie emphasized. 'At a
minimum, you have to stop this
process until you can assure [partic
ipants] that you've stopped the vio
lations."
Such violations of the Judicial
Charter, as alleged by the study, in
clude efforts to discourage students
from calling witnesses on their be
half or from cross-examining in
criminatory witnesses; the selection
of an untrained and biased set of
panelists; the presentation of inad
missible evidence; efforts by a nom
inally impartial Judicial Officer to
pursue a guilty finding by the selec
tive admission and exclusion of evi
dence and witnesses; and the bring
ing of charges without the participa
tion of the original student com
plainant and without for one stu

dent any evidence at all.
"The presumption of guilt per
meated this entire process," Ottilie
said. "Everything that was done
could only have been done with a
presumption of guilt... The Charter
was being violated at every step of
the process."
Both Rick Yuen and Morris
Graves, the case's Judicial Officer
and Judicial Advisor respectively,
declined to comment for this article.
Ottilie expressed concern that
similar misconduct had taken place
in other cases brought by the Office
of Judicial Affairs, which has since
been renamed the Office of Commu
nity Standards.
"This isn't one or two people," he
asserted. "This was an office that
was out of control at the time."
Describing the Office of Commu

nity Standard's conviction rate as
artificially high, Ottilie suggested
that past cases in which anonymity
had been granted to the complaining
party denying the respondent
the opportunity to cross-examine
the complainant should be re
viewed and, if appropriate, their
verdicts set aside.
"John [Martin 'BO, a lawyer who
represented another student in the
case] and I agree that there've been
scores —or even more —of stu
dents who have been convicted in
hearing processes in which their
fundamental rights were violated,"
Ottilie said.
During the 2010-11 academic
year, the Office of Community Stan
dards obtained guilty findings in 87
percent of Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code
cases that went to a hearing
for determination of guilt.
The student against
whom there had been no ini
tial complaint and who
still received three votes, or
two fewer than necessary, in
favor of a guilty finding from
the six-member panel ex
pressed certainty that he
would have been found
guilty in the absence of legal
representation.
"There's no doubt we
would have lost [without
counsel]," he said. "[The ju
dicial officers] were aggres
sive, they intimidated wit
nesses, they didn't allow fair
process... It was in all sens
es a shitshow."
The student singled out
Morris Graves as particular
ly negligent in upholding
student rights.
"It's his duty to protect
student rights," the student
complained. "He was ab
solutely spineless there."
"People in the Office of
Judicial Affairs jumped with
both feet on the scales of jus
tice," Ottilie added. "Had
those three not been repre
sented, they would have
been convicted."
ASSU Executive Billy
Gallagher 'l4 expressed con
cern about the case study's
findings and noted that he
had personally encountered
students with other negative
accounts of the University's
judicial process.
"It's disturbing... It just
doesn't seem like the Stan
ford we all know and love,"
Gallagher said. "It's just
scary to see the system work
that badly."
Changes undertaken
Dean of Student Life
Chris Griffith framed the
case cited in the study as an
outlier, citing the generally
positive nature of feedback
solicited from students who
have gone through the judi
cial process.
"We've gotten really
good feedback from the stu
dents who've come through
our process," Griffith af
firmed, describing criticisms

of administrators' impartial
ity as unusual.
"The Office is very con
scious of rules and protec
tions," added Jonathan York
'l3, student co-chair of the
Board on Judicial Affairs.
"I've heard more students
be grateful and express ap
preciation for what they do
than criticism."
York and Griffith noted
that several of the sugges
tions raised by the case
study such as creating
specific training for student
panel chairs and devising a
formal procedure for deter
mining evidentiary stan
dards and admissibility
had been identified in both
an internal review process
undertaken by the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs
the Charter's first since
1997 and in a report by an
external consultant.
"A lot of the things in the
case study we're currently
reviewing in subcommit
tees," York noted. "We've
addressed so many of those
things ... the Internal Re
view Panel was really, really
comprehensive ... [Ottilie]
gave us a little bit of a dif
ferent perspective, but he
didn't teach us anything
new."
Griffith noted, however,
that revising certain as
pects of the process might
produce inadvertent side ef
fects. For example, she said
that by omitting the previ
ously supplied warning to
student respondents to not
contact witnesses, student
respondents might be more
likely to do so. Griffith
added that this could put
student respondents at a
greater risk of being per
ceived as intimidating wit
nesses itself a violation
of the Fundamental Stan
dard. The revised notifica
tion currently contains a
disclaimer to that effect.
York disputed the need
for any delay in hearing cas
es while improvements were
implemented.
"A lot of the things in [the
case study] are concerning,"
he acknowledged. "I don't
think this is a systemwide
problem ... but there is room
for systemwide improve
ment. We've taken steps in
the right direction."

"We don't see these as rad
ical changes to the process,

because the [lnternal Re
view Panel] said this process
isn't broken," added Koren
Bakkegard, director of the
Office of Community Stan
dards. "We're always look
ing for opportunities to im
prove and refine... I don't
see it as something that
would change outcomes but
[rather as] something that
would improve the process
for the future."
David Hsu, a graduate
student who previously
served on judicial panels,
noted that, in his experience,
the training offered to pan
elists was sufficiently com
prehensive given the ab
sence of exposure to a real
hearing. Hsu also defended
the high percentage of guilty
findings in cases brought by
the Office of Community
Standards.
"I've never been in a case
where the outcome was
guilty and 1... felt any dis
comfort," Hsu emphasized.
"They may turn out mostly
guilty ... but it's because the
evidence is very heavily
against the person."
Ottilie alleged, however,
a lack of responsiveness by
University administrators
and argued that more ex
plicit leadership from senior
University leaders in
cluding President John
Hennessy is required to
ensure improvements are
made permanent and that
sufficient oversight is exer
cised.
"The University has to
ultimately make certain that
any fixes are institutional
ized," he said. "There are al
ready rules there. The issue
is making sure that people
are enforcing their rules."
"I cannot allow any client
to have a case heard by ei
ther [Yuen or Graves],
knowing what's in this re
port," Ottilie added. "You
just can't fix that... We have
the best Charter. It's just
not enforced."
Gallagher said that he
and fellow ASSU Executive
Dan Ashton 'l4 plan to at
tend an Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs
staff meeting today to better
understand the issue before
working with administrators
on solutions.
"This is what Dan and I
meant [during the election]
when we said that things will

come up that we haven't
planned for," Gallagher not
ed. "We have to see how
things unfold."
Discipline and education
According to Ottilie, con
versations with University
administrators regarding
the case repeatedly refer
enced a "discipline system,"
a characterization that Grif
fith and Bakkegard contest
ed in favor of defining the
process as educational.
"It really is a conversa
tion," Bakkegard said. "I'm
sure [that] for the respond
ing student... it's a difficult
one to have. But the idea is
not to prosecute the student,
but to have a conversation
about what occurred."
"One of the most power
ful statements made [in the
internal review]... was to
say we need to remain an ed
ucational process and resist
the temptation to become le
galistic," Griffith added. "I
believe that."
York echoed the inclina
tion to distance the process
from "legalistic" practices,
describing the student-run
process as conveying both
responsibilities and privi
leges.
"You appear before your
peers [and] you have the op
portunity to present your
case," he emphasized. "If
you're found responsible,
you do face the conse
quences, but the punish
ments aren't meant to be de
bilitating ... This is [primari
ly] a learning process."
Ottilie insisted, however,

on the value of both educat
ing students so that they
might make full use of that
opportunity and ap
proaching the judicial
process in a more structured
and legally-inclined manner.
"All these procedural
protections... are designed
to enhance the quality of ev
idence that comes in," he
said. "You [then] have the
highest possible chance of
getting the right result."
As an example, Ottilie
cited another case in which a
student was evicted from
Row housing as a result of
an altercation, after a
process in which the Resi
dence Dean handling the
case precluded the student
from speaking to exculpato
ry witnesses and declined to
interview those witnesses
herself. Once counseled to
the contrary by a private at
torney, the student over
turned the decision with
declarations from over 60
witnesses.
Bakkegard estimated
that only a minority of stu
dents charged through the
judicial process actually con
test the allegations, instead
choosing to take advantage
of an "early resolution op
tion" program that involves
just a sentencing hearing af
ter the admission of culpa
bility.
While Ottilie noted that
such a program might im
plicitly suggest more lenient
punishments and thus en
courage false admissions of
guilt, Bakkegard and As
sistant Dean of the Office

of Community Standards
Jamie Pontius-Hogan noted
that penalties largely con
formed to standard sanc
tions that would otherwise
be levied.
Turning to the broader
picture, Ottilie framed effec
tively strengthening the ju
dicial process as potentially
allowing the University to
set a precedent on an issue
student rights in judicial
processes, from plagiarism
to sexual assault that has
increasingly become a na
tional one.
"This is going on else
where," he noted. "This is a
crisis for Stanford are we
going to be judged by the
crisis or by our response to
it?"
Griffith acknowledged
the value of greater student
participation in creating and
sustaining an optimal judi
cial process.
"This is a process that
demands consistent input
and feedback from students,"
she emphasized. "It's a stu
dent-centered process."
"There can be kinks
when you have a student
run process," York acknowl
edged. "In the long run, the
benefits of having a student
run process are immense. If
that means we have to keep
working at it, so be it."
