# Q&A
## JAMIE MELTZER DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR 
### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Assistant Professor of Art and
Art History Jamie Meltzer has di
rected four documentary films to
date and recently raised $31,520
through Kickstarter for a fifth, enti
tled "Freedom Fighters." The film,
which has an undetermined release
date, follows the story of a group of
Texans who were arrested and later
acquitted for crimes they did not
commit. After being released from
jail, they decided to launch a detec
tive agency to help others who had
been wrongfully accused. Meltzer
sat down with The Daily to discuss
his hopes for the film and how he
became involved with the Freedom
Fighters.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
did you hear about the Freedom
Fighters detective agency, and
why were you interested in mak

ing a film about it?
Jamie Meltzer (JM): I have a
friend who I've worked with before
who is a reporter in Texas â€”he
writes for The Texas Observer
and he told me about this group of
exonerated men... That sounded in
teresting, but there have been a lot
of documentaries about that sub
ject. But he then told me that these
guys had gotten together and were
forming a detective agency, and
that really kind of caught my inter
est because wow, I mean, these
guys have been through really in
tense injustices on their own. That's
part of then* own personal story,
and now they're turning that into
trying to help other people that
were in their position, people that
were wrongfully convicted or possi
bly wrongfully convicted and are
still in prison, and they want to see
if they can free those guys... That
just seemed like a fascinating
process to see unfold.

TSD: How did you raise money to
make the film, and why did you
decide to use Kickstarter?
JM: A budget for a film is usual
ly several hundred thousand dol
lars, and Kickstarter is going to be
a small part of that. But it's an im
portant part because the name
kick-starts your project and gets
you going at a phase where it might
be difficult to raise money. But the
main reason I wanted to use Kick
starter ... is not so much as a
fundraising tool but as an aware
ness raising tool, to get people
aware of the project and the issues
... and when the film does come out,
I now have this group of people who
are passionate about it and who are
going to help promote it [and] help
get it out there. The amazing thing
about Kickstarter is that you can
staid getting these emails and in
quiries from people all over the
country who are very excited about

what you're doing and all kinds of
other support.
TSD: What have been the most
challenging and rewarding parts
of creating the documentary?
JM: We're about a year into it,
and it's been a great project so far.
The group of exonerees is an inter
esting community to have access to.
It's a privilege of being a documen
tary filmmaker that you get to go
into these different worlds that you
would never encounter otherwise ...
The challenge is really only in put
ting the project together and trying
to sell the documentary before it's
made. I now have to go out there
and allow the time I'm spending as
a filmmaker to be not making the
film but [also] fundraising and pro
ducing, and I find that to be a chal
lenge. You're trying to do a lot of dif
ferent things [and] fund it from a lot
