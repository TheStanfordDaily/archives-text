# Q&A
## JAMIE MELTZER DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR 
### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Assistant Professor of Art and
Art History Jamie Meltzer has di
rected four documentary films to
date and recently raised $31,520
through Kickstarter for a fifth, enti
tled "Freedom Fighters." The film,
which has an undetermined release
date, follows the story of a group of
Texans who were arrested and later
acquitted for crimes they did not
commit. After being released from
jail, they decided to launch a detec
tive agency to help others who had
been wrongfully accused. Meltzer
sat down with The Daily to discuss
his hopes for the film and how he
became involved with the Freedom
Fighters.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
did you hear about the Freedom
Fighters detective agency, and
why were you interested in mak

ing a film about it?
Jamie Meltzer (JM): I have a
friend who I've worked with before
who is a reporter in Texas —he
writes for The Texas Observer
and he told me about this group of
exonerated men... That sounded in
teresting, but there have been a lot
of documentaries about that sub
ject. But he then told me that these
guys had gotten together and were
forming a detective agency, and
that really kind of caught my inter
est because wow, I mean, these
guys have been through really in
tense injustices on their own. That's
part of then* own personal story,
and now they're turning that into
trying to help other people that
were in their position, people that
were wrongfully convicted or possi
bly wrongfully convicted and are
still in prison, and they want to see
if they can free those guys... That
just seemed like a fascinating
process to see unfold.

TSD: How did you raise money to
make the film, and why did you
decide to use Kickstarter?
JM: A budget for a film is usual
ly several hundred thousand dol
lars, and Kickstarter is going to be
a small part of that. But it's an im
portant part because the name
kick-starts your project and gets
you going at a phase where it might
be difficult to raise money. But the
main reason I wanted to use Kick
starter ... is not so much as a
fundraising tool but as an aware
ness raising tool, to get people
aware of the project and the issues
... and when the film does come out,
I now have this group of people who
are passionate about it and who are
going to help promote it [and] help
get it out there. The amazing thing
about Kickstarter is that you can
staid getting these emails and in
quiries from people all over the
country who are very excited about

what you're doing and all kinds of
other support.
TSD: What have been the most
challenging and rewarding parts
of creating the documentary?
JM: We're about a year into it,
and it's been a great project so far.
The group of exonerees is an inter
esting community to have access to.
It's a privilege of being a documen
tary filmmaker that you get to go
into these different worlds that you
would never encounter otherwise ...
The challenge is really only in put
ting the project together and trying
to sell the documentary before it's
made. I now have to go out there
and allow the time I'm spending as
a filmmaker to be not making the
film but [also] fundraising and pro
ducing, and I find that to be a chal
lenge. You're trying to do a lot of dif
ferent things [and] fund it from a lot

of different angles. You have
some success, but it's a lot of
searching for allies, money
and grants.
TSD: What is it like speak
ing with people who spent
more than two decades in
prison for crimes they did
n't commit?
JM: One of the most unbe
lievable things about it is if I
was in prison for something I
didn't do for one day or one
year, or five years, I almost
can't imagine the experience
and I'm positive that I would
be broken by that experience
... but these guys aren't bit
ter really at all. And the
whole point of the detective
agency is to use that experi
ence that they have, the injus
tices and the tragedy that
they went through, to use it
for good and to make real
change.
To me that's just a totally
inspiring notion, and the way
that they view the world is to
tally fresh, in a totally differ
ent way because they've been
locked up for 10 to 20 years,
so they appreciate things dif
ferently than I do. I take

things for granted. They
don't. They can sit outside
and listen to the birds chirp in
the morning and that can be
for them this whole experi
ence ... it's been a real lesson
in appreciating the smaller
things in life.
TSD: What do you hope
viewers learn from the film?
JM: First of all, I'm al
ways trying to tell an incredi
ble story...And one thing
that excited me about this is
the detective genre part of
this and mixing that with the
documentary genre. I like the
idea of playing around with
that in film terms. As far as
the lessons I want people to
get from the film, it's in
progress, so it's a little bit
hard to say now. But even at
this point I think the most im
portant thing is for people to
learn how wrongful convic
tions happen... I don't think
people are as aware of that is
sue as they should be.
A lot of it has to do with
the justice system and the
way that it's set up in terms of
defense attorneys for people
who can't afford to get de
fense. They end up making a
lot of compromises. There are
a lot of issues with police mis
conduct and all of this leads to
wrongful convictions. Raising
awareness around all of these

issues is what these guys are
all about and hopefully what
the film will be about.
TSD: You teach in the film
and media studies depart
ment, and also in the master
of fine arts program in docu
mentary film and video. How
will you share the film and
your experience with future
students?
JM: We're constantly
teaching students how to do
documentary storytelling,
and how to tell stories in an
interesting way. We talk
about how to bring out the
matic content [and] social is
sue content. I think by being
a practicing filmmaker, I
bring that experience to the
classroom naturally. I think
it's important to be actively
engaged in the area you are
teaching. So whether it's
taking films to film festivals
and learning about that
world, and the marketplace
out there, or learning about
production, which I'm in now,
or thinking about structure
and editing, those are all
things I try to bring to the
classroom.

TSD: What have been the most
challenging and rewarding parts
of creating the documentary?
JM: We're about a year into it,
and it's been a great project so far.
The group of exonerees is an inter
esting community to have access to.
It's a privilege of being a documen
tary filmmaker that you get to go
into these different worlds that you
would never encounter otherwise ...
The challenge is really only in put
ting the project together and trying
to sell the documentary before it's
made. I now have to go out there
and allow the time I'm spending as
a filmmaker to be not making the
film but [also] fundraising and pro
ducing, and I find that to be a chal
lenge. You're trying to do a lot of dif
ferent things [and] fund it from a lot

of different angles. You have
some success, but it's a lot of
searching for allies, money
and grants.
TSD: What is it like speak
ing with people who spent
more than two decades in
prison for crimes they did
n't commit?
JM: One of the most unbe
lievable things about it is if I
was in prison for something I
didn't do for one day or one
year, or five years, I almost
can't imagine the experience
and I'm positive that I would
be broken by that experience
... but these guys aren't bit
ter really at all. And the
whole point of the detective
agency is to use that experi
ence that they have, the injus
tices and the tragedy that
they went through, to use it
for good and to make real
change.
To me that's just a totally
inspiring notion, and the way
that they view the world is to
tally fresh, in a totally differ
ent way because they've been
locked up for 10 to 20 years,
so they appreciate things dif
ferently than I do. I take

things for granted. They
don't. They can sit outside
and listen to the birds chirp in
the morning and that can be
for them this whole experi
ence ... it's been a real lesson
in appreciating the smaller
things in life.
TSD: What do you hope
viewers learn from the film?
JM: First of all, I'm al
ways trying to tell an incredi
ble story...And one thing
that excited me about this is
the detective genre part of
this and mixing that with the
documentary genre. I like the
idea of playing around with
that in film terms. As far as
the lessons I want people to
get from the film, it's in
progress, so it's a little bit
hard to say now. But even at
this point I think the most im
portant thing is for people to
learn how wrongful convic
tions happen... I don't think
people are as aware of that is
sue as they should be.
A lot of it has to do with
the justice system and the
way that it's set up in terms of
defense attorneys for people
who can't afford to get de
fense. They end up making a
lot of compromises. There are
a lot of issues with police mis
conduct and all of this leads to
wrongful convictions. Raising
awareness around all of these

issues is what these guys are
all about and hopefully what
the film will be about.
TSD: You teach in the film
and media studies depart
ment, and also in the master
of fine arts program in docu
mentary film and video. How
will you share the film and
your experience with future
students?
JM: We're constantly
teaching students how to do
documentary storytelling,
and how to tell stories in an
interesting way. We talk
about how to bring out the
matic content [and] social is
sue content. I think by being
a practicing filmmaker, I
bring that experience to the
classroom naturally. I think
it's important to be actively
engaged in the area you are
teaching. So whether it's
taking films to film festivals
and learning about that
world, and the marketplace
out there, or learning about
production, which I'm in now,
or thinking about structure
and editing, those are all
things I try to bring to the
classroom.

Assistant Professor of Art and
Art History Jamie Meltzer has di
rected four documentary films to
date and recently raised $31,520
through Kickstarter for a fifth, enti
tled "Freedom Fighters." The film,
which has an undetermined release
date, follows the story of a group of
Texans who were arrested and later
acquitted for crimes they did not
commit. After being released from
jail, they decided to launch a detec
tive agency to help others who had
been wrongfully accused. Meltzer
sat down with The Daily to discuss
his hopes for the film and how he
became involved with the Freedom
Fighters.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
did you hear about the Freedom
Fighters detective agency, and
why were you interested in mak

ing a film about it?
Jamie Meltzer (JM): I have a
friend who I've worked with before
who is a reporter in Texas —he
writes for The Texas Observer
and he told me about this group of
exonerated men... That sounded in
teresting, but there have been a lot
of documentaries about that sub
ject. But he then told me that these
guys had gotten together and were
forming a detective agency, and
that really kind of caught my inter
est because wow, I mean, these
guys have been through really in
tense injustices on their own. That's
part of then* own personal story,
and now they're turning that into
trying to help other people that
were in their position, people that
were wrongfully convicted or possi
bly wrongfully convicted and are
still in prison, and they want to see
if they can free those guys... That
just seemed like a fascinating
process to see unfold.

TSD: How did you raise money to
make the film, and why did you
decide to use Kickstarter?
JM: A budget for a film is usual
ly several hundred thousand dol
lars, and Kickstarter is going to be
a small part of that. But it's an im
portant part because the name
kick-starts your project and gets
you going at a phase where it might
be difficult to raise money. But the
main reason I wanted to use Kick
starter ... is not so much as a
fundraising tool but as an aware
ness raising tool, to get people
aware of the project and the issues
... and when the film does come out,
I now have this group of people who
are passionate about it and who are
going to help promote it [and] help
get it out there. The amazing thing
about Kickstarter is that you can
staid getting these emails and in
quiries from people all over the
country who are very excited about

what you're doing and all kinds of
other support.
