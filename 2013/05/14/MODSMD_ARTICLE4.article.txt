## Study furthers muscular dystrophy research 
### SAMANTHA LYNN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers in the School of
Medicine recently published a
study detailing the development of
mouse models that use luciferase,
the gene that makes fireflies glow,
to follow the progression of limb
girdle muscular dystrophy through
noninvasive imaging of the lumi
nescent decaying muscle cells.
The researchers, who worked in
the lab of Professor of Neurology
and Neurological Science Thomas

Rando, began developing the
mouse model in 2008. The study
was co-authored by Rando, clinical
assistant professor Leland Lim, re
search associate Katie Maguire
and Sedona Speedy, an undergrad
uate student at Northwestern Uni
versity.
To create the mouse models,
Rando's lab inserted the luciferase
gene into the genome of the mice at
the embryonic level. When the
mice developed, all of their cells
carried the gene, according to Ran
do, allowing the researchers to "de

cide through another genetic trick
which cell it gets turned on in."
"Our genetic trick is to turn it
on only in the muscle stem cells,"
Rando said. "You could use this
same mouse model and turn on lu
ciferase in another stem cell popu
lation just as easily now that we've
created this."
According to Maguire, the re
searchers injected the mice when
they were two months old with a
substance that turned on the lu
ciferase in their stem cells. After
giving them injections for five

days, the researchers began the
process of conducting monthly im
aging on the mice to monitor dis
ease progression.
"You just inject them with a
substance called luciferand, and
you wait 23 minutes, and then you
put them into the imaging chamber
and then you image them,"
Maguire said. "It really doesn't
take that long to actually do the im
aging."
Maguire and Speedy carried
out parallel histological
analyses of mice in order to
compare the histological
method of monitoring the
disease to the researchers'
new method. The multi-day
histological process in which
tissues are collected, cut and
antibody-stained was previ
ously the primary method of
studying the progression of

muscular dystrophy in mice.
"When you have to actu
ally evaluate the effective
ness of a drug, it requires a
lot of different time points, a
lot of different treatments, so
a lot of different mice,"
Maguire said. "The paper
just shows that instead of do
ing all these histological
analyses, we can just rely on
the noninvasive imaging us
ing the luciferase as our re
porter."
According to Rando, cur
rent treatments for muscular
dystrophy are minimally ef

fective and only work in the
short term. Rando said that
the mouse models will allow
researchers to study treat
ments in living animals over
time.
"This should greatly facil
itate the translation of that
from an idea from a test in
the mouse to getting that to
humans," he said. "What it
means for human therapy is
that we can take many more
ideas through animal testing
at a much higher rate in a
much shorter amount of
time."
Maguire agreed that the
mouse model could eventual
ly contribute to discoveries
that benefit human patients.
"We can't make glowing
humans, but we can test
drugs, and we can test thera
pies," Maguire said. "I also
have other models that I'm
establishing using similar
technology there will be
more glowing mice coming."
According to Rando, the
researchers will continue to
conduct studies of therapeu
tic treatments using the ex
isting mouse models, ex
panding the scope of their re
search to include other types
of muscular dystrophy and
testing out other models.
The lab also plans to dis
tribute the mouse models to
outside researchers studying
muscular dystrophy and oth
er topics such as exercise sci
ence and studies on sarcope
nia, an age-related loss of
muscle mass.
"We can't possibly do all
those studies here, so our
goal really is to share this re
source with the community,"
Rando said.
