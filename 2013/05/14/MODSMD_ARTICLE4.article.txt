## Study furthers muscular dystrophy research 
### SAMANTHA LYNN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers in the School of
Medicine recently published a
study detailing the development of
mouse models that use luciferase,
the gene that makes fireflies glow,
to follow the progression of limb
girdle muscular dystrophy through
noninvasive imaging of the lumi
nescent decaying muscle cells.
The researchers, who worked in
the lab of Professor of Neurology
and Neurological Science Thomas

Rando, began developing the
mouse model in 2008. The study
was co-authored by Rando, clinical
assistant professor Leland Lim, re
search associate Katie Maguire
and Sedona Speedy, an undergrad
uate student at Northwestern Uni
versity.
To create the mouse models,
Rando's lab inserted the luciferase
gene into the genome of the mice at
the embryonic level. When the
mice developed, all of their cells
carried the gene, according to Ran
do, allowing the researchers to "de

cide through another genetic trick
which cell it gets turned on in."
"Our genetic trick is to turn it
on only in the muscle stem cells,"
Rando said. "You could use this
same mouse model and turn on lu
ciferase in another stem cell popu
lation just as easily now that we've
created this."
According to Maguire, the re
searchers injected the mice when
they were two months old with a
substance that turned on the lu
ciferase in their stem cells. After
giving them injections for five

days, the researchers began the
process of conducting monthly im
aging on the mice to monitor dis
ease progression.
"You just inject them with a
substance called luciferand, and
you wait 23 minutes, and then you
put them into the imaging chamber
and then you image them,"
Maguire said. "It really doesn't
take that long to actually do the im
aging."
