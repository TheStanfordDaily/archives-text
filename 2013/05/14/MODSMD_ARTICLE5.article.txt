FLiCKS, a student group that offers
free movies on campus, received
$91,000 including $9,900 for officer
salaries in special fees funding last
month, after the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate had rejected the group's fee
request based in part on those salaries.
FLiCKS officers have, however, de
fended their compensation, arguing
that FLiCKS has always been a busi
ness providing a specific service to stu
dents.
"We budget about $3,000 per quar
ter for officer salaries right now,"
FLiCKS President Rex Kirshner 'l3
said. "We consider all of our six mem
bers officers."
For their fiscal year 2013-14 budget,
FLiCKS had initially requested that the
ASSU approve their fee request of
$91,000 without having to use the spe
cial fees ballot. That request was reject
ed in February.
"We initially thought that we would
just get [our new budget approval] from
the Senate," Kirshner said. "They saw
our budget and didn't like parts of it,
and just rejected it, out of the blue."
"We were not a hundred percent
sure why the budget was rejected," said
Kit Evans 'l3, FLiCKS' director of spe
cial events.
Christos Haveles 'l5, deputy chair of
the Senate's Appropriations Committee
at the time, said that the Senate's rejec
tion of FLiCKS' request was based in
part on the salaries sought.
"We rejected their budget mainly
because of the first line item on their
budget, for officer salary," he said. "It
was going to be split amongst the six
officers in their interview, they ex
plained that this money is for all offi
cers."
In the group's application to the
ASSU, officer salaries were described
as "discretionary pay for FLiCKS offi
cers." Haveles said that FLiCKS'
budget allocates salaries to the Finan
cial Officer and President, but all oth
er members are paid by the hour.
"I know their marketing director
reported the most hours," Haveles
said. "It's all pretty much self-report
ed, and I am not sure exactly how
much it is per hour."
Kirshner noted that the FLiCKS
budget the fourth most expensive
undergraduate-only budget voted on
by students mostly goes towards
the infrastructure necessary to screen
a movie.
"A lot of the budget is for special
events, like special screenings," Evans
added, citing an event during fall quar
ter when FLiCKS showed an advance
screening of the musical comedy
"Pitch Perfect."
However, Haveles said that con
cerns over the budget didn't come
from those expenses.
"Those fixed costs of getting good-
