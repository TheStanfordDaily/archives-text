## Voters split from ASSU on FLiCKS' pay After rejection by Senate, group funds salaries from special fees 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
FLiCKS, a student group that offers
free movies on campus, received
$91,000 including $9,900 for officer
salaries in special fees funding last
month, after the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate had rejected the group's fee
request based in part on those salaries.
FLiCKS officers have, however, de
fended their compensation, arguing
that FLiCKS has always been a busi
ness providing a specific service to stu
dents.
"We budget about $3,000 per quar
ter for officer salaries right now,"
FLiCKS President Rex Kirshner 'l3
said. "We consider all of our six mem
bers officers."
For their fiscal year 2013-14 budget,
FLiCKS had initially requested that the
ASSU approve their fee request of
$91,000 without having to use the spe
cial fees ballot. That request was reject
ed in February.
"We initially thought that we would
just get [our new budget approval] from
the Senate," Kirshner said. "They saw
our budget and didn't like parts of it,
and just rejected it, out of the blue."
"We were not a hundred percent
sure why the budget was rejected," said
Kit Evans 'l3, FLiCKS' director of spe
cial events.
Christos Haveles 'l5, deputy chair of
the Senate's Appropriations Committee
at the time, said that the Senate's rejec
tion of FLiCKS' request was based in
part on the salaries sought.
"We rejected their budget mainly
because of the first line item on their
budget, for officer salary," he said. "It
was going to be split amongst the six
officers in their interview, they ex
plained that this money is for all offi
cers."
In the group's application to the
ASSU, officer salaries were described
as "discretionary pay for FLiCKS offi
cers." Haveles said that FLiCKS'
budget allocates salaries to the Finan
cial Officer and President, but all oth
er members are paid by the hour.
"I know their marketing director
reported the most hours," Haveles
said. "It's all pretty much self-report
ed, and I am not sure exactly how
much it is per hour."
Kirshner noted that the FLiCKS
budget the fourth most expensive
undergraduate-only budget voted on
by students mostly goes towards
the infrastructure necessary to screen
a movie.
"A lot of the budget is for special
events, like special screenings," Evans
added, citing an event during fall quar
ter when FLiCKS showed an advance
screening of the musical comedy
"Pitch Perfect."
However, Haveles said that con
cerns over the budget didn't come
from those expenses.
"Those fixed costs of getting good-
quality movies for showing was an
understandable cost," Haveles said.
"The officer salary...it was solely
then- decision to pay themselves.
FLiCKS can happen with or without
that. You could argue that any stu
dent group could do better if it had
officer salaries."
FLiCKS' budget for the previous
fiscal year requested the same
amount for officer salaries but ex
plained the amount in more detail. In
2012-13, the organization paid $l,OOO
per quarter to executives the
president, vice president and finan
cial manager and paid three "fel
lows" another $lOO per quarter for
the year.
FLiCKS uses special fees fund
ing—which is levied from students
to pay officer salaries. According
to Haveles, however, the evidence

suggests that FLiCKS does not al
ways spend all of the funding that
the group allocates to officer salaries.
"We also talked to FLiCKS lead
ership [about] them not having a full
record of how much of that $9,000
they were spending," Haveles said.
"We thought that they were budget
ing too high for officer salaries."
Haveles suggested that the un
spent funds from requests for officer
salaries had been used to build up
the group's reserve funds. For the
fiscal year 2012-13, the organization
had a reserve of $15,735.36.
Kirshner defended FLiCKS'
salaries by describing the organiza
tion as a business providing a service
to the Stanford community.
"The reason we are not like other
groups [who request special fees] is
that we are not really around a cen
tral theme," he said. "We offer a
service to the campus and the com
munity. There is no other motive for
us to do this other than a business
motivation."
Kirshner said that, in the past,

unpaid FLiCKS officers have quit
because they were not drawing a
salary.
"We have very concrete evidence
of what happens when we don't pay
our members," he said.
According to Haveles, FLiCKS'
rationale for four-figure salaries is
based more in history than in com
mon sense.
"It was mainly that they got it be
fore," Haveles said, explaining that
FLiCKS cited tradition as a reason
for their group's officer salaries.
Haveles added that the Senate
was worried about the precedent of
allowing one group's officers to pay
themselves.
"We didn't think that it was
call it whatever you want fair;" he
said. "Especially [salaries for] posi
tions that are similar in other
groups, like financial officer, for ex
ample. Their financial officer was
paying himself a thousand dollars."

ways spend all of the funding that
the group allocates to officer salaries.
"We also talked to FLiCKS lead
ership [about] them not having a full
record of how much of that $9,000
they were spending," Haveles said.
"We thought that they were budget
ing too high for officer salaries."
Haveles suggested that the un
spent funds from requests for officer
salaries had been used to build up
the group's reserve funds. For the
fiscal year 2012-13, the organization
had a reserve of $15,735.36.
Kirshner defended FLiCKS'
salaries by describing the organiza
tion as a business providing a service
to the Stanford community.
"The reason we are not like other
groups [who request special fees] is
that we are not really around a cen
tral theme," he said. "We offer a
service to the campus and the com
munity. There is no other motive for
us to do this other than a business
motivation."
Kirshner said that, in the past,

unpaid FLiCKS officers have quit
because they were not drawing a
salary.
"We have very concrete evidence
of what happens when we don't pay
our members," he said.
According to Haveles, FLiCKS'
rationale for four-figure salaries is
based more in history than in com
mon sense.
"It was mainly that they got it be
fore," Haveles said, explaining that
FLiCKS cited tradition as a reason
for their group's officer salaries.
Haveles added that the Senate
was worried about the precedent of
allowing one group's officers to pay
themselves.
"We didn't think that it was
call it whatever you want fair;" he
said. "Especially [salaries for] posi
tions that are similar in other
groups, like financial officer, for ex
ample. Their financial officer was
paying himself a thousand dollars."

FLiCKS, a student group that offers
free movies on campus, received
$91,000 including $9,900 for officer
salaries in special fees funding last
month, after the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate had rejected the group's fee
request based in part on those salaries.
FLiCKS officers have, however, de
fended their compensation, arguing
that FLiCKS has always been a busi
ness providing a specific service to stu
dents.
"We budget about $3,000 per quar
ter for officer salaries right now,"
FLiCKS President Rex Kirshner 'l3
said. "We consider all of our six mem
bers officers."
For their fiscal year 2013-14 budget,
FLiCKS had initially requested that the
ASSU approve their fee request of
$91,000 without having to use the spe
cial fees ballot. That request was reject
ed in February.
"We initially thought that we would
just get [our new budget approval] from
the Senate," Kirshner said. "They saw
our budget and didn't like parts of it,
and just rejected it, out of the blue."
"We were not a hundred percent
sure why the budget was rejected," said
Kit Evans 'l3, FLiCKS' director of spe
cial events.
Christos Haveles 'l5, deputy chair of
the Senate's Appropriations Committee
at the time, said that the Senate's rejec
tion of FLiCKS' request was based in
part on the salaries sought.
"We rejected their budget mainly
because of the first line item on their
budget, for officer salary," he said. "It
was going to be split amongst the six
officers in their interview, they ex
plained that this money is for all offi
cers."
In the group's application to the
ASSU, officer salaries were described
as "discretionary pay for FLiCKS offi
cers." Haveles said that FLiCKS'
budget allocates salaries to the Finan
cial Officer and President, but all oth
er members are paid by the hour.
"I know their marketing director
reported the most hours," Haveles
said. "It's all pretty much self-report
ed, and I am not sure exactly how
much it is per hour."
Kirshner noted that the FLiCKS
budget the fourth most expensive
undergraduate-only budget voted on
by students mostly goes towards
the infrastructure necessary to screen
a movie.
"A lot of the budget is for special
events, like special screenings," Evans
added, citing an event during fall quar
ter when FLiCKS showed an advance
screening of the musical comedy
"Pitch Perfect."
However, Haveles said that con
cerns over the budget didn't come
from those expenses.
"Those fixed costs of getting good-
quality movies for showing was an
understandable cost," Haveles said.
"The officer salary...it was solely
then- decision to pay themselves.
FLiCKS can happen with or without
that. You could argue that any stu
dent group could do better if it had
officer salaries."
FLiCKS' budget for the previous
fiscal year requested the same
amount for officer salaries but ex
plained the amount in more detail. In
2012-13, the organization paid $l,OOO
per quarter to executives the
president, vice president and finan
cial manager and paid three "fel
lows" another $lOO per quarter for
the year.
FLiCKS uses special fees fund
ing—which is levied from students
to pay officer salaries. According
to Haveles, however, the evidence

suggests that FLiCKS does not al
ways spend all of the funding that
the group allocates to officer salaries.
"We also talked to FLiCKS lead
ership [about] them not having a full
record of how much of that $9,000
they were spending," Haveles said.
"We thought that they were budget
ing too high for officer salaries."
Haveles suggested that the un
spent funds from requests for officer
salaries had been used to build up
the group's reserve funds. For the
fiscal year 2012-13, the organization
had a reserve of $15,735.36.
