# Patience is key in finding the right coach

Will they never learn?
Sunday saw the re
tirement of per
haps the greatest
ever soccer manag
er, Sir Alex Ferguson. It is impossible
not to respect the phenomenal achieve
ments that the departing boss of Man
chester United had in his 26 years in
charge, whether or not you hate him
for that success.
He bullied referees and players
around and arrogantly refused to ever
see blame in his actions, or in those of
his team. He also took Manchester
United to 13 English Premier League
titles, two Champions League trophies
and five FA. Cups, plus a sprinkling of
other trophies. In the process, he
turned United irom a mid-level club in
to one of the handful that can claim to
be the biggest and best in the entire
world. Few fans in their right mind
would not wish he had been in charge
of their favorite team instead.
On the same weekend that he final
ly stood down, across the other side of
Manchester, rival Manchester City
was on the brink of waving goodbye to
its own manager in far less fiiendly cir
cumstances. Following an uninspiring
performance in Saturday's FA. Cup
Final loss to Wigan, a game in which
City was the clear favorite to win, Man
chester City manager Roberto Manci
ni was fired Monday
In Mancini's short four-year spell
at Manchester City, his team picked up
one English Premier League title and
one FA. Cup. It also qualified for the
Champions League for the first time in
club history in 2011 and has repeated
that feat in the following two seasons.
However, performances in the top Eu
ropean competition have left a lot to be
desired, and an overall winning per
centage of 59.2 —for comparison, Fer
guson's was 59.7—wi1l not save him.
Thrn the clock back 20-odd years
though, and Ferguson had a far worse
record. Joining the club halfway
through the 1986-87 season, he could
only rescue 11th place in his first year.
A second-placed finish the next year
hinted at firture success, but that was
Mowed by 11th and 13th in his third
and fourth seasons, respectively Only
an FA. Cup trophy in 1990 saved his
job, and the rest, as they say, is history.
In today's world, Ferguson would
not have survived. The average life of a
Premiership manager is painfully
short. Just five of the current 20 have
been in their posts longer than Manci
ni while 11 were appointed within the
last 12 months. The expectations of im
mediate and lasting success have got
ten out of hand; the threat of the axe
perhaps even makes that very success
impossible, as managers are never giv
en the breathing space or time to mold
the club in their image.
Viewed through this same lens, the
Stanford women's water polo team has
had a poor season and perhaps head
coach John Tanner should be worried.
On Sunday, it came up short for the
third time this season against USC,
losing the NCAA Final in quadruple
overtime.
This shouldn't have happened, of
course. The national champion over
the previous two years, Stanford was
joined by three gold-medal winning
Olympians this season, including
freshman Maggie Steffens, who was
named the Most Valuable Player of the
women's water polo tournament at the
2012 London Olympics. The Cardinal
was justifiably the preseason favorite,
expected to cruise to a third-straight
national title in an undefeated fashion.
But it didn't. Not because the play
ers failed, not because Thnner failed
the players, but because there are sim
ply no guarantees in sports. The best
personnel that money can buy—or
recruiting can secure —will never
guarantee success.
Stanford has a lot in common with
some of the world's biggest soccer
clubs. It has far more money than it
could possibly need, and few would
turn down the opportunity to play or
coach at Stanford. But the Cardinal's
approach to success is the complete op
posite; this university could teach all
the soccer clubs a lot.
Faced with men's basketball head
coach Johnny Dawkins' struggle to live
up to the expectations set by Cardinal
athletics in general, Stanford's ap
proach is to stand by him. Though he
may need a place in the 2014 NCAA
Tournament to save his job, few other
colleges might have even given him
that chance at salvation.
As a fan, Stanford's refusal to give
up on Dawkins can seem frustrating.
Less than 10 years ago this university
was a men's basketball power, a far
cry from this past season's failure
