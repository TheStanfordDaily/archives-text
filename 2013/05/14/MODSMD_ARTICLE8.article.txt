## HEADING TO GEORGIA 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Despite a dismal first round per
formance, the No. 10 Stanford
women's golf team bounced back
nicely over the final two days of the
NCAA West Regional to finish fifth
on its home course. The top-eight
finish at the regional advances the
Cardinal to next week's NCAA
Championship in Athens, Ga.
Thursday's first round saw
Stanford post a 17-over 301, putting
itself in an uncomfortable 4-way tie
for 12th. Star freshman Mariah

Stackhouse made an uncharacteris
tic six bogeys in the first round,
while the rest of her teammates
combined for six double-bogeys.
The story of the end of a great sea
son seemed to write itself: A young
team with only two out of five
players having collegiate postsea
son experience ran out of gas
and was ready to fold.
"We were obviously disappoint
ed in our first round because our
goal this week was to win," said
head coach Anne Walker. "After
shooting plus-17, we knew that to
win we had to do something special

in the final two rounds."
That it did. The Stanford women
improved their play dramatically in
the second round, recording the
lowest team score of the day with
an even-par 284. Stackhouse low
ered her score six strokes from the
previous day, shooting a 2-under
par 69.
Stackhouse could have finished
even better; the freshman was sit
ting at 5-under for the round after
back-to-back birdies on the 12th
and 13th, but went 3-over in her fi
nal three holes.
"Honestly, nobody on the team

seemed to be downcast after Thurs
day's rough performance," Stack
house said. "I think we all expected
to go out Friday and put up much
better numbers and jump back into
the top eight. I was very proud of
the way we handled that initial set
back and our positive attitudes
moving forward."
Fellow freshman Lauren Kim
also played much better in second
round, going from a 3-over 74 to an
even-par 71. Though Kim knew the
course would play tougher than it

Freshman Lauren Kim (above), like her teammates, struggled in Thursday's first round at the NCAA West Regional as Stanford finished the day
in a tie for 12th. Kim and the Cardinal responded to shoot the best round of the day on Friday, moving up to fifth place, where it
would remain on Saturday. As one of the top-eight teams in the Regional, Stanford earned a berth in next week's NCAA Championships.
