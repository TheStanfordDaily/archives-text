## HEADING TO GEORGIA 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Despite a dismal first round per
formance, the No. 10 Stanford
women's golf team bounced back
nicely over the final two days of the
NCAA West Regional to finish fifth
on its home course. The top-eight
finish at the regional advances the
Cardinal to next week's NCAA
Championship in Athens, Ga.
Thursday's first round saw
Stanford post a 17-over 301, putting
itself in an uncomfortable 4-way tie
for 12th. Star freshman Mariah

Stackhouse made an uncharacteris
tic six bogeys in the first round,
while the rest of her teammates
combined for six double-bogeys.
The story of the end of a great sea
son seemed to write itself: A young
team with only two out of five
players having collegiate postsea
son experience ran out of gas
and was ready to fold.
"We were obviously disappoint
ed in our first round because our
goal this week was to win," said
head coach Anne Walker. "After
shooting plus-17, we knew that to
win we had to do something special

in the final two rounds."
That it did. The Stanford women
improved their play dramatically in
the second round, recording the
lowest team score of the day with
an even-par 284. Stackhouse low
ered her score six strokes from the
previous day, shooting a 2-under
par 69.
Stackhouse could have finished
even better; the freshman was sit
ting at 5-under for the round after
back-to-back birdies on the 12th
and 13th, but went 3-over in her fi
nal three holes.
"Honestly, nobody on the team

seemed to be downcast after Thurs
day's rough performance," Stack
house said. "I think we all expected
to go out Friday and put up much
better numbers and jump back into
the top eight. I was very proud of
the way we handled that initial set
back and our positive attitudes
moving forward."
Fellow freshman Lauren Kim
also played much better in second
round, going from a 3-over 74 to an
even-par 71. Though Kim knew the
course would play tougher than it

Freshman Lauren Kim (above), like her teammates, struggled in Thursday's first round at the NCAA West Regional as Stanford finished the day
in a tie for 12th. Kim and the Cardinal responded to shoot the best round of the day on Friday, moving up to fifth place, where it
would remain on Saturday. As one of the top-eight teams in the Regional, Stanford earned a berth in next week's NCAA Championships.
had during the Peg Barnard Invita
tional in February, the home course
advantage played in the team's fa
vor.
"We have played that course so
many times that it really didn't play
that [differently] during Regionals,"
commented Kim. "The pins were
tougher, which I think is what con
tributed to the higher scores, but
other than that the course was pret
ty similar to how we have been play
ing it in practice."
Both Kim and Walker noted that
the team was more comfortable
starting in the afternoon wave as
it did on Friday since that is usu
ally the time of day the team prac
tices on the course.
Another reason for Stanford's
vault into the top eight on Friday
was the solid play of sophomore
Mariko Tumangan. Ttimangan fol
lowed her opening day 3-over 74
with a second round 1-under per
formance that included three
birdies and two bogeys. That put
her in a tie for 12th in the individual
race with Stackhouse and three oth
ers at 2-over-par.
"Mariko had a terrific tourna
ment," Walker said. "We have been
working hard on Mariko's confi
dence all year and it is beginning to
pay off. It is no surprise to me that

we have seen Mariko rise to the top
at the end of the season. She is a
big-time player."
Senior Sally Watson bounced
back from her worst competitive
round ever at the Stanford Golf
Course on Thursday to shoot 3-over
74 on Friday.
Saturday's third and final round
saw the Cardinal hold steady and
retain its fifth place position. Indi
vidually, Tumangan and Watson tied
for the team low at 1-over-pai; while
Stackhouse, Kim and junior Danielle
Frasier all concluded their tourna
ments with 2-over-par final rounds.
For the second year in a row, Tu
mangan ended up being her team's
lowest scorer at the Regionals, fin
ishing in a four-way tie for 10th at 3-
over-par. Stackhouse was one
stroke behind her in a tie for 14th,
and Kim one off Stackhouse in a tie
for 18th.
The overall team race saw No. 1
USC (+7) come from behind to
knock off No. 7 Purdue (+8), as the
Trojans overcame a two-stroke
deficit heading into the final round.
No. 8 Vanderbilt (+l7) placed a dis
tant third, and tournament surprise
No. 33 South Carolina (+22) was
fourth, one stroke in front of Stan
ford.
The other NCAA Tournament
qualifiers out of the West Region
were Pac-12 teams No. 9 Arizona
and No. 38 Oregon, which finished
in a tie for sixth, and local squad San
Jose State.
The individual race was quite a

show on Saturday, as Purdue's
Paula Reto fired a 5-under 66 to tie
tournament frontrunner and N CAA
No.l Annie Park of USC at 7-under.
Both golfers were credited with a
victory.
Also on Saturday, Park's team
mate Kyung Kim scorched the
course with an 8-under 63, record
ing a birdie on five of her final seven
holes to move into a tie for third
place.
This will be the fourth consecu
tive NCAA Championship appear
ance for Stanford. In the three pre
vious years, the team has finished
19th, 23rd and 24th, respectively, in
the 24-team field. In order to avoid
placing in the bottom-half of the
field, Walker believes that her team
has to focus on their driving.
"We have to work on our ball
striking," Walker said of the team.
"The National Championship
course is very long, over 200 yards
longer than the average in-season
course. For us to play well, we have
to be striking the ball well."
For Stackhouse, the trip will be a
homecoming and an opportunity to
play in front of her family and many
in-state supporters. The No. 3
ranked golfer in the country knows
the UGA course well, having played
the local circuit many times.
The 2013 NCAA Championship
begins May 21 at the University of
Georgia Golf Course in Athens.
