The match marked the first

5-9 SEC) in the seven times the
teams have played each other.
After defeating Stanford, LSU

lost 4-0 to No. 12 Pepperdine
on Saturday afternoon.
"There was a lot of positive
energy," said freshman Nolan
Paige. "I really felt like we had
a good opportunity, but unfor
tunately we came up a little
short."
The Cardinal earned an at
large berth in the tournament
after suffering a 4-0 defeat at
the hands of No. 1 UCLA in
the semifinals of the Pac-12
Championships.
Stanford ended the season

Senior Denis Lin (above) picked up a win in his last Stanford
doubles match, but it wasn't enough as the Cardinal fell to
No. 20 LSU in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
first round of the SEC Champi
onships to No. 17 South Carolina, the
team was one of 11 SEC schools to
book a trip to the NCAA Tourna
ment. Arkansas was the only team in
the SEC that failed to earn a spot in
the 64-team field.
The Cardinal started strong
against LSU, with senior Denis Lin
and sophomore John Morrissey
picking up an 8-6 victory at No. 1
doubles over the Tigers' Stefan
Szacinski and Tam Trinh.
Juniors Jamin Ball and Daniel
Ho lost 8-5 to LSU's Boris Arias and
Chris Simpson, but the Cardinal
managed to take the doubles point
with an 8-6 win at No. 2 doubles from
freshman Maciek Romanowicz and
sophomore Robert Stineman, who
defeated Roger Anderson and Olivi
er Borsos.
However, LSU quickly put an
end to Stanford's momentum by tak

ing the first three singles matches.
Paige, who played No. 3 singles, was
the first to finish, losing 6-1, 6-1 to
Borsos.
"I played really badly," Paige
said. "I'm kind of in a slump right
now, which is frustrating because I
couldn't help the team to win."
Senior Matt Kandath, who
played No. 2 singles, lost 6-0, 6-2 to
Szacinski in the final match of his col
legiate career, and the Cardinal's No.
6 singles player, Lin, suffered a clos
er 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Trinh.
LSU needed one more point to
close the match, but Ho, who played
No. 5 singles, put Stanford back into
play with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Arias.
LSU managed to clinch the victory
when Morrissey, who played No. 1
singles, lost 7-5,6-1 to Simpson.
"I think it was just maybe not the
best day for some of us, and we did
n't take advantage of some opportu
nities," Paige said. "There wasn't too
much of a gap between us [and
LSU], which was frustrating."
While Stanford has amassed a
103-19 NCAA Tournament record
and racked up 15 national team

championships since 1977, the Cardi
nal struggled this year with a rela
tively young team. The singles lineup
was composed of three freshmen,
two sophomores and a junior for
most of the season.
Last year, Stanford advanced to
the NCAA, quarterfinals under the
leadership of Bradley Klahn 'l2 and
Ryan Thacher 'l2. Klahn was an
NCAA singles champion in 2010 and
the duo of Klahn and Thacher fin
ished second in doubles in 2011.
Needless to say, the team has gone
through a difficult rebuilding period
after they graduated last year.
Though Paige expressed disap
pointment in the Cardinal's failure to
progress further in the NCAA
Championships, he said that the
team is already looking forward to
future seasons, and hopefully benefit
from the experience gained this year.
"We have a lot of starters coming
back next year," Paige said. "We
should be able to have a big year, so
that's exciting."
