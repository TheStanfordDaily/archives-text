# Broncos pitcher shuts down Card
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
At this point in the season,
the Stanford baseball players
are getting all too familiar
with the adage "when it
rains, it pours." The scuffling
Cardinal is in the midst of a
torrential downpour right
now and it's not at all pretty.

On Tuesday evening, the
Cardinal (26-21, 11-13 Pac
-12) hit rock bottom as it fell
to Santa Clara (13-37, 0-21
WCC) by a score of 3-0 as
Stanford extended its losing
streak to six games, spanning
arguably the most important
stretch of its season.
Stanford's bats fell com
pletely lifeless as Broncos
senior righty Tommy Nance
tossed a complete-game mas
terpiece and kept the Cardi
nal hitters from making solid
contact all evening. Nance
only allowed one Stanford
hitter to reach second base
and was dominant all the way
through, going the distance

with a gutsy 112-pitch effort.
Nance collected six strikeouts,
walked only one, and scattered six
hits, never facing more than five
batters in any inning. The strong
pitching came as a complete sur
prise to the Cardinal, as Santa
Clara's pitching staff entered the
contest with an atrocious 5.60 staff
ERA. Nance himself dropped his
ERA by almost a full run as a result
of the performance from a
mediocre 4.58 to a more respectable
3.72.
"For the most part he was just
throwing strikes," said Stanford
senior designated hitter Justin
Ringo. "I don't think we gave our
best effort today hitting. He was
better than the average guy we
faced on Tuesdays but he wasn't
much better than a lot of guys we
see on the weekend. I don't think it
was a lack of effort, I just think it
was one of those days."
Ringo had a 2-for-4 day at the
plate against Nance, the only Stan
ford hitter to record multiple hits
off of the Broncos right-hander.
Both times he was left stranded at
first base, highlighting the major
problem of the night for Stanford
hitting: a chronic inability to ad
vance runners and make use of its
limited offensive opportunities.
In the third inning, freshman
shortstop Drew Jackson singled to
right field before being caught
stealing second base to quench the
potential threat. In the seventh,
junior centerfielder Austin Wilson
singled to center to lead off the in

ning but was unable to advance, as
junior backstop Brant Whiting hit
into an inning-ending double play.
The Cardinal had one final hope
in the bottom of the ninth inning
down three runs when junior first
baseman Brian Ragira walked to
lead off the inning. However, the
next hitter, the usually powerful
Wilson, hit a routine ground ball to
shortstop that was turned into an
easy 6-4-3 double play and put the
final nail in Stanford's coffin.
Freshman righty Bobby Zaru
bin took the hill for the Cardinal,
hoping to bounce back from a less
than-stellar outing last Tuesday
against San Francisco in which he
was pounded for four runs on nine
hits. This time around he was more
solid, allowing only two runs in four
innings of work. Unfortunately,
those two runs were enough to do
him in on a night when his offense
couldn't get anything going.
The bullpen, however, deserves
its share of credit as it limited the
Broncos to only three more hits in
the remaining five innings of play.
Sophomore righty Jordan Kutzer,
redshirt junior lefty Garrett Hugh
es, junior righty A. J. Vanegas and
freshman lefty Logan James kept
the game close to keep the offense
within striking distance.
Of the quartet, only Vanegas
struggled in his outing, allowing a
runner to cross the plate on a four
pitch, bases-loaded walk in the

ninth inning. However, that was not
necessarily his fault, as he was the
victim of sloppy defensive play.
He struck out the first two hit
ters in order before inducing a lazy
pop-up to second base that should
have ended the inning but was al
lowed to drop by junior second
baseman Danny Diekroeger, who
was yielding to a charging Wilson
from center field. The batter made
it all the way to second base once
the dust cleared.
Vanegas was able to induce a
playable ground ball to short from
the next hitter, but normally sure
handed freshman shortstop Drew
Jackson was unable to play it clean
ly and both runners advanced. Af
ter that, Vanegas' control failed him
and he walked the bases loaded be
fore walking in an insurance run for
Santa Clara.
Going into a three-game series
at rival Cal next weekend, the Car
dinal desperately needed the victo
ry today against the clearly worst
team in the WCC. The Broncos' 0-
21 conference record was not a ty
po. However, Stanford, now all but
eliminated from playoff contention,
will be forced to push into the final
stretch of the season with a bad
taste in its mouth thanks to the sur
prisingly dominant right arm of
Tommy Nance.

the remaining five innings of play.
Sophomore righty Jordan Kutzer,
redshirt junior lefty Garrett Hugh
es, junior righty A. J. Vanegas and
freshman lefty Logan James kept
the game close to keep the offense
within striking distance.
Of the quartet, only Vanegas
struggled in his outing, allowing a
runner to cross the plate on a four
pitch, bases-loaded walk in the

ninth inning. However, that was not
necessarily his fault, as he was the
victim of sloppy defensive play.
He struck out the first two hit
ters in order before inducing a lazy
pop-up to second base that should
have ended the inning but was al
lowed to drop by junior second
baseman Danny Diekroeger, who
was yielding to a charging Wilson
from center field. The batter made
it all the way to second base once
the dust cleared.
Vanegas was able to induce a
playable ground ball to short from
the next hitter, but normally sure
handed freshman shortstop Drew
Jackson was unable to play it clean
ly and both runners advanced. Af
ter that, Vanegas' control failed him
and he walked the bases loaded be
fore walking in an insurance run for
Santa Clara.
Going into a three-game series
at rival Cal next weekend, the Car
dinal desperately needed the victo
ry today against the clearly worst
team in the WCC. The Broncos' 0-
21 conference record was not a ty
po. However, Stanford, now all but
eliminated from playoff contention,
will be forced to push into the final
stretch of the season with a bad
taste in its mouth thanks to the sur
prisingly dominant right arm of
Tommy Nance.

At this point in the season,
the Stanford baseball players
are getting all too familiar
with the adage "when it
rains, it pours." The scuffling
Cardinal is in the midst of a
torrential downpour right
now and it's not at all pretty.

On Tuesday evening, the
Cardinal (26-21, 11-13 Pac
-12) hit rock bottom as it fell
to Santa Clara (13-37, 0-21
WCC) by a score of 3-0 as
Stanford extended its losing
streak to six games, spanning
arguably the most important
stretch of its season.
Stanford's bats fell com
pletely lifeless as Broncos
senior righty Tommy Nance
tossed a complete-game mas
terpiece and kept the Cardi
nal hitters from making solid
contact all evening. Nance
only allowed one Stanford
hitter to reach second base
and was dominant all the way
through, going the distance

Senior designated hitter Justin Ringo (above) was the only Stanford player to record multiple hits, thanks to a
masterful performance by Santa Clara pitcher Tommy Nance. The Broncos did not give up a single run.
with a gutsy 112-pitch effort.
Nance collected six strikeouts,
walked only one, and scattered six
hits, never facing more than five
batters in any inning. The strong
pitching came as a complete sur
prise to the Cardinal, as Santa
Clara's pitching staff entered the
contest with an atrocious 5.60 staff
ERA. Nance himself dropped his
ERA by almost a full run as a result
of the performance from a
mediocre 4.58 to a more respectable
3.72.
"For the most part he was just
throwing strikes," said Stanford
senior designated hitter Justin
Ringo. "I don't think we gave our
best effort today hitting. He was
better than the average guy we
faced on Tuesdays but he wasn't
much better than a lot of guys we
see on the weekend. I don't think it
was a lack of effort, I just think it
was one of those days."
Ringo had a 2-for-4 day at the
plate against Nance, the only Stan
ford hitter to record multiple hits
off of the Broncos right-hander.
Both times he was left stranded at
first base, highlighting the major
problem of the night for Stanford
hitting: a chronic inability to ad
vance runners and make use of its
limited offensive opportunities.
In the third inning, freshman
shortstop Drew Jackson singled to
right field before being caught
stealing second base to quench the
potential threat. In the seventh,
junior centerfielder Austin Wilson
singled to center to lead off the in

ning but was unable to advance, as
junior backstop Brant Whiting hit
into an inning-ending double play.
The Cardinal had one final hope
in the bottom of the ninth inning
down three runs when junior first
baseman Brian Ragira walked to
lead off the inning. However, the
next hitter, the usually powerful
Wilson, hit a routine ground ball to
shortstop that was turned into an
easy 6-4-3 double play and put the
final nail in Stanford's coffin.
Freshman righty Bobby Zaru
bin took the hill for the Cardinal,
hoping to bounce back from a less
than-stellar outing last Tuesday
against San Francisco in which he
was pounded for four runs on nine
hits. This time around he was more
solid, allowing only two runs in four
innings of work. Unfortunately,
those two runs were enough to do
him in on a night when his offense
couldn't get anything going.
The bullpen, however, deserves
its share of credit as it limited the
Broncos to only three more hits in
the remaining five innings of play.
