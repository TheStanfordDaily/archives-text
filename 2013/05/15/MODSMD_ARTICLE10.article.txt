# Broncos pitcher shuts down Card
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
At this point in the season,
the Stanford baseball players
are getting all too familiar
with the adage "when it
rains, it pours." The scuffling
Cardinal is in the midst of a
torrential downpour right
now and it's not at all pretty.

On Tuesday evening, the
Cardinal (26-21, 11-13 Pac
-12) hit rock bottom as it fell
to Santa Clara (13-37, 0-21
WCC) by a score of 3-0 as
Stanford extended its losing
streak to six games, spanning
arguably the most important
stretch of its season.
Stanford's bats fell com
pletely lifeless as Broncos
senior righty Tommy Nance
tossed a complete-game mas
terpiece and kept the Cardi
nal hitters from making solid
contact all evening. Nance
only allowed one Stanford
hitter to reach second base
and was dominant all the way
through, going the distance

Senior designated hitter Justin Ringo (above) was the only Stanford player to record multiple hits, thanks to a
masterful performance by Santa Clara pitcher Tommy Nance. The Broncos did not give up a single run.
