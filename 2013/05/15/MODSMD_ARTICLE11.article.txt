## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR The 						Daily Does Its Due Diligence 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH Editor in Chief 
I woke up early this morning,
rolled over, checked my laptop
and opened an email labeled
URGENT. It was from a senior
University official who was inform
ing me that The Daily had published
a libelous story.
Uh oh.
The next 10 minutes of my
browser history are filled with
Google searches for "defamation
lawsuits with newspapers,"
Supreme Court case briefs, blogs on
libel and the like.
But as I continued to comb
through the Internet, fearful that I
fallen asleep in my journalism ethics
class or in the host of communica
tion's classes that have touched on
libel, slander and the like, I began
almost to laugh.
It certainly wasn't because I or
any other staffer here at The Daily
takes the accusation of defamation
or libel anything less than extreme
ly seriously (my news editor would
later call me some hours later in
somewhat of a panic after waking up
to the same email).
No, my amusement was rather
directed at the gall of the University
to send me a message that carried
with it the threat of libel, a message
that I felt at least in some way had
to be sent with an air of intimidation.
The story in question was one I
believe has extreme importance to
the student body and Stanford com
munity. "Case study finds flawed,
slanted judicial process," details a
case study put together by three
students and their representative,
Bob Ottilie, '77, after a 2011 judicial
proceeding. The students say that
several of their rights under the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997
were obstructed and that it seemed
unlikely that their case was merely
the lone outlier of a system that saw
154 allegations of violations of either
the Honor Code or Fundamental
Standard in 2010-2011, of which 93
cases were charged.
This should matter to you, stu
dents, and you, alums, and you staff
and faculty and administrators. The
case study is thorough, and if half of
the allegations of misconduct were
to be true, students should simply
be scared enough to call for more
transparency in the judicial affairs
process as a whole.
And if the allegations are false,
then I beg the University to call Bob
Otillie and these three students out
for concocting this gross lie and to
call me out for believing in the cha
rade. But at this moment, I have
heard nothing of substance that
would lead me to believe that this
study is anything but true.
I know that there are privacy
laws that must be obeyed and I
know this might put an unfair expec
tation on University officials to an
swer questions they say they are not
allowed to on advice of counsel. This,
then, appears to be an unfortunate
impasse for both parties, as we must
deal in facts and quotes if we are to
have any real credibility.

In The Daily's follow-up investi
gation of the case and the subsequent
interviews that we conducted, Uni
versity officials noted disagreements
with some aspects of the case and
contested the light in which it paints
some of the officials involved. Dean of
Student Life, Chris Griffith, notes in
a letter to the editor on this very
page that "to extrapolate from a sin
gle anomalous case than an entire
system is flawed is simply wrong."
I wholeheartedly agree.
However, Griffith also says de
spite being "seriously flawed and in
accurate" in many instances, "the
case study was helpful in some limit
ed respects."
If the study was helpful, does
that not mean that at the very least,
some of what was said was accurate?
Does that not imply that somewhere
in the preponderance of evidence
that Otillie and these students pro
vide (the case study itself is over 50
pages) that something stuck?
That's what it says to me, and
that is what scares me, because in
my mind that begins a descent
down a slippery slope that trends
towards students not being aware
of many of the rights they posses
and ultimately ends with an inno
cent student being convicted in an
unfair process. I am not saying that
this has occurred, as I have no
knowledge of any such case, but I
am saying that it is our role at The
Daily to be vigilant and watchful
and to report on issues that we be
lieve should be moved further into
the light of day.
In short, this is a story worth
telling, and I hope administrators
can appreciate that just as there is
value in doing your jobs to the best
of your ability with the goal to im
prove Stanford, student life and the
world, there is value in my job and
The Daily's job to educate and in
form students and the community
about relevant issues.
And while I have no way of
knowing whether or not the actions
of the senior official who contacted
me were at the direction of the Gen
eral Counsel or any other group of
University administrators, they felt
and read strongly like intimidation.
Perhaps I am overreacting, and
the email and phone call I received
20 minutes later were just a misguid
ed attempt to warn me of my expo
sure at The Daily. Certainly the call
was neither intimidating nor berat
ing as I explained my confusion as to
how the story we published would in
any way qualify as libel.
In fact, after I noted that The
Daily had done its due diligence and
was neither malicious nor negligent
in its perusal of the story, the official
was very agreeable. That does not
make the email go away, or change
the tone of what read as a threat of
a lawsuit should The Daily not take
the story down and redact the
names of the officials alleged to have
done wrong.
Just as I believe that students
care enough about what happens on
this campus to find the truth for
themselves, I believe The Daily has
a responsibility to inform its read
ers of potential misconduct and will
continue to do so, right alongside
the overwhelming body of out
standing work that emanates from
this institution.
