# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## 
### CHRIS GRIFFITH Dean of Student Life 
Deal 1 Editor,
The Office of Student Life and
the Office of Community Stan
dards have always welcomed
discussion with students regarding
the University's student conduct
process. In fact, the Student Judicial
Charter of 1997 was created primari
ly by students/or students and with
students in mind. Student participa
tion in the process is not only essen
tial and valued, it is at the very heart
of the process.
It is important to recognize that the
Student Judicial Charter created a
system that seeks the truth and stress
es education. It is by design not adver
sarial. And, like any system, improve
ments can be considered, flaws cor
rected, and processes strengthened.
Unfortunately, the current discus
sion, reflected in The Daily's story
yesterday, has been poorly served by
a "case study" based on an anom
alous example. The case study was
helpful in some limited respects, but
is seriously flawed and inaccurate in
many others. To extrapolate from a
single anomalous case that an entire
system is flawed is simply wrong. In
fact, a recent and very thorough re
view of the system concluded that it
is fundamentally sound.
The Daily article contains allega

tions that must be addressed. It is ab
solutely false that the charter or that
any staff member involved in the
process assumes guilt. It is absolute
ly false that staff members intimidate
participants involved in the process,
"go after" students to get "convic
tions" or are "willfully indifferent to
rights." And, it is false that panelists
are untrained or biased.
As we have shared with the au
thor of the "case study" and The Dai
ly, both California employment laws
and the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act prevent us from dis
cussing the "case study" in terms of
individual alleged actions.
Refinements can always be made.
During the past six months, the Uni
versity, based on a comprehensive in
ternal review, has appointed a new di
rector for the Office of Community
Standards, reorganized the office,
clarified roles and implemented sys
tems to make the process more effi
cient.
We invite students to continue to
engage in this process, which has a
high degree of student involvement
already We welcome and look for
ward to the conversation and their
participation.
