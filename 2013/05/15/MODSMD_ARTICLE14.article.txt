Privilege. I always misspell it
and often define it too nar
rowly. There's the white kind,
the Ivy League kind, the kind to
feel guilty about, the kind to use as
a platform for change, the kind that
got taken away when you were
grounded in high school. There is
privilege as the value of your yearly
income or privilege as the value of
the experiences you have. There is
privilege you earn and privilege you
stumble into. At a place like Stan
ford, I'm swimming in privilege, but
what kinds exactly?
In high school, I remember
many sensitive lectures on privi
lege, especially about how impor
tant it is to be aware of the privilege
you have since not everyone has the
same. The message I first took
away from this was that since I had
the great fortune of going to private
school in San Francisco, I should
feel awfully guilty about having
something that other people did
not. I advise against the guilt. The
more you beat yourself up about
having things that others do not,
the less effective you are at provid
ing those things for other people.
All too often, privilege gets con

fined to mean the amount of money
you have at your disposal. It be
comes associated with being part of
the upper class and little else. I
would argue that at a place like
Stanford, privilege comes in many
more different shapes and sizes
that don't have a price tag attached.
The opportunity to choose your
course of study and pave your own
way in your classes counts as privi
lege. The chance to put down roots
in the Bay Area and call the Pacific
Ocean home counts as privilege.
Perhaps the greatest privilege of a
place like Stanford, at least in my
book, is not an open door to the up
per crust elite but the open doors to
meet people who come from a thou
sand different backgrounds entirely
unlike your own.
Stanford may give you access to
an elite education, an elite network,
elite recruitment opportunities for
elite jobs. But these privileges pale
in comparison to the privilege of
straddling the world that you come
from, the world that your roommate
comes from, and the worlds that
both of you are entering. What
makes the Stanford experience such
a privileged one is not necessarily ac-

cess to a certain social circle but
proximity to a diversity of social cir
cles that rarely come into contact ex
cept at places like universities.
My point is not an earthshatter
ing one. It's a simple readjustment
in how you look at a complicated
word. All too often I miss opportu
nities to feel grateful for the privi
lege I have at Stanford, either be
cause I fall into the guilt trap or be
cause I forget how many different
kinds of privilege I have. It's easy to
criticize elite institutions and uni
versities for a host of reasons that I
don't completely buy: greed, homo
geneity, elitism itself. Instead I urge
you to ease up on the criticism and
take a moment to look at the many
kinds of privilege you have at Stan
ford. Find away to define privilege
that makes sense for you, and use it
to do some good.
