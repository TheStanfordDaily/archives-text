## Metamaterials offer potential for invisibility 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A research team lecl by Assistant Profes
sor of Materials Science and Engineering Jen
nifer Dionne has made a significant step to
wards the eventual creation of an invisibility
cloak, having designed a metamaterial that in
teracts with a wide range of wavelengths of
light.
Dionne collaborated with fourth-year doc
toral student Ashwin Atre, fifth-year doctoral
student Hadiseh Alaeian and postdoctoral

scholar Aitzol Garcia-Etxarri on a study pub
lished in Advanced Optical Materials detailing
the team's findings.
While the researchers' design is new, scien
tists have worked with metamaterials arti
ficial materials that interact with light, mag
netism or other natural phenomena in unusu
al ways since 1999.
"A regular material derives its optical prop
erties from the chemical nature of its con
stituent atoms," Atre said. "In a metamaterial,
we design the structure of these artificial
atoms such that they interact with light in un

natural or extraordinary ways."
According to Garcia-Etxarri, Dionne's
team focused on developing a metamaterial
with a negative refraction index in order to
manipulate the path of light to "refract the
wrong way," which he said is not possible with
regular matter.
"The index dictates how light will travel
through a material, so if we can change that in
dex or that property, we can now change how
light propagates through a material," Atre
said. "That's sort of the basis
for the idea of an invisibility
cloak, in that you can control
light and force it to move
around an object so it never
interacts with the object it
self."
The research team worked
on the theoretical metamater
ial design for about two years,
according to Atre, and the
project was born out of the
group's investigation into how
a crescent shape interacts
with light.
Atre said that he and Gar
cia-Etxarri focused on the use
of a crescent shape in the de
sign of meta-atoms, while
Alaeian primarily investigat
ed how transformation optics
could be applied to the meta
material.
"The crescent shape has
been proposed in previous
work because it has sharp tips
and localizes the field of ener
gy at the tips," Alaeian said.
"It utilizes the highly confined
and large gradient field at the
tips of the crescent."
According to Alaeian, pre
viously demonstrated meta
materials have mostly worked
in regions of light with longer
wavelengths, such as the mi

crowave region. The metama
terial proposed by Dionne's
researchers would work with
a much larger range of light
wavelengths and colors.
"We were interested in
creating something to work in
the visible range of frequen
cy," she said. "Through this
paper we tried to propose the
idea, based on transformation
optics, for the methodology of
the design of these materials."
Atre agreed that the pri
mary challenge in developing
metamaterials is determining
how to allow for the material's
interaction with a wide range
of electric and magnetic wave
lengths, which is often prohib
ited by design complexities.
"To get a metamaterial to
interact with everything from
blue light through to red light
and really cloak an object to
visible light that we can see,
[doing] that has remained a
challenge and still is a chal
lenge," he said. "Our design is
one step closer to that goal in
that we have increased the

bandwidth that it can interact
with light so now it covers a
bandwidth that is twice that of
previous metamaterials."
Moving forward, the
group hopes to apply their
theoretical design to the fabri
cation of an actual metamate
rial. Researchers emphasized,
however, that there are many
barriers to be overcome be
fore a real invisibility cloak
can be created, such as fabri
cating the material over a
large area and preventing the
light that passes through the
material from being dimin
ished.
"What we did is [take] one
step forward in one of the
main challenges in metamate
rials, which is their ability to
work on a wide wavelength,"
Garcia-Etxarri said. "The ap
plications are still very far
away in terms of feasibility,
but this is one step forward
and we are happy with it."
