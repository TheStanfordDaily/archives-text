## Metamaterials offer potential for invisibility 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A research team lecl by Assistant Profes
sor of Materials Science and Engineering Jen
nifer Dionne has made a significant step to
wards the eventual creation of an invisibility
cloak, having designed a metamaterial that in
teracts with a wide range of wavelengths of
light.
Dionne collaborated with fourth-year doc
toral student Ashwin Atre, fifth-year doctoral
student Hadiseh Alaeian and postdoctoral

scholar Aitzol Garcia-Etxarri on a study pub
lished in Advanced Optical Materials detailing
the team's findings.
While the researchers' design is new, scien
tists have worked with metamaterials arti
ficial materials that interact with light, mag
netism or other natural phenomena in unusu
al ways since 1999.
"A regular material derives its optical prop
erties from the chemical nature of its con
stituent atoms," Atre said. "In a metamaterial,
we design the structure of these artificial
atoms such that they interact with light in un

natural or extraordinary ways."
According to Garcia-Etxarri, Dionne's
team focused on developing a metamaterial
with a negative refraction index in order to
manipulate the path of light to "refract the
wrong way," which he said is not possible with
regular matter.
"The index dictates how light will travel
through a material, so if we can change that in
dex or that property, we can now change how
light propagates through a material," Atre
