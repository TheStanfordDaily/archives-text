### NEEL THAKKAR DESK EDITOR 
Stanford reported a yield rate of approxi
mately 76.7 percent for the Class of 2017 on
Tuesday a 3.7 percent increase from last
year's figure and the highest-ever in Universi
ty history, according to an email from Director
of Admission Colleen Lim M.A. 'BO.
"This record breaking year is a testament
to Stanford's extraordinary excellence and
spirit," Lim wrote in a statement. "Stanford is
undeniably a compelling place to learn and
live, and clearly these statistics indicate that
the world is aware of the transformative pow
ers and opportunities at Stanford."
The University also offered admission to 32
transfer students, out of 1,662 applicants, on May
10. This year's transfer admit rate of 1.9 percent
marked a further decline from last year's 2.2 per
cent rate and 2011's figure of 4.1 percent.
At 1,694 students, the Class of 2017 is
smaller than the two preceding classes and
may shrink further before fall quarter as stu
dents drop or defer enrollment. Last year, the
Office of Undergraduate Admission faced an
over-enrollment of about 50 students after
1,786 students accepted offers of admission.
This year's elevated yield rate is the latest
sign of the University's increasing selectivity.
Stanford offered admission to 2,210 students
this year out of a pool of 38,828 applicants,
producing its lowest-ever admissions rate
at 5.69 percent and its highest-ever num
ber of applications received.
By Tuesday, a number of peer institutions
had also released their yield rates for the
Class of 2017. Harvard, Princeton, the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and Brown reported
yields of 82, 68.7, 64.3 and 60 percent respec
tively.
