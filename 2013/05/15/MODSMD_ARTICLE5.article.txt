## ASSU talks refunding alcohol SSE currently rejects refund requests with alcohol line items 
### LUCY SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate's meeting on Tuesday evening was
relatively productive, as senators dis
cussed the possibility of future ASSU
funding for alcohol and a CEO vacancy
at Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE)
in addition to creating an ad-hoc com
mittee for town hall meetings.
At the beginning of the meeting's
open forum, ASSU Assistant Financial
Manger Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4
introduced the issue of alcohol reim
bursements by the ASSU. Trusheim
explained that, contrary to popular be
lief, general fees funding could poten
tially be used to reimburse alcohol pur
chases. Such funding, however, would
require policy action from the Senate.
"In previous years, the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate has thought that
they can't use their general fees to go
to alcohol," Trusheim said. "That is un
true. They can. This has come out as a
thing that is possible."
He stressed, however, that the Sen
ate would first have to draft a policy
that would pass muster with the Uni
versity.
"Until we have seen such a written
policy," Trusheim said, "[we] will be ex
ercising our authority to reduce our li
ability and not fund alcohol purchases."
The Senate seemed enthusiastic
about Trusheim's proposal, with only
three senators following up on his pres
entation. However, Trusheim warned
them that the decision to reimburse al-
cohol purchases would be
consequential.
"[Rinding alcohol] really
opens Pandora's box in terms
of problems that can start ris
ing in the ways that ASSU
money is used," he said. "We
need to think about exactly
what goes into providing
money out of the ASSU."
Town Halls
Senator Eilaf Osman 'l6
also proposed bimonthly town
hall meetings with senators in
attendance.
"Our job is to find out
what is happening on campus
and I think the best way to do
that is to have an open forum
and actually ask people about
what is happening around
us," Osman said.
The proposal was general
ly well received, with former
Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 and
Senator Nikos Liodakis 'l6
stating that they believed a
town hall meeting would offer
a very different student expe
rience.

However, Senator John-
Lancaster Finley 'l6 ex
pressed concern that such
meetings would simply re
peat the weekly Senate meet

ings and that the student
body might feel "bombarded
with too many meetings" to
attend.
"I think that there is an
implicit barrier to entry to
people coming here because
of the formality of this meet
ing," Bindra countered.
"Having an open, informal di
alogue would be really help
ful."
The creation of an ad-hoc
committee for town hall meet
ings, intended to discuss the
efficacy of town halls, passed
unanimously at the end of the
open forum. The committee
was tasked with designing,
organizing and implementing
any potential town halls.
In SSE business, Senator
Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6 voiced
concerns about the SSE's
search for a CEO.
SSE had hired an individ
ual Eitan Winer Pinkas 'l2
M.S. 'l2 but a sensitive hu
man resources matter has
prohibited SSE from allowing
him to continue in the posi
tion. The position remains un
filled, though training for the
position was supposed to be
gin at the start of winter
quarter.
"It's a big role,"
Mouzykantskii said. "I believe
that it is really concerning that
the state of affairs has led us to
the position that there is no vi
able candidate."

Senators weren't aware of
the situation, having failed to
learn about it from ASSU Fi
nancial Manager Neveen
Mahmoud 'll. Trusheim ex
plained that closed meetings,
required for sensitive human
resources matters, could only
take place if the public had
been informed 24 hours in ad
vance.
Unable to explain the situ
ation to senators at the time,
Mahmoud offered to discuss
it at a later date.
"I am happy to discuss de
tails next week, maybe all to
gether," she said. "We get
that this is a very important
thing and we have been work
ing tirelessly towards it."
Near the end of the meet
ing, Trusheim accused the
ASSU of conflating personnel
issues within the CEO search
with general apathy within
SSE towards filling the posi
tion.
"It's not like we don't get
that us not having a CEO is a
big issue," he said. "But this
whole insinuation that we
don't care about why there is
not a CEO of SSE, it's not like
we are not freaking out about
it ourselves."
The meeting closed with
the passage of 14 funding
bills.
