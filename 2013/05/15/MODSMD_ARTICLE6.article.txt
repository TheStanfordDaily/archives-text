## UAR holds focus groups on advising programs 
### LIAM KINNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Office of Undergraduate
Advising and Research (UAR) re
cently held freshman focus groups
to discuss improvements to intro
ductory advising programs for the
Class of 2017.
The 43 participating students
reviewed the utility of the Ap
proaching Stanford handbook, New
Student Orientation (NSO) and the
pre-major advisor (PMA) and aca
demic director (AD) programs. In
formation from the focus groups
will be studied in conjunction with
responses gathered from a revised
annual freshman advising survey,
which was sent out last week rather
than over the summer as had been

done previously.
Dean of Freshmen and Under
graduate Advising Rob Urstein,
who framed improvements in fresh
man programs as a principal goal,
said that the survey's revision and
earlier distribution was undertaken
to address a historical lack of re
sponses.
Some of the group's major dis
cussions dealt with questions such
as whether the Approaching Stan
ford handbook should be online for
easy access and how to solidify the
separate roles of PMAs and ADs,
which participants struggled to dis
tinguish from each other.
Another discussion revolved
around whether NSO program
ming properly addresses freshman
year decisions. While UAR sent out

a survey at the conclusion of this
year's NSO, Urstein described the
responses obtained as insufficiently
conclusive.
"What we're not able to assess is
'were the things you learned during
that week things that helped you
navigate your freshman year,'"
Urstein said.
Participants generally described
NSO as overwhelming, with events
catering to every possible student
interest packed into four days.
Christie Brydon 'l3, who was a
Freshman Transition Coordinator
for the Class of 2015, noted that it
may be impossible to learn every
thing from a week of orientation.
"I don't think the purpose of
NSO is to ensure that all students
show up to the first day of class be

ing experts on Stanford," Brydon
said. "It's up to students to take ad
vantage of opportunities through
out the school year to learn about
Stanford."
Currently, UAR only has rough
data lifted from focus group tran
scripts. Daisy Grewal, an assess
ment and program evaluation ana
lyst, noted a few months would be
needed to extrapolate full findings.
"The information is taken very
seriously by program directors and
others who are in charge of making
key decisions," Grewal said. "I hope
that knowing this will help per
suade more students to participate
in the future."
