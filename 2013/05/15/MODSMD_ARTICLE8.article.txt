## Two must be better than one, right? 
### Winston Shi 
Of all the harebrained
ideas in hockey, the
concept of the "worst
lead" makes the least
sense. There seems
to be a belief that leading by two
goals is actually worse than leading
by one.
The idea is that if you lead by two
and give up a goal, you're leading by
one and your goalie is rattled. Hock
ey is a very momentum-based sport,
but not wanting to have a two-goal
lead doesn't seem to make sense, and
more shockingly, some people have
actually proposed that a three-goal
lead is even worse. I challenge any
hockey player to pass on scoring
when his team is up by one so that he
can avoid leading by two. I don't think
it has ever happened. On Monday, I
watched the most entertaining game
of hockey I've seen in a while, and it
was only that morbidly compelling
because the Toronto Maple Leafs had
(correctly) first chosen to score, and
score, and score and score again.
The reason why losing a two-goal
lead is more feared than losing a one
goal lead is that you don't expect to
lose the former. No hockey player will
ease up on the accelerator with only a
one-goal lead. Up by two and some
teams begin to relax and end up
coughing it all up. Moreover, you ab
solutely expect to cough up one-goal
leads every now and then; hockey is
like that. A two-goal lead is more em
barrassing and it sticks in your mind
more deeply
Case in point: I went to high
school in Massachusetts, and while
I'm not a Bruins fan I've watched
enough games to know that the B's
have lost then' fair share of one-goal
leads. It's always the two-goal leads
(and greater) that stick in your mem
ory
One of my most enduring hockey
memories is of UMass-Lowell chok
ing away a four-goal lead to Boston
College. And who could forget the
Brains giving up a three-goal lead in
Game 7 of the conference semis
against Philadelphia? Perhaps the
most ridiculous ending I've seen oc
curred in the 2009 NCAA National
Championship Game when Miami
(OH) led Boston University by two
goals with a minute left and proceed
ed to lose in overtime. When people
ask me about the mystique of the ice,
I will point to these games and tell
them: "This is hockey"
Which brings us to last Monday
night.
The Toronto Maple Leafs are
quite possibly the most hated team in
hockey (combining the riches and ha
tred of the Yankees and the failure of
the Mets). I would have compared
them to the Boston Red Sox, but peo
ple didn't really start hating the Sox
until they started winning; the Leafs
could lose every game for the next
three years and people would still
hate them. This year, they snapped a
seven-year postseason drought in
a league where more than half the
teams make the playoffs every year,
that's just plain embarrassing and
people didn't pity them at all. The
hate persisted.
They had rallied back from a 1-3
deficit in them series against the Bru
ins and forced a Game 7. Some stellar
play had given them a 4-1 lead, but
Nathan Horton scored midway
through the third period to make it 4-
2. At that point, the Leafs needed to
hold the line for 10 minutes and 42
seconds in order to make it to the
next round. Needless to say the lead
lasted for nine minutes and 51 sec
onds.
After Bergeron tied the game
with less than a minute remaining, it
was almost destined that the Leafs
would lose the game in overtime, just
as Miami did four years ago.
Regarding the actual loss, some
truly horrendous defense and an in
ability to corral puck rebounds was to
blame. But I'm sure that when the
dust clears, when Toronto fans stop
crying and everybody else stops
laughing, people will start talking
about the two-goal lead being the
worst in hockey again.
Maybe at this point I should stop
complaining about the pundits. This
was a rather impressive meltdown on
Toronto's part, and I'm sure that
Boston chipping away at its lead had
something to do with it. The Leafs
haven't made the playoffs in a while,
as I noted. Maybe a lot of the Toron
to players simply lacked the sort of
experience that trains players to hold
leads. That will come with time.
Toronto has a good team and all the
money in the world to throw at its re
maining problems.
But it certainly seemed to me at
least that the Leafs' anti-legend has
