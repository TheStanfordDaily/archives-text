## ELLEN TSAY 
### GEORGE CHEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Sophomore Ellen Tsay, a highly recruited ten
nis player coming out of high school, currently
plays with senior Stacey Tan on the Cardinal's
No. 2 doubles team and also holds the team's No.
5 spot in singles play. As the women's tennis team
prepares to square off against USC in the NCAA
Tournament Round of 16 on Friday, Tsay sat
down with The Stanford Daily to discuss the net
work of college tennis players across the country,
how she and Tan came to play doubles together
and the upcoming showdown against the Trojans.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Let's start from
the beginning. How did you start playing ten
nis? What made you want to play tennis com
petitively?
Ellen Tsay (ET): Well, my dad got me started at
the age of three, so it's basically been with me
my entire life. I started playing tournaments
when I was seven, and it just went from there
because I guess I did kind of well. So then my
parents put me in some more tournaments, and
I liked playing tennis a lot. Around the age of 12,
I started playing more national tournaments, so
it's kind of stuck with me ever since then.
TSD: Coming out of high school, how difficult
was it to adjust to the team aspect in college?

ET: I didn't actually play for my high school be
cause I was traveling a lot, but I did play on sev
eral teams in the past. But it's just really differ
ent because at Stanford, the girls on our team
are amazing competitors. We've shared a lot of
the same experiences because we played in the
Juniors and in the national tournaments togeth
er. So it's pretty cool because instead of playing
and competing against them, I get to work and
practice with them [now]. It's definitely great to
hit with such high level players every day. For
me, it didn't take too long to get used to because
at the bottom line, [tennis] is still an individual
sport and you have to focus on your own match.
You can't rely on other people to pick up slack
for you. It's great if they can, but you need to do
your part and take pride in your own court.
TSD: Who were some of the players on the
team that you used to compete with before
coming to Stanford?
ET: I basically knew everyone on the team be
fore I came to Stanford. In the tennis communi
ty, everyone knows each other. Natalie Dillon
and I go way back because we're both from Nor-
Cal, so I remember playing against here when I
was ten years old. She's a senior now, and I nev
er thought I'd be on the same team with her.
TSD: Does this apply to outside of the Stan
ford community, too? Do you go up against a

lot of players on other college teams who you
previously played against?
ET: Yeah, there are a lot of people who I played
against in the Juniors and are still around.
There seems to be this notion that the best play
ers [immediately] go pro and college is kind of
the fallback. But actually in college, a lot of play
ers start improving a lot. So players who you
used to beat all the time in Juniors could get re
ally good because maybe they thrive in the col
lege environment. It's pretty cool to see how dif
ferent people develop in college.
TSD: How do you tackle both tennis and the
academic workload, especially as a premed?
How taxing is it?
ET: There are definitely a lot of events or things
that I wish I could attend or do, so I'm limited in
that sense. I'm also a little limited in how much
I can explore my academic or extracurricular in
terests. I chose the two things that I envision
myself doing in the future: tennis and the med
ical field. But in the Juniors, I got a lot of prac
tice [balancing] that. I remember in seventh
grade, I basically missed school every other
week, so I had to make up stuff, like labs in the
morning. So in a sense, that was good prepara
tion. It's actually not too bad in college because

Stanford sophomore Ellen Tsay (above) lived up to expectations in her freshman year on the Farm, with a 24-8 record, and improved further
in her second season, owning a 30-8 record so far. Tsay and the No. 12 women's tennis team face USC in the NCAA Tournament on Friday.
you're playing for your school, so
your professors are more under
standing.
TSD: What are some of your
strengths on the court?
ET: My strengths are my serve
when it's on and my overheads,
which are very reliable. I probably
come into net more than most
players, so that has helped me a lot
in the doubles and poaching in
doubles and taking advantage of
when Stacey hits a heavy shot. One
thing I continue to work on is stay
ing very solid throughout every
match because there's times when
I'm up and times when I'm down,
so I need to try to even that out.
TSD: You went 24-8 overall in
singles last season. Considering
that it was your freshman cam
paign, how pleased were you
with your performance?
ET: I guess I don't really look at
numbers too much. I felt pretty
good throughout the year. I've def
initely tried to play a lot more ag
gressively in college because
everyone hits very aggressively,
so if you want to compete, that's
what you have to do.

TSD: You and Stacey Tan have
been playing doubles since last

year. How did that come about?
ET: It wasn't pre-planned or any
thing. The coaches just tried us out
together and we won the first tour
nament we played in and so from
there, they're just like, "Okay, we'll
keep you two together." It's really
fun playing with Stacey. I'm really
sad that she's going to be leaving af
ter this year. We've gotten to know
each other really well, both as peo
ple and players. I'm looking forward
to this week of doubles with her.
TSD: Describe your relationship
with Tan off the court.
ET: Stacey is an amazing person.
She's very even-keeled. When she
wants something, she'll get it done
in a snap. But most of the time,
she's very laid back and a great
person to talk to. I feel like we have
such a great relationship that when
we're playing doubles, if we're los
ing or getting frustrated, all it takes
is something like eye contact or
some laughter to get back on track.
TSD: You guys swept both Mia
mi (OH) and Rice to advance to
the Round of 16 of the NCAA
Tournament. What's the plan
against USC?
ET: We all know the girls on the
USC team. We all know what
they're like, we've played them
multiple times. If we execute what
we need to, we'll pull through.
