# Card heads to Nebraska for NCAA Regionals
## 
### DAVID COHN STAFF WRITER 
After a 56-game marathon over the last three
months, Softball's postseason begins today for
No. 13 Stanford (37-19, 13-11 Pac-12) in the re
gional round of the NCAA Tournament.
In the regular season, Stanford featured a

fairly young squad consisting of six under
classmen starters that was picked to finish
sixth in the pre-season Pac-12 poll. Stanford fin
ished in fourth place in the final conference
standings, three games clear of rivals Cal and
UCLA.
In addition, the Card secured its first winning
record in conference play since 2009, a notewor
thy accomplishment given that six Pac-12 teams
were ranked in the top 20 of the USA Today/NF
CA Coaches poll and eight out of the nine Pac-12
squads earned postseason berths.
However, for all of its success in Pac-12 play,
Stanford also had some significant setbacks in
non-conference play. In particular, losses early in
the season to non-NCAA-Tournament teams
lowa and Oklahoma State hurt the Cardinal's re
sume. Ultimately, the Card's hopes of hosting a
NCAA regional were dashed by a string of three
straight non-conference losses to Saint Mary's,
Pacific and UC-Davis, all of which are ranked 70
or lower in the NCAA Women's Softball RPI.
As a result, the Cardinal will begin the NCAA
Tournament in Lincoln, Neb., competing in a
double-elimination regional against No. 14 Uni
versity of Nebraska (40-13,16-6 Big Ten), No. 24
University of Tulsa (42-14-1, 19-5 C-USA) and
the University of Northern lowa (26-24, 13-8
MVC).
At first glance, runs may be at a premium in
this regional, as all four teams feature accom
plished pitchers in their rotations. Of Stanford's
opponents, Nebraska has the best 1-2 combina
tion in junior Tatum Edwards and freshman
Emily Lockman.
Edwards and Lockman, both products of
Southern California and members of the same
travel ball club in high school, anchor a Corn
huskers pitching staff that led the Big Ten in
ERA (1.79) and opponent batting average (.205).
Edwards was this season's Big Ten Pitcher of
the Year, posting 25 complete games and nine
shutouts. However, Edwards' aggressive style
has caused her to periodically struggle with com
mand issues the Murrieta, Calif, native hit 33
batters, while walking 114 during the regular
season.
Lockman, the capable freshman who was
named California's 2012 Gatorade Player of the
Year and a first team All-American as a senior in
high school, has solidified her position as the No.
2 starter behind Edwards with an impressive
first campaign in Lincoln.
In 24 starts, Lockman has posted a 14-5
record while allowing only 44 total runs in 142 in
nings. Her best win of the season came against
the No. 1 overall seed and consensus national
championship favorite Oklahoma Sooners on
March 2. In the 1-0 win, Lockman stymied the
potent Sooner lineup, scattering seven hits in the
complete game victory.
Tulsa also boasts a star pitcher in junior

GAME NOTES: No. 13 Stanford qualified for the NCM
Tournament for the 16th straight year and will face No.

lowa. The winner of the double-elimination tournament
will advance to the Women's College World Series.

Freshman pitcher Kelsey Stevens (above) and No. 13 Stanford head to Nebraska for the 2013
Lincoln Regional. The Cardinal will play No. 24 Tulsa in the first round of the double-elimination
bracket with No. 14 Nebraska and Northern lowa meeting on the other side.
Aimee Creger. Creger, a 2011 NF
CA Third Team All-American selec
tion as a freshman, has an outstand
ing 1.04 ERA in 29 starts this sea
son. Like Lockman, Creger has al
so fared well in the spotlight
against elite competition. In a 1-0,
eight-inning loss to No. 4 national
seed Texas on Feb. 24, the Yukon,
Okla., product did not allow an
earned run while yielding only five

hits in the 128-pitch, complete
game effort.
At the plate, Stanford is clearly
the most talented offensive team,
posting the highest team batting
average (.302) and scoring the most
runs (316) against the strongest
conference schedule of the four
teams at the Lincoln Regional.
Nebraska owned an above aver
age hitting team in the Big Ten this
season, batting .291 while driving in
nearly five runs per game.
In turn, Tulsa had the best bat
ting average in Conference USA
(.298) while also driving in the most
runs in the nine-team league. All

four teams feature balanced line
ups, rather than relying upon any
one individual player.
Stanford begins play in the Lin
coln Regional against Tulsa this af
ternoon at 2:00 p.m. PST at Bowlin
Stadium. The Cardinal will continue
playing this weekend until it ac
crues two losses or wins the region
al. For box scores, game times and
