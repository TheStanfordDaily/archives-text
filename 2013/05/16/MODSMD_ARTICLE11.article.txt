## Why, Oh Y Combinator? 
### Uttara Sivaram 
I'll be honest; I really like The
New York Times. It does get a
bad rap for being liberal, and
I'll admit, I often end up temporar
ily switching to The Wall Street
Journal every time I make the deci
sion to read a Maureen Dowd col
umn but on the whole, it's high
caliber.
However, Nathaniel Rich re
cently contributed a feature about
"Y Combinator" essentially Sili
con Valley's larger model of Stan
ford StartX. And I have to say, it
was one of the most smug, self-sat
isfied exposes I've read, even as a
Bay Area hermit who could locate
the nearest solar start-up more
quickly than an In-n-Out.
Rich begins his article by intro
ducing a couple of entrepreneurs
who each made significant gambles
by giving up their livelihoods in or
der to pursue their start-up ideas in
Mountain View, assisted by the Y
Combinator, which Rich describes
as a "sleep-away camp for start
ups." The humility of these first few
paragraphs is, alas, abandoned
when Rich turns his attention to the
investors and members of YC, who
exchange the "m"s in "millions" for
"b"s so casually that it was hard not
to raise an eyebrow or two.
Rich proceeds in this vein by
fondly introducing the founder and
director of YC, Paul Graham. This
is a man who analyzed investors'
rate of refusal (failing to give start
ups any initial funding), and un
apologetically concluded that these
Palo Alto/Mountain view dwelling
investors were largely biased
against any investors who had a
foreign accent or were above age
32. As for his own biases, Graham
reportedly admitted (somewhat hu
morously), "I can be tricked by
anyone who looks like Mark
Zuckerberg. There was a guy once
who we funded who was terrible. I
said: 'How could he be bad? He
looks like Zuckerberg!"'
I was pretty put off and sur
prised at this blatant, uncensored
and unapologetic display of dis
crimination. But Rich? He fondly
described Graham as "an infec
tiously giddy and hyperarticulate
programmer, investing magnate
and essayist." The end of the article
is even more unsettlingly sweet; in
deed, Rich all but writes a soliloquy
about the YP founder's sudden and
inspirational interest in hang-glid
ing. It was one of the most irrele
vant conclusions to an even more ir
relevant article.
I understand that much of the
distaste that this article evokes is
due to the detached, even cold, atti
tudes that the ultra-wealthy in Sili
con Valley seem to have about fork
ing over millions of dollars like
bushels of hay to someone who in
vented what I like to call "Divorce-
In-A-Box" (the real name might be
worse "Wevorce"; it's like
they're just asking for it). But when
Rich chooses to include an infuriat
ingly brief conversation that goes
along the lines of "$360 million
makes me lose interest..." "It
should have a 'B' in front of it... "
without at least mentioning how lu
dicrous that sounds in today's econ
omy, I question his fidelity to jour
nalistic significance. Leave it to
Reddit to post the strange and un
expected. I'd like my news, howev
er, to be a little more nuanced.
Now, this wouldn't bother me as
much if the New Yorker would stop
gleefully drawing parallels between

Stanford and Silicon Valley; I'm
guessing mostly because it's fun
and exciting to have a word like
"Clinkle" in a serious article. You
must understand my chagrin: first,
the New Yorker finds every possi
ble way to refer to Stanford as any
thing but a university. I vividly re
member the phrases, "giant tech
incubator with a football team" and
my favorite, "Star Fond."
Juvenile writing aside, I could
n't help but think about the point
that the article had made, however
poorly: that Stanford was begin
ning to resemble less of an academ
ic institution and more of a start-up
accelerator. Indeed, after counting
the number of times I saw "Drop
box" tees while biking to class, my
gut told me that the article may
have a point at least worth consid
ering.
I'm proud of Stanford's entre
preneurial spirit don't get me
wrong. After I took CSIO6A, I felt
ready to enter the domain of mobile
apps and social networking. But
then I realized I had no idea where
Karel had gone, so I settled down
to become a columnist instead. And
as all columnists who hope for a
second of fame on someone's Face
book or Twitter, I love controversial
articles even the poorly written
ones because they spark some
valuable discussion. And even
though I took personal offense at
the New Yorker's portrayal of my
university, its overarching message
stuck in my head. So when Rich's
article came along, I was still mus
ing about whether the entrepre
neurial presence at Stanford was
helping or hurting students.
Regardless of whether Rich had
a last-minute deadline and couldn't
afford to further expand on the YC,
he paints a particularly disturbing
image of today's seemingly-pro
gressive-but-tacitly-discriminatory
Silicon Valley. Indeed, Rich reports
that there is now a higher per-capi
ta concentration of ultra-high net
work individuals in the Bay Area
than anywhere in the country. I'd
like to be dazzled by this kind of
statistic, but, upon further intro
spection, it really just seems like
there's a immensely dense concen
tration of wealthy people around
the Bay who have great fun simply
rearranging their wealth within a
50-mile radius. It reminds me of
that famous Grey Poupon ad where
two men eating lunch (or perhaps it
was brunch) in their respective
Rolls Royces exchange a single bot
tle of Dijon mustard over and over
again for four minutes.
I don't want Stanford students
simply "passing the Grey Poupon."
I want the reach of these brilliant
Stanford entrepreneurs to extend
much further than the 94305
heck, maybe out of the Bay Area
completely. I never want students
to acquire the kind of complacency
and lack of animation associated
with great ideas and even greater
amounts of money. Most of all, I
want our incredible diversity to de
fine Stanford, not individual resem
blances to Mark Zuckerberg.
Thankfully, these are wishes
that I think we all share as bright
and ambitious students. And with
that, the New Yorker and NYTimes
can write whatever they want. Star
Fond is here to stay.

wrong. After I took CSIO6A, I felt
ready to enter the domain of mobile
apps and social networking. But
then I realized I had no idea where
Karel had gone, so I settled down
to become a columnist instead. And
as all columnists who hope for a
second of fame on someone's Face
book or Twitter, I love controversial
articles even the poorly written
ones because they spark some
valuable discussion. And even
though I took personal offense at
the New Yorker's portrayal of my
university, its overarching message
stuck in my head. So when Rich's
article came along, I was still mus
ing about whether the entrepre
neurial presence at Stanford was
helping or hurting students.
Regardless of whether Rich had
a last-minute deadline and couldn't
afford to further expand on the YC,
he paints a particularly disturbing
image of today's seemingly-pro
gressive-but-tacitly-discriminatory
Silicon Valley. Indeed, Rich reports
that there is now a higher per-capi
ta concentration of ultra-high net
work individuals in the Bay Area
than anywhere in the country. I'd
like to be dazzled by this kind of
statistic, but, upon further intro
spection, it really just seems like
there's a immensely dense concen
tration of wealthy people around
the Bay who have great fun simply
rearranging their wealth within a
50-mile radius. It reminds me of
that famous Grey Poupon ad where
two men eating lunch (or perhaps it
was brunch) in their respective
Rolls Royces exchange a single bot
tle of Dijon mustard over and over
again for four minutes.
I don't want Stanford students
simply "passing the Grey Poupon."
I want the reach of these brilliant
Stanford entrepreneurs to extend
much further than the 94305
heck, maybe out of the Bay Area
completely. I never want students
to acquire the kind of complacency
and lack of animation associated
with great ideas and even greater
amounts of money. Most of all, I
want our incredible diversity to de
fine Stanford, not individual resem
blances to Mark Zuckerberg.
Thankfully, these are wishes
that I think we all share as bright
and ambitious students. And with
that, the New Yorker and NYTimes
can write whatever they want. Star
Fond is here to stay.

I'll be honest; I really like The
New York Times. It does get a
bad rap for being liberal, and
I'll admit, I often end up temporar
ily switching to The Wall Street
Journal every time I make the deci
sion to read a Maureen Dowd col
umn but on the whole, it's high
caliber.
However, Nathaniel Rich re
cently contributed a feature about
"Y Combinator" essentially Sili
con Valley's larger model of Stan
ford StartX. And I have to say, it
was one of the most smug, self-sat
isfied exposes I've read, even as a
Bay Area hermit who could locate
the nearest solar start-up more
quickly than an In-n-Out.
Rich begins his article by intro
ducing a couple of entrepreneurs
who each made significant gambles
by giving up their livelihoods in or
der to pursue their start-up ideas in
Mountain View, assisted by the Y
Combinator, which Rich describes
as a "sleep-away camp for start
ups." The humility of these first few
paragraphs is, alas, abandoned
when Rich turns his attention to the
investors and members of YC, who
exchange the "m"s in "millions" for
"b"s so casually that it was hard not
to raise an eyebrow or two.
Rich proceeds in this vein by
fondly introducing the founder and
director of YC, Paul Graham. This
is a man who analyzed investors'
rate of refusal (failing to give start
ups any initial funding), and un
apologetically concluded that these
Palo Alto/Mountain view dwelling
investors were largely biased
against any investors who had a
foreign accent or were above age
32. As for his own biases, Graham
reportedly admitted (somewhat hu
morously), "I can be tricked by
anyone who looks like Mark
Zuckerberg. There was a guy once
who we funded who was terrible. I
said: 'How could he be bad? He
looks like Zuckerberg!"'
I was pretty put off and sur
prised at this blatant, uncensored
and unapologetic display of dis
crimination. But Rich? He fondly
described Graham as "an infec
tiously giddy and hyperarticulate
programmer, investing magnate
and essayist." The end of the article
is even more unsettlingly sweet; in
deed, Rich all but writes a soliloquy
about the YP founder's sudden and
inspirational interest in hang-glid
ing. It was one of the most irrele
vant conclusions to an even more ir
relevant article.
I understand that much of the
distaste that this article evokes is
due to the detached, even cold, atti
tudes that the ultra-wealthy in Sili
con Valley seem to have about fork
ing over millions of dollars like
bushels of hay to someone who in
vented what I like to call "Divorce-
In-A-Box" (the real name might be
worse "Wevorce"; it's like
they're just asking for it). But when
Rich chooses to include an infuriat
ingly brief conversation that goes
along the lines of "$360 million
makes me lose interest..." "It
should have a 'B' in front of it... "
without at least mentioning how lu
dicrous that sounds in today's econ
omy, I question his fidelity to jour
nalistic significance. Leave it to
Reddit to post the strange and un
expected. I'd like my news, howev
er, to be a little more nuanced.
Now, this wouldn't bother me as
much if the New Yorker would stop
gleefully drawing parallels between

Stanford and Silicon Valley; I'm
guessing mostly because it's fun
and exciting to have a word like
"Clinkle" in a serious article. You
must understand my chagrin: first,
the New Yorker finds every possi
ble way to refer to Stanford as any
thing but a university. I vividly re
member the phrases, "giant tech
incubator with a football team" and
my favorite, "Star Fond."
Juvenile writing aside, I could
n't help but think about the point
that the article had made, however
poorly: that Stanford was begin
ning to resemble less of an academ
ic institution and more of a start-up
accelerator. Indeed, after counting
the number of times I saw "Drop
box" tees while biking to class, my
gut told me that the article may
have a point at least worth consid
ering.
