# THE
						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## On Racism, Part 2 
### Adam Johnson 
In February I wrote "Everyone
can be racist," a column that
took aim at the somewhat-popu
lar saying in today's activist commu
nities that "only white people can be
racist." I granted the definition of
racism as equating to power plus
privilege, but given this starting
point I argued that people of color
are also capable of being racist.
My piece generated a fair
amount of criticism on campus, and
while much of the negative criticism
was unhelpful in challenging my
perspective a handful of com
ments on The Daily website went no
further then noting that my piece
was "problematic" others en
gaged with my piece through com
ments or email; my colleague Krist
ian Davis Bailey 'l4 even wrote a
column in response in which he en
couraged me to continue the dia
logue. Today's column is my at
tempt to do so.
I will staid by saying I stand by
my original assertion that all
groups can be racist under the defi
nition of racism as prejudice plus
power. In his column, Kristian
agreed with that claim, conceding
that "yes, the phrase 'only white

people can be racist' is false. People
of color can be racist against them
selves, members of their own race,
or against others." Examples
abound. Take Malaysia, for instance,
whose Constitution entrusts power
to the King to "safeguard the special
position of the Malays" over other
Malaysian citizens, notably those of
Chinese and Indian origin.
In America, too, there are inter
minority relations that can qualify as
racist. One commenter on my origi
nal piece likened race relations in
America to that of a hierarchy. I am
of the opinion that a group's position
in this hierarchy is largely depend
ent on context; perhaps whites are
inevitably on top, but I'm not con
vinced that any one racial group is
always at the "bottom." In Chicago,
for example, African-Americans
hold a significant amount of political
leverage compared to Hispanics,
whereas in a city like Miami the op
posite is the case. And there are oth
er forms of power religious and
economic, notably that must be
included in the equation. So even if
race relations can be broken down
into a hierarchy, I still believe that all
groups can be racist, albeit perhaps
at different moments and in differ
ent ways. If Kristian agrees with me
here, as his quote above would seem
to indicate, perhaps he should have
found a better title for his piece than
"Everyone cannot be racist."
That aside, I think Kristian's
most thought-provoking point is his
argument that "systems and insti
tutions are not, and cannot be,
racist against white people in the
United States." My original piece
never provided an answer to this
question; my argument was that
everyone can be racist, not that
everyone can be victims of racism.
Here, then, I think there is a discus
sion to be had. Perhaps one coun
terexample to Kristian's claim is K
-12 education. It stands to reason
that Asians, often labeled as the
"model race," are advantaged in the
education system compared to
white students if only as a result of
what one UC Berkeley sociologist
labels as "stereotype promise," or
the "promise of being viewed
through the lens of a positive
stereotype that leads one to per
form in such away that confirms
the positive stereotype." This
"stereotype promise" is likely per
petuated by white teachers, but as
Kristian and others note, it is not
uncommon for a race to be racist

against itself.
I think there are two more
points worth mentioning. First,
Kristian claimed that I conflated
racism on an individual versus
structural level. If I did confuse the
two, though, that likely stems from
the fact that those to whom I was
originally responding the people
who argued that "only whites can
be racist" all-too-often failed to
distinguish individuals operating in
a system versus the system itself; in
other words, critiques were not iso
lated to institutions and their ori
gins but instead included denigra
tions of white individuals. I have no
control over my skin color, yet peo
ple who look like me are blamed for
creating institutions they did not
construct, blamed for not recogniz
ing privilege that they are supposed
to be oblivious to, blamed for being
especially prejudiced when mem
bers of all races possess bigoted
thoughts, and blamed for conse
quences that arise as a simple result
of America being a majority white
(non-Hispanic) country.
While these highly critical atti
tudes in all likelihood stem from
righteous indignation, they are not
altogether productive. First, they
are not necessary; if the injustice is
salient enough, there should be lit
tle need to cast blame on individual
people. Second, as I mentioned in
my previous piece, these attitudes
are divisive and disempowering for
minorities. And third, solely direct
ing contempt and notions of culpa
bility at whites assumes that racism
is an issue where whites are fully
autonomous actors who are also the
sole beneficiaries of racism, both of
which are inaccurate assumptions.
More productive and more accu
rate, in my opinion, would be to ap
proach race from the perspective
that a tendency towards racism is a
universal feature of the human con
dition, engrained through thou
sands of years of evolutionary pres
sure wherein we have been advan
taged by favoring those who look
like us, and cemented in institutions
still in operation today. The answer,
then, is not to target any one group
or members within that group
but to be critical of institutions that
privilege one group over others and
widespread prejudices that serve to
further, not ameliorate, racial ten
sions.
