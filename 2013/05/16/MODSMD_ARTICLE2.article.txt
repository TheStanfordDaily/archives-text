## Hume, OCP merge, move to the Quad Transition aims to increase access to underutilized OCP 
### BAKER TILNEY 
Beginning next year, the Hume
Writing Center (HWC) and the Oral
Communication Program (OCP) will
have new names, a new home and a
new format.
The OCP will be merged into the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR). The OCP's Speaking Center,
meanwhile, will be combined with
the HWC to create the Hume Cen
ter for Writing and Speaking, locat
ed in Building 250 across Lasuen
Mall from the Bing entrance of
Green Library in the Main Quad.
Julia Bleakney, director of the
HWC, emphasized the importance
of the change in location for the
newly combined center, noting that
the 2012 Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES) re
port supported the writing center
but recommended it move from its
current location in the basement of
Margaret Jacks Hall.
"We believe that students are re
ally going to benefit from [the move
to Building 250] because they some
times have a hard time finding our
current location," Bleakney said.
"[Building 250 is] definitely an im
provement for the physical space for
our center."
Oral Communication Program
Director Doree Allen M.A. 'B2 M.A.
'92 Ph.D. '92 explained that the
planned demolition of Meyer Li
brary means that the OCT] current
ly situated in Suite 123 of Meyer,
will also benefit greatly from a move
to the Quad.
"Since Meyer [is] going to be
torn down, [this is] a perfect oppor
tunity to bring these two very syn
ergistic things together so we can
create a communication hub where
people can look at all aspects of
writing and public speaking and dig
ital media," Allen said.
Beyond the physical improve
ments, Bleakney and Allen ex
pressed an expectation of opera
tional enhancements. While the
speaking and writing programs
have collaborated in the past, in
cluding through the OCP's involve
ment with PWR 2 requirements,
they noted that the combination of
the programs would tie speaking
and writing more closely together.
"People coming to get writing tu
toring will see the speaking pro
gram and vice versa," Allen said.
"Even now, every now and then I'll
find a senior who says, 'I never
knew about this speaking program
and if I'd known I'd have been here
before.'"
Student tutors like Andrew Gay
'l3, an oral communication tutor
with the OCR agreed that the
speaking program will gain access
to a broader group of students fol
lowing the changes.
"The added visibility to the pro
gram will be huge, as, currently, the
Oral Communication Program is a
very underutilized resource that ef
fectively serves as a private re
source of the PWR 2 program," Gay
noted.
The directors hope to do more
outreach across disciplines as well
as holding combined workshops.
