# New hospital targets early completion
## 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Two weeks after University and community
leaders broke ground on the new Stanford
Hospital, the man in charge of the project's
construction says that the effort is "going A
okay."
Four-plus more years of building are pro
jected for Stanford Hospital, but Clinics' Vice
President of Construction Bert Hurlbut noted
that while the hospital is expected to begin

serving patients in late 2017 or early 2018 he
and the construction team are going to "push
hard to get it done early."
The new Stanford Hospital facility, part of
the $5-billion Stanford University Medical
Center Renewal Project, will add 824,000
square feet and 368 patient beds to the current
hospital, which was built in 1959. The existing
hospital will be connected to the new building
by both a bridge and a tunnel.
The hospital construction is one of several
initiatives currently in progress under the um

brella of the Renewal Project, which "will re
build and modernize the facilities that are the
foundation of our community's healthcare serv
ices," according to the project's website.
The expansion of the Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital, renovations of Hoover Pavilion
and the construction of new buildings for the
School of Medicine are also included in the
project.

On May 1, the University broke ground on the new Stanford Hospital, which is expected to be completed by early 2018. The new facility, part
of the $5-billion Stanford University Medical Center Renewal Project, will add 824,000 square feet to the original facility, built in 1959.
new hospital's construction
is that the current facility
does not meet seismic stan
dards for in-patient care.
The new structure will be
built on base isolators, large
underground devices that
will allow the facility to
move up to six feet to pre
vent damage during a major
earthquake.
"[lt's] seismically safe
because these base isolators
can move so much," Hurlbut
said. "It precludes a lot of
the energy from getting into
the building and destroying
things."
According to Lloyd Mi
nor, dean of the School of
Medicine, technologies in the
new hospital will also allow
the facility to continue pro
viding care even if a major
earthquake occurs.
Hurlbut said that the
demolition of the previous
structure at 1101 Welch
Road, where the new hospi
tal will be located, has al
ready been completed. The
construction team is current
ly focused on a massive exca
vation that will take about
200,000 cubic yards of soil
out of the ground.
According to Hurlbut, the
current schedule states that
the team is supposed to start
setting structural steel in
late-summer 2014. He
added, however, that he will
work to expedite that
process by up to two months.
"It's tough to look at the
schedule each day and de
termine if you are on-sched
ule or behind or ahead,"
Hurlbut said, explaining
that his team instead focus
es on milestones like the
structural steel date. "[The
master schedule] that we
have established right now
says we do a lot of things be
tween now and the end of
construction, but we do
them on time."
External construction is
scheduled to be completed
in 2016, and the interior is
expected to be finished by
2017 in time for the hospital
to open for patients. Hurl
but said that he believes the
scope of the structure will
surprise many people.

"The existing hospital
which is three stories [high]
is going to come partway
up the [new] building and
then all the patient rooms
will be above that," Hurlbut
said. "It's going to be a big
building everybody's go
ing to see this hospital from
miles away."
Minor said that the new
facility will be built "from
the patient's point of view,"
referencing the layout of pa
tient rooms, the inclusion of
a garden in the center of the
facility and the decision to
put all procedure spaces on
one level.
"It's really designed to
create a patient experience
that promotes healing, pro
motes wellness and pro
motes communication," Mi
nor said.
According to Minor, this
focus on patients will allow
both the hospital and the
medical school to continue
providing top-quality serv
ice, with a mission of bring
ing "the very best of science
[and] technology to the ben
efit of all of our patients."
"This hospital will give
us the world-class facility to
match our world-class facul
ty and world-class students,
residents, fellows and other
people associated with the
delivery of outstanding pa
tient care," Minor said.

move up to six feet to pre
vent damage during a major
earthquake.
"[lt's] seismically safe
because these base isolators
can move so much," Hurlbut
said. "It precludes a lot of
the energy from getting into
the building and destroying
things."
According to Lloyd Mi
nor, dean of the School of
Medicine, technologies in the
new hospital will also allow
the facility to continue pro
viding care even if a major
earthquake occurs.
Hurlbut said that the
demolition of the previous
structure at 1101 Welch
Road, where the new hospi
tal will be located, has al
ready been completed. The
construction team is current
ly focused on a massive exca
vation that will take about
200,000 cubic yards of soil
out of the ground.
According to Hurlbut, the
current schedule states that
the team is supposed to start
setting structural steel in
late-summer 2014. He
added, however, that he will
work to expedite that
process by up to two months.
"It's tough to look at the
schedule each day and de
termine if you are on-sched
ule or behind or ahead,"
Hurlbut said, explaining
that his team instead focus
es on milestones like the
structural steel date. "[The
master schedule] that we
have established right now
says we do a lot of things be
tween now and the end of
construction, but we do
them on time."
External construction is
scheduled to be completed
in 2016, and the interior is
expected to be finished by
2017 in time for the hospital
to open for patients. Hurl
but said that he believes the
scope of the structure will
surprise many people.

"The existing hospital
which is three stories [high]
is going to come partway
up the [new] building and
then all the patient rooms
will be above that," Hurlbut
said. "It's going to be a big
building everybody's go
ing to see this hospital from
miles away."
Minor said that the new
facility will be built "from
the patient's point of view,"
referencing the layout of pa
tient rooms, the inclusion of
a garden in the center of the
facility and the decision to
put all procedure spaces on
one level.
"It's really designed to
create a patient experience
that promotes healing, pro
motes wellness and pro
motes communication," Mi
nor said.
According to Minor, this
focus on patients will allow
both the hospital and the
medical school to continue
providing top-quality serv
ice, with a mission of bring
ing "the very best of science
[and] technology to the ben
efit of all of our patients."
"This hospital will give
us the world-class facility to
match our world-class facul
ty and world-class students,
residents, fellows and other
people associated with the
delivery of outstanding pa
tient care," Minor said.
