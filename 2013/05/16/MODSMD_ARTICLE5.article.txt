## Mobile gift-giving startup markets to parents 
### SOO JI LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yiftee, a micro-gift startup founded in
2011, has partnered with multiple campus
businesses to allow members of the Stanford
community to send and receive items, such
as a cup of coffee or a cupcake, from local
merchants through their smartphones or on
line.
The company, which was co-founded by
Aldo Briano M.S. 'l2, Management Science
and Engineering Lecturer Donna Novitsky

'Bl, Jon Kepecs and Lori Laub, has part
nered with merchants in all 50 states and
Puerto Rico. Merchants can sign up to fea
ture them business and gifts for free on Yif
tee's website and on the Yiftee iPhone appli
cation.
"It's about sharing random acts of kind
ness among people and supporting local busi
nesses that are the backbone of our commu
nities," Novitsky said.
Yiftee gifts come in the form of a single
use digital MasterCard that can be spent at
the company's two million partner business

es. Users receive gifts through email, text or
Facebook and have four weeks to redeem mi
cro-gifts before they expire.
"It still brings in traffic to the store with
no discounting," Briano said. "The local busi
ness gets paid instantaneously just like if it
were another customer paying with a credit
card."
The company, which launched a beta ver
sion in December, was one of nine finalists in
the Business Association of Stanford Entre-
preneurial Students (BASES)
2012 e-Challenge and partici
pated in the BASES Forge
Accelerator program.
Yiftee has since part
nered with Coupa Cafe,
Treehouse and Ike's Place on
campus, and is currently in
talks with the Stanford
Bookstore. Most of the Palo
Alto merchants that use Yif
tee are located off-campus,
including California Pizza
Kitchen, Cold Stone Cream
ery and Sprinkles Cupcakes.
Novitsky's work with Yif
tee has also extended into
her classroom. A team of six
students in MS&E 271: Glob
al Entrepreneurial Market
ing (GEM) have spearhead-

Ed marketing efforts for a
Yiftee campus care package
at Stanford and other Cali
fornia schools such as UC-
Santa Barbara, UC-Davis
and UC-Santa Cruz.
In MS&E 271, students
work with one of over 20
project sponsors to gain real
world experience in market
ing. Yiftee has served as a
project sponsor for three
years, and this year's Yiftee
GEM team pitched to the
parents of prospective and
current Stanford students at
Parents' Weekend and Admit
Weekend.
"We're trying to collabo
rate with other care pack
ages so that we can help
moms and dads," said GEM
team member Saurabh Lad
ha M.S. 'l4. "We wouldn't call
it competition."
According to Briano, Yif
tee is targeting parents of

students instead of students
themselves, since the compa
ny's target users are women
between the age of 25 and 55.
"As a mom, I would send
my kids Yiftees at school,"
Novitsky said. "All day
you're thinking of them. You
want them to remember and
put a smile on their face."
Briano noted that, while
expanding the company's
merchant base was the initial
challenge, Yiftee is now fo
cused on growing its user
base. The company partnered
with Kappa Alpha Theta last
year for Crushgrams, the
sorority's Valentine's Day se
cret gift program.
"That was our beta
launch, literally three
months after alpha [launch]
and five months after the
first line of code was writ
ten," Novitsky said about the
partnership.

Thus far, Yiftee has raised
$850,000 in seed funding
from New York and Silicon
Valley angel investors includ
ing Scott Cook, the chairman
and founder of Intuit, and
Mohr Davidow Ventures,
where Novitsky was a part
ner for nine years.
In the future, Yiftee
hopes to provide a platform
that could be incorporated
into mobile applications, on
line greeting cards, websites
and online dating services to
allow users to send each oth
er gifts.
"The only other competi
tor would be Facebook gifts
and Facebook gifts is
nowhere [near] what we do,"
Ladha said. "Facebook would
actually mail you the gift and
it takes two weeks to arrive."
