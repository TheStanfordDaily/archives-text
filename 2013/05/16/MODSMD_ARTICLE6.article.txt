## SEAN REARDON PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION 
### FOLUKE NUNN 
Professor of Education Sean Reardon re
cently published a controversial New York
Times opinion piece titled "No Rich Child Left
Behind," in which he detailed his research on
the widening achievement gap between stu
dents from high- and low-income families.
Reardon spoke with The Daily about the feed
back he has received on the piece and his
thoughts on how the achievement gap can be
narrowed.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why did you de
cide to write an Op-Ed for The New York
Times, and what did you hope to achieve
through writing the article?
Sean Reardon (SR): They actually asked me
to. They have this ongoing series called "The
Great Divide" on various aspects of inequality
... As academics, we do research about things
we think are important and try to learn things
that we hope will be important to other people,
but often the community of people who hear
about that is a relatively small community of
other scholars interested in the same thing. So
I thought the Op-Ed would be a chance to raise
some of the issues that I'd been thinking about
for a broader public conversation.
TSD: What kinds of research have you done
in the past about the impact of income on
educational performance?
SR: I've looked at the relationship between
family income and students' academic achieve
ment measured by standardized test scores
over the last 50 years, and to some extent by ac
cess to college or access to selective colleges,
and things like that. The research shows that
the relationship between family income and ac
ademic achievement has gotten much stronger
over time and the gap between high- and low
income students in their achievement is much
bigger than it used to be.
TSD: In your opinion, why is the achieve
ment gap widening?
SR: It's partly because income inequality
has been widening and so high-income families
have more money relative to middle-class or
low-income families. But it seems to be much
more than that. It seems to be that having mon
ey, or things correlated with having more mon
ey, like high levels of parent education, two-par
ent families versus single-parent families,
where you live... matter more for academic
achievement than they used to. So it's not just
