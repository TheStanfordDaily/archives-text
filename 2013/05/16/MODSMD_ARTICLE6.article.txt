# Q&A
## SEAN REARDON PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION 
### FOLUKE NUNN 
Professor of Education Sean Reardon re
cently published a controversial New York
Times opinion piece titled "No Rich Child Left
Behind," in which he detailed his research on
the widening achievement gap between stu
dents from high- and low-income families.
Reardon spoke with The Daily about the feed
back he has received on the piece and his
thoughts on how the achievement gap can be
narrowed.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why did you de
cide to write an Op-Ed for The New York
Times, and what did you hope to achieve
through writing the article?
Sean Reardon (SR): They actually asked me
to. They have this ongoing series called "The
Great Divide" on various aspects of inequality
... As academics, we do research about things
we think are important and try to learn things
that we hope will be important to other people,
but often the community of people who hear
about that is a relatively small community of
other scholars interested in the same thing. So
I thought the Op-Ed would be a chance to raise
some of the issues that I'd been thinking about
for a broader public conversation.
TSD: What kinds of research have you done
in the past about the impact of income on
educational performance?
SR: I've looked at the relationship between
family income and students' academic achieve
ment measured by standardized test scores
over the last 50 years, and to some extent by ac
cess to college or access to selective colleges,
and things like that. The research shows that
the relationship between family income and ac
ademic achievement has gotten much stronger
over time and the gap between high- and low
income students in their achievement is much
bigger than it used to be.
TSD: In your opinion, why is the achieve
ment gap widening?
SR: It's partly because income inequality
has been widening and so high-income families
have more money relative to middle-class or
low-income families. But it seems to be much
more than that. It seems to be that having mon
ey, or things correlated with having more mon
ey, like high levels of parent education, two-par
ent families versus single-parent families,
where you live... matter more for academic
achievement than they used to. So it's not just
that rich people have more money than
they used to relative to the poor, it's that
money or things related to money mat
ter more for academic achievement than
they used to.

TSD: What could be done to give chil
dren from low-income families an
equal chance of succeeding?
SR: I think a couple things. One is
we could do more to reduce the growth
in income inequality... it's not just a
matter of helping the children of low-in
come families, it's a matter of helping
children from low- and middle-income
families get the same educational oppor
tunities that the children of high-income
families are getting. So how do we do
that? One thing we could do is invest a
lot more in early childhood, high-quality
childcare, high-quality preschool that
would be accessible and affordable to
low-income and middle-income families.
We can do more in the K-12 years, but
the widening gap isn't because of a
problem in K-12 education, the widen
ing gap seems to be there when kids get
to kindergarten.
TSD: When it comes to issues like ac
ademic achievement gaps, what do
you think is the biggest obstacle to
change?
SR: I think we live in a society that
believes very deeply that it's a meritoc
racy, that hard work and effort and tal
ent will win at the end of the day. At
some level we think that everyone has

the same opportunity, but there's lots
and lots of evidence that not everyone
has the same opportunity. Lots of peo
ple say, "Well I grew up in a poor family
and look at all that I've accomplished,"
or people point to their favorite success
story of someone who grew up in a low
income family or under disadvantaged
circumstances ... [but] there are vastly
more stories where the people who are
successful grew up in more advantaged
backgrounds, or stories where people
who grew up in disadvantaged back
grounds weren't able to achieve that.
There's certainly some social mobili
ty and upward mobility in America, but
there's also a lot of barriers and a lot of
reasons why it's hard to move up if you
come from a lower income background.
And saying that it's not true doesn't
make them go away, but until we ac
knowledge them it's harder to figure out
how to fix them.

TSD: What kinds of responses have
you received to your Op-Ed?
SR: An enormous range. I got 100
emails in response to it. There were, I
think, over 1,000 comments on The New
York Times website... I got every imag
inable range of response to it, from "this
is a big problem and we're glad you
called attention to it" to "this isn't a

problem at all, and why are you inciting
class warfare?" I think the nice thing is
that there was a conversation that hap
pened, I think a lot of people got en
gaged in talking about it as a result.
TSD: How can students who are con
cerned about these issues work to re
solve them?
SR: I would love to see students talk
ing about it and thinking about it. I
mean, there are big questions here,
there are questions about what fairness
and equality are, and there's lots of room
to disagree, lots of room to have passion
ate, reasoned conversation about how
much and what kinds of inequality a so
ciety should tolerate and what kinds so
ciety should not tolerate... if anyone's
good at figuring out how to change soci
ety it's young people, because they're
not so deeply invested in the way it is
now and are intensely passionate about
the future they have in front of them and
want it to be a future that is just and fair.
I'd love to see college students debate
and argue and engage and read and
think, but I don't know what the answer
that comes out of that is and I don't
think I should.

dents from high- and low-income families.
Reardon spoke with The Daily about the feed
back he has received on the piece and his
thoughts on how the achievement gap can be
narrowed.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why did you de
cide to write an Op-Ed for The New York
Times, and what did you hope to achieve
through writing the article?
Sean Reardon (SR): They actually asked me
to. They have this ongoing series called "The
Great Divide" on various aspects of inequality
... As academics, we do research about things
we think are important and try to learn things
that we hope will be important to other people,
but often the community of people who hear
about that is a relatively small community of
other scholars interested in the same thing. So
I thought the Op-Ed would be a chance to raise
some of the issues that I'd been thinking about
for a broader public conversation.
TSD: What kinds of research have you done
in the past about the impact of income on
educational performance?
SR: I've looked at the relationship between
family income and students' academic achieve
ment measured by standardized test scores
over the last 50 years, and to some extent by ac
cess to college or access to selective colleges,
and things like that. The research shows that
the relationship between family income and ac
ademic achievement has gotten much stronger
over time and the gap between high- and low
income students in their achievement is much
bigger than it used to be.
TSD: In your opinion, why is the achieve
ment gap widening?
SR: It's partly because income inequality
has been widening and so high-income families
have more money relative to middle-class or
low-income families. But it seems to be much
more than that. It seems to be that having mon
ey, or things correlated with having more mon
ey, like high levels of parent education, two-par
ent families versus single-parent families,
where you live... matter more for academic
achievement than they used to. So it's not just
that rich people have more money than
they used to relative to the poor, it's that
money or things related to money mat
ter more for academic achievement than
they used to.

TSD: What could be done to give chil
dren from low-income families an
equal chance of succeeding?
SR: I think a couple things. One is
we could do more to reduce the growth
in income inequality... it's not just a
matter of helping the children of low-in
come families, it's a matter of helping
children from low- and middle-income
families get the same educational oppor
tunities that the children of high-income
families are getting. So how do we do
that? One thing we could do is invest a
lot more in early childhood, high-quality
childcare, high-quality preschool that
would be accessible and affordable to
low-income and middle-income families.
We can do more in the K-12 years, but
the widening gap isn't because of a
problem in K-12 education, the widen
ing gap seems to be there when kids get
to kindergarten.
TSD: When it comes to issues like ac
ademic achievement gaps, what do
you think is the biggest obstacle to
change?
SR: I think we live in a society that
believes very deeply that it's a meritoc
racy, that hard work and effort and tal
ent will win at the end of the day. At
some level we think that everyone has

the same opportunity, but there's lots
and lots of evidence that not everyone
has the same opportunity. Lots of peo
ple say, "Well I grew up in a poor family
and look at all that I've accomplished,"
or people point to their favorite success
story of someone who grew up in a low
income family or under disadvantaged
circumstances ... [but] there are vastly
more stories where the people who are
successful grew up in more advantaged
backgrounds, or stories where people
who grew up in disadvantaged back
grounds weren't able to achieve that.
There's certainly some social mobili
ty and upward mobility in America, but
there's also a lot of barriers and a lot of
reasons why it's hard to move up if you
come from a lower income background.
And saying that it's not true doesn't
make them go away, but until we ac
knowledge them it's harder to figure out
how to fix them.

TSD: What kinds of responses have
you received to your Op-Ed?
SR: An enormous range. I got 100
emails in response to it. There were, I
think, over 1,000 comments on The New
York Times website... I got every imag
inable range of response to it, from "this
is a big problem and we're glad you
called attention to it" to "this isn't a

problem at all, and why are you inciting
class warfare?" I think the nice thing is
that there was a conversation that hap
pened, I think a lot of people got en
gaged in talking about it as a result.
TSD: How can students who are con
cerned about these issues work to re
solve them?
SR: I would love to see students talk
ing about it and thinking about it. I
mean, there are big questions here,
there are questions about what fairness
and equality are, and there's lots of room
to disagree, lots of room to have passion
ate, reasoned conversation about how
much and what kinds of inequality a so
ciety should tolerate and what kinds so
ciety should not tolerate... if anyone's
good at figuring out how to change soci
ety it's young people, because they're
not so deeply invested in the way it is
now and are intensely passionate about
the future they have in front of them and
want it to be a future that is just and fair.
I'd love to see college students debate
and argue and engage and read and
think, but I don't know what the answer
that comes out of that is and I don't
think I should.
