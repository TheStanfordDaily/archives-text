## Don't fret over the Directors' Cup streak 
### Joey Beyda 
It's hard to imagine Stanford
without Hoover Tower, NSO
fountain-hopping or the one,
the only, the truly incompara
ble Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band. But what
about Stanford without the Directors'
Cup?
That's right our annual trophy
room staffer is not a given this time
around. Although the Cardinal has
won the award 18 years in a row,
Stanford might not even be the 2013
favorite entering the final round of
spring playoffs.
For those not familiar with how
the Directors' Cup winner is chosen,
up to 20 team sports (10 men's and 10
women's) can earn a school points for
the award according to their final
postseason bracket position. All
sports even football have the
same maximum point value.
As of April 25, when official re
sults were last released, Stanford was
in second place with 902.75 points,
just slightly behind Michigan at
914.25. The Cardinal likely jumped
into first last weekend when its
women's water polo team lost the na
tional title game to USC, but it still is
n't safe because the Cardinal teams
that haven't finished their seasons yet
are unlikely to make deep postseason
runs. Men's volleyball failed to make
its tournament, lacrosse lost in the
second round (exceeding just about
everyone's expectations, I should
note) and baseball, a traditional Card
strength, is going to have to pull off a
miracle to qualify for a regional.
One school that will likely gain on
Stanford across the board is Florida,
looming at No. 4 in the last official
standings with 748.50 points. Its
women's lacrosse team is playing in
the Elite Eight on Saturday; its base
ball team should make the postseason
despite its straggles in the ultra-com
petitive SEC. The Gators are also
dominant in women's tennis (No. 1 in
the country), women's golf (No. 5)
and softball (No. 2) three sports in
which the Cardinal is an outside title
contender at best.
Several factors have put Stanford
in an unusually tenuous position this
year, among them the relatively early
exit by women's basketball in the
Sweet Sixteen as well as Final Four
losses by women's soccer and water
polo (teams that won titles in 2011-
12). Baseball is probably most to
blame.
But my goal here isn't to point fin
gers at the dedicated student-ath
letes here who, like any other sports
players, suffer disappointments
every now and then. Instead, I've
been asking myself a different ques
tion for the last couple weeks: How
upset should we be if Stanford does
n't win this year's Directors' Cup?
Even when the award was a fore
gone conclusion, the Directors' Cup
had special meaning to Cardinal fans.
We could boast that Stanford truly
had the top athletics program in the
country, and when our friends scoffed
at the idea how could an elite aca
demic institution be any good at
sports? we always pointed right at
our 18 sparkling trophies. The Direc
tors' Cup record has become almost a
catchphrase, heard and seen across
campus. The University uses it to re
cruit prospective student-athletes,
prints it on T-shirts and brags about
it on one of the banners at The Axe &
Palm.
But I can't help but think that the
rest of the college athletics world is a
little bit resentful. North Carolina
won in 1993-94, when the Tar Heels
edged Stanford by 21.5 points for the
inaugural trophy, but it's been all Car
dinal since then. Capital One even
created two alternate awards weight
ed towards big-name sports, just so
that someone other than Stanford
could win. Of course we can take
pride in our athletic department's
success, but we've also got to admit
that we've been hogging this one
award a little bit and at a school
that is too often misidentified as elit
ist, maybe that's not for the best.
I'm not suggesting that Stanford
should try to lose; I'm still going to be
pulling for the Cardinal to win a 19th
straight Directors' Cup over the next
month. But let's not bite our nails
over the prospect of someone else
winning the trophy, and let's not be
sore losers if our crystal collection
fails to grow this year.
