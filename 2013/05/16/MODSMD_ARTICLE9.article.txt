# ROAD TO ATLANTA
## 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Facing its first score-low-or-go-home test of
the season, the No. 10 Stanford men's golf team
begins play at the NCAA Columbus Regional
today looking to advance to the National Cham
pionship Tournament for the second straight
year.
The field, which Cardinal head coach Con
rad Ray characterized as "very competitive," in
cludes No. 5 New Mexico, No. 19 Auburn, No. 22
South Carolina, UNIAf Missouri, Texas Tech and
Chattanooga. In addition, the event features
eight of the country's top-50 individuals. The top
five teams plus the lowest-scoring individual not
on those teams will advance to the NCAA Cham
pionships May 28 through June 2 in Atlanta, Ga.
The Cardinal will be looking to get off the
ground quickly and start better than it did at the

Pac-12 Championships a few weeks ago, when
the team found itself in sixth place after 18 holes.
Course familiarity won't be a huge issue for
the Cardinal, as the team's top three players
senior Andrew Yun, junior Cameron Wilson and
sophomore Patrick Rodgers have all played
on the Ohio State Scarlet Course where the re
gional is hosted.
"The keys to playing well on that course are
good driving and lag putting," said Yun, who not
ed that he played the course as junior in high
school as well as the past two years for a Nation
wide Tour event.
"If you can find the fairways, you can be real
ly aggressive to any pin location on the greens,"
Yun continued. "That said, the greens are very
large and undulating. If you miss an iron shot,
you will most likely find the green but have a
lengthy putt. If you can lag your putts well, then
you can minimize your mistakes."

Ray concurred, adding that he had talked to
the Ohio State women's golf coach at the
women's NCAA West Regional about the condi
tion of the course the team will face.

"She said that the rough was up and the
greens were fast, and so it'll be a good test of
golf," Ray said. "I like the fact that this course is
a little bit harder than some of the other region
al sites. It provides some separation in scoring,
and our guys seem to play decently well on more
challenging courses. So we're looking forward to
that."
Wilson who won a junior event on the OSU
Scarlet Course in 2009 will certainly be look
ing to continue his solid play from the recent
Pac-12 Tournament, in which he finished ninth
for his first ever top-10 finish at the conference
championships.

Junior Cameron Wilson (above) and the No. 10 Stanford men's golf team will have to beat out 12 other squads to advance from the
Columbus regional of the NCAA Tournament to the National Championship Tournament, which will be held in Atlanta from May 28-June 2.
In the junior's two previous re
gional appearances, Stanford has
landed on both sides of the coin,
falling short in 2011 but advancing
to NCAAs last year. With both ex
periences under his belt, Wilson
knows that pressing too hard in
what could be a season-ending tour
nament isn't beneficial.
"I don't think we'll treat this dif
ferently than our other events," Wil
son said of the regional. "We've
been finishing in the top five for
most of the season against fields
that are a little deeper than this one.
If we keep the same attitude and
mindset, I like our chances to ad
vance."
If the team is to vie for the win in

Columbus, both Rodgers and Yun
will need bounce-back tournaments
after disappointing Pac-12 show
ings. After placing eighth in the
Pac-12 Tournament his freshman
year in 2011, Rodgers wasn't able to
replicate that top-10 performance at
the Los Angeles Country Club, fin
ishing 11th. But the No. 6-ranked
collegiate golfer in the nation is still
dangerous, and he is confident that
the regional will be an entirely dif
ferent story.
"I had a disappointing last few
days after getting off to a nice start
in Pac-12s, but that's the nature of
golf and it's going to happen,"
Rodgers commented. "I was well
prepared for the event and just did
n't have my best stuff come tourna
ment time. This time, my game is
again right where it needs to be; if I
can stay disciplined mentally
throughout the event and control
my golf ball, the result will be in my

and the team's favor."
Yun, the 2012 Pac-12 individual
champion, endured a rough title de
fense campaign in Southern Califor
nia, tying for 29th. Even though the
regional could be his final collegiate
tournament, the 'lceman' has seem
ingly rubber skin that even the most
disheartening of performances can't
permeate.
"You have disappointing per
formances and good performances,"
Yun said. "Every day, every round
and every shot is a new beginning.
What a great golfer does is learn
from their mistakes and maintain
their confidence and belief in them
selves. It is easy to lose confidence
with a bad tournament, but I'm con
fident in both my ability and in my
preparation so I believe that my
best golf lies ahead."

Facing its first score-low-or-go-home test of
the season, the No. 10 Stanford men's golf team
begins play at the NCAA Columbus Regional
today looking to advance to the National Cham
pionship Tournament for the second straight
year.
The field, which Cardinal head coach Con
rad Ray characterized as "very competitive," in
cludes No. 5 New Mexico, No. 19 Auburn, No. 22
South Carolina, UNIAf Missouri, Texas Tech and
Chattanooga. In addition, the event features
eight of the country's top-50 individuals. The top
five teams plus the lowest-scoring individual not
on those teams will advance to the NCAA Cham
pionships May 28 through June 2 in Atlanta, Ga.
The Cardinal will be looking to get off the
ground quickly and start better than it did at the

Pac-12 Championships a few weeks ago, when
the team found itself in sixth place after 18 holes.
Course familiarity won't be a huge issue for
the Cardinal, as the team's top three players
senior Andrew Yun, junior Cameron Wilson and
sophomore Patrick Rodgers have all played
on the Ohio State Scarlet Course where the re
gional is hosted.
"The keys to playing well on that course are
good driving and lag putting," said Yun, who not
ed that he played the course as junior in high
school as well as the past two years for a Nation
wide Tour event.
"If you can find the fairways, you can be real
ly aggressive to any pin location on the greens,"
Yun continued. "That said, the greens are very
large and undulating. If you miss an iron shot,
you will most likely find the green but have a
lengthy putt. If you can lag your putts well, then
you can minimize your mistakes."

Ray concurred, adding that he had talked to
the Ohio State women's golf coach at the
women's NCAA West Regional about the condi
tion of the course the team will face.

"She said that the rough was up and the
greens were fast, and so it'll be a good test of
golf," Ray said. "I like the fact that this course is
a little bit harder than some of the other region
al sites. It provides some separation in scoring,
and our guys seem to play decently well on more
challenging courses. So we're looking forward to
that."
Wilson who won a junior event on the OSU
Scarlet Course in 2009 will certainly be look
ing to continue his solid play from the recent
Pac-12 Tournament, in which he finished ninth
for his first ever top-10 finish at the conference
championships.


SHIRLEY PEFLEY/The Stanford Daily
Junior Cameron Wilson (above) and the No. 10 Stanford men's golf team will have to beat out 12 other squads to advance from the
Columbus regional of the NCAA Tournament to the National Championship Tournament, which will be held in Atlanta from May 28-June 2.
In the junior's two previous re
gional appearances, Stanford has
landed on both sides of the coin,
falling short in 2011 but advancing
to NCAAs last year. With both ex
periences under his belt, Wilson
knows that pressing too hard in
what could be a season-ending tour
nament isn't beneficial.
"I don't think we'll treat this dif
ferently than our other events," Wil
son said of the regional. "We've
been finishing in the top five for
most of the season against fields
that are a little deeper than this one.
If we keep the same attitude and
mindset, I like our chances to ad
vance."
If the team is to vie for the win in

Columbus, both Rodgers and Yun
will need bounce-back tournaments
after disappointing Pac-12 show
ings. After placing eighth in the
Pac-12 Tournament his freshman
year in 2011, Rodgers wasn't able to
replicate that top-10 performance at
the Los Angeles Country Club, fin
ishing 11th. But the No. 6-ranked
collegiate golfer in the nation is still
dangerous, and he is confident that
the regional will be an entirely dif
ferent story.
"I had a disappointing last few
days after getting off to a nice start
in Pac-12s, but that's the nature of
golf and it's going to happen,"
Rodgers commented. "I was well
prepared for the event and just did
n't have my best stuff come tourna
ment time. This time, my game is
again right where it needs to be; if I
can stay disciplined mentally
throughout the event and control
my golf ball, the result will be in my

and the team's favor."
Yun, the 2012 Pac-12 individual
champion, endured a rough title de
fense campaign in Southern Califor
nia, tying for 29th. Even though the
regional could be his final collegiate
tournament, the 'lceman' has seem
