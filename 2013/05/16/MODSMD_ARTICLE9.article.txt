# ROAD TO ATLANTA

### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Facing its first score-low-or-go-home test of
the season, the No. 10 Stanford men's golf team
begins play at the NCAA Columbus Regional
today looking to advance to the National Cham
pionship Tournament for the second straight
year.
The field, which Cardinal head coach Con
rad Ray characterized as "very competitive," in
cludes No. 5 New Mexico, No. 19 Auburn, No. 22
South Carolina, UNIAf Missouri, Texas Tech and
Chattanooga. In addition, the event features
eight of the country's top-50 individuals. The top
five teams plus the lowest-scoring individual not
on those teams will advance to the NCAA Cham
pionships May 28 through June 2 in Atlanta, Ga.
The Cardinal will be looking to get off the
ground quickly and start better than it did at the

Pac-12 Championships a few weeks ago, when
the team found itself in sixth place after 18 holes.
Course familiarity won't be a huge issue for
the Cardinal, as the team's top three players
senior Andrew Yun, junior Cameron Wilson and
sophomore Patrick Rodgers have all played
on the Ohio State Scarlet Course where the re
gional is hosted.
"The keys to playing well on that course are
good driving and lag putting," said Yun, who not
ed that he played the course as junior in high
school as well as the past two years for a Nation
wide Tour event.
"If you can find the fairways, you can be real
ly aggressive to any pin location on the greens,"
Yun continued. "That said, the greens are very
large and undulating. If you miss an iron shot,
you will most likely find the green but have a
lengthy putt. If you can lag your putts well, then
you can minimize your mistakes."

Ray concurred, adding that he had talked to
the Ohio State women's golf coach at the
women's NCAA West Regional about the condi
tion of the course the team will face.

"She said that the rough was up and the
greens were fast, and so it'll be a good test of
golf," Ray said. "I like the fact that this course is
a little bit harder than some of the other region
al sites. It provides some separation in scoring,
and our guys seem to play decently well on more
challenging courses. So we're looking forward to
that."
Wilson who won a junior event on the OSU
Scarlet Course in 2009 will certainly be look
ing to continue his solid play from the recent
Pac-12 Tournament, in which he finished ninth
for his first ever top-10 finish at the conference
championships.
