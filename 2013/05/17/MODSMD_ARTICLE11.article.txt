# OPINIONS
## NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND Returning to Reality 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
I have been avoiding writing this
column for about three weeks
now and I might avoid get
ting to the point for a few more sen
tences.

I think I fell back into depres
sion again for these last few weeks.
I am not entirely sure what "de
pression" actually entails, but I am
pretty sure lying in bed all day and
sighing, feeling unable to leave my
room not to mention my bed
being unmotivated to do my work,
talk to my friends or do my ex
tracurriculars (including this col
umn) and undertaking mindless
tasks like attempting to look
through every photo I uploaded to
Facebook (2,049 (I gave up before
the year 2007 ended)) might consti
tute some sort of issue.

I started my column this school
year addressing the underlying
loneliness I had felt for most of my
freshman and sophomore years.
My experiences being black and
gay left me feeling marginalized
and alienated (in part my own do
ing and in part a result of larger so
cial issues within the gay world
around this country). Coming to
terms with these rather personal
feelings on such a public level gave
me the momentum I needed to
push past issues of internalized
racism, self-hatred and self-de
structive behavior and so did liv
ing in a safe space for black stu
dents (Ujamaa House) and spend
ing my winter quarter abroad in
Cape Town.
Living in South Africa for three
months largely gave me the break I
needed. I was not tortured by my
usual constant (and fruitless) desire
for "masculine," "strB," "athletic"
white guys. This is not to say that
racial politics of desire did not exist
in Cape Town, where gay spaces
were segregated by class and race
much like every other social
space. But being in a new context
gave me a lot to be preoccupied with
beyond my lack of a relationship
(which I seem to be constantly re
minded of on campus). In particular,
being in a country where the major
ity of people I encountered looked
like me reinforced the notion I had
just begun to internalize last
spring: that black is beautiful.
Slowly making my way back to
campus with stops in Istanbul and
Rome, I experienced something
that I hadn't before being exoti
cized in a positive way, attracting a
lot of interested glances just walk
ing down the street or getting mes-

sages on my Grindr profile, among
other hook-up apps.
I did not experience a post-Cape
Town slump in part because I was
only on campus for two weeks be
fore leaving for another 10 days to
attend the 2013 School of Authentic
Journalism in Mexico City. As I
wrote about in the last column I
posted online, SAJ was an extreme
ly euphoric experience. Most no
tably, I caught my first glimpse of
what it might feel like to be in love.
Returning from Mexico at the
start of week five, I finally hit the
slump I thought returning from
Cape Town would bring. Week five
was only the third full week I had
spent in the United States this year,
and it was the first week that I re
alized the racial dynamics of the
American gay world would once
again become my norm. Having left
Cape Town, Istanbul and Mexico
knowing full well that other people
saw my beauty and that I was capa
ble of loving and being loved, re
turning to this American context
was especially harsh.
And knowing what could be, I
felt even more impatient than ever
to find people to connect with.
Though there is something trou
bling about the instant gratification
mentality behind online dating and
hook-up culture, this did not stop
me from trying my hand at it once
again. And while I like to complain
there is no one who meets my stan
dards on campus, I know this is not
the case. There are enough critical
ly thinking, motivated queer men of
color at Stanford some of whom

I've expressed interest in before.
Two things prevent me from fol
lowing through, though a fear of
commitment and of actually getting
what I want or deserve, and the
nagging belief I have that if I
phrase a message the right way or
find just the right picture of me, I
will nab the hot, masculine, athletic
white guy that proves so elusive.
This latter issue is a frustrating
one that many queer men of color I
have spoken with experience. But it
is also one that I think I can mini
mize by spending time in spaces
that are more comfortable
spending more time around queer
people of color, spending more time
off campus, etc.
On the former issues, I men
tioned two columns ago that the
School of Authentic Journalism
gave me enough free time to be
open with myself and with others.
This time to be selfless or rather

time away from needing to stick to
my own agendas of school work, ex
tracurricular activities and career
building does not exist at Stan
ford (or probably on any college
campus). But this break from fo
cusing on my own success is exact
ly what I need to feel comfortable
devoting time and energy to anoth
er person or other people.

The two times I've been off cam
pus since returning from SAJ I felt

remarkably better, and the two
times I've returned to campus since
SAJ I have sunken back into feel
ing defeated. Self hatred and self
destructive behaviors have not
been an issue which is a huge de
velopment from my freshman and
sophomore years and the inter
nalized racism is much less of an "I
am not beautiful" issue and more of
a "I desire white guys and think
they are more attractive, even

though I know they are not" issue.
I write this column today be
cause I am largely over the depres
sion I had been experiencing re
cently. I also write once again to let
anyone else who is experiencing
something similar know that you
are not alone.
A luta continua.
