## Ngai beats panda in EIC race, eh? New president savors last months of freedom, friends 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Edward Ngai 'l5 of Canada,
Canada, was elected prime minister
of The Stanford Daily last night.
Ngai eked out a narrow victory
over I.M. Fattie, an inanimate pan
da whom The Stanford Review
borrowing heavily from CNN's
columnists nevertheless project
ed as the winner at 12:30 a.m. based
on exit polling. The Review, which
offers the most in-depth coverage of
Daily elections on campus, cited the
controversial layout of the ballot as
a reason for the inaccuracy.
Managing Editor of News Mar
shall Watkins 'l5 and Deputy Edi
tor Alice Phillips 'l5 responded to
the news with the announcement
that they will head abroad for fall
quarter. In fact, they were already
en route to the airport as results
were finalized.

Ngai's victory provided welcome
respite to the bitter despair cur
rently pervading Ngai's native
Canada. Since the San Jose Sharks,
led by winger Joseph Beyda 'l5,
knocked off the Vancouver Canucks,
horrible riots have ravaged the tun
dra.

News Desk Editors Justine 'l5
and Olivia Moore 'l5 woke up to ex
press delight about Ngai's election
and proceeded to write several arti-

cles on the subject posthaste.
Winston Shi 'l6 responded with
utter shock.

"Why wasn't Shannon Turley
elected?" Shi asked. "It would have
made Banquet perfect."
Ngai's platform proposed a re
vised printing schedule that would
shift production hours to start at
4:20 p.m. Chief Operating Officer
Margaret Rawson 'l2 welcomed
the proposal, saying that the new
hours would finally mean company
other than Vice President of Sales
Caroline Caselli 'l2 and the office
dog for her during business hours.
The Daily will also feature a re
vamped weekend issue, notable for
in the incoming editor in chief's
words "all the pretty pictures,"
as well as hard-hitting investiga
tions into important topics such as
identifying the top five sandwich
places on campus. Ngai also be
lieves that The Daily's largest and
most active section the graphics
team should be cut.
In its place, Head Copy Editor
Willa Brock 'l4 plans on increas
ing her Copy Tip of the Week
emails to twice monthly.
Managing Editor of Sports
George Chen 'l5 is the favorite to
be named Ngai's deputy editor.

Ngai cited Chen's familiarity with
cold, barren winters in his home
town somewhere near Horse
heads, N.Y., as a vital qualification.
Chen's pocket presence also set
him apart from the other person
willing to spend five nights a week
with Ngai.
News Editor Molly Vorwerck
'l4, overcome with joy, composed a
quick series of Q&As with the in
coming editor in chief and every
one else who happened to be in the
office.
Others were less enthused. Co-
Ho Managing Editor Sam Fisher
'l4, who has recently found himself
unemployed, didn't really care, only
seeking to ensure that the new edi
tor in chief would furnish him with
as many EANABs as he wanted
from Treehouse.
News Desk Editor Danny Gif
ford 'l6 has been trapped in Sigma
Nu for the past month and could not
be reached for comment.
Fellow Canada, Canada, native
Carly Rae Jepsen will sing the
Canadian National Anthem, "Call

Me Maybe," at Ngai's inauguration.
In a statement, Jepsen said that she
was "honored to play a part in a
monumental day for the Canadian
people."
Outgoing Editor in Chief Miles
Bennett-Smith 'l3, meanwhile,
voiced delight that Ngai's election
and his own shift to becoming The
Daily's Chief Operating Officer
would allow him to spend more
or any time at the office. Many
have speculated, however, that the
only real reason for his return is to
play in one more Ink Bowl.
ASSU Executive Billy Gallagher
'l4, a great American, vowed to con
test the results. Gallagher subse
quently delegated the task to Co-
Executive Dan Ashton 'l4, who will
figure out how exactly that can be
done.
Gallagher is a former Daily
staffer.
