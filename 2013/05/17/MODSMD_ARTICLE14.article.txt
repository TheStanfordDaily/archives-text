Sophomore diver Kristian Ipsen qualified for the
2013 FINA World Championships in the 1-meter
springboard event at the World Championship Trials
on Wednesday in Tallahassee, Fla.
Ipsen, a bronze medalist at the 2012 London
Olympics and three-time NCAA champion, won the 1-
meter comfortably with a score of 835.60. The NCAA
Diver of the Year beat out runner-up Harrison Jones
by over 50 points.
"I've always wanted to do 1-meter at a world meet,
but I'm usually doing 3-meter [springboard] and 3-me
ter synchro, and three events is a little tiring," Ipsen
told GoStanford.com. "Since I'm not diving synchro
with anyone this year, I thought I might as well do 1-
meter."
The World Championships is the second most pres
tigious competition in the sport of diving, behind only
the Olympics.

Ipsen is well known for his clutch performances on
the big stage. In addition to winning bronze in London
last summer, Ipsen took silver at the 2009 World
Championships in the 3-meter synchro with diving
partner Troy Dumais.

Hoping to go two-for-two, Ipsen also competed in
the semifinal round of the 3-meter springboard yester
day. The sophomore star led the field with 872.25
points, 54.50 points clear of Miami junior Sam Dor
man. The 3-meter final session will begin Sunday
morning.
