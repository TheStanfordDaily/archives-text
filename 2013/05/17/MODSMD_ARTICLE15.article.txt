# Crew heads to Pac-12 Championships
## 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
The Stanford men's and women's rowing teams will
compete in the Pac-12 Championships at Lake Natoma
in Gold River, Calif., this Sunday.
The Cardinal is coming off mixed results at the Big
Row against Cal two weeks ago, when the men won the
Schwabacher Cup for the first time in five years while
the women lost the Lambert Cup for the fourth consec
utive season. Sunday represents a chance for No. 10
Cardinal women to get their revenge, though No. 1
USC is expected to come away with the conference title.
It has been four years since either Stanford rowing
team won gold at the conference championships. In
2009, the No. 1 Stanford women set a course record en
route to the Pac-10 title.
