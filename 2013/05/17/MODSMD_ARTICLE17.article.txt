# ROBBER BARONS deliver laughs with spring show

Sometimes the best way to
look at the world around us
is by laughing at it. In
"SketchX: Robber Barons," the
student sketch comedy group's
spring show does just that. In a col
lection of skits that last about an
hour, the Robber Barons manage
to make fun of aspects of campus
from pre-major advisors, to frats,
to totem poles, to themselves. By
setting their show in the Geology
Corner, right in a classroom, the
feel of college and the campus they
are making fun of becomes even
more apparent.
The Robber Barons work as a
company to create their shows, and
that sense of company is visible in
their performance. They each brain
storm and write skits throughout the
first five to six weeks of the quarter
before they begin the editing and
rehearsal process. Their collaboration
creates many different types of skits,
including one reminiscent of Dr.
Seuss and another examining a sup
port group for only children. Head
writers Brady Richter 'l5 and Henry
Schreiber 'l5 do a great job with all

these varied topics, keeping the clev
erly written skits fresh and exciting,
i The transitions between these con
trasting skits are done well; director
Tess McCarthy 'l6 creates a fluid
show, with music that relates to the
theme of the show connecting the
skits to one another.
However, no matter the topic,

one thing is consistent across all
skits: Political correctness is throwi
out the window in this hilarious
and irreverent show. Framed as a
TED Talk about what makes a suc
cessful world leader (hint: for any
of you wishing to go into politics,
it's a less than appealing physical
appearance), the show makes cre-

ative use of varying devices such as
m poetry, song and even a discussion
by a student's body parts. A partic
ularly memorable skit about the
:- airline industry manages to make
fun of racial stereotyping, language
barriers, dialect differences across
the country and corporate workers'
inability to think on their own, all

in one skit.
The "Dora the Explorer" skit
satirizes dozens of aspects of cam
pus life. McCarthy's Dora asks the
audience to go on a quest with her
to find her keys from her previous
drunken night. Another standout
skit pokes fun at spoken word
poetry: Kevin Hurlbutt '14 gives a
hilarious and memorable perform
ance with his incredibly creative
and witty poem. Indeed, the skits
revolving around campus issues
are the most relatable, and, because
of that, they are among the funni
est and strongest of the show.
From laugh-out-loud jokes to
more subtle humor, the Robber
Barons provide a skit for everyone.
Their group effort is evident in the
way they work together and play
off of each other's energy. They
showcase a vastly differing array of
skits and are sure to bring absurdi
ty and hilarity to Geology Corner
this weekend.

SketchX: Robber Barons will be
playing May 16th and 18th at
8:30p.m. in the Geology Corner.
