### Andrea Hinton | MANAGING EDITOR 
The haute couture glamour
that is the Cannes
International Film
Festival kicked off at the Palais
des Festivals et des Congres., off
the coast of the French Riviera, on
Wednesday. The massive event,
widely considered to be the
granddaddy of film festivals, will
showcase several of the works
already thought to be in the run
ning for various awards next win
ter. Here are a few of the best
Cannes will offer.

"The Bling Ring"
Writer and director Sofia
Coppola's dramatic reworking of
the fame-obsessed teenage smug
glers' antics stars Katie Chang as
Rebecca, the ringleader of the Los
Angeles-based group. Emma
Watson stars as Nicki, one of
several vapid girls who wind up
in legal trouble. Don't expect
Best Actress-level performances
from this film, but the movie
will surely be a summer hit. It will
be released June 14.

"As I Lay Dying"
William Faulkner's famous novel
hits the big screen for the first
time, starring James Franco as the
second-eldest of the Ã¼biquitous
Bundren family, which spends the
film attempting to fill their moth
er's wish to be buried in a particu
lar place. Franco's first role as
director may win him big awards
at the festival; the film will com
pete for the Un certain regard
award, presented to innovative
works at the festival.

"The Past"
Directed by Asghar Farhadi, win
ner of the Academy Award for
Best Foreign Film for his 2011
film "A Separation," "The Past" (Le

Passe) is an immigrant romance in
the backdrop of a messy separation
and divorce. Berenice Bejo (best
known internationally for her lead
role in the 2011 Best Picture win
ner "The Artist") stars as Marie, the
woman caught between two diffi
cult relationships. Watch for "The
Past" to complete strongly for the
Palme d'Or, Cannes' most presti
gious film award.

"Fruitvale Station"
"Fruitvale Station" is a drama
detailing the true story of a race
motivated murder in Oakland,
Calif. The all-star cast, including
Octavia Spencer and Melonie
Diaz, features the up-and-coming
actor Michael B. fordan, known
well for his television work in
"The Wire" and "Friday Night
Lights." The film will also compete
for Ull certain regard.
