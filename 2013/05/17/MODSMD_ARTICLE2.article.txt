## Festival sees more funding, better planning 
### CLARISSE PERALTA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Frost Music and Arts Festi
val â€” featuring psychedelic rock
band MGMT and opening acts De
lorean and Kuroma returns to
morrow for its second year, with this
year's iteration marked by greater
student involvement in event coordi
nation and efforts to promote future
financial and attendance growth.
All 5,000 festival tickets had sold
out by Thursday. Around 2,000 tick
ets were allotted for undergraduate
students, 1,500 tickets for the gener
al public and about 650 to 700 tickets
for graduate students based on last
year's attendance, according to
Frances Ball 'l5, financial director
for the Stanford Concert Network
(SCN).
Haley Sayres 'l4, director of
SCN, noted that last year's success
prompted organization for this year's

event to occur more efficiently.
"There's a lot more organization,
since last year was kind of a trial
run," Sayres said. "Now, we know
where to look for food vendors and
how to set up security."
This year's festival also promises
to feature more student art.
"We have increased the arts
budget substantially, and that itself
became its own class offered in the
[Mechanical Engineering] Depart
ment," Sayres said, referencing
ME 191: Engineering Problems
and Experimental Investigation.
SCN received a $20,000 dona
tion from the Stanford Arts Insti
tute to fund the student art projects
and pay for more opening acts.

Matthew Tiews M.A. '99 Ph.D.
'O4, executive director of arts pro
grams, said that one of the primary
goals of the Institute is to support
student art-making and creative ex
pression.

"I certainly hope we will be able
to do even more to foster a vibrant
concert culture at Stanford going
forward," Tiews said.
Financial Stability
According to Ball, Frost's budg

et is in much better shape com
pared to last year's. The event's
headliners totaled about $90,000
and preparation costs amounted to
about $lOO,OOO.
"A lot of expenses were last
minute, things we didn't foresee,"

Ball said. "Now, we have a pretty
good idea of what we need and
started planning as early as Octo
ber."

She noted, however, that the

The Frost Music and Arts Festival, which returns Saturday, has benefited from additional funding and planing
time this year. Frost organizers hope that the added outlets for student art and expression will help the
festival cement its emerging role as a Stanford tradition, as had been the case in the 1970s.
event received more donations last
year.

"A lot of departments gave us
around $lO,OOO to $20,000 because
it was the first time that Frost was
being done after so many years,"
she said.

This year, most of the funding
came from special fees, the Office
of Alcohol Policy and Education
(OAPE) and the Graduate Student
Council (GSC). SCN received
$163,450 in total through this
year's special fees process, while
OAPE and the GSC donated $7,500
and $5,000 respectively to the
event.
"The contribution from the
GSC was intended for marketing
purposes," Ball said. "They wanted
us to encourage graduate students
to go, so that covered various ex
penses, such as posters."
Revenue from last year's ticket
sales also supported an increase in
this year's budget. Almost 5,000 at
tendees filled Frost Amphitheater
for last year's concert, the first of
its size in the venue since the 1980s.

"We made about $60,000 from
ticket sales last year, and this year
we've already surpassed that," Ball
said.

SCN received a number of com
plaints from students, however, be
cause tickets at the discounted
price sold out quickly.
"There is definitely a much
higher demand this year, especially
for group ticket sales, which went
over than what we expected," Ball
said. "But we're also more than
breaking even, which is good."

A growing culture
Snehal Naik, associate director
of Student Activities and Leader
ship and direct advisor to SCN, ex
pressed confidence that given the
success of last year's festival, Frost
will be here to stay as long as it
continues to draw sizeable crowds.

"Frost used to be this huge ven
ue where all kinds of artists

played," Naik said. "I would love
for it to become another Greek
Theatre that competes with other
venues in the Bay Area."
Sayres maintained that al
though Frost is on course to be
come a self-sustaining financial
model, it would never recreate its
heyday.

"We can strive to have that
same vibe and feel, but it will never
be as laid-back because there are
lot more considerations now than
in the '7os and 'Bos," Sayres said.
She expressed hope, however,
that Frost would become a Stan
ford tradition while enjoying fur
ther increases in student interest.

"[The concert culture] is devel
oping on its own," Sayres said. "We
see it with the trend in music festi
vals, such as the number of people
going to Coachella, which has in
creased exponentially.
"Frost could potentially turn in
to an all-day event, and we would
have more money to pay for bigger
openers," she added.
Naik framed hosting a diverse
range of performers as another av
enue for exploration.
"Music is tough in that you can't
please everybody," Naik said. "I
think as long as we offer diverse
types of music, it will strengthen
the culture on campus. There are
endless possibilities."
