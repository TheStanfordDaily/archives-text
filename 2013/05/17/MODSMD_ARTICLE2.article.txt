### CLARISSE PERALTA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Frost Music and Arts Festi
val â€” featuring psychedelic rock
band MGMT and opening acts De
lorean and Kuroma returns to
morrow for its second year, with this
year's iteration marked by greater
student involvement in event coordi
nation and efforts to promote future
financial and attendance growth.
All 5,000 festival tickets had sold
out by Thursday. Around 2,000 tick
ets were allotted for undergraduate
students, 1,500 tickets for the gener
al public and about 650 to 700 tickets
for graduate students based on last
year's attendance, according to
Frances Ball 'l5, financial director
for the Stanford Concert Network
(SCN).
Haley Sayres 'l4, director of
SCN, noted that last year's success
prompted organization for this year's

event to occur more efficiently.
"There's a lot more organization,
since last year was kind of a trial
run," Sayres said. "Now, we know
where to look for food vendors and
how to set up security."
This year's festival also promises
to feature more student art.
"We have increased the arts
budget substantially, and that itself
became its own class offered in the
[Mechanical Engineering] Depart
ment," Sayres said, referencing
ME 191: Engineering Problems
and Experimental Investigation.
SCN received a $20,000 dona
tion from the Stanford Arts Insti
tute to fund the student art projects
and pay for more opening acts.

Matthew Tiews M.A. '99 Ph.D.
'O4, executive director of arts pro
grams, said that one of the primary
goals of the Institute is to support
student art-making and creative ex
pression.

"I certainly hope we will be able
to do even more to foster a vibrant
concert culture at Stanford going
forward," Tiews said.
Financial Stability
According to Ball, Frost's budg

et is in much better shape com
pared to last year's. The event's
headliners totaled about $90,000
and preparation costs amounted to
about $lOO,OOO.
"A lot of expenses were last
minute, things we didn't foresee,"

Ball said. "Now, we have a pretty
good idea of what we need and
started planning as early as Octo
ber."

She noted, however, that the

The Frost Music and Arts Festival, which returns Saturday, has benefited from additional funding and planing
time this year. Frost organizers hope that the added outlets for student art and expression will help the
festival cement its emerging role as a Stanford tradition, as had been the case in the 1970s.
