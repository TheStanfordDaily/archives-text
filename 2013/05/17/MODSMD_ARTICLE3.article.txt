## SSE hosts business crash course 
### CLARISSE PERALTA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Applications close this Sunday for the
ninth-annual Business Leadership Pro
gram (BLP), an intensive five-day confer
ence hosted by Stanford Student Enter
prises (SSE) before classes begin in Sep
tember.

The program, which will accept 50 ris
ing seniors and co-term students, was ini
tially created to provide according to
BLP's website "a concentrated, focused
and guided opportunity for business educa
tion" in an effort to address the lack of a
pre-business major.
BLP includes case study workshops,
lectures by Stanford professors and one
on-one sessions with representatives from
companies like J.R Morgan, Cooliris and
Accenture. According to Miller Aaron 'l5,
general manager of development at SSE,
BLP is unique because of the intimate set
ting it creates for participants.

"This differentiates it from other career

development and networking programs,
which sets the tone for the conference,"
Aaron said. "It also strips away much of the
formality and tension that surrounds re
cruiting events."
According to Eric Mattson 'l5, last
year's BLP director, participants described
the networking experiences as invaluable.
"One student said that the night events
allowed for them and the representatives
to both present a more candid, authentic
side of themselves," Mattson said. "It was
definitely memorable for both the students
and the reps because they got to interact
on a more personal level and beyond the
scope of work."
Students also attend skills workshops
and learn how to prepare for interviews,
which "ensure that the potential of each
participant is maximized," according to
Aaron.

"Like anything that you dedicate a full
week to, the benefits are much pronounced
than when investing your time sporadical
ly," Aaron said. "The program is designed

to provide quick comparisons and serve as
an immersion into networking."
While Aaron could not yet provide the
final number of applicants for this year's
conference, he noted that there has already
been an increase in applications and a
more academically diverse applicant group
from previous years.
He attributed the increase in part to the
program's efforts to recruit both firms and
students from a wide range of industries.
"We hope that by incorporating more
variety, we can attract students who might
not typically identify as being 'interested in
business,"' Aaron said.
According to Aaron, SSE has pursued
partnerships with several startups, non
profit organizations and small technology
firms that would otherwise be overshad
owed during the recruiting season.
"In the past, we have had complaints
about the lack of sector diversity, with fi
nance and consulting firms seemingly dom
inating the roster," Aaron said. "We want
more firms and students to be involved,
and so there has been much effort to re
brand BLIf which has proven fruitful so
far."

Andy Wang 'l4, an economics and earth
systems major who attended the confer
ence last year, said that BLP allowed him
to "get a jump start" on assessing potential
career paths.
"One of the most useful components of
BLP was the diversity of companies that
were involved, which allowed me to explore
different industries, as well as the positions
these companies offered," Wang said.
On the final day of the conference,
Wang was able to engage in an in-depth
conversation with a Google representative,
which he cited as one of the most valuable
experiences of the program.
"I enjoyed that immensely because I
was able to gain a more informed perspec
tive [of] my career interests, aside from the
avalanche of information that we were pre
sented with throughout the week," Wang
said.
