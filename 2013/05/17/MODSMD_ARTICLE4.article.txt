### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard a report from
a panel of faculty members on the future of
the Ph.D. degree at its meeting on Thurs
day.

Senate Chair Raymond Levitt M.S. '73
Ph.D. '75, professor of civil and environ
mental engineering, opened the meeting
by congratulating six faculty members
newly elected to the National Academy of
Sciences.

The subsequent panel discussion fea
tured Professor of Philosophy Debra Satz,
Professor of Engineering Jim Plummer
M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7l, Professor of Biology
Bob Simoni, Professor of Political Science
Josiah Ober and Professor of Biochemistry
Daniel Herschlag.

of German and comparative literature and
the discussion's moderator, the panel was
intended to launch a discussion about the
future of the Ph.D. program that would
serve as a starting point for further delib
eration.
"We wanted to frame some of the issues
that could be part of the discussion for next

Berman opened the presentation by
discussing critical aspects of current Ph.D.
programs in the humanities, including an
increasing recognition in some quarters
of the breadth of careers options avail

native careers with disdain," he acknowl
edged. "Some students don't want their ad

visors to know they are considering that
path."

Berman noted the importance of as
sessing the internal structure of the hu
manities' Ph.D. programs.
"Are we preparing our students appro
priately for the career options they'll
have?" he asked. "To what extent do we
provide appropriately broadened profes
sional development opportunities?... I
think we do that well at Stanford, but are
we doing enough and are we doing what's
appropriate?"
Berman also emphasized the impor
tance of developing hard data over a long
time period on students' post-graduation
entry into various careers.
Satz agreed with many of Berman's
