## Faculty Senate considers Ph.D. degree's future 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard a report from
a panel of faculty members on the future of
the Ph.D. degree at its meeting on Thurs
day.

Senate Chair Raymond Levitt M.S. '73
Ph.D. '75, professor of civil and environ
mental engineering, opened the meeting
by congratulating six faculty members
newly elected to the National Academy of
Sciences.

The subsequent panel discussion fea
tured Professor of Philosophy Debra Satz,
Professor of Engineering Jim Plummer
M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7l, Professor of Biology
Bob Simoni, Professor of Political Science
Josiah Ober and Professor of Biochemistry
Daniel Herschlag.

According to Russell Berman, professor
of German and comparative literature and
the discussion's moderator, the panel was
intended to launch a discussion about the
future of the Ph.D. program that would
serve as a starting point for further delib
eration.
"We wanted to frame some of the issues
that could be part of the discussion for next
year's session," Berman said.
Berman opened the presentation by
discussing critical aspects of current Ph.D.
programs in the humanities, including an
increasing recognition in some quarters
of the breadth of careers options avail
able beyond academia for Ph.D. students.
"For many grad students, there's an as
sumption that faculty look at certain alter
native careers with disdain," he acknowl
edged. "Some students don't want their ad

visors to know they are considering that
path."

Berman noted the importance of as
sessing the internal structure of the hu
manities' Ph.D. programs.
"Are we preparing our students appro
priately for the career options they'll
have?" he asked. "To what extent do we
provide appropriately broadened profes
sional development opportunities?... I
think we do that well at Stanford, but are
we doing enough and are we doing what's
appropriate?"
Berman also emphasized the impor
tance of developing hard data over a long
time period on students' post-graduation
entry into various careers.
Satz agreed with many of Berman's
points and reflected on a study con
ducted by the School of Humanities
and Sciences on the doctoral Class of
2002's employment 10 years after
graduation.
"Roughly 50 to 60 percent [of the
students] were in academic careers,"
Satz said. "But we couldn't find a lot of
the others. We need to do more re
search because we need to know if we
are serving those students well and
how satisfied they are with their train
ing."
According to Satz, many humani
ties students are confused by the job
market and are unsure about their
ability to apply their degrees in fields
beyond academia.
"We need to know what's happen
ing to our students," she said. "We
need to have a discussion about what
the Ph.D.'s for."
Plummer subsequently spoke
about the happiness of School of Engi
neering faculty with the state of the
Ph.D. program. According to Plum
mer, roughly 80 percent of the School's
doctoral graduates go into industry.
"[That] is not surprising given
where we are, in the Silicon Valley,"
Plummer reflected. "We have the op
posite problem of many other depart
ments on campus: that too few of our
students don't want to go on to aca

demic careers."

According to Ober, the Depart
ment of Political Science has seen both
an increasing number of applicants
and an increased yield among admits,
creating an increasingly selective pro
gram whose graduates have largely
obtained satisfactory employment.
"Virtually all of the students [are]
getting placement, although some
times it takes a couple of years," he
said. "About half go into research and
the other half into teaching at univer
sities or think tanks."

"I'd like to get a better sense of
why students seek admission to a
Ph.D. program in the first place,"
Ober added. "We need a sense of how
their thinking evolves about their aspi
rations... and how they think about
the value of the Ph.D. in later years.
We need to get a better and more de
tailed accurate university-funded data
set that would allow us to track evolv
ing student career ambitions and be
able to make adjustments to the Ph.D.
program that can best serve the stu
dents and society."
Simoni spoke about the strength of
the Biology Department's Ph.D. pro
gram, drawing attention to a high
number of applications. He also noted
recent changes to the biology curricu
lum, including the introduction of "mi
cro" or "mini" courses lasting less
than the duration of a quarter.

"The unit of course time is much
smaller, which allows them to do more
in a quarter," he elaborated. "It be
comes more focused and concentrated

and gives a lot of flexibility."
According to Herschlag, the School
of Medicine aims "to tell students that
they should be seeking a career of
their choice... We should be training
them for existing jobs and also train
ing them to find and create new
paths."

Herschlag criticized undergradu
ate education in the life sciences, say
ing it discourages aspiring graduate
students from taking risks.
"They would fail as graduate stu
dents," Herschlag said. "We are try
ing to put in place radically different
models that are more interactive and
collaborative, with hands-on problem
solving, to better train our students."
The panel presentation was fol
lowed by a wider faculty discussion.
Andrea Goldsmith, professor of
electrical engineering, expressed con
cern about focusing the Ph.D. pro
gram too much on career paths.

"This discussion should be about
an education, about a broadening of
horizons, that transcends engineering,
science [and] the humanities," she
said.

However, Herschlag reiterated the
broader issue of students being un
aware of different careers made acces
sible by their education.
"It's not necessarily that you're
getting a vocational training," he said.
"It is to help allay the fears of stu
dents."

Professors Josiah Ober, Jim Plummer M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7 1, Debra Satz and Russell Berman participated in a panel
discussion on the future of the doctoral degree at the Faculty Senate's meeting on Thursday afternoon in Law 190.
The Faculty Senate heard a report from
a panel of faculty members on the future of
the Ph.D. degree at its meeting on Thurs
day.

Senate Chair Raymond Levitt M.S. '73
Ph.D. '75, professor of civil and environ
mental engineering, opened the meeting
by congratulating six faculty members
newly elected to the National Academy of
Sciences.

The subsequent panel discussion fea
tured Professor of Philosophy Debra Satz,
Professor of Engineering Jim Plummer
M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7l, Professor of Biology
Bob Simoni, Professor of Political Science
Josiah Ober and Professor of Biochemistry
Daniel Herschlag.

According to Russell Berman, professor
of German and comparative literature and
the discussion's moderator, the panel was
intended to launch a discussion about the
future of the Ph.D. program that would
serve as a starting point for further delib
eration.
"We wanted to frame some of the issues
that could be part of the discussion for next
year's session," Berman said.
Berman opened the presentation by
discussing critical aspects of current Ph.D.
programs in the humanities, including an
increasing recognition in some quarters
of the breadth of careers options avail
able beyond academia for Ph.D. students.
"For many grad students, there's an as
sumption that faculty look at certain alter
native careers with disdain," he acknowl
edged. "Some students don't want their ad

visors to know they are considering that
path."

Berman noted the importance of as
sessing the internal structure of the hu
manities' Ph.D. programs.
"Are we preparing our students appro
priately for the career options they'll
have?" he asked. "To what extent do we
provide appropriately broadened profes
sional development opportunities?... I
think we do that well at Stanford, but are
we doing enough and are we doing what's
appropriate?"
Berman also emphasized the impor
tance of developing hard data over a long
time period on students' post-graduation
entry into various careers.
Satz agreed with many of Berman's
points and reflected on a study con
ducted by the School of Humanities
and Sciences on the doctoral Class of
2002's employment 10 years after
graduation.
"Roughly 50 to 60 percent [of the
students] were in academic careers,"
Satz said. "But we couldn't find a lot of
the others. We need to do more re
search because we need to know if we
are serving those students well and
how satisfied they are with their train
ing."
According to Satz, many humani
ties students are confused by the job
market and are unsure about their
ability to apply their degrees in fields
beyond academia.
"We need to know what's happen
ing to our students," she said. "We
need to have a discussion about what
the Ph.D.'s for."
Plummer subsequently spoke
about the happiness of School of Engi
neering faculty with the state of the
Ph.D. program. According to Plum
mer, roughly 80 percent of the School's
doctoral graduates go into industry.
"[That] is not surprising given
where we are, in the Silicon Valley,"
Plummer reflected. "We have the op
posite problem of many other depart
ments on campus: that too few of our
students don't want to go on to aca

demic careers."

According to Ober, the Depart
ment of Political Science has seen both
an increasing number of applicants
and an increased yield among admits,
creating an increasingly selective pro
gram whose graduates have largely
obtained satisfactory employment.
"Virtually all of the students [are]
getting placement, although some
times it takes a couple of years," he
said. "About half go into research and
the other half into teaching at univer
sities or think tanks."

"I'd like to get a better sense of
why students seek admission to a
Ph.D. program in the first place,"
Ober added. "We need a sense of how
their thinking evolves about their aspi
rations... and how they think about
the value of the Ph.D. in later years.
We need to get a better and more de
tailed accurate university-funded data
set that would allow us to track evolv
ing student career ambitions and be
able to make adjustments to the Ph.D.
program that can best serve the stu
dents and society."
Simoni spoke about the strength of
the Biology Department's Ph.D. pro
gram, drawing attention to a high
number of applications. He also noted
recent changes to the biology curricu
lum, including the introduction of "mi
cro" or "mini" courses lasting less
than the duration of a quarter.

"The unit of course time is much
smaller, which allows them to do more
in a quarter," he elaborated. "It be
comes more focused and concentrated

and gives a lot of flexibility."
According to Herschlag, the School
of Medicine aims "to tell students that
they should be seeking a career of
their choice... We should be training
them for existing jobs and also train
ing them to find and create new
paths."

Herschlag criticized undergradu
ate education in the life sciences, say
ing it discourages aspiring graduate
students from taking risks.
"They would fail as graduate stu
dents," Herschlag said. "We are try
ing to put in place radically different
models that are more interactive and
collaborative, with hands-on problem
solving, to better train our students."
The panel presentation was fol
lowed by a wider faculty discussion.
Andrea Goldsmith, professor of
electrical engineering, expressed con
cern about focusing the Ph.D. pro
gram too much on career paths.

"This discussion should be about
an education, about a broadening of
horizons, that transcends engineering,
science [and] the humanities," she
said.

However, Herschlag reiterated the
broader issue of students being un
aware of different careers made acces
sible by their education.
"It's not necessarily that you're
getting a vocational training," he said.
"It is to help allay the fears of stu
dents."
