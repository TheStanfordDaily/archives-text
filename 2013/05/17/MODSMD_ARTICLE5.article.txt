# Decoding masculinity
## Q&A ROBB WILLER PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY 
### ANGELA ZHANG 
Robb Wilier is an associate professor of sociology
and the author of research suggesting that men with
higher levels of testosterone are more likely to feel
threatened and act out in the form of masculine over
compensation. The Daily sat down with Wilier to dis
cuss the roots of his interests in masculinity studies,
his stance on the burgeoning field of men's studies
and what trends in male behavior reveal about the
state of the gender.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did you first get
interested in gender studies and sociology?
Robb Wilier (RW): I first became interested in the
area when I took a social psychology class as a junior
in college [Wilier attended the University of lowa for
his undergraduate degree]. Up to that time, I had
been primarily interested in creative writing. I real
ized that the things I found really interesting about
creative writing making observations about socie
ty and human nature were all things that I could do
through social science research.

TSD: How did you develop your current research
interest in masculinity, more specifically?
RW: When I was a graduate student at Cornell
University, I was watching "60 Minutes" one Sunday.
They had on a French psychologist who consults for
the "Big Three" automakers, telling them how to de
sign cars to better satisfy the psychological needs and
motivations of American consumers. And among oth
er things, he said that they tried to design SUVs to
make men feel powerful. As I watched this, it oc
curred to me that you could easily study a related
idea, namely that when men feel insecure about their
masculinity, they're more motivated to buy a SUV
From there, I got interested more generally in the dif
ferent things men might do when they feel threatened
in their masculinity measuring support for war and
homophobia as well. [My] research went from there.

TSD: Masculinity and emasculation are of
ten touchy subjects to address, particularly for
men like yourself. What interests you most about
