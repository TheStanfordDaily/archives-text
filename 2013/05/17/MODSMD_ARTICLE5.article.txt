# Decoding masculinity
## Q&A ROBB WILLER PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY 
### ANGELA ZHANG 
Robb Wilier is an associate professor of sociology
and the author of research suggesting that men with
higher levels of testosterone are more likely to feel
threatened and act out in the form of masculine over
compensation. The Daily sat down with Wilier to dis
cuss the roots of his interests in masculinity studies,
his stance on the burgeoning field of men's studies
and what trends in male behavior reveal about the
state of the gender.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did you first get
interested in gender studies and sociology?
Robb Wilier (RW): I first became interested in the
area when I took a social psychology class as a junior
in college [Wilier attended the University of lowa for
his undergraduate degree]. Up to that time, I had
been primarily interested in creative writing. I real
ized that the things I found really interesting about
creative writing making observations about socie
ty and human nature were all things that I could do
through social science research.

TSD: How did you develop your current research
interest in masculinity, more specifically?
RW: When I was a graduate student at Cornell
University, I was watching "60 Minutes" one Sunday.
They had on a French psychologist who consults for
the "Big Three" automakers, telling them how to de
sign cars to better satisfy the psychological needs and
motivations of American consumers. And among oth
er things, he said that they tried to design SUVs to
make men feel powerful. As I watched this, it oc
curred to me that you could easily study a related
idea, namely that when men feel insecure about their
masculinity, they're more motivated to buy a SUV
From there, I got interested more generally in the dif
ferent things men might do when they feel threatened
in their masculinity measuring support for war and
homophobia as well. [My] research went from there.

TSD: Masculinity and emasculation are of
ten touchy subjects to address, particularly for
men like yourself. What interests you most about

this subject of male emascula
tion or masculinity in general?
RW: I think that the social psy
chology of masculinity is a really in
teresting subject because norms of
appropriate male behavior are so
strong, but we don't always notice
the extremity of their effects.
When you really start reading re
search on masculinity, you start to
see how... restrictive masculinity
norms are. There are quite specific
expectations for how a man is sup
posed to behave in American cul
ture. These expectations have got
ten looser in recent years, but it's
still a pretty restrictive set of possi
bilities that men are expected to
conform to.

TSD: The idea that men who feel
emasculated act out as a means
of asserting their masculinity
otherwise known as masculinity
overcompensation is a widely
held conception. When you be
gan your research, did you aim to
discover a biological basis for
this notion?

RW: After [performing] the
original study on this subject, a lot
of people asked me what role biol
ogy specifically testosterone
might play in masculinity over
compensation, so I got interested
in that question as well. The
testosterone literature is quite in
teresting, and, after reading it, it
struck me that there were at least
two [means by] which testosterone
might enter into the way men re
spond to masculinity threats.
First, it could be that threats to
masculinity increase men's testos
terone and they behave more mas
culine as a result. Alternatively, it
could be that a man's testosterone
level prior to being threatened de
termines the strength of his re
sponse. We found evidence for the
second of these possibilities. [Men
with higher testosterone] whose
masculinity was threatened had
the strongest responses. And

[men with lower testosterone] did
n't overcompensate at all in our
study after receiving masculinity
threats.

TSD: Aside from confirming the
belief that men with higher
testosterone levels exhibit
greater aggressiveness when
their masculinity is threatened,
what is the greater purpose of
this research?
RW: I think what I would like to
do next is to better understand the
role that masculinity plays in
American political attitudes. It may
be the case that American men ex
perience economic uncertainty and
risk as threats to their masculinity
and that these threats affect their
political attitudes. In particular, it
might be the case that men are
driven to adopt more masculine po
litical attitudes, such as support for
aggressive military action and neg
ative views of homosexuality, when
faced with economic threats and
uncertainty.

This research was meant to test
the idea of masculinity overcom
pensation to identify some of the
effects overcompensation might
have and to better understand the
physiological underpinnings of it.
One of the central ideas in this re
search is that men overcompensate
in the face of threats, but women
for the most part do not. This
prediction comes from theoreti
cal work on gender, which [ar
gues] that expectations for ap
propriate male behavior are
stricter than expectations for
women. For example, it's consid
ered okay, even charming, for
young girls to be "tomboys" but
not okay for young boys to be
have in too feminine away. And
this theoretical work is one of the
reasons we predicted that we
would find masculine but not
feminine overcompensation.

TSD: Aside from confirming
these broadly understood notions
of masculinity overcompensa
tion, have your findings con
firmed or disproved any assump
tions about male behavior?
RW: I think that our results are

generally consistent with academic
theories of gender. For example, we
find support for the idea that ex
pectations for appropriate male be
havior are stricter than expecta
tions for appropriate behavior
among women. However, the re
sults do suggest that male behavior
is likely related to testosterone and
possibly other biological factors.
This is an idea that has not yet been
extensively explored in the social
sciences.

TSD: What other research are
you currently engaged in relat
ing to gender studies?
RW: One project that [my lab
and I are] very interested in now is
a study of Tea Party support in the
contemporary United States. We
found interesting evidence that Tea
Party support amongst white
Americans may be related to their
sense of where white people stand
in society. Similar to the overcom
pensation research, when whites
feel that their social standing is
threatened, they respond with
greater racial prejudice and â€”in
our research greater support
for the Tea Party movement.

TSD: What do you envision as the
future of male and/or gender
studies?

RW: I think right now there are
a lot of interesting trends in the
norms regulating male behavior.
The last 10 or 20 years have seen
significant loosening of expecta
tions. Among other things, we see
that men these days are more
openly concerned with how they
look, how they dress. Men also en
gage in more self-deprecating hu
mor, perhaps behaving in a more
modest, self-effacing way. Men may
also now be more comfortable ex
pressing fears and other emotions
than they once were. In general,
the expectation that men not exhib
it traditionally feminine character
istics appears to be relaxing.
