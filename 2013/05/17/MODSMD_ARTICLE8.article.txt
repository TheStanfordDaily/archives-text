## Getting over sudden-death overtime 
### Sam Fisher 
Is there anything in sports
quite like sudden-death over
time? Something about over
time just grips you. In any mo
ment, the game could end.
Hopes can be crushed, legends made
and dreams fulfilled in a split second
or an hour.

It doesn't even really matter
whether you care about the teams
playing, or the sport they're play
ing, for that matter. The drama and
intensity of overtime can just take
over your life.
This past weekend, I had this
happen while watching the Stan
ford women's water polo NCAA
Tournament final against USC. On
a day when I had to finish an ab
surd amount of homework and
work for The Daily, I found myself
unable to focus. I couldn't stop my
self from watching.
Throughout most of regulation,
I would go back and forth from my
work to the stream of the game. It
was pretty easy. During timeouts,
lulls in the action or breaks be
tween quarters, I could be at least
moderately productive.
But during overtime, I couldn't
do anything. After the soccer-style
first overtime periods ended in a tie
and the game entered sudden
death format, I couldn't even work
during the breaks. Three minutes
wasn't even enough time to digest
what had happened in each succes
sive overtime period.
And Stanford came oh so close
to winning on a few occasions. Sen
ior Olympic gold medalist Melissa
Seidemann hitting the crossbar
was the most notable. All of us in
The Daily's office became en-

tranced, gasping or cheering after
every play.
But we barely know anything
about water polo. To be fair, all of
us care about Stanford, so we did
have a dog in the fight, but it was
n't like my Philadelphia Eagles
were playing in overtime in the Su
per Bowl.
That's when something I
should've realized a while ago be
came very clear to me. Overtime,
and especially sudden-death over
time, is not fun when you care who
wins.

It's simply torture. Think back
to Stanford football's 2011 game
against USC. Having to sit through
three overtime sessions with every
thing on the line almost gave me a
heart attack, and I was only 19.
Someone in my dorm said it best
a few weeks ago. When your team
is playing, blowouts, not close
games, are fun. Sure, it's great to
look back at that 2011 USC game
and think, "Wow, I witnessed one of
the greatest football games of all
time." But until then-sophomore
linebacker A.J. Tarpley fell on Cur
tis McNeal's fumble in the back of
the end zone, it was nothing short
of torture.

But when you don't care who
wins, is there anything better than
overtime? Take the NHL Playoffs,
for example. My Philadelphia Fly
ers didn't make the postseason
did you know teams could actually
miss the playoffs in a sport that
seems to allow everybody join the
party? Watching overtime games
has been awesome. There were
days last week where there were
two overtime games in the same
night. Who could ask for anything
more?

This phenomenon is interesting
but makes sense. I guess I just
don't often try to examine why I

watch sports; I just keep watching
them. But I do think we can learn
something by looking at this differ
ence in the enjoyment of overtime
games.

Sports are fun for two very dif
ferent reasons. On one hand,
sports give you the opportunity to
go all in behind a cause; in many
cases, an entire city will unite be
hind a team. Look at Boston after
the Red Sox broke the Curse of the
Bambino in 2004 or Philadelphia
after the Phillies broke the curse of
William Penn four years later. Win
ning can make boring, everyday
life feel special, fun and exciting
again.

But that's only why we watch
our sports teams. Nuts like myself
spend hours every week watching
teams that we don't even care
about it. Why is that? Part of it is
that we enjoy watching the best
people in the world play the sports
that we care about. But more im
portantly, I think we love drama.
Look at the ratings of the play
offs. As the stakes get higher, in
terest keeps growing. When Stan
ford football won the Pac-12 Cham
pionship Game, one of my friends
from The Daily and KZSU started
bawling with joy. Sports did that.
Isn't that awesome?

But with that passion and dra
ma comes a flip side. Sports can al
so crush hopes and dreams. As a
Philadelphia sports fan, I've seen
that devastating side way more of
ten than the other. And for the joy
of victory to be so immense, the
pain of defeat must be just as
sharp.

I'm okay with that. Just let me
prepare for it.
Don't let it happen in overtime.

floor of the Autzen Stadium press
box rolled up in a ball and sucking
his thumb. Remind Sam of how
awkward that made his KZSU

Is there anything in sports
quite like sudden-death over
time? Something about over
time just grips you. In any mo
ment, the game could end.
Hopes can be crushed, legends made
and dreams fulfilled in a split second
or an hour.

It doesn't even really matter
whether you care about the teams
playing, or the sport they're play
ing, for that matter. The drama and
intensity of overtime can just take
over your life.
This past weekend, I had this
happen while watching the Stan
ford women's water polo NCAA
Tournament final against USC. On
a day when I had to finish an ab
surd amount of homework and
work for The Daily, I found myself
unable to focus. I couldn't stop my
self from watching.
Throughout most of regulation,
I would go back and forth from my
work to the stream of the game. It
was pretty easy. During timeouts,
lulls in the action or breaks be
tween quarters, I could be at least
moderately productive.
But during overtime, I couldn't
do anything. After the soccer-style
first overtime periods ended in a tie
and the game entered sudden
death format, I couldn't even work
during the breaks. Three minutes
wasn't even enough time to digest
what had happened in each succes
sive overtime period.
And Stanford came oh so close
to winning on a few occasions. Sen
ior Olympic gold medalist Melissa
Seidemann hitting the crossbar
was the most notable. All of us in
The Daily's office became en-

tranced, gasping or cheering after
every play.
But we barely know anything
about water polo. To be fair, all of
us care about Stanford, so we did
have a dog in the fight, but it was
n't like my Philadelphia Eagles
were playing in overtime in the Su
per Bowl.
That's when something I
should've realized a while ago be
came very clear to me. Overtime,
and especially sudden-death over
time, is not fun when you care who
wins.

It's simply torture. Think back
to Stanford football's 2011 game
against USC. Having to sit through
three overtime sessions with every
thing on the line almost gave me a
heart attack, and I was only 19.
Someone in my dorm said it best
a few weeks ago. When your team
is playing, blowouts, not close
games, are fun. Sure, it's great to
look back at that 2011 USC game
and think, "Wow, I witnessed one of
the greatest football games of all
time." But until then-sophomore
linebacker A.J. Tarpley fell on Cur
tis McNeal's fumble in the back of
the end zone, it was nothing short
of torture.

But when you don't care who
wins, is there anything better than
overtime? Take the NHL Playoffs,
for example. My Philadelphia Fly
ers didn't make the postseason
did you know teams could actually
miss the playoffs in a sport that
seems to allow everybody join the
party? Watching overtime games
has been awesome. There were
days last week where there were
two overtime games in the same
night. Who could ask for anything
more?

This phenomenon is interesting
but makes sense. I guess I just
don't often try to examine why I

watch sports; I just keep watching
them. But I do think we can learn
something by looking at this differ
ence in the enjoyment of overtime
games.

Sports are fun for two very dif
ferent reasons. On one hand,
sports give you the opportunity to
go all in behind a cause; in many
cases, an entire city will unite be
hind a team. Look at Boston after
the Red Sox broke the Curse of the
Bambino in 2004 or Philadelphia
after the Phillies broke the curse of
William Penn four years later. Win
ning can make boring, everyday
life feel special, fun and exciting
again.

But that's only why we watch
our sports teams. Nuts like myself
spend hours every week watching
teams that we don't even care
about it. Why is that? Part of it is
that we enjoy watching the best
people in the world play the sports
that we care about. But more im
portantly, I think we love drama.
Look at the ratings of the play
offs. As the stakes get higher, in
terest keeps growing. When Stan
ford football won the Pac-12 Cham
pionship Game, one of my friends
from The Daily and KZSU started
bawling with joy. Sports did that.
Isn't that awesome?

But with that passion and dra
ma comes a flip side. Sports can al
so crush hopes and dreams. As a
Philadelphia sports fan, I've seen
that devastating side way more of
ten than the other. And for the joy
of victory to be so immense, the
pain of defeat must be just as
sharp.

I'm okay with that. Just let me
prepare for it.
Don't let it happen in overtime.

floor of the Autzen Stadium press
box rolled up in a ball and sucking
his thumb. Remind Sam of how
awkward that made his KZSU
