# ONE THING TO PLAY FOR
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
There is no way to sugarcoat
Stanford baseball's season, no way
to describe it as anything other
than a resounding disappointment
for a roster overflowing with highly
touted professional prospects. Nei
ther the return of senior ace Mark
Appel, who is on the cusp of setting
the school's strikeout record, nor
the rehab of junior slugger Austin
Wilson, another near-certain first
round pick, has made the Cardinal
a contender in 2013, and with two
weeks to play Stanford (26-20, 11-
13 Pac-12) has been all but eliminat
ed from consideration for a postsea

son berth.
There's only one thing left for
the Cardinal to do.
"I think at this point, we're just
trying to finish strong," said senior
Justin Ringo, whose days playing
college baseball are numbered.
"Hopefully, we can turn it around
this weekend."
When Stanford travels across
the Bay to face Cal (22-28,10-17), it
will carry a six-game losing streak
into Berkeley. That stint has includ
ed consecutive losses to midweek
opponents San Francisco and Santa
Clara and a sweep at the hands of
conference-leading Oregon State
that effectively ended Stanford's
bid for a regional spot.

"Oregon State's a really good
team," Ringo said. "I think they're
better than us. I think they played
better than us. But I think we bat
tled for the most part and it's just
been a tough stretch."
The Bears are just two weeks
removed from being swept by the
Beavers themselves and have won
just four series all season.
At the very least, this has the
potential to be an entertaining ri
valry matchup between two teams
that have nothing else left to play
for. When these two squads met at
Sunken Diamond last season, Cal
won a 5-4 classic on Friday night
that was at once both a thriller
Stanford had a walk-off home run

called back and a snoozefest
the contest lasted 18 innings, six
hours and 569 pitches. The Bears
then came out to dominate the Sat
urday matchup 15-5 to clinch the
series against the demoralized Car
dinal, which did bounce back with a
5-3 win in the finale.
Stanford is once again the fa
vorite in this series, but that says
more about Cal's struggles this sea
son than anything else. The Bears
are one of the lowest-scoring teams
in the Pac-12, with just 4.6 runs per
game, while their 4.55 team ERA is
second worst in the conference.
In contrast to the Cardinal's
seasoned lineup, which includes
veterans such as Ringo, Wilson and
junior first baseman Brian Ragira,
Cal is often forced to start five
freshmen in the field. Junior catch
er Andrew Knapp is by far the
Bears' most prolific hitter, leading
his team in batting average (.353),
RBI (39) and extra-base hits (22),
while centerfielder Devin Pearson
has also impressed by hitting .327
as a freshman.
Cal is also inexperienced on the
mound, with freshman righty Ryan
Mason (5-3) taking the ball on Fri
day night. The Bears have not
named a Sunday starter, a telling
similarity with a Cardinal pitching
staff that, besides Appel, has been
incredibly inconsistent this season.
Appel will try to shake off his
worst stai*t of the year, a 7-3 loss to
the Beavers, in tonight's 7 p.m. se
ries opener. He needs 11 strikeouts
to become Stanford's career leader
in that category.
The series will conclude with a 6
p.m. start on Saturday and a 1 p.m.
matinee on Sunday. After this
weekend, Stanford will host four
straight games to end the season: a
Tuesday matchup with Pacific and a
three-game series against No. 10
UCLA.
"I don't know what's going to
happen over the next seven
games," Ringo said, "but I hope at
the very least we'll have fun and
battle and compete."

Senior ace Mark Appel (above) needs just 11 strikeouts to become Stanford's all-time leader in that
category. Besides his start tonight at Cal, Appel will have one more chance next week to pile up punchouts.
