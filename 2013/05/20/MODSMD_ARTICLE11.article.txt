## Joy vs. Pleasure 
### Alex Bayer 
What if we managed to turn a
blind eye to suffering, let
ourselves fall into an elec
tro trance with the help of some
chemicals? We would no doubt ex
perience something tantamount to
joy. But would it be the same joy
you might feel as you finally kiss the
person you have secretly loved for
two years? Would joy amongst
nightclub strangers be the same joy
experienced amongst your closest
friends in the same nightclub? I say
there are different degrees of joy,
and the more hard-earned a mo
ment of joy, the more expansive and
blissful it is. Zadie Smith writes a
great essay on the difference be
tween pleasure and joy. Pleasure
can be found quite easily: in a sensa
tion of warmth, a cookie, a hug. I
would say "living mindfully" or "in
the moment" is a matter of turning
insignificant moments into a series
of pleasures.
My own experience tells me that
joy is much harder to capture. It ar
rives rarely, unexpectedly, and it is
the product, perhaps, of many pleas

urable threads coalescing at once.
So the point is: joy is a build-up. I
still remember, distinctly, a rush of
joy as I walked into the Sydney air
port after a three-week student trip
in Australia. Why joy? It was the
sum of many parts: perhaps the
thought of dancing with my tween
crush last night, the the feeling of
being abroad, the wildly promising
knowledge that there was a world,
full of hope and novelty, beyond the
iron bars of middle school.
But such joy would only be pos
sible if I knew what it was like to
hate middle school repression, for
there would be no bliss in encoun
tering a free world's possibilities if
in fact I had no concept of an insu
lar, repressed one. Likewise, there
would be far less bliss in dancing
with the boy I liked if it were not
preceded by two weeks of stifled,
unspoken attraction and far less
bliss if in fact I had never previous
ly known the sting of not being liked
back. Does a child, who has no con
cept of pain, experience never-end
ing joy throughout childhood? I cer-

tainly was happy as a child, but hap
piness, like pleasure, can exist with
out ever having suffered. Joy is joy
because it is earned; to get there,
you've got to know its antithesis. To
revel in being loved, you must know
how it feels to be rejected. To stand
on stage with an Oscar in your hand
and feel pure elation, you've got to
know what it feels like to feel un
worthy and untalented. Depression,
darkness these make the reverse
proportionally more elevating. Thus
one can never experience the
heights of joy without venturing in
to the depths of misery.
But all this is easier said than
done. When you're down in the
dumps, you wonder if the few and
fleeting moments of bliss make it
worth it. But let's return to the
dance floor, where joy, it seems,
flows to no end. But the catch is
this: We mistake what is actually a
monotonous stream of pleasure for
a joy. A stream of pleasure is very
different. If you think of joy and de
pression as the opposite spectrums
of a pendulum, I would even argue
that constant, static pleasure pre
cludes the chance of achieving joy.
Callicles and Nietzsche may re
fute me. A life of ongoing hollow
pleasure, he may say, is better than
a life of sorrowful contemplation
sprinkled with but a few moments
of joy. I would still take the second
option, and though some may not, I
imagine most people would do the
same as me. This pursuit of joy, I
would even hypothesize, is what
moves us. For why else would we
allow ourselves to fall in love, know
ing full well that more than likely
there is a horrible break-up at the
end, that the person you love most
may wind up being a perfect
stranger? Who would take this risk
if not promised those moments of
unequaled joy found only in mutual
love? Who on earth would climb
Mount Everest, expose oneself to
ungodly wind-chill, potentially lose
a limb to frostbite (or else fall off a
cliff), if it weren't for that moment
of joy at the summit? At any mo
ment, we could reach for immediate
pleasure (sex, drugs, donuts), but
human history shows that we vol
untarily suffer and endure because
we know that the light at the end of
the tunnel possesses a pleasure of a
different species, fantastic enough
to justify all the suffering that came
before it.

there is a horrible break-up at the
end, that the person you love most
may wind up being a perfect
stranger? Who would take this risk
if not promised those moments of
unequaled joy found only in mutual
love? Who on earth would climb
Mount Everest, expose oneself to
ungodly wind-chill, potentially lose
a limb to frostbite (or else fall off a
cliff), if it weren't for that moment
of joy at the summit? At any mo
ment, we could reach for immediate
pleasure (sex, drugs, donuts), but
human history shows that we vol
untarily suffer and endure because
we know that the light at the end of
the tunnel possesses a pleasure of a
different species, fantastic enough
to justify all the suffering that came
before it.
