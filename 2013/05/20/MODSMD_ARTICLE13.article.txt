## Who knows what the future holds 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
Last year, the Oklahoma
City Thunder played its
guts out all season long.
Led by Kevin Durant's su
perfluous scoring, Russell
Westbrook's manic energy and James
Harden's facial hair, the Thunder took
the Miami Heat to the limit, eventual
ly losing the NBA finals in five games
to the loaded and star-studded dream
team. It was a huge relief for the Heat,
but most importantly for Leßron
James, who got the veritable monkey
off his back and also managed to make
his "not one, not two, not three..."
prediction not only plausible, but prob
able.
The lasting image for me, however,
was not Leßroris shiny receding hair
line reflecting off the Larry O'Brien
trophy but a poignant moment that
just preceded the presentation. When
Game 5 got out of hand, Thunder
coach Scott Brooks pulled his starters
out and inserted the corpses at the end
of his bench. But during a TV timeout,
he shared a long and meaningful em
brace with the Thunder's would-be
Big Three: Durant, Westbrook and
Harden. In that moment, I thought
anything was possible for this team.
Well, we all know what happened
in the offseason: The Thunder traded
Harden, knowing that they couldn't
afford to keep him and Serge Ibaka at
the same time and deeming Ibaka
more necessary to the team's survival.
The move seemed to work out for both
the Thunder and the Houston Rock
ets, who gladly took Harden for a rel
ative pittance of expiring contracts
and gunner Kevin Martin.
But in the playoffs, when Russell
Westbrook got hurt for pretty much
the first time in his entire fife, the
Thunder stagnated. Durant had to re
sort to hero ball from the opening tip
until the final horn and critics across
the nation lampooned the OKC front
office's "foolish decision" to trade a
would-be superstar entering his prime.
However; this decision is a perfect
case of a no-win situation. The Thunder,
by virtue of its visibility, would be
damned if it made any moves and
damned if it didn't. Harden would get
his money at the cost of any financial
flexibility the Thunder would let him
walk for nothing or the front office
would trade him for pennies on the dol
lar. There was no way for GM Sam
Presti to do anything without getting
blasted.
Fast-forward to today and many
playoff teams find themselves in simi
lar positions: quite pleased with their
young cores, but unable to guarantee
themselves contender status without
making some unpopular moves.
The Memphis Grizzlies jettisoned
Rudy Gay and now see themselves in
the Western Conference finals. Con
versely, the Los Angeles Clippers
stood pat and now stand the risk of los
ing Chris Paul in free agency
The Chicago Bulls continue to wait
for their messiah, Derrick Rose, to get
healthy and guide them to the prom
ised land. On the flip side, the Boston
Celtics are stuck between a rock and a
hard place with franchise corner
stones Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett
entering the twilights of their careers
and a young cohort of talent, led by the
enigmatic Rajon Rondo, the explosive
Jeff Green and the gritty Avery
Bradley, waiting in the wings for op
portunities.
The Denver Nuggets stood pat af
ter their' moves to acquire Andre Iguo
dala last season and eventually lost a
wild series to the Golden State War
riors. Those same Warriors eventually
got wrecked by the evergreen San An
tonio Spurs and now face questions
about the financial viability and con
tender status of the team as it is construct
ed today Shockingly these questions are
only for playoff teams; elsewhere, the Los
Angeles Lakers are so high over the luxu
ry tax line that the penalties associated
with their' high cap number could prob
ably cure world hunger—and they
didn't even make the playoffs (I will
take this God-given opportunity to tell
Lakers fans to suck it).
The message, then, is that con
structing an NBA team involves a ton
of luck, even if you exclusively make
smart moves. For all the aforemen
tioned teams, the offseason looks to be
a place both scary and full of promise.
As the saying goes, hindsight is 20-20,
which is undoubtedly true.
When it comes to NBA roster deci
sions, however, foresight is clinically
blind. Bear that in mind the next time
you get after your team's front office.
Who really knows what the future
holds?
