# END OF THE ROAD
## MEN'S GOLF FALTERS IN FINAL ROUND AT REGIONALS 
### CAMERON MILLLER STAFF WRITER 
Despite starting off the tourna
ment in strong fashion and main
taining a top-five position going into
Saturday's final round, the No. 10
Stanford men's golf team saw its
season come to a disappointing fin
ish at the NCAA Columbus Region
al. It is the second time in three
years that the Cardinal has failed to
qualify for the NCAA Champi
onships. In an event where the top
five teams advanced to the Big
Dance, Stanford claimed third place
after round one and were in a tie for
third going into Saturday. However,
the team faded with a 14-over 298
performance in the third round,
falling into seventh place and five
strokes out of fifth.

"This season was largely disap
pointing," junior Cameron Wilson
said. "On paper we were as good as
any team in the country, but we
struggled to gain momentum and
have more than two guys playing
well at a time. Still, I greatly en
joyed the journey and experiences I
had with my coaches and team
mates. All of that will comprise my
memories of the year rather than
this poor ending."
Things looked promising for the
Cardinal after Thursday's first
round. Seeking a solid start that had
eluded them at the Pac-12 Champi
onships, the team opened the tour
nament with a 7-over 291 score, put
ting them in third behind No. 23
South Carolina and surprise leader
No. 68 Charlotte. The scores were
tight, though, with the Cardinal on-

ly three strokes ahead of the non
advancing sixth position.
Friday's second round saw Stan
ford shoot four strokes higher than
the previous day and slip into a tie
for third with No. 19 Auburn. By
now, there was an eight shot gap be
tween being tied for fifth and sev
enth, but the top six teams were
separated by a mere three strokes.
Charlotte dropped precipitously
from first into a tie for eighth and
No. 5 New Mexico, the highest
ranked team in the tournament, be
came tied for fifth, one shot behind
the Cardinal.
With essentially six teams vying
for five spots, Stanford had little
margin for error on Saturday and,
unfortunately, things unraveled
quickly. The team made the turn a
6-over and things only got worse

from there. Junior Cameron Wilson
usually steady and consistent
shot a highly uncharacteristic 7-
over 78, going 5-over on his back
nine. That performance dropped
him from T-lOth to T-34th, with
teammate Patrick Rodgers experi
encing a similar tumble. The sopho
more, who tied for ninth at last
year's NCAA Championship posted
a 5-over 76 on Saturday, falling from
tied for sixth to T-18th. Senior Steve
Kearney and freshman David Boote
struggled as well, combining to
shoot 10-over.
Senior Andrew Yun was the only
Cardinal golfer to break par on Sat
urday, the team's only subpar round
of the tournament besides Wilson's
l-under 70 opener. But Yun's 2-

In the last tournament of his Stanford career, senior Andrew Yun (above), a two time All-American, broke par on Saturday with a 1-under 70
and 2-birdie performance, but only managed to finish in a tie for 25th place due to his 10-over combined score in the first two rounds of play.
