### CAMERON MILLER 
Hey all, my name is
Cameron Miller
and I'm a fresh
man distance run
ner on our cross country and
track and field teams here
at Stanford. I'll be writing
daily practice updates this
week, previewing the up
coming NCAA West Re
gional and hopefully show
ing you guys a behind-the
scenes look at our program.
May is when NCAA
track and field action really
starts to heat up. Confer
ence championships are
usually held in the begin
ning of the month, followed
a few weeks later by the two
regionals. After last week's
Pac-12 meet, our team has
35 athletes (22 female, 13
male) heading to Austin,
Tex. later this week to com
pete in the West Regional.
Headlining the male contin
gent are milers junior Mike
Atchoo and senior Tyler
Stutzman, who will compete
in the 1500 m prelims on
Thursday with the hopes of
advancing to Saturday's fi
nal. Mike and Stutz (never
call him Tyler) form the top
middle-distance duo in the
nation and coach Milt is
confident they'll be on the
podium in Eugene, Ore. at
NCAAs.
While Stutz has been
feeling a little under the
weather, it was just Mike
who joined the rest of the
team for our usual Satur
day long run, starting at
the infamous Alpine Inn.
For the guys going to re
gionals this week, their
long runs were cut back to

around
60 or 70 minutes. The
freshmen still training for
US Junior Championships
this summer went a bit
longer, running 80 to 90 min
utes. I ran with classmates
Thomas Graham and Garrett
Sweatt, discovering an awe
some trail system behind
Corte Madera School in Por
tola Valley. That afforded us
some great views of the
south bay.
When we got back from
Alpine, Saturday morning
practice was in full swing. I
could see world-class hur
dler junior Kori Carter do
ing some drills on a speed
ladder and high jumpers
Jules Sharpe and Dartis
Willis doing some starts and
approaches. The distance
runners have Sunday off,
but the throwers had an af
ternoon session that includ
ed team captain senior Ge
off Tabor. Geoff's "GET
IN" mantra has been the
theme of our team's weight
room workouts this year.
Tomorrow I'll talk more
about our women's team, in
cluding 800-meter stars sen
ior Justine Fedronic and
freshman Amy Weissenbach
and javelin thrower sopho
more Brianna Bain. I'll also
try to get into coach Milt's
first year on the Farm, his
long-term approach and
how he's enacted his own
cultural revolution on Stan
ford's track and field and
cross country teams.
