## Card's postseason hopes rekindled 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
After a crushing six-game losing
streak, with five of them coming at
Sunken Diamond, Stanford found life
again on the road. The Cardinal out hit
the Golden Bears to sweep Cal in
Berkeley, mounting a late-season
charge in the hopes of a postseason
berth.

On Friday night, senior starting
pitcher Mark Appel tied the Stanford
career strikeouts record en route to a
9-8 victory in his final start against the
Cardinal's cross-Bay rival.
Appel came into Friday night's
game needing 11 strikeouts to tie the
record of 363 career strikeouts shared
by Kyle Peterson '9B and Justin Wayne
'Ol. Though Appel was hit around at
times Cal managed four earned
runs on nine hits in seven innings off
the senior ace the big righty did
enough to pick up 11 strikeouts and,
more importantly, the victory.
Though the record has not been on
Appel's mind until a few weeks ago,
one of his teammates, senior relief
pitcher Sahil Bloom, reminded Appel
before the game exactly what his game
plan should be.
"Sahil, he's big onto the stats and
everything," Appel said. "He came out
to me and was like, 'What you want to
do is you want to get 11 strikeouts
here so you can set the record at home
next week.' But obviously, I wasn't re
ally thinking about it during the
game."
Appel's effort might have been for
naught if it were not for the strong
performance from a fellow Houston
native, sophomore left fielder Wayne

Taylor. Taylor knocked in three runs
on two opposite field homers, his sec
ond and third of the season, to lead
Stanford's strong offensive charge.
Junior catcher Brant Whiting and
junior first baseman Brian Ragira also
added three hits a piece for the Cardi
nal, scoring two runs and picking up
two RBI combined.
The lead almost slipped away in the
ninth inning due to some shaky pitch
ing and defense. With senior relief
pitcher Garrett Hughes on the mound,
Cal put runners on second and third
on a single and two errors. A single, a
walk and a passed ball scored two runs
and put the tying runs in scoring posi
tion with nobody out.
But that's when Hughes buckled
down.
After inducing a groundout that
put the tying run on third base with
one out, Hughes got a big strikeout
and then a fly out to right field to seal
the victory.
Saturday's game had a lot less dra
ma. Stanford scored three runs on
three hits and two walks in the top of
the first inning and never gave up the
lead on its way to a 9-4 victory.
Freshman reliever Logan James
picked up the victory with 4.2 very
strong innings in relief of sophomore
starter John Hochstatter. James al
lowed only one run on four hits while
striking out five to finish off the Bears.
On the offensive side, a very bal
anced effort led to a second-straight
nine-run performance. Ragira and
Taylor again picked up two hits, but so
did sophomore rightfielder Austin
Slater, junior second baseman Danny
Diekroeger and sophomore third
baseman Alex Blandino. Whiting did
his part again as well, walking three
times and scoring twice.
Sunday's 7-3 victory came from an
other balanced effort, aided by both
