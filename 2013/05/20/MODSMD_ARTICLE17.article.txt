# Revival complete, Frost experience flourishes
## 
### MADDY SIDES 
On a warm Saturday afternoon, MGMT laid down mellow vibes in Frost Am
phitheater for a couple of hours as concertgoers enjoyed the sun, wandered the
grassy slopes and swayed along to the music. Student-initiated art installations
ranging from a flower-covered driftwood statue of a woman to interactive spin
art bikes to a performance art piece inspired by LSD and the 70s added to the
Frost experience and gave students a chance to influence the concertgoehs ex
periences in creative and funky ways. While some found MGMT's performance
to be somewhat uninspired, dancing and engaging concert vibes broke out in
pockets of the crowd. And at the end of the day, The Youth at Frost walked away
from the stage having enjoyed a peaceful day in the sun with friends.
