### SAMANTHA NEUBER 
Fossil Free Stanford, the Stan
ford chapter of a national Fossil Free
movement, has launched a campus
wide initiative to urge the University
to divest from fossil fuels.
The group aims to convince Uni
versity officials to freeze all new fos
sil fuel investments and to fully di
vest from the 200 largest publicly
traded fossil fuel companies within
the next five years.
Fossil Free Stanford was formed
at the end of fall quarter after Bill
McKibben, a co-founder of the in
ternational climate campaign
350.0rg, visited Palo Alto on his "Do
the Math" tour. According to
Michael Penuelas 'l5, a member of
Fossil Free Stanford, the event in
spired students to found their own
divestment campaign.
"This is our tuition money and
our professors' pension money...
and our school's endowment is go
ing to support industries that are
polluting our future," said Fossil
Free Stanford member Yari Gre
aney 'l5. "Divesting is something
we can do as an institution and real
ly make a statement."
Communications with the APIRL
Greaney and other members of
the group have been communicat
ing since February with Stanford's
Advisory Panel on Investment Re
sponsibility and Licensing (APIRL),
the body that advises President
John Hennessy and the Board of
Trustees on ethnical issues sur
rounding University endowment in
vestments.
