## Group urges fossil fuel divestment Fossil Free Stanford calls for University to review investments 
### SAMANTHA NEUBER 
Fossil Free Stanford, the Stan
ford chapter of a national Fossil Free
movement, has launched a campus
wide initiative to urge the University
to divest from fossil fuels.
The group aims to convince Uni
versity officials to freeze all new fos
sil fuel investments and to fully di
vest from the 200 largest publicly
traded fossil fuel companies within
the next five years.
Fossil Free Stanford was formed
at the end of fall quarter after Bill
McKibben, a co-founder of the in
ternational climate campaign
350.0rg, visited Palo Alto on his "Do
the Math" tour. According to
Michael Penuelas 'l5, a member of
Fossil Free Stanford, the event in
spired students to found their own
divestment campaign.
"This is our tuition money and
our professors' pension money...
and our school's endowment is go
ing to support industries that are
polluting our future," said Fossil
Free Stanford member Yari Gre
aney 'l5. "Divesting is something
we can do as an institution and real
ly make a statement."
Communications with the APIRL
Greaney and other members of
the group have been communicat
ing since February with Stanford's
Advisory Panel on Investment Re
sponsibility and Licensing (APIRL),
the body that advises President
John Hennessy and the Board of
Trustees on ethnical issues sur
rounding University endowment in
vestments.
According to APIRL
Staff Liaison Kathleen
Greenan, the purpose of the
APIRL is to provide "a fo
rum for the Stanford com
munity to voice its concerns
about the social and environ
mental impacts of Stanford's
investment and trademark li
censing activities."
While a variety of divest
ment campaigns have been
presented to the APIRL, on
ly three have been success
ful. Stanford divested from
several companies with oper
ations in apartheid South
Africa in 1977 and divested
from major tobacco compa
nies in 1998. In 2005, Stan
ford divested from four com
panies that supported the
Sudanese government.
"In each case, the action
was based on fiduciary obli
gations and clear ethical
principles which were widely
held across the entire Stan
ford community," Greenan
wrote in a statement to The
Daily.
Fossil Free Stanford
members made a presenta
tion to the APIREs Environ
mental Sustainability Sub
committee in March, and
they submitted an official re
quest for the review of in
vestments on May 8.

Sophie Harrison 'l6, a
member of Fossil Free Stan
ford, said that there was "a
lot of respect" in the APIREs
response to the group's pres
entation. Harrison noted
that group members are now
focused on "making sure [the
APIRL] can fully under
stand the urgency of the situ
ation" and recognize the
group's broad support base.
Though Greenan said
that APIREs 2012-2013 ses
sion has ended, she expects
further communication with
Fossil Free Stanford next
year.
"We look forward to
working with the group into
the fall as they prepare for a
presentation to the full pan
el," Greenan said in a state
ment.
Campus-wide efforts
In addition to submitting
its official proposal for di
vestment, Fossil Free Stan
ford has held several events
and started an online petition
to rally support from the
Stanford community and
make students more aware
of the divestment movement.
The petition recently
reached 1,045 signatures,
and group members held a
1,000 signature celebration
in front of President Hen
nessy's office on May 17.
Fossil Free Stanford has
also been in contact with sim
ilar groups at a number of
schools across the country

and in the Bay Area such as
UC Berkeley, UC San Fran
cisco and San Francisco
State University.
According to Harrison,
300 schools across the coun
try have active fossil fuel di
vestment campaigns and 11
cities have committed to di
vestment.
"It's a national movement
... part of what makes this so
powerful is that there are
students across the country
working on this," Harrison
said. "It comes down to the
fact that by continuing to live
our lifestyles with a depend
ence on fossil fuels, we are
condemning future genera
tions to a world that is not as
good as the one we have
right now."
The group is working to
gain more signatures on the
petition, conduct a year-end
review and strengthen the
argument presented to the
APIRL by compiling re
search on the necessity of di
vestment.
Group members also
hope to foster more faculty
and alumni support and in
volvement, and they may
create a video featuring pro
fessors speaking about the
importance of divestment
from fossil fuels.
"We're all very passionate
about this, and we're not go
ing away," Penuelas said.
