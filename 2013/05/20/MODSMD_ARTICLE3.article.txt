# MGMT headlines Frost concert
## Music festival meets with mixed reviews 
### DOMINICA WAMBOLD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Headliners MGMT filled Laurence Frost
Amphitheatre on Saturday afternoon with
more than 5,000 students and guests, but never
performed high school hit "Kids," their most fa
mous song.
"It was such a good crowd, and the arts [ex
hibits] were super cool," said concertgoer Uche
Üba 'l5. "The actual performance was a bit of a
letdown. It wasn't like the MGMT songs that
we listen to and enjoy. It was slightly annoying
that we paid $l9 to not have 'Kids' performed."

Stanford Concert Network (SCN) revived
the Frost Music and Arts Festival last year af
ter a hiatus lasting almost three decades. The
venue had previously hosted artists like Grate
ful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Santana and the
San Francisco Symphony throughout the '7os
and 'Bos, a legacy that served to inspire the am
phitheatre's return.
"We were trying to revive it to its glory
days, when Stanford encouraged a lot more
freedom of expression and music on campus,"
said Alberto Aroeste 'l3, SCN's creative direc
tor. "It took selling out the capacity of Frost
around 5,000 [people] to get the event to

happen"
The festival returned around $90,000 in
profit this year, which was driven by revenues
from 5,000 advance ticket sales and another 100
sold on the day of the show. General admission
tickets sold for $4O and student tickets were
subsidized to $2O.
"We didn't sell out last year [for Modest
Mouse,] but we sold out about a week early this
year," Aroeste said. "That really shows that
there's a growing demand for stuff like this at
Stanford."

Approximately 5,000 students and guests attended the Frost Music and Arts Festival on May 18 at the Laurence Frost Ampitheatre. The
concert, which generated around $90,000 in profits, was hosted by the Stanford Concert Network and featured headliner MGMT.
According to Haley
Sayres 'l4, co-director of
Frost Revival, the vast ma
jority of costs came from put
ting on an event of that scale.
"Booking MGMT was
about $100,000," she said.
"Security, production and the
cost of the infrastructure for
Frost Amphitheatre cost us
maybe another $100,000."
Food trucks and mer
chandise were available out
side the venue, but an organi
zational hitch stopped the
sale of Frost-specific mer
chandise.
"The food trucks come in
for free and keep the money
they make," Sayres said.
"MGMT had their own mer
chandise that they were sell
ing, but we were unable to
sell Frost shirts with our de
sign this year because we
didn't get it approved in
time."
Sayres said that she
hopes to use the profit from
this year's event towards
putting on a future event that
mimics the atmosphere of
music festivals.
"We'll have more money
for next year, so we're hoping
to book a more popular band
for the opening band to make
the line-up more even so it's
more of a festival feel," she
said. "We're also going to ex
pand the art, and hopefully
have more pieces."
Event security was fairly
tight, with Stanford Univer
sity Department of Public
Safety officers checking
bags and refusing to admit
any opened drinks. Security
refused to return bottles
and canteens to guests after
the event.
"I thought it was a bit
ridiculous that you couldn't
bring any drinks in at all,"
said Ross Thorburn 'l5. "I
had just bought mine at the
vendors they could have
smell tested it or something
instead of flat out refusing
to let it in."
Art was a major feature
of this year's efforts to in
crease the event's festival
atmosphere. There were 17
installations in total, includ
ing two by professional
artist Michael Christian,
whose work has been fea
tured at acclaimed festivals
like the Coachella Valley
Music and Arts festival.
"Christian does Burning
Man, Coachella [and] he's
working on a project for
[electronic music festival]
EDC right now," Aroeste
said. "It's taken us all quar
ter to build [the art for
Frost.]"
Aroeste emphasized the
commitment to integrating
the art into the Frost expe

rience.
"Last year we kind of
kickstarted the art move
ment — we had very little
money and only five proj
ects," he explained. "This
year, we wanted to create a
movement where we were
highlighting art on campus
student art so doing
that at Frost became a pri
ority for every group we

talked to."
The added emphasis on
arts was well received.
"A lot of people did seem
to really enjoy it," Thorburn
said, describing the art exhi
bitions as well integrated
and popular. "The face paint
ing and sculptures were a
very good addition."
Aroeste expressed opti
mism about Frost's ability to

enjoy continued growth ir
the future.
"Now that I'm a senior
I'm thinking ahead," he said
"When we're all alumni, 1
definitely want to have
events to come back to thai
will get everyone back to
gether."
