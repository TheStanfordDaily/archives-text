# MGMT headlines Frost concert
## Music festival meets with mixed reviews

Headliners MGMT filled Laurence Frost
Amphitheatre on Saturday afternoon with
more than 5,000 students and guests, but never
performed high school hit "Kids," their most fa
mous song.
"It was such a good crowd, and the arts [ex
hibits] were super cool," said concertgoer Uche
Ãœba 'l5. "The actual performance was a bit of a
letdown. It wasn't like the MGMT songs that
we listen to and enjoy. It was slightly annoying
that we paid $l9 to not have 'Kids' performed."

Stanford Concert Network (SCN) revived
the Frost Music and Arts Festival last year af
ter a hiatus lasting almost three decades. The
venue had previously hosted artists like Grate
ful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Santana and the
San Francisco Symphony throughout the '7os
and 'Bos, a legacy that served to inspire the am
phitheatre's return.
"We were trying to revive it to its glory
days, when Stanford encouraged a lot more
freedom of expression and music on campus,"
said Alberto Aroeste 'l3, SCN's creative direc
tor. "It took selling out the capacity of Frost
around 5,000 [people] to get the event to

happen"
The festival returned around $90,000 in
profit this year, which was driven by revenues
from 5,000 advance ticket sales and another 100
sold on the day of the show. General admission
tickets sold for $4O and student tickets were
subsidized to $2O.
"We didn't sell out last year [for Modest
Mouse,] but we sold out about a week early this
year," Aroeste said. "That really shows that
there's a growing demand for stuff like this at
Stanford."
