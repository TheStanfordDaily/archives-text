## No. 12 Cardinal upsets USC and Georgia to clinch a spot in the NCAA semifinals 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis
team entered this year's NCAA
Tournament without much fan
fare. Seeded No. 12, expecta
tions weren't as high for the
tight-knit squad of eight girls as
they have been in recent years.

But the Cardinal has proved
everyone wrong with its per
formance thus far in the tourna
ment. This weekend, Stanford
knocked out two top five seeded
teams in its quest for a national
title. The first victim was No. 5
USC, whom the Cardinal (20-4,
8-2 Pac-12) outlasted 4-3 in a
five-hour marathon Friday
night. The second casualty was
No. 4 Georgia, who Stanford dis
patched 4-1 in the quarterfinal
matchup on Sunday.
Going into the tournament,
Stanford would rather have not
had to face the Trojans (23-3, 9-
0 Pac-12) in the Round of 16. Not
only did they eliminate the Car
dinal from last year's postsea
son in the quarterfinals, but
they also crushed Stanford 6-1
in this year's regular season
matchup.
The Cardinal came out
strong though, capturing the
doubles point with a huge victo
ry from the team's No. 1 pairing
of co-captain juniors Nicole

Gibbs and Kristie Ahn. They
came back from a 4-1 deficit to
defeat Kaitlyn Christian and
Sabrina Santamaria 9-8 (2),
handing USC's top duo its first
doubles loss this season. Senior
co-captain Natalie Dillon and
freshman Krista Hardebeck
then secured the doubles point
with an 8-1 victory over Gabriel
la DeSimone and Danielle Lao.
Gibbs came out strong for
the Cardinal in singles, register
ing a win over Santamaria 7-6
(3), 6-2 on court one. It was just
under two months ago that
Gibbs fell to Santamaria 6-1,6-4,
and her fate almost seemed to
be taking the same form this
time around. In the first set she
went down 5-1, only to come
back and win the tiebreaker.
Gibbs went on to cruise through
the second set.
The Cardinal also registered
a singles victory from senior
Stacey Tan, who defeated Giu
liana Olmos 6-2, 6-2. The Cardi
nal's three singles losses came
from Ahn on court two, who fell
to Lao 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, Hardebeck
on court three, who lost to Zoe
Scandalis 3-6, 6-7 (5) and Dillon
on court six, who stumbled 3-6,
1-6 against Christian.
With the score tied at 3-3, it
all came down to sophomore
Ellen Tsay. Tsay lost the first set
and trailed 3-0 in the second set,
but she would claw her way
back, outlasting DeSimone in a
hard fought battle to capture a 5-
7, 7-5, 6-3 win.

Sophomore Ellen Tsay (above) won the final singles point to clinch the
Sweet Sixteen victory over USC. The Card faces Florida today in the semifinals.
"I tried not to think about the
overall score and tried to concen
trate on my own court and my own
game," Tsay said. "I kept fighting
and took it one point at a time. I
knew it would be a really good boost
to get my match to a third set."
Despite the ringing of loud
cheers from USC fans behind her,
Tsay was able to remain focused on
her shots, not the stakes at hand.
"I thought I did a good job of
keeping it together and not thinking
too much about the circumstances,"
she said. "I only had one double
fault, which went a long way in help
ing to calm my nerves, knowing I
had a second serve to rely on. There
were a lot of shots I thought I would
have hit better in practice or could
have done a better job of putting
away, but I just focused on staying
solid."
The third set was tied at 3-3 be
fore Tsay breezed through three
straight games to capture the victo
ry and send her team to the quar
terfinal round.
"The last game was fun because
I could tell that [DeSimone] was
breaking down," she said. "She
missed a couple returns and hit one
over the fence, and I was pretty ex

cited that I could see the end draw
ing near. We were all smiling, and
when I finally won, my teammates
rushed onto the court to hug me. It
was definitely my favorite moment
so far in my time here."
The Cardinal players were re
warded with only one day of rest be
fore they faced SEC co-champion
Georgia (24-4, 12-1 SEC). They
spent that day fine tuning their indi
vidual games.
"We had a pretty targeted prac
tice," Tsay said. "[Gibbs] worked on
groundstrokes and side to sides,
and I worked on staying low to the
ground. We all worked on the
things we needed to execute the
game plan."
Practice paid off, as the Cardi
nal cruised past one of the nation's
toughest teams to capture a 4-1 vic
tory. After losing the doubles point,
the singles lineup stormed back to
cash in four straight victories.
The first point came from Ahn,
who crushed Maho Kowase 6-0,6-1
on court two. It was Tsay again
who delivered a win over her fellow
northern Californian Ayaka
Okuno, 6-1, 6-2 to put Stanford up
2-1. Tan beat Kate Fuller 6-4,7-5 on
court four and Hardebeck deliv
ered the final blow to Silvia Garcia,
coming back after losing her first
set to seize a 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 victory.
Hardebeck's victory over a fellow
rookie marked her first postseason
career win.

Her clincher also propels Stan
ford to the semifinals of the tourna
ment, making the Cardinal the low
est-seeded team to make it that far
since No. 12 UCLA did it in 2007.
Stanford will face red-hot No. 1
Florida (26-2, 12-1 SEC) on Mon
day in a highly anticipated
matchup. The Cardinal lost to the
Gators in February 4-2 but hopes
to use its recent momentum to pull
off yet another upset.
The Card pulled off a 4-3 win
over the Gators in the 2010 NCAA
Championship game, but Florida
returned the favor a year later, de
feating Stanford 4-3 in the finals to
clinch the 2011 national champi
onship.
Stanford has extra incentive to
beat Florida today as two Stanford
Athletics streaks are on the line.
Stanford has yet to win an NCAA
title this year, after earning at least
one for the past 36 years. Stanford
has also won the Directors' Cup for
the past 18 consecutive years. If
the Card fails to win this match, the
Directors' Cup awarded to the
best collegiate athletics program in
the nation could go to Florida.
The matchup between two of
the nation's most storied programs
begins today at 3 p.m. PST, with
the winner moving on to the nation
al championship.

in this year's regular season
matchup.
The Cardinal came out
strong though, capturing the
doubles point with a huge victo
ry from the team's No. 1 pairing
of co-captain juniors Nicole

Gibbs and Kristie Ahn. They
came back from a 4-1 deficit to
defeat Kaitlyn Christian and
Sabrina Santamaria 9-8 (2),
handing USC's top duo its first
doubles loss this season. Senior
co-captain Natalie Dillon and
freshman Krista Hardebeck
then secured the doubles point
with an 8-1 victory over Gabriel
la DeSimone and Danielle Lao.
Gibbs came out strong for
the Cardinal in singles, register
ing a win over Santamaria 7-6
(3), 6-2 on court one. It was just
under two months ago that
Gibbs fell to Santamaria 6-1,6-4,
and her fate almost seemed to
be taking the same form this
time around. In the first set she
went down 5-1, only to come
back and win the tiebreaker.
Gibbs went on to cruise through
the second set.
The Cardinal also registered
a singles victory from senior
Stacey Tan, who defeated Giu
liana Olmos 6-2, 6-2. The Cardi
nal's three singles losses came
from Ahn on court two, who fell
to Lao 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, Hardebeck
on court three, who lost to Zoe
Scandalis 3-6, 6-7 (5) and Dillon
on court six, who stumbled 3-6,
1-6 against Christian.
With the score tied at 3-3, it
all came down to sophomore
Ellen Tsay. Tsay lost the first set
and trailed 3-0 in the second set,
but she would claw her way
back, outlasting DeSimone in a
hard fought battle to capture a 5-
7, 7-5, 6-3 win.

Sophomore Ellen Tsay (above) won the final singles point to clinch the
Sweet Sixteen victory over USC. The Card faces Florida today in the semifinals.
"I tried not to think about the
overall score and tried to concen
trate on my own court and my own
game," Tsay said. "I kept fighting
and took it one point at a time. I
knew it would be a really good boost
to get my match to a third set."
Despite the ringing of loud
cheers from USC fans behind her,
Tsay was able to remain focused on
her shots, not the stakes at hand.
"I thought I did a good job of
keeping it together and not thinking
too much about the circumstances,"
she said. "I only had one double
fault, which went a long way in help
ing to calm my nerves, knowing I
had a second serve to rely on. There
were a lot of shots I thought I would
have hit better in practice or could
have done a better job of putting
away, but I just focused on staying
solid."
The third set was tied at 3-3 be
fore Tsay breezed through three
straight games to capture the victo
ry and send her team to the quar
terfinal round.
"The last game was fun because
I could tell that [DeSimone] was
breaking down," she said. "She
missed a couple returns and hit one
over the fence, and I was pretty ex

cited that I could see the end draw
ing near. We were all smiling, and
when I finally won, my teammates
rushed onto the court to hug me. It
was definitely my favorite moment
so far in my time here."
The Cardinal players were re
warded with only one day of rest be
fore they faced SEC co-champion
Georgia (24-4, 12-1 SEC). They
spent that day fine tuning their indi
vidual games.
"We had a pretty targeted prac
tice," Tsay said. "[Gibbs] worked on
groundstrokes and side to sides,
and I worked on staying low to the
ground. We all worked on the
things we needed to execute the
game plan."
Practice paid off, as the Cardi
nal cruised past one of the nation's
toughest teams to capture a 4-1 vic
tory. After losing the doubles point,
the singles lineup stormed back to
cash in four straight victories.
The first point came from Ahn,
who crushed Maho Kowase 6-0,6-1
on court two. It was Tsay again
who delivered a win over her fellow
northern Californian Ayaka
Okuno, 6-1, 6-2 to put Stanford up
2-1. Tan beat Kate Fuller 6-4,7-5 on
court four and Hardebeck deliv
ered the final blow to Silvia Garcia,
coming back after losing her first
set to seize a 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 victory.
Hardebeck's victory over a fellow
rookie marked her first postseason
career win.

Her clincher also propels Stan
ford to the semifinals of the tourna
ment, making the Cardinal the low
est-seeded team to make it that far
since No. 12 UCLA did it in 2007.
Stanford will face red-hot No. 1
Florida (26-2, 12-1 SEC) on Mon
day in a highly anticipated
matchup. The Cardinal lost to the
Gators in February 4-2 but hopes
to use its recent momentum to pull
off yet another upset.
The Card pulled off a 4-3 win
over the Gators in the 2010 NCAA
Championship game, but Florida
returned the favor a year later, de
feating Stanford 4-3 in the finals to
clinch the 2011 national champi
onship.
Stanford has extra incentive to
beat Florida today as two Stanford
Athletics streaks are on the line.
Stanford has yet to win an NCAA
title this year, after earning at least
one for the past 36 years. Stanford
has also won the Directors' Cup for
the past 18 consecutive years. If
the Card fails to win this match, the
Directors' Cup awarded to the
best collegiate athletics program in
the nation could go to Florida.
The matchup between two of
the nation's most storied programs
begins today at 3 p.m. PST, with
the winner moving on to the nation
al championship.

The Stanford women's tennis
team entered this year's NCAA
Tournament without much fan
fare. Seeded No. 12, expecta
tions weren't as high for the
tight-knit squad of eight girls as
they have been in recent years.

But the Cardinal has proved
everyone wrong with its per
formance thus far in the tourna
ment. This weekend, Stanford
knocked out two top five seeded
teams in its quest for a national
title. The first victim was No. 5
USC, whom the Cardinal (20-4,
8-2 Pac-12) outlasted 4-3 in a
five-hour marathon Friday
night. The second casualty was
No. 4 Georgia, who Stanford dis
patched 4-1 in the quarterfinal
matchup on Sunday.
Going into the tournament,
Stanford would rather have not
had to face the Trojans (23-3, 9-
0 Pac-12) in the Round of 16. Not
only did they eliminate the Car
dinal from last year's postsea
son in the quarterfinals, but
they also crushed Stanford 6-1
in this year's regular season
matchup.
