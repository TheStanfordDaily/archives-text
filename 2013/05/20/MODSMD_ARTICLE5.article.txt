## New course promotes world music Class focuses on Azerbaijan in effort to broaden offerings 
### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As part of an ongoing partner
ship with the San Francisco World
Music Festival, the Department of
Music offered a course on the music
and culture of Azerbaijan intend
ed to help promote world music and
global activism this quarter.
Stephen Sano M.A. '9l DMA '94,
the department's chair, said the
course allowed the program to ex
pand its outreach to minority popula
tions within the musical community.
"Stanford has always been
known as a place where traditional
Western European classical music
was the focus," he said. "[The
school] has a majority-minority stu
dent population, and students are
coming in with these amazing levels
of expertise. We are trying to serv
ice that population, and this is one
of the courses that addresses that."
The class, which combines both
lectures and practicums, is taught
by Krystal Barghelame 'O9 M.A.
'O9, a musician of Azerbaijani de
scent who teaches the academic
and contextual material, and
Imamyar Hasanov, a native of
Azerbaijan and a contemporary
practitioner of Azerbaijani music.
Sano noted that the combination of
fers students background on the
region's "history, context, musical
history and the learning of the art
form itself."
While at Stanford, Barghelame
pursued a co-terminal master's de
gree with a focus in Persian poetry
in addition to studying eth
nomusicology. Although she
currently works at a soft
ware company in Palo Alto,
she contributes to the class
in her spare time.
"I loved Stanford, and
want [in] any way I can [to]
be an instrument in bring
ing enriching experiences to
Stanford students," she
said.
Barghelame described
Hasanov, whose instrument
of choice is the bowed
spiked fiddle and who has
toured all over the world
playing Azerbaijani music,
as providing both the musi
cal expertise and teaching
ability to lead a successful
class.
"In a class where you
have students from all dif
ferent backgrounds, he is
able to tune in to what each
student's background is,
whether an Arabic oud [a
mandolin-like instrument]
or a violin he can tune in
to instruments and students
in a beautiful way," Barghe
lame said.
In its inaugural offering,
the course has 16 enrolled
students. According to the
instructors, no level of mu
sical fluency was required
to enroll.
"Obviously if you have
expertise in any of the
forms, it is welcome," Sano
said. "All courses are simi
lar, we welcome it but it's
not required."
According to Barghe
lame, the course was
prompted by a departmen
tal desire to branch out into
different forms of music, a
movement led in part by
new ethnomusicologist An
na Schultz.
"Anna has offered sever
al courses and been instru
mental in bringing special
ists in Indian music to cam
pus," Sano said. "The eth
nomusicology part of our of
fice has just exploded in the
last few years."
According to Barghe
lame, her course was no ex
ception to Schultz's influ
ence.
"This course brings in
new approaches to ethno
musicology, and reinvents
how we do ethnography,"
Barghelame said.
The two instructors ex
pressed hope that the

course would expand the
musical and educational
horizons of its students.
"We have a diversity of
students, and that is what
we wanted. There are back
grounds in Persian, Middle
Eastern, jazz and Western
music incredible diversi
ty in the class," Barghelame
said. "Our goal for these
students is to get contact
with a new music system
and learn about a whole new
theory while diversifying
their own musical vocabu
lary."
Students participating in
the class also have the op
portunity to perform in the
San Francisco World Music
Festival, a program that in
corporates different multi
media elements to tell sto
ries and think about innova
tive ways of presenting tra
ditional music traditions
from a range of cultures.
"We'll have real time
satellite performances and
film crews out in locations
around the world streaming
musicians and tying to cre
ate immediacy and connec
tion with that part of the
world," Barghelame said.
"The [festival] thinks about
tradition and modernity in a
new way. It makes music tra
ditions engaging for an audi
ence that isn't familiar with
them."
Through their active en
gagement with Azerbaijani
culture, students in the
course have embraced the
festival's incorporation of
means of communication
that create connections with
other parts of the world
through music.
"Instead of writing pa
pers, students write [on] a
blog," Barghelame said. "We
are establishing a network
between Stanford and Azer
baijan. We don't want them
to just absorb the informa
tion they are learning, but to
contribute to the global fo
rum and express their opin
ions on encountering and
learning about a new cul
ture."
On top of learning about
the history and culture of
Azerbaijani music, students
will also participate in a
practicum, culminating in a
final performance for the
Stanford community. The
course's success might en
courage future collabora
tions with the World Music
Festival.
