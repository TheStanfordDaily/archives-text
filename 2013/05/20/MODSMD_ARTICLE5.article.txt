### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As part of an ongoing partner
ship with the San Francisco World
Music Festival, the Department of
Music offered a course on the music
and culture of Azerbaijan intend
ed to help promote world music and
global activism this quarter.
Stephen Sano M.A. '9l DMA '94,
the department's chair, said the
course allowed the program to ex
pand its outreach to minority popula
tions within the musical community.
"Stanford has always been
known as a place where traditional
Western European classical music
was the focus," he said. "[The
school] has a majority-minority stu
dent population, and students are
coming in with these amazing levels
of expertise. We are trying to serv
ice that population, and this is one
of the courses that addresses that."
The class, which combines both
lectures and practicums, is taught
by Krystal Barghelame 'O9 M.A.
'O9, a musician of Azerbaijani de
scent who teaches the academic
and contextual material, and
Imamyar Hasanov, a native of
Azerbaijan and a contemporary
practitioner of Azerbaijani music.
Sano noted that the combination of
fers students background on the
region's "history, context, musical
history and the learning of the art
form itself."
While at Stanford, Barghelame
pursued a co-terminal master's de
gree with a focus in Persian poetry
