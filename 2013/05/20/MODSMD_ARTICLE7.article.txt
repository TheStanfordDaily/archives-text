## Researchers track cell interactions 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A group of Stanford re
searchers have developed a
new technique for tracking
cell interactions in living
bodies, an advance that has
significant implications for
revealing information
about the migration of
metastatic cancer cells.
The researchers' tech
nique involves genetically
altering cancer cells, which
are also called reporter
cells, and immune cells,
dubbed activator cells. The
activator cells were engi
neered to produce an en
zyme that would convert
caged luciferin into lu
ciferin, a biological com
pound found in fireflies.
The reporter cells were
altered to produce lu
ciferase, an enzyme that
would catalyze the luciferin
produced by the activator
cells and ultimately emit
light. Ten mice were inject
ed with the genetically al
tered reporter and activa
tor cells as well as caged lu
ciferin.
The research team was
able to detect when and
where the immune cells in
teracted with the metastat
ic cancer cells, as the spe
cific areas in the mouse's
body would light up in indi
cating interaction between
the activator and reporter
cells.

The team's results were
published in a study co-au
thored by Mark Sellmyer

According to Prescher,
the technique's creation
was motivated by the re
searchers' struggles with
tracking specific cell inter
actions in metastatic and
infectious models because
of the large number of in
teractions between cell
populations in living bodies.
"We thought it would
make our lives easier to on
ly illuminate the interac
tions that we were most
concerned about," Prescher
said. "There were no good
ways to do that, so we had
to repurpose existing tech
nologies to skew the optical
signals."
Contag said that he,
Sellmyer, Prescher and
Wandless worked on devel
oping the new technique
between 2009 and 2011,
spending a significant
amount of time brainstorm
ing ideas for creating the
most efficient and widely
applicable method for
tracking cell interactions.
"We tried a lot of differ
ent systems, but this ended
up being the one that was
the easiest and will be [the]
one that hopefully other
people can use in their labs,
[and it is also] the fastest,"
Sellmyer said, noting that
many existing methods of
tracking interactions be
tween cells, such as im
planting a microscope into
a living body, are not very
effective.
While the researchers'
new technique works well
for tracking cell interac
tions in mice, Sellmyer said
that it cannot yet be ap
plied to humans, and in
stead functions primarily
as a research tool for im
munologists, cancer biolo
gists and microbiologists.
"It's limited by the pen-
