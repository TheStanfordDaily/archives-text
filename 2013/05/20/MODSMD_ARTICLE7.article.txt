## Researchers track cell interactions 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
A group of Stanford re
searchers have developed a
new technique for tracking
cell interactions in living
bodies, an advance that has
significant implications for
revealing information
about the migration of
metastatic cancer cells.
The researchers' tech
nique involves genetically
altering cancer cells, which
are also called reporter
cells, and immune cells,
dubbed activator cells. The
activator cells were engi
neered to produce an en
zyme that would convert
caged luciferin into lu
ciferin, a biological com
pound found in fireflies.
The reporter cells were
altered to produce lu
ciferase, an enzyme that
would catalyze the luciferin
produced by the activator
cells and ultimately emit
light. Ten mice were inject
ed with the genetically al
tered reporter and activa
tor cells as well as caged lu
ciferin.
The research team was
able to detect when and
where the immune cells in
teracted with the metastat
ic cancer cells, as the spe
cific areas in the mouse's
body would light up in indi
cating interaction between
the activator and reporter
cells.

The team's results were
published in a study co-au
thored by Mark Sellmyer

scholar Jennifer Prescher,

Imoto, Professor of Pedi
atrics and of Microbiology
and Immunology Christo
pher Contag and Associate
Professor of Chemical and
Systems Biology Thomas

Wandless.
According to Prescher,
the technique's creation
was motivated by the re
searchers' struggles with
tracking specific cell inter
actions in metastatic and
infectious models because
of the large number of in
teractions between cell
populations in living bodies.
"We thought it would
make our lives easier to on
ly illuminate the interac
tions that we were most
concerned about," Prescher
said. "There were no good
ways to do that, so we had
to repurpose existing tech
nologies to skew the optical
signals."
Contag said that he,
Sellmyer, Prescher and
Wandless worked on devel
oping the new technique
between 2009 and 2011,
spending a significant
amount of time brainstorm
ing ideas for creating the
most efficient and widely
applicable method for
tracking cell interactions.
"We tried a lot of differ
ent systems, but this ended
up being the one that was
the easiest and will be [the]
one that hopefully other
people can use in their labs,
[and it is also] the fastest,"
Sellmyer said, noting that
many existing methods of
tracking interactions be
tween cells, such as im
planting a microscope into
a living body, are not very
effective.
While the researchers'
new technique works well
for tracking cell interac
tions in mice, Sellmyer said
that it cannot yet be ap
plied to humans, and in
stead functions primarily
as a research tool for im
munologists, cancer biolo
gists and microbiologists.
"It's limited by the pen-
a genetically encoded pro
tein from a firefly," Presch
er said. "We're not at the
point yet to be able to in
troduce a lot of transgenes
into humans."
However, she expressed
confidence the technique
could still be helpful in cur
rent cancer studies, espe
cially as researchers delve
further into the issue of
why cancer reappears and
metastasizes.
"I don't think the cancer
biology community has a
good handle on why that is,
where do the metastatic
cells show up, why they
show up and why can't we
predict that or treat that
aspect of it," Prescher said.
"Imagine if we had ways to
visualize that process, the
most deadly aspect of can

cer progression, and these
types of tools that we're
developing give us away to
begin to see that better."
Prescher said she will
continue to work on gain
ing insight into the early
steps of metastatic disease,
noting that being able to col
lect more data on the move
ments of metastatic cells
would be a "huge boon" for
cancer research.
"You can test all sorts of
therapeutics on metastatic
disease or learn more about
the cells that migrate
around," Prescher said. "Our
tools can now start to give us
a better vantage point of
knowing when and where
that occurs."

firefly protein. Mice are
very small animals, so we
can see the cells almost
anywhere in the animal,"
Sellmyer said. "Humans
have much larger tissue
depth that don't allow the
light to penetrate all the
way through."
According to Prescher,
the barriers preventing
this technology from being
implemented in humans
are quite significant.

ciferase, an enzyme that
would catalyze the luciferin
produced by the activator
cells and ultimately emit
light. Ten mice were inject
ed with the genetically al
tered reporter and activa
tor cells as well as caged lu
ciferin.
The research team was
able to detect when and
where the immune cells in
teracted with the metastat
ic cancer cells, as the spe
cific areas in the mouse's
body would light up in indi
cating interaction between
the activator and reporter
cells.

According to Prescher,
the technique's creation
was motivated by the re
searchers' struggles with
tracking specific cell inter
actions in metastatic and
infectious models because
of the large number of in
teractions between cell
populations in living bodies.
"We thought it would
make our lives easier to on
ly illuminate the interac
tions that we were most
concerned about," Prescher
said. "There were no good
ways to do that, so we had
to repurpose existing tech
nologies to skew the optical
signals."
Contag said that he,
Sellmyer, Prescher and
Wandless worked on devel
oping the new technique
between 2009 and 2011,
spending a significant
amount of time brainstorm
ing ideas for creating the
most efficient and widely
applicable method for
tracking cell interactions.
"We tried a lot of differ
ent systems, but this ended
up being the one that was
the easiest and will be [the]
one that hopefully other
people can use in their labs,
[and it is also] the fastest,"
Sellmyer said, noting that
many existing methods of
tracking interactions be
tween cells, such as im
planting a microscope into
a living body, are not very
effective.
While the researchers'
new technique works well
for tracking cell interac
tions in mice, Sellmyer said
that it cannot yet be ap
plied to humans, and in
stead functions primarily
as a research tool for im
munologists, cancer biolo
gists and microbiologists.
"It's limited by the pen-
a genetically encoded pro
tein from a firefly," Presch
er said. "We're not at the
point yet to be able to in
troduce a lot of transgenes
into humans."
However, she expressed
confidence the technique
could still be helpful in cur
rent cancer studies, espe
cially as researchers delve
further into the issue of
why cancer reappears and
metastasizes.
"I don't think the cancer
biology community has a
good handle on why that is,
where do the metastatic
cells show up, why they
show up and why can't we
predict that or treat that
aspect of it," Prescher said.
"Imagine if we had ways to
visualize that process, the
most deadly aspect of can

cer progression, and these
types of tools that we're
developing give us away to
begin to see that better."
Prescher said she will
continue to work on gain
ing insight into the early
steps of metastatic disease,
noting that being able to col
lect more data on the move
ments of metastatic cells
would be a "huge boon" for
cancer research.
"You can test all sorts of
therapeutics on metastatic
disease or learn more about
the cells that migrate
around," Prescher said. "Our
tools can now start to give us
a better vantage point of
knowing when and where
that occurs."

very small animals, so we
can see the cells almost
anywhere in the animal,"
Sellmyer said. "Humans
have much larger tissue
depth that don't allow the
light to penetrate all the
way through."
According to Prescher,
the barriers preventing
this technology from being
implemented in humans
are quite significant.
