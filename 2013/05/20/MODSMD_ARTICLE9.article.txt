## THE
						NEW MAN Bring Back Western Civ 
### Chris Herries 
According to a memorial reso
lution passed by the faculty
senate in the late 90s for
William Carroll Bark, former direc
tor of the History of Western Civi
lization (HWC) Program, HWC
was for a time the most popular
class at Stanford. The program ran
from 1935 until the late 19605, when
the forces of "political correctness"
caused support from students and
administrators for the program to
decline. This was unfortunate, as
the Western Civ program reached
over 40,000 students over its 34
years, exposing them not only to
the history of the Western world
but the history of Western ideas. I
believe this knowledge of our own
civilization is sorely lacking these
days.
There are a couple of reasons
why Western Civilization in partic
ular should be studied. For exam
ple, no matter which end of the po
litical spectrum you're debating
from, you're undoubtedly coming
from a Western perspective, since,
speaking generally, Europe was the
origin of our ideas on governance.
A capitalist, a Keneysian and a
Marxist walk into a bar. They debate
ideas that originated from and most
greatly influenced the West. Just
look at the birthplaces of then* intel
lectual progenitors: Smith was from
Kirkcaldy, Keynes was from Cam
bridge and Marx was from Trier.
It's also hard to impugn the idea
that the rise of the West was the
most important story in history, at
least when talking about the forma
tion of our modern world. Property
rights, consumerism, the Enlight
enment, the Scientific Revolution,
the Industrial Revolution, the In
formation Revolution all West
ern phenomena. Western medicine
itself doubled and then more than
doubled human life expectancy,
atop slashing infant mortality, im
proving nutrition and eradicating
diseases. To paraphrase Niall Fer
guson, the West rose as a result of
its institutions based on reason, and
the "six killer apps" competition,
modern medicine, the consumer so
ciety, property rights, science and
work ethic. A brief survey of histo
ry will show that empire was the
least original thing the West ever
did.
So obviously Western culture is
unavoidable in the world today, es
pecially as more and more coun
tries adopt Western practices. But
what about Stanford students in
particular? Why should we care?
Well, first and foremost, we're at
a major research university a mod
el which had its origins in Germany.
Secondly there are few, if any fields
you can study here that aren't ei
ther a direct result of Western civi
lization or viewed through a West
ern lens. Modern medicine is West
ern, so why not study its origins if
you're pre-med? You'll begin to
learn why certain ideas, practices
or customs came about in the med
ical field, and walk away with a
greater understanding about the
history of your work. People in
volved in PoliSci, Public Policy and
Econ in particular should be at
tuned to those subjects' history. Is
sues might change, but ideas about
the role of government, property,
equality, etc. have been debated in
the West since the Enlightenment.

If we're going to have a productive
conversation about issues, we have
to understand the fundamental
ideas behind them.
Even on campus, think of the
debates that would benefit from a
little knowledge of history. Take
standard of evidence in the Alter
native Review Process. Why do we
as a society value innocent until
proven guilty? Well, it has its ori
gins in Roman and Common law:
"Ei incumbit probatio, qui dicit, non
qui negat; cum per rerum naturam
factum negantis probatio nulla sit."
(The proof lies upon him who af
firms, not upon him who denies;
since, by the nature of things, he
who denies a fact cannot produce
any proof.) It's a very, very old
maxim sacred to our society that
shouldn't be discarded lightly, even
in the context of a university.
Additionally, our discussions
about race and ethnicity affect the
very foundations of our society, and
not simply because our founding in
volved exclusionary principles. Is
not equality under the law true
equality? Or must we have equality
of outcomes? We laud democracies,
but what happens when they op
press minority groups? Is not the
right to own property and the prod
ucts of your labor more important
than democracy? It's all part of the
debate opened by Plato's "Repub
lic" what is justice?
And yet here at Stanford a stu
dent can go four years never having
picked up "The Republic" or "Can
dide" or "The Wealth of Nations" or
"Das Kapital" or any of those books
that are the very foundation of
philosophical wisdom, books that
have contributed to the great West
ern conversation. I'm certainly not
saying you should go become a his
tory major or a classicist. Do what
you love and go benefit the world
with it.
But what I am saying is this: We
need to be able to understand our
civilization, which has both brought
about the greatest standard of liv
ing in human history and caused
unbelievable suffering. By doing so
we can not only marvel at its suc
cesses, but begin to correct its
shortcomings. I believe Stanford
should not only do a greater job
promoting the humanities, but
should have a standard core curric
ula in the "Great Books" mold, ex
posing people to the most impor
tant ideas in our history.

I believe our
knowledge of our
own civilization
is sorely lacking
these days.
