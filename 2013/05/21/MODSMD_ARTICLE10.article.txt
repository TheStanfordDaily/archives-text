# TRACK BLOG

### CAMERON MILLER â€“ Cameron Miller 
Hey guys, I hope that you
enjoyed the first install
ment of the track and field
practice blog yesterday.
Our regional competitors leave for
Austin, Texas, today, so yesterday
was their last day on campus until
they return this weekend.
Some of the distance runners had
a long day. The usual 7:15 a.m. Mon
day-Wednesday-Thursday practice
crowd was sparse, with only five
four redshirting freshman plus junior
Erik Olson embarking on a run
east of campus past Gunn High
School and into Los Altos Hills. Most
of the distance crew men and
women reconvened at 2:30 p.m. for
a weight room session before heading
out for the day's second run.
Also in the afternoon, our four re
gional competitors in the 1,500 me
ters Mike, Stutz, Marco Bertolotti
and Justin Brinkley had one final
tune-up workout before going down
to Texas. The work was relatively
easy: two 800s at 5k pace, four 400s at
64-66 seconds apiece and four 150s at
race pace.
Other men's regional competitors
out at Cobb Track & Angell Field this
afternoon included senior javelin
thrower Aaron Konigsberg, whose
workout included mobility drills over
hurdles, and sophomore hammer
thrower Lucas Rowley, who was go
ing through a session under the

watchful
eye of asso
date head
coach Michele Eisenreich.
While the work is intense, practice
can have its lighter moments. Senior
thrower Geoff Tabor, who will be com
peting in both the shot put and the
discus at the regional meet, and I hap
pen to think the movie "0 Brother,
Where Art Thou?" is one of the great
est films of all time. Over the past few
weeks we've been quoting lines of the
movie back and forth to one another,
usually accompanied by Geoff's rau
cous and infectious laughter. Our dia
logue yesterday started in the locker
room when I started singing the Sog
gy Bottom Boys and continued out to
the track. But I digress. Back to track
and field.
Our women's squad is sending 10
distance runners to Austin, including
3 half-milers. Justine Fedronic, Amy
Weissenbach and Claudia Sanders
are at the core of a strong middle dis
tance group and they hit the track for
the final time yesterday before de
parting this [Tuesday] afternoon.
This crew completed four 400s, four
200s and four 80 meter all-out sprints
in advance of its Thursday prelimi
nary round.
