# GEORGIA BOUND
## 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
After a couple of season-saving
rounds to wrap-up the NCAA
West Regional, the No. 10 Stan
ford women's golf team begins
play today at its fourth consecu
tive NCAA Championships at the
University of Georgia Golf Course
in Athens, Ga.
Although qualifying for the
dance hasn't been an issue for the
Cardinal, it has struggled once ad
vancing, recording finishes of a tie
for 19th in 2010, 23rd in 2011 and
24th last year in the 24-team field.
Making her anticipated NCAA
Championships debut is highly
touted freshman Mariah Stack
house. Ranked No. 3 among colle
giate golfers, this will be a huge
homecoming for Stackhouse, who
is a native of Riverdale, Ga., a 90-
minute drive from the course.
Not only is Stackhouse familiar
with the course, but she is also
bound to see plenty of familiar
faces in her gallery, as she expects
family and many of her local
friends and supporters to make
the trip. Head coach Anne Walker
brushed off the notion that all
those extra eyes on her star play
er could bring a myriad of distrac
tions to an already formidable

mental challenge.
"Mariah will be fine," Walker
said. "She thrives under pressure
and enjoys having the spotlight on
her. I think this will be a memory
that she will always treasure, play
ing the NCAA Championship in
front of a home crowd."
While Stackhouse struggled a
bit on her home course at the West
Regional, sophomore Mariko Tu
mangan experienced a continued
resurgence.
After her second top-15 indi
vidual finish of the year at the Pac
-12 Championships, Tumangan
recorded her second top-10 per
formance of the year at the region
al and her first since tying for sec
ond at the Cal Classic back in Feb
ruary. Walker praised Tbmangan's
development this season, calling
her a "big-time player."
Tumangan has credited a
change in mindset as the key to
her turnaround.
"My play at some of the tour
naments this year was inconsis
tent and it was definitely disap
pointing," Tbmangan said. "How
ever, I used the negatives to drive
me to work harder and practice
more. I have been working on
making things simpler in my mind

and I am still continuing to
work on it. If I keep focusing
on improving myself every
day, the outcome will turn
out."
Not only is Walker excited
about the play of Tumangan,
she believes freshman Lau
ren Kim is hugely underrated
going into the Champi
onships. Kim has been very
steady in the spring cam
paign. Usually the team's sec
ond or third lowest scorer,
Kim has also recorded two
top-10 finishes.
Walker believes it won't be
long until Kim finds herself at
the top of the leaderboard.
"Lauren Kim hasn't re
ceived a lot of attention this
season but she has quietly
been logging a strong fresh
man season," Walker said.
"Lauren's consistency has
been invaluable for our
team's success, and I believe

she is very close to capturing
her first collegiate victory."
Rounding out Stanford's
lineup will be senior Sally
Watson and junior Danielle
Frasier.
Watson, a seasoned veter
an with three previous NCAA
Championships appearances
and a ninth-place finish her
freshman year, will be making
the final start of her collegiate
career.
For Frasier, this postsea
son has been one of firsts
in the past month she has
made her first career Pac-12
Tournament and regional
starts and now will make her
inaugural foray into the
NCAA Championships.
In order to be successful
on the UGA course, Walker
believes her team will need to
be on point with its play off
the tees, as the layout will be
significantly longer than most
in-season tournaments.
"Driving the ball is one of
our strengths," Walker said.
"Mariah, Mariko and Sally
are all very long hitters off of
the tee, and Danielle and

Lauren are extremely accu
rate. We miss very few fair
ways as a team and I think
this will be to our advantage
this week."
While the field will be the
strongest the Cardinal has
faced all year, it will feature
plenty of familial* opponents,
as a total of six Pac-12 teams
will make the trek to Georgia.
Only the SEC has more
teams in the national champi
onship with seven.
The Stanford women will
tee off today at the first hole
in the morning wave in the
only four-round tournament
the team has faced all season.
"It will no doubt be an ex
hausting week, but I think we
have prepared well and are
ready," Kim said. "[The four
round event] has not really
changed anything besides
pre-accepting that we will
need to fight hard through fa
tigue. I am confident our
work in the gym and on the
course will pay off."
