# GEORGIA BOUND

### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
After a couple of season-saving
rounds to wrap-up the NCAA
West Regional, the No. 10 Stan
ford women's golf team begins
play today at its fourth consecu
tive NCAA Championships at the
University of Georgia Golf Course
in Athens, Ga.
Although qualifying for the
dance hasn't been an issue for the
Cardinal, it has struggled once ad
vancing, recording finishes of a tie
for 19th in 2010, 23rd in 2011 and
24th last year in the 24-team field.
Making her anticipated NCAA
Championships debut is highly
touted freshman Mariah Stack
house. Ranked No. 3 among colle
giate golfers, this will be a huge
homecoming for Stackhouse, who
is a native of Riverdale, Ga., a 90-
minute drive from the course.
Not only is Stackhouse familiar
with the course, but she is also
bound to see plenty of familiar
faces in her gallery, as she expects
family and many of her local
friends and supporters to make
the trip. Head coach Anne Walker
brushed off the notion that all
those extra eyes on her star play
er could bring a myriad of distrac
tions to an already formidable

mental challenge.
"Mariah will be fine," Walker
said. "She thrives under pressure
and enjoys having the spotlight on
her. I think this will be a memory
that she will always treasure, play
ing the NCAA Championship in
front of a home crowd."
While Stackhouse struggled a
bit on her home course at the West
Regional, sophomore Mariko Tu
mangan experienced a continued
resurgence.
After her second top-15 indi
vidual finish of the year at the Pac
-12 Championships, Tumangan
recorded her second top-10 per
formance of the year at the region
al and her first since tying for sec
ond at the Cal Classic back in Feb
ruary. Walker praised Tbmangan's
development this season, calling
her a "big-time player."
Tumangan has credited a
change in mindset as the key to
her turnaround.
"My play at some of the tour
naments this year was inconsis
tent and it was definitely disap
pointing," Tbmangan said. "How
ever, I used the negatives to drive
me to work harder and practice
more. I have been working on
making things simpler in my mind
