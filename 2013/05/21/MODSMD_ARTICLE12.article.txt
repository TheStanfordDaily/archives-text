The Cardinal is still alive.
A week ago, the season
looked incredibly bleak for
Stanford baseball. After a
postseason berth seemed eas
ily within its reach following a
26-15 start to the season, the
Cardinal crashed into the
brick wall known as the Ore
gon State Beavers and en
dured a six-game tailspin as a
result. On the tail end of that
skid, it seemed like the Cardi
nal's once-strong postseason
hopes had vanished.
But Stanford showed re
newed signs of life over the
weekend in its series sweep of
cross-Bay rival Cal, keeping
its hopes for a playoff berth
alive and showing its unwill
ingness to go down without a
fight.
Likely needing to win out
in order to have a shot at the
postseason, Stanford (29-21,
14-13 Pac-12) will aim for one
final push to the finish line in
its season-closing four-game
homestand, starting with a re
match against Pacific (14-36,
6-18 Big West) tonight.
In its previous meeting

with Pacific last month, the
Cardinal handily tamed the
Tigers to the tune of a 9-2 vic
tory that was never in doubt
over the course of the entire
game. Stanford can only hope
that this rematch will bring
more of the same.
Stanford looks to grab a
victory today in order to pro
pel itself into its critical regu
lar season finale against No.
11 UCLA. The Tigers' bat
tered pitching staff will give
the resurgent Cardinal hitters
a perfect opportunity to do
just that.
Pacific's pitchers combine
for an unsightly ERA of 5.45, a
statistic that the Cardinal will
look to exploit. Stanford's of
fense, which has been incon
sistent at times this season,
has picked up its production
as of late. The Cardinal scored
25 runs in its three-game
sweep of Cal.
However, the Cardinal hit
ters learned an incredibly
sobering lesson last Tbesday
against Santa Clara righty
Tommy Nance: come game
time, statistics can go out the
window. Nance, who had been
