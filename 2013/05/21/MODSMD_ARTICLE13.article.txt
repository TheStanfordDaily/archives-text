# OPINIONS
## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Free Speech and the Academic Mission 
### Miles Unterreiner 
On February 7 of this year, ani
mal rights advocates from the
Stanford chapter of activist
group Direct Action Now (DxE) in
terrupted a panel discussion of the
documentary "American Meat," a
critique of the American industrial
meat production system in favor of
kindlier and more local animal hus
bandry Insisting that any kind of
farming in which animals are killed
including the softer version pro
moted by the directors of "American
Meat" —is morally unacceptable,
the protesters loudly spoke over the
panel and its moderator, temporarily
derailing the event's intended dia
logue.
In April, a Florida Atlantic Uni
versity professor held an in-class ex
ercise during which a Mormon stu
dent was encouraged to write the
word "Jesus" on a piece of paper and
then stomp on it. Despite insisting
that the very purpose of the exercise
was to encourage students to grapple
with why cultural symbols carried
sacred or important value, the pro
fessor was placed on administrative
leave after a firestorm of public con
troversy.
On May 4, more than 100 student
activists affiliated with environmen
tal group Mountain Justice (MJ)
stormed an open meeting of Swarth
more College's Board of Managers.
Rejecting the meeting's existing for
mat under which the Board would
have presented arguments for and
against fossil fuel divestment, a cam
paign that has also taken off at Stan
ford — MJ members instead inter
rupted the Board's first speaker and
proceeded to set their own meeting
agenda, preventing Board member
and Swarthmore alum Chris Niem
czewski from delivering a presenta
tion about the fiscal consequences of
divestment for the College endow
ment.
And on May 10, immigration re
searcher Jason Richwine resigned
from the conservative Heritage
Foundation after the Washington
Post discovered that his Harvard
Ph.D. dissertation asserted the exis
tence of "deep-set differentials in in
telligence between races." Students
at Harvard's Kennedy School of Gov
ernment penned an open letter argu
ing that "the Harvard Kennedy
School cannot ethically stand by aca
demic work advocating a national
policy of exclusion."
What do these three events have
in common? They reflect the idea
that some topics can be so morally
unacceptable as to be off-limits to dis
cussion that dialogue about those
topics is itself intrinsically illegiti
mate and unsuited for an academic
environment.
Is stonewalling ever superior to
dialogue? Is refusing to discuss a
contentious topic ever the right thing
to do? And does the mission of the
University to educate its students
present a special set of circum
stances that modify the general rules
of free speech?
To the first two, I answer "very,
very rarely," and to the last, I answer
"yes, but not in the way you'd think."
The ideological architecture of
free speech is supported by two for
midable pillars: the inherent right of
every human to self-expression and
the utilitarian value produced by a
free exchange of ideas. The first as
serts that no person ought to have his
conscience infringed by the govern
ment and the second that the best
ideas cannot achieve prominence, nor
the worst be jettisoned, unless socie
ty allows them to compete freely with
one another in the public mind.
John Stuart Mill, the chief engi
neer of utilitarian free speech theory,
asserted famously that opinion is ei
ther right or wrong and that in both
cases silencing speech harms society.
"If the opinion is right," argued Mill

in "On Liberty," "they are deprived
of the opportunity of exchanging er
ror for truth: if wrong, they lose,
what is almost as great a benefit, the
clearer perception and livelier im
pression of truth, produced by its col
lision with error." In other words, si
lence the truth and you lose it; silence
lies and you lose the chance to see
clearly why you were right in the
first place or to be inspired to fight
back in support of the right and good.
In March 2010, for example, mem
bers of the Kansas-based Westboro
Baptist Church, infamous for picket
ing the funerals of American soldiers
with hateful anti-LGBT placards, de
cided to bring their virulent message
of bigotry to Stanford University. The
University could legally have prohib
ited them from picketing; doing so
would have been well within Stan
ford's rights as a private property
owner, and many groups insisted that
the University exercise that right to
bar WBC from campus.
Wisely the University (led by
philosopher-Provost John Etehemendy)
did the opposite. And as Mill might
have predicted, the positive effect
was dramatic: campus came together
in a huge and joyful counter-protest,
an opportunity for unity that would
have been lost had Stanford taken
the easy route out.
One can imagine potential events
with far more offensive and extreme
participants than those scary organic
farmers featured in American Meat
or even the bigots of the WBC:
"Should Homosexuals be publicly
Crucified or Merely Stoned to
Death? A panel discussion featuring
Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia," for
instance, or "Jefferson Davis debates
Abraham Lincoln on the ethics of
slavery" (brought to you by a collabo
ration between the Program in Ethics
and Society and the physics depart
ment's Michael Crichton Program in
Trans-Millenial Time Travel).
Yet both events would present in
valuable opportunities for campus
unity and counter-organization; for
pure, unadulterated learning (about
the differences between Salafi and
Shi'a Islamic law regarding sexuality,
for instance, or about which pro-slav
ery arguments the Confederates be
lieved in most strongly and how Lin
coln might have refuted them); and
for the essentials of the University
mission. I personally would feel it a
shame were either of these hypothet
ical events to be shut down by pro
testers (or administrators) refusing
to allow the speakers to speak.
Ultimately, both rights-based and
utilitarian justifications for free
speech hold true on University cam
puses as surely as they do elsewhere.
But within the walls of the ivory tow
er, free speech can serve a third,
equally valuable purpose: educating
students in the conduct and purpose
of difficult dialogue and in how to
grapple with arguments with which
we firmly disagree.
That's why I read National Re
view every week. It's why history
courses assign "Mein Kampf," or
speeches by Stalin or Mao. It's why
you should keep challenging yourself
to interact with controversial speak
ers and writers. And it's why that
tiny "free speech zone" in White
Plaza, open during that tiny sliver
from noon to 1 p.m., needs to get a
whole lot bigger.

philosopher-Provost John Etehemendy)
did the opposite. And as Mill might
have predicted, the positive effect
was dramatic: campus came together
in a huge and joyful counter-protest,
an opportunity for unity that would
have been lost had Stanford taken
the easy route out.
One can imagine potential events
with far more offensive and extreme
participants than those scary organic
farmers featured in American Meat
or even the bigots of the WBC:
"Should Homosexuals be publicly
Crucified or Merely Stoned to
Death? A panel discussion featuring
Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia," for
instance, or "Jefferson Davis debates
Abraham Lincoln on the ethics of
slavery" (brought to you by a collabo
ration between the Program in Ethics
and Society and the physics depart
ment's Michael Crichton Program in
Trans-Millenial Time Travel).
Yet both events would present in
valuable opportunities for campus
unity and counter-organization; for
pure, unadulterated learning (about
the differences between Salafi and
Shi'a Islamic law regarding sexuality,
for instance, or about which pro-slav
ery arguments the Confederates be
lieved in most strongly and how Lin
coln might have refuted them); and
for the essentials of the University
mission. I personally would feel it a
shame were either of these hypothet
ical events to be shut down by pro
testers (or administrators) refusing
to allow the speakers to speak.
Ultimately, both rights-based and
utilitarian justifications for free
speech hold true on University cam
puses as surely as they do elsewhere.
But within the walls of the ivory tow
er, free speech can serve a third,
equally valuable purpose: educating
students in the conduct and purpose
of difficult dialogue and in how to
grapple with arguments with which
we firmly disagree.
That's why I read National Re
view every week. It's why history
courses assign "Mein Kampf," or
speeches by Stalin or Mao. It's why
you should keep challenging yourself
to interact with controversial speak
ers and writers. And it's why that
tiny "free speech zone" in White
Plaza, open during that tiny sliver
from noon to 1 p.m., needs to get a
whole lot bigger.

On February 7 of this year, ani
mal rights advocates from the
Stanford chapter of activist
group Direct Action Now (DxE) in
terrupted a panel discussion of the
documentary "American Meat," a
critique of the American industrial
meat production system in favor of
kindlier and more local animal hus
bandry Insisting that any kind of
farming in which animals are killed
including the softer version pro
moted by the directors of "American
Meat" —is morally unacceptable,
the protesters loudly spoke over the
panel and its moderator, temporarily
derailing the event's intended dia
logue.
In April, a Florida Atlantic Uni
versity professor held an in-class ex
ercise during which a Mormon stu
dent was encouraged to write the
word "Jesus" on a piece of paper and
then stomp on it. Despite insisting
that the very purpose of the exercise
was to encourage students to grapple
with why cultural symbols carried
sacred or important value, the pro
fessor was placed on administrative
leave after a firestorm of public con
troversy.
On May 4, more than 100 student
activists affiliated with environmen
tal group Mountain Justice (MJ)
stormed an open meeting of Swarth
more College's Board of Managers.
Rejecting the meeting's existing for
mat under which the Board would
have presented arguments for and
against fossil fuel divestment, a cam
paign that has also taken off at Stan
ford — MJ members instead inter
rupted the Board's first speaker and
proceeded to set their own meeting
agenda, preventing Board member
and Swarthmore alum Chris Niem
czewski from delivering a presenta
tion about the fiscal consequences of
divestment for the College endow
ment.
And on May 10, immigration re
searcher Jason Richwine resigned
from the conservative Heritage
Foundation after the Washington
Post discovered that his Harvard
Ph.D. dissertation asserted the exis
tence of "deep-set differentials in in
telligence between races." Students
at Harvard's Kennedy School of Gov
ernment penned an open letter argu
ing that "the Harvard Kennedy
School cannot ethically stand by aca
demic work advocating a national
policy of exclusion."
What do these three events have
in common? They reflect the idea
that some topics can be so morally
unacceptable as to be off-limits to dis
cussion that dialogue about those
topics is itself intrinsically illegiti
mate and unsuited for an academic
environment.
Is stonewalling ever superior to
dialogue? Is refusing to discuss a
contentious topic ever the right thing
to do? And does the mission of the
University to educate its students
present a special set of circum
stances that modify the general rules
of free speech?
To the first two, I answer "very,
very rarely," and to the last, I answer
"yes, but not in the way you'd think."
The ideological architecture of
free speech is supported by two for
midable pillars: the inherent right of
every human to self-expression and
the utilitarian value produced by a
free exchange of ideas. The first as
serts that no person ought to have his
conscience infringed by the govern
ment and the second that the best
ideas cannot achieve prominence, nor
the worst be jettisoned, unless socie
ty allows them to compete freely with
one another in the public mind.
John Stuart Mill, the chief engi
neer of utilitarian free speech theory,
asserted famously that opinion is ei
ther right or wrong and that in both
cases silencing speech harms society.
"If the opinion is right," argued Mill

in "On Liberty," "they are deprived
of the opportunity of exchanging er
ror for truth: if wrong, they lose,
what is almost as great a benefit, the
clearer perception and livelier im
pression of truth, produced by its col
lision with error." In other words, si
lence the truth and you lose it; silence
lies and you lose the chance to see
clearly why you were right in the
first place or to be inspired to fight
back in support of the right and good.
In March 2010, for example, mem
bers of the Kansas-based Westboro
Baptist Church, infamous for picket
ing the funerals of American soldiers
with hateful anti-LGBT placards, de
cided to bring their virulent message
of bigotry to Stanford University. The
University could legally have prohib
ited them from picketing; doing so
would have been well within Stan
ford's rights as a private property
owner, and many groups insisted that
the University exercise that right to
bar WBC from campus.
