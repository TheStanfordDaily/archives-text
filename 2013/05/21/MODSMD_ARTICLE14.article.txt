# Which Drowns You Faster: the Gravity or the Flush? Part I
## 
### Taylor Brady 
With the specter of gradua
tion looming, my family,
friends, instructors, peers,
random strangers at the bloody air
port are all inquiring what I am do
ing next year. My future excites
me, sure, but I'd rather ask, "What
the hell have I done so far?" I'm
peering into my Stanford under
graduate years like an empty bag
of chips that I scarfed on a televi
sion binge while procrastinating for
finals. It's not that I'm baffled by
their disappearance, no, I remem
ber every salty flake, rather I want
to admit why I consumed what I
did.
The danger of retrospection is
that it can be just as uncertain as
projection. We think, "the past
happened and I was there to wit
ness it. Of course I remember
clearly." But our brains very liter
ally deceive us into believing in
memories that never occurred, dis
torting the past like a funhouse
mirror because we don't like what
we actually see. Today, I am going
to recall the honest image in the
hopes that we, more specifically
first-gen and low-income students,
will cease to lie to ourselves.
Coming to Stanford constituted
a profound culture shock for
me. Here's how little I knew:
when I applied, I thought that
Stanford was a safety school. No
joke. I was not educated in private
academies where the dream of this
institution was placed, steaming,
in front of me from Pedialyte to
graduation dinner. I was desper
ate to go to college, sure, but I was
looking for full scholarships to Ari
zona state schools until the sum
mer before senior year when
somebody told me that Stanford,
Harvard and the like gave full
need-based scholarships, not just
loans. Ultimately, it was cheaper
to come here than to stay at home,
but I paid a non-monetary price
for the privilege.
A young woman that I met at a
party this year quipped, when I
asked her how her immigrant
family experienced America, "It
meant eating SPAM and losing all
semblance of culture." First year
at Stanford is cultural assimila
tion in much the same vein. If you
did not attend schools whose lec
ture halls and syllabi look very
much like those you sit down to on
the first day of fall quarter, then
you have to learn to play the rules
of the game that you're suddenly
playing.
And Stanford makes it
easy. Dorms are lively and staff

strive to organize events to bring
folks together. Student groups
shout at you to get involved from
behind collapsible polyurethane
tables. I was swept up, too, and
joined a tutoring service in East
Palo Alto, a west African drum and
dance ensemble much like one I'd
been in at home and a host of oth
er groups where my involvement
was so fleeting that it's not worth
mentioning.
Yet I didn't stick. I didn't stick
because I was painfully aware that
I was trying too hard and that I
wasn't being true to the self that I
knew from home. So I wrenched
my Arizona pushpin out and by the
summer after freshman year, I had
dropped off the map.
Dean Julie and every other per
son with a smile on their face in
sisted, "Stanford admissions
doesn't make mistakes. You be
long here." It's a warm platitude
meant to welcome students, but I
think that for first-generation or
low-income students it misses the
mark. In fact it's shooting at the
completely wrong target: us, in
stead of who we're concerned
about: others. I did feel that I
had strived for and deserved the
opportunities afforded me here,
but I wondered why my friends
back home were coked out in a
shack by the University of Ari
zona, or worse, instead of sitting in

the seat next to me.
Second and third years at Stan
ford are where you sink or swim, so
we are told. You get Chappell-
Lougee, or you don't. You get on
the Rhodes track, or you don't. You
get into the McGehee lab, or you
rage-quit and stop sending three
emails a week. But which drowns
you faster: the gravity or the flush?
In hindsight, of course, I know
that I flushed much of those two
years down the toilet myself, but at
the time, in self-pity and self
loathing, I determined that it was
my fate to be dragged under water.
Sophomore and junior year, I in
dulged primarily in two things:
books and drugs. Those years still
hold fond memories and yielded me
good friends, but overwhelmingly I
had the wrong approach. Instead
of seeking aid from the professors
who eagerly throw it at you or find
ing solace in the many communities
built around the very issues de
pressing me, I sunk into myself and
read voraciously on topics like eco
logical degradation over which I
had little control. That's enough
to turn anybody into a misan
thrope. Instead of celebrating, in a
healthy way, achievements and
good scores on finals, I went to
them phased out or returned from
them to chemical escapism. I did it
because I wanted to know, visceral
ly, what was running through the
blood and the minds of the people
I'd left behind.
I don't know what rehab is like,
but I imagine that the first thing
that you have to overcome is self
pity. While I never went as far
down the rabbit hole as some of my
peers, I think that we all had one
thing in common: a victim com
plex. Comparatively I am a whin
ing, overprivileged snot. Truly.
In conversations with one young
woman in my dorm this year, I am
humbled and reminded of how
much more structural inequality, or
racism, or sexism, or poverty that I
could have had to overcome. My
parents are fantastic, supportive,
hard-working people who imparted
to me lessons that I was too stupid
to learn. When I spoke to this
young woman Saturday the only
thing of substance that I had to say
was (paraphrased), "I don't under
stand exactly where you come
from, but I can tell you that you
need to stop telling yourself that
you're not good enough."

Look for part two in next week's pa
per. In the meantime, email Taylor

I don't know
what rehab is

imagine that
the first thing
that you have to
overcome is
self-pity.
