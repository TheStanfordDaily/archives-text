# Q&A
## FAROUK DEY DIRECTOR OF THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT CENTER 
### SOO JI LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Farouk Dey is the new director
of the Career Development Center
(CDC), having joined the University
from Carnegie Mellon last month.
The Daily sat down with Dey to dis
cuss his career, time at Stanford to
date and plans for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): When
and what made you want to go in
to career services?
Farouk Dey (FD): I tried a... in
ternship in career services ca
reer counseling to college students
to help them with them passions
and I found that very energizing. I
liked the idea of working with col
lege students about their potential
and what they could become. I fell in
love with the work and the idea that
you could work with people on opti
mistic issues on what they could be
come in their lives.
TSD: Six weeks into this job, what
have you learned so far?
FD: What I have learned is that
there is tremendous potential here
tremendous talent. I've been im
pressed with the talent of the staff
at the CDC. I've been impressed
with how eager the campus commu
nity is for our growing vision of ca
reer services at Stanford. I think
even the CDC staff are proud of
their accomplishments for the many
years but they're also eager for a
new direction, for a future direction.
[The] staff has done great work
but there is [an] opportunity for us
to grow and to bring more opportu
nities to students and alumni. There
are other offices that intersect with
the world of career development
that we could collaborate more with,
opportunities to collaborate more
with alumni and the alumni office. I
think there are opportunities for us
to enhance services for graduate
students particularly and for stu
dents who are in fields that may
seem underrepresented in the world
of work.
TSD: What specific changes
would you like to make to the CD-
C's current functions or program
ming?
FD: I'll have to be honest
with you that it's too early for
that. I've been here for exact
ly six weeks so I am in the
process of engaging with the
campus-wide listening tour. If
you talk to any leader who
tells you within their first few
weeks that they already have
a plan for changes and vision
for the future that's already
established and that they're
ready to go, I would be con
cerned, personally, for that
type of leadership. I truly be
lieve that leadership is in
spired by listening to people,
giving people the opportunity
to voice their thoughts and
their concerns and allowing
the opinions to inspire the
changes and the vision for the
future.
For the first two weeks on
the job, I did nothing but
meet with the CDC staff. I
met with each of them for an
hour and I have 26 full-time
people plus all of our gradu
ate students and our under
graduate students. For the
three to four weeks that fol
lowed, I have been trekking
on campus meetings with
faculty, university adminis
trators, deans, department
heads, students [and] alumni.
I'm in the process of es
tablishing a steering commit
tee that's going to steer this
vision process. I'm calling it
"Vision 2020." The idea is
what should career services
look like in 2020? And I'm go
ing to use this steering com
mittee to flush out the ideas
that I have and to establish a
strong vision for our future
and to begin working on the
strategic plan. We have a big
challenge here and lots of
ideas that are floating
around but I'm very intent
on using input from our cam
pus community as I develop
this vision in a very thought
ful process. So it would be
irresponsible for me at
Week Six to tell you what
type of changes I plan to
make. That's not the type of
leader I am.
TSD: How does your role at
Stanford differ from your
previous jobs at Carnegie
Mellon and the University
of Florida? What differ
ences have you found?
FD: I think what makes
this place unique is that there
is interest from the Stanford
community in creating a new
vision for career services at
Stanford, and there are lots
of people in this community
campus partners, faculty
students [and] CDC staff —
who are eager to see what
that would be like and are ea
ger to contribute to it.
The other thing that
makes it unique is the type of
institution that we're in. This
is a wonderful institution that
is based on innovation. Our
location in terms of career
services gives us very unique
opportunities being in the
heart of Silicon Valley. Our
connections with the industry
can be leveraged not only for
opportunities for students in
technical fields but also for
students in other types of
fields.
We have an opportunity
here in the area of career
services at Stanford to pres
ent that model, to be the bea
con for all these career com
munities, and my hope is that
by working with all of the
campus community members
and the CDC staff [we can]
find away to tap into that, to
become that beacon for all of
them, to help establish this
new model.
TSD: In 2010, you and your
colleague Matt Real re
ceived the NACE 2010 Ex
cellence in Research Inno
vation award for your paper
"Emerging Trends in Uni
versity Career Services:
Adaptations of Casella's
Career Centers Paradigm."
What is this paper about
and how does research play
in your job?
FD: My co-researcher
and I were curious about how
career centers have evolved
over the years, career servic
es on college campuses.
When was the first time ca
reer centers started being es
tablished and how did they
evolve? Not only the histori
cal perspective but we also
presented our projections,
our predictions for what ca
reer centers would look like
in the future.
What we published upon
is that our field started with
the GI bills after World War
II when college campuses
needed to figure out how to
place all these military ser

vicemen who came back to
college campuses. Essential
ly our career centers during
that time were mainly place
ment offices with the sole re
sponsibility of placing gradu
ates in jobs and that was it.
And then they have evolved
into career development cen
ters that were more engaged
in the idea of counseling peo
ple and helping them explore
options and having more staff
and what was driving all of
that was the idea of counsel
ing and helping the person
get those jobs. In the 2000s,
the introduction of new tech
nology brought that network
ing into the social world and
we called it the social net
working paradigm.
We learned that technolo
gy has changed the way ca
reer services are provided on
college campuses. We've
learned that the partnership
and collaboration with aca
demic departments is critical
and crucial. Faculty and aca
demic administrators are key
partners and also what we
learned is that the field
changed as students change
and as the economy changes
around us.
Many campuses started
researching out and asking
for our opinions and thoughts
and consultation and that was
a really positive thing. With
the economic downturn, there
were [fewer] jobs available
for college graduates so uni
versities in general paid more
attention to this area of ca
reer development and career
services for college students
and wanted to know how it's
been offered and what are the
current and future trends. As
a result of that there's now an
opportunity on campuses like
here at Stanford to rethink
what we're doing and think
ing and envision a new future
and a new model based on all
of the changes.
TSD: Do you have any ca
reer tips to Stanford stu
dents still looking for sum
mer jobs?
FD: The first one is that
internships are critical for
their future success and ab
solutely try to find intern
ships that would relate to
their interests and what they
want to do. Our research
shows that eight out of 10 in
ternships usually lead to a full
time position that's secured

by graduation. Companies
tend to turn 61 percent of
their internships into full
time [jobs]. It's a very effec
tive way for companies to re
cruit their future talent by
hiring interns.
The second piece of advice
is that it doesn't have to be an
internship. The idea here is to
network. There's this theory
called Happenstance theory,
which was developed by [Pro
fessor of Education] John
Ki'umboltz. Krumboltz talked
about in his theory that most
of us will find our careers by
this idea of chance, but chance
doesn't have to happen ran
domly and it doesn't have to
happen by accident. What you
could do is engage in certain
activities and take action in
order to lure chance out of
hiding.
I want students to engage
in opportunities that will help
lure chance out of hiding for
them and that is all based on a
theory that was developed
right here at Stanford. The
bottom line is move [and] act
because that will decrease the
likelihood that train of oppor
tunity will pass you by.
TSD: The popularity of un
dergraduate majors often
seems to map closely to cur
rent job market. If you were
to look 10 years into the fu
ture, what do you think
would be the biggest differ
ence in how Stanford stu
dents prepare for their ca
reers?
FD: My prediction, I
would hope, would be that
students will base their ca
reer decisions based on who
they are as people and based
on what they are passionate
about, what they're interest
ed in and all of the skills that
they develop in and outside
the classroom. In fact, what I
would hope is that they would
use them entire experience
here at Stanford to try to
learn in addition to the aca
demic and theory skills they
are gaining. They would learn
leadership, communication,
problem solving, teamwork
skills, all of these types of
abilities that they learn from
their involvement in student
organizations, residential pro
grams, fraternities and soror
ities, internships, part-time
jobs and volunteering oppor
tunities, friendships, etc.
They need to think about

their life and career develop
ment with the same level of
complexity that they use to
think about their academics
or other things they're en
gaged in. I don't want these
economic trends that we're
seeing... to change the spirit
of our college students. Be
cause if it's not something
they are truly passionate
about, they can still choose it
but will they be great at it?
The last thing I would say
is that a lot of recruiters that
I speak with... tell us that
they don't discriminate based
on academic discipline. When
they are here to recruit,
they're usually looking for
strong communication, verbal
and written, leadership, prob
lem-solving skills. They want
those types of students re
gardless the type of major
and that's for the most pail
There are obviously those
technical fields that require
certain skill levels that stu
dents need to get them but in
general students have much
more opportunities in front of
them than they realize.
TSD: Career fairs at Stan
ford are known for attract
ing many more companies
interested in hiring engi
neering students com
puter science students in
particular and fewer in
terested in hiring students
who study other subjects.
What can or should the
CDC do to address this dis
parity?
FD: We offer 16 career
fairs a year not all of them
are for engineering. I would
actually argue that we are
among the schools that offer
the highest number of career
fairs with the widest variety.
I think what I'm learning
from my listening tour over
the last six weeks is that the
campus community doesn't
know of everything that is
offered in the career center.
So therefore these percep
tions get built up that we on
ly offer career fairs for tech
nical majors, which is not
true. We offer a wide variety
of career fairs and we need to
do a better job at telling the
story of these career fairs.

ment offices with the sole re
sponsibility of placing gradu
ates in jobs and that was it.
And then they have evolved
into career development cen
ters that were more engaged
in the idea of counseling peo
ple and helping them explore
options and having more staff
and what was driving all of
that was the idea of counsel
ing and helping the person
get those jobs. In the 2000s,
the introduction of new tech
nology brought that network
ing into the social world and
we called it the social net
working paradigm.
We learned that technolo
gy has changed the way ca
reer services are provided on
college campuses. We've
learned that the partnership
and collaboration with aca
demic departments is critical
and crucial. Faculty and aca
demic administrators are key
partners and also what we
learned is that the field
changed as students change
and as the economy changes
around us.
Many campuses started
researching out and asking
for our opinions and thoughts
and consultation and that was
a really positive thing. With
the economic downturn, there
were [fewer] jobs available
for college graduates so uni
versities in general paid more
attention to this area of ca
reer development and career
services for college students
and wanted to know how it's
been offered and what are the
current and future trends. As
a result of that there's now an
opportunity on campuses like
here at Stanford to rethink
what we're doing and think
ing and envision a new future
and a new model based on all
of the changes.
TSD: Do you have any ca
reer tips to Stanford stu
dents still looking for sum
mer jobs?
FD: The first one is that
internships are critical for
their future success and ab
solutely try to find intern
ships that would relate to
their interests and what they
want to do. Our research
shows that eight out of 10 in
ternships usually lead to a full
time position that's secured

by graduation. Companies
tend to turn 61 percent of
their internships into full
time [jobs]. It's a very effec
tive way for companies to re
cruit their future talent by
hiring interns.
The second piece of advice
is that it doesn't have to be an
internship. The idea here is to
network. There's this theory
called Happenstance theory,
which was developed by [Pro
fessor of Education] John
Ki'umboltz. Krumboltz talked
about in his theory that most
of us will find our careers by
this idea of chance, but chance
doesn't have to happen ran
domly and it doesn't have to
happen by accident. What you
could do is engage in certain
activities and take action in
order to lure chance out of
hiding.
I want students to engage
in opportunities that will help
lure chance out of hiding for
them and that is all based on a
theory that was developed
right here at Stanford. The
bottom line is move [and] act
because that will decrease the
likelihood that train of oppor
tunity will pass you by.
TSD: The popularity of un
dergraduate majors often
seems to map closely to cur
rent job market. If you were
to look 10 years into the fu
ture, what do you think
would be the biggest differ
ence in how Stanford stu
dents prepare for their ca
reers?
FD: My prediction, I
would hope, would be that
students will base their ca
reer decisions based on who
they are as people and based
on what they are passionate
about, what they're interest
ed in and all of the skills that
they develop in and outside
the classroom. In fact, what I
would hope is that they would
use them entire experience
here at Stanford to try to
learn in addition to the aca
demic and theory skills they
are gaining. They would learn
leadership, communication,
problem solving, teamwork
skills, all of these types of
abilities that they learn from
their involvement in student
organizations, residential pro
grams, fraternities and soror
ities, internships, part-time
jobs and volunteering oppor
tunities, friendships, etc.
They need to think about

their life and career develop
ment with the same level of
complexity that they use to
think about their academics
or other things they're en
gaged in. I don't want these
economic trends that we're
seeing... to change the spirit
of our college students. Be
cause if it's not something
they are truly passionate
about, they can still choose it
but will they be great at it?
The last thing I would say
is that a lot of recruiters that
I speak with... tell us that
they don't discriminate based
on academic discipline. When
they are here to recruit,
they're usually looking for
strong communication, verbal
and written, leadership, prob
lem-solving skills. They want
those types of students re
gardless the type of major
and that's for the most pail
There are obviously those
technical fields that require
certain skill levels that stu
dents need to get them but in
general students have much
more opportunities in front of
them than they realize.
TSD: Career fairs at Stan
ford are known for attract
ing many more companies
interested in hiring engi
neering students com
puter science students in
particular and fewer in
terested in hiring students
who study other subjects.
What can or should the
CDC do to address this dis
parity?
FD: We offer 16 career
fairs a year not all of them
are for engineering. I would
actually argue that we are
among the schools that offer
the highest number of career
fairs with the widest variety.
I think what I'm learning
from my listening tour over
the last six weeks is that the
campus community doesn't
know of everything that is
offered in the career center.
So therefore these percep
tions get built up that we on
ly offer career fairs for tech
nical majors, which is not
true. We offer a wide variety
of career fairs and we need to
do a better job at telling the
story of these career fairs.

@ Stanford, eda,
Farouk Dey is the new director
of the Career Development Center
(CDC), having joined the University
from Carnegie Mellon last month.
The Daily sat down with Dey to dis
cuss his career, time at Stanford to
date and plans for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): When
and what made you want to go in
to career services?
Farouk Dey (FD): I tried a... in
ternship in career services ca
reer counseling to college students
to help them with them passions
and I found that very energizing. I
liked the idea of working with col
lege students about their potential
and what they could become. I fell in
love with the work and the idea that
you could work with people on opti
mistic issues on what they could be
come in their lives.
TSD: Six weeks into this job, what
have you learned so far?
FD: What I have learned is that
there is tremendous potential here
tremendous talent. I've been im
pressed with the talent of the staff
at the CDC. I've been impressed
with how eager the campus commu
nity is for our growing vision of ca
reer services at Stanford. I think
even the CDC staff are proud of
their accomplishments for the many
years but they're also eager for a
new direction, for a future direction.
[The] staff has done great work
but there is [an] opportunity for us
to grow and to bring more opportu
nities to students and alumni. There
are other offices that intersect with
the world of career development
that we could collaborate more with,
opportunities to collaborate more
with alumni and the alumni office. I
think there are opportunities for us
to enhance services for graduate
students particularly and for stu
dents who are in fields that may
seem underrepresented in the world
of work.
TSD: What specific changes
would you like to make to the CD-
C's current functions or program
ming?
FD: I'll have to be honest
with you that it's too early for
that. I've been here for exact
ly six weeks so I am in the
process of engaging with the
campus-wide listening tour. If
you talk to any leader who
tells you within their first few
weeks that they already have
a plan for changes and vision
for the future that's already
established and that they're
ready to go, I would be con
cerned, personally, for that
type of leadership. I truly be
lieve that leadership is in
spired by listening to people,
giving people the opportunity
to voice their thoughts and
their concerns and allowing
the opinions to inspire the
changes and the vision for the
future.
For the first two weeks on
the job, I did nothing but
meet with the CDC staff. I
met with each of them for an
hour and I have 26 full-time
people plus all of our gradu
ate students and our under
graduate students. For the
three to four weeks that fol
lowed, I have been trekking
on campus meetings with
faculty, university adminis
trators, deans, department
heads, students [and] alumni.
I'm in the process of es
tablishing a steering commit
tee that's going to steer this
vision process. I'm calling it
"Vision 2020." The idea is
what should career services
look like in 2020? And I'm go
ing to use this steering com
mittee to flush out the ideas
that I have and to establish a
strong vision for our future
and to begin working on the
strategic plan. We have a big
challenge here and lots of
ideas that are floating
around but I'm very intent
on using input from our cam
pus community as I develop
this vision in a very thought
ful process. So it would be
irresponsible for me at
Week Six to tell you what
type of changes I plan to
make. That's not the type of
leader I am.
TSD: How does your role at
Stanford differ from your
previous jobs at Carnegie
Mellon and the University
of Florida? What differ
ences have you found?
FD: I think what makes
this place unique is that there
is interest from the Stanford
community in creating a new
vision for career services at
Stanford, and there are lots
of people in this community
campus partners, faculty
students [and] CDC staff —
who are eager to see what
that would be like and are ea
ger to contribute to it.
The other thing that
makes it unique is the type of
institution that we're in. This
is a wonderful institution that
is based on innovation. Our
location in terms of career
services gives us very unique
opportunities being in the
heart of Silicon Valley. Our
connections with the industry
can be leveraged not only for
opportunities for students in
technical fields but also for
students in other types of
fields.
We have an opportunity
here in the area of career
services at Stanford to pres
ent that model, to be the bea
con for all these career com
munities, and my hope is that
by working with all of the
campus community members
and the CDC staff [we can]
find away to tap into that, to
become that beacon for all of
them, to help establish this
new model.
TSD: In 2010, you and your
colleague Matt Real re
ceived the NACE 2010 Ex
cellence in Research Inno
vation award for your paper
"Emerging Trends in Uni
versity Career Services:
Adaptations of Casella's
Career Centers Paradigm."
What is this paper about
and how does research play
in your job?
FD: My co-researcher
and I were curious about how
career centers have evolved
over the years, career servic
es on college campuses.
When was the first time ca
reer centers started being es
tablished and how did they
evolve? Not only the histori
cal perspective but we also
presented our projections,
our predictions for what ca
reer centers would look like
in the future.
What we published upon
is that our field started with
the GI bills after World War
II when college campuses
needed to figure out how to
place all these military ser

vicemen who came back to
college campuses. Essential
ly our career centers during
that time were mainly place
ment offices with the sole re
sponsibility of placing gradu
ates in jobs and that was it.
And then they have evolved

(CDC), having joined the University
from Carnegie Mellon last month.
The Daily sat down with Dey to dis
cuss his career, time at Stanford to
date and plans for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): When
and what made you want to go in
to career services?
Farouk Dey (FD): I tried a... in
ternship in career services ca
reer counseling to college students
to help them with them passions
and I found that very energizing. I
liked the idea of working with col
lege students about their potential
and what they could become. I fell in
love with the work and the idea that
you could work with people on opti
mistic issues on what they could be
come in their lives.
TSD: Six weeks into this job, what
have you learned so far?
FD: What I have learned is that
there is tremendous potential here
tremendous talent. I've been im
pressed with the talent of the staff
at the CDC. I've been impressed
with how eager the campus commu
nity is for our growing vision of ca
reer services at Stanford. I think
even the CDC staff are proud of
their accomplishments for the many
years but they're also eager for a
new direction, for a future direction.
[The] staff has done great work
but there is [an] opportunity for us
to grow and to bring more opportu
nities to students and alumni. There
are other offices that intersect with
the world of career development
that we could collaborate more with,
opportunities to collaborate more
with alumni and the alumni office. I
think there are opportunities for us
to enhance services for graduate
students particularly and for stu
dents who are in fields that may
seem underrepresented in the world
of work.
TSD: What specific changes
would you like to make to the CD-
C's current functions or program
ming?
FD: I'll have to be honest
with you that it's too early for
that. I've been here for exact
ly six weeks so I am in the
process of engaging with the
campus-wide listening tour. If
you talk to any leader who
tells you within their first few
weeks that they already have
a plan for changes and vision
for the future that's already
established and that they're
ready to go, I would be con
cerned, personally, for that
type of leadership. I truly be
lieve that leadership is in
spired by listening to people,
giving people the opportunity
to voice their thoughts and
their concerns and allowing
the opinions to inspire the
changes and the vision for the
future.
For the first two weeks on
the job, I did nothing but
meet with the CDC staff. I
met with each of them for an
hour and I have 26 full-time
people plus all of our gradu
ate students and our under
graduate students. For the
three to four weeks that fol
lowed, I have been trekking
on campus meetings with
faculty, university adminis
trators, deans, department
heads, students [and] alumni.
I'm in the process of es
tablishing a steering commit
tee that's going to steer this
vision process. I'm calling it
"Vision 2020." The idea is
what should career services
look like in 2020? And I'm go
ing to use this steering com
mittee to flush out the ideas
that I have and to establish a
strong vision for our future
and to begin working on the
strategic plan. We have a big
challenge here and lots of
ideas that are floating
around but I'm very intent
on using input from our cam
pus community as I develop
this vision in a very thought
ful process. So it would be
irresponsible for me at
Week Six to tell you what
type of changes I plan to
make. That's not the type of
leader I am.
TSD: How does your role at
Stanford differ from your
previous jobs at Carnegie
Mellon and the University
of Florida? What differ
ences have you found?
FD: I think what makes
this place unique is that there
is interest from the Stanford
community in creating a new
vision for career services at
Stanford, and there are lots
of people in this community
campus partners, faculty
students [and] CDC staff —
who are eager to see what
that would be like and are ea
ger to contribute to it.
The other thing that
makes it unique is the type of
institution that we're in. This
is a wonderful institution that
is based on innovation. Our
location in terms of career
services gives us very unique
opportunities being in the
heart of Silicon Valley. Our
connections with the industry
can be leveraged not only for
opportunities for students in
technical fields but also for
students in other types of
fields.
We have an opportunity
here in the area of career
services at Stanford to pres
ent that model, to be the bea
con for all these career com
munities, and my hope is that
by working with all of the
campus community members
and the CDC staff [we can]
find away to tap into that, to
become that beacon for all of
them, to help establish this
new model.
TSD: In 2010, you and your
colleague Matt Real re
ceived the NACE 2010 Ex
cellence in Research Inno
vation award for your paper
"Emerging Trends in Uni
versity Career Services:
Adaptations of Casella's
Career Centers Paradigm."
What is this paper about
and how does research play
in your job?
FD: My co-researcher
and I were curious about how
career centers have evolved
over the years, career servic
es on college campuses.
When was the first time ca
reer centers started being es
tablished and how did they
evolve? Not only the histori
cal perspective but we also
presented our projections,
our predictions for what ca
reer centers would look like
in the future.
What we published upon
is that our field started with
the GI bills after World War
II when college campuses
needed to figure out how to
place all these military ser

vicemen who came back to
college campuses. Essential
ly our career centers during
that time were mainly place
ment offices with the sole re
sponsibility of placing gradu
ates in jobs and that was it.
And then they have evolved
into career development cen
ters that were more engaged
in the idea of counseling peo
ple and helping them explore
options and having more staff
and what was driving all of
that was the idea of counsel
ing and helping the person
get those jobs. In the 2000s,
the introduction of new tech
nology brought that network
ing into the social world and
we called it the social net
working paradigm.
We learned that technolo
gy has changed the way ca
reer services are provided on
college campuses. We've
learned that the partnership
and collaboration with aca
demic departments is critical
and crucial. Faculty and aca
demic administrators are key
partners and also what we
learned is that the field
changed as students change
and as the economy changes
around us.
Many campuses started
researching out and asking
for our opinions and thoughts
and consultation and that was
a really positive thing. With
the economic downturn, there
were [fewer] jobs available
for college graduates so uni
versities in general paid more
attention to this area of ca
reer development and career
services for college students
and wanted to know how it's
been offered and what are the
current and future trends. As
a result of that there's now an
opportunity on campuses like
here at Stanford to rethink
what we're doing and think
ing and envision a new future
and a new model based on all
of the changes.
TSD: Do you have any ca
reer tips to Stanford stu
dents still looking for sum
mer jobs?
FD: The first one is that
internships are critical for
their future success and ab
solutely try to find intern
ships that would relate to
their interests and what they
want to do. Our research
shows that eight out of 10 in
ternships usually lead to a full
time position that's secured

by graduation. Companies
tend to turn 61 percent of
their internships into full
time [jobs]. It's a very effec
tive way for companies to re
cruit their future talent by
hiring interns.
The second piece of advice
is that it doesn't have to be an
internship. The idea here is to
network. There's this theory
called Happenstance theory,
which was developed by [Pro
fessor of Education] John
Ki'umboltz. Krumboltz talked
about in his theory that most
of us will find our careers by
this idea of chance, but chance
doesn't have to happen ran
domly and it doesn't have to
happen by accident. What you
could do is engage in certain
activities and take action in
order to lure chance out of
hiding.
I want students to engage
in opportunities that will help
lure chance out of hiding for
them and that is all based on a
theory that was developed
right here at Stanford. The
bottom line is move [and] act
because that will decrease the
likelihood that train of oppor
tunity will pass you by.
TSD: The popularity of un
dergraduate majors often
seems to map closely to cur
rent job market. If you were
to look 10 years into the fu
ture, what do you think
would be the biggest differ
ence in how Stanford stu
dents prepare for their ca
reers?
FD: My prediction, I
would hope, would be that
students will base their ca
reer decisions based on who
they are as people and based
on what they are passionate
about, what they're interest
ed in and all of the skills that
they develop in and outside
the classroom. In fact, what I
would hope is that they would
use them entire experience
here at Stanford to try to
learn in addition to the aca
demic and theory skills they
are gaining. They would learn
leadership, communication,
problem solving, teamwork
skills, all of these types of
abilities that they learn from
their involvement in student
organizations, residential pro
grams, fraternities and soror
ities, internships, part-time
jobs and volunteering oppor
tunities, friendships, etc.
They need to think about

their life and career develop
ment with the same level of
complexity that they use to
think about their academics
or other things they're en
gaged in. I don't want these
economic trends that we're
seeing... to change the spirit
of our college students. Be
cause if it's not something
they are truly passionate
about, they can still choose it
but will they be great at it?
The last thing I would say
is that a lot of recruiters that
I speak with... tell us that
they don't discriminate based
on academic discipline. When
they are here to recruit,
they're usually looking for
strong communication, verbal
and written, leadership, prob
lem-solving skills. They want
those types of students re
gardless the type of major
and that's for the most pail
There are obviously those
technical fields that require
certain skill levels that stu
dents need to get them but in
general students have much
more opportunities in front of
them than they realize.
TSD: Career fairs at Stan
ford are known for attract
ing many more companies
interested in hiring engi
neering students com
puter science students in
particular and fewer in
terested in hiring students
who study other subjects.
What can or should the
CDC do to address this dis
parity?
FD: We offer 16 career
fairs a year not all of them
are for engineering. I would
actually argue that we are
among the schools that offer
the highest number of career
fairs with the widest variety.
I think what I'm learning
from my listening tour over
the last six weeks is that the
campus community doesn't
know of everything that is
offered in the career center.
So therefore these percep
tions get built up that we on
ly offer career fairs for tech
nical majors, which is not
true. We offer a wide variety
of career fairs and we need to
do a better job at telling the
story of these career fairs.
