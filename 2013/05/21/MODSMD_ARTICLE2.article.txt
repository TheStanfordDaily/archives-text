## FAROUK DEY DIRECTOR OF THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT CENTER 
### SOO JI LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Farouk Dey is the new director
of the Career Development Center
(CDC), having joined the University
from Carnegie Mellon last month.
The Daily sat down with Dey to dis
cuss his career, time at Stanford to
date and plans for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): When
and what made you want to go in
to career services?
Farouk Dey (FD): I tried a... in
ternship in career services ca
reer counseling to college students
to help them with them passions
and I found that very energizing. I
liked the idea of working with col
lege students about their potential
and what they could become. I fell in
love with the work and the idea that
you could work with people on opti
mistic issues on what they could be
come in their lives.
TSD: Six weeks into this job, what
have you learned so far?
FD: What I have learned is that
there is tremendous potential here
tremendous talent. I've been im
pressed with the talent of the staff
at the CDC. I've been impressed
with how eager the campus commu
nity is for our growing vision of ca
reer services at Stanford. I think
even the CDC staff are proud of
their accomplishments for the many
years but they're also eager for a
new direction, for a future direction.
[The] staff has done great work
but there is [an] opportunity for us
to grow and to bring more opportu
nities to students and alumni. There
are other offices that intersect with
the world of career development
that we could collaborate more with,
opportunities to collaborate more
with alumni and the alumni office. I
think there are opportunities for us
to enhance services for graduate
students particularly and for stu
dents who are in fields that may
seem underrepresented in the world
of work.
TSD: What specific changes
would you like to make to the CD-
C's current functions or program
ming?
