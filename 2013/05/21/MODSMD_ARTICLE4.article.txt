### WILL SEATON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With every player and coach from
both sides watching on, freshman
Krista Hardebeck battled back from
the blink of defeat for a miraculous
comeback victory to clinch No. 12
Stanford women's tennis' upset of
the top-ranked Florida Gators in the
semifinals of the NCAA Tourna
ment on Monday.
Hardebeck trailed 6-7, 1-5, with
Stanford looking for a win from ei
ther the freshman or sophomore
Ellen Tsay on Court No. 5 to clinch
the match. Against all odds, Harde
beck battled back, breaking Flori
da's Alexandra Cercone twice in a
row to even the set at 5-5. Harde
beck eventually won the set in a
tiebreak.
Early in Hardebeck's third set,
Florida tied the overall match 3-3

with a win on Court No. 5, putting
Hardebeck's Court No. 3 on center
stage. And Hardebeck shined in the
spotlight, dominating the third set
en route to a 6-7 (5), 7-6 (5), 6-3 vic
tory. When the final point ended,
Hardebeck threw her hands in the
aii* and met the rush of teammates
mobbing her to start the celebration
after a grueling four-and-a-half
hour match.
Florida is the third consecutive
top-five team that Stanford has up
set to get to the finals after wins
over No. 5 Southern California (4-3)
and No. 4 Georgia (4-1) over the
weekend. The Cardinal will face No.

The road to the NCAA Champi
onship seems to go through the
Florida Gators every year. In 2010,
Stanford defeated the Gators for its
16th NCAA championship. The year
after, the Gators returned the favor,
ending Stanford's 184-match home
winning streak and taking the title
4-3.
This year, the matchup took
place in the Final Four, with both
teams fighting to earn a spot in the
NCAA Final.
Despite playing its third match
in four days, Stanford got off to a
strong start. The top tandem of jun
ior Nicole Gibbs and junior Kristie
Ahn got ahead in its doubles match
early and continued to widen the
gap. Gibbs and Ahn were first off
the court with an 8-3 victory.
At the second spot, Tsay and
senior Stacey Tan ended with an

equally dominant 8-3 victory The
duo broke Florida's serve at 6-3 to
put the match out of reach, closing
it out on a serve.
Singles proved to be a very
mixed bag early on. Gibbs, Ahn and
Dillon all got off to fantastic starts.
Gibbs' opponent, No. 1 Lauren Em
bree, didn't score a single game in
the first set, while Ahn and Dillon
lost only one game each.
But Tsay and Tan both struggled
in their first sets, with neither win
ning more than two games.
Gibbs was first done with a 6-0,
6-1 victory over Embree. Continu
ing Stanford's trend of dominant
juniors, Ahn earned Stanford's
third point of the day with a 6-1,6-4
victory, putting the Cardinal just
one win away from the final.
That's when Florida began its

first point of the day. Dillon

she quickly dropped her next

Janowicz broke Tsay, with the
help of two Tsay double faults
and a final shot going too
long.
Stanford and Florida were
tied at 3-3.
But Hardebeck, who had
clinched five previous match
es for the Cardinal includ
ing Stanford's quarterfinal
win over Georgia on Sunday
before the Final Four, was
clawing her way back.
Leading Stanford with 33
wins on the year, Hardebeck
was a reliable player to have
in this pressure-packed mo
ment.
In the decisive third set,
Hardebeck and her opponent
both held serve until 3-3.

Hardebeck had a chance for a
break at 30-40 before hitting
her backhand long. Harde
beck quickly atoned for that
mistake, taking the next two
points to get the crucial break
and the next two games to
take the match.
Stanford faces No. 3 Texas
A&M, which defeated No. 4
UCLA 4-3 in dramatic fash
ion as well on Monday
evening, today for the NCAA
title. Stanford, which has not
yet won an NCAA team title

looking to extend its 36-year
streak of winning at least one
NCAA title. Today's final is
Stanford's best remaining op
portunity.
