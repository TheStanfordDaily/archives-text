# Menlo citizens protest project
## 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Despite the University's decision to modify its
proposal for a mixed-use development project at
500 El Camino Real, many Menlo Park citizens
remain unsatisfied with Stanford's plan and have
continued to publicly protest the project.
University administrators and local govern
ment officials continue to differ, meanwhile, on
whether further revisions will take place before
the project moves forward.
The revised proposal, which was released in
April, featured several significant changes to the
previous development plan, including the reduc
tion of medical office space from 96,000 square
feet to 27,000 square feet, the addition of 22 apart
ment units and revisions to the design of a public
plaza.
Though these modifications addressed some
of the citizens' concerns, including the potential
influx of traffic and a worsened housing deficit,
Menlo Park resident Perla Ni, the spokesperson
for a grassroots group called Save Menlo Park,
said that the alterations were not drastic enough.
"No one was happy with those changes," Ni
said. "So many people believed that the revision
was wholly inadequate to address the needs in the
community."
The revisions were presented at an April 16
Menlo Park City Council meeting that lasted un
til 2 a.m. At the meeting, the City Council formed
a subcommittee composed of two members,
Kirsten Keith and Catherine Carlton, to further
explore the proposal.

Keith said one of the subcommittee's primary
responsibilities will be communicating with the
many parties who have a stake in the issue.
"What I'm interested in doing is working with
Stanford and our neighborhood groups to come
up with something that will be a benefit for our
community and for Stanford," Keith said. "People
don't want to see vacant lots on El Camino Real.
They want to see something done with those lots
that is a benefit to Menlo Park."
Citizens' expectations still unfulfilled
While Keith said that she saw several signifi
cant improvements in Stanford's most recent pro
posal, particularly with respect to the public plaza,
Planning Commission Chair John Kadvany said
that he, like Ni, had expected more revisions.
"Everybody was expecting something pretty
significant there, and what Stanford has proposed
is sort of a pitiful excuse for a public plaza," Kad

vany said. "In terms of public social space, it is
just pathetic. That's strong language, but vibrant
public spaces and street life is what Menlo Park
wants."
According to Kadvany, citizens' expectations
were also not met with regards to the quantity of
housing units and the installation of a hotel and
senior living complex, which had been discussed
at several informal meetings.
Kadvany noted that citizens were also disap
pointed with the fact that it would be difficult to
integrate a bike and pedestrian tunnel into the
current design.
"There is no expression here of any interest in
contemporary design and planning issues. It's re
ally kind of appalling for a world-class university,"
he said. "Really all they care about are the leases
they get from the office space and the rents from

the housing. This was de
signed by a spreadsheet in
which the bottom line is what
revenue this provides for
Stanford."
Kadvany's sentiments
were echoed by City Council
member Rich Cline, who
said that he was surprised
by many components of the
proposal at a City Council
meeting in early April. Ni
agreed that the University
had "misrepresented its de
velopment intentions" to the
City Council.
"The original representa
tion they had made for the
city was that this project
would be for the desperately
needed housing in this area,"
Ni said. "After receiving enor
mous concessions that are
worth hundreds of million of
dollars in development rights,
they decided to change then
use to office [space], which is
nothing. Nobody needs more
offices in this area. We need
more housing."
Compliance with the Specif
ic Plan
Stanford's proposal com
plies with the stipulations of
the Specific Plan, a "frame
work for private and public
improvements" to Menlo
Park over the next few
decades, according to the
plan's summary.
However, Kadvany said
that compared to previous de
velopment projects, the plan
allows Stanford far too much
leeway, as there is no frame
work for a negotiation process
if the proposal meets the
plan's criteria.
"We just gave the criteria
with basically no control,"
Kadvany said. "There is
something called architectur
al control, which means the
Planning Commission can cri
tique the buildings in terms of
aesthetics, but not a whole lot
else. On the whole, all we have
is this aesthetic dimension."
Though Kadvany voted in
favor of the Specific Plan,
which was approved by the
City Council in June 2012, he
now argues that the process
should have been designed to
"give us a lot more control,"
perhaps by creating addition
al review opportunities for
large projects like Stanford's
proposal.
"We could have built in
safeguards against the in
credible leverage that Stan
ford now has in this project,"
he said. "The basic parame
ters are fine, but the city has
to have more control. You
can't give away all your nego
tiating power it's totally ir
responsible. The idea that the
City Council can live with this
raises eyebrows, to say the
least."
While Kadvany suggested
potentially revising the Spe
cific Plan, Menlo Park resi
dent Clem Molony, who said
he went to "most of the meet
ings" during the four-year pe
riod over which the Specific

Plan was formed, offered a
more positive outlook on the
process.
"Generally when a Specific
Plan is done as carefully as
ours was done, they thought
about this and looked at the
cumulative impact of all the
development on traffic and
figured out it is going to be
okay," Molony said.
Although Molony ac
knowledged the concerns of
citizen groups like Save Men
lo Park, particularly about
traffic, he said he has faith
that the City Council will "fig
ure that out."
"This proposal is being
fine-tuned right now and the
planning process is really ro
bust," he said. "The neighbors
will find, once it's built, that
the impacts are not as terrible
as all the exaggerators say. I
am sure this is going to be a
very beneficial project for
Menlo Park."
Obstacles to construction
As well as meeting with
Stanford officials and commu
nity members, the City Coun
cil's subcommittee will con
duct a larger traffic study to
analyze potential cut-through
traffic impacts, which Keith
said will take "many, many
weeks." The Specific Plan will
also be reviewed by the City
Council in June.
While Keith said that she
expects more revisions to be
made to the proposal, Manag
ing Director of Development
Steve Elliott emphasized that
Stanford does not intend to
make any more modifications
based on citizen requests.
According to Elliott, Stan
ford officials have already met
with representatives from
Save Menlo Park, the Sierra
Club, the Chamber of Com
merce and bicycle advocates,
as well as other Menlo Park
citizens, and "have listened
carefully to the community."
"We're not planning on
making any more revisions.
We are waiting for the city to
do their work with their sub
committee and we are waiting
to hear back on that," Elliott
said. "We still have to get ar
chitectural control approval
for the project, we still have a
ways to go to get approval,
but we don't have any plans at
this time for an alternative
project."
However, Elliott noted
that there are several more
obstacles to be overcome be
fore construction begins, in
cluding getting confirmation
from the Planning Commis
sion that the proposal is con
sistent with the Specific Plan,
completing the traffic study,
creating a housing agreement
with the city and acquiring
building permits.
"[The timeline is] pretty
dependent on what the City
Council and their subcommit
tee does and how quickly that
moves along," Elliott said.
"There is a lot of uncertainty
at this point so it is really hard
to say when we might start
construction, though we prefer
to start it as soon as possible."
