# Menlo citizens protest project

### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Despite the University's decision to modify its
proposal for a mixed-use development project at
500 El Camino Real, many Menlo Park citizens
remain unsatisfied with Stanford's plan and have
continued to publicly protest the project.
University administrators and local govern
ment officials continue to differ, meanwhile, on
whether further revisions will take place before
the project moves forward.
The revised proposal, which was released in
April, featured several significant changes to the
previous development plan, including the reduc
tion of medical office space from 96,000 square
feet to 27,000 square feet, the addition of 22 apart
ment units and revisions to the design of a public
plaza.
Though these modifications addressed some
of the citizens' concerns, including the potential
influx of traffic and a worsened housing deficit,
Menlo Park resident Perla Ni, the spokesperson
for a grassroots group called Save Menlo Park,
said that the alterations were not drastic enough.
"No one was happy with those changes," Ni
said. "So many people believed that the revision
was wholly inadequate to address the needs in the
community."
The revisions were presented at an April 16
Menlo Park City Council meeting that lasted un
til 2 a.m. At the meeting, the City Council formed
a subcommittee composed of two members,
Kirsten Keith and Catherine Carlton, to further
explore the proposal.

Keith said one of the subcommittee's primary
responsibilities will be communicating with the
many parties who have a stake in the issue.
"What I'm interested in doing is working with
Stanford and our neighborhood groups to come
up with something that will be a benefit for our
community and for Stanford," Keith said. "People
don't want to see vacant lots on El Camino Real.
They want to see something done with those lots
that is a benefit to Menlo Park."
Citizens' expectations still unfulfilled
While Keith said that she saw several signifi
cant improvements in Stanford's most recent pro
posal, particularly with respect to the public plaza,
Planning Commission Chair John Kadvany said
that he, like Ni, had expected more revisions.
"Everybody was expecting something pretty
significant there, and what Stanford has proposed
is sort of a pitiful excuse for a public plaza," Kad

vany said. "In terms of public social space, it is
just pathetic. That's strong language, but vibrant
public spaces and street life is what Menlo Park
wants."
According to Kadvany, citizens' expectations
were also not met with regards to the quantity of
housing units and the installation of a hotel and
senior living complex, which had been discussed
at several informal meetings.
Kadvany noted that citizens were also disap
pointed with the fact that it would be difficult to
integrate a bike and pedestrian tunnel into the
current design.
"There is no expression here of any interest in
contemporary design and planning issues. It's re
ally kind of appalling for a world-class university,"
he said. "Really all they care about are the leases
they get from the office space and the rents from
