## Prof, refutes alien origins of skeleton 
### CARA REICHARD DESK EDITOR 
Alien and UFO enthusiasts were
left disappointed again last month, as
Professor of Microbiology and Im
munology Garry Nolan Ph.D. 'B9 PD.
'B9 debunked theories of extraterres
trial origins surrounding a skeleton
found in Chile's Atacama Desert and
instead identified it as a humanoid.
The skeleton was featured promi
nently in the recent documentary
"Sirius," produced by Steven Greer,
founder of the Center for the Study
of Extraterrestrial Intelligence and
the Disclosure Project. The film is
based on Greer's efforts to reveal
government cover-ups of UFO sight
ings and extraterrestrial encounters.
Nolan was given the opportunity
to examine the skeleton after con
tacting the makers of "Sirius." The
skeleton in question is only six inches
long and possesses several unusual
characteristics, including an abnor
mally shaped head and an irregular
rib count, as it only has 10 ribs while
most humans have 12.
The producers agreed to send
Nolan pictures of the figure, which
Nolan described as "pretty spectacu
lar," after he offered to provide ge
nomics tools that could examine the
skeleton's DNA.
Though Nolan believed that the
Atacama skeleton, called "Ata," could
not possibly belong to an alien, part of
his agreement with the filmmakers
was to not be "pathologically skepti
cal" while conducting his research.
"I wouldn't enter this and at the
first sign of humanity throw every
thing out," Nolan said. "There were
anomalies and they needed to be
tracked down."
Beyond his curiosity in determin
ing the origin of the skeleton, Nolan
had personal motives for undertaking
the project. When he contacted the

film's producers, Nolan was about to
begin the process of setting up his lab
for cancer research, which he said
would "require sequence analysis of a
very similar, very comparable ap
proach."
"I literally hadn't touched a
pipette... for 20 years," Nolan said.
"So it was kind of like, 'do I still have
the hands?"'
Nolan took the pictures provided
by the filmmakers to his colleagues in
the neonatal care unit, who referred
him to Clinical Professor of Pediatric
Radiology Ralph Lachman, a special
ist in dwarfism.
Lachman runs the International
Skeletal Dysplasia Registry, which
contains information on about 15,000
different cases of dwarfism world
wide. Despite managing this enor
mous database, and seeing 700 or
800 cases of dwarfism every year,
Lachman was not sure what he was
looking at when first saw Ata.
'At that time, we didn't know if it

was an alien," Lachman said. "It did
n't look, even on the pictures, like a
normal human."
After gathering sufficient DNA
from the skeleton, Nolan ran the
DNA through an analyzer and com
pared the sequence with a human
reference genome, which he de
scribed as "sort of an average of all
of the genomes that have been ana
lyzed."
Nolan said that it was clear that
the specimen was human after the
genome analysis, though the re
searchers could still not explain the
skeleton's unusual characteristics.
Upon Lachman's request, Nolan
asked to see X-rays and CT scans
taken of the skeleton in Barcelona,
where it was stored. The images al
lowed Lachman to more accurately
understand the specimen's many ab
normalities.
One of the most perplexing ques
tions Lachman encountered was the
age of specimen at its time of death.

Its small size matched roughly that of
a 22-week-old fetus, but the high lev
el of calcification observed in the legs
suggested it was more likely a child
between the ages of five and eight
years old.
Lachman subsequently investi
gated several similar cases of
dwarfism throughout history and
found several, including a 19th centu
ry "circus freak" named Tom Thumb
and an Italian woman who was six
inches when she was born and 19
inches when she died at age eight or
nine.

According to Lachman, another
possible explanation for the skele
ton's small size and advanced calcifi
cation is natural mummification, a
process that would have made the
skeleton appear older than it is.
"The mummification process in
the Egyptians has produced calcifica
tion like this in the intervertebral
spaces," Lachman said. "Natural
mummification is probably a process

that occurs if you in a very dry desert
place. The body is lying there for sev
eral years, and it dries out and salts
are deposited. That can lead to calci
fication occurring."
Both Nolan and Lachman empha
sized that their research is not com
plete, as they proved that the speci
men is human but still cannot explain
all of its unusual characteristics.
Nolan, who said that the skeleton
displays a "rare mutation, if not one
of-a-kind," has contacted a re
searcher from Germany in hopes of
getting access to similar specimens in
order to compare their DNA with
Ata's.
"If I do the sequencing of those as
well, we could actually determine the
cause of this," he said. "If it had a sim
ilar mutation, similar genes, that
would be fantastic we would be able
to sort of solve the mystery."

Alien and UFO enthusiasts were
left disappointed again last month, as
Professor of Microbiology and Im
munology Garry Nolan Ph.D. 'B9 PD.
'B9 debunked theories of extraterres
trial origins surrounding a skeleton
found in Chile's Atacama Desert and
instead identified it as a humanoid.
The skeleton was featured promi
nently in the recent documentary
"Sirius," produced by Steven Greer,
founder of the Center for the Study
of Extraterrestrial Intelligence and
the Disclosure Project. The film is
based on Greer's efforts to reveal
government cover-ups of UFO sight
ings and extraterrestrial encounters.
Nolan was given the opportunity
to examine the skeleton after con
tacting the makers of "Sirius." The
skeleton in question is only six inches
long and possesses several unusual
characteristics, including an abnor
mally shaped head and an irregular
rib count, as it only has 10 ribs while
most humans have 12.
The producers agreed to send
Nolan pictures of the figure, which
Nolan described as "pretty spectacu
lar," after he offered to provide ge
nomics tools that could examine the
skeleton's DNA.
Though Nolan believed that the
Atacama skeleton, called "Ata," could
not possibly belong to an alien, part of
his agreement with the filmmakers
was to not be "pathologically skepti
cal" while conducting his research.
"I wouldn't enter this and at the
first sign of humanity throw every
thing out," Nolan said. "There were
anomalies and they needed to be
tracked down."
Beyond his curiosity in determin
ing the origin of the skeleton, Nolan
had personal motives for undertaking
the project. When he contacted the

film's producers, Nolan was about to
begin the process of setting up his lab
for cancer research, which he said
would "require sequence analysis of a
very similar, very comparable ap
proach."
"I literally hadn't touched a
pipette... for 20 years," Nolan said.
"So it was kind of like, 'do I still have
the hands?"'
Nolan took the pictures provided
by the filmmakers to his colleagues in
the neonatal care unit, who referred
him to Clinical Professor of Pediatric
Radiology Ralph Lachman, a special
ist in dwarfism.
Lachman runs the International
Skeletal Dysplasia Registry, which
contains information on about 15,000
different cases of dwarfism world
wide. Despite managing this enor
mous database, and seeing 700 or
800 cases of dwarfism every year,
Lachman was not sure what he was
looking at when first saw Ata.
'At that time, we didn't know if it

was an alien," Lachman said. "It did
n't look, even on the pictures, like a
normal human."
After gathering sufficient DNA
from the skeleton, Nolan ran the
DNA through an analyzer and com
pared the sequence with a human
reference genome, which he de
scribed as "sort of an average of all
of the genomes that have been ana
lyzed."
Nolan said that it was clear that
the specimen was human after the
genome analysis, though the re
searchers could still not explain the
skeleton's unusual characteristics.
Upon Lachman's request, Nolan
asked to see X-rays and CT scans
taken of the skeleton in Barcelona,
where it was stored. The images al
lowed Lachman to more accurately
understand the specimen's many ab
normalities.
One of the most perplexing ques
tions Lachman encountered was the
age of specimen at its time of death.

Its small size matched roughly that of
a 22-week-old fetus, but the high lev
el of calcification observed in the legs
suggested it was more likely a child
between the ages of five and eight
years old.
Lachman subsequently investi
gated several similar cases of
dwarfism throughout history and
found several, including a 19th centu
ry "circus freak" named Tom Thumb
and an Italian woman who was six
inches when she was born and 19
inches when she died at age eight or
nine.

According to Lachman, another
possible explanation for the skele
ton's small size and advanced calcifi
cation is natural mummification, a
process that would have made the
skeleton appear older than it is.
"The mummification process in
the Egyptians has produced calcifica
tion like this in the intervertebral
spaces," Lachman said. "Natural
mummification is probably a process

that occurs if you in a very dry desert
place. The body is lying there for sev
eral years, and it dries out and salts
are deposited. That can lead to calci
fication occurring."
Both Nolan and Lachman empha
sized that their research is not com
plete, as they proved that the speci
men is human but still cannot explain
all of its unusual characteristics.
Nolan, who said that the skeleton
displays a "rare mutation, if not one
of-a-kind," has contacted a re
searcher from Germany in hopes of
getting access to similar specimens in
order to compare their DNA with
Ata's.
"If I do the sequencing of those as
well, we could actually determine the
cause of this," he said. "If it had a sim
ilar mutation, similar genes, that
would be fantastic we would be able
to sort of solve the mystery."
