## Saluting the end of another soccer legend 
### Tom Taylor 
Just a week after Sir Alex Fer
guson retired from Ms job as
manager of Manchester
United, David Beckham has
also finally hung up Ms boots.
On Saturday Beckham played his
last home match for Paris Saint-Ger
main, the club he joined less than
four months ago. After walking off to
a standing ovation, it's likely he'll fin
ish on that high and not play to the
bitter end in PSG's final road match
this season at Lorient this Sunday.
Ferguson and Beckham's careers
were inextricably linked. Beckham
was lucky enough to play for both the
club he supported as a Md and Fer
guson at Umted. Over 10 years, six
Premier League titles, two FA cups
and a Champions League trophy lat
er, Ferguson also played a key role in
Beckham's exit, too.
After an F.A. Cup defeat to Arse
nal in 2003, Ferguson lost it in the
locker room, kicking a boot across
the room and accidently hitting
Beckham above the eye. It proved to
be the final nail in the coffin, and by
summer Beckham was on his way to
Real Madrid.
Arguably, Ferguson had the
greater success from then on an
other five Premier League titles and
one Champions League trophy com
pared to Beckham's single La Liga
title, two MLS Cups with Los Ange
les Galaxy and PSG's recent Ligue 1
win and deserves serious consid
eration for the title of best manager
of all time.
Beckham, meanwhile, was never
FIFA World Player of the Year even
once in his 20-year career, though
true all-time great Pele nominated
him among the 100 best living play
ers in 2004, and he never won the
greatest prize of all, a FIFA World
Cup.
But Beckham will still go down as
a true legend of the game; more than
anyone else, he defined what it
means to be a soccer superstar.
He was clearly a talented player,
but his status, his pop-star wife
Victoria Beckham, aka Posh Spice
and his worldwide appeal were every
bit as important. Real Madrid and
Galaxy paid so much for his services
because of his marketability his
lethal ability to cross the ball was an
added bonus.
Now that he has finally kicked his
last ball as a professional, it is that
image that will likely live on: the
global superstar who draws hoards
of fans no matter what and the
UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador
whose charitable works have extend
ed far beyond the confines of his
sport.
Away from the soccer field, the
manicured world of public relations
will brush over any of the blemishes
from his career.
But that's not the way I want to
remember it.
Back in 1998, a new kid on the in
ternational scene, Beckham so in
censed England fans for being sent
off for retaliating against Argentina's
Diego Simeone in the last 16 of the
World Cup that he even received
death threats.
Even as recently as last June I
got to see his temper flare up on the
field when the San Jose Earthquakes
hosted the Galaxy at Stanford Stadi
um. In the dying moments of the
game, with San Jose appealing to be
wasting time, Beckham deliberately
kicked a ball at the referee, who was
tending to an injured player.
But those moments weren't those
of an English-style soccer hooligan,
they were of a player who loved to
play so much that occasionally his
emotions would get the better of him.
It is hard to criticize any Englishman
for lashing out when faced with soc
cer arch-nemesis Argentina, and last
year, after working so tirelessly to
promote the 2012 London Olympics,
Beckham had just found out that he
would not be included in the British
soccer team at the Olympic Games.
It also appears that Beckham is
actually a good guy; I've even heard
reports of him pulling over to help a
stranded motorist change a tire. I
can't imagine many other multimil
lionaires even having those sorts of
rumors spread about them.
When he signed for Paris Saint-
Germain, some criticized the move,
after all, why was the French team
wasting money on an aging super
star well past his best?
But then Beckham donated his
entire salary to a local children's
charity and did what he does best,
putting his all into PSG's title bid. He

quickly won over the fans, and
many were sad that he spent
just a fleeting moment at
their club.
I never got to talk to Beck
ham last year at the Earth
quakes game. He refused to
give interviews because he
just didn't want to talk about
his exclusion from the
Olympics; it was still too raw.

But I can forgive him that.
He may not have brought
home that elusive World Cup,
but he put his heart and soul
into soccer. I would forgive a
few extra yellow and red
cards if only there were more
Beckhams out there.

bitter end in PSG's final road match
this season at Lorient this Sunday.
Ferguson and Beckham's careers
were inextricably linked. Beckham
was lucky enough to play for both the
club he supported as a Md and Fer
guson at Umted. Over 10 years, six
Premier League titles, two FA cups
and a Champions League trophy lat
er, Ferguson also played a key role in
Beckham's exit, too.
After an F.A. Cup defeat to Arse
nal in 2003, Ferguson lost it in the
locker room, kicking a boot across
the room and accidently hitting
Beckham above the eye. It proved to
be the final nail in the coffin, and by
summer Beckham was on his way to
Real Madrid.
Arguably, Ferguson had the
greater success from then on an
other five Premier League titles and
one Champions League trophy com
pared to Beckham's single La Liga
title, two MLS Cups with Los Ange
les Galaxy and PSG's recent Ligue 1
win and deserves serious consid
eration for the title of best manager
of all time.
Beckham, meanwhile, was never
FIFA World Player of the Year even
once in his 20-year career, though
true all-time great Pele nominated
him among the 100 best living play
ers in 2004, and he never won the
greatest prize of all, a FIFA World
Cup.
But Beckham will still go down as
a true legend of the game; more than
anyone else, he defined what it
means to be a soccer superstar.
He was clearly a talented player,
but his status, his pop-star wife
Victoria Beckham, aka Posh Spice
and his worldwide appeal were every
bit as important. Real Madrid and
Galaxy paid so much for his services
because of his marketability his
lethal ability to cross the ball was an
added bonus.
Now that he has finally kicked his
last ball as a professional, it is that
image that will likely live on: the
global superstar who draws hoards
of fans no matter what and the
UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador
whose charitable works have extend
ed far beyond the confines of his
sport.
Away from the soccer field, the
manicured world of public relations
will brush over any of the blemishes
from his career.
But that's not the way I want to
remember it.
Back in 1998, a new kid on the in
ternational scene, Beckham so in
censed England fans for being sent
off for retaliating against Argentina's
Diego Simeone in the last 16 of the
World Cup that he even received
death threats.
Even as recently as last June I
got to see his temper flare up on the
field when the San Jose Earthquakes
hosted the Galaxy at Stanford Stadi
um. In the dying moments of the
game, with San Jose appealing to be
wasting time, Beckham deliberately
kicked a ball at the referee, who was
tending to an injured player.
But those moments weren't those
of an English-style soccer hooligan,
they were of a player who loved to
play so much that occasionally his
emotions would get the better of him.
It is hard to criticize any Englishman
for lashing out when faced with soc
cer arch-nemesis Argentina, and last
year, after working so tirelessly to
promote the 2012 London Olympics,
Beckham had just found out that he
would not be included in the British
soccer team at the Olympic Games.
It also appears that Beckham is
actually a good guy; I've even heard
reports of him pulling over to help a
stranded motorist change a tire. I
can't imagine many other multimil
lionaires even having those sorts of
rumors spread about them.
When he signed for Paris Saint-
Germain, some criticized the move,
after all, why was the French team
wasting money on an aging super
star well past his best?
But then Beckham donated his
entire salary to a local children's
charity and did what he does best,
putting his all into PSG's title bid. He

quickly won over the fans, and
many were sad that he spent
just a fleeting moment at
their club.
I never got to talk to Beck
ham last year at the Earth
quakes game. He refused to
give interviews because he
just didn't want to talk about
his exclusion from the
Olympics; it was still too raw.

But I can forgive him that.
He may not have brought
home that elusive World Cup,
but he put his heart and soul
into soccer. I would forgive a
few extra yellow and red
cards if only there were more
Beckhams out there.
