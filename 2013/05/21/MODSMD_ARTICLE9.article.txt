# Season ends at Lincoln Regional
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Regional second-seed Stanford
softball defeated the third and
fourth seeds in the Lincoln Regional,
but top-seeded host No. 14 Nebras
ka proved too much, defeating the
Cardinal twice to end Stanford's sea
son in the regional round of the
NCAA Tournament.

In the first game of the regional
Friday, Stanford (39-21, 13-11 Pac
-12) defeated third-seeded Tulsa (42-
16-1,19-5 Conference USA) 4-2.
Tulsa jumped out to a 2-0 lead in
the top of the first, scoring two runs
off senior starting pitcher Teagan
Gerhart on a two-out two-RBI home
run by Tulsa first baseman Julie
Kernen. But that was the last run
Gerhart would allow.
Freshman catcher Jessica Plaza
homered to left field in the bottom of
the second, scoring sophomore desig
nated player Erin Ashby, to tie the
game at two. Three innings later, an
other freshman, first baseman Kayla
Bonstrom, hit a two-run homer to
give Stanford its first lead, 4-2.
Gerhart allowed only one more
baserunner, a two-out walk in the
sixth, after Bonstrom gave Stanford
the lead in closing out her complete
game victory.

On Saturday, Stanford took on
host Nebraska with a berth in the
Regional final on the line. Starting
for the second game in a row, Gerhart
gave up two runs on three hits in just
one-plus innings of work as the
Huskers took a 2-0 lead in the bottom
of the second inning.
But freshman pitcher Kelsey
Stevens stopped the bleeding after
the second, keeping Nebraska score
less over the next three innings. In
the top of the fifth, sophomore left
fielder Leah White knocked in fifth
year senior centerfielder Sarah Has
sman to cut the Nebraska lead in
half.
However, Stevens couldn't hold
off the Huskers' offense for much
longer. In the bottom of the sixth,
Nebraska scored five runs on four
hits to put the game out of reach,
winning by a final score of 7-2.
In the double-elimination format,
that meant Stanford would have to
beat third-seeded Northern lowa lat
er the same day and then top Ne
braska twice on Sunday to advance to
the Super Regionals.
Stanford took care of the first of
those victories Saturday, topping
Northern lowa (27-26,13-8 Missouri
Valley Conference) 4-1.
Gerhart bounced back from her
rough start earlier Saturday against
Nebraska for another complete
game victory. The senior allowed on
ly one run on four hits while picking
up 10 strikeouts, finishing Saturday

Senior starting pitcher Teagan Gerhart (above) started all four games
for Stanford, the last starts of her college career, but host Nebraska
proved too strong, topping Stanford twice to end the Cardinal's season.
