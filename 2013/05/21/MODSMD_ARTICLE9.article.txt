# Season ends at Lincoln Regional
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Regional second-seed Stanford
softball defeated the third and
fourth seeds in the Lincoln Regional,
but top-seeded host No. 14 Nebras
ka proved too much, defeating the
Cardinal twice to end Stanford's sea
son in the regional round of the
NCAA Tournament.

In the first game of the regional
Friday, Stanford (39-21, 13-11 Pac
-12) defeated third-seeded Tulsa (42-
16-1,19-5 Conference USA) 4-2.
Tulsa jumped out to a 2-0 lead in
the top of the first, scoring two runs
off senior starting pitcher Teagan
Gerhart on a two-out two-RBI home
run by Tulsa first baseman Julie
Kernen. But that was the last run
Gerhart would allow.
Freshman catcher Jessica Plaza
homered to left field in the bottom of
the second, scoring sophomore desig
nated player Erin Ashby, to tie the
game at two. Three innings later, an
other freshman, first baseman Kayla
Bonstrom, hit a two-run homer to
give Stanford its first lead, 4-2.
Gerhart allowed only one more
baserunner, a two-out walk in the
sixth, after Bonstrom gave Stanford
the lead in closing out her complete
game victory.

On Saturday, Stanford took on
host Nebraska with a berth in the
Regional final on the line. Starting
for the second game in a row, Gerhart
gave up two runs on three hits in just
one-plus innings of work as the
Huskers took a 2-0 lead in the bottom
of the second inning.
But freshman pitcher Kelsey
Stevens stopped the bleeding after
the second, keeping Nebraska score
less over the next three innings. In
the top of the fifth, sophomore left
fielder Leah White knocked in fifth
year senior centerfielder Sarah Has
sman to cut the Nebraska lead in
half.
However, Stevens couldn't hold
off the Huskers' offense for much
longer. In the bottom of the sixth,
Nebraska scored five runs on four
hits to put the game out of reach,
winning by a final score of 7-2.
In the double-elimination format,
that meant Stanford would have to
beat third-seeded Northern lowa lat
er the same day and then top Ne
braska twice on Sunday to advance to
the Super Regionals.
Stanford took care of the first of
those victories Saturday, topping
Northern lowa (27-26,13-8 Missouri
Valley Conference) 4-1.
Gerhart bounced back from her
rough start earlier Saturday against
Nebraska for another complete
game victory. The senior allowed on
ly one run on four hits while picking
up 10 strikeouts, finishing Saturday

pitched over the first two
days of the regional.
Stanford, the visiting
team for the game, struck
first in the top of the third in
ning. Bonstrom and senior
shortstop Jenna Rich each
picked up an RBI to give
Stanford a 2-0 lead. One in
ning later, the Cardinal cush

White's RBI groundout and
Bonstrom's RBI double.
Gerhart allowed one run

Sunday's contest, which
began 35 minutes late due to
weather, did not start out as
planned for the Cardinal. An
error on sophomore third
baseman Hanna Winter led
to an unearned Nebraska run
in the top of the first inning.

But the game quickly
turned in Stanford's favor, as
the Card scored three runs in
the bottom of the first on an
RBI single from Ashby and
two bases-loaded walks. Has

end the threat with the bases

Weather caused the game

runs only one earned due
to an error on Bonstrom

hart, who started on the
mound all four games this
past weekend. Another rain
delay briefly halted the ac
tion in the middle of the five
run inning.
"[Gerhart] pitched her
heart out today," said head
coach John Rittman, "and as
a coach that is all you can ask
for in difficult situations."
After Stanford fought
back within two runs in the
bottom of the fifth, Nebraska
put the game out of reach
with four more runs in the
sixth inning, eventually top

pling the Cardinal 10-5 to end
Stanford's season.
Gerhart gave way to

four earned on eight hits
and five walks in her final col

sixth, after Bonstrom gave Stanford
the lead in closing out her complete
game victory.

On Saturday, Stanford took on
host Nebraska with a berth in the
Regional final on the line. Starting
for the second game in a row, Gerhart
gave up two runs on three hits in just
one-plus innings of work as the
Huskers took a 2-0 lead in the bottom
of the second inning.
But freshman pitcher Kelsey
Stevens stopped the bleeding after
the second, keeping Nebraska score
less over the next three innings. In
the top of the fifth, sophomore left
fielder Leah White knocked in fifth
year senior centerfielder Sarah Has
sman to cut the Nebraska lead in
half.
However, Stevens couldn't hold
off the Huskers' offense for much
longer. In the bottom of the sixth,
Nebraska scored five runs on four
hits to put the game out of reach,
winning by a final score of 7-2.
In the double-elimination format,
that meant Stanford would have to
beat third-seeded Northern lowa lat
er the same day and then top Ne
braska twice on Sunday to advance to
the Super Regionals.
Stanford took care of the first of
those victories Saturday, topping
Northern lowa (27-26,13-8 Missouri
Valley Conference) 4-1.
Gerhart bounced back from her
rough start earlier Saturday against
Nebraska for another complete
game victory. The senior allowed on

up 10 strikeouts, finishing Saturday

with a total of 15 innings
pitched over the first two
days of the regional.
Stanford, the visiting
team for the game, struck
first in the top of the third in
ning. Bonstrom and senior
shortstop Jenna Rich each
picked up an RBI to give
Stanford a 2-0 lead. One in
ning later, the Cardinal cush
ioned its lead with two more
runs, this time coming off
White's RBI groundout and
Bonstrom's RBI double.
Gerhart allowed one run
on a double in the sixth, but
the lead was never in doubt
as Stanford secured a re
match against Nebraska in
Sunday's regional final.
Sunday's contest, which
began 35 minutes late due to
weather, did not start out as
planned for the Cardinal. An
error on sophomore third
baseman Hanna Winter led
to an unearned Nebraska run
in the top of the first inning.

But the game quickly
turned in Stanford's favor, as
the Card scored three runs in
the bottom of the first on an
RBI single from Ashby and
two bases-loaded walks. Has
sman struck out looking to
end the threat with the bases
still loaded.
Weather caused the game
to be delayed another hour
and 10 minutes before the top
of the second inning. After
three scoreless innings, Ne
braska took the lead with five
runs only one earned due
to an error on Bonstrom
in the top of the fifth off Ger
hart, who started on the
mound all four games this
past weekend. Another rain
delay briefly halted the ac
tion in the middle of the five
run inning.
"[Gerhart] pitched her
heart out today," said head
coach John Rittman, "and as
a coach that is all you can ask
for in difficult situations."
After Stanford fought
back within two runs in the
bottom of the fifth, Nebraska
put the game out of reach
with four more runs in the
sixth inning, eventually top

pling the Cardinal 10-5 to end
Stanford's season.
Gerhart gave way to
Stevens with two outs in the
sixth, allowing 10 runs
four earned on eight hits
and five walks in her final col
legiate game. Gerhart finish
es her career with a 101-45
record in 177 appearances.
Sunday's loss also meant
the end of three other Stan
ford careers. Rich, Hassman
and senior infielder Tegan
Schmidt, along with Gerhart,
will not return next season
after exhausting their eligi
bility. Rich graduates as
Stanford's career RBI leader
with 214.
Stanford does return sev
en of nine regular starters in
the lineup, including stand
outs Bonstrom, who led the
team with a .404 batting aver
age on the season, and sopho
more rightfielder Cassandra
Roulund, who finished third
on the team in home runs and
RBI.
The 2014 season will begin

Regional second-seed Stanford
softball defeated the third and
fourth seeds in the Lincoln Regional,
but top-seeded host No. 14 Nebras
ka proved too much, defeating the
Cardinal twice to end Stanford's sea
son in the regional round of the
NCAA Tournament.

In the first game of the regional
Friday, Stanford (39-21, 13-11 Pac
-12) defeated third-seeded Tulsa (42-
16-1,19-5 Conference USA) 4-2.
Tulsa jumped out to a 2-0 lead in
the top of the first, scoring two runs
off senior starting pitcher Teagan
Gerhart on a two-out two-RBI home
run by Tulsa first baseman Julie
Kernen. But that was the last run
Gerhart would allow.
Freshman catcher Jessica Plaza
homered to left field in the bottom of
the second, scoring sophomore desig
nated player Erin Ashby, to tie the
game at two. Three innings later, an
other freshman, first baseman Kayla
Bonstrom, hit a two-run homer to
give Stanford its first lead, 4-2.
Gerhart allowed only one more
baserunner, a two-out walk in the
sixth, after Bonstrom gave Stanford
the lead in closing out her complete
game victory.
