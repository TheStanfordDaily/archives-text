## Playing for fourth gets you fourth 
### Winston Shi 
I don't find myself agreeing with
Piers Morgan often, but when
I do, the idea terrifies me. The
CNN talk show host and Arse
nal soccer fan occasionally
spouts irritation on his Twitter ac
count when Arsenal plays. He is often
and correctly described as a
downer and excessively negative, but
occasionally he has a point. Every
sports fan knows somebody like this.
Morgan's most recent bit of intel
ligent commentary occurred after Ar
senal defeated Newcastle on Sunday
to secure fourth place in the English
Premier League, and more impor
tantly, become eligible for the Euro
pean Champions League and the 30-
or-so million euros that come with it.
If you saw the photos of the team
celebrating, you might have thought
they'd actually won the Champions
League. Photoshop in a nice trophy
and you might think that it was 2004
all over again.
"No Manchester United team
would ever celebrate coming [in
fourth]," Morgan tweeted, referring
to the newly crowned champions of
England. "That's the difference."
Why does Arsenal act this way?
Since Arsenal's miraculous undefeat
ed season in 2004, a new breed of bil
lionaire owners has taken England
by storm and driven up the prices of
superstar players.
In order to stay financially inde
pendent, Arsenal has been selling off
key contributors at the rate of around
two per year. Armed with a talented
youth and scouting network, the
team always ends up gelling by the
end of the season, but the lack of
chemistry in the early going dooms
its chances of winning trophies.
For this reason, Arsenal has come
to consider qualifying for the Cham
pions League a victory, believing it's
the only championship that Arsenal
can realistically play for.
Perhaps this is true there are
many financial subtleties to the mat
ter but it is certainly a self-fulfill
ing prophecy. Many elite players that
would consider signing with Arsenal
have chosen other clubs instead be
cause the opposition supposedly of
fers them an actual chance to win.
As is, Arsenal will never be able to
financially compete with the
petrodollar-fueled titans of Europe,
who can afford to lose hundreds of
millions of euros each year.
But in terms of pure revenue, the
club is the fifth-biggest club in Eu
rope. Arsenal is certainly competitive
with independent clubs that are sus
tainably ran like Bayern Munich or
Manchester United both of whom
won national championships this
year.
Money is not perfectly correlated
to winning, so Arsenal's relative lack
of money is not an excuse for the
team's lack of winning. Arsenal is cer
tainly in Bayern or United's league at
the bank and it ought to be the same
on the field.
In particular, the success of the
German clubs given that Germany
has strict laws about its teams operat
ing sustainably serves to illustrate
that a sensibly-run independent team
can truly contend, even in Europe.
This year's Champions League final
will be an all-German final, between
Bayern and Borussia Dortmund.
Neither of these teams has a stereo
typical Middle Eastern/Russian sug
ar daddy. Both live within their (con
siderable) means. Both built expen
sive new stadiums as Arsenal did and
paid off their own debt as Arsenal is
doing right now.
Arsenal does not need to sell out
to a foreign billionaire in order to win.
However, it has to shake the idea that
fourth place is acceptable in any way
for a self-professed giant of Europe.
Manchester United's American own
ers do not pump money into the club
in fact, they do the exact opposite
but United wins anyway because it
refuses to accept losing.
The lowered expectations have
not been completely lost on Arsenal's
players. After the celebration, start
ing goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny
pointed out, "We celebrated a bit like
we had won the championship, which
is a bit weird." But when your cham
pionship is fourth place, I suppose
you can't complain.
Resignation to mediocrity is the
surest way to achieve it.
