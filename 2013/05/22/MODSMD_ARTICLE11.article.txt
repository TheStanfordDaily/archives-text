# NOT DONE YET
## POSTSEASON FATE HINGES ON FINALE 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
Stanford (30-21, 14-13 Pac-12)
easily coasted past Pacific (14-37,6-
18 Big West) by a score of 11-2
Tuesday night at Sunken Diamond
behind sophomore third baseman
Alex Blandino's two-homer per
formance.
The Cardinal, facing a crucial
do-or-die series this weekend
against No. 11 UCLA, took care of
business against the Tigers to keep
this weekend's series relevant.
Pacific came to Sunken Dia

mond hoping to play spoiler, extend
Stanford's two-game Tuesday los
ing streak and effectively eliminate
Stanford from playoff contention.
Unfortunately for the Tigers, how
ever, none of those things hap
pened on a chilly Tuesday night.
After Pacific's battered pitching
staff gave up nine runs in its last
matchup with the Cardinal, the
Tigers' coaching staff decided to
throw a fresh arm on the mound by
giving first baseman Erik Lock
wood his first start on the mound
this season.
But Loekwood was not able to
get the job done; the game got out
of hand quickly as Stanford's hit
ters jumped all over him. Lock
wood could not make it out of the
second inning, earning the loss by
allowing five runs on four hits in 1.1
innings of work.
Stanford got out to a quick

start out of the gate as senior des
ignated hitter Justin Ringo, a
sparkplug in the leadoff spot all
year long, doubled to lead off the
game. Sophomore rightfielder
Austin Slater followed with a walk.

After an uncharacteristic dou
ble steal that showed the Cardi
nal's aggressiveness on the base
paths, both runners came around
to score on a sacrifice fly from jun
ior first baseman Brian Ragira
and an RBI groundout to third by
junior center fielder Austin Wil
son.
After that quick start, the of
fense never looked back. Every
Cardinal starter reached base,

and three-RBI nights from both
Ragira and Blandino led the offen
sive charge.
All three RBI for Blandino
came on two mammoth home runs
hit over the left-field fence, upping
the sophomore's count to six on
the year.
"We were just being aggressive
and seeing good pitches," Blandi
no said. "I don't know how many
strikeouts we had today, but I def
initely think the number was pret
ty low. Again, just seeing good
pitches, getting ahead and being
in hitters' counts."
Wilson contributed two RBI
and junior shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila continued his solid hit
ting as of late with an RBI triple in
the fifth. Leftfielder Wayne Taylor
reached base in all five of his plate
