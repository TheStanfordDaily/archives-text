Hey all, Tuesday was a
relatively quiet day
for Stanford Track &
Field. Most of our 35
regional competitors and all of
the coaching staff, save for
Coach Milt, left in the early af
ternoon. Those still on campus
gathered in the mid-afternoon
for their workouts.
The distance runners, who
comprise a large part of both
the men's and women's teams,
met at 2:30 p.m. on an other
wise empty track (except for
those individuals who can't read
the "Track closed from 1:30 to 6
p.m. for practice" sign) to go
over workout plans with Coach
Milt.
After a 20-minute warm-up
run, drills and light strides, we
got into the meat of our work
for the day. Fifth-year senior
Dylan "Jail" Ferris (never call
him Dylan), sophomore Luke
Lefebure and freshman Will
Drinkwater had a 10 x 250 meter
session with a one-minute rest
between repetitions.
Freshmen Garrett Sweatt
and Thomas Graham were put
through a "Michigan" workout,
running one mile on the track,
one mile off the track, 1,200 me
ters on track, one mile off the
track, 800 meters on the track,
one mile off the track and finally
one last 400-meter interval.
These two probably got in about
10 to 12 miles total on the day.
Junior Erik Olson, slated to

run
the 5,000
meters at the
regional on Saturday, had a final
tune-up workout before he
leaves for Austin, Texas, on
Thursday. Similarly, Jess Tonn,
Emilie Amaro and Aisling Cuffe
will all run the 5k this weekend
and had their last hard effort on
campus yesterday.
Also on the track was the
freshmen sprint crew. Jack
Shumway could be seen . some
hurdle work, with the rest of the
group doing some short repeats.
Post-practice, the training
room was busy as usual, with
athletes stretching, foam
rolling, getting treatment and
hopping in the ice baths. After
wards, a few of the freshman
distance runners ate together at
Manzanita dining hall a de
parture from the usual Stern
dinner.
Coach Milt will be leaving for
Austin tomorrow, so we'll be on
our own for the remainder of the
week. That should be interest
ing.
I hope you all have enjoyed
the blog posts so far. It's awe
some to be able to share a little
bit of what we do on daily basis
with the Stanford community.
Tomorrow, I will preview the re
gional meet that begins Thurs
day and touch on our fantastic
incoming recruiting class.
