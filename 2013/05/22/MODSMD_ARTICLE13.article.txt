# OPINIONS
## OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD The
						Perfection Police 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
Everybody has it. Nobody
talks about it. We try to cov
er it up. We try to medicate
it. No one even notices it, though it
feels so glaringly obvious if you
have it. I'm not talking about de
pression, or anything that impor
tant. I'm talking about acne.
EW I know, unspeakable.
Shocking as it is, I have the hor
mones of a twenty-one-year-old.
Sometimes, I even sweat. Even
worse, there are days when I do the
unthinkable and go to sleep without
dancing through the eleanser-ton
er-moisturizer ritual. And the car
dinal sin, there are times when I get
anxious and pick at my skin, and
have to run the gauntlet of walking
around campus with a tiny scab on
my face. Cool, now you know that I
do not have perfect skin and that I
am embarrassingly, disgustingly
human. What gives?
This is not a column about acne,
just like "Moby Dick" is not a book
about whaling. It's about the ab
surdity of some of the insecurities
we hide. It's about the uselessness
of hiding those insecurities in the
first place. It's about the pettiness of
perfectionism, put in sharp relief by
the insignificance of a little pimple.
Everybody has acne. Everybody
gets dumped. Everybody gets too
drunk and humiliates himself.
Everybody gets jealous. Every
body has high hopes and everybody
encounters big disappointments.
Everybody feels too fat or too skin
ny. Everybody has at least one love
that's left unrequited.
Nobody talks about their acne.
Nobody talks about being de
pressed. Nobody talks about exis
tential crises. In my experience, no
body even admits that they're hav
ing a bad night. When I'm having an
existential crisis, I couch it in terms
of how "exciting" it is to be young,
lonely, and not have a clue what I
want to do with my life. When my
roommate asks me how my night
was, naturally it was "epic." In oth
er words, we put on cover-up.
You try to medicate it. You
snatch up creams, serums, pre
scription pills. You cut dairy and

sugar from your diet. I remember
one of my girlfriends in high school
going on birth control before she
lost her virginity because it would
cure her acne. That there is a cure
may be a myth, but give me your
expert opinion and I'll follow it to
the grave, so long as it promises mi
nor improvements along the path to
that one carrot dangling just a cou
ple of feet ahead: perfection.
I know in my bones that perfec
tion is a myth, yet I spend inordinate
amounts of time and energy toning,
tanning, bleaching, filing, deep con
ditioning and of course moisturizing.
All to the same end: I have good
days and bad days, some days I
break out, and to an outsider I look
exactly the same when I fuss over
my appearance as when I don't.
Of course, it doesn't matter that
the fussing proves futile. The fuss
ing serves a deeper need, the need
to perfect what's outside in hopes
that those improvements might re
flect on the inside. You can't tan,
tone or bleach your soul, but you can
compulsively floss and exfoliate.
When you get to that critical
place where the fussing develops in
ertia of its own, tell yourself the sto
ry. You are the only person scruti
nizing yourself under a microscope.
You are the only one who notices the
tiny imperfections that madden
you, both inside and out. Give your
self a break. Take a risk and admit
to a friend that you had your heart
broken. Tell her if you're afraid of
all the uncertainty in your life, or if
your night was actually really bor
ing. She won't report you to the
Stanford police for failing to be su
perhuman.

The perfection police aren't censor
ing email, at least not that we know.
