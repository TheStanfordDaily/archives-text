## A
						Response to Dean Griffith from Students L, C and R 
### 
Dean of Student Life Chris
Griffith was a strange choice
to provide the University's
response to our case study exposing
extensive violations of Stanford's Ju
dicial Charter by the Office of Judi
cial Affairs (OJA). Griffith had re
sponsibility for OJA at the time of
the study, and therefore seems un
likely to clean house at the depart
ment.
The Judicial Charter was adopt
ed by students in 1997. Griffith and
others have candidly acknowledged
what appeal* to us to be fundamental
philosophical disagreements with
several of the Charter's guaranteed
rights. This culture, if not eradicat
ed, will likely lead to ongoing viola
tions of the Charter.
Our first letter from OJA said we
could not contact any witnesses, al
though the Charter guarantees that
right. We were fortunate to have
alumni representatives advise us; we
ignored OJA and produced 15 cor
roborating witnesses. Had we be
lieved OJA, we would have lost our
case and likely been suspended for a
quarter.
Next, OJA hired a statistical ex
pert. When the analysis was corrob
orative of our innocence, OJA dis
missed the expert and refused to
identify the statistician so we could
call the expert as our witness. OJA
appeared to be working for our con
viction.
The Judicial Charter mandates
that if a charging student seeks
anonymity, the case must be with
drawn. In our case, the student
sought anonymity, but OJA pursued
the case anyway, a gross violation of
the Charter. At our hearing, OJA al
lowed the instructor to testify to
what the never-identified student
had said, with no opportunity for us

to cross-examine, another right
mandated by the Charter and violat
ed by OJA.
OJA did everything it could to ex
clude our 12 non-party witnesses
from testifying at the hearing, then
attempted to cut off direct question
ing of witnesses who did. OJA al
lowed into evidence matters ruled ir
relevant in pre-hearing proceedings.
When we objected, the OJA employ
ee said Stanford doesn't allow objec
tions at its judicial hearings.
The course coordinator asked
our first student witness if she would
authorize a review of all of the wit
ness' exam booklets from the class,
which served no purpose other than
to intimidate the student witness.
Although witnesses are protected
from intimidation by the Charter,
OJA employees sat by silently.
The day after the hearing we
asked the OJA to preserve the
record so we could share our experi
ences with other students. OJA told
us the file had already been physi
cally "shredded," notwithstanding
the Charter's specific guarantee
that it be maintained for one full
year.
Now, with our Case Study pro
viding witness to the inner workings
of her department, Dean Griffith
has attempted to figuratively shred
our case by proclaiming our meticu
lously documented and thoroughly
vetted Case Study "seriously flawed
and inaccurate" in many respects.
Yet, in 18 months, several dozen
University officials have received
the Study and not one, including
Griffith in a half dozen conversations
with our group, has questioned a sin
gle sentence. Alternatively, and in
consistently, she calls our experience
"an outlier."
Was OJAs conduct an "outlier"?
Hardly. Almost every violation of
our rights reflected OJA policies, not
unique individual evidentiary rul
ings. If there was any doubt that
OJA could eviscerate our Judicial
Charter, consider Griffith's surpris

ingly candid quote in The Daily:
"[Griffith] said that by omitting the
previously supplied warning to stu
dent respondents to not contact wit
nesses, student respondents might
be more likely to do so." [Emphasis
added.]
These people appeal- to have fun
damental philosophical objections to
portions of our student-drafted Judi
cial Charter. Griffith's quote, her ef
fort to discredit us and the study it
self, all suggest a culture that per
meates OJA.
Griffith claims the case study
"poorly serves" the discussion. In
fact, our study started the discus
sion. It blows the whistle on the hi
jacking of our Judicial Charter by
OJA. Griffith prefers an "education
al" process, but the Charter's provi
sions are all that matter. Students
adopted a Judicial Charter, not an
Educational Charter.
Does enforcement of the Charter
matter? We believe scores of stu
dents may have been convicted in
cases where the Charter was violat
ed. Wrongful convictions typically
result in one-quarter suspensions
and Stanford maintains a perma
nent record, which graduate schools
and employers can see.
More significantly, systemic and
condoned Charter violations, in the
very office tasked with maintaining
the University's academic integrity,
will threaten the University's repu
tation and erode its core values. This
issue affects us all.
Stanford must assign a respect
ed, credible third party to clean
house and remove from OJA anyone
who philosophically objects to the
rights guaranteed by our Judicial
Charter. Chris Griffith, who oversaw
OJA as that culture appears to have
flourished, is, in our view, a poor
choice for the job.
