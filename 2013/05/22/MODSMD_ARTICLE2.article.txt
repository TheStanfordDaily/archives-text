This year marks the 40th anniver
sary of the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve. Located in the eastern
foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains
seven miles west of Stanford's main
campus, the preserve is home to about
16 species of mammals and 800 species
of vascular plants, providing a natural
laboratory for researchers from
around the world and an open class
room for students and docent-led
tourists.
Since the initial designation of the
land as a natural preserve by the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees in 1973,
the Preserve has expanded from 960
acres to 1,189 acres, occupying rough

acreage. Today, the preserve provides
a research environment for some 80
researchers at any point in time, with
those researchers conducting work in
fields ranging from history to archae

Home to some 10 percent of Califor

of flora and fauna such as Chaparral
Mallow. Despite apparent mountain
