## Jasper Ridge reaches 40th anniversary 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A feeding black-tailed deer stands
alert in the distance as a group of stu
dents arrive at Jasper Ridge. A West
ern Bluebird flits across a checkered
meadow of yellow and white flowers
and disappears into an oak tree by
Searsville Lake.
This year marks the 40th anniver
sary of the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve. Located in the eastern
foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains
seven miles west of Stanford's main
campus, the preserve is home to about
16 species of mammals and 800 species
of vascular plants, providing a natural
laboratory for researchers from
around the world and an open class
room for students and docent-led
tourists.
Since the initial designation of the
land as a natural preserve by the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees in 1973,
the Preserve has expanded from 960
acres to 1,189 acres, occupying rough
ly one seventh of the University's total
acreage. Today, the preserve provides
a research environment for some 80
researchers at any point in time, with
those researchers conducting work in
fields ranging from history to archae
ology.
Biodiversity and early history
One aspect of Jasper Ridge's status
as an invaluable resource for re
searchers is that it provides a protect
ed environment for long-term re
search with minimal human interfer
ence.
Home to some 10 percent of Califor
nia's total species, the preserve pro
vides shelter for mammals such as coy
otes, mountain lions and a diverse range
of flora and fauna such as Chaparral
Mallow. Despite apparent mountain
lion sightings in recent years, facul
ty associated with the preserve as
serted that there have been no
close encounters with the large
cats.
"The mountain lions are ex
tremely good at not being seen,"
said Chris Field Ph.D. 'Bl, Jasper
Ridge's faculty director.
However, Jasper Ridge has not
always been the tranquil land it is
today. Up to five thousand years
ago, Jasper Ridge was home to
Muwekma-Ohlone, a Native Amer
ican tribe native to the Bay Area
that was driven out in the late 18th
century, when Spanish soldiers and
missionaries conquered them and
took control of the land. In the ear
ly 19th century, the arrival of the
new immigrants caused the land to
suffer from severe grazing.
Between 1892 and 1926, Stan
ford slowly purchased parcels of
the land and designated it for scien
tific research while the Searsville
Lake, located in the central portion
of the preserve, continued to be
used for recreational purposes.
However, by the 19605, conflicts
arose between recreational activi
ties and scientific research, as a
group of researchers, including

Professor of Biology Paul Ehrlich,
petitioned the university to close
the reserve to the public.
Between 1973 and 1975, the
Board of Trustees finally decided to
designate Jasper Ridge as a biolog
ical preserve and made the area
off-limits to casual visitors.
"Jasper Ridge is unique because
it's well protected," Field said. "It

has extremely diverse ecosystem
and it's well understood so it can be
made as a model system."

Research and education
Several factors have served to
distinguish Jasper Ridge from the
other biological reserves around
California as a natural destination
for researchers, with many Stan

ford researchers describing its
proximity to the main campus as
one of its greatest assets.
"Most field stations are far
away from campus which makes it
harder for student participation or
even for young researchers to par
ticipate because of travel," said
Cindy Wilber, Jasper Ridge educa
tion coordinator, who has worked
there for 19 years. "So we are quite
fortunate that the field station is so
accessible physically for members
of the campus community."
So far, 165 dissertations and
theses have involved research at
the Preserve. Since 1965, 335 pub
lished works have reported re
search there.
According to Tadashi Fukami,
an assistant professor of biology,
some researchers are attracted by
the rich legacy of previous research
that has been conducted in the Pre
serve.
"There are many research proj
ects going on [at Jasper Ridge],"
Fukami said. "Many of them are bi
ological, including some work that
was done long time ago by profes
sors here on the plants and insects
that we use for class. So there is a
lot of background information that
other people have collected in the
past that we can make use of."
Another highlight of the pre
serve is its comprehensive re
search and educational facilities.
The Leslie Shao-ming Sun Field

Station, completed in 2002, is a
9,800 square foot research and edu
cation complex with near-zero net
energy consumption. In 2003, the
building was awarded the first Sus
tainable San Mateo County Green
Building Award.
"They have very good field sta
tions, classrooms and benches that
we can use for the class," Fukami
added.
Since the opening of Sun Field
Station, at least 37 Stanford cours
es, seven non-Stanford courses, 36
Stanford-affiliated organizations
and 40 non-Stanford organizations
have been able to take advantage of
the preserve to create research and
classroom experiences.
For example, 810 44Y, one of
the biology major's core laboratory
classes, involves students in Fuka
mi's current research on the nectar
of the Mimulus flowers that scatter
the land.
According to research by the bi
ology department, students who
were engaged in this field-based
way of learning through the class
became "more interested in contin
uing basic science research."
"I always have a good time talk
ing to the students in the field,"
Fukami said. "I find it much easier
to talk about biology with students
there rather than in the lab."

16 species of mammals and 800 species
of vascular plants, providing a natural
laboratory for researchers from
around the world and an open class
room for students and docent-led
tourists.
Since the initial designation of the
land as a natural preserve by the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees in 1973,
the Preserve has expanded from 960
acres to 1,189 acres, occupying rough
ly one seventh of the University's total
acreage. Today, the preserve provides
a research environment for some 80
researchers at any point in time, with
those researchers conducting work in
fields ranging from history to archae
ology.
Biodiversity and early history
One aspect of Jasper Ridge's status
as an invaluable resource for re
searchers is that it provides a protect
ed environment for long-term re
search with minimal human interfer
ence.
Home to some 10 percent of Califor
nia's total species, the preserve pro
vides shelter for mammals such as coy
otes, mountain lions and a diverse range
of flora and fauna such as Chaparral
Mallow. Despite apparent mountain
lion sightings in recent years, facul
ty associated with the preserve as
serted that there have been no
close encounters with the large
cats.
"The mountain lions are ex
tremely good at not being seen,"
said Chris Field Ph.D. 'Bl, Jasper
Ridge's faculty director.
However, Jasper Ridge has not
always been the tranquil land it is
today. Up to five thousand years
ago, Jasper Ridge was home to
Muwekma-Ohlone, a Native Amer
ican tribe native to the Bay Area
that was driven out in the late 18th
century, when Spanish soldiers and
missionaries conquered them and
took control of the land. In the ear
ly 19th century, the arrival of the
new immigrants caused the land to
suffer from severe grazing.
Between 1892 and 1926, Stan
ford slowly purchased parcels of
the land and designated it for scien
tific research while the Searsville
Lake, located in the central portion
of the preserve, continued to be
used for recreational purposes.
However, by the 19605, conflicts
arose between recreational activi
ties and scientific research, as a
group of researchers, including

Professor of Biology Paul Ehrlich,
petitioned the university to close
the reserve to the public.
Between 1973 and 1975, the
Board of Trustees finally decided to
designate Jasper Ridge as a biolog
ical preserve and made the area
off-limits to casual visitors.
"Jasper Ridge is unique because
it's well protected," Field said. "It

has extremely diverse ecosystem
and it's well understood so it can be
made as a model system."

Research and education
Several factors have served to
distinguish Jasper Ridge from the
other biological reserves around
California as a natural destination
for researchers, with many Stan

ford researchers describing its
proximity to the main campus as
one of its greatest assets.
"Most field stations are far
away from campus which makes it
harder for student participation or
even for young researchers to par
ticipate because of travel," said
Cindy Wilber, Jasper Ridge educa
tion coordinator, who has worked
there for 19 years. "So we are quite
fortunate that the field station is so
accessible physically for members
of the campus community."
So far, 165 dissertations and
theses have involved research at
the Preserve. Since 1965, 335 pub
lished works have reported re
search there.
According to Tadashi Fukami,
an assistant professor of biology,
some researchers are attracted by
the rich legacy of previous research
that has been conducted in the Pre
serve.
"There are many research proj
ects going on [at Jasper Ridge],"
Fukami said. "Many of them are bi
ological, including some work that
was done long time ago by profes
sors here on the plants and insects
that we use for class. So there is a
lot of background information that
other people have collected in the
past that we can make use of."
Another highlight of the pre
serve is its comprehensive re
search and educational facilities.
The Leslie Shao-ming Sun Field

Station, completed in 2002, is a
9,800 square foot research and edu
cation complex with near-zero net
energy consumption. In 2003, the
building was awarded the first Sus
tainable San Mateo County Green
Building Award.
"They have very good field sta
tions, classrooms and benches that
we can use for the class," Fukami
added.
Since the opening of Sun Field
Station, at least 37 Stanford cours
es, seven non-Stanford courses, 36
Stanford-affiliated organizations
and 40 non-Stanford organizations
have been able to take advantage of
the preserve to create research and
classroom experiences.
For example, 810 44Y, one of
the biology major's core laboratory
classes, involves students in Fuka
mi's current research on the nectar
of the Mimulus flowers that scatter
the land.
According to research by the bi
ology department, students who
were engaged in this field-based
way of learning through the class
became "more interested in contin
uing basic science research."
"I always have a good time talk
ing to the students in the field,"
Fukami said. "I find it much easier
to talk about biology with students
there rather than in the lab."
