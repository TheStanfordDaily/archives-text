# TECHNOLOGY
## Startup simplifies online sizing 
### SARAH SALAMEH 
In creating a virtual fitting room,
Phi Six Fashion Labs, a company co
founded by Jon Su Ph.D. 'll, Jatin
Chhugani and Mihir Naware, may
have solved a common problem facing
online shoppers.
Phi Six's technology generates an
avatar, based on the consumer's meas
urements, that can virtually try on
more than 10,000 articles of clothing
that have been digitized by Phi Six. The
team has created more than 6,000
avatars to test the system, which has
been made commercially available for
website integration.
While Phi Six currently works with
12 companies, including Le Tote and
Tie Society, Naware said that the com
pany's goal is to "try and have our
technology used by pretty much every
body that buys clothes online in the
U.S."
According to Su, the company's cre
ation was motivated by the co
founders' difficulties with shopping on
line. Su, whose doctoral thesis was fo
cused on physics-based animation and
cloth simulation, framed Phi Six and
in particular the creation of accurate
avatars as a practical application of
his research
"The test users have liked it a lot,"
Su said. "The initial worry that most
people have is that the avatar is not an
identical match for your body, but it's
pretty close and provides way more in
formation than looking off a size chart.
It's a much better experience than cur
rent online shopping."
While Su's doctoral research expe-
dited the process of develop
ing the initial product, the
Phi Six team still faced a vari
ety of challenges, as Naware
noted that creating an avatar
that could closely mimic the
shopper's body was particular
ly difficult.
'At the outset, the problem
is pretty simple digitize
clothes and put them on the
bodies of avatars," Naware
said. "But it's actually a very
complex problem that requires
lots of computer science
knowledge to solve."
Su cited the team's relative
inexperience with the clothing
industry as another barrier
that has yet to be entirely over

come.
"I think the biggest chal
lenge is that we're trying to get
into 'fashion' as a bunch of
computer science guys," Su
said.
Both Su and Naware
agreed that though the compa
ny is fulfilling a need for con
sumers, PhiSix may face a
short-term struggle in expand
ing the number of businesses
that use the product. The com
pany is also looking to increase
its employee base in order to
digitize more clothing and fur
ther develop the avatars.
"It's not a problem of find
ing consumers that would use
our product, but getting com
panies to buy it," Su said. "An
other [goal] is to raise some
capital investment capital
to hire a bunch of people."
Naware said that Phi Six is
currently attempting to devel

op a mobile application that
would allow the user to input
them size, style and budget,
and view clothing options on
them smartphone, which he
believes would further expand
Phi Six's user base.
While technology in fash
ion is an emerging field, Su
expressed confidence that the
online clothing industiy will
embrace Phi Six's new tech
nologies.
"The problem itself is
pretty apparent... there is
this aversion to technology in
the fashion world," Su said.
"But, people are buying
everything online these days.
The fashion industry knows
that they're kind of behind in
that, so they'll do anything to
catch up."
