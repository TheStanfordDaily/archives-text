## Gibbs rally sets up Ahn clincher as Stanford captures NCAA title 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the entire stadium watch
ing, junior co-captain Kiistie Ahn
clinched No. 12 Stanford women's
tennis' 17th NCAA Championship
with a 7-5,4-6, 6-2 victory on Court
No. 2 to propel the Cardinal past
No. 3 Texas A&M on Tuesday
night.
"It was so surreal," Ahn said. "I
was having so much fun out there
and just loving the moment. I had
the biggest grin on my face, and
when I went up to hit that final
serve, I said, 'This one, this one is
it.' We all watched [the shot] sail
long, and I started jumping around
like a little kid."

Ahn's match would not have
mattered without the miraculous
comeback of her fellow junior co
captain Nicole Gibbs.
Gibbs fought back from 0-6, 0-2
down against A&M's Cristina
Sanchez-Quintanar, losing a set 6-0
for the first time in her 120-match
collegiate career to win the next 12
games and take the match 0-6,6-2,
6-0. The comeback win gave Stan
ford (22-4, 8-2 Pac-12) a 3-0 lead
over the Aggies (264, 12-1 SEC),
setting up Ahn's clincher.

"I have all the confidence in the
world in my team," Gibbs said, "but
it's hard to see your No. 1 player go
down quickly in a dual match be
cause it hurts team momentum. I
felt a little drained at the beginning
and I wasn't staying in points long
enough to outlast her the way I
needed to."
That's when Gibbs had a self
proclaimed wake-up call.
"I sat down with [Coach Lele
Forood]," Gibbs said, "and I said,
'My team needs me here. I need to
win this match.'"
The victory gave Stanford its
first NCAA team title in the 2012-
13 athletics year. Stanford had won
at least one NCAA team title in
each of the last 36 years, and the
women's tennis NCAA Tourna
ment was one of the Cardinal's last
opportunities to extend the streak.
Entering the tournament seed
ed outside of the top 10 for the first
time since 2009, Stanford became
the lowest-seeded team to capture
the women's tennis NCAA team ti
tle. The Cardinal first defeated the
Pac-12 champions No. 5 USC in the
Round of 16.
"We were suppose to lose in the
first non-regional round," Gibbs
said. "USC was our biggest hurdle
mentally coming into the tourna
ment. We knew we worked harder
than any other team in the country,
and if we could win that match, we
could ultimately win the champi
onship."
Stanford went on to creep past
No. 4 Georgia in the quarterfinals,
No. 1 Florida in the semifinals and
finally the No. 3 Aggies in the fi
nals.
Stanford captured these wins
without Mallory Burdette 'l3, who
played No. 2 singles and teamed up
with Gibbs in No. 1 doubles for the
Cardinal last year and left school to
play on the pro circuit in Septem
ber. Only two Cardinal players,
Gibbs and senior Stacey Tan, had
appeared in more than two NCAA
Tournament matches.
It was a night of ups and downs.
Stanford's first completed match
was an 8-3 loss on Court No. 1 by
the No. 8 nationally ranked duo of
Gibbs and Ahn.
"We got outplayed [at doubles],"
Gibbs admitted. "I don't say that
very often, but they executed

The No. 12 Stanford women's tennis team (above) became the lowest seed ever to win the NCAA title with its fourth-straight upset of a
top-five opponent. Junior co-captains Nicole Gibbs and Kristie Ahn provided two key victories to bring home the program's 17th title.

been playing. They just came out a
little bit tougher than us, and we
were weren't quite prepared."
An 8-4 win from Tan and sopho
more Ellen Tsay and a huge 8-5 vic
tory from the oldest and youngest
members of the squad, senior co-cap
tain Natalie Dillon and freshman
Rrista Hardebeck, over twin Aggies
Ines and Paula Deheza, set Stanford
up 1-0 entering singles.
Tan was the first to finish in sin
gles, topping Ines Deheza in a 7-5,6-
3 straight-set victory. Then, Gibbs,
who won both the NCAA individual
singles and doubles tournament last
year; completed her comeback to put
the Cardinal on the brink of the title.
The Cardinal was up 3-0 at this
point in the match, but the score was
deceiving. Hardebeck, Dillon, and
Tsay all had lost the first sets of their
matches and were neck-and-neck in
their respective second sets.
Tsay, who clinched Stanford's vic
tory over USC last Friday, was the
first to fall, losing to A&M's Anna
rMamalat 6-1,7-5.
Stanford's lead was down to 3-1.
Hardebeck's story follows a simi
lar narrative. She sealed the Cardi
nal's victory first in the quarterfinal
match against Georgia before re
peating the feat in a huge comeback
win over No. 1 Florida's Alexandra
Cercone in the semifinals.
The highly touted rookie fell 6-3
in the first set to A&M's Nazari
Urbina. Like Tsay, she almost drove
it to a third before losing 7-6 (3) in a
second set tiebreaker.
All of a sudden, the Aggies were
just one match behind.
Dillon managed to send her
match to a third set after making an
impressive second-set comeback, but

couldn't finish for the Cardinal as she
tumbled 6-2,3-6,6-1 to A&M's Stefa
nia Hristov.
With the match tied at 3-3, it was
Ahn's moment to shine.
"[Coach Frankie Brennan] said to
me during the match," Ahn said,
'"You deserve this, this is destiny, it's
going to happen.' And I said, 'You are
right, it is going to happen.' We put in
the hard work, we definitely had the
toughest draw and to pull it out? I
don't know how to describe it."
Ahn was sidelined most of last
season with injury, making only her
fourth singles appearance of the sea
son in then-No. 4 Stanford's quarter
finals loss to USC. This year, Ahn
clinched an NCAA title, capping an
improbable ran in the college tennis
world's most esteemed tournament.
Crowds watched in awe as Ahn
led 5-2 in the third set after winning
the first 7-5 but dropping the second
4-6. At the end of a back and forth
game between the two players, Stan
cu missed long and the tight-knit
Stanford squad bombarded Ahn in
an even tighter circle.
"I don't think we could have
asked for a better team national
championship clincher," Gibbs said.
"[Ahn] is just such a team player, re
ally sticking with the team through
some of the hardest periods of her
life. Everyone on the team deserves
to win her match, but I'm so happy to
see [Ahn] win it for us."
Tonight will be a night of celebra
tion for the players and coaches, but
a short-lived one. The NCAA individ
ual singles and doubles tournaments
begin this week, with Gibbs looking
to defend both titles.

"[Coach Frankie Brennan] said to
me during the match," Ahn said,
'"You deserve this, this is destiny, it's
going to happen.' And I said, 'You are
right, it is going to happen.' We put in
the hard work, we definitely had the
toughest draw and to pull it out? I
don't know how to describe it."
Ahn was sidelined most of last
season with injury, making only her
fourth singles appearance of the sea
son in then-No. 4 Stanford's quarter
finals loss to USC. This year, Ahn
clinched an NCAA title, capping an
improbable ran in the college tennis
world's most esteemed tournament.
Crowds watched in awe as Ahn
led 5-2 in the third set after winning
the first 7-5 but dropping the second
4-6. At the end of a back and forth
game between the two players, Stan
cu missed long and the tight-knit
Stanford squad bombarded Ahn in
an even tighter circle.
"I don't think we could have
asked for a better team national
championship clincher," Gibbs said.
"[Ahn] is just such a team player, re

some of the hardest periods of her
life. Everyone on the team deserves
to win her match, but I'm so happy to
see [Ahn] win it for us."

With the entire stadium watch
ing, junior co-captain Kiistie Ahn
clinched No. 12 Stanford women's
tennis' 17th NCAA Championship
with a 7-5,4-6, 6-2 victory on Court
No. 2 to propel the Cardinal past
No. 3 Texas A&M on Tuesday
night.
"It was so surreal," Ahn said. "I
was having so much fun out there
and just loving the moment. I had
the biggest grin on my face, and
when I went up to hit that final
serve, I said, 'This one, this one is
it.' We all watched [the shot] sail
long, and I started jumping around
like a little kid."

Ahn's match would not have
mattered without the miraculous
comeback of her fellow junior co
captain Nicole Gibbs.
Gibbs fought back from 0-6, 0-2
down against A&M's Cristina
Sanchez-Quintanar, losing a set 6-0
for the first time in her 120-match
collegiate career to win the next 12
games and take the match 0-6,6-2,
6-0. The comeback win gave Stan
ford (22-4, 8-2 Pac-12) a 3-0 lead
over the Aggies (264, 12-1 SEC),
setting up Ahn's clincher.

"I have all the confidence in the
world in my team," Gibbs said, "but
it's hard to see your No. 1 player go
down quickly in a dual match be
cause it hurts team momentum. I
felt a little drained at the beginning
and I wasn't staying in points long
enough to outlast her the way I
needed to."
That's when Gibbs had a self
proclaimed wake-up call.
"I sat down with [Coach Lele
Forood]," Gibbs said, "and I said,
'My team needs me here. I need to
win this match.'"
The victory gave Stanford its
first NCAA team title in the 2012-
13 athletics year. Stanford had won
at least one NCAA team title in
each of the last 36 years, and the
women's tennis NCAA Tourna
ment was one of the Cardinal's last
opportunities to extend the streak.
Entering the tournament seed
ed outside of the top 10 for the first
time since 2009, Stanford became
the lowest-seeded team to capture
the women's tennis NCAA team ti
tle. The Cardinal first defeated the
Pac-12 champions No. 5 USC in the
Round of 16.
"We were suppose to lose in the
first non-regional round," Gibbs
said. "USC was our biggest hurdle
mentally coming into the tourna
ment. We knew we worked harder
than any other team in the country,
and if we could win that match, we
could ultimately win the champi
onship."
Stanford went on to creep past
No. 4 Georgia in the quarterfinals,
No. 1 Florida in the semifinals and
finally the No. 3 Aggies in the fi
nals.
Stanford captured these wins
without Mallory Burdette 'l3, who
played No. 2 singles and teamed up
with Gibbs in No. 1 doubles for the
Cardinal last year and left school to
play on the pro circuit in Septem
ber. Only two Cardinal players,
Gibbs and senior Stacey Tan, had
appeared in more than two NCAA
Tournament matches.
It was a night of ups and downs.
Stanford's first completed match
was an 8-3 loss on Court No. 1 by
the No. 8 nationally ranked duo of
Gibbs and Ahn.

Gibbs admitted. "I don't say that

An 8-4 win from Tan and sopho
more Ellen Tsay and a huge 8-5 vic
tory from the oldest and youngest
members of the squad, senior co-cap
tain Natalie Dillon and freshman
Rrista Hardebeck, over twin Aggies
Ines and Paula Deheza, set Stanford
up 1-0 entering singles.
Tan was the first to finish in sin
gles, topping Ines Deheza in a 7-5,6-
3 straight-set victory. Then, Gibbs,
who won both the NCAA individual
singles and doubles tournament last
year; completed her comeback to put
the Cardinal on the brink of the title.
The Cardinal was up 3-0 at this
point in the match, but the score was
deceiving. Hardebeck, Dillon, and
Tsay all had lost the first sets of their
matches and were neck-and-neck in
their respective second sets.
Tsay, who clinched Stanford's vic
tory over USC last Friday, was the
first to fall, losing to A&M's Anna
rMamalat 6-1,7-5.
Stanford's lead was down to 3-1.
Hardebeck's story follows a simi
lar narrative. She sealed the Cardi
nal's victory first in the quarterfinal
match against Georgia before re
peating the feat in a huge comeback
win over No. 1 Florida's Alexandra
Cercone in the semifinals.
The highly touted rookie fell 6-3
in the first set to A&M's Nazari
Urbina. Like Tsay, she almost drove
it to a third before losing 7-6 (3) in a
second set tiebreaker.
All of a sudden, the Aggies were
just one match behind.
Dillon managed to send her
match to a third set after making an
impressive second-set comeback, but

couldn't finish for the Cardinal as she
tumbled 6-2,3-6,6-1 to A&M's Stefa
nia Hristov.
With the match tied at 3-3, it was
Ahn's moment to shine.
"[Coach Frankie Brennan] said to
