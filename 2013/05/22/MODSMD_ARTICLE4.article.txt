## Gibbs rally sets up Ahn clincher as Stanford captures NCAA title 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the entire stadium watch
ing, junior co-captain Kiistie Ahn
clinched No. 12 Stanford women's
tennis' 17th NCAA Championship
with a 7-5,4-6, 6-2 victory on Court
No. 2 to propel the Cardinal past
No. 3 Texas A&M on Tuesday
night.
"It was so surreal," Ahn said. "I
was having so much fun out there
and just loving the moment. I had
the biggest grin on my face, and
when I went up to hit that final
serve, I said, 'This one, this one is
it.' We all watched [the shot] sail
long, and I started jumping around
like a little kid."

Ahn's match would not have
mattered without the miraculous
comeback of her fellow junior co
captain Nicole Gibbs.
Gibbs fought back from 0-6, 0-2
down against A&M's Cristina
Sanchez-Quintanar, losing a set 6-0
for the first time in her 120-match
collegiate career to win the next 12
games and take the match 0-6,6-2,
6-0. The comeback win gave Stan
ford (22-4, 8-2 Pac-12) a 3-0 lead
over the Aggies (264, 12-1 SEC),
setting up Ahn's clincher.

"I have all the confidence in the
world in my team," Gibbs said, "but
it's hard to see your No. 1 player go
down quickly in a dual match be
cause it hurts team momentum. I
felt a little drained at the beginning
and I wasn't staying in points long
enough to outlast her the way I
needed to."
That's when Gibbs had a self
proclaimed wake-up call.
"I sat down with [Coach Lele
Forood]," Gibbs said, "and I said,
'My team needs me here. I need to
win this match.'"
The victory gave Stanford its
first NCAA team title in the 2012-
13 athletics year. Stanford had won
at least one NCAA team title in
each of the last 36 years, and the
women's tennis NCAA Tourna
ment was one of the Cardinal's last
opportunities to extend the streak.
Entering the tournament seed
ed outside of the top 10 for the first
time since 2009, Stanford became
the lowest-seeded team to capture
the women's tennis NCAA team ti
tle. The Cardinal first defeated the
Pac-12 champions No. 5 USC in the
Round of 16.
"We were suppose to lose in the
first non-regional round," Gibbs
said. "USC was our biggest hurdle
mentally coming into the tourna
ment. We knew we worked harder
than any other team in the country,
and if we could win that match, we
could ultimately win the champi
onship."
Stanford went on to creep past
No. 4 Georgia in the quarterfinals,
No. 1 Florida in the semifinals and
finally the No. 3 Aggies in the fi
nals.
Stanford captured these wins
without Mallory Burdette 'l3, who
played No. 2 singles and teamed up
with Gibbs in No. 1 doubles for the
Cardinal last year and left school to
play on the pro circuit in Septem
ber. Only two Cardinal players,
Gibbs and senior Stacey Tan, had
appeared in more than two NCAA
Tournament matches.
It was a night of ups and downs.
Stanford's first completed match
was an 8-3 loss on Court No. 1 by
the No. 8 nationally ranked duo of
Gibbs and Ahn.
"We got outplayed [at doubles],"
Gibbs admitted. "I don't say that
very often, but they executed
everything they needed to and
