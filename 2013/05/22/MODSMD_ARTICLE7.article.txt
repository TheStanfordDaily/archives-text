# Q&A
## LI LIU PROFESSOR OF CHINESE ARCHAEOLOGY 
### BENJAMIN PHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Li Liu is a professor of Chinese
archaeology and the author of re
search on the origins of agriculture
on the Asian continent, which has
pushed back the beginnings of Chi
nese farming by 12,000 years. The
Daily sat down with Liu to discuss
this groundbreaking discovery, her
unique path to American academia
and the importance of millet in the
early Asian diet.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You
were born and raised in China, as
well as attended college there.
Can you describe your academic
trajectory to the United States?
Li Liu (LL): I went to under
graduate school in China, at a
school called Northwestern Uni
versity in Xi'an, [and] finished in
1982. I came to the States in 1983
to do my master's in anthropology
at Temple University, [and] I went
to Harvard in 1987 to get my
Ph.D., also in anthropology, where
I focused on Chinese archaeology.
So then I finished my Ph.D. in
1994, and went to Melbourne Uni
versity, where I taught Chinese ar
chaeology, general archaeology
and a bunch of other things. I also
conducted fieldwork in China be
ginning in 1997 until I left in 2000,
when I came to Stanford.
TSD: What, specifically, brought
you to Stanford from Australia?
LL: There was a new position
established in Chinese archaeology
from a private donation. The posi
tion was housed in the Department
of East Asian Languages and Cul
tures, so I applied, and then they
offered me the job.
TSD: That worked out nicely!
Within your field of Chinese
archeology, what are your pri
mary research interests?
LL: In Chinese archaeology, I
[study] a wide range of topics.
Mostly, I study the period from the
late Paleolithic period to the
Bronze Age. I cover more than
10,000 years. Topics [I cover] in
clude animal domestication, plant
domestication, settler formation,
craft production, craft specializa
tion so all kinds of things.
TSD: Why is Chinese archeology
important not just for the study
of Chinese history, but also for
global history at large?
LL: [First, I think] China is so
big and has so many people and
has such a long history, so what
happened in China would be very
important to understand and com
pare with other parts of the world
to see very general patterns
and differences. Archaeology re
lies on comparative studies, espe
cially between regions, and China
is a very good example to compare
other [regions] to.
TSD: How does your most recent
research on ancient Chinese
agriculture fit into your broader
academic focus?
LL: The article in PNAS [Pro
ceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences] is really part of our
larger project to understand the
origins of agriculture not from the
beginning of domestication
when people already began har
vesting crops but the earliest
stages of agriculture, when people
began to explore a kind of a plan to
domesticate. Many people have
tried to understand when [the
process of domestication] started
and how long that took. Scholar
ship has been done more in the
Near East, because that region has

/
been studied archaeologically for a
much longer time.
In China, research is really just
beginning, particularly for the late
Paleolithic period, which is rather
remote it's difficult to recover
remains. Also, the mythology of
the Paleolithic is different from the
Neolithic in China, so people have
not really discussed early agricul
ture in [the] Paleolithic until re
cently, and the methods we em
ployed and analysis we used is
rather new, especially in China. We
had access to some very early
tools, and then we were able to use
our archaeological methods on
those tools, so that's a real advan
tage.
TSD: What sorts of artifacts did
you unearth while you were ex
cavating?
LL: We had already isolated ar
tifacts before, [so instead], for this
article, we analyzed grinding
stones made of sandstone that first
appeared in China no earlier than
25,000 years ago. This is in the late
Paleolithic period the beginning
of modern human behavior and
it's interesting to see what those
earliest grinding stones were used
for. People always assumed they
were used for domesticating cere
als, but we know those stones were
from the Paleolithic period, so we
want to know exactly what they
wanted those stones to process.
That's the beginning point of what
would later become agriculture,
and we can trace it to this time pe
riod.
TSD: Where there any crops that
were particularly significant to
early Chinese agriculture?
LL: Rice and millet [were very
important] in Chinese agriculture.
Basically in northern China, [the
most important crop] was millet,
and in southern China it was rice.
[While] rice is still very commonly
consumed by people in the world,
many people don't know what mil
let is like, and if you have not con
sumed millet, you can probably go
to the store and [think that you're]
buy[ing] bird food. Because mil
let's productivity was rather low, it
was gradually replaced by wheat
and corn, which were introduced
from outside to China. The earliest
Chinese civilization developed in
northern China, and those people
who built the first dynasties and
states relied on millet, so that's
why millet is very crucial to under
stand the economic bases of Chi
nese civilizations.


LINDA A. CICERO/Stanford News Service
Li Liu, professor of archaeology
at Stanford University, recently
published research that pushes
back the beginnings of Chinese
agricultural practices, including
the use of millet, by 12,000
years.
TSD: Now that you've published
your recent findings, where will
your research go from here?
LL: We've begun to [under
stand] the earliest stage of human
activities that led to agriculture,
and we want to know more about
the later stages. There are three
general phases of domestication
of plants: First, people began to
explore for wild plants, which
were not explored before they
had a lot more to eat, like fungi
and wild animals, if they hunted a
lot. They had a lot of meat, so they
didn't bother to collect plants.
They also had large amounts of
tubers. If they were short of food

and not productive, then they be
gan exploring plants. This is the
first stage, and we can now trace
the first stage to 23,000 years ago.
In the second stage after
people are familiar with nature of
those plants they began to ex
periment with cultivation. This pre
domestication cultivation is one of
our research targets, since little is
known about how it happened, es
pecially in northern China.
The third stage is domestica
tion. [ln this stage] plants were
already domesticated and were
genetically different from their
wild ancestors. We see that the
plants look different from wild
ones. This is what is talked about
as the Neolithic revolution, where
the domestication of plants and
animals started and people set
tled down and built villages. This
is the stage we also want to look
into and see what kind of plants
were domesticated â€”we have a
lot of questions. There were a lot
of seeds and tubers. These early
plants that were used by humans
led to Homo erectus [a likely pred
ecessor of Homo sapiens], but
when they become domesticated is
difficult to tell.
