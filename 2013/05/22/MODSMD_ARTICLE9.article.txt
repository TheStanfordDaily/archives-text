## Senate talks fossil fuel divestment 
### LUCY SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fossil Free Stanford, a student
group focused on prompting Uni
versity divestment from fossil fuels,
dominated business at the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate's May 21
meeting. The Senate also discussed
its role in the University's judicial
process and passed three bills that
supported the Graduate Student
Council's 30K challenge, upgrades
of the ASSU accounting staff's
computers, and the budget for fis
cal year 2013-14.
The Fossil Free group, led by
Michael Penuelas 'l5, Yari Greaney
'l5, Shane Johnson 'l6 and Sophie
Harrison 'l6, has demanded that
the University immediately freeze
investments in the fossil fuel indus
try and fully divest from all fossil
fuels within the next five years. The
group, whose efforts began with a
petition that gathered more than
1,000 signatures, framed calling on
the Senate for support as potential
ly putting pressure on the Universi
ty to divest.

"Stanford is known for being on
the cutting edge of innovation. We
can lead this movement toward a
clean energy future," Harrison
said, stressing the importance of
the Senate's role in the process.
"We are asking for you to help
Stanford take a stand. You are the
elected representatives of our stu
dent body. This is our legacy as a
University, and this is your legacy
as our senators."
To date, five schools all liber
al arts colleges have divested.
The half-hour presentation dom
inated the majority of open forum
and received an enthusiastic recep
tion from senators, with a straw poll
showing 13 in favor. While senators
expressed unanimous support of
the bill's fundamentals, some sena
tors voiced concerns with the lan
guage of the bill.
Referencing the ASSU's bylaws,
Senator John-Lancaster Finley 'l6
questioned whether the bill would
fall within the scope of the Senate's
responsibilities given the lack of a
direct impact that divestment
might have on students, a concern

that went generally unchallenged
by both Fossil Free and other sena
tors.
Despite the Senate's positive re
ception to the bill's concept, sena
tors said they were undecided on
how they might vote on the resolu
tion itself.
"I voted yes for the idea, but I
am still undecided how I would vote
on the bill itself," said Senator Abby
Dow 'l6.
The Senate plans to vote on a re
vised resolution next week.
Concerns over judicial conduct
In the remaining minutes of
open forum, Finley and Senator
Hisham Al-Falih 'l6 suggested that
the Advocacy and Administration
and Rules committees work togeth
er to address the controversy sur
rounding recent allegations of bias
and misconduct in the University's
judicial process. Senators were
generally supportive of ASSU ac
tion on the issue.
