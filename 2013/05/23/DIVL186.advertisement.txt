Stanford Continuing Studies presents
Haydn on Trial!
An Evening with the Saint Michael Trio
Was he trivial and simplistic? Formulaic? A left-brained technician cranking out
purely mechanical constructions? A mere stepping stone to Mozart and Beethoven?
Franz Joseph Flaydn (1732-1809) has been accused of all of these things. In a special
"informance" pitting the audience as jury, the Saint Michael Trio will defend
Flaydn against his critics in a courtroom-style drama incorporating slides, commentary,
and demonstrations of Haydn's compositional devices. As primary evidence, the Trio
will present Haydn's "Piano Trio in C Major, No. 43 (Hob. XV:27)."
