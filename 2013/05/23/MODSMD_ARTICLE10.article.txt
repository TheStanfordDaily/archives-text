### CAMERON MILLER â€“ Cameron Miller 
Hey all, Yesterday
was even quieter than
Hiesday for our program
here at home. The morning distance crew
practice was comprised of Will, Garrett, Thomas,
Luke and myself. Starting from the track around 7:20
a.m., we headed out going west on Campus Drive to
wards the hospital, eventually connecting with Ju
nipero Serra and then onto Alpine Road.
After the run, a few of us headed to weight
room for our usual 30-minute Wednesday session.
Under the previous coaching staff, distance runners
didn't hit the weight room at all, but it's something
Coach Milt believes will lead to us becoming more
well-rounded athletes. Most of our work focuses on
core stability and bodyweight upper-body exercises.
In the afternoon, freshman sprinter Jack Shumway
could be seen doing some run-throughs over hur
dles and pole vaulter Garrett Starkey did some
short sprints up and down the home stretch. All in
all, it was a relatively uneventful day for those ath
letes still on campus.
That's because right now, our 35 regional ath
letes and the coaching staff are in Austin, Texas, as
the regional competition begins today. Geoff Tabor
will start things off in the first round of the discus at
noon, while the running events get underway at 4:30
p.m. with Kori Carter and Kala Stepter running the
opening round of the 400-meter hurdles. Molly Mc-
Namara and Tate Murray will follow in the 1500-me
ter at 5:30 p.m., and Mike, Stutz, Marco and Justin
will inn the same event starting a half-hour later.
Also at 6 p.m., high jumpers Jules Sharpe and
Dartis Willis will compete in their preliminary
heats while two-time Ail-American long jumper
Karynn Dunn will jump in her signature event.
The 2012 Olympic finalist Steve Solomon will run
in the opening round of the 400-meter race at 7:45
p.m., with our 800-meter trio of Justine Fedronic,
Amy Weissenbach and Claudia Saunders compet
ing in their first-round races shortly thereafter.
Jim Rosa's 10,000-meter race at 9:40 p.m. will end
Thursday's action for Stanford ... it will certainly
be a busy day.
With the 2012-13 cross country and track and
field season almost behind us, I would be remiss if
I didn't familiarize you with our incoming recruit
ing classes. Once again on the men's side, we will
bring in the top distance runners in the nation, a
group headlined by two-time Footlocker National
Championship finalist and 2012 runner-up Sean
McGorty from Fairfax, Va., who will have an oppor
tunity to make an immediate impact this fall in
