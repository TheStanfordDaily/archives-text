# Appel named Pac-12 Baseball Scholar-Athlete of the Year
## 
### â€“ Sam Fisher 
Senior starting pitcher Mark Appel
was named the Pac-12 Baseball Scholar-
Athlete of the Year on Wednesday. Appel
was a Pac-12 All-Academic honorable
mention each of the past two seasons.
Appel finished his degree in Manage
ment Science and Engineering (MS&E)
last quarter. The senior was drafted No. 8
overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the
2012 Major League Baseball Draft, but
decided to return for his senior season.
Appel is 9-4 with a 2.20 ERA in 13
starts for the Cardinal this season. The
righty is finishing his third season as the
Friday-night starter for Stanford, and
last week he tied the Stanford career
strikeout record.
Each school in the Pac-12 can nomi
nate one player in each sport for the

award. A committee of Pac-12 staff mem
bers then vote on the nominees to deter
mine the winner. Athletic and academic
accomplishments are both taken into con
sideration.
Appel is also in the running for most
awards in college baseball, including the
Golden Spikes Award, the Senior CLASS
Award and many Ail-American honors.
Stanford is riding a four-game win
ning streak into its final series of the reg
ular season against UCLA this weekend
at Sunken Diamond. The Cardinal's re
cent streak may put it in a position to earn
a postseason berth, but barring any un
precedented events, Friday will be Ap
pel's last home collegiate start.
