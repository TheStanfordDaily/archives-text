# Three players made tennis' dream reality

### Joseph Beyda 
Back in March, I wrote
that college tennis is the
ultimate intersection of
team and individual
sports. That statement
has never felt more true.
On Tuesday night, Cardinal
women's tennis pulled off the ulti
mate team accomplishment by win
ning its 17th national championship,
keeping alive a 36-year NCAA title
streak for Stanford's athletics. It up
set four top-five teams in the final
rounds of the tournament, including
No. 1 Florida and No. 3 Texas A&M
in the semis and finals, staying tough
through three 4-3 wins over that
stretch. And it may have just won
Stanford a 19th straight Learfield
Sports Directors' Cup in the process.
But make no mistake; the Cardi
nal's title run was so interesting be
cause of the individuals on courts one,
two and three.
It started with freshman Rrista
Hardebeck on Monday night. Stan
ford needed to win one of its two re
maining singles matches against the
Gators to advance to the finals, and
Hardebeck was up against the wall.
Her opponent, Alexandra Cercone,
was just pushing the ball back and
waiting for the young Hardebeck to
make a mistake; she eked out a first
set tiebreak with that strategy. Hard
ebeck came back flustered, quickly
falling to 1-5 in the second set.
But the freshman, who has strug
gled with inconsistency throughout
her rookie season despite leading the
Cardinal in wins, grew up in that mo
ment. She tied the set with two
straight breaks and won the tiebreak,
eventually taking the decisive third
