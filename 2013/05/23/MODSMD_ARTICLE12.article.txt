# Three players made tennis' dream reality
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Back in March, I wrote
that college tennis is the
ultimate intersection of
team and individual
sports. That statement
has never felt more true.
On Tuesday night, Cardinal
women's tennis pulled off the ulti
mate team accomplishment by win
ning its 17th national championship,
keeping alive a 36-year NCAA title
streak for Stanford's athletics. It up
set four top-five teams in the final
rounds of the tournament, including
No. 1 Florida and No. 3 Texas A&M
in the semis and finals, staying tough
through three 4-3 wins over that
stretch. And it may have just won
Stanford a 19th straight Learfield
Sports Directors' Cup in the process.
But make no mistake; the Cardi
nal's title run was so interesting be
cause of the individuals on courts one,
two and three.
It started with freshman Rrista
Hardebeck on Monday night. Stan
ford needed to win one of its two re
maining singles matches against the
Gators to advance to the finals, and
Hardebeck was up against the wall.
Her opponent, Alexandra Cercone,
was just pushing the ball back and
waiting for the young Hardebeck to
make a mistake; she eked out a first
set tiebreak with that strategy. Hard
ebeck came back flustered, quickly
falling to 1-5 in the second set.
But the freshman, who has strug
gled with inconsistency throughout
her rookie season despite leading the
Cardinal in wins, grew up in that mo
ment. She tied the set with two
straight breaks and won the tiebreak,
eventually taking the decisive third

set to send Stanford to the fi
nal.
If Monday night's semi
was about the Cardinal's
youth, Tlxesday night's final
was about its veterans. Top
singles player Nicole Gibbs
was supposed to be dominant
as a junior, but the reigning
NCAA doubles and singles
champion wasn't even ranked
at the beginning of the year.
She lost three straight match
es in late March and early
April before taking time off
with an injury.
A few of us at The Daily al
so wondered how Gibbs, who
is turning pro after this sea
son, could leave her team be
hind to compete in pro events
this winter and spring. She
missed Stanford's Feb. 16 dual
against Saint Mary's to com
pete in the $25,000 Rancho
Santa Fe; Gibbs made it to the
final, but 500 miles to the
north her team was upset by
the Gaels, just the Cardinal's
third loss at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium since 1999.
Any thought that Gibbs is
n't a team player was
squashed on Thesday night.
After creaming the nation's

top singles player, Florida's
Lauren Embree, 6-0, 6-1 in
the semifinals, Gibbs came out
flat against the Aggies and
dropped the first set of her fi
nals match 0-6. She had never
been blanked in a set in her
three years on the Farm, and
she was broken early in the
second set, falling behind 0-2.
"It's really hard to see your
No. 1 player go down 6-0," she
told GoStanford.com. "Just sit
ting there, thinking about the
impact I was having on my
team from losing, just made
me dig a little bit deeper."
Just four games from los
ing the match, Gibbs respond
ed dominantly, reeling off 12
straight games for the 0-6,6-2,
6-0 win. The win kept the Car
dinal alive while Gibbs' class
mate, Kristie Ahn, duked it
out for the national title on
court two.
Aim's path to the final was
perhaps the most interesting.
At the end of an All-American
freshman season, she suffered
an ankle injury that left her on
the sidelines for the Cardinal's
runner-up finish in the 2011
NCAA Iburnament—held on
her home court, no less. She
would play in only three dual
matches as a sophomore due to
other injuries.
But after fighting to make it
back onto the court, Ahn en
joyed every minute of her jun

ior season. You could tell just
how much she wanted to be
there. "So good, Krista," she
would shout between points
when Hardebeck was dominat
ing an opponent. So it was only
fitting that Ahn was the one to
clinch the final on Ihesday with
the match knotted up at 3-3.
"When I got to 2-2 in the
third set, I was smiling," she
told GoStanford.com. "I was
having the best time of my life
because I was thinking about
how absurd it was that it was
coming down to me."
The Cardinal didn't win a
17th national championship in
women's tennis because of the
program's rich tradition. It
won because of Hardebeck,
the mature freshman, Gibbs,
the talented team leader, and
Ahn, the resilient veteran.
It will be a long time before
we forget the title that extend
ed Stanford's NCAA champi
onship streak to 37 years. But
it will be even longer before
we forget the three characters
w T ho made it happen.

It will be the longest time be
fore people forget Joseph Bey
da's victory at the Preakness
Stakes as the tallest jockey
that ever lived. Send him
