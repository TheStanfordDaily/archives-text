# Women's golf tied for fifth after second round at NCAAs
## 
### â€“ Cameron Miller 
After two rounds of play at
the NCAA Championships,
the No. 10 Stanford women's
golf team is in a tie for fifth
place with No. 7 Purdue at 2-
over par 578, three strokes
out of third but 18 behind No.
IUSC. Individually, freshman
Mariah Stackhouse is alone
in fifth after a 4-under 68 sec
ond round, four shots behind
tournament leader Stephanie
Meadow of Alabama.

Rain and lightning de
layed Wednesday's round for
more than two hours, and
while the Cardinal was able
to get back on the course and
complete its round, six teams
have yet to finish. Their sec

ond-round play will resume
today at 7:25 a.m. EST, with
the third round starting at its
regularly scheduled time.
The delay only affected
one Stanford golfer, freshman
Lauren Kim, who was about
to attempt her final putt on
her final hole of the day when
play was suspended. Kim
went on to par the hole and
now sits in a tie for 28th at 2-
over 146. Sophomore Mariko
Tumangan, riding a nice wave
of momentum from the Pac
-12 and West Regional tourna
ments, is in a tie for 15th at 1-
under after an even-par sec
ond round of 72.
As a team, the Cardinal

shot two strokes lower on
Wednesday than it did in
Tuesday's first round, as four
of its five golfers improved on
their previous day's score.
Senior Sally Watson, playing
in her fourth NCAA Champi
onships, lowered her score
from 76 to 73, but was out
done by junior Danielle
Frasier's eight-shot improve
ment from 84 to 76. With its
current positioning, this
team is almost guaranteed to
place much better than Stan
ford's three previous NCAA
teams, which had an average
finish of 22nd.
