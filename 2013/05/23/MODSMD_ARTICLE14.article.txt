## GROWING IN A MODERN WORLD The
						Promise of Precision Agriculture 
### Graciela Watrous 
No matter where it is prac
ticed in the world, agricul
ture relies heavily on water
and soil quality. We are in the
process of exhausting both.
The collapse of water and soil
quality takes many forms globally:
over-fertilization in Asia, nutrient
depletion in American soil, exorbi
tant draining from the Ogallala
aquifer in the western US and high
salinity of water in Africa. Climate
change is surely exacerbating this
problem, shifting weight in the
ever-precarious balancing act be
tween what man does and what man
can sustain. As most people know,
the United States suffered a severe
drought this past year that may end
up costing this country more tax
payer dollars than any other natu
ral disaster in the history of Ameri
ca. More of these sorts of events are
on their way.
Around the globe, climate
change will upset traditional forms
of agriculture. For example, in
creasing temperatures will affect
developing nations in which the ma
jority of agriculture is rain-fed.
Adaptation to a more sporadic and
extreme weather system will al
most certainly be necessary.
CGIAR, for instance, released a
2012 study stating that agriculture
was responsible for 30 percent of
greenhouse gas emissions, most of
which comes from developed na
tions.
In order to combat these
changes, agriculture (especially in
developed nations) should bring it
self up to date technologically, tak
ing advantage of the internet and
advancements in weather-tracking
technology and positioning moni
tors. Luckily, this form of agricul
ture already exists: it's called "pre
cision agriculture."
Precision agriculture is the use
of modern technology to create a
more efficient and site-specific form
of agriculture. It aims to optimize
farm inputs, improve efficiency and
reduce pollution destructive to the
environment. Technologies tradi
tionally used in this form of agricul
ture include GPS, GIS and Variable
Rate Treatment (VRT).
This technology takes several
forms and serves many different
purposes. Most improve efficiency
and therefore have the potential to
reduce the use of exhaustible re
sources and greenhouse gas emis
sions. Forms of precision agricul
ture technology can communicate
when and which fields need to be
watered and when they don't, as
well as when fields need to be fertil
ized or not. It can categorize soil
with a level of detail that allows a
farmer to plant certain crops in cer
tain areas that, given this new infor
mation, he knows will grow well
there. These technologies can mon
itor crop yields and space the seeds
efficiently in fields to grow as much
food per acre as possible for a given
plant. All this can lead to less water
and pesticide use, which, in turn,
can reduce things like the hypoxic
zone in the Gulf of Mexico.
In 2006, 45 percent of corn and
soy acres in the US used yield mon
itors, which are often the first form

of precision technology that farm
ers adopt. A USDA-initiated study
showed that corn and soy yields
were significantly higher for farm
ers that adopted this technology
and that, overall, these same farm
ers had reduced fuel costs and use
for these acres. The United States
uses almost all of its available
arable land for crop production, and
the rest of the world is increasingly
doing the same. Forest is being con
verted to cropland to meet food de
mand and that demand will only in
crease as the world population
grows to over 9 billion people in the
next 40 years. While it is true that
out current agricultural system
produces enough food to feed the
people of the planet, and that
hunger is in many ways a distribu
tion issue, that doesn't mean we
shouldn't be concerned with using
land area as efficiently as possible,
which precision agriculture can
help us do.
But of course there are some
costs to implementing this technol
ogy, both in the U.S. and abroad.
The first is that capital costs are
high. The technology, given that it is
all relatively new, can be extremely
expensive and does not necessarily
pay itself off right away. For tech
nologies that monitor input-to-out
put ratios, it may take years for the
machines to collect enough data be
fore a farmer can change his prac
tices to more efficient ones.
Furthermore, these technolo
gies are not always the most user
friendly, and it may be hard for
farmers to understand the implica
tions of the data. Implementing this
technology can only be part of the
answer; it can only reduce green
house gas emissions by so much and
it can only save so much of these
limited resources. While precision
agriculture should be part of the an
swer, it does not solve these prob
lems completely.
No matter the strength of the
sustainable agricultural movement
in the U.S., which often advocates
for a more localized agriculture sys
tem, it is likely that large-scale, in
dustrial farming will continue to
make up the majority of agriculture
in this country. Given that fact, I
think it's important that we make
this system as sustainable as possi
ble. Precision agriculture seems to
be on the right track.

Around the world,
climate change will
upset traditional
forms of agriculture.
