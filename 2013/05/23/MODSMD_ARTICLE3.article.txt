Cassandra Brooks, a first-year doctor
al student at the Emmett Interdiscipli
nary Program in Environment and Re
sources, recently completed a trip on an
icebreaker vessel through the Ross Sea in
Antarctica with the National Science
Foundation (NSF). During her journey,
Brooks researched marine protection and
blogged for National Geographic; more re
cently, she posted a time-lapse video on
You Tube of the icebreaker traveling
through the Ross Sea that has collected
over 570,000 hits. The Daily sat down with
Brooks to discuss her research, what it
was like living on the icebreaker and what
kind of response she has received from the
You Tube video.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Have you al
ways been interested in marine biology,
or did you discover your passion for it
later in life?
Cassandra Brooks: I've always loved
the ocean and always loved the little ani
mals that live there. I was an obsessive
tide-pooler, and whenever I could get to
the ocean I would as a child... But some
times I'm torn between outreach work
ing with people and the science. And I
think policy is a neat fusion of those things
because you have to work with people, but
you have to work with the science too, and
you can hopefully have an impact on con

servation ... But Antarctica I never
would have dreamed I'd be able to go
there. That was serendipity, and changed
my whole life.
TSD: How long have you been blogging
for National Geographic?
CB: This is my fourth trip to the
Antarctic and usually I do some sort of

blogging... I think it's really important to
provide a lens for not just my friends and
family, though I love being able to show
them, but also for the public. I wanted to
step up this time so I actually pitched to
National Geographic... I like to at least
write a blog about each of my most amaz-

mg experiences.
TSD: What are the most
memorable experiences
that you have written
about?
CB: When you've been in
24-hour daylight and all of a
sudden the sun sets for the
first time —it was so silly,
but it was such a magical ex
perience. It just felt so sur
real ... it just felt like touch
ing infinity. I don't know how
to better say it than that.
When you're down there,
you're really experiencing
the world without the buzz of
cell phones and meetings,
and all the stuff that really
takes us away from our envi
ronment. So for me it's al
ways really grounding and
reconnecting to be down
there and to be experiencing
the first sunset.
And the other highlight
obviously was to be so close
to emperor penguins.
They're huge birds, and
they're just absolutely amaz
ing animals they're super
inquisitive and curious, and
they walk right up to you
and check you out. And I
don't mean to humanize
them I wouldn't want to
do that but the sensation
we got was that they were
coming up and checking us
all out, and curious about
this huge boat that suddenly
showed up. More and more
of them came everyday.
TSD: What kind of re
search are you doing in
Antarctica, and why did
you decide to do this re
search?
CB: It was a National Sci
ence Foundation trip that
was paid for by the founda
tion and all the scientists on
board basically wrote a grant
together to do this work. And
the big thing they wanted to
do they called it the "trac
er's cruise" —was basically
trace this huge phytoplank
ton bloom in the Ross Sea. It
happens every summer... it's
been studied, but what hasn't
been studied is what happens
to all the phytoplankton,
which is a huge source of car
bon and a huge source of food
to the environment. Where
does it go? Does it get eaten
right there? Does it sink to

the bottom? Does it get
transported elsewhere? So
that was a big question we
were interested in.

My background is in
Antarctic marine science.
However, in recent years
I've been moving much more
towards outreach and policy,
and trying to inform policy
especially in the Antarctic,
and especially towards ma
rine protection... I'm trying
to understand how the poli
cies and politics work in the
Antarctic, and how are we
going to achieve this huge
feat of marine protection,
with the ultimate hope of
learning how we can better
protect the Antarctic and
make compromises between
fishing and protection in this
international space.

TSD: What is it like to live
on an icebreaker?
CB: It was awesome. This
was my first time on an ice
breaker and it was really
amazing. A big reason I
wanted to do the video is that
it was such an amazing sen
sation to stand there on the
front of the boat or up on the
bridge, and see the shape
changing everyday it was
such a dynamic environment
... it's a place where humans
haven't damaged the envi
ronment, so it's just an amaz
ing place to be able to do re
search ... The sounds you
hear the sounds of the
shrieking steel on ice, and
being on a boat that was so
powerful was comforting, be
cause I've been down there
on boats that were far less
strong. The boat we were on
was super comfortable.

TSD: Are you surprised by
how many people have
watched your video? What

kind of response have you
received?
CB: I was super sur
prised. Usually I spend all
this time making a video and
my mom is the only one who
gets excited about it, which
is fine because I'm happy
that she's excited about it.
But I posted it on a Friday
morning and really just

wanted to get it out there...
and then literally overnight
it went off the hook and I
couldn't tell you why... But
I'm super happy because I
think it's provided a lens into
Antarctica for people, and so
often people wonder why we
go down there, but now peo
ple are emailing me and say
ing how beautiful it is and
understanding why I do re
search there. And especially
now working towards ma
rine protection in the
Antarctic, I think it's really
important for people to see
what an amazing landscape
it is and to feel the place.
