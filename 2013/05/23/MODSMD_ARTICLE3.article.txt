Cassandra Brooks, a first-year doctor
al student at the Emmett Interdiscipli
nary Program in Environment and Re
sources, recently completed a trip on an
icebreaker vessel through the Ross Sea in
Antarctica with the National Science
Foundation (NSF). During her journey,
Brooks researched marine protection and
blogged for National Geographic; more re
cently, she posted a time-lapse video on
You Tube of the icebreaker traveling
through the Ross Sea that has collected
over 570,000 hits. The Daily sat down with
Brooks to discuss her research, what it
was like living on the icebreaker and what
kind of response she has received from the
You Tube video.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Have you al
ways been interested in marine biology,
or did you discover your passion for it
later in life?
Cassandra Brooks: I've always loved
the ocean and always loved the little ani
mals that live there. I was an obsessive
tide-pooler, and whenever I could get to
the ocean I would as a child... But some
times I'm torn between outreach work
ing with people and the science. And I
think policy is a neat fusion of those things
because you have to work with people, but
you have to work with the science too, and
you can hopefully have an impact on con

servation ... But Antarctica I never
would have dreamed I'd be able to go
there. That was serendipity, and changed
my whole life.
TSD: How long have you been blogging
for National Geographic?
CB: This is my fourth trip to the
Antarctic and usually I do some sort of

blogging... I think it's really important to
provide a lens for not just my friends and
family, though I love being able to show
them, but also for the public. I wanted to
step up this time so I actually pitched to
National Geographic... I like to at least
write a blog about each of my most amaz-
