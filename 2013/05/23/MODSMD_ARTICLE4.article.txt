# D-CEL boosts community learning effort
## 
### BAKER TILNEY 
In an effort to incorporate community involve
ment into undergraduate education, several Univer
sity offices have collaborated to offer a three-year
Directors of Community Engaged Learning (D
-CEL) pilot program.
The Office of the Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education (VPUE), the Haas Center for Public
Service and the Humanities & Sciences Dean's Of
fice created the program, which will work with stu
dents to find potential internships and community
partners in the fields of education, health and the en
vironment.
"Practical learning hands-on experience, stu
dents working with community partners is funda
mental to what we ... see as part of a Stanford educa
tion for the future," said Vice Provost of Undergrad
uate Education Harry Elam.
Thomas Schnaubelt, executive director of the
Haas Center, emphasized that the program would
expand on existing community-engaged learning ini
tiatives.
"A lot of people know about the work that we do
around community service ... but fewer people know
about the work that we do to connect faculty to com
munity-based learning opportunities to make it a
part of their courses or research agenda," he noted.
The program was prompted in part by the sug
gestions of the Study of Undergraduate Education
at Stanford (SUES) report.
"Between the vision and leadership of the Haas
Center, the energy and entrepreneurialism of Stan
ford students and the awakening interest of academ
ic departments and programs, Stanford has the po
tential to become a national leader in community
based learning," the report stated.
The program will likely focus on expanding com
munity-based learning opportunities among lower
level classes in order to complement existing upper-
division options.
"What we're going to be
doing with these positions is
targeting [certain] courses
like Thinking Matters, the
Ways of Thinking Ways of
Doing [graduation require
ments]," Schnaubelt said.
"It's a priority for us to get
more courses that are in the
lower [tiers]."
In addition to connecting
courses to the community,
the program will coordinate
internships for students in
three focus areas educa
tion, health and the environ
ment chosen because of
widespread existing inter
est and involvement by stu
dents and faculty alike.
"We know [these] are
three areas that students
care deeply about and ex
press interest in, so it's a

place to start this contact in
the pilot," Elam said.
VPUE, the Haas Center
and the School of Humani
ties & Sciences' Dean's Of
fice have begun the process
of hiring the program's
three directors by estab
lishing a faculty advisory
committee and speaking
with people currently in
volved with community-en
gaged learning, intending
that the directors start
work at the beginning of the
2013-14 academic year.
"We want to make sure
that there's a connection be
tween what these new posi
tions will be doing and
what's already happening,"
Schnaubelt said.
If the pilot proves suc
cessful in aiding students
and faculty over the next
three years, Elam said that
he anticipates continued
funding.
