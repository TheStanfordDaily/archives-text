In an effort to incorporate community involve

around community service ... but fewer people know
about the work that we do to connect faculty to com
munity-based learning opportunities to make it a
part of their courses or research agenda," he noted.
The program was prompted in part by the sug
gestions of the Study of Undergraduate Education
at Stanford (SUES) report.
"Between the vision and leadership of the Haas
Center, the energy and entrepreneurialism of Stan
ford students and the awakening interest of academ

based learning," the report stated.
The program will likely focus on expanding com
munity-based learning opportunities among lower
level classes in order to complement existing upper-
