### â€“ Edward Ngai 
Annelise Barron, associate professor of bio
engineering, has been charged with felony parent
abduction after being arrested in Hawaii on Dec.
24, 2012, and extradited to California about two
weeks later. She is currently out on bail.
According to authorities, Barron, her three
children and their nanny left for the Hawaiian is
land of Kauai on Dec. 17 without notifying the chil
dren's fathers. Due to the trip, Barron missed a
court date with Judson Butler, the father of their
infant son, on Dec. 17 and a family court appear
ance on Dec. 18 with Theodore Jardetzky 'B2, pro
fessor of structural biology and Barron's es
tranged husband.
"Given that [Barron]... completely stopped us
ing [her] cellphone... we strongly believed that
Barron's intention was to flee
with the kids and shut off all
possible contact with Jardet
zky and Butler," wrote Detec
tive Anjanette Holler of the
Palo Alto Police Department
in a report.
Barron's live-in nanny, So
ma Audino, faces three counts
of depriving a lawful custodi
an of right to custody and one
count of child abduction. Bail
was originally set at $500,000
but Barron's was dropped to
$lOO,OOO and Audino's to
$55,000.
"I'm a tenured professor
I love my job, and I find it
amazing that anyone would
think I'd run away and not
think I'd be detected," Barron
told the Palo Alto Weekly.
Barron has yet to enter a
plea.
Authorities believe Barron
intended to flee to Kauai in part
because of alleged moving activi
ty out of her Palo Alto apartment
on Dec. 17. At an All Aboard Mi
ni Storage site, an employee re
ported seeing a woman match
ing Barron's description acting
"frantic and hunied."
University spokeswoman
Lisa Lapin declined to com
ment on specific personnel
matters.
