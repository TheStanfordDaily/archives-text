## Robots join staff at Stanford Hospital 
### NIUNIU TEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Hospital staff
was recently trained to manage
the two unusually metallic mem
bers that joined the housekeeping
team in a soft-launch this month:
Frost and Dazzler.
The two robots, similar in ap
pearance to Star Wars' R2-D2,
cost $BO,OOO each. They make
rounds through rooms that have
housed patients with particularly
contagious or drug-resistant con
ditions to ensure that the next pa
tient enters a room free of harmful
germs.
The robots are also used daily
in rooms that house patients on
"contact precaution" those who
are extremely susceptible to infec
tion and disinfect operating
rooms at night.
"This product was really of in
terest to us, particularly because
our patients are really the sickest
of the sick," said Sasha Madison,

manager of infection prevention
and control at Stanford Hospital.
"Also, it really goes along with
Stanford's policy of green control."
Manufactured and distributed
by Xenex, a firm that produces
UV-disinfection systems, the ro
bots use a specialized pulsing UV
light to disrupt the nucleic acids in
microorganisms.
The Stanford Hospital is the
only hospital in Northern Califor
nia to have put the Xenex robots to
use, though the robots have also
been employed in Southern Cali
fornia and at select hospitals
across the country including the
Louisiana Continuing Care Hospi
tal, Doylestown Hospital and
Westchester Medical Center.
According to Xenex's website,
the pulsing light prevents danger
ous cells from replicating and re
pairing themselves, and also caus
es these cells to mutate and die.
The robot's light cycle lasts a total
of just five minutes.
"We wanted something
that was efficient, because
we get a lot of patients in
here â€”about 12 to 15 every
day," Madison said. " We
can't afford for a room to be
unavailable for very long."
While Frost and Dazzler
can easily disinfect all the pa
tient rooms, Housekeeping
Department Director Brad
Igler said he has considered
purchasing another Xenex
robot to work in operating
rooms used for surgery.
"It's just so great for the
patients, knowing that the
room has been UV-disinfec
ted and has that extra layer
of security," Igler said.
Although less than a
month has passed since the
robots were officially added
to the disinfecting proce
dure, the few tests that have
been carried out since then

have proven the machines to
be very effective.
"There's one hospital that
did a test and it showed that
it decreased the rate of infec
tion by 67 percent," Igler
said, referring to the infec
tion rates due to C-DIFF
and MRSA microorganisms.
Although this is the first
time robots have been used
to disinfect rooms at the
Stanford Hospital, mecha
nized helpers have become
prevalent in hospitals around
the country to help doctors
treat and care for patients,
and some forms of assistive
technology now play funda
mental roles during surgery.
While some robot enthu
siasts have predicted that
hospitals will soon be heavily
populated with largely au
tonomous robots, Igler ex
pressed certainty that hu
mans will be involved in the
disinfecting stage of caring
for patients for the foresee
able future.
"The person is very im
portant in the cleaning
process," Igler said. "It

would take such sophistica
tion for a machine to do the
same thing. I don't see it hap
pening anytime in the near
future."
Madison agreed, empha
sizing that a human element
is almost always necessary in
the disinfecting stage of the
patient care process.
"Someone always needs
to take off the organic mate
rial first," she said. "The
housekeepers will open the
drawers and disinfect all the
surfaces."
Even after the robots
sweep through the rooms,
the hospital housekeepers
have continued their normal
procedure of cleaning and
disinfecting all surfaces with
bleach and germicidal solu
tions.
"I think it's important to
note that these do not re
place the work that the
housekeeper does," Madison
said. "It's in addition to. It's
above and beyond."
