## Robots join staff at Stanford Hospital 
### NIUNIU TEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Hospital staff
was recently trained to manage
the two unusually metallic mem
bers that joined the housekeeping
team in a soft-launch this month:
Frost and Dazzler.
The two robots, similar in ap
pearance to Star Wars' R2-D2,
cost $BO,OOO each. They make
rounds through rooms that have
housed patients with particularly
contagious or drug-resistant con
ditions to ensure that the next pa
tient enters a room free of harmful
germs.
The robots are also used daily
in rooms that house patients on
"contact precaution" those who
are extremely susceptible to infec
tion and disinfect operating
rooms at night.
"This product was really of in
terest to us, particularly because
our patients are really the sickest
of the sick," said Sasha Madison,

manager of infection prevention
and control at Stanford Hospital.
"Also, it really goes along with
Stanford's policy of green control."
Manufactured and distributed
by Xenex, a firm that produces
UV-disinfection systems, the ro
bots use a specialized pulsing UV
light to disrupt the nucleic acids in
microorganisms.
The Stanford Hospital is the
only hospital in Northern Califor
nia to have put the Xenex robots to
use, though the robots have also
been employed in Southern Cali
fornia and at select hospitals
across the country including the
Louisiana Continuing Care Hospi
tal, Doylestown Hospital and
Westchester Medical Center.
According to Xenex's website,
the pulsing light prevents danger
ous cells from replicating and re
pairing themselves, and also caus
es these cells to mutate and die.
The robot's light cycle lasts a total
