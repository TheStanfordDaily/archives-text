### – Marshall Watkins 
A Stanford junior and sev
eral other individuals have
been falsely depicted by a fake
news release as leaders of a
campaign to boycott Iran and
other Middle Eastern nations.
Josh Schott 'l4, co-presi
dent of Students for Palestin
ian Equal Rights, is quoted by
the news release nominally
released by a non-existent boy
cott campaign —as advocat
ing for Israeli military inter
vention in Iran and Syria. The
news release also identified a
number of activists and organ
izations previously critical of
Israel as supposedly support
ive of the boycott campaign.
The release has since been
reprinted and characterized as
accurate by several sources,
among them the Palestinian
News Network.
Schott told The Chronicle
of Higher Education that the
potential for the release's
broad dissemination had con
cerned him.
"I don't want people think
ing I actually said or did those
things," Schott emphasized.
