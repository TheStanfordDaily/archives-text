### CAMERON MILLER â€“ Cameron Miller 
Hey all, Thursday was
another non-eventful
day on the home front for Stan
ford track and field, with most of the action
taking place at the NCAA West Regional in Austin,
Texas. The freshmen male distance runners met early
this morning for their longer run of the day as per usu
al. What was left of the male and female distance
squads reconvened in the mid-afternoon for their
shake-out runs, drills and strides, and both groups will
meet early tomorrow morning at the track for their
workouts.
On Saturday morning, we'll join up for our long run
and then run on our own on Sunday. The regional team
and the coaching staff will arrive back on campus on
Sunday, and practice will feel a little more normal on
Monday. But this is the nature of track and field even
while your coaches and teammates are competing a cou

continue to work hard, as most of us represent the fu

Coach Milt has really encouraged us freshmen to
keep on our normal routines, even though the coaches
won't be around as much. This group has been doing a
great job of doing just that, and I think it has shown our
discipline and commitment to the team. Hopefully, we'll
all be competing at the regional next year.
Back to the races in Texas. The highlight of the day
was Kori Carter winning her heat of the 400-meter hur
dles, advancing to this evening's national quarterfinal.
It was also a quite successful day for our trio of female
half-milers, Justine, Amy and Claudia. All three made it
through to today's regional final, with Amy and Justine
winning their respective heats. Australian 400-meter
Olympic finalist Steve Solomon finished second in his
heat of his signature event, moving on to the national
quarterfinal this evening.
The dramatics for the day were provided courtesy of
Mike Atchoo, who used a furious kick over the final 50
meters of his 1500-meter prelim to squeeze into Satur
day's regional final. Mike finished fourth in his heat,
