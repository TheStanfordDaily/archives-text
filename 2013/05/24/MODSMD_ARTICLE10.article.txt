### CAMERON MILLER â€“ Cameron Miller 
Hey all, Thursday was
another non-eventful
day on the home front for Stan
ford track and field, with most of the action
taking place at the NCAA West Regional in Austin,
Texas. The freshmen male distance runners met early
this morning for their longer run of the day as per usu
al. What was left of the male and female distance
squads reconvened in the mid-afternoon for their
shake-out runs, drills and strides, and both groups will
meet early tomorrow morning at the track for their
workouts.
On Saturday morning, we'll join up for our long run
and then run on our own on Sunday. The regional team
and the coaching staff will arrive back on campus on
Sunday, and practice will feel a little more normal on
Monday. But this is the nature of track and field even
while your coaches and teammates are competing a cou
ple of states away, the contingent back at home must
continue to work hard, as most of us represent the fu
ture of the program.
Coach Milt has really encouraged us freshmen to
keep on our normal routines, even though the coaches
won't be around as much. This group has been doing a
great job of doing just that, and I think it has shown our
discipline and commitment to the team. Hopefully, we'll
all be competing at the regional next year.
Back to the races in Texas. The highlight of the day
was Kori Carter winning her heat of the 400-meter hur
dles, advancing to this evening's national quarterfinal.
It was also a quite successful day for our trio of female
half-milers, Justine, Amy and Claudia. All three made it
through to today's regional final, with Amy and Justine
winning their respective heats. Australian 400-meter
Olympic finalist Steve Solomon finished second in his
heat of his signature event, moving on to the national
quarterfinal this evening.
The dramatics for the day were provided courtesy of
Mike Atchoo, who used a furious kick over the final 50
meters of his 1500-meter prelim to squeeze into Satur
day's regional final. Mike finished fourth in his heat,
where third to seventh was sepa
rated by one-tenth of a second.
Some of us gathered in the locker
room to watch his race online, with
most of us pulling our hair out over
the final 200 meters, thinking he
may not make it. But Mike's lean at
the line ensured the preservation of
his season, and the guys at home
breathed a collective sigh of relief
when the official results were put
up. C'mon Mike, you almost gave

us a heart attack!
Non-advancers from their first
round preliminaries included throw
er Geoff Tabor, freshman sprinter
Kristyn Williams, 1500-meter run
ners Molly MacNamara, Tate Mur
ray, Justin Brinkley and Marco
Bertolotti, and hurdler Kala Stepter.
This is last blog post in this in
stallment. I would like to thank the
powers that be at The Daily for al
lowing me to give the Stanford
community a small glimpse at our
program and what occurs on a dai
ly basis for Stanford track and field.
Thanks for reading!
