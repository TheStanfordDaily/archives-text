# Tonight's the night to watch Appel

### Sam Fisher 
Life goes pretty fast at
Stanford. It's easy to go
through your time here
and miss so many oppor
tunities.
With only a year and a few weeks
left, I know I certainly won't see
everything that I could here. But
there are some things you can't miss,
and one of them happens tonight.
Go watch senior starting pitcher
Mark Appel pitch tonight at 7 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.
I don't care what your dinner
plans are; I don't care which frat par
ty you need to pregame for. This is
your last chance to watch one of the
best college pitchers of a generation
â€”for free if you're a Stanford stu
dent pitch in one of the nation's
most beautiful college baseball sta
diums.
Appel is a remarkable talent. In
many ways, he is college baseball's
version of Andrew Luck 'l2. I
thought I had seen the last of Appel
at the end of 2012, but after a
shocking Major League Baseball
Draft that saw Appel slip to No. 8
overall, the righty decided to come
back. We couldn't be luckier.
In so many ways, this Stanford
baseball season has been a disap
pointment. Sure, Stanford lost a lot
to the MLB Draft last season, but
with Appel returning and a strong
core of juniors continuing to mature,
I thought this season could be spe
cial, and maybe even end up at the
College World Series in Omaha, Neb.
But barring some sort of mirac
ulous run and after watching
No. 12 Stanford women's tennis
win the NCAA title Tuesday, I
won't count anything out Appel
and this year's squad will see their
season end short of that magical
destination.
Omaha has been a dream of
mine ever since I started broad
casting Stanford baseball games
for KZSU during my freshman
year with Jack Blanchat 'l2 yes,
it is possible to reference Blanchat
in a context outside of men's bas
ketball head coach Johnny
Dawkins. It's still hard to believe
that, with all of the talent I've wit
nessed at Sunken Diamond, there's
a good chance I won't ever make it
to Omaha as a broadcaster.
As tough as that may be for me
to swallow, I can take solace in the
memories of three years of Appel
starts. On Friday nights, I've seen
the progression that I've wanted
from the whole squad.
