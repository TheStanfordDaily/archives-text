# Tonight's the night to watch Appel
## 
### Sam Fisher 
Life goes pretty fast at
Stanford. It's easy to go
through your time here
and miss so many oppor
tunities.
With only a year and a few weeks
left, I know I certainly won't see
everything that I could here. But
there are some things you can't miss,
and one of them happens tonight.
Go watch senior starting pitcher
Mark Appel pitch tonight at 7 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.
I don't care what your dinner
plans are; I don't care which frat par
ty you need to pregame for. This is
your last chance to watch one of the
best college pitchers of a generation
—for free if you're a Stanford stu
dent pitch in one of the nation's
most beautiful college baseball sta
diums.
Appel is a remarkable talent. In
many ways, he is college baseball's
version of Andrew Luck 'l2. I
thought I had seen the last of Appel
at the end of 2012, but after a
shocking Major League Baseball
Draft that saw Appel slip to No. 8
overall, the righty decided to come
back. We couldn't be luckier.
In so many ways, this Stanford
baseball season has been a disap
pointment. Sure, Stanford lost a lot
to the MLB Draft last season, but
with Appel returning and a strong
core of juniors continuing to mature,
I thought this season could be spe
cial, and maybe even end up at the
College World Series in Omaha, Neb.
But barring some sort of mirac
ulous run and after watching
No. 12 Stanford women's tennis
win the NCAA title Tuesday, I
won't count anything out Appel
and this year's squad will see their
season end short of that magical
destination.
Omaha has been a dream of
mine ever since I started broad
casting Stanford baseball games
for KZSU during my freshman
year with Jack Blanchat 'l2 yes,
it is possible to reference Blanchat
in a context outside of men's bas
ketball head coach Johnny
Dawkins. It's still hard to believe
that, with all of the talent I've wit
nessed at Sunken Diamond, there's
a good chance I won't ever make it
to Omaha as a broadcaster.
As tough as that may be for me
to swallow, I can take solace in the
memories of three years of Appel
starts. On Friday nights, I've seen
the progression that I've wanted
from the whole squad.

In 2011,1 remember Appel hav
ing great stuff, but he wasn't domi
nant. I knew he could be great, and
he was pretty darn good already,
but it felt like I was watching some
one with tremendous raw talent
start to figure out how to use it.
The next year, during Appel's
all-important junior season, I saw
the next step. The ballpark had a
special feel on Friday nights.
Every time you walked into
Sunken Diamond, you came with
the knowledge perhaps even ex
pectation that you were going to
see something special. There's
something very cool about seeing
more scouts than there are MLB
teams sitting behind home plate at
every one of a pitcher's starts.
I still remember Appel's first
outing in a scrimmage against his
teammates before the 2012 season.
He faced three hitters, getting two
strikeouts and a weak groundout,
as an absurd number of scouts
looked on in awe.
Most scouts walked out that day

knowing that their teams' first
draft pick would be way too late to
have a chance at reeling in Appel's
talent. He was just too good.
Somehow Appel got even better
this year. The slider is sharper, and
his changeup has come out of
nowhere to be a pitch to lean on
late in games. Every time I walk
into the ballpark on Fridays, a part
of me wonders if it will be the day
when I see a no-hitter or perfect
game. He's just that good.
Whether you've seen him a
dozen times or never been to
Sunken Diamond, tonight is your
last chance to catch Appel's great
ness. It truly is a special experi
ence, especially given how close
you can get to the action. I'm just
looking forward to being able to
give Appel the standing ovation he
deserves as he walks off the mound
for the last time.
And, who knows, maybe we'll
see that perfection.

draft pick would be way too late to
have a chance at reeling in Appel's
talent. He was just too good.
Somehow Appel got even better
this year. The slider is sharper, and
his changeup has come out of
nowhere to be a pitch to lean on
late in games. Every time I walk
into the ballpark on Fridays, a part
of me wonders if it will be the day
when I see a no-hitter or perfect
game. He's just that good.
Whether you've seen him a
dozen times or never been to
Sunken Diamond, tonight is your
last chance to catch Appel's great
ness. It truly is a special experi
ence, especially given how close
you can get to the action. I'm just
looking forward to being able to
give Appel the standing ovation he
deserves as he walks off the mound
for the last time.
And, who knows, maybe we'll
see that perfection.
