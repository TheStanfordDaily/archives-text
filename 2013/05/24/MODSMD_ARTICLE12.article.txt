# LAST CHANCE FOR CARD
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
What a difference a week can make.
Last Friday, few people thought that
the Stanford baseball team had a shot at
making the postseason. But after sweep
ing archrival Cal and dominating Pacific
11-2 on Tuesday, the Cardinal may be
just a series win away from clinching a
regional berth as it hosts No. 11 UCLA
at Sunken Diamond this weekend.

Over the last three seasons, the
NCAA Tournament selection committee
has chosen 19 Pac-10/12 teams, an aver
age of more than six per year. Despite its
struggles this season, Stanford (30-21,
14-13) is currently in fifth place in the
conference, one game ahead of Washing
ton a team with such a poor overall
record (22-31) that it is unlikely to make
the postseason regardless of its Pac-12
finish and two games ahead of de
fending national champion Arizona (31-

21,12-15). So if the Cardinal can win two
games against the Bruins (38-15,20-7), it
would be guaranteed at least a fifth
place finish, with the possibility of pass
ing Arizona State (34-18-1, 15-12) and
sneaking into fourth.
"If we play three good baseball games
with pitchers throwing strikes, our de
fense playing well behind them, our bats
competing at the plate and putting a few
good at-bats together," sophomore Alex
Blandino said, "I think we have a good
chance of completing that goal."
To do that, Stanford's bats will have
to stay hot from its last four games
against a UCLA squad that boasts one
of the best pitching staffs in the Pac-12
and the country. The Bruins' 2.76
team ERA is 17th in Division-I baseball
and third in the conference behind Ore
gon and Oregon State, two teams that
went a combined 6-0 against Stanford
this season.
UCLA's three-man rotation of junior
righties Adam Plutko and Nick Vander
Tuig and sophomore lefty Grant Watson
was dominant in its sweep of archrival
USC last weekend. With saves in all
three games plus a fourth in the Bru
ins' midweek win against UC-Santa Bar
bara — sophomore righty David Berg
also set UCLA's single-season saves
record with 17. Berg's 0.58 ERA in 39
appearances is the lowest in college
baseball.
The Cardinal will counter with a
much more front-heavy rotation when
senior ace Mark Appel takes the mound
tonight in his last start at Sunken Dia
mond. He needs just one strikeout to set
Stanford's career record, which he tied
last week with his 363 rd in Berkeley.
Appel (8-4), however, is coming off
two uncharacteristic outings in which he
allowed a combined nine earned runs in

take at least two of three games from UCLA to have a shot at a postseason berth.
12 innings of work. That's an un
welcome sign for Cardinal fans who
remember the way his junior year
ended, a seven-run shelling at
Florida State in the Super Region
al, and a strong outing tonight
would not only end Appel's 2013
season on a better note but poten
tially extend his senior campaign as
well.
"Mark's one of the most unbe
lievable pitchers I've ever played

behind, if not the best pitcher I've
ever played for," Blandino said.
"We're going to be back there root
ing for him, and I think we have full
confidence that he's going to give
us a great start on Friday."
Head coach Mark Marquess
will likely turn to sophomore John
Hochstatter on Saturday and
freshman Bobby Zarubin on Sun
day, but the Cardinal's rotation has
been unstable all season long.
Neither team is particularly im
posing at the plate the Bruins'
.253 team batting average is the
worst in the Pae-12, with none of
UCLA's regular starters hitting
above .300 but Stanford has put

on a late onslaught. Over its four
game winning streak, the Cardinal
has averaged 13 hits per game,
with juniors Lonnie Kauppila, Bri
an Ragira and Danny Diekroeger
recording hits in all four contests.
Appel goes for the strikeout
record tonight at 7 p.m., followed
by a rare Saturday night game, al
so at 7 p.m. The Cardinal's regular
season concludes at 3 p.m. on Sun
day.

senior ace Mark Appel takes the mound
tonight in his last start at Sunken Dia
mond. He needs just one strikeout to set
Stanford's career record, which he tied
last week with his 363 rd in Berkeley.
Appel (8-4), however, is coming off
two uncharacteristic outings in which he

Senior righthander Mark Appel (above) takes the mound tonight in what could
be the ace's final appearance in a Stanford uniform. The Cardinal will need to
take at least two of three games from UCLA to have a shot at a postseason berth.
12 innings of work. That's an un
welcome sign for Cardinal fans who
remember the way his junior year
ended, a seven-run shelling at
Florida State in the Super Region
al, and a strong outing tonight
would not only end Appel's 2013
season on a better note but poten
tially extend his senior campaign as
well.
"Mark's one of the most unbe
lievable pitchers I've ever played

behind, if not the best pitcher I've
ever played for," Blandino said.
"We're going to be back there root
ing for him, and I think we have full
confidence that he's going to give
us a great start on Friday."
Head coach Mark Marquess
will likely turn to sophomore John
Hochstatter on Saturday and
freshman Bobby Zarubin on Sun
day, but the Cardinal's rotation has
been unstable all season long.
Neither team is particularly im
posing at the plate the Bruins'
.253 team batting average is the
worst in the Pae-12, with none of
UCLA's regular starters hitting
above .300 but Stanford has put

on a late onslaught. Over its four
game winning streak, the Cardinal
has averaged 13 hits per game,
with juniors Lonnie Kauppila, Bri
an Ragira and Danny Diekroeger
recording hits in all four contests.
Appel goes for the strikeout
record tonight at 7 p.m., followed
by a rare Saturday night game, al
so at 7 p.m. The Cardinal's regular
season concludes at 3 p.m. on Sun
day.
The NCAA Tournament partici
pants will be announced on Mon
day at 9 a.m. PDT.
