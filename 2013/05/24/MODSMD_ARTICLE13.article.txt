## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY Corporations and Taxes 
### Adam Johnson 
In the late 19905, Apple Inc. (then
Apple Computer) developed an
advertising campaign entitled
"Think Different." The campaign,
meant to highlight Steve Job's phi
losophy for the company, opens with
the lines "Here's to the crazy ones.
The misfits. The rebels. The trou
blemakers ... They're not fond of
rules." Some 15 years later, execu
tives at Apple can pat themselves on
the backs for living up to this vision.
While Apple may be a model cor
poration in Silicon Valley, it and
CEO Tim Cook have come under
intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill. On
Tuesday, Cook was questioned by a
Senate investigative committee on
the matter of tax evasion.
For those unfamiliar with the sto
ry, a simplified version is this: Apple
has incorporated subsidiaries
throughout the world, some of which
have no employees and are effective
ly run from Cupertino. By strategi
cally locating these subsidiaries, Ap
ple was able to take advantage of
various loopholes to make them vir
tually exempt from paying taxes on
coiporate revenue. One such sub
sidiary, Apple Operations Interna
tional, was incorporated in Ireland
(thus not subject to U.S. tax law) but
largely managed in Cupertino (thus
not subject to Ireland's differing tax
code). So while it drew in roughly 30
billion U.S. dollars in net profit from
2009 to 2012, it paid zero dollars in
taxes over this period.
Like many other citizens and cor
porations, executives at Apple took
advantage of available loopholes in
the tax code, although the size of Ap
ple and the specific loophole exploit
ed make this case stand out. Techni
cally, Apple's actions are legal. On

the moral front, the issue is less
clear. Is Apple obligated to pay more
taxes than it is legally required to
pay? While many on Capitol Hill are
critical of Apple right now, as Rand
Paul rightly pointed out, "Tell me a
politician who is up here and doesn't
try to minimize his taxes." Many
think that Apple even has a duty to
minimize its tax burden.
But if we believe in Kant's cate
gorical imperative where you
should "act only according to that
maxim whereby you can, at the same
time, will that it should become a uni
versal law" then Apple's actions
are morally wrong. If every corpora
tion and individual were to pay sig
nificantly fewer taxes, our nation
would disintegrate. At an extreme, if
no one were to pay taxes, all that
which Apple and other corporations
utilize to maximize profits would be
lost no more legal system to se
cure contracts and property, no more
police and military to make America
safe to do business, no more high
ways and airports to transport capi
tal and no more public education to
supply labor. Perhaps our govern
ment is wasteful at times, but one
cannot deny that Apple and other
corporations benefit greatly from
the services it provides. Even when
Apple produces iPhones in China
and sells them in Germany, the re
search and development that led to
this profit was almost entirely con
ducted in Cupertino.
As it is, though, the popular nar
rative is that those with the least
those who rely on food stamps and
Medicaid profit the most from
our government. This is utterly
false. Rather, it is the wealthiest
among us who are able to make mil-

lions, if not billions, in large part due
to government services. I've men
tioned infrastructure and law and
order already, but even welfare al
lows corporations to get away with
paying poverty-level wages to those
at the bottom of the ladder.
Another popular narrative is
that if we believe in the free market,
we should support the efforts of
these multinational corporations.
But government interference works
both ways: For every hindrance that
government regulation may provide,
our political system also provides
significant spoils to the most well-es
tablished corporations. These firms
can afford to, say, lobby for the cre
ation of tax loopholes that few corpo
rations can take advantage of. In
short, firms like Apple subvert can
free market economics, and we
should hold them accountable.
Right now, Tim Cook and other
corporate executives are demanding
that Congress allow their firms to
bring back the billions of dollars in
profits stored offshore at a single-dig
it tax rate. Perhaps it's their job as top
executives to be greedy. And maybe
some politicians will buy their argu
ments, especially if some Super PAC
funding is attached. But it's our job,
as taxpayers and voters, to not let
these corporations shirk paying taxes
that help fund the nation from which
they profit so greatly And it's our job
to affirm the principles of a free-mar
ket, not a big-business, economy by
demanding that politicians establish a
tax code that is not ripe for exploita
tion by the wealthiest coiporations.
