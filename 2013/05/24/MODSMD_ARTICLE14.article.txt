# SEEING GREEN
## Science's Beautiful Uncertainty 
### Holly Moeller 
Two months ago, I got a very
nei'dy science tattoo. I'd been
debating the tattoo for a cou
ple of years, but of course, no sooner
had my new ink finally healed than a
high-profile new study emerged re
vising the numbers I'd just perma
nently engraved on my skin.
My first instinct was to run back
to the tattoo parlor to have some
footnotes added. But then I remem
bered that, no matter how inaccu
rate science later proved my tattoo
to be, it still represented a histori
cally fundamental idea in oceanog
raphy. As a teaching tool, it would
never die.
This realization prompted a live
ly discussion at departmental Hap
py Hour a couple of weeks ago as we
enumerated all the ways you could
scientifically date yourself with a
tattoo. For example, what if you'd
been an early 20th-century geek
with the plum pudding model of the
atom on your pectoral? Or you'd
pre-dated Copernicus with sketches
of the sun orbiting the Earth?
Biology is a field full of models it
eratively amended or discarded.
The very structure of DNA —so
fundamental to our contemporary
understanding of genetics was
solved just 60 years ago; the evolu
tionary tree of life seems to undergo
dramatic revisions every other day.
Over the weekend, my dad had
shocking news for me about the rel
ative positioning of sponges and
comb jellies. Clearly, he and I share
some genetic predispositions for
nei'diness.
"We really stand on the shoul
ders of giants, don't we?" I said to
Dad. "Evolution makes so much
sense as a framework to build on.
But without Darwin, I'd be floun
dering around trying to fit the
pieces together."
Dad agreed. "Sometimes," he
said, "I remind myself that science
is 'non-sense.' Not of our senses.
Like Galileo's work. The idea of the
Earth orbiting the sun is all back
wards compared to the evidence we
see this small ball that moves
from side to side of our world."
"Yeah," I said, "Sometimes I
don't think I understand it not
really."
"I guess your next tattoo will be
string theory, then," Dad quipped.
I think what Dad and I and so
many scientists love about our
field is that very feeling of stretch
ing beyond the bounds of our own
understanding. We relish the mys
tery, the discovery. We embrace the
risk of being wrong because we
know that our work is inherently a
process of guess-and-check, of revi
sion and re-revision. We record data
and collect facts, but fitting them to
gether into a model of how the world

works is the true challenge.
It's a challenge we must face
with care. In his final lecture to our
graduate biochemistry class at MIT,
Professor Frank Solomon told us
that our greatest task was gaining
the wisdom to know when we were
wrong. How, he asked, would we
know when one scientific model had
to be discarded in favor of another?
Would we have been early adopters
of plate tectonics theory? Would we
have listened to Barbara McClin
tock's evidence for transposable ele
ments?
Science, he reminded us, is not
about ego, not about being right. It's
about collecting evidence, measur
ing uncertainty and keeping the un
known at the front of our minds. Sci
entific discovery, I sometimes think,
is like falling in love. It's simultane
ously exhilarating and terrifying,
and all we crave is more time to try
to figure things out.
But there's never enough time.
We often need to make policy deci
sions with "the best information
available." And no matter how good
that information is, the very process
of science compels us to acknowl
edge that it is incomplete.
So, when we are asked about cli
mate change, ecosystem recovery or
a chemical's health hazards, we an
swer with probabilities and percent
ages. These must not be very satis
fying answers to a Gulf Coast home
owner, a wildlife manager or a wor
ried mother. Especially when advo
cacy groups and lobbyists are eager
to tug on the heartstrings with anec
dotes and slogans.
But they are still the best an
swers.
They are the answers that allow
us to understand, rather than rico
chet aimlessly from one extreme
viewpoint to another. They are the
answers that allow us to quantify,
and to see in shades of gray.
And after all, that's what we hu
mans are good at. From price tags to
relationships to career choices, most
aspects of our lives involve uncer
tainty and analysis. Thus, we're all
capable of being students of science
—of weighing evidence, changing
our minds and making educated de
cisions. And we should take pride in
that, even if it means explaining the
scientific foibles of our latest tattoo.

"We really stand on the shoul
ders of giants, don't we?" I said to
Dad. "Evolution makes so much
sense as a framework to build on.
But without Darwin, I'd be floun
dering around trying to fit the
pieces together."
Dad agreed. "Sometimes," he
said, "I remind myself that science
is 'non-sense.' Not of our senses.
Like Galileo's work. The idea of the
Earth orbiting the sun is all back
wards compared to the evidence we
see this small ball that moves
from side to side of our world."
"Yeah," I said, "Sometimes I
don't think I understand it not
really."
"I guess your next tattoo will be
string theory, then," Dad quipped.
I think what Dad and I and so
many scientists love about our
field is that very feeling of stretch
ing beyond the bounds of our own
understanding. We relish the mys
tery, the discovery. We embrace the
risk of being wrong because we
know that our work is inherently a
process of guess-and-check, of revi
sion and re-revision. We record data
and collect facts, but fitting them to
gether into a model of how the world

works is the true challenge.
It's a challenge we must face
with care. In his final lecture to our
graduate biochemistry class at MIT,
Professor Frank Solomon told us
that our greatest task was gaining
the wisdom to know when we were
wrong. How, he asked, would we
know when one scientific model had
to be discarded in favor of another?
Would we have been early adopters
of plate tectonics theory? Would we
have listened to Barbara McClin
tock's evidence for transposable ele
ments?
Science, he reminded us, is not
about ego, not about being right. It's
about collecting evidence, measur
ing uncertainty and keeping the un
known at the front of our minds. Sci
entific discovery, I sometimes think,
is like falling in love. It's simultane
ously exhilarating and terrifying,
and all we crave is more time to try
to figure things out.
But there's never enough time.
We often need to make policy deci
sions with "the best information
available." And no matter how good
that information is, the very process
of science compels us to acknowl
edge that it is incomplete.
So, when we are asked about cli
mate change, ecosystem recovery or
a chemical's health hazards, we an
swer with probabilities and percent
ages. These must not be very satis
fying answers to a Gulf Coast home
owner, a wildlife manager or a wor
ried mother. Especially when advo
cacy groups and lobbyists are eager
to tug on the heartstrings with anec
dotes and slogans.
But they are still the best an
swers.
They are the answers that allow
us to understand, rather than rico
chet aimlessly from one extreme
viewpoint to another. They are the
answers that allow us to quantify,
and to see in shades of gray.
And after all, that's what we hu
mans are good at. From price tags to
relationships to career choices, most
aspects of our lives involve uncer
tainty and analysis. Thus, we're all
capable of being students of science
—of weighing evidence, changing
our minds and making educated de
cisions. And we should take pride in
that, even if it means explaining the
scientific foibles of our latest tattoo.
