## FROST revival 
### Renjie Wong I STAFF WRITER 
The other day I was speaking
to an old friend who, like
me, comes from out of
state. We had been discussing our
experiences of living in the Bay
Area and came to the (not unex
pected) conclusion that, to the rest
of the nation, San Francisco brings
to mind a blooming image of lib
eral, bohemian, wealthy happiness.
"So, basically, fabulous gays,
upwardly mobile eco-yuppies ...
and really fucking stoned hippies,"
my amigo pondered as we poked
at our organic quinoa-arugula sal
ads and sipped Fair Trade-certified,
aged Earl Grey tea.
And so, as I walked up the dirt
slope to the hallowed grounds of
Frost Amphitheater also known
as Frost Admit Weekend Only
Theatre alongside a gaggle of
barefoot, daisy-chained sorority
girls, it came as no surprise that my
vision started to blur and my mind

began to conjure up hazy, ecstatic
fantasies of Woodstock.
(In hindsight, it was probably
just all that Purple Haze hanging in
the air.)
Never mind that said historic
music festival happened on the
other side of America Stanford's
own Frost Revival certainly felt
like a Californian reincarnation of
the 1969 psychedelic extravaganza.
And why not? The same stu
dent-run music festival that
brought Modest Mouse to the
Farm a year ago took on a decided
ly trippy air this year, replete with
fluttering foil streamers, art instal
lations and amorous, nigh-naked
couples rolling about on their tie
dye picnic blankets.
Fitting enough, then, that the
festival's opening act was named
after the time machine in "Back to
the Future" Delorean's electron
ic synth music certainly recalled

the spanky electric guitar notes of
Joe Cocker and his high-as-sky
performance at Woodstock (albeit
with a contemporary alternative
dance edge). Georgia-based band
Kuroma's, too, daubed their set
with effervescent anthems that
recalled the shimmering music
scene of the '7os that San Francisco
played such a huge role in influ
encing.
If the atmosphere and the
opening acts weren't quite enough
to precipitate a full-blown psyche
delic trip, then surely the festival's
headliner, MGMT, was. The last
stop of their nationwide tour, Frost
Amphitheater witnessed the band
cranking out a spectacularly surreal
set one that involved both new
and familiar pop-psych/liquid
synth/indie-electro beats, alien
LED graphics and a hovercam
casually hanging out in the air
above the audience.

As I picked my way through
the press area, staring up the glori
ous nostrils of lead singer Andrew
VanWyngarden, it suddenly struck
me: For music lovers like us at The
Daily, this was like how Famous
Amos is to Cookie Monster. There
were, in short, more feel-good
vibes than a San Francisco adult
toy store.
Disclaimer: While I would hap
pily argue that Frost Revival was an
altogether brilliant event, my unwa
vering journalistic integrity prompts
me to report that not everyone liked
it. On the way out after the concert
trapped in a crush of starving
people anxious to reach Arrillaga
before it closed I overheard one
overweight, middle-aged woman
saying to another, "For God's sake,
Martha*, why the hell did we come
here?" I figured this was in refer
ence to the fact that MGMT didn't
perform their hit single "Kids," but

then her companion spat back,
"Well, I did tell you that we should
have opened that handle of Jose
Cuervo." Anyway, this in my opin
ion only goes to confirm that old
adage, "Adults are to good taste
what Math 53 is to joy."
I suppose, at the end of the
day, the only question that remains
really is: Did Frost Revival properly
live up to San Francisco's reputa
tion? I think it did, and I'm sure
my old friend would agree, too. As
the crowds twirled along to the
molten synth beats, the amphithe
ater transformed into an electric
field of liberal, bohemian, wealthy
happiness, a spectacle that surely
would have made Janis Joplin &
Co. proud.
And if not, I guess there cer
tainly were a lot of really fucking
stoned hippies.
