## [title of show]: meta and mayhem 
### Katharine Schwab I STAFF WRITER 
The play " [title of show]"
could have been self-refer
ential and self-indulgent. It's
(literally) a musical about two guys
writing a musical about two guys
writing a musical. But despite the
crazy level of self-consciousness
director Weston Gaylord 'l5
described it as an "'lnception'-level
of meta" " [title of show]" man
ages to balance its mind-bending
concept with hilarity, poignancy
and a sincere depiction of friend
ship and artistic struggle.
As the show opens, Hunter
and Jeff, writer and composer, sit
on a minimalistic stage discussing
the possibility of entering the New
York Musical Theater Festival.
Their idea, to write a musical about
themselves writing a musical,
becomes the show that unfolds.
The two recruit Helen and Heidi,
two actress friends, and begin the
process of writing down their lives
in musical form. From a rocky
beginning, when Hunter sings a
song dressed as a mocking sheet of
blank paper, the show culminates
emotionally in a glorious number

where Heidi, played by a magnifi
cent Anneka Kumli 'l3, sings about
her childhood dream to be on
Broadway.
The original show featured
Hunter Bell (the writer), Jeff
Bowen (the composer), Susan
Blackwell and Heidi Blickenstaff, as
well as comically shunned accom
panist Larry Pressgrove, all acting
as themselves. The actors in this
production, quite appropriately,
appear as if they are playing them
selves as well. Jeff (Cody Behan
'l5) and Heidi portray an easy, nat
ural friendship, best represented
when they text each other good
drag queen names. Helen (Katie
Straub 'l4) says what no one else
will say and does so with a biting
wit and an endearing willingness to
go along for the ride. Hunter
(Ph.D. student Buddy Garineer)
and Jeff have a great chemistry and
draw energy from each other with
their precise comedic delivery and
reactions.
As the four characters struggle
through the promise of success and
the bite of failure," [title of

show] s" reflexivity is what ulti
mately makes the show funny,
challenging and thoughtful. The
strongest and wittiest parts occur
when actors acknowledge key
changes, props and difficulties
finding a note. At one point, a
montage song is stopped so that
Susan can find her note on the
piano. Even Larry, the accompa
nist, finally gets permission to
speak when Jeff reassures him that
they worked it out with the union.
The guys take their shirts off and
the girls make out in a self-con
scious effort to appeal to a broader
audience.
"The show creates itself," said
Behan, who is both producing and
acting in " [title of show]." "You
don't have an elaborate set. You

don't have these high production
values. It's bare bones. It just kind
of appears as you are making it. I
knew that working with good
artists would be what brought this
alive."
Songs like "Die, Vampire,
Die!" highlight the show's whimsi
cal quality as well as its decision to
take seriously the doubts and inse
curities that plague the creative
process. As Hunter, Jeff and Heidi
swoop around her in black cloaks
and sing backup, Susan sings about
the different kinds of "vampires"
that take their toll on creativity and
encourages the audience to " pull
your novel out of that sock drawer"
because "you have a story to tell."
For Gaylord," [title of show]"
is so compelling because it places

humor and honesty side by side.
"The show moves from the
outer limits of silliness and campi
ness to what are very tender, real,
genuine moments. There are
moments that really set the meta
aside and say here we go, we're four
people, we are trying to be creative
people in the world and under
stand what that means."
For laughs, irreverence, and a
bout of meta that will make your
head spin, check out "[title of
show]" this weekend in the Elliot
Programming Center. It runs
