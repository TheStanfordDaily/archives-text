# StanShakes brings modem humor to love's labour's lost

When four men take an
oath to give up women
and other pleasures for
studying and fasting for three
years, only hilarity can ensue. So is
the case with the Stanford
Shakespeare Company's
(StanShakes) production of
"Love's Labour's Lost," one of
Shakespeare's earliest comedies.
StanShakes chose to stage it in a
contemporary collegiate setting
at Stanford fraternity Phi Kappa
Psi with modern costumes,
props and music as well, keeping
the audience laughing throughout.
The resolve of Ferdinand, the
King of Navarre, and his three
companions to keep that oath is

immediately tested, as the Princess
of France and her three ladies
arrive at their court. The young
men fall in love, and soon a series

of comical mishaps occur as they
attempt to conceal their feelings
and oath-breaking from each
other.

Setting the show at a college
gave director Camille Brown 'l4
many opportunities for relatable
humor, including making Costard
a ffat boy and having Dumain
(Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4) perform his
ode to Katharine to the tune of
Depeche Mode's "Just Can't Get
Enough," a musical number that
had the audience laughing and
even singing along. This allowed
the show to play up its farcical ele
ments and truly highlight the
humor in Shakespeare's play.
However, at some moments,
there was tension between the origi
nal script and their new take on it
if Maria is referred to as a lady of
France, why does she have a
Southern accent? These questions,
along with a few unclear moments or
metaphors (e.g. writing on peanut
butter and jelly jars and a game with
reindeer antlers and water guns, jokes
that the audience didn't seem to
understand), confused audience
members without necessarily adding
additional humor.
Indeed, the strongest humor
ous moments came from the great
acting and witty text. Will Cox 'l5

as Biron, gave a standout perform
ance that was completely clever,
amusing and believable. Many of
the other characters, especially in
the subplots with Don Adriano,
were fully realized and entertain
ing, interacting in the background
in humorous ways; no actor was a
weak link in the show. However, as
hilarious as they sometimes were,
the humor occasionally distracted
from the main plot. In fact, many
of the subplots were not clearly
tied to the main plot, though this
may be a product of the script
rather than the direction.
The twist at the end of the
show brought with it some more
serious moments. Eleanor Oates
'l4, as the Princess, did a wonder
ful job in bringing believable emo
tion and vulnerability to this final
scene. This was a very nice level
change that would've been wel
come earlier in the play. The farce
was amusing, but a little more
depth earlier on would've given the
audience a chance to truly invest in
the characters and what happened
to them.
Overall, "Love's Labour's Lost"
was an enjoyable and light-hearted
production. There are still three
opportunities to see it: It plays
from May 22 to 26 at 8 p.m. on the
front porch of Stanford Phi Kappa
Psi. Tickets are free and can be
reserved at the StanShakes website,
shakespeare.stanford.edu. Bring
warm clothes and blankets (it gets
incredibly cold) as well as a sense
of humor, for an entertaining addi
tion to your evening.
