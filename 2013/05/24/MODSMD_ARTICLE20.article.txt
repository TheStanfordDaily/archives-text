## The 						Hangover III Vegas isn't fun anymore 
### Alex Bayer I CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Forgive me for sounding
harsh, but "The Hangover
III" is such an awful movie
that I considered whether it even
deserved a review. It almost seems
kind of cruel for me to do, since
what else can this review be but an
indictment of everything wrong
with it... which is, pretty much,
everything? But I know I have a
duty, so I will do my best to convey
to you why you should save your
$lO for a sandwich instead.
The film's first scene involves
the decapitation of a giraffe, I kid
you not, and this yes, this is
the high point of the movie. From
there, it just gets less amusing.
Shortly after the giraffe inci
dent, Alan's (Zach Galifianakis)
father dies. The "Wolfpack"
reunites for his funeral and then
goes on a road-trip to get Alan
treated for mental issues (yes, this
happens). On the way, a drug lord
kidnaps them; apparently, Mr.
Chow (Ken Jeong) has been mak
ing all kinds of trouble, and Alan's
the only one who knows where he
is. The gang has three days to find

him or else Doug (Justin Bartha)
gets it.
This doesn't sound so bad, but
unfortunately, the plot is little more
than a series of stunts. A bigger
budget proves to be a curse: More
sweeping aerial shots and gunfights
means less depth and creativity.
Jokes are delivered as crude one
liners, leaving no room for well
crafted humor.
What about the magic combi
nation of Stu (Ed Helms), Alan and
Phil (Bradley Cooper)? This too, I
am afraid, is a casualty of the lazy
script. Inexplicably, more attention
is paid to the relationship between

Alan and Chow, both of whom
function best as side dishes, not
starring attractions. Alan's transfor
mation is perhaps the most lamen
table: The once lovable weirdo is no
more. In his place is a horribly
insolent narcissist, my dislike of
whom can hardly be put into
words. To give you a sense of how
mean-spirited Alan 3.0 is, the basis
of his budding romance with a
pawnshop dealer is their fondness
for abusing the elderly. Alas, what
the movie lacks is warmth; even in
a franchise that celebrates over-the
top-debauchery, the journey simply
isn't fun without Alan and the rag-

with new ground (and new
homes) and the ensuing
shifting relationship. The
film is smart about the
space that widens between
Frances and Sophie; they
never stop caring about
each other or even knowing
each other fairly well, but
they stop being as necessary

tag trio providing it heart.
I don't know if I've ever left a
movie feeling so deflated. Maybe
this has less to do with the movie
itself and more about accepting the
fact that movies are simply not
made for us anymore; they are pro
duced for a global market. They are
engineered to be as generic as pos
sible so that a kid in Mumbai will
understand it just as much as a
farmhand in Ukraine. (Apparently,
the power of art to make you
understand the world through
someone else's eyes means nothing
anymore.)
The unfortunate and

to each other's existence and
sense of self.
"Frances Ha" is
Baumbach's best film. His
trademark perceptive
insights about paralysis and
the difficulty connecting
with others are still present,
but they are applied to more
easily relatable characters

inevitable truth is that "The
Hangover III" will make money, if
not here, then overseas. No one
will protest (it's just a movie), and
the studios will continue cluttering
American theaters with a two-hour
trailer of explosions, heart-racing
music and quick, panicked cuts, as
if the more frenetic a film is, the
more it holds our attention.
I can't help but feel offended:
For any work of art, even a block
buster, there is an unspoken pact
between creator and artist. I pay to
see your work; you do your best to
deliver. This film doesn't even try. It
does even worse: It exploits an audi
ence that was promised a good
story. As Alan, Stu and Phil hop
from one place to the next in pur
suit of Chow, their exasperation
mirrors our own. When the trio
finally reaches Vegas, it might as
well be a different city. Looking up
at Caesar's Palace, Phil wearily sighs,
"I can't believe we're here again"
but I had the odd sensation that it
was actually Bradley Cooper
imploring the audience to rescue
him from the ashes of cinema.

rather than infuriatingly
oblivious narcissists. Gone,
too, are the navel-gazing pre
tensions of "Squid and the
Whale" and "Kicking and
Screaming." In "Frances Ha,"
Frances and her friends are
still figuring it out, but we
get the sense that eventually
they will.

Alan and Chow, both of whom
function best as side dishes, not
starring attractions. Alan's transfor
mation is perhaps the most lamen
table: The once lovable weirdo is no
more. In his place is a horribly
insolent narcissist, my dislike of
whom can hardly be put into
words. To give you a sense of how
mean-spirited Alan 3.0 is, the basis
of his budding romance with a
pawnshop dealer is their fondness
for abusing the elderly. Alas, what
the movie lacks is warmth; even in
a franchise that celebrates over-the
top-debauchery, the journey simply
isn't fun without Alan and the rag-

I don't know if I've ever left a
movie feeling so deflated. Maybe
this has less to do with the movie
itself and more about accepting the
fact that movies are simply not
made for us anymore; they are pro
duced for a global market. They are
engineered to be as generic as pos
sible so that a kid in Mumbai will
understand it just as much as a
farmhand in Ukraine. (Apparently,
the power of art to make you
understand the world through
someone else's eyes means nothing
anymore.)

"Frances Ha" is
Baumbach's best film. His
trademark perceptive
insights about paralysis and
the difficulty connecting
with others are still present,
but they are applied to more
easily relatable characters

inevitable truth is that "The
Hangover III" will make money, if
not here, then overseas. No one
will protest (it's just a movie), and
the studios will continue cluttering
American theaters with a two-hour
trailer of explosions, heart-racing
music and quick, panicked cuts, as
if the more frenetic a film is, the
more it holds our attention.
I can't help but feel offended:
For any work of art, even a block
buster, there is an unspoken pact
between creator and artist. I pay to
see your work; you do your best to
deliver. This film doesn't even try. It
does even worse: It exploits an audi
ence that was promised a good
story. As Alan, Stu and Phil hop
from one place to the next in pur
suit of Chow, their exasperation
mirrors our own. When the trio
finally reaches Vegas, it might as
well be a different city. Looking up
at Caesar's Palace, Phil wearily sighs,
"I can't believe we're here again"
but I had the odd sensation that it
was actually Bradley Cooper
imploring the audience to rescue
him from the ashes of cinema.

rather than infuriatingly
oblivious narcissists. Gone,
too, are the navel-gazing pre
tensions of "Squid and the
Whale" and "Kicking and
Screaming." In "Frances Ha,"
Frances and her friends are
still figuring it out, but we
get the sense that eventually
they will.
