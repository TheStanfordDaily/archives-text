# FRANCES HA
## Indie film makes Greta Gerwig a star on the big screen 
### Alexandra Heeney | STAFF WRITER 
cc ■ prances Ha" is the
utterly charming,
often hilarious
and surprisingly moving
new film from writer-direc
tor Noah Baumbach. The
effervescent Greta Gerwig,
both as co-writer and per
former, gives the film a
buoyancy missing in
Baumbach's earlier films.
Much like "Easy A," which
made Emma Stone a star,
"Frances Ha" will cement
Gerwig as one; she plays the
immensely likable and intel
ligent, but flawed, title char
acter and is as adept at
pulling off one-liners as she
is conveying vulnerable
emotions.
Shot in black and white,
"Frances Ha" manages to be
nostalgic while remaining
completely contemporary,
iPhones and all. The aesthet
ic is meant to invoke the
look of early Truffaut ("The
400 Blows"), and the film
does have the whimsy of
New Wave films like
Truffaut's "Small Change"
and Godard's "Band of
Outsiders." The film also

shares its humor, its fast
paced witticisms masking
darker emotions and its New
York setting with Woody
Allen's films.
Yet the material has
more in common with the
television series "Girls"
not the sexual antics, but the
story of smart 20-some
things in the difficult post
college years, finding their
way through changing
friendships, relationships
and, in the case of Frances,
frequently changing address
es. By taking this a very spe
cific subculture privi
leged, white, New York hip
sters, which isn't nearly as
awful to see as it sounds
the film finds universal
themes of loneliness, friend
ship and the way people
inevitably grow apart even
when friendships don't com
pletely dissolve.
Frances Halliday
(Gerwig) is a Vassar grad,
living in Brooklyn with her
best friend from college,
Sophie (Mickey Sumner).
She's an apprentice at a
modern dance company

who dreams of being a per
manent member but may be
better suited as a choreogra
pher. When explaining her
job at a party, she has diffi
culty because, she says, "She
doesn't really do it." When
the film begins, she breaks
up with her current
boyfriend, ostensibly and
hilariously though not
actually because she feels
she can't move in with him,
having committed to a lease
with Sophie.
Sophie and Frances
the core relationship of the
film seem tied at the hip,
occasionally referring to
themselves as the same per
son, in an overtly clingy way
that has an inherent expira
tion date. Sophie, like many
of Frances's friends, is more
affluent and more successful
in her career, a frequent
contributor to Frances's
insecurity. When Sophie
decides to move to
Manhattan, which Frances
can't afford, and gets
increasingly engrossed in
her romantic relationship,
Frances is forced to deal
