# Undocumenteds face social, legal barriers
## Students find Stanford experience limited 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Fermin Mendoza 'll had the
idea of going to college instilled in
him throughout his K-12 education
and came to Stanford hoping to
find a place where he could study
engineering and grow individually.
As one of the few undocumented
students at Stanford, however,
Mendoza's experiences on the
Farm proved to be both rare and
more difficult to share with peers.
"I remember freshman year I
was in the mindset that I didn't
know where I was going to be even
the next day," Mendoza recalled. "I
felt that everything that I had and
the life that I was living would
completely change in an instant if I
was removed from the country, if I
was deported."
While Stanford does not offi
cially publicize its acceptance of
undocumented students, Universi

ty spokesperson Lisa Lapin con
firmed that the admissions process
considers such students on a case
by-case basis. Though Stanford re
quires students who are not U.S.
citizens or permanent residents to
maintain the proper visa status for
matriculation, Lapin said that this
requirement is taken into consider
ation when reviewing undocument
ed applicants.
"While the visa requirement is
there, have we had some students
matriculate without it, yes," Lapin
said.
Karen Cooper, director of fi
nancial aid, emphasized that there
are no restrictions on using Uni
versity funds to meet the financial
need of accepted students in
cluding those who are undocu
mented.
"We do provide support to the
undocumented students, and we
hope that they could have as normal
and integrated a student experience
as all of our students," Lapin said.
As Mendoza and other students
who were either undocumented
while at Stanford or had recently
changed their legal status upon ar
rival on campus recall, however, the
undocumented experience strays
far from conventional life on the
Farm in terms of community and
access to opportunities.
Lack of community
Ingrid 'll was born in
Guatemala and brought to East Pa
lo Alto when she was nine years old.
Despite attending a high school
where her undocumented status did
not seem out of place and could be
comfortably discussed, starting col
lege prompted her legal status to
assume a more prominent role.
"Once I got to Stanford, I be
came a little more conscious of it be
cause I kind of felt like I was the on
ly one there who was undocument
ed," she said.
She only opened up to close
friends but even then knew that be
ing undocumented was not some
thing common to campus life.
"I never received any negative
comments or people with negative
attitudes about the issue," Ingrid
said. "It was more so that people
were just surprised and people
couldn't believe that someone who
was undocumented had made it all
the way to Stanford."
According to Ingrid, it felt un
comfortable having to explain what
her legal status was and what it
meant, even when her friends would
sometimes forget.
Mendoza who came to the
United States at the age of four and
whose family overstayed their
tourist visas only felt comfort
able opening up to others about his
status until he started realizing the
misconceptions peers held.
For instance, he recalled a dorm
mate once joking that he could get
away with killing undocumented im
migrants because the government
technically didn't recognize them as
people.
"I started realizing there were a
lot of misconceptions, and I felt like
my voice wasn't being heard and I
wasn't speaking out about my expe
riences and my frustrations," Men
doza said.
Though Mendoza was never mis
treated once he opened up about his
undocumented status, he still felt
that the greater Stanford communi
ty could not properly understand
his frustration and concerns, creat
ing a sense of alienation that would
take a toll on his mental health and
academic performance.
Mendoza ultimately found away
of embracing and sharing his identi
ty as an undocumented by integrat
ing himself into the queer communi
ty-
"l felt that the queer community
on campus had really similar experi

ences that I did as an undocument
ed person who was vilified in the
media," Mendoza said. "Coming out
is also something I had to do as an
undocumented person."
Leonardo 'l5 also related a sense
of alienation and lack of community.
Having entered the United States
in 2005 and subsequently facing ex
treme familial circumstances, he
was a ward of the state undergoing
proceedings to obtain legal residen
cy at the time of his application.
By the start of his freshman
year, Leonardo's legal status had
changed, but he still felt uncomfort
able opening up about his experi
ences living undocumented in the
United States.
"I felt that if I did, I would feel
isolated or that people would not un
derstand," Leonardo said. "You
don't want to feel like you're a
stranger or that you stand out for
something that might be detrimen
tal to your social interaction."
Limited opportunities
Stanford's undocumented stu
dents are also constrained by a rela
tive inability to take advantage of
career development opportunities.
Ingrid and Mendoza recently
qualified for deferred action status
under President Barack Obama's
Deferred Action for Childhood Ar
rivals (DACA) program, which
grants them an Employment Au
thorization Document valid for two
years and eligible for renewal.
Though they can both now find
their desired work in technical fields
after studying engineering at Stan
ford, they remain disadvantaged
compared to peers able to accumu
late work or internship experience
during their undergraduate career.
"Because I've been undocument
ed for so many years, I don't have
the kind of experience that employ
ers are looking for," Ingrid said.
"Now I have a work permit, so I'm
trying to find a job where an em
ployer is understanding of the expe
rience that I've had."
Ingrid had been accepted to a
pre-business program after the re
cruiters had explained she was eligi
ble. After they requested a social se
curity number, however, she was
told it was a misunderstanding,
waitlisted and rejected.
"It's really frustrating that you
already know where all these things
are offered but you can't really take
advantage of them," Ingrid said.
Ingrid noted that friends and or
ganizations like El Centro Chicano
tried to help her find opportunities
but were hindered by a lack of
knowledge.
"A lot of people don't know how
to go around things or if there is a
fair way that things can be run to
make exceptions," Ingrid said. "It
wasn't because people were ill-in
tended, it was just because people
didn't know how."
Fermin, on the other hand, man
aged to secure a stipend with the so
ciology department and a fellowship
with the Haas Center for Public
Service, but only after researching
what positions he could access.
When asked about what intern
ships or counseling resources are

available for undocumented stu
dents— even those with deferred
action status at the Career De
velopment Center (CDC), Lance
Choy, former director of the CDC,
said that those students are re
ferred to the Bechtel International
Center or lawyers with the appro
priate background.
"You have Stanford as an institu
tion that tells you, 'You can do what
ever you want here are the re
sources,"' Mendoza said. "But when
you're an undocumented person at
Stanford, when you're an undocu
mented person at any institution,
you can't do all those things."
Seeking action
Undocumented students and
alumni called on administrators to
better publicize the admissions
process for undocumented students
in order to create a larger community.
Fermin, who was informed about
applying to Stanford through a col
lege counselor at a prestigious char
ter school, noted that the lack of of
ficial disclosure about Stanford's ac
ceptance of undocumented students
could be detrimental.
"[Undocumented students] may
have all the credentials, talent and
curiosity and all the things Stanford
looks for in its students but they
may not have the guidance that I
did from my college counselor," he
said. "They may just be afraid to ap
ply— they may not know about
this."
Lapin said that Stanford is open
to inquiries about accepting undocu
mented students, a stance partially
necessitated by logistical reasons.
"It would be challenging for us to
do that when things are constantly
in flux," Lapin said.
She added that the University's
stance on immigration reform indi
cates an accepting campus environ
ment.
"President Hennessy has been
very outspoken in favor of the
DREAM Act and believes very
strongly that if we educate people
they should be able to live and work
here," Lapin said.
While Mendoza and Ingrid cred
ited their academic enrichment and
networking while at Stanford as
worthwhile in entering the job mar
ket, they called for a more openly
welcoming University approach.
"If Stanford has already sup
ported some of us, it only makes
sense that they be open about it,"
Ingrid said.

proceedings to obtain legal residen
cy at the time of his application.
By the start of his freshman
year, Leonardo's legal status had
changed, but he still felt uncomfort
able opening up about his experi
ences living undocumented in the
United States.
"I felt that if I did, I would feel
isolated or that people would not un
derstand," Leonardo said. "You
don't want to feel like you're a
stranger or that you stand out for
something that might be detrimen
tal to your social interaction."
Limited opportunities
Stanford's undocumented stu
dents are also constrained by a rela
tive inability to take advantage of
career development opportunities.
Ingrid and Mendoza recently
qualified for deferred action status
under President Barack Obama's
Deferred Action for Childhood Ar
rivals (DACA) program, which
grants them an Employment Au
thorization Document valid for two
years and eligible for renewal.
Though they can both now find
their desired work in technical fields
after studying engineering at Stan
ford, they remain disadvantaged
compared to peers able to accumu
late work or internship experience
during their undergraduate career.
"Because I've been undocument
ed for so many years, I don't have
the kind of experience that employ
ers are looking for," Ingrid said.
"Now I have a work permit, so I'm
trying to find a job where an em
ployer is understanding of the expe
rience that I've had."
Ingrid had been accepted to a
pre-business program after the re
cruiters had explained she was eligi
ble. After they requested a social se
curity number, however, she was
told it was a misunderstanding,
waitlisted and rejected.
"It's really frustrating that you
already know where all these things
are offered but you can't really take
advantage of them," Ingrid said.
Ingrid noted that friends and or
ganizations like El Centro Chicano
tried to help her find opportunities
but were hindered by a lack of
knowledge.
"A lot of people don't know how
to go around things or if there is a
fair way that things can be run to
make exceptions," Ingrid said. "It
wasn't because people were ill-in
tended, it was just because people
didn't know how."
Fermin, on the other hand, man
aged to secure a stipend with the so
ciology department and a fellowship
with the Haas Center for Public
Service, but only after researching
what positions he could access.
When asked about what intern
ships or counseling resources are

available for undocumented stu
dents— even those with deferred
action status at the Career De
velopment Center (CDC), Lance
Choy, former director of the CDC,
said that those students are re
ferred to the Bechtel International
Center or lawyers with the appro
priate background.
"You have Stanford as an institu
tion that tells you, 'You can do what
ever you want here are the re
sources,"' Mendoza said. "But when
you're an undocumented person at
Stanford, when you're an undocu
mented person at any institution,
you can't do all those things."
Seeking action
Undocumented students and
alumni called on administrators to
better publicize the admissions
process for undocumented students
in order to create a larger community.
Fermin, who was informed about
applying to Stanford through a col
lege counselor at a prestigious char
ter school, noted that the lack of of
ficial disclosure about Stanford's ac
ceptance of undocumented students
could be detrimental.
"[Undocumented students] may
have all the credentials, talent and
curiosity and all the things Stanford
looks for in its students but they
may not have the guidance that I
did from my college counselor," he
said. "They may just be afraid to ap
ply— they may not know about
this."
Lapin said that Stanford is open
to inquiries about accepting undocu
mented students, a stance partially
necessitated by logistical reasons.
"It would be challenging for us to
do that when things are constantly
in flux," Lapin said.
She added that the University's
stance on immigration reform indi
cates an accepting campus environ
ment.
"President Hennessy has been
very outspoken in favor of the
DREAM Act and believes very
strongly that if we educate people
they should be able to live and work
here," Lapin said.
While Mendoza and Ingrid cred
ited their academic enrichment and
networking while at Stanford as
worthwhile in entering the job mar
ket, they called for a more openly
welcoming University approach.
"If Stanford has already sup
ported some of us, it only makes
sense that they be open about it,"
Ingrid said.

Fermin Mendoza 'll had the
idea of going to college instilled in
him throughout his K-12 education
and came to Stanford hoping to
find a place where he could study
engineering and grow individually.
As one of the few undocumented
students at Stanford, however,
Mendoza's experiences on the
Farm proved to be both rare and
more difficult to share with peers.
"I remember freshman year I
was in the mindset that I didn't
know where I was going to be even
the next day," Mendoza recalled. "I
felt that everything that I had and
the life that I was living would
completely change in an instant if I
was removed from the country, if I
was deported."
While Stanford does not offi
cially publicize its acceptance of
undocumented students, Universi

ty spokesperson Lisa Lapin con
firmed that the admissions process
considers such students on a case
by-case basis. Though Stanford re
quires students who are not U.S.
citizens or permanent residents to
maintain the proper visa status for
matriculation, Lapin said that this
requirement is taken into consider
ation when reviewing undocument
ed applicants.
"While the visa requirement is
there, have we had some students
matriculate without it, yes," Lapin
said.
Karen Cooper, director of fi
nancial aid, emphasized that there
are no restrictions on using Uni
versity funds to meet the financial
need of accepted students in
cluding those who are undocu
mented.
"We do provide support to the
undocumented students, and we
hope that they could have as normal
and integrated a student experience
as all of our students," Lapin said.
As Mendoza and other students
who were either undocumented
while at Stanford or had recently
changed their legal status upon ar
rival on campus recall, however, the
undocumented experience strays
far from conventional life on the
Farm in terms of community and
access to opportunities.
Lack of community
Ingrid 'll was born in
Guatemala and brought to East Pa
lo Alto when she was nine years old.
Despite attending a high school
where her undocumented status did
not seem out of place and could be
comfortably discussed, starting col
lege prompted her legal status to
assume a more prominent role.
"Once I got to Stanford, I be
came a little more conscious of it be
cause I kind of felt like I was the on
ly one there who was undocument
ed," she said.
She only opened up to close
friends but even then knew that be
ing undocumented was not some
thing common to campus life.
"I never received any negative
comments or people with negative
attitudes about the issue," Ingrid
said. "It was more so that people
were just surprised and people
couldn't believe that someone who
was undocumented had made it all
the way to Stanford."
According to Ingrid, it felt un
comfortable having to explain what
her legal status was and what it
meant, even when her friends would
sometimes forget.
Mendoza who came to the
United States at the age of four and
whose family overstayed their
tourist visas only felt comfort
able opening up to others about his
status until he started realizing the
misconceptions peers held.
For instance, he recalled a dorm
mate once joking that he could get
away with killing undocumented im
migrants because the government
technically didn't recognize them as
people.
"I started realizing there were a
lot of misconceptions, and I felt like
my voice wasn't being heard and I
wasn't speaking out about my expe
riences and my frustrations," Men
doza said.
Though Mendoza was never mis
treated once he opened up about his
undocumented status, he still felt
that the greater Stanford communi
ty could not properly understand
his frustration and concerns, creat
ing a sense of alienation that would
take a toll on his mental health and
academic performance.
Mendoza ultimately found away
of embracing and sharing his identi
ty as an undocumented by integrat
ing himself into the queer communi
ty-
"l felt that the queer community
on campus had really similar experi

ences that I did as an undocument
ed person who was vilified in the
media," Mendoza said. "Coming out
is also something I had to do as an
undocumented person."
Leonardo 'l5 also related a sense
of alienation and lack of community.
Having entered the United States
in 2005 and subsequently facing ex
treme familial circumstances, he
was a ward of the state undergoing
proceedings to obtain legal residen
cy at the time of his application.
By the start of his freshman
year, Leonardo's legal status had
