## Summer hard alcohol ban lifted University reinstates normal alcohol policy after feedback 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
In a reversal of last year's experimen
tal and unpopular policy, hard alcohol will
not be banned from campus during the
2013 summer session.
"It's going to be the same alcohol poli
cy that's enforced during the regular
year," said Jess Matthews, senior associ
ate dean of summer session.
During summer quarter last year, stu
dents including those older than 21
were told that any alcoholic beverage
with an alcohol content of 20 percent or
greater would not be tolerated in dorms.
This stance was implemented despite
the regular Stanford University Student
Alcohol Policy, which states that "the Uni
versity is especially concerned about the
misuse of distilled alcohol products ('hard
alcohol')" but does not explicitly prohibit
hard liquor.
Matthews said that conversations with
the campus community led to the decision
to discontinue last summer's pilot pro
gram.
"I really listen to feedback from my
staff, from our students, from the Stan
ford community," Matthews said. "We
just decided that there were other ways
that we could address the issue."
Matthews said while some students
believed the policy created a better aca
demic environment, others were con
cerned about hindered communication
during potentially dangerous situations in
light of a policy that posited consequences
for the possession of hard liquor.
"[Now], my hope is that students will
feel okay reaching out to their staff if they
are struggling, if their friends are strug
gling," Matthews said. "If there's a seri
ous incident, my hope is that they feel re
ally comfortable reaching out and getting
the support that they need."
Ralph Castro, director of the Office of
Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE),
said that enforcing the same standards
throughout the year supports the admin
istration's goals.
"Consistency and clarity are big
things when we talk about policy," Castro
said. "I think having the same policy in
the summer is good for clarity and consis
tency throughout the year, particularly
for Stanford students but also for the vis
iting students as well."
Castro noted that high school and vis
iting students live on campus alongside
Stanford students over the summer, cre
ating one reason for last year's ban.
"We try to be a lot more vigilant about
parties with alcohol and make sure that
they're not inviting high school people
