# Q&A JONATHAN MAYER
## 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jonathan Mayer, a graduate
student in law and computer sci
ence, has attracted worldwide me
dia attention for his investigations
into online privacy policies. His
discovery that the Romney and
Obama presidential campaign
websites were leaking visitor in
formation to third-party trackers
was featured in a New York Times
article, and he has served as a
consultant to law enforcement.
The Daily sat down with Mayer to
discuss his recent work, which in
cludes a patch that will be imple
mented in the latest Mozilla Fire
fox web browser, and his ideas for
improving Internet security.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
and when did you become inter
ested in Internet security?
Jonathan Mayer (JM): The
first time I realized that it was go
ing to be a potential career was
[as an] undergrad when I took a
class in information security... I

liked that very slight bit of sub
versiveness that the field has to it.
It's an academic field that is in
many ways quite applied, in many
ways very much [about] interact
ing with companies and govern
ment ... I liked that a lot.
TSD: What brought you to Stan
ford, and why did you decide to
focus on law and computer sci
ence?
JM: When I was looking at
grad programs, I knew I wanted
to do law and computer science...
I wound up, in my visit, enjoying
Stanford computer science the
most and enjoying Stanford law
the most, so that made it pretty
easy. The hard part was the
"choose-your-own-adventure"
component of building this pro
gram ... My understanding was
that there was a little bit of ad
ministrative scrambling before I
showed up on campus, about,
"Wait a minute, have we made a
tragic mistake? This guy is sup
posed to be at the Law School.
This guy is supposed to be at the

Computer Science Department.
What do we do?" Stanford, very
admirably, figured out what it
needed to figure out and has been
an awesome place ever since.
TSD: You've been featured in
the media for your discoveries
about how companies track
their users on the web what
were your most well-known

findings?
JM: One was some research I
did maybe a year and a half ago
into Safari's cookie-blocking fea
ture and some companies that are
intentionally circumventing that
feature, with varying rationales
for doing it and varying conse
quences. One of the companies

that was circumventing the feature
was Google. That research con
tributed to a federal regulatory ac
tion, resulting in a billing fine of
$22.5 million.
The Firefox cookie-blocking
feature I was working on certainly
got quite a bit of media attention
I think it's one of the most mean
ingful things that I worked on. The
feature initially was very quiet, and
that was fine with me... It was only
when it finally landed in a pre-re
leased version of Firefox when the
media attention picked up... There
were some very entertaining reac
tions from some folks. Someone
called it [a] "nuclear first strike."
I spent some amount of time
collaborating with the California
Department of Justice on an initia
tive to facilitate putting privacy
policies in mobile applications.

That's an initiative that I think all
of the major mobile app platforms
have now signed on to. I think it
was a really great success with reg
ulatory agencies doing things on
the cutting edge, where historically
speaking, regulatory agencies have
had a tough time... I don't think I
would have had that opportunity
had I not been at Stanford.
TSD: How have you been work
ing with Mozilla to integrate
your technology into its new
browser, and when did they be
come interested in your technol
ogy?
JM: Security and privacy space
is not that big. It's a little bit of an
"everyone-knows-everyone" com
munity after you have been around
for a while... I and some others
have, over the course of the past
year, kicked around some ideas
with Mozilla about some technical
countermeasures that Mozilla Fire
fox can include. One of those direc
tions was revising the cookie policy.
It's looking good, but we want to

be sure, be rigorous ... as we add
more things for example, what
about sites that users only visit
once and never come back to? The
policy doesn't have any special pro
visions for that. What about old
cookies? So if you have an older
version of Firefox and update to
this policy and you have tracking
history [from] before, what are we
going to do about that? That's sort
of a flavor of the sort of things that
we're going to think through.
TSD: What do you think is the
most important thing that Inter
net users should do to protect
their privacy?
JM: I wish there was an easy
answer. That's one of the reasons
why I think working on the Firefox
cookie policy has been one of the
most meaningful projects I have
worked on â€”it puts privacy in
hands of users. Firefox has some
thing like 400 million-plus users. By
default, those users are going to get
this new privacy feature. There is
an enormous body of research on
how existing privacy tools and secu
rity tools are really hard to use and
consumers and enterprises really
don't understand them. If you do
understand them, they are really
hard to get configured and kept up
to date. That's one of the reasons I
was working on this Firefox feature
and working to make that exist.
