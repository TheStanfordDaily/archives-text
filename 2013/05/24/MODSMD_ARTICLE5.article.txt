# Q&A JONATHAN MAYER
## 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jonathan Mayer, a graduate
student in law and computer sci
ence, has attracted worldwide me
dia attention for his investigations
into online privacy policies. His
discovery that the Romney and
Obama presidential campaign
websites were leaking visitor in
formation to third-party trackers
was featured in a New York Times
article, and he has served as a
consultant to law enforcement.
The Daily sat down with Mayer to
discuss his recent work, which in
cludes a patch that will be imple
mented in the latest Mozilla Fire
fox web browser, and his ideas for
improving Internet security.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
and when did you become inter
ested in Internet security?
Jonathan Mayer (JM): The
first time I realized that it was go
ing to be a potential career was
[as an] undergrad when I took a
class in information security... I

liked that very slight bit of sub
versiveness that the field has to it.
It's an academic field that is in
many ways quite applied, in many
ways very much [about] interact
ing with companies and govern
ment ... I liked that a lot.
TSD: What brought you to Stan
ford, and why did you decide to
focus on law and computer sci
ence?
JM: When I was looking at
grad programs, I knew I wanted
to do law and computer science...
I wound up, in my visit, enjoying
Stanford computer science the
most and enjoying Stanford law
the most, so that made it pretty
easy. The hard part was the
"choose-your-own-adventure"
component of building this pro
gram ... My understanding was
that there was a little bit of ad
ministrative scrambling before I
showed up on campus, about,
"Wait a minute, have we made a
tragic mistake? This guy is sup
posed to be at the Law School.
This guy is supposed to be at the

Computer Science Department.
What do we do?" Stanford, very
admirably, figured out what it
needed to figure out and has been
an awesome place ever since.
TSD: You've been featured in
the media for your discoveries
about how companies track
their users on the web what
were your most well-known

findings?
JM: One was some research I
did maybe a year and a half ago
into Safari's cookie-blocking fea
ture and some companies that are
intentionally circumventing that
feature, with varying rationales
for doing it and varying conse
quences. One of the companies
