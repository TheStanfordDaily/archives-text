## Club locross reaches New heights 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
In 2013, the Stanford men's
lacrosse team celebrated the
program's 50th anniversary
and they did it in style, putting
together the team's most suc
cessful campaign in over 30 years.
According to head coach Drew
Virk, before this year, the program
had not won the Western Collegiate
Lacrosse League (WCLL) champi
onship for 31 years and had not qual
ified for the Men's Collegiate
Lacrosse Association (MCLA) Na
tional Tournament in 12. In 2013, the
squad accomplished both.
Players and coaches said that the
team was able to reach new heights
after making a stronger dedication
to the program, particularly in the
fall before the season began.
"We trained for [success]," Virk
said. "We definitely worked harder

in the offseason than we had in pre
vious years, and guys were commit
ted to being this successful."
Senior Jack Farr, a co-captain of
the team along with fellow seniors
Malcolm McGregor, Sean O'Brien
and Nolan Pura, said that the team
atmosphere was very laidback when
he arrived as a freshman four years
ago, but his class wanted to change
the culture. According to Farr, who
was named an MCLA All-American
and WCLL Offensive Player of the
Year, this year's captains laid out
three goals: beat Cal in Big Game,
win the league and go to the national
championship tournament.
"We sat down and figured out
what we needed to do to accomplish
those goals," Farr said. "The first
thing we came up with was we had to
set a tone that was more intense and
more serious than it had ever been in
the past."
Throughout the fall, the team fol
lowed a structured workout regimen

led by former U.S. Army officer Ma
jor Chris Green, which Fan* said ul
timately gave the team the boost it
needed throughout the season. At
the beginning of winter quarter, the
team began practicing every day for
about two hours, with games on the
weekend.
Despite the increase in offseason
training, the team wasn't sure about
how it would translate into real re
sults during the WCLL season. But
after several big early-season wins,
particularly over Oregon and UC-
Santa Barbara, the coaches and cap
tains said momentum began to build
and success became expected.
"We had a few early wins against
teams that we ranked higher than
us," Farr said. "I think it was at that
point that we realized, wow, we real
ly have something special here."
A few late-season losses threat
ened to knock Stanford off course,
but the Cardinal rallied in the play
offs to take down rival Cal and Sono

ma State in two tight games to take
the WCLL title for the first time
since 1982. The team then advanced
to the national championship, where
it fell in the first round to Michigan
State.
Freshman Hunter Irvin credited
the class of 2013 for raising the stan
dards by "leaps and bounds" but said
that the team is still positioned for
future success, noting that the roster
currently has 14 sophomores.
"Going forward, we're losing a
really talented group." Irvin said.
"But the work ethic they've taught
us and the standard that they've set
is going to continue when they're not
there."
Virk also said that the team ex
pects to get seven or eight new
freshmen to fill the spots. Since
men's lacrosse is a club sport at
Stanford, Virk's recruiting process is
very different than for a varsity

team. Virk has no sway with the ad
missions department and does not
offer scholarships in fact, players
pay $l,OOO in dues each year.
Despite this unique recruiting
process, Virk said that about five
players interested in playing
lacrosse at Stanford contact him
each day. From that point on, Virk
works with applicants to make sure
they have the best application possi
ble and then waits to see who the ad
missions department accepts. Once
potential players receive their ac
ceptance letters, then Virk and the
team begin trying to convince play
ers to come to Stanford and play
lacrosse.
Co-captain senior Sean O'Brien
said that Big Game which alter
nates location annually between Palo
Alto and Berkeley is a major sell
ing point. O'Brien said that when
Stanford hosts the Bay Area show
down, they usually schedule the
game for Admit Weekend to attract
potential recruits.
Virk said that by playing at club

level at Stanford, players can get a
more "well-rounded college experi
ence," in which they have the oppor
tunity to pursue top-notch academics
and athletics but also have an active
social life and join other organiza
tions.
O'Brien said that like many of
the players on the team he wasn't
planning to play lacrosse after high
school. But after trying out the club
team, he ended up loving the experi
ence, which he credited to the other
guys on the team.
"It's really meant finding my best
friends and having a really great
time being an athlete," O'Brien said.
"A lot of times, people have their
teammates and then they have their
group of Mends, but for us, those
two are the same."
The club team's success this year,
combined with lacrosse's increasing
popularity on the West Coast, has in
creased rumblings about the viabili
ty of a Stanford Division I men's
lacrosse team.
"There are mixed feelings on
that," Virk said. "The alumni loved
their experience in a club program
and want to continue that, but I think
the demand from the kids coming up
[is that] they're looking for more of
that varsity DI commitment."

Rig'ht now, funding and location
make the prospect unlikely in the
near future. The addition of a men's
lacrosse program would likely neces
sitate the creation of additional
women's scholarships to keep the
athletic department in compliance
with Title IX.
Any West Coast team would also
face a significant travel schedule, as
there is currently only one Division I
men's lacrosse program west of the
Mississippi, the University of Denver.
"If you get schools like UCLA,
USC and one or two other ones on
the West Coast that all get pro
grams, that would be a really cool
thing," O'Brien said, adding that the
club team would likely benefit from
players who decided to drop off the
varsity team.
Even as a club team, Stanford
plans to continue its success into the
program's 51st season and beyond.
"[2013] set a new bar... it's let the
program know that [success] is there
if we want it," Virk said. "I think that
everyone will be pretty disappointed
if guys aren't willing to train even
harder than this year to be as suc
cessful as last season."

team. Virk has no sway with the ad
missions department and does not
offer scholarships in fact, players
pay $l,OOO in dues each year.
Despite this unique recruiting
process, Virk said that about five
players interested in playing
lacrosse at Stanford contact him
each day. From that point on, Virk
works with applicants to make sure
they have the best application possi
ble and then waits to see who the ad
missions department accepts. Once
potential players receive their ac
ceptance letters, then Virk and the
team begin trying to convince play
ers to come to Stanford and play
lacrosse.
Co-captain senior Sean O'Brien
said that Big Game which alter

Alto and Berkeley is a major sell

Stanford hosts the Bay Area show
down, they usually schedule the

potential recruits.
Virk said that by playing at club

level at Stanford, players can get a
more "well-rounded college experi
ence," in which they have the oppor
tunity to pursue top-notch academics
and athletics but also have an active
social life and join other organiza
tions.
O'Brien said that like many of
the players on the team he wasn't
planning to play lacrosse after high
school. But after trying out the club
team, he ended up loving the experi
ence, which he credited to the other
guys on the team.
"It's really meant finding my best
friends and having a really great
time being an athlete," O'Brien said.
"A lot of times, people have their
teammates and then they have their
group of Mends, but for us, those
two are the same."
The club team's success this year,
combined with lacrosse's increasing
popularity on the West Coast, has in
creased rumblings about the viabili
ty of a Stanford Division I men's
lacrosse team.
"There are mixed feelings on
that," Virk said. "The alumni loved
their experience in a club program
and want to continue that, but I think
the demand from the kids coming up
[is that] they're looking for more of
that varsity DI commitment."

Rig'ht now, funding and location
make the prospect unlikely in the
near future. The addition of a men's
lacrosse program would likely neces
sitate the creation of additional
women's scholarships to keep the
athletic department in compliance
with Title IX.
Any West Coast team would also
face a significant travel schedule, as
there is currently only one Division I
men's lacrosse program west of the
Mississippi, the University of Denver.
"If you get schools like UCLA,
USC and one or two other ones on
the West Coast that all get pro
grams, that would be a really cool
thing," O'Brien said, adding that the
club team would likely benefit from
players who decided to drop off the
varsity team.
Even as a club team, Stanford
plans to continue its success into the
program's 51st season and beyond.
"[2013] set a new bar... it's let the
program know that [success] is there
if we want it," Virk said. "I think that
everyone will be pretty disappointed
if guys aren't willing to train even
harder than this year to be as suc
cessful as last season."

In 2013, the Stanford men's
lacrosse team celebrated the
program's 50th anniversary
and they did it in style, putting
together the team's most suc
cessful campaign in over 30 years.
According to head coach Drew
Virk, before this year, the program
had not won the Western Collegiate
Lacrosse League (WCLL) champi
onship for 31 years and had not qual
ified for the Men's Collegiate
Lacrosse Association (MCLA) Na
tional Tournament in 12. In 2013, the
squad accomplished both.
Players and coaches said that the
team was able to reach new heights
after making a stronger dedication
to the program, particularly in the
fall before the season began.
"We trained for [success]," Virk
said. "We definitely worked harder

in the offseason than we had in pre
vious years, and guys were commit
ted to being this successful."
Senior Jack Farr, a co-captain of
the team along with fellow seniors
Malcolm McGregor, Sean O'Brien
and Nolan Pura, said that the team
atmosphere was very laidback when
he arrived as a freshman four years
ago, but his class wanted to change
the culture. According to Farr, who
was named an MCLA All-American
and WCLL Offensive Player of the
Year, this year's captains laid out
three goals: beat Cal in Big Game,
win the league and go to the national
championship tournament.
"We sat down and figured out
what we needed to do to accomplish
those goals," Farr said. "The first
thing we came up with was we had to
set a tone that was more intense and
more serious than it had ever been in
the past."
Throughout the fall, the team fol
lowed a structured workout regimen

led by former U.S. Army officer Ma
jor Chris Green, which Fan* said ul
timately gave the team the boost it
needed throughout the season. At
the beginning of winter quarter, the
team began practicing every day for
about two hours, with games on the
weekend.
Despite the increase in offseason
training, the team wasn't sure about
how it would translate into real re
sults during the WCLL season. But
after several big early-season wins,
particularly over Oregon and UC-
Santa Barbara, the coaches and cap
tains said momentum began to build
and success became expected.
"We had a few early wins against
teams that we ranked higher than
us," Farr said. "I think it was at that
point that we realized, wow, we real
ly have something special here."
A few late-season losses threat
ened to knock Stanford off course,
but the Cardinal rallied in the play

the WCLL title for the first time
