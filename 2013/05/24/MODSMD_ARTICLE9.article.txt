## Club locross reaches New heights 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
In 2013, the Stanford men's
lacrosse team celebrated the
program's 50th anniversary
and they did it in style, putting
together the team's most suc
cessful campaign in over 30 years.
According to head coach Drew
Virk, before this year, the program
had not won the Western Collegiate
Lacrosse League (WCLL) champi
onship for 31 years and had not qual
ified for the Men's Collegiate
Lacrosse Association (MCLA) Na
tional Tournament in 12. In 2013, the
squad accomplished both.
Players and coaches said that the
team was able to reach new heights
after making a stronger dedication
to the program, particularly in the
fall before the season began.
"We trained for [success]," Virk
said. "We definitely worked harder

in the offseason than we had in pre
vious years, and guys were commit
ted to being this successful."
Senior Jack Farr, a co-captain of
the team along with fellow seniors
Malcolm McGregor, Sean O'Brien
and Nolan Pura, said that the team
atmosphere was very laidback when
he arrived as a freshman four years
ago, but his class wanted to change
the culture. According to Farr, who
was named an MCLA All-American
and WCLL Offensive Player of the
Year, this year's captains laid out
three goals: beat Cal in Big Game,
win the league and go to the national
championship tournament.
"We sat down and figured out
what we needed to do to accomplish
those goals," Farr said. "The first
thing we came up with was we had to
set a tone that was more intense and
more serious than it had ever been in
the past."
Throughout the fall, the team fol
lowed a structured workout regimen

led by former U.S. Army officer Ma
jor Chris Green, which Fan* said ul
timately gave the team the boost it
needed throughout the season. At
the beginning of winter quarter, the
team began practicing every day for
about two hours, with games on the
weekend.
Despite the increase in offseason
training, the team wasn't sure about
how it would translate into real re
sults during the WCLL season. But
after several big early-season wins,
particularly over Oregon and UC-
Santa Barbara, the coaches and cap
tains said momentum began to build
and success became expected.
"We had a few early wins against
teams that we ranked higher than
us," Farr said. "I think it was at that
point that we realized, wow, we real
ly have something special here."
A few late-season losses threat
ened to knock Stanford off course,
but the Cardinal rallied in the play
offs to take down rival Cal and Sono

ma State in two tight games to take
the WCLL title for the first time
since 1982. The team then advanced
to the national championship, where
it fell in the first round to Michigan
State.
Freshman Hunter Irvin credited
the class of 2013 for raising the stan
dards by "leaps and bounds" but said
that the team is still positioned for
future success, noting that the roster
currently has 14 sophomores.
"Going forward, we're losing a
really talented group." Irvin said.
"But the work ethic they've taught
us and the standard that they've set
is going to continue when they're not
there."
Virk also said that the team ex
pects to get seven or eight new
freshmen to fill the spots. Since
men's lacrosse is a club sport at
Stanford, Virk's recruiting process is
very different than for a varsity
