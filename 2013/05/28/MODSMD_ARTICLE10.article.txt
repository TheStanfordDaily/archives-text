## Card misses out on tournament bid 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford (32-22, 16-14 Pac-12) continued to
fight in its late-season resurgence, taking the
first two games of its final regular-season se
ries against No. 11 UCLA (39-17,21-9 Pac-12).
But after Sunday's loss, Stanford was not given
a bid to the NCAA Tournament, while the Bru
ins will be one of the 16 teams to host an NCAA
Regional.

On Friday night, senior starting pitcher Mark
Appel became the Stanford career strikeout leader
with his 364 th strikeout on a check swing on the
first batter of the game.
In his last start at Sunken Diamond, Appel
had a brilliant performance. With Theo Epstein,
the Chicago Cubs' President of Baseball Opera
tions, sitting a few rows behind home plate to
scout him, Appel picked up nine strikeouts while
allowing only one run on three hits in eight in
nings.
But even with Appel's strong outing on the
mound, the victory was far from secure. UCLA
starting pitcher Adam Plutko went blow for blow
with Appel, keeping Stanford off the board
through five innings.
The Cardinal offense came alive in the sixth
with a bloop double down the left field line by
senior designated hitter Justin Ringo, an RBI
triple by sophomore rightfielder Austin Slater
after Slater failed on a bunt attempt and a sacri
fice fly from junior first baseman Brian Ragira.
Just like that, Stanford had a 2-1 lead.
That would be all the support Appel would
need. Senior relief pitcher Garrett Hughes came
on to secure the save, sending the Bruins down
in order with two strikeouts and a fly out to start
senior weekend off with a key 2-1 victory.
"It's been a great career here," Hughes said.
"I love this place. It's got a lot of sentimental val
ue to me. To be able to come out here Friday night
and finish it off, it was a really special feeling."
On Saturday, it was a freshman, not a senior,
who came up big on the mound for the Cardinal.
After sophomore starting pitcher John
Hochstatter left the game trailing 2-1 with two

runners on base
and no one out in
the fifth inning,
freshman relief
pitcher Logan
James shut the
Bruins down.

James allowed only one inherited run to
score on two consecutive groundouts before re
tiring the side in the fifth. James stayed on the
mound into the ninth inning, going 4.2 innings
while allowing no runs on three walks and only
one hit to earn the victory.
An error and a walk in the ninth inning
stopped James from completing the game, as
junior reliever Sam Lindquist came on with two
outs in the ninth and struck out the only batter
he faced for the save.
While James kept UCLA at bay, Stanford's
bats rallied in the fifth through seventh innings
to score six runs and secure a 7-3 victory. In the
fifth inning, sophomore third baseman Alex
Blandino and junior shortstop Lonnie Kauppi
la singled to start off the fifth, Ringo moved
the pair over with a sacrifice bunt and a wild
pitch allowed Blandino to score, bringing the
score to 3-2.
In the sixth, four consecutive singles with
one out from sophomore leftfielder Wayne Tay
lor, junior catcher Brant Whiting, Blandino and
Kauppila knocked in a run and loaded the bases.
After Ringo struck out, Slater came up with a
clutch two-RBI single to put Stanford ahead 5-3.
Junior Danny Diekroeger added an insurance

run in the seventh when he tripled
and later scored on a wild pitch.
The 7-3 victory gave Stanford the
series.
The Cardinal entered Sunday's
contest knowing that, with the team
sitting right on the bubble, a victo
ry could be the difference between
making the postseason and falling
just short.
After UCLA scored a run off
senior starting pitcher Dean McAr
dle in the top of the first, Stanford
fought back with three runs of its
own to pump up the large crowd of
2,679 for the regular-season finale.
Ringo scored on a Ragira double
play to tie the game, but the bases
were cleared with two outs. Junior
eenterfielder Austin Wilson then
was hit by a 3-2 pitch and
Diekroeger, Blandino and Kauppila
all singled to knock in two more
runs and take a 3-1 lead.
But UCLA came right back to
tie things up in the top of the sec
ond. With the bases loaded and on
ly one out, McArdle walked UCLA
shortstop Pat Valaika to give UCLA
a free run. On the next batter,
McArdle fell behind 3-0 and eventu
ally gave up a walk on a wild pitch,
allowing two runs to score. That

would end McArdle's day, with
Stanford turning to Lindquist to
try to keep the game close.
Lindquist did his job, allowing
only one unearned run in 4.1 in
nings to keep Stanford within strik
ing distance. But the Cardinal bats
couldn't muster any runs between
the first and ninth innings, falling
behind 6-3 after a Blandino throw
ing error turned into two unearned
runs in the seventh.
After Garrett Hughes held the
Bruins to only one unearned in the
final three innings, Stanford had
one last chance at a comeback to try
to sway the selection committee
with one final victory. But it had to
come against UCLA's star closer
David Berg, who entered the game
with only four earned runs allowed
in 63 innings.
That didn't stop Blandino from
trying to atone for his error. The
sophomore took a 0-1 pitch and put
it over the left-field fence for a solo
homer his seventh of the season
to cut the lead to two.
"Nobody likes to be an out in the
last inning of the last game of the
year," Blandino said. "I think
[Berg] left one in the middle of the
plate there and I just put a good
swing on it."
Kauppila followed Blandino with
a single, bringing the tying run to
the plate. After Taylor grounded
out to second base, advancing
Kauppila to second, head coach

Mark Marquess decided to have
sophomore outfielder Dominic Jose
pinch-hit for Whiting, the team's
leading hitter with a .344 average.
Jose made good contact on a 0-2
pitch but grounded out to second
base to give UCLA a 6-4 win and
end Stanford's 2013 season.
The Cardinal's postseason fate
was sealed when Stanford's name
wasn't called during the NCAA
Championships Selection Show at 9
a.m. on Monday. Stanford hoped its
conference standings tied for
fourth with Arizona State and its
7-3 Pac-12 series record would be
enough to earn an at-large berth,
but nonconference struggles
doomed the Cardinal.
The next important event for
Stanford is next week's Major
League Baseball Draft, where
many of Stanford's juniors and sen
iors are expected to be selected.
Which juniors decide to sign with
an MLB team and which decide to
return to Stanford for a senior year
could be critical to Stanford's 2014
hopes.
The MLB Draft runs from June
6-8, with Appel, Wilson, Ragira and
junior pitcher A. J. Vanegas who
missed most of the season with a
back injury and then mononucleosis
potentially being early-round
picks.

ins will be one of the 16 teams to host an NCAA
Regional.

On Friday night, senior starting pitcher Mark
Appel became the Stanford career strikeout leader
with his 364 th strikeout on a check swing on the
first batter of the game.
In his last start at Sunken Diamond, Appel
had a brilliant performance. With Theo Epstein,
the Chicago Cubs' President of Baseball Opera
tions, sitting a few rows behind home plate to
scout him, Appel picked up nine strikeouts while
allowing only one run on three hits in eight in
nings.
But even with Appel's strong outing on the
mound, the victory was far from secure. UCLA
starting pitcher Adam Plutko went blow for blow
with Appel, keeping Stanford off the board
through five innings.
The Cardinal offense came alive in the sixth
with a bloop double down the left field line by
senior designated hitter Justin Ringo, an RBI
triple by sophomore rightfielder Austin Slater
after Slater failed on a bunt attempt and a sacri
fice fly from junior first baseman Brian Ragira.
Just like that, Stanford had a 2-1 lead.
That would be all the support Appel would
need. Senior relief pitcher Garrett Hughes came
on to secure the save, sending the Bruins down
in order with two strikeouts and a fly out to start
senior weekend off with a key 2-1 victory.
"It's been a great career here," Hughes said.
"I love this place. It's got a lot of sentimental val
ue to me. To be able to come out here Friday night
and finish it off, it was a really special feeling."
On Saturday, it was a freshman, not a senior,
who came up big on the mound for the Cardinal.
After sophomore starting pitcher John
Hochstatter left the game trailing 2-1 with two

runners on base
and no one out in
the fifth inning,
freshman relief
pitcher Logan
James shut the
Bruins down.

James allowed only one inherited run to
score on two consecutive groundouts before re
tiring the side in the fifth. James stayed on the
mound into the ninth inning, going 4.2 innings
while allowing no runs on three walks and only
one hit to earn the victory.
An error and a walk in the ninth inning
stopped James from completing the game, as
junior reliever Sam Lindquist came on with two
outs in the ninth and struck out the only batter
he faced for the save.
While James kept UCLA at bay, Stanford's
bats rallied in the fifth through seventh innings
to score six runs and secure a 7-3 victory. In the
fifth inning, sophomore third baseman Alex
Blandino and junior shortstop Lonnie Kauppi
la singled to start off the fifth, Ringo moved
the pair over with a sacrifice bunt and a wild
pitch allowed Blandino to score, bringing the
score to 3-2.
In the sixth, four consecutive singles with
one out from sophomore leftfielder Wayne Tay
lor, junior catcher Brant Whiting, Blandino and
Kauppila knocked in a run and loaded the bases.
After Ringo struck out, Slater came up with a
clutch two-RBI single to put Stanford ahead 5-3.
Junior Danny Diekroeger added an insurance

run in the seventh when he tripled
and later scored on a wild pitch.
The 7-3 victory gave Stanford the
series.
The Cardinal entered Sunday's
contest knowing that, with the team
sitting right on the bubble, a victo
ry could be the difference between
making the postseason and falling
just short.
After UCLA scored a run off
senior starting pitcher Dean McAr
dle in the top of the first, Stanford
fought back with three runs of its
own to pump up the large crowd of
2,679 for the regular-season finale.
Ringo scored on a Ragira double
play to tie the game, but the bases
were cleared with two outs. Junior
eenterfielder Austin Wilson then
was hit by a 3-2 pitch and
Diekroeger, Blandino and Kauppila
all singled to knock in two more
runs and take a 3-1 lead.
But UCLA came right back to
tie things up in the top of the sec
ond. With the bases loaded and on
ly one out, McArdle walked UCLA
shortstop Pat Valaika to give UCLA
a free run. On the next batter,
McArdle fell behind 3-0 and eventu
ally gave up a walk on a wild pitch,
allowing two runs to score. That

would end McArdle's day, with
Stanford turning to Lindquist to
try to keep the game close.
Lindquist did his job, allowing
only one unearned run in 4.1 in
nings to keep Stanford within strik
ing distance. But the Cardinal bats
couldn't muster any runs between
the first and ninth innings, falling
behind 6-3 after a Blandino throw
ing error turned into two unearned
runs in the seventh.
After Garrett Hughes held the
Bruins to only one unearned in the
final three innings, Stanford had
one last chance at a comeback to try
to sway the selection committee
with one final victory. But it had to
come against UCLA's star closer
David Berg, who entered the game
with only four earned runs allowed
in 63 innings.
That didn't stop Blandino from
trying to atone for his error. The
sophomore took a 0-1 pitch and put
it over the left-field fence for a solo
homer his seventh of the season
to cut the lead to two.
"Nobody likes to be an out in the
last inning of the last game of the
year," Blandino said. "I think
[Berg] left one in the middle of the
plate there and I just put a good
swing on it."
Kauppila followed Blandino with
a single, bringing the tying run to
the plate. After Taylor grounded
out to second base, advancing
Kauppila to second, head coach

Mark Marquess decided to have
sophomore outfielder Dominic Jose
pinch-hit for Whiting, the team's
leading hitter with a .344 average.
Jose made good contact on a 0-2
pitch but grounded out to second
base to give UCLA a 6-4 win and
end Stanford's 2013 season.
The Cardinal's postseason fate
was sealed when Stanford's name
wasn't called during the NCAA
Championships Selection Show at 9
a.m. on Monday. Stanford hoped its
conference standings tied for
fourth with Arizona State and its
7-3 Pac-12 series record would be
enough to earn an at-large berth,
but nonconference struggles
doomed the Cardinal.
The next important event for
Stanford is next week's Major
League Baseball Draft, where
many of Stanford's juniors and sen
iors are expected to be selected.
Which juniors decide to sign with
an MLB team and which decide to
return to Stanford for a senior year
could be critical to Stanford's 2014
hopes.
The MLB Draft runs from June
6-8, with Appel, Wilson, Ragira and
junior pitcher A. J. Vanegas who
missed most of the season with a
back injury and then mononucleosis
potentially being early-round
picks.

Stanford (32-22, 16-14 Pac-12) continued to
fight in its late-season resurgence, taking the
first two games of its final regular-season se
ries against No. 11 UCLA (39-17,21-9 Pac-12).
