## Card misses out on tournament bid 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford (32-22, 16-14 Pac-12) continued to
fight in its late-season resurgence, taking the
first two games of its final regular-season se
ries against No. 11 UCLA (39-17,21-9 Pac-12).
But after Sunday's loss, Stanford was not given
a bid to the NCAA Tournament, while the Bru
ins will be one of the 16 teams to host an NCAA
Regional.

On Friday night, senior starting pitcher Mark
Appel became the Stanford career strikeout leader
with his 364 th strikeout on a check swing on the
first batter of the game.
In his last start at Sunken Diamond, Appel
had a brilliant performance. With Theo Epstein,
the Chicago Cubs' President of Baseball Opera
tions, sitting a few rows behind home plate to
scout him, Appel picked up nine strikeouts while
allowing only one run on three hits in eight in
nings.
But even with Appel's strong outing on the
mound, the victory was far from secure. UCLA
starting pitcher Adam Plutko went blow for blow
with Appel, keeping Stanford off the board
through five innings.
The Cardinal offense came alive in the sixth
with a bloop double down the left field line by
senior designated hitter Justin Ringo, an RBI
triple by sophomore rightfielder Austin Slater
after Slater failed on a bunt attempt and a sacri
fice fly from junior first baseman Brian Ragira.
Just like that, Stanford had a 2-1 lead.
That would be all the support Appel would
need. Senior relief pitcher Garrett Hughes came
on to secure the save, sending the Bruins down
in order with two strikeouts and a fly out to start
senior weekend off with a key 2-1 victory.
"It's been a great career here," Hughes said.
"I love this place. It's got a lot of sentimental val
ue to me. To be able to come out here Friday night
and finish it off, it was a really special feeling."
On Saturday, it was a freshman, not a senior,
who came up big on the mound for the Cardinal.
After sophomore starting pitcher John
Hochstatter left the game trailing 2-1 with two

runners on base
and no one out in
the fifth inning,
freshman relief
pitcher Logan
James shut the
Bruins down.

James allowed only one inherited run to
score on two consecutive groundouts before re
tiring the side in the fifth. James stayed on the
mound into the ninth inning, going 4.2 innings
while allowing no runs on three walks and only
one hit to earn the victory.
An error and a walk in the ninth inning
stopped James from completing the game, as
junior reliever Sam Lindquist came on with two
outs in the ninth and struck out the only batter
he faced for the save.
While James kept UCLA at bay, Stanford's
bats rallied in the fifth through seventh innings
to score six runs and secure a 7-3 victory. In the
fifth inning, sophomore third baseman Alex
Blandino and junior shortstop Lonnie Kauppi
la singled to start off the fifth, Ringo moved
the pair over with a sacrifice bunt and a wild
pitch allowed Blandino to score, bringing the
score to 3-2.
In the sixth, four consecutive singles with
one out from sophomore leftfielder Wayne Tay
lor, junior catcher Brant Whiting, Blandino and
Kauppila knocked in a run and loaded the bases.
After Ringo struck out, Slater came up with a
clutch two-RBI single to put Stanford ahead 5-3.
Junior Danny Diekroeger added an insurance
