## Which Drowns You Faster, the Gravity or the Flush? Part II 
### Taylor Brady 
During junior spring, I studied
abroad in China. I cannot con
vey, without overwhelming
you with days of stories, how much
those months in Beijing healed me.
It was like a detox. Last summer, I
had an excellent apartment with the
best roommate that I have ever had
and a self-affirming job in Greece
with Stanford Summer Theater. I
felt ready to face this year.
Yet when senior autumn rolled
around, I still had the backwards
mentality of previous years. I did
drugs too frequently, I didn't try new
things, I didn't contact my friends
and organize times to enjoy each
other's company. I drew into myself.
In fact, if it weren't for the rigor of
my academic schedule and the sheer
fact that I had to work with friends
to not screw up my senior core
courses in civil engineering, I might
have relapsed even harder.
Finals week that quarter was a
monster. I had five sit-downs, and
when I finished the last one, I still
had to go home and finish a lab re
port for geotechnical engineering.
After I clicked "send," officially end
ing my quarter, I immediately went
and got high. Friends drove me to
my favorite Chinese restaurant
where we shared a delicious meal
but when I returned to my room that
night and lay alone on my mattress,
I began to excoriate myself for my
ignorance. I knew that I had to start
taking responsibility for myself, and
so I tossed the baggie reading "have
a hempy New Year" and went home
to Tfrcson for a real detox.
Winter quarter, I enrolled in 22
units and audited 2 more. Seven
classes. I haven't talked to another
student who understands what
that's like, probably because that
much work makes us rather socially
inaccessible, but I'm sure that you
can imagine.
My friends called me crazy.
Every #seniorzforlyfe on Instagram
photos mocked my asceticism. But I
sat down every Sunday and wrote a
to-do list for the week, and then did
it all. I read twelve books for a re
search paper that I am writing for
fun. I worked out every night. I
barely saw my friends. When I
walked out of my last final, disap
pointed that it wasn't harder, I didn't
go and get high. I went skating with
a friend, returned to the dorm at 10
and went right to sleep.
This weekend I did quite a lot, ab
solutely none of it schoolwork. I or
dered dim sum in Chinatown in Can
tonese and my friends laughed at the
gapes of astonishment on the faces
of the employees. I drove a freshman
friend to interview a man who runs a
Silicon Valley fight club. Along with
two other dormmates, I went to see
the Filipino Culture Night at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
That show was beautiful in so
many ways. I found myself, like I
once did, on the verge of tears just
from watching sappy love stories.
Shivering strains of gorgeous music
raised the hair on my upper arms. I
laughed at corny jokes because I
found them funny. What I saw por
trayed on the stage was not, per
haps, true love. Yet the cheers of the

people in the audience, the shouts of
"I see you, Monica!" ringing from
the seats, and the laughter of people
who genuinely cared about one an
other, who spoke about community
and tradition, swelled that cavernous
hall with genuine affection.
I saw on that stage community
that I miss, community of which I
wish I had made myself a part. I'm
not Filipino, but there were non-Fil
ipino folks up on that stage, so I
know that the community is welcom
ing, if you come to it with an open
mind and an open heart. Perhaps I
could have done more with MEChA,
if I wanted something more perti
nent to my culture but the point
here is that we must not live in isola
tion at Stanford, even though it takes
discipline for us introverts to be ex
troverted.
It strikes me as ironic, of course,
that I consistently pitch the need for
culture and community and yet am
still a hermit sometimes. Writing,
my passion, requires me to spend
hours on end in solitude, but I'm be
ginning to recognize that "solitude"
doesn't mean that I have to consume
or create language alone. I could
never have learned Mandarin, or
Spanish, or Cantonese, if I hadn't
conversed with native speakers, and
my fiction, too, needs to be tempered
by the stories and lives of my fellow
human beings, much as I may (now
half-heartedly) profess to abhor
them.
If there's a single moral, or a sin
gle lesson, I guess, that I want to
leave to Stanford, it is this: don't go it
alone. Of course you can't meet or
please everybody, but a loving com
munity can smooth your passage so
much. I'm grateful to the ones who
have stuck by me even when I was
drowning myself.
The great thing about senior
spring is the apathy. I'm taking 20
units, but five of them are pass/fail
and I spend most of my time with
various friends savoring warm after
noons. I have decided to take a leave
of absence for a year before continu
ing my co-term in the fall of 2014, to
live my life in the disciplined, outgo
ing way that I know that I need to.
Maybe it'll be weird when I return, a
couple of languages and a few grand
richer, but I think I'm gonna be that
grad student who spends time in un
dergrad communities. If the Filipino
Student Network would take me in,
I'd love to be a part but regard
less of where I seek acceptance, I'm
going to go at it with an open mind,
ready to listen.
I want to end with this note to
first-gen folks: you are, unequivocal
ly, good enough. In fact, your experi
ences are not weight to drag you
down, but a particular buoyancy that
your wealthier friends simply do not
have, although perhaps you do not
know how to use it yet. Here's how:
realize that you have to give of your
self to get research, scholarships,
friends, but that once you do, there is
an ever-expanding group of folks
that would legitimately hate to lose
you. Be that person.

richer, but I think I'm gonna be that
grad student who spends time in un
dergrad communities. If the Filipino
Student Network would take me in,
I'd love to be a part but regard
less of where I seek acceptance, I'm
going to go at it with an open mind,
ready to listen.
I want to end with this note to
first-gen folks: you are, unequivocal
ly, good enough. In fact, your experi
ences are not weight to drag you
down, but a particular buoyancy that
your wealthier friends simply do not
have, although perhaps you do not
know how to use it yet. Here's how:
realize that you have to give of your
self to get research, scholarships,
friends, but that once you do, there is
an ever-expanding group of folks
that would legitimately hate to lose
you. Be that person.

During junior spring, I studied
abroad in China. I cannot con
vey, without overwhelming
you with days of stories, how much
those months in Beijing healed me.
It was like a detox. Last summer, I
had an excellent apartment with the
best roommate that I have ever had
and a self-affirming job in Greece
with Stanford Summer Theater. I
felt ready to face this year.
Yet when senior autumn rolled
around, I still had the backwards
mentality of previous years. I did
drugs too frequently, I didn't try new
things, I didn't contact my friends
and organize times to enjoy each
other's company. I drew into myself.
In fact, if it weren't for the rigor of
my academic schedule and the sheer
fact that I had to work with friends
to not screw up my senior core
courses in civil engineering, I might
have relapsed even harder.
Finals week that quarter was a
monster. I had five sit-downs, and
when I finished the last one, I still
had to go home and finish a lab re
port for geotechnical engineering.
After I clicked "send," officially end
ing my quarter, I immediately went
and got high. Friends drove me to
my favorite Chinese restaurant
where we shared a delicious meal
but when I returned to my room that
night and lay alone on my mattress,
I began to excoriate myself for my
ignorance. I knew that I had to start
taking responsibility for myself, and
so I tossed the baggie reading "have
a hempy New Year" and went home
to Tfrcson for a real detox.
Winter quarter, I enrolled in 22
units and audited 2 more. Seven
classes. I haven't talked to another
student who understands what
that's like, probably because that
much work makes us rather socially
inaccessible, but I'm sure that you
can imagine.
My friends called me crazy.
Every #seniorzforlyfe on Instagram
photos mocked my asceticism. But I
sat down every Sunday and wrote a
to-do list for the week, and then did
it all. I read twelve books for a re
search paper that I am writing for
fun. I worked out every night. I
barely saw my friends. When I
walked out of my last final, disap
pointed that it wasn't harder, I didn't
go and get high. I went skating with
a friend, returned to the dorm at 10
and went right to sleep.
This weekend I did quite a lot, ab
solutely none of it schoolwork. I or
dered dim sum in Chinatown in Can
tonese and my friends laughed at the
gapes of astonishment on the faces
of the employees. I drove a freshman
friend to interview a man who runs a
Silicon Valley fight club. Along with
two other dormmates, I went to see
the Filipino Culture Night at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
That show was beautiful in so
many ways. I found myself, like I
once did, on the verge of tears just
from watching sappy love stories.
Shivering strains of gorgeous music
raised the hair on my upper arms. I
laughed at corny jokes because I
found them funny. What I saw por
trayed on the stage was not, per
haps, true love. Yet the cheers of the

people in the audience, the shouts of
"I see you, Monica!" ringing from
the seats, and the laughter of people
who genuinely cared about one an
other, who spoke about community
and tradition, swelled that cavernous
hall with genuine affection.
I saw on that stage community
that I miss, community of which I
wish I had made myself a part. I'm
not Filipino, but there were non-Fil
ipino folks up on that stage, so I
know that the community is welcom
ing, if you come to it with an open
mind and an open heart. Perhaps I
could have done more with MEChA,
if I wanted something more perti
nent to my culture but the point
here is that we must not live in isola
tion at Stanford, even though it takes
discipline for us introverts to be ex
troverted.
It strikes me as ironic, of course,
that I consistently pitch the need for
culture and community and yet am
still a hermit sometimes. Writing,
my passion, requires me to spend
hours on end in solitude, but I'm be
ginning to recognize that "solitude"
doesn't mean that I have to consume
or create language alone. I could
never have learned Mandarin, or
Spanish, or Cantonese, if I hadn't
conversed with native speakers, and
my fiction, too, needs to be tempered
by the stories and lives of my fellow
human beings, much as I may (now
half-heartedly) profess to abhor
them.
If there's a single moral, or a sin
gle lesson, I guess, that I want to
leave to Stanford, it is this: don't go it
alone. Of course you can't meet or
please everybody, but a loving com
munity can smooth your passage so
much. I'm grateful to the ones who
have stuck by me even when I was
drowning myself.
The great thing about senior
spring is the apathy. I'm taking 20
units, but five of them are pass/fail
and I spend most of my time with
various friends savoring warm after
noons. I have decided to take a leave
of absence for a year before continu
ing my co-term in the fall of 2014, to
live my life in the disciplined, outgo
ing way that I know that I need to.
Maybe it'll be weird when I return, a
couple of languages and a few grand
richer, but I think I'm gonna be that
grad student who spends time in un
dergrad communities. If the Filipino
