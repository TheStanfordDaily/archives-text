# NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND
## Why I Fasted for Guantanamo 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
//Twill never forget the first
I time they passed the feed-
J-ing tube up my nose. I
can't describe how painful it is to
be force-fed this way. As it was
thrust in, it made me feel like
throwing up. I wanted to vomit,
but I couldn't. There was agony in
my chest, throat and stomach. I
had never experienced such pain
before. I would not wish this cru
el punishment upon anyone."
These words come from Samir
Naji al Hasan Moqbel, one of 166
Guantanamo Bay detainees. As of
last Wednesday, Moqbel and 102 of
his fellow detainees or over two
thirds of the 166 political prisoners
in Guantanamo Bay detention
camp have been on a hunger
strike for over 100 days. The Unit
ed States is force-feeding 31 of
these men in a process that the
United Nations considers a "clear

form of torture."
Last week, I joined students
across campus and concerned peo
ple around the country in a 24-hour
solidarity fast with hunger-striking
political prisoners in Guantanamo
Bay. Ten student groups, including
Stanford NAACR MEChA, Stan
ford Asian American Activism
Committee, Students for Palestin
ian Equal Rights, Students for
Queer Liberation and Stanford La
bor Action Coalition endorsed
Stanford's participation in this
larger action.
While I attended the opening
rally for the solidarity fast last
Thursday evening, I was too hesi
tant to offer off-the-cuff remarks. I
use this week's column to share
some of the thoughts that were on
my mind.
Without speaking for any of the
endorsing groups, I imagine that

we all participated in this solidarity
fast largely because we recognize
the commonalities between the is
sues our respective communities
face and the plight of the 166 cap
tives of the United States.
The same state that detains and
tortures hundreds of men in sheer
disregard for international law in
carcerates and disenfranchises mil
lions of its citizens in prisons
around the country. The same state
that facilitates these violations of
international law on land that does
not belong to it imposes harsh bor
der control tactics on both sides of a
border (a border of land that also
does not belong to it). The same
state that detains people indefinitely
without charge funds billions of dol
lars to a military regime that detains
thousands of men, women and chil
dren indefinitely. The list goes on.
Beyond demanding an end to
these inhumane policies and con
demning our peers for their silence
or ignorance, I hope we can unite
around our shared values and expe
rience to create a society that, to
paraphrase Dr. King, can be at
peace with itself and live with its
own conscience.
Though our actions are largely
symbolic, I hope they represent the
potential for unity among groups
representing vast segments of our
society to create a world that pre
vents the tyranny of any state actor
against any group of people.
To close, I present some infor
mation I learned from a handout
during the rally, courtesy of the
Center for Constitutional Rights:
779 men have been held in
Guantanamo since 2002.
All of the men who have been
held in Guantanamo are Muslim.
604 men have been transferred
from Guantanamo, leaving 166 pris
oners remaining.
86 of these men have been
cleared for release from the prison,
but remain in detention.
46 are slated to be detained in
definitely as the U.S. government
claims they cannot be released or
prosecuted.
At least 22 men were under the
age of 18 when they were captured.
Most men have been held in
Guantanamo for 10 years or more.
0 senior government officials
have been held accountable for hu
man rights abuses in Guantanamo
Bay.
