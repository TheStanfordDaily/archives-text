## Startups speed date investors ASES event pairs student startups, venture capitalists 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Asia-Pacific Student En
trepreneurship Society (ASES)
held its 15th VC3 event on May
25, reviving the program after a
one-year hiatus to connect 16 stu
dent startups with venture capi
talists (VCs) in "speed dating"
sessions.
According to ASES Presi
dent-Elect Kuan Peng 'l5, the
event often attracts investors in
terested in companies that can
operate in the Asian market. In
vestors listen to three-minute
product pitches from startup
founders that rotate through
their tables before giving three
minutes of feedback on each
presentation.
"VC3's unique perspective al
lows people to get their ideas
[across] more quickly," Peng
said. "This clearly helps give
[the founders] a network and is
something that not every event
achieves."
As well as connecting
founders with venture capitalists,
the program allows students to
gain experience pitching to po
tential investors and to get feed
back on their ideas. Financial Di
rector Evelyn Xue 'l6 described
VC3 as the "premier event for
VCs to connect with startups."
"I was really excited to see the
event come together," she said.
"Being able to land so many high
caliber VCs was amazing, and be
ing able to screen all these high
caliber startups was incredible."
Student presence
Invited startup founders
were chosen through an on
line application process, with
the majority being Stanford
undergraduates.
Matthew Fernandez 'l6
was selected to pitch his start
up Simple Emotion, a compa
ny that uses voice-analysis
technology to help people with
autism detect emotion and
other voice patterns.
"It does exactly what be
havioral therapy does," Fer
nandez said. "Except that
the costs are significantly
below professional therapy."
The event was also attend
ed by Alexo co-founders
Rahul Mitra 'l5, Ilina Mitra
Ph.D. 'l7 and Marcus Weber
Ph.D. 'l7. Alexo offers users a
transmitter small enough to
fit into wearable items that,
when pressed, sends a mes
sage to a list of pre-pro
grammed contacts through
the user's smartphone.
"We believe women
should feel safe," Mitra said.
"The transmitter button is
not too easy to set off acciden
tally but is easy to activate in
an emergency."
After the "speed dating"
event, entrepreneurs listened
to a keynote address by Phil
Libin, CEO of Evernote. Lib
in warned students about be
coming entrepreneurs for
reasons that have become
part of conventional wisdom,
such as a desire for money
and power.
"The number of companies
that succeed is tiny," he said.
"There are many other fields
where you can earn a lot more

money in the same ten years it
takes to build up a successful
company, and you need to be
able to afford to fail."
Libin referenced his own
experience developing Ever
note as a successful model
for budding entrepreneurs
to follow.
"Business is not a zero
sum game. In order for you to
succeed, others do not have to
fail. That's what we've been
trying to do at Evernote
build a global company," he
said. "We just want to make a
product that's so good that it
doesn't need to change for a
market or when another com
petitor comes around."
Feedback from venture
capitalists
This year's event was at
tended by more than 15 ven
ture capitalists, including Y
Combinator partner Garry
Tan 'O3, Draper Fisher Ju
rvetson Dragon Fund manag
ing director Bobby Chao M.S.
'77 and General Catalyst
Partners principal Niko Bon
atsos M.S. 'll.
Chao, who last attended
the event over a decade ago,
said that he enjoyed speaking
to entrepreneurs though
he suggested that a longer
time be allocated for each
pitch and noted that this
year's VC3 attendees seemed
to be at a more advanced
stage than in previous years.
"Ten years ago, it was
more about students coming
in with a good idea and need
ing direction," Chao said.
"Now, there are more busi
ness-minded students, and
they come in ready with
plans and business models
they are more realistic."
