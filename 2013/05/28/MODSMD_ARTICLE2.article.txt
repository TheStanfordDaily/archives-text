### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Asia-Pacific Student En
trepreneurship Society (ASES)
held its 15th VC3 event on May
25, reviving the program after a
one-year hiatus to connect 16 stu
dent startups with venture capi
talists (VCs) in "speed dating"
sessions.
According to ASES Presi
dent-Elect Kuan Peng 'l5, the
event often attracts investors in
terested in companies that can
operate in the Asian market. In
vestors listen to three-minute
product pitches from startup
founders that rotate through
their tables before giving three
minutes of feedback on each
presentation.
"VC3's unique perspective al
lows people to get their ideas
[across] more quickly," Peng
said. "This clearly helps give
[the founders] a network and is
something that not every event
achieves."
As well as connecting
founders with venture capitalists,
the program allows students to
gain experience pitching to po
tential investors and to get feed
back on their ideas. Financial Di
rector Evelyn Xue 'l6 described
VC3 as the "premier event for
VCs to connect with startups."
"I was really excited to see the
event come together," she said.
"Being able to land so many high
caliber VCs was amazing, and be
ing able to screen all these high
caliber startups was incredible."
