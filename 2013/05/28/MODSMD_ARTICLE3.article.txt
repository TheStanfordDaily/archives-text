## 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ZAP and Sigma Chi residents have led a recent
fundraising effort to aid three dining staff workers and
their family who lost their home and possessions in a re
cent fire, raising over $19,000 in total.
Nico Melgoza, ZAP's chef for almost a decade, was
forced out along with his daughter Mariela, a ZAP
hasher, and his nephew Hugo, a Sigma Chi kitchen as
sistant of his apartment unit with his extended fam
ily by a fire the night of May 15. Their insurance did not
cover any of their possessions.
In an effort to lend a hand, Maya Ghosn 'l3, a ZAP
resident, decided to set up a WePay donation page for
Nico's family.
"I wanted to almost empower our chef by giving him
money that he could give to his relatives, so as to just
add a supplemental donation," Ghosn said.
According to the donation website, the campaign
aims to raise $5,000 for Nico's family by the end of the

academic year. Within a week of the
campaign's launch, $2,010 had been
raised.
"Some members of our staff
have been incredible," Ghosn said.
"They have been emailing the dona
tion page to their own lists and say
ing why they care."
Ghosn singled out one ZAP staff
member who made an exceptional
effort to raise awareness in his com
munity.
"I know this member of our
staff who has been personally af
fected by the fire," Ghosn said. "So
he sent out an email to his own lists,
saying 'I have experienced it and I
know how difficult it is.' Because of
that knowledge he sent out, we got

300 to 700 dollars."
Apart from monetary donations,
mainly ranging from $l5 to $lOO,
Ghosn also encouraged donations of
clothing and housing appliances to
buffer the family's financial losses.
"Obviously everything is help
ful, since they don't have any insur
ance to cover their home and hence
do really need everything," Ghosn
said. "They need to rebuild from
scratch."
According to Ghosn, enough
clothing has been donated to fill
three or four large trash bags.
"Instead of selling a lot of stuff
at the end of the year, we just decid
ed to donate it," Ghosn said.
Ghosn attributed the generous
response to Nico's care for her and
her fellow residents.
"I personally have a lot of food
allergies," Ghosn said. "So I think
the reason I care so much about it is
that Nico has been so good about it.

Every time he cooks a meal, he
cooks a special meal for me."
Kevin Guo 'l3 M.S. 'l3, another
ZAP resident, donated $5O to the
campaign after hearing how the fire
affected an integral part of the ZAP
community.
"He always goes out of the way
to answer any special request of us
and he really makes an effort to try
and talk to us individually," Guo em
phasized.
Other fundraising efforts in
clude an online campaign organized
by Sigma Chi, which has raised
$17,375 to help Hugo to date.
"We are all part of [the] Stan
ford community and many of his
family are involved in [the] Stan
ford community," Guo said. "So we
should all help out in any way we
can."
