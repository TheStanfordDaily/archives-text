## Nurses' contract dispute continues University hospitals' nurses vote to reject newly negotiated contract despite mediation 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
An ongoing contract dispute between University
hospitals and 2,700 nurses looks set to continue after
nurses last week rejected a new contract agreement
negotiated by the hospitals and union leaders earlier
this month.
Negotiations between the Committee for Recog
nition of Nursing Achievement (CRONA), the Stan
ford Hospital and Clinics (SHC) and Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital (LPCH) started in January. Gre
gory Lim, a federal mediator, was brought in at the
beginning of April to facilitate further discussions be
tween CRONA representatives and the hospitals.
The proposed agreement included retroactive
wage increases, a more lenient attendance policy and

a quicker turnaround time in correcting payroll er
rors, among other adjustments.
Though CRONAs negotiations team supported
the proposed contract, only 46 percent of the nurses
voted in favor of the agreement on May 23, with the
majority of members either voting against the con
tract or abstaining. Nurses either voted in-person at
the Dermody Center or had another CRONA mem
ber submit a proxy ballot for them.
Several nurses criticized the voting process on
CRONA's Facebook page, arguing that not voting
should not count as a "no" vote. Other nurses com
plained that there was not enough time to review the
contract before voting.
"You've got to be kidding me. I think there needs
to be another vote," commented Rristen Rhinehart,
who works at the Stanford Medical Center. "Literal
ly 3 days between bringing it to us and voting, miss
es a lot of people who work 12s, on vacation, etc. I
vote for a re-vote."
As a result of the agree
ment's rejection, CRONA
leaders will meet to discuss
the union's plan of action go
ing forward, which could in
volve a strike. On May 7, 97
percent of CRONA mem
bers voted to authorize a
strike if the outcome of the
negotiations continued to be
unfavorable.
CRONA nurses voted to
authorize a strike in 2011 and
2010. The last time they held
a strike, however, was in
June 2000, when the nurses
were absent for 55 days. The
hospitals were forced to hire
500 replacement nurses and
transfer over 20 seriously ill
children to other hospitals.
In a press release issued
on May 10, CRONA remind
ed the hospitals of the nega
tive consequences of a nurs
es' strike, referencing a 2011
incident at the Alta Bates
Summit Medical Center in
which the replacement of a
nurse on strike resulted in a
patient's death.
The statement also cited
a 2009 study conducted by
researchers at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Tech
nology and Carnegie Mellon
University that revealed that
nurses' strikes increase in
hospital mortality by 19.4
percent.
"Should the Nurses have
to strike, the public should
be very concerned about the
impact to the patients' care,"
said Lorie Johnson, presi
dent of CRONA, in the press
release. "Given the high
acuities of our patients, the
replacements Nurses will
simply not be up to the stan
dard of care of CRONA
Nurses."
However, in a joint state
ment released by SHC and
LPCH, hospital officials ex
pressed confidence that fu
ture negotiations would be
successful.
"We are deeply disap
pointed to report that on
Thursday, May 23, 2013, an
insufficient number of our
Hospitals' CRONA-repre
sented Nurses voted to ratify
the tentative agreement
signed and endorsed by their
union on May 18, 2013," the
statement read. "The Hospi
tals remain committed to the
core elements of the May 18,
2013, tentative agreement
and are prepared to go back
to the table to bargain to
completion."
Stanford has a long histo
ry of contract disputes with
nurses represented by
CRONA. Last April, after
more than a year of negotia
tions, CRONA members vot
ed to approve a new contract
with the hospitals.
Some of the most notable
additions to the contract in
cluded a retroactive four per
cent pay increase, a two to
four percent planned wage
increase for 2012 and 2013
and a new program that al
lowed nurses with 20 years
or more of service to achieve
a higher nurse classification.
This contract expired on
March 31, though it has since
been extended to accommo
date the time needed for ne
gotiations.

to strike, the public should
be very concerned about the
impact to the patients' care,"
said Lorie Johnson, presi
dent of CRONA, in the press
release. "Given the high
acuities of our patients, the
replacements Nurses will
simply not be up to the stan
dard of care of CRONA
Nurses."
However, in a joint state
ment released by SHC and
LPCH, hospital officials ex
pressed confidence that fu
ture negotiations would be
successful.
"We are deeply disap
pointed to report that on
Thursday, May 23, 2013, an
insufficient number of our
Hospitals' CRONA-repre
sented Nurses voted to ratify
the tentative agreement
signed and endorsed by their
union on May 18, 2013," the
statement read. "The Hospi
tals remain committed to the
core elements of the May 18,
2013, tentative agreement
and are prepared to go back
to the table to bargain to
completion."
Stanford has a long histo
ry of contract disputes with
nurses represented by
CRONA. Last April, after
more than a year of negotia
tions, CRONA members vot
ed to approve a new contract
with the hospitals.
Some of the most notable
additions to the contract in
cluded a retroactive four per
cent pay increase, a two to
four percent planned wage
increase for 2012 and 2013
and a new program that al
lowed nurses with 20 years
or more of service to achieve
a higher nurse classification.
This contract expired on
March 31, though it has since
been extended to accommo
date the time needed for ne
gotiations.
