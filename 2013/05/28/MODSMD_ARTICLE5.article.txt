# GIBBS DEFENDS TITLE
## WILL SKIP SENIOR SEASON FOR PROS 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Junior Nicole Gibbs captured the NCAA
singles title over Nebraska's Mary Weather
holt 6-2,6-4 on Monday, successfully defending
her title to become the first repeat NCAA sin
gles champion since Stanford's Amber Liu 'O6
in 2004. After the match, Gibbs announced she
would be foregoing her senior season to begin
her professional career.
Gibbs, who led the Cardinal to a team
NCAA title last week before cruising through
the individual tournament without dropping a
set this week, is the second Stanford player in
history to boast an NCAA team, singles and
doubles title.
Gibbs defeated former teammate Mallory
Burdette 'l3 in the finals last year to win her
first individual title. But it wouldn't be her last.
The Ail-American won six straight matches to
hold onto the crown.
"The biggest sensation I felt was relief and
then happiness for everything I accomplished,"
Gibbs said. "There was a lot of pressure late in
the week with lots of interviews about repeat
ing and of course my own expectations to de
fend the title. I played a really nervous match
[against Weatherholt] and was pretty tight
throughout."
All the focus was on singles as both of Stan
ford's doubles teams were eliminated in the
first round. The duo of Gibbs and junior Kristie
Ahn fell to Tulsa's Isaura Enrique and Saman
tha Vickers 6-2, 6-4. Senior Stacey Tan and
sophomore Ellen Tsay didn't have much luck
either, losing to Lauren Embree and Sofie
Oyen of Florida 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
In the first round of singles, No. 13 Gibbs

defeated No. 47 Yang Pang of
Arkansas 7-5, 6-4 in the tight
est match of her run. Ahn, who
clinched the team title for Stan
ford last week in a spectacular
match, fell to Kansas State's Pe
tra Niedermayerova 6-2, 6-1.
Freshman Krista Hardebeck
won her first NCAA singles
match over Pleun Burgmans of
Auburn 4-6,6-3, 6-4 to move in
to the second round.
"I had a little bit of a let
down after the team champi
onship," Gibbs said. "Getting
through first round was really
tough for me. My first round
match was probably the tough
est match I had all week. [Pang]
came out to play and was pretty
fearless."
Stanford's representatives
had continued success in the
second round as Gibbs breezed
past Michigan's Ronit Yurovsky
64,64, and Hardebeck beat Vir
ginia Commonwealth's Cindy
Chala 1-6, 7-5, 64. That was the
third time in her last four match
es where Hardebeck lost the first
set only to win the match.
"Tennis is just a long sport,"
Hardebeck said. "Your oppo
nent has a long ways to go be
fore she wins, so in most cases it
gives you something to fight for
and makes you jumpstart your
game to play better."
The Round of 16 marked the
end for the freshman All-Amer
ican. Hardebeck couldn't get
past No. 6 Laura Herring of
Georgia, who won the match 6-
0, 6-2.
"That was my seventh
match of the week, and I'd been
having two-hour plus matches
every day," Hardebeck said. "I

was pretty physically fatigued,
and [Herring] played very well
and is a great player, so I had to
be on the top of my game if I
wanted to beat her and unfortu
nately I wasn't able to be
there."
Gibbs really started to gain
momentum in the Sweet Six
teen. In a repeat matchup from
the team championship days be
fore, she played Texas A&M's
Christina Sanchez-Quintanar. In
their first meeting, Gibbs was
shut out for the first time in her
collegiate career in the first set
but rallied back to win twelve
straight games and take the
match 0-6, 6-2, 6-0. This time
around was easier for the
NCAA champ, who beat
Sanchez-Quintanar 6-4, 6-4.
Play seemed to get only eas
ier for Gibbs, who defeated No.
16 Yana Koroleva of Clemson 6-
1,6-1 in the quarterfinal, No. 31
Breaunna Addison of Texas 6-1,
6-1 in the semifinal and Weath
erholt in the final, losing only a
combined 10 games over her fi
nal three matches.
"I picked up a lot of momen
tum throughout the tourna
ment," Gibbs said. "As I worked
into the draw I started to feel
my shots and my body was feel
ing great. The trainers were
taking great care of me, but by
the time I got to Sanchez I was
a little nervous because of our
match in the team tournament.
From that point on though, I
played really well and was able
to take it to a new level."
Gibbs' victory in Monday's
final marked her last match as a
Stanford student-athlete.
Gibbs will skip here senior sea

son on the Farm to enter the
pro circuit, just as her team
mate Burdette did last year.
"It's been a really scary de
cision for me," Gibbs said. "I
love Stanford and I've had such
a great time through my three
years here. I've had great expe
riences with the team, my
coaches, and the overall Stan
ford college experience. It's a
decision I've had in the back of
my mind since winning last
year, but I wanted to develop
my skills and try for a team ti
tle. I'm very sad to forgo my
senior year but I'm excited to
play professionally."
Gibbs will leave Stanford as
a two-time NCAA singles
champion, a Pac-12 champion
and holder of a 111-15 overall
record in match play.
"[Gibbs] showed not just me
but a whole bunch of people
that you can get way better in
college," Hardebeck said. "It
doesn't always seem possible,
but she's done a great job of
balancing school and tennis,
and that is sometimes really
difficult."
Like Gibbs, Hardebeck en
tered Stanford as a No. 1 re
cruit and considered turning
straight to the pro circuit after
high school. Hardebeck will re
turn for the Cardinal next year.
Gibbs' victory marked the
official end of Stanford's sea
son, but the Cardinal will be
back without Gibbs, Tan and
senior Natalie Dillon next year
as it tries to repeat the success
of its championship season.

and makes you jumpstart your
game to play better."
The Round of 16 marked the
end for the freshman All-Amer
ican. Hardebeck couldn't get
past No. 6 Laura Herring of
Georgia, who won the match 6-
0, 6-2.
"That was my seventh
match of the week, and I'd been
having two-hour plus matches
every day," Hardebeck said. "I

was pretty physically fatigued,
and [Herring] played very well
and is a great player, so I had to
be on the top of my game if I
wanted to beat her and unfortu
nately I wasn't able to be
there."
Gibbs really started to gain
momentum in the Sweet Six
teen. In a repeat matchup from
the team championship days be
fore, she played Texas A&M's
Christina Sanchez-Quintanar. In
their first meeting, Gibbs was
shut out for the first time in her
collegiate career in the first set
but rallied back to win twelve
straight games and take the
match 0-6, 6-2, 6-0. This time
around was easier for the
NCAA champ, who beat
Sanchez-Quintanar 6-4, 6-4.
Play seemed to get only eas
ier for Gibbs, who defeated No.
16 Yana Koroleva of Clemson 6-
1,6-1 in the quarterfinal, No. 31
Breaunna Addison of Texas 6-1,
6-1 in the semifinal and Weath
erholt in the final, losing only a
combined 10 games over her fi
nal three matches.
"I picked up a lot of momen
tum throughout the tourna
ment," Gibbs said. "As I worked
into the draw I started to feel
my shots and my body was feel
ing great. The trainers were
taking great care of me, but by
the time I got to Sanchez I was
a little nervous because of our
match in the team tournament.
From that point on though, I
played really well and was able
to take it to a new level."
Gibbs' victory in Monday's
final marked her last match as a
Stanford student-athlete.
Gibbs will skip here senior sea

son on the Farm to enter the
pro circuit, just as her team
mate Burdette did last year.
"It's been a really scary de
cision for me," Gibbs said. "I
love Stanford and I've had such
a great time through my three
years here. I've had great expe
riences with the team, my
coaches, and the overall Stan
ford college experience. It's a
decision I've had in the back of
my mind since winning last
year, but I wanted to develop
my skills and try for a team ti
tle. I'm very sad to forgo my
senior year but I'm excited to
play professionally."
Gibbs will leave Stanford as
a two-time NCAA singles
champion, a Pac-12 champion
and holder of a 111-15 overall
record in match play.
"[Gibbs] showed not just me
but a whole bunch of people
that you can get way better in
college," Hardebeck said. "It
doesn't always seem possible,
but she's done a great job of
balancing school and tennis,
and that is sometimes really
difficult."
Like Gibbs, Hardebeck en
tered Stanford as a No. 1 re
cruit and considered turning
straight to the pro circuit after
high school. Hardebeck will re
turn for the Cardinal next year.
Gibbs' victory marked the
official end of Stanford's sea
son, but the Cardinal will be
back without Gibbs, Tan and
senior Natalie Dillon next year
as it tries to repeat the success
of its championship season.

Junior Nicole Gibbs captured the NCAA
singles title over Nebraska's Mary Weather
holt 6-2,6-4 on Monday, successfully defending
her title to become the first repeat NCAA sin
gles champion since Stanford's Amber Liu 'O6
in 2004. After the match, Gibbs announced she
would be foregoing her senior season to begin
her professional career.
Gibbs, who led the Cardinal to a team
NCAA title last week before cruising through
the individual tournament without dropping a
set this week, is the second Stanford player in
history to boast an NCAA team, singles and
doubles title.
Gibbs defeated former teammate Mallory
Burdette 'l3 in the finals last year to win her
first individual title. But it wouldn't be her last.
The Ail-American won six straight matches to
hold onto the crown.
"The biggest sensation I felt was relief and
then happiness for everything I accomplished,"
Gibbs said. "There was a lot of pressure late in
the week with lots of interviews about repeat
ing and of course my own expectations to de
fend the title. I played a really nervous match
[against Weatherholt] and was pretty tight
throughout."
All the focus was on singles as both of Stan
ford's doubles teams were eliminated in the
first round. The duo of Gibbs and junior Kristie
Ahn fell to Tulsa's Isaura Enrique and Saman
tha Vickers 6-2, 6-4. Senior Stacey Tan and
sophomore Ellen Tsay didn't have much luck
either, losing to Lauren Embree and Sofie
Oyen of Florida 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
In the first round of singles, No. 13 Gibbs

defeated No. 47 Yang Pang of
Arkansas 7-5, 6-4 in the tight
est match of her run. Ahn, who
clinched the team title for Stan
ford last week in a spectacular
match, fell to Kansas State's Pe
tra Niedermayerova 6-2, 6-1.
Freshman Krista Hardebeck
won her first NCAA singles
match over Pleun Burgmans of
Auburn 4-6,6-3, 6-4 to move in
to the second round.
"I had a little bit of a let
down after the team champi
onship," Gibbs said. "Getting
through first round was really
tough for me. My first round
match was probably the tough
est match I had all week. [Pang]
came out to play and was pretty
fearless."
Stanford's representatives
had continued success in the
second round as Gibbs breezed
past Michigan's Ronit Yurovsky
64,64, and Hardebeck beat Vir
ginia Commonwealth's Cindy
Chala 1-6, 7-5, 64. That was the
third time in her last four match
es where Hardebeck lost the first
set only to win the match.
"Tennis is just a long sport,"
Hardebeck said. "Your oppo
nent has a long ways to go be
fore she wins, so in most cases it
gives you something to fight for
and makes you jumpstart your
game to play better."
