# GIBBS DEFENDS TITLE
## WILL SKIP SENIOR SEASON FOR PROS 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Junior Nicole Gibbs captured the NCAA
singles title over Nebraska's Mary Weather
holt 6-2,6-4 on Monday, successfully defending
her title to become the first repeat NCAA sin
gles champion since Stanford's Amber Liu 'O6
in 2004. After the match, Gibbs announced she
would be foregoing her senior season to begin
her professional career.
Gibbs, who led the Cardinal to a team
NCAA title last week before cruising through
the individual tournament without dropping a
set this week, is the second Stanford player in
history to boast an NCAA team, singles and
doubles title.
Gibbs defeated former teammate Mallory
Burdette 'l3 in the finals last year to win her
first individual title. But it wouldn't be her last.
The Ail-American won six straight matches to
hold onto the crown.
"The biggest sensation I felt was relief and
then happiness for everything I accomplished,"
Gibbs said. "There was a lot of pressure late in
the week with lots of interviews about repeat
ing and of course my own expectations to de
fend the title. I played a really nervous match
[against Weatherholt] and was pretty tight
throughout."
All the focus was on singles as both of Stan
ford's doubles teams were eliminated in the
first round. The duo of Gibbs and junior Kristie
Ahn fell to Tulsa's Isaura Enrique and Saman
tha Vickers 6-2, 6-4. Senior Stacey Tan and
sophomore Ellen Tsay didn't have much luck
either, losing to Lauren Embree and Sofie
Oyen of Florida 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
In the first round of singles, No. 13 Gibbs
