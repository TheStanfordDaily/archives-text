## LINA KHATIB PROGRAM ON ARAB REFORM AND DEMOCRACY 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Lina Khatib, co-founder of the Pro
gram on Arab Reform and Democracy at
Stanford's Center on Democracy, Devel
opment, and Rule of Law, has been an
outspoken voice in favor of American in
tervention in Syria. Together with Larry
Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, she authored an article last
month in The Atlantic making the case
for greater American and international
involvement. The Daily sat down with
Khatib to further discuss the conflict in
Syria and what might come after.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You said
that you were interested in Syria be
fore the uprisings. What captured your
interest before everyone else started
looking at the country?
Lina Khatib (LK): Before the upris
ing, my work on Syria was mainly about
the struggle between the citizens and the
state. I was interested in finding out
whether any voices of dissent existed
within Syria so I went on fieldwork to ex
amine both state propaganda and ac
tivists. At the time, I came to the conclu
sion that the political space in Syria was
very closed and that the state really had
the upper hand.
TSD: Looking at Syria now, what is
your reaction to everything that is go
ing on, and how the international com
munity has decided to respond?
LK: Because the state in Syria is so
strong and it had succeeded before the
uprising in quelling any kind of opposi
tional political voice within Syria, it has
been very difficult for the Syrian opposi
tion since the start of the uprising to
stand up to the state effectively. I think
this is not surprising because of the lack
of experience in engaging in oppositional
politics. Having said that, the interna
tional community has set the bar too
high for the opposition in terms of ex
pecting the Syrian opposition to be more
sophisticated, to be more united, to have
clear goals it's not realistic to have
these kinds of expectations knowing the
context of Syria.
These kinds of issues have been used
for the past two-and-a-half years or so as
an excuse for the international communi
ty not to intervene in the Syrian crisis
neither diplomatically nor militarily.
What we've witnessed is a process of
leading from behind where the interna
tional community says the right things in
terms of supporting the resistance
against Bashar al Assad, but this rhetoric
has not been coupled with enough practi
cal support.
TSD: What exactly is "practical sup
port?" Military aid?
LK: Practical support early on
in the crisis could have been simply
diplomatic pressure on certain in
ternational actors who were still
supportive of the Assad regime. To
day, unfortunately, the time for a
diplomatic solution, in my opinion,
has passed. Practical help means
both diplomatic pressure and mili
tary support. I don't think the As
sad regime will fall with the current
level of resources. The Assad
regime is much stronger on the
ground you need to tip the bal
ance in favor of the opposition and
one way of doing that is by having
multilateral international military
support.
TSD: Do you think the United
States could lead such a multilat
eral initiative without Russia
and China's backing?
LK: The problem really is main
ly with Russia because Russia re
gards Assad as a key ally. It has not
only sent weapons to support the
Assad's regime but also military
personnel who are manning some
of the anti-aircraft missile bases in
Syria. Part of Russia's motivation
for doing this is geopolitics. Russia
wants to maintain its position vis-a
vis the United States in global poli
tics. But, it is not in Russia's long
term interest to keep supporting a

regime that is definitely falling.
The United States can do more to
reassure Russia regarding its polit
ical reputation in the region but at
the same time to forge a new kind of
relationship with Russia whereby
partnering with the rest of the inter
national community to find a solu
tion for the Syrian crisis. The United
States cannot lead international ac
tion without bringing in Russia and
China onto the same side.
TSD: If the international com
munity decided to act militarily,
what would that mean on the
ground with regards to the grow
ing humanitarian crisis and po
tential terrorist groups who can
take advantage?
LK: Unfortunately, the longer
the crisis is left to simmer as it is,
the more opportunity terrorist
groups have to become more pow
erful and influential in Syria. This
is not helped by the fact that cer
tain actors in the international
community are supporting these
kinds of groups simply because
they are proving themselves to be
ing more viable than other mili
tants fighting the Assad regime.
By sending weapons to nonextrem
ist Syrian rebels, you are not only
able to fight Assad more effectively
but also not allow extremist groups
to become more powerful. I don't
think that the scars of the Iraq War
should be used as an excuse for
non-intervention in Syria.
TSD: How can you be sure the
weapons will reach the right
people?
The way to ensure that the
weapons reach the right people is
to have a clear channel of communi
cation and dissemination that iden
tifies trustworthy, local Syrian
leaders and working with them.
This is certainly doable.
TSD: If a militaiy intervention
were to occur, what would happen
after the regime falls? How much
would the United States be re
sponsible for sorting things out?
LK: It's always difficult when a
regime falls because just because
the regime falls doesn't mean the
crisis ends it's just an important
phase. One always needs to have a
plan for how to handle the chaos that
is inevitable after the fall of any
regime. I am adamant that boots on
the ground in any shape or form is

not the solution we've seen a good
example of that in Iraq whereby the
presence of military troops after the
fall of Saddam did very little to con
tain the violence. We are not looking
for a repeat of that scenario.
I think that Syria is not yet a
lost cause but for this optimism to
stay, action needs to happen very
soon because if it doesn't... Syria is
heading in the direction of sectari
an fragmentation, and if that hap
pens then it will be very difficult for
any entity to contain the potential
violence. For now, there are enough
indicators that there are certain
potential leaders in Syria that
could be called upon along with
the international community, per
haps the United Nations [peace
keeping forces]... [and] local Syri
an leaders in order to prevent the
country from disintegrating.
TSD: Notwithstanding the hu
manitarian needs of Syria, why is
it in United States' best interest
to intervene?
LK: It's because of regional sta
bility in general. Already we are
seeing the Syrian regime start a
new fighting front in the Golan
Heights in collaboration with
Hezbollah. This is the first example
of the kind of regional instability
that could escalate in the future if
this situation is not contained as
soon as possible. Assad is using the
Golan Heights as an excuse to
present himself as the leader of a
resistant regime.
This is a very dangerous situa
tion to be in because Israel is start
ing to feel vulnerable regarding its
security on its border, and we are
seeing the ingredients for a wider
regional war as a result. Already,
the humanitarian crisis in Jordan is
causing the Jordanian regime to
start getting worried about stabili
ty within Jordan as well Turkey
is the same, starting to see clashes
on its border with Syria. All of
these things, if left as they are, are
likely to escalate into regional in
stability that would be a real threat
to United States' interests in the
region as a whole. It is also not in
the United States' best interest to
alienate itself from Arab masses in
the post-Arab Spring era. You need
to gain allies in the region and you
need stability in the region.

Lina Khatib, co-founder of the Pro
gram on Arab Reform and Democracy at
Stanford's Center on Democracy, Devel
opment, and Rule of Law, has been an
outspoken voice in favor of American in
tervention in Syria. Together with Larry
Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, she authored an article last
month in The Atlantic making the case
for greater American and international
involvement. The Daily sat down with
Khatib to further discuss the conflict in
Syria and what might come after.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You said
that you were interested in Syria be
fore the uprisings. What captured your
interest before everyone else started
looking at the country?
Lina Khatib (LK): Before the upris
ing, my work on Syria was mainly about
the struggle between the citizens and the
state. I was interested in finding out
whether any voices of dissent existed
within Syria so I went on fieldwork to ex
amine both state propaganda and ac
tivists. At the time, I came to the conclu
sion that the political space in Syria was
very closed and that the state really had
the upper hand.
TSD: Looking at Syria now, what is
your reaction to everything that is go
ing on, and how the international com
munity has decided to respond?
LK: Because the state in Syria is so
strong and it had succeeded before the
uprising in quelling any kind of opposi
tional political voice within Syria, it has
been very difficult for the Syrian opposi
tion since the start of the uprising to
stand up to the state effectively. I think
this is not surprising because of the lack
of experience in engaging in oppositional
politics. Having said that, the interna
tional community has set the bar too
high for the opposition in terms of ex
pecting the Syrian opposition to be more
sophisticated, to be more united, to have
clear goals it's not realistic to have
these kinds of expectations knowing the
context of Syria.
These kinds of issues have been used
for the past two-and-a-half years or so as
an excuse for the international communi
ty not to intervene in the Syrian crisis
neither diplomatically nor militarily.
What we've witnessed is a process of
leading from behind where the interna
tional community says the right things in
terms of supporting the resistance
against Bashar al Assad, but this rhetoric
has not been coupled with enough practi
cal support.
TSD: What exactly is "practical sup
port?" Military aid?
LK: Practical support early on
in the crisis could have been simply
diplomatic pressure on certain in
ternational actors who were still
supportive of the Assad regime. To
day, unfortunately, the time for a
diplomatic solution, in my opinion,
has passed. Practical help means
both diplomatic pressure and mili
tary support. I don't think the As
sad regime will fall with the current
level of resources. The Assad
regime is much stronger on the
ground you need to tip the bal
ance in favor of the opposition and
one way of doing that is by having
multilateral international military
support.
TSD: Do you think the United
States could lead such a multilat
eral initiative without Russia
and China's backing?
LK: The problem really is main
ly with Russia because Russia re
gards Assad as a key ally. It has not
only sent weapons to support the
Assad's regime but also military
personnel who are manning some
of the anti-aircraft missile bases in
Syria. Part of Russia's motivation
for doing this is geopolitics. Russia
wants to maintain its position vis-a
vis the United States in global poli
tics. But, it is not in Russia's long
term interest to keep supporting a

regime that is definitely falling.
The United States can do more to
reassure Russia regarding its polit
ical reputation in the region but at
the same time to forge a new kind of
relationship with Russia whereby
partnering with the rest of the inter
national community to find a solu
tion for the Syrian crisis. The United
States cannot lead international ac
tion without bringing in Russia and
China onto the same side.
TSD: If the international com
munity decided to act militarily,
what would that mean on the
ground with regards to the grow
ing humanitarian crisis and po
tential terrorist groups who can
take advantage?
LK: Unfortunately, the longer
the crisis is left to simmer as it is,
the more opportunity terrorist
groups have to become more pow
erful and influential in Syria. This
is not helped by the fact that cer
tain actors in the international
community are supporting these
kinds of groups simply because
they are proving themselves to be
ing more viable than other mili
tants fighting the Assad regime.
By sending weapons to nonextrem
ist Syrian rebels, you are not only
able to fight Assad more effectively
but also not allow extremist groups
to become more powerful. I don't
think that the scars of the Iraq War
should be used as an excuse for
non-intervention in Syria.
TSD: How can you be sure the
weapons will reach the right
people?
The way to ensure that the
weapons reach the right people is
to have a clear channel of communi
cation and dissemination that iden
tifies trustworthy, local Syrian
leaders and working with them.
This is certainly doable.
TSD: If a militaiy intervention
were to occur, what would happen
after the regime falls? How much
would the United States be re
sponsible for sorting things out?
LK: It's always difficult when a
regime falls because just because
the regime falls doesn't mean the
crisis ends it's just an important
phase. One always needs to have a
plan for how to handle the chaos that
is inevitable after the fall of any
regime. I am adamant that boots on
the ground in any shape or form is

not the solution we've seen a good
example of that in Iraq whereby the
presence of military troops after the
fall of Saddam did very little to con
tain the violence. We are not looking
for a repeat of that scenario.
I think that Syria is not yet a
lost cause but for this optimism to
stay, action needs to happen very
soon because if it doesn't... Syria is
heading in the direction of sectari
an fragmentation, and if that hap
pens then it will be very difficult for
any entity to contain the potential
violence. For now, there are enough
indicators that there are certain
potential leaders in Syria that
could be called upon along with
the international community, per
haps the United Nations [peace
keeping forces]... [and] local Syri
an leaders in order to prevent the
country from disintegrating.
TSD: Notwithstanding the hu
manitarian needs of Syria, why is
it in United States' best interest
to intervene?
LK: It's because of regional sta
bility in general. Already we are
seeing the Syrian regime start a
new fighting front in the Golan
Heights in collaboration with
Hezbollah. This is the first example
of the kind of regional instability
that could escalate in the future if
this situation is not contained as
soon as possible. Assad is using the
Golan Heights as an excuse to
present himself as the leader of a
resistant regime.
This is a very dangerous situa
tion to be in because Israel is start
ing to feel vulnerable regarding its
security on its border, and we are
seeing the ingredients for a wider
regional war as a result. Already,
the humanitarian crisis in Jordan is
causing the Jordanian regime to
start getting worried about stabili
ty within Jordan as well Turkey
is the same, starting to see clashes
on its border with Syria. All of
these things, if left as they are, are
likely to escalate into regional in
stability that would be a real threat
to United States' interests in the
region as a whole. It is also not in
the United States' best interest to
alienate itself from Arab masses in
the post-Arab Spring era. You need
to gain allies in the region and you
