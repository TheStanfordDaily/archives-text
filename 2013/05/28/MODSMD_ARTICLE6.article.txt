## LINA KHATIB PROGRAM ON ARAB REFORM AND DEMOCRACY 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Lina Khatib, co-founder of the Pro
gram on Arab Reform and Democracy at
Stanford's Center on Democracy, Devel
opment, and Rule of Law, has been an
outspoken voice in favor of American in
tervention in Syria. Together with Larry
Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, she authored an article last
month in The Atlantic making the case
for greater American and international
involvement. The Daily sat down with
Khatib to further discuss the conflict in
Syria and what might come after.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You said
that you were interested in Syria be
fore the uprisings. What captured your
interest before everyone else started
looking at the country?
Lina Khatib (LK): Before the upris
ing, my work on Syria was mainly about
the struggle between the citizens and the
state. I was interested in finding out
whether any voices of dissent existed
within Syria so I went on fieldwork to ex
amine both state propaganda and ac
tivists. At the time, I came to the conclu
sion that the political space in Syria was
very closed and that the state really had
the upper hand.
TSD: Looking at Syria now, what is
your reaction to everything that is go
ing on, and how the international com
munity has decided to respond?
LK: Because the state in Syria is so
strong and it had succeeded before the
uprising in quelling any kind of opposi
tional political voice within Syria, it has
been very difficult for the Syrian opposi
tion since the start of the uprising to
stand up to the state effectively. I think
this is not surprising because of the lack
of experience in engaging in oppositional
politics. Having said that, the interna
tional community has set the bar too
high for the opposition in terms of ex
pecting the Syrian opposition to be more
sophisticated, to be more united, to have
clear goals it's not realistic to have
these kinds of expectations knowing the
context of Syria.
These kinds of issues have been used
for the past two-and-a-half years or so as
an excuse for the international communi
ty not to intervene in the Syrian crisis
neither diplomatically nor militarily.
What we've witnessed is a process of
leading from behind where the interna
tional community says the right things in
terms of supporting the resistance
against Bashar al Assad, but this rhetoric
has not been coupled with enough practi
cal support.
TSD: What exactly is "practical sup
port?" Military aid?
