## Starting to fear football's high expectations 
### Tom Taylor 
I have to admit it's been a good
week. I also have to hold up my
hands and be honest that sports
hasn't really been on my radar
for the last few days, so I hope
you'll forgive me for straying a little bit
from the subject.
On Friday I faced one of the hard
est challenges of my time here at Stan
ford, something that would decide
whether or not I'd leave this place with
another handful of letters to my name
my Ph.D. defense.
Logically, I should have walked in
to that room calm as can be. My aca
demic advisor wouldn't have even let
me think about defending if I wasn't
guaranteed to walk out victorious. But
faced with a panel of six professors
about to unleash all manner of hellish
ly technical questions, I defy anyone
not to feel at least a little bit anxious.
Fortunately, though, it all went
more or less to plan. A couple of hours
later, after being temporarily ushered
out of the room while a decision was
made, my advisor happily informed
me that I'd passed.
I should have been elated, ecstatic,
running crazily around campus in cel
ebration, but my overriding emotion
was just relief. I was happy, sure, but
mostly just relieved.
Because the expectation of success
was so high, passing didn't seem like
anything out of the ordinary
though failure, of course, would have
been catastrophic. That is not to say
that I was guaranteed to pass peo
ple do fail—but the deck was heavily
stacked in my favor. Not only did I get
to schedule the defense only once I felt
ready, but I also got to pick the panel
that would judge me.
Turning my attention back to
sports, all reports so far seem to sug-

gest that next year Stanford football
could be similarly favored. Ranked
perhaps as highly as No. 2 in the pre
season, the Cardinal could be in a po
sition to make a serious run for the na
tional title, while a worst-case-sce
nario consolation Rose Bowl trophy
should be guaranteed. Right?
I can't be the only ex-student —or
soon-to-be ex-student —who has al
ready thought about this, who has at
least tentatively ensured that they
have no major conflicts scheduled for
early next January and perhaps has
mentioned to Mends who will still be
students to keep them in mind for any
spare tickets.
How quickly we've moved on. Just
a few short years ago, even the
thought of BCS bowl defeat would
have been a dream. Now, at or near
the height of its powers, we fans de
mand far more of Stanford football.
Anything less than an appearance in
Pasadena next January—the site of
both the Rose Bowl Game and BCS
National Championship Game next
year —would be a gut-wrenching
failure.
The expectation for success is
now so high, not just because the
football program in general has
raised its stature and ability to re
cruit new talent, but because it is also
returning so many key players from
last year's defensive line. It also faces
an impressive end-of-season run-in

that, should the Cardinal go undefeat
ed, will guarantee the sort of national
respect usually reserved exclusively
for SEC teams. Perhaps rising junior
Kevin Hogan isn't Andrew Luck 'l2,
perhaps head coach David Shaw isn't
Jim Harbaugh; perhaps none of that
matters. The deck is stacked, or at
least as stacked as it's ever going to be
for this little non-football school.
But knowing all of that, how on
earth are we expected to enjoy next
year?
One day soon probably far
sooner than we'd like—the tables will
be turned. Our nemesis from across
the Bay will get some payback, those
schools down in SoCal will eventually
break their curse, and then there is
that burning yeflow-on-green Eye of
Sauron glaring menacingly down at
us from the North.
The aim for next year isn't to go
out and surprise people by winning
contests. Stanford isn't expected to
win but to find some way not to lose a
single one —the Cardinal is expect
ed to win them all, at least until the
end of the regular season. It will be a
game of survival as all the many
Davids try and take down this Go
liath.
And if it escapes to the National
Championship Game unscathed, my
overriding emotion will be relief.

Stanford football has survived the
loss of Toby Gerhart, Jim Harbaugh
and Andrew Luck, but can it survive
the departure of Tom Taylor? Try to
