# NCAAS NEXT FOR TRACK-12
## CARTER LEADS CARD TO EUGENE 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford track and field team sent
35 athletes to Austin, Texas for the NCAA
West Preliminary round last weekend, and
just over a third of them will continue on to
the NCAA Championships on June 5-8 in
Eugene, Ore. The meet was plagued by
weather issues that continually delayed
competition, but ultimately nine Cardinal
women and three men earned top-12 finish
es and a subsequent berth at nationals.
Stanford brought the largest group of
women to regionals with 22 competitors
overall. Nine of those athletes qualified for
nationals, led by junior Kori Carter who
will compete in three different events in
Eugene.
The junior, who currently owns the
third-fastest 400-meter hurdle time (54.21)
in the world this year, won the 400-meter
hurdle race with a time of 54.50. Carter also
took seventh place in the 100-meter hurdles
(13.16) and anchored the 4x400 relay team,
which captured eighth place overall.
The relay group, which included seniors
Justine Fedronic and Carissa Levingston
and freshman Amy Weissenbach turned in
the fastest time (3:32.65) since 2005 for a
Stanford 4x400.
Both Fedronic and Weissenbach earned
an individual spot at the NCAA Champi
onships in the 800-meter race, one of the
Cardinal's strongest events.
Fedronic, a two-time All-American, fin
ished second overall (2:04.5) after winning
her heat, while Weissenbach was fifth over
all (2:04.97). Freshman Claudia Saunders
set a personal record (2:06.96) in the event
and advanced to the final round, but finished
out of the running for a spot at nationals.
