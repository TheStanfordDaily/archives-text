# NCAAS NEXT FOR TRACK-12
## CARTER LEADS CARD TO EUGENE 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford track and field team sent
35 athletes to Austin, Texas for the NCAA
West Preliminary round last weekend, and
just over a third of them will continue on to
the NCAA Championships on June 5-8 in
Eugene, Ore. The meet was plagued by
weather issues that continually delayed
competition, but ultimately nine Cardinal
women and three men earned top-12 finish
es and a subsequent berth at nationals.
Stanford brought the largest group of
women to regionals with 22 competitors
overall. Nine of those athletes qualified for
nationals, led by junior Kori Carter who
will compete in three different events in
Eugene.
The junior, who currently owns the
third-fastest 400-meter hurdle time (54.21)
in the world this year, won the 400-meter
hurdle race with a time of 54.50. Carter also
took seventh place in the 100-meter hurdles
(13.16) and anchored the 4x400 relay team,
which captured eighth place overall.
The relay group, which included seniors
Justine Fedronic and Carissa Levingston
and freshman Amy Weissenbach turned in
the fastest time (3:32.65) since 2005 for a
Stanford 4x400.
Both Fedronic and Weissenbach earned
an individual spot at the NCAA Champi
onships in the 800-meter race, one of the
Cardinal's strongest events.
Fedronic, a two-time All-American, fin
ished second overall (2:04.5) after winning
her heat, while Weissenbach was fifth over
all (2:04.97). Freshman Claudia Saunders
set a personal record (2:06.96) in the event
and advanced to the final round, but finished
out of the running for a spot at nationals.

Stanford junior Kori Carter (front) will compete in three events at next week's NCAAs in
Eugene, Ore. Carter will race in the 100- and 400-meter hurdles and the 4x400-meter relay.
In the javelin, Brianna Bain
performed up to expectations by
capturing the top spot with a throw
of 175-10. The sophomore is the
reigning Pac-12 champion in the
event and will be looking to im
prove on her runner-up finish at
nationals last year.
Senior Alyssa Wisdom was able
to extend her career by just the
slimmest of margins after earning
the 12th and final qualifying spot in
the shot put (53-1). Wisdom was
originally a sprinter when she ar
rived at Stanford but was forced to
switch to shot because of health
reasons. The senior advanced to
the 2013 NCAA indoor champi
onships where she failed to reg
ister a legal throw but has never
previously competed in NCAA out
door nationals.
Fellow senior Karynn Dunn also
made the most of what could have
been the final competition of her
career by qualifying for the NCAA
championships in the long jump.

Dunn, a two-time first team All-
American, jumped 20-7 1/4 to take
seventh place.
The other two Cardinal women
who advanced to the champi
onships did so in the 5,000-meter
race. Sophomore Aisling Cuffe
(16:15.53) and junior Jessica Tonn
(16:21.21) took sixth and eighth
place respectively to give Stanford
a formidable duo in the event at na
tionals.
The men's team was less suc
cessful, with just three athletes
earning a trip to Eugene.
In the 1,500-meter race, only
half of the Cardinal's 1-2 punch
made it through qualification. Sen
ior Tyler Stutzman finished eighth
overall in the event with a time of
3:49.8, but teammate Michael
Atchoo failed to qualify.
Atchoo, a junior, had been
ranked the No. 3 collegian in the
event coming into the meet, but
ended up 12th in his heat with a
time of 3:50.38, more than 10 sec
onds off his personal record.
Also disappointed were seniors
Jules Sharpe and Geoffrey Tabor.
Both athletes have previously won
Ail-American honors but ended
their careers in regionals this year.

In the high jump, Sharpe took 17th
with a jump of 6-111/2 while Tabor
took 20th in the discus (175-11) and
37th in the shot put (53-3 3/4).
Junior Erik Olson claimed his
first career berth in NCAA cham
pionships by earning 12th place
overall in the 5,000-meter race
(13:53.68).
Freshman Steven Solomon will
round out the men's contingent in
Eugene after taking 10th place in
the 400-meter race (46.59).
Solomon reached the final in the
400 meters at the 2012 Olympics,
where he competed for Australia,
but has struggled with injury at
Stanford. Nationals will be just his
fourth competition this season.
At nationals, all athletes will
earn ail-American status if they
legally compete in their respective
events. The Championships will be
gin on June 5 in Eugene, Ore.
