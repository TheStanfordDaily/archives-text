## OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD Advice From a Nostalgic Columnist 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
It's the last column of the year.
Bittersweet, I must admit.
There are many things I would
like to say in this column, the first of
which is thank you. To those of you
who read consistently, thank you for
your time and attention. To those of
you who left nasty comments, thank
you for keeping me from getting
overconfident. To the asshole who
slammed a door in my face fall
quarter, thank you for giving me
some great content to write about.
To everyone whose overheard
words inspired me, thank you for
doing just that: inspiring me and of
ten making me smile.
It's all the same story if you look
through my columns. I won't pre
tend otherwise. It goes something
like this:
Be curious. When you start to
feel judgmental, check yourself, and
see if you can't replace that judg
ment with curiosity. Get curious
about the people around you, about
the subjects you study, and espe
cially about your own growth.
Be kinder to yourself. This place
can chew you up and spit you out, if
you let it. Let go of the perfectionist
impulse. Resist the disease to
please. When you get stuck in an
endless self-improvement spiral, let
up on the self-criticism. When you
wind yourself up into an "I'm not
good enough" frenzy, cut yourself
some slack.
Go out of your way. Make time
for the people you love make
them your priority. Make somebody
else the center of your universe,
even just for thirty minutes. It's a
nice break from your own anxiety.
Appreciate each other. Lately,
this one has been nagging at me es
pecially. My burnout has almost
reached critical mass and most days
it seems like the quarter can't end
soon enough. But there's another
force tugging me in a different di
rection, where I don't want the
quarter to end because I'm not
ready for everyone to scatter in a
million different directions in an in
stant. Every quarter, every year,

the rhythm of Stanford changes
drastically. I try to hang onto all of
the people in my life and keep them
in whatever current niche they fill.
Instead, people come and people go,
occupying first one niche and then
another, and sometimes disappear
ing altogether.
I still haven't come to terms with
this fluidity. I'm too attached to peo
ple, I guess. If I can't change the
way everyone scatters to the winds,
I can at least make a more concert
ed effort to appreciate them while
we're all in one place. Don't let the
stress of whatever you have to get
done for finals occlude how precious
your relationships are. Sappy, I
know, but I think it's an important
reminder.
That's about it. I wish I had a
more profound realization at the
end here, but I don't. So, good luck
with finals. Make noise, have fun
thank you for reading.

This is Renee's last column but
it doesn't have to be the last time
you email her! She'd love to hear
feedback from, her readers at rdono
van@ Stanford, edu.
