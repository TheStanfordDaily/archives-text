# Making a Student, Losing an Artist
## 
### Uttara Sivaram 
A couple days ago, I watched a
TED talk from 2006 by one Sir
Ken Robinson. It was titled
"Do schools kill creativity?" It was a
simple talk there were no slides,
no displays, no music indeed, the
only real action I observed during the
talk occurred when Robinson but
toned and then unbuttoned his suit.
So yes, it wasn't the most dynamic
speech I had ever seen. But it was,
without doubt, one of the best presen
tations I had ever attended (albeit
dressed in pajamas, in my bed and on
my laptop).
The problem I keep running into
after I see a good TED talk is that I
immediately feel like writing a col
umn about the exact same subject. I
think of it as inspiration. Everyone
else seems to consider it plagiarism.
So I have to be really careful with
how I funnel the intense emotional
and often physical excitement that
follow good talks, since for the most
part, these presentations are a mere
snapshot into the work and research
that today's great minds have com
pleted. For example, after watching

Bryan Stevenson's talk on incarcera
tion and injustice, I got to work right
away, writing a passionate piece
about justice in the legal system. A
couple of paragraphs in, I realized I
had no idea what I was talking about,
save for a short personal anecdote
about a seventh-grade fieldtrip to the
local penitentiary and my love for
Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
But I must say, Robinson's talk
most touched on a subject that until
recently, I didn't quite know how to
address. It eloquently described what
I've noticed to be a slow leakage of
creativity that seems to accompany
kids in every additional year of
schooling since their elementary
days.
Now, I know it's a dangerous, pre
sumptuous thing to generalize a per
sonal experience to an entire phe
nomenon. But on the off chance that
someone else has experienced the
same, niggling little concern that they
are slowly losing their edge to some
unseen force, I'll offer some personal
insight into the matter.
A few minutes into the talk,

Robinson told the story of a little girl
who was drawing a picture in class.
Her teacher asked her, "What are
you drawing?" to which the girl an
swered, "I'm drawing a picture of
God." The teacher responded, "But
nobody knows what God looks like!"
And the girl said, "Well, they will in a
minute."
As a kid, I would often say and do
these kind of off-colored, unintention
ally funny things in front of my teach
ers and parents, who in turn would
refer me to school counselors and
suggest moving me to more special
ized schools. In fact, after I got into
some seiious trouble twice (once for
releasing my secret bug collection in
class and again for chucking a girl's
backpack, clothes, and shoes on the
roof during EE.), I was actually
moved to another school.
"We stigmatize mistakes," Robin
son declared, in his quiet, yet ringing
British accent. "We are educating
people out of their creative capaci
ties." Now, I don't know if Robinson
was quite talking about my particular
brand of creativity (which was tem
porarily labeled, in turn, as variants
of ADHD, neuroticism, introversion,
mild autism and severe idiocy until
the seventh grade). But if I could add
one positive trait to the list above, it
would be "fearlessness." I was utter
ly unafraid of making mistakes, both
socially and academically.
I grew out of my more rebellious
phase roughly around the age of 13.
This is when I began to write short
stories, long stories, news stories,
non-fiction accounts, science journals,
etc. I don't think they were necessar
ily any good, but I wrote them any
way, since there isn't much to do in
middle school other than sticking
gum to the underside of desks and
avoiding EE. I was still very different
and still academically ambiguous. But
I was the kid who believed she would
be famous someday and teach the
kids who had once locked her in stair
wells that she actually was a genius,
not just a weirdo.
Robinson quoted Ficasso as say
ing, "All children are born artists. The
problem is remaining an artist as we
grow up." Unfortunately, after two
years here at Stanford, I don't think
I'm quite a match for this problem. I
am a psychology major with an eco
nomics minor. I've learned about risk
aversion and game theory from so
many different angles that it's impos
sible not to think about each decision
in terms of my next decision, and the
one after that, and the 10 after that.
And I can't afford not to. I can't re
member the last time I took a bigger
risk than choosing a different route to
get to my I:lspm lecture in the quad
(and even that made my heart beat a
little quicker).
I have the next and last two year's
at Stanford on an Excel spreadsheet.
It's actually open right now in anoth
er window, but I don't think I have the
guts to make any major revisions at
this point. So I'll graduate soon with
an impressive Bachelor's and a ring,
if I can afford it a disappointment
to Ficasso and a disappointment to
my 7th grade self, a girl who truly,
earnestly believed in the importance
of her own creativity.
It's a sad note to end on. And like
most of my other columns, I don't
know if I have a real resolution, or
any kind of satisfying denouement.
Perhaps this is because I'm not sure
which episode, during my educational
series, triggered the decline in my
willingness to take risks. It might
have been when all my friends made
a fad out of taking AP chemistry, or
when I realized that writing short sto
ries (and columns) is so pitifully un
profitable. But I do know that as I've
grown up, become more socially ac
ceptable, and gotten smarter, I've
grown out of myself and more into
the institutions I am surrounded by.
Like everything else in life, it's give
and-take. But I'm afraid I've given up
far more than what I've taken.
In conclusion, I'll offer one of
those grand, sweeping, presidential
recommendations, which serves
nothing more than to annoy the heck
out of everyone. Our education sys
tem ought to stop prioritizing order
over individuality. Indeed, today's
schools have quite efficiently hierar
chized classes and subjects, such that
the routes students take through get
ting an education have become in
creasingly less diverse. Don't get me
wrong; maintaining structure in the
education system is essential for
learning building upon students'

knowledge requires a firm teaching
infrastructure. But it must also allow
for a certain degree of flexibility for
the vast array of teaching styles,
learning capabilities, personalities
and talents.
Many students are doing some
fantastic things here. Some really are
artists, and not just juvenile delin
quents. But I'd like to emphasize to
those who don't yet have their four
year Excel spreadsheet locked into
place that this is a time, more than
any other, to reclaim whatever cre
ativity was lost thus far. And I'm not
just talking about taking that strange
Chinese acupuncture class for three
units. I'm talking about taking risks
that might change your life, for bet
ter or for worse.
Because, and I hope Robinson
would agree, I think that is what be
ing an artist really means.
