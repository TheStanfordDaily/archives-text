# Draw results elicit mixed student reactions
## Record number miss out in first round 
### MOLLY VORWERCK DESK EDITOR 
Though Stanford undergradu
ates are guaranteed housing for all
four years of their education, an un
precedented number of students
have emerged from the 2013-14
Draw homeless, if only until they
receive a waitlist assignment.
Richard Tai 'l5 and his draw
group were at the Treehouse last
Wednesday when results were
released. After receiving the
email notification, Tai and his
friends opened the message to
find that they currently did not have
housing.
"I couldn't believe it was that
bad," Tai said.
After processing the email, Tai
turned to poking fun at his "home
lessness."
"I think... I wanted to make
something good come out of a real
ly crappy situation," he said. "I try
to find the funnier things in life,
and I [thought] this could be pretty
funny."
In the image, Tai, grasping a
sign that states "Draw # 2926 Will
Code for Housing," leans despon
dent against a bollard, gazing into
the distance. Although Tai acknowl
edged that he and his draw mates
would eventually find housing, he
sees no fault in making light of his
current situation.
"[The picture] was me trying to
cope with the fact that I didn't have
housing," he said. "I thought, 'l'm
kind of homeless right now, let's
play with that.'"
Positive levity
While Tai and other similarly
unfortunate students remain in the
dark on where they will live next
year, students like Kennan Mur
phy-Sierra 'l4 made light of their
spot at the other end of the Draw.
Poking fun at the wave of his
peers who posted glowing or frus
trated statuses on Facebook after
learning their future residences,
Sierra-Murphy jokingly posted

that he was placed in Robinson,
conventionally a Tier 3 option, with
his Tier 1 draw number.
"Everyone tries to post on Face
book, "Oh I won the Draw!" or "Oh,
my life sucks," [after finding out
their housing assignment]," he said.
"[I thought], well, what if I just post
a total troll that's so trolly that peo
ple will have to know that it was not
real."
Although some of his friends un
derstood the irony, others were left
perplexed at his apparently poor
decision-making.
"A lot of people thought [my sta
tus] was real because Robinson is
typically something that goes Tier
3," he said. "It's really funny be
cause one of my friends came up to
me and was like 'Wow, I totally lost
respect for your intelligence.'"
Whether or not his "trolling"
was successful, Murphy-Sierra was
ultimately happy with his future
residence La Maison Frangaise.
Number one
Mark Ulrich 'l4 and his draw
mate Hoa Mai 'l4 were set apart
from their fellow students by re
ceiving the lowest number in the
entire process one.
Despite considering himself a
lucky person, Ulrich said that he
was still taken aback when he dis
cerned that he and Mai had re
ceived the first number in the draw.
"I really didn't believe that it
was happening," he said. "You
know at first you see 808 Premier
and you understand what that
means and you're happy, but you
glance back a little bit later, and
you see the number one and at first
you're like 'That's probably the tier
number, right?"'
Mai, who had experienced bad
luck in previous years with Tiers 2
and 3, was convinced that her last
draw experience would fare no bet
ter. Still, after much persuasion,
Ulrich convinced her to draw with
him.
"What you have to understand
is that my friend Hoa Mai had a se

ries of disastrous draws and she
was not happy with the entire
process," he said. "But I told her,
'no we're drawing together I
have really good luck so don't wor
ry about it.'"
Mai was so nervous when the
results were emailed that she
forced Ulrich to wait until they
could open the email together, a
good three hours after the message
was sent. And unlike Tai and his
fellow "homeless" peers, Ulrich
and Mai had something to cele
brate.
"She was so sure there would be
bad news, [and] I was so sure there
would be good news," he said. "[Af
ter opening the email] we had a lit
tle celebration that we were getting
into 808 Premiere, but then we
looked at it more carefully and real
ized we were draw number one."

"I couldn't believe it was that
bad," Tai said.
After processing the email, Tai
turned to poking fun at his "home
lessness."
"I think... I wanted to make
something good come out of a real
ly crappy situation," he said. "I try
to find the funnier things in life,
and I [thought] this could be pretty
funny."
In the image, Tai, grasping a
sign that states "Draw # 2926 Will
Code for Housing," leans despon
dent against a bollard, gazing into
the distance. Although Tai acknowl
edged that he and his draw mates
would eventually find housing, he
sees no fault in making light of his
current situation.
"[The picture] was me trying to
cope with the fact that I didn't have
housing," he said. "I thought, 'l'm
kind of homeless right now, let's
play with that.'"
Positive levity
While Tai and other similarly
unfortunate students remain in the
dark on where they will live next
year, students like Kennan Mur
phy-Sierra 'l4 made light of their
spot at the other end of the Draw.
Poking fun at the wave of his
peers who posted glowing or frus
trated statuses on Facebook after
learning their future residences,
Sierra-Murphy jokingly posted

that he was placed in Robinson,
conventionally a Tier 3 option, with
his Tier 1 draw number.
"Everyone tries to post on Face
book, "Oh I won the Draw!" or "Oh,
my life sucks," [after finding out
their housing assignment]," he said.
"[I thought], well, what if I just post
a total troll that's so trolly that peo
ple will have to know that it was not
real."
Although some of his friends un
derstood the irony, others were left
perplexed at his apparently poor
decision-making.
"A lot of people thought [my sta
tus] was real because Robinson is
typically something that goes Tier
3," he said. "It's really funny be
cause one of my friends came up to
me and was like 'Wow, I totally lost
respect for your intelligence.'"
Whether or not his "trolling"
was successful, Murphy-Sierra was
ultimately happy with his future
residence La Maison Frangaise.
Number one
Mark Ulrich 'l4 and his draw
mate Hoa Mai 'l4 were set apart
from their fellow students by re
ceiving the lowest number in the
entire process one.
Despite considering himself a
lucky person, Ulrich said that he
was still taken aback when he dis
cerned that he and Mai had re
ceived the first number in the draw.
"I really didn't believe that it
was happening," he said. "You
know at first you see 808 Premier
and you understand what that
means and you're happy, but you
glance back a little bit later, and
you see the number one and at first
you're like 'That's probably the tier
number, right?"'
Mai, who had experienced bad
luck in previous years with Tiers 2
and 3, was convinced that her last
draw experience would fare no bet
ter. Still, after much persuasion,
Ulrich convinced her to draw with
him.
"What you have to understand
is that my friend Hoa Mai had a se

ries of disastrous draws and she
was not happy with the entire
process," he said. "But I told her,
'no we're drawing together I
have really good luck so don't wor
ry about it.'"
Mai was so nervous when the
results were emailed that she
forced Ulrich to wait until they
could open the email together, a
good three hours after the message
was sent. And unlike Tai and his
fellow "homeless" peers, Ulrich
and Mai had something to cele
brate.
"She was so sure there would be
bad news, [and] I was so sure there
would be good news," he said. "[Af
ter opening the email] we had a lit
tle celebration that we were getting
into 808 Premiere, but then we
looked at it more carefully and real
ized we were draw number one."
