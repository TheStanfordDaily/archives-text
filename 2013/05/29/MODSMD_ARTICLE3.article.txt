## RYAN CROCKER SIX-TIME U.S. AMBASSADOR 
### DANNY GIFFORD DESK EDITOR 
Ryan Crocker is a six-time
U.S. Ambassador, serving in
Afghanistan (2011-2012), Iraq
(2007-2009), Pakistan (2004-
2007), Syria (1998-2001), Kuwait
(1994-1997) and Lebanon (1990-
1993). While at Stanford for a
lecture organized by the Abbasi
Program in Islamic Studies,
Crocker sat down with The Daily
to discuss his diplomatic career
through war and peace.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You
majored in English literature
in college. How does that lead
to a career in diplomacy?
Ryan Crocker (RC): English
literature is a dream as a major
because, in addition to learning
the great works, it teaches you to
think very broadly, to look be
yond the obvious, to capture hid
den meanings. All of this is great
preparation for life and, indeed,
the Foreign Service, where we
live in a world of nuance and un
certainty.
TSD: Did you always know you
were a diplomat?
RC: No. I grew up in an air
force family and spent my young
life living around the world with
my parents [l] graduated
from high school in Turkey, for
example ... My senior year [of
college] I took the Foreign Serv
ice exam, I applied to graduate

school overseas, I applied for the
Peace Corps, I talked to military
recruiters anything that was
going to get me launched into the
world of international affairs.
TSD: You've served in mul
tiple foreign policy crises.
What draws you to war zones?
RC: My first experience in a
war zone was a very long time
ago, as a political counselor in the
American embassy in Beirut,
Lebanon, [from] 1981 t01984.
TSD: Did you witness the
Beirut [barracks] bombing?
RC: I did indeed discover the
massacre ... I discovered that I
could function under these kinds
of [crisis] circumstances, and
diplomacy has the most impor
tance in the most dangerous
places. These things become lit
erally matters of life and death.
TSD: Can you describe what
the bombing was like?
RC: I thought I had taken a
direct hit from something like a
rocket-propelled grenade —[l
had] no idea of the magnitude of
the attack. We didn't know that
until I walked out of my office
and instead of looking at the
suite of offices that was facing
me across the large common
space, I was looking straight up
into the Mediterranean Sea be
cause the whole side of the build-
ing had been sheared off.
TSD: What are some of
your proudest accomplish
ments of your time in of
fice?
RC: I think just looking
at the latter years, the suc
cess we had in turning the
tide of civil war in Iraq in 2007
was a pretty important
achievement. Of course our
troops on the ground were
the ones who fought for that
relative stability, but diploma
cy had a lot to do with it too.
I was lead negotiator for a
truly historic agreement, a
strategic framework agree
ment, between the United
States and Iraq that makes
us allies for years to come
[a] relationship we've never

had with Iraq. So succeeding
in that negotiation meant a
lot to me. Of course [we] had
a very similar opportunity in
Afghanistan, where we con
cluded a strategic partner
ship agreement that Presi
dent Obama traveled to
Kabul a year ago to sign with
President Karzai.
TSD: You've served six dif
ferent administrations.
How have you worked with
different presidents and
avoided the partisan ten
sions of today's politics?
RC: Well, it's a source of
some pride to me that I've
served as an ambassador six
times. I did so three times
under Republican presi
dents and three times under
Democratic presidents. It's
hard to be more evenhanded
or middle of the road than
that. We are professionals
we are not elected officials.
It's quite a responsibility to

make recommendations on
policy In the case of Iraq, I
gave my best judgment. The
decision was made to go ahead
with the invasion, and I never
gave it a second thought. I
stood up, I saluted, and I was
out in Iraq just weeks after
the fall of Baghdad.
TSD: What's one thing a
career in war zones taught
you?
RC: [Crisis] gives you
perspective. What's a bad
day? Is a bad day [one] in
which your car doesn't start,
or in which a day a mob de
stroys your home? [My ex
perience] taught me not [to]
sweat the small stuff, in that
almost everything is small
stuff.

college] I took the Foreign Serv
ice exam, I applied to graduate

school overseas, I applied for the
Peace Corps, I talked to military
recruiters anything that was
going to get me launched into the
world of international affairs.
TSD: You've served in mul
tiple foreign policy crises.
What draws you to war zones?
RC: My first experience in a
war zone was a very long time
ago, as a political counselor in the
American embassy in Beirut,
Lebanon, [from] 1981 t01984.
TSD: Did you witness the
Beirut [barracks] bombing?
RC: I did indeed discover the
massacre ... I discovered that I
could function under these kinds
of [crisis] circumstances, and
diplomacy has the most impor
tance in the most dangerous
places. These things become lit
erally matters of life and death.
TSD: Can you describe what
the bombing was like?
RC: I thought I had taken a
direct hit from something like a
rocket-propelled grenade —[l
had] no idea of the magnitude of
the attack. We didn't know that
until I walked out of my office
and instead of looking at the
suite of offices that was facing
me across the large common
space, I was looking straight up
into the Mediterranean Sea be
cause the whole side of the build-
ing had been sheared off.
TSD: What are some of
your proudest accomplish
ments of your time in of
fice?
RC: I think just looking
at the latter years, the suc
cess we had in turning the
tide of civil war in Iraq in 2007
was a pretty important
achievement. Of course our
troops on the ground were
the ones who fought for that
relative stability, but diploma
cy had a lot to do with it too.
I was lead negotiator for a
truly historic agreement, a
strategic framework agree
ment, between the United
States and Iraq that makes
us allies for years to come
[a] relationship we've never

had with Iraq. So succeeding
in that negotiation meant a
lot to me. Of course [we] had
a very similar opportunity in
Afghanistan, where we con
cluded a strategic partner
ship agreement that Presi
dent Obama traveled to
Kabul a year ago to sign with
President Karzai.
TSD: You've served six dif
ferent administrations.
How have you worked with
different presidents and
avoided the partisan ten
sions of today's politics?
RC: Well, it's a source of
some pride to me that I've
served as an ambassador six
times. I did so three times
under Republican presi
dents and three times under
Democratic presidents. It's
hard to be more evenhanded
or middle of the road than
that. We are professionals
we are not elected officials.
It's quite a responsibility to

make recommendations on
policy In the case of Iraq, I
gave my best judgment. The
decision was made to go ahead
with the invasion, and I never
gave it a second thought. I
stood up, I saluted, and I was
out in Iraq just weeks after
the fall of Baghdad.
TSD: What's one thing a
career in war zones taught
you?
RC: [Crisis] gives you
perspective. What's a bad
day? Is a bad day [one] in
which your car doesn't start,
or in which a day a mob de
stroys your home? [My ex
perience] taught me not [to]
sweat the small stuff, in that
almost everything is small
stuff.
