## RYAN CROCKER SIX-TIME U.S. AMBASSADOR 
### DANNY GIFFORD DESK EDITOR 
Ryan Crocker is a six-time
U.S. Ambassador, serving in
Afghanistan (2011-2012), Iraq
(2007-2009), Pakistan (2004-
2007), Syria (1998-2001), Kuwait
(1994-1997) and Lebanon (1990-
1993). While at Stanford for a
lecture organized by the Abbasi
Program in Islamic Studies,
Crocker sat down with The Daily
to discuss his diplomatic career
through war and peace.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You
majored in English literature
in college. How does that lead
to a career in diplomacy?
Ryan Crocker (RC): English
literature is a dream as a major
because, in addition to learning
the great works, it teaches you to
think very broadly, to look be
yond the obvious, to capture hid
den meanings. All of this is great
preparation for life and, indeed,
the Foreign Service, where we
live in a world of nuance and un
certainty.
TSD: Did you always know you
were a diplomat?
RC: No. I grew up in an air
force family and spent my young
life living around the world with
my parents [l] graduated
from high school in Turkey, for

college] I took the Foreign Serv

Peace Corps, I talked to military
recruiters anything that was
going to get me launched into the
world of international affairs.
TSD: You've served in mul

What draws you to war zones?
RC: My first experience in a
war zone was a very long time
ago, as a political counselor in the
American embassy in Beirut,
Lebanon, [from] 1981 t01984.
TSD: Did you witness the
Beirut [barracks] bombing?
RC: I did indeed discover the
massacre ... I discovered that I
could function under these kinds
of [crisis] circumstances, and
diplomacy has the most impor
tance in the most dangerous
places. These things become lit
erally matters of life and death.
TSD: Can you describe what
the bombing was like?
RC: I thought I had taken a
direct hit from something like a
rocket-propelled grenade â€”[l
had] no idea of the magnitude of
the attack. We didn't know that
until I walked out of my office
and instead of looking at the
suite of offices that was facing
me across the large common
space, I was looking straight up
into the Mediterranean Sea be
cause the whole side of the build-
