# TECHNOLOGY
## Lab seeks to de-stress technology Calming Technology Lab reflects interdisciplinary work 
### BRITTANY TORREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While technological devices like
cell phones and laptops are übiqui
tous in Silicon Valley, they can cre
ate stress for frequent users a
problem that the members of Stan
ford's Calming Technology Lab
(CTL) are currently working to
solve.
According to CTL Director
Neema Moraveji Ph.D. 'l2, the lab's
purpose is to "invent, study and im
plement technologies" that can in
duce calm in at least one of three ar
eas cognition, emotion and phys
iology.
The students and faculty who
work at the lab run experiments on
technology use that range from
simulating the calming presence of
nature through high-resolution im

ages to tracking the way people
breathe while using a computer.
"We've found that just using a
computer activates the fight or
flight response," Moraveji said. "So
just by using the computer all day,
it's kind of tiring."
Moraveji created the lab in De
cember 2010 while working on his
dissertation about human-computer
interactions at the Graduate School
of Education. As part of his disser
tation, Moraveji designed Breath
wear, a sensor that tracks breathing
patterns and can notify the user
through a mobile device when he or
she is becoming stressed.
"I dropped everything when I
realized that what I really wanted
to do was change the way the world
breathes," Moraveji said.
Breathwear, which Moraveji ex
pects will be available on the com
mercial market in late 2013 or early
2014, is one of about a dozen proj
ects that the CTL has created or is
in the process of designing.

The lab's other projects include
MailO, a calming email client that
monitors email checking habits to
help the user reach an empty inbox
at the end of each day, and Mor
phine Drip, which helps athletes
manage pain and stress through
SMS mechanisms.
Mahmoud Saadat M.S. 'O9 Ph.D.
'l7, a hardware designer for CTL,
noted that the lab's product devel
opment process often involves
brainstorming sessions and de
scribed the researchers' discussions
in the preliminary stages of MailO
as particularly interesting.
"They talked about [email] and
how we can redesign it in a calm
way, to reduce the stress and lever
age a very good user interface to
have a calm environment for users,"
Saadat said.
Researchers and designers at
the lab represent a variety of disci
plines, including computer science,
mechanical engineering,
psychology and symbolic
systems. Moraveji described
that diversity as crucial to
the lab's success.
"I think the reason that
we're able to create this lab
is because it's not just an
idea that I like," Moraveji
said. "It's an idea that is res
onating with a lot of differ
ent people."
The CTL has also collab
orated with students in the
Hasso Plattner Institute of
Design (d.school) through a
class called d.compress: De
signing Calm, where stu
dents can work with compa
nies to improve their current
products and design new
forms of calming technology.
"We study how technolo

gy creates stress for us,"
Moraveji said. "We do calm
ing exercises as part of the
class, we meditate in class
it's part of the design
process."
One of the challenges
that students in the course
tackled was how to reduce
the stress associated with
using Gmail, as CTL Lead
Strategist Stephanie Habif
noted that the information
overload created by email
can be "a big problem."
"To be able to evolve the
domain of calming technolo
gy is really special and a
wonderful opportunity that
we're really grateful for,"
Habif said. "It seems like the
right place to do the work."
According to Moraveji,
enrollment in the class dou
bled from last year, with
more students taking an in
terest in both developing
and using calming tech
nologies.

"The further along socie
ty evolves, the more ac
knowledgement there is for
... [the idea that] it's not al
ways [true] that more is bet
ter," Moraveji said. "Tech
nology's not disappearing, so
we need to do something
else. Sometimes you have to
create new technology."
Moraveji predicted that
future product designers will
begin to consider how their
technology can affect a user
emotionally or cognitively,
an approach largely missing
from the market today.
"Now there's a value put
in place on how that [tech
nology] makes me feel, how
that technology makes me
perform better, love better
and build better friendships
and a deeper life and more
meaningful life," Moraveji
said.

brainstorming sessions and de
scribed the researchers' discussions
in the preliminary stages of MailO
as particularly interesting.
"They talked about [email] and
how we can redesign it in a calm
way, to reduce the stress and lever
age a very good user interface to
have a calm environment for users,"
Saadat said.
Researchers and designers at
the lab represent a variety of disci
plines, including computer science,
mechanical engineering,
psychology and symbolic
systems. Moraveji described
that diversity as crucial to
the lab's success.
"I think the reason that
we're able to create this lab
is because it's not just an
idea that I like," Moraveji
said. "It's an idea that is res
onating with a lot of differ
ent people."
The CTL has also collab
orated with students in the
Hasso Plattner Institute of
Design (d.school) through a
class called d.compress: De
signing Calm, where stu
dents can work with compa
nies to improve their current
products and design new
forms of calming technology.
"We study how technolo

gy creates stress for us,"
Moraveji said. "We do calm
ing exercises as part of the
class, we meditate in class
it's part of the design
process."
One of the challenges
that students in the course
tackled was how to reduce
the stress associated with
using Gmail, as CTL Lead
Strategist Stephanie Habif
noted that the information
overload created by email
can be "a big problem."
"To be able to evolve the
domain of calming technolo
gy is really special and a
wonderful opportunity that
we're really grateful for,"
Habif said. "It seems like the
right place to do the work."
According to Moraveji,
enrollment in the class dou
bled from last year, with
more students taking an in
terest in both developing
and using calming tech
nologies.

"The further along socie
ty evolves, the more ac
knowledgement there is for
... [the idea that] it's not al
ways [true] that more is bet
ter," Moraveji said. "Tech
nology's not disappearing, so
we need to do something
else. Sometimes you have to
create new technology."
Moraveji predicted that
future product designers will
begin to consider how their
technology can affect a user
emotionally or cognitively,
an approach largely missing
from the market today.
"Now there's a value put
in place on how that [tech
nology] makes me feel, how
that technology makes me
perform better, love better
and build better friendships
and a deeper life and more
meaningful life," Moraveji
said.
