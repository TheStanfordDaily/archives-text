## Invasive frogs wreak havoc on local species Frog species causes decline, extinction of Bay Area wildlife 
### MARGARET WENZLAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of Stanford and San Fran
cisco State University (SFSU) re
searchers recently proved that a type
of frog found in the Bay Area carries
a fungal pathogen that has caused the
decline or extinction of around 200
other amphibian species.
After testing 23 South African
clawed frogs found in California, the
researchers discovered that three of
the specimens, including one from

Golden Gate Park, were carrying the
Batrachochytrium dendrobatis (Bd)
pathogen. Researchers believe that
the species, which isn't harmed itself
by the pathogen, played a large role
in introducing the fungus to the Unit
ed States, where it has devastated
other frog populations.
Vance Vredenburg, a biologist at
SFSU and the lead author of the pa
per, began studying the South
African clawed frogs several years
ago while doing conservation work on
mountain yellow-legged frogs, which
he said were "literally dying in front
of my eyes" after being infected with
the fungus.
"I was trying to figure out what

was going on with these frogs and it
turns out that there was a pathogenic
fungus killing frogs all over the
world," Vredenburg said. "The big
question was where did the fungus
come from and why is it having such
a dramatic effect on species?"
Professor of Comparative Medi
cine Sherril Green subsequently con
tacted Vredenburg two years ago,
seeking help in testing archival speci
mens to investigate the source of the
Bd pathogen. Though scientists pre
viously believed that the clawed frog
was connected to the Bd infection, the
team's discovery was the first confir-
