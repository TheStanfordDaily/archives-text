## Invasive frogs wreak havoc on local species Frog species causes decline, extinction of Bay Area wildlife 
### MARGARET WENZLAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of Stanford and San Fran
cisco State University (SFSU) re
searchers recently proved that a type
of frog found in the Bay Area carries
a fungal pathogen that has caused the
decline or extinction of around 200
other amphibian species.
After testing 23 South African
clawed frogs found in California, the
researchers discovered that three of
the specimens, including one from

Golden Gate Park, were carrying the
Batrachochytrium dendrobatis (Bd)
pathogen. Researchers believe that
the species, which isn't harmed itself
by the pathogen, played a large role
in introducing the fungus to the Unit
ed States, where it has devastated
other frog populations.
Vance Vredenburg, a biologist at
SFSU and the lead author of the pa
per, began studying the South
African clawed frogs several years
ago while doing conservation work on
mountain yellow-legged frogs, which
he said were "literally dying in front
of my eyes" after being infected with
the fungus.
"I was trying to figure out what

was going on with these frogs and it
turns out that there was a pathogenic
fungus killing frogs all over the
world," Vredenburg said. "The big
question was where did the fungus
come from and why is it having such
a dramatic effect on species?"
Professor of Comparative Medi
cine Sherril Green subsequently con
tacted Vredenburg two years ago,
seeking help in testing archival speci
mens to investigate the source of the
Bd pathogen. Though scientists pre
viously believed that the clawed frog
was connected to the Bd infection, the
team's discovery was the first confir-
mation of the species' role in
spreading the water-trans
mitted fungus around the
world.
"These frogs evolutionally
have adapted to be very
hearty in all kinds of environ
ments, so they can sustain
themselves through periods
of drought by hibernating in
the dirt," Green said. "They
are a pretty adaptable
species."
South African clawed frogs
in the United States
The South African clawed
frog was first introduced to
California in the early 20th
century through imports from
the Ivory Coast. By the 19405,
American scientists began to
use the frogs for pregnancy
testing.
"If you take urine from a
pregnant woman and inject it
into these frogs, if she is preg
nant the frog will lay then
own eggs," Green said. "So
that was a positive pregnancy
test."
Once more advanced preg
nancy screening techniques
were developed in the 1960s
and 19705, hospitals and labs
released the pathogen-carry
ing frogs into the wild, where
they spread the harmful fun

gus to other amphibians
through water.
"There are hundreds of
species that when infected will
die within two weeks. They
get massive skin infections,"
Vredenburg said. "They try
to shed the fungus from the
skin, but their skin can be up
to 40 times the width of a nor
mal uninfected frog skin."
While the fungus has
killed off amphibians in Amer
ica, species in Africa devel
oped immunity to it, limiting
the damage caused by clawed
frogs in their natural habitat.
"They were not causing
major die-offs in Africa be
cause [the frogs] had been
there for a while," Vreden
burg said. "Humans inadver
tently moved the pathogens to
a new place where they had
not been and thus caused the
havoc that we see."
Dangers of non-native species
Though the frogs still play
a role in biomedical research
today, Vredenburg said that
there are restrictions on how
the frogs can be used and
what happens to them when
the research is complete.
"What worries me is that
there are other species like
the African clawed frog that
people who aren't scientists
can buy and trade and sell,"
Vredenburg said, noting that
such people might release the
species into the wild. "The re
search labs that have them

are not allowed to let them go,
there are all kinds of great
safeguards in research labs so
that the pathogens are not
getting out into the wild."
Vredenburg said that
while African clawed frogs are
no longer being released into
the wild, the manner by which
the frogs, a non-native
species, were able to infiltrate
and damage Californian
ecosystems presents broader
implications.
"We need to start paying
attention to food markets that
are trading live animals or pet
stores," Vredenburg said. "At
different pet stores you can
buy amphibians that were
captured in Asia and if you
want to, you can release them
in Golden Gate Park. That's
not a good idea. We should get
this straightened out now, not
20 years from now."
As for the amphibians af
fected by the fungus, re
searchers hope that the sur
vivors can adapt and eventual
ly develop immunity.
'At this point there are so
many established wild popula
tions of non-native species in
California, it would be impos
sible to collect them all,"
Green said. "We hope that if
the native species here in Cal
ifornia get exposed to the fun
gus, the ones who survive will
become resistant."
