## Senate passes divestment bill ASSU Undergraduate Senate calls on Stanford to divest from fossil fuels 
### LUCY SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a Tuesday evening meeting lasting just
one hour and seven minutes, the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate passed a resolution in
support of fossil fuel divestment at Stanford,
a bill that extends the two-year term of the
current CEO of Stanford Student Enterpris
es (SSE) and a bill establishing an Under
graduate 50k Challenge mirroring the previ
ous Senate's spending initiatives.
The fossil fuel divestment resolution dom
inated the meeting and prompted two imme
diate amendments from Senators Hisham Al-
Falih 'l6 and Ryan Matsumoto 'l6.
Al-Falih supported the bill but expressed
concern about the use of a 2011 report to de
fine the 200 companies chosen for divest
ment. He emphasized the need for an up-to
date list, which the bill's proponents accepted
and included as a friendly amendment.
Matsumoto's resolution, which stressed
the need for more research about the Univer
sity endowment's finances, prompted contro
versy about the Senate's role in advising the
University. Specifically, his resolution altered
a call for the University to "divest fully from
these companies within five years" to calling
for the University to "divest fully from these
companies within five years if further investi
gation confirms that such a move is financial
ly viable."
"I want to emphasize that more investiga
tion needs to be done on the University's
part," Matsumoto said. "I think they will take
us more seriously if we present this as an is
sue that needs to be investigated more thor
oughly and with specific regards to Stan
ford's endowment."
Senate Chair Ben Holston 'l5 described
Matsumoto's amendment as irrelevant and
detrimental to the initial intent of the resolu
tion.
"Putting something in about the Universi
ty's financial details, that to me is a separate
issue," Holston said. "I think that jeopardizes
this resolution because it is not relevant and I
feel that Ryan's addition to the clause weak
ens the language of the resolution. Rather
than requesting they divest from these com
panies, it gives them an out to [only] divest if
it is financially feasible."
Senator Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6 agreed,
stating that the amendment was inappropri
ate in the context of the resolution.

"It is not the business of 19-year-olds to
discuss what we should do about the Univer
sity's financial endowment," Mouzykantskii
said. "There are people who are paid good
money to do that for us."
Members of Fossil Free Stanford agreed
with Holston and Mouzykantskii, deciding
not to include Matsumoto's amendment in
their resolution.
Discussion was subsequently cut short
despite a number of senators remaining on
the speaking list for a vote. The resolution
passed with 10 senators in favor, Senators
Abby Dow 'l6, Nikos Liodakis 'l6 and Mat
sumoto against and Eilaf Osman'l6 and An
gela Zhang'l6 not present.
Dow expressed concern about the lack of
information held by senators with regards to
the University's finances.
"To me, passing a resolution that is com
menting on the endowment is implying that
we are qualified to make statements on how
we think the endowment should be handled,"
she said. "Passing a resolution for strictly
moral reasons that doesn't address the finan
cial viability of something that is directly
dealing with the endowment does not make
sense to me."
Despite her concerns, many senators ex
pressed pride in the resolution's passage.
"A lot of work has been done by Fossil Free
Stanford on ensuring that it is a sustainable,
viable way for Stanford to proceed with its en
dowment and I was very happy to vote yes for
it today," Mouzykantskii said. "We join hun
dreds of universities across the country that
have also supported fossil free divestment and
I urge the University's APIRL committee to
take serious consideration of what their un
dergraduate student body believes is the right
thing to do with them money."
Following the resolution's passage, the
Senate unanimously passed three more bills.
The first allowed current CEO Neveen Mah
moud 'll to retain her position for a third
year while the search continues for a replace
ment. While Eitan Winer Pinkas 'l2 M.S. 'l2
was initially appointed to the position, a hu
man resources issue prevented him from tak
ing the job.
The Senate also approved the passage of
an initiative funding student group events,
mirroring the last Senate's "40k Challenge"
as a means of spending accumulated ASSU
reserve and buffer funds.. The undergradu
ate "50k Challenge" will allocate money to
events for the upcoming fall.

Following the resolution's passage, the
Senate unanimously passed three more bills.
The first allowed current CEO Neveen Mah
moud 'll to retain her position for a third
year while the search continues for a replace
ment. While Eitan Winer Pinkas 'l2 M.S. 'l2
was initially appointed to the position, a hu
man resources issue prevented him from tak
ing the job.
The Senate also approved the passage of
an initiative funding student group events,
mirroring the last Senate's "40k Challenge"
as a means of spending accumulated ASSU
reserve and buffer funds.. The undergradu
ate "50k Challenge" will allocate money to
events for the upcoming fall.
