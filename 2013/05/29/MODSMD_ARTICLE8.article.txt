## Be thankful for what you've got 
### Winston Shi 
For those of you who
missed Dr. Tom Taylor's
column from yesterday,
the recently enshrined en
gineering expert talked
about the curse of high expecta
tions. Dr. Taylor expected his disser
tation defense to be successful, and
he was not elated but relieved when
it was.
Similarly, as Dr. Taylor pointed
out, Stanford football expects to
have a fantastic season. After two
embarrassing oversights on the na
tional media's part the 2010 team
was initially unranked and finished
No. 4, while 2012 went from No. 21
to No. 7 it is to the press' credit
that they have not chosen to double
down on their previous mistakes.
ESPN, Vegas, Sporting News and
Athlon currently have the Cardinal
in their preseason rankings at No. 5,
No. 6, No. 2, and No. 7, respectively.
But it is a widely acknowledged
truth in sports that the better you
are, the fewer upsets you can score;
the target is on your back, not the
other way around.
Everybody will be gunning for
Stanford this season. Everybody
was gunning for Stanford last sea
son, after all. Even teams such as
San Jose State, Washington, Wash
ington State and Arizona gave the
Cardinal their best shot. For many
squads, their game against Stanford
will be their Super Bowl.
The attitude and expectations of
and for Stanford football are chang
ing, and that is a good thing. David
Shaw commented after 2012 USC
that "I would like for everyone in
the stadium to not be surprised." In
deed, Stanford is aiming to be a
powerhouse program, and power
house programs do not celebrate
beating mid-tier Pac-12 teams. Pow
erhouse programs do not rush the
field (unless you are Notre Dame af
ter the 2012 Stanford game). Power
house programs expect success and
are only surprised by failure. Pow
erhouse programs sell themselves
to recruits and perpetuate them
selves. Success breeds success, and
in an environment of success, there
will be no more 2007 USC-style up
sets. There can't be. Relief has re
placed surprise.
But let's not forget that relief
should never preclude wonder.

Let's make this clear: a certain
sense of arrogance ought to be in
herent in a good program, in the
sense that this is Stanford and no
body came to Stanford to settle for
second not in the classroom, not
on the playing field, not in music, not
in anything. People come to Stan
ford for the resources, the atmos
phere and the competitiveness.
At a school with an eleven-figure
endowment (seriously, think about
how much money that is), it should
be more than clear that the deck is
stacked in our favor. With the ad
vantages we have, we can never set
tle for anything less than brilliance.
We should strive to win everywhere,
in everything, all the time.
But high expectations are not
the same as entitlement. Consider
the popular USC "Arrogant Nation"
t-shirts, after all. Arrogance is part
of USC's shtick, but arrogance also
led USC to fight the NCAA during
the Reggie Bush scandal and suffer
retaliatory sanctions sanctions
that helped a preseason No. 1 crash
and burn to 7-6 last fall. Neither did
the Trojans' history save them from
going 3-8 in 1991 or 5-7 in 2000. This
is the sort of thing that happens
when you believe your own press.
In a similar way, Stanford cannot
expect fortune to smile on them
every game; 2012's Notre Dame
game may have ended on a rather
questionable note, but human reff
ing is and has always been part of
the game and the goal is always to
win games handily enough that bad
reffing won't matter. Sometimes the
breaks fall your way, sometimes
they don't, but a national champion
and that is what Stanford ought
to be plays through ref-created
adversity.
This is why, ultimately, I am
somewhat uncomfortable with the
USC-bashing "They Should Be
Used to This Right Now" t-shirts.
They are obviously meant in good
fun and a little trash talk is perfect
ly compatible with a sane perspec
tive. However, taken out of context,
this rhetoric may engender a critical
misconception. People, beating
the University of Southern Cal
ifornia is not our birthright. This
