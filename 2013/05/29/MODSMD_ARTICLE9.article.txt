# TOUGH FINISH
## STANFORD ENDS SEASON 13TH 
### CAMERON MILLER STAFF WRITER 
In spite of a final round tumble
down the leaderboard, the No. 10
Stanford women's golf team fin
ished in a tie for 13th at the NCAA
Championships in Athens, Ga. —
the squad's highest finish at the
national tournament since placing
fifth in 2007.
"We feel great about this year,"
head coach Anne Walker said. "We
accomplished many great things:
first time we won three victories in
the same season since the 'Bos,
highest ranking since 2007, NCAA
Individual Scoring record, best fin
ish at Conference since 2001 and
many more firsts. We don't ever
want to catch ourselves comparing
to other years we only want to
know we gave it our best and that
we did."

Like their male counterparts at
the NCAA Columbus Regional, the
Stanford women got out to a relative
ly good start in Athens. A first round
2-over 290 put the team in seventh
place, with three players in the top
20: sophomore Mariko Himangan
and freshman Lauren Kim in a tie for
sixth at 1-under 71, with freshman
Mariah Stackhouse making a
highly anticipated return to her home
state coming in one stroke back of
that duo at even-par 72.
The Card quintet followed up
the opener with its best round of
the tournament, a 2-under 288 per
formance to put itself in a tie for
fifth with No. 7 Purdue, three
shots out of third but well behind
leader and eventual national cham
pion No. 1 USC.
"We had four strong contribu
tors on the second day," Walker
said. "Every other day of the
event, we had at least two players
struggling to break 75, which
made it tough to shoot a low team
number."
This strong play over the first

36 holes was very much a depar
ture from the Stanford teams who
have competed in the last three na
tional championships: None of
those groups ever climbed higher
than 19th place in the team compe
tition, and last year's squad was in
24th last place for the entire
ty of the tournament.
However, the team's excellent
initial burst slowly and then rapid
ly fizzled out in eerily similar fash
ion to the Stanford men's drastic
drop-off that ended their season.
Thursday's third round saw
Stanford shoot a combined 13-over
301, tied for the fifth-highest score
of the day. None of the Cardinal
golfers broke par as the team
slipped into seventh place, three
strokes behind Pac-12 foe No. 13
Arizona State.
Like she had in the first round,
Kim led the team on the day, post
ing a l-over 73, while Stackhouse,
after a 4-under 68 second round,
cooled off with a 2-over 74.
In Friday's final round, the
Card's best score was a 7-over 79

a telling statistic in what was a
very uncharacteristic day for Stan
ford. The team recorded a 33-over
321, the fourth highest of the
round, with all five players record
ing at least four bogeys and one
double bogey and combining for
only four birdies as a team.
"The wind was blowing very
hard, and, by the time we teed off,
the conditions were firm and dry
with tucked pin placements,"
Walker said of the final round con
ditions. "It was an extremely diffi
cult challenge however, we still
played worse than the field, and I
attribute that to emotional exhaus
tion. The team wanted a top-10 fin
ish badly, and when we got off to
such a difficult start, it was hard
for each player to maintain their
composure. I think there were a lot
of learning experiences on the
course yesterday that will only
make us better going forward."
It was a disappointing end to an

otherwise successful spring sea
son, which saw the Cardinal win its
first three tournaments and tie for
third and fourth at the very com
petitive PING ASU Invitational
and Pac-12 Championships, re
spectively.
The program has also witnessed
Stackhouse's rapid rise to stardom,
though she carded a season-high
round of 9-over 81 to cap her first
national championship. Stackhouse
ended up tied for 29th, Kim's 8-
over 80 left her tied for 42nd and
Watson finished tied for 73rd in the
126-woman field.
"From this tournament," Stack
house said, "I learned that no mat
ter how comfortable I am with my
game, the final round of a major
championship is going to be emo

tional, and I have to work that
much harder to stay within myself
and play smart golf."
No. 1 USC thoroughly dominat
ed the tournament, turning in a
combined 19-under score and de
feating second place No. 3 Duke by
21 strokes. The Trojans placed all
five of their golfers in the top 20,
led by individual champion Annie
Park (-10), who bested Duke's
Lindy Duncan by six shots.
Though Stanford will lose the
tried and tested veteran Watson, it
will bring a strong Class of 2017
that should compete for the opening
spot in the starting lineup. Casey
Danielson, the third-ranked U.S.
junior girls golfer, and Jisoo Keel, a
top Canadian junior, both will ma
triculate to Stanford in the fall.
And with Stackhouse, the No. 3
golfer in the nation as just a fresh
man, returning, anything could
happen.
"I won't dwell on the poor finish
I had," Stackhouse said. "It's hard
to end a season that way, but I'll try
to focus on what was a great fresh
man year. As a team, we had a real
ly solid season. I can't wait to see
what the future holds in store for
us starting next year."

Danielson, the third-ranked U.S.
junior girls golfer, and Jisoo Keel, a
top Canadian junior, both will ma
triculate to Stanford in the fall.
And with Stackhouse, the No. 3
golfer in the nation as just a fresh
man, returning, anything could
happen.
"I won't dwell on the poor finish
I had," Stackhouse said. "It's hard
to end a season that way, but I'll try
to focus on what was a great fresh
man year. As a team, we had a real
ly solid season. I can't wait to see
what the future holds in store for
us starting next year."

In spite of a final round tumble
down the leaderboard, the No. 10
Stanford women's golf team fin
ished in a tie for 13th at the NCAA
Championships in Athens, Ga. —
the squad's highest finish at the
national tournament since placing
fifth in 2007.
"We feel great about this year,"
head coach Anne Walker said. "We
accomplished many great things:
first time we won three victories in
the same season since the 'Bos,
highest ranking since 2007, NCAA
Individual Scoring record, best fin
ish at Conference since 2001 and
many more firsts. We don't ever
want to catch ourselves comparing
to other years we only want to
know we gave it our best and that
we did."

Like their male counterparts at
the NCAA Columbus Regional, the
Stanford women got out to a relative
ly good start in Athens. A first round
2-over 290 put the team in seventh
place, with three players in the top
20: sophomore Mariko Himangan
and freshman Lauren Kim in a tie for
sixth at 1-under 71, with freshman
Mariah Stackhouse making a
highly anticipated return to her home
state coming in one stroke back of
that duo at even-par 72.
The Card quintet followed up
the opener with its best round of
the tournament, a 2-under 288 per
formance to put itself in a tie for
fifth with No. 7 Purdue, three
shots out of third but well behind
leader and eventual national cham
pion No. 1 USC.
"We had four strong contribu
tors on the second day," Walker
said. "Every other day of the
event, we had at least two players
struggling to break 75, which
made it tough to shoot a low team
number."
This strong play over the first

36 holes was very much a depar
ture from the Stanford teams who
have competed in the last three na
tional championships: None of
those groups ever climbed higher
than 19th place in the team compe
tition, and last year's squad was in
24th last place for the entire
ty of the tournament.
However, the team's excellent
initial burst slowly and then rapid
ly fizzled out in eerily similar fash
ion to the Stanford men's drastic
drop-off that ended their season.
Thursday's third round saw
Stanford shoot a combined 13-over
301, tied for the fifth-highest score
of the day. None of the Cardinal
golfers broke par as the team
slipped into seventh place, three
strokes behind Pac-12 foe No. 13
Arizona State.
Like she had in the first round,
Kim led the team on the day, post
ing a l-over 73, while Stackhouse,
after a 4-under 68 second round,
cooled off with a 2-over 74.
In Friday's final round, the
Card's best score was a 7-over 79

courtesy of senior Sally Watson
a telling statistic in what was a
very uncharacteristic day for Stan
ford. The team recorded a 33-over
321, the fourth highest of the
round, with all five players record
ing at least four bogeys and one
double bogey and combining for
only four birdies as a team.
"The wind was blowing very
hard, and, by the time we teed off,
the conditions were firm and dry
with tucked pin placements,"
Walker said of the final round con
ditions. "It was an extremely diffi
cult challenge however, we still
played worse than the field, and I
attribute that to emotional exhaus
tion. The team wanted a top-10 fin
ish badly, and when we got off to
such a difficult start, it was hard
for each player to maintain their
composure. I think there were a lot
of learning experiences on the
course yesterday that will only
make us better going forward."
It was a disappointing end to an

otherwise successful spring sea
son, which saw the Cardinal win its
first three tournaments and tie for
third and fourth at the very com
petitive PING ASU Invitational
and Pac-12 Championships, re
spectively.
The program has also witnessed
Stackhouse's rapid rise to stardom,
though she carded a season-high
round of 9-over 81 to cap her first
national championship. Stackhouse
ended up tied for 29th, Kim's 8-
over 80 left her tied for 42nd and
Watson finished tied for 73rd in the
126-woman field.
"From this tournament," Stack
house said, "I learned that no mat
ter how comfortable I am with my
game, the final round of a major
championship is going to be emo

tional, and I have to work that
much harder to stay within myself
and play smart golf."
No. 1 USC thoroughly dominat
ed the tournament, turning in a
combined 19-under score and de
feating second place No. 3 Duke by
21 strokes. The Trojans placed all
five of their golfers in the top 20,
led by individual champion Annie
Park (-10), who bested Duke's
Lindy Duncan by six shots.
Though Stanford will lose the
tried and tested veteran Watson, it
will bring a strong Class of 2017
that should compete for the opening
spot in the starting lineup. Casey
Danielson, the third-ranked U.S.
junior girls golfer, and Jisoo Keel, a
top Canadian junior, both will ma
