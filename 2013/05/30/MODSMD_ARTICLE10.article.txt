## Research shows financial incentives drive exercise 
### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at Stanford and the
University of Michigan recently
found that an insurance policy that
offered lower rates for obese cus
tomers who participated in a walk
ing program was successful in get
ting these patients to exercise more.
The study was conducted with
customers of the Blue Care Net
work, which has previously used
similar policies to try to incentivize
healthier lifestyles among its cus
tomers.
When obese participants had to
choose between exercising and pay
ing 20-percent higher health insur
ance costs, 97 percent of the partici
pants who committed to a regular,
Internet-tracked walking program
followed through with it and
walked an average of 5,000 steps a
day or more.
"This was a great way to study
how these programs do in the real
world with financial incentives that
would usually be allowed," said Don
na Zulman 'OO, a medical instructor
and the paper's lead author. "These
were people who were deciding to
enroll in something offered by their
insurance companies in a real world
setting, and we just stepped in to un
derstand how things were working."
In order to qualify for participa
tion, patients had to have a Body
Mass Index of at least 30, the cutoff
for obesity. To receive the financial
incentive, participants agreed to
walk 5,000 steps per day and wear a
pedometer that tracked their step
count.
Approximately 15,000 patients
qualified based on their weight, and
12,000 agreed to participate. Half
participated in the walking program,
and the other half participated in an
other wellness program, such as
Weight Watchers.
According to Zulman, the re
searchers' main goal was to examine
the effectiveness of incentivized
health programs, although they
were also interested in tracking par
ticipants' perceptions of the policy.
"We were primarily interested in
whether people would agree to par
ticipate in a program for physical ac
tivity, and if they agreed, whether
they would actually participate and

meet the goals of the program," Zul
man said.
The research team found that ad
herence rates were surprisingly
high, with University of Michigan
Assistant Professor Caroline
Richardson, a senior author of the
paper, noting that "almost the entire
cohort" stuck with the program for
the whole year.
Though Zulman said that most
participants were willing to take
part, the study and similar programs
have proved controversial, allegedly
inducing altered eating and exercise
habits by applying financial pres
sure.
"Historically, we have said that it
is unethical to force people to change
their health behaviors," Richardson
said. "While these people weren't ac
tually forced and could have chosen
not to participate in the walking pro
gram, the cost was so high if they
didn't that it felt to them like they
were being coerced."
According to Richardson, many
of the participants who initially felt
coerced still continued through the
study and appreciated the health
improvements they saw over time.
Richardson said that the results
were surprising compared to other
studies of pedometer-based walk
ing programs the researchers have
done.
"In those [other] trials we
haven't given people a big discount
on their health insurance, so our
enrollment and adherence rates
have been relatively low," she said.
"But in this program, because of
the big financial incentive, every
body did it. And they stuck with it
for a full year, which was really un
expected."
Zulman said that study's results
prove that similar programs may be
effective in encouraging greater pa
tient health.
"Overall, what we found was that
the program was acceptable to many
people, and that most patients were
able to meet their physical activity
goal," she said. "We feel that this is
an opportunity to encourage physi
cal activity among individuals who
have health risks associated with
obesity."
