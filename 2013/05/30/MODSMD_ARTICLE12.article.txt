### Joseph Beyda Joseph "Hockey Whore" Beyda is still noticeably upset over the shortened Sharks season is taking it out on the MLB. Let him know on which side you stand at jbeyda@stanford. edu follow him on Twitter @DailyJBeyda 
Thirteen months ago, I set a
timer on my phone. It was
n't reminding me to move
my laundry over to the
dryer and it wasn't telling
me that my time was up for that CS
107 practice final. It was a countdown
to the start of the next NHL season,
one that I started just minutes after
the Sharks were eliminated from the
playoffs.
As it turned out, that countdown
ran four months later than expected
due to the lockout that shortened the
2012-13 hockey season. But even with
that bad omen in mind, I set another
timer this Wednesday morning once I
had healed from San Jose's elimina
tion in game seven of its second
round series on Ihesday night.
For the time being, while I store
my Sharks shirts in dark drawers
where they will be kept out of sight
and, more importantly, out of mind
until October, it's finally time to
turn to my summer sporting pastime:
Giants baseball.
I'm joining the MLB season late,
however. The season is already al
most a third of the way over, and al
though I looked up the highlights
whenever I heard that the Giants had
won with an exciting walk-off the
night before, I still can't tell you squat
about whether Tim Lincecum has
bounced back from his disastrous
2012 campaign, whether Buster
Posey has a chance to defend his Na
tional League MVP crown or
whether Pablo Sandoval looks any
less rotund on the base paths.
I consider myself an informed,
passionate fan of both the Sharks and
Giants, but needless to say, no timer
was set for baseball's Opening Day.
That's in spite of the fact that I get all
giddy over the first few Sharks
games of the year when they fall right
in the heart of the Stanford football
campaign. Baseball just doesn't pull
my attention away from the rest of
the world like hockey does.
Three weeks ago, Sam "Football
Frenzied" Fisher wrote that the
NHL and NBA postseasons are too
lengthy. I'd argue that the MLB reg
ular season is actually too long, at
least from the fans' point of view.
I do think that the MLB needs a
162-game season; since even the
best teams in the league win less
than two-thirds of the time, you
need that many games to create
any separation in the standings.
But that means there's hardly any
drama over the first 100 games of
the season and there's especially
little intrigue over the first 50 con
tests, the ones I've missed this year
and miss just about every year that
my Sharks are in the playoffs. As of
Wednesday morning, I discovered
that the Giants, true to form, have
a -2 run differential through 52
games and are still just two games
out of a playoff spot. Not only is
that start unremarkable, but in two
days the Giants could be back to
square one in the playoff race.
What have I missed?
There are at least two groups of
fans out there that will disagree
with me: the fantasy nuts who have
been tracking every MLB player
and their bowel movements since
Opening Day, and the baseball
purists who would rather watch a
game on a two-inch handheld TV
than take a week-long Hawaiian va
cation. But for those of us who like
to flip on our hometown team
through those lazy summer nights,
what motivation is there to tune in
to a meaningless early-season
game while the NHL and NBA
playoffs rage on around us?
I know that baseball can still
have its momentary suspense. Last
weekend, Angel Pagan hit a two
run, inside-the-park, walk-off home
run in the bottom of the tenth in
ning to give San Francisco a win,
marking the first inside-the-park
walk-off in the league in nine years
and the first for the Giants since
1931.
But that's not all I'm looking for.
I want the day-to-day excitement of
a playoff race; I want some reason
to believe that this game I'm watch
ing will mean just as much tomor
row as it did today. In the MLB,
that doesn't arrive until the last two
months of the regular season.
