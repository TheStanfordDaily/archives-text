### SOO JI LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Freshman Krista Hai'debeck
debuted as the Cardinal's No. 3
singles player this season for the
women's tennis team and made an
instant impact, rising to as high as
No. 14 in the national rankings.
But she saved her biggest win for
last, bouncing back from a 1-6,1-5
deficit in the deciding match of the
national semifinal against Florida
to send Stanford to the finals. She
spoke with The Daily about her
freshman season and about win
ning the team national champi
onship.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
does it feel to be part of the
NCAA-Championship team your
first season at Stanford?
Krista Hardebeck (KH): It feels
great. I know a lot of people that
think about coming into any school
and being afraid that they won't win
an NCAA Championship. I got it
out of the way my freshman year so
I know I'll at least always have one.
TSD: Before you began the re
cruiting process, what made you
choose not to go on the pro circuit
immediately after high school?
KH: I knew that going to college
would be the best decision for my
future because it would give me
more a well-rounded experience.

TSD: What were some challenges
you overcame leading up to or dur

ingthe NCAAs?
KH: We obviously got a really dif
ficult draw, so that was one huge
challenge that my team and I had
to overcome. It was a difficult road
but it ended up being alright.
TSD: When you clinched in the
semifinals against No. 1 seed
Florida, what thoughts were going
on in your mind?
KH: I was just so excited that our
team was going to be in the finals.
We were really happy that Florida
wasn't going to win three years in
a row so I was really happy that I
was one of the people who could
help prevent that.
TSD: Then later after Stanford
won the team title, how was it com
peting in the NCAA singles tour
nament alongside your teammates
Nicole Gibbs and Kristie Ahn?
KH: They've always been inspira
tions to me and I've known them
for a very long time. It was great
playing right next to them, and [to]
get them pumped up and have
them pump me up.
TSD: Any goals for tennis your
sophomore year?
KH: If we could win another
NCAA title, that would definitely
be the greatest thing that could
happen.

TSD: When you aren't playing ten
nis, how do you like spending your
free time?
KH: I like to hang out with my

friends and I like to listen to rap
music.
TSD: You've played at several pro
tennis tournaments this past
school year. Are you planning to
continue to do so this summer?
KH: I'm going to be playing a full

schedule of pro-circuit events this
summer like Lexington, Vancou
ver, Portland Oregon and hopefully
back here at Stanford for the
WTA.
