# ROWING ON A ROLL
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH EDITOR IN CHIEF 
With this weekend's forecast at
the 111 th Intercollegiate Rowing
Association Championships (colle
giate rowing's national title) calling
for temperatures nearing 100 de
grees, it's only fitting that Stan
ford's Varsity Eight is getting hot
at exactly the right time.
Two consecutive impressive
performances on the water has the
Cardinal right in the thick of things,
ranked No. 4 and poised to go stroke
for stroke with the top 22 teams in
the country starting Friday at Lake
Natoma in Sacramento.
"Stanford hasn't been this high
ly ranked going into the regatta
since 2005," senior captain Oivind
Lorentzen said. "We have our own
heat that we are favored to win and
we've just come into this with a lot
of confidence."
Turning the tables on California
will do that for a boat, as the Card
knocked off its rival Golden Bears
and won the Schwabacher Cup ear
lier this month for the first time in
five years. It was at the Pae-12

Championships, however, when
Stanford really began to believe,
hanging with No. 1 Washington for
part of the race and roaring past
Cal in the final 500 meters to grab
the silver medal and a boatload of
swagger.
"Beating Cal again at Pac-12s
proved that [the first victory] was
n't a fluke and it gave us an edge
and the confidence we need to put
us in a very good position,"
Lorentzen said.
Competition at the IRA Regatta
consists of heats (all composed of
five or six boats), repechage (sec
ond chance races), semifinals and
finals. In the varsity eight heats,
the two fastest crews advance to
the semis, while the rest are rele
gated to the repechage race, where
the top three boats will gain entry
back into the semifinals. In the
semis, the top three crews advance
to the six-boat Grand Final. The re
maining crews will race in the Pe
tite Final.
Included in the Stanford Varsity
Eight's first heat on Friday are No.
5 Northeastern, No. 13 Penn, No.
12 Wisconsin, No. 20 Holy Cross

and No. 21 George Washington.
The II Eight boat, seeded 13th
overall in the "B" class of the regat
ta, will compete against No. 12
Penn, No. 4 Princeton and No. 5
Harvard.
Because the racing calendar is
filled mostly with regional regattas
and competitions that don't foster
too much competition amongst the
country's heavyweights, this week
end is Stanford's first good look at
those boats as well as the rest of
the class of the East Coast, which
includes No. 2 Harvard and No. 3
Brown.
The Huskies, however, are
clearly the class of the field, beat
ing Stanford's Varsity Eight by 5.4
seconds at the Pac-12 Champi
onships as well as earning victories
over Brown, Cornell and Dart
mouth en route to an undefeated
regular season for the sixth time in
the last seven years.
"Washington certainly has a
mystique to it," Lorentzen said,
"and they are the top team in the
country. But we are going to go out
and try to beat them. They're not
unbeatable, and if we can get to

that position in the Grand Final
first, then we'll let all cannons fire.
If you shoot for Washington and
come up short, you'll likely be sec
ond overall."

Harvard, too, figures to be right
up there with the rest of the big
boys, having proved itself as the
class of the East with a win at the
Eastern Sprints and a tradition of
placing well at IRAs (the Crimson
has medaled in three straight
years). Brown is no slouch either,
finishing second at IRAs last sea
son and securing the No. 3 seed
thanks to a runner-up finish behind
Harvard at the Eastern Sprints
earlier this month.
All three schools ranked ahead
of the Cardinal are sending a virtu
al armada of boats to IRAs, with, in
some cases, five different boats
qualifying for different classes at
the competition. With a long legacy
of excellence in the sport, these
programs boast Olympic pedigrees
up and down the oar ports, not to
mention height and power. The
Huskies have 13 rowers listed as 6-

foot-5 or taller on their roster; Har
vard and Brown both have many
more.
Stanford, on the other hand,
prides itself on being a group of
somewhat undersized rowers that
can thrive in the underdog position,
according to Lorentzen, in addition
to having possibly the best colle
giate rower in the country, junior
Austin Hack.
"Everyone [besides the 6-foot-8
Hack] is kind of relatively small,"
he said. "But we're all fit and we
pride ourselves on being a tight
knit group of guys in the boat. Un
like a lot of teams, we've been row
ing the same lineup since the be
ginning of the season and, while
other guys on teams like Cal might
have better erg scores, it just
shows that ergs don't translate
well to races. It might be a surprise
to a lot of people that we are so
fast, but it's not a surprise to us."
Like most of the top teams,
Stanford's crew has been training
for the race all week on Lake
Natoma, a bit of a home water ad
vantage. Lake Natoma is a 2,000-
meter course 15 miles northeast of
Sacramento, widely considered one
of the best venues in the United
States for intercollegiate rowing as

the annual host of the Pac-12
Championships.
Despite the added pressure of
completing homework and assign
ments from off-campus a slight
disadvantage considering the ma
jority of the other schools have
closed their academic years
Lorenzten said that being able to
spend the week training on familiar
water is already paying dividends
for the Cardinal.
"Most teams come out to train
pretty early, and usually the IRAs
are on the East Coast; the competi
tion rotates annually but was last
on the West Coast in 2009,"
Lorentzen said. "But for us not to
have to deal with a time change and
acclimate faster is good. It's been
very nice to get away from school
and the distractions and concen
trate on rowing for a week, and
with really good water to practice
on we've been getting significantly
faster, even in just the last few
days. We're a lighter, fitter crew,
and who knows, maybe the East
Coast teams are not used to this
dry heat."
Stanford will find out how high it
can set the bar when the starting
gun goes off for the first heat at 8:45
a.m. Friday morning. The events
will be streamed live in their entire
ty, with video feeds available at
