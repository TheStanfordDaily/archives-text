## THE 						NEW MAN In Defense of the West 
### Chris Herries 
I've never written a follow-up to
a column before, so bear with
me. Last week I wrote about
how Stanford should reinstate a
History of Western Civilization core
curriculum for all students. I envi
sion it being four units per quarter
for fall, winter and spring of fresh
man year, sufficient to construct a
basic chronicle of Western history.
My argument is pretty simple.
1) We should have a core curriculum,
though this is a different debate in
and of itself. 2) That core curriculum
should be a comprehensive survey of
the most important formative ideas
and histories in our society. 3) There
fore, as members of a Western socie
ty in an increasingly Westernized
world, studying the history of the
West is most beneficial.
Generally speaking, I got a good
reception from the people I talked to
about my column. I only received one
email critiquing my view, which I
replied to, while I received several
supportive emails even a couple
from alumni from the 1930s who
went through the program!
On the other hand, there was a lot
of negativity in the online comments
section. Very little of the criticism im
pugned my actual article and the
three points listed above, but I'll
write a response about what I per
ceived to be the general tone.
The problem is, the centrality of
Western culture offends the sensibil
ities of some people. Some people
can't handle the fact that history is a
diamond with both beautiful and ug
ly facets. They hear "West" and im
mediately think imperialism, rather
than thinking about medicine and lib
eral democracy. Citing human rights
violations or UN conventions, they
fail to realize that these ideas first
cropped up and were debated in the
Western world.
So yes, there are things wrong in
today's world that are a result of
Western actions and ideas. At the
same time, most of what's right with
the world is also Western and
that's why people primarily immi
grate to, and not from, Western and
Westernized countries.
This duality is nothing short of re
ality. The West is a dynamic civiliza
tion; it's where communism and cap
italism, democracy and fascism, all
fought their battles. To boil it down
as absolutely good or absolutely evil
denies the reality of this dynamism.
To prove the point, I'll share one
of the more misguided comments.
After claiming the West has nothing
to do with his civilization, the com
menter said, "The West' is an out
dated concept in the 21st century
and a tradition that only imperialists
and racists wish to continue. Ab
solutely nothing that happened in
Germany or France or Switzerland
300 years ago is part of 'my' civiliza
tion."
I'll ignore that fact that the com
menter essentially called me a racist.
But, really? Nothing from the En
lightenment has anything, anything
at all, to do with your civilization?
The Scientific Revolution hasn't ad
vantaged you at all? Imperialism
hasn't shaped the country you live
in? Time to grow up. Even if this
commenter isn't American, there is
n't a country on Earth untouched by
the events in Europe 300 years ago,

for good or for ill.
But it is exactly this level of will
ful, almost proud, ignorance that
prompts me to advocate for courses
in Western history. How can you pos
sibly tackle the problems of today if
you think that past has nothing to do
with them?
There is a point I do need to clar
ify, as a friend of mine pointed out.
His claim was that I made it seem as
if other civilizations, and other histo
ries, are devoid of value. It's not that
no other civilization is important; it's
that no other civilization is as impor
tant as the West in assessing the cur
rent state of our society and, frankly,
the world. If we want a comprehen
sive survey relevant to modern soci
ety, then we should have courses in
Western history. If we were a Chi
nese university, I imagine it would be
most fruitful to study Asian civiliza
tions. But we're rooted firmly in the
United States, a country formed of
Western institutions, ideas and de
bates.
Naturally, cultural diffusion hap
pens. Absorption, permeability, bor
rowing: all historical factors. Of
course it's important to study how
the West influenced and was influ
enced by other groups that's part
of studying Western history! But I'd
still firmly argue that focusing pri
marily on ideas originating or for
malized in the West would be most
beneficial for Stanford students be
ing turned out into the world.
If you take anything from this se
ries, whether you agree with the ar
gument or not, let it be this question.
Are you happy with your education?
Personally, I don't think IHUM and
Thinking Matters are the best we
can do. I think Stanford students
should walk out of here knowing the
significance of the Magna Carta,
Das Capital, The Wealth of Na
tions, Candide, The Republic, and
more.
Not only should we be familiar
with texts like these; we should also
be aware of how they continue to in
form debates today. Are you an "ac
tivist" who gets fired up over a series
of statistics, or are you an educated
individual familial 1 with the ideas that
have crafted our society? Are you go
ing to be a doctor with no knowledge
outside the field of medicine, and
therefore less able to comprehend
how it interacts with society? Are
you going to join the ranks of policy
makers, economists or soldiers and
be oblivious to our history? I hope
you enter into our civilization with
the ability to change it for the better.
Part of that is learning the historical
ideas at its very foundation.
