# THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## A 						Few Final Thoughts 
### Adam Johnson 
With graduation coming up
in a little over two weeks,
I've been thinking a great
deal about life after Stanford. Un
like many members of the Class of
2013,1 do not have a job in the Bay
Area lined up, nor any prospects in
the area for that matter. Come
next May, I will in all likelihood be
somewhere else in the country, if
not the world. I will be physically
separated from a great deal of the
friends I've made here, although
hopefully I can stay in contact with
them through Facebook and tex
ting.
In a column earlier this year, I
wrote about how I was ready to
move on from Stanford. I am still
ready (well, perhaps I could have
used one more quarter!). But that
does not mean that moving on will
be easy.
A chapter of my life will be
over, and though I can always go
back and reread said chapter, I will
never actively write it again. I will
miss watching football games in
the student section; I will miss the
academic and extracurricular op
portunities just a short walk away;
and I will miss the geographical
density of such motivated and pas
sionate people. Heck, I may even
miss final exams, given that finals
week is when I finally find time to
do things like play pickup basket
ball at the gym and read for enjoy
ment.
And although I don't really
want to spend another year or
four here, I would be lying if I
said Stanford hasn't been good for
me. Since being here, I've become
a far better thinker, writer, leader
and friend. I have become involved
in two activities —journalism and
acting in which I had no inten
tion of participating when walking
up the steps to Roble Hall the first
time my freshman year. I have dis
covered intellectual passions while
realizing that some areas I
thought I may have been interest
ed in such as business and high
tech really don't inspire me.
I was able to take advantage of
Stanford's vast resources, such as
TSF and special fees and dorm
funding, to pursue my own proj-

ects as well as enrich my perspec
tives by attending functions put on
by other groups. While I never
participated in the Bing Overseas
Study Program, hearing from all
my friends who went abroad in
spired me to do my own trip
through Europe this past summer.
Sure, I would have done some of
these things had I attended a dif
ferent school, but the exact combi
nation is particular to Stanford
University. In that sense, I will al
ways be a Cardinal.
Traditionally, writers offer a
piece of advice, some words of wis
dom, in their final columns. One
piece of advice I have not yet given
is that we should approach college
as a learning experience outside
the classroom as much as inside of
it. Some people will say that Stan
ford students are too focused on
extracurricular and social activi
ties. They will criticize how we are
not academic or intellectual
enough. And yet, most of my
growth over these years has come
outside of the classroom: being a
freshman RA, spending my sum
mers as a camp counselor, living in
a co-op, dealing with roommates,
attending dorm trips, acting in in
dependent theatre and more.
I was talking with an under
classman the other day and my ex
perience as a freshman RA came
up. I eventually asked her if she
was interested in being a freshman
RA she replied that it seemed
like too much of a challenge, and
that she therefore wouldn't pursue
it. I didn't tell her then, but I think
that is exactly why she should be

come a freshman RA! It is all-too
easy to go four years here rarely
challenging ourselves. Sure, our
coursework can often be consid
ered challenging, but there is little
genuine possibility of failure; most
classes are curved to a B + , and if
we don't have time to complete a
major assignment, professors are
normally willing to grant exten
sions. For most of us, then, assign
ments and exams are technical,
not personal, challenges; the ques
tion we ask is "How can I do this?"
rather than "Can I do this?".
Accordingly, I think the great
est challenges and opportunities
for personal growth can be found
outside the classroom. While I am
often critical of the startup cul
ture, I respect those who are will
ing to give themselves to ideas that
in all likelihood will be met with re
jection by investors or, if not there,
then in the marketplace. I respect
the women's tennis team, even be
fore they completed their improb
able run last week to become
NCAA Champions as a twelve
seed. Or for those who decide to
stretch their comfort zones in
terms of the communities they as
sociate with and the activities they
pursue. On a recent backcountry
trip to Yosemite I did with my
house, one resident came who had
never camped outdoors before, let
alone been in the backcountry. As
the trip leader, I was initially con
cerned with how this fact would
make my job harder, but then I re
alized that this resident, of all the
participants, had the greatest po
tential for personal growth on the
trip!
In short, we should embrace
challenges, especially ones found
outside the classroom. We grow
from adversity, not from complet
ing something we know before
hand will be easy. This is not novel
advice, but I do not think we hear
enough of it at Stanford.
Should we always seek out
challenge and risk? Probably not,
if only because not everything we
do or even a majority of it
should be approached in the in
strumental terms of how much we
personally can grow from the ex
perience; I learn next to nothing
from doing laundry, but it needs to
get done. Rather, it is in the "big
ger-picture" things summers,
activities, communities where
we should look for ways to broaden
our comfort zones, take chances,
risk failure, and ultimately grow
from our experiences.
That about does it for me. If
you got this far, thanks for read
ing! It has been a pleasure and a
privilege to write opinions for The
Stanford Daily for the past two
years. I'd like to thank all those
who have helped me on the way
friends, family, editors, and of
course my readers. For opinions
columnists next year: try to write
at least a few columns that you
know will encounter resistance.
There are risks, especially when
your close friends may have gross
ly differing opinions, but there are
also rewards to be had; these
columns have allowed me to better
understand my own views and how
they fit into society and (I hope)
have furthered the campus dia
logue on a handful of important is
sues. Finally, for the student who
is considering a column but is wor
ried that he or she may not have
what it takes, I have but two
words: challenge yourself!

growth over these years has come
outside of the classroom: being a
freshman RA, spending my sum
mers as a camp counselor, living in
a co-op, dealing with roommates,
attending dorm trips, acting in in
dependent theatre and more.
I was talking with an under
classman the other day and my ex
perience as a freshman RA came
up. I eventually asked her if she
was interested in being a freshman
RA she replied that it seemed
like too much of a challenge, and
that she therefore wouldn't pursue
it. I didn't tell her then, but I think
that is exactly why she should be

come a freshman RA! It is all-too
easy to go four years here rarely
challenging ourselves. Sure, our
coursework can often be consid
ered challenging, but there is little
genuine possibility of failure; most
classes are curved to a B + , and if
we don't have time to complete a
major assignment, professors are
normally willing to grant exten
sions. For most of us, then, assign
ments and exams are technical,
not personal, challenges; the ques
tion we ask is "How can I do this?"
rather than "Can I do this?".
Accordingly, I think the great
est challenges and opportunities
for personal growth can be found
outside the classroom. While I am
often critical of the startup cul
ture, I respect those who are will
ing to give themselves to ideas that
in all likelihood will be met with re
jection by investors or, if not there,
then in the marketplace. I respect
the women's tennis team, even be
fore they completed their improb
able run last week to become
NCAA Champions as a twelve
seed. Or for those who decide to
stretch their comfort zones in
terms of the communities they as
sociate with and the activities they
pursue. On a recent backcountry
trip to Yosemite I did with my
house, one resident came who had
never camped outdoors before, let
alone been in the backcountry. As
the trip leader, I was initially con
cerned with how this fact would
make my job harder, but then I re
alized that this resident, of all the
participants, had the greatest po
tential for personal growth on the
trip!
In short, we should embrace
challenges, especially ones found
outside the classroom. We grow
from adversity, not from complet
ing something we know before
hand will be easy. This is not novel
advice, but I do not think we hear
enough of it at Stanford.
Should we always seek out
challenge and risk? Probably not,
if only because not everything we
do or even a majority of it
should be approached in the in
strumental terms of how much we
personally can grow from the ex
perience; I learn next to nothing
from doing laundry, but it needs to
get done. Rather, it is in the "big
ger-picture" things summers,
activities, communities where
we should look for ways to broaden
our comfort zones, take chances,
risk failure, and ultimately grow
from our experiences.
That about does it for me. If
you got this far, thanks for read
ing! It has been a pleasure and a
privilege to write opinions for The
Stanford Daily for the past two
years. I'd like to thank all those
who have helped me on the way
friends, family, editors, and of
course my readers. For opinions
columnists next year: try to write
at least a few columns that you
know will encounter resistance.
There are risks, especially when
your close friends may have gross
ly differing opinions, but there are
also rewards to be had; these
columns have allowed me to better
understand my own views and how
they fit into society and (I hope)
have furthered the campus dia
logue on a handful of important is
sues. Finally, for the student who
is considering a column but is wor
ried that he or she may not have
what it takes, I have but two
words: challenge yourself!

With graduation coming up
in a little over two weeks,
I've been thinking a great
deal about life after Stanford. Un
like many members of the Class of
2013,1 do not have a job in the Bay
Area lined up, nor any prospects in
the area for that matter. Come
next May, I will in all likelihood be
somewhere else in the country, if
not the world. I will be physically
separated from a great deal of the
friends I've made here, although
hopefully I can stay in contact with
them through Facebook and tex
ting.
In a column earlier this year, I
wrote about how I was ready to
move on from Stanford. I am still
ready (well, perhaps I could have
used one more quarter!). But that
does not mean that moving on will
be easy.
A chapter of my life will be
over, and though I can always go
back and reread said chapter, I will
never actively write it again. I will
miss watching football games in
the student section; I will miss the
academic and extracurricular op
portunities just a short walk away;
and I will miss the geographical
density of such motivated and pas
sionate people. Heck, I may even
miss final exams, given that finals
week is when I finally find time to
do things like play pickup basket
ball at the gym and read for enjoy
ment.
And although I don't really
want to spend another year or
four here, I would be lying if I
said Stanford hasn't been good for
me. Since being here, I've become
a far better thinker, writer, leader
and friend. I have become involved
in two activities —journalism and
acting in which I had no inten
tion of participating when walking
up the steps to Roble Hall the first
time my freshman year. I have dis
covered intellectual passions while
realizing that some areas I
thought I may have been interest
ed in such as business and high
tech really don't inspire me.
I was able to take advantage of
Stanford's vast resources, such as
TSF and special fees and dorm
funding, to pursue my own proj-

ects as well as enrich my perspec
tives by attending functions put on
by other groups. While I never
participated in the Bing Overseas
Study Program, hearing from all
my friends who went abroad in
spired me to do my own trip
through Europe this past summer.
Sure, I would have done some of
these things had I attended a dif
ferent school, but the exact combi
nation is particular to Stanford
University. In that sense, I will al
ways be a Cardinal.
Traditionally, writers offer a
piece of advice, some words of wis
dom, in their final columns. One
piece of advice I have not yet given
is that we should approach college
as a learning experience outside
the classroom as much as inside of
it. Some people will say that Stan
ford students are too focused on
extracurricular and social activi
ties. They will criticize how we are
not academic or intellectual
enough. And yet, most of my
growth over these years has come
outside of the classroom: being a
freshman RA, spending my sum
mers as a camp counselor, living in
