### â€“ George Chen 
Three days after failing to earn an NCAA Tourna
ment bid, Stanford baseball received some consolation
when four players earned Pac-12 all-conference honors
on Wednesday night.
Senior ace Mark Appel, senior first baseman Brian
Ragira and senior designated hitter Justin Ringo were
named to the Pac-12 all-conference team while junior
second baseman Danny Diekroeger was awarded an
honorable mention.
Appel, who broke the career-strikeout school record
last Friday in his last game in a Cardinal uniform,
maintained a 2.48 ERA and struck out 10 or more bat
ters in four of his fourteen starts. On Tuesday, the sen
ior was also named one of 30 semifinalists for the Gold
en Spikes Award, which is given annually to the coun
try's top college baseball player.
Ragira and Ringo provided Stanford with much of
the offensive firepower this season. Ragira led the
team with a .344 batting average and ranked second in
the conference with 44 hits. Hitting from the leadoff
spot, Ringo ended the season with a .325 batting aver
age and seven stolen bases.
In addition to his sure-handed fielding at second
base, Diekroeger capped an impressive junior cam
paign with 13 multi-hit games and a .405 slugging per
centage.
