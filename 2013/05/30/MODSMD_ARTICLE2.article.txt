# Stanford to open Muslim resource center
## 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford will open a Muslim re
source center at the start of the 2013-
14 academic year, culminating an ef
fort by Muslim students and other
supporters including almost 25 fac
ulty members that has lasted near
ly a decade.
The Markaz: Resource Center for
Engagement with the Cultures and
Peoples of the Muslim World will
occupy a two-room complex on the
second floor of Old Union's Nitery
Building.
According to the project's student
leaders, the effort to establish the cen
ter reached a tipping point at the end

of winter quarter when the students
were able to discuss the issue with
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2.
"I think it was just an accumula
tion of all of the conversations we had
with the administrators," said Mahta
Baghoolizadeh 'l3, former president
of the Muslim Student Awareness
Network. "When we spoke with
Provost Etchemendy, his response
was, 'lt's time for this to happen.'"
Associate Vice Provost of Student
Affairs Sally Dickson, who will over
see the center's creation and opera
tion, agreed that the center fulfills a
student need.
"There was a general recognition
that there was a need with the grow
ing Muslim student population,"

Dickson said.
"Stanford talks a lot about diversi
ty and promoting diversity, and we
saw that it could be done better," said
Subhan Ali M.S. 'O9 Ph.D. 'l4, another
leader who contributed to the effort
to establish the center. "I think this
is why they also agreed to have the
center because it allows the Univer
sity to embrace the diverse cultures
of the Muslim world, which hasn't
been fully done yet."
The center's name Markaz
means 'center' in Arabic, Farsi, Urdu,
Ibrkish and Hebrew. The center will
serve as a place for the discussion of
Islam, the Middle East, North Africa
and South and Southeast Asia, and
will also serve as a safe space for Mus

lim students to talk with each other as
well as with non-Muslim students.
"Right now the University has a
very dedicated set of resources on the
academic front towards engagement
with Muslim civilization: with faculty,
the Abbasi [Program in Islamic Stud
ies] — these things exist," Ali said.
"[The center] is going to provide a
whole new avenue for students, facul
ty staff, to engage with these topics
outside of the traditional academic
realm."
The University has started a
search for a director who is a scholar
in Islam and the Muslim world. Pre
liminary talks with the Office of De
velopment have discussed funding
and donor engagement to support the

center's director and the cost of pro
gramming, with involved students
hoping to model then* approach off
that of the Diversity and First Gener
ation Office.
Unlike Hillel at Stanford, which is
a 501(c)(3) organization legally inde
pendent from Stanford, the students
wanted Markaz to be part of the Uni
versity and associated with the Office
of Student Affairs.
"We had the option of being a
501(c)(3), but we wanted this to be un
der Student Affairs," Baghoolizadeh
said. "We wanted to establish a rela
tionship between the student body
and the administration that hasn't
been there before for students of
Middle Eastern background, Muslim
students, North African students,
South Asian [students] and South
east Asian [students]."
"I will be working very closely
with the students who have been
very engaged and excited about this
and we'll all be working together,"
Dickson added.

According to Ali, similar initia
tives at other universities have given
Stanford students cause for opti
mism.
"Duke University set up something
similar to this, and the people I've
talked to there, once they had this,
said that it completely shifted the
culture of the conversation on cam
pus around what people thought and
felt about Islam and the Muslim peo
ple," said Ali. "We really hope to see
a similar effect."
