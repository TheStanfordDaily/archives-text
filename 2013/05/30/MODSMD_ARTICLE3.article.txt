## Student-run fund picks startups Bay Area Dorm Fund gives 10 students $500,000 to invest 
### SOO JI LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Six Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students will allocate $500,000
over two years to student startups as in
vestors for the Bay Area Dorm Room
Fund, a 10-member investment team run
by students and funded by Philadelphia
based venture capital firm First Round
Capital.
The team comprises Adam Goldberg
'l5, Amanda Bradford M.B.A. 'l4, An
jney Midha 'l5, Bastiaan Janmaat
M.B.A. 'l3, Neal Khosla 'l5 and Ruby
Lee 'l3 M.S. 'l3, as well as four students
from the University of California, Berke
ley.
"Stanford and Cal too has more
access to the startup industry and the
[venture capital] world than schools in
New York or Philadelphia or anywhere
else in the world," said Dorm Room
Fund Director CeCe Cheng in ex
plaining the national organization's
decision to form a Bay Area invest
ment team.
Student investors were selected
through an application process
open only to Stanford and Berkeley
students. They are expected to stay
on the team until they graduate
and are responsible for choosing
their replacements.
Cheng said that she and other
Dorm Room Fund leaders were im
pressed with the intelligence of
Stanford applicants, as well as
their leadership, investment and
entrepreneurial skills.
"All [of] the six Stanford stu
dents came to me with ideas on how
the Dorm Room Fund was able to
impact a community like Stanford
that already has so many re
sources," Cheng said. "They were
confident that they could make
Dorm Room Fund stand out as a
brand."
A national effort
First Round Capital launched
the Dorm Room Fund program in
Philadelphia in September and
brought the program to New York
in the spring, drawing student in
vestors from Columbia University,
Princeton University and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, among
other schools.
The Philadelphia investment
team has made six investments
thus far, with an average invest
ment sum of $20,000. The Dorm
Room Fund will launch a Boston
team in the fall, and plans to ex
pand to several more cities within
the next few years.
"It's really the community and
network that we're building,"
Cheng said. "That's why we wanted
to launch multiple cities rapidly."
Applications closed for the Bay
Area fund on April 16. Midha, who

decided to apply for the program
after hearing about it from a friend
in the New York Dorm Room Fund,
said that he hopes to gain more ex
posure to Bay Area student compa
nies and help them develop into
full-fledged business through his
time on the team.
"I'd love to see us make a real
impact where students have to stop
thinking about full-on financing,
because we're filling the last miss
ing link when it comes to funding,"
Midha said.
According to Midha, one of the
most challenging aspects of work
ing with the fund is attempting to
examine his friends' startups from
an unbiased perspective.
"As a friend, you want to see
your friends succeed," Midha said.
"But as an investor, you need to
distance yourself from that rela
tionship and look at it objectively
as an idea."
Some Stanford investors have
struggled with balancing their re
sponsibilities at the fund with their
academic work, with three-hour
team meetings every Sunday and
other individual meetings prone to
disrupt their schedule.
Goldberg, who is taking 20 units
this quarter, described his schedule
as "fairly challenging." Goldberg
transferred to Stanford from
Berkeley, where he founded a fi
nance startup with friends but en
countered difficulty finding fund
ing.
"I feel that, as part of the Dorm
Room Fund, I can help people find
funding that didn't really have the

means to do so," Goldberg said.
"That's the problem that I like to
help solve."
Khosla emphasized the pres
sure of being responsible for a sig
nificant amount of someone else's
money, noting that the team has
sought to avoid failed investments
by closely analyzing the manage
ment of the companies they consid
er investing in.
"I guess the most nerve-wrack
ing thing is what if you make a
bunch of failed investments... it's
not our money, its First Round
Capital's money," Khosla said. "A
lot of what we look at is the team
that is running the startup and how
much faith we have in that team to
do well."
Janmaat, who is also co-presi
dent of the Graduate School of
Business' Entrepreneur Club, ex
pressed confidence in the investors'
skills and said he looks forward to
learning from fellow team mem
bers and discovering new ideas and
technologies.
"This is just one more way to
get to know other entrepreneurs in
the community and try to get great
Stanford startups funded," Jan
maat said. "It doesn't feel so much
like an additional responsibility as
much a complementary one."
Alhough the team has not solid
ified a set of guidelines to govern
its decision-making process, the
one company that the team has in
vested in so far was unanimously
approved. Startups can apply to
pitch to the team online.
Khosla noted that because the
investors come from a variety of
backgrounds and majors, the di
verse composition of the group
leads to "really different opinions
on different things."
Goldberg agreed, adding that
startups are especially difficult to
judge from an unbiased viewpoint.
"Comparing startups objective
ly is very difficult," Goldberg said.
"It's like comparing apples to or
anges."

ing link when it comes to funding,"
Midha said.
According to Midha, one of the
most challenging aspects of work
ing with the fund is attempting to
examine his friends' startups from
an unbiased perspective.
"As a friend, you want to see
your friends succeed," Midha said.
"But as an investor, you need to
distance yourself from that rela
tionship and look at it objectively
as an idea."
Some Stanford investors have
struggled with balancing their re
sponsibilities at the fund with their
academic work, with three-hour
team meetings every Sunday and
other individual meetings prone to
disrupt their schedule.
Goldberg, who is taking 20 units
this quarter, described his schedule
as "fairly challenging." Goldberg
transferred to Stanford from
Berkeley, where he founded a fi
nance startup with friends but en
countered difficulty finding fund
ing.
"I feel that, as part of the Dorm
Room Fund, I can help people find
funding that didn't really have the

means to do so," Goldberg said.
"That's the problem that I like to
help solve."
Khosla emphasized the pres
sure of being responsible for a sig
nificant amount of someone else's
money, noting that the team has
sought to avoid failed investments
by closely analyzing the manage
ment of the companies they consid
er investing in.
"I guess the most nerve-wrack
ing thing is what if you make a
bunch of failed investments... it's
not our money, its First Round
Capital's money," Khosla said. "A
lot of what we look at is the team
that is running the startup and how
much faith we have in that team to
do well."
Janmaat, who is also co-presi
dent of the Graduate School of
Business' Entrepreneur Club, ex
pressed confidence in the investors'
skills and said he looks forward to
learning from fellow team mem
bers and discovering new ideas and
technologies.
"This is just one more way to
get to know other entrepreneurs in
the community and try to get great
Stanford startups funded," Jan
maat said. "It doesn't feel so much
like an additional responsibility as
much a complementary one."
Alhough the team has not solid
ified a set of guidelines to govern
its decision-making process, the
one company that the team has in
vested in so far was unanimously
approved. Startups can apply to
pitch to the team online.
Khosla noted that because the
investors come from a variety of
backgrounds and majors, the di
verse composition of the group
leads to "really different opinions
on different things."
Goldberg agreed, adding that
startups are especially difficult to
judge from an unbiased viewpoint.
"Comparing startups objective
ly is very difficult," Goldberg said.
"It's like comparing apples to or
anges."

Six Stanford undergraduate and
graduate students will allocate $500,000
over two years to student startups as in
vestors for the Bay Area Dorm Room
Fund, a 10-member investment team run
by students and funded by Philadelphia
based venture capital firm First Round
Capital.
The team comprises Adam Goldberg
'l5, Amanda Bradford M.B.A. 'l4, An
jney Midha 'l5, Bastiaan Janmaat
M.B.A. 'l3, Neal Khosla 'l5 and Ruby
Lee 'l3 M.S. 'l3, as well as four students
from the University of California, Berke
ley.
"Stanford and Cal too has more
access to the startup industry and the
[venture capital] world than schools in
New York or Philadelphia or anywhere
else in the world," said Dorm Room
Fund Director CeCe Cheng in ex
plaining the national organization's
decision to form a Bay Area invest
ment team.
Student investors were selected
through an application process
open only to Stanford and Berkeley
students. They are expected to stay
on the team until they graduate
and are responsible for choosing
their replacements.
Cheng said that she and other
Dorm Room Fund leaders were im
pressed with the intelligence of
Stanford applicants, as well as
their leadership, investment and
entrepreneurial skills.
"All [of] the six Stanford stu
dents came to me with ideas on how
the Dorm Room Fund was able to
impact a community like Stanford
that already has so many re
sources," Cheng said. "They were
confident that they could make
Dorm Room Fund stand out as a
brand."
A national effort
First Round Capital launched
the Dorm Room Fund program in
Philadelphia in September and
brought the program to New York
in the spring, drawing student in
vestors from Columbia University,
Princeton University and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, among
other schools.
The Philadelphia investment
team has made six investments
thus far, with an average invest
ment sum of $20,000. The Dorm
Room Fund will launch a Boston
team in the fall, and plans to ex
pand to several more cities within
the next few years.
"It's really the community and
network that we're building,"
Cheng said. "That's why we wanted
to launch multiple cities rapidly."
Applications closed for the Bay
Area fund on April 16. Midha, who

decided to apply for the program
after hearing about it from a friend
in the New York Dorm Room Fund,
said that he hopes to gain more ex
posure to Bay Area student compa
nies and help them develop into
full-fledged business through his
time on the team.
"I'd love to see us make a real
impact where students have to stop
thinking about full-on financing,
because we're filling the last miss
ing link when it comes to funding,"
Midha said.
According to Midha, one of the
most challenging aspects of work
ing with the fund is attempting to
examine his friends' startups from
an unbiased perspective.

your friends succeed," Midha said.
