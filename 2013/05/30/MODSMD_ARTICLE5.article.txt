### SARAH MOORE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A documentary featuring the work of As
sistant Professor of Neurology Michelle Mon
je M.D. 'O4 Ph.D. 'O4 has been nominated for a
San Francisco/Northern California Emmy
Award.
The film, titled Dylan's Gift, tells the story
of Dylan Jewett, a five-year-old patient of
Monje's. In January 2009, Dylan died from
diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG),
an incurable tumor that afflicts between 150
and 200 children per year.
The documentary also follows the ground
breaking development of the first mouse-mod
el of DIPG, which Monje and her team were

able to create using cells from Dylan's autop
sied tumor.
Dylan's Gift is the ninth episode of Bench
to Bedside, a television series produced by
Foundation for Biomedical Research (FBR)
Media that focuses on people and animals who
have diseases with no known cure.
"The goal [of the documentary] was to
raise awareness of a horrible disease that is
killing children," said Liz Hodge, the series'
executive director. "People don't know about
brain cancer in general, let alone one [variant]
as rare as DIPG. It's always important to
spread awareness of diseases that are rare."
Although the film has only aired in Califor
nia so far, Hodge expects that it will be shown
worldwide by 2014. The San Francisco/North

ern California Emmy awards, in which Dy
lan's Gift is competing against two other en
tries in the informational/instructional-pro
gram/special category, will be announced on
June 15.
Dylan's donation
Monje became involved in the documen
tary after treating Dylan during her neuro
oncology fellowship in 2008. She had studied
DIPG in a lab for five years before deciding to
focus on the disease and attempt to develop
experimental models that could be used to
study it.
