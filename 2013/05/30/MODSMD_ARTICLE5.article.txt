## Documentary features work of neurologist 
### SARAH MOORE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A documentary featuring the work of As
sistant Professor of Neurology Michelle Mon
je M.D. 'O4 Ph.D. 'O4 has been nominated for a
San Francisco/Northern California Emmy
Award.
The film, titled Dylan's Gift, tells the story
of Dylan Jewett, a five-year-old patient of
Monje's. In January 2009, Dylan died from
diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG),
an incurable tumor that afflicts between 150
and 200 children per year.
The documentary also follows the ground
breaking development of the first mouse-mod
el of DIPG, which Monje and her team were

able to create using cells from Dylan's autop
sied tumor.
Dylan's Gift is the ninth episode of Bench
to Bedside, a television series produced by
Foundation for Biomedical Research (FBR)
Media that focuses on people and animals who
have diseases with no known cure.
"The goal [of the documentary] was to
raise awareness of a horrible disease that is
killing children," said Liz Hodge, the series'
executive director. "People don't know about
brain cancer in general, let alone one [variant]
as rare as DIPG. It's always important to
spread awareness of diseases that are rare."
Although the film has only aired in Califor
nia so far, Hodge expects that it will be shown
worldwide by 2014. The San Francisco/North

ern California Emmy awards, in which Dy
lan's Gift is competing against two other en
tries in the informational/instructional-pro
gram/special category, will be announced on
June 15.
Dylan's donation
Monje became involved in the documen
tary after treating Dylan during her neuro
oncology fellowship in 2008. She had studied
DIPG in a lab for five years before deciding to
focus on the disease and attempt to develop
experimental models that could be used to
study it.
"Anytime I can raise awareness about
DIPG, that's an important thing to
do for the patients," Monje said.
"What I really like about this docu
mentary is that it is focused on
honoring Dylan and his family and
recognizing the contribution that
they made, so I was very happy to
contribute in any way I could."
DIPG typically appears in chil
dren around age six, with initial
symptoms including crooked eyes,
having difficulty moving muscles of
the mouth and face or general inco
ordination and clumsiness.
The tumor is diagnosed by brain
stem neuroimaging, and the medi
an life expectancy following diagno
sis is around nine months. Almost
all patients die within two years.
After realizing the dire reality
of Dylan's cancer, his mother asked
Monje if there was any way to help
other children with the disease and
subsequently decided to donate his
tumor to research.
According to Monje, doctors do
not normally biopsy DIPG because
the tumor cells are entwined with
the normal tissue of the brain stem.
However, with Dylan's donation,
the researchers could conduct a
postmortem harvesting of the tu
mor within 18 hours, and were then
able to establish the first cell cul
ture of DIPG in the world.
The doctors then injected the
cells in the brain stems of mice,
creating a disease that looks al
most identical to human DIPG.
This development enabled re
searchers to study the cancer more
closely and investigate the effects
of different treatment options.
According to Monje, Dylan's
cells have been distributed to over
35 scientists around the world,
from Europe to Australia, allowing
more scientists to contribute to re
search on the cancer.
"We share our cell lines with
any researcher who is interested in

studying DIPG," Monje said.
"That's really been helpful in ener
gizing the research on DIPG.
There are a lot of people now work
ing on it because they have the
tools with which to study the dis
ease."
Since Monje's initial work with
Dylan's tumor, other families have
donated DIPG tumors for re
search, allowing six different cell
lines of the disease to be estab
lished.
"Having these different cell
lines is important because not
every tumor is the same, and it's
important to study a group of them
in order to make conclusions that
are applicable to the most pa
tients," Monje said.
Paul Fisher 'B4, head of the
School of Medicine's Division of
Child Neurology, supervised Mon
je's research on DIPG.
Fisher, who has diagnosed more
than 100 patients with DIPG,
framed Dylan's story as particular
ly compelling on two levels,
through both the generosity of a
family who wanted to contribute to
research to help save the lives of
other children and Monje's invest
ment of her time and energy to de
velop the model of the tumor.
"Michelle and the family have
been very generous in sharing the
cells with other labs," Fisher said.
"There's a lot of active testing right
now with different drug com
pounds, and in the future they will
be testing other types of therapy,
and having this model system in
place will be key to try to overcome
such a horrible track record in this
disease."
Hodge also emphasized the
generosity of the Jewett family,
noting that the Emmy nomination
is a tribute to their efforts and sac
rifices.
"It speaks to their generous
hearts, and the generous way that
they turned a tragedy into some
thing positive," Hodge said.
