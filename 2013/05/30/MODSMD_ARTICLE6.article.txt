## KZSU show to focus on Hispanics 'La Ventana del Mundo' looks to focus on local communities 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
KZSU, Stanford's student-run radio
station, will debut a radio program this
fall that is dedicated to addressing the ac
tivities of and issues facing the Hispanic
and Latino communities in the Bay Area.
The show, tentatively named "La Ven
tana del Mundo" or "The Window to the
World," is scheduled to open in the fall
with a weekly hour of content that in
cludes news, interviews and music.
Kedar Naik M.S. 'll Ph.D. 'l6, who
currently teaches a news and talk broad
casting class at KZSU, said that he origi
nally intended to develop a program en
tirely in Spanish to fill what he perceived
as a void in the station's programming.
"There are clearly people who speak
Spanish in the area," Naik said. "I see this
as something that the people need, and
the station needs it, I think, to fulfill its re
sponsibility to the community."
Several students and two local women
Isabel Jubes and Elizabeth Trachten
berg, who currently produce their own
Spanish-language podcast called "Flores
y Flowers" responded to Naik's email
outreach and took the training course this
spring.
The team has since decided to produce
a program that will likely include both
English and Spanish. Regardless of which
language each portion is in, the organizers
emphasized that they want to appeal to an
intelligent audience.
"I have a feeling that there is a certain
population most educated Latin people
that doesn't have a place because [the
radio] is all in English," Trachtenberg
said. "Or you have the most basic Latin
radio shows, which don't really speak to
us."
The team plans to have about 30 min
utes of talking and 30 minutes of music in
each show. The program will have a rotat
ing set of hosts to allow different voices to
get airtime.
Leonardo Leal 'l5, one involved
student, said he responded to
Naik's email because, despite being
very passionate about Latino cul
ture and music, he has struggled to
find radio shows that meet his inter
ests.
"We want this to be a more di
dactic type of show which will in
clude topics that are relevant to us
as a Hispanic ethnicity within the
U. 5.," Leal, who was born in Mexi
co, said. "We would touch on topics
like health, immigration issues and
politics as well as other relevant
news."
According to Jubes, other states
(like Florida or New York) seem to
have a richer Latino culture. She
said that "La Ventana" is intended
to be a window into what Bay Area
Latinos are doing and how they im
pact society.
Latino artists, both local and
abroad, will also be a prominent fo
cus of the program. The music por
tion of the show will include a di
verse lineup of Spanish music, in
stead of the mariachi that, accord
ing to the program's organizers,
dominates Hispanic radio.
"We also have rock in Spanish
and pop in Spanish and electronic
music so we want to include that in
the show," Leal said. "In fact, [we
want] not only to include it but to

emphasize it."
According to KSZU staff, the
station has attempted to run sever
al shows focusing on Hispanic cul
ture in the past, but few have lasted
more than a year or two.
Naik said that in order to make
"La Ventana" endure, the quality of
its programming must be high.
"If we were kind of flippant
about it and we just went ahead and
... [threw] something on and no one
listened, that would be a serious
problem," Naik said.
"This won't be important [sim
ply] because it's a novelty," he
added. "It will be important and rel
evant because it's a necessity."
The group plans to continue
working on the show during the
summer to ready themselves for the
fall because, according to Naik, pro
ducing an hour of pre-recorded con
tent can take up to 15 hours of
preparation. The station may also
run an experimental show over the
summer to gauge the audience's re
sponse.
For now, however, the team is fo
cused on learning the broadcasting
technology and finding material for
the fall.
"The U.S. Latino community, it
unifies us in away, but we are not
the same," Trachtenberg said. "We
are from different places, doing dif
ferent stuff, so everyone will be
very welcome to come and talk
about their experience and their
background."
