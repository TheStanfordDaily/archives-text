## Financial basics go untaught Administrators, students note lack of financial literacy advising 
### SAMANTHA NEUBER 
As the Class of 2013 prepares to leave
Stanford and enter the workforce, both
University administrators and students
have discussed a lack of sufficient advis
ing in financial literacy for students.
While a recent report by America's
Promise Alliance suggests that such a
lack of literacy could hinder students'
ability to take full advantage of finan
cial aid, Director of Financial Aid
Karen Cooper framed the issue as rare at
Stanford.
"Where I see issues is how students
manage the money they receive," Cooper
said, noting that financial literacy spans
students' experiences both before and af
ter graduation.

While Cooper described Stanford stu
dents as representing the spectrum of fi
nancial literacy, Mary Morrison, a stu
dent services administrator in the Finan
cial Aid Office, started a course in re
sponse to a perceived deficit in student
awareness.
"There were a certain number of stu
dents at Stanford who didn't know much
about how to handle money or the basics
of finances," Morrison said.
Morrison's course MS&E 41: Fi
nancial Literacy —is aimed at seniors
and other students preparing to fully
manage their own finances, teaching
them fundamentals such as types of in
surance, retirement plans and financial
vocabulary. According to Morrison, the
class has been fully enrolled at around
110 students for the past 14 years.
"I don't think we, Stanford, have a lot
of things in place for dealing with
the financial literacy around being
a student" Cooper acknowledged.
Jesus Salas 'l3, a student busi
ness advisor at the Career Develop
ment Center (CDC), shared a simi
lar perception of a lack of Universi
ty resources.
"I think Stanford assumes be
cause people are as intelligent as
they presume that they would fig
ure everything out... but we should
have some shaping around what
that means to be financially liter
ate," Salas said.
Salas recently helped organized
an event with the CDC that dealt
with preparing students for life af
ter Stanford. The event featured a
50-minute talk that covered the ba
sics of finances, an effort similar to
Morrison's financial literacy class.

Cooper and Morrison agreed
that more opportunities for finan
cial literacy education would be ad
vantageous for students. Morrison
suggested a series of seminars to
guide freshmen through the under
graduate experience while Cooper
advocated the formation of a stu
dent group and the encouragement
of greater peer mentoring.
