Emma Bakes, MD, PhD, died of metastatic
breast cancer during her senior year at the Stanford
University School of Medicine. Dr. Bakes was
an accomplished astrophysicist who worked at
NASA for 10 years prior to entering medical
school. In addition to her academic and professional
accomplishments, Dr. Bakes' dedicated much of
her time to various community and volunteer
services. Her selfless example inspired the altruistic
efforts of countless others, and because of her,
some of them have entered into the fields of science
and medicine. In recognition of her contributions
and accomplishments Stanford University and
the School of Medicine conferred her Medical
Doctorate posthumously with compassion and
kindness during Commencement 2011.
Dr. Bakes represented the best of what we can
be and to keep her inspirational flame ever lit,
especially for those in the medical profession,
her partner, Dr. Donald Mendoza and I one
of her former teachers at Stanford are asking
those interested in the service of others to honor
and follow her example by contributing to the
Campaign for Stanford Medical Center in her
memory.
Simply designate Dr. Bakes' name on your
check or add an explanatory note to your donation.
Fifty percent of the funds contributed in Dr. Bakes'
memory will be targeted for breast cancer research;
the other 50% will go towards the medical
education fund of the School of Medicine.
Thank you.
