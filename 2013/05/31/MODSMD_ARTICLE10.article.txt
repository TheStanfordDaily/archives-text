## Nanoparticles could help to purify water 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Communities with limited access
to clean water look set to benefit
from the recent fabrication of "syn
thetic nanoscavengers," which can
clear out harmful contaminants
from water, by an interdisciplinary
team of Stanford scientists.
"The filtering entity is static; the
water molecules are moving," ex
plained Shan Wang, professor of
materials science and engineering
and senior author of the study. "In
this technology, the nanoparticles
are moving in water, and the bacte
ria are moving in water... so the
killing action can be much faster."
The nanoscavengers, which are
coated with a layer of silver or tita
nium dioxide, randomly collide with
and kill bacteria while floating
around in contaminated water. Since
they have a large magnetic moment,
the particles can also be easily re
trieved.
"It's a very simple idea, but it
works beautifully," Wang said.
The team's next step is to extend
this technique to target other inor
ganic and organic contaminants,
such as heavy metals.
"If our nanoparticle is coated
with different materials, then we
can tackle all of those problems in
one," said Mingliang Zhang M.S. 'l2
Ph.D. 'l3, a doctoral candidate in

materials science and engineering
and co-first author of the study.
At this stage, however, the team
is limited in output by their produc
tion technique.
"We are still improving the tech
nique; we are looking for different
strategies to make this type of par
ticle," Zhang said.
Nanoprinting could offer one fu
turistic opportunity for producing
particles in a cost-efficient way.
"Eventually the material cost
will be the main cost the silver it
self but you can recycle it 10,000
times," said Xing Xie M.S. 'l2 Ph.D.
'l3, a doctoral candidate in civil and
environmental engineering and co
first author of the paper.
The team's research on water
purification also has other applica
tions.
"Water treatment is just one
use," Zhang said. "I'm also working
on using nanosynthesis to synthe
size a device for molecular imaging."
Shan said it has been particular
ly exciting to see the research's po
tential ability to fix significant real
world problems.
"I feel that being able to innovate
and come up with simple but really
interesting, out-of-the-box ideas to
solve pressing needs in society is re
ally exciting," Shan said.
