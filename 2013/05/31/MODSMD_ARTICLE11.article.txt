## QUON TO PLAY WITH CANADA 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
After wrapping up her
Cardinal career as
a four-year starter,
NSCAA first-team
All-American and captain of
the Stanford women's soccer
team, Rachel Quon was
drafted into the National
Women's Soccer League
(NWSL) by the Chicago Red
Stars, where she has played
every minute of the Red
Stars' first five games. Last
week, the outside back was
called into Canadian national
team training camp-a sur
prising move considering
that Quon has been a part of
the United States' youth na
tional system since she was
young. Canada will take on
the United States on June 2
in Toronto, but as of Thurs
day night Quon has not yet
received a release from FIFA
allowing her to represent
Canada in the match. Quon
spoke to The Daily from
Toronto to discuss her
change in allegiance, her
transition into professional
soccer and her planned re
turn to the Farm.

The Stanford Daily (TSD):
Can you explain how you
ended up in Canadian
camp?
Rachel Quon (RQ): I've been a
dual citizen ever since I was
born my dad's from Cana
da and it's always been an op
tion. I was fortunate enough
to be with the US team [be
fore] and I'm really thankful
for that stage. After talking to
my coaches and my family, I
couldn't really turn this op
portunity down. Canada is a
great team and I eventually
just want to play at the inter
national level and I hope I can
make an impact on this team.

TSD: How do you think it's

going to feel to play against
the United States next
week?
RQ: Right now, it's being
processed [with FIFA] so it's
kind of up in the air if I'm go
ing to be able to play. But ob
viously being against the
United States they're the
number one team it's go
ing to be a great game. It's in
Canada so it's a good oppor
tunity to play in front of a
Canadian crowd and it's just
kind of getting into that envi
ronment.

TSD: What are your ulti
mate goals for your soccer
career?
RQ: I'm just taking it one
step at a time, kind of show
casing myself to the coach
here and the team here
hopefully I can contribute
and go from there. My goal

in the future is to play at
the international level and
play against the best, hope
fully in the World Cup
that would be my ultimate
goal but I'm just kind of
taking it one step at a time
right now.

TSD: Why do you think the
Canadian national pro
gram gives you a better
chance at doing that?

RQ: Like I said, I talked to all
my coaches and the coach
here. [Canada] needs outside
backs and they play a system
where they want to keep the
ball a style of play that I
like. They want to play good
soccer and have attacking
outside backs and hopefully I
can contribute to that.

TSD: Switching to the pro
fessional league, how has
your experience been with

the Chicago Red Stars so far?

RQ: It's been great. It's defi
nitely different from college.
It's the first year for the
NWSL but the soccer is defi
nitely better, the speed of
play is quicker, more physical
and the women have more
experience. So it's great to be
learning from all of them and
to be playing at a top level for
a whole season, which is real
ly good for seeing what it's
like to play with international
players.

TSD: How did your time at
Stanford prepare you for
professional soccer?

RQ: Stanford was just a
great foundation. [Women's
soccer head coach] Paul [Rat
cliffe] and my teammates and
the rest of the coaching staff
really prepared me to play
quickly and simple and I
think that's what it comes
down to in soccer, just know
ing what you can do and be
ing confident. At Stanford
that's the way we wanted to
play and we wanted to keep
the ball. Playing at the top
level and being under pres
sure at multiple Finals Fours
was definitely great prepara
tion for that.

TSD: What has been the
hardest part of the transi
tion?

RQ: I mean it's definitely just
a lot quicker and more physi
cal right now. And getting to
know new players it's the
first year of the league so the
team is totally new, so we're
just trying to get to know
each other, our instincts and
strengths and weaknesses.

TSD: Did you graduate
from Stanford already or
are you still working on
that?

RQ: I took spring quarter off
but I'm coming back in the
fall and I will be helping with
the Stanford team as an un
dergraduate assistant and
then I'll be done after that.

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Former Stanford soccer standout Rachel Quon (above) is
currently training with the Canadian national team despite
spending her youth in the American development system.
After wrapping up her
Cardinal career as
a four-year starter,
NSCAA first-team
All-American and captain of
the Stanford women's soccer
team, Rachel Quon was
drafted into the National
Women's Soccer League
(NWSL) by the Chicago Red
Stars, where she has played
every minute of the Red
Stars' first five games. Last
week, the outside back was
called into Canadian national
team training camp-a sur
prising move considering
that Quon has been a part of
the United States' youth na
tional system since she was
young. Canada will take on
the United States on June 2
in Toronto, but as of Thurs
day night Quon has not yet
received a release from FIFA
allowing her to represent
Canada in the match. Quon
spoke to The Daily from
Toronto to discuss her
change in allegiance, her
transition into professional
soccer and her planned re
turn to the Farm.

The Stanford Daily (TSD):
Can you explain how you
ended up in Canadian
camp?
Rachel Quon (RQ): I've been a
dual citizen ever since I was
born my dad's from Cana
da and it's always been an op
tion. I was fortunate enough
to be with the US team [be
fore] and I'm really thankful
for that stage. After talking to
my coaches and my family, I
couldn't really turn this op
portunity down. Canada is a
great team and I eventually
just want to play at the inter
national level and I hope I can
make an impact on this team.

TSD: How do you think it's

going to feel to play against
the United States next
week?
RQ: Right now, it's being
processed [with FIFA] so it's
kind of up in the air if I'm go
ing to be able to play. But ob
viously being against the
United States they're the
number one team it's go
ing to be a great game. It's in
Canada so it's a good oppor
tunity to play in front of a
Canadian crowd and it's just
kind of getting into that envi
ronment.

TSD: What are your ulti
mate goals for your soccer
career?
RQ: I'm just taking it one
step at a time, kind of show
casing myself to the coach
here and the team here
hopefully I can contribute
and go from there. My goal

in the future is to play at
the international level and
play against the best, hope
fully in the World Cup
that would be my ultimate
goal but I'm just kind of
taking it one step at a time
right now.

TSD: Why do you think the
Canadian national pro
gram gives you a better
chance at doing that?

RQ: Like I said, I talked to all
my coaches and the coach
here. [Canada] needs outside
backs and they play a system
where they want to keep the
ball a style of play that I
like. They want to play good
soccer and have attacking
outside backs and hopefully I
can contribute to that.

TSD: Switching to the pro
fessional league, how has
your experience been with

the Chicago Red Stars so far?

RQ: It's been great. It's defi
nitely different from college.
It's the first year for the
NWSL but the soccer is defi
nitely better, the speed of
play is quicker, more physical
and the women have more
experience. So it's great to be
learning from all of them and
to be playing at a top level for
a whole season, which is real
ly good for seeing what it's
like to play with international
players.

TSD: How did your time at
Stanford prepare you for
professional soccer?

RQ: Stanford was just a
great foundation. [Women's
soccer head coach] Paul [Rat
cliffe] and my teammates and
the rest of the coaching staff
really prepared me to play
quickly and simple and I
think that's what it comes
down to in soccer, just know
ing what you can do and be
ing confident. At Stanford
that's the way we wanted to
play and we wanted to keep
the ball. Playing at the top
level and being under pres
sure at multiple Finals Fours
was definitely great prepara
tion for that.

TSD: What has been the
hardest part of the transi
tion?

RQ: I mean it's definitely just
a lot quicker and more physi
cal right now. And getting to
know new players it's the
first year of the league so the
team is totally new, so we're
just trying to get to know
each other, our instincts and
strengths and weaknesses.

TSD: Did you graduate
from Stanford already or
are you still working on
that?

RQ: I took spring quarter off
but I'm coming back in the
fall and I will be helping with
the Stanford team as an un
dergraduate assistant and
then I'll be done after that.
