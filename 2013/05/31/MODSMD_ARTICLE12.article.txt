# Looking back on the year that was
## 
### Sam Fisher 
Twenty-one years ago
today, I became a
sports fan. But
growing up as a
Philadelphia sports
fan, not many of those 21 years
were fruitful. And none were
even close to as good as this
past year.
I'm one of the lucky ones.
Each of my three years at
Stanford do I really only
have one left? has been
great. How many college stu
dents get to witness their team
play in three straight BCS
bowl games?
But as fun as my freshman
and sophomore years were,
this junior year has truly been
special. At the risk of sounding
like Emile Hirsch in "The Girl
Next Door," I wanted to dedi
cate my final print column of
the school year to the things I
will always remember from the
Stanford sports year that was.
Beating USC, again
Riding up to the third lev
el of the Stanford Stadium
press box before Stanford
took on USC in September,
an ESPN.com Pac-12 blog
ger who will remain nameless
and I had a conversation. I
believe I used some icebreak
er like, "Should be a good
game today."
"If USC plays well, they'll
win by 20," the blogger re
sponded.
Ah, if only the college
football world knew then
what it knows now. But then,
No. 2 USC was the clear fa
vorite, and it made the victo
ry so much sweeter.
The USC game marked
my third regular season
Stanford football game doing
play-by-play for KZSU. You
could say I was still in the
transition between fan and
media member ...
And when Matt Barkley's
desperate heave on fourth
down clinched Stanford's vic
tory, I lost it. I went full
Hawk Harrelson homer, and
it was awesome. My first big
upset call on the radio. I cer

tainly didn't know I'd call a
bigger one two months later.
Redemption
Autzen Stadium is an in
timidating place, especially
when it's dark, cold, windy
and rainy and you call the
game from the rooftop.
I should've known the
game would go well when I
had an almost identical inter
action with a different Stan
ford football writer, who
laughed at me when I said
that I thought the 21-point
spread in the Ducks' favor
was way too high.
But before you crown me a
genius and a hero, I must ad
mit that, unlike our editor in
chief Miles Bennett-Smith, I
picked Stanford to lose a close
game. The Ducks were just
too good at home, I thought.
I spent the game in a per
petual state of disbelief
not that the game was close,
but at how low the score was.
When doing play-by-play, es
pecially if one of the teams
plays as fast as Oregon does,
it's very hard to process
what's going on; you just
have to react to each play.
So when Alejandro Mal
donado's 41-yard field goal
bounced off the left upright, I
quickly realized what was
about to happen. Jordan
Williamson was going to have
a chance at redemption. And
when his 37-yarder snuck in
side the left upright, I lost it
again, though I promised my
self after USCI never would.
But the kick going in was
n't the moment I'll always re
member. That moment came
a few minutes later, when
Williamson came out of the
locker room to film a
postgame interview with me.
Jordan isn't just another
player, he's one of my friends.
My 2012 Fiesta Bowl memo
ry is giving Jordan a hug at
the airport and telling him
that I was there for him. It
made the hug on the field at
Oregon so much more spe
cial; it was the defining mo
ment of the year for me.

"Rags to Roses"
As you now know from
Joseph Beyda's preface, this
offseason, I have been a part of
the most exhilarating project of
my life with Joey and George
Chen: "Rags to Roses."
Being able to talk to play
ers and coaches from so
many different backgrounds
who played so many differ
ent roles in the path to the
Rose Bowl victory has been
simply awesome. I got to in
terview Andrew Luck, Jim
Harbaugh, David DeCastro,
three members of the Tunnel
Workers Union and so many
more key people.
But the thing that I'll al
ways remember from the
project is playing press cov
erage on Joey with George at
quarterback during our fre
quent football work breaks
on the street outside of The
Daily.
Maybe one day, someone
will write about our football
heroics.

believe I used some icebreak
er like, "Should be a good
game today."
"If USC plays well, they'll
win by 20," the blogger re
sponded.
Ah, if only the college
football world knew then
what it knows now. But then,
No. 2 USC was the clear fa
vorite, and it made the victo
ry so much sweeter.
The USC game marked
my third regular season
Stanford football game doing
play-by-play for KZSU. You
could say I was still in the
transition between fan and
media member ...
And when Matt Barkley's
desperate heave on fourth
down clinched Stanford's vic
tory, I lost it. I went full
Hawk Harrelson homer, and
it was awesome. My first big
upset call on the radio. I cer

tainly didn't know I'd call a
bigger one two months later.
Redemption
Autzen Stadium is an in
timidating place, especially
when it's dark, cold, windy
and rainy and you call the
game from the rooftop.
I should've known the
game would go well when I
had an almost identical inter
action with a different Stan
ford football writer, who
laughed at me when I said
that I thought the 21-point
spread in the Ducks' favor
was way too high.
But before you crown me a
genius and a hero, I must ad
mit that, unlike our editor in
chief Miles Bennett-Smith, I
picked Stanford to lose a close
game. The Ducks were just
too good at home, I thought.
I spent the game in a per
petual state of disbelief
not that the game was close,
but at how low the score was.
When doing play-by-play, es
pecially if one of the teams
plays as fast as Oregon does,
it's very hard to process
what's going on; you just
have to react to each play.
So when Alejandro Mal
donado's 41-yard field goal
bounced off the left upright, I
quickly realized what was
about to happen. Jordan
Williamson was going to have
a chance at redemption. And
when his 37-yarder snuck in
side the left upright, I lost it
again, though I promised my
self after USCI never would.
But the kick going in was
n't the moment I'll always re
member. That moment came
a few minutes later, when
Williamson came out of the
locker room to film a
postgame interview with me.
Jordan isn't just another
player, he's one of my friends.
My 2012 Fiesta Bowl memo
ry is giving Jordan a hug at
the airport and telling him
that I was there for him. It
made the hug on the field at
Oregon so much more spe
cial; it was the defining mo
ment of the year for me.

"Rags to Roses"
As you now know from
Joseph Beyda's preface, this
offseason, I have been a part of
the most exhilarating project of
my life with Joey and George
Chen: "Rags to Roses."
Being able to talk to play
ers and coaches from so
many different backgrounds
who played so many differ
ent roles in the path to the
Rose Bowl victory has been
simply awesome. I got to in
terview Andrew Luck, Jim
Harbaugh, David DeCastro,
three members of the Tunnel
Workers Union and so many
more key people.
But the thing that I'll al
ways remember from the
project is playing press cov
erage on Joey with George at
quarterback during our fre
quent football work breaks
on the street outside of The
Daily.
Maybe one day, someone
will write about our football
heroics.
