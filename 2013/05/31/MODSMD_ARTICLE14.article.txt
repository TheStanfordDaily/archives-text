## NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND We Are All... 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
My favorite class this quarte
has been a student-initiated
course called "Revolution
and the Filipino Diaspora: Exploring
Global Activism in Local Communi
ties." Our class focuses on the histories
of imperialism and resistance the Fil
ipino Diaspora has faced both at home
in the Philippines and at home in the
United States, allowing us to bring in
the contexts of our own organizing and
communities. The class has been espe
cially meaningful to me, crystallizing
many themes that have been on my
mind and providing me with greater
insight into the projects I would like to
spend my life developing.
Three weeks ago, we studied the
stories of institutional discrimination
facing three different sets of Filipinos
in the Bay Area.
In 2003, the TSA laid off a cohort of
workers from the Bay Area's three
major airports without any real expla
nation or compensation. The majority
of the workers were Filipino and some
today are fighting to protect the rights
of migrant workers around the state.
In 2006, Donita Ganzon and Jiffy Ja
vanella battled transphobia and immi
gration laws at the same time as the
United States Department of Home
land Security denied Ganzon a green
card after refusing to recognize her
marriage to Javanella. Ganzon was
born in the Philippines. Finally, in
2007, the San Jose police violently re
strained and tasered three members
of the Custodio family, again without
any explanation. The Custodios are a
Filipino-American family
What is striking about these cases
is the resonance they have with nearly
every other ethnic group in the United
States. Whether it be to blacks who
suffer the brunt of police brutality and
the incarceration system, or to Latinos
who are effectively forced to emigrate
due to the impact of North American
economic policies on their home states
and who face racism fueled by the
rhetoric of "illegal" immigration. The
scrutiny and suspicion Filipino immi
grants face from the state also hear
kens to the experiences of Arab and
South Asian people who have been
targeted by institutions and civilians
alike since 2001 and the expansion of
the United States' Terror of War- in the
Middle East.
Just a week later in another of my
classes, UC-Irvine professor Sohail
Daulatzai came to discuss "Improvis
ing the Hip Hop-Muslim Internation
al" along with Syrian-American rap
per Omar Offendum.
In response to the Boston Bomb
ings last month and the FBl's upgrade

of Black Panther member Assata
Shakur to its Most Wanted Terrorist
list, Daulatzai wrote a column posing
the question 'Are we all Muslim now?"
Dualatzai argues that any group
struggling for self-determination in
the United States is bound to be la
beled a threat to the state and has
historically been in the past. He calls
for us to resist making the claim, "But
I'm not a terrorist!" because it legit
imizes the state to narrow the scope of
dissent, expand surveillance and elimi
nate alternatives to war and exploitation.
"If there is a silver lining in this, it's
that for those black, Latino, Muslim,
Arab and South Asian communities
who are involved in political work that
is now or soon will be lumped into the
category of Terrorist,' this is an oppor
tunity for us to use our collective exclu
sion as suspect communities and deep
en our links and points of solidarity to
vigorously fight the violent forces that
target us in a different way," he con
cludes.
And this lesson is exactly what I
have been learning again and again
this quarter.
I first learned of the Third World
Liberation Front that developed at
San Francisco State in the 1960s at the
beginning of our student-initiated
course. TWLF united Black, Latino,
Asian, Filipino and Native American
students in the longest student strike
in American history that produced the
nation's first Ethnic Studies program.
Just weeks after that, I found my
self at SF State for a "From Pelican
Bay and Guantanamo to Palestine:
Prisons, Repression, Resistance" a
two-day teach-in that took place in the
historic Ethnic Studies building itself.
The event was the result of coopera
tion between nearly every ethnic and
activist group on the campus and in
the larger area from Muslim and
Arab students to black and Native stu
dent groups to Chicanas and Jewish
anti-Zionists, among others. The
teach-in represented an attempt be
tween these groups to find common
ground across communities and work
on some tangible action in spite of a lack
of M political agreement or cohesion.
While our communities do not have
exactly the same histories or face the
same internal or external issues, the
oppression and repression we face and
the resistance we bring are similar
enough to the point where we can and
should be able to say, "We are all Fil
ipino," "We are all Black," "We are all
Muslim," "We are all 'illegal'" and to
work together to challenge the ag
gression of the state against our
friends at home and our families
abroad.
I am confident that what we need is
a movement of students to fight the
colonialism, imperialism and racism
that our state perpetrates at such
large levels.
From San Francisco State to San

Jose State, from UC-Santa Cruz to
UC-Santa Barbara, folks I've met
across the state have expressed inter
est in rebuilding some sort of progres
sive action coalition. Our state has such
a rich history of student activism and
the stakes have never been higher
whether on mass incarceration, the
criminalization of our communities,
the occupation of indigenous and for
eign land or the death-by-drones the
US visits upon the MENA region.
The outbreak of violence against
women, queer and ethnic students at
our peer institutions this quarter alone
speaks to this need: from students at
Swarthmore urinating on the steps of
the Intercultural Center multiple
times this year to Dartmouth stu
dents threatening to rape and murder
students of color, women and queer
students in April; from fraternity
members at UC-Irvine releasing a
video featuring blackface at the end of
last month, to the LAPD's wrongful
arrest of black students at a USC par
ty this month. Our issues at Stanford
are not this extreme, but that does not
mean the issues don't exist, that we
have no obligation to respond to them
or that we cannot respond to them.
Our task is evident, but not neces
sarily simple: to build critical frame
works within our campus communities
and groups, to build actual solidarity
among our campus communities and
groups and to unite these networks
across our campuses in action.
This column possibly my last
this year serves as a clarion call to
students at Stanford, across the state
and across the country who are inter
ested in pursuing this conversation
over the summer and figuring out
what kind of work we might be able to
do over the coming years.

two-day teach-in that took place in the
historic Ethnic Studies building itself.
The event was the result of coopera
tion between nearly every ethnic and
activist group on the campus and in
the larger area from Muslim and
Arab students to black and Native stu
dent groups to Chicanas and Jewish
anti-Zionists, among others. The
teach-in represented an attempt be
tween these groups to find common
ground across communities and work
on some tangible action in spite of a lack
of M political agreement or cohesion.
While our communities do not have
exactly the same histories or face the
same internal or external issues, the
oppression and repression we face and
the resistance we bring are similar
enough to the point where we can and
should be able to say, "We are all Fil
ipino," "We are all Black," "We are all
Muslim," "We are all 'illegal'" and to
work together to challenge the ag
gression of the state against our
friends at home and our families
abroad.
I am confident that what we need is
a movement of students to fight the
colonialism, imperialism and racism
that our state perpetrates at such
large levels.
From San Francisco State to San

Jose State, from UC-Santa Cruz to
UC-Santa Barbara, folks I've met
across the state have expressed inter
est in rebuilding some sort of progres
sive action coalition. Our state has such
a rich history of student activism and
the stakes have never been higher
whether on mass incarceration, the
criminalization of our communities,
the occupation of indigenous and for
eign land or the death-by-drones the
US visits upon the MENA region.
The outbreak of violence against
women, queer and ethnic students at
our peer institutions this quarter alone
speaks to this need: from students at
Swarthmore urinating on the steps of
the Intercultural Center multiple
times this year to Dartmouth stu
dents threatening to rape and murder
students of color, women and queer
students in April; from fraternity
members at UC-Irvine releasing a
video featuring blackface at the end of
last month, to the LAPD's wrongful
arrest of black students at a USC par
ty this month. Our issues at Stanford
are not this extreme, but that does not
mean the issues don't exist, that we
have no obligation to respond to them
or that we cannot respond to them.
Our task is evident, but not neces
sarily simple: to build critical frame
works within our campus communities
and groups, to build actual solidarity
among our campus communities and
groups and to unite these networks
across our campuses in action.
This column possibly my last
this year serves as a clarion call to
students at Stanford, across the state
and across the country who are inter
ested in pursuing this conversation
over the summer and figuring out
what kind of work we might be able to
do over the coming years.

My favorite class this quarte
has been a student-initiated
course called "Revolution
and the Filipino Diaspora: Exploring
Global Activism in Local Communi
ties." Our class focuses on the histories
of imperialism and resistance the Fil
ipino Diaspora has faced both at home
in the Philippines and at home in the
United States, allowing us to bring in
the contexts of our own organizing and
communities. The class has been espe
cially meaningful to me, crystallizing
many themes that have been on my
mind and providing me with greater
insight into the projects I would like to
spend my life developing.
Three weeks ago, we studied the
stories of institutional discrimination
facing three different sets of Filipinos
in the Bay Area.
In 2003, the TSA laid off a cohort of
workers from the Bay Area's three
major airports without any real expla
nation or compensation. The majority
of the workers were Filipino and some
today are fighting to protect the rights
of migrant workers around the state.
In 2006, Donita Ganzon and Jiffy Ja
vanella battled transphobia and immi
gration laws at the same time as the
United States Department of Home
land Security denied Ganzon a green
card after refusing to recognize her
marriage to Javanella. Ganzon was
born in the Philippines. Finally, in
2007, the San Jose police violently re
strained and tasered three members
of the Custodio family, again without
any explanation. The Custodios are a
Filipino-American family
What is striking about these cases
is the resonance they have with nearly
every other ethnic group in the United
States. Whether it be to blacks who
suffer the brunt of police brutality and
the incarceration system, or to Latinos
who are effectively forced to emigrate
due to the impact of North American
economic policies on their home states
and who face racism fueled by the
rhetoric of "illegal" immigration. The
scrutiny and suspicion Filipino immi
grants face from the state also hear
kens to the experiences of Arab and
South Asian people who have been
targeted by institutions and civilians
alike since 2001 and the expansion of
the United States' Terror of War- in the
Middle East.
Just a week later in another of my
classes, UC-Irvine professor Sohail
Daulatzai came to discuss "Improvis
ing the Hip Hop-Muslim Internation
al" along with Syrian-American rap
per Omar Offendum.
In response to the Boston Bomb
ings last month and the FBl's upgrade

of Black Panther member Assata
Shakur to its Most Wanted Terrorist
list, Daulatzai wrote a column posing
the question 'Are we all Muslim now?"
Dualatzai argues that any group
struggling for self-determination in
the United States is bound to be la
beled a threat to the state and has
historically been in the past. He calls
for us to resist making the claim, "But
I'm not a terrorist!" because it legit
imizes the state to narrow the scope of
dissent, expand surveillance and elimi
nate alternatives to war and exploitation.
"If there is a silver lining in this, it's
that for those black, Latino, Muslim,
Arab and South Asian communities
who are involved in political work that
is now or soon will be lumped into the
category of Terrorist,' this is an oppor
tunity for us to use our collective exclu
sion as suspect communities and deep
en our links and points of solidarity to
vigorously fight the violent forces that
target us in a different way," he con
cludes.
And this lesson is exactly what I
have been learning again and again
this quarter.
I first learned of the Third World
Liberation Front that developed at
San Francisco State in the 1960s at the
beginning of our student-initiated
course. TWLF united Black, Latino,
Asian, Filipino and Native American
students in the longest student strike
in American history that produced the
nation's first Ethnic Studies program.
Just weeks after that, I found my
self at SF State for a "From Pelican
Bay and Guantanamo to Palestine:
Prisons, Repression, Resistance" a
two-day teach-in that took place in the
historic Ethnic Studies building itself.
