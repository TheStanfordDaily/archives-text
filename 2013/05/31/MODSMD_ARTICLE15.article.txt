## Droning On 
### Holly Moeller 
Two days ago, a United States
military drone operation in
Pakistan killed another Taliban
official. The mission was only the lat
est in a series of more than 350 drone
strikes in Pakistan since 2004. Drones
play an increasingly important role in
US Military operations, where they
are used both for reconnaissance and
remote attacks over the Middle
East's notoriously difficult terrain.
While their omnipresence in me
dia coverage of the War on Terror
may have permanently associated the
word "drone" with "military," the in
genious pieces of winged technology
actually play diverse roles in civilian
life, as well. Much as satellites, digital
images and other pieces of military
technology have trickled down into
everyday life, drones, too, are making
the transition.
We've long understood the useful
ness of eyes in the sky. That's why the
launch of the Soviet Union's Sputnik
satellite spurred a flurry of national
istic anxiety and innovation. Today,
we ecologists use a slew of satellites
to collect images from all over Earth's
surface. These images allow us to
measure things like changes in sea ice
cover, the extent of deforestation and
the amount of photosynthesis that's
going on in the ocean. We also fly air
planes loaded with special sensors to
map plant species, detect wildlife and
track animal populations.
These technologies have trans
formed ecology by giving us new spa
tial tools with which to conduct our
science. Need to calculate the surface
area of the planet covered by desert?
Break out the satellite images. Want
to know how many penguin pairs are
nesting in that Antarctic colony? Take
a magnifying glass to your aerial pho
tographs.
But as exciting as all these new
data sources are, we still hunger for
more. Even as technology advances,
data collection still requires a careful
ly gauged tradeoff of financial ex
pense, spatial resolution and time
consuming legwork on the ground.
For example, satellite images, while
astounding in their global coverage,
usually don't have the resolution to
pick out individual trees â€”or even
icebergs. Manned aircraft are incred
ibly expensive to build and fly. And
walking hundreds of transects over
difficult terrain can provide heaps of
useful, specific data but little overall
perspective.
Enter the drone.
Rebranded "Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles" or UAVs for their nonmili
tary lives, they range in size from a
few ounces to a few dozen pounds.
Price scales accordingly, but perfectly
serviceable models can be had for
just a couple thousand dollars or
ders of magnitude cheaper than
manned planes or helicopters. Be
cause no human lives are at stake
during their operation, UAVs can un-

dertake riskier tasks, like tracking
forest fires or flying into the face of
hurricanes. Their size and maneuver
ability means they can fly lower, cap
turing higher-resolution data than
satellites or even airplanes.
Of course, much of the promise of
UAVs is still just that: promises. As
the vehicles themselves become more
efficient, and the sensor equipment
they carry becomes lightweight and
more affordable, their usage will
quickly expand. Indeed, they're al
ready being used, both for basic eco
logical science and for conservation
biology. South African game reserves
use drones to track the movements of
poachers; the Sea Shepherd Conser
vation Society uses them to track the
Japanese whaling fleet.
Domestically, UAYs will likely see
a lot of use in America's agricultural
heartland. They can be put to very
practical use by farmers, who can use
the drones to quickly survey their
crops for insect damage or drought
stress, or track animal herds as they
roam grazing land. By giving farmers
the means to rapidly and efficiently
respond to changes on their land,
drones will save time, money and nat
ural resources.
Drones can also be used for a vari
ety of other environmental monitor
ing purposes, like tracking compli
ance with regulations, monitoring
pipelines for signs of spills and keep
ing tabs on the spread of pollutants.
And animal rights activists are al
ready planning flyovers of factory
farms to monitor animal treatment
practices.
Obviously, the use of drones could
quickly get out of hand. Virginia and
Idaho are putting laws on the books
to protect citizen privacy; other
groups worry about what new clutter
in US aii-space might mean for the
safety of manned aircraft.
The Federal Aviation Adminis
tration is slated to begin issuing
commercial permits for UAVs in
2015. Many legal battles over priva
cy will surely take place before, and
after, that deadline. But either way,
expect the use of drones in science
and elsewhere to increase ex
ponentially.
