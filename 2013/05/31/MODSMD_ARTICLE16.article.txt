# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## Fossil fuel divestment is counterproductive 
### 
Dear Editor,
Students promoting the Fossil
Free campaign appear to have not
properly researched the reasons
for, or implications of, their cam
paign. If they had done their home
work, they would realize that:

1) Today's climate change is not out
of bounds with the natural vari
ability that geologists see in the
past.
2) The idea that dangerous climate
change will happen because of
emissions from human activities
is merely an hypothesis, and one

that is looking increasingly im
probable as science advances.
3) If dangerous change were happen
ing, then the proper response would
be to increase our use of hydrocar
bon fuels, especially coal, the cheap
est and most abundant source of
power.

In the event of climate prob
lems, however caused, more elec
tricity would be needed to handle
greater demands for air condition
ing and heating. More power would
be required to irrigate lands, build
dikes, strengthen public infra
structure and relocate populations
living on flood plains or at risk
from tornadoes and hurricanes.
Yet the Fossil Free campaign

does not suggest how we will gen
erate this extra power. They are
simply against hydrocarbon fuels.
This makes no sense. Moving
away from our strongest power
sources because of climate con
cerns is analogous to a ship captain
ordering his crew into lifeboats
when a severe storm is approach
ing. It would be suicide to abandon
ship exactly when the protection of
a sturdy vessel is most needed. Sim
ilarly, it is suicide to quickly move
away from today's dependable en
ergy sources, no matter what the
climate does.
