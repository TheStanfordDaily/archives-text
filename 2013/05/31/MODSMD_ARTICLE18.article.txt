# STAY SAFE
## Sex with the The 						Stanford Tree talks STI testing with Qpid.me 
### 
It is midnight as you stumble out
of the sweat-infused, crowded
bar. Your ears ring from drunk
en whispers and cheesy-yet-fabu
lous sing-along songs. The fresh air
outside gives you a few moments of
much-needed clarity after your dose
of one-too-many designer cocktails.
But you are not alone; next to you is
a guy or gal who you want to take

home. You have been kissing, and
their use of just the right amount of
tongue makes you want to take
them back to your place and ravage
them. Stop. You just met a random
person at the bar: how can you trust
that he or she is sexually safe?
I have always been that girl
who makes it a requirement for my
partner to get tested before we can

be intimate together. Though I feel
safer about this in the long run, the
necessary amount of self-control is
difficult to sustain, especially if I am
in the embrace of a man and most
of the blood that runs through my
brain has swiftly surged and swelled
elsewhere. What if asking the ques
tion, "Have you been tested?"
became faster, easier, safer and more

reliable?
Qpidmeis new resource that
works with your health care provider
to share safely your most recent STI
results with your potential partner,
lover or one-night stand. Already fea
tured on CNN, The Huffington Post,
CBS News and in The New York Post,
Qpid.me boasts: "Spread the love,
[and] nothing else."

Creator and CEO Ramin
Bastani started Qpid.me when a
girl slapped him in the face after
he asked if she'd been tested.
According to Bastani and
Qpid.me, the "... key component
missing in HIV and STD preven
tion today is shareability. To make


informed sexual health decisions, you
must not only be informed about your
own health, but also about your partner's
health as well. We enable you to privately
share your STD status however you
choose. We believe that sharing is a good
thing and that it can lead to better sexual
health decisions, more (safe) sex and fewer
STDs."

Qpid.me also features maps that show
all of the local testing centers in your area,
making it even easier and safer to stay on
top of your health and your partner.
I was so excited to join this revolu
tionary service that I immediately logged
on and created a profile. It was easy to sign
up; the first step requires you to sign a
HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act) agreement online,
requesting your recent STI results from
your health care provider. Normally,
Qpid.me helps to make this process
informative, fast and easy, but for some
reason Vaden denied my request for a
healthier sex life.
Upon further investigation, one Vaden
representative told me, "Our obligation and
priority is to see that the student has
his/her health information if he/she wants
or needs it. We release information to the
student, and the student can then pass the
information on to the third party. There
are, of course exceptions, most of which
involve medical treatment or legal requests.
A disclosure to a 'third party health source'
such as the one you describe below is a
requested disclosure with authorization
HIPAA considers this type of disclosure to
be "permissible" but not required."
Though Vaden allowed me to view my
records, they did not allow

me to release them to a
third party (though this is
allowed and encouraged
by HIPAA law), and

Qpid.me smartly does not accept medical
results unless they come directly from a doc
tor. Unfortunately, a sketchy and untrust
worthy person could alter their own records
and then send them in. But alas, Qpid.me
has thought of everything to ensure their
customers' safety and privacy. Qpid.me only
accepts valid and accurate secure records
directly from a testing center.
I had the privilege to interview David
Harlow, a seasoned and accomplished
healthcare privacy and security attorney,
whose expertise includes being a charter
member of the external Advisory Board of
the Mayo Clinic Center for Social Media,
and recipient of an "Rx for Excellence
Heroes From the Field" award in 2010 by
the weekly law publication,
The Massachusetts Medical Law Report.
The basic idea behind HIPAA is "to protect
the individual," Harlow argues.
" [What is best for the patient] is not
for the clinic to decide," notes Harlow.
Harlow continues that there is no down
side to releasing authorized medical
records to a third party like Qpid.me; the
key of HIPAA law is to protect the patient,
not healthcare providers who may not
morally support a new company such as
Qpid.me.
Qpid.me has already worked with
Stanford rival schools UCLA and USC, who
have not only been legally supportive, but
have also praised this new significant resource
that can help keep their students even
safer. Perhaps it is just my former Tree self
who feels competitive, but I like it when
Stanford wins; from football, to tennis to psy
chology, Stanford has always strived for the
best and pioneered in every field. Why stop
now? As a graduating senior, I would like to
contribute to my beloved alma mater to help
protect the overall health of all future genera
tions of Stanford students.

them. Stop. You just met a random
person at the bar: how can you trust
that he or she is sexually safe?
I have always been that girl
who makes it a requirement for my
partner to get tested before we can

be intimate together. Though I feel
safer about this in the long run, the
necessary amount of self-control is
difficult to sustain, especially if I am
in the embrace of a man and most
of the blood that runs through my
brain has swiftly surged and swelled
elsewhere. What if asking the ques
tion, "Have you been tested?"
became faster, easier, safer and more

reliable?
Qpidmeis new resource that
works with your health care provider
to share safely your most recent STI
results with your potential partner,
lover or one-night stand. Already fea
tured on CNN, The Huffington Post,
CBS News and in The New York Post,
Qpid.me boasts: "Spread the love,
[and] nothing else."

Creator and CEO Ramin
Bastani started Qpid.me when a
girl slapped him in the face after
he asked if she'd been tested.
According to Bastani and
Qpid.me, the "... key component
missing in HIV and STD preven
tion today is shareability. To make


informed sexual health decisions, you
must not only be informed about your
own health, but also about your partner's
health as well. We enable you to privately
share your STD status however you
choose. We believe that sharing is a good
thing and that it can lead to better sexual
health decisions, more (safe) sex and fewer
STDs."

Qpid.me also features maps that show
all of the local testing centers in your area,
making it even easier and safer to stay on
top of your health and your partner.
I was so excited to join this revolu
tionary service that I immediately logged
on and created a profile. It was easy to sign
up; the first step requires you to sign a
HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act) agreement online,
requesting your recent STI results from
your health care provider. Normally,
Qpid.me helps to make this process
informative, fast and easy, but for some
reason Vaden denied my request for a
healthier sex life.
Upon further investigation, one Vaden
representative told me, "Our obligation and
priority is to see that the student has
his/her health information if he/she wants
or needs it. We release information to the
student, and the student can then pass the
information on to the third party. There
are, of course exceptions, most of which
involve medical treatment or legal requests.
A disclosure to a 'third party health source'
such as the one you describe below is a
requested disclosure with authorization
HIPAA considers this type of disclosure to
be "permissible" but not required."
Though Vaden allowed me to view my
records, they did not allow

me to release them to a
third party (though this is
allowed and encouraged
by HIPAA law), and

Qpid.me smartly does not accept medical
results unless they come directly from a doc
tor. Unfortunately, a sketchy and untrust
worthy person could alter their own records
and then send them in. But alas, Qpid.me
has thought of everything to ensure their
customers' safety and privacy. Qpid.me only
accepts valid and accurate secure records
directly from a testing center.
I had the privilege to interview David
Harlow, a seasoned and accomplished
healthcare privacy and security attorney,
whose expertise includes being a charter
member of the external Advisory Board of
the Mayo Clinic Center for Social Media,
and recipient of an "Rx for Excellence
Heroes From the Field" award in 2010 by
the weekly law publication,
The Massachusetts Medical Law Report.
The basic idea behind HIPAA is "to protect
the individual," Harlow argues.
" [What is best for the patient] is not
for the clinic to decide," notes Harlow.
Harlow continues that there is no down
side to releasing authorized medical
records to a third party like Qpid.me; the
key of HIPAA law is to protect the patient,
not healthcare providers who may not
morally support a new company such as
Qpid.me.
Qpid.me has already worked with
Stanford rival schools UCLA and USC, who
have not only been legally supportive, but
have also praised this new significant resource
that can help keep their students even
safer. Perhaps it is just my former Tree self
who feels competitive, but I like it when
Stanford wins; from football, to tennis to psy
chology, Stanford has always strived for the
best and pioneered in every field. Why stop
now? As a graduating senior, I would like to
contribute to my beloved alma mater to help
protect the overall health of all future genera
tions of Stanford students.
