# Before Midnight
## MOVIES Linklater film shows true relationship highs and lows 
### Alexandra Heeney | STAFF WRITER 
Writer-director Richard
Linklater's "Before..."
series began 18 years
ago with the smart independent
film "Before Sunrise" not the
usual fodder for multiple sequels
and has picked up every nine
years since, each film deeper, darker,
stronger and more mature than the
last. We first met the characters in
their 20s, revisited them in their 30s
in "Before Sunset," and they return
to cinemas now in their 40s in
"Before Midnight" they've
grown and developed yet in some
essential ways haven't changed at all.
In "Before Sunrise," Jesse
(Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie
Delpy) met on a train in Europe,
where he persuaded her to get off
in Vienna to spend the night walk
ing and talking; they had an instant
spark and connection, and intelli
gent conversation flowed easily.
They flirted, joked, shared philoso
phies and parted with a promise to
meet again in six months at the
train station.
They meet again in "Before
Sunset," this time for an afternoon
in Paris at a reading of Jesse's book
about their night together; he
claims to have written it to find her
again. No longer the carefree youth
they were in their 20s, they have both
changed. She's a cynic about the state
of the world, crusading for the envi
ronment in her job, with a knack for
manipulation. He's a successful but
unhappily married writer, with a
son he can't imagine leaving.
The memory of their night
together, into which they poured
all their romantic ideals, has haunt
ed them both with thoughts of

missed opportunities and what-ifs.
In "Before Sunset," they update and
revise their memories with the new
knowledge of how important that
night was for both of them. Even
nine years later, they still connect
effortlessly. This film, too, ends on
an ambiguous note: Impersonating
Nina Simone, Celine exclaims,
"Baby, you're going to miss that
plane," and, rubbing his wedding
ring, Jesse replies, "I know."
Fast-forward nine years, and
we have "Before Midnight." Jesse
and Celine are now a couple living
in Paris, having gotten together just
after "Before Sunset" ended, and
they have two children together.
Whereas in the first two films pass
ing time only brought them closer
to their inevitable separation, in
"Before Midnight" they have the
calm that comes with knowing they

will spend the rest of their lives
together. Their story is no longer
one of possibility, but of shared his
tory and lives, built-up resentments
and the complications of a long
term relationship with the person
you thought was your soul mate.
The stories of "Before Sunrise"
and "Before Sunset," which once
seemed so romantic, now haunt
them. Celine is no longer charmed
by Jesse's idealized fictional
accounts of their time together,
which only draw attention to the
clash between their respective ver
sions of reality. His likeness to a
horny American teenager and her
propensity for mind games, once
parts of their flirtation, are now
points of contention.
"Before Midnight" shares the
same trademarks as the first two
films: heavily scripted, witty and

thoughtful dialogue fill the scenes,
long takes which have gotten even
longer lend realism and the com
peting charisma and aggression of
the couple keep the conversation
always engaging and real. It's a testa
ment to the strength of the writing by
Delpy, Hawke and Linklater, the per
formances perfected through
rehearsal and Linklater's directorial
vision that the long takes increase
the intensity and complexity of the
action rather than dull it; every
action feels real and motivated.
We see the two main charac
ters in new contexts, which helps
us better understand them as indi
viduals and in relation to one
another. In the previous films, all
we knew of their lives was what
they told the audience, but here we
can form our own opinions about
Jesse and Celine's relationship. We

see Jesse alone with his son and
with some male colleagues, we see
Celine with other women, we see
the two of them as a couple at din
ner with friends and we see the two
of them alone, both in easy conver
sation and in intimate moments of
sexual passion which transform
into vile fighting.
The two still have the same
ease with each other as when they
first met, only now it's magnified:
They have the shorthand of people
who know each other well. They
still love talking to each other, still
tread on similar conversational
topics, still find each other attrac
tive and hold hands, and they can
still hold the audience's attention
in 20-minute uncut single takes.
When they fight, they yell half
truths at each other, aimed to
wound but still with humor. They
know each other well, and we won
der if that's becoming a problem.
The film takes place during a
stressful day. Jesse has just said
goodbye to his son, who was visit
ing and who is the collateral dam
age of his relationship with Celine.
It's the last day of their vacation,
they are soon returning to their
real lives and Jesse's grandfather
has just died. Are their fights life
changing catharses that have been
a long time coming, or merely the
product of heightened emotions
that will pass? We're left to form
our own opinions, and it would
take welcome repeated viewings to
fully understand the complexity of
emotions expressed. Hopefully,

nine years from now, we'll revisit
these characters again and discover
definitively what happened next.

action feels real and motivated.
We see the two main charac
ters in new contexts, which helps
us better understand them as indi
viduals and in relation to one
another. In the previous films, all
we knew of their lives was what
they told the audience, but here we
can form our own opinions about
Jesse and Celine's relationship. We

see Jesse alone with his son and
with some male colleagues, we see
Celine with other women, we see
the two of them as a couple at din
ner with friends and we see the two
of them alone, both in easy conver
sation and in intimate moments of
sexual passion which transform
into vile fighting.
The two still have the same
ease with each other as when they
first met, only now it's magnified:
They have the shorthand of people
who know each other well. They
still love talking to each other, still
tread on similar conversational
topics, still find each other attrac
tive and hold hands, and they can
still hold the audience's attention
in 20-minute uncut single takes.
When they fight, they yell half
truths at each other, aimed to
wound but still with humor. They
know each other well, and we won
der if that's becoming a problem.
The film takes place during a
stressful day. Jesse has just said
goodbye to his son, who was visit
ing and who is the collateral dam
age of his relationship with Celine.
It's the last day of their vacation,
they are soon returning to their
real lives and Jesse's grandfather
has just died. Are their fights life
changing catharses that have been
a long time coming, or merely the
product of heightened emotions
that will pass? We're left to form
our own opinions, and it would
take welcome repeated viewings to
fully understand the complexity of
emotions expressed. Hopefully,

nine years from now, we'll revisit
these characters again and discover
definitively what happened next.

Writer-director Richard
Linklater's "Before..."
series began 18 years
ago with the smart independent
film "Before Sunrise" not the
usual fodder for multiple sequels
and has picked up every nine
years since, each film deeper, darker,
stronger and more mature than the
last. We first met the characters in
their 20s, revisited them in their 30s
in "Before Sunset," and they return
to cinemas now in their 40s in
"Before Midnight" they've
grown and developed yet in some
essential ways haven't changed at all.
In "Before Sunrise," Jesse
(Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie
Delpy) met on a train in Europe,
where he persuaded her to get off
in Vienna to spend the night walk
ing and talking; they had an instant
spark and connection, and intelli
gent conversation flowed easily.
They flirted, joked, shared philoso
phies and parted with a promise to
meet again in six months at the
train station.
They meet again in "Before
Sunset," this time for an afternoon
in Paris at a reading of Jesse's book
about their night together; he
claims to have written it to find her
again. No longer the carefree youth
they were in their 20s, they have both
changed. She's a cynic about the state
of the world, crusading for the envi
ronment in her job, with a knack for
manipulation. He's a successful but
unhappily married writer, with a
son he can't imagine leaving.
The memory of their night
together, into which they poured
all their romantic ideals, has haunt
ed them both with thoughts of

missed opportunities and what-ifs.
In "Before Sunset," they update and
revise their memories with the new
knowledge of how important that
night was for both of them. Even
nine years later, they still connect
effortlessly. This film, too, ends on
an ambiguous note: Impersonating
Nina Simone, Celine exclaims,
"Baby, you're going to miss that
plane," and, rubbing his wedding
ring, Jesse replies, "I know."
Fast-forward nine years, and
we have "Before Midnight." Jesse
and Celine are now a couple living
in Paris, having gotten together just
after "Before Sunset" ended, and
they have two children together.
Whereas in the first two films pass
ing time only brought them closer
to their inevitable separation, in
"Before Midnight" they have the
calm that comes with knowing they

will spend the rest of their lives
together. Their story is no longer
one of possibility, but of shared his
tory and lives, built-up resentments
and the complications of a long
term relationship with the person
you thought was your soul mate.
The stories of "Before Sunrise"
and "Before Sunset," which once
seemed so romantic, now haunt
them. Celine is no longer charmed
by Jesse's idealized fictional
accounts of their time together,
which only draw attention to the
clash between their respective ver
sions of reality. His likeness to a
horny American teenager and her
propensity for mind games, once
parts of their flirtation, are now
points of contention.
"Before Midnight" shares the
same trademarks as the first two
films: heavily scripted, witty and

thoughtful dialogue fill the scenes,
long takes which have gotten even
longer lend realism and the com
peting charisma and aggression of
the couple keep the conversation
always engaging and real. It's a testa
ment to the strength of the writing by
Delpy, Hawke and Linklater, the per
formances perfected through
rehearsal and Linklater's directorial
vision that the long takes increase
the intensity and complexity of the
action rather than dull it; every
action feels real and motivated.
We see the two main charac
ters in new contexts, which helps
us better understand them as indi
viduals and in relation to one
another. In the previous films, all
