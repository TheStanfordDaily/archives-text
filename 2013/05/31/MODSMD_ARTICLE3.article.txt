# Draw demand rises again
## Surge in number of students left on housing waitlist after first round 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
A steady increase in the demand for on-eampus
housing over the last decade has led to progressively
lower cutoff numbers and more students unassigned in
the Draw's first round.
According to online statistics provided by Residen
tial & Dining Enterprises (R&DE) Student Housing,
the draw number of the last person assigned in the first
round this year was 2734 for men and 2745 for women.
This year, 4,287 students applied for housing and 174
students who were guaranteed housing went unas
signed, with both figures the highest in the past decade.
Rodger Whitney, executive director of R&DE Stu
dent Housing, noted in an email to The Daily that a va
riety of factors had contributed to the rise in applica
tions, including more unguaranteed fifth year students
seeking on-campus housing, a competitive local rental
market and the high yield rate of the Class of 2016.
Whitney noted that last year's highest first round
Draw cutoff number had been 2871 for men, in a year
where 81 fewer undergraduates had been assigned in

order to make room for the incoming class.
"While demand has increased somewhat, it is im
portant to note that R&DE Student Housing has al
ways met the undergraduate guarantee and will do so
again for the 13-14 academic year," Whitney wrote.
According to Whitney, the percentage of students
guaranteed housing yet unassigned in the Draw this
year is close to the normal rate. He expects spaces will
open up over the summer due to students studying
abroad or taking leaves of absences and to the smaller
size of the Class of 2017.
"The incoming Class of 2017 is by design smaller
than the Class of 2016 so that they will balance each
other in the system going forward," Whitney wrote.
Whitney added that R&DE has been working with
campus partners to design a new student residence at
Manzanita Park, which will house 125 upper class stu
dents. The project is scheduled to be completed in time
for the 2014-15 academic year. A second project to add
two wings at Lagunita Court is in the design phase,
pending approval from the Board of Trustees.
