## Florence waives language requirement Students traveling in winter will not have Italian prereq. 
### CLARISSE PERALTA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram (BOSP) recently waived the
language requirement to study
abroad in Florence in Winter Quar
ter 2014 in an effort to encourage
more students to apply.
Previously, students had to com
plete the equivalent of a year's
study in Italian, with preference giv
en to students with additional lan
guage study.
"We are always looking for op
portunities to challenge students
and try out different ways for stu
dents who think that they cannot do
overseas studies," said Ramon Sal
divar, BOSP director. "We don't
want to stay stuck on our old pat
terns."
The decision to waive the lan
guage requirement was also partial
ly made in response to the Study of
Undergraduate Education at Stan
ford (SUES) report.
"The SUES report indicates that

the University should encourage
more students to participate in one
of its Overseas Programs by remov
ing the 'significant barriers to study
abroad,"' wrote Ermelinda Cam
pani, director of the Florence pro
gram, in an email to The Daily.
Campani framed the language
prerequisite as potentially such a
barrier, noting that the program ex
pects an increase in the number of
applicants. She described winter
quarter as the best time for stu
dents to experience Florence.
"We want more students in the
winter because it is the ideal time to
be here: There are no tourists and
the city goes back to belonging to
the Florentines," Campani wrote.
Campani also cited the pro
gram's new base in Palazzo Capponi
and certain academic opportunities
only offered in winter quarter as po
tentially driving the increase in ap
plications.
"We just inaugurated our new fa
cilities and they are so special that
we want as many Stanford students
as possible to experience and take
advantage of them," Campani
wrote.
However, Elizabeth Bernhardt-

Kamil, director of the Stanford Uni
versity language center, expressed
concern that the language prerequi
site's removal might be problematic.
"It is never a good idea to lower
academic standards, especially
when language requirements are
scapegoated for student lack of in
terest," Bernhardt-Kamil said. "I
don't really think anyone benefits
from that."
Last academic year, an average
of 133 students enrolled in Italian
language programs, a slight de
crease from previous years. In 2009-
2010, there were 181 students en
rolled and in 2010-2011 there were
156.
Kamil added that waiving the
language requirement for overseas
programs had been done before for
the Berlin and Beijing programs, in
both cases also due to the low num
ber of applications.
"We know from research that
students who go to any non-English
speaking country with some lan
guage, make progress," Bernhardt-
Kamil said. "But it is never smart to
go to a non-English speaking coun
try, not knowing some of the lan
guage."
Ashley Geo 'l5, who will be in
Florence in the fall, was initially
disappointed by BOSP's decision.
"I thought that having had to go
through the language requirement
was a waste because now there's
none," Geo said. "I could've taken
other classes."
"From a learning standpoint,
I'm glad I took it because I think
that not having that background

would take away a lot from the
overall experience," she added.
Campani maintained that be
yond the revised language prereq
uisite the program would remain
the same.
"Students will continue to be
placed with Italian families who
speak English, and those wishing to
take an internship will be able to do
so in a work environment where
English is also used," Campani
said.
Students have until mid-June to
apply for the Winter Quarter pro
gram in Florence.
