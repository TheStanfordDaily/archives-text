## Library to host medieval manuscript database 
### LIAM KINNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford University Libraries
has partnered with the Walters
Art Museum, a public museum in
Baltimore, Md., to offer more
than 100,000 high-resolution im
ages of medieval manuscripts
stored at the museum online.
The Walters holds one of the
largest medieval collections in
North America, with 150 single
leaves and 850 illuminated manu

scripts produced between the
ninth and 19th centuries.
While approximately two
thirds of the manuscript images
are already available online
through the Walters' digital col
lection, uploading them to the
Stanford Digital Repository will
provide a backup in case of file
corruption and give scholars new
tools to analyze the manuscripts
and compare them with other
works.
The partnership between the

University and the museum be
gan after Robert Sanderson, an
information scientist at Los
Alamos National Laboratory
with an interest in digital human
ities, noticed the deficiencies of
the Walters' online storage sys
tem and began initial conversa
tions with both parties about a
possible collaboration.
Plans for storage of the im
ages in Stanford's repository
were finalized at a meeting be
tween Stanford's Digital Me

dieval Projects (DMP) Director
John Haeger, DMP Manager
Benjamin Albritton and William
Noel, a former curator for manu
scripts at the Walters.
"The greatest dangers that
special collections face are not
that they are overused but that
they will become irrelevant, and
digitization is the best advertise
ment that special collections can
have," Noel said. "The conserva-
tion of data in a technological envi
ronment is something we don't excel
at, like most libraries, but Stanford
had a fantastic digital infrastruc
ture."
Albritton said that uploading the
Walters' manuscripts to Stanford's
digital repository is part of a wider
series of projects in medieval con
tent preservation and inter-institu
tional collaboration, noting that the
long-term preservation and access
provided by the digital repository
will give the Walters manuscripts "a
great deal of exposure across the
scholarly community and beyond."
"The Walters collection of nearly
one thousand manuscripts is one of
the most important collections of
historically unique documents in
North America," Albritton said.
"This trove of content is now avail
able to Stanford scholars from
many disciplines and will drive re
search in a number of areas."

The 20 faculty and staff in Stan
ford's medieval studies program
look forward to using the manu
scripts in their research, according
to Professor of English Elaine Tre
harne.
According to Treharne, the "live
ly and stimulating" group of me
dievalists at Stanford organize and
participate in seminars, workshops
and colloquia on topics ranging from
11th-century literacies in Chinese,
Arabic and the Western cultures to
ecclesiastical acoustics, sound and
singing from the eighth through the
15th centuries.
"Stanford already has a world
class digital repository and some ex
cellent and beautiful original mate
rials in the special collections at
Green Library, but the Walters ait
collection has a unique and excep
tional range of manuscripts from all
over the medieval world, including
outstanding Byzantine and East
Asian materials that can now be
minutely scrutinized by scholars,"
Treharne said.
According to Treharne, the digi
tization of these manuscripts will al
low scholars at Stanford "to begin to

understand the importance of books
and documents to cultures that pre
cede ours," and will also give them
the opportunity to analyze how the
history of books has been shaped by
society.
Allowing Stanford access to
their medieval archives also pro
vides several major benefits for the
Walters, as Stanford Libraries' ac
tive digital medieval program en
sures widespread academic use of
the images, while Stanford's reposi
tory guarantees preservation.
Noel said that he is confident
that the manuscripts will prompt
new interests at Stanford, and he
noted that the transfer of the digital
images to the Stanford repository
mitigated his fears that the manu
scripts would eventually be forgot
ten.
"They're pinnacles of human cul
tural achievement," Noel said.
"They are the marks of life well
spent. They are the responsibility of
a civilized society to care for, and
they make life worth living."
