## Library to host medieval manuscript database 
### LIAM KINNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford University Libraries
has partnered with the Walters
Art Museum, a public museum in
Baltimore, Md., to offer more
than 100,000 high-resolution im
ages of medieval manuscripts

corruption and give scholars new
tools to analyze the manuscripts

Alamos National Laboratory
with an interest in digital human
ities, noticed the deficiencies of
the Walters' online storage sys

Plans for storage of the im
ages in Stanford's repository
were finalized at a meeting be

John Haeger, DMP Manager
Benjamin Albritton and William
Noel, a former curator for manu
scripts at the Walters.

they will become irrelevant, and
digitization is the best advertise
ment that special collections can
have," Noel said. "The conserva-
