## Red Couch promotes art on Farm 
### NOEMI BERKOWITZ 
The Stanford Red Couch Proj
ect (RCP), an independent pro
duction collective that films and
showcases the work of independ
ent artists on campus, is not an of
ficial student group. And it does
not want to be.
"We're giving people who are
not affiliated with an art or music
department an opportunity to cre
ate something that really feels
professional for them, and that
they can keep with them going for
ward to add to their portfolios or
for promotional materials for an
event that they're holding," said
RCP director Danny Smith 'l3.

In producing their videos, the
RCP often gets artists to record
three or four songs at once and
tell the story behind each. They
try to release individual videos on
YouTbbe about twice a week.
According to Smith, who first
became involved with RCP as a
performer, the project seeks to
change the perception of Stanford

by recognizing a vibrant arts
scene. He said he hoped that film
ing the performances and releas
ing them to the public would in
crease awareness of art at Stan
ford.
RCP first began that mission
three years ago, having been
founded by Emma Sedivy 'l2,
Stephen Henderson 'l2 M.A. 'l2

and Jeffrey Gerson 'l2 M.A. 'l3.
Since then, they have worked with
over 70 performers.

ated with departments and who
want to showcase their original
work or collaborate with other in
dependent artists on campus,

The Stanford Red Couch Project films and showcases the work of artists on campus. The independent
collective was founded three years ago and has worked with more than 70 artists thus far.
RCP gives students the opportunity
to perform on their own schedule
while allowing artists greater cre
ative flexibility.
Although Smith said that he
wants the group to remain inde
pendent, he noted he would like to
cooperate with the University to
publicize videos and to gain access to
better production equipment. To
that end, RCP recently partnered
with the Stanford Arts Institute.
"Stanford can be advertising
these videos as part of their market
ing scheme," Smith said, "and
sayfing], look, we're not just a tech
startup incubator with a football
team, there are a lot of talented

artists."
Currently, RCP relies on favors
to get its equipment, borrowing
from the Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics
(CCRMA), Kimball Hall (the Arts
themed dorm), Cummings Arts
Building and its friends. The projec
t's new partnership with the Stan
ford Arts Institute may, however,
help change that.
"What it means is that it will
provide an opportunity for students
who are interested in digital and au
dio production to work with some
really nice equipment, and learn
the ins and outs of cinematography
and social media marketing," Smith
said.
Students making videos learn
how to work on the entire produc
tion process, including capturing art
on film and editing video and audio.
Other involved students learn how

to use social media, such as RCP's
Facebook and Twitter, to maximize
engagement and extend the public
reach of the art.
Beyond acquiring those skills,
the nature of the project gives all
artists a lasting product.
"[Artists] have something to use
forever as part of their portfolio
when applying for jobs," Smith said.
Michael Yang 'l3, an occasional
RCP performer, said that RCP gave
him exposure but also, "more impor
tantly ... made me think of my art
and music in a more professional in
depth way."
"Everyone has different reasons
for being an artist," Smith said, not
ing that for him the best part
of the RCP experience has been
finding out those reasons.
