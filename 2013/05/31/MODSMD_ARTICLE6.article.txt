## Red Couch promotes art on Farm

The Stanford Red Couch Proj
ect (RCP), an independent pro
duction collective that films and
showcases the work of independ
ent artists on campus, is not an of
ficial student group. And it does
not want to be.
"We're giving people who are
not affiliated with an art or music
department an opportunity to cre
ate something that really feels
professional for them, and that
they can keep with them going for
ward to add to their portfolios or
for promotional materials for an
event that they're holding," said
RCP director Danny Smith 'l3.

In producing their videos, the
RCP often gets artists to record
three or four songs at once and
tell the story behind each. They
try to release individual videos on
YouTbbe about twice a week.
According to Smith, who first
became involved with RCP as a
performer, the project seeks to
change the perception of Stanford

by recognizing a vibrant arts
scene. He said he hoped that film
ing the performances and releas
ing them to the public would in
crease awareness of art at Stan
ford.
RCP first began that mission
three years ago, having been
founded by Emma Sedivy 'l2,
Stephen Henderson 'l2 M.A. 'l2

and Jeffrey Gerson 'l2 M.A. 'l3.
Since then, they have worked with
over 70 performers.
Tailored to students not affili
ated with departments and who
want to showcase their original
work or collaborate with other in
dependent artists on campus,
