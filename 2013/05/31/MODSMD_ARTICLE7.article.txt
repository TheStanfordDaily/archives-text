# Q&A LONDA SCHIEBINGER
## Professor of history, former director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research 
### MCKENZIE ANDREWS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Londa Schiebinger, professor of history and
the former director of the dayman Institute for
Gender Research, was recently awarded an hon
orary degree from Vrije Universiteit Brussel for
her work founding Stanford's Gendered Innova
tions project. The Daily sat down with Schiebinger
to discuss her award-winning scholarship, the
roots of her interest in gender and history and the
sexism in the Barbie Doll's first words.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What questions do
you primarily investigate in your research?
Londa Schiebinger (LS): There are three
strategic approaches to the field of women and
gender in science. The first is to look at women in
science in particular. This is [studying] the biogra
phies of great women. This is to study what per
cent of women there are at the faculty at Stanford,
for instance —how many women, where are they,
what fields do they cluster in.
And the second strategic approach is to look at
gender in academic culture and ... look more at
the kinds of barriers women encounter [and] to
look at how universities reasonably developed
around men's lives, because you know men were
the professors from the 17th century until long in
to the 20th century. So those kinds of questions
looks at what we need to do to transform institu
tions so both men and women can flourish.
And then the third strategic approach
which is really the one that I'm most interested in
and have devoted a lot of my intellectual work to
—is the question of, how do we use
gender analysis to see something
new? So this is a question of harness
ing the power of gender analysis to
discover new things in science and en
gineering. We often talk about bias in
those fields, but if we do the research
correctly in the first place we can
avoid the bias and just get the very
best research.

TSD: How did you become involved
with such a dynamic and perti
nent subject?
LS: When I was in graduate
school, it was considered professional
suicide to write anything about
women. This was the late '7os, early
'Bos. I was a graduate student at Har
vard University in the History De
partment, but eventually I got a Fhl
bright [Scholarship] and went to Ger
many, and it was getting away from
my home department that gave me
permission to really follow my intel
lectual passion. I was doing some
thing called intellectual history and I
was interested then in intellectual
women, and when I got back from
Germany to Cambridge, Mass., I was
completing my dissertation and there
was the very first lecture series on
women in science [at MIT],
And I listened to these women for
a while, and they were all telling a
similar story. It was an interesting
one, and I could see they didn't under
stand the social structures behind then
personal experiences and they didn't
understand the historical origins of the
barriers they were encountering. I
thought, 'Okay I'm a historian. This is
where my contribution can be.'"
TSD: Earlier in your Stanford ca
reer, how did you make the transi
tion from history professor to the
director of the Clayman Institute?
LS: I was recruited to direct the
Clayman Institute and my tenure
home was in history, so I was always
half and half. Then I stepped down.
The idea of the Clayman Institute is to
keep the leaderehip rotating through
different schools. We have never had
two directors who were in the same
discipline, which is really great for
keeping that institute fresh, so I di
rected for six years... and then I just
went back to my home in history
TSD: Why did you step down from
your Clayman Institute position
when such a position seems so
close to the research you do?
LS: [I stepped down] because it
was time for [other] people to step
up. I took one of the projects with
me, the Gendered Innovation in Sci
ence, Medicine, Engineering and
Environment [project], and that's an
international collaboration. That
started kind of as a Stanford start-up,
and then I got European Commis
sion money and National Science
Foundation funding, and through a
series of international collaborative
workshops we developed the Gen
dered Innovations project. The idea
is that scientists and engineers who do
not leam about gendered analytics in
their curriculum can go to this web
site and see a message that might en
hance then* work.

TSD: Is there biological evidence
that men are more predisposed to
scientific success or is this a social
construction?
LS: Oh boy, I see people have not
taken my class. I teach two classes:
One is Gendered Innovations... and
then I teach one through Science,
Technology and Society and History
that's called the History of Women
and Gender in Science, Medicine and
Technology, so this question that
you're asking requires about a week's
worth of analysis.
But the short answer is there are
biological differences between men
and women. However, the gender dif
ferences —the social experience that
children have from such an early age
are so strong. So going back to the
biology, we have never documented a
biological difference that leads more
men into science and more women not
into science, but we have documented
many many social experiences that
lead more men into science and fewer
women.
For example, the very first time
Barbie, the famous platinum blond
doll, said anything, her very first
words were " Math class is tough."
OK, there's a message for young
girls.
And then Angelina Jolie, when
she was playing [Evelyn] Salt, a big
CIA operative, in one of her movies,
smashes through a window as only
Angelina Jolie can... and in the room

she swings into, there's a little African
American girl doing math, and then
Angelina Jolie turns to the camera
and says "I hate math."
Girls just don't need too many of
these messages before they think that
math is not for them. So one thing we
can do is change our culture and make
science and math friendly for girls,
and eventually women —this is one of
the biggest things we can do to en
courage more women into science and
engineering.

TSD: What do you envision as the fu
ture of science and gender studies?
LS: Now we have developed these
methods and case studies so that re
searchers can begin to understand
how sex and gender function in their
research, so what I see —what I
think we will have —is science and
engineering that in fact serves every
body well.
So, for instance, if you look at drug
development, ten dings have been
withdrawn from the U.S. market re
cently and eight of those drugs
worked worse in women. So if re
searchers can get the research right
from the beginning, we won't have this
very expensive phase of having drugs
that really don't work well for people.
I see a future where the research will
truly be excellent.

Environment [project], and that's an
international collaboration. That
started kind of as a Stanford start-up,
and then I got European Commis
sion money and National Science
Foundation funding, and through a
series of international collaborative
workshops we developed the Gen
dered Innovations project. The idea
is that scientists and engineers who do
not leam about gendered analytics in
their curriculum can go to this web
site and see a message that might en
hance then* work.

TSD: Is there biological evidence
that men are more predisposed to
scientific success or is this a social
construction?
LS: Oh boy, I see people have not
taken my class. I teach two classes:
One is Gendered Innovations... and
then I teach one through Science,
Technology and Society and History
that's called the History of Women
and Gender in Science, Medicine and
Technology, so this question that
you're asking requires about a week's
worth of analysis.
But the short answer is there are
biological differences between men
and women. However, the gender dif
ferences —the social experience that
children have from such an early age
are so strong. So going back to the
biology, we have never documented a
biological difference that leads more
men into science and more women not
into science, but we have documented
many many social experiences that
lead more men into science and fewer
women.
For example, the very first time
Barbie, the famous platinum blond
doll, said anything, her very first
words were " Math class is tough."
OK, there's a message for young
girls.
And then Angelina Jolie, when
she was playing [Evelyn] Salt, a big
CIA operative, in one of her movies,
smashes through a window as only
Angelina Jolie can... and in the room

she swings into, there's a little African
American girl doing math, and then
Angelina Jolie turns to the camera
and says "I hate math."
Girls just don't need too many of
these messages before they think that
math is not for them. So one thing we
can do is change our culture and make
science and math friendly for girls,
and eventually women —this is one of
the biggest things we can do to en
courage more women into science and
engineering.

TSD: What do you envision as the fu
ture of science and gender studies?
LS: Now we have developed these
methods and case studies so that re
searchers can begin to understand
how sex and gender function in their
research, so what I see —what I
think we will have —is science and
engineering that in fact serves every
body well.
So, for instance, if you look at drug
development, ten dings have been
withdrawn from the U.S. market re
cently and eight of those drugs
worked worse in women. So if re
searchers can get the research right
from the beginning, we won't have this
very expensive phase of having drugs
that really don't work well for people.
I see a future where the research will
truly be excellent.

Londa Schiebinger, professor of history and
the former director of the dayman Institute for
Gender Research, was recently awarded an hon
orary degree from Vrije Universiteit Brussel for
her work founding Stanford's Gendered Innova
tions project. The Daily sat down with Schiebinger
to discuss her award-winning scholarship, the
roots of her interest in gender and history and the
sexism in the Barbie Doll's first words.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What questions do
you primarily investigate in your research?
Londa Schiebinger (LS): There are three
strategic approaches to the field of women and
gender in science. The first is to look at women in
science in particular. This is [studying] the biogra
phies of great women. This is to study what per
cent of women there are at the faculty at Stanford,
for instance —how many women, where are they,
what fields do they cluster in.
And the second strategic approach is to look at
gender in academic culture and ... look more at
the kinds of barriers women encounter [and] to
look at how universities reasonably developed
around men's lives, because you know men were
the professors from the 17th century until long in
to the 20th century. So those kinds of questions
looks at what we need to do to transform institu
tions so both men and women can flourish.
And then the third strategic approach
which is really the one that I'm most interested in
and have devoted a lot of my intellectual work to
—is the question of, how do we use
gender analysis to see something
new? So this is a question of harness
ing the power of gender analysis to
discover new things in science and en
gineering. We often talk about bias in
those fields, but if we do the research
correctly in the first place we can
avoid the bias and just get the very
best research.

TSD: How did you become involved
with such a dynamic and perti
nent subject?
LS: When I was in graduate
school, it was considered professional
suicide to write anything about
women. This was the late '7os, early
'Bos. I was a graduate student at Har
vard University in the History De
partment, but eventually I got a Fhl
bright [Scholarship] and went to Ger
many, and it was getting away from
my home department that gave me
permission to really follow my intel
lectual passion. I was doing some
thing called intellectual history and I
was interested then in intellectual
women, and when I got back from
Germany to Cambridge, Mass., I was
completing my dissertation and there
was the very first lecture series on
women in science [at MIT],
And I listened to these women for
a while, and they were all telling a
similar story. It was an interesting
one, and I could see they didn't under
stand the social structures behind then
personal experiences and they didn't
understand the historical origins of the
barriers they were encountering. I
thought, 'Okay I'm a historian. This is
where my contribution can be.'"
TSD: Earlier in your Stanford ca
reer, how did you make the transi
tion from history professor to the
director of the Clayman Institute?
LS: I was recruited to direct the
Clayman Institute and my tenure
home was in history, so I was always
half and half. Then I stepped down.
The idea of the Clayman Institute is to
keep the leaderehip rotating through
different schools. We have never had
two directors who were in the same
discipline, which is really great for
keeping that institute fresh, so I di
rected for six years... and then I just
went back to my home in history
TSD: Why did you step down from
your Clayman Institute position
when such a position seems so
close to the research you do?
LS: [I stepped down] because it
was time for [other] people to step
up. I took one of the projects with
me, the Gendered Innovation in Sci
ence, Medicine, Engineering and
Environment [project], and that's an
international collaboration. That
started kind of as a Stanford start-up,
and then I got European Commis
sion money and National Science
