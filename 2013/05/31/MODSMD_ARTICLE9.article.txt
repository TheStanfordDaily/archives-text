## Faculty Senate hears annual budget report Stanford expected to run surplus in next fiscal year 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard an an
nual budget report from Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 at its
Thursday meeting.
"We are in good health financial
ly," Etchemendy summarized. "The
budget also shows a lot of caution
and concern for a lot of things on the
horizon."
Reviewing Stanford's consolidat
ed budget, Etchemendy noted that
despite increases in the financial
aid budget, employee salaries and
benefits, graduate student stipends
and selected research funding
the University is projected to gener
ate a surplus of $173 million for the
2013-14 fiscal year.
Turning to the general funds
budget, which consists of unrestrict
ed funds, Etchemendy said that
budget would be used to increase
the University's reserve funds, re
move the need to use buffer funds to
support financial aid and increase
research support.
Etchemendy also remarked on
the University's capital plan, which
includes every project undertaken
or completed over the next three
years, drawing attention to Stan

ford's continued growth.
"When I was an assistant profes
sor here, I remember seeing all the
construction and wondering when
they were going to be done," he said.
"I realized Stanford is like a city. It's
never going to be done."
While the capital budget for the
2013-14 fiscal year totals $658 mil
lion, Etchemendy estimated that on
ly around 80 percent of that sum
would actually be spent. Notable
construction projects include the
Stanford Energy System Innova
tions (SESI) project, which is slated
to receive $207.9 million next year.
"[SESI involves] tearing up
every street on campus and replac
ing the stream pipes with hot water
pipes," Etchemendy said. "We are
going to end up with the most ad
vanced energy system in the world
but it's going to cost us about $438
million [in total]."
Other significant construction
projects include adding a fourth
building for bioengineering and
chemical engineering â€”to the En
gineering Quad, adding to the Stan
ford Hospital and the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, re
modeling Roble Gym into an "arts
gym," remodeling the Old Chem
istry building and adding a contem
plative center to campus.
The University will also add
more housing options to campus.
The Comstock Graduate Housing
project will add 362 beds for stu
dents, while the expansion of Gradu
ate School of Business housing will
add a further 150. A fourth dorm will
be built in the Manzanita quad and
two new dorms will be added to La
gunita.
There are also plans to add 180
housing units to Mayfield California
Avenue for faculty and staff.
"This is something we desperate
ly need," Etchemendy said.
In faculty discussion following
Etchemendy's report, Professor of
Development Biology Margaret
Fuller queried whether the pro
posed additions to undergraduate
housing would accommodate a po
tential desire to expand the under
graduate population.
"We would need something be
yond that," Etchemendy said.
"Some of these new housing options
will be used for the existing under
graduate population, but in order to
grow the [population] further, we
would need more housing."
