Retail Position Part-Time
At Penzeys Spices we believe cooking is kindness,
and kindness can change the world.
The words "kindness works" are our guide, and we are looking for people
who not only share that belief, but live it, as well.
Are you a positive person who genuinely enjoys others? Do you have
great energy, love people and love to build relationships? Looking for a
physically active job (stocking, inventory, etc.), but more importantly one that
makes our customers feel good about who they are —and what they're
cooking?
Join our energetic and growing company and help make a difference, all
while working with others who enjoy life —and work —as much as you do.
You'll help make the world a better place, one conversation at a time.
Humanity? Required.
Retail Experience? Not so much.
This is a job that's about helping others feel good. It'll be located at our
store in Menlo Park at 771 Santa Cruz Avenue. If this sounds like something
you (or a friend!) might be looking for, pleasevisitwww.penzeys.com and fill
out an application, or contact Megan with questions at 262-785-7697.
We can't wait to meet you!
