Admission to this course is by application only. We will collaboratively
write, design, and illustrate a full-length graphic novel. We are looking
for artists, writers, designers, and all-around team players.This will be
an intense, challenging, rewarding class, but with a heavy workload.
This is a two-term course offered during fall (English 190G) and winter
(English 190H) quarters; preference will be given to students who can
complete both terms.
To apply, include on one side of a sheet of paper: your name, email,
major, minor, graduating year, any creative writing, art, or design class
es you've taken, with the instructor's name. And two paragraphs: one
that briefly describes your interest in the course, and the second, of no
more than three sentences, that is a pitch for a possible story based in
nonfiction (a sample of the kind of ideas you'd bring to brainstorming
sessions during the first couple of weeks of class). Also, indicate wheth
er you will be able to take the course in both fall and winter terms.
On the other side of the paper: Anything. Text, graphics, illustrations,
etc. Communicate your skills, experience, and enthusiasm.
