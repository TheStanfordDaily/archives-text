## Professors play down calls for business major 
### CLARISSE PERALTA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite Stanford's proliferation of
both finance-oriented student groups
and accounting and finance course of
ferings, the University's lack of an un
dergraduate finance, accounting or
business major is not unusual, accord
ing to professors and University ad
ministrators.

Several accounting and finance
courses are offered through the man
agement science & engineering
(MS&E) and economics depart
ments, and undergraduates are
sometimes allowed to enroll in Gradu
ate School of Business (GSB) elective
classes, according to GSB Senior As
sociate Dean for Academic Affairs
Madhav Rajan.
"If you look at the top five MBA
programs, the only one with an un
dergraduate program is the Wharton
[School of the University of Pennsyl
vania]," he said. "That is more of an
exception than the rule. I think that it
is not necessarily appropriate for un
dergraduates."
Rajan, who was a professor at
Wharton before coming to Stanford,
has taught undergraduates in several
of his classes and said they were "ex
ceedingly smart." Though willing to
teach undergraduates if given the op-

portunity, Rajan said that creating a
business major at Stanford would be
difficult.

"I'm sure undergrads here are
great and a lot of faculty would enjoy
teaching them. That is not an issue at
all," he said. "The difficulty for us
would be getting the faculty to do it
because right now we are at capacity.
So the biggest cost of doing an under
grad major would be expanding the
faculty significantly"
A liberal education
GSB Assistant Professor of Eco
nomics Nicolas Lambert M.S. 'O9
Ph.D. 'lO allowed 10 seniors all
computer science majors to enroll
in his GSB class on intermediate mi
croeconomics this year. Almost 250
graduate students also took the class.
"I targeted people with a certain
background because there is a fair

amount of technical content," he said.
"My group this year is really great.
There is no difference in quality,
which is because I got people who
want to be there. It's not like we had
to sell the course to them."

Though Lambert said that it
would be a "good thing" to bring busi
ness school classes to undergraduate
students, he advised against creating
a business major, as he believes that
undergraduates need a background
in broader subjects.
"Having a general background is a
strength, not a limitation," he said.
"It's good not being too specialized
because it's the only time in your life
when you can afford to do so. Anytime
after that, you have to be more fo
cused."
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam agreed, not
ing that Stanford strives to provide
students with a well-rounded liberal
education.
"We want students to come here
and explore in their freshman year,
then declare a major in their sopho
more year that they're passionate
about and can delve deeply into, not
just as a means to an end," he said.
'An undergraduate business major is
not something we see that can identi
fy with Stanford."
Elam noted that there are other
opportunities for students to "dip
their feet into business," and empha
sized the importance of skills that
cannot be taught in business courses.
"How you get life experience, how
you understand people's relationships
to one another, how you think critical
lyâ€” all of that informs how you ap
proach business," he said. "It's not
simply knowing accounting or any as
pect of business."
However, Elam said that in the fu
ture, the University will look into fa
cilitating more formal business edu
cation experiences for undergraduate
students.

"Our hope is that we can offer stu
dents additional business classes, like
a course in marketing for undergrad
uates," he said. "With the new re
quirements, we want to create a

While Stanford does not offer a business, finance or accounting major,
professors and administrators emphasize the value of a liberal education
and point interested students to existing course offerings.
