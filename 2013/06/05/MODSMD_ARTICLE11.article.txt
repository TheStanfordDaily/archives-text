# OPINIONS
## Farewell thoughts 
### Taylor Brady 
When I was four years old, I
imagined myself, for the
first time, standing on a lit
eral soapbox in downtown Tucson
and preaching to a crowd of people
rushing to work. In that vision, I
stamped to the sidewalk, plopped
down the crate, climbed on top, and
shouted, "People, listen to the truth
that your heart has been bursting
to hear!"

The vision ended there. I never
knew how I wanted to follow that bold
beginning and so the presumably in
spirational words to follow have al
ways remained unwritten. Being a
sophist when it comes to universal
proclamations, I'm still loath to fill in
the blanks. So I feel curious, perched
in my last column's bully pulpit, con
vinced that I have to come up with
nutshell wisdom to hurl your way be
fore I depart.

Let's focus on some common
themes in my articles, then, and at
tempt to make sense of my grand
moral scheme. Those themes, in
litany: class alienation, depression,
solitude, substance abuse, ecologi
cal degradation. Grouchy, huh? Yet
I've always idolized writers who tell
hard truths. One of these, former
Stegner fellow Ed Abbey, was noted
for this quote in a student paper:
"Man will never be free until the last
king is strangled with the entrails of
the last priest." I disagree, mostly
because autocrats and clergy are
the least of our problems, but if I
had to offer my personal homage
and emendation to Abbey it would
be: Man will never be free until the
people responsible for destroying
the world start perishing in droves
because of it. And even then I re
main skeptical of our chances.
Here was my problem coming to
California, and especially to Stan
ford: it was too easy to remain insu
lated from the horrors of the world out
side Eden. I come from Thcson, Ari
zona, in the Sonoran Desert. Deserts
are where the very sunlight that
our admissions brochures laud gets
too hot for comfort —it will reach
42° C (108°F) in Tucson this Fri
day. It is where you realize that
"too much of a good thing" exists,
and that the consequence is
melanoma.

Deserts also happen to be one
of the most unstable biomes in
which human communities persist,
and will be one of the first to go
when decades of drought exacer
bated by climate change desiccate
the last of our water supply. They
are where we get a little perspec
tive on the atrocities of the violent
drug war that the United States
supports in excess of 60,000
deaths in Mexico since 2006. We
get this perspective because the
bodies of migrants exploited as
drug mules show up among the
saguaros, and the violence spreads

to our towns. The desert is where
the bubble bursts.
Yet what value do a desert rat's
morals have in Stanford's brave
new world? As I stated before, I
am careful with asserting univer
sal. But I think that I have a cer
tain perspective to offer on the
path forward that remains unspo
ken by those who hail from less ex
treme environments.

In 1965, Joan Didion was stay
ing in the Enterprise Motel and
Trailer Park in Death Valley. She
was assigned to write an essay on
"morality," and, inspired by deaths
recent and historical in the epony
mous valley, she declared that the
only tenable morality to her was
composed of instinctual promises
that humans make, like we do not
"abandon our dead to the coy
otes." What she lost, though, and I
suspect this is because she is a na
tive of Sacramento and not the
desert, is that those specific exam
ples of "wagon-train morality"
eventually compound to inform a
full-blown moral heuristic not un
like a Categorical Imperative.
I recount that story because the
desert is the best place to confront
the harsh realities of "right" ac
tion. I believe that suffering is and
will always be a part of life, but al
so that it is a zero-sum game. Insu
lating ourselves from some of its
worst incarnations, throwing a
fence up on the frontier of the cam
pus or the country, we exacerbate
it elsewhere. It will stay this way
unless we suffer, too.
You might argue that, at Stan
ford, we are attuned to social prob
lems; after all, isn't that what most
of our research goes to solve? Yet I
contest that we fashion bandages
but never know the wounds; in
stead of treating, we're amputat
ing. As Lionel Trilling said, "Once
we have made our fellow men the
objects of our enlightened interest,
[we] go on to make them the ob
jects of our pity, then of our wis
dom, ultimately of our coercion."
Awareness campaigns aren't ef
fective, either. What most of us
know about the recent protests in

Istanbul are not nuanced argu
ments against overdevelopment, or
tyrannical religious governments,
but trending hashtags. As such,
our only protests are platitudes
pitched to people who already
agree. Even when we do take the
time to read the articles linked on
Facebook, the sheer volume of in
formation overstimulates us and
truly newsworthy events pass on
as unceremoniously as any other
fleeting meme. We don't take time
to critically digest that information

further and act. Patting ourselves
on the back for awareness is an in
sidious fallacy peddled by the very
tech companies where many of our
graduates will go to work because
they don't think enough about the
reasons why they shouldn't.
Stop thinking of the "bubble" as
an ironic joke to toss around about
how privileged you are. Stop
thinking that the Bay Area is egal
itarian. Self-respect, Joan Didion
also asserted, stems from "the will
ingness to accept responsibility for

one's own life," so it is time that we
stop fooling ourselves that our
lifestyle here has no negative exter
nalities and that we don't have an
obligation to accept responsibility
for them.

Taylor swears to God that off the
page he's not so melodramatic, and
he hopes someday to meet his read
ers in person and make you
laugh. Please check out more of his
