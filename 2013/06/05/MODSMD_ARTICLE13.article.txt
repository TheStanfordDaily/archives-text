## Jason Collins Does Not Have To Stand Alone 
### NOAH GARCIA 
When Stanford alum and current NBA player
Jason Collins announced at the end of April
that he was coming out, it was hard not to lis
ten; Facebook posts, news stories and even a Sports Il
lustrated cover page got the message across. But like
most stories today, Collins's coming-out slowly faded
out of the sights of the media and perhaps was even
forgotten by some. Now that more than a month has
passed, I feel that it is important to reflect upon what
this unprecedented event means for the Stanford com
munity and for the greater athletic community as a
whole.

As a co-founder of the student group StAAT (Stan
ford Athletes and Allies Together), I'm incredibly
proud of Collins for being able to step forward and
make public what has been, in his words, "baking" in
side of him for 33 years. The fact that he played for
Stanford makes the announcement even more special,
and it is something that I feel like most Stanford stu
dents can be proud of too.

But Collins's message also brings up a pressing
matter in the athletic world: the absence of dialogue
about LGBT athletes. This is not to say that there
have not been professional athletes before Collins who
have publicly come out. I don't want to discount them
or the contributions they've made to sport or accept
ance of LGBT athletes.

But the fact that Jason is the only out male athlete
in the big three American sports leagues is troubling.
He recounts in his article with Sports Illustrated the
difficulties he had with finding the right time to make
his announcement and feeling pressure to remain
silent during season. But these are problems that bas
ketball players and all other athletes could potentially
face when coming out. Perhaps there are more Jasons
out there baking under the same conditions.
In any case, Collins' coming out has been a major
milestone in LGBT athletics and has the potential to
really draw attention to this timely issue. It's difficult
to say, but I hope his announcement resonates with
the athletic community and is able to spark a change
in the way athletes, coaches, athletic administrations
and fans think about and discuss LGBT issues in ath
letics. The conversation has already started, and Stan
ford should be a part of it.
