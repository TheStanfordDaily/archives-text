## THE FUTURE IS HERE APPEL, WILSON LIKELY EARLY ROUND PICKS
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Several Stanford baseball play
ers are expected to be selected in
the Major League Baseball first
year player draft, which runs from
Thursday through Saturday.
In Thursday's first two rounds,
senior starting pitcher Mark Appel
and junior centerfielder Austin
Wilson should hear their names
called.
After reportedly turning down
$3.8 million from the Pittsburgh Pi
rates after being selected No. 8
overall in 2012, Appel is projected
as a top-five pick. Most draft ex
perts have Appel as either the No.
1 or No. 2 prospect available, but
the MLB Draft is wildly unpre
dictable.
Last season, most expected Ap
pel to be drafted first overall by the
Houston Astros, his hometown
team. But the Astros opted for
Carlos Correa spending less
money so they could afford to sign
later picks and Appel began a
shocking slide.
That has made everyone more
cautious when projecting where
Appel will land this time around.
The Astros hold the top pick again,
but most expect them to again go
for a cheaper option, especially con
sidering the pitching depth in their
minor-league system.
The Cubs select next, and many
experts, including ESPN's Keith
Law, see them taking Appel. Cubs
President of Baseball Operations
Theo Epstein was in attendance for
Appel's last start, bringing along
former Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood.
But Epstein has also been
linked to Oklahoma pitcher

Jonathan Gray, widely considered to
be the only prospect that a signifi
cant number of teams rank ahead of
Appel. If the Cubs take Gray, Appel
could slide as far as fourth to the
Minnesota Twins or fifth to the
Cleveland Indians, given the
propensity of the Colorado Rockies,
who own the third pick, to take hit
ters for a hitter-friendly ballpark.
Once Appel comes off the board,
Wilson should be next. Coming off
an elbow injury that limited his
playing time, Wilson is an intriguing
prospect. Some lumors have a team
like the Philadelphia Phillies taking
him as high as the middle of the first
round, but others believe Wilson
could slide into the second round. The
Yankees, who have three picks near
the end of the first round, have been
mentioned as having a strong inter
est in the big slugger.
Junior first baseman Brian Ra

gira and junior pitcher A. J. Vanegas
could come next. Baseball America
has Vanegas as its 78th-ranked
prospect in the draft, while it ranks
Ragira 142 nd. Vanegas was
thought to be a potential first
round pick after wowing scouts
with his velocity in the Cape Cod
Baseball League last summer.
But a back injury and then
mononucleosis cost Vanegas almost
his entire junior season, making it
much more difficult to judge his
value. That will give Vanegas a
tough decision. If he is not drafted
as highly as he thinks he deserves,
the junior could come back to Stan
ford for one more year.
Ragira is also a tricky case, but
more of it has to do with his posi
tion. Scouts have commented that
Ragira needs to show more power
if he wants to make it to the majors,
and might have to switch to a cor

ner outfield position as well. Ragira
did improve his power, hitting a ca
reer-high eight home runs, but
teams will be looking to develop his
slugging capabilities more in the
minor leagues.
The remainder of draft-eligible
players could land in a variety of
different places in the unpre
dictable MLB draft. Seniors Justin
Ringo and Garrett Hughes both
had strong senior years after over
coming struggles in their first
three years on the Farm to inflate
their stock.

Last year, Appel was selected No.8 overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates but elected to return to the Farm.
