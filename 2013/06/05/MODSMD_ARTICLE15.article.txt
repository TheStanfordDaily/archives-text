# FOUR-STRAIGHT FOR CREW EIGHT
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
For the fourth year in a row, the
Stanford women's lightweight row
ing I Eight reigned victorious at the
Intercollegiate Rowing Association
(IRA) National Championships.
"To be completely honest, I
barely remember the 20 minutes
after the race ended," said sopho
more Mackenzie Crist. "It was
hard to process what had just hap
pened, but we were all unbelievably
excited. It still hasn't sunk in, but I
definitely smile every time I think
about our race."
The Cardinal's biggest competi
tion going into the IRAs was Har
vard-Radcliffe a team that went
undefeated during the regular sea
son and held the No. 1 seed going

into the weekend. Earlier in the
season, then-No. 2 Harvard-Rad
cliffe beat then-No. 1 Cardinal by a
significant six-second margin at a
race in which Stanford took sec
ond.
On Saturday, the competing
boats were divided into two sepa
rate heats to determine who would
advance to Sunday's grand final.
Stanford finished over five seconds
ahead of the field, in front of Buck
nell, Princeton and MIT. Stan
ford's time was nearly identical to
that of Harvard-Radcliffe after the
first day of competition, edging the
Crimson by about half a second.
"Going into the weekend was
definitely a little nerve-wracking. I
think it was after this race [on Sat
urday] that our potential to win be
came very real to me," said Crist.

Sunday's IRA Grand Final pit
ted the Cardinal against Harvard-
Radcliffe, Bucknell, Princeton,
Georgetown, and Wisconsin. Stan
ford crossed the finish line first by
almost four seconds, beating Har
vard-Radcliffe by almost the same
margin that it had been beaten by
previously.
Stanford jumped out to an ear
ly one-second lead at the 500 m
mark and never looked back. By
the I,ooom marker the Card had
increased the time gap to two and a
half seconds and had pushed the
lead to three seconds with 500 m
left in the race.
"Just a few strokes into the race,
I felt pretty confident about our po
sition," Christ said. "Halfway into
the race, we had a good lead and I
realized that we were going to win.

We got ahead early and continued
to open water on the boats behind
us.
"The second half of the race was
a blur," he continued. "We were all
unbelievably exhausted but know
ing that the 'four-peat' we had been
talking about all season was about
to become a reality kept us pushing
towards the finish line. Crossing
the finish line first was surreal."
The Card opened up the season
ranked No. 1, winning the San
Diego Crew Classic for the sev
enth-consecutive year. The team al
so earned a second-place finish at
the WIRA Championships this
year against open-weight competi
tion.
