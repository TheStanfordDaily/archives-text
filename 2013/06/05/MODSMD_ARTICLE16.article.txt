# Tasting the undergrad experience
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Where do I start? I
should probably
be taking this op
portunity my
last-ever column
in these pages —to tear into Sam
Fisher, Monday night sports desk ed
itor and author of all the abusive con
tact lines at the end of my columns
this past year. But however easy that
might be, taking aim at Sam might
give you entirely the wrong idea
about how it feels to be leaving this
place. Not just the Farm, but The
Stanford Daily itself.
Almost four* years ago, a shy and
awkward grad student showed up on
the doorstep of the Lorry I. Lokey
Stanford Daily building with the
crazy idea of toying his hand at the
one thing most other engineering stu
dents avoid like the plague: writing.
Back at Stanford after a long break
from my studies, having originally
left due to funding problems and then
struggling with injury duiing my
leave of absence, walking into a room
full of fresh-faced undergraduates
half-a-generation younger than me
was a bit daunting.
I'm sure they were also a little be
mused to have a grad student signing
up for what was, and still is, an almost
exclusively undergrad institution.
Likewise my grad student friends
continue to be puzzled by why I would
want to spend my free hours away
from research sleeplessly working,
for free, with these same undergrads
at The Daily
The truth is, by accident more
than design, I stumbled across a
unique place on campus that Septem
ber evening back in 2009, somewhere
I could cross the gaping grad-under
grad divide and live just a little bit of
that true American college experi
ence. Not in a sketchy way I've
never been to FM Moon on the Quad
or hung around outside Exotic Erot
ic, that's just plain creepy but in
stead as just one of the many Dailies
that make this publication more than
just a few sheets of paper.
Along the way I experienced the
highs and lows of Stanford sports
both home and on the road, defended
The Daily's honor in the Ink Bowl, its
annual rivalry game against The Dai
ly Californian, ate far too much Co-
Ho and Treehouse food, stayed up
until the small hours of the morning
arguing and joking about nothing in
particular while we put together a
paper, and made some awesome
hopefully lifelong friends.
Grad students constitute the vast
majority of Stanford's population,
but this is not our university. I'm
walking at Commencement, but I'll
never be in the Class of 2013. In a few
years' time, undergrads will be invit
ed back for Homecoming; I won't.
That's just the way it is. Our commu
nity is not the life and soul of this
place. Just hang around a few extra
days after the end of spring quarter
and you'll see this; though most grad
students are still around, campus is
dead.
But at The Daily, I got to be just as
much a part of things as any over
achieving undergrad. There aren't
many organizations like this one on
campus. Student-ran and independ
ent from the University minus
some help from Special Fees its
very survival is linked to the success
or failure of its writers, editors and
business team. It might be a far
smaller institution than the New York
Times, but the pressures it faces are
no less real.
I once complained that grad stu
dents aren't involved enough in Stan
ford sports. I realize now that this
was shortsighted; the field and the
bleachers are just the most obvious
place where we fail to represent.
Grad friends complain that The
Daily is undergrad-focused, and of
course it is. Without grad students on
staff, stories are far more likely to be
drawn from the world of undergrads.
But it doesn't have to be that way, and
it shouldn't.
We're all in this game together. Is
sues that affect undergrads also af
fect grads: access to housing, the Al
ternative Review Process, divest
ment, the University's alcohol policy,
etc. Whether you realize it or not, The
Stanford Daily speaks for you.
Unfortunately, my time here at
Stanford has run out, and the East
Coast is now beckoning. For many of
you, though, it's not too late to be part
of this. To apply your intelligence and
talent to more than just homework, to

learn all those writing, graphics and
teamwork skills not by taking some
abstract course, but by working
hands-on in a real media organiza
tion. To improve and expand The
Daily's coverage of grad student is
sues and to get the inside track at
Stanford on anything from the ASSU
and GSC to the football team's chal

lenge for next year's BCS National
Championship.
And perhaps to discover why this
grad student will miss this ragtag
band of undergrads more than any
thing else on the Farm.

Tom Taylor's departure leaves
Sam Fisher without a purpose in
life. Tom, you will be missed more
than you will ever know. To thank
Tom for his years of service to
Stanford, email him at tom.tay

one thing most other engineering stu
dents avoid like the plague: writing.
Back at Stanford after a long break
from my studies, having originally
left due to funding problems and then
struggling with injury duiing my
leave of absence, walking into a room
full of fresh-faced undergraduates
half-a-generation younger than me
was a bit daunting.
I'm sure they were also a little be
mused to have a grad student signing
up for what was, and still is, an almost
exclusively undergrad institution.
Likewise my grad student friends
continue to be puzzled by why I would
want to spend my free hours away
from research sleeplessly working,
for free, with these same undergrads
at The Daily
The truth is, by accident more
than design, I stumbled across a
unique place on campus that Septem
ber evening back in 2009, somewhere
I could cross the gaping grad-under
grad divide and live just a little bit of
that true American college experi
ence. Not in a sketchy way I've
never been to FM Moon on the Quad
or hung around outside Exotic Erot
ic, that's just plain creepy but in
stead as just one of the many Dailies
that make this publication more than
just a few sheets of paper.
Along the way I experienced the
highs and lows of Stanford sports
both home and on the road, defended
The Daily's honor in the Ink Bowl, its
annual rivalry game against The Dai
ly Californian, ate far too much Co-
Ho and Treehouse food, stayed up
until the small hours of the morning
arguing and joking about nothing in
particular while we put together a
paper, and made some awesome
hopefully lifelong friends.
Grad students constitute the vast
majority of Stanford's population,
but this is not our university. I'm
walking at Commencement, but I'll
never be in the Class of 2013. In a few
years' time, undergrads will be invit
ed back for Homecoming; I won't.
That's just the way it is. Our commu
nity is not the life and soul of this
place. Just hang around a few extra
days after the end of spring quarter
and you'll see this; though most grad
students are still around, campus is
dead.
But at The Daily, I got to be just as
much a part of things as any over
achieving undergrad. There aren't
many organizations like this one on
campus. Student-ran and independ
ent from the University minus
some help from Special Fees its
very survival is linked to the success
or failure of its writers, editors and
business team. It might be a far
smaller institution than the New York
Times, but the pressures it faces are
no less real.
I once complained that grad stu
dents aren't involved enough in Stan
ford sports. I realize now that this
was shortsighted; the field and the
bleachers are just the most obvious
place where we fail to represent.
Grad friends complain that The
Daily is undergrad-focused, and of
course it is. Without grad students on
staff, stories are far more likely to be
drawn from the world of undergrads.
But it doesn't have to be that way, and
it shouldn't.
We're all in this game together. Is
sues that affect undergrads also af
fect grads: access to housing, the Al
ternative Review Process, divest
ment, the University's alcohol policy,
etc. Whether you realize it or not, The
Stanford Daily speaks for you.
Unfortunately, my time here at
Stanford has run out, and the East
Coast is now beckoning. For many of
you, though, it's not too late to be part
of this. To apply your intelligence and
talent to more than just homework, to

learn all those writing, graphics and
teamwork skills not by taking some
abstract course, but by working
hands-on in a real media organiza
tion. To improve and expand The
Daily's coverage of grad student is
sues and to get the inside track at
Stanford on anything from the ASSU
and GSC to the football team's chal

lenge for next year's BCS National
Championship.
And perhaps to discover why this
grad student will miss this ragtag
band of undergrads more than any
thing else on the Farm.
