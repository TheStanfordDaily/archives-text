## 12 ATHLETES TO COMPETE FOR CARD 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford track and field team will cap
off the Cardinal athletic program's 2012-13 sea
son when it competes in the NCAA Champi
onships from June 5-8 in Eugene, Ore.
The No. 11 women's squad will send nine
athletes to Eugene, led by junior Kori Carter,
who qualified in two individual events and also
anchored the 4x400 relay. Last season, the Car
dinal women finished sixth in the country as
LSU took the team title.

Carter, who was named the Women's West Re
gion Track Athlete of the Year on Monday, is
ranked No. 1 in the 400-meter hurdles with a seed
time of 54.50. On May 12, the star junior ran the
fastest time by an American this year in the event
(54.21), shattering the Stanford school record.
Just behind Carter is Arizona's Georganna Moline
(54.59) who finished fifth in the 2012 Olympics.
Carter has edged Moline all three times the two
have raced head-to-head this season.
The seven-time Ail-American is also set to
compete in the 100-meter hurdles, where she is
seeded tenth. She will cap off the championships
by anchoring No. 9 Stanford in the 4x400 race.
The team of Carter, senior Justine Fedronic,
senior Carissa Levingston and freshman Amy
Weissenbach ran the third-fastest time in school
history (3:32.65) at the preliminaries.
In the javelin, sophomore Brianna Bain will
be seeking her first national championship. The
sophomore, who was the 2012 runner-up in the
event, is seeded second (53.60 m) behind Penn
State's Lauren Kenney (54.02 m), last year's
fourth-place finisher.
The Cardinal has a good opportunity to earn
points in the 800-meter race, where Fedronic
and Weissenbach are both ranked in the top 10.
The field is topped by LSU junior Nataoya
Goule, who posted a blistering seed time of
2:01.04. Fedronic is ranked fourth with a time of
2:04.50 while Weissenbach's seed time of 2:04.97
placed her in seventh.
Senior Karynn Dunn will look to cap off her
outdoor career with a strong performance in the

long jump. The two-time first-team All-Ameri

can bounced back from an injury-ridden indoor
season to earn the No. 9 seed at nationals in the
event with a mark of 6.28 m. Last season, Dunn
set a personal record at outdoor nationals to
take fifth place.
Fellow senior Alyssa Wisdom claimed the
12th and final spot in the shot put at preliminar
ies to qualify for the championships, where she
is seeded 17th (16.19 m). Wisdom entered Stan
ford as a sprinter but transitioned to throwing
in 2011 due to health concerns. At her first ap
pearance in the national championships during
the 2013 indoor season, Wisdom fouled on all
three throws and did not record a place.
Stanford also has two entrants in the women's
5,000 meters. Sophomore Aisling Cuffe is seeded
22nd (16:15.53) while junior teammate Jessica
Tonn (16:21.21) is a spot behind.
After a strong performance at preliminaries,
the Stanford women moved up a spot to No. 11 in
the country, but the team is still projected to fin
ish far behind national leaders Kansas, Texas
A&M, Florida, LSU and Oregon, who are all
bringing at least 12 entries to the national cham
pionships.
Just three Stanford men earned spots in na
tionals, leaving the Cardinal's focus squarely on
individual performances.
Junior Erik Olson is Stanford's top-ranked
racer with a No. 8 seed in the 5,000-meter run
(13:53.68). Arizona junior Lawi Lalang tops the
field with a seed time of 13:41.87.
In the 400-meter dash, Steven Solomon is
ranked 16th. The freshman qualified for nation
als with a 10th place finish at preliminaries in just
his fourth meet for the Cardinal this season.
Solomon competed for Australia in the 2012
Olympics but has struggled with injuries while
on the Farm.
The third member of the men's squad is jun
ior Tyler Stutzman, who is seeded 23rd in the
1,500-meter run (3:49.80). The two-time Ail-
American led Stanford with a fourth-place fin
ish in the mile at the 2013 Indoor National
Championships and will look to do the same in
the slightly shorter outdoor event.
The 2013 NCAA Outdoor National Champi
onships begin today at 1:30 p.m. and will contin
ue through Friday evening. Live coverage and
video streaming can be found at ncaa.com and
Friday's events will be televised on ESPNU.

In the 400-meter dash, Steven Solomon is
ranked 16th. The freshman qualified for nation
als with a 10th place finish at preliminaries in just
his fourth meet for the Cardinal this season.

Olympics but has struggled with injuries while
on the Farm.

Championships and will look to do the same in
the slightly shorter outdoor event.

Sophomore Brianna Bain (above) will be seeking her first national title after finishing
as runner-up in the javelin at outdoor nationals last year. Bain, the 2013 Pac-12
champion in the event, enters the 2013 NCAA Championships as the No. 2 seed.
The Stanford track and field team will cap
off the Cardinal athletic program's 2012-13 sea
son when it competes in the NCAA Champi
onships from June 5-8 in Eugene, Ore.
The No. 11 women's squad will send nine
athletes to Eugene, led by junior Kori Carter,
who qualified in two individual events and also
anchored the 4x400 relay. Last season, the Car
dinal women finished sixth in the country as
LSU took the team title.

Carter, who was named the Women's West Re
gion Track Athlete of the Year on Monday, is
ranked No. 1 in the 400-meter hurdles with a seed
time of 54.50. On May 12, the star junior ran the
fastest time by an American this year in the event
(54.21), shattering the Stanford school record.
Just behind Carter is Arizona's Georganna Moline
(54.59) who finished fifth in the 2012 Olympics.
Carter has edged Moline all three times the two
have raced head-to-head this season.
The seven-time Ail-American is also set to
compete in the 100-meter hurdles, where she is
seeded tenth. She will cap off the championships
by anchoring No. 9 Stanford in the 4x400 race.
The team of Carter, senior Justine Fedronic,
senior Carissa Levingston and freshman Amy
Weissenbach ran the third-fastest time in school
history (3:32.65) at the preliminaries.
In the javelin, sophomore Brianna Bain will
be seeking her first national championship. The
sophomore, who was the 2012 runner-up in the
event, is seeded second (53.60 m) behind Penn
State's Lauren Kenney (54.02 m), last year's
fourth-place finisher.
The Cardinal has a good opportunity to earn
points in the 800-meter race, where Fedronic
and Weissenbach are both ranked in the top 10.
The field is topped by LSU junior Nataoya
Goule, who posted a blistering seed time of
2:01.04. Fedronic is ranked fourth with a time of
2:04.50 while Weissenbach's seed time of 2:04.97
placed her in seventh.
Senior Karynn Dunn will look to cap off her
outdoor career with a strong performance in the

long jump. The two-time first-team All-Ameri

can bounced back from an injury-ridden indoor
season to earn the No. 9 seed at nationals in the
event with a mark of 6.28 m. Last season, Dunn
set a personal record at outdoor nationals to
take fifth place.
Fellow senior Alyssa Wisdom claimed the
12th and final spot in the shot put at preliminar
ies to qualify for the championships, where she
is seeded 17th (16.19 m). Wisdom entered Stan
ford as a sprinter but transitioned to throwing
in 2011 due to health concerns. At her first ap
pearance in the national championships during
the 2013 indoor season, Wisdom fouled on all
three throws and did not record a place.
Stanford also has two entrants in the women's
5,000 meters. Sophomore Aisling Cuffe is seeded
22nd (16:15.53) while junior teammate Jessica
Tonn (16:21.21) is a spot behind.
After a strong performance at preliminaries,
the Stanford women moved up a spot to No. 11 in
the country, but the team is still projected to fin
ish far behind national leaders Kansas, Texas
A&M, Florida, LSU and Oregon, who are all
bringing at least 12 entries to the national cham
pionships.
Just three Stanford men earned spots in na
tionals, leaving the Cardinal's focus squarely on
individual performances.
Junior Erik Olson is Stanford's top-ranked
racer with a No. 8 seed in the 5,000-meter run
(13:53.68). Arizona junior Lawi Lalang tops the
field with a seed time of 13:41.87.
In the 400-meter dash, Steven Solomon is
ranked 16th. The freshman qualified for nation
als with a 10th place finish at preliminaries in just
his fourth meet for the Cardinal this season.
Solomon competed for Australia in the 2012
Olympics but has struggled with injuries while
on the Farm.
The third member of the men's squad is jun
ior Tyler Stutzman, who is seeded 23rd in the
1,500-meter run (3:49.80). The two-time Ail-
American led Stanford with a fourth-place fin
ish in the mile at the 2013 Indoor National
Championships and will look to do the same in
the slightly shorter outdoor event.

onships begin today at 1:30 p.m. and will contin
