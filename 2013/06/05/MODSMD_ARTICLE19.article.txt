# THE 						ROW
## From columbae with love

CCT K 7* at do you miss
% /\ / most about living
V V in Columbae?" I
asked Graham Roth 'l2 M.S. 'l3, a
co-term who was the house's RA
last year. He thought to himself for
a moment, and then smiled a little
wistfully.
"Just constantly being sur
rounded by all these people. I go
home and it's me and my room
mate, and it's nice to get quiet
sometimes. But last year I would
go to my room and know that any
minute I could open the door or
go to the kitchen and there would
be two or three people there."
If Columbae has a heart, it's
the kitchen. If you're ever feeling
lonely in the middle of the night,
just plop yourself at the wood
block; you'll be surrounded by
friends in no time. At the juncture
of food and people: that's where
you'll find the house's soul.
"I will miss most the
impromptu gatherings of a lot of
people I enjoy being around,"
Chana Rose Rabinovitz 'l3 told
me. "It happened the other night in
our lounge. There were just twenty
of us doing homework because we
wanted to be around each other.
We live with 53 people. There's
nowhere else in the world where I
could casually sit with 30 people in
my living room. And I think you
learn so much in those moments."
Columbae is kind of built for
moments like these. When you live
with 50 people in a house designed
for 30, your lives tend to overlap
just like your personal space.

Hence a lot of woodblock-talk and
spontaneous hanging-out, like
when I wandered into a neighbor's
Bollywood movie night.
Living in Columbae, it's hard
not to feel the echoes of previous
generations. I get the sense we're
carrying a torch of some kind. The
Polaroids of old Beans are still

tacked onto the computer cluster
door. Time-honored wisdom is
sprinkled throughout the kitchen,
like yellowing, handwritten
instructions for making bread that
are still known as the "Bible of
Good Bread-Making."
Last fall, a bunch of Columbae
alums came to visit. One afternoon

I was in my room, putting on
sneakers to go to the gym when a
man walked in. He was 50-some
thing years old, wearing a psyche
delic vest. He told us he had lived
in this room; would it be okay if he
looked around? 'Sure,' we said, and
showed him our star projector. He
lied down on the floor. He had fall

en in love in this very room, he
told us. He took it all in: the paint
ed-on fireplace, the open window,
the fire escape. Seeing his wistful
brown eyes, I realized that all of
these are much more than features
of a building. The woodblock, the
conch shell, the rocking chairs:
they too, like every mural and
hand-drawn sign, are the house's
talismans. They keep its spirit alive.
It reminds me of something
Graham said: "There's something
about how, once you've lived here,
the house sort of settles into you.
Physically being here is very peace
ful for me."
I asked Francisca Gilmore 'l3
if she ever worried about the house
retaining its character. "No," she
replied, smiling towards the lawn.
"Though the community changes
every year, the vibrancy of the
house continues. There will always
be things in Columbae that bring
the community together. The
kitchen will always be the kitchen."
There are signs this year's
coming to a close. The books in the
cluster are packed into boxes; the
seniors are ordering banana suits
for graduation. As people leave for
home, the house will grow quiet,
and eventually, it'll be silent. I'll be
staying past graduation on extend
ed housing and in a bittersweet
coincidence, it'll be in the same

room where I slept on a bare mat
tress the night before school last
September.
When I leave, what will I miss?
I'll miss falling asleep to the smell
of rosemary bread, the sound of
the conch shell, the afternoon light
falling on the front porch. I'll miss
the woodblock's promise of com
pany. I've never lived in a place so
alive with voices; I grew up in
houses populated by two people.
To think: this only child, introvert

and lover of silence, now craves the
presence of people, voices, conver
sations. Few places could effect
such a dramatic reversal. Taking
the words right out of my mouth,
Katie Kramon 'l5 tells me: "I've
never felt as at home as I have in
Columbae."
I have learned more from liv
ing here than any formal educa
tion. This place taught me how to
cook and compost, but it's also
healed me in away. I've relearned
that people will accept and love
you if you give them a chance. The
come-as-you-are' mentality is the
beautiful thing about Columbae.
It's just like Chana Rose says: "If
you want to be a part of the com
munity at Columbae, you can. If
you are willing to put in time and
energy to be a part of this, then
you can. We're not going to ask

anything else of you."
She and Noemi Walzebuck 'l3
are standing across from me on the
other side of the woodblock. Joni
Mitchell is singing through the
speakers; dinner crew is chopping
up a storm. Munching on a slice of
bread, Noemi offers a parting
thought: "There are few houses on
campus, and in the world, where
you're just very happy to go home."
That I will never again share a
house with this precise alchemy of
people is the saddest part about
leaving this place. But all good
things must come to an end, and
I'm glad the woodblock and con
sensus will be here to keep the spir
it going. Who knows? Maybe in 30
years, I'll come visit and plop
myself down on some confused
kid's floor. Closing my eyes, I'll tell
him the story of when I lived here.

% /\ / most about living
V V in Columbae?" I
asked Graham Roth 'l2 M.S. 'l3, a
co-term who was the house's RA
last year. He thought to himself for
a moment, and then smiled a little
wistfully.
"Just constantly being sur
rounded by all these people. I go
home and it's me and my room
mate, and it's nice to get quiet
sometimes. But last year I would
go to my room and know that any
minute I could open the door or
go to the kitchen and there would
be two or three people there."
If Columbae has a heart, it's
the kitchen. If you're ever feeling
lonely in the middle of the night,
just plop yourself at the wood
block; you'll be surrounded by
friends in no time. At the juncture
of food and people: that's where
you'll find the house's soul.
"I will miss most the
impromptu gatherings of a lot of
people I enjoy being around,"
Chana Rose Rabinovitz 'l3 told
me. "It happened the other night in
our lounge. There were just twenty
of us doing homework because we
wanted to be around each other.
We live with 53 people. There's
nowhere else in the world where I
could casually sit with 30 people in
my living room. And I think you
learn so much in those moments."
Columbae is kind of built for
moments like these. When you live
with 50 people in a house designed
for 30, your lives tend to overlap
just like your personal space.

Hence a lot of woodblock-talk and
spontaneous hanging-out, like
when I wandered into a neighbor's
Bollywood movie night.
Living in Columbae, it's hard
not to feel the echoes of previous
generations. I get the sense we're
carrying a torch of some kind. The
Polaroids of old Beans are still

tacked onto the computer cluster
door. Time-honored wisdom is
sprinkled throughout the kitchen,
like yellowing, handwritten
instructions for making bread that
are still known as the "Bible of
Good Bread-Making."
Last fall, a bunch of Columbae
alums came to visit. One afternoon

I was in my room, putting on
sneakers to go to the gym when a
man walked in. He was 50-some
thing years old, wearing a psyche
delic vest. He told us he had lived
in this room; would it be okay if he
looked around? 'Sure,' we said, and
showed him our star projector. He
lied down on the floor. He had fall

en in love in this very room, he
told us. He took it all in: the paint
ed-on fireplace, the open window,
the fire escape. Seeing his wistful
brown eyes, I realized that all of
these are much more than features
of a building. The woodblock, the
conch shell, the rocking chairs:
they too, like every mural and
hand-drawn sign, are the house's
talismans. They keep its spirit alive.
It reminds me of something
Graham said: "There's something
about how, once you've lived here,
the house sort of settles into you.
Physically being here is very peace
ful for me."
I asked Francisca Gilmore 'l3
if she ever worried about the house
retaining its character. "No," she
replied, smiling towards the lawn.
"Though the community changes
every year, the vibrancy of the
house continues. There will always
be things in Columbae that bring
the community together. The
kitchen will always be the kitchen."
There are signs this year's
coming to a close. The books in the
cluster are packed into boxes; the
seniors are ordering banana suits
for graduation. As people leave for
home, the house will grow quiet,
and eventually, it'll be silent. I'll be
staying past graduation on extend
ed housing and in a bittersweet
coincidence, it'll be in the same

room where I slept on a bare mat
tress the night before school last
September.
When I leave, what will I miss?
I'll miss falling asleep to the smell
of rosemary bread, the sound of
the conch shell, the afternoon light
falling on the front porch. I'll miss
the woodblock's promise of com
pany. I've never lived in a place so
alive with voices; I grew up in
houses populated by two people.
To think: this only child, introvert

and lover of silence, now craves the
presence of people, voices, conver
sations. Few places could effect
such a dramatic reversal. Taking
the words right out of my mouth,
Katie Kramon 'l5 tells me: "I've
never felt as at home as I have in
Columbae."
I have learned more from liv
ing here than any formal educa
tion. This place taught me how to
cook and compost, but it's also
healed me in away. I've relearned
that people will accept and love
you if you give them a chance. The
come-as-you-are' mentality is the
beautiful thing about Columbae.
It's just like Chana Rose says: "If
you want to be a part of the com
munity at Columbae, you can. If
you are willing to put in time and
energy to be a part of this, then
you can. We're not going to ask

anything else of you."
She and Noemi Walzebuck 'l3
are standing across from me on the
other side of the woodblock. Joni
Mitchell is singing through the
speakers; dinner crew is chopping
up a storm. Munching on a slice of
bread, Noemi offers a parting
thought: "There are few houses on
campus, and in the world, where
you're just very happy to go home."
That I will never again share a
house with this precise alchemy of
people is the saddest part about
leaving this place. But all good
things must come to an end, and
I'm glad the woodblock and con
sensus will be here to keep the spir
it going. Who knows? Maybe in 30
years, I'll come visit and plop
myself down on some confused
kid's floor. Closing my eyes, I'll tell
him the story of when I lived here.
