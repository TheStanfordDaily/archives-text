V V in Columbae?" I
asked Graham Roth 'l2 M.S. 'l3, a
co-term who was the house's RA
last year. He thought to himself for
a moment, and then smiled a little
wistfully.
"Just constantly being sur
rounded by all these people. I go
home and it's me and my room
mate, and it's nice to get quiet
sometimes. But last year I would
go to my room and know that any
minute I could open the door or
go to the kitchen and there would
be two or three people there."
If Columbae has a heart, it's
the kitchen. If you're ever feeling
lonely in the middle of the night,
just plop yourself at the wood
block; you'll be surrounded by
friends in no time. At the juncture
of food and people: that's where
you'll find the house's soul.
"I will miss most the
impromptu gatherings of a lot of
people I enjoy being around,"
Chana Rose Rabinovitz 'l3 told
me. "It happened the other night in
our lounge. There were just twenty
of us doing homework because we
wanted to be around each other.
We live with 53 people. There's
nowhere else in the world where I
could casually sit with 30 people in
my living room. And I think you
learn so much in those moments."
Columbae is kind of built for
moments like these. When you live
with 50 people in a house designed
for 30, your lives tend to overlap
just like your personal space.

Hence a lot of woodblock-talk and
spontaneous hanging-out, like
when I wandered into a neighbor's
Bollywood movie night.
Living in Columbae, it's hard
not to feel the echoes of previous
generations. I get the sense we're
carrying a torch of some kind. The
Polaroids of old Beans are still

tacked onto the computer cluster
door. Time-honored wisdom is
sprinkled throughout the kitchen,
like yellowing, handwritten
instructions for making bread that
are still known as the "Bible of
Good Bread-Making."
Last fall, a bunch of Columbae
alums came to visit. One afternoon

I was in my room, putting on
sneakers to go to the gym when a
man walked in. He was 50-some
thing years old, wearing a psyche
delic vest. He told us he had lived
in this room; would it be okay if he
looked around? 'Sure,' we said, and
showed him our star projector. He
lied down on the floor. He had fall

en in love in this very room, he
told us. He took it all in: the paint
ed-on fireplace, the open window,
the fire escape. Seeing his wistful
brown eyes, I realized that all of
these are much more than features
of a building. The woodblock, the
conch shell, the rocking chairs:
they too, like every mural and
hand-drawn sign, are the house's
talismans. They keep its spirit alive.
It reminds me of something
Graham said: "There's something
about how, once you've lived here,
the house sort of settles into you.
Physically being here is very peace
ful for me."
I asked Francisca Gilmore 'l3
if she ever worried about the house
retaining its character. "No," she
replied, smiling towards the lawn.
"Though the community changes
every year, the vibrancy of the
house continues. There will always
be things in Columbae that bring
the community together. The
kitchen will always be the kitchen."
There are signs this year's
coming to a close. The books in the
cluster are packed into boxes; the
seniors are ordering banana suits
for graduation. As people leave for
home, the house will grow quiet,
and eventually, it'll be silent. I'll be
staying past graduation on extend
ed housing and in a bittersweet
coincidence, it'll be in the same
