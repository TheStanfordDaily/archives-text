# University plans to grow undergrad population

### SABELLE SMYTHE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At his annual presentation to the
Academic Council last month, Pres
ident John Hennessy announced a
plan to expand the undergraduate
student body in an attempt to keep
pace with the growth of the gradu
ate student population and allow
Stanford to serve more students, a
proposal with broad implications for
University admissions, facilities and
faculty.
The large size of the graduate
student population 8,871 stu
dents compared to 6,999 under
graduatesâ€” marks a sharp rever
sal from the enrollment trends that
have dominated much of Stanford's
history.
In every decade until 1990, the
undergraduate population exceeded
the graduate one. The gap nar
rowed by 1980, when the student
body was about evenly split. Since
then, the graduate population has

continued to grow rapidly while the
number of undergraduates has re
mained relatively constant.
Jeffrey Wachtel '79, senior assis
tant to President Hennessy, noted
that Hennessy sees several benefits
in attempting to expand the under

graduate population and believes
the expansion can be accomplished
without "sacrificing the quality of
the undergraduate experience."
"We want to retain our identity
as both an undergraduate and a
graduate institution," Wachtel said.

"Although the numbers are relative
ly small that we can add, we think
it's sort of an obligation for the Uni
versity."
Hennessy said that he would like
the undergraduate population to ex
pand soon to counteract the growth
of the graduate and postdoctoral
populations over the last few
decades.
"If we assume that there's going
to be some continuing growth in the
graduate population, perhaps at a
slower rate, then we will, over the
next 20 years or so, completely
make it impossible to contemplate
increasing the undergraduate popu
lation, because the grad population
will have taken up all the space on
campus," Hennessy said.
More housing
Though the expansion could be
gin as early as 2014, according to
Wachtel, the growth in the popula
tion would also need to be accompa
nied by new facilities to maintain

the University's guarantee of hous
ing to all undergraduates. The Uni
versity, fresh off a Draw that left a
record number of students unas
signed after the first round, already
plans to build new housing at Man
zanita Park and Lagunita Court.
"Since we believe strongly in a
residential education system, we
have to make sure there are ade
quate housing and facilities," Wach
tel said. "It depends on the planning
of the housing and raising the mon
ey for it."
Once housing options are adjust
ed, Wachtel said that the University
will begin increasing the size of the
undergraduate population by ap
proximately 100 students per year,
with a plan to reevaluate the rate of
expansion over time.
According to Hennessy, the up
per bound on the population expan
sion would be 25 percent, as growth
that is too dramatic could alter the
