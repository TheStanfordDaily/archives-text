# University plans to grow undergrad population
## 
### SABELLE SMYTHE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At his annual presentation to the
Academic Council last month, Pres
ident John Hennessy announced a
plan to expand the undergraduate
student body in an attempt to keep
pace with the growth of the gradu
ate student population and allow
Stanford to serve more students, a
proposal with broad implications for
University admissions, facilities and
faculty.
The large size of the graduate
student population 8,871 stu
dents compared to 6,999 under
graduatesâ€” marks a sharp rever
sal from the enrollment trends that
have dominated much of Stanford's
history.
In every decade until 1990, the
undergraduate population exceeded
the graduate one. The gap nar
rowed by 1980, when the student
body was about evenly split. Since
then, the graduate population has

continued to grow rapidly while the
number of undergraduates has re
mained relatively constant.
Jeffrey Wachtel '79, senior assis
tant to President Hennessy, noted
that Hennessy sees several benefits
in attempting to expand the under

graduate population and believes
the expansion can be accomplished
without "sacrificing the quality of
the undergraduate experience."
"We want to retain our identity
as both an undergraduate and a
graduate institution," Wachtel said.

"Although the numbers are relative
ly small that we can add, we think
it's sort of an obligation for the Uni
versity."
Hennessy said that he would like
the undergraduate population to ex
pand soon to counteract the growth
of the graduate and postdoctoral
populations over the last few
decades.
"If we assume that there's going
to be some continuing growth in the
graduate population, perhaps at a
slower rate, then we will, over the
next 20 years or so, completely
make it impossible to contemplate
increasing the undergraduate popu
lation, because the grad population
will have taken up all the space on
campus," Hennessy said.
More housing
Though the expansion could be
gin as early as 2014, according to
Wachtel, the growth in the popula
tion would also need to be accompa
nied by new facilities to maintain

the University's guarantee of hous
ing to all undergraduates. The Uni
versity, fresh off a Draw that left a
record number of students unas
signed after the first round, already
plans to build new housing at Man
zanita Park and Lagunita Court.
"Since we believe strongly in a
residential education system, we
have to make sure there are ade
quate housing and facilities," Wach
tel said. "It depends on the planning
of the housing and raising the mon
ey for it."
Once housing options are adjust
ed, Wachtel said that the University
will begin increasing the size of the
undergraduate population by ap
proximately 100 students per year,
with a plan to reevaluate the rate of
expansion over time.
According to Hennessy, the up
per bound on the population expan
sion would be 25 percent, as growth
that is too dramatic could alter the

undergraduate experience.
"Everybody has that sense that
at some size the experience would
change in a qualitative way, but no
body knows what that size is. If we
had 16,000 [students], it would be
very different to be an undergradu
ate on campus," he said. "That's far
beyond what we're thinking but
the nice thing of doing this gradual
ly is that you can get some sense of
what's changing."
Role of admissions
University officials noted that it
is easier to target a specific number

of admits for the undergraduate
population compared to graduates,

as the nature of graduate admis
sions makes it difficult to systemat
ically increase or decrease the num
ber of students admitted each year.
'Admissions at the graduate level
is very decentralized to depart
ments," said Vice Provost for Gradu
ate Education Patricia Gumport
MA 'B2 MA 'B6 Ph.D. 'B7. "At the
undergraduate level, it's very cen
tralized there's one admissions of
fice. So that's why the enrollment can
be managed at the undergrad level."
While undergraduate enroll
ment has remained fairly constant
over the last three decades, the
number of applications received by
the Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission has skyrocketed.
Hennessy cited this increase in
applications as a key reason behind
the decision to expand the under
graduate population, estimating
that the number of highly qualified

applicants has roughly doubled dur
ing his tenure.
"The acceptance rate has plum
meted," Hennessy said. "A general
sense that the number of students
who are prepared to do work at a
place like Stanford has grown sig
nificantly is reflected in our applica
tion pool."
According to Hennessy, the Uni
versity had previously planned to
begin offering more spots to these
applicants, but the 2008 financial
crisis set back the idea. The gradual
recovery of the endowment has
prompted a renewed focus on ex
pansion.
"For many years, growth was
accommodated by the public insti
tutions, namely the [University of
California schools], but given the
state dilemma over finances I don't
think we're going to see tremen
dous expansion of the state sys

tem," Hennessy said. "So I feel
there's some obligation [on] the pri
vate institutions to step forward
and see what they can do."
More faculty, internationals
An expansion in the undergrad
uate population may ultimately
prove beneficial for graduate pro
grams as well, with more under
graduates necessitating the hiring
of additional faculty members.
"Graduate enrollment expands
keeping pace with faculty growth,
because as new faculty come in, we
have a certain number of doctoral
students that we can anticipate,"
Gumport said. "As we grow the un
dergraduate enrollment at whatev
er pace the President deems appro
priate, it's likely that there will be
some faculty growth, and with fac
ulty growth there could be some
grad student growth."
However, Hennessy noted that
the faculty population would likely
not grow at the same rate as the un
dergraduate population. He added
that the University is not looking to
add faculty in all areas.
"Exactly how much the faculty
would grow by depends on a lot of
issues," Hennessy said. "It's varied

up and down over time. There's
been a lot more faculty growth over

the last 30 years than there has
been undergraduate growth."
Approximately seven percent of
undergraduates are international
students, while a third of graduate
students come to Stanford from
abroad, a difference that Hennessy
said was a factor to be considered
with respect to expanding the un
dergraduate population. "We
slowly, over time, would like to in
troduce more international stu
dents, depending on what happens
with international student recruit
ing and the shift in demographics
on that side," he said.
Ultimately, the University hopes
to serve more students without re
ducing the quality of the education
provided to both undergraduates
and graduates, according to Hen
nessy.
"I think the goal would be to do
this in away that did not interfere
with or hamper the current experi
ence," he said. "That will obviously

mean that there will be have to be
some fundraising done for it. I
think it's doable."
