## BLOCKBUSTERS SUMMER What to see in theaters over the break 
### INTERMISSION STAFF 
Summer is almost here (so
close!), and with warmer
weather usually comes a wave
of great movies. Summer has his
torically been a time for block
busters (think "The Avengers,"
"Harry Potter," "The Dark Knight
Rises") breaking records, and there
are a couple of films that we at
Intermission are sure will be box
office hits. Check them out:
"Man of Steel"
"Man of Steel" is expected to be
the largest seller in the June-August
slot, with over 100 promotional

British actor Henry Cavill plays a
hunky Clark Kent, while Amy

"The Bling Ring"
"The Bling Ring" opened the Un
Certain Regard section of Cannes,
and though it has been given
mixed reviews by the press, the
film is almost certain to be a box
office favorite. Emma Watson stars
as Nicki (a character based off for
mer "Pretty Wild" star Alexis
Neiers), one of the members of the
'Bling Ring,' a set of Hollywood

teens that broke into the swankiest
L.A. houses, including those of
Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan, in
the late 'oos.
"The Heat"
The director of "Bridesmaids"
returns with Academy Award

nominee Melissa McCartney for
"The Heat," in which McCartney
plays a detective who teams up
with an FBI agent (Sandra
Bullock) to hunt a Russian mob
ster. It might actually be funnier
than "Bridesmaids." Just watch the
trailer.

"The Wolverine"
The sixth installment of the X-Men
film series features Hugh Jackman
again as Wolverine, along with
newcomer/model Tao Okamoto as
his onscreen-lover. Although the
film has garnered little promotion

al traction, the recent success of the
comic genre along with, to be
honest, the presence of Hugh
Jackman ensures that "The
Wolverine" will have a huge open
