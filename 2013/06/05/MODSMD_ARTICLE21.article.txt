## MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING Joss Whedon film outshines the original 
### Alexandra Heeney | STAFF WRITER 
Twenty years ago, Kenneth Branagh adapted
and directed William Shakespeare's "Much
Ado About Nothing" for the screen in what
remains a cinematic masterpiece, one I consid
ered definitive until Joss Whedon adapted and
directed his modern-day version. Branagh's
"Much Ado About Nothing" plays it straight,
cherishing the witty dialogue and capturing all
of its humor and nuance. Emma Thompson as
Beatrice and Branagh as Benedick form a
charismatic, good-humored and enviably
clever couple that verbally spars until the dag
gers become Cupid's arrows. Branagh's ver
sion had its minor flaws such as casting
Keanu Reeves as Don John but it is pitch
perfect in almost every other way. It's a tough
act to follow.
"She speaks poniards and every word
stabs!" says Benedick of Beatrice, and this line
takes on very different meanings in the two
films. In Branagh's version, their warring is
merry and the would-be lovers are impervi
ous to real hurt; Benedick is merely exasperat
ed by Beatrice's mordant one-liners at his
expense. But in Whedon's film, it's something
much darker: the piercing words wound.
Whedon's film opens on Beatrice (Amy
Acker) and Benedick (Alexis Denisof) in bed
together, as Benedick sneaks out in the morn
ing and Beatrice pretends to still be sleeping.
Their repartee that follows is vicious; it's not
meant to entertain their friends but to mask
their own insecurities. This gives believable
motivation for their witty dialogue, but their
very self-absorption and emotional manipula
tion and inattentiveness to their friends
make them incredibly hard to like and the
dialogue hard to delight in for its nastiness.
Even Benedick's devotion to celibacy seems a
sign of emotional underdevelopment when
declared in a children's room filled with toys.

The film was shot in Whedon's home, a
large house in California where he has hosted
Shakespearian readings with his television
actors since the days of "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer," many of whom form the cast. In this
house, which in the film belongs to Leonato
(Clark Gregg) who hosts scores of guests, pri
vacy seems possible, but conversations are
constantly and effortlessly overheard. The
intimate setting is appropriate for a film that
focuses on the psychological motivations of
the characters, often at the sacrifice of the
comedy; so many lines that should be funny
don't land. Sean Maher's Don John the evil
bastard brother of the Prince, Don Pedro is
a revelation, declaring his own villainy to
Conrade, now a woman, as a means of sexual
seduction. Franz Kranz's Claudio, the lovesick
companion of Benedick, is less the dopey
lover than a believably impetuous one, quick
to fall in and out of love and to believe any
thing.
Whedon makes excellent use of juxtapos
ing action in the foreground with that in the
background, a theatrical technique that he
transfers flawlessly to film by having action in
the background slowly come into focus, or
sometimes cutting between the two. When
Claudio, Don Pedro and Leonato fictitiously
declare Beatrice's supposed love for Benedick
purposefully, within earshot of the latter for
his benefit they do so indoors, their backs to
the window, carefully pretending not to notice
Benedick eavesdropping outside. They even
give each other tacit feedback on their per
formance as it happens, especially when
Claudio goes over the top by waxing poetic.
This also serves to highlight the ever-present
theme of performance: Beatrice and Benedick
are actively performing hatred for each other
while their friends concoct performances for

their benefit to help them surmount their neu
roses.
But the film is uneven and the very things
that make this production unique and
thought-provoking are also its greatest down
falls. The focus on realistic emotions in the
beginning only makes the already-preposterous
last third of the script even harder to believe,
especially since Whedon tries to lay the melo
drama on thickly. Even the farce that ensues to
bring our lovers together, which is replete with
physical comedy, capturing the spirit if not the
dynamism of Shakespeare's words, seems out
of place in this darker world. Although Nathan
Fillion as the head of security (Dogberry) and
Tom Lenk as his sidekick (Verges) are perfect
as the incompetent tag-team, the clever way in
which they follow the tropes of film noir to
spoof it make it out of place, except for the
appropriate black-and-white photography.
Joss Whedon's "Much Ado About
Nothing" is a good film and a competent,
though flawed, adaptation. The modernization
of the play is seamless, with well-chosen set
tings and flawless party scenes; the black-and
white photography give it a timeless (if nostal
gic) quality, helping us at times to suspend our
disbelief even as the plot strains believability.
But the film serves more to point out the flaws
in Branagh's version, offering alternate inter
pretations, or forcing one to think more criti
cally about his choices, than as a stand-alone,
cohesive production. The film's devotion to
realism at the start highlights how dated the
plot is, even though Shakespeare's characters
are still thoroughly modern.
Although "Much Ado" keeps the Bard's

words intact, its main purpose is not to delight
us with them by making us fall in love with
Benedick and Beatrice's use of them, robbing
us of the play's greatest pleasure.

pretations, or forcing one to think more criti
cally about his choices, than as a stand-alone,
cohesive production. The film's devotion to
realism at the start highlights how dated the
plot is, even though Shakespeare's characters
are still thoroughly modern.
Although "Much Ado" keeps the Bard's

words intact, its main purpose is not to delight
us with them by making us fall in love with
Benedick and Beatrice's use of them, robbing
us of the play's greatest pleasure.

Twenty years ago, Kenneth Branagh adapted
and directed William Shakespeare's "Much
Ado About Nothing" for the screen in what
remains a cinematic masterpiece, one I consid
ered definitive until Joss Whedon adapted and
directed his modern-day version. Branagh's
"Much Ado About Nothing" plays it straight,
cherishing the witty dialogue and capturing all
of its humor and nuance. Emma Thompson as
Beatrice and Branagh as Benedick form a
charismatic, good-humored and enviably
clever couple that verbally spars until the dag
gers become Cupid's arrows. Branagh's ver
sion had its minor flaws such as casting
Keanu Reeves as Don John but it is pitch
perfect in almost every other way. It's a tough
act to follow.
"She speaks poniards and every word
stabs!" says Benedick of Beatrice, and this line
takes on very different meanings in the two
films. In Branagh's version, their warring is
merry and the would-be lovers are impervi
ous to real hurt; Benedick is merely exasperat
ed by Beatrice's mordant one-liners at his
expense. But in Whedon's film, it's something
much darker: the piercing words wound.
Whedon's film opens on Beatrice (Amy
Acker) and Benedick (Alexis Denisof) in bed
together, as Benedick sneaks out in the morn
ing and Beatrice pretends to still be sleeping.
Their repartee that follows is vicious; it's not
meant to entertain their friends but to mask
their own insecurities. This gives believable
motivation for their witty dialogue, but their
very self-absorption and emotional manipula
tion and inattentiveness to their friends
make them incredibly hard to like and the
dialogue hard to delight in for its nastiness.
Even Benedick's devotion to celibacy seems a
sign of emotional underdevelopment when
declared in a children's room filled with toys.

The film was shot in Whedon's home, a
large house in California where he has hosted
Shakespearian readings with his television
actors since the days of "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer," many of whom form the cast. In this
house, which in the film belongs to Leonato
(Clark Gregg) who hosts scores of guests, pri
vacy seems possible, but conversations are
constantly and effortlessly overheard. The
intimate setting is appropriate for a film that
focuses on the psychological motivations of
the characters, often at the sacrifice of the
comedy; so many lines that should be funny
don't land. Sean Maher's Don John the evil
bastard brother of the Prince, Don Pedro is
a revelation, declaring his own villainy to
Conrade, now a woman, as a means of sexual
seduction. Franz Kranz's Claudio, the lovesick
companion of Benedick, is less the dopey
lover than a believably impetuous one, quick
to fall in and out of love and to believe any
thing.
Whedon makes excellent use of juxtapos
ing action in the foreground with that in the
background, a theatrical technique that he
transfers flawlessly to film by having action in
the background slowly come into focus, or
sometimes cutting between the two. When
Claudio, Don Pedro and Leonato fictitiously
declare Beatrice's supposed love for Benedick
purposefully, within earshot of the latter for
his benefit they do so indoors, their backs to
the window, carefully pretending not to notice
Benedick eavesdropping outside. They even
give each other tacit feedback on their per
formance as it happens, especially when
Claudio goes over the top by waxing poetic.
This also serves to highlight the ever-present
theme of performance: Beatrice and Benedick
are actively performing hatred for each other
while their friends concoct performances for

their benefit to help them surmount their neu
roses.
But the film is uneven and the very things
that make this production unique and
thought-provoking are also its greatest down
falls. The focus on realistic emotions in the
beginning only makes the already-preposterous
last third of the script even harder to believe,
especially since Whedon tries to lay the melo
drama on thickly. Even the farce that ensues to
bring our lovers together, which is replete with
physical comedy, capturing the spirit if not the
dynamism of Shakespeare's words, seems out
of place in this darker world. Although Nathan
Fillion as the head of security (Dogberry) and
Tom Lenk as his sidekick (Verges) are perfect
as the incompetent tag-team, the clever way in
which they follow the tropes of film noir to
spoof it make it out of place, except for the
appropriate black-and-white photography.
Joss Whedon's "Much Ado About
Nothing" is a good film and a competent,
though flawed, adaptation. The modernization
of the play is seamless, with well-chosen set
tings and flawless party scenes; the black-and
white photography give it a timeless (if nostal
gic) quality, helping us at times to suspend our
disbelief even as the plot strains believability.

pretations, or forcing one to think more criti
cally about his choices, than as a stand-alone,
