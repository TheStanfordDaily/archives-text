cc -w-see you Twerk Team!"
I bleated everyone's
-A-favorite audience mem
ber from over my shoulder.
As the lights went down, I
thought that maybe this arm in
my face was trying to get my
attention, but no the girl it was
attached to was seeking the best
angle for an overexposed
Snapchat of Urban Styles's open
ing number.
Eardrums and personal space

aside, if there was something
remarkable about the audience
for Stanford dance company's
Sunday show, it was the enthusi
asm and love with which they
approached their fellow students.
"The members of the group
are not only incredibly talented
dancers and choreographers, but
also great people," said Paula
Obler 'l3, who joined Urban
Styles this year and danced in
multiple pieces during the show.

"Dancing with the group was
always one of the highlights of
my week."
Friends and community
members filled Dinkelspiel
Auditorium at 8 p.m., eager to
catch a glimpse of various
acquaintances performing beauti
ful movements, or maybe just to
listen to the seemingly never-end
ing stream of puns made by the
MC on the show's title: "Lost in a
Dream."

The spring show represented
a culmination of Urban Styles's
work for the year. The perform
ance featured a variety of styles
and on-campus dance groups,
including Alliance, Jam Pac'd,
DvB, HD Crew, Cardinal Ballet,
Common Origins and TapTh@t.
With a lineup like that, there's
something for everyone who
couldn't bear another pre-finals
hour slumped over a desk in
Green.
Integrating bits of Beyonce's
"End of Time" and Icona Pop's
Billboard hit "I Love It" among
Cardinal Ballet's delicate classical
interlude, the performers knew
how to reach everyone in the
audience.
As with any culminating
show, "Lost in a Dream" was a
closing at the end of the show,
team members were forced to bid
farewell to the graduating seniors,
some of whom had danced with
the group for years.
This year marked some
changes for Stanford's one and
only dance company. The group
has grown in size because of the

increased number of auditions
from the talented student body,
perhaps reflecting the university
wide trend in growing class sizes.
This year, Stanford reviewed
38,828 applications for a spot in
the Class of 2017 more than

2,000 more applications than the
previous year, and more total
applications than any year in the
past.

Though this increase in stu
dent population may have unfor
tunate consequences for traffic in
the circle of death and the number
of minutes you have to wait in line
at the Axe and Palm on any given
Friday, it benefits the diversity of

the growing student body. In addi
tion to more dancers, Urban Styles
also had a more diverse range of
contemporary, jazz and modern
backgrounds in its performers
than in previous years.

Lindsay Fiorentino 'l6, who
joined Urban Styles this year,
found the new experience to be
exceptionally worthwhile. "I was so
happy I auditioned for it, especial
ly coming from high school,

because I was able to find a team
where people are totally goofy and
open and also share a passion for
dance," she said, reflecting on her
experience. "It's been super fun and
rewarding at the same time."
