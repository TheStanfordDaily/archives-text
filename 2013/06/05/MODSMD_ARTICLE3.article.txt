## Tenure offers academic tests, rewards Assistant professors assessed on basis of teaching, research 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After years of graduate school
spent researching, reading, wilting
and publishing, the freshly-minted
Ph.D.s that Stanford hires as assis
tant professors each year might be
tempted to slow down. After all, for
many graduate students a faculty po
sition is the ultimate goal.
For new assistant professors, how
ever, another clock begins to tick im
mediately after they are hired: the
tenure clock. Though policies vary
slightly from university to university,
Stanford assistant professors gener
ally have seven years to show their
colleagues that they deserve the secu
rity of tenure.
Nearly 50 percent of assistant pro
fessors who are hired at Stanford will
go on to obtain tenure, according to
Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences Richard Sailer, who noted
that around 80 percent of those faculty
members who reached the point of be
ing considered for tenure are granted
it. Those seven years in between being
hired and being reviewed for tenure,
however, prompts scholar's to freneti
cally juggle the demands of teaching,
research, networking and life.
Tenure's significance
Sailer framed obtaining tenure as
a means of ensuring job security and
acquiring greater latitude for academ
ic investigation.
"[lt's about] having the sense of
freedom to pursue research directions
that are high-risk," he said. "It sur
prises trustees from the corporate
world that our faculty continue to
work and to be as productive as they
are given that they have jobs for life
after receiving tenure... The incen
tives at a place of this caliber are much
more peer recognition and just [the]
sheer joy of research and teaching."
"You are freed up to do research in
whatever you want," said Claire
Jarvis, assistant professor of English.
"You have a place in the department
even if the people in charge change."
For Chris Lowe, assistant profes
sor of biology, tenure allows a re
searcher doing basic scientific work
the chance to ride out periods of low
funding.
"You have the security to build a
risky research project that's high
yield but risky," Lowe said. "Not only
don't you have to worry about job se
curity, you might take more risk with
research than you would otherwise.
Tenure gives people a little more
space to take risks and create more
ambitious research goals."
For Aliya Saperstein, assistant
professor of sociology, tenure "is
there to protect innovative scholar
ship. Once you have tenure, you don't
have to worry about losing your job
[if] you're doing something cutting
edge or a little risky... In theory, you
can do better work because you're not
constantly seeking approval in ad
vance."
Working towards tenure
Assistant professors teach two to
four classes each year, along with
working on their own research in labs
and trying to get their work pub
lished in order to show their impact
and worth as professors. Expecta
tions for good academic work differ
from department to department.
"The main goal of tenure is to
make certain that the people given
tenure are the best in the world at
what they do," said Jim Plummer
M.5.'67 Ph.D.'7l, dean of the School
of Engineering.
To that end, according to Lowe,
the biology department focuses on
the quality and broad impact of its as
sistant professors' work.
"One way to evaluate if you have
an impact is the kind of publications
you produce," Lowe said. "Some uni
versities are really interested in how
many publications you've produced,
whereas other universities are more
interested in if you're published in
high-profile journals, which have
brought interest to not just your im
mediate field but a much broader
range of scientists."
In the English department, the
assistant professors are told from the
beginning what they are expected to
do in order to gain tenure.
"You must have one book in print
and be working towards publishing a
second [after seven years]," Jarvis
said. "It has to have an impact... Plus,
you have to have good course evalua
tions in the classes you teach and
show service to the University"
"In your day to day you focus on
classes, on grading, on students,"
Jarvis added "But you're still trying
to get a book published. It's still in the
back of your mind, always."
"[At Stanford], what matters is
the quality and the impact of your
work and if you are seen as someone
who is an expert in your subfield or
specialty... within your age cohort,"
Saperstein said. "Have you made
yourself stand out in your age co
hort?"
Typically, assistant professors are
aware of their progress and whether
they are on track for being granted
tenure, having been given feedback
when they are reappointed after four
years.
"You get an initial contract and
then are reviewed after three or four
years," Saperstein said of the depart
ment of sociology's process. 'At that
point, your department lets you know
if you're on track or not, if you need to
do more work. Then you're given an
other temporary contract and after
that you come up for tenure."
"After the mid-career review, you
typically take a sabbatical the next
year to give you more time to get
ready for tenure," she added.
"The way the process works in bi
ology is that there is a three-year - pe
riod where you are evaluated in a for
mal way by the department," Lowe
said. "They evaluate whether or not
you're getting grant funding and
whether you're getting published...
You're given a heads-up about any ob
vious problems you need to focus on
in terms of proceeding."
Tenure review
According to Sailer, the process
for earning tenure at Stanford is sim-

liar to that of peer institutions.
"The only thing that varies much
[between universities] is the use of ex
ternal committees at various points in
the process," he said. "Harvard has
this elaborate process with an ad-hoc
review by the president of the univer
sity with a committee that's made up
of half internal faculty, but from out
side the department, and half exter
nal faculty."
At Stanford, department chairs
appoint committees of departmental
faculty, who solicit external letters
and other assessments. If the depart
ment as a whole votes to support a
positive committee recommendation,
the candidacy is forwarded to an ap
pointment and promotion committee
in the school's dean's office.
That committee was recently
changed to be made up of department
chairs from the appropriate academic

cluster —social sciences, natural sci
ences or humanities —for each can-

didate, according to Sailer.
"What that means is that the com
mittee is made up of people closer to
the area of expertise of the person un
der consideration," he said. "That
provides a more sensible committee."
The dean of the school then de
cides whether to forward the applica
tion on to the Provost's office, where it
is reviewed by an advisory board and
the Provost.
Each committee considers every
case for tenure in that academic clus
ter, evaluating the assistant profes
sors primarily on two major areas: re
search and teaching.
"It's a combination of things,"
Plummer said. "Some are semi-quan
tifiable, such as the number of publi
cations or awards, talks that may
have been given at conferences in his
or her field... On the teaching side, we
look at student evaluations, the
amount of teaching done... along with
letters from external senior people in
the field of the candidate."
These letters are solicited from
12-15 external people in a leadership
position within the assistant profes
sor's field, according to Plummer. The
professors are also evaluated as com
pared to a peer group of four to six of
their peers.
"Ideally, [the peer group is com
posed of] recently tenured people in
peer institutions in similar fields,"
Plummer said. "We can make a spe
cific comparison of the impact and
contributions the Stanford candidate
has had with respect to their peers.
Where does the Stanford candidate
fit?"
"More people are working in in
terdisciplinary fields or multiple
fields and it becomes more difficult to
choose the right set of letter writers if
someone works in multiple areas or in
between areas," Plummer added. "It
can be hard to find peers in peer insti
tutions or finding referees who can
write about the whole spectrum...
You have to just recognize that some
one is working in multiple fields and
find people who can write for those
fields."
Course evaluations are included in
the tenure process, an input that
Sailer described as flawed.
"It's something less than a nu
anced response," he said. "Students
will pick out one number in the col
umn and mark it off down the page."
"We would like to assign as much
weight to teaching as to research
and we do take it seriously but if
we don't feel as if we've got good in
formation about [the professor's
teaching], it's hard to know what to
make of it," Sailer said.
That lack of information has a
broader impact on the way in which
the committees weight research and
teaching.
"You can't be a bad teacher and
get tenure," Sailer said. "You can't be
an average researcher and get tenure
...With teaching, we can probably
identify the 10 percent who are bril
liant and the 10 percent who are duds,
and the 80 percent in between [are]
very hard to rank in order."
If a professor is denied tenure,
they are given a year to find another
job, either elsewhere in academia or
in the corporate world.
"[The year] gives them the time to
do a careftd job search, time to figure
out how to deal with Ph.D. students
who haven't finished up their re
search, helping them find another ad
visor or getting them closer to finish
ing," Plummer said.
The future of tenure
As public funding for research and
for education diminishes, many insti
tutions across the country have cut
back on the number of tenured posi
tions they maintain. The Chronicle of
Higher Education reported in 2010
that the proportion of college instruc
tors who either had tenure or were on
the tenure track dropped from 57
percent in 1975 to just 31 percent in
2007.
Despite such national trends,
Sailer and Plummer said the Univer
sity, which currently has 1,995
tenured or tenure-line faculty, re
mained committed to maintaining the
system of tenure.
"There's a periodic question about
whether we keep the tenure system,
but I think it's here to stay for the
foreseeable future," Sailer said. "It's
hard to imagine, [because] the compe
tition for top faculty is intense, which
of our peer universities would do
away with the tenure system and con
tinue to try to recruit faculty."
In competing with its peer institu
tions for talented faculty, Sailer said
Stanford focuses its energies on at
tracting young academics with high
potential, with around 75 percent of
professorial appointments going to
assistant professors rather than
tenured faculty from other institu
tions.
"When we make decisions about
authorizing searches [for new facul
ty], we presume it's going to be an as
sistant professor search unless
there's some kind of programmatic
need for someone more senior," Sailer
said. "We see it as our responsibility
and goal to recruit young people who
are of the quality to make tenure and
then to nurture them in away that
they will succeed."

choose the right set of letter writers if
someone works in multiple areas or in
between areas," Plummer added. "It
can be hard to find peers in peer insti
tutions or finding referees who can
write about the whole spectrum...
You have to just recognize that some
one is working in multiple fields and
find people who can write for those
fields."
Course evaluations are included in
the tenure process, an input that
Sailer described as flawed.
"It's something less than a nu
anced response," he said. "Students
will pick out one number in the col
umn and mark it off down the page."
"We would like to assign as much
weight to teaching as to research
and we do take it seriously but if
we don't feel as if we've got good in
formation about [the professor's
teaching], it's hard to know what to
make of it," Sailer said.
That lack of information has a
broader impact on the way in which
the committees weight research and
teaching.
"You can't be a bad teacher and
get tenure," Sailer said. "You can't be
an average researcher and get tenure
...With teaching, we can probably
identify the 10 percent who are bril
liant and the 10 percent who are duds,
and the 80 percent in between [are]
very hard to rank in order."
If a professor is denied tenure,
they are given a year to find another
job, either elsewhere in academia or
in the corporate world.
"[The year] gives them the time to
do a careftd job search, time to figure
out how to deal with Ph.D. students
who haven't finished up their re
search, helping them find another ad
visor or getting them closer to finish
ing," Plummer said.
The future of tenure
As public funding for research and
for education diminishes, many insti
tutions across the country have cut
back on the number of tenured posi
tions they maintain. The Chronicle of
Higher Education reported in 2010
that the proportion of college instruc
tors who either had tenure or were on
the tenure track dropped from 57
percent in 1975 to just 31 percent in
2007.
Despite such national trends,
Sailer and Plummer said the Univer
sity, which currently has 1,995
tenured or tenure-line faculty, re
mained committed to maintaining the
system of tenure.
"There's a periodic question about
whether we keep the tenure system,
but I think it's here to stay for the
foreseeable future," Sailer said. "It's
hard to imagine, [because] the compe
tition for top faculty is intense, which
of our peer universities would do
away with the tenure system and con
tinue to try to recruit faculty."
In competing with its peer institu
tions for talented faculty, Sailer said
Stanford focuses its energies on at
tracting young academics with high
potential, with around 75 percent of
professorial appointments going to
assistant professors rather than
tenured faculty from other institu
tions.
"When we make decisions about
authorizing searches [for new facul
ty], we presume it's going to be an as
sistant professor search unless
there's some kind of programmatic
need for someone more senior," Sailer
said. "We see it as our responsibility
and goal to recruit young people who
are of the quality to make tenure and
then to nurture them in away that
they will succeed."

After years of graduate school
spent researching, reading, wilting
and publishing, the freshly-minted
Ph.D.s that Stanford hires as assis
tant professors each year might be
tempted to slow down. After all, for
many graduate students a faculty po
sition is the ultimate goal.
For new assistant professors, how
ever, another clock begins to tick im
mediately after they are hired: the
tenure clock. Though policies vary
slightly from university to university,
Stanford assistant professors gener
ally have seven years to show their
colleagues that they deserve the secu
rity of tenure.
Nearly 50 percent of assistant pro
fessors who are hired at Stanford will
go on to obtain tenure, according to
Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences Richard Sailer, who noted
that around 80 percent of those faculty
members who reached the point of be
ing considered for tenure are granted
it. Those seven years in between being
hired and being reviewed for tenure,
however, prompts scholar's to freneti
cally juggle the demands of teaching,
research, networking and life.
Tenure's significance
Sailer framed obtaining tenure as
a means of ensuring job security and
acquiring greater latitude for academ
ic investigation.
"[lt's about] having the sense of
freedom to pursue research directions
that are high-risk," he said. "It sur
prises trustees from the corporate
world that our faculty continue to
work and to be as productive as they
are given that they have jobs for life
after receiving tenure... The incen
tives at a place of this caliber are much
more peer recognition and just [the]
sheer joy of research and teaching."
"You are freed up to do research in
whatever you want," said Claire
Jarvis, assistant professor of English.
"You have a place in the department
even if the people in charge change."
For Chris Lowe, assistant profes
sor of biology, tenure allows a re
searcher doing basic scientific work
the chance to ride out periods of low
funding.
"You have the security to build a
risky research project that's high
yield but risky," Lowe said. "Not only
don't you have to worry about job se
curity, you might take more risk with
research than you would otherwise.
Tenure gives people a little more
space to take risks and create more
ambitious research goals."
For Aliya Saperstein, assistant
professor of sociology, tenure "is
there to protect innovative scholar
ship. Once you have tenure, you don't
have to worry about losing your job
[if] you're doing something cutting
edge or a little risky... In theory, you
can do better work because you're not
constantly seeking approval in ad
vance."
Working towards tenure
Assistant professors teach two to
four classes each year, along with
working on their own research in labs
and trying to get their work pub
lished in order to show their impact
and worth as professors. Expecta
tions for good academic work differ
from department to department.
"The main goal of tenure is to
make certain that the people given
tenure are the best in the world at
what they do," said Jim Plummer
M.5.'67 Ph.D.'7l, dean of the School
of Engineering.
To that end, according to Lowe,
the biology department focuses on
the quality and broad impact of its as
sistant professors' work.
"One way to evaluate if you have
an impact is the kind of publications
you produce," Lowe said. "Some uni
versities are really interested in how
many publications you've produced,
whereas other universities are more
interested in if you're published in
high-profile journals, which have
brought interest to not just your im
mediate field but a much broader
range of scientists."
In the English department, the
assistant professors are told from the
beginning what they are expected to
do in order to gain tenure.
"You must have one book in print
and be working towards publishing a
second [after seven years]," Jarvis
said. "It has to have an impact... Plus,
you have to have good course evalua
tions in the classes you teach and
show service to the University"
"In your day to day you focus on
classes, on grading, on students,"
Jarvis added "But you're still trying
to get a book published. It's still in the
back of your mind, always."
"[At Stanford], what matters is
the quality and the impact of your
work and if you are seen as someone
who is an expert in your subfield or
specialty... within your age cohort,"
Saperstein said. "Have you made
yourself stand out in your age co
hort?"
Typically, assistant professors are
aware of their progress and whether
they are on track for being granted
tenure, having been given feedback
when they are reappointed after four
years.
"You get an initial contract and
then are reviewed after three or four
years," Saperstein said of the depart
ment of sociology's process. 'At that
point, your department lets you know
if you're on track or not, if you need to
do more work. Then you're given an
other temporary contract and after
that you come up for tenure."
"After the mid-career review, you
typically take a sabbatical the next
year to give you more time to get
ready for tenure," she added.
"The way the process works in bi
ology is that there is a three-year - pe
riod where you are evaluated in a for
mal way by the department," Lowe
said. "They evaluate whether or not
you're getting grant funding and
whether you're getting published...
You're given a heads-up about any ob
vious problems you need to focus on
in terms of proceeding."
Tenure review
According to Sailer, the process
for earning tenure at Stanford is sim-

liar to that of peer institutions.
"The only thing that varies much
[between universities] is the use of ex
ternal committees at various points in
the process," he said. "Harvard has
this elaborate process with an ad-hoc
review by the president of the univer
sity with a committee that's made up
of half internal faculty, but from out
side the department, and half exter
nal faculty."
At Stanford, department chairs
appoint committees of departmental
faculty, who solicit external letters
and other assessments. If the depart
ment as a whole votes to support a
positive committee recommendation,
the candidacy is forwarded to an ap
pointment and promotion committee
in the school's dean's office.
That committee was recently
changed to be made up of department
chairs from the appropriate academic

cluster —social sciences, natural sci
ences or humanities —for each can-

didate, according to Sailer.
"What that means is that the com
mittee is made up of people closer to
the area of expertise of the person un
der consideration," he said. "That
provides a more sensible committee."
The dean of the school then de
cides whether to forward the applica
tion on to the Provost's office, where it
is reviewed by an advisory board and
the Provost.
Each committee considers every
case for tenure in that academic clus
ter, evaluating the assistant profes
sors primarily on two major areas: re
search and teaching.
"It's a combination of things,"
Plummer said. "Some are semi-quan
tifiable, such as the number of publi
cations or awards, talks that may
have been given at conferences in his
or her field... On the teaching side, we
look at student evaluations, the
amount of teaching done... along with
letters from external senior people in
the field of the candidate."
These letters are solicited from
12-15 external people in a leadership
position within the assistant profes
sor's field, according to Plummer. The
professors are also evaluated as com
pared to a peer group of four to six of
their peers.
"Ideally, [the peer group is com
posed of] recently tenured people in
peer institutions in similar fields,"
Plummer said. "We can make a spe
cific comparison of the impact and
contributions the Stanford candidate
has had with respect to their peers.
Where does the Stanford candidate
fit?"
"More people are working in in
terdisciplinary fields or multiple
fields and it becomes more difficult to
choose the right set of letter writers if
someone works in multiple areas or in
between areas," Plummer added. "It
can be hard to find peers in peer insti
tutions or finding referees who can
write about the whole spectrum...
You have to just recognize that some
one is working in multiple fields and
find people who can write for those
fields."

tenure, having been given feedback
when they are reappointed after four
years.
"You get an initial contract and
then are reviewed after three or four
years," Saperstein said of the depart
ment of sociology's process. 'At that
point, your department lets you know
if you're on track or not, if you need to
do more work. Then you're given an
other temporary contract and after
that you come up for tenure."
"After the mid-career review, you
typically take a sabbatical the next
year to give you more time to get
ready for tenure," she added.
"The way the process works in bi
ology is that there is a three-year - pe
riod where you are evaluated in a for
mal way by the department," Lowe
said. "They evaluate whether or not
you're getting grant funding and
whether you're getting published...
You're given a heads-up about any ob
vious problems you need to focus on
in terms of proceeding."
Tenure review
According to Sailer, the process
for earning tenure at Stanford is sim-

liar to that of peer institutions.
"The only thing that varies much
[between universities] is the use of ex
ternal committees at various points in
the process," he said. "Harvard has
this elaborate process with an ad-hoc
review by the president of the univer
sity with a committee that's made up
of half internal faculty, but from out
side the department, and half exter
nal faculty."
At Stanford, department chairs
appoint committees of departmental
faculty, who solicit external letters
and other assessments. If the depart
ment as a whole votes to support a
positive committee recommendation,
the candidacy is forwarded to an ap
pointment and promotion committee
in the school's dean's office.
That committee was recently
changed to be made up of department
chairs from the appropriate academic

cluster —social sciences, natural sci
ences or humanities —for each can-

didate, according to Sailer.
"What that means is that the com
mittee is made up of people closer to
the area of expertise of the person un
der consideration," he said. "That
provides a more sensible committee."
The dean of the school then de
cides whether to forward the applica
tion on to the Provost's office, where it
is reviewed by an advisory board and
the Provost.
Each committee considers every
case for tenure in that academic clus
ter, evaluating the assistant profes
sors primarily on two major areas: re
search and teaching.
"It's a combination of things,"
Plummer said. "Some are semi-quan
tifiable, such as the number of publi
cations or awards, talks that may
have been given at conferences in his
or her field... On the teaching side, we
look at student evaluations, the
amount of teaching done... along with
letters from external senior people in
the field of the candidate."
These letters are solicited from
12-15 external people in a leadership
position within the assistant profes
sor's field, according to Plummer. The
professors are also evaluated as com
pared to a peer group of four to six of
their peers.
"Ideally, [the peer group is com
posed of] recently tenured people in
peer institutions in similar fields,"
Plummer said. "We can make a spe
cific comparison of the impact and
contributions the Stanford candidate
has had with respect to their peers.
Where does the Stanford candidate
fit?"
"More people are working in in
terdisciplinary fields or multiple
fields and it becomes more difficult to
choose the right set of letter writers if
someone works in multiple areas or in
between areas," Plummer added. "It
can be hard to find peers in peer insti
tutions or finding referees who can
write about the whole spectrum...
You have to just recognize that some
one is working in multiple fields and
find people who can write for those
fields."
Course evaluations are included in
the tenure process, an input that
Sailer described as flawed.
"It's something less than a nu
anced response," he said. "Students
will pick out one number in the col
umn and mark it off down the page."
"We would like to assign as much
weight to teaching as to research
and we do take it seriously but if
we don't feel as if we've got good in
formation about [the professor's
teaching], it's hard to know what to
make of it," Sailer said.
That lack of information has a
broader impact on the way in which
the committees weight research and
teaching.
"You can't be a bad teacher and
get tenure," Sailer said. "You can't be
an average researcher and get tenure
...With teaching, we can probably
identify the 10 percent who are bril
liant and the 10 percent who are duds,
and the 80 percent in between [are]
very hard to rank in order."
If a professor is denied tenure,
they are given a year to find another
job, either elsewhere in academia or
in the corporate world.
"[The year] gives them the time to
do a careftd job search, time to figure
out how to deal with Ph.D. students
who haven't finished up their re
search, helping them find another ad
visor or getting them closer to finish
ing," Plummer said.
The future of tenure
As public funding for research and
for education diminishes, many insti
tutions across the country have cut
back on the number of tenured posi
tions they maintain. The Chronicle of
Higher Education reported in 2010
that the proportion of college instruc
tors who either had tenure or were on
the tenure track dropped from 57
percent in 1975 to just 31 percent in
2007.
Despite such national trends,
Sailer and Plummer said the Univer
sity, which currently has 1,995
tenured or tenure-line faculty, re
mained committed to maintaining the
system of tenure.
"There's a periodic question about
whether we keep the tenure system,
but I think it's here to stay for the
foreseeable future," Sailer said. "It's
hard to imagine, [because] the compe
tition for top faculty is intense, which
of our peer universities would do
away with the tenure system and con
tinue to try to recruit faculty."
In competing with its peer institu
tions for talented faculty, Sailer said
Stanford focuses its energies on at
tracting young academics with high
potential, with around 75 percent of
professorial appointments going to
assistant professors rather than
tenured faculty from other institu
tions.
"When we make decisions about
authorizing searches [for new facul
ty], we presume it's going to be an as
sistant professor search unless
there's some kind of programmatic
need for someone more senior," Sailer
said. "We see it as our responsibility
and goal to recruit young people who
are of the quality to make tenure and
then to nurture them in away that
they will succeed."

After years of graduate school
spent researching, reading, wilting
and publishing, the freshly-minted
Ph.D.s that Stanford hires as assis
tant professors each year might be
tempted to slow down. After all, for
many graduate students a faculty po
sition is the ultimate goal.
For new assistant professors, how
ever, another clock begins to tick im
mediately after they are hired: the
tenure clock. Though policies vary
slightly from university to university,
Stanford assistant professors gener
ally have seven years to show their
colleagues that they deserve the secu
rity of tenure.
Nearly 50 percent of assistant pro
fessors who are hired at Stanford will
go on to obtain tenure, according to
Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences Richard Sailer, who noted
that around 80 percent of those faculty
members who reached the point of be
ing considered for tenure are granted
it. Those seven years in between being
hired and being reviewed for tenure,
however, prompts scholar's to freneti
cally juggle the demands of teaching,
research, networking and life.
Tenure's significance
Sailer framed obtaining tenure as
a means of ensuring job security and
acquiring greater latitude for academ
ic investigation.
"[lt's about] having the sense of
freedom to pursue research directions
that are high-risk," he said. "It sur
prises trustees from the corporate
world that our faculty continue to
work and to be as productive as they
are given that they have jobs for life
after receiving tenure... The incen
tives at a place of this caliber are much
more peer recognition and just [the]
sheer joy of research and teaching."
"You are freed up to do research in
whatever you want," said Claire
Jarvis, assistant professor of English.
"You have a place in the department
even if the people in charge change."
For Chris Lowe, assistant profes
sor of biology, tenure allows a re
searcher doing basic scientific work
the chance to ride out periods of low
funding.
"You have the security to build a
risky research project that's high
yield but risky," Lowe said. "Not only
don't you have to worry about job se
curity, you might take more risk with
research than you would otherwise.
Tenure gives people a little more
space to take risks and create more
ambitious research goals."
For Aliya Saperstein, assistant
professor of sociology, tenure "is
there to protect innovative scholar
ship. Once you have tenure, you don't
have to worry about losing your job
[if] you're doing something cutting
edge or a little risky... In theory, you
can do better work because you're not
constantly seeking approval in ad
vance."
Working towards tenure
Assistant professors teach two to
four classes each year, along with
working on their own research in labs
and trying to get their work pub
lished in order to show their impact
and worth as professors. Expecta
tions for good academic work differ
from department to department.
"The main goal of tenure is to
make certain that the people given
tenure are the best in the world at
what they do," said Jim Plummer
M.5.'67 Ph.D.'7l, dean of the School
of Engineering.
To that end, according to Lowe,
the biology department focuses on
the quality and broad impact of its as
sistant professors' work.
"One way to evaluate if you have
an impact is the kind of publications
you produce," Lowe said. "Some uni
versities are really interested in how
many publications you've produced,
whereas other universities are more
interested in if you're published in
high-profile journals, which have
brought interest to not just your im
mediate field but a much broader
range of scientists."
In the English department, the
assistant professors are told from the
beginning what they are expected to
do in order to gain tenure.
"You must have one book in print
and be working towards publishing a
second [after seven years]," Jarvis
said. "It has to have an impact... Plus,
you have to have good course evalua
tions in the classes you teach and
show service to the University"
"In your day to day you focus on
classes, on grading, on students,"
Jarvis added "But you're still trying
to get a book published. It's still in the
back of your mind, always."
"[At Stanford], what matters is
the quality and the impact of your
work and if you are seen as someone
who is an expert in your subfield or
specialty... within your age cohort,"
Saperstein said. "Have you made
yourself stand out in your age co
hort?"
Typically, assistant professors are
aware of their progress and whether
they are on track for being granted
tenure, having been given feedback
when they are reappointed after four
years.
"You get an initial contract and
then are reviewed after three or four
years," Saperstein said of the depart
ment of sociology's process. 'At that
point, your department lets you know
if you're on track or not, if you need to
do more work. Then you're given an
other temporary contract and after
that you come up for tenure."

typically take a sabbatical the next
year to give you more time to get
ready for tenure," she added.

ology is that there is a three-year - pe
riod where you are evaluated in a for

said. "They evaluate whether or not

whether you're getting published...
