## Pie Ranch: A farm for the Farm 
### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From hosting monthly barn dances to con
tributing to Stanford's developing sustainable
agricultural efforts, Pie Ranch, a working farm
in Pescadero, Calif., has rapidly assumed an im
portant role in the Stanford community.
Located about an hour's drive away from
campus, the ranch recently partnered with the
Stanford Food Project in an effort to educate
students about more nutritious and environ
mentally friendly farming practices, as well as
co-hosting Stanford's first annual Barn Dance
at the Black Community Services Center (BC
SC) last month.
"It is so successful there and so popular
among Stanford students that the Stanford
Food Project and I decided to have a barn dance

here on campus," said Amanda Martinez 'l4, a
member of the Stanford Food Project.
According to Martinez, the event was mod
eled after a Pie Ranch monthly event, including
a potluck at the Lake Lagunita fire pit and a
barn dance featuring the same caller that calls
all of the Pie Ranch dances. Martinez also
brought in the County Line Kickers, the band
that usually performs at Pie Ranch.
"If it is as successful as we think it's going to
be, maybe we'll make it a quarterly event
once a quarter or twice a quarter, we'll have to
see how it goes," she said before the event.

nity and education through fresh,
local food.
"One of the reasons I'm so
grateful to be working at Pie
Ranch is that [we are] so invested
in working with these communi
ties where youth are gaining expo
sure to alternative food systems
and learning about what health
and nutrition mean for them per
sonally," said Alexandra Villegas,
youth development coordinator
for Pie Ranch. "[We] teach them
about cooking ... and about the
farm and where we source our
food."
Pie Ranch has operated as a
working farm since 2005, three
years after founders Nancy Vail,
Jered Lawson and Karen Heisler
purchased the pie-shaped plot of
land with the intention of creating
a model center of sustainable
farming and education.
"The co-founders of Pie Ranch
have always been invested in the
idea of creating a space where stu
dents and youth can learn about
the food system from seed to
plate," Villegas said. "That's al
ways been part of the vision of Pie
Ranch."

Work and dancing
Although some students like
Margaret Rawson 'l2, who co
founded a Stanford Pre-Orienta
tion Trip (SPOT) that educates in
coming freshman about sustainable
farming on the ranch, and Martinez
have worked closely with Ville
gas and Pie Ranch, others may be
drawn more by the ranch's month
ly barn dances.
"They're a lot of fun it's a re
laxed environment [and a] beautiful
space," Rawson, The Daily's chief
operating officer and business
manager, said. "I love the story of
Pie Ranch it's shaped like two
pieces of pie that meet in the mid
dle, and of course, they make pie."
Some students, such as Annie
Osborn 'l4, even serve as musi
cians during the festivities, assum
ing positions typically filled by old
er members of the Pescadero com
munity.
"The barn dances have been go
ing on for as long as Pie Ranch has
been operating, and they tie into
Pie Ranch's vision because Pie
Ranch is all about building commu
nity," Villegas said.
According to Villegas, the barn
dance begins with a "work day" at
2 p.m., followed by a 5 p.m. potluck
and then the evening line dances.
"All three of those events are
about getting to know your neigh

bors, talking to someone that
you've never talked to before and
having a dialogue about what food
means to you and connecting over
food," Villegas said. "Food is a lan
guage that we all speak with and
communicate with each other
around."
Having attended her first barn
dance during her freshman year,
Martinez suggested that the event
has only increased in popularity on

the Farm since.
"Every time I go, the barn is
just packed and I see a ton of famil
iar Stanford faces, which is awe
some," she said.
In addition to barn dances, the
ranch also offers farm tours for
those curious about the inner work
ings of sustainable agriculture.
"They're a great opportunity
for people to learn all about the his
tory of the farm," Martinez said.

"[The owners are] very transpar
ent. They really like to talk to peo
ple all about their financial journey
with Pie Ranch how they've
been able to fund it because they
want people to know that it is pos
sible and they want people to feel
empowered to start their own sus
tainable farms."
Martinez noted that the range
of crop and livestock offerings has
gradually expanded to include
everything needed wheat for
flour, chickens to produce eggs and
berries to provide fillings â€”to
bake a pie.
"[lt's] a really great experience
... to see every step in the process,
growing everything and then mak
ing it into a pie," she said.
Martinez plans to intern at the
ranch this summer while conduct
ing research on carbon intake in
the farm's soil for her earth sys
tems honors thesis.
"Not only are they a sustainable
farm, but they also incorporate sev
eral different types of educational
programs, like their internship and
apprenticeship program[s], to train
future farmers," Martinez said.
"They're just creating this awe
some culture around food, and
they're changing the local food sys
tem for the better."
