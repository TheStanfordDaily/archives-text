## Pie Ranch: A farm for the Farm 
### KATIE KRAMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From hosting monthly barn dances to con
tributing to Stanford's developing sustainable
agricultural efforts, Pie Ranch, a working farm
in Pescadero, Calif., has rapidly assumed an im
portant role in the Stanford community.
Located about an hour's drive away from
campus, the ranch recently partnered with the
Stanford Food Project in an effort to educate
students about more nutritious and environ
mentally friendly farming practices, as well as
co-hosting Stanford's first annual Barn Dance
at the Black Community Services Center (BC
SC) last month.
"It is so successful there and so popular
among Stanford students that the Stanford
Food Project and I decided to have a barn dance

here on campus," said Amanda Martinez 'l4, a
member of the Stanford Food Project.
According to Martinez, the event was mod
eled after a Pie Ranch monthly event, including
a potluck at the Lake Lagunita fire pit and a
barn dance featuring the same caller that calls
all of the Pie Ranch dances. Martinez also
brought in the County Line Kickers, the band
that usually performs at Pie Ranch.
"If it is as successful as we think it's going to
be, maybe we'll make it a quarterly event
once a quarter or twice a quarter, we'll have to
see how it goes," she said before the event.
