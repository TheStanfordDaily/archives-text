## CS' rise in popularity poses pressing questions

Sitting in a brimming Hewlett
200 this past fall quarter, Janet
An 'l6 looked around the second
largest classroom on campus
minutes before Associate Profes
sor of Computer Science Mehran
Sahami '92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99 be
gan his CSIO6A lecture.
Every seat in the room was
occupied, and a line of students
stood along the walls while others
sat in the aisles. Just as Sahami
was about to speak, a fire mar
shal entered the classroom and

ordered people who were not
seated to leave.

ting all the way down the stairs
and corridors and basically

man body," An said. "But it felt
really cool to be a part of some
thing so big. Knowing that [com
puter science] is becoming such
an important part of campus and
a field with so many possibilities,
it was exciting to get involved in
the community early."
While An said that the fire

hazard incident was joked about
for weeks afterward, it serves as
a somewhat ominous illustration
of the problems associated with a
significant trend that has irrevo
cably shaped Stanford's percep
tion the rise of the Computer
Science Department.
A department under pressure
Enrollment in CSIO6A: Pro
gramming Methodology, the de
partment's most popular class,
has steadily increased over the
past four years, reaching a
record 1,817 students in the 2012-

2013 academic year.
The number of students de
claring a computer science major
also rose substantially over that
time period, with a projected 273

this academic year topping last
year's record-breaking figure of
246. Even graduate students
have become involved, employing
computer science skills for tasks
as diverse as writing scripts to
analyzing DNA base-pair dislo
cations or building models to rep
