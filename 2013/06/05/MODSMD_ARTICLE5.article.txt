## CS' rise in popularity poses pressing questions 
### STEPHANY YONG 
Sitting in a brimming Hewlett
200 this past fall quarter, Janet
An 'l6 looked around the second
largest classroom on campus
minutes before Associate Profes
sor of Computer Science Mehran
Sahami '92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99 be
gan his CSIO6A lecture.
Every seat in the room was
occupied, and a line of students
stood along the walls while others
sat in the aisles. Just as Sahami
was about to speak, a fire mar
shal entered the classroom and

ordered people who were not
seated to leave.
"I definitely felt a little over
whelmed since you see people sit
ting all the way down the stairs
and corridors and basically
everywhere you could fit a hu
man body," An said. "But it felt
really cool to be a part of some
thing so big. Knowing that [com
puter science] is becoming such
an important part of campus and
a field with so many possibilities,
it was exciting to get involved in
the community early."
While An said that the fire

hazard incident was joked about
for weeks afterward, it serves as
a somewhat ominous illustration
of the problems associated with a
significant trend that has irrevo
cably shaped Stanford's percep
tion the rise of the Computer
Science Department.
A department under pressure
Enrollment in CSIO6A: Pro
gramming Methodology, the de
partment's most popular class,
has steadily increased over the
past four years, reaching a
record 1,817 students in the 2012-

2013 academic year.
The number of students de
claring a computer science major
also rose substantially over that
time period, with a projected 273
computer science declarations
this academic year topping last
year's record-breaking figure of
246. Even graduate students
have become involved, employing
computer science skills for tasks
as diverse as writing scripts to
analyzing DNA base-pair dislo
cations or building models to rep
resent market simulations.
While more students have bene
fited from an exposure to program
ming, Department of Computer
Science Chair Jennifer Widom
said the department has been
hard-pressed to match the growth
in student interest with faculty
members and administrative re
sources.
"The department is actually
under a serious amount of stress.
We have faculty teaching classes
with over 600 students quarter af
ter quarter," Widom said. "You
might see Keith [Schwarz 'lO M.S.
'll] or Mehran up there smiling,
but behind the scenes they're
working really hard. We are al
most in crisis mode trying to deal
with all these students."
Schwarz, a lecturer who was
hired in 2011, taught a total of 830
students during winter quarter in
CSIO6A and CSIO3, the largest
number of students any individual
professor taught on campus.
Schwarz described the admin
istrative issues involved in teach
ing so many students as taxing. He
estimated that five percent of stu
dents had some type of adminis
trative problem such as a schedul
ing problem or illness, which re
sulted in approximately 41 stu
dents needing special accommoda
tions.
"I will try to meet with people,
and I want to help out, but it gets
to a point where I just can't,"
Schwarz said. "And it's pretty ter
rible to have to tell someone, 'I
know you're struggling and I real
ly want to help out, but I just
can't.' It's not personal. I just hit

the physical limit of what I'm ca
pable of doing, and there's no more
time in my day."
Fluctuations in popularity
While some computer science
classes have experienced enroll
ment spikes, the trend is not uni
versal. Other introductory classes,
such as CS101: Introduction to
Computing Principles and CSIOS:
Introduction to Computers, have
seen a substantial decline in enroll
ment since 2008.
According to Sahami, diverging
enrollments in introductory classes
can be attributed to interest in ex
ploring higher-level computing.
While CSIO6A leads to CS106B:
Programming Abstractions, CSIOI
and CSIOS are considered terminal
classes in HTML and CSS.
Interest in the department itself
has also has fluctuated over the
years. Computer science reached a
then-record 171 major declarations
during the dot-com bubble of the
late '9os, only to plummet after the
bubble burst, seeing just 71 decla
rations in 2006.
The most recent surge in the de
partment's popularity occurred af
ter Sahami and a faculty curricu
lum committee redesigned the ma
jor in 2009. According to Sahami,
auricular adjustments were made
to underscore the growing synergy
between computer science and oth
er fields.
Major changes included a refo
cusing of the core to six classes
three theoretical and three with an
emphasis on programming and sys
tems and the creation of a track
system that gives students the abil
ity to specialize in a certain area.
The department is still undergo
ing changes, as next year's intro
ductory classes will be likely be
split into two lectures per class. In
stead of having one 600-person
CSIO6A class, both a morning and

an afternoon section will be of
fered.
Schwarz said that the depart
ment also hopes to hire additional
staff in order to teach more stu
dents.
"If we use last quarter as a data
point, then yes, things are looking a
bit strained here," Schwarz said.
"However, I don't think we are hit
ting a breaking point where it's
like, things will actually start to dis
integrate. It's not like if you add
one more person into a class,
everything breaks."
Though Schwarz said that the
department is not yet facing a cri
sis, he noted that a continued
growth at current levels would be
come unsustainable over a long pe
riod of time.
"The classes are still opera
tional and going really well. If
things continue to grow at this rate,
then things are going to have to
change," he said. "I don't anticipate
next year being something where
all hell breaks loose. We're looking
at this year and thinking, 'Okay,
we're going to double up on these
classes and it's going to be okay.'"
Looking toward the future
Earlier this year, Professor of
Computer Science Eric Roberts,
the department's associate direc
tor, proposed a plan to implement a
formalized double major program
with less stringent computer sci
ence requirements in which stu
dents obtain degrees in computer
science and another subject.
Although it will take more than
a year for the proposal to take full
form, faculty members described
the proposal as an opportunity to
make the largest department on
campus more accessible and flexi
ble to students.
"Maybe it's what we owe the

students," Widom said. "It's a

great major if students can major
in CS and something else, and
shouldn't Stanford be offering its
best degrees to its students that
we can? We should, so I'm hoping
that will come through."
However, Widom noted that ad
ditional provisions to account for
continued interest in computer sci
ence will force faculty and adminis
trators to consider how the rise of
the computer science department
will impact Stanford.
"There's a major question of,
what does Stanford want to be?
Does Stanford want to be a school
comprised 40 percent of engineers
and half of those in computer sci
ence?" Widom said. "That's fine if
that's what Stanford wants to be,
but Stanford has always been such
a broad school. If half the students
are majoring in engineering or
some large fraction, I just think it
will change the character of the
University a little bit, and I'm not
sure if that's a good thing."
While Widom said that she be
lieves the current balance of ma
jors is not unhealthy, Professor of
History Jack Rakove was more
critical of how many students are
majoring in computer science.

"If you're a humanist, you real
ly worry that we're churning out a
large number of people who don't
really know how to read a book and
are historically ignorant of the re
lationship between present and
past," Rakove said.
Rakove, who has taught hu
manities and social sciences at
Stanford for 33 years, said that he
supports technological innovation
and doesn't believe Stanford's
strong engineering presence is
necessarily negative. He ex
pressed concern, however, that an
emphasis on engineering and com
puter science detracts from the
traditional liberal undergraduate

experience.
"The fact remains that some
students who come in here and
come out spend an awful lot of time
programming and doing problem
sets and are really in some funda
mental sense ignorant about some
things they probably ought to
know," he said.
However, Sahami argued that
as technology increasingly be
comes a significant presence in
everyday life, computer science
has developed into an integral part
of a liberal education.
"It's somewhat of a misnomer to
say that an education in computing
is not a liberal education," Sahami
said. "If you think about it, a liberal
education is being able to be a well
educated person generally. I think
the fact that everyone needs to
know something about computing
these days makes them a well
rounded person. If you didn't know

anything about computing, that'd be
a little bit odd in the 21st century."
Schwarz agreed that computing
skills have become increasingly im
portant and emphasized his hope
that "cross talk" between disci
plines at Stanford will allow for
new computing discoveries that in
corporate the wide array of knowl
edge and expertise on campus.
"It would be fantastic for Stan
ford to get on the map where there
were headlines every week that
Stanford scientists do 'blank' with
computers," he said. "The story will
not be an extremely complex tech
nological solution, but instead an
extremely obvious technological so
lution that nobody thought to try
before because nobody actually
knew it would work [or] knew how
to do it and now all of a sudden they
do."
