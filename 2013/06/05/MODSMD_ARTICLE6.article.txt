## MOOCs face challenge in humanities Professors criticize potential loss of ambiguity, personal interaction 
### CARA REICHARD DESK EDITOR 
Even as massive open online courses
(MOOCs) continue to assume an increasingly
prominent role in education, regularly enrolling
thousands of students from around the world in
classes taught by professors from dozens of uni
versities, their rapid growth has sparked a back
lash focused on the potential loss of diversity and
interaction in education.
In one such instance, the San Jose State Uni
versity Department of Philosophy wrote an open
letter in April to Harvard professor Michael
Sandel, explaining their refusal to offer his edX
course, Justice, as a part of their curriculum.
"The thought of the exact same social justice
course being taught in various philosophy de
partments across the country is downright scary
something out of a dystopian novel," the letter
read. "Departments across the country possess
unique specialization and character, and should
stay that way... Diversity in schools of thought
and plurality of points of view are at the heart of
liberal education."
That same month, the faculty of Amherst
College voted against joining edX, a nonprofit
founded by Harvard and MIT that has since
merged with Stanford's Class2Go platform, say
ing that doing so would run counter to its mission
to be a "purposefully small residential communi
ty"
Conflict in the humanities
The debate over MOOCs has been particular
ly contentious within the humanities, where
classes are typically taught in smaller groups or
seminar's.
Humanities courses are among the least rep
resented on both Coursera, a Stanford-devel
oped online learning platform, and edX. While
seeking to rectify that underrepresentation, ad
ministrators have also grappled with whether
subjects like philosophyâ€”which are largely
open to interpretation, including in the grading
process, and dependent on methods such as the
Socratic dialogues are suitable to become
MOOCs.
Richard Sailer; dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences, suggested that there are cer
tain qualities of the humanities that are better
suited to an intimate classroom setting than to a
massive online format.
"The humanities have to deal with ambiguity
[and] with multiple answers," Sailer said. "The
humanities, I think, benefit hugely from the ex
change of different points of view [and] different
arguments."
In an effort to raise the visibility of the hu
manities among Stanford's online course offer
ings, Sailer and Senior Associate Dean for the
Humanities and Arts Debra Satz approached
five top faculty members last year' with the intent
of encouraging experimentation in an online for
mat.
Four of the five including Professor of
English Eavan Boland and Professor of Classics
lan Morris expressed enthusiasm for the
