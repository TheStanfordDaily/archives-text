## MOOCs face challenge in humanities Professors criticize potential loss of ambiguity, personal interaction 
### CARA REICHARD DESK EDITOR 
Even as massive open online courses
(MOOCs) continue to assume an increasingly
prominent role in education, regularly enrolling
thousands of students from around the world in
classes taught by professors from dozens of uni
versities, their rapid growth has sparked a back
lash focused on the potential loss of diversity and
interaction in education.
In one such instance, the San Jose State Uni
versity Department of Philosophy wrote an open
letter in April to Harvard professor Michael
Sandel, explaining their refusal to offer his edX
course, Justice, as a part of their curriculum.
"The thought of the exact same social justice
course being taught in various philosophy de
partments across the country is downright scary
something out of a dystopian novel," the letter
read. "Departments across the country possess
unique specialization and character, and should
stay that way... Diversity in schools of thought
and plurality of points of view are at the heart of
liberal education."
That same month, the faculty of Amherst
College voted against joining edX, a nonprofit
founded by Harvard and MIT that has since
merged with Stanford's Class2Go platform, say
ing that doing so would run counter to its mission
to be a "purposefully small residential communi
ty"
Conflict in the humanities
The debate over MOOCs has been particular
ly contentious within the humanities, where
classes are typically taught in smaller groups or
seminar's.
Humanities courses are among the least rep
resented on both Coursera, a Stanford-devel
oped online learning platform, and edX. While
seeking to rectify that underrepresentation, ad
ministrators have also grappled with whether
subjects like philosophy—which are largely
open to interpretation, including in the grading
process, and dependent on methods such as the
Socratic dialogues are suitable to become
MOOCs.
Richard Sailer; dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences, suggested that there are cer
tain qualities of the humanities that are better
suited to an intimate classroom setting than to a
massive online format.
"The humanities have to deal with ambiguity
[and] with multiple answers," Sailer said. "The
humanities, I think, benefit hugely from the ex
change of different points of view [and] different
arguments."
In an effort to raise the visibility of the hu
manities among Stanford's online course offer
ings, Sailer and Senior Associate Dean for the
Humanities and Arts Debra Satz approached
five top faculty members last year' with the intent
of encouraging experimentation in an online for
mat.
Four of the five including Professor of
English Eavan Boland and Professor of Classics
lan Morris expressed enthusiasm for the
idea. Some have committed to
developing MOOCs over the
next few years, while others
have expressed interest in put
ting materials or lectures online
but not necessarily going so far
as to use a platform such as
Coursera.
"I think there will be experi
ments," Satz said. "What will ful
ly come of this for the humani
ties, I think we don't fully know."
Sailer plans to take a MOOC
himself this summer Social
Psychology—to see what the
experience is really like.
"I guess my hunch is that the
kinds of platforms that are avail
able now can provide a forum for
exchange among students with
different ideas," Sailer said.
"But I doubt that that will come
anywhere near the quality that
we have in our introductory
seminars."
Losing the personal touch
The one professor who was
not interested in the proposition,
Professor of Art History Alexan
der Nemerov, reiterated his op
position to offering his courses
online.
"I think that part of the beau
ty of [giving a lecture] is how
ephemeral it is," he said. "I feel
that the lecture is there for the
people who are in the class. That
is to say that it's based on a face
to-face interaction between peo
ple all in one room. I don't know
how I feel about taking out the
personal quality of it."
Nemerov admitted that he
was not certain whether there
would always be a firm place for
the brick-and-mortar classroom
because "the momentum for
this kind of thing seems so re
lentless." He maintained, how
ever, that he didn't anticipate his
own feelings changing.
"I know that I'll continue to
believe in the importance of pub
lic lectures, public speaking, the
classroom experience," he said.
"It would be a sad day for me if it
were all sort of farmed out and
just made into online, on-de
mand education. It would seem
that something very human
would have been lost in that."
Gavin Jones, chair of the
English Department, said he is
excited about the ways in which
online education can supple
ment the work that faculty
members are already doing.
The English Department re
cently hired a new academic
technology specialist whose
role, according to Jones, is to
help faculty explore online edu
cation.
"I think it's very easy for
people to see the humanities as
either against [online education]
or skeptical of it, and I think you
need some healthy skepticism"
Jones said. "I don't think all of it
is good. But it's a question of
recognizing what is good about
it and using that to improve the

educational resources and the
pedagogical mission that al
ready exist."
Daphne Roller Ph.D. '94 and
Andrew Ng, professors of com
puter science and Coursera's
co-founders, said that courses in
the humanities and social sci
ences in which the material is
more open to interpretation
have proven more complicated
to translate into an online for
mat, especially when it came to
the assessment and grading of
the students.
"I think if you use computer
based grading, clearly you need
to restrict the dimensions to
things that more or less have a
right answer or several right
answers," Roller said.
Nevertheless, she added
that some of the most popular
classes on Coursera have been
humanities courses, including a
philosophy class from Duke
University, entitled Think
Again: How to Reason and Ar
gue, which is the single most
popular course offered by the
company
"I think that humanities
classes can be taught incredibly
effectively online," Roller said.
Both Ng and Roller said that
new technology has made it pro
gressively easier to simulate the
classroom experience online.
One new development is the in
troduction of peer grading, in
which each assignment is grad
ed by five different students us
ing a rubric supplied by the pro
fessor.
According to Ng, research
has shown that the grades stu
dents give each other are gener
ally in line with the grades a
professor would give. The quali
tative feedback, however, is the
more variable factor.
"Realistically, I have to ad
mit that that feedback is not as
insightful as is [the feedback of]
a highly skilled professor," Ng
said. "On the flip side, it's also
useful to get five different per
spectives."
Satz said that she is open to
the idea of peer grading but re
mains cautious of its limits.
"I think that writing is one of
the most important skills that
people learn in the humanities,
and, in my experience, it tends to
happen by people going line by
line over essays and giving de
tailed feedback," she said. 'And
that's unlikely to happen in a
course that has 150,000 stu
dents."
She added that while peer
grading may be a solution to
this problem, it is necessarily an
imperfect one.
"I think there's some benefit
to peer grading, but it's different
than having your work read by
an expert," she said, noting that
in her own classes she brings
years of experience to the grad
ing process.
Coursera also offers stu
dents the opportunity to partici
pate in online discussion forums,
which Ng said are an attempt to
mimic as closely as possible the
experience of the intimate class
room discussion fundamental to

many humanities courses. Ng
described the forums as very
successful so far but also limited.
"I think there are certain
seminar classes where an in
structor walks around a room,
very discussion-based courses
I think we're still figuring out
the technology of how to offer
that," Ng said. 'An online dis
cussion forum is different. It is
definitely different... I think we
still have a long way to go,
frankly, to simulate more of the
average classroom discussion."
Retaining valuable aspects
Satz said that she sees im
mense value in online education
platforms such as Coursera, es
pecially in their potential to low
er the cost of higher education.
"To the extent that some on
line education helps bring the
cost curve down and make edu
cation more affordable, that's a
good thing," she said. 'And if you
can do it without sacrificing
quality, or, where you need it, de
bate and diversity, that's also a
good thing."
Satz added that she recog
nized the concerns raised by the
San Jose State philosophy facul
ty, citing the risk of valuable
parts of the learning experience
being lost in online dissemina
tion.
"One of the most important
things is to not just deliver infor
mation [to students] but to teach
them how to reason," Satz said.
'And if we don't teach our stu
dents how to make knowledge,
not just how to consume knowl
edge, then we're not doing what
higher education is supposed to
do."
Sailer also emphasized the
importance of offering students
a range of perspectives.
"Diversity of ideas, like ge
netic diversity, I think is a good
thing in certain subjects," Sailer
said. "In Beginning Algebra,
that's probably not what you
want, but in most humanities
subjects, I think that is what you
want, whether it's literary inter
pretation or philosophy or his
torical interpretation."
"I think we need to be cau
tious about overstating what
this form of knowledge transfer
can deliver," Satz added.

said he has found rewarding and
worth repeating. Nevertheless,
he claimed that there will always
be parts of the undergraduate
experience that cannot be re
placed by online learning.

to change higher education, and
great universities are going have
to adapt," he said. "[But] we
want to be sure we don't lose
what's precious and irreplace

Even as massive open online courses
(MOOCs) continue to assume an increasingly
prominent role in education, regularly enrolling
thousands of students from around the world in
classes taught by professors from dozens of uni
versities, their rapid growth has sparked a back
lash focused on the potential loss of diversity and
interaction in education.
In one such instance, the San Jose State Uni
versity Department of Philosophy wrote an open
letter in April to Harvard professor Michael
Sandel, explaining their refusal to offer his edX
course, Justice, as a part of their curriculum.
"The thought of the exact same social justice
course being taught in various philosophy de
partments across the country is downright scary
something out of a dystopian novel," the letter
read. "Departments across the country possess
unique specialization and character, and should
stay that way... Diversity in schools of thought
and plurality of points of view are at the heart of
liberal education."
That same month, the faculty of Amherst
College voted against joining edX, a nonprofit
founded by Harvard and MIT that has since
merged with Stanford's Class2Go platform, say
ing that doing so would run counter to its mission
to be a "purposefully small residential communi
ty"
Conflict in the humanities
The debate over MOOCs has been particular
ly contentious within the humanities, where
classes are typically taught in smaller groups or
seminar's.
Humanities courses are among the least rep
resented on both Coursera, a Stanford-devel
oped online learning platform, and edX. While
seeking to rectify that underrepresentation, ad
ministrators have also grappled with whether
subjects like philosophy—which are largely
open to interpretation, including in the grading
process, and dependent on methods such as the
Socratic dialogues are suitable to become
MOOCs.
Richard Sailer; dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences, suggested that there are cer
tain qualities of the humanities that are better
suited to an intimate classroom setting than to a
massive online format.
"The humanities have to deal with ambiguity
[and] with multiple answers," Sailer said. "The
humanities, I think, benefit hugely from the ex
change of different points of view [and] different
arguments."
In an effort to raise the visibility of the hu
manities among Stanford's online course offer
ings, Sailer and Senior Associate Dean for the
Humanities and Arts Debra Satz approached
five top faculty members last year' with the intent
of encouraging experimentation in an online for
mat.
Four of the five including Professor of
English Eavan Boland and Professor of Classics
lan Morris expressed enthusiasm for the
idea. Some have committed to
developing MOOCs over the
next few years, while others
have expressed interest in put
ting materials or lectures online
but not necessarily going so far
as to use a platform such as
Coursera.
"I think there will be experi
ments," Satz said. "What will ful
ly come of this for the humani
ties, I think we don't fully know."
Sailer plans to take a MOOC
himself this summer Social
Psychology—to see what the
experience is really like.
"I guess my hunch is that the
kinds of platforms that are avail
able now can provide a forum for
exchange among students with
different ideas," Sailer said.
"But I doubt that that will come
anywhere near the quality that
we have in our introductory
seminars."
Losing the personal touch
The one professor who was
not interested in the proposition,
Professor of Art History Alexan
der Nemerov, reiterated his op
position to offering his courses
online.
"I think that part of the beau
ty of [giving a lecture] is how
ephemeral it is," he said. "I feel
that the lecture is there for the
people who are in the class. That
is to say that it's based on a face
to-face interaction between peo
ple all in one room. I don't know
how I feel about taking out the
personal quality of it."
Nemerov admitted that he
was not certain whether there
would always be a firm place for
the brick-and-mortar classroom
because "the momentum for
this kind of thing seems so re
lentless." He maintained, how
ever, that he didn't anticipate his
own feelings changing.
"I know that I'll continue to
believe in the importance of pub
lic lectures, public speaking, the
classroom experience," he said.
"It would be a sad day for me if it
were all sort of farmed out and
just made into online, on-de
mand education. It would seem
that something very human
would have been lost in that."
Gavin Jones, chair of the
English Department, said he is
excited about the ways in which
online education can supple
ment the work that faculty
members are already doing.
The English Department re
cently hired a new academic
technology specialist whose
role, according to Jones, is to
help faculty explore online edu
cation.
"I think it's very easy for
people to see the humanities as
either against [online education]
or skeptical of it, and I think you
need some healthy skepticism"
Jones said. "I don't think all of it
is good. But it's a question of
recognizing what is good about
it and using that to improve the

educational resources and the
pedagogical mission that al
ready exist."
Daphne Roller Ph.D. '94 and
Andrew Ng, professors of com
puter science and Coursera's
co-founders, said that courses in
the humanities and social sci
ences in which the material is
more open to interpretation
have proven more complicated
to translate into an online for
mat, especially when it came to
the assessment and grading of
the students.
"I think if you use computer
based grading, clearly you need
to restrict the dimensions to
things that more or less have a
right answer or several right
answers," Roller said.
Nevertheless, she added
that some of the most popular
classes on Coursera have been
humanities courses, including a
philosophy class from Duke
University, entitled Think
Again: How to Reason and Ar
gue, which is the single most
popular course offered by the
company
"I think that humanities
classes can be taught incredibly
effectively online," Roller said.
Both Ng and Roller said that
new technology has made it pro
gressively easier to simulate the
classroom experience online.
One new development is the in
troduction of peer grading, in
which each assignment is grad
ed by five different students us
ing a rubric supplied by the pro
fessor.
According to Ng, research
has shown that the grades stu
dents give each other are gener
ally in line with the grades a
professor would give. The quali
tative feedback, however, is the
more variable factor.
"Realistically, I have to ad
mit that that feedback is not as
insightful as is [the feedback of]
a highly skilled professor," Ng
said. "On the flip side, it's also
useful to get five different per
spectives."
Satz said that she is open to
the idea of peer grading but re
mains cautious of its limits.
"I think that writing is one of
the most important skills that
people learn in the humanities,
and, in my experience, it tends to
happen by people going line by
line over essays and giving de
tailed feedback," she said. 'And
that's unlikely to happen in a
course that has 150,000 stu
dents."
She added that while peer
grading may be a solution to
this problem, it is necessarily an
imperfect one.
"I think there's some benefit
to peer grading, but it's different
than having your work read by
an expert," she said, noting that
in her own classes she brings
years of experience to the grad
ing process.
Coursera also offers stu
dents the opportunity to partici
pate in online discussion forums,
which Ng said are an attempt to
mimic as closely as possible the
experience of the intimate class
room discussion fundamental to

many humanities courses. Ng
described the forums as very
successful so far but also limited.
"I think there are certain
seminar classes where an in
structor walks around a room,
very discussion-based courses
I think we're still figuring out
the technology of how to offer
that," Ng said. 'An online dis
cussion forum is different. It is
definitely different... I think we
still have a long way to go,
frankly, to simulate more of the
average classroom discussion."
Retaining valuable aspects
Satz said that she sees im
mense value in online education
platforms such as Coursera, es
pecially in their potential to low
er the cost of higher education.
"To the extent that some on
line education helps bring the
cost curve down and make edu
cation more affordable, that's a
good thing," she said. 'And if you
can do it without sacrificing
quality, or, where you need it, de
bate and diversity, that's also a
good thing."
Satz added that she recog
nized the concerns raised by the
San Jose State philosophy facul
ty, citing the risk of valuable
parts of the learning experience
being lost in online dissemina
tion.
"One of the most important
things is to not just deliver infor
mation [to students] but to teach
them how to reason," Satz said.
'And if we don't teach our stu
dents how to make knowledge,
not just how to consume knowl
edge, then we're not doing what
higher education is supposed to
do."
Sailer also emphasized the
importance of offering students
a range of perspectives.
"Diversity of ideas, like ge
netic diversity, I think is a good
thing in certain subjects," Sailer
said. "In Beginning Algebra,
that's probably not what you
want, but in most humanities
subjects, I think that is what you
want, whether it's literary inter
pretation or philosophy or his
torical interpretation."
"I think we need to be cau
tious about overstating what
this form of knowledge transfer
can deliver," Satz added.

Even as massive open online courses
(MOOCs) continue to assume an increasingly
prominent role in education, regularly enrolling
thousands of students from around the world in
classes taught by professors from dozens of uni
versities, their rapid growth has sparked a back
lash focused on the potential loss of diversity and
interaction in education.
In one such instance, the San Jose State Uni
versity Department of Philosophy wrote an open
letter in April to Harvard professor Michael
Sandel, explaining their refusal to offer his edX
course, Justice, as a part of their curriculum.
"The thought of the exact same social justice
course being taught in various philosophy de
partments across the country is downright scary
something out of a dystopian novel," the letter
read. "Departments across the country possess
unique specialization and character, and should
stay that way... Diversity in schools of thought
and plurality of points of view are at the heart of
liberal education."
That same month, the faculty of Amherst
College voted against joining edX, a nonprofit
founded by Harvard and MIT that has since
merged with Stanford's Class2Go platform, say
ing that doing so would run counter to its mission
to be a "purposefully small residential communi
ty"
Conflict in the humanities
The debate over MOOCs has been particular
ly contentious within the humanities, where
classes are typically taught in smaller groups or
seminar's.
Humanities courses are among the least rep
resented on both Coursera, a Stanford-devel
oped online learning platform, and edX. While
seeking to rectify that underrepresentation, ad
ministrators have also grappled with whether
subjects like philosophy—which are largely
open to interpretation, including in the grading
process, and dependent on methods such as the
Socratic dialogues are suitable to become
MOOCs.
Richard Sailer; dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences, suggested that there are cer
tain qualities of the humanities that are better
suited to an intimate classroom setting than to a
massive online format.
"The humanities have to deal with ambiguity
[and] with multiple answers," Sailer said. "The
humanities, I think, benefit hugely from the ex
change of different points of view [and] different
arguments."
In an effort to raise the visibility of the hu
manities among Stanford's online course offer
ings, Sailer and Senior Associate Dean for the
Humanities and Arts Debra Satz approached
five top faculty members last year' with the intent
of encouraging experimentation in an online for
mat.
Four of the five including Professor of
English Eavan Boland and Professor of Classics
lan Morris expressed enthusiasm for the
idea. Some have committed to
developing MOOCs over the
next few years, while others
have expressed interest in put
ting materials or lectures online
but not necessarily going so far
as to use a platform such as
Coursera.
"I think there will be experi
ments," Satz said. "What will ful
ly come of this for the humani
ties, I think we don't fully know."
Sailer plans to take a MOOC
himself this summer Social
Psychology—to see what the
experience is really like.
"I guess my hunch is that the
kinds of platforms that are avail
able now can provide a forum for
exchange among students with
different ideas," Sailer said.
"But I doubt that that will come
anywhere near the quality that
we have in our introductory
seminars."
Losing the personal touch
The one professor who was
not interested in the proposition,
Professor of Art History Alexan
der Nemerov, reiterated his op
position to offering his courses
online.
"I think that part of the beau
ty of [giving a lecture] is how
ephemeral it is," he said. "I feel
that the lecture is there for the
people who are in the class. That
is to say that it's based on a face
to-face interaction between peo
ple all in one room. I don't know
how I feel about taking out the
personal quality of it."
Nemerov admitted that he
was not certain whether there
would always be a firm place for
the brick-and-mortar classroom
because "the momentum for
this kind of thing seems so re
lentless." He maintained, how
ever, that he didn't anticipate his
own feelings changing.
"I know that I'll continue to
believe in the importance of pub
lic lectures, public speaking, the
classroom experience," he said.
"It would be a sad day for me if it
were all sort of farmed out and
just made into online, on-de
mand education. It would seem
that something very human
would have been lost in that."
Gavin Jones, chair of the
English Department, said he is
excited about the ways in which
online education can supple
ment the work that faculty
members are already doing.
The English Department re
cently hired a new academic
technology specialist whose
role, according to Jones, is to
help faculty explore online edu
cation.
"I think it's very easy for
people to see the humanities as
either against [online education]
or skeptical of it, and I think you
need some healthy skepticism"
Jones said. "I don't think all of it
is good. But it's a question of
recognizing what is good about
it and using that to improve the

educational resources and the
pedagogical mission that al
ready exist."
Daphne Roller Ph.D. '94 and
Andrew Ng, professors of com
puter science and Coursera's
co-founders, said that courses in
the humanities and social sci
ences in which the material is
more open to interpretation
have proven more complicated
to translate into an online for
mat, especially when it came to
the assessment and grading of
the students.
"I think if you use computer
based grading, clearly you need
to restrict the dimensions to
things that more or less have a
right answer or several right
answers," Roller said.
Nevertheless, she added
that some of the most popular
classes on Coursera have been
humanities courses, including a
philosophy class from Duke
University, entitled Think
Again: How to Reason and Ar
gue, which is the single most
popular course offered by the
company
"I think that humanities
classes can be taught incredibly
effectively online," Roller said.
Both Ng and Roller said that
new technology has made it pro
gressively easier to simulate the
classroom experience online.
One new development is the in
troduction of peer grading, in
which each assignment is grad
ed by five different students us
ing a rubric supplied by the pro
fessor.
According to Ng, research
has shown that the grades stu
dents give each other are gener
ally in line with the grades a
professor would give. The quali
tative feedback, however, is the
more variable factor.
"Realistically, I have to ad
mit that that feedback is not as
insightful as is [the feedback of]
a highly skilled professor," Ng
said. "On the flip side, it's also
useful to get five different per
spectives."
Satz said that she is open to
the idea of peer grading but re
mains cautious of its limits.
"I think that writing is one of
the most important skills that
people learn in the humanities,
and, in my experience, it tends to
happen by people going line by
line over essays and giving de
tailed feedback," she said. 'And
that's unlikely to happen in a
course that has 150,000 stu
dents."
She added that while peer
grading may be a solution to
this problem, it is necessarily an
imperfect one.
"I think there's some benefit
to peer grading, but it's different
than having your work read by
an expert," she said, noting that
in her own classes she brings
years of experience to the grad
ing process.
Coursera also offers stu
dents the opportunity to partici
pate in online discussion forums,
which Ng said are an attempt to
mimic as closely as possible the
experience of the intimate class
room discussion fundamental to

many humanities courses. Ng
described the forums as very
successful so far but also limited.
"I think there are certain
seminar classes where an in
structor walks around a room,
very discussion-based courses
I think we're still figuring out
the technology of how to offer
that," Ng said. 'An online dis
cussion forum is different. It is
definitely different... I think we
still have a long way to go,
frankly, to simulate more of the
average classroom discussion."
Retaining valuable aspects
Satz said that she sees im
mense value in online education
platforms such as Coursera, es
pecially in their potential to low
er the cost of higher education.
"To the extent that some on
line education helps bring the
cost curve down and make edu
cation more affordable, that's a
good thing," she said. 'And if you
can do it without sacrificing
quality, or, where you need it, de
bate and diversity, that's also a
good thing."
Satz added that she recog
nized the concerns raised by the
San Jose State philosophy facul
ty, citing the risk of valuable
parts of the learning experience
being lost in online dissemina
tion.
"One of the most important
things is to not just deliver infor
mation [to students] but to teach
them how to reason," Satz said.
'And if we don't teach our stu
dents how to make knowledge,
not just how to consume knowl
edge, then we're not doing what
higher education is supposed to
do."
Sailer also emphasized the
importance of offering students
a range of perspectives.
"Diversity of ideas, like ge
netic diversity, I think is a good
thing in certain subjects," Sailer
said. "In Beginning Algebra,
that's probably not what you
want, but in most humanities
subjects, I think that is what you
want, whether it's literary inter
pretation or philosophy or his
torical interpretation."
"I think we need to be cau
tious about overstating what
this form of knowledge transfer
can deliver," Satz added.
