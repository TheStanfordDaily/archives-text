## ASSU Exec appoints 15 to cabinet Gallagher; Ashton select larger cabinet than previous Exec, continue aversion to titles 
### LUCY SVOBODA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ASSU Co-Presidents Billy Gallagher 'l4 and Dan
Ashton 'l4 have officially appointed their executive cab
inet, selecting 15 cabinet members from a pool of 50 ap
plicants. The cabinet held their first meeting on Mon
day evening.

The size of next year's cabinet marks a significant
increase over this year's cabinet, which consisted of
three members. It remains smaller, however, than the
cabinet of former ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
and Vice President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3,
which had 16 members.
"Essentially Dan and I thought that offering a spot
to anyone [like Cruz and Macgregor-Dennis did] was
n't going to work as well, but we did feel like we want
ed a bigger body than [outgoing ASSU Executives]
Robbie [Zimbroff 'l2 M.A. 'l3 and Will [Wagstaff 'l2
M.A. 'l3] had," Gallagher said. "15 was the number we
came up with to keep the cabinet small and focused
with tangible objectives."
Unlike Zimbroff and Wagstaff, who waited until
summer before making cabinet appointments, Gal
lagher and Ashton started their search immediately af
ter being elected.
In addition to sending out a campus-wide email with
an application, the co-presidents sought out former col
leaguesâ€” from Ashton's time in the ASSU Under
graduate Senate and Gallagher's time at The Daily
and other outstanding students. They also sought out
individuals from several endorsement groups involved
in the ASSU election process.
"Ultimately, we looked for individuals who were
very motivated, very self driven, and able to deliver a
project totally by themselves," Gallagher said. "We al
so wanted a cabinet that represented a good breadth
and depth of the student body."
Using a basic scoring process, Gallagher and Ash
ton selected 25 students to interview and eventually
gave positions to 15 people, slightly more than their ini
tial target of 10 to 12 people. The final 15 include a
coterminal student, a law student, a student at the
Graduate School of Business and a mixture of under
graduates.
"More than 15 would be too much for us to manage,
and less than 15 would be denying too many good can
didates," Gallagher said. "We felt like these really tal
ented people are willing to help the ASSU and work
with it, and there was not really any compelling reason

to deny them from doing that."
Cabinet appointee and former ASSU Senator Viraj
Bindra 'l5 described the incoming cabinet as the right
size.
"I think that three people precludes the cabinet from
doing much else when you already have one person who
is in charge of all of the financial stuff on the Exec side,"
he said. "I think that [having] 15 [members] allows a lot
of us to pursue our own smaller initiatives and also come
together and put all hands on deck for bigger things
that we want to get done."
Unlike the outgoing cabinet, none of the new cabinet
members will have formal titles. Members will each
work on individual projects, but the co-presidents ex
pressed hope that the absence of titles will give mem
bers the flexibility to work on several different types of
projects.
"I think it allows us to adapt more to the student
body instead of pigeonholing everyone in something
that's static for the whole year," Gallagher said.
Susie Choi 'l2 J.D. 'l5, a first-year law student who
is returning to the Executive cabinet for the third time
in her Stanford career, expressed surprise at the lack
of teams or chairs, which had been used in her two pre
vious years on cabinet (2008-2009 and 2010-2011). She
noted, however, that the change might prove useful.
"In the past I was solely working on projects per
taining to a single issue, which was a little bit limiting
in a sense," she said. "While the team structure could
definitely be useful, I think that not having it could re
ally help us branch out into areas that pop up during
the year."
Gallagher expressed hope that this structural
change will eliminate any hierarchy within the cabinet.
"We really feel that any of these people could have
been an ASSU Exec," Gallagher said. "I can emphasize
the fact that these are all equal members."
The only exception to the lack of hierarchy is Chief
of Staff Alon Elhanan 'l4. Elhanan, a former ASSU
senator, will be responsible for helping Ashton and Gal
lagher with day-to-day business and overseeing the
cabinet members.
"My number one goal is making sure the cabinet is a
well-functioning organization," he said. "[lt] is a project
that in itself... needs to have clear goals and clear out
lines. My job is to check that the rest of the cabinet are
staying on their game, are motivated and have all of the
resources that they need to complete their tasks."
While that will be Elhanan's main responsibility, he
is also committed to making sure that the ASSU's vari
ous institutions work together better.
"I'm really going to try to make it a focus of my po-
