# ACADEMICS
## Honors theses challenge, enrich 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Each year, some seniors from de
partments across the University
spend their final year as undergradu
ates working on an honors thesis
project that acts as an academic cap
stone for their time at Stanford.
Some students write reports about
the research they have done in labs
since their freshman or sophomore
year, others write about their field
work in a foreign country and still
others take on a more creative stance
with artistic final projects.
For most, the honors thesis jour
ney accounts for one the most chal
lenging— and enriching experi
ences of them academic careers.

From research to thesis
Cody Aros 'l3, a biology major,
wrote his thesis on long non-coding
RNAs and their role in coetaneous
squamous cell carcinoma, the most
common form of skin cancer. The
goal of Aros' project was to identify,
from a clinical standpoint, the novel
therapies of this skin cancer through
a genomic characterization of the
disease and by looking for RNA
species that are important in regu
lating epidermal homeostasis.
"It's quite a mouthful," he said. "I
joined the lab at the end of my fresh
man year and the [post-doctoral stu
dent] that I worked closely with had
the foundations for the project," he
said. "After we performed the se
quencing on patient samples we had,
I studied one candidate RNA that
was interesting to us."
Aros spent about nine to 10 hours
per week in the lab during his fresh
men year and continued into his soph
omore year. During his smnmers he
worked for 40-50 hours a week and
then spent closer to 20 hours a week
in the lab his junior and senior years.
As a junior, he realized that what be
gan as a research assistant position
could turn into something more inte
gral to his academic experience.
For Aros, the entire process as
opposed to simply the end product

was enjoyable.
"Having done the research be
forehand...the process of writing all of
what I had done throughout my un
dergraduate experience was reward
ing," he said. "It was both reflective
and I felt that I was learning how to
best convey my results... I felt like
everything came full circle every
thing came together and there was a
finality to it.
Despite his gratification, Aros'
process, like that of many other stu
dents, was not without difficulties.
"I started working on this one
project during my sophomore year,
and I could kind of see it turning into
a thesis project, but I'd say by the end
of my sophomore year, beginning of
junior year, the project kind of failed,"
he said. "It was part of the process
and I used the skills I learned in that
project to guide my next project."
For Aros, the most challenging
part was coming to the realization

that one of the projects he was work
ing on was not going to make it into
his thesis.
"The thesis experience is not just
the project that succeeded and what
you ultimately end up writing on," he
said. "For me, it's from the start of my
research to the end of it."
Much in the same vein as Aros,
Ruby Lee 'l3 was inspired to embark
on her honors thesis after joining her
professor's lab.
Lee's honors thesis focuses on a
data process platform she built that
allows the user to extract data from
any slice of a simulation, giving a visu
al representation drawn in real-time
with the data that is being regenerat
ed.
"I took a class [with] my advisor,
[Assistant Professor of Bioengineer
ing] Markus Covert, who taught
810E101... and was compelled by
him, so I talked to him more and
joined his lab," she said. "I was given
flexibility in what I wanted to do, so I
spent the academic year talking to
people, getting a handle on the work
they were doing... With the data visu
alization project, I felt like I had a
good handle on how I could approach
it and I had an idea about the end
product."
According to Lee, a goal of the
project was to develop a tool that
would help the lab and make it possi
ble to communicate the data to the
public.
"Originally, I was just going to do
research without honors," Lee said.
"[Bioengineering] is a new major and
this was the first year they offered the
option...l thought it aligned really
well with what I was going to be do
ing."
In Lee's opinion, the most capti
vating part of her experience was the
multidimensionality of her finished
work.
"In my case, [the honors thesis
process] was interesting because the
main goal is the website and the the
sis is more of away to explain how it
works and the process that went into
it, why we chose to implement or de
ny things," she said. "It's nice to have
the thesis and the written process,
with the website as a second compo
nent."
One of the challenges facing Lee
was conveying the relevancy of such
conceptual as opposed to practi
cal research.
"From the perspective of people
in the lab, it's clear why we'd be mo
tived to create this," Lee said. "It
was harder to get the general public
to see it... putting into words to ex
plain the rationale of something
we'd thought about very intensely
but never put into writing. There are
not very many other data visualiza
tion platforms... so finding similar
software programs to compare t0...
and drawing parallels was challeng
ing."

Pursuing passions
For Michael Hughes 'l3, a histo
ry major, one challenge presented
by his thesis was time management.

Hughes, who wrote his thesis on the
New Deal-era Supreme Court, con
ceded that he was prone to procras
tination.
"It's human nature to procrasti
nate," he said. "It's about making
yourself, ahead of time, get some
thing done, and then you can circle
back. In the fall [in a class for stu
dents working on honors theses], I
wrote about half to a third... It was
n't really a thesis but more of a tem
plate, heavily based on secondary
sources... It was immensely helpful
to write that part of it and incorpo
rate it into a longer document. I had
something I could use as a guiding
post."
Hughes used his honors project
as a means of combining two of his
academic interests: the Supreme
Court and economics.
"I was interested in the Supreme
Court and the Court's approach to
government in general history, in re
spect to economics," he said. "[The
Great Depression] was a pivotal
time. The court wasn't completely
against governmental regulation but
would defer to the legislature when
it came to economic issues... I want
ed to complicate things by looking at
early cases that didn't fit that narra
tive."
Hughes also cited the value of an
honors thesis in providing a cap
stone project for his undergraduate
career.
Matthaeus Weinhardt 'l3 M.A.
'l3 decided to forego taking fewer
classes as a senior to focus on his
thesis, instead choosing to coterm
and take 45 units of graduate level
courses.
"I decided on psychology fall of
my freshmen year," Weinhardt said.
"It's a pretty small major and left
me with space, so I started thinking
about what else I could d 0... It was a
nice opportunity to do something
more in-depth, either with honors or
a coterm. I had heard that it was
possible to do a coterm in four years,
so I decided to try."
Weinhardt's research focuses on
intuitive decision-making and inte
gration of value. He led different
psychological experiments that in
volved gambling games played on a
computer, such as choosing between
different colored shapes.
"We can infer the intuitive deci
sions people are making... and
whether intuition picks up on shapes
that pay more or less," he said.
Weinhardt began thinking about
doing his own original research proj
ect early on and applied for the
Chappell-Lougee research grant.
"I ended up doing four or five ex
periments," he said. "Some worked
and some did not, but I was fortu
nate that the most recent did work."

Like Aros, the most challenging
part for Weinhardt was when the
first study did not work out.
"It was supposed to be a replica
tion of another study, with some
changes made to it," Weinhardt said.
"Everyone agreed they were
good changes and that it would
work better, and then it didn't.
The results were confusing and
didn't make sense with the pos
sible theories we were consid
ering. We had to go back to the
drawing board and figure out
why the results looked this
way."

In order to avoid a similar
situation, Weinhardt recom
mended careful deliberation
and an early start.
"If your ideas are good and
you have some persistence,
then you will find what you're
looking for, even if it's not the
original way you thought of it,"
he added. "You will contribute
to the field."

Forging a distinct path
As a junior, jy Olson 'l4 has

only just begun the research
into his thesis project but has a
clear idea of what he wants to
do: a short narrative film that
takes place in North Dakota,
where Olson is from, and focus
es on a Norwegian-American
family.
"Where I'm from is heavily
populated with Norwegian im
migrants," Olson said. "It's eth
nocentric, but not in a bad way
... It perpetuates old world tra
ditions and cultures, values and
ideals... [The film] is a portrait
of an overlooked part of our so
ciety."

Olson, whose cinematic
project diverges significantly
from most other honors theses,
is interested in studying
themes of foreignness in Amer
ica.

"I had an idea for a short
film and American Studies was
the only place that allowed me
to do it," he said. "[An honors
project] gives me academic
support... I can get profession
al and technical support else

where, but it's great discussing
the themes I'm talking about
and having the support of an
advisor and a department at
Stanford."
In addition to a 22-minute
film, Olson's project will in
clude a 10- to 15-page reflection
paper that will tie in some of
the academic questions he
studies in his movie, exploring
his questions more and bring
ing in some of the other materi
als he has been studying in
preparation.
Olson has some experience
making short films and filming
professional music videos for
Scandinavian artists, but he
hopes to gain more experience
with an endeavor for which he
will travel to North Dakota to
conduct filming.

"It's a short film that will be
comprised of a lot of family
members and locals," he said.
The biggest challenge Olson
envisions will be fundraising
for the project. Although he
has some leads, he concedes

that recruiting community
members for financial support
will not be easy.
Still, Olson is hopeful that
his project will succeed, citing
his stalwart devotion to the in
spiration his Norwegian
heritage that encouraged
him to pursue an honors thesis
in the first place.
"People start to lose track
of why they are interested [in
their topic]," he said. "You need
to hone in on it and what it is
that made you interested in the
first place ... you'll inject more
of a personal connection to
your thesis, since you live with
it for a year."
Aros echoed this perspec
tive.

"Pick something you are in
terested in," Aros said. "It's a
long road and it can be chal
lenging. If you're not doing
something you're interested in,
it will be harder."

possible to do a coterm in four years,
so I decided to try."
Weinhardt's research focuses on
intuitive decision-making and inte
gration of value. He led different
psychological experiments that in
volved gambling games played on a
computer, such as choosing between
different colored shapes.
"We can infer the intuitive deci
sions people are making... and
whether intuition picks up on shapes
that pay more or less," he said.
Weinhardt began thinking about
doing his own original research proj
ect early on and applied for the
Chappell-Lougee research grant.
"I ended up doing four or five ex
periments," he said. "Some worked
and some did not, but I was fortu
nate that the most recent did work."

Like Aros, the most challenging
part for Weinhardt was when the
first study did not work out.
"It was supposed to be a replica
tion of another study, with some
changes made to it," Weinhardt said.
"Everyone agreed they were
good changes and that it would
work better, and then it didn't.
The results were confusing and
didn't make sense with the pos
sible theories we were consid
ering. We had to go back to the
drawing board and figure out
why the results looked this
way."

In order to avoid a similar
situation, Weinhardt recom
mended careful deliberation
and an early start.
"If your ideas are good and
you have some persistence,
then you will find what you're
looking for, even if it's not the
original way you thought of it,"
he added. "You will contribute
to the field."

Forging a distinct path
As a junior, jy Olson 'l4 has

only just begun the research
into his thesis project but has a
clear idea of what he wants to
do: a short narrative film that
takes place in North Dakota,
where Olson is from, and focus
es on a Norwegian-American
family.
"Where I'm from is heavily
populated with Norwegian im
migrants," Olson said. "It's eth
nocentric, but not in a bad way
... It perpetuates old world tra
ditions and cultures, values and
ideals... [The film] is a portrait
of an overlooked part of our so
ciety."

Olson, whose cinematic
project diverges significantly
from most other honors theses,
is interested in studying
themes of foreignness in Amer
ica.

"I had an idea for a short
film and American Studies was
the only place that allowed me
to do it," he said. "[An honors
project] gives me academic
support... I can get profession
al and technical support else

where, but it's great discussing
the themes I'm talking about
and having the support of an
advisor and a department at
Stanford."
In addition to a 22-minute
film, Olson's project will in
clude a 10- to 15-page reflection
paper that will tie in some of
the academic questions he
studies in his movie, exploring
his questions more and bring
ing in some of the other materi
als he has been studying in
preparation.
Olson has some experience
making short films and filming
professional music videos for
Scandinavian artists, but he
hopes to gain more experience
with an endeavor for which he
will travel to North Dakota to
conduct filming.

"It's a short film that will be
comprised of a lot of family
members and locals," he said.
The biggest challenge Olson
envisions will be fundraising
for the project. Although he
has some leads, he concedes

that recruiting community
members for financial support
will not be easy.
Still, Olson is hopeful that
his project will succeed, citing
his stalwart devotion to the in
spiration his Norwegian
heritage that encouraged
him to pursue an honors thesis
in the first place.
"People start to lose track
of why they are interested [in
their topic]," he said. "You need
to hone in on it and what it is
that made you interested in the
first place ... you'll inject more
of a personal connection to
your thesis, since you live with
it for a year."
Aros echoed this perspec
tive.

"Pick something you are in
terested in," Aros said. "It's a
long road and it can be chal
lenging. If you're not doing
something you're interested in,
it will be harder."

Each year, some seniors from de
partments across the University
spend their final year as undergradu
ates working on an honors thesis
project that acts as an academic cap
stone for their time at Stanford.
Some students write reports about
the research they have done in labs
since their freshman or sophomore
year, others write about their field
work in a foreign country and still
others take on a more creative stance
with artistic final projects.
For most, the honors thesis jour
ney accounts for one the most chal
lenging— and enriching experi
ences of them academic careers.

From research to thesis
Cody Aros 'l3, a biology major,
wrote his thesis on long non-coding
RNAs and their role in coetaneous
squamous cell carcinoma, the most
common form of skin cancer. The
goal of Aros' project was to identify,
from a clinical standpoint, the novel
therapies of this skin cancer through
a genomic characterization of the
disease and by looking for RNA
species that are important in regu
lating epidermal homeostasis.
"It's quite a mouthful," he said. "I
joined the lab at the end of my fresh
man year and the [post-doctoral stu
dent] that I worked closely with had
the foundations for the project," he
said. "After we performed the se
quencing on patient samples we had,
I studied one candidate RNA that
was interesting to us."
Aros spent about nine to 10 hours
per week in the lab during his fresh
men year and continued into his soph
omore year. During his smnmers he
worked for 40-50 hours a week and
then spent closer to 20 hours a week
in the lab his junior and senior years.
As a junior, he realized that what be
gan as a research assistant position
could turn into something more inte
gral to his academic experience.
For Aros, the entire process as
opposed to simply the end product

was enjoyable.
"Having done the research be
forehand...the process of writing all of
what I had done throughout my un
dergraduate experience was reward
ing," he said. "It was both reflective
and I felt that I was learning how to
best convey my results... I felt like
everything came full circle every
thing came together and there was a
finality to it.
Despite his gratification, Aros'
process, like that of many other stu
dents, was not without difficulties.
"I started working on this one
project during my sophomore year,
and I could kind of see it turning into
a thesis project, but I'd say by the end
of my sophomore year, beginning of
junior year, the project kind of failed,"
he said. "It was part of the process
and I used the skills I learned in that
project to guide my next project."
For Aros, the most challenging
part was coming to the realization

that one of the projects he was work
ing on was not going to make it into
his thesis.
"The thesis experience is not just
the project that succeeded and what
you ultimately end up writing on," he
said. "For me, it's from the start of my
research to the end of it."
Much in the same vein as Aros,
Ruby Lee 'l3 was inspired to embark
on her honors thesis after joining her
professor's lab.
Lee's honors thesis focuses on a
data process platform she built that
allows the user to extract data from
any slice of a simulation, giving a visu
al representation drawn in real-time
with the data that is being regenerat
ed.
"I took a class [with] my advisor,
[Assistant Professor of Bioengineer
ing] Markus Covert, who taught
810E101... and was compelled by
him, so I talked to him more and
joined his lab," she said. "I was given
flexibility in what I wanted to do, so I
spent the academic year talking to
people, getting a handle on the work
they were doing... With the data visu
alization project, I felt like I had a
good handle on how I could approach
it and I had an idea about the end
product."
According to Lee, a goal of the
project was to develop a tool that
would help the lab and make it possi
ble to communicate the data to the
public.
"Originally, I was just going to do
research without honors," Lee said.
"[Bioengineering] is a new major and
this was the first year they offered the
option...l thought it aligned really
well with what I was going to be do
ing."
In Lee's opinion, the most capti
vating part of her experience was the
multidimensionality of her finished
work.
"In my case, [the honors thesis
process] was interesting because the
main goal is the website and the the
sis is more of away to explain how it
works and the process that went into
it, why we chose to implement or de
ny things," she said. "It's nice to have
the thesis and the written process,
with the website as a second compo
nent."
One of the challenges facing Lee
was conveying the relevancy of such
conceptual as opposed to practi
cal research.
"From the perspective of people
in the lab, it's clear why we'd be mo
tived to create this," Lee said. "It
was harder to get the general public
to see it... putting into words to ex
plain the rationale of something
we'd thought about very intensely
but never put into writing. There are
not very many other data visualiza
tion platforms... so finding similar
software programs to compare t0...
and drawing parallels was challeng
ing."

Pursuing passions
For Michael Hughes 'l3, a histo
ry major, one challenge presented
by his thesis was time management.

Hughes, who wrote his thesis on the
New Deal-era Supreme Court, con
ceded that he was prone to procras
tination.
"It's human nature to procrasti
nate," he said. "It's about making
yourself, ahead of time, get some
thing done, and then you can circle
back. In the fall [in a class for stu
dents working on honors theses], I
wrote about half to a third... It was
n't really a thesis but more of a tem
plate, heavily based on secondary
sources... It was immensely helpful
to write that part of it and incorpo
rate it into a longer document. I had
something I could use as a guiding
post."
Hughes used his honors project
as a means of combining two of his
academic interests: the Supreme
Court and economics.
"I was interested in the Supreme
Court and the Court's approach to
government in general history, in re
spect to economics," he said. "[The
Great Depression] was a pivotal
time. The court wasn't completely
against governmental regulation but
would defer to the legislature when
it came to economic issues... I want
ed to complicate things by looking at
early cases that didn't fit that narra
tive."
Hughes also cited the value of an
honors thesis in providing a cap
stone project for his undergraduate
career.
Matthaeus Weinhardt 'l3 M.A.
'l3 decided to forego taking fewer
classes as a senior to focus on his
thesis, instead choosing to coterm
and take 45 units of graduate level
courses.
"I decided on psychology fall of
my freshmen year," Weinhardt said.
"It's a pretty small major and left
me with space, so I started thinking
about what else I could d 0... It was a
nice opportunity to do something
more in-depth, either with honors or
a coterm. I had heard that it was
possible to do a coterm in four years,
so I decided to try."
Weinhardt's research focuses on
intuitive decision-making and inte
gration of value. He led different
psychological experiments that in
volved gambling games played on a
computer, such as choosing between
different colored shapes.
"We can infer the intuitive deci
sions people are making... and
whether intuition picks up on shapes
that pay more or less," he said.
Weinhardt began thinking about
doing his own original research proj
ect early on and applied for the
Chappell-Lougee research grant.
"I ended up doing four or five ex
periments," he said. "Some worked

Much in the same vein as Aros,
Ruby Lee 'l3 was inspired to embark
on her honors thesis after joining her
professor's lab.
Lee's honors thesis focuses on a
data process platform she built that
allows the user to extract data from
any slice of a simulation, giving a visu
al representation drawn in real-time
with the data that is being regenerat
ed.
"I took a class [with] my advisor,
[Assistant Professor of Bioengineer
ing] Markus Covert, who taught
810E101... and was compelled by
him, so I talked to him more and
joined his lab," she said. "I was given
flexibility in what I wanted to do, so I
spent the academic year talking to
people, getting a handle on the work
they were doing... With the data visu
alization project, I felt like I had a
good handle on how I could approach
it and I had an idea about the end
product."
According to Lee, a goal of the
project was to develop a tool that
would help the lab and make it possi
ble to communicate the data to the
public.
"Originally, I was just going to do
research without honors," Lee said.
"[Bioengineering] is a new major and
this was the first year they offered the
option...l thought it aligned really
well with what I was going to be do
ing."
In Lee's opinion, the most capti
vating part of her experience was the
multidimensionality of her finished
work.
"In my case, [the honors thesis
process] was interesting because the
main goal is the website and the the
sis is more of away to explain how it
works and the process that went into
it, why we chose to implement or de
ny things," she said. "It's nice to have
the thesis and the written process,
with the website as a second compo
nent."
One of the challenges facing Lee
was conveying the relevancy of such
conceptual as opposed to practi
cal research.
"From the perspective of people
in the lab, it's clear why we'd be mo
tived to create this," Lee said. "It
was harder to get the general public
to see it... putting into words to ex
plain the rationale of something
we'd thought about very intensely
but never put into writing. There are
not very many other data visualiza
tion platforms... so finding similar
software programs to compare t0...
and drawing parallels was challeng
ing."

Pursuing passions
For Michael Hughes 'l3, a histo
ry major, one challenge presented
by his thesis was time management.

Hughes, who wrote his thesis on the
New Deal-era Supreme Court, con
ceded that he was prone to procras
tination.
"It's human nature to procrasti
nate," he said. "It's about making
yourself, ahead of time, get some
thing done, and then you can circle
back. In the fall [in a class for stu
dents working on honors theses], I
wrote about half to a third... It was
n't really a thesis but more of a tem
plate, heavily based on secondary
sources... It was immensely helpful
to write that part of it and incorpo
rate it into a longer document. I had
something I could use as a guiding
post."
Hughes used his honors project
as a means of combining two of his
academic interests: the Supreme
Court and economics.
"I was interested in the Supreme
Court and the Court's approach to
government in general history, in re
spect to economics," he said. "[The
Great Depression] was a pivotal
time. The court wasn't completely
against governmental regulation but
would defer to the legislature when
it came to economic issues... I want
ed to complicate things by looking at
early cases that didn't fit that narra
tive."
Hughes also cited the value of an
honors thesis in providing a cap
stone project for his undergraduate
career.
Matthaeus Weinhardt 'l3 M.A.
'l3 decided to forego taking fewer
classes as a senior to focus on his
thesis, instead choosing to coterm
and take 45 units of graduate level
courses.
"I decided on psychology fall of
my freshmen year," Weinhardt said.
"It's a pretty small major and left
me with space, so I started thinking
about what else I could d 0... It was a
nice opportunity to do something
more in-depth, either with honors or
a coterm. I had heard that it was
possible to do a coterm in four years,
so I decided to try."
Weinhardt's research focuses on
intuitive decision-making and inte
gration of value. He led different
psychological experiments that in
volved gambling games played on a
computer, such as choosing between
different colored shapes.
"We can infer the intuitive deci
sions people are making... and
whether intuition picks up on shapes
that pay more or less," he said.
Weinhardt began thinking about
doing his own original research proj
ect early on and applied for the
Chappell-Lougee research grant.
"I ended up doing four or five ex
periments," he said. "Some worked
and some did not, but I was fortu
nate that the most recent did work."

Like Aros, the most challenging
part for Weinhardt was when the
first study did not work out.
"It was supposed to be a replica
tion of another study, with some
changes made to it," Weinhardt said.
"Everyone agreed they were
good changes and that it would
work better, and then it didn't.
The results were confusing and
didn't make sense with the pos
sible theories we were consid
ering. We had to go back to the
drawing board and figure out
why the results looked this
way."

In order to avoid a similar
situation, Weinhardt recom
mended careful deliberation
and an early start.
"If your ideas are good and
you have some persistence,
then you will find what you're
looking for, even if it's not the
original way you thought of it,"
he added. "You will contribute
to the field."

Forging a distinct path
As a junior, jy Olson 'l4 has

only just begun the research
into his thesis project but has a
clear idea of what he wants to
do: a short narrative film that
takes place in North Dakota,
where Olson is from, and focus
es on a Norwegian-American
family.
"Where I'm from is heavily
populated with Norwegian im
migrants," Olson said. "It's eth
nocentric, but not in a bad way
... It perpetuates old world tra
ditions and cultures, values and
ideals... [The film] is a portrait
of an overlooked part of our so
ciety."

Olson, whose cinematic
project diverges significantly
from most other honors theses,
is interested in studying
themes of foreignness in Amer
ica.

"I had an idea for a short
film and American Studies was
the only place that allowed me
to do it," he said. "[An honors
project] gives me academic
support... I can get profession
al and technical support else

where, but it's great discussing
the themes I'm talking about
and having the support of an
advisor and a department at
Stanford."
In addition to a 22-minute
film, Olson's project will in
clude a 10- to 15-page reflection
paper that will tie in some of
the academic questions he
studies in his movie, exploring
his questions more and bring
ing in some of the other materi
als he has been studying in
preparation.
Olson has some experience
making short films and filming
professional music videos for
Scandinavian artists, but he
hopes to gain more experience
with an endeavor for which he
will travel to North Dakota to
conduct filming.

"It's a short film that will be
comprised of a lot of family
members and locals," he said.
The biggest challenge Olson
envisions will be fundraising
for the project. Although he
has some leads, he concedes

that recruiting community
members for financial support
will not be easy.
Still, Olson is hopeful that
his project will succeed, citing
his stalwart devotion to the in
spiration his Norwegian
heritage that encouraged
him to pursue an honors thesis
in the first place.
"People start to lose track
of why they are interested [in
their topic]," he said. "You need
to hone in on it and what it is
that made you interested in the
first place ... you'll inject more
of a personal connection to
your thesis, since you live with
it for a year."
Aros echoed this perspec
tive.

"Pick something you are in
terested in," Aros said. "It's a
long road and it can be chal
lenging. If you're not doing
something you're interested in,
it will be harder."

Each year, some seniors from de
partments across the University
spend their final year as undergradu
ates working on an honors thesis
project that acts as an academic cap
stone for their time at Stanford.
Some students write reports about
the research they have done in labs
since their freshman or sophomore
year, others write about their field
work in a foreign country and still
others take on a more creative stance
with artistic final projects.
For most, the honors thesis jour
ney accounts for one the most chal
lenging— and enriching experi
ences of them academic careers.

From research to thesis
Cody Aros 'l3, a biology major,
wrote his thesis on long non-coding
RNAs and their role in coetaneous
squamous cell carcinoma, the most
common form of skin cancer. The
goal of Aros' project was to identify,
from a clinical standpoint, the novel
therapies of this skin cancer through
a genomic characterization of the
disease and by looking for RNA
species that are important in regu
lating epidermal homeostasis.
"It's quite a mouthful," he said. "I
joined the lab at the end of my fresh
man year and the [post-doctoral stu
dent] that I worked closely with had
the foundations for the project," he
said. "After we performed the se
quencing on patient samples we had,
I studied one candidate RNA that
was interesting to us."
Aros spent about nine to 10 hours
per week in the lab during his fresh
men year and continued into his soph
omore year. During his smnmers he
worked for 40-50 hours a week and
then spent closer to 20 hours a week
in the lab his junior and senior years.
As a junior, he realized that what be
gan as a research assistant position
could turn into something more inte
gral to his academic experience.
For Aros, the entire process as
opposed to simply the end product

was enjoyable.
"Having done the research be
forehand...the process of writing all of
what I had done throughout my un
dergraduate experience was reward
ing," he said. "It was both reflective
and I felt that I was learning how to
best convey my results... I felt like
everything came full circle every
thing came together and there was a
finality to it.
Despite his gratification, Aros'
process, like that of many other stu
dents, was not without difficulties.
"I started working on this one
project during my sophomore year,
and I could kind of see it turning into
a thesis project, but I'd say by the end
of my sophomore year, beginning of
junior year, the project kind of failed,"
he said. "It was part of the process
and I used the skills I learned in that
project to guide my next project."
For Aros, the most challenging
part was coming to the realization

that one of the projects he was work
ing on was not going to make it into
his thesis.
"The thesis experience is not just
the project that succeeded and what
you ultimately end up writing on," he
said. "For me, it's from the start of my
research to the end of it."
Much in the same vein as Aros,
Ruby Lee 'l3 was inspired to embark
on her honors thesis after joining her
professor's lab.
