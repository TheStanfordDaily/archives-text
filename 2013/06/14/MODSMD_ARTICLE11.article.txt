More than 120 Stanford stu
dents gathered in the middle of
White Plaza on Monday afternoon
to protest the University's recent
decision to end student manage
ment at Suites Eating Clubs.
The move to contract the opera
tions of Suites Dining to an outside
vendor, which was announced by
Residential Education (ResEd) at
the end of January, has been widely
derided by the Stanford community
as symptomatic of the University's
corporatization and representative
of an increasing encroachment upon
student autonomy.
Students who showed up at the
protest said the event stemmed
from frustration over a series of
University decisions—which they
felt had been made without serious
consultation from the community
members that would subsequently
be affected made over the past
three years.
These include the University's
decisions to revoke the lease of the
student-run Chi Theta Chi last Feb
ruary, to launch a $5.5 million proj
ect to install of card readers on Row
houses last fall and to establish a
new food vendor policy that has
driven popular food trucks off cam
pus this winter.

"There is a common theme of
[the] University administration not
consulting with the student body
while drafting these decisions, in
stead implementing these decisions
and then announcing them to the
masses through email," said event
organizer Ma'ayan Dembo 'l4,
speaking through a loud speaker
while standing on the stage outside
of Dinkelspiel Auditorium. "It is our
right as paying students and adults
to have a voice on these reforms and
demand more transparency from
the administration."
The statement received one of
the largest rounds of applause of
the day from the audience. A few of

its members waved signs and ban
ners with slogans like "Stop stan
ford" and "Goodbye wind of free
dom, Hello Stanford Housing."
Students seeking a voice
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3, a
Daily staffer, has been credited for
helping such issues gain traction
among the student body, and his
long-form article about the end of
Suites Dining's student manage
ment has prompted extensive read
er response since its publication last
week. As of Monday night, the first
page of the online article has re
ceived more than 2,500 Facebook
likes and 16,400 unique page views,
making it the fifth most-read story
on the Daily's website since the
2008-09 academic year.
The article was part investiga
tive journalism, examining the ra
tionales put forward by ResEd as
justifying ending student manage
ment at Suites Dining, and part per
sonal narrative, exploring Unter
reiner's own experience working as
a hasher at Suites and his interac
tions with its chefs, particularly

Bollard Eating Club head chef
Frank Hassan.
Speaking to The Daily the night
before the protest, Dembo, who is
neither a Suites nor XOX resident,
said that it was this article that in
spired her to take action.
"I was reading through the arti
cle, and at the end, it said something
like, 'lt's time to take action,' and I
realized, 'Yeah, we should,"' Dembo
said. "I was talking about it with my
friends all weekend, kind of expect
ing and waiting for something to
happen, and then I finally decided
that maybe I should be the one to
take action instead."
According to Dembo, she sent
out an email to 12 of her friends
Sunday afternoon, with the inten
tion of collectively walking into the
ResEd office and attempting to
have a conversation with adminis
trators. The email, however, was
quickly forwarded to several large
student mailing lists. Even so, as of
Sunday night, Dembo still predicted
that approximately 30 to 50 stu
dents would turn up.
"I was not expecting this many

people to show up," Unterreiner
agreed after the event. "We didn't
veven get the Facebook page up un
til yesterday evening. I was a little
worried that there hadn't been
enough publicity and enough people
wouldn't show up, so I think the fact
that on one night's notice you can
have over 100 people show up to
White Plaza... I think it just shows
how deep the discontent runs and
just how powerful students feel
about this. That was encouraging to
me."
Unterreiner helped to publicize
the event to students on Facebook
since Dembo did not initially have
an account on the social networking
site. He also spoke at the protest.
"ResEd is interested in eliminat
ing a non-profit organization and
replace it with a for-profit corpora
tion," he told the crowd. "It makes
no economic, moral or ethical sense.
We are here because ResEd is cor
poratizing student dining at the ex
pense of students like you guys."
According to Unterreiner, one of
the most positive aspects of the
protest was providing the chefs

from the Suites Dining Clubs
whose contracts, as of now, will not
be renewed next year an oppor
tunity to voice their opinions. The
audience broke out into applause
when Hassan and Avanti chef An
ton "Tony" Dietz showed up in
White Plaza.
"It would be nice to know what
exactly is the mission of Residential
Education," Dietz said on stage. "I
would think their capacity is one
where they are advisors [to] stu
dents, not to be an organization that
dismantles your dining societies."
Instead of marching to the
ResEd Central Office in Tresidder
Union as initially planned, the pro
testers ended up being able to ask
questions of Nate Boswell '99 M.A.
'O9, associate dean of ResEd, who
had showed up on the steps of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium prior to the
event.

"He said he's here to listen, so
I'm really hoping that he is here to
listen and dialogue," said Erika
Kreeger +l5, a student protester,

More than 120 students gathered in White Plaza on Feb. 25 to protest a University decision to end student management at Suites Eating Clubs.
Students at the event cited other recent University actions, like the decision to revoke Chi Theta Chi's lease, as symptomatic of a broader issue.
when news first spread among the
crowd that Boswell had made an
appearance at the event.
Boswell introduced himself as a
Stanford alumnus who had been a
member of the Avanti Dining Soci
ety himself during his time here.
"I think that in the long run we
will have to be able to sit down with
a representative group, not just the
Governor's Corner Dining Society,
perhaps the ASSU or you guys
here today to talk through those
things a little bit more," Boswell
said.
Overall, Boswell appeared com
fortable and willing to engage with
protestors, although students in
the crowd criticized him of saying
little of substance.
At one point, Boswell said, "Let
me say that I think ResEd is a
nexus point for University commu
nication." He quickly followed up
with, "What does that mean?"
which resulted in an outburst of
laughter from the audience. One
male student exclaimed loudly,
"Bullshit!"
Throughout the event, Unter
reiner pressed Boswell with the
question, "How does this make stu
dent life better?" when Boswell
continued to talk about the reasons
for ending the student manage
ment of Suites Dining Clubs.
"I don't have an answer,"
Boswell eventually responded.
Boswell did say that there were
aspects of the situation surround
ing Suites Dining that students did
not know about, which contributed
to Res Ed's decision.
"Many of you probably don't
know I can't talk about it much
but you don't know that there is
active litigation against the Gover
nor's Corner Dining Society by a
former employer and against Stan
ford University," he said. "We have
been uncomfortable talking about
that."
In a post-event interview with
the Daily, Unterreiner alleged that
this was a dirty trick by Boswell.
"I was disappointed by that tac
tic because there is a lawsuit ongo
ing against both Governor's Cor
ner Dining Society [GCDS] and the
University I'm not allowed to
comment on that, and nobody is al
lowed to comment on that," Unter
reiner said. "I really don't know
what I can say within the bounds of
the law, but having that tossed
around them tossed a lot of doubt
on our credibility without having to
prove that the lawsuit has any mer
it. I thought it was unfair to men
tion that there is a lawsuit ongoing
that makes it seem like there are
terrible things going on in Suites,
which there are not."
Unterreiner also added that the
GCDS has a $2 million liability pol
icy for exactly this sort of situation.
An emerging dialogue
After the event, Boswell told a
group of students that Students
Organized Services (SOS) is no
longer interested in bidding for
Suites Dining. SOS is a for-profit,
privately-held company, which op
erates food-related labor services
for the Row and which is headed up
by Nick Peters '94.
Peters' brother-in-law is Zac
Sargeant, who was hired as assis
tant director of ResEd in 2008. Be
cause of this connection, students
have accused ResEd of ignoring
or perpetuating a conflict of in
terest in choosing SOS as the pri
vate contractor for Suites.
According to Unterreiner, the
current chefs of Suites Dining
Clubs now plan to incorporate as
an LLC before next year and bid to
be the private contractor for

Suites. Boswell seemed to be
amenable to this course of action.
"We would feel more comfort
able if the chefs were the vendors
rather than the students were the
vendors," Boswell told a group of
students following the formal
protest. "The chefs are profession
als, who —as they have said
who we can work with, hold ac
countable and interact with and so
on."

Unterreiner said this is still not
the ideal scenario, and that he will
continue to fight for a student-run
Suites Dining.

"I think even forcing the chefs
to go up against an outside compa
ny is inherently disrespectful to the
service that they have put in over
years over many many years of
service to Stanford," he said.
"They shouldn't have to compete
against an outside company for
reasons that haven't been fully ex
plained. My goal is to fight against
them having to bid at all."
Students also said that they will
continue to fight against ResEd
and University administrators.
"I was responding to a really
well-written article that made con
crete a lot of the things that were
wrong with this particular situa
tion," said Elizabeth Matus 'l4, a
protester. "And the University if
it wants to have any leverage way
will have to respond in an equal
ly concrete and thorough way."
