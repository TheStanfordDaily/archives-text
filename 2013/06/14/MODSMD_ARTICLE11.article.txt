More than 120 Stanford stu
dents gathered in the middle of
White Plaza on Monday afternoon
to protest the University's recent
decision to end student manage
ment at Suites Eating Clubs.
The move to contract the opera
tions of Suites Dining to an outside
vendor, which was announced by
Residential Education (ResEd) at
the end of January, has been widely
derided by the Stanford community
as symptomatic of the University's
corporatization and representative
of an increasing encroachment upon
student autonomy.
Students who showed up at the
protest said the event stemmed
from frustration over a series of
University decisionsâ€”which they
felt had been made without serious
consultation from the community
members that would subsequently
be affected made over the past
three years.
These include the University's
decisions to revoke the lease of the
student-run Chi Theta Chi last Feb
ruary, to launch a $5.5 million proj
ect to install of card readers on Row
houses last fall and to establish a
new food vendor policy that has
driven popular food trucks off cam
pus this winter.

"There is a common theme of
[the] University administration not
consulting with the student body
while drafting these decisions, in
stead implementing these decisions
and then announcing them to the
masses through email," said event
organizer Ma'ayan Dembo 'l4,
speaking through a loud speaker
while standing on the stage outside
of Dinkelspiel Auditorium. "It is our
right as paying students and adults
to have a voice on these reforms and
demand more transparency from
the administration."
The statement received one of
the largest rounds of applause of
the day from the audience. A few of

its members waved signs and ban
ners with slogans like "Stop stan
ford" and "Goodbye wind of free
dom, Hello Stanford Housing."
Students seeking a voice
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3, a
Daily staffer, has been credited for
helping such issues gain traction
among the student body, and his
long-form article about the end of
Suites Dining's student manage
ment has prompted extensive read
er response since its publication last
week. As of Monday night, the first
page of the online article has re
ceived more than 2,500 Facebook
likes and 16,400 unique page views,
making it the fifth most-read story
on the Daily's website since the
2008-09 academic year.
The article was part investiga
tive journalism, examining the ra
tionales put forward by ResEd as
justifying ending student manage
ment at Suites Dining, and part per
sonal narrative, exploring Unter
reiner's own experience working as
a hasher at Suites and his interac
tions with its chefs, particularly

Bollard Eating Club head chef
Frank Hassan.
Speaking to The Daily the night
before the protest, Dembo, who is
neither a Suites nor XOX resident,
said that it was this article that in
spired her to take action.
"I was reading through the arti
cle, and at the end, it said something
like, 'lt's time to take action,' and I
realized, 'Yeah, we should,"' Dembo
said. "I was talking about it with my
friends all weekend, kind of expect
ing and waiting for something to
happen, and then I finally decided
that maybe I should be the one to
take action instead."
According to Dembo, she sent
out an email to 12 of her friends
Sunday afternoon, with the inten
tion of collectively walking into the
ResEd office and attempting to
have a conversation with adminis
trators. The email, however, was
quickly forwarded to several large
student mailing lists. Even so, as of
Sunday night, Dembo still predicted
that approximately 30 to 50 stu
dents would turn up.
"I was not expecting this many

people to show up," Unterreiner
agreed after the event. "We didn't
veven get the Facebook page up un
til yesterday evening. I was a little
worried that there hadn't been
enough publicity and enough people
wouldn't show up, so I think the fact
that on one night's notice you can
have over 100 people show up to
White Plaza... I think it just shows
how deep the discontent runs and
just how powerful students feel
about this. That was encouraging to
me."
Unterreiner helped to publicize
the event to students on Facebook
since Dembo did not initially have
an account on the social networking
site. He also spoke at the protest.
"ResEd is interested in eliminat
ing a non-profit organization and
replace it with a for-profit corpora
tion," he told the crowd. "It makes
no economic, moral or ethical sense.
We are here because ResEd is cor
poratizing student dining at the ex
pense of students like you guys."
According to Unterreiner, one of
the most positive aspects of the
protest was providing the chefs

from the Suites Dining Clubs
whose contracts, as of now, will not
be renewed next year an oppor
tunity to voice their opinions. The
audience broke out into applause
when Hassan and Avanti chef An
ton "Tony" Dietz showed up in
White Plaza.
"It would be nice to know what
exactly is the mission of Residential
Education," Dietz said on stage. "I
would think their capacity is one
where they are advisors [to] stu
dents, not to be an organization that
dismantles your dining societies."
Instead of marching to the
ResEd Central Office in Tresidder
Union as initially planned, the pro
testers ended up being able to ask
questions of Nate Boswell '99 M.A.
'O9, associate dean of ResEd, who
had showed up on the steps of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium prior to the
event.

"He said he's here to listen, so
I'm really hoping that he is here to
listen and dialogue," said Erika
Kreeger +l5, a student protester,

More than 120 students gathered in White Plaza on Feb. 25 to protest a University decision to end student management at Suites Eating Clubs.
Students at the event cited other recent University actions, like the decision to revoke Chi Theta Chi's lease, as symptomatic of a broader issue.
