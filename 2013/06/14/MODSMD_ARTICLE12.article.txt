## Undergrad population set to grow Stanford's student population over time

At his annual presentation to the Ac
ademic Council last month, President
John Hennessy announced a plan to ex
pand the undergraduate student body
in an attempt to keep pace with the
growth of the graduate student popula
tion and allow Stanford to serve more
students, a proposal with broad implica
tions for University admissions, facili
ties and faculty.
The large size of the graduate stu
dent population 8,871 students com
pared to 6,999 undergraduates
marks a sharp reversal from the enroll
ment trends that have dominated much
of Stanford's history.
In every decade until 1990, the un
dergraduate population exceeded the
graduate one. The gap narrowed by
1980, when the student body was about
evenly split. Since then, the graduate
population has continued to grow rapid
ly while the number of undergraduates
has remained relatively constant.
Jeffrey Wachtel '79, senior assistant
to President Hennessy, noted that Hen
nessy sees several benefits in attempting
to expand the undergraduate population
and believes the expansion can be ac
complished without "sacrificing the qual
ity of the undergraduate experience."
"We want to retain our identity as
both an undergraduate and a graduate
institution," Wachtel said. "Although
the numbers are relatively small that
we can add, we think it's sort of an obli
gation for the University."
Hennessy said that he would like the
undergraduate population to expand
soon to counteract the growth of the
graduate and postdoctoral populations
over the last few decades.
"If we assume that there's going to
be some continuing growth in the grad
uate population, perhaps at a slower
rate, then we will, over the next 20
years or so, completely make it impossi
ble to contemplate increasing the un
dergraduate population, because the
grad population will have taken up all
the space on campus," Hennessy said.

More housing
Though the expansion could begin
as early as 2014, according to Wachtel,
the growth in the population would also
need to be accompanied by new facili
ties to maintain the University's guar
antee of housing to all undergraduates.
The University, fresh off a Draw that
left a record number of students unas
signed after the first round, already

plans to build new housing at Manzani
ta Park and Lagunita Court.
"Since we believe strongly in a resi
dential education system, we have to
make sure there are adequate housing
and facilities," Wachtel said. "It de
pends on the planning of the housing
and raising the money for it."
Once housing options are adjusted,
Wachtel said that the University will be
gin increasing the size of the undergrad
uate population by approximately 100
students per year, with a plan to reeval
uate the rate of expansion over time.
According to Hennessy, the upper
bound on the population expansion
would be 25 percent, as growth that is
too dramatic could alter the undergrad
uate experience.
"Everybody has that sense that at
some size the experience would change
in a qualitative way, but nobody knows
what that size is. If we had 16,000 [stu
dents], it would be very different to be
an undergraduate on campus," he said.
"That's far beyond what we're thinking
but the nice thing of doing this grad
ually is that you can get some sense of
what's changing."
Role of admissions
University officials noted that it is
easier to target a specific number of ad
mits for the undergraduate population
compared to graduates, as the nature of
graduate admissions makes it difficult
to systematically increase or decrease
the number of students admitted each
year.
'Admissions at the graduate level is
very decentralized to departments,"
said Vice Provost for Graduate Educa
tion Patricia Gumport M.A. 'B2 M.A. 'B6
Ph.D. 'B7. "At the undergraduate level,
it's very centralized there's one ad
missions office. So that's why the enroll
ment can be managed at the undergrad
level."

While undergraduate enrollment
has remained fairly constant over the
last three decades, the number of appli
cations received by the Office of Under
graduate Admission has skyrocketed.
Hennessy cited this increase in ap
plications as a key reason behind the
decision to expand the undergraduate
population, estimating that the number
of highly qualified applicants has
roughly doubled during his tenure.

"The acceptance rate has plummet
ed," Hennessy said. "A general sense
that the number of students who are
prepared to do work at a place like
Stanford has grown significantly is re
flected in our application pool."
According to Hennessy, the Univer
sity had previously planned to begin of
fering more spots to these applicants,
but the 2008 financial crisis set back the
idea. The gradual recovery of the en
dowment has prompted a renewed fo
cus on expansion.
"For many years, growth was ac
commodated by the public institutions,
namely the [University of California
schools], but given the state dilemma
over finances I don't think we're going
to see tremendous expansion of the
state system," Hennessy said. "So I
feel there's some obligation [on] the
private institutions to step forward and
see what they can do."

More faculty, internationals
An expansion in the undergraduate
population may ultimately prove bene
ficial for graduate programs as well,
with more undergraduates necessitat
ing the hiring of additional faculty
members.
"Graduate enrollment expands
keeping pace with faculty growth, be
cause as new faculty come in, we have a
certain number of doctoral students
that we can anticipate," Gumport said.
"As we grow the undergraduate enroll
ment at whatever pace the President
deems appropriate, it's likely that there
will be some faculty growth, and with
faculty growth there could be some
grad student growth."
However, Hennessy noted that the
faculty population would likely not grow
at the same rate as the undergraduate
population. He added that the University
is not looking to add faculty in all areas.
"Exactly how much the faculty would
grow by depends on a lot of issues," Hen
nessy said. "It's varied up and down over
time. There's been a lot more faculty
growth over the last 30 years than there
has been undergraduate growth."
Approximately seven percent of un
dergraduates are international students,
while a third of graduate students come
to Stanford from abroad, a difference
