Although many college
football programs have recent
ly incurred heavy financial
losses due to bowl game partic
ipation, the Stanford athletics
department has seen both an
increase in season-ticket re
newals and national profile in
the aftermath of the 2013 Rose
Bowl.
On Feb. 8, the first day that
previous season-ticket holders
could request seats for the 2013
season, 1,048 seats were re
newed, compared to 776 on the
same day a year ago an in
crease of 35 percent and 572
in 2011. As of Feb. 14, 2,586 of
25,500 season tickets had been
renewed with almost two
months remaining before the
April 8 deadline.
In recent seasons, football
programs across the country
have reported millions of dol
lars in losses based on bowl
participation. The Virginia
Tech reportedly lost $1.6 mil
lion in the 2011 Orange Bowl
and $2.2 million on the 2009 Or
ange Bowl, the University of
Connecticut reportedly lost
close to $l.B million for playing
in the 2011 Fiesta Bowl and
even Alabama, the 2010 nation
al champions, reported a $l.B
million loss after the 2010 title
game.
As a private institution,
Stanford is not required to re
lease its full financial informa
tion, but Stanford administra
tors said that the athletic de
partment met its goal of break
ing even on its trip to the 2013
Rose Bowl and is currently
reaping the benefits of the in
creased exposure.
"The bowl game is not a
money-making enterprise for
the schools participating," said
Mike Eubanks '97 M.A. 'Ol, as
sistant athletic director and di
rector of football administra
tion. "If you are the CFO of
Stanford athletics, the goal is
to be able to meet all of the pro
gram's and the university's
needs at the bowl game, have
the best possible experience
and to do that while balancing
the budget."
The Pac-12 conference pro
vides the league's Rose Bowl
representative with a fixed
budget of $1.5 million to cover
the costs of transporting, hous

ing and feeding the university's
contingent of players, coaches,
cheerleaders, band members,
administrators and staff.
"Everything we wanted to
do every car that has to be
driven between functions down
there, every bus trip that the
team has to make, every meal
that we eat, every decoration
that is provided all of those
things cost real dollars," Eu
banks said.
According to the athletic
department, Stanford man
aged their expenses effectively,
covering all operating costs
within the budget provided by
the Rose Bowl.
"One way we save money is
that we try to operate as effi
ciently as possible from a
staffing perspective," said
Kevin Blue 'O5, the associate
athletic director for business
strategy. "Other institutions
make different decisions about
how many staff they feel are
needed to work to support the
operation."
In 2009, Stanford made its
first bowl appearance in eight
years at the Sun Bowl. The
Cardinal has qualified for a
BCS bowl in each of the three
seasons since, which Eubanks
said taught the department a
lot about how to run an effi
cient bowl operation.
"What we learned from our
planning and our budgeting
process helped us go in and re
ally avoid the surprises," Eu
banks said. "We understood
what was going to pop up and
did a great job of trying to keep
everything at a zero balanced
budget."
Stanford also avoided sig
nificant losses due to high de
mand for tickets. Bowl partici
pants are contractually obligat
ed to purchase a block of tick
ets and try to sell them to their
fans. Many schools report that
the majority of their losses
come from absorbing the costs
of unsold tickets.
For the 2013 Rose Bowl,
Stanford fans bought all of the
30,193 tickets allocated to Stan
ford in less than 24 hours. The
athletic department ultimately
acquired and sold approxi
mately 8,000 more tickets.
However, Stanford did not
earn supplemental revenue
from selling additional tickets,
since all ticket income goes
back to the bowl organizers.
"The revenue from those
