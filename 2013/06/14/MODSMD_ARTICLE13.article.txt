Although many college
football programs have recent
ly incurred heavy financial
losses due to bowl game partic
ipation, the Stanford athletics
department has seen both an
increase in season-ticket re
newals and national profile in
the aftermath of the 2013 Rose
Bowl.
On Feb. 8, the first day that
previous season-ticket holders
could request seats for the 2013
season, 1,048 seats were re
newed, compared to 776 on the
same day a year ago an in
crease of 35 percent and 572
in 2011. As of Feb. 14, 2,586 of
25,500 season tickets had been
renewed with almost two
months remaining before the
April 8 deadline.
In recent seasons, football
programs across the country
have reported millions of dol
lars in losses based on bowl
participation. The Virginia
Tech reportedly lost $1.6 mil
lion in the 2011 Orange Bowl
and $2.2 million on the 2009 Or
ange Bowl, the University of
Connecticut reportedly lost
close to $l.B million for playing
in the 2011 Fiesta Bowl and
even Alabama, the 2010 nation
al champions, reported a $l.B
million loss after the 2010 title
game.
As a private institution,
Stanford is not required to re
lease its full financial informa
tion, but Stanford administra
tors said that the athletic de
partment met its goal of break
ing even on its trip to the 2013
Rose Bowl and is currently
reaping the benefits of the in
creased exposure.
"The bowl game is not a
money-making enterprise for
the schools participating," said
Mike Eubanks '97 M.A. 'Ol, as
sistant athletic director and di
rector of football administra
tion. "If you are the CFO of
Stanford athletics, the goal is
to be able to meet all of the pro
gram's and the university's
needs at the bowl game, have
the best possible experience
and to do that while balancing
the budget."
The Pac-12 conference pro
vides the league's Rose Bowl
representative with a fixed
budget of $1.5 million to cover
the costs of transporting, hous

ing and feeding the university's
contingent of players, coaches,
cheerleaders, band members,
administrators and staff.
"Everything we wanted to
do every car that has to be
driven between functions down
there, every bus trip that the
team has to make, every meal
that we eat, every decoration
that is provided all of those
things cost real dollars," Eu
banks said.
According to the athletic
department, Stanford man
aged their expenses effectively,
covering all operating costs
within the budget provided by
the Rose Bowl.
"One way we save money is
that we try to operate as effi
ciently as possible from a
staffing perspective," said
Kevin Blue 'O5, the associate
athletic director for business
strategy. "Other institutions
make different decisions about
how many staff they feel are
needed to work to support the
operation."
In 2009, Stanford made its
first bowl appearance in eight
years at the Sun Bowl. The
Cardinal has qualified for a
BCS bowl in each of the three
seasons since, which Eubanks
said taught the department a
lot about how to run an effi
cient bowl operation.
"What we learned from our
planning and our budgeting
process helped us go in and re
ally avoid the surprises," Eu
banks said. "We understood
what was going to pop up and
did a great job of trying to keep
everything at a zero balanced
budget."
Stanford also avoided sig
nificant losses due to high de
mand for tickets. Bowl partici
pants are contractually obligat
ed to purchase a block of tick
ets and try to sell them to their
fans. Many schools report that
the majority of their losses
come from absorbing the costs
of unsold tickets.
For the 2013 Rose Bowl,
Stanford fans bought all of the
30,193 tickets allocated to Stan
ford in less than 24 hours. The
athletic department ultimately
acquired and sold approxi
mately 8,000 more tickets.
However, Stanford did not
earn supplemental revenue
from selling additional tickets,
since all ticket income goes
back to the bowl organizers.
"The revenue from those
tickets went to the Rose Bowl," Eu
banks said. "We were selling the
Rose Bowl's tickets and providing
an additional service to our fans, our
alumni and our students by being
able to meet their demand and so
that they would be able to sit in
Stanford's section."
According to Roger Noll, a pro
fessor emeritus of economics who
has done research on the economics
of intercollegiate athletics, there is
very little direct financial incentive
for schools to participate in bowl
games, with most benefits emerging
only over time.
"Schools expect that it will in
crease ticket sales for the next year
and that it will increase then- ability
to recruit," Noll said. "The hope is
that the publicity associated with it
will be helpful."
University officials said that,
while the monetary impact can be
hard to quantify, winning the Rose
Bowl certainly created excitement
among the fan base and likely
prompted a more active donor base.
"There's no question that the fi
nancial support [from alumni and
donors] that the athletic department
and the university receives is stirred
up by Stanford playing in and win
ning the Rose Bowl game," Eu
banks said. "People are excited and
want to reward a job that is well
done, and there can be no job that is
done better than winning a Rose
Bowl."
Noll said that for schools that
have built their reputation on strong
academics, the benefits of increased
exposure are likely less than they
would otherwise be.
"Stanford is not exactly your
standard football factory," Noll said.
"For schools like Stanford, North
western and Duke, which have high

quality undergraduates and many
times as many applicants as they
have students, there's not a whole
lot of additional publicity value be
cause that's not the main reason to
go there."

According to Jon Denney 'B5,
senior associate vice president for
development, it is difficult to link in
creased giving to any specific event.
He noted, however, that the success
of the football program can help
alumni feel more connected and en
gaged with the university.
The athletic department also ex
pressed optimism that the Rose
Bowl win will lead to increased inter
est in the football team next season.
Last season, Stanford's average at
tendance for home games was 43,343
people worse than that of all Pac
-12 teams except Washington State.
Besides increased interest in sea
son ticket renewals, the athletic de
partment reported high interest in
new season-ticket sales as well.
According to Blue, the university
had received deposits for 1,256 new
season ticket accounts as of Feb. 14.
The athletic department reports
that on average, each account pur
chases 2.7 seats, which means that
Stanford has already seen interest
in close to 3,200 new season-ticket
holders with seven months to go be
fore the season starts.
"Those signs, although very, very
early and nascent, are pointing in a
very positive direction for what 2013
ticket sales and attendance will be,"
Eubanks said. "That will have a sig
nificant financial impact on us."
"Winning the Pac-12 champi
onship and playing the Rose Bowl
and winning the Rose Bowl game
has a direct impact on fan interest,"
Eubanks said. "There is no doubt
that the excitement and level of in
terest leading into the 2013 season is
heightened as a result of playing in
and winning the Rose Bowl."

Although many college
football programs have recent
ly incurred heavy financial
losses due to bowl game partic
ipation, the Stanford athletics
department has seen both an
increase in season-ticket re
newals and national profile in
the aftermath of the 2013 Rose
Bowl.
On Feb. 8, the first day that
previous season-ticket holders
could request seats for the 2013
season, 1,048 seats were re
newed, compared to 776 on the
same day a year ago an in
crease of 35 percent and 572
in 2011. As of Feb. 14, 2,586 of
25,500 season tickets had been
renewed with almost two
months remaining before the
April 8 deadline.
In recent seasons, football
programs across the country
have reported millions of dol
lars in losses based on bowl
participation. The Virginia
Tech reportedly lost $1.6 mil
lion in the 2011 Orange Bowl
and $2.2 million on the 2009 Or
ange Bowl, the University of
Connecticut reportedly lost
close to $l.B million for playing
in the 2011 Fiesta Bowl and
even Alabama, the 2010 nation
al champions, reported a $l.B
million loss after the 2010 title
game.
As a private institution,
Stanford is not required to re
lease its full financial informa
tion, but Stanford administra
tors said that the athletic de
partment met its goal of break
ing even on its trip to the 2013
Rose Bowl and is currently
reaping the benefits of the in
creased exposure.
"The bowl game is not a
money-making enterprise for
the schools participating," said
Mike Eubanks '97 M.A. 'Ol, as
sistant athletic director and di
rector of football administra
tion. "If you are the CFO of
Stanford athletics, the goal is
to be able to meet all of the pro
gram's and the university's
needs at the bowl game, have
the best possible experience
and to do that while balancing
the budget."
The Pac-12 conference pro
vides the league's Rose Bowl
representative with a fixed
budget of $1.5 million to cover
the costs of transporting, hous

ing and feeding the university's
contingent of players, coaches,
cheerleaders, band members,
administrators and staff.
"Everything we wanted to
do every car that has to be
driven between functions down
there, every bus trip that the
team has to make, every meal
that we eat, every decoration
that is provided all of those
things cost real dollars," Eu
banks said.
According to the athletic
department, Stanford man
aged their expenses effectively,
covering all operating costs
within the budget provided by
the Rose Bowl.
"One way we save money is
that we try to operate as effi
ciently as possible from a
staffing perspective," said
Kevin Blue 'O5, the associate
athletic director for business
strategy. "Other institutions
make different decisions about
how many staff they feel are
needed to work to support the
operation."
In 2009, Stanford made its
first bowl appearance in eight
years at the Sun Bowl. The
Cardinal has qualified for a
BCS bowl in each of the three
seasons since, which Eubanks
said taught the department a
lot about how to run an effi
cient bowl operation.
"What we learned from our
planning and our budgeting
process helped us go in and re
ally avoid the surprises," Eu
banks said. "We understood
what was going to pop up and
did a great job of trying to keep
everything at a zero balanced
budget."
Stanford also avoided sig
nificant losses due to high de
mand for tickets. Bowl partici
pants are contractually obligat
ed to purchase a block of tick
ets and try to sell them to their
fans. Many schools report that
the majority of their losses
come from absorbing the costs
of unsold tickets.
For the 2013 Rose Bowl,
Stanford fans bought all of the
30,193 tickets allocated to Stan
ford in less than 24 hours. The
athletic department ultimately
acquired and sold approxi
mately 8,000 more tickets.
However, Stanford did not
earn supplemental revenue
from selling additional tickets,
since all ticket income goes
back to the bowl organizers.
"The revenue from those
tickets went to the Rose Bowl," Eu
banks said. "We were selling the
Rose Bowl's tickets and providing
an additional service to our fans, our
alumni and our students by being
able to meet their demand and so
that they would be able to sit in
Stanford's section."
According to Roger Noll, a pro
fessor emeritus of economics who
has done research on the economics
of intercollegiate athletics, there is
very little direct financial incentive
for schools to participate in bowl
games, with most benefits emerging
only over time.
"Schools expect that it will in
crease ticket sales for the next year
and that it will increase then- ability
to recruit," Noll said. "The hope is
that the publicity associated with it
will be helpful."
University officials said that,
while the monetary impact can be
hard to quantify, winning the Rose
Bowl certainly created excitement
among the fan base and likely
prompted a more active donor base.
"There's no question that the fi
nancial support [from alumni and
donors] that the athletic department
and the university receives is stirred
up by Stanford playing in and win
ning the Rose Bowl game," Eu
banks said. "People are excited and
want to reward a job that is well
done, and there can be no job that is
done better than winning a Rose
Bowl."
Noll said that for schools that
have built their reputation on strong
academics, the benefits of increased
exposure are likely less than they
would otherwise be.
"Stanford is not exactly your
standard football factory," Noll said.
"For schools like Stanford, North
western and Duke, which have high

quality undergraduates and many
times as many applicants as they
have students, there's not a whole
lot of additional publicity value be
cause that's not the main reason to
go there."

According to Jon Denney 'B5,
senior associate vice president for
development, it is difficult to link in
creased giving to any specific event.
He noted, however, that the success
of the football program can help
alumni feel more connected and en
gaged with the university.
The athletic department also ex
pressed optimism that the Rose
Bowl win will lead to increased inter
est in the football team next season.
Last season, Stanford's average at
tendance for home games was 43,343
people worse than that of all Pac
-12 teams except Washington State.
Besides increased interest in sea
son ticket renewals, the athletic de
partment reported high interest in
new season-ticket sales as well.
According to Blue, the university
had received deposits for 1,256 new
season ticket accounts as of Feb. 14.
The athletic department reports
that on average, each account pur
chases 2.7 seats, which means that
Stanford has already seen interest
in close to 3,200 new season-ticket
holders with seven months to go be
fore the season starts.
"Those signs, although very, very
early and nascent, are pointing in a
very positive direction for what 2013
ticket sales and attendance will be,"
Eubanks said. "That will have a sig
nificant financial impact on us."
"Winning the Pac-12 champi
