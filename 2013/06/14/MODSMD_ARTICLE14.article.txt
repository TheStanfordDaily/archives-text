## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Editor's Farewell: No Regret 
### Miles Bennett Smith 
Stanford students do it all. Over
the last four years I've seen
classmates win Rhodes Schol
arships, secure grants to study all
around the world, compose amazing
symphonies, score game-winning
goals you name it, we've probably
done it.
Of course, we've also come up
short. We push failure aside and dis
guise it as delayed success and give it
silly names like Duck Syndrome and
hope it goes away. But that does not
change the fact that at some point,
we don't quite cut it. Stanford is a
place with so much success, failure
stands out like a sore thumb, except
that it doesn't. Maybe it does when a
sports team loses or a publication
prints the wrong date on the front
cover of an issue (sorry). More of
ten, however, it is private a mo
ment alone in the dorm room, a quick
cry outside a classroom, and those
moments are as common as a sunny
day on the Oval.
Then we pick ourselves up and go
right back to being awesome and po
sitioning ourselves to be the bright
est minds in science and medicine
and politics and computer science
and literature and athletics. We go to
Senior Dinner on the Quad and
watch the sun rise over The Dish and
hit the golf course and tell our friends
how much we love them and how
much we'll miss them.
But the feelings of failure still
linger, at least they do for me. Maybe
it's due to the inevitable nostalgia
every senior feels this time of year,
but I can't help thinking back to the
moments when I was at my weakest
and reliving the disappointment and
doubt, and worst of all, the regret.
Even if just for a moment or two, I
cast away the memories of four glori
ous, privileged years at Stanford and
think about all the things I didn't do
and could have done and should have
done.
I should have spent more time
with my friends, I should have studied
harder, I should have partied harder, I
should have volunteered more, I
should have double-majored, I should
have joined more clubs, I should have
gone outside my comfort level, I
should have watched more football
games, I should have been more of an
activist.
If you have been running down
that list in your head, stop. Turn off
your brain.
It is important to learn from our
mistakes being given the license
to fail is without question one of the
greatest things about being a stu
dent. But success is so much more
than checking off the most boxes and
joining the most clubs and having the
longest resume.
This past volume has been one of
the greatest experiences of my life. I
have had the extreme honor and
privilege of reporting the news from

a campus that for me rivals Disney
land as the happiest place on earth.
From Suites to Judicial Affairs to Ja
son Collins, The Daily has tried to in
form and educate you, our readers,
and we have unquestionably experi
enced miles of personal growth as ed
itors and writers.
As The Daily positions itself to
grow and innovate and compete in an
ever-evolving media landscape,
every editor dreams of being the one
who brought the paper into the light
and prays nightly they aren't the one
to screw it all up I am no different.
After five months, though, I've got a
laundry list of regrets. I should have
been a more careful editor, a better
mentor, a more successful recruiter.
However, I think there's way too
much to be done in this community
and on this planet to spend our lives
thinking about how much we haven't
yet accomplished. I hope that by re
flecting on the things I "should" have
done at Stanford I can open my mind
up to new experiences and improve
myself in many ways, and I hope that
we all can study history so that we do
not repeat the mistakes of the past.
But why be bogged down in fail
ure when this campus is filled with
examples of progress and achieve
ment?
We've got miles to go before we
sleep, but there are kernels of im
provement on so many different
fronts that I have every confidence
we will cultivate.
I hope that you see The Daily as a
vehicle for some of this growth, and
at least recognize its role as an ob
server and reporter on campus. It
goes without saying that the next set
of editors will continue to do bigger
and better things. But it's on you, the
community, to give them the feed
back you have given me and to con
tinue your advocacy for the op
pressed and to dream big and not to
let failure slow you down.
The only thing worse than being
an old man filled with regret, waiting
to die alone, would be being an old
man, filled with regret about being
filled with regret, waiting to die alone
(take that, DiCaprio).
It has been an absolute pleasure
to serve this community and this or
ganization for the past volume.
Thank you all from the bottom of my
heart.

Sincerely,

and literature and athletics. We go to
Senior Dinner on the Quad and
watch the sun rise over The Dish and
hit the golf course and tell our friends
how much we love them and how
much we'll miss them.
But the feelings of failure still
linger, at least they do for me. Maybe
it's due to the inevitable nostalgia
every senior feels this time of year,
but I can't help thinking back to the
moments when I was at my weakest
and reliving the disappointment and
doubt, and worst of all, the regret.
Even if just for a moment or two, I
cast away the memories of four glori
ous, privileged years at Stanford and
think about all the things I didn't do
and could have done and should have
done.
I should have spent more time
with my friends, I should have studied
harder, I should have partied harder, I
should have volunteered more, I
should have double-majored, I should
have joined more clubs, I should have
gone outside my comfort level, I
should have watched more football
games, I should have been more of an
activist.
If you have been running down
that list in your head, stop. Turn off
your brain.
It is important to learn from our
mistakes being given the license
to fail is without question one of the
greatest things about being a stu
dent. But success is so much more
than checking off the most boxes and
joining the most clubs and having the
longest resume.
This past volume has been one of
the greatest experiences of my life. I
have had the extreme honor and
privilege of reporting the news from

a campus that for me rivals Disney
land as the happiest place on earth.
From Suites to Judicial Affairs to Ja
son Collins, The Daily has tried to in
form and educate you, our readers,
and we have unquestionably experi
enced miles of personal growth as ed
itors and writers.
As The Daily positions itself to
grow and innovate and compete in an
ever-evolving media landscape,
every editor dreams of being the one
who brought the paper into the light
and prays nightly they aren't the one
to screw it all up I am no different.
After five months, though, I've got a
laundry list of regrets. I should have
been a more careful editor, a better
mentor, a more successful recruiter.
However, I think there's way too
much to be done in this community
and on this planet to spend our lives
thinking about how much we haven't
yet accomplished. I hope that by re
flecting on the things I "should" have
done at Stanford I can open my mind
up to new experiences and improve
myself in many ways, and I hope that
we all can study history so that we do
not repeat the mistakes of the past.
But why be bogged down in fail
ure when this campus is filled with
examples of progress and achieve
ment?
We've got miles to go before we
sleep, but there are kernels of im
provement on so many different
fronts that I have every confidence
we will cultivate.
I hope that you see The Daily as a
vehicle for some of this growth, and
at least recognize its role as an ob
server and reporter on campus. It
goes without saying that the next set
of editors will continue to do bigger
and better things. But it's on you, the
community, to give them the feed
back you have given me and to con
tinue your advocacy for the op
pressed and to dream big and not to
let failure slow you down.
The only thing worse than being
an old man filled with regret, waiting
to die alone, would be being an old
man, filled with regret about being
filled with regret, waiting to die alone
(take that, DiCaprio).
It has been an absolute pleasure
to serve this community and this or
ganization for the past volume.
Thank you all from the bottom of my
heart.

Sincerely,

MILES BENNETT-SMITH
President and Editor in Chief,
Vol CCXLII
