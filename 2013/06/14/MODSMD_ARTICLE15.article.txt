# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## To the Class of 2016

It has become traditional for
Daily columnists to offer each
year's incoming freshman class
a bit of advice accumulated from
the wisdom that flows from time
and experience. I'm not going to do
that.
I'm not going to do that because
time and experience have taught
me that failure forges us into
stronger thinkers, citizens and
friends. It is struggle, not success,
that reveals and changes for the
better who we are. So I'm not
going to help you avoid it.
Because even if I wanted to, I
couldn't. The only people who don't
make mistakes at Stanford are the
people working in the admissions
office at 355 Galvez Street. As
much as you may get wrong, always
remember this: they got you right.
They got you right. That will be
easy to remember this week, and
easy to forget by the end of the year.
Never lose sight of where you came
from and who you are - the person
you'll be during the sun and new
friends and pageantry of NSO, the
person who worked hard for four
years to get here, the person who
shone and stood out and impressed -
no matter what happens in Chem 33
or Math 51 or the Hum√üio Core.
But don't be afraid to leave that
person behind either. Don't be
afraid to be uncomfortable. Don't
fear the transformation that comes
with defeat.

That's part of why we're here at
The Daily's new Opinions section.
We are proud to represent, to listen
and, yes, to challenge you - espe
cially as you learn and change in
the crucible that is this place we call
home together.
In this space over the coming
weeks, you'll see columns and edito
rials on student mental health, on
campus culture and politics, on the
November election, on sexuality and
art and the environment. You'll see
columns you love, columns you pro
foundly disagree with, columns you
can't stand and, if we do our job well,
columns that inspire or change you.
But whatever you read in this
space, know this: we will not take
our job for granted.
Early last week, rioters burned
down the Libyan consulate in
Benghazi, taking the lives of four
American diplomats, including Am
bassador Chris Stevens. The osten
sible cause: an amateur film mock
ing the Prophet Muhammad.
The tragic deaths underscore
the importance of both our rights
and responsibilities as journalists -
rights and responsibilities we take

seriously. We at The Stanford Dai
ly are proud to defend the right to
free speech - a right not granted or
understood in many parts of the
world. We are also committed to
exercising that right fairly, re
spectfully and with the force of
reason, logic and intellectual rigor.
Along the way, we, like you, will
make mistakes. We, like you, will
seek to learn from them. And we,
like you, will grow and change.

In short, we are your paper, and
this is your Opinions section. Like
you, we will always do our very
best. When we fall short, we ex
pect you to hold us accountable -
via op-eds, emails, or letters to the
editor. And we will remain commit
ted to our core principles - rational
argument, respectful debate and
fair dialogue even as we adapt
to the changing reality of campus
culture and the world around us.
Welcome to campus. We look
forward to working with you.
