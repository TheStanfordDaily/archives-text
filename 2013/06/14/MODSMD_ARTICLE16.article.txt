# LETTER FROM THE EXECUTIVE EDITOR
## Leading The Daily 
### 
Originally published on Feb. 1,

After working over 40 hours a
week for a year, the outgoing
editors of The Daily get a
chance to speak frankly to their
readers. I'm going to tell you things
I learned after working here full
time, interviewing countless stu
dents, administrators and mem
bers of this community.
I disagree with this campus's
definition of activism. Events are
held with the same attendees, focus
ing on issues that most of Stanford
can't begin to relate to or affect. I
think discussion of radical issues is
important and useful, but it must be
coupled with coalition building and
direct action. Student leaders should
motivate action, broaden their base
and appeal to the undecided. An ac
tivist's most important job is to avoid
the danger of echo chambers.
I recognize there is no Vietnam
War now the issues are hazier, the
solutions unclear. But the issues ex
ist, both internationally and locally
here at Stanford, and we're ignoring
them.
Instead of divestment from Is
rael, why don't we start by demand
ing Stanford make its financial in
vestments as transparent as a public
university, so we can see where our
money is being spent? This would be
better and more popular than focus
ing on Israel and Palestine, an in
tractable conflict that we have no
control over and that polarizes our
student body.
Instead of protesting the
ROTC, which only a handful of stu
dents attend, why don't we take in
terest in the hundreds of layoffs of
minimum-wage workers at this uni
versity? Or take a look at why East
Palo Alto has seen two murders so
far in 2013, while across the high
way, Palo Alto rarely gets more
than two in an entire year?
Or we can focus our energy clos
er to home. In five years, without a

major student movement, the Row
will no longer have a house-based
dining structure. Administrators
have called it "cost-inefficient," a bu
reaucratic kiss of death, and serious
plans for a dining hall on the Row
have already been floated at meet
ings. It's only a matter of time now.
We don't need to look to the fu
ture for the issues, however an
indefensible revocation of Chi
Theta Chi's lease and a bad-faith
negotiation on the part of Universi
ty administrators, Suites losing its
decades-long tradition of student
run dining, a food truck that do
nates its profits to charity being
forced to leave by a letter from the
police, $5.5 million worth of un
wanted ID scanners on the Row, a
larger police presence concerned
with alcohol and a bulky and grow
ing bureaucracy dedicated to mak
ing sure Stanford's image remains
carefully manicured. These are all
things worth taking action over.
The traditional lines of defense
for student freedoms are eroding.
The Daily is increasingly hand
cuffed by an unresponsive, better
funded and obstructionist adminis
tration that doesn't respect the val
ue of an independent student press,
and we hold no legal recourses sim
ilar to those available at public in
stitutions. The activists rarely seek
to mobilize about issues that affect
students here, the alumni care but
don't have the time to learn every
detail and our student government
is plagued by internal inefficiency
and lack of student respect.
And at the same time there are
parts of this University namely
Housing and Dining, under Resi
dential & Dining Enterprises
(R&DE) —that are dedicated to
removing student freedom and
squeezing more profit from your
beds and your meals. Those who ac
tively oppose it most of whom
are not reporters, co-op residents
or leftists, but rather just students
who enjoy being treated like adults
are tiring, and we are losing.
I tell you all of this because

soon, you will hear something that
will make you angry. Perhaps you'll
read it in our pages or hear about it
from a friend. It will remind you of
how students are being infantilized
more and more, treated like board
ers rather than residents, fed on as
sembly lines because it is more effi
cient and faced with more arbitrary
restrictions placed on our resi
dences. And you will have a choice
to make.
If you choose to ignore it, to say
that Stanford is good enough and
doesn't need to be perfect, that peo
ple complaining are just whining
if you rationalize rather than react,
then it will continue to happen.
But whether or not you identify
as an activist, if you believe what
I've said here and you think it's im
portant, you must take action.
Email administrators about issues
you care about, write op-eds in The
Daily's pages, visit administrators'
offices and ask your friends to do
the same. Disrupt something. In
convenience someone. I want you to
take a stand on an issue any is
sue and don't budge until you
are satisfied. I want you to believe
that this University is governed
with your consent, that there are
those in this administration who
still care what students have to say.
You can make a difference in your
four years here.
We've been getting our asses
kicked for the past few years, and
we will probably end up on the los
ing side of this fight. We're out
gunned and outmatched. But if
parts of Stanford want to systemat
ically revoke the power of student
voices and implement bureaucracy
where student-led initiative once
stood, we should make it miserable
for them and give them hell every
step of the way.

It's been fun editing here. Thanks
for reading.

The Daily is increasingly hand
cuffed by an unresponsive, better
funded and obstructionist adminis

to mobilize about issues that affect
students here, the alumni care but
don't have the time to learn every
detail and our student government
is plagued by internal inefficiency
and lack of student respect.
And at the same time there are
parts of this University namely
Housing and Dining, under Resi

(R&DE) —that are dedicated to

are not reporters, co-op residents

who enjoy being treated like adults
are tiring, and we are losing.
I tell you all of this because

soon, you will hear something that
will make you angry. Perhaps you'll
read it in our pages or hear about it
from a friend. It will remind you of
how students are being infantilized
more and more, treated like board
ers rather than residents, fed on as
sembly lines because it is more effi

restrictions placed on our resi

to make.
If you choose to ignore it, to say
that Stanford is good enough and
doesn't need to be perfect, that peo

if you rationalize rather than react,
then it will continue to happen.
But whether or not you identify
as an activist, if you believe what
I've said here and you think it's im
portant, you must take action.
Email administrators about issues
you care about, write op-eds in The
Daily's pages, visit administrators'
offices and ask your friends to do
the same. Disrupt something. In
convenience someone. I want you to
take a stand on an issue any is
sue and don't budge until you
are satisfied. I want you to believe
that this University is governed
with your consent, that there are
those in this administration who
still care what students have to say.
You can make a difference in your
four years here.
We've been getting our asses
kicked for the past few years, and
we will probably end up on the los
ing side of this fight. We're out
gunned and outmatched. But if
parts of Stanford want to systemat
ically revoke the power of student
voices and implement bureaucracy
where student-led initiative once
stood, we should make it miserable
for them and give them hell every
step of the way.

It's been fun editing here. Thanks

After working over 40 hours a
week for a year, the outgoing
editors of The Daily get a
chance to speak frankly to their
readers. I'm going to tell you things
I learned after working here full
time, interviewing countless stu
dents, administrators and mem
bers of this community.
I disagree with this campus's
definition of activism. Events are
held with the same attendees, focus
ing on issues that most of Stanford
can't begin to relate to or affect. I
think discussion of radical issues is
important and useful, but it must be
coupled with coalition building and
direct action. Student leaders should
motivate action, broaden their base
and appeal to the undecided. An ac
tivist's most important job is to avoid
the danger of echo chambers.
I recognize there is no Vietnam
War now the issues are hazier, the
solutions unclear. But the issues ex
ist, both internationally and locally
here at Stanford, and we're ignoring
them.
Instead of divestment from Is
rael, why don't we start by demand
ing Stanford make its financial in
vestments as transparent as a public
university, so we can see where our
money is being spent? This would be
better and more popular than focus
ing on Israel and Palestine, an in
tractable conflict that we have no
control over and that polarizes our
student body.
Instead of protesting the
ROTC, which only a handful of stu
dents attend, why don't we take in
terest in the hundreds of layoffs of
minimum-wage workers at this uni
versity? Or take a look at why East
Palo Alto has seen two murders so
far in 2013, while across the high
way, Palo Alto rarely gets more
than two in an entire year?
Or we can focus our energy clos
er to home. In five years, without a

major student movement, the Row
will no longer have a house-based
dining structure. Administrators
have called it "cost-inefficient," a bu
reaucratic kiss of death, and serious
plans for a dining hall on the Row
have already been floated at meet
ings. It's only a matter of time now.
We don't need to look to the fu
ture for the issues, however an
indefensible revocation of Chi
Theta Chi's lease and a bad-faith
negotiation on the part of Universi
ty administrators, Suites losing its
decades-long tradition of student
run dining, a food truck that do
nates its profits to charity being
forced to leave by a letter from the
police, $5.5 million worth of un
wanted ID scanners on the Row, a
larger police presence concerned
with alcohol and a bulky and grow
ing bureaucracy dedicated to mak
ing sure Stanford's image remains
carefully manicured. These are all
things worth taking action over.
The traditional lines of defense
for student freedoms are eroding.
The Daily is increasingly hand
