# Editor's farewell: This is your school

Originally published on Feb. 1,

This is my final day as president
and editor in chief of The Stan
ford Daily. It has been an hon
or to serve this community.
Many editors have used this
farewell letter to talk about how
great their time as editor has been
and how much they will miss it (let's
be honest, it is pretty awesome).
Today, I must use this space for
something more important.
Last fall, President Hennessy
quoted Steve Jobs' famous 2005
commencement address in his con
vocation to the Class of 2016.
"Don't let the noise of others'
opinions drown out your own
inner voice. And most impor
tant, have the courage to follow
your heart and intuition."
Hennessy went on to tell the new
class that their undergraduate edu
cation would serve as a foundation
for their lives and that Stanford ex
pected them each to become "an en
thusiastic member of this academic
community."
But how often are we encouraged
to decide what we want the Stanford
community to become? And if our in
ner voice is critical of the current
community, will Stanford still listen?
Students are encouraged by their
professors to critically examine the
world and work to maximize their po
tential and positively impact their
community.
But outside of the classroom, the
situation changes drastically. Now, lit

tie Stanford student, you aren't sup
posed to say a single negative word
about your Stanford experience.
This is Stanford. We are all ge
niuses who bathe in the sun, rip
shots while coding, smoke while ana
lyzing Chaucer, roll out of bed late
and crush the McKinsey interview
and get a nice night's sleep before
doing it again. And we're all happy.
There aren't problems with men
tal health stigmas on campus,
brought sharply into focus by stu
dent suicides last spring. Students
shouldn't be concerned about the au
tonomy and direction of student
housing, particularly in row houses
and Suites. Students shouldn't be
concerned about the current state of
sexual assault on campus, nor the
few protections the Alternative Re
view Process affords the accused.
Critically analyze your reading,
not the quality of your Stanford ex
perience.
Indeed, there are, have been and
always will be problems.
Students are attempting suicide.
Students are sexually assaulting oth
er students. Do you know how many?
Do you know if the numbers are go
ing up or down? Do you know what's
being done to address either issue?
No. We've failed you as journal
ists. Your university has failed you.
We've failed each other as community
members.
The culture of silence at Stanford
has gotten out of hand, and no one
has noticed. Stanford has become so
obsessed with a perfectly manicured
image that it sweeps very real issues
under the rug.
I guess "have open, honest dis
cussions about depression across
campus" doesn't look as good as

a palm tree on an admissions
brochure.
Of course we need to respect pri
vacy. But that's why the University
can provide statistics that protect peo
ple's identity and that's why journal
ists hold anonymity so sacredly
We worked to overcome this si
lence by banning email interviews this
fall, which the University has abused
to replace quotes with press release
sound bites. The pushback from
many, all purportedly tasked with
serving the students and the commu
nity, was frankly unbelievable.
Some administrators have been
great. The student body is very
lucky to have a Vice Provost of Stu
dent Affairs, Greg Boardman, who
strongly supports the autonomy of
the student press.
Others have been offensively use
less. Residential and Dining Enter
prises (R&DE) exists to serve stu
dents and the Stanford community
unless that involves talking to the
most-read student publication, of
course. We've had interview request
after request declined, only to be
told that we'll receive an emailed
statement that is often barely rele
vant and praises R&DE no matter
what the situation.
I can't even count how many
meetings I've had with Stanford ad
ministrators to discuss why they're
too busy to meet with our reporters.
I'm sick of administrators lying
to my face. I'm sick of being told we
can't have any numbers or informa
tion on suicide attempts, but being
given a press release, complete with
quotes from President Hennessy,
telling us how transformative it is
