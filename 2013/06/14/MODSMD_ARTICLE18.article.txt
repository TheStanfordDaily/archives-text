# SENIOR REFLECTIONS FROM DAILY STAFFERS

AADITYA SHIDHAM

In my last column, I would like to talk
to you about my experience during a
unique leave of absence I took at
Stanford. I left this university fall
quarter of my junior year to live in an
ashram in the Inner Sunset.
In my time off, I found out how to build
my willpower and stamina the same way an
athlete builds his/her muscle. I found true
value in regular menial work and found out
how strong I really was. And I made friends
with political refugees, convicts and the ter
minally ill friends I would never have
made in a university setting.
Yet the most important thing I learned in
my time off was the fact that my choices are
more important than my thoughts.
I imagine this premise a hard thing for
most of you to accept. When you spend your
lifetime as a student, defining yourself
through your thoughts, it becomes hard to
let that go as a part of your identity. Yet a
place that forces you onto yourself so explic
itly as an ashram makes clear that your spe
cialness is not in your thoughts or your cir
cumstance; it is in your ability to choose.
One of the most important rituals that I
remember from my time inside that cozy
blue building was morning meditation. We
would wake before dawn and in silence, we
would sit, eyes closed, focusing on nothing
but our breath for about 20 minutes. Medi
tation is too often described as a place of
calm and rest, when it in reality can be a
scary thing. It exposes you to the basement
of your identity, while most other activities
in our lives serve as distractions from this
place.
During this time, I saw thoughts for
what they were: flashes that came as quick
ly as they went, built on memory and stim
uli and stubbornness. This made me realize
that the human brain, for all its sophistica
tion, was simply an organ that responds to
the senses you provide it.
There is no doubt that thoughts are im
portant to the world we live in. However,
thought (along with circumstance) is just as
arbitrary as it is important. What really
matters is how we respond to our thoughts.
What matters is our choice to cultivate a
better inner world. This is because our in
ner world is the only truly human thing we
possess. We can choose the things we inter
nalize and the things we don't, and we can
consciously resist the urge to make our bi
ography our destiny.
I saw this truth reaffirmed over and over
again in the simple life I lived at the ashram.
Near the end of my stay, I found that one of
the women I had grown closest to had been
an alcoholic for most of her life. She
clenched her jaw and shut her eyes tightly
at the sight of alcohol and repeated to her
self the words: not this time. What I saw
in her was a robust inner world at work, a
world she created to magnify her ability to
choose.
Plutarch wrote that what we achieve in
wardly will change outer reality. All reli
gions support this fact on a cosmic level, yet

it is true in a much more humble, secular
sense, is it not? The items you choose to cul
tivate change your inner world. And this
changes everything else.

If there is one thing I can say to you, my
readers, it is to not rest on your laurels, on
your ability, or on your circumstance. Live
well by choosing well.
Thank you for your time, for your corre
spondence, and for reading.

I hate goodbyes.Goodbyes are so final;
the end of some happy phase of my
life, a farewell to people I might never
see again. So this isn't goodbye. I'm
not going to sit here and reminisce in
to my computer keyboard about already
fading memories of life on the Farm and at
The Stanford Daily. I also realize that there
is no way I could do justice to the legions of
quirky people I've shared my time here with
and the variety of experiences, both good
and bad, that have shaped my life over the
past decade a few hundred words isn't
even enough to scratch the surface.
No, instead even before I step out in
to the bright sunshine of Stanford Stadium
to make my departure official it's time to
look to the future. The past is the past and,
however much I might want to, I can nei
ther relive it nor change it.
In barely a month I'll be switching sides
of this country, trading in my West-Coast en
gineering Ph.D. for an East-Coast journal
ism M.S. Some parents reading this might be
a little horrified by that very thought, ricking
the guarantee of a secure income in science
and technology for the uncertainties of a life
in the straggling world of journalism. My
convoluted Stanford experience, though,
taught me the most important of all life les
sons: you only get one shot at this, so make it
a good one. Money won't buy you happiness
and you can't take it with you in the end.
I think my long-suffering family has
come to terms with the fact that this Stan
ford grad isn't going to be joining the bil
lionaire royalty of Silicon Valley anytime
soon. Don't ask me where I'll be in five
year's time, because I honestly don't know.
It's going to be fun getting there, though.
And that journey will be made all the
more special by my graduation gift from
Stanford: all of you.
I'll be back in the Bay Area soon because
I now have far too many reasons that mean
I have to come visit. I might be at the occa
sional road game too; next year's early sea
son football clash at West Point is going to
be pretty much in my new backyard and,
just in case, I've made sure my busy
schedule is free on Jan. 6,2014.
Even my route eastwards is now threat
ening to be a little circuitous. Los Angeles,
Houston and Chicago are all on the way,
right? And how far is Washington, D.C.

from New York? Any responsible journalist
wouldn't waste too much time in getting to
the bottom of those crucial questions. And
as for NYC itself, I'm looking forward to a
few cultural lessons from local guides.
No, this is not goodbye.

I've been told that being a writer
means writing when you don't want
to, which is why I decided to compose
this column now. Since I wrote last
week's as though it were my last, I in
tended on going out without another. I cer
tainly could have. An email from my editor,
though, felt like it was admonishing me to
write even though I didn't want to.
I am loath to write tonight not due to
profound sloth or running out of things to
say from my soapbox. Rather, I am sick like
I haven't been in years. Tuesday, when I
took my last final, I could already feel the
onset, but I had to stay up until 9 a.m.
Wednesday finishing another final
report. Consequently, Wednesday and
Thursday I was bedridden. I am so sick that
tonight I skipped senior dinner on the
quad. How could I? Aren't these events, if
not the point of the weekend, reflective of
the propinquity which is?
Much as I'd like to celebrate, my body
has had other plans. I always get sick near
the end of term, a phenomenon that I attrib
ute to vengeance: the frame punishing the
brain for ten weeks of abuse. This illness is
unique, though. Of course, it could just be
the Kwisatz Haderach of sicknesses, the fi
nal boss sent to wreck me after four years of
trial. That would be the comfortable expla
nation, though, and I want to explore this
further.

Last year, I returned from studying
abroad to watch friends graduate. That
week on campus was my most surreal yet,
and I've finally discerned why. The domi
nant narrative here is that this campus is
Zion. Beyond the compliments paid to stu
dents and researchers, Stanford is lauded
as the best possible place that you could be
spending your time, and you, 0 pilgrim,
should be grateful for your moments
here. Yet graduation events, more specifi
cally the unofficial ones with family and
friends, are evidence to the contrary. In fact,
you see thousands of people who, while glad
to see their children graduate from an ob
jectively fantastic institution (I'm not such a
malcontent), are themselves happy with
their lives elsewhere. They lead rich, fulfill
ing existences all over the world, and that
poisons the concept that this is the final des
tination. No wonder housing scuttles stu
dents out of their rooms on Friday morning.
The other reason that I feel sick, I sup
pose, is that I am not returning to the com
fort of this campus for at least another
year. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely
want to take a year off, to live in the world

with people of different ages and different
priorities and understand better the coun
tries that in our classrooms are often
naught more than abstract concepts. But,
my immune system, literally and figura
tively, is quite weak. I have spent the bet
ter part of four years in Northern Califor
nia's sterile environment, and I'm just
about ready to face the risks that the world
outside has to present. I hope that soon,
you are too.

Thank you for sticking it out with me this
year, and I look forward to seeing you all if
I return. If you've enjoyed my pieces, please

CAROLINE CASELLI

It was mostly due to chance that I
joined The Daily in the fall of 2008, in
the first weeks of my first quarter on
the Farm. One of my freshman dorm
staff members was an editor (shout
out to you, Emma Trotter), and I offhanded
ly mentioned to her once during NSO that I
might be interested in joining, whatever
that meant. She encouraged me to apply for
the new Frosh Fellows program, and at the
last minute (literally, the email is time
stamped 11:58 p.m.), I did.
I recently re-read that application, and
aside from some embarrassingly over-en
thusiastic prose, one quote from the "Why
this program?" section stood out.

"I want to work in an environment that
will challenge me to grow," wrote 18-year
old Caroline. "I think that working on The
Daily will press me to pay closer attention to
my surroundings, learn more about the
world, think deeply, and meet a community
of motivated, intelligent people."
Now, five years, 10 volumes, and innu
merable late nights and CoHo coffees later,
I can say with certainty that The Daily did
all of this for me and more.

My illustrious writing career would take
me from the features section to the sports
section, from the trenches of Full Moon on
the Quad to the press room at Maples Pavil
ion. As a desk editor, then managing editor,
then desk editor again, I would assign and
read and edit hundreds of stories, although
my mastery of AP Style is okay, at best.
This past year, I would find my first full
time, "post-grad" job at The Daily as the
head of our advertising department, a job
which continues to challenge me every day.
Over the years, I would learn so much,
about The Daily, about Stanford, about my
self. And most importantly, I would meet
that community of motivated, intelligent
people, some of whom I hope to know for
years to come.
There's no succinct or eloquent way for
me to wrap up this five-year ride, so I'll
keep it short: thanks for the memories, and
goodbye for now.
