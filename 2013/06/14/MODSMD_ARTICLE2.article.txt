Pasadena, Calif.-It wasn't pretty, but Stanford
proved yet again that its "Blue Collar" style of
play is as efficient as ever with a grinding 20-14
win over Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl on Tues
day.

After racing out to an early 14-point lead in
the first quarter thanks to some creative play
calling from head coach David Shaw and two
outstanding receptions, Stanford was all but
shut down on offense for the rest of the game.
But two Jordan Williamson field goals were all
the Cardinal would need, as the 99th edition of
"The Grandaddy of Them All" wound up a de
fensive struggle that the Badgers had a chance
to win until the very end.

Only when redshirt junior nose tackle Josh
Mauro reached up and tipped Curt Phillips'
pass into the hands of sprawling senior niclde
back Usua Amanam with the Badgers driving
into Cardinal territory did the large Stanford
contingent of fans begin to celebrate with little

over two minutes to play.
"I read pass," Amanam said, "so I got into
my drop and then I felt the quarterback coming
back towards the middle of the field. He went to
unwind, I think someone got a hand on it and I
just saw the ball fluttering into my hands.
"I mean I can't even tell you what I was
thinking. I was thinking about my mom, about
my family, about this team. Coach Mason al
ways talks about don't count the plays make the
plays count, and that's what I lived by today."
Early on it didn't seem like Stanford would
need Amanam's interception, the game's lone
turnover, or any kind of late-game heroics to ce
ment its first Rose Bowl victory since 1972. A
rushing touchdown by Kelsey Young on the
game's first possession was quickly followed by
another score on the ground for senior running
back Stepfan Taylor and a 14-0 lead before
some fans had even reached their seats.

But the Badgers' defense clamped down
hard with Hall of Fame coach Barry Alvarez
back on the sideline for a one-game stint seven
year's after retiring from head coaching with
