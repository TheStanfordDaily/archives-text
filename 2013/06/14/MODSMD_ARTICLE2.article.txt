Pasadena, Calif.-It wasn't pretty, but Stanford
proved yet again that its "Blue Collar" style of
play is as efficient as ever with a grinding 20-14
win over Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl on Tues
day.

After racing out to an early 14-point lead in
the first quarter thanks to some creative play
calling from head coach David Shaw and two
outstanding receptions, Stanford was all but
shut down on offense for the rest of the game.
But two Jordan Williamson field goals were all
the Cardinal would need, as the 99th edition of
"The Grandaddy of Them All" wound up a de
fensive struggle that the Badgers had a chance
to win until the very end.

Only when redshirt junior nose tackle Josh
Mauro reached up and tipped Curt Phillips'
pass into the hands of sprawling senior niclde
back Usua Amanam with the Badgers driving
into Cardinal territory did the large Stanford
contingent of fans begin to celebrate with little

over two minutes to play.
"I read pass," Amanam said, "so I got into
my drop and then I felt the quarterback coming
back towards the middle of the field. He went to
unwind, I think someone got a hand on it and I
just saw the ball fluttering into my hands.
"I mean I can't even tell you what I was
thinking. I was thinking about my mom, about
my family, about this team. Coach Mason al
ways talks about don't count the plays make the
plays count, and that's what I lived by today."
Early on it didn't seem like Stanford would
need Amanam's interception, the game's lone
turnover, or any kind of late-game heroics to ce
ment its first Rose Bowl victory since 1972. A
rushing touchdown by Kelsey Young on the
game's first possession was quickly followed by
another score on the ground for senior running
back Stepfan Taylor and a 14-0 lead before
some fans had even reached their seats.

But the Badgers' defense clamped down
hard with Hall of Fame coach Barry Alvarez
back on the sideline for a one-game stint seven
year's after retiring from head coaching with

Football head coach David Shaw (middle) celebrates Stanford's Rose Bowl Game
victory with his two children. Stanford won its first Rose Bowl Game since January 1972.
Wisconsin and 13 after taking down
Stanford on the same field at the
2000 Rose Bowl.

"This group of kids has been
through a lot, and they competed ex
tremely hard against a very high
quality team," Alvarez said. "We've
played three very good football
games (at the Rose Bowl). These
guys played hard. In fact, most peo
ple would like to get here once. But
we just didn't get it done."
They certainly came close, how
ever.

Stanford stopped James White
inside the 1-yard line on fourth down
early in the second quarter after a
touchdown run by Ball was wiped
out by a holding penalty, but Ball
scored on the next drive. The Badg
ers then mounted an 85-yard drive
just before halftime, with a 38-yard
scamper from Phillips setting up a
short TD catch that trimmed Stan
ford's halftime lead to 17-14.

"We knew coming in, it was go
ing to be a physical game," Taylor
said. "We knew they know how to
play against power as well as us.
They did a great job. It was our de
fense keeping us in the game that
enabled us to get this win."
Linebackers AJ Tarpley and
Shayne Skov led the team with nine

tackles, and safety Jordan Richards
had two tackles for a loss and a
bone-crunching hit to force an in
completion late. With senior nose
tackle Terrence Stephens ineligible
due to a secondary NCAA violation,
Mauro and junior David Parry
stepped up and filled the gaps inside
with 10 total tackles, repeatedly
forcing Wisconsin's big front line out
of its blocking assignments.
Ball, the NCAA career-leader in
rushing touchdowns managed to
claw his way to 100 yards on 24 car
ries, and the Badgers managed 218
yards total on the ground, but it
wasn't enough.

"This stings just as much, be
cause we fell extremely short when
we had the opportunity to win,"
Ball said. "We had numerous op
portunities to capitalize on big
plays, and we fell short. ... This is
not the way we want to be remem
bered. Speaking for the entire sen
ior group, this is not the way we
wanted to go out."

But it was exactly what
Amanam and the rest of Stanford's
senior class had in mind.

"This has been our No. 1 goal
coming in as freshmen," Amanam
said. "We came in and always heard
the older guys talk about 'Rose
Bowl this, Rose Bowl that.' To see it
finally materialize and to be in this
moment is an amazing feeling and I
honestly can't even describe it."
