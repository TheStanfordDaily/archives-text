Chi Theta Chi (XOX) residents
will return to campus this quarter
to a house under University man
agement for the first time, as XOX
representatives withdrew in Au
gust from long-running negotia
tions with administrators to restore
the house's historical independ
ence.
Following the Alumni Board's
Aug. 20 decision not to accept the
University's most recent offer of
delayed and conditional independ
ence, the house transitioned to Uni
versity management on Sept. 1.
"The University ... remainfs]
committed to working closely with
you to preserve as much of the tra
ditional Chi Theta Chi experience
as possible for you this year," wrote
Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney and
Dean of Residential Education
Deborah Colder in a letter to in
coming XOX residents.
In an Aug. 3 letter from the
Alumni Board to University admin
istrators, the Alumni Board high
lighted the lack of benchmarks of
fering a clear path to a lease with
long-term security for the Board,
the imposition of greater oversight
over the traditionally independent
house and demands for significant
Board-funded capital improve
ments as apparent reversals of pre
vious understandings with Univer
sity administrators.
"At our most recent meeting,
University representatives stated
that legal ownership was never the
University's intention, leading us to
believe that the University has
been negotiating in bad faith for
months," Abel Allison 'OB, XOX
Alumni Board and Madeleine Dou
glas 'O9 M.A. 'lO wrote in the Au
gust letter.
Vice Provost of Student Affairs
Greg Boardman and Senior Associ
ate Vice Provost of Residential &
Dining Enterprises Shirley Everett
disputed the notion of any shift in
the University's position between
May and August, noting that ad
ministrators only moved away from
a permanent termination of the
lease as a result of community sup
port for Chi Theta Chi and a "com
pelling argument" made by alumni

and students for the importance of
independence to the house's cul
ture.
"We can say with confidence
that throughout our discussions, we
have been steadfast in our efforts to
reach an agreement with Chi Theta
Chi according to the proposed
terms [of independence conditional
on improved management],"
Boardman and Everett wrote in a
statement.
Allison framed the letter as a
means of highlighting issues that
the Alumni Board considered criti
cal to obtaining a permanent settle
ment, and described University in
sistence on the termination of the
lease and a stringently regulated
interim period before any restored
independence as insurmountable
obstacles.
"This has been a very costly en
deavor for everyone involved in
terms of our time and energy," Alli
son said. "There were a number of
details that still wouldn't work out."
"The University started by tak
ing almost everything away from
us," he said. "It's been a process of
having to fight to get back to a place
where we'd be OK continuing... It
was clear the University wasn't go
ing to come any more our way, [and]
we needed to see more in order for
this to be something worth doing."
"It's what people expected," said
Peter McDonald 'll, a former XOX
resident active in events promoting
the house's independence. "It's not
a happy time, but there's not a
sense of giving up [Residents]
understand the Alumni Board was
doing what it had to do, and there's
generally a lot of support."
Administrators first moved to
terminate Chi Theta Chi's lease on
Feb. 8, alleging "pressing life safety
issues" and shortcomings in the
house's management and finances,
and sought a transfer to University
control on April 2. The takeover
was later postponed to Aug. 31, at
the natural expiration of the annu
ally renewed lease.
While both parties appeared
close in May to obtaining a settle
ment establishing a period of joint
management and ownership of the
house â€”with the potential future
restoration of ownership to the
XOX Alumni Board the August
letter from the Alumni Board to
University administrators urgently
requested a meeting in response to
alleged changes in the University's
negotiating stance.
