Stanford University Resident
John Hennessy sat down with
The Stanford Daily on Oct. 29
to discuss a wide range of top
ics, including online education,
Stanford's failed campaign for a New
York City campus last fall, Stanford's
fundraising prowess and more. This is
the third of four installments of that in
terview; this one focuses on Stanford's
success in fundraising and the use of
that money.

The Stanford Daily (TS1)):A part of
that [New Y)i'k City campus] proposal
... [was] how much money Stanford's
raised and how it could raise very sig
nificant capital, billions of dollars, for
that campus. Will Stanford still be em
barking on an aggressive fundraising
campaign? And, if so, what will the
money be used for?
John Hennessy (JH):I think the ques
tion is, "Will Stanford... still have ambi
tious things to do?" And then I think
we'll have a fundraising campaign that
I don't know that weH have a large,
integrated campaign like we've just fin
ished recently—but we'll certainly be
raising money for important Universi
ty priorities and I think, to the extent
that we have compelling, visionary
things to do. That's what was attractive
about New York: it was compelling, it
was visionary, it was very different and
it opened up some new opportunities
for the University
But if we have other —and I'm
sure we will have other—compelling,
important things we want to do, then I
think we will certainly turn to our
alumni and supporters for help with
those.

TSD:Over the past few years Stan
ford's been almost mind-bogglingly
successful at raising money. What do

you think contributes to that success? I
mean, whether it's on our end or if it's
just the alumni loving the school?
JH:lt's clearly tremendous affection
and loyalty from the alumni. It's a com
pelling vision of what we are able to do,
whether it be the SEED [Stanford In
stitute for Innovation in Developing
Economies] project in the business
school, talking about using entrepre
neurism as the way to generate eco
nomic growth in the poorest countries
in the world, or it's moving ahead on a
new Bing Concert Hall, doing some
thing to really raise the quality of the
arts and our spaces for the ails at Stan
ford. Those are big ideas, big vision.
They're the kinds of things people say,
"That's transformative. If Stanford can
do that, that will transform the experi
ence that the students, faculty and
Stanford community have."
I think they get excited about that
sort of opportunity. I mean the hospital,
rebuilding the hospital and building a
state-of-the-art, brand new hospital.
That's a compelling vision. That's what
people like to back: [a] compelling vi
sion that they think is going to make a
difference.... Tou think about philan
thropy people think about it as a phil
anthi'opic investment. It's an invest
ment [that] doesn't have a monetary
return; it has a social return. But they
want to see that it's going to have a
large social return. And then they have
great faith in the University as a stew
ard of their philanthropy

TSD:Do you think that this huge phi
lanthropy and huge fundraising suc
cess will be one of the major hallmarks
of your tenure here at Stanford, or do
you think other things will be pointed
to?
JH:In the end, it's what you do with the
money So, what we've been able to do
in terms of financial aid, you kno\y I
was just looking at the financial aid
numbers and... the nationally defined
standard net tuition, namely. You
take tuition, you subtract all the
financial aid. So our net tuition
number means students are
paying about the same amount,
after inflation, as they were in
the early '9os. So we've man
aged to actually bring the ef
fective affordability of a Stan
ford education down for many
families. That's a compelling,
really compelling thing for peo
ple at a time when, particularly
middle-class families, are hav
ing a lot of stress about finan
cial aid.
Rebuilding the engineering
side of campus. That side of
campus... it looked like an in
dustrial slum. I mean literally
pipes on the outside of
buildings and all these little
cinder block buildings and the
streets were all every-whieh
way. I remember when I got
here and the parking lot I
parked my car in, I then
walked over the top of this old
building that housed part of
the accelerator stuff in it... on
a wooden bridge that went
over the top of this old ram
shackle building with barbed
wire fences on both sides and
things like that.... It was horri
ble. So that's all gone and that
part of campus looks really
great We used to never take
visitors on the tour to the side
of engineering campus be
cause it was so ugly; now you
can walk down there and it
looks great.

The new business school...
the concert hall, obviously; and
the new Anderson collection.
Those are really going to be
transformative things.
And then faculty: we've
managed to raise [money for]
hundreds of endowed chairs,
and that's going to enable us to
continue to attract the best
faculty. So in the end, it's really
the investments you make of
the money. It's true that our
enormous fundraising success
has allowed us to accelerate a
lot of projects. ...When we first
heard about the business
school project, the provost and
I thought [it would take] 10 to
15 years for them to rebuild
their entire campus. 10 to 15
years. Because we thought,
"They'll build the classroom
building and then they'll
fundraise the next building."
But they have a lot of alum
ni who not only love the busi
ness school and found it trans
formative in them lives, but
[who] really saw this vision of
a new way of teaching in busi
ness schools that was much
more small group-oriented,
that needed a different kind
of classroom structure, that
engaged the rest of the Uni
versity more and they found
the vision compelling and...
the new buildings and new
campus were needed to fulfill
the vision. And they managed
to raise the money they need
ed in three years instead of 10
or 12 years. So that's a good
sign.
