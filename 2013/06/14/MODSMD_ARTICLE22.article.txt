## TENNIS SAVES TITLE STREAK

With the entire stadium watching,
junior co-captain Kristie Ahn
clinched No. 12 Stanford women's
tennis' 17th NCAA Championship
with a 7-5, 4-6, 6-2 victory on Court
No. 2 to propel the Cardinal past No.
3 Texas A&M on Tuesday night.

"It was so surreal," Ahn said. "I
was having so much fun out there and
just loving the moment. I had the
biggest grin on my face, and when I
went up to hit that final serve, I said,
'This one, this one is it.' We all
watched [the shot] sail long, and I
started jumping around like a little
kid."
Ahn's match would not have mat
tered without the miraculous come
back of her fellow junior co-captain
Nicole Gibbs.
Gibbs fought back from 0-6, 0-2
down against A&M's Cristina
Sanchez-Quintanar, losing a set 6-0 for
the first time in her 120-match colle
giate career to win the next 12 games
and take the match 0-6, 6-2, 6-0. The
comeback win gave Stanford (224,8-2
Pac-12) a 3-0 lead over the Aggies (26-
4,12-1 SEC), setting up Ahn's clincher.
"I have all the confidence in the
world in my team," Gibbs said, "but
it's hard to see your No. 1 player go
down quickly in a dual match because
it hurts team momentum. I felt a lit
tle drained at the beginning and I
wasn't staying in points long enough
to outlast her the way I needed to."
That's when Gibbs had a self-pro
claimed wake-up call.

"I sat down with [Coach Lele
Forood]," Gibbs said, "and I said, 'My
team needs me here. I need to win
this match.'"

The victory gave Stanford its first
NCAA team title in the 2012-13 athlet
ics year. Stanford had won at least one
NCAA team title in each of the last 36
years, and the women's tennis NCAA
Tournament was one of the Cardinal's
last opportunities to extend the streak.
Entering the tournament seeded
outside of the top 10 for the first time
since 2009, Stanford became the low
est-seeded team to capture the
women's tennis NCAA team title.
The Cardinal first defeated the Pac
-12 champions No. 5 USC in the
Round of 16.
"We were suppose to lose in the
first non-regional round," Gibbs said.
"USC was our biggest hurdle men
tally coming into the tournament. We
knew we worked harder than any
other team in the country, and if we
could win that match, we could ulti
mately win the championship."
Stanford went on to creep past
No. 4 Georgia in the quarterfinals,
No. 1 Florida in the semifinals and fi
nally the No. 3 Aggies in the finals.
Stanford captured these wins with
out Mallory Burdette 'l3, who played
No. 2 singles and teamed up with
Gibbs in No. 1 doubles for the Cardinal
last year and left school to play on the
pro circuit in September. Only two
Cardinal players, Gibbs and senior
Stacey Tan, had appealed in more than
two NCAA Tournament matches.
It was a night of ups and downs.
Stanford's first completed match was an
8-3 loss on Court No. 1 by the No. 8 na
tionally ranked duo of Gibbs and Ahn.
"We got outplayed [at doubles],"
Gibbs admitted. "I don't say that
very often, but they executed every
thing they needed to and made us
play worse than we have been play
ing. They just came out a little bit
tougher than us, and we were

weren't quite prepared."
An 84 win from Tan and sopho
more Ellen Tsay and a huge 8-5 vic
tory from the oldest and youngest
members of the squad, senior co-cap
tain Natalie Dillon and freshman
Krista Hardebeck, over twin Aggies
Ines and Paula Deheza, set Stanford
up 1-0 entering singles.
Tan was the first to finish in sin

gles, topping Ines Deheza in a 7-5, 6-
3 straight-set victory. Then, Gibbs,
who won both the NCAA individual
singles and doubles tournament last
year, completed her comeback to put
the Cardinal on the brink of the title.
The Cardinal was up 3-0 at this
point in the match, but the score was
deceiving. Hardebeck, Dillon, and
Tsay all had lost the first sets of their

matches and were neck-and-neck in
their respective second sets.
Tsay, who clinched Stanford's vic
tory over USC last Friday, was the
first to fall, losing to A&M's Anna
Mamalat 6-1,7-5.
Stanford's lead was down to 3-1.

The No. 12 Stanford women's tennis team (above) became the lowest seed ever to win the NCAA title with

lar narrative. She sealed the Cardi
nal's victory first in the quarterfinal
match against Georgia before re
peating the feat in a huge comeback
win over No. 1 Florida's Alexandra
Cercone in the semifinals.
The highly touted rookie fell 6-3
in the first set to A&M's Nazari
Urbina. Like Tsay, she almost drove
it to a third before losing 7-6 (3) in a
second set tiebreaker.
All of a sudden, the Aggies were
just one match behind.
Dillon managed to send her
match to a third set after making an
impressive second-set comeback,
but couldn't finish for the Cardinal
as she tumbled 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 to

A&M's Stefania Hristov.
With the match tied at 3-3, it was
Ahn's moment to shine.
"[Coach Frankie Brennan] said
to me during the match," Ahn said,
'"You deserve this, this is destiny, it's
going to happen.' And I said, 'You
are right, it is going to happen.' We
put in the hard work, we definitely
had the toughest draw and to pull it
out? I don't know how to describe
it."
Ahn was sidelined most of last
season with injury, making only her
fourth singles appearance of the
season in then-No. 4 Stanford's
quarterfinals loss to USC. This
year, Ahn clinched an NCAA title,
capping an improbable run in the
college tennis world's most es
teemed tournament.
Crowds watched in awe as Ahn
led 5-2 in the third set after winning
the first 7-5 but dropping the second

4-6. At the end of a back and forth
game between the two players,
Stancu missed long and the tight
knit Stanford squad bombarded
Ahn in an even tighter circle.
"I don't think we could have
asked for a better team national
championship clincher," Gibbs said.
"[Ahn] is just such a team player,
really sticking with the team
through some of the hardest peri
ods of her life. Everyone on the
team deserves to win her match,
but I'm so happy to see [Ahn] win it
for us."
Tonight will be a night of celebra
tion for the players and coaches, but
a short-lived one. The NCAA indi
vidual singles and doubles tourna
ments begin this week, with Gibbs
looking to defend both titles.

with a 7-5, 4-6, 6-2 victory on Court
No. 2 to propel the Cardinal past No.
3 Texas A&M on Tuesday night.

"It was so surreal," Ahn said. "I
was having so much fun out there and
just loving the moment. I had the
biggest grin on my face, and when I
went up to hit that final serve, I said,
'This one, this one is it.' We all
watched [the shot] sail long, and I
started jumping around like a little
kid."
Ahn's match would not have mat
tered without the miraculous come
back of her fellow junior co-captain
Nicole Gibbs.
Gibbs fought back from 0-6, 0-2
down against A&M's Cristina
Sanchez-Quintanar, losing a set 6-0 for
the first time in her 120-match colle
giate career to win the next 12 games
and take the match 0-6, 6-2, 6-0. The
comeback win gave Stanford (224,8-2
Pac-12) a 3-0 lead over the Aggies (26-
4,12-1 SEC), setting up Ahn's clincher.
"I have all the confidence in the
world in my team," Gibbs said, "but
it's hard to see your No. 1 player go
down quickly in a dual match because
it hurts team momentum. I felt a lit
tle drained at the beginning and I
wasn't staying in points long enough
to outlast her the way I needed to."
That's when Gibbs had a self-pro
claimed wake-up call.

"I sat down with [Coach Lele
Forood]," Gibbs said, "and I said, 'My
team needs me here. I need to win
this match.'"

The victory gave Stanford its first
NCAA team title in the 2012-13 athlet
ics year. Stanford had won at least one
NCAA team title in each of the last 36
years, and the women's tennis NCAA
Tournament was one of the Cardinal's
last opportunities to extend the streak.
Entering the tournament seeded
outside of the top 10 for the first time
since 2009, Stanford became the low
est-seeded team to capture the
women's tennis NCAA team title.
The Cardinal first defeated the Pac
-12 champions No. 5 USC in the
Round of 16.
"We were suppose to lose in the
first non-regional round," Gibbs said.
"USC was our biggest hurdle men
tally coming into the tournament. We
knew we worked harder than any
other team in the country, and if we
could win that match, we could ulti
mately win the championship."
Stanford went on to creep past
No. 4 Georgia in the quarterfinals,
No. 1 Florida in the semifinals and fi
nally the No. 3 Aggies in the finals.
Stanford captured these wins with
out Mallory Burdette 'l3, who played
No. 2 singles and teamed up with
Gibbs in No. 1 doubles for the Cardinal
last year and left school to play on the
pro circuit in September. Only two
Cardinal players, Gibbs and senior
Stacey Tan, had appealed in more than
two NCAA Tournament matches.
It was a night of ups and downs.
Stanford's first completed match was an
8-3 loss on Court No. 1 by the No. 8 na
tionally ranked duo of Gibbs and Ahn.
"We got outplayed [at doubles],"
Gibbs admitted. "I don't say that
very often, but they executed every
thing they needed to and made us
play worse than we have been play
ing. They just came out a little bit
tougher than us, and we were

weren't quite prepared."
An 84 win from Tan and sopho
more Ellen Tsay and a huge 8-5 vic
tory from the oldest and youngest
members of the squad, senior co-cap
tain Natalie Dillon and freshman
Krista Hardebeck, over twin Aggies
Ines and Paula Deheza, set Stanford
up 1-0 entering singles.
Tan was the first to finish in sin

gles, topping Ines Deheza in a 7-5, 6-
3 straight-set victory. Then, Gibbs,
who won both the NCAA individual
singles and doubles tournament last
year, completed her comeback to put
the Cardinal on the brink of the title.
The Cardinal was up 3-0 at this
point in the match, but the score was
deceiving. Hardebeck, Dillon, and
Tsay all had lost the first sets of their

matches and were neck-and-neck in
their respective second sets.
Tsay, who clinched Stanford's vic
tory over USC last Friday, was the
first to fall, losing to A&M's Anna
Mamalat 6-1,7-5.
Stanford's lead was down to 3-1.

The No. 12 Stanford women's tennis team (above) became the lowest seed ever to win the NCAA title with

nal's victory first in the quarterfinal
match against Georgia before re
peating the feat in a huge comeback
win over No. 1 Florida's Alexandra
Cercone in the semifinals.
The highly touted rookie fell 6-3
in the first set to A&M's Nazari
Urbina. Like Tsay, she almost drove
it to a third before losing 7-6 (3) in a
second set tiebreaker.
All of a sudden, the Aggies were
just one match behind.
Dillon managed to send her
match to a third set after making an
impressive second-set comeback,
but couldn't finish for the Cardinal
as she tumbled 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 to

A&M's Stefania Hristov.
With the match tied at 3-3, it was
Ahn's moment to shine.
"[Coach Frankie Brennan] said
to me during the match," Ahn said,
'"You deserve this, this is destiny, it's
going to happen.' And I said, 'You
are right, it is going to happen.' We
put in the hard work, we definitely
had the toughest draw and to pull it
out? I don't know how to describe
it."
Ahn was sidelined most of last
season with injury, making only her
fourth singles appearance of the
season in then-No. 4 Stanford's
quarterfinals loss to USC. This
year, Ahn clinched an NCAA title,
capping an improbable run in the
college tennis world's most es
teemed tournament.
Crowds watched in awe as Ahn
led 5-2 in the third set after winning
