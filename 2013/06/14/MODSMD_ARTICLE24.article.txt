Stanford senior ace Mark Appel was selected No. 1
overall by the Houston Astros in the Major League
Baseball First-Year Player Draft Thursday.
Appel was selected eighth overall by the Pittsburgh Pi
rates in last year's draft, but decided not to sign for a report
ed $3.8 million dollars. Instead, Appel returned to Stanford
for his senior season, dazzling with a 10-4 record and a 2.12
earned run average. Appel also struck out 130 hitters to be
come Stanford's all-time career strikeouts leader.
Under the system introduced by the MLB for last
year's draft, each pick has a slotted value for the signing
bonus. Teams that exceed the total bonus pool allotted -
the bonus pool is the sum of the slotted value for all of a
team's picks - face penalties including taxes and potential
loss of draft picks.
Last year, the Pirates reportedly offered Appel $1 mil
lion above slot to reach the $3.8 million mark. The slot val
ue of the first overall pick is just under $7.8 million; it looks
like Appel's decision to come back to Stanford will pay off
monetarily.
Appel has made no secret of his desire to play in Hous
ton. Though Appel went to high school in California, he
grew up in Houston and his parents moved back to Hous
ton this spring.
In the second round, the Seattle Mariners picked jun
ior centerfielder Austin Wilson at No. 49 overall. Wilson
was listed as a top-15 prospect by ESPN's Keith Law and
a top-30 prospect by Baseball America. The slot value for
the 49th overall pick is $l.l million.
Should Wilson decide not to sign with Seattle, he
would be eligible to play for Stanford in 2014. The dead
line for underclassmen to sign is July 12.
After the conclusion of the second round Thursday
night, the MLB Draft will continue Friday with rounds
three through 10. The final 30 rounds will take place on
Saturday
Junior first baseman Brian Ragira, senior relief pitch
er Garrett Hughes, junior pitcher A. J. Vanegas and junior
shortstop Lonnie Kauppila are the Stanford players most
likely to be drafted after Appel and Wilson.
