There has never been a Rose Bowl quite
like this one.
Of all the legendary running backs who
have played in The Granddaddy of them All
O.J. Simpson, Archie Griffin, Charles White,
Ron Dayne, Reggie Bush, LaMichael James
none has done what Stanford's Stepfan Taylor
and Wisconsin's Montee Ball are about to do.
Taylor and Ball have combined for 9,252
career rushing yards, the largest total for two
starting running backs the history of the Rose
Bowl. The previous record, set by Ball and
James last year, was a measly 8,069 yards, and
this will be just the fourth Rose Bowl in the
last 40 years to feature two tailbacks who have
combined for at least 7,000 over their careers.

"It says that both teams are committed to
running the football, and we both obviously
have talented backs," said senior defensive
end Ben Gardner. "From Stepfan's stand
point, he's our workhorse and he's really the
pulse of our team. We know when all else
fails, we can ride his back and he'll take us
where we need to go."
But Stanford's career leader in rushing
yards, carries and 100-yard games isn't about
to get caught up in the battle of the backs.
"I try not to think like that," Taylor said of
the upcoming showdown with Ball. "You
know he's there, but like I said, I can't play on
defense. I'm not playing against the other
running backs, so I focus on offense and con
trolling what I can control."
Taylor's 35 carries and 177 rushing yards
in last year's Fiesta Bowl were also Stanford

Senior running back Stepfan Taylor (33) and Wisconsin senior running back Montee Ball
have combined to rush for 9,252 yards in their careers, heading into the Rose Bowl Game.
Containing the backs should be the toughest challenge for each defense in the game.
bowl-game records. As the star of a
Cardinal offense that has favored
the run even more so in 2012 Tay
lor has carried 302 times, up from
242 in as many games last season
he'll be looking to notch a third con
secutive bowl performance over 100
yards.
But to do so he'll have to get past
a Wisconsin (8-5, 4-4 Big Ten) de
fense that ranks 21st in the nation
against the run, which statistically
makes for Taylor's greatest chal
lenge since the Cardinal (11-2, 8-1
Pac-12) played Notre Dame (fourth
best against the run) in Stanford's
last loss.
"We know it's going to be a phys
ical game," Taylor said. "The
tougher team out there is going to
get it.
"They're a stingy team. Once the
play's there you've got to get it. It's
a lot of game-planning, attention to
detail and just trusting the game
scheme, not trying to go out there
and do something you haven't done
all year."
Stanford's defense, meanwhile,
will be tasked with controlling the
statistical behemoth that is Montee
Ball, who holds NCAA records for
total and rushing touchdowns, has
racked up more yards and points
than any other active player and will
be playing in his third consecutive
Rose Bowl.
Ball needs 150 more yards to
break the Rose Bowl career record
of 446, set by fellow Badger Ron
Dayne against the Cardinal on Jan.
1,2000.
"[Ball] is really the total pack
age," Gardner said. "He's a big back,
very powerful. He breaks a lot of
tackles but he can also break away
and make guys miss. He uses his
spin move very well to bounce off
contact and he's got a lot of beef in
front of him with big offensive line
men."
The Cardinal's front seven,
which boasts the nation's third best
rush defense, has already gone up
against its fan- share of elite tail
backs: Arizona's Ka'Deem Carey,
UCLA's Johnathan Franklin and
Oregon's De' Anthony Thomas and
Kenjon Barner. Stanford is 4-0
against those Pac-12 heavyweights.
But that experience may not
translate directly to facing Ball.
"He's a different kind of back,"

said Stanford defensive line coach
Randy Hart. "This guy combines
power with the ability to move, so
he's kind of a combination of all of
them thrown into one. He'll be a
tough one to deal with, and again,
we've got to have our best game
tackling to win this game."

"The most similar to it would be
playing against Stepfan and our own
offense," Gardner noted. "The types
of formations and the heavy sets
that our team runs are similar to
what Wisconsin will bring at you."
The Badgers are even more ded
icated to the run (handing the ball
off 68 percent of the time) than the
Cardinal (58 percent) is. That ap
proach paid dividends in the Big
Ten Championship Game, when
unranked Wisconsin ran for 539
yards and upset No. 14 Nebraska
70-31.
"And if you're good enough to
put 539 yards on Nebraska, you're
a doggone good football team with
doggone good backs," Hart said.
Ball accounted for 202 of those
yards, but it was redshirt freshman
Melvin Gordon who led the Badgers
with 216 on the ground. Wisconsin
even had a third back, junior James
White, above 100 yards on the game.
"They've got a great mix of
three: Ball's the power guy, White's
the quick guy and Gordon's the
burner," Gardner said. "Pick your
poison, we're going to have to stop
all three of them somehow.
"We're not sure how we're going
to do it just yet, but we're going to
do our best." Though Stan
ford hasn't gotten many big yardage
games from its backups this season,
the Cardinal has benefited from all
around rushing performances in
each of its last two bowls. Short
yardage specialist Jeremy Stewart
broke long runs in both the 2011 Or
ange Bowl and 2012 Fiesta Bowl,
picking up 164 yards on just eight
carries in those two games.
Junior Anthony Wilkerson, soph
omore Remound Wright and sopho
more Ricky Seale will be looking to
make them presence felt similarly
next Tbesday.
"In bowl games we've had oppor
tunities to put other backs in, and
they've shown that they can play,"
Taylor said. "It's just them waiting
for their shot, and once they get it
they took advantage of it."
Taylor and Ball will highlight the
Rose Bowl rushing extravaganza on
Jan. 1 at 1:30 p.m.

"They're a stingy team. Once the
play's there you've got to get it. It's
a lot of game-planning, attention to
detail and just trusting the game
scheme, not trying to go out there
and do something you haven't done
all year."
Stanford's defense, meanwhile,
will be tasked with controlling the
statistical behemoth that is Montee
Ball, who holds NCAA records for
total and rushing touchdowns, has
racked up more yards and points
than any other active player and will
be playing in his third consecutive
Rose Bowl.
Ball needs 150 more yards to
break the Rose Bowl career record
of 446, set by fellow Badger Ron
Dayne against the Cardinal on Jan.
1,2000.
"[Ball] is really the total pack
age," Gardner said. "He's a big back,
very powerful. He breaks a lot of
tackles but he can also break away
and make guys miss. He uses his
spin move very well to bounce off
contact and he's got a lot of beef in
front of him with big offensive line
men."
The Cardinal's front seven,
which boasts the nation's third best
rush defense, has already gone up
against its fan- share of elite tail
backs: Arizona's Ka'Deem Carey,
UCLA's Johnathan Franklin and
Oregon's De' Anthony Thomas and
Kenjon Barner. Stanford is 4-0
against those Pac-12 heavyweights.
But that experience may not
translate directly to facing Ball.
"He's a different kind of back,"

said Stanford defensive line coach
Randy Hart. "This guy combines
power with the ability to move, so
he's kind of a combination of all of
them thrown into one. He'll be a
tough one to deal with, and again,
we've got to have our best game
tackling to win this game."

"The most similar to it would be
playing against Stepfan and our own
offense," Gardner noted. "The types
of formations and the heavy sets
that our team runs are similar to
what Wisconsin will bring at you."
The Badgers are even more ded
icated to the run (handing the ball
off 68 percent of the time) than the
Cardinal (58 percent) is. That ap
proach paid dividends in the Big
Ten Championship Game, when
unranked Wisconsin ran for 539
yards and upset No. 14 Nebraska
70-31.
"And if you're good enough to
put 539 yards on Nebraska, you're
a doggone good football team with
doggone good backs," Hart said.
Ball accounted for 202 of those
yards, but it was redshirt freshman
Melvin Gordon who led the Badgers
with 216 on the ground. Wisconsin
even had a third back, junior James
White, above 100 yards on the game.
"They've got a great mix of
three: Ball's the power guy, White's
the quick guy and Gordon's the
burner," Gardner said. "Pick your
poison, we're going to have to stop
all three of them somehow.
"We're not sure how we're going
to do it just yet, but we're going to
do our best." Though Stan
ford hasn't gotten many big yardage
games from its backups this season,
the Cardinal has benefited from all
around rushing performances in
each of its last two bowls. Short
yardage specialist Jeremy Stewart
broke long runs in both the 2011 Or
ange Bowl and 2012 Fiesta Bowl,
picking up 164 yards on just eight
carries in those two games.
Junior Anthony Wilkerson, soph
omore Remound Wright and sopho
more Ricky Seale will be looking to
make them presence felt similarly
next Tbesday.
"In bowl games we've had oppor
tunities to put other backs in, and
they've shown that they can play,"
Taylor said. "It's just them waiting
for their shot, and once they get it
they took advantage of it."
Taylor and Ball will highlight the
Rose Bowl rushing extravaganza on
Jan. 1 at 1:30 p.m.

Taylor and Ball have combined for 9,252
career rushing yards, the largest total for two
starting running backs the history of the Rose
Bowl. The previous record, set by Ball and
James last year, was a measly 8,069 yards, and
this will be just the fourth Rose Bowl in the
last 40 years to feature two tailbacks who have
combined for at least 7,000 over their careers.

"It says that both teams are committed to
running the football, and we both obviously
have talented backs," said senior defensive
end Ben Gardner. "From Stepfan's stand
point, he's our workhorse and he's really the
pulse of our team. We know when all else
fails, we can ride his back and he'll take us
where we need to go."
But Stanford's career leader in rushing
yards, carries and 100-yard games isn't about
to get caught up in the battle of the backs.
"I try not to think like that," Taylor said of
the upcoming showdown with Ball. "You
know he's there, but like I said, I can't play on
defense. I'm not playing against the other
running backs, so I focus on offense and con
trolling what I can control."
