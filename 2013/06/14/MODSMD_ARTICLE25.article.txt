There has never been a Rose Bowl quite
like this one.
Of all the legendary running backs who
have played in The Granddaddy of them All
O.J. Simpson, Archie Griffin, Charles White,
Ron Dayne, Reggie Bush, LaMichael James
none has done what Stanford's Stepfan Taylor
and Wisconsin's Montee Ball are about to do.
Taylor and Ball have combined for 9,252
career rushing yards, the largest total for two
starting running backs the history of the Rose
Bowl. The previous record, set by Ball and
James last year, was a measly 8,069 yards, and
this will be just the fourth Rose Bowl in the
last 40 years to feature two tailbacks who have
combined for at least 7,000 over their careers.

"It says that both teams are committed to
running the football, and we both obviously
have talented backs," said senior defensive
end Ben Gardner. "From Stepfan's stand
point, he's our workhorse and he's really the
pulse of our team. We know when all else
fails, we can ride his back and he'll take us
where we need to go."
But Stanford's career leader in rushing
yards, carries and 100-yard games isn't about
to get caught up in the battle of the backs.
"I try not to think like that," Taylor said of
the upcoming showdown with Ball. "You
know he's there, but like I said, I can't play on
defense. I'm not playing against the other
running backs, so I focus on offense and con
trolling what I can control."
Taylor's 35 carries and 177 rushing yards
in last year's Fiesta Bowl were also Stanford

Senior running back Stepfan Taylor (33) and Wisconsin senior running back Montee Ball
have combined to rush for 9,252 yards in their careers, heading into the Rose Bowl Game.
Containing the backs should be the toughest challenge for each defense in the game.
