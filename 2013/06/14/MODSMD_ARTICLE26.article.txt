11 before [coaching] the gold-
H H game, I went into a small,
dark room and I laid down and I
I about being a little kid and
how I played out in the neighborhood and how I
would imagine this big arena filled with people, and
I thought: 'I am living my dream.'"

Tara VanDerveer has not only fulfilled her own
dreams of playing college basketball and of witness
ing women's basketball become a dominant sport in
the athletic world, but she is also the reason that so
many young women today have had that same op
portunity.

"Basketball has been an incredible thing that
you never could have imagined. When I was in col
lege, I never could have imagined that this was what
it would grow into," VanDerveer reflected. "It's
been a great life. I can't even imagine a better life."
Few basketball coaches, male or female, can
boast the coaching career and legacy that Van-
Derveer has created. In her 27 seasons as head
coach of Stanford's women's basketball team, the
trailblazer in women's athletics has led the Cardinal
to a record of 742-152, 25 NCAA Tournament ap
pearances, including two national championships
(1990, 1992) and 10 final fours, 21 regular season
conference titles, and 10 Pae-12/Pac-10 tournament
crowns.
Along the way, VanDerveer has received due
recognition for these accomplishments, many
achieved at a time when female athletes were not
taken as seriously as their male counterparts.
For the four-time National Coach of the Year
(1988-90,2011), 13-time Pac-12/Pac-10 Coach of the
Year and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer,
though, modesty is her policy. However, the impact
VanDerveer has had on the realm of women's sports
cannot be fully comprehended without tracing her
straggles and triumphs.

'All the boys in the neighborhood always played
[basketball] together. So I just loved playing [with
them]. For some reason I loved basketball I can't
toll you why, but I liked the strategy of it," explains
VanDerveer. "It's so physical and it's fast."
Playing with the boys wasn't always an easy
thing to break into, though. VanDerveer demon
strated her determination and savvy early on when
she bought the best basketball possible, but told the
boys they could use it only if they let her play and
more often than not she got her way.
Her high school didn't have any female sports
teams and she took up cheerleading instead. Even
when she transferred to a private all-girls school,
competition only consisted of "fun days" with differ
ent teams playing against each other nothing like
organized high school basketball today.
VanDerveer wasn't just satisfied with a taste of
basketball in her life, she wanted the whole thing
and was determined to play in college.
♦ ♦♦
"When I went to college I played on a college
team that was like a Division 111 [Albany]," Van-
Derveer said. "That's where I jumped center, I was
the leading scorer, the leading rebounder, leading
assist, leading turnover."
After a year, she realized she wasn't satisfied
with being a big fish in a little pond and transferred
to Indiana University —where she was still a big
fish, but in a much bigger pond.
VanDerveer immediately thrived with her new
team at Indiana. She recalls several occasions when
she and her teammates would fantasize about the
future of women's basketball, but with only a nine
game regular season, the thought of any advance
ment was far-fetched.
"We'd joke that there would be a professional
women's league. They'd say 'Yeah, I'll be the gener
al manager, and Tara, you'll be the coach,"' Van-
Derveer recalled. "It was just comical talking to my
teammates, because there were no scholarships. I
worked in the kitchen to pay for school."
After college, VanDerveer planned on taking a
year off before attending law school but money ran
out and she was back home by Christmas. It was her
father who unwittingly got the ball rolling on her
coaching career when he suggested that Van-
Derveer coach her sister Marie's high school bas
ketball team.
♦ ♦♦
Title IX was just starting to take effect and more
high schools were adopting girl's basketball pro
grams. But given that her sister's team had just lost

by a 99-11 score the previous night, VanDerveer was
far from eager to devote time to that team. Howev
er, her dad convinced her to be a volunteer coach
and her lifelong commitment to coaching began.
"I felt I had a lot to offer because I knew a lot
about basketball. I studied it all the time. When I
was at Indiana, I watched every practice that Bob
by Knight had at Indiana and I also took his coach
ing class," VanDerveer said. "I went to the clinic and
it was like 500 guys and I was the only woman there,
and I sat right in front."
After coaching her sister's team, VanDerveer
got a graduate coaching position at Ohio State,
which included coaching the JV to an undefeated
season, and stayed there until she completed her
master's in sports management and administration.
VanDerveer's first head coaching stint began at
Idaho (1978-1980), where she got the first of her now
more than 800 career wins. VanDerveer was only
the fifth Division I women's basketball head coach
to reach that milestone. In her 34 years of coaching,
she has culled an overall record of 894-203.
The success continued at Ohio State (1980-1985),
where she coached the Buckeyes to four Big-10
Championships and twice received Big-10 Coach of
the Year recognition.

But VanDerveer was always primed for a chal
lenge, and when the coach received a phone call
from then-Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
she considered leaving Ohio to take a gamble coach
ing a Stanford team that her Buckeyes had recent
ly dismantled, 7947.

VanDerveer was ultimately drawn to Stanford
by the rich tradition of academics and athletics. As a
three-year Dean's List Scholar at Indiana, Van-
Derveer values education and saw this as a great op
portunity to create a model of athletic and academic
excellence.
The road to athletic excellence would not be easy,
though. VanDerveer inherited a team that was com
ing off of a poor 9-19 season in 1984. She told Geiger
that more effort and money would have to be put in
to the program in order to be competitive in the long
run.
"We just had to work really hard to get the word
out about Stanford, VanDerveer said. "We had a
good group of people on our team, but they just
needed to be surrounded by more talent."
VanDerveer proved her coaching prowess by
turning the program around in a short period of
time. The team finished just 13-15 her first season,
but made its return to the NCAA tournament in
1988. In 1990, she would build the best team in the
nation with a record of 32-1.
By 1992, VanDerveer had won the program's
first two national championship and won National
Coach of the Year three times en route to establish
ing Stanford as one of the most successful programs
in women's basketball history.
One of her most gratifying basketball memories
came at this time. Prior to the program's first Final
Four game in 1990, Jennifer Azzi '9O, the team's star
player, wrote VanDerveer a note saying, "Tara, this
one is for you."
"I think that the thing that is most rewarding is
when I talk to Jennifer, or I see Sonja Henning, or I
saw Val Whiting, or Kate Starbird, or former play
ers, I get a text from Nneka [Ogwumike]," said Van-
Derveer. "It's just so special how the relationship is,
that I'm 20 years removed from some of these peo
ple...and I meant something to them."
Her impact didn't stop at Stanford. VanDerveer
was asked to coach USA Women's Basketball at the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. She was influen
tial in changing the organization of USA Women's
Basketball by suggesting that the team be formed
sooner, so that it could train and practice for a full
year, instead of just the weeks leading up to compe
tition. From 1995-1996, VanDerveer coached Team
USA, including Azzi, Lisa Leslie and Sheryl
Swoops, to an undefeated 60-0 record and an
Olympic gold medal. By taking women's basketball
seriously, VanDerveer made the world respect the
sport.
VanDerveer admitted that when she sat in her
apartment at Indiana joking with her teammates
about professional women's basketball, never in her
wildest dreams did she believe that their jokes
would become a reality. Yet that same little girl
who played with the neighborhood boys and could
only imagine playing in a packed arena saw to it
that women's basketball could be more than just a
game.

has opened doors for not only
women's basketball players, but also
other female athletes around the na
tion with her consistent pursuit of ex
cellence and high standards.
VanDerveer's younger sister Hei
di, the women's basketball coach at
UC-San Diego, credits her sister for
leading the way in an area where
many would have been unwilling to
commit to progress.
'Any time you've been in a profes
sion for that many years, you must be
doing something right because other
wise you wouldn't make it," said Hei
di VanDerveer. "She's just been a
kind of standard, along with Pat Sum
mit, Geno [Auriemma]. Tara has real
ly set the stage for women's basket
ball for the current generation and I
think for the next generation as well."
At Stanford, VanDerveer changed
the culture of women's athletics by at
tracting the brightest and best ath
letes in the nation to the Farm to build
a program of the highest quality
"When I was first a graduate as
sistant [at Ohio State], I had no mon
ey for anything. My first full time job
paid $13,000 and I was ecstatic. We
didn't have strength coaches, we did
n't have full-time trainers," Van-
Derveer explained. "There's so much
more support for women's programs
now."

VanDerveer additionally recog
nized the time commitment that
maintaining a big-time program
required. Whether its watching
film, talking to coaches, meeting
with players, or talking to recruits,
she puts effort into every aspect of

the team.
"I'm probably thinking about [the
team] all the time. Even if I'm walk
ing my dogs I'm on my phone talking
to a coach or somebody," VanDerveer
said. "I go home and I watch video
until 10 o'clock at night. During the
season, it's pretty much every day, al
most all the time."
No matter how harsh a coach
VanDerveer may be on the court, it's
obvious that she enjoys what she
does. She has dedicated her life to
something that she cares deeply
about and goes to any lengths to see
to it that she does her job well.
Jeannette Pohlen 'll remembers
that VanDerveer prepared the team
extremely well for every game.
"Our practices before each game,
we would have teams down to a T, we
would know their plays better than
they would," Pohlen said. "She
watches so much film and has so
much knowledge for the game. It was
an honor playing for her."

Tara VanDerveer was able to
blaze a path for women's athletics
and adapt to the ever-changing land
scape of women's basketball. She has
consistently recruited the top players
in the nation and won two national ti
tles early on in her career at Stan
ford.
However, the national title has
been elusive since then. She's
brought success and status to
women's basketball both nationally
and internationally, but a big ques
tion remains: will she win another na
tional championship? This year, the
season ended at the Sweet 16, but
with all players except one returning,
next year could be the year*.
