This is the first piece of a three
part feature on Shannon Tur
ley, the sport,s performance co
ordinator entering his seventh
season with Stanford football.
Part, I focuses on the team's at
titude, performance, and cul
ture change under Turley's
guidance.
I'm not totally dumbstruck by
Shannon Turley, but I probably
should be.
The Cardinal football strength
coach, now in his seventh year in the
program, has been widely credited
for his role in Stanford's rise as a
football program: the whiz behind
the Cardinal's growing assembly
line of hard-hitting linebackers,
punishing fullbacks, and above
all gigantic offensive linemen.
Toby Gerhart graduates? Stan
ford wins the Orange Bowl. Jim
Harbaugh takes the 49ers job? The
team doesn't miss a beat. Andrew
Luck graduates? Stanford goes

from Fiesta Bowl loss to Rose Bowl
victory. As the $l7 million, 30,000-
square-foot expansion to the Arrilla
ga Family Sports Center rises behind
me a project at least partially in
spired by the newfound success of the
football team Tin-ley's star seems
to be shining brighter than ever.
Paradoxically although Coach
Turley is relatively unknown on
Stanford's campus, he has made a
name for himself outside the Farm:
he is extensively praised by the New
York Times, active in the National
Strength and Conditioning Association
(his online tutorial on pre-workout
warm-ups sells for $29.99 on the NSCA
website, if you're interested) and even
given a shout-out by a former player on
Reddit.
At the same time, however, the
incongruity of the strength coach's
importance and his visibility to those
outside of the program could not be
greater. When a TV camera shows
the strength coach, it will be a first.
