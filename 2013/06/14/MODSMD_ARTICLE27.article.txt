# The 						strength of Stanford football
## 
### WINSTON SHI CONTRIBUTING WRITER Originally published on April 22, 2013 
This is the first piece of a three
part feature on Shannon Tur
ley, the sport,s performance co
ordinator entering his seventh
season with Stanford football.
Part, I focuses on the team's at
titude, performance, and cul
ture change under Turley's
guidance.
I'm not totally dumbstruck by
Shannon Turley, but I probably
should be.
The Cardinal football strength
coach, now in his seventh year in the
program, has been widely credited
for his role in Stanford's rise as a
football program: the whiz behind
the Cardinal's growing assembly
line of hard-hitting linebackers,
punishing fullbacks, and above
all gigantic offensive linemen.
Toby Gerhart graduates? Stan
ford wins the Orange Bowl. Jim
Harbaugh takes the 49ers job? The
team doesn't miss a beat. Andrew
Luck graduates? Stanford goes

from Fiesta Bowl loss to Rose Bowl
victory. As the $l7 million, 30,000-
square-foot expansion to the Arrilla
ga Family Sports Center rises behind
me a project at least partially in
spired by the newfound success of the
football team Tin-ley's star seems
to be shining brighter than ever.
Paradoxically although Coach
Turley is relatively unknown on
Stanford's campus, he has made a
name for himself outside the Farm:
he is extensively praised by the New
York Times, active in the National
Strength and Conditioning Association
(his online tutorial on pre-workout
warm-ups sells for $29.99 on the NSCA
website, if you're interested) and even
given a shout-out by a former player on
Reddit.
At the same time, however, the
incongruity of the strength coach's
importance and his visibility to those
outside of the program could not be
greater. When a TV camera shows
the strength coach, it will be a first.

of college football. Turley is entering his seventh year on the Farm.
preceded him; in fact, he seemed like
the archetypal strength and condi
tioning coach. That implied a few
things: toughness, direction and dis
cipline— and especially the latter;
during Bennie Wylie's tenure as
Texas Tech's strength coach, a com
mon punishment for miscreants was
to run around the Texas Tech cam
pus holding cinderblocks above then
heads.
In his office, it quickly turned out
that Shannon Turley is a perfectly
nice man, certainly kind enough to
invite me into his office for an hour
on a beautiful California morning.
Although his job entails giving or
ders to men nearly twice his size, he
exudes an aura of reassuring nor
malcy; if you took the Stanford logos
off his clothes, he would have no
problem blending into a crowd. But
he also has muscles.
As the saying goes, coaches who
have never played lack a certain
credibility. A former track athlete at
Virginia Tech, Turley exhibits a cer
tain economy of movement that
seems to be a prerequisite for athlet
ic success, although a little later he
will ruefully refer to himself as a
"no-talent never-was."
Indeed, Turley's commitment to
efficiency is reflected everywhere he
goes. When entering his office, one
wonders, Where did he find space
for the chair? The room has win
dows on three sides looking out on
to the weight room, and what re
mains of the walls is covered with
posters, notes, and bookcases
stuffed to overflowing. Boxes and
boxes of mystery materials are
stacked wherever space allows. And
while Thrley meticulously files and
stacks his paperwork, he clearly
needs another desk.
There is something vaguely re
sembling a spaceship in the corner.
Turley explains that it analyzes a
player's body composition.
However, what truly stands out
to me, even now as I write this, is his
ability to speak. Shannon Turley has
the rare gift of never being at a loss
for words; he talks faster than any
man I have ever met; I've spent sev
en or so hours transcribing the in
terview recording onto Microsoft
Word and the final product comes
out to 17 pages and more than
10,000 words.
Phew.

Strength and conditioning coach
es like Turley occupy a strange place
in the often byzantine hierarchy of
college football.
The first thing to keep in mind:
"I'm not a football coach," Turley ex
plains.
At the same time, however,
strength coaches are the foundation
of the football program, tasked with
producing the players that make the
difference between winning and los
ing. From Pop Warner youth football
to the NFL, every football coach in
America knows that, without play
ers that can compete, his playbook
means nothing. After signing Mick
ey Mariotti from Florida, Ohio State
Head Coach Urban Meyer went so
far as to say in the New York Times,
"You can't function in today's era of
college football without a superstar
as a weight coach... That's more im
portant than a coordinator or a line

coach."
This importance has only deep
ened in recent years. In accordance
with NCAA regulations, only
strength coaches are allowed to con
duct conditioning practices during
the offseason. Scholarship limits
have forced today's thinner and
more short-handed teams to pay
more attention to injury prevention
as well. For these reasons, strength
coaches like Turley have become
more critical for programs seeking
to gain the upper hand. Although
college football has been around
since 1869, the first paid football
strength coach was Nebraska's
Boyd Epley a full hundred years lat
er; in 2011, the average SEC team
(excluding Vanderbilt, which doesn't
report its salaries) paid its condition
ing staff approximately $375,000 per
year, and Meyer is paying Mariotti
alone even more than that.
This surge in salaries is even
more reflective of the fact that a
strength coach is expected to set the
tone of the entire program. The con
ditioning staff has the most access
to the players and therefore the
most connections and personal in
fluence.
"We're not around the coaches
all year round," fifth-year senior
linebacker Alex Debniak said.
"We're around Turley and his staff.
So I would really attribute a great
amount of our personality change to
him and him alone, and obviously
whoever else works with him."
Offensive guard Andrew
Phillips, who was a freshman during
the disastrous 2006 season, explains
that when the coaching staff was
switched after 2006, changes were
immediately felt: there were no
more excuses.
"If you watch the [2006] season,
we were about five plays away from
being competitive in every game,
and football's a crazy game in that
those five plays can make a differ
ence. And in our case, watching this
team, 15,20,30 plays made a differ
ence for a one-win season," Phillips
said. "[When the new coaching staff
came,] expectations were raised. It
wasn't, 'Hey, if we have some time,
let's win a couple football games.'"
Indeed, Stanford is a case in
point: the remarkable turnaround
of the Cardinal program from 1-11
in 2006 to Rose Bowl champions in
2012-13 could not have occurred
with an attitude and cultural change
from top to bottom. I ask Ibrley
about this, and he points to the
posters behind him: lists of team
goals ("covenants," in football parl
ance) from different year's in Tur
ley's tenure. The first covenant is
approximately the size of a door.
"Look up here, in 2007," he ex
plains. "We had a lot of outcome
goals. That was our mission to
win the next game, to have a win
ning record, earn a bowl berth, win
the Pac-10 title, win a national title
those were our goals. And then
look at all those rules. You see that?
On the field and practice and games,
these are the things we're going to
have to do. Off the field, at home, at
school, social settings, the class
room this is how we're going to
have to operate off the field. In life
in general, this is how we're going to
have to operate."
"2008. Another losing team. See
all the rules? In our second year
we're still asking guys to believe in
and buy into Stanford football, to
trust in their coaches and their
teammates and the directions of

Stanford football; to approach their
training, practice, and games with
the desire to be great —do you
think these are conversations we
have to have with our players now?"
They aren't.

According to the unofficial num
ber-one rule of Stanford condition
ing, a technician is a teammate who
trains and competes with a detailed
focus and commitment to the
process in relentless pursuit of
championship-caliber performance.
How do you turn a cellar
dweller, routinely mocked by those
outside of the program, into a confi
dently imposing college football
powerhouse?
Culture change comes from a lot
of different places, but often just
from changing perspective on the
situation at hand. Some are obvious:
for example, ever since Pop Warner
(who won the 1926 National Cham
pionship with the Cardinal, then the
Indians) left Palo Alto complaining
about Stanford's academic require
ments, the Admissions Office had
been a handy scapegoat for coaches
and sports pundits alike. Regard
less of the reason, there was a sense
of inevitability to Stanford's football
program hover around .500, oc
casionally make a Rose Bowl, be
good enough to beat Cal and noth
ing more and in some players'
words, that inevitability bred a cul
ture of lackadaisicalness.
As Turley explains, it took time
for the players to buy into the new
staff's vision, especially Turley's
own particular vision of the "techni
cian" ideal. During the first spring
(in 2007), the staff literally banned
the team from saying "I," "me," or
"my." Phillips elaborates on one of
the first times he realized that Tbr
ley was truly determined to change
the attitude of Stanford football:
"Coach Harbaugh has just come
in [in spring 2007], They're out on
the practice field, they're about to
get into a set of sprints, and Coach
Turley's out there in shorts and a T
shirt, and it starts pouring rain, ab
solutely out of nowhere. Just torren
tially pouring rain. And we all start
looking at each other like, oh gosh
it's terrible, oh no, what are we
going to do, somebody's going to
tear their groin, it's going to be
awful, we're going to be cold."
'And Coach Turley says, 'Well,
boys, sometimes it rains. Get on the
line.'"
The rest, to oversimplify, is history.
As Stanford's players coalesced
into a formidable unit of mass de
struction, self-discipline was always
at the core of that cohesion.
"There was kind of a lack of
mental discipline and a lack of
toughness," said Debniak, who en
tered the program in Turley's first
year. "A lot of people fell off from the
side; a lot of people gave up and
quit, and [Turley] kind of weeded us
out. And I'm proud to say that I'm
part of really one of the first two or
three classes that came and really
turned things around."
Turley reciprocates Debniak's
sentiment in turn.
"I've gotten to be a part of great
teams and got to know some great
people and I love what I do, so it's
not really a job, it's not really work
to me there's nothing else I
would rather do with my time than
this."

being competitive in every game,
and football's a crazy game in that
those five plays can make a differ

team, 15,20,30 plays made a differ

said. "[When the new coaching staff
came,] expectations were raised. It
wasn't, 'Hey, if we have some time,
let's win a couple football games.'"
Indeed, Stanford is a case in
point: the remarkable turnaround
of the Cardinal program from 1-11
in 2006 to Rose Bowl champions in
2012-13 could not have occurred

about this, and he points to the

goals ("covenants," in football parl

approximately the size of a door.

look at all those rules. You see that?
On the field and practice and games,

have to do. Off the field, at home, at
school, social settings, the class

have to operate off the field. In life

"2008. Another losing team. See

How do you turn a cellar

Culture change comes from a lot
of different places, but often just
from changing perspective on the
situation at hand. Some are obvious:
for example, ever since Pop Warner
(who won the 1926 National Cham

Indians) left Palo Alto complaining
about Stanford's academic require

As Turley explains, it took time
for the players to buy into the new
staff's vision, especially Turley's
own particular vision of the "techni

the team from saying "I," "me," or

"Coach Harbaugh has just come
in [in spring 2007], They're out on
the practice field, they're about to
get into a set of sprints, and Coach
Turley's out there in shorts and a T
shirt, and it starts pouring rain, ab
solutely out of nowhere. Just torren
tially pouring rain. And we all start
looking at each other like, oh gosh
it's terrible, oh no, what are we
going to do, somebody's going to
tear their groin, it's going to be
awful, we're going to be cold."
'And Coach Turley says, 'Well,
boys, sometimes it rains. Get on the
line.'"
The rest, to oversimplify, is history.
As Stanford's players coalesced
into a formidable unit of mass de
struction, self-discipline was always
at the core of that cohesion.
"There was kind of a lack of
mental discipline and a lack of
toughness," said Debniak, who en
tered the program in Turley's first
year. "A lot of people fell off from the
side; a lot of people gave up and
quit, and [Turley] kind of weeded us
out. And I'm proud to say that I'm
part of really one of the first two or
three classes that came and really
turned things around."
Turley reciprocates Debniak's

"I've gotten to be a part of great
teams and got to know some great

not really a job, it's not really work

Before the interview itself, it was
clear that Coach Turley's reputation

Strength and conditioning coach Shannon Turley (above) is widely
credited for being one of the keys to Stanford football's rise to the top
of college football. Turley is entering his seventh year on the Farm.
preceded him; in fact, he seemed like
the archetypal strength and condi
tioning coach. That implied a few
things: toughness, direction and dis
cipline— and especially the latter;
during Bennie Wylie's tenure as
Texas Tech's strength coach, a com
mon punishment for miscreants was
to run around the Texas Tech cam
pus holding cinderblocks above then
heads.
In his office, it quickly turned out
that Shannon Turley is a perfectly
nice man, certainly kind enough to
invite me into his office for an hour
on a beautiful California morning.
Although his job entails giving or
ders to men nearly twice his size, he
exudes an aura of reassuring nor
malcy; if you took the Stanford logos
off his clothes, he would have no
problem blending into a crowd. But
he also has muscles.
As the saying goes, coaches who
have never played lack a certain
credibility. A former track athlete at
Virginia Tech, Turley exhibits a cer
tain economy of movement that
seems to be a prerequisite for athlet
ic success, although a little later he
will ruefully refer to himself as a
"no-talent never-was."
Indeed, Turley's commitment to
efficiency is reflected everywhere he
goes. When entering his office, one
wonders, Where did he find space
for the chair? The room has win
dows on three sides looking out on
to the weight room, and what re
mains of the walls is covered with
posters, notes, and bookcases
stuffed to overflowing. Boxes and
boxes of mystery materials are
stacked wherever space allows. And
while Thrley meticulously files and
stacks his paperwork, he clearly
needs another desk.
There is something vaguely re
sembling a spaceship in the corner.
Turley explains that it analyzes a
player's body composition.
However, what truly stands out
to me, even now as I write this, is his
ability to speak. Shannon Turley has
the rare gift of never being at a loss
for words; he talks faster than any
man I have ever met; I've spent sev
en or so hours transcribing the in
terview recording onto Microsoft
Word and the final product comes
out to 17 pages and more than
10,000 words.
Phew.

♦ ♦♦
Strength and conditioning coach
es like Turley occupy a strange place
in the often byzantine hierarchy of
college football.
The first thing to keep in mind:
"I'm not a football coach," Turley ex
plains.
At the same time, however,
strength coaches are the foundation
of the football program, tasked with
producing the players that make the
difference between winning and los
ing. From Pop Warner youth football
to the NFL, every football coach in
America knows that, without play
ers that can compete, his playbook
means nothing. After signing Mick
ey Mariotti from Florida, Ohio State
Head Coach Urban Meyer went so
far as to say in the New York Times,
"You can't function in today's era of
college football without a superstar
as a weight coach... That's more im
portant than a coordinator or a line

coach."
This importance has only deep
ened in recent years. In accordance
with NCAA regulations, only
strength coaches are allowed to con
duct conditioning practices during
the offseason. Scholarship limits
have forced today's thinner and
more short-handed teams to pay
more attention to injury prevention
as well. For these reasons, strength
coaches like Turley have become
more critical for programs seeking
to gain the upper hand. Although
college football has been around
since 1869, the first paid football
strength coach was Nebraska's
Boyd Epley a full hundred years lat
er; in 2011, the average SEC team
(excluding Vanderbilt, which doesn't
report its salaries) paid its condition
ing staff approximately $375,000 per
year, and Meyer is paying Mariotti
alone even more than that.
This surge in salaries is even
more reflective of the fact that a
strength coach is expected to set the
tone of the entire program. The con
ditioning staff has the most access
to the players and therefore the
most connections and personal in
fluence.
"We're not around the coaches
all year round," fifth-year senior
linebacker Alex Debniak said.
"We're around Turley and his staff.
So I would really attribute a great
amount of our personality change to
him and him alone, and obviously
whoever else works with him."
Offensive guard Andrew
Phillips, who was a freshman during
the disastrous 2006 season, explains
that when the coaching staff was
switched after 2006, changes were
immediately felt: there were no
more excuses.
"If you watch the [2006] season,
we were about five plays away from
being competitive in every game,
and football's a crazy game in that
those five plays can make a differ

Before the interview itself, it was
clear that Coach Turley's reputation

of college football. Turley is entering his seventh year on the Farm.
preceded him; in fact, he seemed like
the archetypal strength and condi
tioning coach. That implied a few
things: toughness, direction and dis
cipline— and especially the latter;
during Bennie Wylie's tenure as
Texas Tech's strength coach, a com
mon punishment for miscreants was
to run around the Texas Tech cam
pus holding cinderblocks above then
heads.
In his office, it quickly turned out
that Shannon Turley is a perfectly
nice man, certainly kind enough to
invite me into his office for an hour
on a beautiful California morning.
Although his job entails giving or
ders to men nearly twice his size, he
exudes an aura of reassuring nor
malcy; if you took the Stanford logos
off his clothes, he would have no
problem blending into a crowd. But
he also has muscles.
As the saying goes, coaches who
have never played lack a certain
credibility. A former track athlete at
Virginia Tech, Turley exhibits a cer
tain economy of movement that
seems to be a prerequisite for athlet
ic success, although a little later he
will ruefully refer to himself as a
"no-talent never-was."
Indeed, Turley's commitment to
efficiency is reflected everywhere he
goes. When entering his office, one
wonders, Where did he find space
for the chair? The room has win
dows on three sides looking out on
to the weight room, and what re
mains of the walls is covered with
posters, notes, and bookcases
stuffed to overflowing. Boxes and
boxes of mystery materials are
stacked wherever space allows. And
while Thrley meticulously files and
stacks his paperwork, he clearly
needs another desk.
There is something vaguely re
sembling a spaceship in the corner.
Turley explains that it analyzes a
player's body composition.
However, what truly stands out
to me, even now as I write this, is his
ability to speak. Shannon Turley has
the rare gift of never being at a loss
for words; he talks faster than any
man I have ever met; I've spent sev
en or so hours transcribing the in
terview recording onto Microsoft
Word and the final product comes
out to 17 pages and more than
10,000 words.
Phew.

Strength and conditioning coach
es like Turley occupy a strange place
in the often byzantine hierarchy of
college football.
The first thing to keep in mind:
"I'm not a football coach," Turley ex
plains.
At the same time, however,
strength coaches are the foundation
of the football program, tasked with
producing the players that make the
difference between winning and los
ing. From Pop Warner youth football
to the NFL, every football coach in
America knows that, without play
ers that can compete, his playbook
means nothing. After signing Mick
ey Mariotti from Florida, Ohio State
Head Coach Urban Meyer went so
far as to say in the New York Times,
"You can't function in today's era of
college football without a superstar
as a weight coach... That's more im
portant than a coordinator or a line

coach."
This importance has only deep
ened in recent years. In accordance
with NCAA regulations, only
strength coaches are allowed to con
duct conditioning practices during
the offseason. Scholarship limits
have forced today's thinner and
more short-handed teams to pay
more attention to injury prevention
as well. For these reasons, strength
coaches like Turley have become
more critical for programs seeking
to gain the upper hand. Although
college football has been around
since 1869, the first paid football
strength coach was Nebraska's
Boyd Epley a full hundred years lat
er; in 2011, the average SEC team
(excluding Vanderbilt, which doesn't
report its salaries) paid its condition
ing staff approximately $375,000 per
year, and Meyer is paying Mariotti
alone even more than that.
This surge in salaries is even
more reflective of the fact that a
strength coach is expected to set the
tone of the entire program. The con
ditioning staff has the most access
to the players and therefore the
most connections and personal in
fluence.
"We're not around the coaches
all year round," fifth-year senior
linebacker Alex Debniak said.
"We're around Turley and his staff.
So I would really attribute a great
amount of our personality change to
him and him alone, and obviously
whoever else works with him."
Offensive guard Andrew
Phillips, who was a freshman during
the disastrous 2006 season, explains
that when the coaching staff was
switched after 2006, changes were
immediately felt: there were no
more excuses.
"If you watch the [2006] season,
we were about five plays away from
being competitive in every game,
and football's a crazy game in that
those five plays can make a differ
ence. And in our case, watching this
team, 15,20,30 plays made a differ
ence for a one-win season," Phillips
said. "[When the new coaching staff
came,] expectations were raised. It
wasn't, 'Hey, if we have some time,
let's win a couple football games.'"
Indeed, Stanford is a case in
point: the remarkable turnaround
of the Cardinal program from 1-11
in 2006 to Rose Bowl champions in
2012-13 could not have occurred
with an attitude and cultural change
from top to bottom. I ask Ibrley
about this, and he points to the
posters behind him: lists of team
goals ("covenants," in football parl
ance) from different year's in Tur
ley's tenure. The first covenant is
approximately the size of a door.
"Look up here, in 2007," he ex
plains. "We had a lot of outcome
goals. That was our mission to
win the next game, to have a win
ning record, earn a bowl berth, win
the Pac-10 title, win a national title
those were our goals. And then
look at all those rules. You see that?
On the field and practice and games,
these are the things we're going to
have to do. Off the field, at home, at
school, social settings, the class
room this is how we're going to
have to operate off the field. In life
in general, this is how we're going to
have to operate."
"2008. Another losing team. See
all the rules? In our second year
we're still asking guys to believe in
and buy into Stanford football, to
trust in their coaches and their
teammates and the directions of

Stanford football; to approach their
training, practice, and games with
the desire to be great —do you
think these are conversations we
have to have with our players now?"
They aren't.

According to the unofficial num
ber-one rule of Stanford condition
ing, a technician is a teammate who
trains and competes with a detailed
focus and commitment to the
process in relentless pursuit of
championship-caliber performance.
How do you turn a cellar
dweller, routinely mocked by those
outside of the program, into a confi
dently imposing college football
powerhouse?
Culture change comes from a lot
of different places, but often just
from changing perspective on the
situation at hand. Some are obvious:
for example, ever since Pop Warner
(who won the 1926 National Cham
pionship with the Cardinal, then the
Indians) left Palo Alto complaining
about Stanford's academic require
ments, the Admissions Office had
been a handy scapegoat for coaches
and sports pundits alike. Regard
less of the reason, there was a sense
of inevitability to Stanford's football
program hover around .500, oc
casionally make a Rose Bowl, be
good enough to beat Cal and noth
ing more and in some players'
words, that inevitability bred a cul
ture of lackadaisicalness.
As Turley explains, it took time
for the players to buy into the new
staff's vision, especially Turley's
own particular vision of the "techni
cian" ideal. During the first spring
(in 2007), the staff literally banned
the team from saying "I," "me," or
"my." Phillips elaborates on one of
the first times he realized that Tbr
ley was truly determined to change
the attitude of Stanford football:
"Coach Harbaugh has just come
in [in spring 2007], They're out on
the practice field, they're about to
get into a set of sprints, and Coach
Turley's out there in shorts and a T
shirt, and it starts pouring rain, ab
solutely out of nowhere. Just torren
tially pouring rain. And we all start
looking at each other like, oh gosh
it's terrible, oh no, what are we
going to do, somebody's going to
tear their groin, it's going to be
awful, we're going to be cold."
'And Coach Turley says, 'Well,
boys, sometimes it rains. Get on the
line.'"
The rest, to oversimplify, is history.
As Stanford's players coalesced
into a formidable unit of mass de
struction, self-discipline was always
at the core of that cohesion.
"There was kind of a lack of
mental discipline and a lack of
toughness," said Debniak, who en
tered the program in Turley's first
year. "A lot of people fell off from the
side; a lot of people gave up and
quit, and [Turley] kind of weeded us
out. And I'm proud to say that I'm
part of really one of the first two or
three classes that came and really
turned things around."
Turley reciprocates Debniak's
sentiment in turn.
"I've gotten to be a part of great
teams and got to know some great
people and I love what I do, so it's
not really a job, it's not really work
to me there's nothing else I
would rather do with my time than
this."

This is the first piece of a three
part feature on Shannon Tur
ley, the sport,s performance co
ordinator entering his seventh
season with Stanford football.
Part, I focuses on the team's at
titude, performance, and cul
ture change under Turley's
guidance.
I'm not totally dumbstruck by
Shannon Turley, but I probably
should be.
The Cardinal football strength
coach, now in his seventh year in the
program, has been widely credited
for his role in Stanford's rise as a
football program: the whiz behind
the Cardinal's growing assembly
line of hard-hitting linebackers,
punishing fullbacks, and above
all gigantic offensive linemen.
Toby Gerhart graduates? Stan
ford wins the Orange Bowl. Jim
Harbaugh takes the 49ers job? The
team doesn't miss a beat. Andrew
Luck graduates? Stanford goes

from Fiesta Bowl loss to Rose Bowl
victory. As the $l7 million, 30,000-
square-foot expansion to the Arrilla
ga Family Sports Center rises behind
me a project at least partially in
spired by the newfound success of the
football team Tin-ley's star seems
to be shining brighter than ever.
Paradoxically although Coach
Turley is relatively unknown on
Stanford's campus, he has made a
name for himself outside the Farm:
he is extensively praised by the New
York Times, active in the National
Strength and Conditioning Association
(his online tutorial on pre-workout
warm-ups sells for $29.99 on the NSCA
website, if you're interested) and even
given a shout-out by a former player on
Reddit.
At the same time, however, the
incongruity of the strength coach's
importance and his visibility to those
outside of the program could not be
greater. When a TV camera shows
