# W. WATER POLO
## Card falls short in classic final 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR Originally published on May 13, 2013 
The Stanford women's water po
lo team's season came to an end in
heartbreaking fashion on Sunday
afternoon in Boston as the No. 2
Cardinal lost 10-9 to No. 1 USC in
the fifth overtime period of the na
tional championship game the
longest women's water polo NCAA
championship game in history.
Stanford finished the season 29-3,
with all three losses coming at the
hands of the Women of Troy.
The Cardinal had won the previ
ous two national titles, but the
chance at a three-peat ended
abruptly when USC freshmen Anni
Espar fired home a shot in the third
period of sudden-death overtime
and the fifth overtime period over
all.

Stanford led for the majority of
the game before USC put together
a furious comeback late in the sec
ond half. After the Women of Troy
took their first lead in the final
minute, Stanford sophomore Ash
ley Grossman scored with 12 sec
onds left in the game to force over
time.
Stanford had the better scoring
opportunities throughout the game,
but USC's efficiency on the power
play combined with USC goalkeep
er Flora Bolonyai's 17 saves ulti
mately proved to be the difference.
The Cardinal reached the final
game by crushing lona 20-3 in the
first round of the tournament and
then sliding past UCLA 5-3 in the
semifinals to set up a fourth meet
ing with the Trojans this season.
Coming into the game, USC had won
two of three previous meetings, includ
ing an 11-7 victory in the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation (MPSF) Tour
nament Final on April 28.
Before the weekend, Stanford
head coach John Tanner had said
that getting off to a quick start

would be key for his team. The Car
dinal took that message to heart in
the championship game as they
broke out to a 3-0 lead early in the
second quarter behind goals from
freshman Maggie Steffens, senior
Melissa Seidemann and junior Ka
ley Dodson.
Early in the game, Stanford's
defense completely stifled USC's at
tack and allowed very few clean looks
at goal. When shots did get through,
senior goalkeeper Kate Baldoni, who
made 11 saves on the day, was there to
keep the ball out of the net.
The Women of Troy finally got
on the scoreboard on a 6-on-5 op
portunity with 6:05 remaining in the
first half and then added a second
goal a minute later when USC's
Nicolina McCall backhanded a shot
past Baldoni. After Stanford sopho
more Kiley Neushul put away an
outside shot, USC's Madeline
Rosenthal took advantage of anoth
er power play opportunity to make
the score 4-3 going into halftime.
The back-and-forth action con
tinued after the break as the Cardi
nal maintained the lead but was un
able to pull away. Dodson and Sei
demann both scored in the third
quarter, but after each tally USC
junior Hannah Buckling who
had a game-high five goals an
swered to keep USC within one.
Stanford clung to its 6-5 lead
deep into the fourth quarter until
Buckling came up big once again.
With just under two minutes to go
in the game and two seconds on the
shot clock, the junior skipped a long
shot past Baldoni to tie the game
for the first time since 0-0.
USC capped off the comeback
when Espar scored to give USC a 7-
6 lead with just 45 seconds remain
ing the game the first time the
Trojans had led all game.
On the ensuing possession, the
Cardinal drew an exclusion and
coach John Tanner called timeout.
Junior Annika Dries had the first
attempt for Stanford, but Bolonyai
made a huge save to preserve the
lead. The Cardinal maintained pos
session and worked the ball inside
to Grossman, who poked it past

hopes alive.

NCAA rules dictate that
once teams enter overtime,
they will play two three
minute periods regardless of
score. If the game is still tied
after the guaranteed six
minutes, then sudden death
comes into play.
USC scored to open over
time, but Steffens added her
second goal with 10 seconds
remaining in the first period.
Dodson, who won all eight
sprints on the day, gave the
Cardinal possession to open
the second period and Stan
ford took advantage when
Seidemann put away her
third goal of the game to
give the Cardinal a 9-8 lead.
But another Stanford ex
clusion gave USC the chance
to tie and Buckling capital
ized once again to even the
game with 55 seconds to go.
Both defenses locked
down as they entered sud
den-death overtime. Stan
ford continually forced USC
into turnovers or weak at
tempts at goal, but was un
able to take advantage at the
other end. In the second
sudden-death period, USC
had close to a minute of sus
tained possession but Bal
doni and her defense stood
tall. When the Cardinal fi
nally got the ball, Seide-

Mann fired two rockets that
hit the crossbar and stayed
out.

In the fifth period of
overtime, the Cardinal
seemed to be on the verge of
breaking through as Seide
mann, Dries and Steffens all
had good looks at goal, but
Bolonyai came up big time
and time again to keep the
ball out.
After more than 45 min
utes of play, Espar finally
ended the game by placing
an outside shot past Baldoni,
off the crossbar and down in
to the net, and with that, the
Cardinal's hopes of a three
peat were extinguished.
Although the Cardinal
only lost three games all
year, a team that was billed
as potentially one of the best
teams in collegiate water po
lo history ends the season in
disappointment after failing
to capture either the confer
ence or the national title.
The loss also puts the
Stanford athletic program's
record of 36 straight years
with a national champi
onship at risk. The Cardinal
has yet to win an NCAA title
in 2012-13 the synchro
nized swimming national ti
tle came from U.S. Colle
giate competition and
many observers believed
that the women's water polo
team was Stanford's last le
gitimate chance at earning a
championship this year.
