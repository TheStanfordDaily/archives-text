# SOCCER FALLS IN SEMIS

The parallels were there. After a
hard-fought match on a wet field, Stan
ford, wearing black, needed a missed
kick to help defeat its baby-blue rivals.
But while the football team booked a
ticket to the Rose Bowl after a late field
goal miss from UCLA, the women's soc
cer team's season ended Friday night
when North Carolina's Kealia Ohai
scored in the 104 th minute to give the
Tar Heels a 1-0 win.
The No. 1 Cardinal (21-2-1), the de
fending national champion, came out
with a vengeance against the No. 13 Tar
Heels, a team it had never beaten in 11
tries. Although neither team scored in
regular time, it was not for lack of try
ing.

In the 13th minute, senior captain
Mariah Nogueira produced a rocket
header from a Stanford corner kick, but
the Tar Heels cleared the ball off the
goal line. In the 26th minute, sophomore
Chioma Übogagu beat four UNC de
fenders and stroked a shot that went
just wide.
The Tar Heels had chances as well in
a first half that was played at a track
meet pace. The Cardinal defense, led by
recently named Ail-Americans seniors
Rachel Quon and Alina Garciamendez,
did well to keep the game scoreless go
ing into halftime.
The second half was more of the
same. Two minutes after intermission, a
free kick from Garciamendez skidded
through the Tar Heels defense, but Übo
gagu couldn't get a full foot on the shot.
Two minutes later, it was sophomore
Lo'eau Laßonta with the opportunity.
After UNC cleared a corner kick, Stan
ford senior Madeleine Thompson sent a
long ball back in. Laßonta snuck behind
the UNC defense, but her chip attempt
went just over the crossbar.
"That first one where I won on the
second ball, that keeper she had, proba
bly had one of the saves of her lives
that was very frustrating," Laßonta
said. "And then I had a couple of others
that I should have put away."
Both teams continued to attack with
speed but struggled to execute the final
play. Both coaches also substituted fre
quently to keep up with the breakneck
pace. At one point in the second half, the
Tar Heels had six starters off the field,
but Stanford was unable to capitalize.

Goalkeeper Emily Oliver had a huge
game for the Cardinal, collecting 10
saves on the day. The Tar Heels had op
portunities from everywhere, but the
junior handled everything cleanly no
small feat as consistent rain made for
slippery conditions.
"I was trying to just do my part,"
Oliver said. "That said, I think our back
line was solid. Everyone left their heart
out on the field tonight, and I'm really
proud of our team."
Stanford junior Sydney Payne had
two great looks at goal inside the final 10
minutes. With eight minutes left, Übo
gagu's dribbling set up Payne just inside
the corner of the penalty box. The for
ward's shot bent towards the far corner
but wasn't fast enough to beat UNC goal
keeper Adelaide Gay. Seconds later, Payne
had another opportunity from the same
spot. While this shot had enough power
behind it, it skidded just past the far post.
After North Carolina cleared a last
gasp Cardinal free kick, the game head
ed into sudden-death overtime.
Halfway through the first of two 10-
minute overtimes, Tar Heels junior
Crystal Dunn broke down the Cardinal
defense and laid a pass back to midfield
er Amber Brooks. The senior fired a
missile that appeared locked on to the
back of the net, but Oliver made a
tremendous dive to deflect the ball over
the crossbar.
Toward the end of the first overtime,
North Carolina increased the pressure.
That continued through the brief inter
mission as seconds into the second over
time, Ohai had a breakaway opportunity
down the right side. Oliver knocked
down the first shot and the Cardinal de
fense cleared the rebound.

Unfortunately for Stanford, it could
only rely on Oliver's heroics for so long.
With six minutes remaining before
penalty kicks, it was Dunn and Ohai
again leading the attack. Dunn slipped a
clever pass behind the Cardinal defense,
and this time, Ohai didn't miss. The sen
ior All-American calmly placed her shot
inside the far post to put the Tar Heels
into the national championship game
and send the Cardinal back to Palo Alto.
"It was a disappointing end to a
great year," said Stanford head coach
Paul Ratcliffe. "It's always difficult to
lose in overtime because you can't make
any changes or do anything to get back
into the game because the game is over
with one kick of the ball."
Redshirt junior Courtney Verloo,
who will return next year for her final
year of eligibility, gave credit to North
Carolina for them high-pressure attack.
"I think we battled back just as
strong and gave everything that we
had," Verloo said. "It was unfortunate
that we couldn't come out with the re
sult tonight."
Stanford ends the season with a 21-2-
1 record and the Pac-12 championship.
The team's 10 seniors end them four years
with a 94-4-4 record, four Pac-10/12 cham
pionships, four Final Four appearances
and the 2011 national championship.
"When you look at their overall
record, through their four years, it's
pretty remarkable," Ratcliffe said. "I'm
really thankful that they won the champi
onship last year, because they're defi
nitely champions. No doubt in my
mind."

header from a Stanford corner kick, but
the Tar Heels cleared the ball off the
goal line. In the 26th minute, sophomore
Chioma Übogagu beat four UNC de
fenders and stroked a shot that went
just wide.
The Tar Heels had chances as well in
a first half that was played at a track
meet pace. The Cardinal defense, led by
recently named Ail-Americans seniors
Rachel Quon and Alina Garciamendez,
did well to keep the game scoreless go
ing into halftime.
The second half was more of the
same. Two minutes after intermission, a
free kick from Garciamendez skidded
through the Tar Heels defense, but Übo
gagu couldn't get a full foot on the shot.
Two minutes later, it was sophomore
Lo'eau Laßonta with the opportunity.
After UNC cleared a corner kick, Stan
ford senior Madeleine Thompson sent a
long ball back in. Laßonta snuck behind
the UNC defense, but her chip attempt
went just over the crossbar.
"That first one where I won on the
second ball, that keeper she had, proba
bly had one of the saves of her lives
that was very frustrating," Laßonta
said. "And then I had a couple of others
that I should have put away."
Both teams continued to attack with
speed but struggled to execute the final
play. Both coaches also substituted fre
quently to keep up with the breakneck
pace. At one point in the second half, the
Tar Heels had six starters off the field,
but Stanford was unable to capitalize.

Goalkeeper Emily Oliver had a huge
game for the Cardinal, collecting 10
saves on the day. The Tar Heels had op
portunities from everywhere, but the
junior handled everything cleanly no
small feat as consistent rain made for
slippery conditions.
"I was trying to just do my part,"
Oliver said. "That said, I think our back
line was solid. Everyone left their heart
out on the field tonight, and I'm really
proud of our team."
Stanford junior Sydney Payne had
two great looks at goal inside the final 10
minutes. With eight minutes left, Übo
gagu's dribbling set up Payne just inside
the corner of the penalty box. The for
ward's shot bent towards the far corner
but wasn't fast enough to beat UNC goal
keeper Adelaide Gay. Seconds later, Payne
had another opportunity from the same
spot. While this shot had enough power
behind it, it skidded just past the far post.
After North Carolina cleared a last
gasp Cardinal free kick, the game head
ed into sudden-death overtime.
Halfway through the first of two 10-
minute overtimes, Tar Heels junior
Crystal Dunn broke down the Cardinal
defense and laid a pass back to midfield
er Amber Brooks. The senior fired a
missile that appeared locked on to the
back of the net, but Oliver made a
tremendous dive to deflect the ball over
the crossbar.
Toward the end of the first overtime,
North Carolina increased the pressure.
That continued through the brief inter
mission as seconds into the second over
time, Ohai had a breakaway opportunity
down the right side. Oliver knocked
down the first shot and the Cardinal de
fense cleared the rebound.

Unfortunately for Stanford, it could
only rely on Oliver's heroics for so long.
With six minutes remaining before
penalty kicks, it was Dunn and Ohai
again leading the attack. Dunn slipped a
clever pass behind the Cardinal defense,
and this time, Ohai didn't miss. The sen
ior All-American calmly placed her shot
inside the far post to put the Tar Heels
into the national championship game
and send the Cardinal back to Palo Alto.
"It was a disappointing end to a
great year," said Stanford head coach
Paul Ratcliffe. "It's always difficult to
lose in overtime because you can't make
any changes or do anything to get back
into the game because the game is over
with one kick of the ball."
Redshirt junior Courtney Verloo,
who will return next year for her final
year of eligibility, gave credit to North
Carolina for them high-pressure attack.
"I think we battled back just as
strong and gave everything that we
had," Verloo said. "It was unfortunate
that we couldn't come out with the re
sult tonight."
Stanford ends the season with a 21-2-
1 record and the Pac-12 championship.
The team's 10 seniors end them four years
with a 94-4-4 record, four Pac-10/12 cham
pionships, four Final Four appearances
and the 2011 national championship.
"When you look at their overall
record, through their four years, it's
pretty remarkable," Ratcliffe said. "I'm
really thankful that they won the champi
onship last year, because they're defi
nitely champions. No doubt in my
mind."

Senior defender Alina Garciamendez (right) and the rest of the Class of 2013
ended their historic collegiate careers with a 1-0 overtime loss to UNC in the
semifinals of the College Cup. Stanford was the defending NCAA champion.
Originally published on Dec. 1, 2012.

The parallels were there. After a
hard-fought match on a wet field, Stan
ford, wearing black, needed a missed
kick to help defeat its baby-blue rivals.
But while the football team booked a
ticket to the Rose Bowl after a late field
goal miss from UCLA, the women's soc
cer team's season ended Friday night
when North Carolina's Kealia Ohai
scored in the 104 th minute to give the
Tar Heels a 1-0 win.
The No. 1 Cardinal (21-2-1), the de
fending national champion, came out
with a vengeance against the No. 13 Tar
Heels, a team it had never beaten in 11
tries. Although neither team scored in
regular time, it was not for lack of try
ing.

In the 13th minute, senior captain
Mariah Nogueira produced a rocket
