Frank Hassan has been head chef
in Suites' Bollard Eating Club for
seven years, and he specializes in
making two things: an incredible
breakfast and memories.

It's the former you'll get if you walk into
Bollard between 7:30 and 9:15 a.m. week
day mornings, where dozens of students
chatter under an enormous banner
erected by unknown admirers at some point
over the past decade featuring Frank's
beaming face and the club's informal title:
"The Bollard Empire."
But it's the memories that last, and over
the three years I've eaten and worked at
Suites, I've picked up quite a few: Frank
volunteering to wake up two hours early to
have breakfast ready for the track team by
5:30 a.m. the days we left early for out-of
state meets; Frank and I watching the
Mubarak regime fall on the Bollard TV
while he offered keen political observations
on his native Egypt; the way he enthusiasti
cally greets every male student with a heav
ily accented "my main man!" and every fe
male with a "good morning, beautiful";
Frank giving my mom a big hug when I
brought her to Bollard to visit during my
junior year.

I'll take those memories with me when I
finally leave Stanford this spring. It's hard
enough knowing I may never come back,
but this year is an especially difficult one in
which to say goodbye. That's because next
fall for the first time in eight years
Prank Hassan may not be coming back ei
ther.

Ever since ResEd first assumed respon
sibility for paying Suites Dining's student
workers in the fall of 2010, I'd been visiting
the Central Office every few weeks to pick
up my paycheck for cleaning the kitchens. I
needed the money and I kept on coming
back, so when I walk up the spiral staircase
and through the clear glass door, I smile
and wave to Alyssa Ray, the Central Office's
friendly and familiar administrative assis
