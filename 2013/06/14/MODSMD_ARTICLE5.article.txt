Students subject to the Universi
ty's judicial process may be exposed
to a system implicitly slanted to
wards finding respondents guilty
and willfully indifferent to rights en
shrined in the Student Judicial
Charter of 1997, according to a case
study of a 2011 judicial proceeding.
The study was undertaken by the
three students acquitted of plagia
rism charges in the 2011 case and
them alumni representatives.
"Unless it's entirely clear that
you're innocent, you're pretty much
[presumed] guilty," reflected one of
the acquitted students, a current
senior. "They'll go after you to get a
conviction."
University administrators,
meanwhile, acknowledged flaws
within the process but emphasized
efforts to correct those shortcom
ings while depicting the case in
question as an outlier.

Extensive judicial abuses
The case study references the
experiences of three students
charged with plagiarism in a June
2011 human biology final. All three
students were eventually acquitted
though two of the three were on
ly one vote removed from a guilty
finding in November 2011, but
only after undergoing a process
that, according to Bob Ottilie '77,
who represented one of the stu
dents, showed extensive misconduct
by the University.
"We have absolute proof that
there were gross, continuous [and]
serial violations of the [Judicial]
Charter," Ottilie emphasized. "At a
minimum, you have to stop this
process until you can assure [partic
ipants] that you've stopped the vio
lations."
Such violations of the Judicial
Charter, as alleged by the study, in
clude efforts to discourage students
from calling witnesses on their be
half or from cross-examining in
criminatory witnesses; the selection
of an untrained and biased set of
panelists; the presentation of inad
missible evidence; efforts by a nom
inally impartial Judicial Officer to
pursue a guilty finding by the selec
tive admission and exclusion of evi
dence and witnesses; and the bring
ing of charges without the participa
tion of the original student com
plainant and without for one stu
dent any evidence at all.
"The presumption of guilt per
meated this entire process," Ottilie
said. "Everything that was done
could only have been done with a
presumption of guilt... The Charter
was being violated at every step of

the process."
Both Rick Yuen and Morris
Graves, the case's Judicial Officer
and Judicial Advisor respectively,
declined to comment for this article.
Ottilie expressed concern that
similar misconduct had taken place
in other cases brought by the Office
of Judicial Affairs, which has since
been renamed the Office of Commu
nity Standards.
"This isn't one or two people," he
asserted. "This was an office that
was out of control at the time."
Describing the Office of Commu
nity Standard's conviction rate as
artificially high, Ottilie suggested
that past cases in which anonymity
had been granted to the complain
ing party denying the respon
dent the opportunity to cross-exam
ine the complainant should be re
viewed and, if appropriate, their
verdicts set aside.
"John [Martin 'BO, a lawyer who
represented another student in the
case] and I agree that there've been
scores —or even more —of stu
dents who have been convicted in
hearing processes in which their
fundamental rights were violated,"
Ottilie said.
During the 2010-11 academic
year, the Office of Community Stan
dards obtained guilty findings in 87
percent of Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code cases that went to
a hearing for determination of guilt.
The student against whom there
had been no initial complaint and
who still received three votes, or two
fewer than necessary, in favor of a
guilty finding from the six-member
panel expressed certainty that he
would have been found guilty in the
absence of legal representation.
"There's no doubt we would have
lost [without counsel]," he said.
"[The judicial officers] were aggres
sive, they intimidated witnesses,
they didn't allow fair process... It
was in all senses a shitshow."
The student singled out Morris
Graves as particularly negligent in
upholding student rights.
"It's his duty to protect student
rights," the student complained.
"He was absolutely spineless there."
"People in the Office of Judicial
Affairs jumped with both feet on the
scales of justice," Ottilie added.
"Had those three not been repre
sented, they would have been con
victed."
ASSU Executive Billy Gallagher
'l4 expressed concern about the
case study's findings and noted that
he had personally encountered stu
dents with other negative accounts
of the University's judicial process.
"It's disturbing... It just doesn't
seem like the Stanford we all know
and love," Gallagher said. "It's just
scary to see the system work that
badly."

Changes undertaken
Dean of Student Life Chris Grif
fith framed the case cited in the
study as an outlier, citing the gener

ally positive nature of feedback so
licited from students who have gone
through the judicial process.
"We've gotten really good feed
back from the students who've come
through our process," Griffith af
firmed, describing criticisms of ad
ministrators' impartiality as unusu
al.
"The Office is very conscious of
rules and protections," added
Jonathan York 'l3, student co-chair
of the Board on Judicial Affairs.
"I've heard more students be grate
ful and express appreciation for
what they do than criticism."
York and Griffith noted that sev
eral of the suggestions raised by the
case study such as creating spe
cific training for student panel
chairs and devising a formal proce
dure for determining evidentiary
standards and admissibility had
been identified in both an internal
review process undertaken by the
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
the Charter's first since 1997 and
in a report by an external consult
ant.
"A lot of the things in the case
study we're currently reviewing in
subcommittees," York noted. "We've
addressed so many of those things
... the Internal Review Panel was re
ally, really comprehensive... [Ot
tilie] gave us a little bit of a different
perspective, but he didn't teach us
anything new."
Griffith noted, however, that re
vising certain aspects of the process
might produce inadvertent side ef
fects. For example, she said that by
omitting the previously supplied
warning to student respondents to
not contact witnesses, student re
spondents might be more likely to
do so. Griffith added that this could
put student respondents at a
greater risk of being perceived as
intimidating witnesses itself a vi
olation of the Fundamental Stan
dard. The revised notification cur
rently contains a disclaimer to that
effect.
York disputed the need for any
delay in hearing cases while im
provements were implemented.
"A lot of the things in [the case
study] are concerning," he acknowl
edged. "I don't think this is a sys
temwide problem... but there is
room for systemwide improvement.
We've taken steps in the right direc
tion."
"We don't see these as radical
changes to the process, because the
[lnternal Review Panel] said this
process isn't broken," added Koren
Bakkegard, director of the Office of
Community Standards. "We're al
ways looking for opportunities to
improve and refine... I don't see it
as something that would change
outcomes but [rather as] something
that would improve the process for
the future."
