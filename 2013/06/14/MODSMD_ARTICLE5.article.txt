Students subject to the Universi
ty's judicial process may be exposed
to a system implicitly slanted to
wards finding respondents guilty
and willfully indifferent to rights en
shrined in the Student Judicial
Charter of 1997, according to a case
study of a 2011 judicial proceeding.
The study was undertaken by the
three students acquitted of plagia
rism charges in the 2011 case and
them alumni representatives.
"Unless it's entirely clear that
you're innocent, you're pretty much
[presumed] guilty," reflected one of
the acquitted students, a current
senior. "They'll go after you to get a
conviction."
University administrators,
meanwhile, acknowledged flaws
within the process but emphasized
efforts to correct those shortcom
ings while depicting the case in
question as an outlier.

Extensive judicial abuses
The case study references the
experiences of three students
charged with plagiarism in a June
2011 human biology final. All three
students were eventually acquitted
though two of the three were on
ly one vote removed from a guilty
finding in November 2011, but
only after undergoing a process
that, according to Bob Ottilie '77,
who represented one of the stu
dents, showed extensive misconduct
by the University.
"We have absolute proof that
there were gross, continuous [and]
serial violations of the [Judicial]
Charter," Ottilie emphasized. "At a
minimum, you have to stop this
process until you can assure [partic
ipants] that you've stopped the vio
lations."
Such violations of the Judicial
Charter, as alleged by the study, in
clude efforts to discourage students
from calling witnesses on their be
half or from cross-examining in
criminatory witnesses; the selection
of an untrained and biased set of
panelists; the presentation of inad
missible evidence; efforts by a nom
inally impartial Judicial Officer to
pursue a guilty finding by the selec
tive admission and exclusion of evi
dence and witnesses; and the bring
ing of charges without the participa
tion of the original student com
plainant and without for one stu
dent any evidence at all.
"The presumption of guilt per
meated this entire process," Ottilie
said. "Everything that was done
could only have been done with a
presumption of guilt... The Charter
was being violated at every step of

the process."
Both Rick Yuen and Morris
Graves, the case's Judicial Officer
and Judicial Advisor respectively,
declined to comment for this article.
Ottilie expressed concern that
similar misconduct had taken place
in other cases brought by the Office
of Judicial Affairs, which has since
been renamed the Office of Commu
nity Standards.
"This isn't one or two people," he
asserted. "This was an office that
was out of control at the time."
Describing the Office of Commu
nity Standard's conviction rate as
artificially high, Ottilie suggested
that past cases in which anonymity
had been granted to the complain
ing party denying the respon
dent the opportunity to cross-exam
ine the complainant should be re
viewed and, if appropriate, their
verdicts set aside.
"John [Martin 'BO, a lawyer who
represented another student in the
case] and I agree that there've been
scores —or even more —of stu
dents who have been convicted in
hearing processes in which their
fundamental rights were violated,"
Ottilie said.
During the 2010-11 academic
year, the Office of Community Stan
dards obtained guilty findings in 87
percent of Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code cases that went to
a hearing for determination of guilt.
The student against whom there
had been no initial complaint and
who still received three votes, or two
fewer than necessary, in favor of a
guilty finding from the six-member
panel expressed certainty that he
would have been found guilty in the
absence of legal representation.
"There's no doubt we would have
lost [without counsel]," he said.
"[The judicial officers] were aggres
sive, they intimidated witnesses,
they didn't allow fair process... It
was in all senses a shitshow."
The student singled out Morris
Graves as particularly negligent in
upholding student rights.
"It's his duty to protect student
rights," the student complained.
"He was absolutely spineless there."
"People in the Office of Judicial
Affairs jumped with both feet on the
scales of justice," Ottilie added.
"Had those three not been repre
sented, they would have been con
victed."
ASSU Executive Billy Gallagher
'l4 expressed concern about the
case study's findings and noted that
he had personally encountered stu
dents with other negative accounts
of the University's judicial process.
"It's disturbing... It just doesn't
seem like the Stanford we all know
and love," Gallagher said. "It's just
scary to see the system work that
badly."

Changes undertaken
Dean of Student Life Chris Grif
fith framed the case cited in the
study as an outlier, citing the gener

ally positive nature of feedback so
licited from students who have gone
through the judicial process.
"We've gotten really good feed
back from the students who've come
through our process," Griffith af
firmed, describing criticisms of ad
ministrators' impartiality as unusu
al.
"The Office is very conscious of
rules and protections," added
Jonathan York 'l3, student co-chair
of the Board on Judicial Affairs.
"I've heard more students be grate
ful and express appreciation for
what they do than criticism."
York and Griffith noted that sev
eral of the suggestions raised by the
case study such as creating spe
cific training for student panel
chairs and devising a formal proce
dure for determining evidentiary
standards and admissibility had
been identified in both an internal
review process undertaken by the
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
the Charter's first since 1997 and
in a report by an external consult
ant.
"A lot of the things in the case
study we're currently reviewing in
subcommittees," York noted. "We've
addressed so many of those things
... the Internal Review Panel was re
ally, really comprehensive... [Ot
tilie] gave us a little bit of a different
perspective, but he didn't teach us
anything new."
Griffith noted, however, that re
vising certain aspects of the process
might produce inadvertent side ef
fects. For example, she said that by
omitting the previously supplied
warning to student respondents to
not contact witnesses, student re
spondents might be more likely to
do so. Griffith added that this could
put student respondents at a
greater risk of being perceived as
intimidating witnesses itself a vi
olation of the Fundamental Stan
dard. The revised notification cur
rently contains a disclaimer to that
effect.
York disputed the need for any
delay in hearing cases while im
provements were implemented.
"A lot of the things in [the case
study] are concerning," he acknowl
edged. "I don't think this is a sys
temwide problem... but there is
room for systemwide improvement.
We've taken steps in the right direc
tion."
"We don't see these as radical
changes to the process, because the
[lnternal Review Panel] said this
process isn't broken," added Koren
Bakkegard, director of the Office of
Community Standards. "We're al
ways looking for opportunities to
improve and refine... I don't see it
as something that would change
outcomes but [rather as] something
that would improve the process for
the future."
David Hsu, a graduate student
who previously served on judicial
panels, noted that, in his experi
ence, the training offered to pan
elists was sufficiently comprehen
sive given the absence of exposure
to a real hearing. Hsu also defended
the high percentage of guilty find
ings in cases brought by the Office
of Community Standards.
"I've never been in a case where
the outcome was guilty and 1... felt
any discomfort," Hsu emphasized.
"They may turn out mostly guilty...
but it's because the evidence is very
heavily against the person."
Ottilie alleged, however, a lack of
responsiveness by University ad
ministrators and argued that more
explicit leadership from senior Uni
versity leaders including Presi
dent John Hennessy is required
to ensure improvements are made
permanent and that sufficient over
sight is exercised.
"The University has to ultimate
ly make certain that any fixes are
institutionalized," he said. "There
are already rules there. The issue is
making sure that people are enforc
ing their rules."
"I cannot allow any client to
have a case heard by either [Yuen
or Graves], knowing what's in this
report," Ottilie added. "You just
can't fix that...We have the best
Charter. It's just not enforced."
Gallagher said that he and fel
low ASSU Executive Dan Ashton
'l4 plan to attend an Office of the
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
staff meeting today to better under
stand the issue before working with
administrators on solutions.
"This is what Dan and I meant
[during the election] when we said
that things will come up that we
haven't planned for," Gallagher noted.
"We have to see how things unfold."

Discipline and education
According to Ottilie, eonversa

tions with University administra
tors regarding the case repeatedly
referenced a "discipline system," a
characterization that Griffith and
Bakkegard contested in favor of
defining the process as educational.
"It really is a conversation,"
Bakkegard said. "I'm sure [that] for
the responding student... it's a dif
ficult one to have. But the idea is
not to prosecute the student, but to
have a conversation about what oc
curred."

"One of the most powerful state
ments made [in the internal review]
... was to say we need to remain an
educational process and resist the
temptation to become legalistic,"
Griffith added. "I believe that."
York echoed the inclination to
distance the process from "legalis
tic" practices, describing the stu
dent-run process as conveying both
responsibilities and privileges.
"You appear before your peers
[and] you have the opportunity to
present your case," he emphasized.
"If you're found responsible, you do
face the consequences, but the pun
ishments aren't meant to be debili
tating ... This is [primarily] a learn
ing process."
Ottilie insisted, however, on the
value of both educating students
so that they might make full use of
that opportunity and approach
ing the judicial process in a more
structured and legally-inclined
manner.

"All these procedural protec
tions ... are designed to enhance the
quality of evidence that comes in,"
he said. "You [then] have the high
est possible chance of getting the
right result."
As an example, Ottilie cited an
other case in which a student was
evicted from Row housing as a re
sult of an altercation, after a
process in which the Residence
Dean handling the case precluded
the student from speaking to excul
patory witnesses and declined to in
terview those witnesses herself.
Once counseled to the contrary by a
private attorney, the student over

turned the decision with declara
tions from over 60 witnesses.
Bakkegard estimated that only
a minority of students charged
through the judicial process actual
ly contest the allegations, instead
choosing to take advantage of an
"early resolution option" program
that involves just a sentencing
hearing after the admission of cul
pability.
While Ottilie noted that such a
program might implicitly suggest
more lenient punishments and thus
encourage false admissions of guilt,
Bakkegard and Assistant Dean of
the Office of Community Standards
Jamie Pontius-Hogan noted that
penalties largely conformed to
standard sanctions that would oth
erwise be levied.
Turning to the broader picture,
Ottilie framed effectively strength
ening the judicial process as poten
tially allowing the University to set
a precedent on an issue student
rights in judicial processes, from
plagiarism to sexual assault
that has increasingly become a na
tional one.
"This is going on elsewhere," he
noted. "This is a crisis for Stanford
are we going to be judged by the
crisis or by our response to it?"
Griffith acknowledged the value
of greater student participation in
creating and sustaining an optimal
judicial process.
"This is a process that demands
consistent input and feedback from
students," she emphasized. "It's a
student-centered process."
"There can be kinks when you
have a student-run process," York ac
knowledged. "In the long run, the
benefits of having a student-run
process are immense. If that means
we have to keep working at it, so be
it."
