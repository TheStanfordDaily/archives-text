Christina 'l3 was raped in the
middle of the Main Quad at Stanford,
in the early morning of Martin
Luther King Jr. Day her sophomore
year.
He was an acquaintance; a
"friend" from her freshman dorm
she didn't really know. They were
both drunk at a party, and he had vol
unteered to walk her home.
"I was very, very drunk so I was
unable to do anything when it was
happening," Christina remembered.
She admits she has blocked much of
the incident out but remembers
small details the bikers who rode
by them, giving congratulatory hoots
moments before he pressed himself
on top of her. The taste of alcohol on
his breath. The "practiced" feel of it,
as he unzipped his pants and hiked
up her skirt in quick, effortless mo
tions.
That night, when she arrived
back to her house, Christina ran into
a friend of hers in the bathroom.
"You're up late. What's up?" her
friend asked.
"Something happened that I did
n't want to happen," was all Christi
na could say. Her friend gave her an
understanding look, assuming it was
simply a drunken hookup.
"Honey, it happens all the time.
Just drink some water and go to
bed."

The next morning she woke up at
9 a.m., in a state of shock.
"When I woke up in the morning
and I remember, it was the most dis
gusting feeling, having his semen all
over my legs and thinking, 'I didn't

consent to any of this.'"
She called the Vaden Health Cen
ter's 24/7 emergency hotline, which
took several hours to respond be
cause of the holiday. When she asked
to file a police report, she was told
she had to contact the police directly.
There was nothing else the Center
could do for her.
"Vaden was fucking awful. They
took hours to call me back, and it's
pretty time-sensitive.... I just re
member being curled up in a ball
next to my bed, waiting for the cops
to call me," she said.
The police arrived around 11 p.m.
that night to pick her up and drive
her to the closest medical facility that
administers rape kits, Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center in San Jose,
where a doctor found vaginal tears
and semen.
"I thought I had a good case be
cause I literally reported it the day
of," she said.
After being called in for inter
views by the Stanford University
Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS) over several weeks,
SUDPS called her in one last time to
tell her the district attorney was
dropping the case for lack of evi
dence.
"They had a female cop tell me,
which I thought was nice, but she
had clearly never undergone any
sensitivity training for sexual as
sault. ... The way she told me was es
sentially, 'We don't think you were
raped.' It was so fucking hurtful.
You're trying to recollect and become
whole again and you hear that from a
woman.... I just remember crying
right there."
According to women's health ad
vocates, this is often the reality of
pursuing rape cases in the judicial
system.
"It's not that they don't believe
the survivor," said Kelly Ramirez,
chief development officer of the YW
CA Silicon Valley. "It's just that the
legal requirements are not there."
Ramirez said the situation is un
fortunate for everyone involved: po

lice officers, detectives and especial
ly the victim.

This judicial paralysis becomes
even worse when compared to the
size of the problem: A staggering
one-in-five women will be raped dur
ing their college careers, according
to a 2005 report by the U.S. Depart
ment of Justice. Between 80 percent
and 90 percent of these rapes are
committed by an acquaintance and
fewer than 5 percent are reported to
police or campus authorities.
Ramirez noted reporting can be
difficult, especially when the victim
and accused have mutual friends.
"They say to you —'l can't be
lieve he did that. Maybe you really
asked for it. You could have just dealt
with this quietly; you didn't have to
actually report it. Think about his fu
ture!"'
"The reason it got so difficult was
because I notified everyone,"
Christina said, describing how going
through the process with Judicial Af
fairs and having to recount her story
again and again was excruciating. "I
felt I was suffering for doing the
right thing."

Christina's case was one of the
first to use the Alternative Review
Process (ARP) for sexual assault
in fact, Stanford lowered the burden
of proof from "beyond a reasonable
doubt" to "preponderance of evi
dence" during her case, meaning the
panel would find the accused respon
sible if it was "more likely than not"
a crime had occurred. Her attacker
would later use this as grounds for
an eventually unsuccessful appeal.
"When they changed to prepon
derance of evidence, I just remem
ber weeping.... I was so happy. It's
pretty much just a survivor and one
witness [to convict]," she said. "As
soon as they proved I was drunk via
witness, they were able to stop the
case right there."
The review panel found her at
tacker guilty of rape, and also heard
