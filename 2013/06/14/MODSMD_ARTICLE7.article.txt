## Obama dominates Stanford donations

With the 2012 presidential elec
tion just four days away, many
Stanford University employees
have already voted with their wal
lets â€” most offering support for
President Barack Obama's bid for a
second term.
Stanford donors have given a to
tal of $473,372 to Obama's reelec
tion campaign through Oct. 25, ac
cording to Federal Election Com
mission (FEC) filings. Contribu
tions to Governor Mitt Romney's
campaign from Stanford employees
over the same period total only
$45,615, a little under 10 percent of
the Obama total.
These individual contribution
figures only represent contribu
tions made directly to presidential
campaigns by donors who reported
working for Stanford University.
Only donations over $2OO are tal
lied.
According to the Center for Re
sponsive Politics, Stanford employ
ees constitute the seventh-largest
group of donors to Obama in the
2012 electoral cycle and the third
largest among universities, behind
only Harvard and the University of
California system.
"This [imbalance in support] is
very typical of universities," said
Adam Bonica, associate professor
of political science. "Academics also
have a high propensity to give, com
pared to other professionals."
Obama's 2012 fundraising totals
from Stanford employees, however,
are lower than in 2008, when he re
ceived $595,716. Larry Diamond '73
M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, a Hoover Insti
tution senior fellow who has donat
ed $1,250 in the 2012 cycle to Oba
ma, framed the decrease in donor
enthusiasm as reflective of 2008's
unique circumstances.
"2008 was quite exceptional and
extremely unlikely to be repeated

in enthusiasm or scale," Diamond
said. "A lot of faculty who are some
where between left and moderate
are sure to have disappointments
with Obama."
Diamond said his continued sup
port for Obama emanates largely
from the hope that he'll continue
the work of his first term, citing the
electoral slogan that "Osama Bin-
Laden is dead, and General Motors
is alive," while turning to address
issues like the federal deficit and
climate change.
"When you look at his accom
plishments, they've been signifi
cant," Diamond argued.
Keith Hennessey '9O, a Gradu
ate School of Business lecturer who
has donated the maximum individ
ual contribution of $5,000 to Rom
ney, framed his donation as an at
tempt to address the nation's cur
rent economic struggles and grow
ing national debt.
"I care most about economic pol
icy and have more confidence in
both Governor Romney and his eco
nomic policy agenda," Hennessey
wrote in a statement.
Hennessey and Diamond both
dismissed the notion that faculty in
volvement in the presidential cam
paign would have detrimental ef
fects on classroom dynamics.
"You can't ask faculty to surren
der their political views and their
sense of responsibility to the coun
try," Diamond said. "What you can
ask faculty to do is to keep their
politics out of the classroom, and
I've tried pretty hard to do that."
"My professional background is
in policy rather than politics," Hen
nessey, who was a senior economic
adviser to former President George
W Bush, wrote. "I see my goal as
making sure students understand a
wide range of different approaches
to policy, including views with which
I strongly disagree."
