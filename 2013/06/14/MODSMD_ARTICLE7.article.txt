# ELECTION 2012
## Obama dominates Stanford donations 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
Oriqinally published on Nov.
2, 2012.

With the 2012 presidential elec
tion just four days away, many
Stanford University employees
have already voted with their wal
lets — most offering support for
President Barack Obama's bid for a
second term.
Stanford donors have given a to
tal of $473,372 to Obama's reelec
tion campaign through Oct. 25, ac
cording to Federal Election Com
mission (FEC) filings. Contribu
tions to Governor Mitt Romney's
campaign from Stanford employees
over the same period total only
$45,615, a little under 10 percent of
the Obama total.
These individual contribution
figures only represent contribu
tions made directly to presidential
campaigns by donors who reported
working for Stanford University.
Only donations over $2OO are tal
lied.
According to the Center for Re
sponsive Politics, Stanford employ
ees constitute the seventh-largest
group of donors to Obama in the
2012 electoral cycle and the third
largest among universities, behind
only Harvard and the University of
California system.
"This [imbalance in support] is
very typical of universities," said
Adam Bonica, associate professor
of political science. "Academics also
have a high propensity to give, com
pared to other professionals."
Obama's 2012 fundraising totals
from Stanford employees, however,
are lower than in 2008, when he re
ceived $595,716. Larry Diamond '73
M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, a Hoover Insti
tution senior fellow who has donat
ed $1,250 in the 2012 cycle to Oba
ma, framed the decrease in donor
enthusiasm as reflective of 2008's
unique circumstances.
"2008 was quite exceptional and
extremely unlikely to be repeated

in enthusiasm or scale," Diamond
said. "A lot of faculty who are some
where between left and moderate
are sure to have disappointments
with Obama."
Diamond said his continued sup
port for Obama emanates largely
from the hope that he'll continue
the work of his first term, citing the
electoral slogan that "Osama Bin-
Laden is dead, and General Motors
is alive," while turning to address
issues like the federal deficit and
climate change.
"When you look at his accom
plishments, they've been signifi
cant," Diamond argued.
Keith Hennessey '9O, a Gradu
ate School of Business lecturer who
has donated the maximum individ
ual contribution of $5,000 to Rom
ney, framed his donation as an at
tempt to address the nation's cur
rent economic struggles and grow
ing national debt.
"I care most about economic pol
icy and have more confidence in
both Governor Romney and his eco
nomic policy agenda," Hennessey
wrote in a statement.
Hennessey and Diamond both
dismissed the notion that faculty in
volvement in the presidential cam
paign would have detrimental ef
fects on classroom dynamics.
"You can't ask faculty to surren
der their political views and their
sense of responsibility to the coun
try," Diamond said. "What you can
ask faculty to do is to keep their
politics out of the classroom, and
I've tried pretty hard to do that."
"My professional background is
in policy rather than politics," Hen
nessey, who was a senior economic
adviser to former President George
W Bush, wrote. "I see my goal as
making sure students understand a
wide range of different approaches
to policy, including views with which
I strongly disagree."

cratic candidates extends to candi
dates further down the ballot as
well, as does the fall in enthusiasm
from 2008.

Just 12.6 percent of donations
from Stanford employees in the
2012 cycle went to Republican can
didates and committees, which is
less than the 20.9 percent for
American universities as a whole
but more than Harvard's 9.9 per
cent. That 2012 percentage is the
second lowest in Stanford's histo
ry since 1980 and is half of the 24
percent given in 2008 to Republi
cans.

The total amount of donations
to federal-level candidates and
campaigns has also fallen between
2008 and 2012 from $3,422,293.90
to $2,854,128.60, as did the num
ber of contributing employees,
from 1585 to 1262, though both fig
ures could rise in the final week of
the campaign.

Bonica framed the historical
dominance of federal-level dona
tions (so far this cycle, only
$8,503.30 has gone to state or local
recipients) as typical of a faculty
focus on national issues rather
than local concerns, a stance
echoed both by Hennessey and by
Diamond.

"When it comes to universities,
their donations really seem to be
tuned into national politics," Boni
ca said. "They're more or less re
moved from state-level issues...

Most giving by university employ
ees is an expression of ideological
preference."

While the Supreme Court's
2010 Citizens United v. FEC deci
sion has led to a highly con
tentious increase in corporate in
volvement in politics, University
employees have also been able to
take advantage of the ruling, with
Griffith Harsh, a School of Medi
cine professor, providing the
largest Stanford employee dona
tion of $lOO,OOO to Restore Our
Future, a pro-Romney political
action committee. Harsh declined
to comment on his donation.

Bonica, however, downplayed
the ruling's significance, noting
that affluent individuals have his
torically had an array of means
for funding political activities,
such as the Swift Boat Veterans

for Truth 527 group of the 2004
presidential election.
"In the past, if you really
wanted to give a lot of money, you
always had a vehicle to do so,"
Bonica said. "They didn't emerge
out of thin air after Citizens Unit
ed."

Other Stanford donors, like
Carol Winograd, professor emeri
tus in the School of Medicine, and
her husband Terry Winograd,
professor emeritus of computer
science, gave heavily through ac
cumulated donations to individu
als and party committees, amass
ing over $300,000 in total for
Democratic causes.

Even while Stanford employ
ees largely remove themselves
from state and local politics, some

faculty members remain active in
promoting propositions set to ap
pear on the 2012 ballot for Califor
nia initiatives.

David Mills, senior lecturer at
the Law School, said his decision to
donate $500,000 to Proposition 36,
a movement to amend California's
three-strikes law, emanated from
his support for civil rights.
"We can't continue to imprison
people with these extremely
lengthy sentences especially
since so many of these people are
[people] of color without there
being a great challenge to the fun
damental equality of our society,"
Mills said.

in enthusiasm or scale," Diamond
said. "A lot of faculty who are some
where between left and moderate
are sure to have disappointments
with Obama."
Diamond said his continued sup
port for Obama emanates largely
from the hope that he'll continue
the work of his first term, citing the
electoral slogan that "Osama Bin-
Laden is dead, and General Motors
is alive," while turning to address
issues like the federal deficit and
climate change.
"When you look at his accom
plishments, they've been signifi
cant," Diamond argued.
Keith Hennessey '9O, a Gradu
ate School of Business lecturer who
has donated the maximum individ
ual contribution of $5,000 to Rom
ney, framed his donation as an at
tempt to address the nation's cur
rent economic struggles and grow
ing national debt.
"I care most about economic pol
icy and have more confidence in
both Governor Romney and his eco
nomic policy agenda," Hennessey
wrote in a statement.
Hennessey and Diamond both
dismissed the notion that faculty in
volvement in the presidential cam
paign would have detrimental ef
fects on classroom dynamics.
"You can't ask faculty to surren
der their political views and their
sense of responsibility to the coun
try," Diamond said. "What you can
ask faculty to do is to keep their
politics out of the classroom, and
I've tried pretty hard to do that."
"My professional background is
in policy rather than politics," Hen
nessey, who was a senior economic
adviser to former President George
W Bush, wrote. "I see my goal as
making sure students understand a
wide range of different approaches
to policy, including views with which
I strongly disagree."

Democratic, national leanings

cratic candidates extends to candi
dates further down the ballot as
well, as does the fall in enthusiasm
from 2008.

Just 12.6 percent of donations
from Stanford employees in the
2012 cycle went to Republican can
didates and committees, which is
less than the 20.9 percent for
American universities as a whole
but more than Harvard's 9.9 per
cent. That 2012 percentage is the
second lowest in Stanford's histo
ry since 1980 and is half of the 24
percent given in 2008 to Republi
cans.

The total amount of donations
to federal-level candidates and
campaigns has also fallen between
2008 and 2012 from $3,422,293.90
to $2,854,128.60, as did the num
ber of contributing employees,
from 1585 to 1262, though both fig
ures could rise in the final week of
the campaign.

Bonica framed the historical
dominance of federal-level dona
tions (so far this cycle, only
$8,503.30 has gone to state or local
recipients) as typical of a faculty
focus on national issues rather
than local concerns, a stance
echoed both by Hennessey and by
Diamond.

"When it comes to universities,
their donations really seem to be
tuned into national politics," Boni
ca said. "They're more or less re
moved from state-level issues...

Most giving by university employ
ees is an expression of ideological
preference."

While the Supreme Court's
2010 Citizens United v. FEC deci
sion has led to a highly con
tentious increase in corporate in
volvement in politics, University
employees have also been able to
take advantage of the ruling, with
Griffith Harsh, a School of Medi
cine professor, providing the
largest Stanford employee dona
tion of $lOO,OOO to Restore Our
Future, a pro-Romney political
action committee. Harsh declined
to comment on his donation.

Bonica, however, downplayed
the ruling's significance, noting
that affluent individuals have his
torically had an array of means
for funding political activities,
such as the Swift Boat Veterans

for Truth 527 group of the 2004
presidential election.
"In the past, if you really
wanted to give a lot of money, you
always had a vehicle to do so,"
Bonica said. "They didn't emerge
out of thin air after Citizens Unit
ed."

Other Stanford donors, like
Carol Winograd, professor emeri
tus in the School of Medicine, and
her husband Terry Winograd,
professor emeritus of computer
science, gave heavily through ac
cumulated donations to individu
als and party committees, amass
ing over $300,000 in total for
Democratic causes.

Even while Stanford employ
ees largely remove themselves
from state and local politics, some

faculty members remain active in
promoting propositions set to ap
pear on the 2012 ballot for Califor
nia initiatives.

David Mills, senior lecturer at
the Law School, said his decision to
donate $500,000 to Proposition 36,
a movement to amend California's
three-strikes law, emanated from
his support for civil rights.
"We can't continue to imprison
people with these extremely
lengthy sentences especially
since so many of these people are
[people] of color without there
being a great challenge to the fun
damental equality of our society,"
Mills said.

With the 2012 presidential elec
tion just four days away, many
Stanford University employees
have already voted with their wal
lets — most offering support for
President Barack Obama's bid for a
second term.
Stanford donors have given a to
tal of $473,372 to Obama's reelec
tion campaign through Oct. 25, ac
cording to Federal Election Com
mission (FEC) filings. Contribu
tions to Governor Mitt Romney's
campaign from Stanford employees
over the same period total only
$45,615, a little under 10 percent of
the Obama total.
These individual contribution
figures only represent contribu
tions made directly to presidential
campaigns by donors who reported
working for Stanford University.
Only donations over $2OO are tal
lied.
According to the Center for Re
sponsive Politics, Stanford employ
ees constitute the seventh-largest
group of donors to Obama in the
2012 electoral cycle and the third
largest among universities, behind
only Harvard and the University of
California system.
"This [imbalance in support] is
very typical of universities," said
Adam Bonica, associate professor
of political science. "Academics also
have a high propensity to give, com
pared to other professionals."
Obama's 2012 fundraising totals
from Stanford employees, however,
are lower than in 2008, when he re
ceived $595,716. Larry Diamond '73
M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, a Hoover Insti
tution senior fellow who has donat
ed $1,250 in the 2012 cycle to Oba
ma, framed the decrease in donor
enthusiasm as reflective of 2008's
unique circumstances.
"2008 was quite exceptional and
extremely unlikely to be repeated

in enthusiasm or scale," Diamond
said. "A lot of faculty who are some

are sure to have disappointments
