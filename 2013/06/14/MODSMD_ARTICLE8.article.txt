As former Stanford basketball
star Jason Collins 'ol's announce
ment that he is gay continues to re
verberate around the nation, Stan
ford community members reacted
with surprise and pride to the news
that the first openly gay active male
athlete in a major U.S. professional
sport was a Stanford graduate.
"It really makes me proud to hear
that Collins competed for Stanford
and that we have that aspect of our
lives in common," said Noah Garcia
'l4, an openly gay member of the
men's swimming and diving team.

Collins was a member of the Car
dinal basketball team from 1997-2001
before being drafted 18th overall by
the Houston Rockets in the 2001
NBA Draft. Collins is currently a free
agent after playing for the Boston
Celtics and the Washington Wizards
during the 2012-13 season.
In a first-person Sports Illustrat
ed article released on Monday morn
ing, Collins wrote, "I am a 34-year-old
NBA center. I'm black. And I'm gay."
He went on to detail the process of
coming to terms with and publicly ex
pressing his identity.

Former teammates express shock,
support

Collins' announcement came as a
surprise to some former teammates.
Julius Barnes 'O3, who played with
Collins for two seasons, said he "did a
double take" after seeing the news on
ESPN.com.

"I just never knew, not that it
would make any difference at all,"
Barnes said.

Barnes said that he has also been
in contact with other teammates, who
he described as "still in shock" but al
so cognizant of the emotional weight
lifted by Collins' announcement.
"To say the least, it takes a brave
and encouraging person to do what
he's done," Barnes said. "I know for a
fact that his former teammates and
anybody that knows Jason is 100 per

cent behind him."
Current Stanford basketball as
sistant coach Mark Madsen 'OO MBA
'l2, who played alongside Collins in
college and as a professional, called
Collins "one of the greatest people
you will ever meet in your life" in a
statement.

"Basketball does not define Jason
Collins. His decision to come out pub
licly doesn't define Jason Collins,"
Madsen wrote. "What defines Jason,
is he is a first-rate human being who
made a huge contribution to this Uni
versity, and every team or community
he has been a part of."

Continuing the conversation
In the Sports Illustrated article,
Collins wrote, "I didn't set out to be
the first openly gay athlete playing
in a major American team sport. But
since I am, I'm happy to start the
conversation."

Many students voiced hope that
Collins' words would help to contin
ue to improve conditions for LGBT
athletes and students on campus.
"This is really just a watershed
moment, just because it's such a
public sphere and the stage that he
chose to come out on is so massive,"
said Nathaniel Williams 'l3 M.A. 'l4,
community coordinator for the
Queer-Straight Alliance. "It's really
great that he's a Stanford alum and
I think we'll start to see the impact
here at Stanford."

Members of Stanford Athletes
and Allies Together (STAAT), a stu
dent group that aims to create a safe
space for LGBT and allied varsity
and club athletes on campus, also ex
pressed optimism that Collins' mes
sage would encourage students and
athletes to support one another.
Toni Kokenis 'l4, who co-founded
STAAT with Garcia, Annie Graham
'l4 and Smriti Sridhar 'l5, noted
that female athletes and retired
male competitors had come out be
fore Collins but added that Collins'
status as an active professional ath
lete amplifies his message.

"It creates an environment that
you can play and you can be LGBT
