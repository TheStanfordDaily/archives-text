## Sequester set to hinder research 
### AARON SEKHRI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Originally published on March

The inability of the federal gov
ernment to avert the "sequester"
automatic and across-the-board
spending cuts of $B5 billion that
came into effect last Friday will
seriously affect the state of ongoing
and future research at Stanford,
according to University adminis
trators.

In a presentation to the Faculty
Senate on Feb. 21, Vice Provost
and Dean of Research Ann Arvin
estimated that the sequester would
reduce Stanford's projected feder
al research revenues of $685 mil
lion for the 2013-14 fiscal year by
$5l million.

Grants from federal agencies,
from the National Institute of
Health to the National Science
Foundation, make up 17 percent of
Stanford's $4 billion budget and ul
timately fund 80 percent of all re
search conducted at Stanford be
yond the SLAC National Accelera
tor Laboratory.

According to Arvin, the impact
of these federal discretionary
spending cuts is "quite serious" for
the state of Stanford research,
forcing faculty to devise a number
of measures that will attempt to
bring down costs and manage their
projects more economically.
"It will affect the amount [of re
search] and the speed, if you will,
the timeline for how quickly the
work can be done and the questions
can be answered," Arvin said.

Mr. Adesnik goes to Washington
Ryan Adesnik, Stanford's Di
rector of Federal Government Re
lations, articulated his displeasure
with the nature of the cuts and the
dialogue's frustrating nature in a
phone interview with The Daily
from Washington, D.C.
"We're spending every day
communicating the damage that
the sequester cuts would inflict on
research and education, and the
country's innovation ecosystem,"
he said. "We tell them that re
search and education are invest
ments in the future of the U.S.
economy, and that has served us
very well over the years."
Adesnik argued emphatically
for federal policies that prioritize
research and education funding in
acknowledgement of the broader
societal benefits produced.

"This is how we drive new tech
nologies of the future, how we edu

cate and train the skilled workforce
of the future and it's the underpin
nings of economic future, and it
needs to be a federal priority,"
Adesnik said.

Additionally, Adesnik asserted
that the sequester, ostensibly de
vised to help manage the U.S.'s
burgeoning deficit by providing an
unpalatable alternative to Con
gress passing a more comprehen
sive piece of deficit reduction legis
lation, does not actually help fix the
situation.

"Sequestration does very, very
little to impact the deficit, because
the unsustainable growth in the
federal budget is being driven not
on the discretionary side of the fed
eral budget with the science pro
grams and financial aid, but it
comes from the mandatory side,
from the entitlements," he said.
"When you're cutting these invest
ments you're not helping the deficit
problem, you're just hindering
long-term economic growth, and
frankly part of how you handle a
deficit problem is you have eco
nomic growth."

Adesnik said that the idea of al
lowing research funding to be di
minished at a time where competi
tion around the world is increasing
is shortsighted and misguided.
"That's the absurdity," Adesnik
said. "At a time when the global
economy is getting more competi
tive and other countries are betting
on our model, we're scaling it back,
intentionally or unintentionally."

Peer institutions equally affected
Stanford's peer universities
have been affected in similar ways,
with their reliance on federal fund
ing for research leading to poten
tially grave consequences for the
state of research at those institu
tions.

Princeton University receives
roughly $2OO million a year from
the federal government, and the
cuts "could shrink the University's
federally-sponsored research
budget by $l5 to 20 million for fis
cal year 2013 and indirectly dimin
ish its endowment," according to
The Daily Princetonian.
Harvard University anticipates
cuts to its $650 million in federal
research aid budget and is consid
ering diversification of its funding
sources, as well as serious cost-cut
ting efforts.

The effects of the sequester are
also not constrained to research,
with federal financial aid programs
due to lose crucial funds. According
to a White House memo on the spe
cific losses for California residents,

"Around 9,600 fewer low income
students in California would re
ceive aid to help them finance the
costs of college and around 3,690
fewer students will get work-study
jobs that help them pay for col
lege."

According to Director of Finan
cial Aid Karen Cooper, however,
Stanford will not be overly affected
by these predictions.

"[Federal aid] is a very small
portion of the funding that we use
to fund undergraduates," Cooper
said. "For this current year we're
spending $l2B million in institu
tional funds on financial aid and
we'll be spending $6 million in fed
eral funds for financial aid, so it's
such a small portion of our budget."

Because Pell Grants the ma
jority of Stanford's federal aid
funding are protected from the
sequester, the University should
see a marginal impact from the se
quester on its financial aid budget,
according to Cooper.

"According to NASFA, we
would lose around $50,000 from our
federal work-study allocation...
that should be the main impact to
us," said Cooper. "We spend a little
over $2 million in federal work
study specifically... so if [funding]
is lower than last year by that
amount, it actually wouldn't impact
undergraduates. What we would do
is reduce the spending on graduate
students first."

Climate of uncertainty
According to Arvin, despite the
knowledge of the impending cuts,
there is almost no understanding of
how the cuts will actually be appor
tioned for current and future re
search grants. Instead, that deter
mination has been left to the vari
ous relevant federal agencies and
internal divisions to decide in the
next few months.

"How [the cuts] will happen, we
don't know, but it has to happen
within now and the end of the fiscal
year, and then it will carry on from
there," said Arvin.

A White House press release
claims that, in light of the se
quester, "the NIH would be forced
to delay or halt vital scientific proj
ects and make hundreds of fewer
research awards" and that "the
National Science Foundation
(NSF) would issue nearly 1,000
fewer research grants and
awards", but as of now there has
been no word from those agencies
as to when those delays and de
creases in grants will be seen.
As things hold as of this
moment, "most science agen
cies will take a five percent
hit," according to Adesnik.
He noted, however, that the
situation is entirely "vari
able."

"If you're talking from a
Stanford-specific perspec
tive, it's a little to early to tell
the extent of the hit,"
Adesnik said. "Because there
hasn't been a lot of specific
guidance to or from the fed
eral agencies, each agency at
least is signaling a slightly dif

ferent approach for how
they're going to do this. We're
sort of in a wait-and-see
mode."

Lacking solutions
In terms of assessing
short and long terms solu
tions to an impending funding
crunch, Arvin offered few an
swers, citing the enormous
expense of conducting funda
mental research and Stan
ford's dependency on federal
research funding.
"If you are successful in
getting a grant that gives you
$245 [thousand], you've only
got enough money at that
rate to support two trainees
and one staff member, and
some supplies," Arvin said.

"It looks like a lot of money,
but lab research is very ex
pensive."
"We are lucky we have our
donors, but there's no donor
that can substitute $450 mil
lion a year of federal research
money," she added. "We don't
have an alternative to federal
research funding. Where
would it come from, at that
scale?"

Despite the difficulty of
finding solutions to the im
pact of the sequester cuts,
Arvin emphasized that the
cuts come at a time which has
been suboptimal for research
in general.
"It's been a very tight
funding climate for the last
five years," she said. "I
mean, we have been prepar
ing for a long time in terms
of the leadership focusing on
graduate student fellow
ships, endowed chairs for
faculty, so our strategy really
has to be to relieve the bur
den of costs where we can
find a substitute resource."
In terms of substantive

strategies, Arvin said that
the essence of any strategy
to strengthen research at
Stanford would be to cut un
necessary costs and incen
tivize faculty performance.
"We have to do every
thing we can to ensure facul
ty are competitive, and we
do that in several different
ways," she said. "We try to
offer seed grants, pilot
grants internally, for re
searchers to get preliminary
data, we also try to have
state-of-the-art shared facil
ities, because if you have
those facilities and instru

ments available you can
have more impact."
However, Arvin said that
cost cutting cannot be a goal
unto itself since indiscrimi
nate budget decreases for
faculty would diminish the
very purpose of much of the
research at Stanford edu
cation.

"Keep in mind that our
research enterprise is all
about education as well," she

said. "Now, we could just
take fewer students and hire
more research staff and be
much more efficient. Are we
going to do that? No."
While the sequester will
likely impose substantial
damage to research at uni
versities around the coun
try, Arvin emphasized that
issues associated with de
clining federal research
spending have been a press

ing issue for some time.
"We've had to think
about the declining federal
funding for several years,"
Arvin said. "We were think
ing about what to do to make
sure our faculty remain com
petitive for research before
anybody started talking
about the sequester."

Originally published on March

The inability of the federal gov
ernment to avert the "sequester"
automatic and across-the-board
spending cuts of $B5 billion that
came into effect last Friday will
seriously affect the state of ongoing
and future research at Stanford,
according to University adminis
trators.

In a presentation to the Faculty
Senate on Feb. 21, Vice Provost
and Dean of Research Ann Arvin
estimated that the sequester would
reduce Stanford's projected feder
al research revenues of $685 mil
lion for the 2013-14 fiscal year by
$5l million.

Grants from federal agencies,
from the National Institute of
Health to the National Science
Foundation, make up 17 percent of
Stanford's $4 billion budget and ul
timately fund 80 percent of all re
search conducted at Stanford be
yond the SLAC National Accelera
tor Laboratory.

According to Arvin, the impact
of these federal discretionary
spending cuts is "quite serious" for
the state of Stanford research,
forcing faculty to devise a number
of measures that will attempt to
bring down costs and manage their
projects more economically.
"It will affect the amount [of re
search] and the speed, if you will,
the timeline for how quickly the
work can be done and the questions
can be answered," Arvin said.

Mr. Adesnik goes to Washington
Ryan Adesnik, Stanford's Di
rector of Federal Government Re
lations, articulated his displeasure
with the nature of the cuts and the
dialogue's frustrating nature in a
phone interview with The Daily
from Washington, D.C.
"We're spending every day
communicating the damage that
the sequester cuts would inflict on
research and education, and the
country's innovation ecosystem,"
he said. "We tell them that re
search and education are invest
ments in the future of the U.S.
economy, and that has served us
very well over the years."
Adesnik argued emphatically
for federal policies that prioritize
research and education funding in
acknowledgement of the broader
societal benefits produced.

"This is how we drive new tech
nologies of the future, how we edu

cate and train the skilled workforce
of the future and it's the underpin
nings of economic future, and it
needs to be a federal priority,"
Adesnik said.

Additionally, Adesnik asserted
that the sequester, ostensibly de
vised to help manage the U.S.'s
burgeoning deficit by providing an
unpalatable alternative to Con
gress passing a more comprehen
sive piece of deficit reduction legis
lation, does not actually help fix the
situation.

"Sequestration does very, very
little to impact the deficit, because
the unsustainable growth in the
federal budget is being driven not
on the discretionary side of the fed
eral budget with the science pro
grams and financial aid, but it
comes from the mandatory side,
from the entitlements," he said.
"When you're cutting these invest
ments you're not helping the deficit
problem, you're just hindering
long-term economic growth, and
frankly part of how you handle a
deficit problem is you have eco
nomic growth."

Adesnik said that the idea of al
lowing research funding to be di
minished at a time where competi
tion around the world is increasing
is shortsighted and misguided.
"That's the absurdity," Adesnik
said. "At a time when the global
economy is getting more competi
tive and other countries are betting
on our model, we're scaling it back,
intentionally or unintentionally."

Peer institutions equally affected
Stanford's peer universities
have been affected in similar ways,
with their reliance on federal fund
ing for research leading to poten
tially grave consequences for the
state of research at those institu
tions.

Princeton University receives
roughly $2OO million a year from
the federal government, and the
cuts "could shrink the University's
federally-sponsored research
budget by $l5 to 20 million for fis
cal year 2013 and indirectly dimin
ish its endowment," according to
The Daily Princetonian.
Harvard University anticipates
cuts to its $650 million in federal
research aid budget and is consid
ering diversification of its funding
sources, as well as serious cost-cut
ting efforts.

The effects of the sequester are
also not constrained to research,
with federal financial aid programs
due to lose crucial funds. According
to a White House memo on the spe
cific losses for California residents,

"Around 9,600 fewer low income
students in California would re
ceive aid to help them finance the
costs of college and around 3,690
fewer students will get work-study
jobs that help them pay for col
lege."

According to Director of Finan
cial Aid Karen Cooper, however,
Stanford will not be overly affected
by these predictions.

"[Federal aid] is a very small
portion of the funding that we use
to fund undergraduates," Cooper
said. "For this current year we're
spending $l2B million in institu
tional funds on financial aid and
we'll be spending $6 million in fed
eral funds for financial aid, so it's
such a small portion of our budget."

Because Pell Grants the ma
jority of Stanford's federal aid
funding are protected from the
sequester, the University should
see a marginal impact from the se
quester on its financial aid budget,
according to Cooper.

"According to NASFA, we
would lose around $50,000 from our
federal work-study allocation...
that should be the main impact to
us," said Cooper. "We spend a little
over $2 million in federal work
study specifically... so if [funding]
is lower than last year by that
amount, it actually wouldn't impact
undergraduates. What we would do
is reduce the spending on graduate
students first."

Climate of uncertainty
According to Arvin, despite the
knowledge of the impending cuts,
there is almost no understanding of
how the cuts will actually be appor
tioned for current and future re
search grants. Instead, that deter
mination has been left to the vari
ous relevant federal agencies and
internal divisions to decide in the
next few months.

"How [the cuts] will happen, we
don't know, but it has to happen
within now and the end of the fiscal
year, and then it will carry on from
there," said Arvin.

A White House press release
claims that, in light of the se
quester, "the NIH would be forced
to delay or halt vital scientific proj
ects and make hundreds of fewer
research awards" and that "the
National Science Foundation
(NSF) would issue nearly 1,000
fewer research grants and
awards", but as of now there has
been no word from those agencies
as to when those delays and de
creases in grants will be seen.
As things hold as of this
moment, "most science agen
cies will take a five percent
hit," according to Adesnik.
He noted, however, that the
situation is entirely "vari
able."

"If you're talking from a
Stanford-specific perspec
tive, it's a little to early to tell
the extent of the hit,"
Adesnik said. "Because there
hasn't been a lot of specific
guidance to or from the fed
eral agencies, each agency at
least is signaling a slightly dif

ferent approach for how
they're going to do this. We're
sort of in a wait-and-see
mode."

Lacking solutions
In terms of assessing
short and long terms solu
tions to an impending funding
crunch, Arvin offered few an
swers, citing the enormous
expense of conducting funda
mental research and Stan
ford's dependency on federal
research funding.
"If you are successful in
getting a grant that gives you
$245 [thousand], you've only
got enough money at that
rate to support two trainees
and one staff member, and
some supplies," Arvin said.

"It looks like a lot of money,
but lab research is very ex
pensive."
"We are lucky we have our
donors, but there's no donor
that can substitute $450 mil
lion a year of federal research
money," she added. "We don't
have an alternative to federal
research funding. Where
would it come from, at that
scale?"

Despite the difficulty of
finding solutions to the im
pact of the sequester cuts,
Arvin emphasized that the
cuts come at a time which has
been suboptimal for research
in general.
"It's been a very tight
funding climate for the last
five years," she said. "I
mean, we have been prepar
ing for a long time in terms
of the leadership focusing on
graduate student fellow
ships, endowed chairs for
faculty, so our strategy really
has to be to relieve the bur
den of costs where we can
find a substitute resource."
In terms of substantive

strategies, Arvin said that
the essence of any strategy
to strengthen research at
Stanford would be to cut un
necessary costs and incen
tivize faculty performance.
"We have to do every
thing we can to ensure facul
ty are competitive, and we
do that in several different
ways," she said. "We try to
offer seed grants, pilot
grants internally, for re
searchers to get preliminary
data, we also try to have
state-of-the-art shared facil
ities, because if you have
those facilities and instru

ments available you can
have more impact."
However, Arvin said that
cost cutting cannot be a goal
unto itself since indiscrimi
nate budget decreases for
faculty would diminish the
very purpose of much of the
research at Stanford edu
cation.

"Keep in mind that our
research enterprise is all
about education as well," she

said. "Now, we could just
take fewer students and hire
more research staff and be
much more efficient. Are we
going to do that? No."
While the sequester will
likely impose substantial
damage to research at uni
versities around the coun
try, Arvin emphasized that
issues associated with de
clining federal research
spending have been a press

ing issue for some time.
"We've had to think
about the declining federal
funding for several years,"
Arvin said. "We were think
ing about what to do to make
sure our faculty remain com
petitive for research before

going to do that? No."
While the sequester will
likely impose substantial
damage to research at uni
versities around the coun
try, Arvin emphasized that
issues associated with de
clining federal research
spending have been a press

ing issue for some time.
"We've had to think
about the declining federal
funding for several years,"
Arvin said. "We were think
ing about what to do to make
sure our faculty remain com
petitive for research before
anybody started talking
about the sequester."

Originally published on March

The inability of the federal gov
ernment to avert the "sequester"
automatic and across-the-board
spending cuts of $B5 billion that
came into effect last Friday will
seriously affect the state of ongoing
and future research at Stanford,
according to University adminis
trators.

In a presentation to the Faculty
Senate on Feb. 21, Vice Provost
and Dean of Research Ann Arvin
estimated that the sequester would
reduce Stanford's projected feder
al research revenues of $685 mil
lion for the 2013-14 fiscal year by
$5l million.

Grants from federal agencies,
from the National Institute of
Health to the National Science
Foundation, make up 17 percent of
Stanford's $4 billion budget and ul
timately fund 80 percent of all re
search conducted at Stanford be
yond the SLAC National Accelera
tor Laboratory.

According to Arvin, the impact
of these federal discretionary
spending cuts is "quite serious" for
the state of Stanford research,
forcing faculty to devise a number
of measures that will attempt to
bring down costs and manage their
projects more economically.
"It will affect the amount [of re
search] and the speed, if you will,
the timeline for how quickly the
work can be done and the questions
can be answered," Arvin said.

Mr. Adesnik goes to Washington
Ryan Adesnik, Stanford's Di
rector of Federal Government Re
lations, articulated his displeasure
with the nature of the cuts and the
dialogue's frustrating nature in a
phone interview with The Daily
from Washington, D.C.
"We're spending every day
communicating the damage that
the sequester cuts would inflict on
research and education, and the
country's innovation ecosystem,"
he said. "We tell them that re
search and education are invest
ments in the future of the U.S.
economy, and that has served us
very well over the years."
Adesnik argued emphatically
for federal policies that prioritize
research and education funding in
acknowledgement of the broader
societal benefits produced.

"This is how we drive new tech
nologies of the future, how we edu

cate and train the skilled workforce
of the future and it's the underpin
nings of economic future, and it
needs to be a federal priority,"
Adesnik said.

Additionally, Adesnik asserted
that the sequester, ostensibly de
vised to help manage the U.S.'s
burgeoning deficit by providing an
unpalatable alternative to Con
gress passing a more comprehen
sive piece of deficit reduction legis
lation, does not actually help fix the
situation.

"Sequestration does very, very
little to impact the deficit, because
the unsustainable growth in the
federal budget is being driven not
on the discretionary side of the fed
eral budget with the science pro
grams and financial aid, but it
comes from the mandatory side,
from the entitlements," he said.
"When you're cutting these invest
ments you're not helping the deficit
problem, you're just hindering
long-term economic growth, and
frankly part of how you handle a
deficit problem is you have eco
nomic growth."

Adesnik said that the idea of al
lowing research funding to be di
minished at a time where competi
tion around the world is increasing
is shortsighted and misguided.
"That's the absurdity," Adesnik
said. "At a time when the global
economy is getting more competi
tive and other countries are betting
on our model, we're scaling it back,
intentionally or unintentionally."

Peer institutions equally affected
Stanford's peer universities
have been affected in similar ways,
with their reliance on federal fund
ing for research leading to poten
tially grave consequences for the
state of research at those institu
tions.

Princeton University receives
roughly $2OO million a year from
the federal government, and the
cuts "could shrink the University's
federally-sponsored research
budget by $l5 to 20 million for fis
cal year 2013 and indirectly dimin
ish its endowment," according to
The Daily Princetonian.
Harvard University anticipates
cuts to its $650 million in federal
research aid budget and is consid
ering diversification of its funding
sources, as well as serious cost-cut
ting efforts.

The effects of the sequester are
also not constrained to research,
with federal financial aid programs
due to lose crucial funds. According
to a White House memo on the spe
cific losses for California residents,

"Around 9,600 fewer low income
students in California would re
ceive aid to help them finance the
costs of college and around 3,690
fewer students will get work-study
jobs that help them pay for col
lege."

According to Director of Finan
cial Aid Karen Cooper, however,
Stanford will not be overly affected
by these predictions.

"[Federal aid] is a very small
portion of the funding that we use
to fund undergraduates," Cooper
said. "For this current year we're
spending $l2B million in institu
tional funds on financial aid and
we'll be spending $6 million in fed
eral funds for financial aid, so it's
such a small portion of our budget."

Because Pell Grants the ma
jority of Stanford's federal aid
funding are protected from the
sequester, the University should
see a marginal impact from the se
quester on its financial aid budget,
according to Cooper.

"According to NASFA, we
would lose around $50,000 from our
federal work-study allocation...
that should be the main impact to
us," said Cooper. "We spend a little
over $2 million in federal work
study specifically... so if [funding]
is lower than last year by that
amount, it actually wouldn't impact
undergraduates. What we would do
is reduce the spending on graduate
students first."

Climate of uncertainty
According to Arvin, despite the
knowledge of the impending cuts,
there is almost no understanding of
how the cuts will actually be appor
tioned for current and future re
search grants. Instead, that deter
mination has been left to the vari
ous relevant federal agencies and
internal divisions to decide in the
next few months.

"How [the cuts] will happen, we
don't know, but it has to happen
within now and the end of the fiscal
year, and then it will carry on from
there," said Arvin.

A White House press release
claims that, in light of the se
quester, "the NIH would be forced
to delay or halt vital scientific proj
ects and make hundreds of fewer
research awards" and that "the
National Science Foundation
(NSF) would issue nearly 1,000
fewer research grants and
awards", but as of now there has
been no word from those agencies
as to when those delays and de
creases in grants will be seen.
As things hold as of this
moment, "most science agen
cies will take a five percent
hit," according to Adesnik.
He noted, however, that the
situation is entirely "vari
able."

"If you're talking from a
Stanford-specific perspec
tive, it's a little to early to tell
the extent of the hit,"
Adesnik said. "Because there
hasn't been a lot of specific
guidance to or from the fed
eral agencies, each agency at
least is signaling a slightly dif

ferent approach for how
they're going to do this. We're
sort of in a wait-and-see
mode."

Lacking solutions
In terms of assessing
short and long terms solu
tions to an impending funding
crunch, Arvin offered few an
swers, citing the enormous
expense of conducting funda
mental research and Stan
ford's dependency on federal
research funding.
"If you are successful in
getting a grant that gives you
$245 [thousand], you've only
got enough money at that
rate to support two trainees
and one staff member, and
some supplies," Arvin said.

"It looks like a lot of money,
but lab research is very ex
pensive."
"We are lucky we have our
donors, but there's no donor
that can substitute $450 mil
lion a year of federal research
money," she added. "We don't
have an alternative to federal
research funding. Where
would it come from, at that
scale?"

Despite the difficulty of
finding solutions to the im
pact of the sequester cuts,
Arvin emphasized that the
cuts come at a time which has
been suboptimal for research
in general.
"It's been a very tight
funding climate for the last
five years," she said. "I
mean, we have been prepar
ing for a long time in terms
of the leadership focusing on
graduate student fellow
ships, endowed chairs for
faculty, so our strategy really
has to be to relieve the bur
den of costs where we can
find a substitute resource."
In terms of substantive

strategies, Arvin said that
the essence of any strategy
to strengthen research at
Stanford would be to cut un
necessary costs and incen
tivize faculty performance.
"We have to do every
thing we can to ensure facul
ty are competitive, and we
do that in several different
ways," she said. "We try to
offer seed grants, pilot
grants internally, for re
searchers to get preliminary
data, we also try to have
state-of-the-art shared facil
ities, because if you have
those facilities and instru

ments available you can
have more impact."
However, Arvin said that
cost cutting cannot be a goal
unto itself since indiscrimi
nate budget decreases for
faculty would diminish the
very purpose of much of the
research at Stanford edu
cation.

"Keep in mind that our
research enterprise is all
about education as well," she

said. "Now, we could just
take fewer students and hire
more research staff and be
much more efficient. Are we
going to do that? No."
While the sequester will
likely impose substantial
damage to research at uni
versities around the coun
try, Arvin emphasized that
issues associated with de
clining federal research
spending have been a press

ing issue for some time.
"We've had to think
about the declining federal
funding for several years,"
Arvin said. "We were think
ing about what to do to make
sure our faculty remain com
petitive for research before
anybody started talking
about the sequester."
