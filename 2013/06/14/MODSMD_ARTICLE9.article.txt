## Sequester set to hinder research

The inability of the federal gov
ernment to avert the "sequester"
automatic and across-the-board
spending cuts of $B5 billion that
came into effect last Friday will
seriously affect the state of ongoing
and future research at Stanford,
according to University adminis
trators.

In a presentation to the Faculty
Senate on Feb. 21, Vice Provost
and Dean of Research Ann Arvin
estimated that the sequester would
reduce Stanford's projected feder
al research revenues of $685 mil
lion for the 2013-14 fiscal year by
$5l million.

Grants from federal agencies,
from the National Institute of
Health to the National Science
Foundation, make up 17 percent of
Stanford's $4 billion budget and ul
timately fund 80 percent of all re
search conducted at Stanford be
yond the SLAC National Accelera
tor Laboratory.

According to Arvin, the impact
of these federal discretionary
spending cuts is "quite serious" for
the state of Stanford research,
forcing faculty to devise a number
of measures that will attempt to
bring down costs and manage their
projects more economically.
"It will affect the amount [of re
search] and the speed, if you will,
the timeline for how quickly the
work can be done and the questions
can be answered," Arvin said.

Mr. Adesnik goes to Washington
Ryan Adesnik, Stanford's Di
rector of Federal Government Re
lations, articulated his displeasure
with the nature of the cuts and the
dialogue's frustrating nature in a
phone interview with The Daily
from Washington, D.C.
"We're spending every day
communicating the damage that
the sequester cuts would inflict on
research and education, and the
country's innovation ecosystem,"
he said. "We tell them that re
search and education are invest
ments in the future of the U.S.
economy, and that has served us
very well over the years."
Adesnik argued emphatically
for federal policies that prioritize
research and education funding in
acknowledgement of the broader
societal benefits produced.

"This is how we drive new tech
nologies of the future, how we edu

cate and train the skilled workforce
of the future and it's the underpin
nings of economic future, and it
needs to be a federal priority,"
Adesnik said.

Additionally, Adesnik asserted
that the sequester, ostensibly de
vised to help manage the U.S.'s
burgeoning deficit by providing an
unpalatable alternative to Con
gress passing a more comprehen
sive piece of deficit reduction legis
lation, does not actually help fix the
situation.

"Sequestration does very, very
little to impact the deficit, because
the unsustainable growth in the
federal budget is being driven not
on the discretionary side of the fed
eral budget with the science pro
grams and financial aid, but it
comes from the mandatory side,
from the entitlements," he said.
"When you're cutting these invest
ments you're not helping the deficit
problem, you're just hindering
long-term economic growth, and
frankly part of how you handle a
deficit problem is you have eco
nomic growth."

Adesnik said that the idea of al
lowing research funding to be di
minished at a time where competi
tion around the world is increasing
is shortsighted and misguided.
"That's the absurdity," Adesnik
said. "At a time when the global
economy is getting more competi
tive and other countries are betting
on our model, we're scaling it back,
intentionally or unintentionally."

Peer institutions equally affected
Stanford's peer universities
have been affected in similar ways,
with their reliance on federal fund
ing for research leading to poten
tially grave consequences for the
state of research at those institu
tions.

Princeton University receives
roughly $2OO million a year from
the federal government, and the
cuts "could shrink the University's
federally-sponsored research
budget by $l5 to 20 million for fis
cal year 2013 and indirectly dimin
ish its endowment," according to
The Daily Princetonian.
Harvard University anticipates
cuts to its $650 million in federal
research aid budget and is consid
ering diversification of its funding
sources, as well as serious cost-cut
ting efforts.

The effects of the sequester are
also not constrained to research,
with federal financial aid programs
due to lose crucial funds. According
to a White House memo on the spe
cific losses for California residents,

"Around 9,600 fewer low income
students in California would re
ceive aid to help them finance the
costs of college and around 3,690
fewer students will get work-study
jobs that help them pay for col
lege."

According to Director of Finan
cial Aid Karen Cooper, however,
Stanford will not be overly affected
by these predictions.

"[Federal aid] is a very small
portion of the funding that we use
to fund undergraduates," Cooper
said. "For this current year we're
spending $l2B million in institu
tional funds on financial aid and
we'll be spending $6 million in fed
eral funds for financial aid, so it's
such a small portion of our budget."

Because Pell Grants the ma
jority of Stanford's federal aid
funding are protected from the
sequester, the University should
see a marginal impact from the se
quester on its financial aid budget,
according to Cooper.

"According to NASFA, we
would lose around $50,000 from our
federal work-study allocation...
that should be the main impact to
us," said Cooper. "We spend a little
over $2 million in federal work
study specifically... so if [funding]
is lower than last year by that
amount, it actually wouldn't impact
undergraduates. What we would do
is reduce the spending on graduate
students first."

Climate of uncertainty
According to Arvin, despite the
knowledge of the impending cuts,
there is almost no understanding of
how the cuts will actually be appor
tioned for current and future re
search grants. Instead, that deter
mination has been left to the vari
ous relevant federal agencies and
internal divisions to decide in the
next few months.

"How [the cuts] will happen, we
don't know, but it has to happen
within now and the end of the fiscal
year, and then it will carry on from
there," said Arvin.

A White House press release
claims that, in light of the se
quester, "the NIH would be forced
to delay or halt vital scientific proj
ects and make hundreds of fewer
research awards" and that "the
National Science Foundation
(NSF) would issue nearly 1,000
fewer research grants and
awards", but as of now there has
been no word from those agencies
as to when those delays and de
creases in grants will be seen.
