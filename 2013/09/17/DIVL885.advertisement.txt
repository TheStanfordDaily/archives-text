Dear Students,
On behalf of the members, officers and staff of SEIU Local 2007, Welcome Back!
Service Employees International Union Local 2007 is our union and we are over 1200 Professional
Service, Technical and Maintenance employees that work at Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford
Linear Accelerator (SLAC) and at the university.
Our union is diverse, democratic and since its founding in 1969 at Stanford University our union has
won respect for service, technical and maintenance staff and has given us a voice in the University. As
members of our union we perform a broad spectrum of almost 100 different classifications that help
make Stanford University a world-class institution of teaching, research and medical care.
Every day our members cook delicious meals for you to enjoy, clean your dorms, maintain the grounds
of the most pristine university campus in the world, fix your light fixtures, set up your experiments,
keep your museum open, keep the ac and heating systems on, and our electricians will always make
sure to keep the lights on for you! We are proud of our work and the role our union plays in making
Stanford such a great place to work.
Just like we try our best to support your education at Stanford, we hope you will support our contin
ued movement for respect and justice on the job. We encourage you to take a "real life" labor studies
course by being aware and informed of labor issues in your new home at Stanford.
We look forward to helping provide you with a happy, pleasant and very memorable stay here at
Stanford University!
Sincerely,
The Members of SEIU Local 2007
