The study of Classics is an exciting, interdisciplinary subject that covers more
than 3,000 years of human history. It touches on the ways that abiding issues
(justice, death, human relations, the divine) have been articulated in every era.
Choose from five subplans: Ancient History (requiring no ancient language
study), Classical Studies, Greek, Latin or Greek & Latin, and complete the
major in 60-65 units. Minor subplans also available. Opportunities include an
honors program, co-terminal MA. degree, and department funding for travel
abroad to learn languages, visit ancient sites and examine antiquities.
