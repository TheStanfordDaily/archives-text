Hello, we re Hudson River Trading. Give us a few nanoseconds and you'll be hooked.
We are Stanford, Harvard, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and more. We are bachelors, masters and PhDs;
physicists & statisticians, engineers & mathematicians. At HRT, responsibility is
distributed according to individual impact, so a systems engineer will spend every day working
on challenging jompiltGr science problems. Become an algo developer and
you might find yourself looking at ITIdSSiVG amounts of market nd using a variety of
tools to come up with complex strategies. If you are a hacker who wants to work in a
powerful compljting environment, we want programmers who can reduce latency
and increase throughput, in a place where every second counts. And don't be foolec - we're not a
typical finance company; our coders are the most important investment we have - and they
know it. It's no secret that your compensation will be high and you will be rewarded based on
performance. Unlike other firms, our developers work in parallel with algo, because we know
programming skills are a major part of what makes us successful. We know you might think
we're a bunch of suits, but that's simply not true. We're geeks who use FreeÃŸSD, and even
have kernel committers on staff. So, if you're thinking about going to Silicon Valley to work for
a tech company, remember that's what we are and more: grub-loving, foosball-playing,
challenge-seeking problem solvers. Sound like you too? we HRT you <3
WE RE HIRING!
Algo developers, core developers and more.
HRT will be on campus for an info session on October 3rd at 6 PM,
in the Library at the Faculty Club.
