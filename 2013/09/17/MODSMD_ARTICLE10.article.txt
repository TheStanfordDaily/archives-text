## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR The 						New Stanford Daily 
### 
Journalism is a field that is
changing every day. This sum
mer, The Daily has been hard at
work charting out a vision for a
sharp, dynamic media company.

As the Stanford football team
heads into perhaps its most anticipat
ed season ever, The Daily will be
right with them, following the nation
al champion-hopeful Cardinal at
every game and behind the scenes.
Last month, The Daily football
staff published "Rags to Roses: The
Rise of Stanford Football," an insid
er account of Stanford's ascent to the
game's elite. This fall, we will expand
our football coverage with round
table discussions, weekly features
and collaboration with other Pac-12
newspapers along with pre- and
post-game reports. As usual, The
Daily will be at every game live-blog
ging and tweeting from our sports
Twitter account.

In a constantly evolving college
media landscape, The Daily is also
changing the way our work is pack
aged. Starting on Sept. 27, The Dai
ly will print a tabloid Weekender
bringing together the best of our
journalism. Every Friday, The
Weekender turns the spotlight on
one campus issue and combines our
coverage with expanded sports,
opinions and a re-imagined arts sec
tion. The tabloid format also gives us
the much-needed flexibility to show
case our media section: student work

in photo, video and graphics. For the
first time, we've planned thematic
special issues showcasing the best of
Stanford, from the innovation of our
tech scene to the best of local dining.
I'm grateful to all of The Daily's
friends and editors, past and pres
ent, that have helped bring these
ideas to life. Journalism has changed
a lot since the first Daily Palo Alto
was dropped off in 1891, but so has
The Daily. While we have pro
gressed only modestly this summer,
I hope our work results in a paper
that is more incisive, careful and en
tertaining.

In his letter to the student body
110 years ago, Editor in Chief 0. A.
Wilson 'O4 described the role of the
student newspaper. "First, it must
print all the news pertaining to the
University," he wrote, "and second,
it should be the organ of the student
body, representing their opinions on
all questions that may arise." The
Daily has too often focused on the
former at some expense to the latter;
this year we aim to produce content
that is keenly in tune with campus
life.

It is an honor to be able to repre
sent this student body, no matter
how tangentially. I hope we can do
you proud.
Thank you for reading,
