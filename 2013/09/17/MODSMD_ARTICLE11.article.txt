# What I wish I knew
## 
### Katie Kramon 
In the months between receiving
your acceptance letter and actu
ally arriving on the Farm, you
have inevitably busied your mind
with thoughts of what the next four
years will hold. You've let your expec
tations run wild and have gotten si
multaneously more nervous and ex
cited at the same time.

Questions ran through your
mind: Will I make any friends?
What will my roommate he like?
Will I party every night or lock
myself in the library ? Will I live
off Ramen Noodles and Fruit
Loops? Is the weather as nice as
I've been told it is? Can I main
tain my sense of self in a sea of
unfamiliar faces ?

Well, with all those questions, here
comes my first piece of advice: Do your
best not to have expectations.
Expectations can set you up for
failure, or at best, a rigidity that your
freshman year shouldn't be liable for.
Goals, on the other hand, are great
they're broad and help keep you
on track. So set a goal to be as happy
as possible your freshman year, or as
adventurous as possible, or whatever
you want, but don't let your goals box
you in the way expectations might.
I'll continue with a smattering of
advice that I have collected from dis
cussions with Mends about what we
wish we knew before we plunged in
to life as Stanford students. Please
have your grain of salt ready, because
these are personal observations
based only on our experiences.
I'll start with the topic of classes.
Although we've all endured them be
fore, they take on a slightly different
flavor at college where you have a
huge menu of choices.

If you can, take small classes.
Some lecture classes are definitely
necessary, but it's easy to be passive
in those classes. Smaller ones will
probably challenge you more, and
you'll get to know your classmates
and professors better. Many large
lecture classes will only push you in
the way you are all too familiar with
from high school hours of reading
and attempting to absorb too much
information too quickly.

Don't be afraid to reach out to
your professors. Whether in a small
seminai* or a giant lecture, it's always
worth a try a personal touch can
turn a good class into a great one.
Shoot your professor an email or go
to office hours. If you're the only one
there, then you'll get to know your
professor really well.

Balance your course load. Don't
limit yourself to classes falling under
the major you have prematurely cho
sen for yourself. Throw some random
ones in there. Stanford is full of peo
ple who are interested in a wide vari
ety of subjects >â€”engineers who
love writing, readers who love math
and many other combinations. Take
classes that are necessary, but also
take ones that aren't, because both
categories have about an equal
chance of being worthwhile.

But even with all this discussion
of academics, know that you will
likely learn more from your class
mates than your classes. Never
think to yourself that school should
come first, that school is more impor
tant than spending time with a
friend, meeting someone who is real
ly different from you or learning an

impromptu lesson at midnight from a
fellow procrastinator about his or her
passion in life.

Don't feel pressure to be incred
ibly busy all the time. It's okay to
have a little bit of downtime, whether
or not it's "productive." At times it
can feel as though there is a lot of
pressure to take the maximum num
ber of units, fill your plate with well
rounded extracurriculars and be
both hyper-social and physically fit.
All are worthwhile uses of time, but
so is a bit of relaxing here and there
to allow you to recharge and refocus.
Don't let Stanford define you.
Instead, help define it start a new
tradition, teach people what you love
to do, influence a discussion inside or
outside of the classroom, fight for in
stitutional changes you want to see or
go on weekend adventures. Aspire to
do great things and bring Stanford
along in your back pocket. Try to
make your own fun instead of falling
into the trap of thinking that there
are specific things you have to be do
ing in college to have a good time.
Appreciate the natural beauty
that is abundant on and around
the Farm. Lake Tahoe is close by,
along with mountain ranges in every
direction, national parks and abun
dant farmland. Campus is beautiful,
but it's great to get out of the bubble
and into nature, even if that tradition
ally hasn't been your forte. You'll
probably feel more comfortable know
ing the surrounding area and realiz
ing that you're not restricted to the
boundaries on the campus map.
On the social front, the best ad
vice is to give it time. No matter how
adaptable a person you are, it takes
time to make new close Mends. If
you think about it, you probably
shared years of experiences with the
best friends you had at home. It's on
ly realistic that it'll take a few months
to build a strong foundation with peo
ple you've just met. It might seem as
though everyone has settled into
friend groups immediately, but this
often a fagade. Hang in there
friendships are on their way; they
just don't always form overnight.
On a related note, if you're think
ing that everyone else at Stanford
has their- life figured out, realize that
so many people at Stanford are just
as lost as you are. We're young, we
have so much learning to do, and sud
denly we are all thrown together
with our insecurities and naiveties.
It's okay to be lost. If you can, talk
about it; let other people help you
through this and do the same for
them. Trust yourselfj and push for
ward with the strongest sense of
self you can build. Don't hold your
self to the vision you had of yourself
in college being in flux is part of
the life process.

I'm no great authority, and nei
ther are the many voices that helped
put this together. Instead, the above
are simply opinions and observations
to help you learn from the successes
and mistakes of those who came be
fore you. Welcome to this institution
of higher learning. Welcome to our
dysfunctional but happy family. Wel
come to Stanford. Welcome home.
