## Why Diversity Matters to Silicon Valley 
### LAURA WEIDMAN POWERS MBA '10 J.D. '10 Co-Founder Executive Director, CODE2040 
Silicon Valley has a diversity
problem, and it's time to do
something about it.

Silicon Valley is the birthplace of
a startup culture that is sweeping
the nation and the world. It is the
hub of the United States' technolo
gy industry and home to countless
innovative technology startups,
with more launching every day.

But for all its achievements in
innovation, Silicon Valley hasn't
made much progress on inclusion.
Only 6.8 percent of technical em
ployees in Silicon Valley are from
underrepresented minority groups
in a county that is almost 30 per
cent black or Latino.

This county's racial makeup is
far from unusual these days. We're
a diverse nation and only growing
more so. Indeed, in the United
States minority births outpaced
white births for the first time in
2012. And by about the year 2040,
the U.S. as a whole will be majori
ty-minority.
Given these trends, it's time to
move the discussion of the lack of
diversity in Silicon Valley from
Twitter debates to the C-suite with
founders, funders and executives
taking ownership over the issue.
That's because not only is diversity
good for Silicon Valley, Silicon Val
ley needs diversity to survive. This
is true from both a product per
spective and a talent perspective.

Flickr founder Caterina Fake
and I were recently interviewed on
Bloomberg West. Caterina took the
opportunity to explain how impor
tant diversity on her team is for the
success of her newest tech startup,
Findery.
Having a team that is reflective
of her user base is critical in the
product development process, she
said, and important not just for
company culture but also for the
success of the product, and thus the
survival of the company.
Forbes recently released a re
port showing that having racial and
other types of diversity on a team is
key to spurring innovation and crit
ical to being successful at scale. A
diverse group of employees is a
boon for the bottom line.

This is a critical insight, but it
shouldn't be too surprising. In addi
tion to the creative boost that
comes from working on a diverse

team, the population shift the Unit
ed States is undergoing means a
new consumer base that companies
need to be able to build for and
market to. Bringing those diverse
perspectives into the creation and
selling process helps reach this
fast-growing set of consumers.
Of course, the corollary to an in
creasingly diverse consumer base
is an increasingly diverse work
force. Companies today are looking
at hiring from a talent pool that
looks different from the one they're
used to targeting.

Each quarter, startups in Silicon
Valley collectively raise around $1
billion. Much of this money goes to
hiring technical talent. Silicon Val
ley is No. 2 in the nation in tech jobs
per capita, yet it's a complaint you'll
hear often if you talk to founders or
CEOs or recruiters in the Valley
that there isn't enough engineering
talent out there. Many of their open
tech jobs are going unfilled.
This is despite the fact that
those 6.8 percent of tech employees
from underrepresented groups are
drawn from a pool of computer sci
ence grads that is 18 percent black
and Latino/a. Given the shifting na
ture of the demographics of the
United States, if Silicon Valley
doesn't figure out how to engage
underrepresented minorities in the
innovation economy at scale, that
talent shortage isn't going any
where. The hyper-underrepresen
tation of minorities is threatening
Silicon Valley's future viability as
the hub of the innovation economy.
In the coming years, companies'
ability to thrive and grow will de
pend on their success in attracting,
hiring and retaining diverse talent.
Diversity won't be a nice to have
but a need to have; inclusion won't
be an abstract issue but an econom
ic imperative.

Silicon Valley is the optimal
place to experiment with how to
bring more talented individuals
from diverse backgrounds into the
fold of the tech industry. Silicon
Valley prides itself on solving prob
lems often intractable problems
that have never been solved before.

In fact, that's why my co
founder, Tristan Walker MBA 'lO,
and I decided on the Bay Area as
the place to launch CODE2O4O, a
nonprofit organization dedicated to

creating access, awareness and op
portunities for top minority engi
neering talent to ensure their lead
ership in the innovation economy.
CODE2O4O's flagship program
is our summer Fellows Program.
Through the Fellows Program, we
bring top-performing black and
Latino/a computer science students
together here in the Bay Area for
10 weeks to intern at top tech com
panies and to take part in a compre
hensive leadership development
curriculum.

Students get mentors, partici
pate in skill-building workshops
and develop their professional net
works, meeting engineers, entre
preneurs and executives from
around the industry. We place a
heavy emphasis on exposure to and
exploration of tech entrepreneur
ship as a career path.

Students get a lot out of the
summer, and, perhaps most impor
tantly, they develop a strong desire
to join the innovation economy and
bring others in their communities
along with them.

We've gotten a great reception
for CODE2O4O here in Silicon Val
ley and in the neighboring tech hub
of San Francisco. Many of the re
gion's top tech companies are excit
ed to work with us to host our stu
dents or support our programming.
But we get requests from other
cities and regions to bring
CODE2O4O's programming to their
startups and tech companies all the
time. There are plenty of places
that want to include top talent be
ing overlooked by their competi
tors.

What Silicon Valley needs to re
alize is that, as the U.S. population
shifts in the coming decades, diver
sity is going to be critical to its
growth and success. And if another
geography gets better at attracting
and supporting diverse talent and
building for a diverse consumer
base in the coming years, Silicon
Valley may lose its luster.
After all, if Silicon Valley's tech
companies don't figure how to inno
vate around inclusion, somewhere
else's will.
