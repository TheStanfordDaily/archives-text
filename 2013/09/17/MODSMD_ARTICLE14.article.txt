## StartX Demo Day eschews gadgetry for data innovation 
### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
StartX, a Stanford-affiliat
ed startup incubator, held its
summer Demo Day event on
Sept. 12, showcasing the
achievements of its latest
startup class to the local pub
lic and members of the press.

Cameron Teitelman 'lO
M.S. 'll, StartX CEO and
founder, announced that the
incubator's offices would be
temporarily moved to Moun
tain View while the program
prepares for a long-term relo
cation to a larger space near
campus thanks to a recent
three-year, $3.6-million
pledge in grant funding from
the University and Stanford
Hospital and Clinics.

Teitelman also announced
new strategic partnerships
between StartX Med the
medical and biotechnology
arm of the incubator and
Johnson & Johnson and Mer
ck.

This summer's Demo Day
focused on companies dealing

with data-centric applica
tions, including Data Fox, a
company based out of Stan
ford's Graduate School of
Business that collates the
haphazard data in the private
equity field.

Bastiaan Janmaat MBA
'l3, an advisor to Data Fox,
said that the company was
"becoming the Bloomberg for
private companies."

"The motivation for stall
ing Data Fox came from the
frustrations associated with
finding information about pri
vate companies," Janmaat
said. "We are creating the
gold standard in company
and sector analytics."
Chatous, a startup con
necting users on the Internet
anonymously based on their
personal interests, presented
for a second time this Demo
Day. The company, the prod
uct of a CS224W: Social and
Information Network Analy
sis class project, returned to
display milestones as well as
seek additional funding.

Chatous co-founder Parth

Bhakta 'l3 M.S. 'l3 men
tioned after the startup's
presentation that Chatous is
planning to release a Stan
ford-specific network in the
near future for new students
to connect with each other.

Also returning to the De
mo Day floor was Mind Sumo,
a company that allows college
students to solve problems
and quiz challenges created
by businesses in order to gain
recognition for their skills at
tackling real-world scenarios.
Trent Hazy 'O9, co-founder
of Mind Sumo, explained in
his presentation that the com
pany's products would help
students stand out to poten
tial employers in a unique and
unprecedented manner.
Hazy stated that Mind-
Sumo already has a presence
on campus with a private beta
operating since February
2012.

The other companies that
presented this year were
Fonebook, a mobile corporate
directory; Skip, a company
specializing in radio-frequen

cy identification technology
for automatically charged pur
chases in stores; Cloud Leaps,
an enterprise information

management system; Evan
tava, an event management
software; MedWhat, an intel
ligent health query respon
der; Ops Viz, a datacenter
management software;

watchup, a seamless newscast
aggregator; and Tangibleplay,

a company that makes board
games with computerization,
using computer vision tech
nology.

As StartX continues to
build upon its infrastructure
with the new grant funding,
Teitelman also announced
that eight new investments

have been approved as a part

of the new Stanford-StartX
Fund, an uncapped, opt-in

venture fund for StartX com
panies.
Two publicly announced
investments will go towards

Knotch, a mobile-based opin
ion sharing network, and Cy
tobank, a biotechnology start
up dealing with flow cytome
try.
