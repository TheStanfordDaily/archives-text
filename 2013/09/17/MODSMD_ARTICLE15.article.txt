## UAR introduces four new Academic Directors 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
In an effort to address the demands of a
growing undergraduate population, Under
graduate Advising and Research hired four
new academic directors this past spring.
The 2012-13 school year revealed a 25-per
cent increase in scheduled and drop-in ap
pointments with academic directors over the
last four years, according to Kirsti Copeland,
associate dean of residential and pre-major

advising.
Copeland explained in a statement that a
single academic director piloted the residen
tial advising program nine years ago in
Wilbur Hall. Since then the program expand
ed its initial focus on freshmen to the entire
undergraduate student population with 10 ac
ademic directors serving this year.
"We know that the program's working,
and we also know the largest frustration with
the program is people wanting more of it,"
Copeland said.

Two of the four new academic directors
are taking on newly established positions
while the other two will fill in for the outgoing
academic directors of Wilbur and Stern
Halls.

The new hires come from diverse back
grounds with various areas of expertise.
Here's a glimpse of what they have to offer:

Katie Wang
Coming from a post
doctoral program in bio
chemistry at UC-San
Francisco, Katie Wang
said she was very excited
to meet her students in
Roble Hall. Wang advised
undergraduate students in
her lab at UCSF and also
taught a course in macrobiology at the UC-
Berkeley extension campus.
"The combination of mentoring in a lab
and teaching in the classroom made me real
ize that I love working with students," Wang
said.

However, Wang is not only interested in
advising students but also wants to "hear
their stories."

"As an instructor I developed some really
special relationships with some of my stu

dents," she said. "It's incredible to me what
students are willing to share with me about
what's going on in their own lives."
Though Wang is ready to direct students
to needed resources in all areas of study, her
background in the sciences will prove benefi
cial for particular concerns. Her expertise in
cludes advising students on how to write fel
lowship applications for grants and helping
students find research positions.
Wang, and fellow newcomer Raymond
Chen, provide an academic background that,
according to Copeland, has been underrepre
sented among academic directors in the past.
But out of this year's nine academic directors
with Ph.D.s, three have degrees in the sci
ences, two in social sciences and four in the
humanities and arts.

Copeland added that while diversifying
academic backgrounds is beneficial, what
matters most is an academic director's inter
action with students across the curriculum
something for which Wang already has a
plan.
"My philosophy is kind of to just talk
about it with them and help them think about
it from a different perspective," Wang said.

Raymond Chen
Chen, also a biochem
istry expert, completed a
postdoctoral program in
his field at the Stanford
School of Medicine in 2012.
Chen also worked as a
postdoctoral research as
sistant the year before he
signed on as an academic
director last May.
But, before that, he taught a course in cell
biology at Berkeley.
"I've been really interested in educational
aspects of things and in the lab there are a lot
of opportunities for mentoring students of all
levels," Chen said.
Chen will be advising freshman in the
Wilbur Hall residences Otero, Rinconada,
Soto and TVancos as well as undergradu
ate students in Munger, Rains and Escondido
Village.
Chen received several eager advising
questions in response to an introductory
email he and his colleagues sent out to stu
dents on Aug. 20. His background in the sci

ences has already proven helpful when he
had a productive conversation with a student
who was deciding between various science
majors.

"We were able to talk... and look at other
directions and ways of coordinating her stud
ies that she didn't really think about," he
said.

Looking forward to the opportunity to
work with energetic students, Chen said he
wants to make sure his students know that
he is there for them academically.
"It's a really exciting time for students
and for me to be able to be part of that and to
have a chance to help is really rewarding,"
Chen said.

Lara Tohme
Lara Tohme, who will
serve as academic director
for Stern Hall, comes from
an entirely different back
ground. Originally from
Lebanon, Tohme speaks
four languages Arabic,
English, Italian and
French and has a back-

ground in art history.
She has had nearly 10 years of teaching ex
perience in her field at universities that include
Wellesley College and the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, where she also received her
Ph.D. in the history of architecture.
"My greatest pleasure was working with
students directly and mentoring them and
advising them," Tohme said of her teaching
experience.

Tohme has been settling into her new job
for over a month, corresponding with more
than 100 students over email so far. Thanks to
her experience working with a diverse stu
dent body, Tohme believes that she can offer
a unique perspective on the academic direc
tor role and her interest in interdisciplinary
studies will also prove to be useful.
"I have a good understanding of how dif
ferent fields work together," Tohme said.
That expertise could come in handy when
advising students in Burbank, the Stern Hall
residence that will house students in the sci
ence-humanities crossover in-residence pro
gram, SIMILE.
While Tohme is still learning the ropes at
Stanford, she said her biggest priority right

now is to make sure that she is serving her
students in the way that they need to be
served and want to be served.

"I'm just really excited to be a part of this
very vibrant community and to really get to
know the diversity that is at Stanford,"
Tohme.

Arik Lifschitz
Ai'ik Lifschitz, the aca
demic director for FroSo-
Co, Potter and Robinson, is
more familiar with working
on the Farm, serving as a
consulting assistant pro
fessor in the Management
Science and Engineering
Department for the past

four years.
Israeli-born Lifschitz moved to the United
States in 2001 and completed a Ph.D. program
in Management at Columbia University. He
has also served in a variety of faculty positions
at a few universities, including University of
the People, a tuition-free online institution.
In his past work, Lifschitz felt that one-on
one interactions with students were most re
warding and stated he is ready to help stu
dents connect with faculty and enhance their
Stanford education broadly beyond just
choosing courses and a major.
"I'm looking forward to helping people
find their purpose in education and to navi
gate though the great opportunities and the
challenges that a place like Stanford has," Lif
schitz said.

Nevertheless, he made it clear that he
would not take a direct approach when advis
ing students.
"I'm here to give them suggestions and al
so hold a mirror in front of them and help
them figure out for themselves what's going
to be the best pathway," he said. "I just try to
truly understand the issues and also find the
best solutions."
Lifschitz commented that he is most excit
ed about working with the students and see
ing how they develop over the years.
"People come here, they create hopes and
plans," he said, "and I'm hoping that I'll be
able to help them pursue them."
