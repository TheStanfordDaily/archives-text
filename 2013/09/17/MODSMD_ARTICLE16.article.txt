## Expectations stay the same through two 
### Sam Fisher 
Survive and advance. As a
preseason top-five team,
the goal is that simple.
Barring the nearly un
precedented scenario of
three BCS conference teams all go
ing undefeated, the Stanford Cardi
nal needs only to win every game to
go to the BCS National Champi
onship; style points won't matter.
That's a very good thing for Stan
ford, as the Cardinal hasn't racked
up too many style points in winning
its first two games of the season. And
though the two wins weren't pretty,
I've actually gained confidence in
Stanford's ability to go undefeated
from what I've seen so far.

Though it may not have looked
dominant at first glance, Stanford's
starting defense has been tremen
dously productive through two
games, holding both San Jose State
and Army to 13 points (Army's final
touchdown came against a group of
second and third stringers).

And while Stanford was favored
in both games, the opposing offenses
presented interesting and, in Army's
case, unique, challenges. The Spar
tans had a trio of stellar receivers and
a future NFL quarterback in David
Fales, yet Stanford was able to make
their passing attack look average.
At Army, Cardinal defenders had
to defend against a well-executed
triple-option attack, an offense they
hadn't seen since middle or high
school football. After making a few
halftime adjustments, Stanford shut
the option down. Besides shoring up
tackling and option responsibilities
here and there, the Cardinal won't
need anything more from its defense
to make a run to Pasadena.

The most exciting news, however,
came on the offensive side of the ball.
Junior wide receiver Ty Mont
gomery and senior running back
T)yler Gaffney have been spectacular
through two weeks. Their explosive
ness, field awareness and toughness
are at a level we haven't seen from
them thus far in their careers, and
there is no reason to think they won't
continue to improve. Their perform
ances have answered serious ques
tions about offensive weapons.
Yet the one thing I still need to see
before gaining confidence in a national
championship run is steadier develop
ment from junior quarterback Kevin
Hogan. Hogan looks to have better
tools than last year and is making some
strides in his accuracy, but he is not
consistently playing at a level Stanford
fans were hoping to see based on his
strong play at the end of 2012.
The two areas Hogan needs to
make the biggest improvements up
on soon are his accuracy on deep
passes and his decision-making.
Hogan finally connected on a deep ball
to Montgomery against Army, but he
was nowhere close to perfect overall in
the game. And his interception in the
end zone was about as bad of a deci
sion as we've seen from Hogan in his
short time as the starting quarter
back. Those mistakes, plus his fum
bles, cannot happen against top com
petition, which Hogan will face for the
first time on Saturday when Arizona
State comes to the Farm.

Still, there is no reason to panic or
reevaluate the Cardinal's lofty pre
season expectations. With the excep
tion of the Nov. 7 matchup against
Oregon, Stanford should be at least a
comfortable favorite in every game
on its schedule. The road trips seem
to get easier every week, as Oregon
State, Utah and USC have all suf
fered disappointing losses on their
home turf early this season. Barring
a major slip-up, no road test should
be that difficult.
The home slate will be a little
more interesting. Washington,
UCLA, Arizona State and Notre
Dame all jump out as teams with a
chance of taking down the Cardinal.
While it is certainly true that all four
of those teams have a chance to do it,
none of them have done enough to
make me fear a date with them at
Stanford Stadium; on the road, it
would be another story
So, though it's still early, I find no
reason to change my expectations. If
the Cardinal can get past Sparky on
Saturday, I think the winner of the
Nov. 7 matchup between Stanford
and Oregon plays in the national
championship with a 13-0 record.

Sam Fisher's decision-making, like
Kevin Hogan's, has fallen short of
The Daily's lofty expectations re
cently. Send him, some life advice at
