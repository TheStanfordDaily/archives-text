# PAC-12 TUSSLE
## DATE WITH ASU LOOMS AFTER WEST POINT WIN 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
For the first half of last Saturday's game, Stan
ford looked like it was still on its cross-continental
flight.

Though things certainly didn't look pretty early
on, No. 5 Stanford (2-0) used a strong second-half
surge to defeat Army (1-2) 34-20 at Michie Stadium.
Senior running back Tyler Gaffney and junior re
ceiver Ty Montgomery provided the necessary one
two punch for the Cardinal offense. Gaffney rushed
for 132 yards and a score on 20 carries with a 23-
yard touchdown reception, while the physical and
speedy Montgomery baffled the Black Knights sec
ondary with six catches for 130 yards and a touch
down of his own.

"What I love about the team today is that, when
people tell you you're supposed to win the game by
a lot, you come in at halftime and it's close, if you lis
tened to the people outside you'd get a little anx
ious," said head coach David Shaw. "In the locker
room at halftime, we were not anxious. We knew we
had to play our best, came out in the second half and
played great"
The Cardinal began the game on a rocky note

when junior quarterback Kevin Hogan coughed up
the ball on the opening possession and then suffered
a three-and-out on its next drive. Capitalizing off
Hogan's early miscue, Army tacked on two field
goals to take an early 6-0 lead in the first quarter.
Hogan bounced back by throwing a 26-yard
touchdown pass to sophomore wideout Michael
Rector, who displayed great concentration after the
ball was tipped to collect the first reception and
touchdown of his college career. Not to be outdone,
Montgomery scored a 46-yard touchdown early in
the second quarter when Hogan found him on a
deep post. Stanford struggled to pull away, though,
as Army used its triple-option run game and cut
blocks to drive down the field, producing a late
touchdown to keep the score close at 20-13 heading
into halftime.

"We kept our- calm," Gaffney said. "We tried to
keep an even keel. We went out there knowing
that six points wasn't going to win the game. We
went out there with the same mindset: keep grind
ing. We didn't overlook them. We had to keep
grinding. We were down. Adversity stepped in,
and we responded."
