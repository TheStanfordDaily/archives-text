# PAC-12 TUSSLE
## DATE WITH ASU LOOMS AFTER WEST POINT WIN 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
For the first half of last Saturday's game, Stan
ford looked like it was still on its cross-continental
flight.

Though things certainly didn't look pretty early
on, No. 5 Stanford (2-0) used a strong second-half
surge to defeat Army (1-2) 34-20 at Michie Stadium.
Senior running back Tyler Gaffney and junior re
ceiver Ty Montgomery provided the necessary one
two punch for the Cardinal offense. Gaffney rushed
for 132 yards and a score on 20 carries with a 23-
yard touchdown reception, while the physical and
speedy Montgomery baffled the Black Knights sec
ondary with six catches for 130 yards and a touch
down of his own.

"What I love about the team today is that, when
people tell you you're supposed to win the game by
a lot, you come in at halftime and it's close, if you lis
tened to the people outside you'd get a little anx
ious," said head coach David Shaw. "In the locker
room at halftime, we were not anxious. We knew we
had to play our best, came out in the second half and
played great"
The Cardinal began the game on a rocky note

when junior quarterback Kevin Hogan coughed up
the ball on the opening possession and then suffered
a three-and-out on its next drive. Capitalizing off
Hogan's early miscue, Army tacked on two field
goals to take an early 6-0 lead in the first quarter.
Hogan bounced back by throwing a 26-yard
touchdown pass to sophomore wideout Michael
Rector, who displayed great concentration after the
ball was tipped to collect the first reception and
touchdown of his college career. Not to be outdone,
Montgomery scored a 46-yard touchdown early in
the second quarter when Hogan found him on a
deep post. Stanford struggled to pull away, though,
as Army used its triple-option run game and cut
blocks to drive down the field, producing a late
touchdown to keep the score close at 20-13 heading
into halftime.

"We kept our- calm," Gaffney said. "We tried to
keep an even keel. We went out there knowing
that six points wasn't going to win the game. We
went out there with the same mindset: keep grind
ing. We didn't overlook them. We had to keep
grinding. We were down. Adversity stepped in,
and we responded."

NOTES: Stanford will face its first ranked opponent in
No. 23 Arizona State. The Sun Devils are coming off
a controversial win against Wisconsin and head on
the road for the first time in 2013. Stanford will look
to slow down ASU's standout quarterback Taylor Kel
ly and defensive tackle Will Sutton to gain the edge
in both teams' Pac-12 opener.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Junior wide receiver Ty Montgomery (above) led Stanford with six catches for 130 yards and a touchdown as the Cardinal survived an early
scare from Army to win 34-20 in West Point, N.Y. Montgomery and the Cardinal welcome Arizona State Saturday for their Pac-12 opener.
Led by seven-tackle performanc
es from fifth-year senior defensive
end Josh Mauro and junior outside
linebacker James Vaughters, Stan
ford's defense would clamp down in
the second half and allow only one
touchdown â€”in garbage time, no
less.

"[Army] came out there with a lit
tle bit different approach than what
we had seen," Mauro said. "It took
guys having the will to do their- jobs.
We made some adjustments in the
second half to stop the inside run. We
got the look all week, but it's so much
different when you're actually doing
it. All the credit to them. They played
their- butts off."

Gaffney helped the Cardinal ex
tend its lead when he found a soft
spot in Army's secondary to catch a
23-yard touchdown pass from
Hogan, who finished 11-of-18 passing
for 188 yards and three touchdowns.
A few drives later, Gaffney busted a
19-yard gain and then punched it in
from one yard out to make the score

34-13, finally putting the game out of
reach.

The Cardinal hopes to get off to a
quicker start this Saturday when it
begins Pac-12 play at home in a criti
cal showdown against No. 23 Arizona
State (2-0). Fresh off a controversial
32-30 victory over then-No. 20 Wis
consin, the Sun Devils are looking for
another statement win to bolster
their bid to win the Pac-12 South.

At the helm of the Sun Devils' up
tempo spread offense is quarterback
Taylor Kelly, who in two games has
completed 63.4 percent of his passes
for 652 yards and five touchdowns.
Against a normally stingy Badgers
defense, Kelly efficiently worked the
sidelines with his back-shoulder
throws and consistently escaped
pressure. And though Arizona State
likes to stretch the field horizontally
with four- or five-receiver sets, the
running back tandem of Marion
Grice and D.J. Foster isn't afraid to
run between the tackles either.

The most feared Sun Devil, how
ever, is consensus All-American de
fensive tackle Will Sutton, who
wreaked havoc in the backfield and
was at times unblockable last year
with 23.5 tackles for loss and 13.0
sacks. Though the Cardinal offensive

line got a strong push against an un
dersized Army front seven not
putting together its best game, but
paving the way for Gaffney nonethe
less Sutton and the Sun Devil de
fensive front, averaging nearly 296
pounds per body, will prove to be a
much stiffer test for the Tunnel
Workers Union.

Stanford avoided the injury bug
against San Jose State in the season
opener but wasn't so lucky at West
Point. Senior defensive end Henry
Anderson left the game with a knee
injury and was not listed on the
depth chart for this upcoming Satur
day. Senior cornerback Barry
Browning also appeared to be
banged up; as of Monday night, his
status for the game remains unclear.

Stanford and Arizona State clash
at Stanford Stadium on Saturday,
with national television coverage on
FOX. Kickoff is scheduled for 4 p.m.
PDT.
