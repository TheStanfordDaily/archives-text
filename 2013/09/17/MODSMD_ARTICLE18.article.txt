# HOGAN'S PROGRESS
## ROUND TABLE TALKS QUARTERBACK PLAY 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Through two games, redshirt
sophomore quarterback Kevin
Hogan has completed 63 percent of
his passes, down from nearly 72
percent last year. But those num
bers don't tell the whole story.
Hogan has been throwing to a
highly inexperienced receiver and
tight end corps this season, and he
has demonstrated improved accu
racy with his deep throws, ad
dressing arguably the most no
table flaw in his game in 2012.
With Arizona State's strong rush
defense coming to town, Stanford
will likely need to throw the ball
consistently this Saturday, beg
ging the question: How much bet
ter if at all is the early-2013
Kevin Hogan than his late-2012
counterpart? We asked football
■writers Winston Shi, Do-Hyoung
Park and David Cohn what they
thought.

Winston: I'm going to take a bit of a
cop-out: I wouldn't be worried about
Kevin Hogan's progress, but it's also too
soon to tell how good he really is. The
first thing to note is that Hogan is a good
football player —he performed ad
mirably last year, and, even if he's still
the same quarterback he was last year,
Stanford will be decent on offense. He's
making more difficult throws this year,
which I'm happy to see, but he did have a
couple throws that could have been in
terceptions he undei'threw a deep ball
to Michael Rector, and the ball actually
bounced off an Army defender's hands
before Rector caught it for a touchdown.
We also have to adjust to the level of
competition he's facing, which has not
been elite; all in all, there's a fair bit of
mystery about Kevin Hogan.
Again, that's not to say that Hogan is
bad, as he has shown signs of progress.
The fact that Hogan is making more im
pressive throws and reads is a good
thing because it indicates David Shaw's
trust in his quarterback. Even in cruis
ing victories against lower-level competi
tion where little diversity in play calling
was needed, Hogan earned much broad-


MIKE KHEIR/The Stanford Daily
Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan (center) began seeing the field midway through
the 2012 season after "the light came on" for him during Big Game week.
Hogan was one of many players to make that jump during his sophomore sea-
er play calling than last year.
We'll see how he does when
Stanford actually needs to open up
the playbook, though, as Stan
ford's passing game isn't humming
at 100 percent yet. And why
should it? David Shaw has indicat
ed throughout his head coaching
career that he doesn't care at all
about covering the spread, and a
conservative game plan is proba
bly a good idea; pollsters may care
about margin of victory, but, at the
end of the season, the only thing
that matters is the win. If Stanford
runs the table it will more than
likely be in the national champi
onship game. Might as well avoid
anything that could risk that clean
slate and shot at the national
championship game. Might as well
even avoid giving opponents any
film worth studying.

Do: While I agree with Winston

in that it is too early in the season
to read too much into Hogan's per
formance, I also think that it
would be a disservice to both
Hogan and offensive coordinator
Mike Bloomgren to ignore that
early returns on the new and im
proved Hogan have been promis
ing at the very least.
What Hogan did in the second
half of last season was just enough
to complement an excellent de
fense and help the team win
games. When he replaced Josh
Nunes under center, he brought
stellar accuracy on short passes to
Zach Ertz, his safety valve, and
still had his workhorse back in
Stepfan Taylor. But the thing that
made students and the media fall
in love with Kevin Hogan was his
escapability, an element that
pushed the Cardinal offense for
ward en route to the Rose Bowl.

And looking at 2013 Kevin
Hogan in these first two games, I
think it is safe to say that over the
offseason, he has added yet anoth
er element to his game, one that
could potentially push the Cardi
nal offense over the top this year.

This year, Hogan has been much
more comfortable in the pocket
and the coaches have let him
throw the deep ball down the side
lines to a talented corps of re
ceivers.

Call it adapting to losing both
an Ail-American tight end and the
school's all-time leading rusher to
the pros, but what I see is a young
quarterback who has developed
his game to the point where he can
throw the deep ball comfortably,
adding an explosiveness to the
passing game that was sorely lack
ing last year. Sure, he's young and
he still makes mental mistakes
and could work on his deep accura
cy (particularly because he tends
to overthrow the deep ball). But
when he does hit his man 40 or 50
yards downfield, this offense looks
a lot more like the Andrew Luck
led offense of old that makes Car
dinal fans everywhere salivate.
How many 30-plus-yard com
pletions did Hogan have all of last
season? Just three. His season
long pass play? 43 yards. How
many does he have in two games
this season? Three already. His

season-long pass play? 46 yards.
Improvement is being made and
explosiveness is being added to
the Stanford offense. The escapa
bility is still there, and this is one
talented young man that is only
getting better.
David: I believe that Kevin
Hogan has definitely improved
from the end of last season. From
my perspective on the sidelines, I
could tell that Hogan had an even
greater mastery of the playbook in
the home opener against San Jose
State. He seamlessly moved
through his progressions more
consistently, he executed better
footwork and, most strikingly, he
stepped into his longer passes with
greater frequency and with better
balance.
This was particularly evident
on Hogan's first touchdown pass
against San Jose State to junior
wide receiver Devon Cajuste,
when Hogan delivered a perfect
25-yard strike on a fly route that
Cajuste caught in stride and ran
into the end zone to complete the
40-yard score.

From a statistical perspective,
the numbers also say that Hogan
has been more effective this year.
In his first two games, Hogan has
a raw QBR, namely a QBR that
has not been adjusted for the
strength of the opponent, of 84.3
on a scale from 0 to 100, almost 20
points higher than his 2012 mark.
In addition, Hogan's improve
ment in throwing the deep ball has
led to a significant increase in his
yards-per-attempt (YPA) from
7.21 in 2012 to 8.78 in 2013. There
fore, in spite of the drop in comple
tion percentage over his first two
games as compared to last year,
Hogan has actually been even
more productive throwing the
football this season, leading to
back-to-back dominant offensive
displays from the Cardinal.

took the easy pass in his "cop-out"
of evaluating Kevin Hogan. Share

We also have to adjust to the level of
competition he's facing, which has not
been elite; all in all, there's a fair bit of
mystery about Kevin Hogan.
Again, that's not to say that Hogan is
bad, as he has shown signs of progress.
The fact that Hogan is making more im

Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan (center) began seeing the field midway through
the 2012 season after "the light came on" for him during Big Game week.
Hogan was one of many players to make that jump during his sophomore sea-
er play calling than last year.
We'll see how he does when
Stanford actually needs to open up
the playbook, though, as Stan
ford's passing game isn't humming
at 100 percent yet. And why
should it? David Shaw has indicat
ed throughout his head coaching
career that he doesn't care at all
about covering the spread, and a
conservative game plan is proba
bly a good idea; pollsters may care
about margin of victory, but, at the
end of the season, the only thing
that matters is the win. If Stanford
runs the table it will more than
likely be in the national champi
onship game. Might as well avoid
anything that could risk that clean
slate and shot at the national
championship game. Might as well
even avoid giving opponents any
film worth studying.

Do: While I agree with Winston

in that it is too early in the season
to read too much into Hogan's per
formance, I also think that it
would be a disservice to both
Hogan and offensive coordinator
Mike Bloomgren to ignore that
early returns on the new and im
proved Hogan have been promis
ing at the very least.
What Hogan did in the second
half of last season was just enough
to complement an excellent de
fense and help the team win
games. When he replaced Josh
Nunes under center, he brought
stellar accuracy on short passes to
Zach Ertz, his safety valve, and
still had his workhorse back in
Stepfan Taylor. But the thing that
made students and the media fall
in love with Kevin Hogan was his
escapability, an element that
pushed the Cardinal offense for
ward en route to the Rose Bowl.

And looking at 2013 Kevin
Hogan in these first two games, I
think it is safe to say that over the
offseason, he has added yet anoth
er element to his game, one that
could potentially push the Cardi
nal offense over the top this year.

This year, Hogan has been much
more comfortable in the pocket
and the coaches have let him
throw the deep ball down the side
lines to a talented corps of re
ceivers.

Call it adapting to losing both
an Ail-American tight end and the
school's all-time leading rusher to
the pros, but what I see is a young
quarterback who has developed
his game to the point where he can
throw the deep ball comfortably,
adding an explosiveness to the
passing game that was sorely lack
ing last year. Sure, he's young and
he still makes mental mistakes
and could work on his deep accura
cy (particularly because he tends
to overthrow the deep ball). But
when he does hit his man 40 or 50
yards downfield, this offense looks
a lot more like the Andrew Luck
led offense of old that makes Car
dinal fans everywhere salivate.
How many 30-plus-yard com
pletions did Hogan have all of last
season? Just three. His season
long pass play? 43 yards. How
many does he have in two games
this season? Three already. His

season-long pass play? 46 yards.
Improvement is being made and
explosiveness is being added to
the Stanford offense. The escapa
bility is still there, and this is one
talented young man that is only
getting better.
David: I believe that Kevin
Hogan has definitely improved
from the end of last season. From
my perspective on the sidelines, I
could tell that Hogan had an even
greater mastery of the playbook in
the home opener against San Jose
State. He seamlessly moved
through his progressions more
consistently, he executed better
footwork and, most strikingly, he
stepped into his longer passes with
greater frequency and with better
balance.
This was particularly evident
on Hogan's first touchdown pass
against San Jose State to junior
wide receiver Devon Cajuste,
when Hogan delivered a perfect
25-yard strike on a fly route that
Cajuste caught in stride and ran
into the end zone to complete the
40-yard score.

From a statistical perspective,
the numbers also say that Hogan
has been more effective this year.
In his first two games, Hogan has
a raw QBR, namely a QBR that
has not been adjusted for the
strength of the opponent, of 84.3
on a scale from 0 to 100, almost 20
points higher than his 2012 mark.
In addition, Hogan's improve
ment in throwing the deep ball has
led to a significant increase in his
yards-per-attempt (YPA) from
7.21 in 2012 to 8.78 in 2013. There
fore, in spite of the drop in comple
tion percentage over his first two
games as compared to last year,
Hogan has actually been even
more productive throwing the
football this season, leading to
back-to-back dominant offensive
displays from the Cardinal.

Through two games, redshirt
sophomore quarterback Kevin
Hogan has completed 63 percent of
his passes, down from nearly 72
percent last year. But those num
bers don't tell the whole story.
Hogan has been throwing to a
highly inexperienced receiver and
tight end corps this season, and he
has demonstrated improved accu
racy with his deep throws, ad
dressing arguably the most no
table flaw in his game in 2012.
With Arizona State's strong rush
defense coming to town, Stanford
will likely need to throw the ball
consistently this Saturday, beg
ging the question: How much bet
ter if at all is the early-2013
Kevin Hogan than his late-2012
counterpart? We asked football
■writers Winston Shi, Do-Hyoung
Park and David Cohn what they
thought.

Winston: I'm going to take a bit of a
cop-out: I wouldn't be worried about
Kevin Hogan's progress, but it's also too
soon to tell how good he really is. The
first thing to note is that Hogan is a good
football player —he performed ad
mirably last year, and, even if he's still
the same quarterback he was last year,
Stanford will be decent on offense. He's
making more difficult throws this year,
which I'm happy to see, but he did have a
couple throws that could have been in
terceptions he undei'threw a deep ball
to Michael Rector, and the ball actually
bounced off an Army defender's hands
before Rector caught it for a touchdown.
