# HOGAN'S PROGRESS
## ROUND TABLE TALKS QUARTERBACK PLAY 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Through two games, redshirt
sophomore quarterback Kevin
Hogan has completed 63 percent of
his passes, down from nearly 72
percent last year. But those num
bers don't tell the whole story.
Hogan has been throwing to a
highly inexperienced receiver and
tight end corps this season, and he
has demonstrated improved accu
racy with his deep throws, ad
dressing arguably the most no
table flaw in his game in 2012.
With Arizona State's strong rush
defense coming to town, Stanford
will likely need to throw the ball
consistently this Saturday, beg
ging the question: How much bet
ter if at all is the early-2013
Kevin Hogan than his late-2012
counterpart? We asked football
■writers Winston Shi, Do-Hyoung
Park and David Cohn what they

Winston: I'm going to take a bit of a
cop-out: I wouldn't be worried about
Kevin Hogan's progress, but it's also too

mirably last year, and, even if he's still
the same quarterback he was last year,
Stanford will be decent on offense. He's
making more difficult throws this year,
which I'm happy to see, but he did have a
couple throws that could have been in
terceptions he undei'threw a deep ball
to Michael Rector, and the ball actually
bounced off an Army defender's hands
before Rector caught it for a touchdown.
We also have to adjust to the level of
competition he's facing, which has not
been elite; all in all, there's a fair bit of
mystery about Kevin Hogan.
Again, that's not to say that Hogan is
bad, as he has shown signs of progress.
The fact that Hogan is making more im
pressive throws and reads is a good
thing because it indicates David Shaw's
trust in his quarterback. Even in cruis

was needed, Hogan earned much broad-

the 2012 season after "the light came on" for him during Big Game week.
Hogan was one of many players to make that jump during his sophomore sea-
