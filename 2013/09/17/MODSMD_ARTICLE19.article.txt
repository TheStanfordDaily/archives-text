NO. 5 STANFORD (2-0)
VS. NO. 23 ARIZONA STATE (2-0)

GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 31, ARIZONA STATE 2< : This is the Car
dinal's first litmus test of the year. Arizona State quarterback Tay
lor Kelly really impressed me with his accurate back-shoulder
throws and pocket awareness against a stout Wisconsin defense
this past weekend. Reminiscent of what Arizona quarterback
Matt Scott did to Stanford last year, I think Kelly will be able to
frustrate the Cardinal defense with the underneath passes early
in the game. After watching the Sun Devils struggle with stopping
Wisconsin's power running game, there's reason to believe that
Tyler Gaffney will be able to burst for a few big runs, which then
should set up well for Kevin Hogan's play-action passes. But I al
so expect the Cardinal offense to use a few wrinkles that it has
been saving for this game, like using Kelsey Young on bubble
screens or Stanford's much-questioned Wildcat plays. The Cardi
nal should win by at least a touchdown, but it's lucky that the
game isn't being played in the desert.

SAM FISHER
STANFORD 27, ARIZONA STATE 16:
This game presents a tough test for the Cardinal, though not as
tough as I thought before watching the Sun Devils squeak past
Wisconsin on Saturday night. Defensive tackle Will Sutton
leads a strong Arizona State defense that could present some
problems for Kevin Hogan and company, but the Badgers ex
posed some serious gaps on the edge that Stanford has the
personnel to exploit. Look for Stanford to give Sparky a heavy
dose of Kelsey Young and Ty Montgomery on the outside
both of them run a similar type of sweep to that of Wisconsin
running back Melvin Gordon, who gashed the Sun Devils all
night long and for the Cardinal defense to come up big be
hind what should be a pretty wild freshmen-led crowd.

MICHAEL PETERSON
STANFORD 34, ARIZONA STATE 20:
Coming off of one of the most bizarre endings to a game in col
lege football history, Arizona State is very fortunate to be stand
ing at 2-0. Wisconsin's running game gashed the Sun Devils
for 231 yards, exposing what once appeared to be a stout run
defense. Tyler Gaffney and Anthony Wilkerson will look to do
the same, although Ail-American defensive tackle Will Sutton
will be a challenge for the middle of the offensive line. Expect
Stanford to establish the run early but to do the most damage
later through deep passes to Ty Montgomery and Devon Ca
juste. Kevin Hogan threw a few longer passes against Army, in
cluding three touchdown passes of more than 20 yards, and
against an Arizona State team looking to improve upon its run
defense, the opportunities will be available to make big plays in
the passing game. The game will stay close in the first half, but
Hogan and the wide receivers will blow it open in after halftime.
