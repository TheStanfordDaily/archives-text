# HOW THE LIGHT CAME ON FOR KEVIN HOGAN
## When the light comes on it's time to shine 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
When we first heard it, we
thought it was just about
Kevin Hogan a unique
phrase, for unique cir
cumstances. How often
does a redshirt freshman unseat a senior
quarterback on a top-15 team, nine games
into the season, much less? One week he
was a third-stringer, still an afterthought
following the preseason competition to re
place Andrew Luck; the next week he was
tasked with leading Stanford to the Rose
Bowl berth Luck never attained. From the
outside looking in, at least, there was some
thing uncanny about Hogan's ascension.
Only head coach David Shaw's descrip
tion could suffice: "The light came on."
The metaphor was as eloquent as it was
simple. For the young, mobile and unpol
ished quarterback that Hogan was in early
2012, all it took to become the leader of one
of the most complex offenses in the nation
was that final bit of understanding an
Aha! moment.

But even as Hogan solidified himself as
the Cardinal's starter for 2013, the catchy
analogy lived on. This summer, Shaw revis
ited the phrase in reference to two young
defenders, junior Ra'Chard Pippens and
sophomore Noor Davis, who were on the
verge of achieving then* potential; later, jun
ior safety Jordan Richards used it to de
scribe his own development as a player the
season before. It became clear that Hogan's
moment of epiphany was not the only one of

its kind.
So what is this metaphorical light, exact
ly? Is it a question of building the physical
tools needed to play big-time college foot
ball? Is it related to mastering Stanford's in
famously complex playbook? Or is it just
about a young player's comfort level on a
new team?
"It's everything," Shaw recently ex
plained.
By that, he doesn't just mean it's all en
compassing. In many cases, it can also be a
prerequisite to seeing the field.
"It's up to us coaches to always look for
that in young players," Shaw said. "Some
guys, they're right there, they're right
there, and then all of a sudden they get it
now it's up to us to recognize that and use
them in places where they are comfortable
and they can execute then* jobs."
The light means different things to dif
ferent people. It remains off longer for some
players than for others, and chances are
that's why you haven't yet seen certain
prized recruits play much on Saturdays.
Every position has its own intangibles to
master, and every player has his own obsta
cles to surmount.
But one thing is certain. When the light
does come on, it's hard not to notice.

If there's a narrative crucial to the Cardi
nal in all this, it's the intellectual aspect of
football. Stanford's coaches know that the
elite athletes they recruit are elite students
as well, and in turn, they put then* players'
cognitive abilities to the test with complex
schemes that resemble those used in the
NFL.

"I think they put more on our plate be
cause they know we have the ability to un
derstand it," said backup inside linebacker
Blake Martinez, a sophomore. "Today our
coach was putting checks in, and we all an
swered, and he was like, 'Wow, this makes it
easy when we have a Stanford student and
player in our pockets.'"

Certainly, the mental barrier once stood
in the way of Hogan, who only became the
starter once he had learned enough of the
playbook and consistently made the right
decisions on the fly. That's to be expected for
a position as complex as quarterback. But
Stanford players' smarts aren't enough on
their own.

"The fact that we know our guys are
bright enough to take up a lot of scheme, to
pick up a lot of different things that we can
do, I think that takes away some of the just
pure learning part of it," Shaw said. "But the
physical part of it, the emotional part of it,
sometimes that's just growing."
A big part of that growth is getting used
to the speed of college football. With the pro
liferation of hurry-up offenses such as Ore
gon's, Stanford's defenders, for example,
don't have time to confirm a play call from
the sideline with a teammate. And once the
ball is snapped, the players across the line of
scrimmage move much quicker than the
high school opponents that a recruit is used
to. The same applies on the offensive side of
the ball, especially, of course, for Hogan.

Asked to describe what it looks like when
the light comes on for an athlete, both offen
sive coordinator Mike Bloomgren and de-

fensive coordinator Derek Mason
noted that it's as if "the game slows
down" for that player.
"It's the fact of knowing it and do
ing it fast," Shaw said. "It's one thing
to know it. We've got a lot of players
here, especially young guys in the
classroom they can draw it all up. If
you ask them a question, they answer
the question. But [it's another story]
when the 40-second clock is going and
the defense is changing and they have
to change their call from one to the
next."

"When you step between the
white lines and you step on the foot
ball field, it's your job to know your
playbook," agreed Mason. 'And so
that's where the pressure lies. So I
think when you look at the intellec
tual part, it plays into it, but I think
it really has more to do with
whether a young man is invested in
the process. And the earlier he in
vests, the more he gets out of it."

That work is needed to build what
Shaw calls a "physical history," the ac
cumulation of months if not years
of coaching and reps. And it goes
beyond just the complexities of the
Cardinal's playbook. Senior nose
tackle David Parry said that for the
defensive line, something as simple as
yelling "pass" or "ball" each play in
practice makes the habit instinctual
on game days.

So even in the case of the elusive
light, it appears that the old adage
holds true: Practice makes perfect.
"My dad calls it, 'Suns up and suns
down,"' Shaw said. "It's just young
players, they need days. They need
more days. They need to hear it over
and over and over again. They need to
see it again and again, and they need
to do it again and again... Until it
crystallizes, you can't ever play fast."
♦ ♦♦
The time component alone fails to
tell the full story Some current Stan
ford player's, such as fifth-year senior
linebacker Shayne Skov, stepped into
starting roles when they were true
freshmen and excelled right away In
that regard, Shaw also cited former
Cardinal running back Stepfan Taylor
'l3, the school's rushing leader, who
backed up Heisman TVophy finalist To
by Gerhart 'lO as a true freshman.
On the other end of the spectrum
are players like former right tackle
Derek Hall 'lO. Hall appeared in just
two games his first four years, switch
ing from defense to offense; he was so
low on the depth chart, Shaw admitted,
that the coaches figured he would nev
er see significant playing time. But the
light came on for Hall in the training
camp before his fifth and final season,
and he stalled for Stanford at right
tackle that year.
"Young men develop differently,"
Mason said. "Some young men come in
and are ready to play. Some young
men come in and it takes longer."
There's one moment in a player's
career in which the light is perhaps the
most likely to come on, however, and
that's the training camp before sopho
more year:

That was certainly the case for sen
ior inside linebacker A. J. Tarpley, who
helped fill in for an injured Skov in
2011. Familiarity with the program
aided Ikrpley in his second go around,
but he was also fueled by something

else that preseason: having spent a
redshirt year on the sidelines, unable
to contribute.

"Forme, it was just [to] keep grind
ing, keep working hard," Tarpley said.
"Put your head down, you've got noth
ing to say. Just let your actions do the
talking."
Though many member's of Stan
ford's 2012 recruiting class, often
called the best in school history, also
had a chip on their shoulder this offsea
son, several other's are merely looking
to take the next step after playing mi
nor roles as true freshmen. Martinez
falls into that category, as does offen
sive lineman Josh Gamett, who is slot
ted as the backup left guard. Bloom
gren said that he wasn't convinced
Gamett would be ready at the end of
last season, but that he made enough
strides in the spring and summer to
become one of the team's two "Ogre"
tight ends.
"[Gamett is] not at a point where
he'd feel completely comfortable to
play a whole game," Bloomgren said,
"but in all of his roles, he is doing real
ly well."
"I think the light is starting to come
on," Gamett agreed. "It's still getting
brighter."
Even though the Ogre role is a bit
different than playing guard, where
Gamett could very well start in 2014, it
gets him onto the playing field consis
tently on Satm'days. For a young play
er, that's a big step toward the light
coming on.

"You can see the signs of it in prac
tice, but you can't My establish it until
game time," Tarpley hinted. "It proba
bly doesn't happen until the actual
lights come on."
It didn't for Hogan last season. He
made his first collegiate appearance in
a loss against Washington, coming in
for one play and making the wrong
read.

Hogan got six snaps against Cal
three weeks later, firing a laser as he
rolled to his right for his first career
touchdown pass. That, Shaw has said,

is when the light came on. After seeing
more time against Washington State
the following week, Hogan played
most of the game in relief duty at Col
orado and took over as the team's
starter one week later. Stanford hasn't
lost since.

"Sometimes it's overnight," Shaw
said. "Like Kevin. One week, he didn't
get it. He just didn't get it. And the
next week, he gets it. And understands
it. And he wants to execute it."
♦ ♦♦
At other positions, the light can be
much harder to spot. One of the telltale
signs for Shaw is when a player drops
his shoulders, as if to say "I got it."
Even when he was coaching from the
press box, Shaw learned to study his
receivers' smallest movements.

"When you coach for a while, you
come to look for it," Shaw said. "I can
see a guy's body language. He leaves
the huddle, he's not real sure—you
can see it out here in practice, guys are
still thinking as they leave the huddle...
But those guys that break the huddle
and line up quickly they know what
they're doing."
While Shaw is able to gather details
from pre-snap alignment, the coaching
staff is also concerned with how well its
players handle assignment—deciding
who to block (on offense) or cover (on
defense) and adjustment—chang
ing those duties before and during the
play

"We talk all the time about Triple-
A, which is alignment, assignment and
adjustment," Bloomgren said. "To me,
the light comes on when you see them
able to anticipate and make those ad
justments on the run."
Nowhere is that adjustment more
apparent than under center. Stanford's
quarterback comes to the line of scrim
mage with two or three plays and, af
ter evaluating the defense, is tasked
with checking into the correct one.
That ability is what made Andrew
Luck 'l2 unique amongst his fellow
quarterback prospects, and it's one of
the main skills that Hogan needed to

work on last season before he could
earn the starting job.
Once Hogan was ready to play,
Bloomgren explained, he only got bet
ter with the confidence he gained from
his dominant performance against
Colorado. Though Hogan threw for a
modest 184 yards in that game, he got
his team into the right play consistent
ly leading the Cardinal on six consecu
tive scoring drives.

Confidence is a factor on the other
side of the ball as well though some
times, Cardinal defenders' most intim
idating foes are the ones they face in
practice.
"You need a physical light to come
on," Martinez said, "because when
you're coming up and you have to go
up against [senior guard David]
Yankey and that type of big, muscle,
physical, huge man-beast, you just
have to think, 'Oh, I have to get this. I
can't be scared. I've got to go. I've got
to be able to strike, get off and use all
my techniques.'"
And if a player can focus on his
technique, that means he's not think
ing as much about the play itself. The
game becomes more automatic; finally,
it slows down.

"You realize it in the games, or even
in practice, when you don't have to
think as much," Garnett said. "Like,
'Oh, yeah, I would've never known that
last year.'... That light really clicks, and
you know what you're doing without
having to really think about it."
"[lt's] the ability to go up there and
not be thinking about the snap count,
not be thinking about, 'Who do I
block?'" Bloomgren added. "It's the
ability to get up there, get in your
stance and fire off and hit somebody
in the face and chive them forever."
♦♦♦
Hogan won all five of his games as
a starter last season, the first four
against ranked teams and the fifth
against Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl.
But even though Hogan's light had
come on he had grasped the play
book, he had learned the checks and

he had the confidence to do it all in a
big game his development was not
complete. This offseason he led play
ers-only captains' practices during the
summer, scripting plays for the of
fense as a coach would during the sea
son.

It's a step that the coaching staff
loves to see.
"He starts to take a vested inter
est in what we do and actually what
his work looks like," Mason said of a
developing player. "He actually starts
to autograph his w0rk...1 see the
light coming on when a young man re
ally starts to take to heart what his
work looks like."

Shaw's expression, then, needs
some clarification. The light may
come on in an instant, but it needs
some time to get brighter—just like
the stadium lights referenced by
Tarpley. And even though that special
moment of clarity is easier to notice,
easier to report about and easier to
pack into a deceptively simple phrase
than the continued development that
follows, at the end of the day, it's not
really everything.
Details aside, the hght metaphor
will again be a part of Stanford's nar
rative in 2013. Stanford's roster is lit
tered with players whose shoulders
have dropped in the last 12 months
Hogan, Parry, Garnett and Mar
tinez, to name a few —and its ranks
are filled by dozens more who are
waiting for their own time to come.
While the Cardinal probably won't
have another upheaval at the quar
terback position, chances are that a
few new faces will make it onto the
field on Saturdays this fall.
No one can say whose hght will
come on next, of course, and it's much
harder than just flicking a switch. But
that won't stop Stanford's coaches
from looking for that spark.
"If you could bottle it and sell [it],"
Bloomgren said, "we'd all buy it."
