# HOW THE LIGHT CAME ON FOR KEVIN HOGAN
## When the light comes on it's time to shine 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
When we first heard it, we
thought it was just about
Kevin Hogan a unique
phrase, for unique cir
cumstances. How often
does a redshirt freshman unseat a senior
quarterback on a top-15 team, nine games
into the season, much less? One week he
was a third-stringer, still an afterthought
following the preseason competition to re
place Andrew Luck; the next week he was
tasked with leading Stanford to the Rose
Bowl berth Luck never attained. From the
outside looking in, at least, there was some
thing uncanny about Hogan's ascension.
Only head coach David Shaw's descrip
tion could suffice: "The light came on."
The metaphor was as eloquent as it was
simple. For the young, mobile and unpol
ished quarterback that Hogan was in early
2012, all it took to become the leader of one
of the most complex offenses in the nation
was that final bit of understanding an
Aha! moment.

But even as Hogan solidified himself as
the Cardinal's starter for 2013, the catchy
analogy lived on. This summer, Shaw revis
ited the phrase in reference to two young
defenders, junior Ra'Chard Pippens and
sophomore Noor Davis, who were on the
verge of achieving then* potential; later, jun
ior safety Jordan Richards used it to de
scribe his own development as a player the
season before. It became clear that Hogan's
moment of epiphany was not the only one of

its kind.
So what is this metaphorical light, exact
ly? Is it a question of building the physical
tools needed to play big-time college foot
ball? Is it related to mastering Stanford's in
famously complex playbook? Or is it just
about a young player's comfort level on a
new team?
"It's everything," Shaw recently ex
plained.
By that, he doesn't just mean it's all en
compassing. In many cases, it can also be a
prerequisite to seeing the field.
"It's up to us coaches to always look for
that in young players," Shaw said. "Some
guys, they're right there, they're right
there, and then all of a sudden they get it
now it's up to us to recognize that and use
them in places where they are comfortable
and they can execute then* jobs."
The light means different things to dif
ferent people. It remains off longer for some
players than for others, and chances are
that's why you haven't yet seen certain
prized recruits play much on Saturdays.
Every position has its own intangibles to
master, and every player has his own obsta
cles to surmount.
But one thing is certain. When the light
does come on, it's hard not to notice.

If there's a narrative crucial to the Cardi
nal in all this, it's the intellectual aspect of
football. Stanford's coaches know that the
elite athletes they recruit are elite students
as well, and in turn, they put then* players'
cognitive abilities to the test with complex
schemes that resemble those used in the
NFL.

"I think they put more on our plate be
cause they know we have the ability to un
derstand it," said backup inside linebacker
Blake Martinez, a sophomore. "Today our
coach was putting checks in, and we all an
swered, and he was like, 'Wow, this makes it
easy when we have a Stanford student and
player in our pockets.'"

Certainly, the mental barrier once stood
in the way of Hogan, who only became the
starter once he had learned enough of the
playbook and consistently made the right
decisions on the fly. That's to be expected for
a position as complex as quarterback. But
Stanford players' smarts aren't enough on
their own.

"The fact that we know our guys are
bright enough to take up a lot of scheme, to
pick up a lot of different things that we can
do, I think that takes away some of the just
pure learning part of it," Shaw said. "But the
physical part of it, the emotional part of it,
sometimes that's just growing."
A big part of that growth is getting used
to the speed of college football. With the pro
liferation of hurry-up offenses such as Ore
gon's, Stanford's defenders, for example,
don't have time to confirm a play call from
the sideline with a teammate. And once the
ball is snapped, the players across the line of
scrimmage move much quicker than the
high school opponents that a recruit is used
to. The same applies on the offensive side of
the ball, especially, of course, for Hogan.

the light comes on for an athlete, both offen
