# Busy summer on the course
## Rodgers, Wilson highlight strong summer for Cardinal golfers 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Golf is one of the sports without a true offseason. Although the
spring and summer seasons are the most popular times for hitting
the courses and links, tournaments occur year round. The Stan
ford men's and women's golf teams know this all too well; even af
ter making postseason runs into late May, members of both squads
were very active during their respective breaks from school.
The men led by coach Conrad Ray had their 2013 season
end prematurely at the NCAA Columbus Regional in May but did
n't have much time to think about the disappointment.
Junior Patrick Rodgers was back in action before Spring Quar
ter finals ended, competing in the prestigious Palmer Cup at
Wilmington Country Club in Delaware from June 7-9. The annual
tournament, which pits American collegiate golfers against their
European counterparts, was won by the Americans 20.5 - 9.5
the largest margin of victory since the United States took the 2001
competition by a score of 18 - 6.
Rodgers won three of his four of his matches two singles and
one of two foursomes and halved the other, teaming with Ala
bama junior Justin Thomas in both foursomes. Rodgers went on to
take third at the Northeast Amateur in Rumford, R. 1., less than
two weeks later. After missing the cut at a Web.com tour event, the
two-time PING All-American recorded one of his best perform
ances to date by placing 15th at the PGA Tour John Deere Classic.
Rodgers beat out past major champions Y.E. Yang and Keegan
Bradley and would have taken home a check for $71,300 had he
been a professional.
After playing in a tournament in upstate New York with fellow
Cardinal golfers Cameron Wilson and Andrew Yun, Rodgers
shredded the course at the Western Amateur in Roland, Ark., win
ning the stroke-play portion of the event with a record-setting 18-
under cumulative score but falling in the round of 16 during the
subsequent match-play portion. He also advanced to the round of
16 at the U.S. Amateur in August.
Rodgers concluded his long summer at the Walker Cup, a bien
nial battle of the top amateurs from the United States and Great
Britain and Ireland. In his second appearance in the clash of con
tinents, Rodgers went 2-and-2 in an American victory.
Rodgers' teammate Cameron Wilson also enjoyed success dur
ing the past few months. The senior recorded five top-five finishes
during his summer, including an outright win, in eight total events.
In two tournaments, he tied for first but lost on the third playoff
holes.
The other highlights for the men's squad included a win by the

recently graduated Yun at the Sahalee Players Championship in
June, sophomore David Boote's first foray onto the European
Tour in late August and incoming freshman Maverick McNealy's
4th-place performance at the 89th California State Fair Men's Am
ateur a few weeks before the start of school.
Second-year head coach Anne Walker's women's golfers had an
even deeper run in the postseason than their male counterparts,
finishing tied for 13th at the NCAA Championships in Athens, Ga.
Despite recording its highest placing since 2007, the group didn't
relish in the resurgence for long.
Sophomore Mariah Stackhouse teed-off again on May 28 at the
Industry Hills Golf Club in southern California at one of the 20
U.S. Women's Open sectional qualifying tournaments. She claimed
a solid victory with a 36-round score of 139 (68-71). Making her
second U.S. Open appearance this time at Sebonack Golf Club
in Southampton, N.Y. Stackhouse once again missed the cut.
In late July, Stackhouse traveled to the historic Pinehurst Re
sort in North Carolina for the 111 th North and South Amateur
Championship. After finishing in a three-way tie for first in the
stroke play half of the event, Stackhouse defeated Emma Levy of
Tulane in the opening round of match play. She wasn't able to re
tain her momentum, however, falling to Michelle Piyapattra of Co
lumbia in the quarterfinals.
Stackhouse's classmate Lauren Kim coming off an impres
sive freshman campaign but often overshadowed by Stackhouse
also had a solid summer of golf, highlighted by a win at the 47th
California Women's Amateur. Kim entered the match play portion
of the late-August tournament as the No. 1 seed. After rolling
through her first four opponents, Kim faced Harvard's Tiffany
Lim in the finals. Down four holes with six to play, Kim started a
furious rally that included three birdies over the last five holes to
force a playoff. Kim ultimately prevailed in the playoff to claim the
title.
Other notable performances in the past few months from the
sixth-ranked Stanford women's golf team included recently grad
uated Sally Watson's appearance in the U.S. Women's Open and
the LPGA Q-School. The Scottish native failed to make the cut at
the former but advanced through the first stage of the latter.
Incoming freshman Casey Danielson was also busy, playing in
multiple high-profile events such as the Canadian Amateur, the
PING Junior Solheim Cup and the U.S. Women's Amateur.
Both the men's and women's squads play tournaments
throughout the fall before gearing up for their main NCAA slate
in the spring.
