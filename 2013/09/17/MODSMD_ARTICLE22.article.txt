# Soccer squads start strong

### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
For most teams, an overtime
loss in the NCAA semifinals to
the eventual champions would
make for a successful end to the
season. Most teams, however,
aren't like Stanford women's soc
cer. The Cardinal has appeared
in five straight NCAA College
Cups dating back to 2008, and af
ter winning the national champi
onship in 2011, falling short in
2012 was a tough pill to swallow.
The Stanford women plan to
return with a vengeance in 2013,
with their eyes still set on the ul
timate prize. The Cardinal was
ranked second in the original
preseason poll, only behind per
petual rival North Carolina.
Through the first six games, the
team has posted a 5-0-1 record,
including a double-overtime win
over Boston College to open the
season. The Cardinal tied peren
nial power Portland 1-1 on Aug.
31.
The team has a new identity
this season, as 2012 captains and
All-Americans Alina Garcia
mendez, Mariah Nogueira and
Rachel Quon who had held
down the back third of the field
for four years have all depart
ed.
The Cardinal's newly named
captains—junior Alex Doll and
seniors Emily Oliver, Kendall
Romine and Courtney Verloo
will be called upon to fill the lead
ership void this season. The team
will also look to junior Chioma
Übogagu and senior Sydney
Payne, who each tallied five goals
last season, to continue adding
firepower to the Cardinal attack.
Furthermore, for Stanford,
it's always about reloading

rather than rebuilding. One of
this year's additions includes
transfer Taylor Uhl, who was the
NCAA's leading scorer as a mem
ber of the Minnesota Gophers
last year. Uhl, a junior, has al
ready demonstrated her prolific
scoring touch by scoring six goals
in the Cardinal's first five games.
"It's going to be a really fun
and exciting attack this year,"
Verloo told GoStanford.com.
"The offense is so talented in dif
ferent areas. I think there will be
goals from the forwards, from
the midfielders, and I wouldn't
be surprised if some defenders
got in."
Head coach Paul Ratcliffe also
brought in a highly regarded
class of eight freshmen, five of
whom have already recorded
starts during the early part of
the team's season.
The most intriguing prospect
is Jane Campbell, who was the
youngest goalkeeper ever called
into a full United States national
team camp. However, the Cardi
nal already has one of the best
goalkeepers in the nation in Oliv
er, who has started 58 games
over her first three years at
Stanford, tallying 26 shutouts
and a 0.34 goals against average.
"We have a great group of
keepers," Ratcliffe told GoStan
ford.com. "Whichever one is in
form for that week and steps in
between the goal posts is going
to do an amazing job for us. It's
still up in the air. No one has es
tablished anything and said, 'l'm
going to start every game.'"
Oliver and Campbell have
split the first six games evenly
(each starting three), but the way
