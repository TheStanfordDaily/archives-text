# Soccer squads start strong
## 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
For most teams, an overtime
loss in the NCAA semifinals to
the eventual champions would
make for a successful end to the
season. Most teams, however,
aren't like Stanford women's soc
cer. The Cardinal has appeared
in five straight NCAA College
Cups dating back to 2008, and af
ter winning the national champi
onship in 2011, falling short in
2012 was a tough pill to swallow.
The Stanford women plan to
return with a vengeance in 2013,
with their eyes still set on the ul
timate prize. The Cardinal was
ranked second in the original
preseason poll, only behind per
petual rival North Carolina.
Through the first six games, the
team has posted a 5-0-1 record,
including a double-overtime win
over Boston College to open the
season. The Cardinal tied peren
nial power Portland 1-1 on Aug.
31.
The team has a new identity
this season, as 2012 captains and
All-Americans Alina Garcia
mendez, Mariah Nogueira and
Rachel Quon who had held
down the back third of the field
for four years have all depart
ed.
The Cardinal's newly named
captains—junior Alex Doll and
seniors Emily Oliver, Kendall
Romine and Courtney Verloo
will be called upon to fill the lead
ership void this season. The team
will also look to junior Chioma
Übogagu and senior Sydney
Payne, who each tallied five goals
last season, to continue adding
firepower to the Cardinal attack.
Furthermore, for Stanford,
it's always about reloading

rather than rebuilding. One of
this year's additions includes
transfer Taylor Uhl, who was the
NCAA's leading scorer as a mem
ber of the Minnesota Gophers
last year. Uhl, a junior, has al
ready demonstrated her prolific
scoring touch by scoring six goals
in the Cardinal's first five games.
"It's going to be a really fun
and exciting attack this year,"
Verloo told GoStanford.com.
"The offense is so talented in dif
ferent areas. I think there will be
goals from the forwards, from
the midfielders, and I wouldn't
be surprised if some defenders
got in."
Head coach Paul Ratcliffe also
brought in a highly regarded
class of eight freshmen, five of
whom have already recorded
starts during the early part of
the team's season.
The most intriguing prospect
is Jane Campbell, who was the
youngest goalkeeper ever called
into a full United States national
team camp. However, the Cardi
nal already has one of the best
goalkeepers in the nation in Oliv
er, who has started 58 games
over her first three years at
Stanford, tallying 26 shutouts
and a 0.34 goals against average.
"We have a great group of
keepers," Ratcliffe told GoStan
ford.com. "Whichever one is in
form for that week and steps in
between the goal posts is going
to do an amazing job for us. It's
still up in the air. No one has es
tablished anything and said, 'l'm
going to start every game.'"

split the first six games evenly
(each starting three), but the way

stable of keepers will be worth
watching as the season progresses.
Stanford will face St. Mary's on
Sept. 19 before rounding out non
conference play against Santa
Clara on Sept. 22. The Cardinal
opens its Pac-12 season at Col
orado on Sept. 28.

The men's team is also looking
to bounce back from a disappoint
ing finish in 2012. Although the
Cardinal capped off its season with
a dominating 6-1 win over Cal, it
wasn't enough to earn the team a
berth in the NCAA tournament af
ter a rollercoaster season.

The primary objective for sec
ond-year head coach Jeremy Gunn
will be to replace the scoring pro
duction of graduated forward
Adam Jahn, who is currently play
ing with the San Jose Earthquakes
of the MLS.

Junior Zach Batteer (6 goals in
2012) is the team's leading return
ing scorer, and he will be joined in
the attack by reigning Pac-12
Freshman of the Year Aaron Kovar
(3 goals) and Senior Class Award
finalist JJ Koval (2 goals).
"Players like JJ and Zach are
great examples of what we've been
looking for as progress in the pro
gram," Gunn told GoStanford.com,
noting that both players became
dangerous finishers through their
work over the winter and spring.

Junior Drew Hutchins returns
to the net for the Cardinal after tal
lying live shutouts last year. He will
lead a back line that includes re
turning starters senior Tyler Con
klin, junior Jimmy Callinan and
sophomore Brandon Vincent.
"What's really impressive about
this group is that there are so many
future leaders," Gunn told GoStan
ford.com. "I think it probably ties
into the whole philosophy at a place
like Stanford where you've got peo
ple who want to be doing rather
than watching."
Stanford is also working in a
group of eight impressive fresh
men from all over the country. For
ward Jordan Morris and defender
Brian Nana-Sinkam have both
started three games for the Cardi
nal while forward Mark Verso has
also seen time.
The Cardinal has seen solid re
sults in early tests so far this year.
Stanford opened its season with a
3-3 tie against No. 2 Maryland in a
match that Stanford led through 85
minutes before the Terrapins
recorded a late equalizer. The Car
dinal fell to No. 17 Georgetown be
fore bouncing back with a 1-0 win
over Bay Area rival Santa Clara
and a 2-1 victory against Grand
Canyon.
Batteer and Koval have picked
up right where they left off by each
tallying two goals through the Car
dinal's first four games. Stanford
has scored five goals in four games,
although they were aided by an
own goal in the Maryland game.

Stanford will need to continue
building its postseason resume be
fore it begins Pac-12 play on Oct. 3
against Washington last season,
the team's inconsistent results ear
ly in the season kept them out of
the tournament despite finishing
third in the Pac-12.

"As we move forward, the goals
are going to be to always be in con
tention to win the Pac-12 other
teams have been very successful
over the past and it's going to be
tough to dislodge them, but a very
realistic goal is that we can do
that," Gunn told GoStanford.com.
"Moving forward from that, we
want to be in the national tourna
ment every year and ultimately we
want to become the best program
in the nation. We want to be com
peting for national championships
as much as everyone else at this
university does."

"We have a great group of
keepers," Ratcliffe told GoStan
ford.com. "Whichever one is in
form for that week and steps in
between the goal posts is going
to do an amazing job for us. It's
still up in the air. No one has es

going to start every game.'"

stable of keepers will be worth
watching as the season progresses.
Stanford will face St. Mary's on
Sept. 19 before rounding out non
conference play against Santa
Clara on Sept. 22. The Cardinal
opens its Pac-12 season at Col
orado on Sept. 28.

The men's team is also looking
to bounce back from a disappoint
ing finish in 2012. Although the
Cardinal capped off its season with
a dominating 6-1 win over Cal, it
wasn't enough to earn the team a
berth in the NCAA tournament af
ter a rollercoaster season.

The primary objective for sec
ond-year head coach Jeremy Gunn
will be to replace the scoring pro
duction of graduated forward
Adam Jahn, who is currently play
ing with the San Jose Earthquakes
of the MLS.

Junior Zach Batteer (6 goals in
2012) is the team's leading return
ing scorer, and he will be joined in
the attack by reigning Pac-12
Freshman of the Year Aaron Kovar
(3 goals) and Senior Class Award
finalist JJ Koval (2 goals).
"Players like JJ and Zach are
great examples of what we've been
looking for as progress in the pro
gram," Gunn told GoStanford.com,
noting that both players became
dangerous finishers through their
work over the winter and spring.

Junior Drew Hutchins returns
to the net for the Cardinal after tal
lying live shutouts last year. He will
lead a back line that includes re
turning starters senior Tyler Con
klin, junior Jimmy Callinan and
sophomore Brandon Vincent.
"What's really impressive about
this group is that there are so many
future leaders," Gunn told GoStan
ford.com. "I think it probably ties
into the whole philosophy at a place
like Stanford where you've got peo
ple who want to be doing rather
than watching."
Stanford is also working in a
group of eight impressive fresh
men from all over the country. For
ward Jordan Morris and defender
Brian Nana-Sinkam have both
started three games for the Cardi
nal while forward Mark Verso has
also seen time.
The Cardinal has seen solid re
sults in early tests so far this year.
Stanford opened its season with a
3-3 tie against No. 2 Maryland in a
match that Stanford led through 85
minutes before the Terrapins
recorded a late equalizer. The Car
dinal fell to No. 17 Georgetown be
fore bouncing back with a 1-0 win
over Bay Area rival Santa Clara
and a 2-1 victory against Grand
Canyon.
Batteer and Koval have picked
up right where they left off by each
tallying two goals through the Car
dinal's first four games. Stanford
has scored five goals in four games,
although they were aided by an
own goal in the Maryland game.

Stanford will need to continue
building its postseason resume be
fore it begins Pac-12 play on Oct. 3
against Washington last season,
the team's inconsistent results ear
ly in the season kept them out of
the tournament despite finishing
third in the Pac-12.

"As we move forward, the goals
are going to be to always be in con
tention to win the Pac-12 other
teams have been very successful
over the past and it's going to be
tough to dislodge them, but a very
realistic goal is that we can do
that," Gunn told GoStanford.com.
"Moving forward from that, we
want to be in the national tourna
ment every year and ultimately we
want to become the best program
in the nation. We want to be com
peting for national championships
as much as everyone else at this
university does."

For most teams, an overtime
loss in the NCAA semifinals to
the eventual champions would
make for a successful end to the
season. Most teams, however,
aren't like Stanford women's soc
cer. The Cardinal has appeared
in five straight NCAA College
Cups dating back to 2008, and af
ter winning the national champi
onship in 2011, falling short in
2012 was a tough pill to swallow.
The Stanford women plan to
return with a vengeance in 2013,
with their eyes still set on the ul
timate prize. The Cardinal was
ranked second in the original
preseason poll, only behind per
petual rival North Carolina.
Through the first six games, the
team has posted a 5-0-1 record,
including a double-overtime win
over Boston College to open the
season. The Cardinal tied peren
nial power Portland 1-1 on Aug.
31.
The team has a new identity
this season, as 2012 captains and
All-Americans Alina Garcia
mendez, Mariah Nogueira and
Rachel Quon who had held
down the back third of the field
for four years have all depart
ed.
The Cardinal's newly named
captains—junior Alex Doll and
seniors Emily Oliver, Kendall
Romine and Courtney Verloo
will be called upon to fill the lead
ership void this season. The team
will also look to junior Chioma
Übogagu and senior Sydney
Payne, who each tallied five goals
last season, to continue adding
firepower to the Cardinal attack.
Furthermore, for Stanford,
it's always about reloading

rather than rebuilding. One of
this year's additions includes
transfer Taylor Uhl, who was the
NCAA's leading scorer as a mem
ber of the Minnesota Gophers
last year. Uhl, a junior, has al
ready demonstrated her prolific
scoring touch by scoring six goals
in the Cardinal's first five games.
"It's going to be a really fun
and exciting attack this year,"
Verloo told GoStanford.com.
"The offense is so talented in dif
ferent areas. I think there will be
goals from the forwards, from
the midfielders, and I wouldn't
be surprised if some defenders
got in."
Head coach Paul Ratcliffe also
brought in a highly regarded
class of eight freshmen, five of
whom have already recorded
starts during the early part of
the team's season.
The most intriguing prospect
is Jane Campbell, who was the
youngest goalkeeper ever called
into a full United States national
team camp. However, the Cardi
nal already has one of the best
goalkeepers in the nation in Oliv
er, who has started 58 games
over her first three years at
