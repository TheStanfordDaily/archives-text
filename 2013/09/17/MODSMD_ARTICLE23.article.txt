# SHERMAN LAUGHS LAST
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Sunday was a big day for Stan
ford's big guys around the NFL.
Coby Fleener 'll caught four
passes for 69 yards and a touchdown,
Zach Ertz'l3 snagged two passes for
58 yards, Jim Dray 'lO grabbed five
passes for 31 yards and Levine Toilo
lo 'l3 recorded his first NFL recep
tion for a 4-yard gain in an eventfiil
week for former Stanford tight ends.
Fleener's touchdown reception
came with 13 minutes left in the sec
ond quarter as he caught a 3-yard
pass from fellow Cardinal alum An
drew Luck 'l2. The touchdown
pulled the Colts within four points of
the Dolphins as they trailed 14-10,
eventually falling 24-20.
Ertz was only targeted twice by
Eagles quarterback Michael Vick
but made the most of his opportuni
ties with a 31-yard reception and a
27-yard reception, the two longest of
his young career. His productive day
even earned him a few snaps in the
red zone, although he was never tar
geted inside of the 20-yard line.
In addition, Dray led the Arizona
Cardinals with five receptions in the
Cardinals' 25-21 win over the Detroit
Lions. Luck, however, fell just short.
Looking for yet another fourth
quarter comeback, Colts quarter
back Luck drove the team to the Dol
phins 23-yard line before the rally
came up short as Luck was sacked
on fourth down and the Colts turned
the ball over.

"I guess I'm a little angry at my
self," Luck told ESPN. "Again, cred
it to [the Dolphins], they put us in all
these situations, but I feel like we are
a better team than what we showed
out there."

A year ago, Luck and the Colts
defeated the Dolphins and their
quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who
was selected in the same draft (and
same round) as Luck, 23-20 in anoth

er down-to-the-wire finish in which
Tannehill couldn't deliver for the
Dolphins on their final chive. In that
game, Luck broke the rookie passing
record with 433 yards. The up-and
coming Dolphins and their young
quarterback may be forming a bud
ding rivalry with Luck and the Colts.
In Sunday's contest, Luck fin
ished 25-for-43 with 321 yards with a
touchdown and an interception. Af
ter posting a league-leading 95.1
QBR in Week 1, Luck managed a
51.5 QBR in Week 2, still a re
spectable performance coming from
a quarterback who received as little
protection from his offensive line as
Luck did.
Even after Colts' owner Jim Ir
say called out Indianapolis' protec
tion of Luck after Week 1, the Colts'
offensive fine continued to struggle
in supplying sufficient time for Luck
to work. The lack of protection was
never more apparent than on the
Colts' final play of the game as Luck
was sacked by a four-man rash after
only a couple seconds. Luck was
sacked three times and was pres
sured on several other plays, per
haps contributing to this week's drop
in QBR.
Possibly the most anticipated
matchup between those with Stan
ford connections in the NFL, and
certainly the matchup causing the
most Stanford mentions by the
broadcasting crew, was the 49ers and
the Seahawks on Sunday Night
Football. The year's first showdown
between the Seahawks, led by
Richard Sherman 'lO, and Jim Har
baugh's 49ers ended in a 29-3 victory
for Sherman and the Seahawks as
they cruised at home.
Despite playing four years under
Harbaugh at Stanford, Sherman
stirred up controversy this past off
season, saying that Harbaugh is "not
[his] coach." The NBC Sunday Night

Cornerback Richard Sherman '10 (above) had a strong performance
in his Seattle Seahawks' victory over Jim Harbaugh and the San
Francisco 49ers. Sherman helped seal the win with a late interception.
