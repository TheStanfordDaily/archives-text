# Swimming's Cal problem

"Beat Cal."
It's a slogan that adorns cardinal red shirts
throughout the year, and one that will have partic
ular significance for the men's swimming and div
ing team this fall.

The perennial national title contenders from
Berkeley have always been a thorn in Stanford
aquatics' side. However, the competition between
the Cardinal and its cross-bay rivals came to a
head last spring when the Golden Bears topped
Stanford in the Pac-12 championship, ending
Stanford's 31-year streak as conference champi
ons.

Cal went on to place second in the NCAA
championship meets falling just short of win
ning the national title for a third straight year
while Stanford finished a disappointing seventh.
It was the first time in over two decades that the
Cardinal finished outside of the top four in the na
tional championship.

Despite the disappointing finish to last season,
the Cardinal has several reasons to be confident
that the 2013-14 season will yield better results.
Two of those reasons are juniors Rristian
Ipsen and David Nolan.

Ipsen has made a substantial impact on both
the national and international stage. The Olympic
bronze medalist cruised through the NCAA
Championship Meets last season, claiming na
tional titles in both the one-meter and three-me
ter springboard events, with a close second in the
platform diving event. The squad will also be bol
stered by senior Noah Garcia and three-time
NCAA Diving Coach of the Year Rick Schavone.
Nolan, one of the most heavily recruited swim
mers in recent history, has quickly proven to be a
top all-around collegiate swimmer. The junior
claimed two individual national titles at the
NCAA Championships in the 200-yard individual
medley (IM) and the 100-yard backstroke while
picking up three Ail-American honors.

The team will also look to Junior Drew Cos
garea who proved to be a threat in the

freestyle, backstroke and IM last season —as
well as rising sophomore Tom Kremer, who gave
very promising performances in the NCAA
Championships.

After Aaron Wayne graduated at the end of
last season, however, the Cardinal will need to bol
ster its sprinting corps. Freshman Connor Black,
a top-five recruit in the nation, will look to make an
immediate impact for the team.
The Cardinal will also look to Charlie Wiser, a
freshman from the East Bay, to make a big im
pression. Wiser's claim to fame is that he swam
the second-fastest high school time in history in
the 100-yard breaststroke. Wiser will look to
translate that success into collegiate aquatics.

The women's swimming and diving team will
face a new challenge in competing against the
Golden Bears this year. Cal claimed the most cov
eted recruitment in recent history during the off
season when it was announced that Missy Franklin
who won four gold medals and one bronze in the
2012 Olympic Games had chosen to swim for
Berkeley.

In addition to new opposition, the Cardinal will
look to bounce back from a tough season ending.
While the team claimed its third Pac-12 Champi
onship in the last four years in early March of last
season, it fell to eighth place in the NCAA Cham

pionships a few weeks later in the face of stronger
competition.

Despite a disappointing finish and the loss of
All-American Andi Murez, Stanford has its fair
share of talent to tout this year. Junior Maddy
Schaefer and seniors Felicia Lee and Maya Dißa
do proved themselves last season as strong, effec
tive swimmers and stand out as important players
to guide the Cardinal as it looks to contend again
in the national picture.

Lee was a key asset last season, setting a new
Stanford record with her 51.58-second time in the
100-yard backstroke at the NCAA Champi
onships and swimming in five relays for the Cardi
nal. Dißado also finished in the top five in three in
dividual races at the NCAAs earning All-
American honors in each and, along with Lee,
was part of the team that finished with a school
record time in the 400-yard medley relay.
The Cardinal, with strong swimmers all
around the board and a diving corps led by senior
Stephanie Phipps the reigning 3-meter spring
board Pac-12 champion—will look to continue its
recent streak of Pac-12 dominance after it begins
its dual-meet season on Sept. 26 against San Jose
State at Avery Aquatics Center.
