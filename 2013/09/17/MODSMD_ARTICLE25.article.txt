# BACK AND FORTH WITH ARIZONA STATE
## Inside look at Cardinal's date with Arizona State 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's
football game between Stanford
and Arizona State, The Daily's
Do-Hyoung Park chatted with
The State Press's Joshua Na
tion to get perspective from
both camps. Below is a partial
transcript of their conversa
tion. For the full back-and
forth, go to www.StanfordDai
ly. comlcategory I sports.
Do-Hyoung Park (DP): First of
all, thanks so much for taking time
out of your evening to do this; we
really appreciate it. Before any
thing else, congratulations on the
win against Wisconsin on Saturday.
Although there was some sloppy
play on both sides and the contro
versy at the end, a win is a win. How
does the team feel about that right

now?
Joshua Nacion (JN): I knew
that was going to be the first thing
addressed! After the game on Sat
urday, Arizona State felt really
good about the win even though it
took a crazy play for the Sun Devils
to win the game. As for the Fumble
gate, the players were just being
told what they've been told all
through training camp to jump on
the ball when in doubt. The biggest
issue Arizona State took away from
the game was that it kept shooting
itself in the foot not just in the fi
nal drive but in several instances
earlier, whether it was dropped
passes or bad coaching. Todd Gra
ham was in a great mood in Mon
day's press conference, so the Sun
Devils are all focused for this
week's game at Stanford.
DP: And moving forward from
that game, it must have helped that
you faced Wisconsin a team
very similar to Stanford in its ap
proaches on both sides of the ball
before you travel up to the Bay
Area to take on the Cardinal on
Saturday. Do you expect the Sun
Devils to be better prepared to face
Stanford's physical attack on both
sides of the ball after having faced
the same thing from the Badgers
and maybe oiling out some of the
kinks last weekend?
JN: I think Arizona State will
be. We asked Graham about it in to
day's press conference, and he said
Stanford and Wisconsin are very
similar in philosophies and how
they are put together, only Stan
ford is a more talented team. Like
you said, Arizona State still has
some kinks particularly in run
blocking but it worked out well
that the Sun Devils practically used
Wisconsin as a scout team for Stan
ford.

DP: Stanford isn't really a team
that lights up the scoreboard, and a
lot of us are expecting this to be a
physical, hard-fought and close
game. What do you think the Sun
Devils will have to do in particular
to find that edge on top of that bat

tie this weekend?
JN: Arizona State definitely has
to control the tempo and use its of
fense. The Sun Devils have enough
offensive weapons to score anyway
they want to, but things can really
fall apart if the Sun Devils don't
have a rhythm to their game. De
fensively, Arizona State loves to
live by the "bend-and-don't-break"
mentality,and it just needs to stop
giving up the game-changing plays.
DP: Regarding the offense I
know Arizona State had high ex
pectations for Marion Grice and DJ
Foster out of the backfield during
the preseason, but they haven't re
ally produced the explosiveness or
game-changing plays as of yet that
the team would have hoped for.
With that in mind and coming up
against one of the best rush defens
es in the country at Stanford, do
you think that it will be more up to
Taylor Kelly to establish the pass
ing game early and often to try and
control the tempo?

JN: That was the case in the
game against Wisconsin, and that's
what Arizona State might do again
against Stanford. Despite not hav
ing those breakout plays, the Sun
Devils turned to Kelly and his arm.
It was a question coming into the
season, but the receiving corps this
year is actually better than last
season. A better receiving corps
spreads out the field more and
keeps the defense guessing. Grice
and Foster have been quiet, but

they'll be lethal again once the de
fense stops focusing its entire at
tention on the backfield.

DP: In your opinion, what will
be the most important matchup
this Saturday between the two
teams?

JN: The battle in the trenches
on both sides. Stanford has a clear
advantage and Arizona State is a
little bit undersized on both, but
the Sun Devils did slightly better
than some expected against Wis
consin. The running game will be
vital for both teams and that will all
come down to whose offensive/de
fensive lines dominate more.

JN: What do you have as a final
score for the game?
DP: I'm going to go ahead and
say Stanford 27, ASU 17. The Sun
Devils will keep it close through
out, but Stanford's improved of
fense and the pressure on Taylor
Kelly will keep the Sun Devils from
pulling ahead.

What do you think?
JN: I'll say 30-24.1 think Stan
ford will probably jump out to a big
lead to start but the Sun Devils will
orchestrate a rally to try and come
back, but fall short. I like this Ari
zona State team much better than
last year's edition, but I think we'll
see some mistakes repeat from last
year, especially on the road against
the No. 5 team in the nation.

JN: That was the case in the
game against Wisconsin, and that's
what Arizona State might do again
against Stanford. Despite not hav
ing those breakout plays, the Sun
Devils turned to Kelly and his arm.
It was a question coming into the
season, but the receiving corps this
year is actually better than last
season. A better receiving corps
spreads out the field more and
keeps the defense guessing. Grice
and Foster have been quiet, but

they'll be lethal again once the de
fense stops focusing its entire at
tention on the backfield.

DP: In your opinion, what will
be the most important matchup
this Saturday between the two
teams?

JN: The battle in the trenches
on both sides. Stanford has a clear
advantage and Arizona State is a
little bit undersized on both, but
the Sun Devils did slightly better
than some expected against Wis
consin. The running game will be
vital for both teams and that will all
come down to whose offensive/de
fensive lines dominate more.

JN: What do you have as a final
score for the game?
DP: I'm going to go ahead and
say Stanford 27, ASU 17. The Sun
Devils will keep it close through
out, but Stanford's improved of
fense and the pressure on Taylor
Kelly will keep the Sun Devils from
pulling ahead.

What do you think?
JN: I'll say 30-24.1 think Stan
ford will probably jump out to a big
lead to start but the Sun Devils will
orchestrate a rally to try and come
back, but fall short. I like this Ari
zona State team much better than
last year's edition, but I think we'll
see some mistakes repeat from last
year, especially on the road against
the No. 5 team in the nation.

In advance of Saturday's
football game between Stanford
and Arizona State, The Daily's
Do-Hyoung Park chatted with
The State Press's Joshua Na
tion to get perspective from
both camps. Below is a partial
transcript of their conversa
tion. For the full back-and
forth, go to www.StanfordDai
ly. comlcategory I sports.
Do-Hyoung Park (DP): First of
all, thanks so much for taking time
out of your evening to do this; we
really appreciate it. Before any
thing else, congratulations on the
win against Wisconsin on Saturday.
Although there was some sloppy
play on both sides and the contro
versy at the end, a win is a win. How
does the team feel about that right

now?
Joshua Nacion (JN): I knew
that was going to be the first thing
addressed! After the game on Sat
urday, Arizona State felt really
good about the win even though it
took a crazy play for the Sun Devils
to win the game. As for the Fumble
gate, the players were just being
told what they've been told all
through training camp to jump on
the ball when in doubt. The biggest
issue Arizona State took away from
the game was that it kept shooting
itself in the foot not just in the fi
nal drive but in several instances
earlier, whether it was dropped
passes or bad coaching. Todd Gra
ham was in a great mood in Mon
day's press conference, so the Sun
Devils are all focused for this
week's game at Stanford.
DP: And moving forward from
that game, it must have helped that
you faced Wisconsin a team
very similar to Stanford in its ap
proaches on both sides of the ball
before you travel up to the Bay
Area to take on the Cardinal on
Saturday. Do you expect the Sun
Devils to be better prepared to face
Stanford's physical attack on both
sides of the ball after having faced
the same thing from the Badgers
and maybe oiling out some of the
kinks last weekend?
JN: I think Arizona State will
be. We asked Graham about it in to
day's press conference, and he said
Stanford and Wisconsin are very
similar in philosophies and how
they are put together, only Stan
ford is a more talented team. Like
you said, Arizona State still has
some kinks particularly in run
blocking but it worked out well
that the Sun Devils practically used
Wisconsin as a scout team for Stan
ford.

DP: Stanford isn't really a team
that lights up the scoreboard, and a
lot of us are expecting this to be a
physical, hard-fought and close
game. What do you think the Sun
Devils will have to do in particular
to find that edge on top of that bat

tie this weekend?
JN: Arizona State definitely has
to control the tempo and use its of
fense. The Sun Devils have enough
offensive weapons to score anyway
they want to, but things can really
fall apart if the Sun Devils don't
have a rhythm to their game. De
fensively, Arizona State loves to
live by the "bend-and-don't-break"
mentality,and it just needs to stop
giving up the game-changing plays.
DP: Regarding the offense I
know Arizona State had high ex
pectations for Marion Grice and DJ
Foster out of the backfield during
the preseason, but they haven't re
ally produced the explosiveness or
game-changing plays as of yet that
the team would have hoped for.
With that in mind and coming up
against one of the best rush defens
es in the country at Stanford, do
you think that it will be more up to
Taylor Kelly to establish the pass
ing game early and often to try and
control the tempo?

JN: That was the case in the
game against Wisconsin, and that's
what Arizona State might do again
against Stanford. Despite not hav
ing those breakout plays, the Sun
Devils turned to Kelly and his arm.
It was a question coming into the

year is actually better than last
season. A better receiving corps
spreads out the field more and
