# BACK AND FORTH WITH ARIZONA STATE
## Inside look at Cardinal's date with Arizona State 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's
football game between Stanford
and Arizona State, The Daily's
Do-Hyoung Park chatted with
The State Press's Joshua Na
tion to get perspective from
both camps. Below is a partial
transcript of their conversa
tion. For the full back-and
forth, go to www.StanfordDai
ly. comlcategory I sports.
Do-Hyoung Park (DP): First of
all, thanks so much for taking time
out of your evening to do this; we
really appreciate it. Before any
thing else, congratulations on the
win against Wisconsin on Saturday.
Although there was some sloppy
play on both sides and the contro
versy at the end, a win is a win. How
does the team feel about that right

now?
Joshua Nacion (JN): I knew
that was going to be the first thing
addressed! After the game on Sat
urday, Arizona State felt really
good about the win even though it
took a crazy play for the Sun Devils
to win the game. As for the Fumble
gate, the players were just being
told what they've been told all
through training camp to jump on
the ball when in doubt. The biggest
issue Arizona State took away from
the game was that it kept shooting
itself in the foot not just in the fi
nal drive but in several instances
earlier, whether it was dropped
passes or bad coaching. Todd Gra
ham was in a great mood in Mon
day's press conference, so the Sun
Devils are all focused for this
week's game at Stanford.
