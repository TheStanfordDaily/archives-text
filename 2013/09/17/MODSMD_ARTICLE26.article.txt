# Athletics, not Duck Syndrome, make Stanford a special place
## 
### Winston Shi 
The coining of "Stanford
duck syndrome" is proba
bly one of the worst things
that has happened to
Stanford in recent years.
As an incoming freshman, it's still
fairly likely that you have heard of
this term. And no, it has nothing to do
with Oregon Ducks football espe
cially not after Stanford derailed Ore
gon's national championship hopes
last year.
For the uninitiated, Stanford duck
syndrome is a term that describes
students' obsession with seeming at
ease despite various sorts of inner
desperations. A duck, after all, ap
pears to glide smoothly on the surface
of the water while its legs paddle furi
ously below. Somehow, Stanford stu
dents have managed to view some
thing that is quite typical around the
globe as a disease unique to our own
university. I assure you that it is not.
There are a lot of things that make
Stanford special, but the desire to
seem cool is not one of them.

One of the things that does make
Stanford special is its athletics pro
gram. (I am a sports columnist
why wouldn't I say that?) Its success
is unparalleled. Champions play in
Palo Alto. Stanford has the nation's
longest active streak of national
championships, attempts to field an
elite team in every sport it supports
and has a stranglehold on the annual
prize for America's best athletic pro
gram, the Director's Cup. Stanford's
success is not to be taken for granted,
but at times it does seem like a fact of
life.

Now, you could ask what relevance
sports have to Stanford's educational
mission and that would be an ex
cellent question indeed. The athletics
program does not release statistics on
its financial impact to the University.
Many schools support athletics pro
grams as a subtle form of advertising,
but it's not as if we need the publicity.
Anybody who has seen the tourist
mobs around here knows that I speak
the truth.

But for both players and fans,
sports are invaluable to the Stanford
community for a very simple reason:
They give us a chance to relax and for
get about who we are.

It is one of the ironies of life on the
Farm that, in a place where academic
excellence is prized and celebrated,
we nevertheless glorify success that is
achieved without hard work. At some
point in time, we were all the cocky
classroom virtuosos who aced the test
without studying, glided between de
fensemen on the hockey rink or sight
read sonatas on the piano. I can imag
ine that coming into Stanford, many
of you will be hoping that such a
lifestyle will continue. I can also reas
sure you that at Stanford, it is at least
possible to appear as if nothing has
changed â€”to act as though success
comes effortlessly to you, even when
it doesn't.

On a certain level, that's a good
thing. Effortless perfection is what
will forever be expected of us, so we
might as well practice it here.
But duck syndrome is not healthy.
It's just not. Which is why we have

sports.
The Stanford University Athletics
Department is in the business of
catharsis. On the court or the field or
the pool or the sidelines or the stands,
we find opportunities for excitement
and terror, sorrow and joy and some
socially acceptable release from emo
tionless vanity. People would be
shocked and disappointed if some
body screamed in triumph after pass
ing their organic chemistry midterm,
but cheering and celebration are ac
ceptable on the football field.
If we feel a need to cry, we ran to
our rooms to do it; similarly and para
doxically, it is where we are most
tightly gathered that we afford our
selves the chance to smile. There are
very few occasions where there are
more students in one place than at a
football game; bringing our far-flung
community together gives us the
chance to find some release. Every
body gets to smile and cry together in
a socially acceptable manner. Sports
make Stanford a better place; that's
why schools that de-emphasized foot
ball, like the Ivy League schools or
the University of Chicago, didn't
scrap athletics altogether.

But and this is one of the main
knocks people tend to have against
athletics sports have a tendency to
distort the world as well. Any escape
from reality threatens to throw our
priorities askew. Even if you get up at
6 a.m. every day to work out before
school staitod, your sport is still a
game.

Very few people are capable of
turning their love into a profession.
Even on Stanford's heralded football
team, fewer than half of the players
will make an NFL practice squad;
three or four players a year will carve
out a lasting career. Indeed, the un
predictability of a sporting career is
Stanford's greatest selling point
why pass up the chance to get a great
education? The degree comes first.
The degree always comes first. Many
people here would have done nearly
anything to get into Stanford, and it
always perplexes me how a recruit
could ever turn it down.

Perhaps that is why it is accept
able to show emotions at a game
because in the end, it doesn't truly
matter. Your marriage matters. Your
children matter. Your job and your de
gree and your life choices matter. Un
less you are a professional athlete,
sports aren't that important. So while
fans and players can take the oppor
tunity to smile and to care, both
should try to keep things in perspec
tive.

Part of what made Stanford so at
tractive to me was the chance to enjoy
a top-tier athletics program, but I
would never have considered the uni
versity if it hadn't been one of the
crown jewels of higher education
not just in the United States but in the
entire world. I think both athletes and
fans would agree on that point. Nev
ertheless, while sports at Stanford are
not the "real Stanford," they are part
of what makes the real Stanford liv
able. As you begin your college ca
reers, I strongly urge you to keep that
in mind.

Winston Shi is hoping he is one of
the few in his grade to carve out a
successful NFL career. To tell him
