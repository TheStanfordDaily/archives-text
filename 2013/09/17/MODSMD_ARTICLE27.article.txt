# Remembering my first Cardinal hero
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM 
Last week, a member of
Stanford's 1952 Rose Bowl
team passed away. In addi
tion to being a three-year
letterman from 1950-52 in
football, he competed in the 400-meter
hurdles for track and field and was a
member of Zeta Psi fraternity. Basi
cally, William Storum '53 was your
typical jock-frat-wonder boy dining
his time at Stanford.

Bill was also my grandfather. He
taught me how to Fear the Tree the
moment I entered high school. He was
an Indian and then bled Cardinal until
the very end. I was already on campus
when I got the call from my mom. I
had known that my goodbye to him
before I left might have been my last,
and, as usual, he had been wearing a
Stanford shirt as we talked about the
upcoming football season. When my
mom called, she made sure to tell me
that he had wanted me to know that he
was proud of me for carrying on the
Stanford tradition and that he had
been reppin' the Card on his final day
The evident alumni spirit and his
love of Stanford is what prompted me
to write this column. Seeing all of the
recent graduates and alumni at the
first home football game made it espe
cially clear that Stanford loyalty runs
deep, whether in supporting athletics,
mentoring current students or helping
recent graduates network.

While academics have raised it to
the level of the Ivies, it's athletics that
have propelled Stanford into another

level of its own. The superb athletes
and their staunch loyalty to the Card
throughout their entire careers are
part of the glue that holds this amaz
ing university together.
Despite coming from a younger
school, Stanford graduates have cer
tainly established themselves in the
nation, and the older alums hold the
memories and traditions of their- era
near and dear to their hearts.
The stories that Bill shared with
me will forever be ingrained in my
memory and I will share them with
my own kids when it comes time for
me to inculcate them with Stanford
pride. I've been a huge college football
fan since I went to my first game when
I was 8 (it pains me to admit that it was
a USC game at the Coliseum), so I
loved hearing about his time on the
football team at Stanford.
One story in particular emphasizes
how much has changed in 50 years.
Whenever Big Game was played at
Cal, all of the Zetas on the team (which
was the football frat at the time) would
stay together with the rest of their
brothers in the same hotel no sepa
ration was imposed between players
and students. Bill and the guys would
play football in the hotel hallway to get
pumped, with each room having a dif
ferent point value if someone managed
to break into it.
Then when the Big Game was
played at Stanford, there was the huge
bonfire at Lake Lagunita, where the
whole student body would gather with

the band to join forces against the
Golden Bears. During football season,
he emphasized that the entire energy
of the school was focused on beating
the opponent for that weekend and
dressing up like Indians to intimidate
them. Oh, and singing the infamous
Stanford drinking song "For it's
wine, wine, wine that's makes you feel
so fine on the Farm!" of course.

While we don't dress up like Indi
ans today (although the band does still
have a few original numbers that in
volve the Dollies dancing like Indians),
that same school spirit still permeates
the campus year round despite the ex
cessive workload that most students
impose on themselves.

The alumni have taken that same
spirit with them all over the country
and into the lives of their families, just
as Bill did with me. My grandfather in
stilled in me a love for my school and a
love for life that I will take with me for
ever and hopefully pass on to another
generation of Trees.
As I walked up to his gravesite to
say my final goodbye, I put down a
cardinal rose and gave him my prom
ise to do him proud at his alma mater.
And before I left, I know he was with
me when I told him, "GO CARD!"
