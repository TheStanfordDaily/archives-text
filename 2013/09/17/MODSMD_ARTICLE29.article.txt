# ARTS & LIFE
## THE 						DAILY FALL COURSE GUIDE 
### Daily Arts Life Staff 
We asked Daily staffers about
the best classes they've ever taken
during fall quarter, and this is the
list of goodies some well known,
some obscure that we came up
with. Some of them are intro classes
whose lessons have given us a lot of
mileage in our studies, others are
cleverly designed IntroSems and
still others are upper-level seminars
but very approachable for fresh
men.

AMSTUD 132/ARTHIST 132:
American Art and Culture, 1528 to
1850
Tue., Thu. 9:00 -10:30 a.m., 4 units,
Bryan Wolf
GERs: DB-Hum, EC-AmerCul,
WAY-AII
What makes Bryan Wolfs class
on early American art and thought
great is not so much the mastery of
the artists or writers themselves
(colonial portraiture is certainly
nothing to write home about), but
the deft way in which Wolf weaves
cultural themes together through
these distinct objets d'art. On top of
exposing you to a diverse range of
artistic styles from America's early
years, this course will enable you to
go into an art museum and bust out
facts about some of our nation's
finest painters: John Singleton Cop
ley's breakthrough painting was of a
mischievous squirrel, Charles Will
son Peale built the first natural his
tory museum in the country and
members of the Hudson River
School would paint them landscapes
of the Catskills mountains months
after they left the wilderness. Wolf
knows his art, and his enthusiasm
for the subject radiates beyond the
confines of his PowerPoint presenta
tions.

ARCHLGY 1: Introduction to
Prehistoric Archaeology
Mon., Wed., Fri. 9:00 - 9:50 a.m., 3-
5 units, John Rick
GERs: DB-SocSci, EC-Global-
Com, WAY-AII, WAY-SI
If you were ever fascinated by
mummies or pretended to be a
hunter-gatherer in your backyard,
this is the class for you! Indulge
your inner archaeologist and learn
the basics of the field in this intro
class taught by Professor John Rick,
who walks you through the develop
ment of prehistoric human society
and the methods used to discover
the past. Rick is an engaging lectur
er, but the best part of this class is
actually the assignments, which give
you the chance to make sense of re

al(ish) archaeological data. Sections
are also exciting, with a hands-on
lab component (you even get to cre
ate your own stone tool!). This class
will convince a few of you to delve
deeper into the tiny but wonderful
archaeology department and, for
the rest, allow you to play Indiana
Jones for a quarter.

ATHLETIC 2: Abs and Glutes
Mon., Wed. 11:00 - 11:50 a.m., 1
unit, Nancy Conniff
Keep the freshman 15 away with
awesome instructor Nancy Conniff,
whose enthusiasm is contagious
she's the female version of Richard
Simmons, minus the rhinestone leo
tards. She gradually introduces
more difficult moves and exercises
throughout the quarter but never
pushes her students beyond their
comfort zones. And if you manage to
stick with the course through
midterms and up till Finals Week,
you'll get at least a four pack,
though you might need some help
explaining away Abs and Glutes on
your transcript in a job interview.

ATHLETIC 164: Volleyball: Inter
mediate Sand

Mon., Wed. 1:15 - 2:05 p.m., 1 unit,
Don Shaw

Take advantage of those new
sand volleyball courts behind Stern
Hall with some classes with Coach
Shaw, who led the Stanford women's
volleyball team to four NCAA titles
between 1984 andl999. Coach com
bines a short lesson at the beginning
of class with a lot of playing time

skill level in the Intermediate class
includes beach regulars, converted
indoor players and even newcomers
whose only volleyball experience is
peppering at a barbecue. Those
afraid of the cold should wait until
spring to take this class —by the
time November rolls around, it's go
ing to be pretty chilly out there.

BIO15N: Environmental Literacy
Tue., Thu. 2:15 - 3:30 p.m., 3 units,
Terry Root
GERs: DB-NatSci, WAY-SMA
You may find Terry Root's face
familiar on your first day: Her por
trait is on the wall at CoHo. Her In
troSem, an introduction to climate
change science with an emphasis on
policy literacy, revolves around stu
dent questions prepared for a couple
short readings. One of the greatest
perks of this class is learning about
climate change negotiations from an
inside source: Root shared the 2007
Nobel Peace Prize for her work with
A1 Gore and the International Panel
on Climate Change.

810 34N: Hunger
Tue., Thu. 4:15 - 5:30 p.m., 3 units,
Kathryn Barton
GER: DB-NatSci
If you're looking for an interest
ing class that won't take up a lot of
your time and is also an easy A+
(yes, A+), take this IntroSem.
Rather than focusing on biology, the
course has a historical focus on the
topic of hunger, including causes and
consequences of past major famines.
At times, Professor Kathryn Barton
tried to introduce some of the in
depth science behind food biotech
nology, but most of the students
the non-pre-med ones had none
of it and instead drove the seminar
discussion towards the societal im-

pacts of hunger, which was a relief.
That being said, Professor Barton is
so knowledgeable about the subject
and always eager to talk with stu
dents about their academic inter
ests. The weekly readings are light,
and the only major task you have for
the entire quarter is to give a 10-
minute presentation on a crop as
signed by the instructor.

BIOE 44: Fundamentals for Engi
neering Biology Lab
Tue., Thu. 11:00 - 11:50 a.m., 4
units, Joseph Shih and Andrew
Endy
GERs: WAY-SMA

This class will rock your world if
you're interested in biology, biotech
nology, chemical engineering or just

crazy cool applications of life science
technology. BIOE 44 is the introduc
tory lab class for the bioengineering
major, but it is open and very acces
sible to non-majors. I like to think of
this class as genetic engineering
101. In 10 weeks, you will learn all
the tools needed to create and test
your own genetically encoded device
as part of a useful biological product.
For example, a successful project
last year included the development
of a mercury ion detoxification sys
tem in E. coli. Professors Endy and
Shih work hard to bring all students
up to speed in biotechnology princi
ples and skills needed to develop
unique and exciting genetic engi

neering projects,

CS 106A/ENGR 70A: Program
ming Methodology
Mon., Wed., Fri. 3:15 - 4:05 p.m., 5
units, Mehran Sahami
GERs: DB-EngrAppSci, WAY-FR
CS 106A, the most übiquitous
Stanford course, is a great way to
decide whether computer science
is for you. The energetic Mehran
Sahami, one of Google's first engi
neers, teaches the course every
fall and is filled with infectious en
ergy for the subject and teaching
in general. The course gives you
great insight into basic coding, and
you walk away with a much better
understanding of how computer
programs actually work: Lessons
include simple introductions to ar
rays, and strings and basic com
puter commands are covered. If
you find the assignments and ex
ams easy, you'll probably be a good
fit for computer science, but if you
find the material to be challenging,
be warned —CS 106A is child's
play for computer science stu
dents.

INTNLREL 1/POLISCI1: Intro
duction to International Rela
tions
Mon., Tue., Wed. 11:00 - 11:50
a.m., 5 units, Michael Tomz
GERs: DB-SocSci, WAY-AQR,
WAY-SI
You can't find another class that
covers as much material in as or
ganized and digestible away. This
class explores a broad range of in
ternational relations problems in
four short sections: war, trade, the
environment and humanitarian
aid. It's also an overview of gener
al social science thinking for non
majors curious about political sci
ence. Professor Mike Tomz, a win
ner of the Karl Deutsch Award for
the most significant contribution
to the field of international rela
tions within 10 years of earning a

Ph.D., was also a high school poli
cy debate champion —he never
says "um" and uncannily finishes
lecture at 11:49.

ME 101: Visual Thinking
Mon., Wed. 1:15 - 3:05 p.m., 4
units, David Northway
GERs: DB-EngrAppSci
If you want a quick and dirty in
tra to design and building stuff,
this is the class for you. It meets
twice a week for two-hour stretch
es, with coursework consisting of
building three design projects over
the course of the quarter. There's
no escaping the elephant in the
room, which is that the second
project will take over your life,
probably forcing you to break up
with your girlfriend and abandon
sleep for a few weeks. The plus
side is that the class is really inter
esting and has no exams at all, on
ly the three projects and their as
sociated design logbooks. It's a lit
tle tough for freshman to get in, but
hey, you never know unless you try.

SOC 155/FEMGEN 155: The
Changing American Family
Tue., Thu. 11:00 - 11:50 a.m., 5
units, Michael Rosenfeld
GERs: DB-SocSci, EC-AmerCul,
WAY-ED, WAY-SI
It's no secret that family life
provides much of the fodder for
film and fiction, from television sit
coms to indie dramas. Michael
Rosenfeld's course tracks the
trends in American family demo
graphics throughout the nation's
history, touching on changes in
patterns of marriage, cohabitation,
childrearing and divorce. Unlike
other sociology classes that fea
ture dense texts weighed down by
demographic facts and figures,
Rosenfeld's literature of choice

including a book of his own —is
replete with anecdotal asides, the
historical background behind
many of those changes and person
al accounts of representative
and unique American families.
And two 50-minute lectures a week
for a 5-unit class is not too shabby,
either.
