# STUDENT LIFE
## Thirty-three transfers join Farm family Admits include students from two and four-year programs, military veterans 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When David Hoyt 'l3 was 15 years old, he
dropped out of high school.

In the following months, he took on a series of
service-sector jobs in his New Jersey small town. He
worked as a swim instructor, a lifeguard, a gardener
"things that didn't really require any degree,"
Hoyt said.

At the time, Hoyt thought his academic career
was fully behind him.

"I didn't consider going to a four-year university,"
he said. "I didn't consider not going either. It was
just sort of out of my mind at that point."
But then, Hoyt experienced a change in perspec
tive.

While working as a swim instructor, he became
involved in a service program that taught children
with mental, physical and emotional handicaps how
to swim. Watching his students overcome the chal
lenges in their lives, whether it was autism spectrum
disorder or missing limbs, convinced Hoyt that he
could do the same.

"All of them were successful, mostly due to their
determination," Hoyt said. "It sort of hit me and
went through my mind day after day: 'ln my life,
what was so hard that I can't get back on the prover
bial train and try to figure out what I had done
wrong in the past?'

"So my students inspired me to go back to
school."

Hoyt took the high school equivalency GED test,
enrolled at a local New Jersey community college,
audited courses at the nearby Rutgers University,
participated in a Chinese language immersion course
at Middlebury College and decided that he would try
his hardest to transfer into a four-year university.
And three years later, just days before his gradu
ation from junior college, Hoyt received the verdict:
He had gained admission into his top-choice univer
sity, Stanford, and would begin courses in the fall of
2010.

'At first, I just thought that it was the most polite
rejection letter that I had ever received," Hoyt said
about receiving an emailed acceptance letter, which
he initially sent straight to his spam box. "But when
I figured out exactly what had happened, my heart
froze, and I started yelling and screaming and rejoic
ing."

He graduated from Stanford last spring with a
degree in international relations and completed the
Center for International Security and Cooperation
honors program.

For students like Hoyt, who have either unusual
life circumstances or compelling academic needs not
met by their current institution, the university's
transfer admission process can provide an alterna
tive route to becoming a Stanford undergraduate be
sides entering as a freshman right out of high school.

Reasons to Transfer
Each student has his or her own reason for choos
ing to transfer to Stanford.
Take Derrick Staten 'l3.

As a high school senior, Staten didn't even consid
er applying to any universities outside of the Mid
west where he grew up. While he was having a pleas
ant experience at the school that he ultimately en
rolled at, Loyola University Chicago, its academic of
ferings were slim in the field he truly wished to
study, Russian affairs.
Staten said he applied to trans
fer into Stanford after learning
about the academic resources spe
cific to Russian affairs that would be
available to him: the Stanford U.S.-
Russia Forum, the Hoover Archives
and the Center for Russian, East
European and Eurasian Studies.
Or consider Sage Cammers-
Goodwin 'l6, who begins her first
quarter at Stanford this fall.
After her junior year in high
school, Cammers-Goodwin felt pre
pared to embark on her college ca
reer but knew most four-year uni
versities advise applicants not to cut
short their high school years. Bard
College at Simon's Rock, however, is
specifically designed to cater to
ward students who want an early
start on college.
The college offered Cammers-
Goodwin admission and a generous
financial aid package, which ended
up proving irresistible. She enrolled
at Bard College at Simon's Rock
that fall but always hoped to trans
fer into a school like Stanford.
"Transfer rates to universities
are kind of scary" Cammers-Good
win said. "I knew in the long run
that my chances at getting into a re
ally great university might in some
ways be lessened by going to Bard
College at Simon's Rock, but I de
cided that it was really worth it be
cause I wanted to go to college ear
ly."

Their paths to Stanford may be
different, but transfer students do
share one quality in common: They
have all surmounted improbable
odds to arrive at the Farm. Accept
ance rates at Stanford for transfer
students are notoriously lower than
those for first-time students.

Trends in transfer acceptance
This year, Stanford offered ad
mission to 33 transfers students
from a pool of 1,663 applicants,
which netted a transfer acceptance
rate of around 1.98 percent, accord
ing to Richard Shaw, dean of Under
graduate Admission.
For a point of comparison: Dur
ing the same admissions cycle, Stan
ford admitted 5.69 percent of its
freshman applicants.
The gap between acceptance
rates for transfer and for first-time
applicants, respectively, has persist
ed for at least the past five admis
sion cycles: 1.92 percent and 7.97
percent in 2009, 1.99 percent and
7.31 percent in 2010,4.1 percent and
7.1 percent in 2011 and 2.25 percent
and 6.61 percent in 2012.
According to Shaw, the Office of
Undergraduate Admission sets a
target annually for the number of
transfer acceptances, which is based
on the total enrollment of under
graduates at the university as well
as the availability of on-campus res
idential spaces.
In recent years, two major fac
tors have contributed to the low
number of transfer students admit
ted.

First, very few Stanford under
grads who enter as freshmen ever
choose to drop out. High freshman
to-sophomore year retention rates,
which have historically hovered at
around 98 percent, mean few slots
ever open up for transfer students
to fill.

And secondly, in the last few ad
mission cycles, the University has
experienced higher-than-anticipat
ed yield rates for prospective fresh
men.

Most notably, the Office of Un
dergraduate Admission choose to
cut the size of its transfer class in
half from 58 admits in 2011 to 34
admits in 2012 â€”because its fresh
man matriculation rate had in
creased nearly three percent be
tween those two years.
Sally Mentzer, who works at Un
dergraduate Advising and Research
as the transfer advising coordinator,

said that, despite being small in
number, transfer students play an
important role in the Stanford com
munity.
"They have a lot of life experi
ence, which they can share with
their class," Mentzer said about
transfer students. "Also, it takes a
lot of courage to transfer from one
institution to another. I think in gen
eral, they tend to be really apprecia
tive of Stanford."

She admitted, however, that she
would like to see more transfer stu
dents on campus.

The admissions process
Stanford's transfer admission
cycle unofficially begins in April of
the preceding year.

Mentzer said she and several
cm-rent transfer students meet with
the admission staff to discuss what
the university would like to see in
that cycle's transfer student cohort.
For the past several admission
cycles, Stanford's priorities for each
transfer class have tended to re
volve around four major categories:
two-year community college stu
dents, four-year university students
who have specific reasons to trans
fer into Stanford, nontraditional
students and, increasingly, U.S. vet
erans.

In past years, the University has
only extended offers to one or two
veterans to join Stanford's transfer
class. This year, however, six veter
ans received offers of transfer ad
mission.
"I think part of that is due to an
outreach by some of our former vet
eran transfer students who let cur
rent veterans know that Stanford is
a really good place to come to,"
Mentzer said.

Applications for transfer stu
dents close in March, and Stanford
extends its admission offers in May.
Accepted students have until June 1
to submit intent to register.
For some students like Staten,
choosing to enroll at Stanford is "a
no-brainer."

On the strength of its Russian
related programs, Staten said he
only applied to transfer to Stanford
and thought he would graduate
from Loyola University Chicago
otherwise.
"I looked at a number of other
universities," Staten said. "But I
thought: 'Why make the huge effort
to transfer unless I'm getting into a
substantially better situation?'"
Cammers-Goodwin, however,
carefully deliberated her options be
fore making a decision about to
which university she would attend.

It came down to Stanford and
Yale, Cammers-Goodwin said.
While Stanford had always been
her top pick, Cammers-Goodwin
said she was temporarily swayed by
Yale's decision to include a personal
ized, hand-written note and school
flag in her admission package.
"Yale's [admission package] was
very good at kind of making you feel
a part of the culture at the school,"
Cammers-Goodwin said. 'At Stan
ford, it seemed more like it was wel
coming you into the university, and
kind of, once you confirm your deci
sion, you would become more a part
of the community."
Cammers-Goodwin ended up
sharing these feelings with Mentzer,
which led her to chose Stanford.
Mentzer said this perception does
not reflect the truth and is some
thing that the university will be ac
tively working to correct for the
next admission cycle.
"I thought was pretty funny,"
Menzter said. "I know the admis
sion officers and how excited they
get about transfer students once
they've chosen them."

Easing the transition to the Farm

Stanford administrators' excite
ment about transfer students con
tinues as they prepare for the ad
mitted to arrive on campus,
Mentzer said.

After conducting an initial evalu
ation, the Registrar's Office staff
works with students at determining
which courses from previous institu

tions that Stanford will accept for
credit towards graduation. This is
often an ad hoc process, and stu
dents are able to present course syl
labi and negotiate with the staff if
there are questions, Mentzer said.

The transfer credit evaluation
process can be a burden, according
to graduated transfer students, but
the staff tends to be flexible and em
phasizes putting transfer students
on the best footing possible in order
to graduate on time.
"It's a bit of work, but Stanford
is not the only school that does it,"
Hoyt said.
In August, administrators or
ganize a Transfer Visit Day, which is
analogous to Admit Weekend for
prospective freshmen. The one-day
event includes an informal patio din
ner the preceding night, a campus
tour and a series of academic ses
sions.
Transfer students then arrive
one week before classes commence
in September in order to attend
New Student Orientation, which in
cludes events geared specifically to
wards them.

In their first year, most transfer
students are housed at Kimball
House, the arts-themed dorm in
East Campus. Transfer students
older than 25 or with families, how
ever, may choose to live in graduate
housing, such as in Escondido Vil

lage (EV).
Regardless of where they are
housed, transfer students all receive
card-key access to Kimball, where
transfer community-bonding events
are held.

According to Rodger Whitney,
executive director of Residential &
Dining Enterprises Student Hous
ing, Kimball was chosen as the site
for most transfer students so they
could be with other undergraduates
and also close to the rest of transfer
students who stay at EV
The dorm's reputation as one of
the more conducive for studying
likely also played a role, according
to Mentzer. She said in previous
years, when transfer students were
larger in number, they were housed
at different dormitories across cam
pus.

"We did have some complaints
from some of the junior students
who were housed in dorms with
freshmen," Mentzer said. "It wasn't
very quiet, and they were kind of
beyond that.
"I think Kimball is a good bond
ing kind of place, and it's also a little
quieter than some of the other
places," she added.
Menzter also works on matching
each transfer student with an aca
demic adviser, carefully pouring
over admission essays and supple
mental forms to find a member of

the Stanford faculty who is a best fit
for the student based on academic
interests and personal needs.
During this process, Menzter
said she is particularly aware of stu
dents who are transferring from
community college.
"I think that for junior and com
munity college students, there may
be more of a fear [about] if they can
make it than other students admit
ted right out of high school,"
Mentzer said.

"I try to choose their advisers
very carefully," she said. "I also look
at their academic performance each
quarter, and then, reach out to them
if some challenges do develop."

Forging a new academic path
Hoyt admitted the jump from
community college classes to Stan
ford courses was initially jarring.
He said the biggest differences be
tween the two came in the volume of
work and the heightened expecta
tions of quality.
The latter was true especially
when it came to writing assign
ments, Hoyt said.
"At Stanford, I wrote a couple of
papers, and TAs just lanced my ar
gument," Hoyt said. "I was forced
really quickly to almost relearn how
to write. And I'm really glad that I
did because it made the rest of my
Stanford career easier."

But perhaps, the most difficult
challenge for transfer students
doesn't come from the courses
themselves, but planning out their
courses, so they can graduate on
time. This is a particularly
pressing concern because Stan
ford's financial aid policy is only au
tomatic for undergraduates who
have attended college for 12 or few
er quarters. If transfer students
need more time to complete their
degree, they may fear losing this
source of funding.

But Director of Financial Aid
Karen Cooper said that there is
some leeway for students.
According to Cooper, students
needing to stay at Stanford for an
extended period of time can submit
an academic plan, outlining their in
tended course schedule signed off
by their academic adviser, to the Of
fice of Financial Aid.

As long as the students are not
pursuing a minor, a co-term or a sec
ond major, they may receive aid past
the 12th quarter to complete their
degree.

"They might start to see some
loans being added to then- financial
aid package, and the amount of
scholarships that they are being of
fered might be reduced as time goes
by," Cooper said.
But even if they do receive addi
tional aid, there is still the fact that
transfer students will have less time
to explore Stanford than the rest of
their peers.
"They make a point to tell us
when we came for our transfer stu
dent orientation: Stanford students
hit the ground running," Hoyt said.
"And transfer students have to
sprint the entire time."
For instance, in order to make
sure he would have time to study
abroad, Hoyt said he submitted an
application for the Bing Overseas
Study Program during his fourth
week at Stanford.

Despite their reduced time at the
Farm, all transfer students inter
viewed said they were grateful for
their Stanford experience and
wouldn't exchange it for anything.
"I realize that, had I been there
for four years, I could've had a bit
more time to figure out what I want
ed to major in," Staten said. "But
there's nothing that I regret as far
as how I played out.
"We are made to feel a part of
the Stanford community, a strong
part of it. And I'd say, along with
most of transfers I know, we are su
per excited to have the opportunity
and are very humbled."
