# STUDENT LIFE
## Thirty-three transfers join Farm family Admits include students from two and four-year programs, military veterans

When David Hoyt 'l3 was 15 years old, he
dropped out of high school.

In the following months, he took on a series of
service-sector jobs in his New Jersey small town. He
worked as a swim instructor, a lifeguard, a gardener
"things that didn't really require any degree,"
Hoyt said.

At the time, Hoyt thought his academic career
was fully behind him.

"I didn't consider going to a four-year university,"
he said. "I didn't consider not going either. It was
just sort of out of my mind at that point."
But then, Hoyt experienced a change in perspec
tive.

While working as a swim instructor, he became
involved in a service program that taught children
with mental, physical and emotional handicaps how
to swim. Watching his students overcome the chal
lenges in their lives, whether it was autism spectrum
disorder or missing limbs, convinced Hoyt that he
could do the same.

"All of them were successful, mostly due to their
determination," Hoyt said. "It sort of hit me and
went through my mind day after day: 'ln my life,
what was so hard that I can't get back on the prover
bial train and try to figure out what I had done
wrong in the past?'

"So my students inspired me to go back to
school."

Hoyt took the high school equivalency GED test,
enrolled at a local New Jersey community college,
audited courses at the nearby Rutgers University,
participated in a Chinese language immersion course
at Middlebury College and decided that he would try
his hardest to transfer into a four-year university.
And three years later, just days before his gradu
ation from junior college, Hoyt received the verdict:
He had gained admission into his top-choice univer
sity, Stanford, and would begin courses in the fall of
2010.

'At first, I just thought that it was the most polite
rejection letter that I had ever received," Hoyt said
about receiving an emailed acceptance letter, which
he initially sent straight to his spam box. "But when
I figured out exactly what had happened, my heart
froze, and I started yelling and screaming and rejoic
ing."

He graduated from Stanford last spring with a
degree in international relations and completed the
Center for International Security and Cooperation
honors program.

For students like Hoyt, who have either unusual
life circumstances or compelling academic needs not
met by their current institution, the university's
transfer admission process can provide an alterna
tive route to becoming a Stanford undergraduate be
sides entering as a freshman right out of high school.

Reasons to Transfer
Each student has his or her own reason for choos
ing to transfer to Stanford.
Take Derrick Staten 'l3.

As a high school senior, Staten didn't even consid
er applying to any universities outside of the Mid
west where he grew up. While he was having a pleas
ant experience at the school that he ultimately en
rolled at, Loyola University Chicago, its academic of
ferings were slim in the field he truly wished to
