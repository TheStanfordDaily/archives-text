# TEN THINGS FRESHMEN MUST DO WITH THEIR TIME ON THE FARM
## THE
						BUCKET LIST 
### MOLLY VORWERCK MANAGING EDITOR 
As you get wrapped
up in the hustle and bustle
of your first year on the
Farm, don't forget to take
time out of your hectic
schedule of new friends, exams
and random dance floor
hookups to indulge in some of
Stanford's most cherished
freshman year traditions.
From the conventional to the
wacky, we've compiled a buck
et list of some of the most im
portant events of your freshman
year.

1. Complete the Full Moon on the
Quad tic-tac-toe board. Yes, kiss
ing a bunch of strangers in what
amounts to a gigantic make-out orgy
sounds pretty weird, not to men
tion unhygienic, but it's a hallowed
Stanford tradition. Make the most
out of it.
2. Midnight fountain hop with
your freshman dorm. It will likely
be cold and uncomfortable, but the
dorm bonding is irrevocable. You'll be
come instant friends in a series of
chlorinated, but still disgusting, pools
of water.
3. Hook up in the stacks at Green.
Nothing says young love like
making out between shelves of dusty
books.
4. Roll out to the home football

games in full body paint. You'll
look silly, but all the cool kids do it.
Plus, if you're close enough to the
cameras, you might get featured on
TV

5. Commit dormcest on Ski Trip.
What happens on Ski Trip, stays

on Ski Trip. Unless you get
frostbite, but that's impossible
to contract when
you're snuggling up next to
your neighbor from down the
hall.

6. Wear a chicken costume to
Bay to Breakers. Bay to Break
ers, San Francisco's most
beloved annual marathon, is a
cesspool for ridiculous cos-

tumes, drunkenness and general
debauchery. And there's nothing
more ridiculous than a chicken

costume.
7. Indulge in mango lassi during
Sunday dinner at Flo Mo. Sunday
night Indian food is just as
integral to the Stanford experience
as Big Game. Well, maybe not,
but it's just as delicious.
8. Get dolled up for 680's annual
Exotic Party. Remember to get

your ticket well in advance in White
Plaza. Clothing optional.

9. Hike the Dish during Spring
Quarter. Sprawling wildlife, Silicon

Valley scions getting in their daily run
and sunsets to die for. What's not to
love?
10. Take an exercise class at the Ar
rillaga gym. Ward off the fresh
man 15 with a bi-weekly athletics
class. From Abs and Glutes to Zumba,
you'll be able to maintain your
summer bikini bod year-round.
