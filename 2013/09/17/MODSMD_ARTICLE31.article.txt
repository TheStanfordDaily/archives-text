# Roxy Sass: Advice for me Class of 2017
## 
### Daily Arts Life Staff – Roxy 
Dear freshmen,
Welcome to Stanford. Wel
come to four years of endless
homework, awkward hookups,
Keystone Light... and some of
the best times of your life. The
overwhelming majority of you
are away from home for the
first time, free to binge on al
cohol and, gasp, even share a
bathroom with a member of
the opposite gender.
But don't let the
brochure's smiling faces mis
lead you. The freedom may be
nice, but, truth is, freshman
year is rough ... and we're not
just talking about the sex.
Take it from Roxy she's
been through it all. Here are
some lessons she learned the
(ahem) hard way:
1. Be kind to your staff.
They will spend more time
holding your head out of the
toilet than you will remember
... after all, your head was in
the toilet.

2. Take a tip from Mackle
more and rock the thrift store
chic: Invest in a rally box full
of crazy costumes from Savers
to whip out for themed par
ties, Band Runs, Bay to
Breakers ... or really any
Stanford event at all.

3. If you're doing the walk
of shame (or triumph, as Roxy
likes to think), head to Stern
for brunch. You can blend in
among all the other frosh
who've been up all night, ei
ther coding or engaged in
more ... rewarding ... late
night pursuits.
4. Speaking of hangovers,
the strongest cups of coffee on

campus can be found, in order,
at Coupa Cafe, Starbucks and
the CoHo. God bless the meal
plan dollar-accepting Olives,
but drinking their coffee is like
licking an ashtray.
5. Make friends with your
PHE. They have condoms.
Because, although Roxy sup
ports most sexual activity, she
draws the line at the unpro
tected kind.
6. Your PHE doesn't have
an endless supply. Hit up the
Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center (SHPRC) for 30(!) free
condoms a quarter.
7. You've probably attend
ed a bunch of presentations
about relationships at Stan
ford— but they lied to you.
People don't date here. Going
to Arrillaga together doesn't
count.

8. That cute guy down the
hall may seem like a good idea
right now, but you will regret
it when you are forced to
spend four hours next to him
on a bus driving up to Tahoe.
Engage in dormcest at your
own risk.
9. Don't be the idiot who
gets a tattoo of their dorm
name at scavenger hunt. That
shit is forever.
10. Don't, under any cir
cumstances, pull the fire
alarm.
This week, a lot of people
will be giving you advice about
what (and who) to do. Roxy
can't make your mistakes for
you, but she knows which ones
she would gladly make again.
Enjoy your freedom,
freshmen. Go forth and multi
ply-
