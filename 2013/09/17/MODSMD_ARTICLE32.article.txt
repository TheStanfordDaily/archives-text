# EGIT LIBATIONS
## CLASSY MIXES TO REPLACE DRINKING OUT OF A HANDLE 
### RENJIE WONG DESK EDITOR 
As the campus-wide NSO
dry policy is lifted, we give you
the lowdown on the tastiest ver
sions of the generally question
able drinks served at campus
parties.
For 120 years now, we at The
Daily have been asked literally
every kind of question a wide-eyed
freshman could possibly ask. From
the academic ("Which course has
the best effort-to-grade ratio?") to
the awkward ("How do I tell my
roommate I'm deathly allergic to
his cherry-scented lube?") there
is little ground in the Universe of
the Great Unknown that we have
not helped students conquer.
The most common question
through the ages, though, seems to
be a particularly universal and
perennially surfacing concern:
Which parties are the best parties?

Now, we're not going to beat
around the bush. There are no two
ways about it the answer is sim
ple, straightforward and im
mutable. The best parties are those
that serve really, really great
drinks.

See, there really only is that
much awkward twerking you can
bear to watch with your Natty
Light beer goggles. As much as our
unwavering editorial standards
steer clear of overused hashtags, we
really do appreciate a party that
knows how to #keepitclassy â€”if
you're going to turn your house into
one giant steaming vat of writhing
bodies, the very least you could do
is to make sure that the vodka being
served to guests isn't a $1.99 handle
you bought off the Walmart clear
ance rack.

So, henceforth, no more Jungle
Juice of dubious origin: We spill the
beans on the tastiest tipples in
town, sharing our top picks for
classy alternatives to six of the most
common party drinks. Whether you
are a seasoned hedonist trying to
spruce up your tired parties (look
ing at you, frat boys) or a guileless
freshman going to your first-ever
bacchanalian bash, this guide will
help you get crunk without the
junk.

VODKA
While vodkas don't generally
have a distinct flavour of their own
unless, of course, you count "tip
sy" as one they certainly can
leave a foul bitterness on the
tongue. Avoid this with the holy tri
umvirate of Ketel One ($23.99,
750m1), Belvedere ($29.99, 750m1)
and Grey Goose ($29.98, 750m1), all
of which are specifically filtered to
remove the chemical compounds re
sponsible for the lingering taste of
shame and regret.

TEQUILA
What is a party without tequila
shots? A civilized party, that's what.
But if you absolutely must slam it
back, we'd rather you go with one
made with 100 percent agave juice
to prevent that nasty hangover. You
won't need a spoonful of sugar to
help the Jose Cuervo Traditional
Reposado ($24.98, 750m1) go down:
Aged in oak barrels for up to three
years, the rich, rounded chocolate
and fig flavours will do anything but
make you balk.
RUM
It is an unfortunate reality that
rums are usually buried under mix
ers (see: Cuba Libre). For a much

tastier option, dark rums aged in
oak barrels preserve the sweetness
of sugarcane juice, from which rums
are distilled. The complex candy
and honey flavours of Ron Zacapa
Centenario 23 ($45.99, 750m1) are
sensuous enough to slowly sip on
the rocks, just as the Guatemalans
themselves do and smooth
enough to knock back. And, because
we know you are wondering: No,
Malibu Rum is not a valid option
here.
GIN
Few can deny the sublime delight of
a frosty gin and tonic, but we would
sooner turn to a vodka and tonic
than have to drink one made with a
harsh, overpowering gin. By far our
favourite brand of juniper juice is
Scottish label Hendrick's ($34.99,
750m1), whose delicate Bulgarian
rose and cucumber notes make for a
wonderfully floral and extreme
ly drinkable G&T. Bonus point:
makes one hell of a martini too.

BEER
The first time I tasted beer at a frat
party, I thought I had accidentally
drunk from the cup of water used to
cleanse the grimy beer pong ball.
For something less like water and
more like a malt brew, the intensely

flavourful Abbey Leffe Blonde
($8.69, 6-pack) is a delicious Belgian
explosion of sweet, bready good
ness, while managing to remain re
freshingly light with fruity over
tones.
EANAB
Ah, the trusty Equally Attractive
Non-Alcoholic Beverage provid
ing both sensible teetotallers and
long-gone guzzlers nightlong suste
nance. If you're not quite feeling the
fluorescent "orange juice," the deli
cate taste of Bundaberg Root Beer
($6.99,4-pack) is a subtly citrusy al
ternative, brewed using time-hon
oured Australian methods with sar
saparilla root, liquorice, molasses
and vanilla bean.
