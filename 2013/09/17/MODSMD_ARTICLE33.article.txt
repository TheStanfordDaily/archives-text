# SPOTLIGHT: Ricker Dining
## 
### Ella Aitchison 
Stanford offers a wide variety
of dining options for hungry stu
dents, the most prominent being
dining halls. To get your grub go
ing, we profile our favorite cam
pus cafeteria.

What's in a dining hall?
That which we call a meal
plan. By any other name
would taste as free. —not
William Shakespeare
On-campus food options may
seem like a confounding
labyrinth, but incoming students
invested in making the most of
their inevitable freshman 15
would do well to make a beeline
for Ricker Dining.
Led by the inimitable general
manager Mary Duch, Ricker con
fects remarkably rich and varied
Mediterranean-focused menus on
a daily basis. Friday and Satur
day nights get plenty of love on

other college campuses, but Stan
ford students have a special place
in their hearts for Thursdays,
when Ricker wheels out its fa
mous Death by Chocolate, which
tastes exactly as it sounds. You
may turn your nose up at most
dining hall food, but there truly
are few things better than Ricker
dessert to comfort you after a
rough midterm.
And as if that wasn't impres
sive enough, the entire facility is
nut free, too the first of its
kind in the nation which draws
a cohort of nut-sensitive students
out to Governor's Corner each
year.

Housed in an airy, sky-lit two
story cottage, Ricker's cavernous
dining space makes it more than
just a place to nurse your hang
over over a plate of tater tots.
Upper story seating allows for a
more intimate spread, with the
added bonus of being able to per
suade your more athletically am

bitious friends to climb the stairs
and bring back soft-serve for
both of you. A corral by the tele
vision reins in the enthusiastic
sports fans, too, so there's no
need to worry about the yelling
and jingling of keys. Round ta
bles and an open interior make
room for study, casual events or
just your average dinner with the
dormmates.

It's easy to get caught up in
routine during the year and to
slog through yet another Lag
lunch or Wilbur dinner, but Rick
er truly takes the cake as The
Daily's pick for the Best Dining
Hall. No more battling whether
to eat, or not to eat.
