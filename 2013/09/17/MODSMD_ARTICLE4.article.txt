# ACADEMICS
## Arts, history of science find home with ITALIC, SIMILE 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
As the class of 2017 arrived at Stanford
on Tuesday, 88 of its members moved into
Burbank house in Stern Hall to take part
in two new integrated learning environ
ments for the upcoming academic year:
ITALIC and SIMILE.

The newly established programs cen
ter on a yearlong, residence-based learn
ing experience similar to the existing
Structured Liberal Education program
(SLE) but with an emphasis on different
subjects. Immersion in the Arts: Living in
Culture (ITALIC) will focus on the arts,
while Science in the Making: Integrated
Learning Environment (SIMILE) will

have curriculum based on the history of
science.
Both programs, which were very popu
lar among incoming freshmen, are intend
ed to give students an opportunity to look
at traditional subjects in fresh ways.
"We're pretty excited about them and
excited about the fact that they offer fresh
men an alternative that might be right for
them in terms of fulfilling requirements,"
said Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation Harry Elam.

Arts opportunities embraced through
ITALIC

computer science and engineering
departments, the Farm is also home
to incredible arts facilities.
The Cantor Aits Center has one
of the largest collections of Rodin
sculptures in the world. The Bing
Concert Hall, home to the Stanford
Beethoven Project, boasts state-of
the-art technical capabilities and
hosts renowned artists such as Yo-Yo
Ma.

"Not every university has a
world class concert hall and a muse
um that rivals major institutions of
the city," said ITALIC Assistant Di
rector Aaron Shkuda. "It's natural
to integrate arts courses with these
offerings."
ITALIC will help increase stu
dent interaction with these facilities
and potentially improve Stanford's
arts program overall US News &
World Report ranked Stanford as
number one for computer science
graduate program and number two
for undergraduate engineering, but
number 36 for graduate studies in
fine arts.

Throughout their first year, the
44 freshmen in the program will
study, create and analyze various
forms of art, including visual, per
forming, film and design. The pro
gram is divided into three topics that
will be explored throughout the year.
"The university wants to say,
'Hey, this is really important, the
arts matter,"' said ITALIC Faculty
Director Janice Ross M.A. '75 Ph.D.
'9B. "We're at a moment where the
arts and humanities have to be
rethought, and this is one of the
sharpest, boldest rethinkings I've
seen."

In the first quarter, lecturers will
pose the question: Why art?
According to Ross, students will

attempt to understand how art af
fects a human's mind by examining
cognition, neuroscience and what
happens to the brain in the presence
of art.

During winter quarter, students
will confront issues of gravity and
levity. Stand-up comic Tig Notaro is
scheduled to visit students and dis
cuss how to bring about comedy in
serious situations.

Lastly, during spring quarter,
students will investigate the bound
aries of art. Ross described
the theme of the quarter through
the question: "What happens when
art pushes so hard against the
boundary that it becomes not-art?"
Throughout the program, stu
dents will meet with multiple artists
and immerse themselves in a variety
of arts experiences. Among other ac
tivities, ITALIC participants will be
taught the art of turfing, a street
dance that originated in Oakland,
visit the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art and check out the Dis
ney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.
"It's a deeply arts-based experi
ence," Shkuda said.
Although that may be true, pro
gram coordinators encouraged stu
dents of all prospective majors to ap
ply for ITALIC.
"You just have to be willing to im
merse yourself in the arts as away
of grasping knowledge for all disci
plines," Ross said. "We want to give
people this creativity for all that they
do at Stanford, for the next three
years and after."
In addition to fulfilling Thinking
Matters and Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR) requirements,
ITALIC will also fulfill three of the
new Ways of Thinking Ways of Do
ing requirements.
Ross said that in reevaluating
school requirements, the arts were a
recurring, valued subject that lacked
an easily accessible format for stu
dents to explore it. She said the pur
pose of the program is "to create a

new appetite for the arts, because
the humanities have fallen off as be
coming a destination major for stu
dents."
"I think this is the humanities
and the arts reimagined for the new
moment that universities are in,"
Ross said. "It's a prototype for
where the humanities and arts are
going to be."
Science for the humanities
At Stanford, students can often
divide themselves into either hu
manities-only or science-only types,
with the labels fuzzy and techie
used to categorize the two groups.
SIMILE blends the two sides to
gether to give students a chance to
experiment with both.
"It crosses the fuzzy-techie di
vide," said Kristen Haring, the assis
tant director of SIMILE.
Haring said the program is de
signed for students who excel in
math and science to ask historical
questions or for students who are
more interested in the humanities to
learn about the role of science in
their fields.
According to Ross, the goal of the
program is to take students through
the story of how science, technology
and medicine merged.
"This is not a science class," said
SIMILE faculty director Paula
Findlen. "This is a humanistic ap
proach to science, technology and
medicine."
Findlen said the class was not a
substitute for introductory science
classes.
"There are many students who
come to Stanford who are interested
in these subjects that might want to
have a perspective that is comple
mentary to but different from the
perspective in their introductory sci
ence classes," Findlen said.
The SIMILE curriculum is or
ganized chronologically. As students
progress throughout the year, they
will immerse themselves in the his-

Tory of science, technology and med
icine. According to Findlen, the
theme of the first quarter is inven
tion and how these three subjects
emerged. Winter quarter will focus
on revolutions and how these sub
jects changed. During spring quar
ter, students will explore globaliza
tion and how these subjects shape
and connect with each other.
"We're trying to encourage peo
ple to do some hands-on learning,"
Findlen said. "There are at least one
or two opportunities to work with an
ancient instrument, to learn what it
is and learn about the making of
things."
Even with the forward-thinking
mindset of many fields in the sci
ences, Findlen said understanding
the past was crucial for students
learning about science, technology
or medicine.
"I think the tendency of people
who are immersed in technology or
medicine is to think only of the fu
ture," she said. "If you don't know
how that happened, you're missing
understanding something very fun
damental that will offer you a per
spective on the world we live in to
day."
In addition to adding depth to
science and technology studies,
SIMILE fulfills the Thinking Mat
ters requirement, PWR require
ment and three Ways of
Thinking/Ways of Doing require
ments.
According to Findlen, it was not
easy for freshman to get into the
program.
"We certainly had many more
apply than we could accept, which
we took as a very good sign," she
said. "It was certainly competitive
to get in to the program."
Valerie Gamao 'l7, a freshman
from San Antonio, Tex., was one of
the 44 students to make the cut for
SIMILE. She said she is leaning to
wards majoring in environmental
science and public policy.

"I [see] myself thriving in a small
community where I can live and
work and not feel lost in such a huge
crowd at Stanford," Gamao said.

Both SIMILE and ITALIC offer
students the opportunity to expand
their conversations from the class
room to the dining hall, where they
will eat alongside their professors
and peers.

"You're going to have an intensi
ty that comes from working with the
same group of people and being able
to push into questions much more
deeply than you can in a quarter,"
Haring said.

Breaking down the divide
In the shared space of Burbank,
there will be plenty of room for col
laboration. Students will be taking
classes within their dorm building
alongside the same peers they are
living with, an environment that the
faculty members think will expand
the learning experience.
"We'll find ways to really collab
orate with each other within the two
programs and also other programs
such as SLE," Elam said.

In the collaboratorium the
basement area of Burbank stu
dents will be able to create art or
scientific models and work together.
"The people who are interested
in these programs are very hands
on enthusiasts," Haring said. "I
think there's going to be a lot that
happens in that space that is not
planned but really wonderful."
Ultimately, students in both pro
grams were looking for the same
thing an intensive and immersive
way to explore an area of interest.
"[SIMILE and ITALIC] offer
an alternative for some students as
something that is rigorous or fo
cused in an area they're interested
in that will fulfill requirements,"
Elam said.
