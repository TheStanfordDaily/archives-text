As the class of 2017 arrived at Stanford
on Tuesday, 88 of its members moved into
Burbank house in Stern Hall to take part
in two new integrated learning environ
ments for the upcoming academic year:
ITALIC and SIMILE.

The newly established programs cen

ing experience similar to the existing
Structured Liberal Education program
(SLE) but with an emphasis on different
subjects. Immersion in the Arts: Living in
Culture (ITALIC) will focus on the arts,
while Science in the Making: Integrated
Learning Environment (SIMILE) will

have curriculum based on the history of
science.
Both programs, which were very popu

men an alternative that might be right for
them in terms of fulfilling requirements,"
said Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation Harry Elam.
