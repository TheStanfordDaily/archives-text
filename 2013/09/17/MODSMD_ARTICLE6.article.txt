## New Arrillaga fitness center at Roble Field to open Nov. 1 The 						project is slated to finish more than two months ahead of schedule 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
A new 75,000-square foot fitness center
that features a 50-meter swimming pool, a
well-lit rock climbing room and multipurpose
fitness studios will open just west of Roble
Field on Santa Teresa Street on Nov. 1.

The construction of the Arrillaga Outdoor
Education and Recreation Center, which
broke ground in the summer of 2011, was ini
tially scheduled to finish on Jan. 14, 2014, but
will be finished earlier than expected, said
Deputy Athletic Director Ray Purpur.
The $36-million project was mainly funded
by the Arrillaga family and the Avery family,
with the University covering the non-con

struction costs, including the design permit
and the entitlement fee. While the new swim
ming pool accounts for $2 million of the total
expense, the mechanical and electrical sys
tems are the most expensive components of
the new gym, according to Associate Vice
President of Land, Buildings and Real Estate
Jack Cleary.
"The pool was expensive, the air-condi
tioning was expensive, though the single
biggest thing was the rock climbing wall,"
Purpur said.
Compared to the existing rock climbing wall
in the Arrillaga Center for Sports and Recre
ation, the new facility not only boasts an im
proved lighting system and ventilation but is al
so larger, therefore easing the campus-wide
popular demand for rock climbing facilities.
"We just want to make it bigger," Purpur
said. "There is such a huge demand for rock
climbing. We turn people away, and people

stand in line."
While the new gym will closely follow the
existing East Center in its design concept, it
differentiates itself by providing a larger
weight room equipped with lockers and show
ers, as well as multipurpose classroom areas
for club sports program meetings and the ac
ademic portion of outdoor education.
Meanwhile, the new gym will also follow a
system of LEED-based performance guide
lines required by the Santa Clara County as
part of its Green Building Ordinance, stated
Cleary.
Nested amid the west campus residential
areas and just a few steps away from the en
gineering quad, the new gym promises to
bring sporting facilities within easy access of
west campus residents.
"For exercise and campus recreation, you
want a place that is convenient," Purpur said.
"So all of the students and faculties who live

in that general area will have another option
to be able to go and have open recreations."
According to Purpur, the gym will also
serve the new west-campus housing units
that the University plans to add in the coming
years.

Purpur stated that there would be an open
house accompanying the grand opening,
which had to be pushed back from the first
week of classes due to a few obstacles. Al
though the main body of the building is com
plete, the installation of landscaping, interior
finishes and equipment and system commis
sioning are still ongoing.
According to Cleary, construction will be
completed on schedule and the gym will be
open to students once occupancy permits are
granted by the Santa Clara County.
