## The
						Daily's Three Books Reviews The
						Outsourced Self 
### WINSTON SHI STAFF WRITER 
All the labors and fruits of American in
dustry are built upon one central maxim:
People produce more if they specialize. This
belief created great factories and assembly
lines, transformed society and generated
mass movements, destroyed established
powers and raised new ones. Hand in hand
with capitalism, industrialization advanced
civilization's standard of living to levels pre
vious generations could never have imag
ined.

So why is it that so many Americans are
unhappy? The neuroses of American socie
ty have generally reflected a certain insecu
rity about itself a recurrent and perhaps
even constant fear that America is in de
cline, that it cannot provide for its citizens
and that perhaps its way of life isn't rele
vant to its true needs and desires. The Oc
cupy Movement is but one instance of
American angst, although to call it angst
does not do justice to what are admittedly
very deep-seated views.
It seems only fitting that Berkeley, the
standard bearer for American liberalism,
has produced this latest criticism of Ameri
cana. Renowned sociologist Arlie
Hochschild, a professor at UC-Berkeley, ex
plains in "The Outsourced Self" how a per
vasive industrial mentality has eroded the
organic social links of American society, re
placing them with dating coaches, wedding
planners and nursing homes as far as the
eye can see. Just like we need farmers to
grow our food for us, so we need hired
helpers and consultants to guide us through
every moment of our lives.
In short, Hochschild sees the rise of the
service industry as hardly perfect. People
pay other people outsourcing â€”to do
things they don't want to do themselves, but
in Hochschild's view, they don't turn their
leisure time into something worthwhile.
Ironically, with time to spare, Hochschild's
Americans find their lives drained and flat.

The prime cause of this ambivalence is
that, for all its productive powers, special
ization breeds homogeneity. Both
Match.com profiles and societal norms are
trending towards similar, idealized and
overly trained representations of reality
we want to be perfect, and by learning how
to act perfect, we demean perfection itself.
The industry itself remains self-aware,
maintaining that perfection is not general
but in the eye of the beholder; on the other
hand, it claims to sell a universal perfection
to the people it serves.
In all of Hochschild's case studies, she
sees a drive to commercialize services that
nobody really needs; I see a drive to special
ize. She sees this desire as evidence of inse
curity the belief that we aren't capable of
doing things properly. I consider the trend
inevitable, not a symptom of insecurity but
of man's desire to take something they al

ready do well and make it even better. Of
course, regardless of what outsourcing ac
tually is, the specialization of the service in
dustry is not necessarily better.

Hochschild starts out well and draws
subtle distinctions and nuances in the indus
try-client relationship in her examination of
the institution that is American courtship.
The later chapters leave solid ground and
embrace anecdotal evidence in praise of an
ideal that is surprisingly reactionary: In
Hochschild's frequent paeans to her family
farm we see a dream of a bygone nation that
in many ways never even existed self-re
liant, happy and willing to tolerate a lower
standard of living. (In an era of unprece
dented consumerism, perhaps the author
has a point.) It should not be surprising that
in a sharp change from the beginning, the
reference notes for these later chapters are
tangential at best and nonexistent at worst.
Trying to tie a hundred thoughts togeth
er, the book's conclusion raises questions
about capitalism and free markets but does
not suggest any solutions. America is por
trayed as consumerism victorious: laissez
faire capitalism rampant, heedlessly de
stroying communities and families.
Hochschild snipes at deregulation and
privatization, but she does not even explain
how they relate to her overarching point
with 10 or so pages remaining, it's not like
she has the time. Throughout the book,
we're not sure what Hochschild would
rather have; as American capitalists, we
chose this world and this mode of society for
a reason. More specific to the book, many
couples are unable to have children
should we bar them from seeking surro
gates? Before that, perhaps the govern
ment should nationalize wedding planners
or purchase eHarmony?
The greatest disappointment of the
book, however, is that Hochschild does not
adequately find the source of the problem:
Why do we outsource? Some demand is ar
tificially driven; Listerine famously stigma
tized bad breath in order to sell itself. But it
seems as though the outsourcing
Hochschild questions is not a product of
Mad Men-esque advertising giants. Rather,
in many cases, we only have ourselves to
blame. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
found that the average American works on
ly 34 hours a week, as opposed to 38 hours
in 1964. Even with extra time available to
America's workers, parents are being sent
to nursing homes and children are being
sent to childcare.

Even so, the failure of today's society is
not that we have less time to raise families
and support societies; it's that we simply
don't want to do so. Hochschild treats many
of outsourcing's excesses as unnecessary
because they are. If Hochschild then wants
to criticize capitalism, she must acknowl
edge that the beauty of the free market
and of democracy is that if you are unsat
isfied with what you buy, you get what you
deserve.
The free market existed back when
Hochschild's family ran a farm many
decades ago, an idyllic time in her memory.

The only difference is that now we can af
ford to pay for the things we have always
wanted. Civilization is crying for help, to be
sure, but after reading this book it's still
hard to see why.
