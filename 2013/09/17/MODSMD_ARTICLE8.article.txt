# First They Killed My Father
## 
### WINSTON SHI STAFF WRITER 
It seems impossible that any sort of
journalistic lede could possibly do justice to
Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, when
its Communist leaders massacred a quarter
of the nation's people. Faced with a similar
display of evil at the Buchenwald concentra
tion camp, the finest reporter of his era
could only say: "For most of it, I have no
words." The same most certainly applies to
Cambodia a so-called "Democratic Kam
puchea"— from 1975 to 1979. The word
"repressive" doesn't quite capture the
sadistic quality of it, and "mindless" ignores
its ideological underpinnings. No words can
truly express the evil that ran amok under
the Cambodian regime, so why try?
It's not as though words are necessary.
The Khmer Rouge was composed of fastidi
ous record-keepers, and today Cambodia
remembers its holocaust through all the
documents of genocide: photos of the dead,
personal histories, false confessions and
cabinets full of human skulls. But for those
that insist on words, it seems almost more
descriptive to use the terms that the Khmer
Rouge falsely claimed for itself: "equitable,"
when the revolution simply swapped one so
cial structure for another; "visionary," as
though mass murder could be called vision
ary; "democratic" and here we are re
minded that if a government must call itself
democratic, it probably isn't.
The most terrifying fact about the Cam
bodian killing fields, though, is that they are
nothing new. In her memoir of the Khmer
Rouge, "First They Killed My Father,"
Loung Ung never mentions the Nazi Holo
caust or the Rwandan genocide, but one's
mind drifts inexorably to these crimes
nonetheless. As Ung transitions from com
fortable city girl to orphan stumbling
around the countryside, the ghosts of atroc
ities past reach out to us. Perhaps that is be
cause the Cambodian genocide occupies an
undeservedly minor space in the American
psyche; nevertheless, the key point is that
its darkness is not alien to us.

Ung does not pretend in any way, shape
or form to give a definitive account of the
Cambodian horror. Why would she need to?
Thrown into starker relief, then, is the
greater crime of the human spirit that
even after so many horrors, yet another
genocide was allowed to occur.
In this vein, Ung reasons further: If
genocide is shocking enough, why not make

it more shocking by telling it through a
child's eyes? But the incongruity of a child
experiencing such worldly pains, envisioned
as the book's greatest asset, is actually its
greatest fault. In a sense, Ung portrays a
child far too well. The book reads in the
same way that little girls and boys talk
far too much description and thoughts fly
ing every which way, coherent but a dream.

Everything is told; nothing is shown.
Paragraphs are disconnected more often
than not. Perhaps that is part of the point.
But children are really not that good to talk
to, and by sounding like a child Ung sacri
fices some of her credibility.
The book, put simply, is badly written.
Portraying the sheer inanity of the mind of
a five-year-old is a very questionable deci
sion on Ung's part. I hesitate to declare the
book not worth reading, because it is; things
get rolling as soon as we leave the industri
al capital of Phnom Penh, and Ung's stark
description of the faces of evil leaves little
more to be desired, if only because of evil's
sheer undesirability.
But readers cannot be faulted for put
ting the book down within the first 50 pages
or so. Ung seems caught between remem
bering an idealized pre-Communist Cambo
dia and documenting her trials in the years
that followed. The book only declares itself
towards the latter when the eponymous fa
ther dies. Meanwhile Ung maintains her in
sistence on the child narrative. In the end,
the Wikipedia article on the Khmer Rouge
is more informative and more readable

in this case, a picture really is worth a thou
sand words.

Indeed, with the book complete, the
reader is left with more questions than be
fore. From the perspective of a child, war
seems totally senseless, and indeed on a
certain fundamental level it is. But that fact
fails to adequately explain why people rise
in revolution and fight wars. Ung describes
her pre-Communist life as an idyll, and per
haps for her family it was —well-off, her
father a government man, cosmopolitan city
dwellers all. The Khmer Rouge ultimately
betrayed its own people, but from where did
it derive its power? Surely not all Cambodi
ans were as contented with the prewar gov
ernment as Ung's family was.
Many people actually supported the
Khmer Rouge; the question, then, is why?
While nobody expects Ung to support revo
lution or murder, her refusal to acknowl
edge the underpinnings of the upheaval
that led to darkness makes her life seem not
idyllic but cripplingly out of touch. Ung's
passing mentions of the restless country
side are even more frustrating in this re
gard: She could explain more, but she sim
ply won't.
In the end, Ung's description of horror is
far more compelling, although similarly
to the exposition the plot leaves us some
what adrift with regards to context. At the
time, Ung did not know the context of the
tragedy surrounding her, but the context
does matter to us readers because, unlike
her, we can actually make use of it.
Ung argues implicitly that ideology and
self-awareness are irrelevant to a child. She
is right, but hers is not a children's book.
Any book on the Cambodian genocide, espe
cially one as bluntly titled as "First They
Killed My Father," is a book for adults and
an inseparably political book. Ung does her
readers a disservice by claiming that the
hopes and dreams of people other than her
family are immaterial to the narrative.
Knowing that a crime occurred is meaning
less; knowing how and why it did helps us
prevent it from happening again.
Someday, words will be written that ful
ly capture the horror and madness of the
Khmer Rouge, that ignoble brother of the
Holocaust. Ung's memory, however, is not
that book. Still, one must imagine that when
that book is written, its writer will have
been standing on the shoulders of the
proverbial giants giants such as a small
little girl from a big city who suffered things
that we can hardly imagine.

It seems impossible that any sort of
journalistic lede could possibly do justice to
Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, when
its Communist leaders massacred a quarter
of the nation's people. Faced with a similar
display of evil at the Buchenwald concentra
tion camp, the finest reporter of his era
could only say: "For most of it, I have no
words." The same most certainly applies to
Cambodia a so-called "Democratic Kam
puchea"— from 1975 to 1979. The word
"repressive" doesn't quite capture the
sadistic quality of it, and "mindless" ignores
its ideological underpinnings. No words can
truly express the evil that ran amok under
the Cambodian regime, so why try?
It's not as though words are necessary.
The Khmer Rouge was composed of fastidi
ous record-keepers, and today Cambodia
remembers its holocaust through all the
documents of genocide: photos of the dead,
personal histories, false confessions and
cabinets full of human skulls. But for those
that insist on words, it seems almost more
descriptive to use the terms that the Khmer
Rouge falsely claimed for itself: "equitable,"
when the revolution simply swapped one so
cial structure for another; "visionary," as
though mass murder could be called vision
ary; "democratic" and here we are re
minded that if a government must call itself
democratic, it probably isn't.
The most terrifying fact about the Cam
bodian killing fields, though, is that they are
nothing new. In her memoir of the Khmer
Rouge, "First They Killed My Father,"
Loung Ung never mentions the Nazi Holo
caust or the Rwandan genocide, but one's
mind drifts inexorably to these crimes
nonetheless. As Ung transitions from com
fortable city girl to orphan stumbling
around the countryside, the ghosts of atroc
ities past reach out to us. Perhaps that is be
cause the Cambodian genocide occupies an
undeservedly minor space in the American
psyche; nevertheless, the key point is that
its darkness is not alien to us.

Ung does not pretend in any way, shape
or form to give a definitive account of the
Cambodian horror. Why would she need to?
Thrown into starker relief, then, is the
greater crime of the human spirit that
even after so many horrors, yet another
genocide was allowed to occur.
In this vein, Ung reasons further: If
genocide is shocking enough, why not make

it more shocking by telling it through a
child's eyes? But the incongruity of a child
experiencing such worldly pains, envisioned
as the book's greatest asset, is actually its
greatest fault. In a sense, Ung portrays a
child far too well. The book reads in the
same way that little girls and boys talk
far too much description and thoughts fly
ing every which way, coherent but a dream.

Everything is told; nothing is shown.
Paragraphs are disconnected more often
than not. Perhaps that is part of the point.
But children are really not that good to talk
to, and by sounding like a child Ung sacri
fices some of her credibility.
The book, put simply, is badly written.
Portraying the sheer inanity of the mind of
a five-year-old is a very questionable deci
sion on Ung's part. I hesitate to declare the
book not worth reading, because it is; things
get rolling as soon as we leave the industri
al capital of Phnom Penh, and Ung's stark
description of the faces of evil leaves little
more to be desired, if only because of evil's
sheer undesirability.
But readers cannot be faulted for put
ting the book down within the first 50 pages
or so. Ung seems caught between remem
bering an idealized pre-Communist Cambo
dia and documenting her trials in the years
that followed. The book only declares itself
towards the latter when the eponymous fa
ther dies. Meanwhile Ung maintains her in
sistence on the child narrative. In the end,
the Wikipedia article on the Khmer Rouge
is more informative and more readable

in this case, a picture really is worth a thou
sand words.

Indeed, with the book complete, the
reader is left with more questions than be
fore. From the perspective of a child, war
seems totally senseless, and indeed on a
certain fundamental level it is. But that fact
fails to adequately explain why people rise
in revolution and fight wars. Ung describes
her pre-Communist life as an idyll, and per
haps for her family it was —well-off, her
father a government man, cosmopolitan city
dwellers all. The Khmer Rouge ultimately
betrayed its own people, but from where did
it derive its power? Surely not all Cambodi
ans were as contented with the prewar gov
ernment as Ung's family was.
Many people actually supported the
Khmer Rouge; the question, then, is why?
While nobody expects Ung to support revo
lution or murder, her refusal to acknowl
edge the underpinnings of the upheaval
that led to darkness makes her life seem not
idyllic but cripplingly out of touch. Ung's
passing mentions of the restless country
side are even more frustrating in this re
gard: She could explain more, but she sim
ply won't.
In the end, Ung's description of horror is
far more compelling, although similarly
to the exposition the plot leaves us some
what adrift with regards to context. At the
time, Ung did not know the context of the
tragedy surrounding her, but the context
does matter to us readers because, unlike
her, we can actually make use of it.
Ung argues implicitly that ideology and
self-awareness are irrelevant to a child. She
is right, but hers is not a children's book.
Any book on the Cambodian genocide, espe
cially one as bluntly titled as "First They
Killed My Father," is a book for adults and
an inseparably political book. Ung does her
readers a disservice by claiming that the
hopes and dreams of people other than her
family are immaterial to the narrative.
Knowing that a crime occurred is meaning
less; knowing how and why it did helps us
prevent it from happening again.
Someday, words will be written that ful
ly capture the horror and madness of the
Khmer Rouge, that ignoble brother of the
Holocaust. Ung's memory, however, is not
that book. Still, one must imagine that when
that book is written, its writer will have
been standing on the shoulders of the
proverbial giants giants such as a small
little girl from a big city who suffered things
that we can hardly imagine.
