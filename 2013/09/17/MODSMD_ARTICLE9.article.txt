# The 						Art of Fielding
## 
### MOLLY VORWERCK MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's Three Books program is
nearly as integral to the fabric of the school
as some of our other, more eccentric tradi
tions (Full Moon on the Quad and Exotic
Party come to mind). In that sense, it's fit
ting that "home" a safe place, a place of
community is the theme of this year's se
lections. Unfortunately, despite its best in
tentions, Chad Harbach's novel, "The Art of
Fielding," is unable to imbue Westish Col-
lege, the book's setting, with this
same sense of belonging.
That is not to say that Har
bach's breakthrough novel is com
pletely rootless. From the college's
sexually confused president to the
baseball team's fresh-faced prodi
gy, the novel's protagonists strug
gle to find themselves in the small
town, Midwestern bubble that
Westish provides, but the college
seems less of a home and more of a
train stop, a place to pause lest
nothing better comes along.

The novel chronicles the inter
weaving lives of members of the
fictional Westish College in Wis
consin, a place reminiscent of
Kenyon College or any other un
der-the-radar liberal arts school.
At the novel's fulcrum is Henry
Skrimshander, the school's star
shortstop bound for the big
leagues. At Skrimshander's side is
"The Art of Fielding," a baseball
bible of sorts that guides him both
on and off the field. But when the
poor boy's promising future be
gins to manifest itself calls from
sports agents, offers from minor
and major league teams he
chokes under the pressure.
Along for the ride is teammate
Mike Shwartz, a self-starter type
from the rough side of town who
takes it upon himself to train
Skrimshander at the expense of
his own sense of self. And by the
end of the novel, it's still unclear
whether or not either protagonist
truly knows who he truly is or
ever will. Instead, the two charac
ters remain static in the confines of
Westish, a pleasant place to be
sure, but by no means a fertile
ground for personal growth, given
that both boys end up nearly where
they started by the final chapter.
The most problematic element
of the novel is the inconceivability
of some of the relationships, most
notably that between Guert Affen
light, the school's 60-year-old
president, and Owen Dunne, an
undergraduate whose confidence
and intelligence Affenlight falls in
love with. Despite having been
with many women and writing a
book on literary bromances, Af
fenlight becomes enamored with
Dunne, a man younger than his
own daughter. Affenlight, a per
petual bachelor, craves an intellec
tual and sexual companion, and,
for some reason, Dunne fits the
bill.
May-December romances are

not unheard of, particularly in lit
erature, but at the same time,
there is no Nabokovian prelude to
Affenlight's infatuation with
Dunne. He foolishly embarks on a
romance with Dunne, who re
sponds in earnest, with even more
confidence than the old man de
spite the younger's relative lack of
authority and age. Although Af
fenlight's motivations behind his
affections for Dunne are clear (or,
clear-ish given his bachelorhood
and fascination with 19th century
homoerotic literature), Dunne's
are not. Dunne, who is openly gay,
does not make his reasoning clear
but forces Affenlight to treat their
liaisons like a full-blown relation

ship as opposed to a covert affair,
which ultimately leads to the pres
ident's downfall. The whole situa
tion is a little too far-fetched, even
if it is all in the name of dare I
say it rue love.
Nevertheless, the only charac
ter that I truly felt was able to
hold his own and not flounder un
derneath a facade of arrogance or
immaturity was Dunne, who does
n't cling to Westish as a means of
self-identification but instead en
riches the school with his independ
ent spirit, much in the same vein
that Stanford hopes the incoming
freshmen will add new life to its
campus. Dunne is self-aware, yet
vulnerable; unique, yet relatable

enough to garner sympathy. His
character is rich enough to spawn
sequels, if Harbach so chooses to
continue the Westish saga.
Another redeeming element of
Harbach's novel is his poignant
and pithy voice, which makes for a
fast, compelling read. He draws on
not only Affenlight's beloved 19th
century literary heroes
Melville, Emerson and Whitman
to name a few but also on pop
culture, sports and esoteric as
pects of small college life. Some
times the book reads as smoothly
as a primetime soap opera dad
dy issues, ill-fated hookups, freak
accidents and all. For the sake of
enjoyment if not anything else,

"The Art of Fielding" is a safe pick.
Still, by the end of the book one
is unsure what "home" means to
Harbach. Sure, Westish is a home
of sorts, but did its inhabitants re
ally grow into themselves to the ex
tent that they leave the college a
better place? Or did Skrimshander,
Schwartz and the gang simply en
gage in a series of arguments
around the family dinner table in
which nothing was settled? As we
strive to forge our own identities on
Stanford's campus, the latter op
tion, although deflating, is certainly
more realistic.
