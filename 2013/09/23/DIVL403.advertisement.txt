ART HISTORY
ARTHIST 1 INTRODUCTION TO THE VISUAL ARTS
Alex Nemerov, 5 units, MWF 11 -11:50
This course surveys the history of Western painting from the start of the 14th
century to the late 20th century and our own moment. Lectures introduce important
artists (Giotto, Rembrandt, Velazquez, Goya, Manet, Matisse, Pollock, and others),
and major themes associated with the art of particular periods and cultures. The
course emphasizes training students to look closely at - and to write about - works
of art. Satisfies the WAY-Aii requirement.
ARTHISTIOI ARCHAIC GREEK ART
Jody Maxmin, 4 units, MWF 9:30 -10:45
The development of Greek art and culture from protogeometric beginnings
to the Persian Wars, 1000-480 B.C.E. The genesis of a native Greek style;
the orientalizing phase during which contact with the Near East and Egypt
transformed Greek art; and the synthesis of East and West in the 6th
century B.C.E.
ARTHIST 109 D MEANS, MEDIA AND MODE: AN INTRODUCTION TO
WESTERN MEDIEVAL ART
Beatrice Kitzinger, 4 units, TTh 2:15 - 3:45
An introduction to western medieval art approached primarily through distinctions of
materials and media. We engage with the modern objects and spaces available for
study on campus in order to create new perspectives on historical material.
Medieval case studies raise particularly complex issues of materiality, mixed-media
form, and cross-media citation.
ARTHIST 122 THE AGE OF REVOLUTION: PAINTING IN EUROPE 1780 -1830
Michael Marrinan, 4 units, TTh 11 -12:30
Survey of European painting bracketed by the French Revolution and the end of
the Napoleonic conquest. Against this background of social upheavel, the visual
arts were profoundly affected by shifts in patronage, public, and ideas about the
social utility of image making. Lectures and readings align ruptures in the tradition
of representation with the unfolding historical situation, and trace the first
manifestations of a "romantic" alternative to the classicism that was the cultural
legacy of pre-Revolutionary Europe. Satisfies the WAY-Aii requirement.
ARTHIST 132 AMERICAN ART AND CULTURE, 1528-1910
Bryan Wolf, 4 units, TTh 9 -10:30
The visual arts and literature of the U.S. from the beginnings of European
exploration to the Civil War. Focus is on questions of power and its relation to
culture from early Spanish exploration to the rise of the middle classes. Cabeza de
Vaca, Benjamin Franklin, John Singleton Copley, Phillis Wheatley, Charles Willson
Peale, Emerson, Hudson River School, American Genre painters, Melville,
Hawthorne and others. Satisfies the WAY-Aii requirement.
ARTHIST 147 THE VISUAL CULTURE OF MODERNISM AND ITS
DISCONTENTS
Nancy J. Troy, 4 units, MW 12:35 - 2:05
Explores how modern experience is represented in painting, architecture,
film and design from Paris in the Impressionist era to Charlie Chaplin in
the Great Depression. Modernism is understood as a Utopian dream and
a terrible nightmare-both responses inspired by industrialization,
urbanization, and the rise of mass culture in Europe and the US.
Satisfies the WAY-Aii requirement.
ARTHIST 157A HISTORIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY
Elizabeth Bennett, 4 units, TTh 12:35 - 2:05
This course investigates multiple histories of photography. Rather than stabilizing
any single trajectory of technological development, the course is more interested in
considering the "work" performed by photography. Through historical case studies,
it considers how "to photograph" means to order; to construct; to record; to censor;
to wound; to heal.
