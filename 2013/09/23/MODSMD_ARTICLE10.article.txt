## Analyzing a surprising blowout 
### Sam Fisher 
Well that was...in
teresting. I don't
really know how to
begin with my
analysis of Stan
ford football's 42-28 win against Ari
zona State Saturday, so I guess I'll
start with the dominant first half.

In that half, Stanford (finally)
looked like a national championship
contender. I'm not sure what was
more impressive: dominating Arizona
State's potent offense or putting up 29
points against the vaunted Sun Devil
defense. Oh, and senior punter Ben
Rhyne was on point too, with a perfect
pooch punt that fifth-year nickelback
Usua Amanam beautifully caught out
of midair inside the five-yard line.
What's funny about the win, how
ever, is that no new star broke out in
the game. The lasting takeaway in
stead is that junior wide receiver ty
Montgomeiy and senior running back
Tyler Gaffney are both as good as
they seemed through two weeks, even
against a veiy good defense.
Heading into Saturday, Gaffney
had put up video game numbers: 236
yards on 40 carries with three rushing
touchdowns and another through the
air. While he didn't match his 5.9
yards-per-carry productivity, Gaffney
did pick up 95 yards on 19 carries and
find the end zone twiceâ€”what more
could you ask for?
It's not just the stats that have
been impressive for Gaffney; he sim
ply looks better out there. We heard in
the spring that he had added close to
10 pounds of muscle without losing
any of his speed, but I didn't realize
what that would mean in terms of on
field performance until the month of
September rolled around. His explo
siveness, slipperiness and toughness
have been spectacular, and now
there's no reason to think it can't con
tinue through the season especially
with fellow senior running back An
thony Wilkerson keeping him fresh.
On the same note, the first three
weeks of ty Montgomery's season
have been downright scary. The
biggest disappointment of the 2012
