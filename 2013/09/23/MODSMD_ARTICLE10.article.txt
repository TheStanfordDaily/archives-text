## Analyzing a surprising blowout 
### Sam Fisher 
Well that was...in
teresting. I don't
really know how to
begin with my
analysis of Stan
ford football's 42-28 win against Ari
zona State Saturday, so I guess I'll
start with the dominant first half.

In that half, Stanford (finally)
looked like a national championship
contender. I'm not sure what was
more impressive: dominating Arizona
State's potent offense or putting up 29
points against the vaunted Sun Devil
defense. Oh, and senior punter Ben
Rhyne was on point too, with a perfect
pooch punt that fifth-year nickelback
Usua Amanam beautifully caught out
of midair inside the five-yard line.
What's funny about the win, how
ever, is that no new star broke out in
the game. The lasting takeaway in
stead is that junior wide receiver ty
Montgomeiy and senior running back
Tyler Gaffney are both as good as
they seemed through two weeks, even
against a veiy good defense.
Heading into Saturday, Gaffney
had put up video game numbers: 236
yards on 40 carries with three rushing
touchdowns and another through the
air. While he didn't match his 5.9
yards-per-carry productivity, Gaffney
did pick up 95 yards on 19 carries and
find the end zone twiceâ€”what more
could you ask for?
It's not just the stats that have
been impressive for Gaffney; he sim
ply looks better out there. We heard in
the spring that he had added close to
10 pounds of muscle without losing
any of his speed, but I didn't realize
what that would mean in terms of on
field performance until the month of
September rolled around. His explo
siveness, slipperiness and toughness
have been spectacular, and now
there's no reason to think it can't con
tinue through the season especially
with fellow senior running back An
thony Wilkerson keeping him fresh.
On the same note, the first three
weeks of ty Montgomery's season
have been downright scary. The
biggest disappointment of the 2012

season, Montgomery proved
that injuries, and certainly not
a lack of talent, was what held
him back. He's open pretty
much every time he runs down
the field, even splitting triple
coverage against San Jose
State, and has earned all four
of his touchdown grabs on the
season. And as a former offen
sive lineman, how can I not
love a wide receiver who em
braces contact like Mont
gomery? He doesn't absorb
blows; he delivers them.
But I would be remiss to
talk about the positives of Sat
urday's game without talking
about the ugliness that was
the fourth quarter.
None of us will ever under
stand what was truly behind
head coach David Shaw's de
cision to pull junior quarter
back Kevin Hogan with 14
minutes remaining in the
game and Stanford leading
39-14, because Shaw will nev
er tell us. However, what we
do know is that everything

that happened from that mo
ment on was borderline disas
trous.
I'm not here to judge
Shaw's decision-making in
hindsight; many coaches
would pull their starters lead
ing by 25 in the fourth quarter.
I'm here to talk about what we
learned from everything that
transpired after the decision.
Unlike the 2010 Stanford
Cardinal, this Stanford team
showed that it has trouble
keeping its foot on the gas
pedal when it has a big lead.
There are many possible rea
sons for this, the biggest of
course being that it is hard to
keep applying pressure with
out your starting quarterback
in the game, but many of the
players giving up touchdowns
on defense were starters. For
that reason, we can't totally
write off the three late touch
down drives as simply
"garbage-time scores."
Even more importantly
than the lesson learned, how
ever, Stanford received some
negative repercussions for not
putting the game away earli
er. With only around seven
minutes remaining in the
game, senior free safety Ed

Reynolds was still in the game
trying to protect Stanford's
rapidly declining lead. On a
blitz, Reynolds laid a helmet
to-helmet hit on ASU quarter
back Taylor Kelly and was
promptly ejected.
Though Stanford didn't
miss him the rest of the way
on Saturday, Reynolds' sus
pension carries over to the
first half of next week's con
test. And with Stanford's in
jury-created lack of depth at
cornerback and free safety,
this could be a huge issue
against Washington State. If
Stanford falls behind in that
game early, blame the fourth
quarter against Arizona State.
And for that reason,
though Stanford was so im
pressive and started so
strongly, the lasting impact of
the 42-28 win is a bad taste in
my mouth. Isn't that a shame?
