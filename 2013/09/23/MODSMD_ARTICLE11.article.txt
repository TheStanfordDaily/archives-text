# TWICE AS NICE
## CARD SWEEPS WEEKEND SLATE 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
The best teams heat up at the best
times.

Stanford men's soccer defeated the Col
lege of Charleston 2-0 on Friday night and
also beat Colgate 1-0 on Sunday afternoon
to improve its record to 4-1-1 with one final
match remaining before the start of Pac-12
conference play. The two victories this
weekend stretched Stanford's current win
ning streak to four, a feat last achieved in
September 2010.

"I'd say it definitely helps our confi
dence," said sophomore forward Adrian Al
abi. "We're now on a four-game win streak
doing a lot of the right things so we just
have to keep it up."
On Friday night, a brace from junior
forward Zach Batteer paved the way as the
Cardinal coasted to a comfortable victory in
front of a freshman-led crowd. Only two
minutes into the match, sophomore mid
fielder Aaron Kovar's corner was headed
towards the back post by senior defender-
Matt Taylor where Batteer rose up and
pounded it home. In the 61st minute, for
ward Jordan Morris sped past defenders
on the left side and sent a perfect pass over
the middle to Batteer, who slotted it home
for his second of the night.
Batteer's two goals brought his season
total up to a team-leading four. Cardinal
senior keeper Drew Hutchins made several
spectacular saves late in the match and
throughout the entire game to preserve the
clean sheet.

Last season, the College of Charleston
won a home match against the Cardinal 2-1
on an overtime penalty kick. This time, the
Cardinal established early that it would be
the aggressor and dictated the flow of the
game. Stanford certainly had its revenge
on Charleston with the 2-0 victory on its
home turf.

In Sunday's match against Colgate, the
memories of a slow start to the game were
quickly wiped away by a dominant per
formance in the second half. Sophomore
midfielder Eric Verso notched his second
