# TWICE AS NICE
## CARD SWEEPS WEEKEND SLATE 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
The best teams heat up at the best
times.

Stanford men's soccer defeated the Col
lege of Charleston 2-0 on Friday night and
also beat Colgate 1-0 on Sunday afternoon
to improve its record to 4-1-1 with one final
match remaining before the start of Pac-12
conference play. The two victories this
weekend stretched Stanford's current win
ning streak to four, a feat last achieved in
September 2010.

"I'd say it definitely helps our confi
dence," said sophomore forward Adrian Al
abi. "We're now on a four-game win streak
doing a lot of the right things so we just
have to keep it up."
On Friday night, a brace from junior
forward Zach Batteer paved the way as the
Cardinal coasted to a comfortable victory in
front of a freshman-led crowd. Only two
minutes into the match, sophomore mid
fielder Aaron Kovar's corner was headed
towards the back post by senior defender-
Matt Taylor where Batteer rose up and
pounded it home. In the 61st minute, for
ward Jordan Morris sped past defenders
on the left side and sent a perfect pass over
the middle to Batteer, who slotted it home
for his second of the night.
Batteer's two goals brought his season
total up to a team-leading four. Cardinal
senior keeper Drew Hutchins made several
spectacular saves late in the match and
throughout the entire game to preserve the
clean sheet.

Last season, the College of Charleston
won a home match against the Cardinal 2-1
on an overtime penalty kick. This time, the
Cardinal established early that it would be
the aggressor and dictated the flow of the
game. Stanford certainly had its revenge
on Charleston with the 2-0 victory on its
home turf.

In Sunday's match against Colgate, the
memories of a slow start to the game were
quickly wiped away by a dominant per
formance in the second half. Sophomore
midfielder Eric Verso notched his second

goal of the season as he
knocked a ball that was
bouncing around in the box
into the back of the net after
a corner kick in the 47th
minute. The goal would
prove to be the difference in
the game as Colgate was un
able to respond. The Raiders
only managed five shots, and
Hutchins turned them all
away to earn his third
shutout of the year.
Kovar, the reigning Pac
-12 Freshman of the Year,
proved to be an excellent
threat coming forward on
the left side for the Cardinal
in both games, earning an
assist on the corner kick
against Charleston and pro
viding threatening crosses
into the box in both contests.
The team will travel to
UC-Santa Barbara Friday

for the final game before the
start of a brutal Pac-12
schedule that includes multi
ple matches against fourth
ranked California, sixth
ranked Washington and
llth-ranked UCLA. The
other opponents Oregon
State and San Diego State
are no pushovers either.

With the Cardinal heat
ing up at the most opportune
time, hopes are high that it
will be able to compete for
the Pac-12 title. An early
test against Washington will
be a good chance to evaluate
the Cardinal's early season
performances and validate
or diminish any title
ambitions.

Stanford travels to play
UC-Santa Barbara on Sept.
27 at 7 p.m. before returning
home to host the Huskies on
Oct. 3 in a match that will be
televised on the Pac-12 Net
works.
