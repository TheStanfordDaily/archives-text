# STANFORD TOPS CAL ON THE TURF

### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford-Cal rivalry is off to a
good start for the Cardinal this season
after the women's field hockey team
trounced the Golden Bears 3-0 in its
NorPac opener Friday afternoon.

The match marked the sixth
straight victory for Stanford, which
demonstrated its offensive power
throughout the Friday game with ad
vantages in shots (18-1) and penalty
corners (9-0). The game was also a
testament to the Cardinal defense,
which, anchored by goalkeeper Dul
cie Davies, secured their fourth
shutout in a row.

"We were well pleased with the

win," said head coach Tara Danielson.
"We felt the team had a total team ef
fort. We were able to move the ball re
ally well from left to right, front to
back, and so that created a lot of op
portunities for us in the second half."
Stanford (6-1,1-0 NorPac) started
the match off strong and took the lead
in the eighth minute when junior Alex
McCawley rocketed her first goal to
the top right corner of the goal. She
became the ninth Stanford player to
record at least one goal this season.
The Card controlled the majority
of the play in the first half, allowing
only one shot from Cal's Nicole Wall
stedt right before halftime, the first
shot allowed by Stanford at home in
over 100 minutes of game action
spanning three matches. Stanford al
so extended its shutout streak to
348:89, dating back to the second
minute against No. 20 New Hamp-

One shot was enough to make Stan
ford tighten its grip on the Golden
Bears, as the Cardinal dominated the
ball in the second half. Stanford brought
its shot total for the game up from sev
en to 18, scoring two goals off of key
penalty corners.

Junior Kelsey Harbin continued her
scoring prowess, knocking in her fourth
goal of the season in the 49th minute.
The goal was set up nicely by fellow jun
iors Hannah Thiemann and Shannon

Herold, who provided essential ball
movement throughout the game.
Harbin, joined by freshman Fran Tew
and senior Anna Simmons, successfully
held down the back third of the field
throughout the game, denying the Gold
en Bears any scoring opportunities in the
second half.

"We knew that they were going to be
a tough team, so we came out raring to
go and it was really positive for us,"
Tew said. "It was a really good opening
rivalry game for me and just a ton of
fun to play."

The third Cardinal goal came from
McCawley again, who pounced on a re
bound after Cal made the initial save.

While it was a sweet victory for the
Cardinal, Stanford heads right back to

work for a key date with No. 5 Syracuse
in Albany, N.Y., on Saturday.
"Every next game is a big game,"
said Danielson. "We are looking to refine
and make our game a little bit more effi
cient. It took us a little while to kind of
get going, so what I'm really looking to
focus on next week is starting the game
right from the get-go with a high tempo
and being able to move the ball and capi
talize on our- opportunities."
Stanford's match at No. 5 Syracuse is
scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. Saturday.
Stanford will then play Albany on Sunday
at 10 a.m. before heading back to the
Farm.
