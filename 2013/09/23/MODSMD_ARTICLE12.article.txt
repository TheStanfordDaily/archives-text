The Stanford-Cal rivalry is off to a
good start for the Cardinal this season
after the women's field hockey team
trounced the Golden Bears 3-0 in its
NorPac opener Friday afternoon.

The match marked the sixth
straight victory for Stanford, which
demonstrated its offensive power
throughout the Friday game with ad
vantages in shots (18-1) and penalty
corners (9-0). The game was also a
testament to the Cardinal defense,
which, anchored by goalkeeper Dul
cie Davies, secured their fourth
shutout in a row.

"We were well pleased with the

win," said head coach Tara Danielson.
"We felt the team had a total team ef
fort. We were able to move the ball re
ally well from left to right, front to
back, and so that created a lot of op
portunities for us in the second half."
Stanford (6-1,1-0 NorPac) started
the match off strong and took the lead
in the eighth minute when junior Alex
McCawley rocketed her first goal to
the top right corner of the goal. She
became the ninth Stanford player to
record at least one goal this season.
The Card controlled the majority
of the play in the first half, allowing
only one shot from Cal's Nicole Wall
stedt right before halftime, the first
shot allowed by Stanford at home in
over 100 minutes of game action
spanning three matches. Stanford al
so extended its shutout streak to
348:89, dating back to the second
minute against No. 20 New Hamp-
