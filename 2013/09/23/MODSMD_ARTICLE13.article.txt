# BLOCKS KEY TWO QUICK VICTORIES
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's volleyball
went into 2013, like past seasons,
with one goal in mind: to win a na
tional championship. The Cardinal
started the season ranked third in
the nation, coming off of a heart
breaking loss in the regional finals of
the 2012 NCAA Tournament, which
marked the team's 32nd consecutive
appearance in the tournament. With
all of its starters back for the 2013
season, Stanford is considered by
many to be one of the favorites for
the NCAA title.
After a brutal five-match road
trip that knocked Stanford out of the
top five, the No. 8-ranked Cardinal
retuned to Maples where it took
down Cal Poly on Wednesday and

Saint Mary's on Friday, improving
its record to 7-2 to finish out noncon
ference play.

Against Cal Poly, the Cardinal
demonstrated a near-perfect offen
sive display, not committing an error
until the third set, finishing with a
.453 attack percentage and taking
the match in three sets, 25-12,25-10,
25-19. In comparison, the Mustangs
committed 21 errors to finish with a
.054 attack percentage and only one
block to Stanford's 11.

Sophomore Inky Ajanuku posted

a season-high six blocks,
while fellow classmate and
setter Madi Bugg had a sea
son-high three service aces
and was just one dig shy of a
double-double. Junior libero
Kyle Gilbert also had a sea
son-best match with five as
sists.

"We were exhausted from
the road trip but... we did a
lot of recovery as a team,"
Ajanaku said. "We made sure
that was a point this year to
make sure that our bodies
were the best for each game.
We came out strong. I think
our serving and our blocking
really helped, and [we knew]
they do fast sets coming into
the game so we focused on
that."

Stanford dominated from
the very beginning of the first
set, with 14 kills on 27 hits and
no errors. The momentum
continued as the Cardinal
again committed no errors in
the second set. The third set
wasn't quite as lopsided as the
opening two, with Stanford
committing its first attack er
ror while rotating in substi
tutes. Cal Poly buckled down
to hit a match high .226, but it
wasn't enough to overcome

Ajanuku's eight kills and
Stanford's great team de
fense.

"We knew the tempo
would be fast from scouting,
so all of our blockers were on
the move," Ajanaku said.
Saint Mary's put up a bet
ter fight on Friday night,
pushing the game to four sets
and revealing some of the
Card's evident tiredness left
over from the long road trip.

The 25-17,23-25,25-21,25-
22 win was an all-around team
effort with six players in par
ticular finishing with impres
sive stats. Senior middle
blocker Carly Wopat led the
team with a season-high 16
kills while adding five blocks
and three aces. Sophomore
outside hitters Jordan
Burgess and Brittany
Howard each added a double
double and senior Rachel
Williams contributed with her
team-leading fourth double
double of the season. Bugg
controlled the offense with 50
assists to go with seven digs
and a season high of four kills
and five blocks.
Stanford finished with a
.255 attack percentage, while
Saint Mary's was right on its
heels at .2*22. The Cardinal's
momentum was due to the
combination of strong block
ing and serving; Stanford fin
ished with 14.5 blocks on the
night, led by Ajanaku's sea

son-high eight blocks.
Bugg racked up 12 of her
assists in the first set, helping
Wopat start off strong with
four kills and three digs to
lead the team. The Gaels nar
rowly took the second set af
ter 14 ties and five lead
changes, ultimately hitting a
better attack percentage than
the Cardinal. Stanford came
back to win the third set but
still couldn't post a higher hit
ting percentage.

The Cardinal outhit the
Gaels in the fourth and final
set and recorded five blocks
to finish out the set 25-22.
Wopat won the match point
with an ace to seal the victory.
With its challenging non
conference schedule now
complete, Stanford opens up
Pac-12 play on Wednesday at
Berkeley.
