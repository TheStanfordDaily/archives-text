# BLOCKS KEY TWO QUICK VICTORIES

### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's volleyball
went into 2013, like past seasons,
with one goal in mind: to win a na
tional championship. The Cardinal
started the season ranked third in
the nation, coming off of a heart
breaking loss in the regional finals of
the 2012 NCAA Tournament, which
marked the team's 32nd consecutive
appearance in the tournament. With
all of its starters back for the 2013
season, Stanford is considered by
many to be one of the favorites for
the NCAA title.
After a brutal five-match road
trip that knocked Stanford out of the
top five, the No. 8-ranked Cardinal
retuned to Maples where it took
down Cal Poly on Wednesday and

Saint Mary's on Friday, improving
its record to 7-2 to finish out noncon
ference play.

Against Cal Poly, the Cardinal
demonstrated a near-perfect offen
sive display, not committing an error
until the third set, finishing with a
.453 attack percentage and taking
the match in three sets, 25-12,25-10,
25-19. In comparison, the Mustangs
committed 21 errors to finish with a
.054 attack percentage and only one
block to Stanford's 11.
