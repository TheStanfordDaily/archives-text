## Letter to the Class of 2017 
### McKenzie Andrews 
Dear Class of 2017,
Welcome home, freshman!
The next four years are go
ing to be some of the most
exciting in your life. As they drilled
into you at NSO, the folks at 355
Galvez make no mistakes: Welcome
to the Cardinal family. We're so
glad to have you.
Hard work pays off, and during
the next few years you're going to
have more opportunities than you
can humanly pursue. You'll also
meet classmates who are just as
smart as you are and some smarter,
not to mention professors, some of
whom advise presidents. In the last
year, I've casually run into Chris
Christie outside an economics class
and listened to A1 Gore, Rachael
Maddow '94 and Jane Goodall
speak.

It's a different world than many
of y'all may be accustomed to, but
you're now a part of it. In a few
years, your friends (and maybe
you) will snag that Google/Goldman
Sachs/Microsoft/J.E Morgan sum
mer internship that could lead to a
career. Summers will include trav
eling to exotic places or seeing
Facebook updates from friends who
did.

With fall quarter excitement in
the air, I want to offer some advice
as you start your Stanford career.
I'm the first in my family to come to
Stanford, and I didn't have any idea
of what I was trying to get out of
my elite, private education when I
came to campus.

It felt like Jesus had a per
formed another miracle when the
acceptance came senior year, and I
continued to move forward, despite
being paralyzed by awe and jubila
tion for the majority of my fresh
man year, just trying to "enjoy col
lege." I worked my ass off in high
school and had no intention of
jumping back on that hamster
wheel immediately. In retrospect, I
had a fun freshman year, but I did
learn some things that I'd like to
impart to y'all, the Class of 2017.
1. GET INVOLVED. I can't
stress this enough. I loved being in
an all-freshman dorm, but at the
end of freshman year, the freshman
dorm ceases to hold you and your
friends and a new class moves in.
Go to dorm events: figure out
what makes your neighbors incred
ible, but also find something out
side of that to be a part of. The op
tions are so numerous that it's
overwhelming.

Join the Band; learn to twerk
better than Miley with a dance
crew; embrace the fact you're a col
lege student and join a capella or
ultimate Frisbee. At some point in
the year, you'll have an interview
for a summer program or a job or
something you can't imagine yet,
but something you'll really want to
be a part of. This will help.
2. Ignoring that last point, get
ready to fail. Stanford is inherently
a competitive place. When there's a
Stanford in Government fellowship,
a tour guide interview or a spot at
Sierra Camp, you'll be competing
against Stanford students who, like
you, got into Stanford.
You won't get everything you
apply to, but keep trying. When

you take tests for Math 51 or
CSIO6A, everyone in your class is
smart. If you were used to sailing
through high school and picking A's
off trees like apples, those days are
probably over.

In the excitement of coming to
Stanford, it's easy to forget it's an
extremely academic place. You
might work as hard as you can and
get a B. If you can reconcile this
with yourself, you'll be a happier
person.

3. Find some classes that you're
super pumped to take and take
them. Find something in the In
troSem book you got over the sum
mer or enroll in CSIOGa if you've
never taken computer science. (If
you've recently moved to the Bay
area, you'll be hearing a lot of
preaching about tech for the next
four years.) Invite your professor
to faculty night. If they're busy, ask
when they're free and grab a meal.
4. Go to campus events. If you
played a sport in high school, go
watch our D 1 teams play it. Paint
up for football games, see the dance
concerts and listen to our musicians
at Bing. Stanford's theater scene is
incredible and talented: You should
check it out.

You could probably go without a
meal plan and just eat free food at
all the campus talks. Stanford is
bursting with energy, and you're
missing out if you don't support the
people around you.

5. Take care of your dormmates
and your friends. If you go to the
Row with someone, try not to for
sake them and hold your friend's
hair back if it's the right time.
Partying is something you have
the chance to hone in college, and
try not to be that kid who got trans
ported. Everything you learn in
class is probably on the Internet,
and the friends you'll meet in the
next four years are the best part
about being on campus.
I don't have it all figured out yet,
but I know that you're going to be
incredible. A lot of people love you.
We're excited to see you thrive at
the Farm.
Love,
McKenzie

through high school and picking A's
off trees like apples, those days are
probably over.

In the excitement of coming to
Stanford, it's easy to forget it's an
extremely academic place. You
might work as hard as you can and
get a B. If you can reconcile this
with yourself, you'll be a happier
person.

3. Find some classes that you're
super pumped to take and take
them. Find something in the In
troSem book you got over the sum
mer or enroll in CSIOGa if you've
never taken computer science. (If
you've recently moved to the Bay
area, you'll be hearing a lot of
preaching about tech for the next
four years.) Invite your professor
to faculty night. If they're busy, ask
when they're free and grab a meal.
4. Go to campus events. If you
played a sport in high school, go
watch our D 1 teams play it. Paint
up for football games, see the dance
concerts and listen to our musicians
at Bing. Stanford's theater scene is
incredible and talented: You should
check it out.

You could probably go without a
meal plan and just eat free food at
all the campus talks. Stanford is
bursting with energy, and you're
missing out if you don't support the
people around you.

5. Take care of your dormmates
and your friends. If you go to the
Row with someone, try not to for
sake them and hold your friend's
hair back if it's the right time.
Partying is something you have
the chance to hone in college, and
try not to be that kid who got trans
ported. Everything you learn in
class is probably on the Internet,
and the friends you'll meet in the
next four years are the best part
about being on campus.
I don't have it all figured out yet,
but I know that you're going to be
incredible. A lot of people love you.
We're excited to see you thrive at
the Farm.
Love,
McKenzie

Dear Class of 2017,
Welcome home, freshman!
The next four years are go
ing to be some of the most
exciting in your life. As they drilled
into you at NSO, the folks at 355
Galvez make no mistakes: Welcome
to the Cardinal family. We're so
glad to have you.
Hard work pays off, and during
the next few years you're going to
have more opportunities than you
can humanly pursue. You'll also
meet classmates who are just as
smart as you are and some smarter,
not to mention professors, some of
whom advise presidents. In the last
year, I've casually run into Chris
Christie outside an economics class
and listened to A1 Gore, Rachael
Maddow '94 and Jane Goodall
speak.

It's a different world than many
of y'all may be accustomed to, but
you're now a part of it. In a few
years, your friends (and maybe
you) will snag that Google/Goldman
Sachs/Microsoft/J.E Morgan sum
mer internship that could lead to a
career. Summers will include trav
eling to exotic places or seeing
Facebook updates from friends who
did.

With fall quarter excitement in
the air, I want to offer some advice
as you start your Stanford career.
I'm the first in my family to come to
Stanford, and I didn't have any idea
of what I was trying to get out of
my elite, private education when I
came to campus.

It felt like Jesus had a per
formed another miracle when the
acceptance came senior year, and I
continued to move forward, despite
being paralyzed by awe and jubila
tion for the majority of my fresh
man year, just trying to "enjoy col
lege." I worked my ass off in high
school and had no intention of
jumping back on that hamster
wheel immediately. In retrospect, I
had a fun freshman year, but I did
learn some things that I'd like to
impart to y'all, the Class of 2017.
1. GET INVOLVED. I can't
stress this enough. I loved being in
an all-freshman dorm, but at the
end of freshman year, the freshman
dorm ceases to hold you and your
friends and a new class moves in.
Go to dorm events: figure out
what makes your neighbors incred
ible, but also find something out
side of that to be a part of. The op
tions are so numerous that it's
overwhelming.

Join the Band; learn to twerk
better than Miley with a dance
crew; embrace the fact you're a col
lege student and join a capella or
ultimate Frisbee. At some point in
the year, you'll have an interview
for a summer program or a job or
something you can't imagine yet,
but something you'll really want to
be a part of. This will help.
2. Ignoring that last point, get
ready to fail. Stanford is inherently
a competitive place. When there's a
Stanford in Government fellowship,
a tour guide interview or a spot at
Sierra Camp, you'll be competing
against Stanford students who, like
you, got into Stanford.
You won't get everything you
apply to, but keep trying. When

you take tests for Math 51 or
CSIO6A, everyone in your class is
smart. If you were used to sailing
through high school and picking A's
off trees like apples, those days are
probably over.

In the excitement of coming to
Stanford, it's easy to forget it's an
extremely academic place. You
might work as hard as you can and
get a B. If you can reconcile this
with yourself, you'll be a happier
person.
