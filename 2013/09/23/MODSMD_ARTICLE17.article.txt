"Ifyou ain't pissed off for greatness,
that means you're okay with being
mediocre."
â€” Ray Lewis

If we're going by the book, I'm
pretty much the last person you'd
expect to find working as a soft
ware engineer.
I entered college three years ago
a psychology majorand at that, a
psychology major whose computing
skills were limited to Microsoft Of
fice. The terms "command line,"
"compiler" and "cloud computing"
meant nothing to me. I thought com
puters, and the people who operated
them, were anomaliesnerdy genius
es, with whom I shared zero com
mon ground. Add to that my inabili
ty to operate a video game con
troller, and you've got the epitome of
the opposite.

However, a year into my under
graduate career, a general education
requirement compelled me to take a
programming class. I was terrifiedse
riously, scared out of my mind. But I

am so grateful that I was forced to
face that fear, because I ended up dis
covering a field nothing like the one I
had imagined.

As a somewhat naive 17-year-old,
I had entered college with the goal to
"make the world a better place." I
chose psychology to achieve this be
cause the changemakers of the gen
eration that came before me all
seemed to derive from that sort of
background. But what I didn't realize
is what had changed since then.
Taking a computer science class
opened my eyes to the major, but it al
so exposed me to the whole technolo
gy industry. It's where I discovered
that, if there's anything with the po
tential to make the world a better
place, on a grand, supernatural scale,
it is technology. Computer scientists
can literally affect the lives of billions
of people with a single program. But
when creating change, it's not about
the computers; it's about the compas
sion with which we approach them.
So as I transition out of college
and into the "real world," I have

sought out places that attract people
who keep sight of that vision. It's easy
to get caught up in a bug, or a seman
tics discussion, or even the glamor of
"entrepreneurship," but that's not
why I fell in love with this field. The
places where human ambiguity is val
ued as much as deterministic Tbring
machines, where engineers are solv
ing truly hard problems for people
outside the Silicon Valley zip
codesthose are the places that are ac
tually making the world a better place.
I've spent the last 20 years of my
life in Silicon Valley, and in the last
few I've been nauseated by the frivo
lous use of "entrepreneurship" and
"innovation" and "disruption." Tech
nology has immense power, and un
fortunately it's being harnessed for
"an app for affordable private jet so
lutions", and "Ning meets Instagram
for dog owners" (yes, those both ex
ist). But computer science is not
about the shiny new products for the
one percent; it's about what we can do
to change the way the world func
tions. And that's why I've enjoyed
working at Facebook. I've found that
engineers at Facebook have a lot
more in common than a set of fabu
lous screen tans. We tend to be com
passionate problem-solvers, obses
sive solution-seekers and passionate
about our product. A la Ray Lewis,
we're pretty damn pissed off for
greatness.

At the Facebook London offices,
our conference rooms are plastered
with posters shipped from the Menlo
Park headquarters, commanding us
to "move fast and build things." We
are reminded to value "people over
pixels," and asked "what would you
do if you weren't afraid?" And those
aren't empty words; every single per
son is held accountable for fulfilling
those promises. As an engineer I've
never been asked to document the
monetary effects of my work, but I
am challenged to think about how my
projects "make the world more open
and connected."

Looking back on my summer, I've
pushed code that has already touched
1.1 billion people. I can think of zero
other ways that I could have done
something so impactful in such mini
mal time. At Facebook it's about the
people we've never met, the places we
can't fathom and what the world will
need when we're no longer around.
It's not about being good; it's about
being pissed off for greatness.
