## Longtime assistant baseball coach Dean Stotz announces retirement 
### â€“ Sam Fisher 
Stanford assistant base
ball coach Dean Stotz '75, the
No. 2 coach behind head
coach Mark Marquess for the
past 37 seasons, retired from
coaching Friday.
"I've had a phenomenal
career. Stanford was great
before I got here, and Stan
ford will be great after I
leave," Stotz told GoStan
ford.com. "My family has sac
rificed an incredible amount
to let me do what I love. It's
time, while we're still capable,
to live on my family's terms."

Under Stotz and Mar
quess, Stanford captured two
College World Series titles
back-to-back in 1987 and 1988
> won the conference 12
times and won a total of 1,495

games.
Stotz's role evolved over
time, and as of last season,
consisted primarily of re
cruiting, statistical analysis
and running Stanford's sum

mer baseball camps, the last
of which Stotz will continue to
do after his retirement from
the baseball program. Stotz
also coached third base dur
ing the season.

"He is one of the best if
not the best assistants in
college baseball," Marquess
told GoStanford.com. "The
key to our success over these
last 37 years has been due to
Dean. His ability to recruit
and evaluate talent at the col
lege level is the best I've ever
come across."

According to multiple
sources, replacing Stotz in
the Stanford dugout will be
Ryan Garko 'O3. Garko hit
.350 with 39 home runs and
191 RBI in his time at Stan
ford and played six seasons in
the majors for the Cleveland
Indians, San Francisco Gi
ants and Texas Rangers.
Garko last played profession
ally during the 2012 season
for the Tampa Bay Rays'
Double-A affiliate, the Mont
gomery Biscuits.
