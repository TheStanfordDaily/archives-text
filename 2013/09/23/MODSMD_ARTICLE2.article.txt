# STATEMENT WIN
## CARD STARTS STRONG, HOLDS ON FOR 14-POINT PAC-12 WIN 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Though Saturday proved to be a tale of
two halves, Stanford made a big statement
under the national spotlight after two con
vincing but unremarkable wins to start the
season.

In front of a sold-out crowd of 50,424
fans at Stanford Stadium, the No. 5 Cardi
nal (3-0, 1-0 Pac-12) defeated No. 23 Ari
zona State (2-1, 0-1) 42-28 in its first con
ference matchup of the season and the
weekend's only matchup between ranked
college football teams. After jumping out
to a 29-0 lead at the half, the Cardinal re
leased its foot from the gas pedal â€”junior
starting quarterback Kevin Hogan was
pulled out of the game early in the fourth

quarter before coming back on the final
drive and allowed the Sun Devils to
score four touchdowns, three of which
came in the fourth quarter.

Still, for the first time all season, Stan
ford showed how dominant it could be on
both sides of the ball when playing up to its
potential.

"I'm not going to apologize for winning
a football game," said head coach David
Shaw. "I could care less about style points;
I could care less about what it looks like.
We played one great half and a solid third

quarter and a bad fourth quarter. That's
bottom line. I didn't give the guys fire and
brimstone out there. There are teachable
moments."

"There was definitely a little bit of a
feeling of a little bit of disappointment,"
added fifth-year defensive end Ben Gard
ner. "We celebrate all wins, and we're glad
we got this one. But we've got to take a lit
tle more pride in playing our style of foot
ball, no matter what the situation."
Fifth-year defensive end Josh Mauro
made the first big play of the afternoon
when he intercepted ASU quarterback
Taylor Kelly on third-and-9. Three players
later, Hogan connected with junior wide
receiver iy Montgomery on a bubble
