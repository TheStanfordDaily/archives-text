# STATEMENT WIN
## CARD STARTS STRONG, HOLDS ON FOR 14-POINT PAC-12 WIN 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Though Saturday proved to be a tale of
two halves, Stanford made a big statement
under the national spotlight after two con
vincing but unremarkable wins to start the
season.

In front of a sold-out crowd of 50,424
fans at Stanford Stadium, the No. 5 Cardi
nal (3-0, 1-0 Pac-12) defeated No. 23 Ari
zona State (2-1, 0-1) 42-28 in its first con
ference matchup of the season and the
weekend's only matchup between ranked
college football teams. After jumping out
to a 29-0 lead at the half, the Cardinal re
leased its foot from the gas pedal —junior
starting quarterback Kevin Hogan was
pulled out of the game early in the fourth

quarter before coming back on the final
drive and allowed the Sun Devils to
score four touchdowns, three of which
came in the fourth quarter.

Still, for the first time all season, Stan
ford showed how dominant it could be on
both sides of the ball when playing up to its
potential.

"I'm not going to apologize for winning
a football game," said head coach David
Shaw. "I could care less about style points;
I could care less about what it looks like.
We played one great half and a solid third

quarter and a bad fourth quarter. That's
bottom line. I didn't give the guys fire and
brimstone out there. There are teachable
moments."

"There was definitely a little bit of a
feeling of a little bit of disappointment,"
added fifth-year defensive end Ben Gard
ner. "We celebrate all wins, and we're glad
we got this one. But we've got to take a lit
tle more pride in playing our style of foot
ball, no matter what the situation."
Fifth-year defensive end Josh Mauro
made the first big play of the afternoon
when he intercepted ASU quarterback
Taylor Kelly on third-and-9. Three players
later, Hogan connected with junior wide
receiver iy Montgomery on a bubble

screen for a 17-yard touchdown for the
first points of the contest.
From there, the Cardinal offense
kept on rolling and points kept on com
ing. Touchdown runs by senior half
backs Tyler Gaffney and Anthony Wilk
erson were followed by another 30-yard
touchdown reception by Montgomery,
who would finish the game with four
catches for 62 yards and a pair of touch
downs.

"The biggest thing for us is we want
to be diverse," Shaw said. "You saw the
play with Kelsey Young and iy and De
von [Cajuste] making plays down the
field. You saw us spread it out and run
it, spread it out and pack it in and throw
it... I'd love to see if anybody in the na
tion is playing as many guys as we are.
Talking about playing five receivers
and three tight ends, and seven or eight
offensive linemen and three backs and
three fullbacks. That's our goal: to be as
deep as we can be and as diverse as we
can be."

Meanwhile, the Cardinal defense
wasn't at all fazed by the Kelly-led, up
tempo spread offense. In addition to
punting four times in the first half, ASU
threw an interception, missed a field
goal and conceded a safety. Fifth-year
senior inside linebacker Shayne Skov
who would record his first sack of
the season in the fourth quarter and
junior cornerback Wayne Lyons led the
way with nine tackles apiece for the
game, and the defensive unit as a whole
racked up 10 tackles for loss and three
sacks. Stepping up in place of the in
jured Barry Browning, senior defen
sive back Devon Carrington also came
through with two pass breakups and
five total tackles.

Stanford dominated in all three
phases of the game early on. Through
the first two quarters, the Cardinal
more than doubled the Sun Devils' of
fensive production while also limiting
their running game to seven yards. And
the breakthrough on special teams
came when Stanford blocked a punt for
a safety Gardner also blocked a Kel
ly punt for a safety that handed the
Cardinal a comfortable 29-0 lead head
ing into halftime.

"I think it was just the front seven
and back end working together like we
know we can, like we've shown we can
in the past," Gardner said. "We were
able to get a lot of pressure on ASU up
front. That's because we were able to
shut down the run early. The first half,
it seemed like everything was clicking."
The start of the third quarter
proved to be an omen for the fourth
quarter disaster, as a 2-yard touchdown
run by ASU running back Marion Grice
capped a six-play, 75-yard drive that in
jected new life into the Sun Devils of
fense. The Cardinal offense tacked on
10 more points Gaffney scored on a
16-yard scamper for his second touch
down of the day before the third
quarter ended to extend its lead to 39-7,
but just when it seemed that Stanford
had the game all wrapped up, Shaw
pulled Hogan out and put in his backup,
junior quarterback Evan Crower, with
over 14 minutes left in the game. The
consequence: back-to-back three-and
outs on six straight runs that took less
than four minutes off the clock.

The Sun Devils offense then caught
fire at the right time. Kelly found tight
end Chris Coyle on a 45-yard touch
down strike to get things started in the

fourth quarter and then cut the deficit
to 18 by hooking up with wide receiver
Jaelen Strong for a 27-yard score. Both
of those drives took fewer than 90 sec
onds, and though ASU's next scoring
possession took just a little longer, a
comeback went from unlikely to proba
ble when Kelly connected with Grice on
third-and-goal for a 6-yard touchdown.
With 6:18 still left in the game plen
ty of time for the explosive Sun Devils
offense to turn defensive stops into
quick points Stanford's 32-point lead
had vanished into a tenuous 11-point
advantage.

"We're going back to our mantra,
playing 60 minutes of Stanford foot
ball," Shaw said, "and today we played
about 40."

Following the two ugly series
plagued by missed blocks with Crower
under center, Hogan was finally put
back into the game to stop the bleeding.
The junior did just that when he fooled
everyone on a 27-yard quarterback
keeper to convert a second-and-17.
Williamson then made a 24-yard chip
shot to give Stanford a 42-28 lead. Four
plays later, Cardinal fans could finally
breathe a sigh of relief when sopho
more cornerback Alex Carter ended
the game with his first career intercep
tion.

"We just found away to finish, and
I'm glad we did," Montgomery said.
Stanford continues Pac-12 play
when it travels to Seattle next weekend
to take on Washington State at Centu
ry Link Field. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. on
ESPN.

drive and allowed the Sun Devils to
score four touchdowns, three of which
came in the fourth quarter.

Still, for the first time all season, Stan
ford showed how dominant it could be on
both sides of the ball when playing up to its
potential.

"I'm not going to apologize for winning
a football game," said head coach David
Shaw. "I could care less about style points;
I could care less about what it looks like.
We played one great half and a solid third

quarter and a bad fourth quarter. That's
bottom line. I didn't give the guys fire and
brimstone out there. There are teachable
moments."

"There was definitely a little bit of a
feeling of a little bit of disappointment,"
added fifth-year defensive end Ben Gard
ner. "We celebrate all wins, and we're glad
we got this one. But we've got to take a lit
tle more pride in playing our style of foot
ball, no matter what the situation."

screen for a 17-yard touchdown for the
first points of the contest.
From there, the Cardinal offense
kept on rolling and points kept on com
ing. Touchdown runs by senior half
backs Tyler Gaffney and Anthony Wilk
erson were followed by another 30-yard
touchdown reception by Montgomery,
who would finish the game with four
catches for 62 yards and a pair of touch
downs.

"The biggest thing for us is we want
to be diverse," Shaw said. "You saw the
play with Kelsey Young and iy and De
von [Cajuste] making plays down the
field. You saw us spread it out and run
it, spread it out and pack it in and throw
it... I'd love to see if anybody in the na
tion is playing as many guys as we are.
Talking about playing five receivers
and three tight ends, and seven or eight
offensive linemen and three backs and
three fullbacks. That's our goal: to be as
deep as we can be and as diverse as we
can be."

Meanwhile, the Cardinal defense
wasn't at all fazed by the Kelly-led, up
tempo spread offense. In addition to
punting four times in the first half, ASU
threw an interception, missed a field
goal and conceded a safety. Fifth-year
senior inside linebacker Shayne Skov
who would record his first sack of
the season in the fourth quarter and
junior cornerback Wayne Lyons led the
way with nine tackles apiece for the
game, and the defensive unit as a whole
racked up 10 tackles for loss and three
sacks. Stepping up in place of the in
jured Barry Browning, senior defen
sive back Devon Carrington also came
through with two pass breakups and
five total tackles.

Stanford dominated in all three
phases of the game early on. Through
the first two quarters, the Cardinal
more than doubled the Sun Devils' of
fensive production while also limiting
their running game to seven yards. And
the breakthrough on special teams
came when Stanford blocked a punt for
a safety Gardner also blocked a Kel
ly punt for a safety that handed the
Cardinal a comfortable 29-0 lead head
ing into halftime.

"I think it was just the front seven
and back end working together like we
know we can, like we've shown we can
in the past," Gardner said. "We were
able to get a lot of pressure on ASU up
front. That's because we were able to
shut down the run early. The first half,
it seemed like everything was clicking."
The start of the third quarter
proved to be an omen for the fourth
quarter disaster, as a 2-yard touchdown
run by ASU running back Marion Grice
capped a six-play, 75-yard drive that in
jected new life into the Sun Devils of
fense. The Cardinal offense tacked on
10 more points Gaffney scored on a
16-yard scamper for his second touch
down of the day before the third
quarter ended to extend its lead to 39-7,
but just when it seemed that Stanford
had the game all wrapped up, Shaw
pulled Hogan out and put in his backup,
junior quarterback Evan Crower, with
over 14 minutes left in the game. The
consequence: back-to-back three-and
outs on six straight runs that took less
than four minutes off the clock.

The Sun Devils offense then caught
fire at the right time. Kelly found tight
end Chris Coyle on a 45-yard touch
down strike to get things started in the

fourth quarter and then cut the deficit
to 18 by hooking up with wide receiver
Jaelen Strong for a 27-yard score. Both
of those drives took fewer than 90 sec
onds, and though ASU's next scoring
possession took just a little longer, a
comeback went from unlikely to proba
ble when Kelly connected with Grice on
third-and-goal for a 6-yard touchdown.
With 6:18 still left in the game plen
ty of time for the explosive Sun Devils
offense to turn defensive stops into
quick points Stanford's 32-point lead
had vanished into a tenuous 11-point
advantage.

"We're going back to our mantra,
playing 60 minutes of Stanford foot
ball," Shaw said, "and today we played
about 40."

Following the two ugly series
plagued by missed blocks with Crower
under center, Hogan was finally put
back into the game to stop the bleeding.
The junior did just that when he fooled
everyone on a 27-yard quarterback
keeper to convert a second-and-17.
Williamson then made a 24-yard chip
shot to give Stanford a 42-28 lead. Four
plays later, Cardinal fans could finally
breathe a sigh of relief when sopho
more cornerback Alex Carter ended
the game with his first career intercep
tion.

"We just found away to finish, and
I'm glad we did," Montgomery said.
Stanford continues Pac-12 play
when it travels to Seattle next weekend
to take on Washington State at Centu
ry Link Field. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. on

Junior cornerback Wayne Lyons (above) leads Stanford with four
tackles for loss through three games. The junior's aggressive play
has been key in the Card's perfect start.
Though Saturday proved to be a tale of
two halves, Stanford made a big statement
under the national spotlight after two con
vincing but unremarkable wins to start the
season.

In front of a sold-out crowd of 50,424
fans at Stanford Stadium, the No. 5 Cardi
nal (3-0, 1-0 Pac-12) defeated No. 23 Ari
zona State (2-1, 0-1) 42-28 in its first con
ference matchup of the season and the
weekend's only matchup between ranked
college football teams. After jumping out
to a 29-0 lead at the half, the Cardinal re
leased its foot from the gas pedal —junior
starting quarterback Kevin Hogan was
pulled out of the game early in the fourth

quarter before coming back on the final
drive and allowed the Sun Devils to
score four touchdowns, three of which
came in the fourth quarter.
