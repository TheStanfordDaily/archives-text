# Cardinal Care costs increase
## Grad and international students cry foul at waiver deadline 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The latest increase in the cost of Cardinal Care
and the University's refusal to delay a waiver deadline
that would preclude students from using California's
new health insurance exchange to find cheaper insurance
was met with discontent among graduate and interna
tional students while also prompting efforts on their part
to mitigate the burden.

The cost of Cardinal Care for this academic year to
tals $3,968, an increase of 9.3 percent from last year. The
University-offered health insurance is more expensive
than similar programs at peer institutions Harvard,
Yale and the University of California, Berkeley, charge
$3,148, $2,040 and $2,772 ($2,014 for undergraduates) re
spectively and requires students to pay annually
rather than by semester.
The University's Sep
tember 15 waiver deadline
for Cardinal Care preceded
the introduction of Californi
a's health insurance ex
change a result of the Af
fordable Care Act on Oc
tober 1, with the restriction
of choice additionally detri
mental to older graduate stu
dents who are ineligible to
stay on their parents' plan
under the new legislation.
"It doesn't add up ... 70
percent of the students on
Cardinal Care are graduate
students," said Leslie-
Bernard Joseph J.D. 'l5, who
reached out to University ad
ministrators in August over
the issue but said that he re
mained unsatisfied. "Some of
them are subsidized by the
department they're working
for, but it sounds like grad
students are soliciting signifi
cantly more of the bill."
According to Leigh Stacy,
associate director of Vaden
Health Center, roughly 8,200
students or over half the
student body are enrolled
in Cardinal Care as of the be
ginning of this month, a num
ber that has remained fairly
consistent over the past three
years. Stacy cited recent
health care reform as one fac
tor behind increased Cardi
nal Care costs.
"The mandates dictated
by reform, captured under

legislation entitled The Pa
tient Protection and Afford
able Care Act (PPACA), are
complex," Stacy wrote in a
statement to The Daily. "Al
though PPACA implies cost
savings, in reality many of
the mandated changes have
imposed new costs. This is
not surprising when you con
sider that the goal of reform
includes extending health in
surance to many people who
did not previously have it and
improving access to care."
A petition drafted by
Adam Sieff J.D. 'l4 and circu
lated through the graduate
student community calls on
the University to either offer
Cardinal Care as a month-to
month plan that students
could opt out of after they ob
tain coverage through the ex
changes, offer alternative
cost/coverage Cardinal Care
bundles or delay the opt-out
deadline so that students
don't have to provide proof of
insurance until after the ex
changes open.

"Professional school stu
dents ... are the most serious
ly affected," Sieff wrote in a
statement to The Daily. "In
the law school alone, I'd say
that's about 20-30 percent (or
100-150) of students, but it
could easily be more. Univer
sity-wide I expect it's a not
insignificant figure."
By Sept. 3 Sieff's petition
collected 112 signatures.

The increased cost of Car
dinal Care also sparked dis
satisfaction among interna
tional students, who face an
additional complex waver
system if they want to opt out

of Cardinal Care.
"International students
are being sleepwalked, given
no primer or anything about
what health care looks like
[in] the US," saidASSU Sen
ator Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6.
"When I first came here, I
had no idea that I could take
a different health care [op
tion]. I just assumed that it
was something attached to
our tuition."

While Stacy said that
Yaden has no plans to change
insurance policies for this
school year, she noted that an
effort to "actively seek feed
back from students about
ways in which they can miti
gate some of the expenses as
sociated with health care cov
erage" began in late spring
and will continue this fall,
with focus groups, workshops
and a campus-wide survey.
For now, students have
collaborated to spread
awareness about Cardinal
Care's drawbacks and have
shared resources to find al
ternative health care plans.
"I posted [my research
and resources] on the law
student Facebook group, and
later got a bunch of emails
saying, 'Thanks, I saved a
bunch of money,"' Joseph
noted.

"I hope we can inform
students so that they can
make meaningful choices
and navigate a tricky situa
tion," Sieff said. "Student
health insurance shouldn't be
a black box or a money trap."

Health Center, roughly 8,200
students or over half the
student body are enrolled
in Cardinal Care as of the be
ginning of this month, a num
ber that has remained fairly
consistent over the past three
years. Stacy cited recent
health care reform as one fac
tor behind increased Cardi
nal Care costs.
"The mandates dictated
by reform, captured under

legislation entitled The Pa
tient Protection and Afford
able Care Act (PPACA), are
complex," Stacy wrote in a
statement to The Daily. "Al
though PPACA implies cost
savings, in reality many of
the mandated changes have
imposed new costs. This is
not surprising when you con
sider that the goal of reform
includes extending health in
surance to many people who
did not previously have it and
improving access to care."
A petition drafted by
Adam Sieff J.D. 'l4 and circu
lated through the graduate
student community calls on
the University to either offer
Cardinal Care as a month-to
month plan that students
could opt out of after they ob
tain coverage through the ex
changes, offer alternative
cost/coverage Cardinal Care
bundles or delay the opt-out
deadline so that students
don't have to provide proof of
insurance until after the ex
changes open.

"Professional school stu
dents ... are the most serious
ly affected," Sieff wrote in a
statement to The Daily. "In
the law school alone, I'd say
that's about 20-30 percent (or
100-150) of students, but it
could easily be more. Univer
sity-wide I expect it's a not
insignificant figure."
By Sept. 3 Sieff's petition
collected 112 signatures.

The increased cost of Car
dinal Care also sparked dis
satisfaction among interna
tional students, who face an
additional complex waver
system if they want to opt out

of Cardinal Care.
"International students
are being sleepwalked, given
no primer or anything about
what health care looks like
[in] the US," saidASSU Sen
ator Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6.
"When I first came here, I
had no idea that I could take
a different health care [op
tion]. I just assumed that it
was something attached to
our tuition."

While Stacy said that
Yaden has no plans to change
insurance policies for this
school year, she noted that an
effort to "actively seek feed
back from students about
ways in which they can miti
gate some of the expenses as
sociated with health care cov
erage" began in late spring
and will continue this fall,
with focus groups, workshops
and a campus-wide survey.
For now, students have
collaborated to spread
awareness about Cardinal
Care's drawbacks and have
shared resources to find al
ternative health care plans.
"I posted [my research
and resources] on the law
student Facebook group, and
later got a bunch of emails
saying, 'Thanks, I saved a
bunch of money,"' Joseph
noted.

"I hope we can inform
students so that they can
make meaningful choices
and navigate a tricky situa
tion," Sieff said. "Student
health insurance shouldn't be
a black box or a money trap."
