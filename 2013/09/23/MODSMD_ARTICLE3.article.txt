# Cardinal Care costs increase
## Grad and international students cry foul at waiver deadline 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The latest increase in the cost of Cardinal Care
and the University's refusal to delay a waiver deadline
that would preclude students from using California's
new health insurance exchange to find cheaper insurance
was met with discontent among graduate and interna
tional students while also prompting efforts on their part
to mitigate the burden.

The cost of Cardinal Care for this academic year to
tals $3,968, an increase of 9.3 percent from last year. The
University-offered health insurance is more expensive
than similar programs at peer institutions Harvard,
Yale and the University of California, Berkeley, charge
$3,148, $2,040 and $2,772 ($2,014 for undergraduates) re
spectively and requires students to pay annually
