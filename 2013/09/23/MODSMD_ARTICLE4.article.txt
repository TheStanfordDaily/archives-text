## Hackers breach SUNet database over summer 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Investigations on the full extent and severity of an
"apparent breach" on Stanford's information systems in
frastructure over the summer continue this fall. All
SUNet ID holders were compelled to change their ac
count passwords after the discovery and were advised to
remain vigilant across all devices and to adopt a number
of enhanced precautionary measures while online.
The breach was launched from overseas according to
an email addressed to the entire Stanford community
from Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Fi
nancial Officer Randy Livingston. The attackers were
believed to have gained access to all Stanford SUNet ID
account usernames and a "hashed," or disguised, version
of the passwords.
While SUNet ID accounts do not provide access to
personal information such as social security numbers,
the full extent of the information accessed by the attack
ers remains unknown, according to University chief
spokesperson Lisa Lapin.
"We don't believe they've
accessed personal informa
tion, but it's not entirely
possible to see what they've
accessed," Lapin said.
The advice to change ac
count passwords was solely
a "precautionary measure,"
Livingston wrote in a state
ment to The Daily. Liv
ingston added that the at
tack resembled other recent
online intrusions against
American companies and
universities.

In order to prevent simi
lar incidences in the future,
the University has adopted
new security measures. One
of the first is a two-step au
thentication. For "critical
applications" such as Axess
or Oracle, users will be re
quired to input a second
means of identification in
addition to their usernames
and passwords.
By Aug. 19, over 3,000
SUNet account holders be
gan using this security fea
ture, Livingston stated in a
campus-wide email written
to the Stanford community.
This two-step authentica
tion is currently voluntarily
but is expected to become
mandatory soon.

In a statement to The
Daily, Livingston did not
note any additional updates
since the Aug. 19 letter.
The University is still
moving forward with fur
ther investigatory work
systems diagnostics, inten
sive activity monitoring and
working with law enforce
ment and other experts.
Livingston calls for coop
eration from users, who will
be expected to take more
personal responsibility for
security of user devices and
confidential information as
outlined in his campus-wide
email.

"It is important to recog
nize that the hackers of to
day are very sophisticated,"
Livingston wrote in a state
ment to The Daily. "We can
not assume that new proce
dures, passwords and secu
rity enhancements fully
eliminate their continued
presence."
"It may take several iter
ations of security improve
ments over some period of
time to regain confidence in
the security of the network,"
she added.
