### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Investigations on the full extent and severity of an
"apparent breach" on Stanford's information systems in
frastructure over the summer continue this fall. All
SUNet ID holders were compelled to change their ac
count passwords after the discovery and were advised to
remain vigilant across all devices and to adopt a number
of enhanced precautionary measures while online.
The breach was launched from overseas according to
an email addressed to the entire Stanford community
from Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Fi
nancial Officer Randy Livingston. The attackers were
believed to have gained access to all Stanford SUNet ID
account usernames and a "hashed," or disguised, version
of the passwords.
While SUNet ID accounts do not provide access to
personal information such as social security numbers,
the full extent of the information accessed by the attack
ers remains unknown, according to University chief
spokesperson Lisa Lapin.
