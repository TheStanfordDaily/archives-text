## Door Dash brings local food to campus Stanford grads create delivery platform for local restaurants 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
Students can now gain access to
food delivery within 45 minutes from
over 60 restaurants in Palo Alto and
Mountain View thanks to Door Dash, a
Stanford alumni-founded startup hop
ing to leverage the needs of local small
business owners and hungry clientele.
Funded by top-tier investors in the
valley, the company stands out among
other online food delivery platforms
like the recently merged Seamless and
Grub Hub by performing the deliv
eries themselves.
"When you place your order with
Seamless and Grub Hub, they send
your order to the restaurants and the
restaurants help you to deliver," said
Evan Charles Moore, MBA 'l3, co
founder of Door Dash. "Restaurants
have a hard time managing logistics
and drivers."
The four founders started working
on Door Dash last spring with the ini
tial aim to empower small business
owners with modern technology.
"We interviewed over a hundred
[small business owners]," Moore said.
"We kept on hearing this problem
about delivery where they turned
down requests to deliver their prod
ucts."
In an interview with a restaurant
owner on University Avenue, the Do
or Dash co-founders learned that
based on actual demand and the
number of drivers required to hire, it
costs $5O on average to deliver a
package from Palo Alto to Mountain
View.

To solve this problem, the four
created a quick prototype of an on
line delivery platform called PaloAl
toDelivery.com in just one afternoon
and immediately received their first
online order.
"We went and did our first order
right away," Moore said. "After that,
the next thing we knew is that we de

livered food every day."
Moore added that before joining
Y Combinator a Silicon Valley
based start-up incubator —in the
summer, the four delivered a couple
hundred orders on their own to Stan
ford.

Despite low student presence on
campus during the summer, Door-
Dash orders increased 10 times,
while the number of drivers has also
grown from four to 30 half of
whom are Stanford students.
"Now that the Stanford students
are back, we'd love to serve [them]
again and we actually expect that
number [of orders] to continue to
grow faster," said Tony Xu MBA 'l3,
cofounder of Door Dash.

According to Xu, one of the key
ways for them to keep cost down is
through crowdsourcing, which ap
proximates the delivery cost across

multiple restaurants.
"What we do is that we have a
pool of drivers who are spread across
60 restaurants and as a result we can
manage that demand a little bit bet
ter because we can pool our drivers,"
Xu said.
Door Dash drivers provide their
own car, insurance and gas. For one
hour of delivery service they are of
fered a $l4/hour rate plus extra tips.
"As long as they have their smart
phones they can work for us and they
can choose their own hours," Xu said.
According to Moore, their deliv
ery fee is sufficient to pay for driv
ers. Door Dash charges a flat rate of
$6 for delivery under $lOO and $l2
for anything above.
"It more than covers the drivers'
cost because we can do more than
one delivery
in one hour," Moore said.

Meanwhile, the provision of coor
dinated drivers makes Door Dash
popular among local restaurants.
"We actually find that it's very
easy to sell to the restaurant," said
Andy Fang 'l4, co-founder of Door-
Dash. "Restaurants are experiencing
significant increases in their rev
enue. They're promoting us on their
own."

While the company is currently
operating only in Palo Alto and
Mountain View, it's looking to expand
to a larger geographical area and to
serve the Stanford community.
"We're looking to add more
restaurants and we'd love to get
feedback the best from students
—on what kinds of restaurants
they'd like to have," Fang said.
