## Door Dash brings local food to campus Stanford grads create delivery platform for local restaurants 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
Students can now gain access to
food delivery within 45 minutes from
over 60 restaurants in Palo Alto and
Mountain View thanks to Door Dash, a
Stanford alumni-founded startup hop
ing to leverage the needs of local small
business owners and hungry clientele.
Funded by top-tier investors in the
valley, the company stands out among
other online food delivery platforms
like the recently merged Seamless and
Grub Hub by performing the deliv
eries themselves.
"When you place your order with
Seamless and Grub Hub, they send
your order to the restaurants and the
restaurants help you to deliver," said
Evan Charles Moore, MBA 'l3, co
founder of Door Dash. "Restaurants
have a hard time managing logistics
and drivers."
The four founders started working
on Door Dash last spring with the ini
tial aim to empower small business
owners with modern technology.
"We interviewed over a hundred
[small business owners]," Moore said.
"We kept on hearing this problem
about delivery where they turned
down requests to deliver their prod
ucts."
