# Snapshots from Paris
## 
### Alex Bayer 
From my window in the 16eme
arrondissement, I have a
view that looks like Paris dur
ing the day but not so much at
night. In the daylight you can see
the Seine and the poplar trees, but
at night they're folded into the
blackness and all the city lights
come on. There's a hot air balloon
that goes up and down throughout
the day, and at night it blinks green
like a UFO. One can see the lights of
the outskirts and the skyscrapers
across the river. Looking out at the
lights, while it's quiet inside, the
feeling is peaceful. Paris, though big
and sprawling, rarely feels stress
ful, even in the parts with skyscrap
ers.
Have I made Paris my own yet?
Conquered it? No, and I know I
never will. It didn't take long to
know that. The Parisians treat ex
pats with neutrality, which lets us
coexist with them and gives artists
the freedom to be creative in new
ways. But to become truly French is
another thing, a feat that an expat
can spend decades attempting to
master to no avail, and I am a little
behind, since I just mastered the
vowels. The best I can do is pretend
to be Parisian, which boils down to
being as silent as possible for as
long as possible before someone
asks you a long question and "oui"
does not work as an answer.
But today I finally found a good
cafe they are harder to find than
you think. It has just the right level
of noise, is close enough to the
street to feel a part of things, but far
back enough to not feel suffocating.
While I was writing, I looked up and
saw that I was next to the cafe my
mom and I stopped at 10 years ago,
during a previous visit. I remember
because I ordered lemonade, except
the lemonade was sparkling and
tasted like Orangina. The cafe is
right by Notre-Dame and somehow
I remembered hobos and a man
selling licorice candy on the bridge.
But I don't see anything like that
now; only tourists, except now I find
them distasteful, which I know is

wrong because I once was one of
them, and in most respects still am.
Things seemed different back then,
as they always do when you're a kid.
True to form, my few weeks in
Paris have been sprinkled with
mishaps: broken shoes, being caught
in the rain, being lost in translation,
standing on a street corner figuring
out how to open the sealed plastic
bag from the supermarket. For
every elegiac moment where I feel
mistakenly that I have become
more Parisian, there is a downpour, a
broken sole, an impatient clerk and
French homework. Today, I lost my
ticket to pick up my shoes at the cob
bler and forced him and his French
speaking partner to search the backs
of all the labels. I was so worn out by
lack of sleep and class that I couldn't
muster the energy to be profusely
apologetic, and so I paid for the
shoes, said "merci," and left. Then I
paid 10 cents for a fork because I
threw mine away by accident. After
wards, I waited on the stoop in front
of Shakespeare and Company for
the owner to come out. I'm trying to
live and work there, but she is the
gatekeeper I must appeal to first,
and she is so busy and elusive that I
feel I'm tracking down a ghost. A
flower laid at the muse's feet. But no
luck today.
At night I went to dinner in the
Latin Quarter with some friends to
celebrate someone's birthday. The
food was bad but the company was
nice, and I'm beginning to sense
that it's a common theme in Paris.
After I say goodbye, I found my
self walking alone past Notre-
Dame, all lit up and reflected in the
Seine. A girl said at dinner how of
ten she forgets she's in Paris, and
everyone had agreed, me included.
It's true; it's easy to forget
you're in Paris, because you rarely
pass through the Tuileries or the
Louvre, where Paris lives in the col
lective imagination. But as long as
there's a boulangerie and a good
cafe nearby, for all intents and pur
poses you're in the center of Paris.
Still sometimes, when I cross the

Seine on my way home, I stop to
look at the Eiffel Tower and soak in
the wind and the silence. Seeing it
in the distance like that, the center
looks as magical as it does in the
postcard, and just as aloof. I can see
why Hemingway would leave Paris
every so often so that when he came
back, he would fall in love with it
again. Writing about Henry James'
short stories about Paris, Adam
Gopnick says that "Paris is romance
itself, that is to say, approachable
but unobtainable, to be wooed but
possibly never won. And when it is
won, it suddenly turns to ashes and
absurdity in your hands."
Ah, Paris. And you, the student
wistful for the past that you never
lived. You come armed with dreams
of philosophy salons and willow
trees wilting under the rain. Be
cause you've been disappointed be
fore, you also come with the expec
tation that all of these will be
proven to be myths. But even
though I expect it's going to pounce
on me any minute, I'm not disillu
sioned yet. Not even close. I keep
waiting, and maybe next week I'll
be a cynical bugger, but for now
there is not enough to be cynical
about.
Paris is a wonderful place and
no, it is not as it was, or at least as
we imagined it was. But still there
are accordion players in the subway
and drunk young people at the cafes
and at night the Latin Quarter is
alive and lit-up. The cast is differ
ent, and the signs are fluorescent
and there are more tourists and
tourist-looking things, but altogeth
er, I don't think Hemingway or
Fitzgerald would find it off-putting.
At least, the French wouldn't. It is
what it is, they might say. Thankful
ly complaining is a French pastime,
but when you're in Paris there is lit
tle to complain about. The bridges
are too beautiful for that, and the
wine, though no longer cheap, is
everywhere.
