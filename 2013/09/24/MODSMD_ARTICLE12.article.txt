## O.T. THRILLER VERLOO'S HAT TRICK KEYS LATE STANFORD COMEBACK 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
Even championship teams sur
vive scares and close calls en
route to success. That was cer
tainly the case for the No. 2 Car
dinal women's soccer team (7-0-1)
as it battled back through two
overtimes to edge past No. 22
Santa Clara (4-3-1) by a score of
3-2 and remain undefeated head
ing into conference play.
Although much has been made
of junior forward Taylor Uhl's
fantastic start to the season, Sun
day night certainly belonged to
fifth-year senior forward Court
ney Verloo. The Oregon native did
it all for the Cardinal, earning a
hat trick to account for all three of
Stanford's goals for the night. In
doing so, she more than doubled
her season total from two goals to
five, while connecting with the
back of the net on all three of her
shots on goal.
Verloo started the scoring
quickly for the Cardinal with a
free kick in the second minute of
the game. The ball ricocheted off
of the left post and into the net to
give the Cardinal a 1-0 lead before
the 3,200-plus fans at Santa Clara
had even settled into their seats.
The Broncos battled back
quickly, however, as senior mid
fielder Julie Johnston took advan
tage of a miscommunication be
tween Stanford's freshman goal
keeper Jane Campbell and her
defense in the 29th minute. The
glitch resulted in a failed attempt

at clearing the ball, allowing
Johnston to easily power through
the out-of-position Cardinal de
fenders and knot the game up at
one goal apiece.
After a standstill throughout
most of the second half, Santa
Clara broke ahead in the 83rd
minute as forward Sofia Huerta
took advantage of another
missed clear and rocketed the ball
into the left corner of the net.
With that, the Broncos were up 2-
1 with just over seven minutes re
maining in the match.
While it looked like the Cardi
nal was going to suffer defeat at
the hands of Santa Clara for the
first time in nine years, the
women from the Farm were not
willing to accept anything short of
a win.
With just one minute left in
regulation, freshman defender
Maddie Bauer was fouled from
behind, bringing up Verloo al
ready responsible for Stanford's
first goal of the evening for the
penalty kick.
With just 54 seconds left, Ver
loo bamboozled Broncos sopho
more goalkeeper Andi Tostanos
ki, easily finding the back of the
right side of the net to force the
game into overtime.
It was only fitting that 18 min
utes later it was Verloo who
stepped up to the line to attempt a
free kick in double overtime. The
forward who had kept the Cardi
nal in the game would be the one
