# STANFORD IN THE NFL
## LUCK BEATS HARBAUGH 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Some games mean more than
others. For Indianapolis Colts
quarterback Andrew Luck 'l2,
Sunday's matchup against the
49ers was one of those important
games.
After being coached by Jim
Harbaugh for three years at Stan
ford, Luck defeated his former
coach in their first matchup
against one another, with the Colts
prevailing 27-7 over the 49ers in
San Francisco.
"I know he's grinning from ear
to ear," Colts coach Chuck Pagano
told ESPN. "I've never seen him
smile the way he was smiling after
this one."
Luck's numbers may have been
rather modest (18-of-27 for 164
yards), but his play was outstand
ing as he led the Colts to victory on
the road against the defending
NFC champion San Francisco
49ers, who entered the game as 10-
point favorites. Luck took advan
tage of strong running performanc
es from backs Ahmad Bradshaw
and Trent Richardson and executed
the offense to perfection, sealing
the victory with a 6-yard touch
down run in the fourth quarter. His
emphatic spike after the run re
vealed just how meaningful this win
was for the Colts and for Luck.
After falling to the Dolphins at
home last week, the Colts desper
ately searched for their winning
formula and found it through a bal
anced running attack and preci
sion passes from Luck. In an offen
sive display that seemed eerily
similar to that of a Stanford per
formance (164 yards passing, 179
yards rushing), no play revealed

the similarity more than Luck's 6-
yard run to cap the game. Luck
faked a handoff and ran a bootleg
out to the left side, running in for
the easy touchdown. Just a day

earlier, Cardinal quarterback
Kevin Hogan ran a very similar
bootleg play out to the left side for
a big gain and an important third
down conversion that essentially

iced the game for Stanford.
Luck and Harbaugh were not
the only players or coaches in ac
tion with Cardinal connections. A
combined total of seven players
from both of the teams played col
lege football for Stanford. For the
49ers, these included Owen Mare
cic 'll, Alex Debniak 'l2 (injured
reserve) and Michael Thomas 'l2
(practice squad). Along with Luck,
Coby Fleener 'll, Griff Whalen 'l2
and Delano Howell 'l2 represent
ed the Cardinal as former Stan
ford players on the Colts roster.
A number of former coaches
from Harbaugh's staff at Stanford,
including Greg Roman and Vic
Fangio, also coached for the 49ers.
Pep Hamilton, the Colts offensive
coordinator, served in the same po
sition for the Cardinal for two
years under David Shaw before ac
cepting the Colts job this season.
Owen Marecic was participat
ing in his first game for the 49ers
after being signed earlier in the
week.

In other Cardinal news, former
Stanford tight end Levine Toilolo
'l3 caught his first career touch
down pass for the Atlanta Falcons
on a 2-yard throw from quarter
back Matt Ryan. Toilolo's score put
the Falcons up 20-10 in a game that
they eventually lost 27-23.
In addition, former Cardinal
wide receiver Doug Baldwin
recorded a 35-yard touchdown
pass in the Seattle Seahawks' 45-17
rout of the Jacksonville Jaguars.
The touchdown catch was Bald
win's first of the season and eighth
of his career.
