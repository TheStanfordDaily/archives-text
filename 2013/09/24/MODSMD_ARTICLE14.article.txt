# Breaking down the first Stanford score
## 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In last Saturday's Stanford-
Arizona State football game, No. 5
Stanford pounded then-No. 23 Ari
zona State, solidifying its status as
a national championship contender.
The Cardinal set the tone early by
pummeling the Sun Devils at the
line of scrimmage and led 29-0 at
the half before cruising to a 42-28
victory. Stanford opened the scor
ing with a lovely tunnel screen pass
to explosive junior wide receiver
Ty Montgomery, a play that exem

plified the smooth execution of the
Stanford offense.
Stanford was facing third-and
-10 at the Arizona State 17-yard
line and needed to get a first down.
The Sun Devils dropped five defen
sive backs to the first-down line,
which opened up large spaces up
front for short throws. Taking
what the defense gave, head coach
David Shaw and his play-calling
team called a short throw: the tun
nel screen.

faked its most 端biquitous
run play, "power." Right
guard Kevin Danser pulled
from the formation (outlined
in blue), ostensibly leading
the way for running back
Tyler Gaffney (R). Because
defensive players are trained
to recognize visual cues such
as a pulling guard, the play
action deception was a suc
cess; it caused Arizona State's
front six to focus on Gaffney.
Even without actually block

ing anyone, Stanford opened
up the middle of the field, and
Montgomery could then run
wild.

Consistent with the situa
tion, Stanford's quick passing
game got speed in space. As
soon as the play began, quar
terback Kevin Hogan threw
the ball to Montgomery (A),
whose job was to use his ex
plosiveness to get into the
end zone. Montgomery broke
inside to receive the pass
then ran downfield, where
three Stanford players were
blocking for him: receiver
Devon Cajuste (X), right
tackle Cameron Fleming
and center Khalil Wilkes.

The successful play-action
gave Stanford the numbers
advantage with three
blockers against three de
fenders, Arizona State had
no answer for Montgomery.
Stanford's big linemen
and the 6-foot-4, 228-pound
Cajuste had a clear physical
advantage over the smaller
ASU defensive backs (F/S,
N, and C). With both num
bers and size on their side,
the Cardinal players mauled
their opponents, accomplish
ing that rarest of football
feats, a "chalkboard play"
a precious moment in which
the action unfolds exactly as
it was designed to and every

player does his job because
he is both in position to make
his play and physically capa
ble of making that play.
By this point, scoring was
a foregone conclusion: Mont
gomery flew into the end
zone, giving Stanford a lead
that it would not relinquish.
With advantages both in
physical strength and
schematic efficiency, Stan
ford's play illustrated the
seamless execution that
characterized the Cardinal's
first-half annihilation of Ari
zona State.
