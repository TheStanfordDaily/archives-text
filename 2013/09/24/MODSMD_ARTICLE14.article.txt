# Breaking down the first Stanford score
## 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In last Saturday's Stanford-
Arizona State football game, No. 5
Stanford pounded then-No. 23 Ari
zona State, solidifying its status as
a national championship contender.
The Cardinal set the tone early by
pummeling the Sun Devils at the
line of scrimmage and led 29-0 at
the half before cruising to a 42-28
victory. Stanford opened the scor
ing with a lovely tunnel screen pass
to explosive junior wide receiver
Ty Montgomery, a play that exem

plified the smooth execution of the
Stanford offense.
Stanford was facing third-and
-10 at the Arizona State 17-yard
line and needed to get a first down.
The Sun Devils dropped five defen
sive backs to the first-down line,
which opened up large spaces up
front for short throws. Taking
what the defense gave, head coach
David Shaw and his play-calling
team called a short throw: the tun
nel screen.
To set the play up, Stanford
