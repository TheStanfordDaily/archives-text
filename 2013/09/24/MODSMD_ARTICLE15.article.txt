# Fall quarter is for football game days
## 
### Ashley Westhem 
Coming into college I had al
ready decided that I could
not and would not go
abroad in the fall for the
sole reason that I love col
lege football. Yes, that's a silly reason,
but everyone gets to make of his col
lege experience what he wants, and
that's what I wanted (and still want).
I grew up my whole life watching
football games surrounded by my par
ents and their Mends, often being the
youngest kid there. I never minded
and it just meant that there were more
people to explain the game to me ear
ly on.
It wasn't until I went to my first
game in Stanford Stadium as a stu
dent that I realized how special it is to
be cheering on a team that represents
my school and to know some of the
players. It's a completely different ex
perience that you can only have as a
student and only for four years (or
maybe a little bit more, seeing as most
of us never want to leave the Fhrm).
So that's why I will not sacrifice a
football season, even to study abroad.
This especially holds true now since
our team is so good. I'm sure students
during the pre-Harbaugh era couldn't
have cared less if they missed a sea
son. But right now; we are experienc
ing prime-time Stanford football and
possibly tracking a national title run
(knock on wood; I don't want to jinx it).

I think most students share my
sentiments if the turnout at the last
two games is any indication. Even
when the threat of more rain was on
everyone's minds, the Red Zone was
packed last Saturday True, the non
die-hard football fans left at halftime,
when the Card was blowing out Ari
zona State 29-0, but at least they
showed then- support. I think the fact
that many left early just proves how
much confidence the students now
have that the program will finish out
strong.
In July season tickets sold out for
the first time in University history. Be
cause fans are so excited about Stan
ford football, the Department of Ath
letics would be smart to capitalize on
this and draw in as much revenue from
its top sport as possible.
But it's not just about money; it's
also about improving the fan experi
ence and giving fans an incentive to
leave the comfort of their homes to
travel to the stadium. Well, Stanford
delivered; I'm sure everyone noticed
the vast improvements made to Stan
ford Stadium over the summer.
During my Sophomore College, ti
tled the Stanford Safari, we got an in
sider's torn- of Stanford Stadium by
Ray Purpur, the deputy athletic direc
tor, and he made it clear that the goal
for the new changes to the stadium is
to benefit the fans who deal with all of
the challenges of coming to a game
I didn't realize that most adults prefer
to actually watch the game from at
home, but I guess we don't really un
derstand the inconvenience since we
live here.
Anyways, Purpur was overjoyed to
share with us the improvements that
had been made and emphasized that
the Athletics Department is working
hard to keep students and fans inter
ested in coming to the games on a reg
ular' basis. After all, there's no point in
having a great team playing in a great
stadium if no one cares to show up and
watch.
Ours is the first stadium in the
country to have an all-around, continu
ous ribbon board. It's also the first col
lege stadium to add Wi-Fi, with more
than 50 percent of the attendees using
it at any given time. What's even bet
ter (from a hungry student's perspec
tive at least) is the food. Athletics real
ly stepped up the cuisine, attempting
to draw fans in to eat a meal before
kickoff in the stadium as well as during
the game and ultimately pull in more
revenue.
So basically we have a top-five
team to cheer on and an athletic de
partment dedicated to improving the
fan experience. What more could you
ask for? I certainly couldn't imagine a
better school to go to or a better envi
ronment for college football. And
that's why you'll never catch me over
seas during college football season.
