# PWR to add writing specialist in CS program
## Successful pilot leads to expansion in program 
### KYLIE JUE 
After a successful pilot in the
2012-13 academic year, the Pro
gram of Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) will continue its writing spe
cialist program with an added ex
pert for the computer science de
partment this year.
Nicholas Jenkins, associate pro
fessor of English and director of
PWR, said that the program
through which PWR lecturers are
placed into specific academic de
partments was prompted by the
Study of Undergraduate Education
at Stanford (SUES) report.
"It was a recommendation of the
SUES committee that we integrate
[PWR] more directly into the aca
demic lives of departments," Jenk
ins said. "Inside the program, we
wanted to be more closely involved
with departmental life and to sup
port students throughout the four
years of their careers of Stanford."
Last year, writing specialists
were placed into the departments of
public policy and history and also
into the Program in Human Biolo
gy. This year the program will add a
specialist in computer science be
ginning winter quarter.
"As we tried to spread out and

locate good partners in those three
different parts of the University
the sciences, the social sciences and
the humanities â€”we really have
been lucky in finding people who
can work with us," Jenkins said.
"It's really important for us to try
and give as much direct help to
places that really need it and that
are significant for the entire Uni
versity."
The writing specialists do not
teach courses within the depart
ments. Instead, they work with fac
ulty to develop goals for undergrad
uates, come up with good wilting
assignments, train teaching assis
tants, hold office hours and help
students with their communication
skills.
"There are very different goals
in different departments for what
good, effective communication is,"
Jenkins said. "The writing special
ists in each department work with
the faculty...to come up with an
agenda that fits the department's
needs."
This partnership plays a major
role in determining how the writing
specialist should function in each
department, Jenkins added.

PWR plans to continue its writing specialist program, piloted last year, through which PWR lecturers are
assigned to various academic departments to help students and TAs with specialized communication.
Katherine Preston, associate di
rector of the Program in Human
Biology, explained how writing spe
cialist Shay Brawn, who obtained
her Ph.D. from Stanford's Pro
gram in Modern Thought and Lit
erature, developed rubrics with
faculty and worked with course as
sociates, in addition to initiating
peer reviews and writing groups to
support honors students in the de
partment.
"One of the things we want to do
is just be more explicit about the
role of writing in the professional
activities that our students are go
ing to be engaging in later on,"
Preston said. "The students who
met with Shay in office hours be
fore their Writing in the Major
projects really got a lot out of it."
While some writing specialists
may be new to their specific de
partment, others, like Alyssa
O'Brien, have prior experience in
the field. O'Brien worked with
graduate students in the Public
Policy Program for several years
before becoming the department's
writing specialist.
"I hope to help students im
prove them writing and communi

cation abilities not only for the
courses they take at Stanford, but
also for their future careers in pub
lic policy," O'Brien wrote in a state
ment.
The decision to continue the
writing specialist program was
based on the positive responses
from faculty and students in the
departments where last year's pi
lot program took place, according
to Jenkins.
"I think that the fact that there
have been... long lines of people
outside the writing specialist's of
fice is a sign from the students that
they really think this is a valuable
thing," Jenkins said.
Jenkins said that the program
ultimately aims to not only pro
vide students with support from
PWR throughout their Stanford
careers but also to diversify the
academic backgrounds of PWR in
structors.
"We're limited by the resources
that we have, but the pilot has
been very successful, and I think
we're hoping that we'll be able to
continue and offer more help to
more departments as the years go
by," Jenkins said. "I really see it as
a part of our mission of continuous
support for students throughout
their four years at Stanford."
