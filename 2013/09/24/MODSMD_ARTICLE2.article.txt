# PWR to add writing specialist in CS program
## Successful pilot leads to expansion in program 
### KYLIE JUE 
After a successful pilot in the
2012-13 academic year, the Pro
gram of Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) will continue its writing spe
cialist program with an added ex
pert for the computer science de
partment this year.
Nicholas Jenkins, associate pro
fessor of English and director of
PWR, said that the program
through which PWR lecturers are
placed into specific academic de
partments was prompted by the
Study of Undergraduate Education
at Stanford (SUES) report.
"It was a recommendation of the
SUES committee that we integrate
[PWR] more directly into the aca
demic lives of departments," Jenk
ins said. "Inside the program, we
wanted to be more closely involved
with departmental life and to sup
port students throughout the four
years of their careers of Stanford."
Last year, writing specialists
were placed into the departments of
public policy and history and also
into the Program in Human Biolo
gy. This year the program will add a
specialist in computer science be
ginning winter quarter.
"As we tried to spread out and

locate good partners in those three
different parts of the University
the sciences, the social sciences and
the humanities â€”we really have
been lucky in finding people who
can work with us," Jenkins said.
"It's really important for us to try
and give as much direct help to
places that really need it and that
are significant for the entire Uni
versity."
The writing specialists do not
teach courses within the depart
ments. Instead, they work with fac
ulty to develop goals for undergrad
uates, come up with good wilting
assignments, train teaching assis
tants, hold office hours and help
students with their communication
skills.
"There are very different goals
in different departments for what
good, effective communication is,"
Jenkins said. "The writing special
ists in each department work with
the faculty...to come up with an
agenda that fits the department's
needs."
This partnership plays a major
role in determining how the writing
specialist should function in each
department, Jenkins added.
