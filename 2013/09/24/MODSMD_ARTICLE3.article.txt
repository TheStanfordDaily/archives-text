## STATIC to grow presence on and offline Queirolo reflects on the activist blog's origins, expansion plans 
### HAIMING JIN DAILY INTERN 
Stanford STATIC is looking to expand
its already-growing reach on campus with
the launch of an online activist newsfeed
and the release of two new hard-copy pub
lished journals this year.
Both a forum for people to discuss is
sues and a place for others to learn about
progressive stories, the STATIC activist
blog connects those who are passionate
about social issues. It serves as a resource
site for students looking for events, opin
ions or more general information sur
rounding a particular cause.
"We have to work together to figure
out how to reduce injustice," said Jovel
Queirolo 'l4, co-founder of STATIC.
During her freshman year, Queirolo

said she witnessed cases of injustice at
Stanford, pinpointing military organiza
tions on campus that discriminated
against students identifying as transgen
der. Queirolo felt a strong need to create a
publication that provided a platform for
students to speak out against such injus
tices.
Queirolo and Holly Fetter 'l3 M.A. 'l4
founded STATIC in the summer of 2011
after attending the Campus Progress Na
tional Conference, an event held by the
Generation Progress nonprofit organiza
tion, which supports progressive journal
ism as a means to tackle cm-rent social is
sues. At the conference, Amy Goodman, a
journalist and activist who promotes the
use of progressive solutions to social chal
lenges, inspired them to form their own
activist blog on campus.
At its inception in September 2011,
STATIC did not receive funding, and Fet
ter and Queirolo were the only two staff
members working on the blog. The follow

ing year, however, STATIC merged with
another similar campus publication called
The Stanford Progressive, which allowed
the two co-founders to receive funding
from the University to develop the blog
further. Despite the merge, STATIC kept
its name.
Since then, STATIC has grown rapidly
and effectively. Three hundred pieces of
writing have been published on the blog,
and a hard-copy journal was printed dur
ing the 2012-13 academic year. Two addi
tional journals are planned for release this
year, thanks to a recent grant from the
Generation Progress organization.
The upcoming journals are expected to
focus on compiling many of the publica
tion's more controversial and popular
pieces, with the intention to demonstrate
the close relationship between political
and personal identities.
"Something that STATIC has really
tried to do is to make political work
and political conversation very per
sonal," Queirolo said.
The blog showcases a variety of
subjects, perspectives and formats.
Contributors have talked about gay
imperialism, politics, pop culture,

art, feminism, inequality, poetry and
personal stories that cover a breadth
of topics. Articles are published at
least once a week with little restric
tion regarding length or topic, and
people can submit pieces of ait, po
ems, responses to articles, their own
articles, songs, photos or even es
says from class.
Sammie Wills 'l6 joined STATIC
during her freshman year when she
felt the need to become part of a
community that cared about the

same issues that she did, including
cultural appropriation, LGBTQ
rights and intersections of identity
issues.
"STATIC is really a place for any
one who likes to write about progres
sive or activist topics," Wills said. "We
just want to highlight the voices of
people here in our community."
As Wills describes, STATIC
serves to empower the causes of to
day as well as to memorialize those
of the past.

"STATIC is turning into an
archive of history," she said.
Currently, there are 15 staff
members who are committed to
working for STATIC and providing
suggestions to submitters.
"You do not have to be an expert
to be in STATIC," Wills said. "I un
derstand that criticism and feed
back might be scary for some peo
ple; that's why we have a team of
staff members to help support
members to getting their work to

the community."
She added that STATIC will con
tinue to have a presence offline in
the Stanford community as well, by
organizing events for activists.
"We hold events to unite the ac
tivists on campus, so that we can
build cross-community bridges and
work towards the struggle that we
all share," Wills said.
