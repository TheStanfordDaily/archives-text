## App to offer students ad space online Campus Quad organizes student event advertising on mobile devices 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
As student groups rush to print out
fliers for the upcoming activity fair, a new
campus-based mobile app created to pro
mote everything from brunch menus to
sorority rushes may soon render this flur
ry of preparation obsolete.
Founded by Frances Cairns, Campus
Quad is an iPhone- and Android-based mo
bile platform that creates a digital bill
board for students to search and share re
al-time events happening on campus.
"I think there is a giant gap between
how students use mobile technology and
how universities use mobile technologies,"
Cairns said. "My job is not just to create
another app, but to build a mobile platform
that makes it super easy for students to
connect to each other and for the universi
ty to connect to students."
Catalin Voss 'l6, StartX-affiliated inno
vator and CEO of Sension Inc., met Cairns
through mutual friends and has since been
helping bring the app to campus.
"Students are mobile; students are
moving around on campus and they want a
community that they can interact with on
campus," Voss said.
While the app is similar to Face
book in allowing students to share
photos and fliers, it also allows
school administrators to broadcast
campus events and opportunities.
"[Students] want a network that
doesn't make them feel excluded
and that does not have too much
noise of all the facets that are going
on and off campus," Voss said.
Cairns explained that 78 per
cent of Campus Quad use consists
of photographs students take in re
al time and publish to their feed.
According to Cairns, the Cam
pus Quad team has already talked
to representatives from the Career
Development Center (CDC), who
suggested that the app has the po
tential to digitalize career counsel
ing services.
"You can just talk to someone on
Campus Quad on your internship or
the things you want to do versus
everyone just rushing to career cen
ter to grab someone," Cairns said.
Representatives from the CDC
were unavailable for comment.
The idea for designing the app
first came about towards the end of
2011, when Cairns noticed the high
demand from student organizations
to promote their events.
Her platform allows students to
connect their app to multiple lines of
communication and platforms, in

eluding SMS, email and Facebook.
According to Cairns, the team also
plans to add Instagram to the list,
based on suggestions
from student focus
groups at other uni
versities.
"Involving a lot of
students has been
the core value of the
company," Cairns
said. "We are about
student success and
making ways for stu
dents to connect and
build opportunities
for them."
While the app has
been generally well
received at other uni
versities, some stu
dents have suggest
ed adding more fea
tures to the app to
suit, hrnarlpr rippHs

"The ability to buy
things has been asked
repeatedly," Cairns said. "The other
thing is that we've been repeatedly
asked to add a tab on study groups
and we'll probably do it pretty
soon."
Although the app has yet to be
fully launched, some students and
alumni believe that Campus Quad
has the potential to make a positive
impact on campus life. One such
student is Julienne Lam 'l3, opera
tions and marketing director for
Class Owl, an online social academ
ic platform.
"There is no single site where
people can find out all the things

tional forms of advertising.

"Campus Quad uses a very effi

students to create their own adver
tising on an application that can be
shared widely."
