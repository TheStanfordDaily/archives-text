## Mental health 911 calls increase A
						dramatic increase in mental health calls accompanies increases in MIPs, burglaries 
### LIAM KINNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Campus crime figures from the past three academic
years before show rising trends in mental health cases
and bicycle safety concerns as well as a decrease in alco
hol-related crimes due to greater attention from the
Stanford University Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS).

Mental health concerns
Calls to 911 concerning mental health issues rose
over time. Such cases are scenarios in which people are
committed to a hospital because it is believed that they
have become a danger to themselves or to others.
In the 2010-11 school year 27 such calls were made to
report mental health issues. The number increased to 37
cases in 2011-12 and rose to 62 in 2012-13.
According to SUDPS Chief of Police Laura Wilson
'9l, this rise in mental health-related calls does not nec
essarily correspond to a growing number of students
dealing with mental health issues.
"It could be a reflection that more people are willing
to call about someone for whom they should have called
four years ago," she said.

Greater alcohol enforcement
Regarding alcohol concerns, there was a 25 percent
drop in alcohol-related medical transportations from the
2011-12 academic year to the following one.
There were two instances during 2012-13 in which
911 was called for alcohol-related medical reasons, but
Palo Alto paramedic crews determined that the cases did
not require transport. These types of incidents occurred
nine times in 2011-12 and not at all the year before.
Further alcohol reports showed that DUIs dropped
from 16 to 7 during the period between September 2012
and April 2013. Drunk in public cases followed a similar
downward trend in the same time span, declining from
48 to 31.

Cases of minor in possession (MIP) of alcohol showed
a steep upward trend. Compared to 23 cases in 2010-11
and to 24 in 2011-12, there were 45 cases in 2012-13.
Wilson attributed these alcohol trends to an increase
