## SEEING GREEN The

### Molly Moeller 
PACIFIC GROVE, CA â€”"lf
you find yourself getting tangled in
the kelp," the commentator said
over the loudspeaker, "just relax.
The kelp floats, and you'll come
free."
I looked around at my fellow
triathletes, poised on the beach by
Lovers Point Park awaiting the
start of our 1500-meter swim. I did
n't know about them, but the hours
I'd spent training in the Stanford
pool hadn't included a kelp hazard.
There wasn't much time to worry,
though: The horn blared and we
plunged into Monterey Bay.
A dozen yards from shore, I
found myself in the thick of the kelp
bed, alternately taking a few open
water strokes and pulling myself
over the slippery brown strands.
This late in the season, the giant
marine algae are at their peak,
stretching from holdfasts anchored
to the sea floor up to the bay's sur
face, where their buoyant photo
synthetic fronds turn sunlight into
biomass.
Kelp is one of the fastest-grow
ing organisms around: The species
that hosts playful sea otters and vi
brant garibaldi fish along the Cali
fornia coast can put on a half-meter
of length in a single day. A kelp
strand can reach 80 meters in
length - about the same yardage
that Tyler Gaffney rushed for last
Saturday against Arizona State
creating a veritable underwater
forest along many cold-water coast
lines.
So it's no surprise that it's
caught the eye of biofuel prospec
tors around the globe. As marine
species that rely on buoyancy to
support their physical structure,
kelp and other brown algae are
light on the tough-to-digest struc
tural compounds like lignin and cel
lulose, which plague those trying to
efficiently convert plant biomass in
to ethanol. However, they do come
with their own unique package of
sugars that need to be converted
into machine-burnable fuel. But re
cent advances in biotechnology
which combine the genes of marine
herbivores with the fast metabo
lism of the bacterial lab rat E. coli
are boosting ethanol production
efficiency into the range of com
mercial viability.
Of course, the kelp must still be
grown in and harvested from
the sea. Because there's currently a
relatively small human demand for
kelp products, there's little eco
nomic conflict over resource use.
(By contrast, the "food vs. fuel"
competing uses of corn have caused
much head-shaking over the Unit
ed States corn-based ethanol indus
try.)
But, there's also little precedent
for producing the amount of kelp
biomass that would be needed to
make the industry a real competi
tor in the energy sector.
In Chile, Scotland, and Norway,
various firms are experimenting
with ways to grow and harvest
kelp. Essentially, they must devel
op extensive trellis systems that
can survive tempestuous seas while
the juvenile kelp embedded in their
frames put on metric tonnes of bio
mass. They also need to find ideal
locations for these kelp farms:
Goldilocks-esque situations with

nutrient-rich currents to fuel kelp
growth, shallow enough for firm
anchorage and easy retrieval, yet
out of the way of shipping lanes and
fishing grounds.
With high hopes of finding and
developing these sites, the British
government has already written
kelp biofuels into its 2050 plan for
greenhouse gas emissions reduc
tion. And researchers on the tech
nology front seem optimistic. Still,
it's difficult to know at this stage
just how large a corner of the ener
gy market kelp biofuels can cap
ture. And the downstream environ
mental impacts remain to be seen.
Any large-scale installation is
sure to affect the surrounding envi
ronment, particularly when it in
volves the growth of nutrient- and
light-thirsty seaweed. While on the
one hand, artificial kelp beds may
serve as stand-in habitat for juve
nile fish and other marine crea
tures, on the other hand, they may
also strip the water column of nu
trients critical to ecosystems fur
ther down-current.
Of course, that's the same con
cern environmentalists voice over
every new project: We can't predict
the details, but it's easy to imagine
a slough of bad outcomes. Weighing
these risks against those associated
with climate change and with
some rather nasty fossil fuel ex
traction techniques like tracking
and deep-sea drilling is a touchy
business, but it does seem like kelp
biofuel is a technology worth pursu
ing.
At any rate, I thought, as I
floundered through a particularly
dense mat of the stuff and dreamt
of climbing out of the water and on
to my bicycle, here's at least one
kelp forest that could use a trim.

There wasn't
much time to
worry, though:

and we plunged

Bay.
