TUTOR WANTED
Physics/math tutor wanted. I'm a for
mer MIT physics student who'd like
to learn more about the current state
of the field. I'm looking for a tutor to
teach 1-1 sessions for 4-5 hours per
week. (Perhaps more if it's working
well.) We'd ideally work from the
Mission in San Francisco, but I can
travel if necessary.
Requirements:
- Excellent math/physics knowledge
and understanding. (Knowledge of
other areas of science a plus.) I'm
looking to understand concepts
properly, not just to acquire raw
knowledge. You're ideally a
grad/post-grad student actively
working in the field.
- Fun personality.
Generous compensation. Please
send your resume and a description
of your favorite physics and math
books to sfbayphysics@gmail.com.
