BARBAD GOLSHIRI
"Towards an anti-theological video artwork"
Lecture in English

political critic of art. His medium varies from video, installation, photography and performance
to bande dessinnee and critical writing. Recently he creates only tomsbtones. He is also
translator and editor of Samuel Beckett's dramatic works in Persian. Most of his works are
language-based and contend with art and literature's plane of the feasible; the impossibil
ity of quitting the possible field of expression; aporia of expressing not to express. Gol
shiri has also been portrayed as a critic of the current socio-political situation in Iran, he
gemony of the new art market of the region and the living doxas.

SEPIDEH KHOSROWJAH
Interview (Mosahebeh) by Mohammad Rahmanian
Reading in Persian
Interview was first conceived in 1985 as part of a television program, intended on introduc
ing the audience to the Algerian revolution. But it was not allowed to be performed until
late January 1997 when it was staged for the first time at the annual Fajr Theater Festival.
Interview is about two young Algerians who have lived through, and participated in the
anti-colonial revolution in their country. Revolution ends in victory, but when the party is
over; these two characters have to expound upon their horrific actions and deal with their
deranged lives.
Interview has been translated into several languages. An English translation of this play,
titled Interrogation, was produced by Modern Times Theater in Canada in 2006, directed
by Soheil Parsa.
