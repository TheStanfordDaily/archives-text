## Small carbon footprint, but still too dangerous 
### Nick Ahamed 
The United States lowered its
carbon emissions by 450 mil
lion in the five years preced
ing 2012, The Economist claims.
This article and others like it (see
here and here for more examples)
all praise natural gas, produced
through hydraulic fracturing, as the
cause of said decline. They justify
this assertion by contrasting the
United States with the European
Union (EU), which has not seen
quite as dramatic of a decline.
However, what goes unmen
tioned in these articles is the mas
sive volume of carbon emitted by
the United States. According to the
Carbon Dioxide Information Analy
sis Center (CDIAC), the United

States sent more than 19 tons of
carbon per capita into the atmos
phere in 2007. Comparatively, the
EU emitted only about eight tons
per person. By 2010, the last year of
CDIAC's data, the United States
had decreased emissions by 6.8 per
cent, while the EU had reduced by
7.5 percent.
What is most remarkable, con
sidering The Economist's claims, is
that Europe realizes these greater
relative gains, despite its hesitation
to allow tracking. What can we
learn from the European model?
First, we must ask why tracking is
not promoted there. Many studies
have shown that tracking causes
several environmental problems.
Robert Jackson, a professor at
Duke University, made this argu
ment in the Proceedings of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences this
summer. His study found methane
in 82 percent of drinking water
samples taken around the Marcel
lus Shale in the American North
east. What's more shocking is that
the concentration of methane was
six times higher in samples taken
within one kilometer of fracking
sites. That statistic is even more
striking for ethane, which was 23
times higher. David Holzman's arti
cle in Environmental Health
Perspectives echoes Dr. Jackson's
findings, not to mention Josh Fox's
award-winning documentary
"Gasland."
However, for each study that
backs up these results, proponents
of fracking point to another that
contradicts it. A new study from the
University of Texas finds that frack
ing causes smaller methane leaks
than was previously estimated.
However, as The New York Times
highlights, it was sponsored by nine
petroleum companies. Beyond these
obvious biases, it seems to sweep
under the rug some of the more con
sequential environmental issues.
Take, for example, methane venting
a process used to clean and main
tain wells which is ignored by the
Texas study. Studies that do exam
ine it find that venting methane di
rectly into the atmosphere is drasti-

cally more dangerous than burning
carbon dioxide, negating the sup
posed benefits of natural gas over
coal. Looking at all direct releases of
methane during production and use,
Cornell Professor Robert Howarth
found that the shale greenhouse gas
footprint is at least 50 percent
greater than oil and 20 percent
greater than coal over 20 years.
All this being said, perhaps the
most problematic part of tracking is
the process itself; hydraulic fractur
ing uses pressurized water, sand
and a cocktail of chemicals to bust
open shale rock and allow the gas to
escape. But the chemicals that are
used like acids, detergents and
poisons are often not even
known, as they are not regulated by
federal law. The same Texas study
that argued that methane leakage is
lower than previously thought also
noted that the volume of fracking
fluid spilled is twice past projec
tions and estimated that 639,000
tons of other mechanical fluids are
leaked yearly. Proponents of frack
ing boast that 99.51 percent of the
injection fluids consist of sand and
water. Yet, each of our 20,000 wells
will use as much as five million gal
lons of water in its lifetime. That
means 490 million gallons of frack
ing fluid will be pumped into our soil
to maintain the wells we have now.
Beyond the fluids, the pressure
with which these fluids are injected
was demonstrated to cause over 100
earthquakes in the Youngstown,
Ohio, area.
Given the overwhelming evi
dence that fracking is bad for the
environment, despite its seemingly
small carbon footprint, do we then
resort back to coal? The answer
must be no. Europe consistently re
duces its emissions, relatively more
than the United States, and it is
through support for green technolo
gies and a carbon trading scheme
that they do so. Executing those
ideals is not easy, but if Europe
serves as a model, then they may of
fer better promise than fracking.

tons of other mechanical fluids are
leaked yearly. Proponents of frack
ing boast that 99.51 percent of the
injection fluids consist of sand and
water. Yet, each of our 20,000 wells
will use as much as five million gal
lons of water in its lifetime. That
means 490 million gallons of frack
ing fluid will be pumped into our soil
to maintain the wells we have now.
Beyond the fluids, the pressure
with which these fluids are injected
was demonstrated to cause over 100
earthquakes in the Youngstown,
Ohio, area.
Given the overwhelming evi
dence that fracking is bad for the
environment, despite its seemingly
small carbon footprint, do we then
resort back to coal? The answer
must be no. Europe consistently re
duces its emissions, relatively more
than the United States, and it is
through support for green technolo
gies and a carbon trading scheme
that they do so. Executing those
ideals is not easy, but if Europe
serves as a model, then they may of
fer better promise than fracking.
