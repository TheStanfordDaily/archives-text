For field hockey junior fullback
Kelsey Harbin, it is precisely this
mental tenacity as described by
the legendary Muhammad Ali above
that has allowed her to claim a spot
as this season's leading scorer, the
2012 NorPac Defensive Player of the
year and a crucial leader for this
year's Cardinal field hockey team.
"Kelsey is a competitor. She has a
very strong desire and passion for
hockey," said head coach Tara Daniel
son. "In her quest to pursue excel
lence, she really is able to limit dis
tractions and really be targeted on
the goals at hand... She's always try
ing to be the best that she can be."
"I'm a true believer that if you
work hard, and you put in the time
and the sweat, and the blood and the
tears, that it will pay off in the end,"
said Harbin. "And so that's my men
tality throughout games and prac
tices: Work as hard as you can and do
your part."
Harbin, a native of San Diego,
started playing field hockey in sixth

grade alongside basketball, which
served as her primary sport in her
childhood. In the tenth grade, howev
er, her priorities in athletics changed
when she made the U-17 national
field hockey team, traveling to
Uruguay the following summer to
play in her first international tourna
ment. It was then that Harbin real
ized her true passion for the sport of
field hockey.
"I just totally fell in love with the
sport and have been in love with it
ever since," said Harbin.
Although Harbin played center
mid throughout high school, defense
is where she has found her true call
ing as a player. She described that be
ing the furthest back in the field at
the defender position was appealing
to her because it allowed to introduce
a more cerebral element to her play,
relying on her experience and deci
sion making in the more calculative
position.
Harbin and her defense have
proven themselves a force to be reck
oned with this season, allowing only
29 shots from opponents (compared
to Stanford's 118) and 13 corners (as
compared to Stanford's 63). One of
the reasons Harbin gave for their suc
cess is the experience of the backfield,
which includes senior Anna Simmons,
junior Hannah Thiemann, sophomore
