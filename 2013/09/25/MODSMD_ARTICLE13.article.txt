For field hockey junior fullback
Kelsey Harbin, it is precisely this
mental tenacity as described by
the legendary Muhammad Ali above
that has allowed her to claim a spot
as this season's leading scorer, the
2012 NorPac Defensive Player of the
year and a crucial leader for this
year's Cardinal field hockey team.
"Kelsey is a competitor. She has a
very strong desire and passion for
hockey," said head coach Tara Daniel
son. "In her quest to pursue excel
lence, she really is able to limit dis
tractions and really be targeted on
the goals at hand... She's always try
ing to be the best that she can be."
"I'm a true believer that if you
work hard, and you put in the time
and the sweat, and the blood and the
tears, that it will pay off in the end,"
said Harbin. "And so that's my men
tality throughout games and prac
tices: Work as hard as you can and do
your part."
Harbin, a native of San Diego,
started playing field hockey in sixth

grade alongside basketball, which
served as her primary sport in her
childhood. In the tenth grade, howev
er, her priorities in athletics changed
when she made the U-17 national
field hockey team, traveling to
Uruguay the following summer to
play in her first international tourna
ment. It was then that Harbin real
ized her true passion for the sport of
field hockey.
"I just totally fell in love with the
sport and have been in love with it
ever since," said Harbin.
Although Harbin played center
mid throughout high school, defense
is where she has found her true call
ing as a player. She described that be
ing the furthest back in the field at
the defender position was appealing
to her because it allowed to introduce
a more cerebral element to her play,
relying on her experience and deci
sion making in the more calculative
position.
Harbin and her defense have
proven themselves a force to be reck
oned with this season, allowing only
29 shots from opponents (compared
to Stanford's 118) and 13 corners (as
compared to Stanford's 63). One of
the reasons Harbin gave for their suc
cess is the experience of the backfield,
which includes senior Anna Simmons,
junior Hannah Thiemann, sophomore

"We've had a couple years to re
ally work together and gel, so we
do well communicating on the field
and just knowing where each other
are going to be," said Harbin.
"We've built that over the years, so
our defense is really solid."
Although Harbin primarily
serves as the steadfast anchor of
Stanford's backfield, the element of
her game that has taken center
stage for the Cardinal team is her
ability to play offense as well. She
leads the Cardinal in goals on the
season as the striker on the Cardi
nal's offensive corners, where she
has been able to knock in all four of
her goals.
"Scoring goals is a fullback's
dream because I never really get
up there at all," said Harbin. "Be
ing able to actually get shots in the
game is super exciting for me, and

I've been lucky enough that my
teammates have set me up to put a
few in."
Although Harbin is the one
scoring the goals while keeping op
ponents off the board as a defender,
a significant element of her game
one that manifests off the field
as well as on the field is her ded
ication to her teammates and her
readiness to credit them before
herself.
"Kelsey is really a good team
player. She's not interested in hav
ing the glory for herself but pass
ing it on and sharing it with her
teammates," said Danielson. "I
think that's what makes her a spe
cial player. She's always giving to
the team and really wants to see
the team excel."
Harbin's team-first mentality is
especially evident in her leadership
on the field, where she strives to
get all of her teammates involved in
plays, regardless of whether she
has the ball or not. When she has
the ball, she is quick to distribute it
to her teammates. When she does
n't, she's acting as an organizer on
the field, making sure that all of
her teammates are in their proper
positions and helping control the
off-the-ball movement.
That ability to act as an on-field
leader, coupled with her standout
talents as both a defender and at
tacker, is what has made Kelsey
Harbin such a valuable asset for
the Cardinal field hockey team this
season.
During her time at Stanford,
Harbin has had just one overarch
ing goal in mind for herself and her
team.
"I know it sounds super simple,
but just becoming national champi
ons. When I came in my freshman
year, Stanford was top 20 but not
really ever competing with the top
teams," said Harbin. "In the next
couple years, I'm looking forward
to putting Stanford on the map as
one of the names that people fear to
play."
According to the junior, this
goal is more attainable this season
than ever before.
"In our offseasons, we have
been working harder than any
team in the country. I can guaran
tee it," said Harbin. "What's spe-

rial about our team this year is that
everyone is buying into the game
plan. This year every single person
that's on the team wants it and
wants to be a champion."
The team's hunger for a cham
pionship has certainly manifested
in the early returns from this sea
son. The Cardinal (6-1-0) moved to
No. 6 in the national poll Tuesday
morning, matching the school
record for its highest-ever national
ranking. The team is currently rid
ing a six-game winning streak, of
which the last four have been
shutouts for the Harbin-led de
fense. And if the team continues its
winning ways, there's nothing stop
ping it from being one of the most
special women's field hockey teams
ever to play for Stanford.
True to form, Harbin is quick to
attribute Stanford's success in this
promising season to her fellow Car
dinal and the team factor that uni
fies them.
"The reason that we have been
so successful at the beginning of
this season and I have, individu
ally— is because our team is so
close and actually a team," said
Harbin. "Every single person
works for the team. And I think
that's something really special
about the group this year and what
makes it possible for us to win the
national championship."
