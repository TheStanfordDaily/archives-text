# TAKE 3: HOW DOES FRONT SEVEN LOOK?
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
The Stanford defense's "Party in the
Backfield" has certainly continued in
to 2013, as the Cardinal has seven
sacks and 22 tackles for loss through
three games two of which were
played against quick-strike spread
teams. But the Stanford front seven al
so looks a bit different than it did in
2012, 'when the team finished first in
the country in sacks, second in tackles
for loss and fifth in rush defense. The
departures of starting outside line
backer Chase Thomas and his backup,
Alex Debniak, prompted James
Vaughters' switch to the position, The
team also lost defensive end Henry
Anderson for severed weeks when he
was injured against Army. We asked
football writers Winston Shi Do-Hy
oung Park and David Cohn: Is Stan
ford's early-2013 front seven better
than its late-2012 counterpart ?

Winston: Stanford's front seven has
been absolutely marvelous this year. How do
we know this? Stanford hasn't yet played a
team that was willing to consistently run the
ball up the gut. The Stanford front seven has
intimidated opponents to the point where
they don't really dare run at it or attempt
sustained pass protections. And this was re
cently shown to be warranted Stanford
controlled a respectable Arizona State offen
sive line with a three-man rush for the most
part.
Stanford's big guys have not yet been
tested, and that is by design. This goes back
to last year's Arizona game, in which the
Cardinal front seven nearly decapitated
Wildcat quarterback Matt Scott several
times in Arizona's first two drives. Panicking,
Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez eschewed
pass protection altogether and started
throwing quick screens to the outside.
Although Arizona wasn't very explosive,

Scott's accuracy and reliability allowed Ari
zona to mount long drives. When UCLA
achieved some success in the Pac-12 Cham
pionship Game with similar tactics, a lot of
people evidently thought that Rodriguez
had found the key to beating the Stanford
defense.
This year, ASU and SJSU have attempt
ed the same tactic, but neither won their
games against the Cardinal defense. As an
offensive foundation play, screens aren't
very efficient they're meant to be a com
plement to other plays. Taking a different
tack, Army's triple option actually left key
front seven players unblocked another
way to deal with, but not neutralize, a great
run defense. But from two disparate ap
proaches we can learn one key fact: If Stan
ford's front seven is forcing opponents to de
sign entire game plans around avoiding it,
that already makes it one of the finest units
in college football.
Do: Winston certainly makes a good
point by saying that the sheer fact that op
ponents are refraining from challenging the
Stanford front seven is a testament to the
respect that those programs have for the
Cardinal's defensive rotation. But I disagree
with his argument that such a trend makes
it implicit that this year's front seven is one
of the finest in college football.
I think that instead, it's actually a nod to
last season's tremendous front seven, not
the current one, that Stanford's early-2013
opponents have supposedly crafted then*
game plans to avoid running up the middle
or having to maintain consistent pass pro
tection.
Last year's front seven had an elite com
bination of strength and speed while work
ing incredibly efficiently as a unit. Shayne
Skov, Ben Gardner and Trent Murphy
would consistently explode into the back
field, and A. J. Tarpley was always reliable in
pass coverage. That was the front seven that
completely shut down the vaunted jugger
naut known as the Oregon Ducks' offense.
That front seven emerged victorious from
many an epic battle up front.
But this year's front seven, while return
ing most of the same characters, just hasn't
been tested as a unit in the same way that
last year's unit was. Entire units on teams
can change drastically from year to year
(see: Oregon State defense), and there's re
ally not any way to tell how good this year's
seven are until they face the likes of Wash
ington or UCLA.
Because of that, I'm going to side with
the unit that established itself and cemented
itself as one of the most feared crews in the
nation last year. Stanford's front seven of
2012 defined the word "elite," and, as for
this year, I won't believe it until I see it.
David: While I do not believe Stanford's
front seven in 2013 is as talented as the
group from the end of last season, the drop
off is not as significant as it may seem to
many. On one hand, defensive stalwart
Chase Thomas now a member of the At
lanta Falcons practice squad has certain
ly been missed, as his 7.5 sacks constituted
the second highest total in 2012 for the Car
dinal behind Trent Murphy's 10.
In total, the departures of Thomas, Aex
Debniak and Terrence Stephensâ€”who

the front seven has improved since 2012.
combined for nearly 22 percent of
the Card's 57 sacks from last season
has resulted in a decrease in the
front seven's percentage of sacks per
opponent pass attempts from 8.6
percent in 2012 to 6.0 percent in
2013.
However, when one considers the
front seven's production in terms of
both quarterback hurries and sacks,
its percentage of sacks and quarter
back hurries per opposing pass at
tempt has actually slightly in
creased, from 12.4 percent last year
to 12.8 percent this season.

These statistics seem to indicate
that Stanford's defensive line and
linebackers have had a comparable
amount of success in applying pres
sure on the quarterback. At the
same time, the numbers also show
that the front seven can improve on
translating such pressure into sacks
and tackles for loss by minimizing
missed tackles.
