# PAC-12 PLAY OPENS WITH CAL
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's volleyball team (7-2) en
ters Pac-12 play today with some definitive wins un
der its belt, during which it has capitalized on leads
and never let up. However, the journey has not been
completely smooth, as the Cardinal has also been
dealt its share of tough road losses.
After losing to top-10 Florida and Texas, the Car
dinal fell from the No. 4 spot to No. 8 in the NCAA
rankings. The team, however, recovered with strong
wins over Cal Poly and Saint Mary's last week. In
doing so, it jumped up one spot to No. 7 and is look
ing forward to opening the season against rival Cal.
"The road trip was good," said sophomore out
side hitter Brittany Howard. "It wasn't necessarily a
reality check, but it made us think that there are
definitely really good teams out there and if you look
at everyone's record there's not one team that's just
winning everything."
With all of his starters returning, head coach
John Dunning rightfully expected there to be strong
leadership on the court. So far, seniors Carly Wopat
and Rachel Williams have not disappointed in pro
viding momentum for the team when needed most;
in Friday night's contest, Wopat won the match point
with an ace to seal the victory against Saint Mary's.
Even so, this team is no one-trick pony. All of the
starters have contributed immensely to the team's
seven wins, and Dunning will look to all of them to
take down the Golden Bears (7-2) tonight and the
Arizona State Sun Devils (11-1) on Friday.
"I think we were definitely really excited to start
Pac-12 play especially against our rival," Howard
said. "We've done a really good job of scouting them
and knowing their tendencies, so we're kind of just
practicing playing the way they would, then on the
other side playing how we would defend them."
Williams currently leads the team with 3.17 kills
per set, with Wopat and Howard right on her heels

Senior middle blocker Carly Wopat (above) has
looked dominant on the court through the end of
nonconference play. Tonight, Wopat and the Card
turn the page to Pac-12 play with a match at Cal.
with 3.14 and 3.13, respectively.
Cal senior Adrienne Gehan,
however, ranks third in the confer
ence and 20th nationally with an
impressive 4.3 kills per set to go
along with a .327 hitting percent
age. Also leading the Bears is soph
omore Lara Vukasovic hitting .441,
with the Card's most accurate hit
ter being Wopat at .513 third in
the nation.
Doing great things for Stanford
on the defensive end is junior
libera Kyle Gilbert, who leads the
team with 4.39 digs per set. Sopho
more Inky Ajanaku and Wopat are
the team's blocking beasts with 38
blocks each on the season. And the
Card would be nowhere offensively
without sophomore Madi Bugg,
who has recorded 341 of the team's
407 sets.
Stanford is picked to finish atop

the Pac-12 again for the seventh
time in its last eight seasons, while
Cal is expected to finish seventh.
Stanford leads the overall series in
the "Big Spike" with Cal 64-12.
Friday's contest against the Sun
Devils should be a more competi
tive matchup, as No. 16 Arizona
State managed to easily break into
the top 25 by dominating from the
start in a victory. The Sun Devils
are led by sophomore Whitney Fol
lette and her .346 attack percent
age and sophomore Macey Gard
ner with her 4.94 kills per set.
"There are a lot of good teams
with ups and downs and it shows
we just need to come and bring our
best everyday and that's the way
we're gonna be successful," said
Howard.
The Cardinal travels across the
bay tonight to take on Berkeley in
the "Big Spike" at 7:30 p.m. and
then plays Arizona State at home
on Friday at 6 p.m.
