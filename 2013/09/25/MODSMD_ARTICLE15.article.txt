# PAC-12 PLAY OPENS WITH CAL
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's volleyball team (7-2) en
ters Pac-12 play today with some definitive wins un
der its belt, during which it has capitalized on leads
and never let up. However, the journey has not been
completely smooth, as the Cardinal has also been
dealt its share of tough road losses.
After losing to top-10 Florida and Texas, the Car
dinal fell from the No. 4 spot to No. 8 in the NCAA
rankings. The team, however, recovered with strong
wins over Cal Poly and Saint Mary's last week. In
doing so, it jumped up one spot to No. 7 and is look
ing forward to opening the season against rival Cal.
"The road trip was good," said sophomore out
side hitter Brittany Howard. "It wasn't necessarily a
reality check, but it made us think that there are
definitely really good teams out there and if you look
at everyone's record there's not one team that's just
winning everything."
With all of his starters returning, head coach
John Dunning rightfully expected there to be strong
leadership on the court. So far, seniors Carly Wopat
and Rachel Williams have not disappointed in pro
viding momentum for the team when needed most;
in Friday night's contest, Wopat won the match point
with an ace to seal the victory against Saint Mary's.
Even so, this team is no one-trick pony. All of the
starters have contributed immensely to the team's
seven wins, and Dunning will look to all of them to
take down the Golden Bears (7-2) tonight and the
Arizona State Sun Devils (11-1) on Friday.
"I think we were definitely really excited to start
Pac-12 play especially against our rival," Howard
said. "We've done a really good job of scouting them
and knowing their tendencies, so we're kind of just
practicing playing the way they would, then on the
other side playing how we would defend them."
Williams currently leads the team with 3.17 kills
per set, with Wopat and Howard right on her heels
