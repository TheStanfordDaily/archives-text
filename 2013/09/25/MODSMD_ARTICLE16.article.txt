# Don't quit on the injured 49ers just yet
## 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
If the media reports are to be
believed, the San Francisco
49ers have no hope of accom
plishing anything of note dur
ing this NFL season.
It appears that the last nail in
then' coffin was hammered in at ap
proximately 3:53 p.m. Pacific Stan
dard Time, when Andrew Luck
scored on a naked bootleg (easily the
most graphically named play in all of
football), strolling untouched into the
end zone. Pontificated the pundits:
The 49ers are dead. Done. Toast.
Fhbar. [lnsert synonym here.] Some
have even gone as far as to question
the decision to trade Alex Smith,
since his Kansas City Chiefs are 3-0
and at the top of their division while
the 49ers are 1-2 and have spent the
last two weeks getting collectively
rolled by the Seahawks of Seattle and
the Lucky Horseshoes of Indianapo
lis.
To which I will offer one complete
ly unambiguous response: Huh?
Back in my day all of 10 years
ago this thing we now call social
media didn't really exist. Emails used
to be big back then (it was the best of
times... it was the worst of times).
The dawn of Twitter, Facebook and
other such innovations has made the
flow of information and opinions trav-

el quite literally at the speed of light
(or much slower than that if you have
Comcast). The fact of the matter is
that it is very easy to fall into the trap
of making snap judgments on things
that really shouldn't be decided on in
the spur of the moment.
If you don't believe me, then con
sider this: How many times have you,
in the last year, heard the argument
that Player X is the greatest of all
time? How many times have you seen
an article backtracking on a previous
ly erroneous assertion? Heck, what
are the odds of me apologizing for a
totally incorrect and dumb article this
time next week? In essence, as a soci
ety, we are ever quicker to crucify and
equally quick to backtrack and say,
"My bad." As a result, we tend to
write off teams that really shouldn't
be written off.
The 49ers continue to have one of
the most loaded rosters in all of foot
ball, despite the barrage of injuries
they have suffered and the upcoming
absence of Aldon Smith as he goes
through rehab for his substance
abuse issues. They have one of the
brightest young stars in quarterback
Colin Kaepernick, who, lest we all for
get, is going through his first full year
as a starter. To expect him to produce
at the incredible level he did all of last
year on a week in, week out basis is
foolish; all young quarterbacks have
growing pains and Colin Kaepernick
will eventually right the ship.
Most importantly, the 49ers have
a strong front office and an incredible
coach in Jim Harbaugh, who would
probably rather set himself on fire
than lose three games in a row. It
bears noting that the past two years
have been remarkably short of adver
sity for the 49ers. This really marks
the first time in a long time that the
49ers have been reeling and in crisis
mode. Simple logic says that they will
return with a vengeance and regain
their contender status very, very
soon.
The New York Giants have made
an art of this kind of swoon, getting
the temperature on Tom Coughlin's
(perpetually hot) seat to near-boiling
point before uncorking a Super Bowl
winning (and job-saving) run. On the
other end of the spectrum is Har
baugh, who has seen nothing but un
precedented success since taking
over as head coach. His pearly white
28-10-1 record speaks for itself. How
ever, Coughlin has two Super Bowl
lings to his credit despite a relatively
mediocre regular season record over
the years. The TL;DR version of this
entire column? Don't write the 49ers
off. Nostraviggy proclaimeth that
they will end the year on a very suc
cessful note.

The Daily almost gave up on Vig
nesh Venkataraman after a streak
of three consecutive mediocre
columns. To remind Viggy how
lucky he was to survive the losing
streak, email kirn at viggy 'at' Stan
ford. edu.

Pontificated the
pundits: The 49ers
are dead. Done.
Toast. Fubar.
