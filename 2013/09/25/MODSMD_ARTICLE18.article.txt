## YANKEY TO MISS WSU GAME 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
David Shaw and several Cardi
nal players participated in their usu
al press conference Tuesday at
lunch, responding to a variety of
questions including some about
players' health and even Andrew
Luck.
The biggest news revealed on
the day it actually came after
practice later Tuesday was that
senior guard David Yankey will be
missing the upcoming game against
Washington State and will be re
placed by sophomore Joshua Gar
nett on the offensive line.
"David Yankey will not play this
week," Shaw said. "He has a family
situation he has to take care of. He's
in our thoughts and prayers... We
hope to get him back soon."
Yankey will be with his family for
the upcoming week, and an exact re
turn date has not been set. Shaw
and the team hope to have him back
before the Cardinal hosts Washing
ton in Stanford Stadium on Oct. 5.
In other news, senior cornerback
Barry Browning, who missed last
Saturday's game against Arizona
State due to multiple injuries, is
questionable for this Saturday's
game.
"He will practice today," said
head coach David Shaw. "He's feel
ing better. His body's working
again. We will see how he feels."
Browning's status remains of the
utmost importance for the Cardinal
due to senior safety Ed Reynolds'
first-half suspension for Saturday's
game. Reynolds was flagged for a
targeting penalty in the fourth quar
ter as his hit on Sun Devils quarter

back Taylor Kelly was deemed by of
ficials to be too high. A targeting
penalty in the second half of a game
results in an ejection from the cur
rent game and a suspension for the
first half of the next game.
With Reynolds out, senior re
serve defensive back Devon Carring
ton will take over the starting free
safety spot for the entire first half.
This could potentially leave Stanford
down two cornerbacks, as Carring
ton also is a second-string corner
back, if Browning is unable to play.
"Who knows how many passes
they will throw in the first half,"
Shaw responded when discussing
the impact of the potential losses.
Washington State's offense current
ly ranks 16th in the nation in passing
yards per game and has posted
back-to-back games of 40 or more
points.
Shaw anticipates an even louder
environment this time around as
Stanford visits Century Link Field
in Seattle, due to the number of
alumni in the city who only get to
see that one game per year. Last
year, Stanford fell to Washington 17-
13 at Century Link Field, making it
no stranger to the difficulty of play
ing there. In fact, Century Link
Field recently set the world record
for crowd-noise in a stadium when
the Seahawks hosted the 49ers.
"We have to be cautious," Shaw
said. "The noise is a factor."
In addition, Shaw believes that
Washington State's defense is se
verely underestimated. The team
ranks 13th nationally in points al
lowed per game (12), including a
shutout in their last game at home
against Idaho.
"The one thing no one talks

about ever when you're talk
ing about Mike Leach is the de
fense," Shaw said in reference to
Washington State's head coach
Mike Leach. Leach is entering his
second year as head coach and
brings a high-powered spread of
fense attack with him from his days
at Texas Tech. Leach's defenses are
rarely talked about due to the
prowess of his offensive units, but,
this year especially, the defense is
earning notice.
When asked about Andrew
Luck's bootleg run to score a 6-yard
touchdown for the Indianapolis
Colts on Sunday to essentially close
out the game against the 49ers,
Shaw said that it was exactly the
same play ran by Kevin Hogan just
a day earlier to ice the Sun Devils.
"It was the same exact play I
texted [Colts offensive coordinator]
Pep [Hamilton] this morning," Shaw
detailed. "We go through the same
thought process, which was running
the ball, getting four or five yards a
clip. And then from the box you see
it, they're crashing on the back
side."
Fifth-year senior defensive end
Ben Gardner also spoke at the press
conference and complimented many
of the young players.
"[Sophomore defensive end] Aziz
Shittu is the next guy in line," Gard
ner shared. "He's got to play mean
ingful reps for us. He's a guy who's
shown everything that we need him
to show at practice."
Stanford takes on Washington
State at 7 p.m. Saturday in Seattle
on ESPN.

When asked about Andrew
Luck's bootleg run to score a 6-yard
touchdown for the Indianapolis
Colts on Sunday to essentially close
out the game against the 49ers,
Shaw said that it was exactly the
same play ran by Kevin Hogan just
a day earlier to ice the Sun Devils.
"It was the same exact play I
texted [Colts offensive coordinator]
Pep [Hamilton] this morning," Shaw
detailed. "We go through the same
thought process, which was running
the ball, getting four or five yards a
clip. And then from the box you see
it, they're crashing on the back
side."
Fifth-year senior defensive end
Ben Gardner also spoke at the press
conference and complimented many
of the young players.
"[Sophomore defensive end] Aziz
Shittu is the next guy in line," Gard
ner shared. "He's got to play mean
ingful reps for us. He's a guy who's
shown everything that we need him
to show at practice."
Stanford takes on Washington
State at 7 p.m. Saturday in Seattle
on ESPN.
