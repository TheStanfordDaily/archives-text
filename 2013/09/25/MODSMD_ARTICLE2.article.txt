## ASSU talks new grants, funding First Senate meeting of the year announces senator resignation 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
After a busy summer that included
four emergency meetings, the 15th
Undergraduate Senate picked up
where it left off during its first meet
ing of the 2013-14 academic year eager
to start implementing new ideas, in
cluding several new grants and fund
ing opportunities.
Missing from Tuesday evening's
meeting was Senator Eilaf Osman 'l6,
who recently announced her resigna
tion from the ASSU Senate.
Senate Chair Ben Holston 'l5 de
ferred to the statement from the Sen
ate Communications committee on the
new ASSU website developed by
Senator Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6 this
summer which stated: "Today, we
announce the departure of Eilaf Os
man from the 15th Undergraduate
Senate. Eilaf was an integral part of
our team, and we wish her the best of
luck in pursuing her work with
Amnesty International and the World
Bank. The Student Life Caucus will
temporarily consist of solely Senator
Mouzykantskii."
Despite the loss of Osman, the Sen
ate is moving ahead at full speed with
its projects. Discussed bills, which will
be voted on next week, focused on find
ing more opportunities for classes to
acquire the necessary funding to put
on class and campus-wide events.
The first bill is a proposal to create
a $20,000 Class Presidents Grant,
which will give class presidents the op
portunity to apply for additional fund
ing to hold class and all-campus
events.
As of now, the class presidents are
allocated $6,000 annually from general
fees, in addition to other funds from
university departments and the tradi
tions fund a sum of $12,500 from the
ASSU endowment that funds Full
Moon on The Quad, Mausoleum
and a senior event.
The grant will be of particular
use for the class of 2014, who, in the
past, have not been able to create
an annual event, leaving the major
ity of the money to support the
sophomore and junior events. This
year, the seniors are currently try
ing to secure funds to host a senior
tailgate and viewing party for the
Oregon State football game on Oc
tober 26.
Should the bill be approved, the
allotted $20,000 will be taken from
the $llO,OOO in the General Fees
Reserve and would ensure that
each class has the adequate funds
to host well-attended events.
Holston hopes to figure out how
this event can be consistently fund
ed by the traditions fund so the
senior class can host the tailgate on
the Row every year. He noted that

the change in the traditions fund
could not be done in time for this
year because the funding needs of
the class of 2014 are too great.
Other funding ideas included a
winter event grant to increase the
amount of programming during
winter quarter and an innovation
fund suggested by ASSU Assis
tant Financial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 that
would allocate $2,000 to every Sen
ator to start implementing some of
the ideas that they ran on in their
platforms. The Senate took a straw
poll on the idea, with 10 senators
generally enthusiastic about the
fund and four senators who were
hesitant or confused.
Trusheim also brought the idea
of alcohol reimbursements back to
the senate floor, stating, "if the
Senate writes a policy, I'm happy to
begin funding alcohol out of ASSU
funded money."
Angela Zhang 'l6 and Nikos Li
odakis 'l6 from the senate appro
priations committee were both
very hesitant about developing
such a policy.

"We've had some discussions
about this, but we haven't made
any final decisions because there
are a lot of limitations to funding al
cohol," Zhang said. "The majority
sentiment is probably not, but if we
do, it will be very limited, and the
groups would have to get approval
form the University first."
Zhang mentioned that one po
tentially legitimate use of this fund
ing policy would be aiding the Jew
ish Student Association in the pur
chase of wine for religious purpos
es. The appropriations committee
also mentioned the possibility of
funding a senior cocktail party.
However, the topic is still very
much under debate.
Additional topics of discussion
included the new ASSU website
and criticisms of the high cost of
Cardinal Care for international
students. The Senate also passed
$9,216 in funding bills for the Class
of 2014 and Atheists, Humans and
Agnostics at Stanford.
