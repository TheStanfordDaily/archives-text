# SEED establishes center in Ghana
## GSB auxiliary aims to mentor local entrepreneurs in West Africa and stimulate economy 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Institute for Innovation in De
veloping Economies (SEED), an auxiliary of the
Graduate School of Business, established an in
novation center in Accra, Ghana, with the help of
a $l5O million initial grant from Dorothy and
Robert King MBA '6O.
In June, the institute sent a group of five
Stanford alumni volunteers to Ghana, who will
act as "business coaches" for the first cohort of
local entrepreneurs from that region.
SEED pursues three main areas, combining
research, education and on-the-ground work to
directly stimulate the local economy of targeted
regions in West Africa. The program intends to
train and mentor local entrepreneurs to grow
their businesses, create services that serve the
need of the poor, increase employment of local
people and thereby alleviate poverty in those
communities.
"If we look at all these countries, the largest
percentage of people living in extreme poverty
—which is defined as living under 1.25 dollars a

day are in Africa," said Hau Lee, SEED's fac
ulty director and director of research.
The Institute chose West Africa as its pilot
region for multiple reasons, including dealing
with fewer government-set obstacles that pre
vent growth and being able to establish a safe
place where students and faculty will not be at a
risk.
Lee emphasized that, although it is based in
Ghana, the center is not solely a Ghana center
but a West Africa hub for innovation. Entrepre
neurs throughout the region were encouraged to
join the workshops and mentorship opportuni
ties that SEED provided.
Because SEED's mission involves not just
consulting companies but also working with the
companies in the field, the five Stanford business
coaches who will remain in Ghana for at least
six months —were selected based on their com
petence and hands-on experience as mentors.
"We wanted people who had experience in
building businesses, particularly in the private
sector," said SEED Executive Director Tralance
Addy, who recently flew over to Ghana himself.
"We also wanted mature people who can easily

gain respect from the community, and we want
ed people with actual operational experience in
managing businesses, since they play a hands-on
role."
In addition to forming an effective team of
volunteers, SEED conducted research on the
challenges that local entrepreneurs in a specific
region face. Over the past few years, SEED has
compiled research to identify problems that pre
vented businesses from scaling, with the inten
tion of developing solutions to solve those issues.
According to Lee, one of the ways to address
the challenges is to change the mindset of the
entrepreneurs by affirming their beliefs in
building higher values and employing more peo
ple. In addition to helping the entrepreneurs
build an intact infrastructure for a sustainable
business, SEED is attempting to "bridge the
gap" between investors and entrepreneurs in
the local economy.
"Sometimes the markets are very small, and
the businesses are fragmented and they cannot
scale," Addy said, giving reasons for why Africa

is often not an attractive area for in
vestment.
"It is not a matter of the capital,
but that the capital has difficulty lo
cating the transparent business
rather than that there is no money
for the light companies," he added.
Lee and Addy hope to see more
entrepreneurs able build up their
businesses and expand their exports
in the future.
"We are trying to put these com
panies on a transformational
path,"Addy said. "The program is
now ongoing, so we know we're go
ing to learn a lot over the next few
months or few years. Most people
that attended the inaugural didn't

expect it to go as well as it was ex
pected to go, and even when there
were surprises, they are positive."
Lee reported that SEED is con
sidering expanding its reach to
Southeast Asia and Central Ameri
ca. Once these centers are set up,
SEED plans to allow Stanford stu
dents and researchers to travel to
the established sites for internships
and education. In the long term, Lee
noted, the goal of these centers to
"build capacity for research and ed
ucation needs."
"Our ultimate measure is the
transformation of lives, people who
would have found it otherwise hard
to find jobs," Addy said. "We will
know we are successful when we can
measure the transformation of actu
al lives on the ground."
