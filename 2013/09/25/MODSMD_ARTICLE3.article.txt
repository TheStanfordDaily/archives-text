# SEED establishes center in Ghana
## GSB auxiliary aims to mentor local entrepreneurs in West Africa and stimulate economy 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Institute for Innovation in De
veloping Economies (SEED), an auxiliary of the
Graduate School of Business, established an in
novation center in Accra, Ghana, with the help of
a $l5O million initial grant from Dorothy and
Robert King MBA '6O.
In June, the institute sent a group of five
Stanford alumni volunteers to Ghana, who will
act as "business coaches" for the first cohort of
local entrepreneurs from that region.
SEED pursues three main areas, combining
research, education and on-the-ground work to
directly stimulate the local economy of targeted
regions in West Africa. The program intends to
train and mentor local entrepreneurs to grow
their businesses, create services that serve the
need of the poor, increase employment of local
people and thereby alleviate poverty in those
communities.
"If we look at all these countries, the largest
percentage of people living in extreme poverty
—which is defined as living under 1.25 dollars a

day are in Africa," said Hau Lee, SEED's fac
ulty director and director of research.
The Institute chose West Africa as its pilot
region for multiple reasons, including dealing
with fewer government-set obstacles that pre
vent growth and being able to establish a safe
place where students and faculty will not be at a
risk.
Lee emphasized that, although it is based in
Ghana, the center is not solely a Ghana center
but a West Africa hub for innovation. Entrepre
neurs throughout the region were encouraged to
join the workshops and mentorship opportuni
ties that SEED provided.
Because SEED's mission involves not just
consulting companies but also working with the
companies in the field, the five Stanford business
coaches who will remain in Ghana for at least
six months —were selected based on their com
petence and hands-on experience as mentors.
"We wanted people who had experience in
building businesses, particularly in the private
sector," said SEED Executive Director Tralance
Addy, who recently flew over to Ghana himself.
"We also wanted mature people who can easily

gain respect from the community, and we want
ed people with actual operational experience in
managing businesses, since they play a hands-on
role."
In addition to forming an effective team of
volunteers, SEED conducted research on the
challenges that local entrepreneurs in a specific
region face. Over the past few years, SEED has
compiled research to identify problems that pre
vented businesses from scaling, with the inten
tion of developing solutions to solve those issues.
According to Lee, one of the ways to address
the challenges is to change the mindset of the
entrepreneurs by affirming their beliefs in
building higher values and employing more peo
ple. In addition to helping the entrepreneurs
build an intact infrastructure for a sustainable
business, SEED is attempting to "bridge the
gap" between investors and entrepreneurs in
the local economy.
"Sometimes the markets are very small, and
the businesses are fragmented and they cannot
scale," Addy said, giving reasons for why Africa
