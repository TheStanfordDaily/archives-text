## SoCo offers new classes, apps decrease 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD DESK EDITOR 
Although the number of ap
plications and students enrolled
in Sophomore College decreased
between 2012 and 2013, the
Stanford Introductory Studies
(SIS) department introduced
five new seminars for this year's
program.
A three-week summer pro
gram reserved for rising sopho
mores, the 2013 Sophomore Col
lege program accepted 488 ap
plicants with a total of 245 rising
sophomores enrolled. The 2012
program had 545 applicants and
a total of 299 students enrolled.
A representative of the Stan
ford Introductory Studies de
partment attributed the de
crease in applicants to the small
er number of courses offered in
total this year. While last year's
Sophomore College boasted a
selection of 22 seminars, this
year's selection included 18,
even with the newly created of
ferings.
One of the new 2013 semi
nars, In the Age of the Anthro
pocene: Coupled-Human Natu
ral Systems of Southeast Alas
ka, took students to Sitka, Alas
ka, where they conducted field
work as part of an exploration of
ecological systems and the chal
lenges of modern day environ
mental stewardship. Unlike
many of the other courses of
fered, this one was spent entire
ly off campus and students were

given the opportunity to go
camping, visit the Inian Islands
and interact with locals.
Dylan Anslow 'l6, one of the
Alaska seminar participants,
said the group was able to inter
act with various Sitka natives in
cluding fishermen and timber
builders, who through both their
occupation and lifestyle engage
with ecological systems.
"We also went on amazing
hikes and saw 30 whales breach
one after another and learned
the names of dozen of plants in
the woods and then* traditional
uses," Anslow said.
Another new addition to this
year's selection was Photogra
phy, Truth or Fiction 0r..., a
course examining the ethics and
validity of photography taught
by Connie Wolf'Bl, the John and
Jill Freidenrich director of the
Cantor Arts Center.
Kristen Stipanov 'l6, who
participated in the photography
course, said they took several
field trips into San Francisco
and met with artists, curators,
advertisers and others involved
in photography or art.
"We also really explored how
Stanford uses photography," Sti
panov said, "and I really enjoyed
learning about the different re
sources on campus and how to
use Stanford to pursue my spe
cific interest in photography."
Stipanov also pointed out,
however, that the course de
served more than just two units be
cause of the amount of time stu
dents dedicated to the class outside
of the classroom.
"Even when we are not in class,
we are living in the dorm with the
other students, eating with them
and having discussions," Stipanov
said. "The residential experience is
a part of the class, and that means
that your mental energy is always
focused on the class during the
weeks that you are taking it."
The other three new classes
were Journeying In and Out: Cre

ative Writing and Performance in
Prison, which enabled Stanford stu
dents to work directly with the
youth at Hillcrest Juvenile Hall in
San Mateo; When Engineers Go
Sailing: the Science and Technology
of America's Cup Yachts and
Matches, which allowed students to
learn the basics of engineering and
technology design through the
study of the America's Cup boats;
and Public Education & Schooling:
The Great Equalizer or the Fierce
ly Competitive Field?, which fo
cused on understanding the issues
within American public education
and the public school infrastructure
itself.
