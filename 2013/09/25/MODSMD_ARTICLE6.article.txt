## ALICE PETTY DIRECTOR OF PREMAJOR ADVISING 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
Alice Petty, formerly an aca
demic director (AD) for Wilbur
Hall, recently became the new
director of Pre-Major Advising
(PMA). Petty will take on the
task of organizing and revamp
ing the expansive program. The
Daily sat down with Petty to talk
about her new role and how she
plans to reshape the program to
address students' concerns.

The Stanford Daily (TSD):
What is the role of a PMA?
Alice Petty (AP): Ideally, I see
the PMA as a mentor and sound
ing board for students. I ab
solutely believe that the kind of
connections that students can
have with staff or faculty early

New director of Pre-Major Advising
on can be critical and profoundly
valuable to their undergraduate ex
perience.
I love hearing stories about stu
dents who are able to kind of share
their decision-making process with
their PMA to get insight, to have
somebody push back and ask ques
tions, to have them navigate deci
sions, figure out what their overall
goals and values and plans are.

TSD: How will your experience
as an academic director impact
your role as director of the PMA
program?
AP: When I was a post-doc here
starting in 2006,1 volunteered for a
few years as a PMA, which is part
of what attracted me to the position
of academic director. I think as an
academic director I saw how the
AD and PMA programs really
work in partnership to support stu
dents and that was really attractive
to me.

TSD: What is the difference be
tween a PMA and an academic
director?
AP: An academic director, or an
ARC advisor, or a Sweet Hall advi
sor, they are full-time advising pro
fessionals who really very con
sciously and methodically pursue
in-depth knowledge of every de
partment and program on campus.
There's a lot of expertise and preci
sion there.
Whereas, pre-major advisors,
this is a volunteer thing that they
do and it's something that they
bring to their experience as Stan
ford employees. The pre-major ad
visors come from all over the uni

versity. What they bring to their
role as a pre-major advisor comes
through the lens of whatever other
responsibility they have on cam
pus. In many ways, that is the
strength of this program, because
it's a great opportunity for you to
see the university from different
perspectives.

TSD: How are students paired
with PMAs?
AP: The ADs do a match. We have
some information about the PMAs.
Usually it's their academic inter
ests, but they also give us hobbies,
recreational stuff â€”if they play an
instrument, if they have a dog, if
they like to run, that kind of thing.
When students are coming to Stan
ford, they write a letter to their fu
ture advisor, and we have that. And
the AD sits down and reads those
student files and keeping in
mind the people that they have
they work some sort of alchemy
and start matching.
One of the things I'll be thinking
about this year is how we do the
match, what kind of information
we solicit and what kind of ques
tions we ask of PMAs and stu
dents that might help us make bet
ter matches.

TSD: What are the challenges
you foresee having to deal with
in this new position?
AP: I do want to talk more about
what this relationship [between
PMA and student] can be, and why
it's important and why it's valuable
and how it can work. I think re
cruiting is challenging. It's a volun
teer position, we don't pay, it does
n't count toward faculty tenure
files and, because of that, we have a
hard time convincing some people
to give up their time, so I think
that's something I'm going to need
to work on.

TSD: Some students experience
frustration with the PMA pro
gram, either because their
PMA can't answer their ques
tions or students choose not to
interact with their advisor.
How do you plan to address
these scenarios?
AP: It's frustrating to me when I
hear that a student is disappointed
in their relationship with their
PMA because I know that these
people are all volunteers. I know
that they're out there, and there
must be some sort of pragmatic
way to address that. I think if peo
ple have clear expectations of what
the relationship is and how it
should work, they are less likely to
be disappointed.
I think part of that is we put the
hold on students and the expecta
tion is that you have to meet with
your PMA to get the hold lifted...
so your only reason for checking in
with your PMA is to have someone
proofread your study list and it's
unfortunate that those things are
tied together.

TSD: What do you most look for
ward to in this new position?
AP: I am sometimes very nervous
about stepping into this position.
But I really believe in this pro
gram. I really believe that advising
relationships and mentoring' is a
critical part of your college educa
tion.
I think that building connec
tions with faculty and staff is the
difference between being a con
sumer of community and a creator
of community, and that is tremen
dous. It can be absolutely transfor
mational for some students. I think
that this program has so much po
tential.
