# NEWS BRIEF
## Market at Munger meal plan dollar pilot a success 
### â€“ Baker Tilney 
Under Residential & Dining En
terprises (R&DE)'s pilot program
launched this summer, undergradu
ates continue to use meal plan dol
lars at The Market at Munger.
Launched on July 1, the pro
gram allows students to pay for any
of the campus grocery store's more
than 2,000 items with meal plan dol
lars, including non-food items such
as toiletries and Stanford apparel.
It is currently set to run until De
cember, when it will be evaluated
for continuation.
Previously, the market accepted
Cardinal Dollars in addition to cash.
While Cardinal Dollars have to be
purchased from Stanford Dining
and never expire, meal plan dollars
are included with most undergradu
ate meal plans. Up to 50 unused
meal plan dollars transfer quarter
to quarter, and all expire at the end
of the school year, prompting stu
dents to often try to use them be
fore quarter's end.
In July, R&DE spokesperson
Cynthia Liu explained that the pilot

program was an attempt to give
students more options in using
their meal plan dollars.
Pinnaree Tea-mangkornpan 'l5
did not buy products from the mar
ket prior to the beginning of the
program because she preferred to
use her meal plan dollars at places
that accepted them, but she is now a
frequent customer.
"Over the past summer that
Munger took meal plan dollars, I
visited at least once a week to get
fruits, good snacks, gelato, eggs
and other commodities," Tea
mangkornpan said.
Tea-mangkornpan hopes that
The Market at Munger will contin
ue to accept meal plan dollars going
forward, saying that she will be
come its biggest customer. She
added that she saves time and mon
ey by shopping at Munger rather
than at off-campus stores.
Accepting meal plan dollars has
the potential to further broaden the
market's customer base, appealing
to students like Robert Stineman 'l5.
"I've never been shopping at
Munger, but now I have a good rea
son to check it out," Stineman said.
Representatives from R&DE
were unavailable for comment.
