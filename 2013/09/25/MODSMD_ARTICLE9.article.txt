## FROM THE RIGHT In defense of Hacking 
### Marshall Watkins 
Even as efforts to address
global warming and fossil fu
el consumption on an inter
national level continue to struggle
and sputter, it's easy to overlook
the reality that largely of its own
accord the United States re
duced its carbon emissions by 450
million tons in the five years to
2012, a decline that can largely be
attributed to the emergence of nat
ural gas obtained through the
process of hydraulic fracturing or
"tracking." With global gas produc
tion projected to increase by 50
percent from 2010 to 2035, tracking
while perhaps both an imperfect
and interim measure offers both
a credible path towards responsible
energy security for the United
States and a compelling energy al
ternative for developing and devel
oped nations alike.
In America, certainly, tracking
which employs the injection of
water, sand and chemicals into hard
shale rock to break it up and ex
tract gas trapped therein has
been a revelation. From 2005 to
2012, the percentage of America's
overall gas production provided by
the practice jumped from 4 percent
to 24 percent. That transition has
created hundreds of thousands of
jobs, induced plummeting gas
prices and even potentially reduced
according to Citibank the na
tion's current-account deficit by 1.2
to 2.4 percent of gross domestic
product.
Fracking's potential can equally
be demonstrated by the interna
tional context. European and Asian
nations pay several multiples of
what Americans pay for their gas,
while only a few years after in
vesting heavily in infrastructure to
expand gas imports the United
States may soon become a net gas
exporter. As Europe grapples with
tracking regulations and Asia
struggles with inadequate infra
structure, that likely won't change
in the near future. That transfor
mation has broader implications for
energy diplomacy too, strengthen
ing America's hand in negotiations
with energy producers like Russia
or Saudi Arabia. At current produc
tion rates, moreover, America's
known gas reserves half of
which lie in "unconventional"
sources like shale —will last for
more than a century, confirming
the practice as a long-term alterna
tive. Similar resources have been
found around the world, from
Canada to China, and few other na
tions will hesitate to take full ad
vantage.
While tracking offers a cheaper
and more environmentally friendly
alternative to traditional fossil fu
els, its potential is admittedly limit
ed by both its finite nature and the
continued production of harmful

emissions as a side effect. It makes
sense, of course, to continue to in
vest in currently inadequate renew
able energy sources and to consoli
date the use of nuclear power into a
safer format. Pending significant
advances in green technology that
enable cost-efficient integration in
to the economy, however, replacing
the global consumption of fossil fu
el energy would necessitate the
construction of another 6,020 nu
clear power plants (or 14 times the
current global total). A "stop-gap"
measure like tracking that
mitigates the damage of fossil fuel
consumption while offering a viable
interim energy source may there
fore be the most appropriate meas
ure through the medium term.
Committing to tracking may al
so necessitate, however, an adjust
ment in the way that the United
States approaches the practice. In
recent years, tracking has benefit
ed spectacularly from loose regula
tion and generous federal and local
subsidies. While concerns ex
pressed by environmentalists over
methane leakage may have little
scientific basis given, admitted
ly, a limited amount of research on
the subject altogether and the po
tential omission of secondary emis
sions from the study's findings
as is the case for apprehension over
the industry's heavy water usage
and potential to poison groundwa
ter or induce earthquakes, it
makes little sense that tracking is
exempted from basic legislation
like the Clean Air Act or the Clean
Water Act. Adhering to such regu
lation and adopting appropriate
measures across America's 20,000
wells, according to the EPA, would
add a mere seven percent to the
cost of the average shale-gas well.
Far better, then, to embrace such
steps and tracking together, while
continuing to develop bigger and
braver solutions for the long term.
