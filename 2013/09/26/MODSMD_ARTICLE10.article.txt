## Dodgers deserve to be unrepentant 
### Winston Shi 
Ladies and gentlemen, I am
pleased to announce that the
Los Angeles Dodgers have
won the NL West. If I recall
correctly this happy moment
occurred shortly after I sent in my col
umn last week, but even though I may
be a week late in today's hectic news cy
cle, I am unrepentant.
Evidently the Dodgers are unre
pentant as well. After they clinched the
division in Phoenix, the Arizona Dia
mondbacks forbade the Dodgers to cel
ebrate on their field, so the Dodgers
started celebrating in the pool right
next to the field.
Needless to say the Diamondbacks
were outraged, and I've been told by
various friends that I follow the wrong
team. Senator John McCain took to
Twitter to call out the suddenly aptly
named Bums: "No-class act by a bunch
of overpaid, immature, arrogant,
spoiled brats!"
To a certain extent, McCain spoke
correctly. I cannot speak as to whether
the Dodgere are spoiled, but you could
definitely say that MLB players are
overpaid. Immature is fair; I can defi
nitely imagine McCain, grizzled warwet
that he is, thinking, 'Act like you've
been there before." When you are as
accomplished as John McCain, there's
a lot of things you can justly sniff at.
And arrogance. Ib a sportswriter,
the sin of sins.
I'm pretty much expected to excori
ate the Dodgers right now, right? I
should go on the standard spiel about
how players ought to be classier and
how they should treat their opponents
with more respect and how baseball is
n't what it used to be. Especially when
working on a deadline, getting a situa
tion like this is manna from heaven to a
columnist.
To be honest, though, I can't get
worked up about this.
The Dodgers didn't celebrate with
class. That's a fact. The Diamondbacks
don't care for the Dodgers, and it's
rather ungentlemanly of them to bar
the Dodgers from celebrating on their 1
field, but if they've asked the Dodgeis
to keep the champagne in the locker
room, it's their right to do so. The
Dodgeis shouldn't have headed for the
pool, and their doing so is disingenuous
loop-holing on their part—a clear and
deliberate attempt to rub it in.
Let's be clear' on this fact. This is not
an isolated incident. In fact, it may well
have been calculated; the Diamond
backs and Dodgers do not like each oth
er.
To a certain extent, this is because
the Dodgeis are the traditional power
of the West —the first MLB team on
the Pacific Coast, five-time World Se
ries champions since moving to Los An
geles, and by far* the biggest of the
Western big-market teams.
More importantly there's been bad
blood in recent years between the two
teams. In 2011, Arizona's Gerardo Par
ra showboated after hitting a home run,
and the next day Clayton Kershaw
drilled Parra on the elbow The next
time Kershaw pitched against the Dia
mondbacks, lan Kennedy attempted to
hit him twice —Kershaw being a tall
guy, it must be rather embarrassing for
Kennedy that he never actually man
aged to plunk the Dodger ace.
Then Kennedy started headhunt
ing and nearly concussed Zack
Greinke. Why go after Greinke? Only
Kennedy knows. But you're not sup
posed to go after innocent pitchers.
What did Greinke do? Kick Kennedy's
dog?
Anyway, the two teams started
brawling. Wewed in this light, I have no
issue with the Dodgers' deliberate in
sult. It also explains in large part Sena
tor McCain's irritation.
No follower of the Dodgers can de
ny that the 2013 squad has the most at
titude in recent memory Yasiel Puig, of
course, is the greatest showman to
grace Southern California since
Shaquille O'Neal.
Zack Greinke showed some attitude
when he hit Carlos Quentin, and when
Quentin broke Greinke's collarbone,
Matt Kemp proceeded to mock
Quentin's institution of higher educa
tion (no points for guessing what school
that was). The Dodgers are shameless
about buying players, to the point
where I'm surprised they haven't of
fered Kershaw $3O million a year.
But the Dodgers have made the
playoffs; their arrogance is actually in
celebration of something worth cele
brating. Much as the Dodgers may be
grating to other teams, I really can't get
that mad. If the Dodgers crash out of
the playoffs and still showboat, perhaps
then they may need a reality check.

Winston Shi is disappointed in the
Stanford police's reaction to his
plunge into MeniAud fountain to cel
ebrate the Dodgers'clinching. To give
Winston advice on lawyers, email

deliberate attempt to rub it in.
Let's be clear' on this fact. This is not
an isolated incident. In fact, it may well
have been calculated; the Diamond
backs and Dodgers do not like each oth
er.
To a certain extent, this is because
the Dodgeis are the traditional power
of the West —the first MLB team on
the Pacific Coast, five-time World Se
ries champions since moving to Los An
geles, and by far* the biggest of the
Western big-market teams.
More importantly there's been bad
blood in recent years between the two
teams. In 2011, Arizona's Gerardo Par
ra showboated after hitting a home run,
and the next day Clayton Kershaw
drilled Parra on the elbow The next
time Kershaw pitched against the Dia
mondbacks, lan Kennedy attempted to
hit him twice —Kershaw being a tall
guy, it must be rather embarrassing for
Kennedy that he never actually man
aged to plunk the Dodger ace.
Then Kennedy started headhunt
ing and nearly concussed Zack
Greinke. Why go after Greinke? Only
Kennedy knows. But you're not sup
posed to go after innocent pitchers.
What did Greinke do? Kick Kennedy's
dog?
Anyway, the two teams started
brawling. Wewed in this light, I have no
issue with the Dodgers' deliberate in
sult. It also explains in large part Sena
tor McCain's irritation.
No follower of the Dodgers can de
ny that the 2013 squad has the most at
titude in recent memory Yasiel Puig, of
course, is the greatest showman to
grace Southern California since
Shaquille O'Neal.
Zack Greinke showed some attitude
when he hit Carlos Quentin, and when
Quentin broke Greinke's collarbone,
Matt Kemp proceeded to mock
Quentin's institution of higher educa
tion (no points for guessing what school
that was). The Dodgers are shameless
about buying players, to the point
where I'm surprised they haven't of
fered Kershaw $3O million a year.
But the Dodgers have made the
playoffs; their arrogance is actually in
celebration of something worth cele
brating. Much as the Dodgers may be
grating to other teams, I really can't get
that mad. If the Dodgers crash out of
the playoffs and still showboat, perhaps
then they may need a reality check.

Winston Shi is disappointed in the
Stanford police's reaction to his
plunge into MeniAud fountain to cel
ebrate the Dodgers'clinching. To give
Winston advice on lawyers, email
