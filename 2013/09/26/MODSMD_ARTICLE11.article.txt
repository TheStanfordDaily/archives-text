# PREPARING FOR WAZZU
## THE
						CARDINAL'S DEPTH WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During training camp, Stanford football head
coach David Shaw repeatedly emphasized how
pleased he was with his team's overall depth. Now,
facing a Saturday night showdown at Century Link
Field against Washington State without heralded sen
iors Ed Reynolds (suspended for the first half) and
David Yankey, the Cardinal will certainly be putting
this depth to the test.
In particular, the Stanford defensive backs will
face a stiff challenge in stopping Mike Leach's pass
happy spread attack with free safety Reynolds out for
the first half and cornerback Barry Browning ques
tionable to play with an undisclosed injury. However,
Shaw remains optimistic given the tremendous depth
in the secondary.
"We have three different nickels and we have four
different guys that can play corner, and four different
guys that can play safety [even] without Ed," Shaw
said.
Specifically, Shaw pointed to fifth-year senior
Usua Amanam and junior Ronnie Harris as nickel
backs who could make an impact at corner in the ab
sence of Browning. In place of Reynolds, the Cardinal
will stai*t senior Devon Carrington at safety. In addi
tion, Carrington will also see significant action at cor
ner in the second half once Reynolds finishes serving
his suspension for targeting Arizona State quarter
back Taylor Kelly in last week's game.
When asked about the possibility of seeing a signif
icant amount of playing time this week, Carrington
emphasized his readiness to take on the task.
"I feel great about that. If that's how it works out,
I'd be just fine," Carrington said. "I'd be happy about
it. But I'm ready for it. I've played plenty of corner
this camp and the first few games so I'm ready... I'm
just trying to focus right now on safety and just get
ting the job done."
On the offensive side of the ball, sophomore Joshua
Garnett will replace the Ail-American Yankey at the
left guard position. While Stanford will certainly miss
the experience and leadership of Yankey, offensive co
ordinator and offensive line coach Mike Bloomgren
expressed confidence that Garnett will be able to step
up. "He had the best game of his Stanford ca
reer [against Arizona State]," Bloomgren said. "It's
great to see him growing into his role ... He's light
years ahead of where he was last year, but he's also
light-years ahead of where he was last spring."
Moreover, Saturday's game at Century Link Field
will also be a homecoming for Garnett, a Puyallup,
Wash., native. When asked about players returning to
their hometowns for games, Shaw acknowledged that
those contests do take on an additional level of signif
icance and excitement. Consequently, Shaw revealed
that he will tease Garnett before the game to calm him
down by telling him, "Don't jump offside on the first
play."
However, Shaw also noted that he believes Garnett
will naturally settle down once the game gets going.
"It's always that first play where they're so
ramped up," Shaw said, "but once we get to play 20
and 30, he's going to be too tired to be excited."
