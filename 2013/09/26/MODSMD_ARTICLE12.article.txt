## Women's volleyball beats Cal in nail-biter 
### â€” Ashley Westhem 
The No. 7 Stanford women's vol
leyball team (8-2) barely knocked off
rival Berkeley (7-3) at Haas Pavilion
Wednesday night in a four set match,
(20-25, 25-23, 25-22,28-26). Although
Cal is projected to finish in the bot
tom half of the Pac-12, without the
dynamic play and hops of sophomore
middle blocker Inky Ajanaku, the
Golden Bears were able to capitalize
and force missed blocks at the net.
Service errors early on hurt the
Cardinal as the Bears were able to
take the first set 25-20. However, the
Card made adjustments and the rest
of the match was a dogfight. Stanford
controlled the second set until Cal
went on a 3-0 run to narrow the lead
to just 24-23. The third set again
went down to a close set point. Soph
omore outside hitter Brittany
Howard, however, was determined to
take the set and won the set on a vi
cious kill.
After the third set Stanford led 2-
1 but still suffered from service er
rors with more than three times as
many as the Bears. In the fourth set
Stanford held off Cal until the end
when the Bears went on a 5-1 run to
tie the match at 25 apiece. There
were two lead changes and two ties
until the Cardinal finally got the
match point off of a block, winning
28-26.
Stanford will have a tough time on
Friday with N0.16 Arizona State if
Ajanaku is still sick and has to sit out.
The Card faces off against the Sun
Devils at Maples Pavilion on Friday
at 6 p.m.
