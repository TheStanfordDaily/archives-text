## Putting could be problematic 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
After a solid start to the season
at the NCAA Fall Preview in Iblsa,
Okla., the Stanford women's golf
team heads to Northmoor Country
Club in Highland Park, 111., for the
Windy City Collegiate Classic. Led
by sophomores Mariah Stackhouse
and Lauren Kim, the squad will
face familiar Pac-12 opponents
including defending National

Champions USC and Arizona, as
well as tournament host North
western. This is the first time the
Cardinal has attended the tourna
ment.
"This is a great event with a
terrific amount of support from the
Chicago community," commented
Head Coach Anne Walker. "The
golf course is always in great con
dition and the tournament field [is]
tough. I thought it would be good
for our team to play in the Midwest

against teams we rarely see until
postseason."
In addition to familiarizing
themselves with possible NCAA
regional and championship oppo
nents, Stanford is looking at this
tournament as an opportunity for
improving its short game a facet
Walker identified as a problem
area after the Fall Preview
"We are constantly working our
short games, as they are the
most important part of golf,"
said Kim. "We had a short
game qualifier [Monday] in
which we played 14 par-2
holes and four par-3 holes,
comprised of a variety of
different shots. It is a true
test of how good our short
games are and will hopeful
ly show us what we need to
work on for Northmoor."
Walker added that the
team's Wednesday practice
was dedicated solely to
chipping. The team's atten
tion to their shots from 100
yards and in should serve
them well at Northmoor, a
course designed by Donald
Ross. A golf icon, Ross was
famous for his "turtleback"
greens, which slope consid
erably at the front and back
and thus put a premium on
iron, wedge and putter ac
curacy. Other Ross de
signed courses include
Oakland Hills in Michigan,
Inverness Club in Ohio,

and Oak Hill in New York
those three have com
bined to host 13 U.S. Opens
and eight PGA Champi
onships.
"I expect well-designed
holes with generous fair
ways and large, undulating
greens," said Walker.
While the short team
goal for this Cardinal team
will be its chipping and put
ting, its season-long goal
should be improving its
overall team depth: Stan
ford's 25-shot spread (high
est cumulative score minus
lowest cumulative score)
was second highest at
NCAA Fall Preview and was
also an issue (23 shots) at the
2013 NCAA tournament.
"I think as the years pass
our depth will only increase,"
Kim said. "We are headed in
the right direction and have
created a friendly but com
petitive environment on our
team. I think the most impor
tant thing for everyone to do
is simply to shoot lower
scores and motivate the team
to score better in order to
make the lineup... We make
each other better by shooting
better scores."

Low rounds may be hard
to come by in this tourna
ment, however. Given the de
sign of the greens, the possi
bility of windy weather not
conducive to lower scores and
the fact that these players
are in a period of readjusting
to the life of a student-ath
lete, some rough rounds may
be in the cards. But regard
less of the situation, this team
seems to know what they're
up against and exactly how to
prepare for it.
"I have heard [that]
Northmoor is a challenging
course one that will test
our patience and skill," Kim
said. "This week we were for
tunate enough to have the op
portunity to play some diffi
cult local courses in similar
conditions wind, severely
undulating greens â€”so I
think we will know what to
expect."
The Cardinal will tee off
on Monday morning and play
36 holes on the day, following
up with the final 18 on Tues
day. Live stats are available
