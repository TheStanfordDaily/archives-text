# Stanford hosts sole home meet
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
Stanford cross country will host its only home
meet of the season at the Stanford Golf Course
for the 40th annual Stanford Invitational on Sat
urday morning. Almost 2,800 of the West Coast's
best high school runners and over 500 collegiate
runners will compete in 14 races throughout the
morning.
The collegiate men and women will begin
their races at 9:50 a.m. and 10:30 a.m., respec
tively, sandwiched between 12 high school races.
The men will be racing an eight-kilometer course
while the women will be competing in a six-kilo
meter course. The high school races will all be on
a five-kilometer course and divided between six
divisions of runners.
This will be the second meet of the season for
both of Stanford's teams, with each claiming first
place finishes at the University of San Francisco
Invitational on Aug. 31.
For the No. 20 men's team, Saturday's meet
will be a good opportunity for coach Chris Mil
tenberg to continue to evaluate the performance
of his new and returning athletes and determine
the top seven that Stanford will put forward in
the year's remaining meets.
Five of last year's top seven return for the
men, including senior Erik Olson and junior Joe
Rosa, who were Stanford's top two finishers at
the NCAA Championships last year, in which the
Cardinal placed 16th. The Cardinal, however, will

need to examine the per
formances of its runners in
both the San Francisco Invi
tational and the Stanford In
vitational to attempt to re
place the production of de
parted Ail-Americans Ben
jamin Johnson and Miles Un
terreiner.
Many of the sophomores
on the team are vying for a
larger role, including Garrett
Sweatt, Kevin Bishop and Will
Drinkwater, each of whom ran
in Stanford's top seven at the
San Francisco Invitational.
Sweatt and Bishop each
placed in the top ten with
times of under 26 minutes in
the eight-kilometer. In addi
tion to the talented sopho
more corps, the Cardinal wel
comes 10 freshmen to the ros
ter â€” nearly half of the 24
listed athletes. Although it is
not expected that any of them
will crack the top seven, they
will have an opportunity on
Saturday to show the coaches
their promise.
Meanwhile, for the No. 8

women's team, Saturday will
represent another opportuni
ty for the Cardinal to make a
huge splash among over
matched opponents. The
women return their entire
top seven from last year
apart from reigning Pac-12
Champion and two-time Ail-
American Kathy Kroeger.
Stanford started its sea
son off with a bang last
month at the San Francisco
Invitational, in which it
claimed first place by an
enormous margin. The entire
top seven finished in the top
10 of the race, with senior
Jessica Tonn and junior Ais
ling Cuffe Stanford's top
finisher at the 2012 NCAA
Championships leading
the charge with their 17:44
times in the five-kilometer to
finish at second and third, re
spectively. None of the top
seven finished with a time

slower than the twin 18:09.4
mark recorded by standout
sophomore Megan Lacy and
junior Molly McNamara.
The Cardinal looks to
have another easy time in
Saturday's meet against a
field that includes the No. 23
University of San Francisco
as the only other ranked
school. The women hold a
nine-year winning streak in
the meet, while the men en
ter the meet with an 18-year
streak.
Both squads will look to
keep those streaks alive as
teams from Stanford and
over 30 other schools from
the West Coast will compete
stalling at 9:50 a.m. on Satur
day, while the meet itself and
high school races will begin at
9 a.m.
