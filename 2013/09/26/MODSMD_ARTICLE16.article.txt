## OP-ED A 						Call to Public Service 
### Thomas Ehrlich is a visiting professor at the Graduate School of Education, Previously.; he was the dean of Stanford Law School, provost of the University of Pennsylvania president of Indiana University 
I am a visiting professor at the
Graduate School of Education.
Ernestine Fu 'l3 M.S. 'l3 is a
Ph.D. student in the School of Engi
neering. More than 57 years in age
separate us. But we share a common
passion for public service, or what
we call "civic work." Three years
ago, we began collaborating on a
book about why and how people of
all ages, especially young people,
should engage in public service. The
book was published this summer
and is titled "Civic Work, Civic Les
sons: Two Generations Reflect on
Public Service."
Our book results from the ex
tended conversations that we have
had concerning the goals of civic en
gagement. We believe that our
democracy requires men and
women of all ages and all walks of
life to find them own civic paths and
to pursue them with determination,
compassion, respect for others and
humility about the limitations of
their own perspectives. Our public
service paths were very different,
but each holds valuable lessons for
any and all interested in civic work.
I served in part of the Kennedy
administration, and subsequent ad
ministrations of Presidents Johnson,
Ford, Carter and Clinton, in part be
cause I had been stirred by Presi
dent John F. Kennedy and his call to
ask ourselves "not what your coun
try can do for you, but what you can
do for your country."
In the book, I recall a fall day in
1963.1 was in a drab auditorium in
the Department of State in Washing
ton, D.C. The room was packed with
those designated as "senior offi
cials," and I had the good fortune to
be one of them, though I was only a
29-year-old special assistant to Un
der Secretary of State George W
Ball.
We all stood as President
Kennedy walked into the room and
up to a podium. He began by thank
ing us for our civic work and then he
spoke eloquently about the impor
tance of that work. I felt he was talk
ing directly to me and remember al
so that I felt 10-feet tall as I listened
to his brief remarks.
Over time, my commitment to
public service deepened as I wit
nessed first-hand the ways in which
government can help both the coun
try as a whole in times of crisis and
how individual citizens who, through
no fault of their own, are the most
vulnerable among us. Public service
became an increasingly part of my
sense of self as I participated in var
ious forms of that service.
I have since held a number of full
time jobs in government and served
in the administrations of four presi
dents, including responsibility for
foreign aid policy, reporting directly
to President Carter. The rest of my
full-time professional life has been
working in universities.
My early years in education were
as a faculty member and administra
tor at Stanford University, where I
was first a professor and then the
dean of the Law School. Later I was
provost at the University of Pennsyl
vania. I then consciously chose to
move from Penn to a public institu
tion, Indiana University, where I was
president, because I wanted to grap
ple with issues of public access to
higher education as well as ones of
quality.
Ernestine and I both recognize
that moral leadership is essential in
civic work, and this is one of our key
lessons.
As I describe in the book, I was a
young assistant to Abram Chayes,
legal adviser in the State Depart

ment, and I was assigned the role of
legal counsel for the State Depart
ment in negotiating the sale of nu
clear missiles to the United King
dom, which President Kennedy and
British Prime Minister Harold
MacMillan had agreed to. This was
the first sale of nuclear missiles to
any foreign government and the ne
gotiations at the Pentagon were
cloaked in great secrecy.
At the outset, the admiral in
charge of the U.S. team said, in ef
fect, "Let's agree that no transcript
will be kept of the negotiations so
that no one will feel inhibited about
speaking. In short, there will be no
records kept until we have the final
text of an agreement covering all as
pects of the sale."
The British agreed and the nego
tiations proceeded. At the end of the
second day of negotiations, I was
alone in the meeting room when a
sailor came in, ducked under the
table around which we had all been
sitting, and pulled out a box from
which he extracted several record
ing tapes. It was instantly clear to
me that a secret recording machine
had been taping all our discussions.
I quickly went to the Defense De
partment lawyer who had been pres
ent and told bim that the recording
violated the commitment not to keep
a record of the proceedings. "Oh,
don't worry about that," he told me.
"The British will never know."
But I did worry about it, and
when I returned to the State De
partment I told this story to Chayes.
He immediately called Secretary of
State Dean Rusk and asked for an
appointment urgently. A few min
utes later we went up to the Secre
tary's cavernous office on the sev
enth floor, where I repeated my tale
to Rusk.
While Chayes and I were still in
his office, Rusk picked up a special
phone that connected him directly to
Secretary of Defense Robert McNa
mara. Rusk told McNamara my sto
ry and said it was not acceptable for
tbe United States to be violating its
word to our closest ally. McNamara
instantly agreed that the recording
would be suspended.
Our headlines are often crowded
with stories of civic leaders who
stumble morally when doing their
civic work, and even more often with
tales of civic leaders whose personal
lives are morally flawed. The connec
tion between personal and public
morality is not as clear-cut as many
news commentators would suggest.
But civic leaders, whether in
charge of non profit organizations or
government agencies, should be role
models, particularly for those people
who work with them, and moral laps
es in their personal or professional
lives often leave scars that weaken
their authority in their civic work.
Moral rectitude is an essential com
ponent of civic leadership.
Although my path of public serv
ice differs from Ernestine's, reflect
ing the differences in our particular*
interests as well as our ages, we both
find that civic work has become part
of our identities, part of who we are
as human beings. That work has en
abled us both to feel connected to
something larger than ourselves and
to the world around us in ways that
would not have happened without
our commitment to public service.

While Chayes and I were still in
his office, Rusk picked up a special
phone that connected him directly to
Secretary of Defense Robert McNa
mara. Rusk told McNamara my sto
ry and said it was not acceptable for
tbe United States to be violating its
word to our closest ally. McNamara
instantly agreed that the recording
would be suspended.
Our headlines are often crowded
with stories of civic leaders who
stumble morally when doing their
civic work, and even more often with
tales of civic leaders whose personal
lives are morally flawed. The connec
tion between personal and public
morality is not as clear-cut as many
news commentators would suggest.
But civic leaders, whether in
charge of non profit organizations or
government agencies, should be role
models, particularly for those people
who work with them, and moral laps
es in their personal or professional
lives often leave scars that weaken
their authority in their civic work.
Moral rectitude is an essential com
ponent of civic leadership.
Although my path of public serv
ice differs from Ernestine's, reflect
ing the differences in our particular*
interests as well as our ages, we both
find that civic work has become part
of our identities, part of who we are
as human beings. That work has en
abled us both to feel connected to
something larger than ourselves and
to the world around us in ways that
would not have happened without
our commitment to public service.
I am a visiting professor at the
Graduate School of Education.
Ernestine Fu 'l3 M.S. 'l3 is a
Ph.D. student in the School of Engi
neering. More than 57 years in age
separate us. But we share a common
passion for public service, or what
we call "civic work." Three years
ago, we began collaborating on a
book about why and how people of
all ages, especially young people,
should engage in public service. The
book was published this summer
and is titled "Civic Work, Civic Les
sons: Two Generations Reflect on
Public Service."
Our book results from the ex
tended conversations that we have
had concerning the goals of civic en
gagement. We believe that our
democracy requires men and
women of all ages and all walks of
life to find them own civic paths and
to pursue them with determination,
compassion, respect for others and
humility about the limitations of
their own perspectives. Our public
service paths were very different,
but each holds valuable lessons for
any and all interested in civic work.
I served in part of the Kennedy
administration, and subsequent ad
ministrations of Presidents Johnson,
Ford, Carter and Clinton, in part be
cause I had been stirred by Presi
dent John F. Kennedy and his call to
ask ourselves "not what your coun
try can do for you, but what you can
do for your country."
In the book, I recall a fall day in
1963.1 was in a drab auditorium in
the Department of State in Washing
ton, D.C. The room was packed with
those designated as "senior offi
cials," and I had the good fortune to
be one of them, though I was only a
29-year-old special assistant to Un
der Secretary of State George W
Ball.
We all stood as President
Kennedy walked into the room and
up to a podium. He began by thank
ing us for our civic work and then he
spoke eloquently about the impor
tance of that work. I felt he was talk
ing directly to me and remember al
so that I felt 10-feet tall as I listened
to his brief remarks.
Over time, my commitment to
public service deepened as I wit
nessed first-hand the ways in which
government can help both the coun
try as a whole in times of crisis and
how individual citizens who, through
no fault of their own, are the most
vulnerable among us. Public service
became an increasingly part of my
sense of self as I participated in var
ious forms of that service.
I have since held a number of full
time jobs in government and served
in the administrations of four presi
dents, including responsibility for
foreign aid policy, reporting directly
to President Carter. The rest of my
full-time professional life has been
working in universities.
My early years in education were
as a faculty member and administra
tor at Stanford University, where I
was first a professor and then the
dean of the Law School. Later I was
provost at the University of Pennsyl
vania. I then consciously chose to
move from Penn to a public institu
tion, Indiana University, where I was
president, because I wanted to grap
ple with issues of public access to
higher education as well as ones of
quality.
Ernestine and I both recognize
that moral leadership is essential in
civic work, and this is one of our key
lessons.
As I describe in the book, I was a
young assistant to Abram Chayes,
legal adviser in the State Depart

ment, and I was assigned the role of
legal counsel for the State Depart
ment in negotiating the sale of nu
clear missiles to the United King
dom, which President Kennedy and
British Prime Minister Harold
MacMillan had agreed to. This was
the first sale of nuclear missiles to
any foreign government and the ne
gotiations at the Pentagon were
cloaked in great secrecy.
At the outset, the admiral in
charge of the U.S. team said, in ef
fect, "Let's agree that no transcript
will be kept of the negotiations so
that no one will feel inhibited about
speaking. In short, there will be no
records kept until we have the final
text of an agreement covering all as
pects of the sale."
The British agreed and the nego
tiations proceeded. At the end of the
second day of negotiations, I was
alone in the meeting room when a
sailor came in, ducked under the
table around which we had all been
sitting, and pulled out a box from
which he extracted several record
ing tapes. It was instantly clear to
me that a secret recording machine
had been taping all our discussions.
I quickly went to the Defense De
partment lawyer who had been pres
ent and told bim that the recording
violated the commitment not to keep
a record of the proceedings. "Oh,
don't worry about that," he told me.
"The British will never know."
But I did worry about it, and
when I returned to the State De
partment I told this story to Chayes.
He immediately called Secretary of
State Dean Rusk and asked for an
appointment urgently. A few min
utes later we went up to the Secre
tary's cavernous office on the sev
enth floor, where I repeated my tale
to Rusk.
While Chayes and I were still in
his office, Rusk picked up a special
phone that connected him directly to
Secretary of Defense Robert McNa
mara. Rusk told McNamara my sto
