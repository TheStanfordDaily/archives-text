# The
						New Yorker, At It Again

The New Yorker has been fret
ting about Stanford's enthusi
astic entrepreneurs for a while
now. Last year, the magazine's Ken
Auletta proclaimed us "Get Rich U."
This April in the Daily, students and
the editor of The New Yorker's web
site Nicholas Thompson exchanged
volleys when Thompson questioned
whether Stanford was even "still a
university?" after over a dozen stu
dents dropped out to work on the
startup Clinkle. What would come
next?
Well, on Sept. 5, Stanford an
nounced that it was giving a three
year, $1,200,000 yearly grant to
StartX, the non profit startup accel
erator exclusively dedicated to
"Stanford-affiliated entrepreneurs."
Further, the University created a
new investment vehicle known as
the Stanford-StartX Fluid, with the
power to invest unlimited amounts
of money to "support founders and
technology emerging from the
StartX programs." In other words,
after a long history of celebrated
companies born from its hallowed

halls, the University itself has finally
decided to start funding and like
ly directly profiting from â€”the
startups created by its students.
Right on queue, The New Yorker
released another piece titled "Stan
ford and Its Start-ups," lamenting
"the blurring of lines between the
university and the tech industry."
Given the windfall for Stanford's en
dowment should a startup become
successful, how would that change
how the University treated its stu
dents? As Thompson put it, bran
dishing his achingly concerned pen,
"If the university is a farm, do the
students become the cows?"
Wait... what?
In comparing students to cows,
pushed and prodded into dropping
out and doing startups by a universi
ty hungry for cash, The New Yorker
has demonstrated again that it fun
damentally misunderstands the
place of entrepreneurship on cam
pus.
It sees student-created startups
as attempts "to get rich fast," yet
that is hardly the primary motivator
behind most founders I've met. In
deed, Thompson's plaintive cry,
"Shouldn't [school] be a place to
drift, to think, to read, to meet new
people, and to work at whatever in
spires you?" actually describes far
more precisely the aspects of a cul
ture that encourage so many to start
companies.
People attend school for many
different reasons, but undeniably
prominent among them is the desire
to build the skills and relationships
necessary to affect change upon the
world. Leland and Jane Stanford
even established the University
specifically for the purpose of pro
ducing "cultured and useful citi
zens." The explosion of startups cre
ated by students is not a symptom of

the subsuming of philosophical in
quiry and intellectual curiosity by
the desire to make a lot of money
swiftly. Rather, it is the manifesta
tion of people acting on the inspira
tion to leave a mark on the world
through the most effective means at
them disposal.
A liberal arts education teaches
students to be much more than task
doers. It encourages students to ask
"why?" and part of asking "why?" is
to wonder why things are done the
way they are. What are the prob
lems we face, and why are they prob
lems? How might they be rectified?
How might things be done newer,
differently, better? In The New
Yorker's ideal world, perhaps these
might remain purely rhetorical in
quiries, lest our youthful minds be
constricted by the practicalities of
actually doing something.
Amusingly, Thompson finds it
worth pointing out that there might
be a conflict of interest in how pro
fessors give grades to students
whose company they've invested in.
Mr. Thompson, starting a company
is not like babysitting your profes
sor's kids. Startups exist in the real
world rather than the rarified ah* of
the classroom. Grades, especially a
single grade in a single class, are ir
relevant. Certainly nobody is going
to a professor for investment just to
score an A.
Perhaps The New Yorker's fears
of quick money tainting the student-
University relationship derive from
the prevalence of tech startups. Cer
tainly, stories abound about fantastic
payouts in the tech scene. Instead,
consider the fact that many choose
tech as emblematic of motivated stu
dents seizing upon the incredible
power technology grants us to affect
change, sometimes at a very low
cost-of-entry.
Stanford's decision to support
StartX and its entrepreneurs is a
bold and important step for the Uni
versity. But it represents no great
change in mindset or culture. It
merely formalizes entrepreneurship
as a virtue as worthy of support,
complementing other, more tradi
tional ones like the arts, community
service and sport. Add "found a
startup" to the extensive array of
mechanisms by which Stanford em
powers students to achieve their best.
