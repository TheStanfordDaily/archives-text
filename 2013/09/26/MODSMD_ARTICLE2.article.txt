## Stanford to invest in StartX fund University to make minority investments in student startups 
### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
A new venture fund jointly estab
lished by StartX, the Stanford-affiliat
ed startup incubator, Stanford Univer
sity and Stanford Hospitals & Clinics,
enables Stanford to directly invest in
student-founded companies.
The fund, designed for StartX
backed startups, allows shareholders to
avoid paying the high fees associated
with investing in venture capital funds.
"By investing directly, we are not
paying the fees that would normally go
to the general partners of a VC part
nership," said Randy Livingston '75
MBA '79, the University's vice presi
dent for business affairs.
According to John Melas-Kyriazi 'll
M.S. 'l3, StartX's chief financial officer,
the creation of the fund came after
StartX had turned down investors' re
quests for the right to invest in StartX
companies.
"The reason we said no [earlier] is
because we have a strong focus on out
value as a nonprofit," he said.
Historically, this has been one of the
differentiating factors between StartX
and other incubator programs. StartX
did not previously require or offer in
vestments to startups, unlike some old
er incubator programs in the area.
This traditional value focus is what
led to the particular structuring of the
fund, according to Melas-Kyriazi.
"We decided to set up a fund that
was, instead of a required investment,
an opt-in investment," he added. "We
set up the fund in such a founder
friendly way, that almost every founder
we have talked to has opted into the
fund."
One of the controversies associated
with the fund revolved around the fact
that it was a venture capital fund, which
would involve Stanford University,
among other groups, holding equity in
companies.
According to Melas-Kyri
azi, the fund was an entirely
separate entity.
"Equity goes to an entity
called the Stanford-StartX
Fund, the members of which
are StartX, Stanford Univer
sity and Stanford hospitals,"
Melas-Kyriazi said.
"It's not that Stanford
owns 10 percent of a compa
ny when we invest through
the fund," he added.
Livingston agreed, em
phasizing that the fund and
Stanford will not be making
investment decisions.
"We are not trying to

make a judgment as to which
companies are going to be
successful or unsuccessful,"
Livingston said.
He explained that
through the fund, Stanford is
agreeing to invest in any
StartX-affiliated venture
where other investors have
made a commitment. Accord
ing to Livingston, the equity
in which Stanford is investing
comes from unrestricted
University funding, and the
aspirations of a financial re
turn were the same as the
other investments that the
endowment has made.
"In this case, we are tak
ing a small amount of Univer
sity funds and are investing
in entrepreneurial ventures
started by former students,"
he said.
Melas-Kyriazi anticipated

the fund to own about three
to four percent of invested
companies, and added that
the investment would not re
quire a board seat.
Despite endorsing stu
dent-founded startups, the
fund would not encourage
students to leave their de
grees incomplete, according
to Livingston.
"We are paying very close
attention to the graduation
status of these students,"
Livingston said. "Our strong
preference is for all Stanford
students to complete their
degrees."
"We are not endorsing the
idea of students dropping out
[of Stanford] to start these
companies," he added.
