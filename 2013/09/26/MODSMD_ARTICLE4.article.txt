# BOSP adds summer programs
## Additions to include quarter-long offerings in Santiago, Cape Town 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Ivan Jaksic flew up to California
three years ago and attended his annual meet
ing with administrators at the Bing Overseas
Study Program (BOSP), the two parties dis
cussed the possibility of launching a summer
overseas program in Santiago, Chile.
"We started talking about what would be
the challenges of opening a summer quarter in
Santiago," said Jaksic, director of the BOSP
center in the South American city. "That initi
ated the conversation."
It took two years of hammering out the de
tails, but BOSP administrators officially made
the decision to move forward with a 2014 sum
mer quarter program in Santiago and also re
cently announced the plans for one in Cape
Town in 2015. The winter quarter offering in
Santiago will be dropped in consequence of the
summer addition.
The Stanford faculty-in-residence, who will
stay at the Santiago center during summer
2014, will be Zephyr Prank, associate profes
sor of Latin American history. Prank will teach
a course on Latin American history through an
engagement with environmental and economic
factors. He will also be running a research
project involving salmon farming, an industry
of immense importance in Santiago, according
to Jaskic.
Other courses to be offered during the first
summer program in Santiago will focus on
ecology, short Latin American fiction and ener
gy management.
Practical rationale prompts the addition
According to Jaksic, the original idea to
launch a summer program in Santiago
stemmed from practical concerns.
It had always been tough to recruit local
faculty members to teach courses and families
to host students during Stanford's winter
quarter with the North and South Hemisphere
having opposite seasons. At the same time
Stanford finds itself in the middle of an aca
demic year, Santiago enters the part of the cal
endar where many choose to go on vacation.
