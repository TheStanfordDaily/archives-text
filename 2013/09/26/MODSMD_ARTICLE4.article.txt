# BOSP adds summer programs
## Additions to include quarter-long offerings in Santiago, Cape Town 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Ivan Jaksic flew up to California
three years ago and attended his annual meet
ing with administrators at the Bing Overseas
Study Program (BOSP), the two parties dis
cussed the possibility of launching a summer
overseas program in Santiago, Chile.
"We started talking about what would be
the challenges of opening a summer quarter in
Santiago," said Jaksic, director of the BOSP
center in the South American city. "That initi
ated the conversation."
It took two years of hammering out the de
tails, but BOSP administrators officially made
the decision to move forward with a 2014 sum
mer quarter program in Santiago and also re
cently announced the plans for one in Cape
Town in 2015. The winter quarter offering in
Santiago will be dropped in consequence of the
summer addition.
The Stanford faculty-in-residence, who will
stay at the Santiago center during summer
2014, will be Zephyr Prank, associate profes
sor of Latin American history. Prank will teach
a course on Latin American history through an
engagement with environmental and economic
factors. He will also be running a research
project involving salmon farming, an industry
of immense importance in Santiago, according
to Jaskic.
Other courses to be offered during the first
summer program in Santiago will focus on
ecology, short Latin American fiction and ener
gy management.
Practical rationale prompts the addition
According to Jaksic, the original idea to
launch a summer program in Santiago
stemmed from practical concerns.
It had always been tough to recruit local
faculty members to teach courses and families
to host students during Stanford's winter
quarter with the North and South Hemisphere
having opposite seasons. At the same time
Stanford finds itself in the middle of an aca
demic year, Santiago enters the part of the cal
endar where many choose to go on vacation.
"People in Santiago take their
vacation very seriously," Jaskic not
ed, "which means during the Janu
ary through March period, it is very
difficult to find faculty and families."
Running a Santiago program
during the summer rather than
winter quarter would resolve the
problem, Jaskic thought.
But BOSP administrators had
additional reasons for wanting to
consider a quarter-length summer
program.
In the past few years, the office
has made a concentrated effort to
consider ways it can expand and
make its overseas offerings more
flexible for undergraduate stu
dents, Irene Kennedy, executive di
rector of BOSI? said.
The Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES) re
port, which makes a series of rec
ommendations on how to improve
the Stanford undergraduate expe
rience, heralds many benefits that
come from a student's decision to
study abroad: "linguistic facility,"
"self-reflectiveness," "cultural sen
sitivity," "self-reliance," "adaptabil
ity."
But the report also adds that
there are certain segments of the
student body that tend to face sig
nificant barriers to studying
abroad and, as a result, choose to
participate in the University's
overseas program in lower num
bers. These students include varsi
ty student-athletes who must par
take in practices year-round or ma
jors in unit-intensive fields such as
Engineering or Natural Sciences
who must enroll in yearlong course
sequences.
"When we started thinking
about ways that we could create op
portunities for students who for
one reason or another couldn't go
overseas during the year, it seemed
logical to try [a summer program

in Santiago]," Kennedy said.
Launching the new summer
quarter program did not require
any additional funds or approval
from the university provost, ac
cording to Kennedy, because BOSP
is dropping the winter quarter of
the program in order to add the
summer quarter.

BOSP's dedication to flexibility
grows
Before the September an
nouncement, BOSP had already
been in the process of adding new
overseas offerings to give more un
dergraduates the opportunity to
study abroad.
During the 2011-12 academic
year, the University brought back
its popular Overseas Seminar pro
gram, which allows undergradu
ates to study abroad during the
summer in a three-week course
with a small group of peers. Last
summer, the University reinstat
ed its Community Health Pro
gram in Oaxaca, Mexico an im
mersive, four-week training pro
gram for students committed to
working with the immigrant Lati
no population in the United States
after the program was cut on
two separate occasions due to
budgetary constraints and a trav
el warning issued by the U.S. gov
ernment.
But the summer program in
Santiago will be the first full
length overseas offering outside of
the academic year since the SUES
report's recommendations.
A summer program at the
BOSP center in Cape Town, which
currently operates during the win
ter and spring quarters, will follow
shortly in 2015 with planning still
underway.
"We knew ever since we've
opened the Cape Town program
that we wanted to add a third quar
ter to Cape Town," Kennedy said.
"The other part of the Cape
Town decision was that we liked
the idea that students who were
there during spring quarter and
started doing community-based

learning in the townships would
have the opportunity to stay the
summer and have more time doing
that if they wanted," she added.

Possibilities for future summer
initiatives
While the summer program in
Cape Town will likely be limited to
23 students, which corresponds to
the number of beds in the guest
houses that undergraduates stay at
during the term, Kennedy said
BOSP has no expectations on how
many students will participate in
the Santiago summer program
or even how many students will be
interested in applying.
"We are really curious...
whether there's a pent-up demand
for summer or whether people
have other options in terms of in
ternships and jobs," Kennedy said.
Depending on the popularity of
the Santiago and Cape Town pro
grams both in terms of quantita
tive application numbers and quali
tative end-of-term evaluations
more summer programs might be
added at other BOSP centers.
"I think if those are successful,
we'd definitely look at other kinds
of summer programs," Kennedy
said. "But it might not necessarily
be like a full academic quarter like
we are doing in Santiago."
"I think students will likely see
more flexible programs like the
Oaxaca program, which is longer
that a seminar and shorter than a
quarter," she added.
The summer programs in Cape
Town and Santiago might pose
some complications with financial
aid. Participation in these pro
grams will count as a quarter en
rolled as a full-time Stanford stu
dent.
Kennedy said BOSP hopes stu
dents who participate in these sum
mer programs will not have to
spend a 13th quarter at Stanford
when full financial aid is not guaran
teed.
