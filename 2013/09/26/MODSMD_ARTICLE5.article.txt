## Redwood City approves satellite campus 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO DESK EDITOR 
The Redwood City Council recently
approved Stanford's proposal to build a
35-acre satellite campus in the city, west
of Highway 101 and next to the Stanford
Medicine Outpatient Center.
The property will cater to both aca
demic and non-academic uses, though it
will mainly be used by Stanford depart
ments that don't necessarily have to be
located on campus, such as Land Build

ing and Real Estate, Human Resources
and other administrative functions.
The main undergraduate college ex
perience will remain focused on Stan
ford's main campus.
According to Steve Elliott, the Uni
versity's managing director of Develop
ment, Land, Buildings and Real Estate
and vice chairman of Redwood City San
Mateo County Chamber of Commerce,
the prime location of the satellite cam
pus is ideal for such an expansion.
"It's only seven miles from campus,"

Elliott said. "[l]t's close to transit and
it's a big enough property that allows us
to grow in the future."
Redwood City is already home to
about eight percent of Stanford's em
ployees, and provides no dearth of en
tertainment.
"Our downtown area has been thriv
ing," said Alicia Aguirre, mayor of Red
wood City. "Redwood City is now the
cultural center of the peninsula."
While the Stanford investment
rakes in about $15.1 million worth
of public benefits to the city,
Aguirre and Elliott emphasized
that the benefits are more than
monetary, for this marks a new
partner interested in investing in
and serving the city's residents.
"We've spent the last seven
years getting to know the Red
wood City community [and] learn
ing what's important to them," El
liott said, "[which] helped shape
our plans and I think created a re
ally strong relationship with the
community."
While the general response to

Stanford's proposal has been over
whelmingly positive, the one issue
that has been brought up is that of
traffic.
However, the University has
committed to bringing a Mar
guerite shuttle to link the satellite
campus to the Caltrain station, as
well as support existing environ
mentally friendly alternatives
such as carpooling and biking.
The buildings at the new prop
erty, for their part, will use recy
cled water and natural light, ener
gy-efficient water air-conditioning
and heating systems.
"[There's a lack of] open space
in that part of Redwood City and
Stanford is providing a park that
the neighborhood can use," said
Jeff Gee, vice mayor of Redwood
City. "They're helping us address
a number of our infrastructure

problems. We have occasional
flooding in that area ... and Stan
ford will help us address that."
Indeed, a key feature of the en
terprise is the integration of the
Stanford campus into the commu
nity.
"It's going to be Stanford in
Redwood City, and not the other
way round," Aguirre said.
According to Elliott, the long
term agreement stretches over 30
years, and therefore Stanford
does not have any immediate plans
to begin construction.
The next step will be to go
through the design of the build
ings themselves. They hope to
break ground within the next few
years.
