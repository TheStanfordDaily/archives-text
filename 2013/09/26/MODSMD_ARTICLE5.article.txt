## Redwood City approves satellite campus 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO DESK EDITOR 
The Redwood City Council recently
approved Stanford's proposal to build a
35-acre satellite campus in the city, west
of Highway 101 and next to the Stanford
Medicine Outpatient Center.
The property will cater to both aca
demic and non-academic uses, though it
will mainly be used by Stanford depart
ments that don't necessarily have to be
located on campus, such as Land Build

ing and Real Estate, Human Resources
and other administrative functions.
The main undergraduate college ex
perience will remain focused on Stan
ford's main campus.
According to Steve Elliott, the Uni
versity's managing director of Develop
ment, Land, Buildings and Real Estate
and vice chairman of Redwood City San
Mateo County Chamber of Commerce,
the prime location of the satellite cam
pus is ideal for such an expansion.
"It's only seven miles from campus,"

Elliott said. "[l]t's close to transit and
it's a big enough property that allows us
to grow in the future."
Redwood City is already home to
about eight percent of Stanford's em
ployees, and provides no dearth of en
tertainment.
"Our downtown area has been thriv
ing," said Alicia Aguirre, mayor of Red
wood City. "Redwood City is now the
cultural center of the peninsula."
