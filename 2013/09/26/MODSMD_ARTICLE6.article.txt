# Q&A
## ROBYN DUNBAR DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Robyn Dunbar succeeded long
time Director of the Center for
Teaching and Learning (CTL)
Michele Marincovich '6B, who is mov
ing on to become senior advisor to
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Harry Elam. Dunbar brings
14 years of experience to the role as
assistant director for science and en
gineering in the CTL.
With the inauguration of the new
Hume Center for Writing and Speak
ing in Building 250, The Daily sat
down with Dunbar to learn what she
expects of the Center's future.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): The Oral
Communication Program recently
merged with the Hume Writing Cen
ter. What does this mean for the Cen

ter of Teaching and Learning?
Robyn Dunbar (RB): This one part
of the Oral Communication Program,
the Speaker Center, is what has
merged with the Hume Center to
make it the Hume Center for Writing
and Speaking with a beautiful new
place on the Quad conveniently locat
ed for students. I've been over to the
new place a number of times. It's very
visible, but what is not so visible is
that the new program is above and
beyond. It's one space for all those re
sources for students, which is incredi
ble.

TSD: What kind of new events and
workshops is CTL planning to incor
porate for this year?
RB: One thing I think we're doing
new is we're increasing opportunitito

create events to put together facul
ty, grad students and students to
talk about teaching and learning.
It's very common for students to
talk to each other about classes,
and it's very common for faculty to
discuss how they're teaching their
classes, but it's less common for
students, TAs and faculty to sit
around the same table to talk about
teaching and learning. We want to
bring more events that attract
those different voices.

TSD: What are your top priorities
for CTL?
RB: Everyone is time-stressed. In
structors make tough decisions
about what to teach in class in their
limited time and students make
very elaborate strategies over what
to study, what to produce and when.
And honestly, we don't make those
decisions as well as we could. Re
search shows many other ways that
are effective, habits that work bet
ter than memorizing, and we try to
share that knowledge.
As for professors, if they can't do
anything directly to help their stu
dents, we help them develop their
curriculum and teaching methods so
that students retain more of the ma
terial at the end of the year.
We let them know, "What can I,

as a student or professor do on a
daily basis to make learning bet
ter?" We focus on what goes on in
the classroom when the professor
and the student or TA and students
are together, live, and we try to op
timize that experience.

TSD: What problems do you fore
see in the development of your
plans for CTL?
RB: I have to say I'm an optimist
and I don't see any barriers. But
the big one is if we think that this
is solely for CTL, that CTL owns
the success and the initiative for
how learning works. If we take it
as a shared responsibility, it's not
a barrier at all. But if only a hand
ful of people at CTL are trying to
make it happen, it's a barrier.
If there is any kind of barrier,
it's time. Making time and finding
time to grow and implement pro
grams. But I'm incredibly excited.
Working at CTL is a blast. Many
people here care about teaching
and learning, and there is a
tremendous amount of energy on
campus. This is a great place to be
a teaching and learning center.
Everywhere on campus from
highest administration to day-to
dayâ€” values teaching and learn
ing. For me it was a career shift
when I moved from the faculty role
into something like this, and I've
been on cloud nine ever since.
