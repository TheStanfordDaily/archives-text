# Q&A
## ROBYN DUNBAR DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Robyn Dunbar succeeded long
time Director of the Center for
Teaching and Learning (CTL)
Michele Marincovich '6B, who is mov
ing on to become senior advisor to
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Harry Elam. Dunbar brings
14 years of experience to the role as
assistant director for science and en
gineering in the CTL.
With the inauguration of the new
Hume Center for Writing and Speak
ing in Building 250, The Daily sat
down with Dunbar to learn what she
expects of the Center's future.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): The Oral
Communication Program recently
merged with the Hume Writing Cen
ter. What does this mean for the Cen

ter of Teaching and Learning?
Robyn Dunbar (RB): This one part
of the Oral Communication Program,
the Speaker Center, is what has
merged with the Hume Center to
make it the Hume Center for Writing
and Speaking with a beautiful new
place on the Quad conveniently locat
ed for students. I've been over to the
new place a number of times. It's very
visible, but what is not so visible is
that the new program is above and
beyond. It's one space for all those re
sources for students, which is incredi
ble.

TSD: What kind of new events and
workshops is CTL planning to incor
porate for this year?
RB: One thing I think we're doing
new is we're increasing opportunitito
