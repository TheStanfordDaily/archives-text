## TOUGH CALLS A 						LOOK INSIDE STANFORD FOOTBALL'S BRAIN TRUST 
### JOSEPH BEYDA SAM FISHER SPORTS EDITORS 
It's the elephant in the film room of Stanford's oppo
nents a formation so big and heavy that offen
sive coordinator Mike Bloomgren can almost feel
the ground shake when he sends it out onto the
field.
Few short-yardage formations in college football are
as intimidating as the Cardinal's 3,200-pound behemoth.
As if the seven offensive linemen at the line of scrimmage
aren't enough for a defense to handle, there's two more
300-pounders in the backfield as well, forming a triangle
with the running back.
"When you've got a guy like Josh Garnett or Johnny
Caspers in the backfield and they're coming downhill,
there's certain rules of physics that apply," Bloomgren
said of the two sophomore guards. "An object in motion
tends to stay in motion. We believe in that fully."
With the elephant formation in hand for short
yardage situations, it's no surprise that Stanford's third
down conversion percentage of .610 is fifth best in the na
tion. Believe it or not, though, the Cardinal has rarely
gone for it on fourth down this season. Stanford has made
it to fourth down 15 times in three games, and the offense
has only lined up for a conversion twice, both on fourth
and-1. One of those plays resulted in a garbage-time in
completion; the other one ended in a defensive substitu
tion penalty.
In several cases, the Cardinal has passed up a fourth
down conversion opportunity that, mathematically would
be a better choice than kicking a field goal or punting it
away. There is statistical ev
idence to suggest that a foot
ball team should go for it,
say, on fourth-and-8 from an
opponent's 36-yard line or on
fourth-and goal from the 3 or
7 three situations in
which Stanford has already
resorted to special teams
this year.
It's not that the Cardi
nal's coaches are unaware of
the data out there. The staff
simply believes that there's
more to the equation.
"The role of statistics
[for us] is what the defense
is showing, what they've
shown before," Bloomgren
said. "Are they a high-pres
sure team? Do we like the
front? Do we feel like we've
got great plays for said
front? Where are we at?
And do we like our
matchups? ... It's not so
much like the statistics of
how many fourth-and-l's
are converted, or any of that
stuff. It's how we feel about
us."
That's why former quar
terback Andrew Luck 'l2,

for example, got a longer
leash on fourth downs when
he was playing for the Car
dinal.
As for Stanford's oppo
nents, the staff seeks the an
swers to those questions
early in game week, during
film study; the last thing the
coaches want to do is to be
caught off guard and let
their emotions take over
during a game. But there's
still some work to be done
on Saturdays.
As a potential fourth
down situation approaches
on gameday, the discussion
flows back and forth over
the coaches' radio headsets.
According to head coach
David Shaw, the two main
factors being evaluated by
the staff are field position
and momentum.
"Are we in good field po
sition to where, with our de
fense, we feel good about
if we don't make it being
where we are?" Shaw ex
plained. "And secondly, are
we feeling good about the
play? Are we feeling good
about how we're playing? Do
we feel like we have some
kind of an advantage,
whether it's personnel or
schematic?"
Though the final decision

is left up to Shaw, finding
those advantages is a team
effort. From his eyes in the
press box, quarterbacks and
wide receivers coach Mike
Sanford advises Shaw on the
passing game; tight ends
coach Morgan Turner, also
sitting up top, helps Bloom
gren keep an eye on the run
ning game.
"I think the biggest thing
is making the decision that
takes your own ego out of
[it] and puts the football
team's best interest at hand,"
Sanford said. "There's some
decision-makers that proba
bly think, 'Hey, I want to be
known as the guy who's a
riverboat gambler.' I think
the biggest thing is just
knowing the situation,
knowing the emotions lead
ing up to that exact down,
and then making that deci
sion [in] the best interest of
your football team."
So, even though the Car
dinal takes a lot of pride in
its strength upfront, it won't
be trotting out the Elephant
every time fourth-and-short
arrives. At least for the
ground's sake, maybe that's
for the best.

It's not that the Cardi
nal's coaches are unaware of
the data out there. The staff
simply believes that there's
more to the equation.
"The role of statistics
[for us] is what the defense
is showing, what they've
shown before," Bloomgren
said. "Are they a high-pres
sure team? Do we like the
front? Do we feel like we've
got great plays for said
front? Where are we at?
And do we like our
matchups? ... It's not so
much like the statistics of
how many fourth-and-l's
are converted, or any of that
stuff. It's how we feel about
us."
That's why former quar
terback Andrew Luck 'l2,

for example, got a longer
leash on fourth downs when
he was playing for the Car
dinal.
As for Stanford's oppo
nents, the staff seeks the an
swers to those questions
early in game week, during
film study; the last thing the
coaches want to do is to be
caught off guard and let
their emotions take over
during a game. But there's
still some work to be done
on Saturdays.
As a potential fourth
down situation approaches
on gameday, the discussion
flows back and forth over
the coaches' radio headsets.
According to head coach
David Shaw, the two main
factors being evaluated by
the staff are field position
and momentum.
"Are we in good field po
sition to where, with our de
fense, we feel good about
if we don't make it being
where we are?" Shaw ex
plained. "And secondly, are
we feeling good about the
play? Are we feeling good
about how we're playing? Do
we feel like we have some
kind of an advantage,
whether it's personnel or
schematic?"
Though the final decision

is left up to Shaw, finding
those advantages is a team
effort. From his eyes in the
press box, quarterbacks and
wide receivers coach Mike
Sanford advises Shaw on the
passing game; tight ends
coach Morgan Turner, also
sitting up top, helps Bloom
gren keep an eye on the run
ning game.
"I think the biggest thing
is making the decision that
takes your own ego out of
[it] and puts the football
team's best interest at hand,"
Sanford said. "There's some
decision-makers that proba
bly think, 'Hey, I want to be
known as the guy who's a
riverboat gambler.' I think
the biggest thing is just
knowing the situation,
knowing the emotions lead
ing up to that exact down,
and then making that deci
sion [in] the best interest of
your football team."
So, even though the Car
dinal takes a lot of pride in
its strength upfront, it won't
be trotting out the Elephant
every time fourth-and-short
arrives. At least for the
ground's sake, maybe that's
for the best.
