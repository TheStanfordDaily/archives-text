## TOUGH CALLS A
						LOOK INSIDE STANFORD FOOTBALL'S BRAIN TRUST 
### JOSEPH BEYDA SAM FISHER SPORTS EDITORS 
It's the elephant in the film room of Stanford's oppo
nents a formation so big and heavy that offen
sive coordinator Mike Bloomgren can almost feel
the ground shake when he sends it out onto the
field.
Few short-yardage formations in college football are
as intimidating as the Cardinal's 3,200-pound behemoth.
As if the seven offensive linemen at the line of scrimmage
aren't enough for a defense to handle, there's two more
300-pounders in the backfield as well, forming a triangle
with the running back.
"When you've got a guy like Josh Garnett or Johnny
Caspers in the backfield and they're coming downhill,
there's certain rules of physics that apply," Bloomgren
said of the two sophomore guards. "An object in motion
tends to stay in motion. We believe in that fully."
With the elephant formation in hand for short
yardage situations, it's no surprise that Stanford's third
down conversion percentage of .610 is fifth best in the na
tion. Believe it or not, though, the Cardinal has rarely
gone for it on fourth down this season. Stanford has made
it to fourth down 15 times in three games, and the offense
has only lined up for a conversion twice, both on fourth
and-1. One of those plays resulted in a garbage-time in
completion; the other one ended in a defensive substitu
tion penalty.
In several cases, the Cardinal has passed up a fourth
down conversion opportunity that, mathematically would
be a better choice than kicking a field goal or punting it
