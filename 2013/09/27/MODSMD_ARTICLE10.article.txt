## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Introducing The Stanford Daily Weekend Edition 
### 
Dear Reader,

While The Stanford Daily is a
newsroom and a business, it
must be above all a classroom,
a place where students can
hone the skills necessary to become profes
sionals in journalism and in other fields
after we leave The Farm.
In 2013, that means incisive reporting,
stories that capture a fleeting moment of
Stanford life, whether it is through text, im
age or data. If the pages of The Daily are a plat
form for hands-on journalism education, we
must acknowledge the newspaper's short
comings. Chief among them is an inability to
properly showcase student photography,
graphics and layout on the traditional broad
sheet.
The product you are reading today is our
first attempt at emphasizing the power of vi
sual journalism in the print version of The
Stanford Daily. Every Friday, The Daily will fo
cus on one aspect of campus life and combine
it with expanded coverage in sports, the arts
and campus commentary. In a tabloid size
that allows us to customize each page accord
ing to the story at hand, The Stanford Daily
Weekender seeks to package our journalism
in away that lives up to its quality.
In many ways, today's newspaper repre
sents a cautious first step in The Daily's trans
formation from a traditional publishing house
to a dynamic media company.
Three months ago, I approached what
would become my editorial team with a sim
ple prospect: If you had unlimited time and
resources, what would you create? This is the
result of our effort. I hope it is something that
you will enjoy.
Thank you for reading,
