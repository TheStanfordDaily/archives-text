# We can do better for the arts

### Alli Rath 
I don't often publicize one of the
main reasons I declared as an art
major. When someone espe
cially a Stanford someone asks
why you chose such an uncommon
major, how can you possibly reply,
"Well, I do love art, but in all hon
esty, I declared in large part so I
would not get denied entrance to
Stanford's art classes"? Unfortunate
ly, this reasoning is not unique to my
situation; two other recent graduates
admitted to me that their primary
aim in declaring was to guarantee ad
mission to art classes.

In 2006, Stanford launched the
Stanford Arts Initiative, which is a
"university-wide effort to enhance
strengths in existing arts programs
[and] create new arts facilities and
opportunities for students and facul
ty," according to its website. Stan
ford has undertaken such admirable
and ambitious projects as the con
struction of the Bing Concert Hall
(completed in 2013), and the future
development of an arts district with
the McMurtry Building for Art and
Art History (expected to be complet
ed in 2015), complemented by the
new Anderson Collection, which fea
tures the work of famed contempo
rary artists like Jackson Pollock and
William de Kooning.

In spite of such impressive and
flashy endeavors, Stanford has failed
to address numerous issues within
the Arts Practice Department, most
prominent of which is the massive
over-enrollment of art classes stem
ming from an insufficient number of
full-time faculty members.
On the one hand, this is not nec
essarily a bad problem to have. The
fact that so many students are excit
ed by the arts and interested in cre
ating their own work implies that
perhaps the humanities at Stanford
do have a promising future; perhaps

a liberal arts education has not yet
been sacrificed to the startup gods of
Silicon Valley.

And yet, I fail to see the point of
encouraging curiosity in the arts if
Stanford then turns away the major
ity of students attempting to enroll
in art courses. In one drawing course
during my sophomore year, 70 stu
dents showed up for a class that
could handle a maximum of 15 stu
dents. Other courses last year
showed rejections ranging from 47
to 10 students, with many classes of
ten rejecting half of the students
who sought to enroll.

This overflow problem can be
traced to a basic lack of full-time pro
fessors. There are currently seven
full-time visual arts faculty members,
all of whom teach full course loads.
In 2003, there were nine faculty
members, but over the next decade
the number of teachers dropped as
low as six.

One art professor shared that
the Art Department faculty and staff
feel strongly the stress and frustra
tion of denying so many students ac
cess to the classes, but there is no
way to accommodate more students
without more teachers.

The Art Department has been
forced to adopt a policy of seniority
when choosing which students will
be permitted to enroll. While an un
derstandable tactic, I have to think
that there may have been potential
art majors and minors among the
freshmen and sophomores turned
away. With only 10 current majors
and nine minors among all four class
es, this is a huge loss. Furthermore,
many non-majors miss the opportu
nity to develop or continue their pas
sions in art. A potential avenue
worth exploring (which, like any vi-
able solution, requires more pro
fessors) would be the introduc
tion of more two-unit art classes
geared toward the average stu
dent.

This problem seems to have
bled over into other artistic ma
jors at Stanford, specifically Ar
chitectural Design and Music.
Annie Fryman 'l4, an architec
ture major, explained, "Architec
tural Design is an "arts" program
that gets engineering money and
resources but still has trouble
finding money for professors and
classes."

The Introduction to Architec
ture class, although an introduc
tory seminar, is a prerequisite for
much of the Architecture core.
This class usually sees 200-plus
percent enrollment. Annie
summed up the issue: "It's basi
cally a gateway to the depart
ment, so we have found it kind of
frustrating that the number of
majors we have has been limited
to how many quarters of that
class we have had the resources
to teach."

The Music Department has
had a similar experience, stem
ming from an inappropriate allo
cation of resources to flashier
projects. According to the Music
students I have spoken with,
classroom sizes are generally not
adequate for the type of music
being taught. Sometimes the

room is small and cramped, re
sulting in a room crammed with
pianos to the point of poor
acoustics.
Other times, the rooms are
too big, which also causes
acoustical issues. One junior in
the Music Department expressed
frustration with the subjective man
ner in which students are turned
away. In one class with 200 percent
enrollment, the professor went
around the room and asked stu
dents various questions, deciding
on the spot who he felt "deserved"
to be accepted to the class.
These issues are not the only
ones facing the arts at Stanford
right now, but it is a good place to
start. According to an Art Depart
ment faculty member, in order
for Stanford to hire a new profes
sor, there must be $1,000,000 in
escrow. The cost of all of these
new buildings so far eclipses the
cost of hiring a handful of new
faculty for these departments;
these hiring decisions should be
easy for an institution claiming a
commitment to the arts and hu
manities.

When considering that the
average residential college at Yale
has its own artistic space (ranging
from pottery studios and printing
presses to woodshops), how can
Stanford University not feel
ashamed that the majority of its
students cannot even be accepted
to an introductory drawing class?
