# We can do better for the arts

I don't often publicize one of the
main reasons I declared as an art
major. When someone espe
cially a Stanford someone asks
why you chose such an uncommon
major, how can you possibly reply,
"Well, I do love art, but in all hon
esty, I declared in large part so I
would not get denied entrance to
Stanford's art classes"? Unfortunate
ly, this reasoning is not unique to my
situation; two other recent graduates
admitted to me that their primary
aim in declaring was to guarantee ad
mission to art classes.

In 2006, Stanford launched the
Stanford Arts Initiative, which is a
"university-wide effort to enhance
strengths in existing arts programs
[and] create new arts facilities and
opportunities for students and facul
ty," according to its website. Stan
ford has undertaken such admirable
and ambitious projects as the con
struction of the Bing Concert Hall
(completed in 2013), and the future
development of an arts district with
the McMurtry Building for Art and
Art History (expected to be complet
ed in 2015), complemented by the
new Anderson Collection, which fea
tures the work of famed contempo
rary artists like Jackson Pollock and
William de Kooning.

In spite of such impressive and
flashy endeavors, Stanford has failed
to address numerous issues within
the Arts Practice Department, most
prominent of which is the massive
over-enrollment of art classes stem
ming from an insufficient number of
full-time faculty members.
On the one hand, this is not nec
essarily a bad problem to have. The
fact that so many students are excit
ed by the arts and interested in cre
ating their own work implies that
perhaps the humanities at Stanford
do have a promising future; perhaps

a liberal arts education has not yet
been sacrificed to the startup gods of
Silicon Valley.

And yet, I fail to see the point of
encouraging curiosity in the arts if
Stanford then turns away the major
ity of students attempting to enroll
in art courses. In one drawing course
during my sophomore year, 70 stu
dents showed up for a class that
could handle a maximum of 15 stu
dents. Other courses last year
showed rejections ranging from 47
to 10 students, with many classes of
ten rejecting half of the students
who sought to enroll.

This overflow problem can be
traced to a basic lack of full-time pro
fessors. There are currently seven
full-time visual arts faculty members,
all of whom teach full course loads.
In 2003, there were nine faculty
members, but over the next decade
the number of teachers dropped as
low as six.

One art professor shared that
the Art Department faculty and staff
feel strongly the stress and frustra
tion of denying so many students ac
cess to the classes, but there is no
way to accommodate more students
without more teachers.

The Art Department has been
forced to adopt a policy of seniority
when choosing which students will
be permitted to enroll. While an un
derstandable tactic, I have to think
that there may have been potential
art majors and minors among the
freshmen and sophomores turned
away. With only 10 current majors
and nine minors among all four class
es, this is a huge loss. Furthermore,
many non-majors miss the opportu
nity to develop or continue their pas
sions in art. A potential avenue
worth exploring (which, like any vi-
