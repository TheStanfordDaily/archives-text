## CARD TRAVELS LIGHT TO SEATTLE Stanford heads back to site of 2012 UW loss, CenturyLink Field 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Stanford doesn't have fond
memories of Century Link Field:
the one-hoppers from Josh Nunes,
the drop by Ty Montgomery, the
game-sealing offside penalty com
mitted by Ben Gardner. Three
hundred sixty-five days ago on
that Thursday night in Seattle,
less than two weeks after Stan
ford had upset then-No. 2 USC,
unranked Washington brought the
Cardinal back down to earth in a
stunning 17-13 victory.
Tomorrow, No. 5 Stanford (3-
0, 1-0 Pac-12) hopes to avoid a
similar letdown when it takes on
Washington State (3-1, 1-0) in
Seattle. Despite a shaky fourth
quarter against Arizona State last
weekend, the Cardinal is coming
off a statement win and looks to
keep its momentum heading into
the middle segment of the season

a task that it failed to accom
plish last year. And once again, the
test will come within the hostile
confines of Century Link Field.
"We have to be cautious,"
said head coach David Shaw. "The
noise is a factor."

Despite going into last year's
contest against the Cardinal with

a 2-5 record, Washington State
kept things close at Stanford Sta
dium. Only a timely sack by defen
sive end Henry Anderson allowed
the Cardinal to eke out an uncon
vincing 24-17 victory, prompting
Shaw to tell his team after the
game, "The sand is dripping
through the hourglass."
There's reason to expect that
Wazzu will put up another tough
fight tomorrow, especially consid
ering that Mike Leach has had
time to refine his "air raid" in his
second year as the Cougars head
coach. At the helm of Washington
State's spread offense is quarter
back Connor Halliday, who has

completed 66 percent of his pass
es for 1,288 yards and 10 touch
downs but has also thrown eight
interceptions. A product of
Leach's pass-happy system, Halli
day has attempted 187 passes
through the first four games of
the season.

"The [Cougars] offense is
clicking," Shaw said. "You see
guys with a great understanding
not that it didn't happen last
year but the receiving corps
[is] more consistent now, and the
quarterbacks [have been] in it for
more than just a year."
"They're going to spread us

out," added fifth-year senior de
fensive Ben Gardner, who had a
big game last Saturday with a
blocked punt. "They're going to
throw it 60 times probably, and
they're going to try to get the ball
out quick... I think that they've
seen a lot of the teams that have
played them this season so far use
some of the pressure we used on
them last year, and they've seen
them and adjusted to them. We'll
have to show some new looks to
them."

The Cougar offensive line
seems to have improved the pro
tection issues that plagued the

team in 2012. Wazzu allowed the
Cardinal defense alone to record
10 sacks last season; so far this

year, it has given up only seven.
To make matters even more
difficult, Stanford senior free safe
ty Ed Reynolds will sit out the first
half as punishment for a targeting
penalty he drew in the fourth
quarter in last Saturday's game
against ASU. Though the coaching
staff expressed full confidence in
senior Devon Carrington's ability
to fill in for Reynolds, the combi
nation of Stanford's tenuous

GAME NOTES: Stanford will be without two
preseason Ail-Americans in the first
half, left guard David Yankey (family sit
uation) and free safety Ed Reynolds
(one-half suspension). The Cougars
have already equaled their win total
from 2012, and are hoping to become
the second team from the Evergreen
State to upset Stanford at Century Link
Field in as many years.

Senior running back Tyler Gaffney (above) may have rushed for 5.6 yards per carry in the Cardinal's first three
games of 2013, but he will be missing his best blocker, senior left guard David Yankey, when No. 5 Stanford
travels to Seattle to play Washington State this Saturday. Yankey will miss the game due to a family situation.
depth in the secondary and the need to ro
tate defenders against Wazzu's up-tempo
offense will make it all the more important
for the front seven to apply constant pres
sure on Halliday.
"It might be a little frustrating because
[Halliday] is going to get the ball out quick,
but we have to keep coming and make tack
les on their playmakers in space," Gardner
said. "And then when we get the chance to
hit the quarterback, we have to hit him and
put him down."
On the other side of the ball, the Car
dinal will have to play without its best play
er, left guard David Yankey. The preseason
Ail-American will miss tomorrow's game

due a "family situation," Shaw explained af
ter Tuesday's practice. In line with the
next-man-up philosophy, sophomore guard
Joshua Garnett will make his first career
start, getting the chance to pull in the Car
dinal power running game.
Behind the offensive line, junior quar
terback Kevin Hogan hopes to continue his
early-season efficiency and hit a few
more deep throws while senior running
back Tyler Gaffney is looking for his third
100-yard rushing game. It won't be easy,
though, against a Cougars defense that has
tightened up this year. After allowing 31
points to Auburn in its season opener, Waz
zu has given up just 17 points in its last
three games, including a 10-7 shutdown of
an offensively handicapped USC team and
a 42-0 shutout of Idaho last Saturday.
"The one thing no one talks about

ever â€” when you're talking about Mike
Leach is the defense," Shaw said. "Defen
sively, they're playing really well. They're
playing hard and extremely sound defense.
You don't see a lot of big runs or passes;
you see guys where they're supposed to be
and making tackles. They've got athletes.
They've got guys who can run and are ag
gressive. That's one huge factor, I think, for
how well they're playing."
Tomorrow's game is slated for a 7 p.m.
kickoff, with national television coverage
on ESPN.

Senior running back Tyler Gaffney (above) may have rushed for 5.6 yards per carry in the Cardinal's first three
games of 2013, but he will be missing his best blocker, senior left guard David Yankey, when No. 5 Stanford
travels to Seattle to play Washington State this Saturday. Yankey will miss the game due to a family situation.
depth in the secondary and the need to ro
tate defenders against Wazzu's up-tempo
offense will make it all the more important
for the front seven to apply constant pres
sure on Halliday.
"It might be a little frustrating because
[Halliday] is going to get the ball out quick,
but we have to keep coming and make tack
les on their playmakers in space," Gardner
said. "And then when we get the chance to
hit the quarterback, we have to hit him and
put him down."
On the other side of the ball, the Car
dinal will have to play without its best play
er, left guard David Yankey. The preseason
Ail-American will miss tomorrow's game

due a "family situation," Shaw explained af
ter Tuesday's practice. In line with the
next-man-up philosophy, sophomore guard
Joshua Garnett will make his first career
start, getting the chance to pull in the Car
dinal power running game.
Behind the offensive line, junior quar
terback Kevin Hogan hopes to continue his
early-season efficiency and hit a few
more deep throws while senior running
back Tyler Gaffney is looking for his third
100-yard rushing game. It won't be easy,
though, against a Cougars defense that has
tightened up this year. After allowing 31
points to Auburn in its season opener, Waz
zu has given up just 17 points in its last
three games, including a 10-7 shutdown of
an offensively handicapped USC team and
a 42-0 shutout of Idaho last Saturday.
"The one thing no one talks about

ever â€” when you're talking about Mike
Leach is the defense," Shaw said. "Defen
sively, they're playing really well. They're
playing hard and extremely sound defense.
You don't see a lot of big runs or passes;
you see guys where they're supposed to be
and making tackles. They've got athletes.
They've got guys who can run and are ag
gressive. That's one huge factor, I think, for
how well they're playing."
Tomorrow's game is slated for a 7 p.m.
kickoff, with national television coverage
on ESPN.

Stanford doesn't have fond
memories of Century Link Field:
the one-hoppers from Josh Nunes,
the drop by Ty Montgomery, the
game-sealing offside penalty com
mitted by Ben Gardner. Three
hundred sixty-five days ago on
that Thursday night in Seattle,
less than two weeks after Stan
ford had upset then-No. 2 USC,
unranked Washington brought the
Cardinal back down to earth in a
stunning 17-13 victory.
Tomorrow, No. 5 Stanford (3-
0, 1-0 Pac-12) hopes to avoid a
similar letdown when it takes on
Washington State (3-1, 1-0) in
Seattle. Despite a shaky fourth
quarter against Arizona State last
weekend, the Cardinal is coming
off a statement win and looks to
keep its momentum heading into
the middle segment of the season

a task that it failed to accom
plish last year. And once again, the
test will come within the hostile
confines of Century Link Field.
"We have to be cautious,"
said head coach David Shaw. "The
noise is a factor."

Despite going into last year's
contest against the Cardinal with

a 2-5 record, Washington State
kept things close at Stanford Sta
dium. Only a timely sack by defen
sive end Henry Anderson allowed
the Cardinal to eke out an uncon
vincing 24-17 victory, prompting
Shaw to tell his team after the
game, "The sand is dripping
through the hourglass."
There's reason to expect that
Wazzu will put up another tough
fight tomorrow, especially consid
ering that Mike Leach has had
time to refine his "air raid" in his
second year as the Cougars head
coach. At the helm of Washington
State's spread offense is quarter
back Connor Halliday, who has

completed 66 percent of his pass
es for 1,288 yards and 10 touch
downs but has also thrown eight
interceptions. A product of
Leach's pass-happy system, Halli
day has attempted 187 passes
through the first four games of
the season.

"The [Cougars] offense is
clicking," Shaw said. "You see
guys with a great understanding
not that it didn't happen last
year but the receiving corps
[is] more consistent now, and the
quarterbacks [have been] in it for
more than just a year."
"They're going to spread us

out," added fifth-year senior de
fensive Ben Gardner, who had a
big game last Saturday with a
blocked punt. "They're going to
throw it 60 times probably, and
they're going to try to get the ball
out quick... I think that they've
seen a lot of the teams that have
played them this season so far use
some of the pressure we used on
them last year, and they've seen
them and adjusted to them. We'll
have to show some new looks to
them."

The Cougar offensive line
seems to have improved the pro
tection issues that plagued the

team in 2012. Wazzu allowed the
Cardinal defense alone to record
10 sacks last season; so far this

year, it has given up only seven.
To make matters even more
difficult, Stanford senior free safe
ty Ed Reynolds will sit out the first
half as punishment for a targeting
penalty he drew in the fourth
quarter in last Saturday's game
against ASU. Though the coaching
staff expressed full confidence in
senior Devon Carrington's ability
to fill in for Reynolds, the combi
nation of Stanford's tenuous
