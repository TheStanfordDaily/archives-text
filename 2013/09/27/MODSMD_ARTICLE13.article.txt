# First half crucial for Stanford
## 
### WHAT TO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
The parallels are everywhere:
A 3-0 Stanford team heads to
Centurylink Field to take on
an unranked but upstart
school from the state of Washington for
a prime-time matchup on ESPN.
So where will the parallels end?
Stanford hopes that nothing Satur
day will resemble 2012's Thursday
night debacle —well, maybe except
for a pick-six from fifth-year senior
outside linebacker Trent Murphy.
The tricky part for Stanford is
that the Cardinal will be nowhere
near full-strength, especially in the
first half. Senior defensive end Hen
ry Anderson will be out for the sec
ond straight week with his knee in
jury, senior safety Ed Reynolds is sus
pended for the first half due to an
ejection for targeting against Arizona
State, senior left guard David Yankey
is out for family reasons and senior
cornerback Barry Browning is ques
tionable due to a lingering injury suf
fered against Army.
Those absences prompt my first
key to the game: winning the first
half. With Washington State's home
field advantage and Stanford's
reshuffled, short-handed lineup, the
Cougars have an opportunity to deliv
er the first blow. If Stanford struggles
to control the ball on offense, Waz
zu's air-raid offensive attack could
present serious problems that will
compound every time Stanford's de

fense has to step out onto the field with
out enough time to rest. I can envision
a scenario in which this game could
quickly turn ugly, leaving Stanford with
an uphill battle in the second half when
Reynolds returns and Stanford's
younger replacements will have settled
down.

On a related note, perhaps the best
way to earn rest against the potent
Washington State offense is to force
quarterback Connor Halliday into
turnovers. Halliday has put up great
numbers in many categories 66 per
cent completion and 322 yards per
game are nothing to scoff at but he
has a turnover problem (8 interceptions
in four games). The challenge for the
Cardinal is that Stanford's best ball hawk
(Reynolds) is suspended for the first half.

Look for his replacement, senior Devon
Carrington, to step up and potentially
snag his first career interception. He's
no stranger to big plays just ask Ore
gon quarterback Marcus Mariota.
Historically, Washington State has
presented Stanford's offense some sur
prising problems, even when the
Cougar defense is unheralded. This sea
son, though the offenses Wazzu has
faced haven't been very strong, head
coach Mike Leach's defense has im
pressed critics. Stanford's offense, led
by junior quarterback Kevin Hogan and
senior running back Tyler Gaffney, will
be the most potent competition for
Wazzu by far, but that doesn't necessar
ily mean the Cougars will fold.
For some reason, Washington
State has always given Stanford's run
ning game trouble. It will be up to
Hogan to get the Cardinal into the right
looks and Gaffney to capitalize behind a
Yankey-less offensive line. In 2012, the

Cougars sold out to stop Stanford's
rushing attack and it worked: The Car
dinal averaged only 3.2 yards per carry.
However, that game represented one of
the lowest points of Stanford's passing
offense and led to Hogan's replacement
of quarterback Josh Nunes. With
Hogan's improvement and the emer
gence of junior wide receiver Ty Mont
gomery, Stanford's multi-dimensional
attack should open up the Cardinal's
rushing and passing offenses. If either
unit slacks, Wazzu could potentially shut
Stanford down and put a big scare into
Shaw and Co.

And we all know how loud Centu
ry Link Field will be if that happens.
