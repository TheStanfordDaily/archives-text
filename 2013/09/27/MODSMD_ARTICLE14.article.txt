# BACK AND FORTH WITH WSU

### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's football game be
tween Stanford and Washington State, The
Daily's David Cohn chatted with Nate Han
son, the radio sports director of the Cougars'
student radio station, KUGR, to get perspec
tive from both camps. Below is a partial tran
script of their conversation. For the full back
and-forth, go to www.StanfordDaily.com/
category/sports.

David Cohn (DC): First of all, what are your
initial thoughts on this Saturday's matchup?

Nate Hanson (NH): It's going to be a tell-all
for the Cougs. Since the hiring of Mike Leach
there has been the expectation of returning
WSU football back toward the top of the Pac
-12. This is the game that all Coug fans could

look back on as the signature win that Leach
has turned this program around.

DC: I can definitely see that. From my perspec
tive, it certainly seems like WSU is taking this
game very seriously. I don't believe it is too
much of a stretch to call this matchup WSU's
biggest game of the year, since this contest was
designated as WSU's "Seattle Showcase." This
is a showcase for the Cougs on the national
stage of ESPN, at an NFL stadium now known
for being the loudest in the record books, to
make a statement against a top-five team.
Could you describe what you expect the at
mosphere to be like on Saturday, and maybe
correct this report, since I heard only 35,000
tickets have been sold by WSU for a stadium
that seats almost double that number?

NH: The atmosphere for the Cougs in the an-

nual Seattle game has never matched that of
Martin Stadium in Pullman. Even last year
when the Cougs took on No. 2 Oregon, the
atmosphere was not nearly as riotous as it is
in Pullman. The students are put into the
back end of one end zone instead of spread
from one goal line to the 50, like in Martin
Stadium. That report that only 35,000 tickets
have been sold is true. I know the university
expects the crowd to be closer to 40,000. In
all honesty it's hard to call it a "home" game
because Seattle is a six-hour drive from Pull
man. I know it all sounds pretty negative, but
the crowd won't be silent. They will be loud
and ready to go as the No. 5 team in the
country takes the field. It's just not the same
as true home game though.

DC: It is interesting that you say that, since
Oregon certainly had its troubles in the first
half with WSU, with the noise and the envi
ronment. From Stanford's perspective, I
know that the Cardinal will not be taking this
road trip for granted at all, given what hap
pened last year to the Card when it traveled
to Seattle after winning a nationally televised
game at home. I would not expect any hang
over from the victory over ASU, especially
given the sour taste that was left in every

one's mouth after the fourth quarter from
that game. From WSU's standpoint, what im
pact, if any, has the road victory over USC
had on the team's confidence heading into
this matchup?

NH: It was a huge confidence-builder for the
team, especially after losing to Auburn in a
game the Cougs should have won. Anytime
you can go into the Coliseum and beat USC,
regardless of how good the Trojans are, it's an
accomplishment. It showed that this team
can win a Pac-12 game, and they can do it on
the road. Also, the offense had no success
moving the ball against the Trojans. The only
offensive points of the game came on the
game-winning field goal. Yet, the defense was
stout and held the Trojans to seven points. It
showed that this team isn't just about the of
fense. They're more physical and complete
this year. USC has top-notch athletes, and I
think it gave WSU the little nudge it needed
to believe they can beat anybody.

DC: Defensively, who do you think is WSU's
most important player in trying to slow down
a Stanford offense that scored seemingly at
will for three quarters against ASU?

NH: Darryl Monroe, the MIKE linebacker.
He is the captain of the defense. Stanford
likes to run the ball, and it is going to be up
to Monroe to crash from the linebacker spot

to stop Tyler Gaffney. He also makes all the
calls defensively when it comes to audibles,
so he needs to make sure everyone is in the
right position. The Cougs are smaller than
Stanford so it will be important that every
one is in the right spots in order to slow the
run game down.

DC: Finally, give me a score. Who wins, by
how much and why?

NH: The Cougs defense will be better than
outsiders will expect. In the end it will be on
Connor Halliday. He has to make better deci
sions than he has the last two seasons. I say
Stanford 31-17.1 think Stanford will be too
physical, and I don't think Halliday can sud
denly get over his mental mistakes.

DC: It is funny, that is the exact scoreline I
was going to go with too. However, in order
to not repeat predictions, I am going to go
with Stanford 34-20. Stanford's offense was
great last weekend, and I think Kevin Hogan
picks up where he left off last week. Defen
sively, I think the Cardinal will bend but not
break, much like in their performance
against WSU last year. I don't think they will
have 10 sacks this year, but they will create
enough pressure to help the Card win.

man. I know it all sounds pretty negative, but
the crowd won't be silent. They will be loud
and ready to go as the No. 5 team in the
country takes the field. It's just not the same
as true home game though.

DC: It is interesting that you say that, since
Oregon certainly had its troubles in the first
half with WSU, with the noise and the envi
ronment. From Stanford's perspective, I
know that the Cardinal will not be taking this
road trip for granted at all, given what hap
pened last year to the Card when it traveled
to Seattle after winning a nationally televised
game at home. I would not expect any hang
over from the victory over ASU, especially
given the sour taste that was left in every

one's mouth after the fourth quarter from
that game. From WSU's standpoint, what im
pact, if any, has the road victory over USC
had on the team's confidence heading into
this matchup?

NH: It was a huge confidence-builder for the
team, especially after losing to Auburn in a
game the Cougs should have won. Anytime
you can go into the Coliseum and beat USC,
regardless of how good the Trojans are, it's an
accomplishment. It showed that this team
can win a Pac-12 game, and they can do it on
the road. Also, the offense had no success
moving the ball against the Trojans. The only
offensive points of the game came on the
game-winning field goal. Yet, the defense was
stout and held the Trojans to seven points. It
showed that this team isn't just about the of
fense. They're more physical and complete
this year. USC has top-notch athletes, and I
think it gave WSU the little nudge it needed
to believe they can beat anybody.

DC: Defensively, who do you think is WSU's
most important player in trying to slow down
a Stanford offense that scored seemingly at
will for three quarters against ASU?

NH: Darryl Monroe, the MIKE linebacker.
He is the captain of the defense. Stanford
likes to run the ball, and it is going to be up
to Monroe to crash from the linebacker spot

to stop Tyler Gaffney. He also makes all the
calls defensively when it comes to audibles,
so he needs to make sure everyone is in the
right position. The Cougs are smaller than
Stanford so it will be important that every
one is in the right spots in order to slow the
run game down.

DC: Finally, give me a score. Who wins, by
how much and why?

NH: The Cougs defense will be better than
outsiders will expect. In the end it will be on
Connor Halliday. He has to make better deci
sions than he has the last two seasons. I say
Stanford 31-17.1 think Stanford will be too
physical, and I don't think Halliday can sud
denly get over his mental mistakes.

DC: It is funny, that is the exact scoreline I
was going to go with too. However, in order
to not repeat predictions, I am going to go
with Stanford 34-20. Stanford's offense was
great last weekend, and I think Kevin Hogan
picks up where he left off last week. Defen
sively, I think the Cardinal will bend but not
break, much like in their performance
against WSU last year. I don't think they will
have 10 sacks this year, but they will create
enough pressure to help the Card win.

In advance of Saturday's football game be
tween Stanford and Washington State, The
Daily's David Cohn chatted with Nate Han
son, the radio sports director of the Cougars'
student radio station, KUGR, to get perspec
tive from both camps. Below is a partial tran
script of their conversation. For the full back
and-forth, go to www.StanfordDaily.com/
category/sports.

David Cohn (DC): First of all, what are your
initial thoughts on this Saturday's matchup?

Nate Hanson (NH): It's going to be a tell-all
for the Cougs. Since the hiring of Mike Leach
there has been the expectation of returning
WSU football back toward the top of the Pac
-12. This is the game that all Coug fans could

look back on as the signature win that Leach
has turned this program around.

DC: I can definitely see that. From my perspec
tive, it certainly seems like WSU is taking this
game very seriously. I don't believe it is too
much of a stretch to call this matchup WSU's
biggest game of the year, since this contest was
designated as WSU's "Seattle Showcase." This
is a showcase for the Cougs on the national
stage of ESPN, at an NFL stadium now known
for being the loudest in the record books, to
make a statement against a top-five team.
Could you describe what you expect the at
mosphere to be like on Saturday, and maybe
correct this report, since I heard only 35,000
tickets have been sold by WSU for a stadium
that seats almost double that number?

NH: The atmosphere for the Cougs in the an-

build a bigger cushion on the road Saturday.
nual Seattle game has never matched that of
Martin Stadium in Pullman. Even last year
when the Cougs took on No. 2 Oregon, the
atmosphere was not nearly as riotous as it is
in Pullman. The students are put into the
back end of one end zone instead of spread
from one goal line to the 50, like in Martin
Stadium. That report that only 35,000 tickets
have been sold is true. I know the university
expects the crowd to be closer to 40,000. In
all honesty it's hard to call it a "home" game
because Seattle is a six-hour drive from Pull
man. I know it all sounds pretty negative, but
the crowd won't be silent. They will be loud
