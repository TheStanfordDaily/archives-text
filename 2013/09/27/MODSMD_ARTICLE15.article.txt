# Card swims past SJSU to open season

### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's swimming kicked off its
2013 season Thursday as it welcomed the San
Jose State Spartans to Avery Aquatic Center for
a dual meet. The defending Pac-12 champion
Cardinal (1-0) enjoyed a strong opening to its
season, as Stanford was able to coast by the de
fending Western Athletic Conference champion
Spartans (0-1) by a score of
138-100.

The Cardinal, under second-year coach
Greg Meehan, opened the meet with a bang in
the 200-yard medley relay as all three of its
teams swept the top three of four teams from
San Jose State. Each of the three Cardinal quar
tets finished with times at or below 1:44.7
while none of the Spartan teams broke 1:45.0.

In the individual events, Stanford's return
ing juniors and seniors shined and some newer
faces impressed as nine different Cardinal swim
mers claimed victories. Stanford won every
event except the 100-yard freestyle, in which
Cardinal sophomore Julia Anderson was narrow
ly out-touched by Spartan freshman Alysha
Bush, and the 200-yard IM, in which Stanford
exhibitioned.

Stanford's returning seniors including
the consistently successful Maya Di√üado, Andie
Taylor and Felicia Lee helped set the pace
throughout the meet, with the trio accounting
for five of Stanford's first-place finishes of the af
ternoon.

Taylor accounted for one of the most excit
ing finishes of the meet with her performance
in the 200-yard butterfly. Although she and
Spartan senior Ashlyn Acosta had comfortably
led the pack during the whole race, it looked as
if Acosta would cruise to a victory after she
pulled ahead of Taylor midway through the race.
However, Taylor battled back and overtook
Acosta in the final 25 yards, eventually out
touching the Spartan by less than two-tenths of

a second.
"I think our seniors did a nice job," Meehan
said. "They have the experience, they know the
expectations this time of year and I think they
are doing a good job leading the group along."
Junior sprinter Maddy Schaefer, the owner
of the Avery Aquatic Center's record 50-yard
freestyle time, also had a big day to continue her
string of strong performances from last season.
Schaefer was a part of the Cardinal's winning
200-yard medley relay team and also notched an
individual victory in the 50 free and came in
second in the 200-yard backstroke.
Alongside the upperclassmen that shined,
some of the Cardinal freshmen also made big
splashes in their first meet on The Farm. Davis
native Tara Halsted swam a very impressive 200-
yard backstroke to finish in first ahead of
Schaefer and Olympic bronze medalist Lia
Neal swam to a convincing victory in the 200-
yard freestyle, coming in a full two seconds
ahead of the second-place finisher. Although
Halsted and Neal had strong meets, Coach Mee-
