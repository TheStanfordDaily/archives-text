# Making a case for Richard Sherman
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
One of the coolest things about being
a college football fan is watching for
mer players from your respective
school succeed in the pros. It
doesn't matter which franchise a Stanford
alumnus is playing for; I'll almost always

cheer him on.
Almost always.
Because even
though Stanford
fans blindly support
whoever trots out
on Saturdays in car
dinal and white, we
can't forget that any

team, including the Cardinal, is made up of
individuals individuals that don't always,
well, get along.

Such is the case with Richard Sherman
and Jim Harbaugh.
The trash-talking, Pro Bowl corner for
the Seattle Seahawks clashed repeatedly
with his former Stanford coach while the
two were on the Farm. Harbaugh suspend
ed Sherman for his sideline antics in 2007,
and, reportedly, Sherman still holds a
grudge against Harbaugh because he thinks
his coach sold him short leading up to the
2011 NFL Draft. Now, of course, Harbaugh
is coaching the 49ers and is embroiled in a
fierce divisional rivalry with Sherman's Sea
hawks, resulting in a lot of unpleasant dia
logue between the pair.
Fans being fans, it's hard not to pick
sides and most Stanford faithfuls are
sticking with Harbaugh. He was the face of
the Cardinal's recent revival, and he stayed
local with the Niners; Sherman struggled
for the most part at Stanford after switching
to corner, and now plays for Harbaugh's
proverbial enemy, Pete Carroll. For many in
the Stanford camp, moreover, it's easier to
relate to a clean-cut Paly grad than "a dread
locked motormouth from Compton," as

Sports Illustrated recently called
him.

Given Sherman's history with
Harbaugh, many Cardinal fans see
his Stanford affiliation with a bit of
an asterisk, and that's why Sher
man's boast that he was an "All-Pro
Stanford graduate" on national TV
raised red flags with many of us.
Not only did Sherman's remark
make Stanford affiliates seem
overly pompous, but it came off as
insincere as well. Several months
ago, my personal suspicions were
heightened when Sherman didn't
accept our offseason interview re
quest for the Daily's football book,
"Rags to Roses." Of course, he had
every right to decline the inter
view, but you'd figure that a guy
who never shuts up and name
drops Stanford so much would be
interested in reflecting on his days
on the Farm, just like Harbaugh
and the nine current or former
NFL players who agreed to be in
terviewed.

But even though Cardinal
fans, myself included, haven't
known what to make of Sherman,
the support inside the program
seems unequivocal. A recent fea
ture by the San Jose Mercury

News noted that he is a close
friend of current head coach David
Shaw, a quintessential Stanford
man. What's more, the official
Stanford football Twitter account
has constantly praised the "Sher
manator," even referencing the
"All-Pro Stanford graduate" line on
several occasions. Several current
Cardinal defenders, including Ed
Reynolds, Ben Gardner and A.J.
Tarpley, have tweeted their sup
port as well.

All of that makes me think
one thing: Sherman's personal
feud with Harbaugh is just that,
and not the representation of
some greater clash between Sher
man and the program.
There's always a chance for
schism whenever you put two per
sonalities that big in a room. In
many ways, really, Sherman and
Harbaugh are more alike than dif
ferent. They're both ultra-competi
tive, and neither is shy with his
thoughts. Harbaugh asks his players
to embrace their blue-collar roots;
Sherman often cites his father, who
drives a garbage truck, as an inspi
ration. And don't forget, Sherman
isn't the only one who has taken
his trash talking to the media.
We can only speculate on the
specifics of their falling out.
Maybe Sherman inappropriately
asserted himself on the team and
Harbaugh reeled him in; maybe

Harbaugh unfairly tried to make an
example of him after his sideline
conduct that led to that 2007 sus
pension. Maybe there's not even a
bad guy.

We don't know only a se
lect few, those who were mem
bers of the program back then, do.
So it's not really fair to Sherman,
who earned his Stanford degree
and put in five years with the
team, if we hold back the fandom
we give any other loyal Cardinal
alumnus, blind to their playing
style or personality.
It's fine if you want to choose
Harbaugh over Sherman when the

Niners and Seahawks meet (even
though that strategy didn't work
out two weeks ago). But until
then, toss out that Richard Sher
man voodoo doll and make room in
your collection for the Cardinal's
real enemies: the 75 Cal and USC
grads currently on NFL rosters.

Don't worry. Marshawn
Lynch has dreads too.

"The Beydanator" just doesn't have
the same ring as "The Shermanator."

whoever trots out
on Saturdays in car
dinal and white, we
can't forget that any

team, including the Cardinal, is made up of
individuals individuals that don't always,
well, get along.

Such is the case with Richard Sherman
and Jim Harbaugh.
The trash-talking, Pro Bowl corner for
the Seattle Seahawks clashed repeatedly
with his former Stanford coach while the
two were on the Farm. Harbaugh suspend
ed Sherman for his sideline antics in 2007,
and, reportedly, Sherman still holds a
grudge against Harbaugh because he thinks
his coach sold him short leading up to the
2011 NFL Draft. Now, of course, Harbaugh
is coaching the 49ers and is embroiled in a
fierce divisional rivalry with Sherman's Sea
hawks, resulting in a lot of unpleasant dia
logue between the pair.
Fans being fans, it's hard not to pick
sides and most Stanford faithfuls are
sticking with Harbaugh. He was the face of
the Cardinal's recent revival, and he stayed
local with the Niners; Sherman struggled
for the most part at Stanford after switching
to corner, and now plays for Harbaugh's
proverbial enemy, Pete Carroll. For many in
the Stanford camp, moreover, it's easier to
relate to a clean-cut Paly grad than "a dread
locked motormouth from Compton," as

Sports Illustrated recently called
him.

Given Sherman's history with
Harbaugh, many Cardinal fans see
his Stanford affiliation with a bit of
an asterisk, and that's why Sher
man's boast that he was an "All-Pro
Stanford graduate" on national TV
raised red flags with many of us.
Not only did Sherman's remark
make Stanford affiliates seem
overly pompous, but it came off as
insincere as well. Several months
ago, my personal suspicions were
heightened when Sherman didn't
accept our offseason interview re
quest for the Daily's football book,
"Rags to Roses." Of course, he had
every right to decline the inter
view, but you'd figure that a guy
who never shuts up and name
drops Stanford so much would be
interested in reflecting on his days
on the Farm, just like Harbaugh
and the nine current or former
NFL players who agreed to be in
terviewed.

But even though Cardinal
fans, myself included, haven't
known what to make of Sherman,
the support inside the program
seems unequivocal. A recent fea
ture by the San Jose Mercury

News noted that he is a close
friend of current head coach David
Shaw, a quintessential Stanford
man. What's more, the official
Stanford football Twitter account
has constantly praised the "Sher
manator," even referencing the
"All-Pro Stanford graduate" line on
several occasions. Several current
Cardinal defenders, including Ed
Reynolds, Ben Gardner and A.J.
Tarpley, have tweeted their sup
port as well.

All of that makes me think
one thing: Sherman's personal
feud with Harbaugh is just that,
and not the representation of
some greater clash between Sher
man and the program.
There's always a chance for
schism whenever you put two per
sonalities that big in a room. In
many ways, really, Sherman and
Harbaugh are more alike than dif
ferent. They're both ultra-competi
tive, and neither is shy with his
thoughts. Harbaugh asks his players
to embrace their blue-collar roots;
Sherman often cites his father, who
drives a garbage truck, as an inspi
ration. And don't forget, Sherman
isn't the only one who has taken
his trash talking to the media.
We can only speculate on the
specifics of their falling out.
Maybe Sherman inappropriately
asserted himself on the team and
Harbaugh reeled him in; maybe

Harbaugh unfairly tried to make an
example of him after his sideline
conduct that led to that 2007 sus
pension. Maybe there's not even a
bad guy.

We don't know only a se
lect few, those who were mem
bers of the program back then, do.
So it's not really fair to Sherman,
who earned his Stanford degree
and put in five years with the
team, if we hold back the fandom
we give any other loyal Cardinal
alumnus, blind to their playing
style or personality.
It's fine if you want to choose
Harbaugh over Sherman when the

Niners and Seahawks meet (even
though that strategy didn't work
out two weeks ago). But until
then, toss out that Richard Sher
man voodoo doll and make room in
your collection for the Cardinal's
real enemies: the 75 Cal and USC
grads currently on NFL rosters.

Don't worry. Marshawn
Lynch has dreads too.

"The Beydanator" just doesn't have
the same ring as "The Shermanator."
