NO. 5 STANFORD (3-0,10 PAC-12) AT
WASHINGTON STATE (3-1,1-03

SAM FISHER
STANFORD 24,
WASHINGTON STATE
: This game scares me,
as all Pac-12 road contests
seem to. However, I'm not
sure how good Washington
State is; yes, the win at Uni
versity of Southern California
looked impressive, but the
Trojans are not nearly as
good as advertised. Still,
traveling to Century Link Field
is always perilous, especially
when going against a Mike
Leach offense without two of
your top six defensive backs
(probably at least for a half).
And with Ail-American offen
sive guard David Yankey out
for family reasons, the sur
prisingly strong Cougar de
fense could present serious
problems for Stanford's rush
ing attack. Due to this perfect
storm, I think Wazzu gives
Stanford all it can handle, but
senior safety Ed Reynolds'
second-half return and junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan's
poise under pressure com
bine to give Stanford a one
touchdown victory.

GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 31,
WASHINGTON STATE
17: Given the fact that
Stanford has somewhat sur
prisingly struggled against an
overmatched Washington
State program in the past
three seasons, it's difficult to
see the Cardinal blowing out
the Cougars at Century Link
Field this Saturday. However,
the Cardinal players left the
Arizona State game with a
bad taste in their mouths,

and because of the lessons
learned from that frustrating
fourth quarter, they will be
able to avoid the trap of
complacency. Wazzu's air
raid will score a touchdown
early, but the Cardinal de
fense will slow down quarter
back Connor Halliday and
company for the remainder
of the game. Running back
Tyler Gaffney should notch
his third 100-yard game of
the season, and quarterback
Kevin Hogan will hit re
ceivers Ty Montgomery and
Devon Cajuste for big gains
off play action during the
second half of a comfortable
Stanford victory.

WINSTON SHI
STANFORD 28,
WASHINGTON STATE
14: It would be difficult to
dream up a bigger trap game
than Washington State Sat
urday. Wazzu has had a long
string of poor years, and with
No. 16 Washington visiting
Palo Alto the week after, it's
not impossible to imagine
that Stanford could get
caught sleeping. Even
though Mike Leach's offense
has been sputtering in Pull
man, he still has a well-de
served reputation for being
able to hang 50 against any
one, anywhere, anytime. As
Stanford's first matchup
against a classic pass-happy
attack, WSU will be a key
barometer to the pollsters for
the Cardinal pass rush. I
think the Stanford front sev
en will control the game;
Stanford wins by two touch
downs.
