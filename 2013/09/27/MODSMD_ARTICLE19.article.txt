# Reviewing the Toronto Film Festival
## Stunning visuals mark TIFF documentaries 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY DESK EDITOR 
The Toronto International Film Festival
screens many of the finest documentaries of
the year, including those that can only be
done full justice on the big screen. The Dai
ly presents reviews of three of the most ex
citing documentaries at the festival.

"When Jews Were Funny"
There's an interesting film somewhere
inside Alan Zweig's documentary "When
Jews Were Funny," but it has little to do
with his thesis statement that Jews make
the best comedians and that Jewish comedy
is dying as Jewish oppression fades. The film
is at its best when it starts to probe at what
it means to be Jewish in the 21st century,
now that secular Jews are more common
than religious ones, Jews aren't isolated in
their own communities and it's fairly com
mon for Jews to marry the goyum. Will this
mean that the younger generation is less
Jewish or unable to pass on the traditions?

Through interviews with various Jewish co
medians about their culture and what is spe
cial about Jewish comedy, the film suggests
that it might just be the brand of Jewish
comedy that keeps the culture alive. Unfor
tunately, the film gets bogged down by the

director's own personal issues he's 61
with a two-year-old daughter from a gentile
wife and is concerned that his daughter
won't be a real Jew â€”and with a question
that can't be answered definitively, especial
ly when the subjects interviewed are exclu
sively Jews, ignoring the broader context of
21 st-century comedy.

"Watermark"

Environmental photographer Edward
Burtynsky is Canada's most famous photog
rapher, known for his ironically gorgeous
shots of landscapes destroyed by humans,
from carved-out mines to recycling heaps.
Toronto documentary filmmaker Jennifer
Baichwal followed Burtynsky around in
2005 for her film "Manufactured Land
scapes" about his photographs in China, and
"Watermark" marks their first collaboration
as co-directors. The film documents Burtyn
sky's Water Project, which takes us around
the world to see how humans have changed
landscapes because of water: like, for in
stance, in Owens Lake, Calif., where the
water was pumped out to Los Angeles leav
ing behind a desert producing enormous
dust pollution. The images compiled by Bur
tynsky and cinematographer Nicholas De
Pencier are visually stunning, which is
enough reason to see the film on the big

In "Beyond the Edge," Leanne Pooley recreates the 1953 expedition that made Edmund
Hillary and Tenzig Norgay the first humans to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Pooley
uses 3D technology and stunning visuals to recreate the historic trek to the top of the world.

screen. Unfortunately, the film is
merely a series of montages, mov
ing from one landscape to another
just as our interest has been
piqued and providing too little in
formation about the many awe-in
spiring sites.

"Beyond the Edge"
Leanne Pooley's documentary
"Beyond the Edge" retells and
recreates the 1953 expedition that
made New Zealander Edmund
Hillary and Sherpa Tenzig Norgay
the first humans to reach the sum
mit of Mount Everest. Voiceovers
from the expedition participants
and their children narrate the sto
ry and keep it moving, while the
images onscreen are a mix of
archival footage and re-enactments
by actors. Shot in 3D, Pooley gives
us a real sense of the many dangers
Hillary and his team faced on this
treacherous climb and mixes in
maps and photographs to help ori
ent us on the journey. The film cel
ebrates the technical feat the
climb represented from making
use of oxygen tanks to the tough
terrain and will hopefully help
to correct the popular notion that
Hillary triumphed on Everest
alone, reminding the world that
Norgay also made it to the top.
