## Ticket trouble Popularity of shows catches Bing box office by surprise 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
For most concert halls and art programs
today, a sold-out venue and consistently
high-demand performances would be a
dream come true. For Stanford live, howev
er, managing the excess demand for tickets
at the newly opened Bing Concert Hall has
been one of the greatest challenges this
year, forcing the box office to rescind the al
ready purchased tickets of several hundred
patrons.
"The hall is so beautiful and the sound

is so wonderful that there is so much excite
ment about it," said Wiley Hausam, the ex
ecutive director of Bing Concert Hall and
Stanford Live. "And so, shows that wouldn't
have sold out before are selling out now."
Bing Concert Hall, which opened on
Jan. 11, 2013, has a seat capacity of 842.
The new facility now allows Stanford to host
orchestras and famous performers such as
Itzhak Perlman and the Young Virtuosos of
the Perlman Music Program, who per
formed on Sunday, Sept. 22. Twenty of the
performances for the 2013-14 year are al
ready sold out, largely due to the successful

subscription campaign that ran during this
summer.
In fact, demand for tickets was more
than what Stanford Live was prepared for
and actually exceeded the audience space.
Hausam said that 300 more households or
dered tickets than seats available, forcing
Stanford Live to go through what Hausam
described as "a very careful ticketing
process" to determine who would get tick
ets and who would be left out.
"The situation here is so unusual I
haven't heard about this much demand for
tickets on subscription in 25 years,"

Hausam said. "This never happens. That's
why we weren't expecting it.
According to Hausam, Stanford Live al
locates tickets through the same process
that almost all arts and cultures organiza
tions use. Donors are seated first based on
the size of their donations to Bing, and then
the remaining subscribers are seated based
on how long they have been attending per
formances and their history with the organ
ization.

"The people who never subscribed be
fore and had never given a donation before
would have the least chance of getting in,"
Hausam explained.

As a result, Stanford Live contacted
those patrons who were denied the tickets
they had initially purchased and offered
them tickets to other performances, reser
vations for the Live Simulcast of San Francis
co Opera's Falstaff in Frost Amphitheater on
Oct. 11 and other perks such as parking
passes.

"Except for five or six or seven of them,
they seemed to be happy by the end of our
working with them to solve it," Hausam
said. "People, especially when it's someone
like Itzhak Perlman or Joshua Bell [perform
ing], are very disappointed when they can't

Performers such as Joshua Bell and Itzhak Perlman drew so much interest that Bing Concert Hall was forced to rescind the tickets of several hundred
customers. Priority for tickets was determined based on the patron's donation and prior subscription history, causing disappointment among customers.
