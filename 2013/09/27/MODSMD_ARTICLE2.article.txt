## Ticket trouble Popularity of shows catches Bing box office by surprise 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
For most concert halls and art programs
today, a sold-out venue and consistently
high-demand performances would be a
dream come true. For Stanford live, howev
er, managing the excess demand for tickets
at the newly opened Bing Concert Hall has
been one of the greatest challenges this
year, forcing the box office to rescind the al
ready purchased tickets of several hundred
patrons.
"The hall is so beautiful and the sound

is so wonderful that there is so much excite
ment about it," said Wiley Hausam, the ex
ecutive director of Bing Concert Hall and
Stanford Live. "And so, shows that wouldn't
have sold out before are selling out now."
Bing Concert Hall, which opened on
Jan. 11, 2013, has a seat capacity of 842.
The new facility now allows Stanford to host
orchestras and famous performers such as
Itzhak Perlman and the Young Virtuosos of
the Perlman Music Program, who per
formed on Sunday, Sept. 22. Twenty of the
performances for the 2013-14 year are al
ready sold out, largely due to the successful

subscription campaign that ran during this
summer.
In fact, demand for tickets was more
than what Stanford Live was prepared for
and actually exceeded the audience space.
Hausam said that 300 more households or
dered tickets than seats available, forcing
Stanford Live to go through what Hausam
described as "a very careful ticketing
process" to determine who would get tick
ets and who would be left out.
"The situation here is so unusual I
haven't heard about this much demand for
tickets on subscription in 25 years,"

Hausam said. "This never happens. That's
why we weren't expecting it.
According to Hausam, Stanford Live al
locates tickets through the same process
that almost all arts and cultures organiza
tions use. Donors are seated first based on
the size of their donations to Bing, and then
the remaining subscribers are seated based
on how long they have been attending per
formances and their history with the organ
ization.

"The people who never subscribed be
fore and had never given a donation before
would have the least chance of getting in,"
Hausam explained.

As a result, Stanford Live contacted
those patrons who were denied the tickets
they had initially purchased and offered
them tickets to other performances, reser
vations for the Live Simulcast of San Francis
co Opera's Falstaff in Frost Amphitheater on
Oct. 11 and other perks such as parking
passes.

"Except for five or six or seven of them,
they seemed to be happy by the end of our
working with them to solve it," Hausam
said. "People, especially when it's someone
like Itzhak Perlman or Joshua Bell [perform
ing], are very disappointed when they can't

get in."
Local resident Barbara Wolf and Stan
ford professor Edwin Colloff were two tick
et purchasers who were very disappointed
with the process.
Wolf had purchased tickets on June 3
the very start of the subscription cam
paign for her and her husband to attend
three different concerts, including Joshua
Bell's performance on Feb. 8, 2014.
"I have been wanting to see a Joshua
Bell concert for three or four years now, but
every time I've tried to see him his concerts
have been sold out," Wolf said. "I was
thrilled when I was able to get the tickets."
In early September, Stanford Live noti
fied Wolf that she no longer had tickets to
the Joshua Bell concert. She was also in
formed of the seating process that Stanford
Live was using.
"When I heard that it just blew my

mind," Wolf said. "I said, 'What am I,
chopped liver? You are going to tell me that
after you sold me these tickets that you are
going to take them away from us because
we didn't make a charitable donation to
Stanford?'"

Wolf, who has been attending concerts
with her husband all over the Bay Area
and particularly at Stanford for over 50
years, was determined to get her seats. Af
ter many phone calls and emails to Stanford
Live, Wolf said the organization ultimately
came through and gave her tickets.
Colloff encountered a similar situation.
After purchasing a subscription on June 4,
he was informed nearly three months later
that his seating for the Haifa Symphony Or
chestra could not be accommodated. The
following week, he was told that he no
longer had tickets.
After attempting to reaching Stanford
live several times, Colloff said he got in
touch with Stanford Live's Director of Mar
keting, Communications and Patron Servic
es, Nancy Louise Bertossa, who eventually

gave him seats to the Haifa Symphony.
"Managing the scarcity of seats has
been one of our biggest challenges,"
Hausam said. "It turns out that the demand
for tickets for many of the shows is much
greater than 842 seats. What we have to do
is carefully manage the seats so particularly
students have an opportunity to get in, in
the way that is most convenient for them."
That mindset is part of Stanford Live's
new emphasis on serving students. Hausam
explained that Stanford Live hopes to have
student attendance constitute 20 percent
or more of the audience for all performanc
es.
Although the Stanford Live website
lists 20 performances where "tickets are
currently not available," Hausam explained
that there are still student tickets available
for these concerts. For example, the per
formances of Mariza, Deborah Voigt and the
San Francisco Boys Chorus still have over
100 seats left for students to purchase. The
Joshua Bell concert is completely sold out to
the public and students, but the Haifa Sym
phony Orchestra had 16 student tickets
available as of late last week. Student tickets
are all $ 10, and each student is allowed to
purchase two tickets per show.
"We really tried to hold the line on the
number of student seats we were holding,"
Hausam said. "I guess the easy way out
would have been for us to just take the stu
dent seats and sell them to those people.
But we didn't do that."
Stanford Live is also working to make
unsold student tickets available a few days
before the performance and at curtain time.
According to Hausam, no-show rates are
particularly high among students.
In order to avoid the overbooking next
year, Stanford Live plans to roll out the sub
scription in phases. Current subscribers and
current donors will have a private period to
renew before Stanford Live will be available
to the general public for subscriptions.
"The subscription period was an
nounced to go through July 24, so we really
couldn't really do anything about it until af
ter that point," Hausam said. "It will not
happen again. I can guarantee it."

Live was using.
"When I heard that it just blew my

mind," Wolf said. "I said, 'What am I,
chopped liver? You are going to tell me that
after you sold me these tickets that you are
going to take them away from us because
we didn't make a charitable donation to
Stanford?'"

Wolf, who has been attending concerts
with her husband all over the Bay Area
and particularly at Stanford for over 50
years, was determined to get her seats. Af
ter many phone calls and emails to Stanford
Live, Wolf said the organization ultimately
came through and gave her tickets.
Colloff encountered a similar situation.
After purchasing a subscription on June 4,
he was informed nearly three months later
that his seating for the Haifa Symphony Or
chestra could not be accommodated. The
following week, he was told that he no
longer had tickets.
After attempting to reaching Stanford
live several times, Colloff said he got in
touch with Stanford Live's Director of Mar
keting, Communications and Patron Servic
es, Nancy Louise Bertossa, who eventually

gave him seats to the Haifa Symphony.
"Managing the scarcity of seats has
been one of our biggest challenges,"
Hausam said. "It turns out that the demand
for tickets for many of the shows is much
greater than 842 seats. What we have to do
is carefully manage the seats so particularly
students have an opportunity to get in, in
the way that is most convenient for them."
That mindset is part of Stanford Live's
new emphasis on serving students. Hausam
explained that Stanford Live hopes to have
student attendance constitute 20 percent
or more of the audience for all performanc
es.
Although the Stanford Live website
lists 20 performances where "tickets are
currently not available," Hausam explained
that there are still student tickets available
for these concerts. For example, the per
formances of Mariza, Deborah Voigt and the
San Francisco Boys Chorus still have over
100 seats left for students to purchase. The
Joshua Bell concert is completely sold out to
the public and students, but the Haifa Sym
phony Orchestra had 16 student tickets
available as of late last week. Student tickets
are all $ 10, and each student is allowed to
purchase two tickets per show.
"We really tried to hold the line on the
number of student seats we were holding,"
Hausam said. "I guess the easy way out
would have been for us to just take the stu
dent seats and sell them to those people.
But we didn't do that."
Stanford Live is also working to make
unsold student tickets available a few days
before the performance and at curtain time.
According to Hausam, no-show rates are
particularly high among students.
In order to avoid the overbooking next
year, Stanford Live plans to roll out the sub
scription in phases. Current subscribers and
current donors will have a private period to
renew before Stanford Live will be available
to the general public for subscriptions.
"The subscription period was an
nounced to go through July 24, so we really
couldn't really do anything about it until af
ter that point," Hausam said. "It will not
happen again. I can guarantee it."

For most concert halls and art programs
today, a sold-out venue and consistently
high-demand performances would be a
dream come true. For Stanford live, howev
er, managing the excess demand for tickets
at the newly opened Bing Concert Hall has
been one of the greatest challenges this
year, forcing the box office to rescind the al
ready purchased tickets of several hundred
patrons.
"The hall is so beautiful and the sound

is so wonderful that there is so much excite
ment about it," said Wiley Hausam, the ex
ecutive director of Bing Concert Hall and
Stanford Live. "And so, shows that wouldn't
have sold out before are selling out now."
Bing Concert Hall, which opened on
Jan. 11, 2013, has a seat capacity of 842.
The new facility now allows Stanford to host
orchestras and famous performers such as
Itzhak Perlman and the Young Virtuosos of
the Perlman Music Program, who per
formed on Sunday, Sept. 22. Twenty of the
performances for the 2013-14 year are al
ready sold out, largely due to the successful

subscription campaign that ran during this
summer.
In fact, demand for tickets was more
than what Stanford Live was prepared for
and actually exceeded the audience space.
Hausam said that 300 more households or
dered tickets than seats available, forcing
Stanford Live to go through what Hausam
described as "a very careful ticketing
process" to determine who would get tick
ets and who would be left out.
"The situation here is so unusual I
haven't heard about this much demand for
tickets on subscription in 25 years,"

Hausam said. "This never happens. That's
why we weren't expecting it.
According to Hausam, Stanford Live al
locates tickets through the same process
that almost all arts and cultures organiza
tions use. Donors are seated first based on
the size of their donations to Bing, and then
the remaining subscribers are seated based
on how long they have been attending per
formances and their history with the organ
ization.

"The people who never subscribed be
fore and had never given a donation before
would have the least chance of getting in,"
Hausam explained.

As a result, Stanford Live contacted
those patrons who were denied the tickets
they had initially purchased and offered
them tickets to other performances, reser
vations for the Live Simulcast of San Francis
co Opera's Falstaff in Frost Amphitheater on
Oct. 11 and other perks such as parking
passes.

"Except for five or six or seven of them,
they seemed to be happy by the end of our
working with them to solve it," Hausam
said. "People, especially when it's someone
like Itzhak Perlman or Joshua Bell [perform
ing], are very disappointed when they can't
