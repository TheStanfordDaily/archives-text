## Characters come of age in TIFF films Family relationships, physical conditions pose challenges 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY DESK EDITOR 
This year at the Toronto International
Film Festival (TIFF), documentaries weren't
the only genre of film that took the event by
storm movies featuring the classic cine
matic theme of adolescence and coming-of
age were quite popular as well.
On Day One of TIFF, I saw the touching
German film "Exit Marrakech," directed by
Caroline Link ("Nowhere in Africa"), about
a privileged German 17-year-old Ben (the
very handsome Samuel Schneider) who is

summoned to Morocco one summer by his
absent father, Heinrich. In Morocco, Ben
wants to meet people and see the real coun
try they live in, while Heinrich prefers to
read about it from his luxury hotel. When
Ben meets a beautiful young prostitute, he
impulsively follows her home to meet her
family, worrying his father and putting him
self in danger; Ben is diabetic and embarked
on this adventure without necessary prepa
rations.

In the Q&A following the film's show
ing, Link noted that she liked the idea that
Ben was forced to grow up and be responsi
ble both from emotional circumstances

his father's departure and his mother's de
manding career and physical necessities:
managing diabetes means he can't be as
carefree as he may hope to be. What follows
is a coming-of-age story and a buddy road
movie, as Ben embarks on his own adven
ture and then later meets up with his father
as they try to mend fences, against the
beautiful and foreign backdrop of Morocco.
Also on Day One, I saw the moving "Ho
Do," a film from Singapore about a trouble
making young boy and his relationship with
his Filipino nanny. There are similarities
here to the premise of Swedish auteur
Lukas Moodysson's 2009 film "Mammoth"
about upper-middle-class white guilt, but
this film is much more tender, with charac
ters who are less selfish but still troubled by
circumstances.

The young boy stirs up trouble as a plea
for attention, while his parents are too ab
sorbed in their own troubles to help him;
the father is in a financial mess and can't
seem to communicate with his wife, which
only incurs her wrath and makes their rela
tionship unstable and hurtful. When they
hire a Filipino nanny, who has left her own

son to come to Singapore for the job, the
young boy hazes her before discovering that
she is the only one willing to spend time
with him and provide the attention he so
desperately needs. There are no bad guys in
this film where everyone gets hurt, as each
person aims to hurt the other as a means of
deflecting his or her own pain.
Japanese director and TIFF favorite Hi
rokazu Koreeda had the North American
premiere of his new film "Like Father, Like
Son," which won the Jury Prize at Cannes,
on Day Three. It's a switched-at-birth story
that does a better job of dealing with the
complexities of what it means to be a parent
and connected to your child than it does in
dealing with the logistics of what to do
when discovering your child was switched
at birth.

The film is told from the perspective of
one of the fathers, Ryota, a business hotshot
who can provide material goods but is rarely
around. He is in the process of putting his
son into private school when he discovers
that they are not biologically related and

thinks that he finally understands why he
feels disconnected from his son. The other
family is poorer but warmer they have
two other children and spend quality time
with them.

The two families decide to try out
swapping children on the weekends as a
stepping-stone for a more permanent situa
tion, which augers trouble. How can they
pull a boy away from his younger siblings he
grew up with? And once both families have
spent time with both boys, how can they
prevent becoming attached to both of
them? And what about the children's feel
ings? Ryota behaves abominably by brow
beating all parties into a switch that can't
possibly work out in the long term, hurting
everyone in the process before they can
mend it.

In the Q&A following the film, Koreeda
explained that his work was inspired by an
experience he had while shooting the 2011
film "I Wish," also about children, which
took him away from his young daughter for
over a month and created a schism in their
relationship. The movie's central idea is that
blood ties and privilege matter less than
quality time, because quality time is more
important for children. This is a thoughtful
and moving exploration of what it means to
be a parent, but the selfish behavior of the

protagonist is hard to forgive.
The festival's best film about adoles
cence, and indeed one of the best films of
the festival, had its North American Pre
miere on Day Five. Lukas Moodysson's
buoyant, funny and touching "We Are The
Best!" is a screen adaptation of a graphic
novel by his wife about her own childhood.
The film tells the story of three 13-year-old
punk rocker girls in 1980s Stockholm who
decide to form a band.

In the Q&A, Moodysson commented
that he tends to disrespect stories and is
more interested in finding truthful mo
ments than in a narrative arc. "We Are the
Best!" is largely plotless, but we do see
growth and changes in the friendship be
tween the girls, the cruelties and support
they provide and their sheer resilience in
the face of misogyny or internal conflict.
This is a film about details and an explo
ration of gender roles available to women,
especially during the 'Bos, and how these
smart and plucky young women flout them.
This is a return to form for Moodysson, re
capturing the subtle moments and insights
that made his name in his first film "Show
Me Love."
