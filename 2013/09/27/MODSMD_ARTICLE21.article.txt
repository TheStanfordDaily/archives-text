# "Joplin" takes the stage at San Jose Rep
## 
### NOEMI BERKOWITZ 
Picture 1960s rock and roll, and the
iconic Janis Joplin, arguably one of the great
est female rock singers, immediately springs
to mind. The San Jose Repertory Theatre
(San Jose Rep) brings her spirit to life in its
production of "One Night with Janis Joplin."
This show, more of a theatrical concert
than a musical, makes its Bay Area premiere
with San Jose Rep before it opens on Broad
way on Oct. 10. With its incredibly talented

cast and fantastic design, it's no surprise that
this show is on the track to greatness. It fea
tures two hours and 20 minutes of fast
paced, energetic renditions of some of
Joplin's most famous songs, including "Sum
mertime" "Piece of My Heart," "Cry Baby,"
"Me & Bobby McGee" and "Ball and Chain."
For an advance performance earlier this
month, Cari Hutson, the alternate to Kacee
Clanton, played Janis Joplin. She did not dis
appoint, recreating Joplin's powerful vocals
and bringing the audience to their feet at the

Act I finale. Along with her performance, the
lights and projections emulated the atmos
phere of the psychedelic 19605, transporting
its eager audience back in time.
The show moves from song to song with
short interludes of Joplin speaking about her
life. These interludes are, surprisingly, the
weakest part of the show, occasionally break
ing up the momentum of Hutson's incredible
performances. They are short tidbits about

Kacee Clanton, above, plays Janis Joplin in The San Jose Repertory Theatre's production of "One Night with Janis Joplin." This is not Clanton's first
performance as the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll —she previously played Joplin in The Kansas City Repertory Theatre's 2006 production of "Love,
Janis." "One Night," which depicts Joplin's life in the 19605, will make a premiere in the Bay Area before opening on Broadway on Oct. 10.
Joplin's childhood, her appreciation for oth
er female singers and her family. However,
they don't touch on her struggles with
drug use or her tragic early death from a
heroin overdose (Joplin notoriously be
longs to the 27 Club, a name given to the
group of celebrities who met early deaths
at age 27).

This choice creates a production that
has momentum but less depth for those
who may want a more complete picture of
Joplin's life. However, it worked for this
show, leaving the audience clapping and
dancing to the music, perhaps oblivious to
the tragic consequences of Joplin's antics
and addiction. It leads us to understand
why Joplin once said, "No man has made
me feel as good an audience," (as an aside,
it was widely assumed that Joplin was a
lesbian). Ultimately the strength of the

songs is what defines the show.
It is not only Hutson's amazing vocals
that wowed the audience but also the
backup singers (Shinnerrie Jackson and
Tricky Jones) and The Blues Singer (Tiffany
Mann) a character who embodies
Joplin's African American idols, including
Bessie Smith, Etta James, Nina Simone
and Aretha Franklin. Mann does a tremen
dous job portraying these various women,
and her commanding stage presence and
remarkable voice produced enthusiastic
cheers. The combination of all of Hutson's
acting, the four women's powerful voices
and the live onstage band puts Joplin's ca
reer in music at the forefront of that night
at the theater.

"One Night with Janis Joplin" is a
must-see for any diehard fan of '6os music.
It runs through Oct. 6 at the San Jose
Repertory Theatre, and tickets can be pur
chased at http://www.sjrep.com/.
