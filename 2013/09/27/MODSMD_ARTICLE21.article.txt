# "Joplin" takes the stage at San Jose Rep

### NOEMI BERKOWITZ 
Picture 1960s rock and roll, and the
iconic Janis Joplin, arguably one of the great
est female rock singers, immediately springs
to mind. The San Jose Repertory Theatre
(San Jose Rep) brings her spirit to life in its
production of "One Night with Janis Joplin."
This show, more of a theatrical concert
than a musical, makes its Bay Area premiere
with San Jose Rep before it opens on Broad
way on Oct. 10. With its incredibly talented

cast and fantastic design, it's no surprise that
this show is on the track to greatness. It fea
tures two hours and 20 minutes of fast
paced, energetic renditions of some of
Joplin's most famous songs, including "Sum
mertime" "Piece of My Heart," "Cry Baby,"
"Me & Bobby McGee" and "Ball and Chain."
For an advance performance earlier this
month, Cari Hutson, the alternate to Kacee
Clanton, played Janis Joplin. She did not dis
appoint, recreating Joplin's powerful vocals
and bringing the audience to their feet at the

Act I finale. Along with her performance, the
lights and projections emulated the atmos
phere of the psychedelic 19605, transporting
its eager audience back in time.
The show moves from song to song with
short interludes of Joplin speaking about her
life. These interludes are, surprisingly, the
weakest part of the show, occasionally break
ing up the momentum of Hutson's incredible
performances. They are short tidbits about

performance as the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll â€”she previously played Joplin in The Kansas City Repertory Theatre's 2006 production of "Love,
Janis." "One Night," which depicts Joplin's life in the 19605, will make a premiere in the Bay Area before opening on Broadway on Oct. 10.
