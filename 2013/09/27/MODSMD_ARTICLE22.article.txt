# Our Pick For: ITALIAN

### RENJIE WONG FOOD DRINK EDITOR 
With so many similarities between Italy
and California the balmy Mediterranean
climes, the drop-dead gorgeous people, the
ridiculous real estate prices it is no won
der that Italian restaurants are dime-a
dozen in Palo Alto. Few, however, manage
to balance authenticity with affordability,
the same way University Avenue gem La
Strada does.

Recreating a rustic Tuscan trattoria, La
Strada's authenticity extends beyond just
the roaring wood-fired oven and alfresco ta
bles. The Charcuterie Platter ($9) is a

generous selection of imported prosciutto,
mortadella, finocchiona, bresaola and
Tyrolean speck, elevated by a creamy pillow
of fior di latte mozzarella ($5 supple
ment). Equally divine is the Kobe Beef
Carpaccio ($l2), leaf-thin slices of pound
ed meat drizzled with olive oil and lemon
juice and topped with an alchemical confet
ti of capers, diced onion and shaved grana
padano cheese.
Amid the exquisite range of primi and
secondi, the Risotto & Sonoma Quail
($18) stands out, with perfectly crisped
skin giving way to the characteristic milki
ness of quail meat. The risotto studded
with wild mushrooms and perfumed with a
touch of truffle oil provides a cosseting
starch base to the delicate poultry, with al
dente bullets of carnaroli rice offering a
curious textural contrast.

The wine list, too, is impressively var
ied, with options as reliable as the Chateau
St. Michele 2011 Riesling ($32 a bottle)
and as decadent as the luscious, velvety
Oasi degli Angeli Kurni 2005 Montepul

ciano d'Abruzzo ($165 a bottle).
La Strada provides as authentic an Ital
ian meal as you can get without a $ 1,200
transatlantic plane ride, which is just as
well, really, because unlike just about every
ristorante or trattoria in Italy, the service
is actually efficient, the waiting staff actu
ally friendly and the credit card machine
actually not broken.
