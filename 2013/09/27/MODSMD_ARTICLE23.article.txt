# Toronto festival draws rave reviews
## 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY DESK EDITOR 
Since I started attending the Toronto In
ternational Film Festival (TIFF) in 2003, I
have watched this audience festival grow in-

to what Roger Ebert dubbed the most impor
tant film festival in the world, marking the
start of the movie year. It was controversial to
suggest that anything trumped Cannes when
Ebert first made that claim, but in the last
few years TIFF has been growing exponen
tially in terms of celebrities and importance.
This year, it positively exploded.

TIFF is first and foremost an audience
film festival, and its highest honor is the Peo
ple's Choice Award. This award has histori
cally turned small movies into international
box office successes: 'American Beauty,"
"Slumdog Millionaire" and "The King's
Speech" were all crowned with this award
before going on to become Best Picture Os
car winners. This year's People's Choice
Award went to Steve McQueen's "12 Years
A Slave" starring Chitwel Ejiofor.
At public screenings, the festival pulls
out all the stops: Almost every film at the fes
tival this year had directors and sometimes
actors present to introduce the film and, in
many cases, to give a Q&A session after the
screening. Unlike at press screenings, audi
ence members at public screenings rarely
walk out mid-screening, unless the film is ex
cruciatingly bad, and even then, Toronto au
diences are usually too polite to leave, stick
ing it out in hopes that the film will improve
or at least to get their $23 worth for the

screening.
When I attended the world premiere of
"The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Him
and Her," the screening was held up by the
hordes of fans and press slowing down James
McAvoy and Jessica Chastain as they walked
the red carpet and took their seats. When
Chastain arrived, hundreds of smartphones
flashed, attempting to document the star's
presence. And this year, more than any pre
vious year, TIFF hosted multitudes of stars at
multiple films each night. Benedict Cumber
batch ("Fifth Estate,"" 12 Years A Slave," 'Au
gust: Osage County") and Daniel Radcliffe
("Horns," "The FWord," "Kill Your Darlings")
each walked the red carpets thrice to pro
mote their respective films, and this year
marked the festival debut for starlets like Julia
Roberts and Taylor Swift.
Filmmakers have long noted how much
they love Toronto audiences: As residents of
a highly multicultural and liberal city, Toron
tonians love to take in international films and
are hard to shock. Tom Tykwer said so in
2010 at the screening of his film "Drei,"
which chronicled the love affair of a husband
and wife with another man and left the
Venice Film Festival audience in shock. I
heard this sentiment echoed many times this
year, and this year's festival was the first to
fully match Toronto's enthusiasm with the
sheer amount of talent present.
In the last 10 years, the festival has
made numerous changes to improve the au
dience experience: Ticket sales have moved
