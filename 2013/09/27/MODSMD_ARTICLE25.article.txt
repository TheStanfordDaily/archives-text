# ROXY'S SPOTS FOR MAKING ART
## 
### ROXY SASS DAILY SEX COLUMNIST 
These days, everyone seems to be talking
about the fate of the arts on campus, but Roxy
has always been more concerned about the
art of the male form. You might say Roxy's an
equal-opportunity kind of gal her taste
runs the gamut from frat star to band geek
but recently she's been finding herself partic
ularly inspired by a more sensitive type of
man. You know what they say about artists be
ing good with their hands...
Here are a few of Roxy's favorite places to pick
up artsy boys:

Party on the Edge

At Cantor's annual fall quarter event
(Oct. 10), there will be almost as many hip
sters roaming the halls as there are freshmen
in CS 106A (another one of Roxy's preferred
hunting grounds). A museum might seem like
a strange place to cruise, but Roxy went to
enough of her Art History 1 lectures to know
that most famous artists had pretty frisky sex
lives. Find your muse tonight, and take him or
her back to your room for some modeling... a
la Jack and Rose.

Art and Architecture Library
Big windows make this one of the pretti
est libraries on campus, but Roxy just appreci
ates that it's light enough to scope out that
cute film studies major working in the cor
ner. Check out the tables on the upper
mezzanine they provide a view of the
whole room so you can spot incoming hot
ties while you are "studying." And the
stacks may be small, but they're big enough
to help you check an item off your bucket list
—when you meet up in the freezing base
ment for some hanky panky, you won't even
need a parka with all the body heat you two

will generate.
Wine and Cheese
If you prefer a bit of alcoholic lubrication
for your conversations, look no further than
Kairos' Wine and Cheese party, where alter
native types converge to talk about how
stressed they are and nibble on string cheese.
It's the perfect place to chat up a photogra
pher or KZSU DJ if you can make yourself
heard over the live music (and if you can't,
Roxy can suggest some nonverbal communi
cation you can try... ).
