# STUDENT LIFE
## Summer program immerses students in art 
### MARISA MESSINA 
As summer wound to a close, Stanford's
campus buzzed with the energy of students
dancing, writing, painting and producing art of
all forms. Although academic classes didn't start
until Sept. 23, over 100 rising sophomores, jun
iors and seniors arrived on the Farm three weeks
early to participate in Arts Intensive, a dynamic
arts-based immersion program.
Now in its fifth year, the program is mod
eled after Sophomore College, except, instead
of exploring traditionally academic interests, stu
dents pursue artistic passions including sculp
ture, filmmaking, creative writing or dance.
Arts Intensive was conceptualized as a "rig
orous and concentrated [program with] its focus
in the arts," according to Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Fiarry Elam, who originated
program's idea.

Each year, the course offerings are slightly
different, and this year, the final showcase was
held at Bing Concert Hall for the first time.
Louis Lagalante 'l5, an Arts Intensive Pro
gram Assistant (AIPA) for the musical theater
class this year and a student in the class last year,
said that Arts Intensive provides a crucial valida
tion of the arts at Stanford.
"I think the arts at Stanford are in tremen
dous danger," Lagalante said. "[l've heard] many
voices raising concerns that Stanford is becom
ing more of a start-up incubator and vocational
school for entrepreneurs than an academic insti
tution devoted to the pursuit of knowledge re
gardless of its profitability or mass-market ap
peal."
Elam said that Arts Intensive is one element
of a Stanford-wide initiative "to make the arts
more vital as a component of the experience on
campus."
Additional art spaces planned for the next
few years include a new Art and Art History
building and a renovation of the Roble Gym,
which will add a theater. The new Ways of
Thinking/Ways of Doing undergraduate breadth
requirements also emphasize the arts in fact,
Arts Intensive fulfills the Creative Expression
component of the new requirements.

Students say that participating in the Arts
Intensive program can provide opportunities to
learn valuable skills.

"Filmmaking was interesting to me on both
a practical and philosophical level," said Julia
Guenther 'l4. "I not only saw [the filmmaking
class] as an excellent opportunity to acquire
video production and editing skills valuable for a
career in marketing but also as a unique oppor
tunity to engage with the complex medium that
is film."

Guenther added that taking a filmmaking
class taught her to think in terms of systems,
which Guenther thinks may help her in the
