# STUDENT LIFE
## Summer program immerses students in art 
### MARISA MESSINA 
As summer wound to a close, Stanford's
campus buzzed with the energy of students
dancing, writing, painting and producing art of
all forms. Although academic classes didn't start
until Sept. 23, over 100 rising sophomores, jun
iors and seniors arrived on the Farm three weeks
early to participate in Arts Intensive, a dynamic
arts-based immersion program.
Now in its fifth year, the program is mod
eled after Sophomore College, except, instead
of exploring traditionally academic interests, stu
dents pursue artistic passions including sculp
ture, filmmaking, creative writing or dance.
Arts Intensive was conceptualized as a "rig
orous and concentrated [program with] its focus
in the arts," according to Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Fiarry Elam, who originated
program's idea.

Each year, the course offerings are slightly
different, and this year, the final showcase was
held at Bing Concert Hall for the first time.
Louis Lagalante 'l5, an Arts Intensive Pro
gram Assistant (AIPA) for the musical theater
class this year and a student in the class last year,
said that Arts Intensive provides a crucial valida
tion of the arts at Stanford.
"I think the arts at Stanford are in tremen
dous danger," Lagalante said. "[l've heard] many
voices raising concerns that Stanford is becom
ing more of a start-up incubator and vocational
school for entrepreneurs than an academic insti
tution devoted to the pursuit of knowledge re
gardless of its profitability or mass-market ap
peal."
Elam said that Arts Intensive is one element
of a Stanford-wide initiative "to make the arts
more vital as a component of the experience on
campus."
Additional art spaces planned for the next
few years include a new Art and Art History
building and a renovation of the Roble Gym,
which will add a theater. The new Ways of
Thinking/Ways of Doing undergraduate breadth
requirements also emphasize the arts in fact,
Arts Intensive fulfills the Creative Expression
component of the new requirements.

Students say that participating in the Arts
Intensive program can provide opportunities to
learn valuable skills.

"Filmmaking was interesting to me on both
a practical and philosophical level," said Julia
Guenther 'l4. "I not only saw [the filmmaking
class] as an excellent opportunity to acquire
video production and editing skills valuable for a
career in marketing but also as a unique oppor
tunity to engage with the complex medium that
is film."

Guenther added that taking a filmmaking
class taught her to think in terms of systems,
which Guenther thinks may help her in the

working world.
Anna Maria Irion 'l4, an archi
tecture major, said she participated
in the Arts Intensive sculpture
class because she thought the class
would be a good introduction to
working in public art, a potential ca
reer interest.

For other students, however,
the Arts Intensive program is an op
portunity to explore interests out
side their academic or career path.
According to Elam, students of all
backgrounds are encouraged to
participate in Arts Intensive. He
said the program was designed to
provide "space for artists as well as
for people who want to return to
or experience the arts."
"I think the creative part is re
ally cool," said McKenzie Andrews
' 16, who took the filmmaking Arts
Intensive class but plans to major
in economics. "A lot of times in my
regular classes I write papers and
do problem sets, and this gives us
much more creative license."

Mia Diawara' 15 is majoring in
science, technology and society
but also served as an AIPA for the
modern dance class in Arts Inten
sive.

"At a school where it can be
difficult to find an arts emphasis
amidst the larger presence of the
STEM fields, having an entire pro
gram devoted to allowing students
to pursue their [non-academic]
passions is invaluable," Diawara
said. "It helps keep the campus,
and the lives of its students, in
balance."

Adam Tobin '93, a film lectur
er in the Department of Art and
Art History who taught a screen
writing class, said he appreciated
the diversity of students within
the program.

"It doesn't matter to me
whether students pursue a career
in this or not," Tobin said. "I really
enjoy advising students who are
pursuing film and screenwriting,
but mostly I enjoy helping stu
dents understand a different way
of thinking and storytelling than
they've understood before."
Participants also noted that the
Arts Intensive program reduces the
perceived loneliness of pursuing
arts on campus.
"Arts Intensive is a powerful
way to create a community of peo
ple doing art at the same time," La
galante said. 'Arts Intensive shows
Stanford students how many peo
ple there are on campus who pur
sue the arts with the same passion

as they do and connects those peo
ple when they might not have ever
met under other circumstances."

Regardless of how it fits into a
student's plan, Elam said that Arts
Intensive helps students attain what

he sees as one of the ultimate goals
of the Stanford experience.

"I would like to see students
leave Stanford with creative confi
dence," Elam said "This confidence
to face new problems, to think

about them [and solve them] cre
atively, that's what makes great
achievements."

Georgia Toal '16 shows off her dance moves at the final showcase of this year's Arts Intensive
program. Students can take classes in dance, filmmaking, sculpture and other forms of the fine arts.
As summer wound to a close, Stanford's
campus buzzed with the energy of students
dancing, writing, painting and producing art of
all forms. Although academic classes didn't start
until Sept. 23, over 100 rising sophomores, jun
iors and seniors arrived on the Farm three weeks
early to participate in Arts Intensive, a dynamic
arts-based immersion program.
Now in its fifth year, the program is mod
eled after Sophomore College, except, instead
of exploring traditionally academic interests, stu
dents pursue artistic passions including sculp
ture, filmmaking, creative writing or dance.
Arts Intensive was conceptualized as a "rig
orous and concentrated [program with] its focus
in the arts," according to Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Fiarry Elam, who originated
program's idea.

Each year, the course offerings are slightly
different, and this year, the final showcase was
held at Bing Concert Hall for the first time.
Louis Lagalante 'l5, an Arts Intensive Pro
gram Assistant (AIPA) for the musical theater
class this year and a student in the class last year,
said that Arts Intensive provides a crucial valida
tion of the arts at Stanford.
"I think the arts at Stanford are in tremen
dous danger," Lagalante said. "[l've heard] many
voices raising concerns that Stanford is becom
ing more of a start-up incubator and vocational
school for entrepreneurs than an academic insti
tution devoted to the pursuit of knowledge re
gardless of its profitability or mass-market ap
peal."
Elam said that Arts Intensive is one element
of a Stanford-wide initiative "to make the arts
more vital as a component of the experience on
campus."
Additional art spaces planned for the next
few years include a new Art and Art History
building and a renovation of the Roble Gym,
which will add a theater. The new Ways of
Thinking/Ways of Doing undergraduate breadth
requirements also emphasize the arts in fact,
Arts Intensive fulfills the Creative Expression
component of the new requirements.

Students say that participating in the Arts
Intensive program can provide opportunities to
learn valuable skills.

"Filmmaking was interesting to me on both
a practical and philosophical level," said Julia
Guenther 'l4. "I not only saw [the filmmaking
class] as an excellent opportunity to acquire
video production and editing skills valuable for a
career in marketing but also as a unique oppor
tunity to engage with the complex medium that
is film."

Guenther added that taking a filmmaking
class taught her to think in terms of systems,
which Guenther thinks may help her in the

working world.
Anna Maria Irion 'l4, an archi
tecture major, said she participated
in the Arts Intensive sculpture
class because she thought the class
would be a good introduction to
working in public art, a potential ca
reer interest.

For other students, however,
the Arts Intensive program is an op
portunity to explore interests out
side their academic or career path.
According to Elam, students of all
backgrounds are encouraged to
participate in Arts Intensive. He
said the program was designed to
provide "space for artists as well as
for people who want to return to
or experience the arts."
