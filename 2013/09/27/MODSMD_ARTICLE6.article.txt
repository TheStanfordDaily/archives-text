# Cantor impacts students
## Students work, study at the Cantor Arts Center

Since she was in high school, Josie
Johnson 'l3 knew she wanted to work in
a museum. At Stanford, Johnson typed the
word "museum" into the Explore Courses
search query and stumbled upon a class
about being a student guide at the Cantor
Center for Visual Arts.

After learning about different skills
and concepts such as museum administra
tion, exhibition planning and art registra
tion, Johnson realized that she was ex
tremely interested in art history. She ulti
mately held four different jobs at Cantor
during her four years at Stanford.
According to Kim Mansfield, coordina
tor of student engagement at Cantor, John
son was one of approximately 20 student
staff members who worked at Cantor
throughout last year. Students are as
signed to different departments, helping
with curating exhibitions, public relations
and maintenance of the outdoor sculpture
garden.

Asia Chiao 'l5, another student staff
member, said that she was attracted by the
practical experience that working at Can
tor can provide.
"There are few opportunities in real
life to work for museums," Chiao said.
"It's great that Stanford offers that choice

to students."
However, working on staff is just one
way for students to get involved with Can
tor. Mansfield said there are three other
main channels for students to interact
with the museum: taking free studio class
es offered at the center, participating in so
cial events and attending academic cours
es that meet in the Cantor building.
"Stanford students are extremely di
verse with different needs and interests,"
Johnson said. "But we can all use Cantor as
a resource for learning since there are
great things there that relate to all academ
ic disciplines, from science, chemistry, his
tory to visual art."
The studio classes are no-credit, no
fee courses that aim to engage students

Students engage with the Cantor Arts Center by working on staff, taking classes within the building or just visiting to take advantage of the
works on display. The museum is also home to social events such as "Party on the Edge," which will be held on Oct. 10 this year.
