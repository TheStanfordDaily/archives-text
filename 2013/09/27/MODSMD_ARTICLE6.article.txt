# Cantor impacts students
## Students work, study at the Cantor Arts Center 
### LAN ANH LE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since she was in high school, Josie
Johnson 'l3 knew she wanted to work in
a museum. At Stanford, Johnson typed the
word "museum" into the Explore Courses
search query and stumbled upon a class
about being a student guide at the Cantor
Center for Visual Arts.

After learning about different skills
and concepts such as museum administra
tion, exhibition planning and art registra
tion, Johnson realized that she was ex
tremely interested in art history. She ulti
mately held four different jobs at Cantor
during her four years at Stanford.
According to Kim Mansfield, coordina
tor of student engagement at Cantor, John
son was one of approximately 20 student
staff members who worked at Cantor
throughout last year. Students are as
signed to different departments, helping
with curating exhibitions, public relations
and maintenance of the outdoor sculpture
garden.

Asia Chiao 'l5, another student staff
member, said that she was attracted by the
practical experience that working at Can
tor can provide.
"There are few opportunities in real
life to work for museums," Chiao said.
"It's great that Stanford offers that choice

to students."
However, working on staff is just one
way for students to get involved with Can
tor. Mansfield said there are three other
main channels for students to interact
with the museum: taking free studio class
es offered at the center, participating in so
cial events and attending academic cours
es that meet in the Cantor building.
"Stanford students are extremely di
verse with different needs and interests,"
Johnson said. "But we can all use Cantor as
a resource for learning since there are
great things there that relate to all academ
ic disciplines, from science, chemistry, his
tory to visual art."
The studio classes are no-credit, no
fee courses that aim to engage students

Students engage with the Cantor Arts Center by working on staff, taking classes within the building or just visiting to take advantage of the
works on display. The museum is also home to social events such as "Party on the Edge," which will be held on Oct. 10 this year.
with the museum's exhibitions
by assigning them a project to
produce something that is in
spired by the museum's art
work.

Several professors par
ticularly in the Art History De
partment also choose to take
advantage of the ambience at
Cantor by holding their discus
sion sections there.

Mansfield said that a popu
lar method of student engage
ment is working at "Party on the
Edge," an annual social gather
ing with student performances,
galleries and live music that is
held at Cantor. This year, the
event will be held on the night
of Oct. 10.

The cafe overlooking the
Rodin Sculpture Garden also
features student-created art.

For Johnson, working at
Cantor was the perfect opportu
nity to further explore her inter

ests and long-term goals. Be
sides guiding, her work entailed
tasks such as putting together
art labels, working on the
arrangements of the artwork
and researching objects that
would potentially be exhibited
in a collection. However, John
son said her most enjoyable ex
perience was working with Eliz
abeth Mitchell, the museum cu
rator.

Chiao also said that the guid
ing class at Cantor taught stu
dents to choose works of art and
talk about them with confidence.
"It is focused toward teach
ing people how to talk about art
without having previous expo
sure to art," Chiao said. "Guides
will be able to look at art and
ask critical questions or help
other people see what's exciting
and interesting about it."
Despite the many opportu
nities available at Cantor, some
student staffers feel that the
center is underutilized. While it
exists as an educational re-

source and is home to an im

pressive number of great works
of art, students often don't
seem to see it as a space that's
accessible or approachable.
"It's the general attitude to
ward the arts here at Stanford,
which is more geared toward
engineering," Chiao said. "Few
people are interested in art his
tory and related subjects, result
ing in poor engagement with
Cantor."

To Chiao, Cantor should be
a place for people to go to enjoy
art and supplement their learn
ing. "You can also just come
with a friend after class and
hang out," she added.
"A museum is a place of
learning and inquiry, and that is
why we are here for students,"
Mansfield said. "We want an ac
tive and engaged relationship
with students. Everyone can
take advantage of these rich re
sources, and there are numerous
different ways to get involved."
