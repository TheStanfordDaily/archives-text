# This is not a love letter (to Cantor Arts Center)
## 
### HELEN ANDERSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Once upon a time, my house was a man
sion.
The master bedroom walk-in closet was,
of course, the elevator. I'd step in, close the
door, step out and there I'd be in my parents'
fifth-floor bedroom —which was different
from their second-floor bedroom. On the
fifth floor, for a start, I didn't have parents.
My house-mansion operated on pretty

standard parallel-universe principles. Infinite
floors meant infinite possibilities, but I had to
be careful. If I didn't remember to ride the
elevator down to ground before I was called
to dinner, I might get stuck in the ether for
ever.
Let's fast-forward a decade. I've found a
real-life mansion, and what do I do? I pretend
it's my house.
That mansion is Cantor Arts Center,
decked out with all the trimmings: marble
staircases, near-deserted wings crammed full
of antique artifacts, the occasional catered
dinner party and, of course, some pretty nice
art stuck up on the walls.
It's funny, hanging out in my house with
a bunch of strangers. Especially
when none of them know that it's
my house. It's as if I've thrown some
sort of subdued gala and then decid
ed to attend it in disguise. My guests
won't give me two glances, and if
they need to find the nearest rest
room, they'll just ask the über-con
scientious house sitters I hired to
watch the place over the holidays.
I've tried telling my house sitters
that I'm back and can take it from
here, but they always pretend not to
hear me over the fizzle of their
walkie-talkies.

The stakes are higher, now. Un
like my house-mansion's rules,
which were enforced by my own de
veloping neural pathways, the rules

that preside over my mansion-house
are enforced by flesh-and-blood
adults wearing uniforms and head
sets.

They're perplexed by me. They
must think I misread the campus
map during NSO and that no one
had the guts to tell me this wasn't
the library, but they still respect me
enough to watch me as if I pose a re
al security threat.
There are games you can play
without anyone knowing, but study
ing in an art museum much like
brushing your teeth in Terman foun
tain or plugging in your computer at
a nightclub is not one of them.
Also like those things, it is not specif
ically disallowed. You'll be held up at
the front door if you're wearing a
backpack, but tuck it under your
arm like a tote bag and no one will
look twice. No pens in the galleries,

but pull out your laptop and park
yourself in front of "Interior with
Cityscape," and you're perfectly le
gal.

By standard measures, Cantor
is a catastrophe of a study spot. It's
jam-packed with distractions and pa
trolled by serious gatekeepers.
There are few electrical outlets, the
cafe is pricey and you'll get chastised
for pulling out a ballpoint.
Despite all this, Cantor saved

me freshman year.
This is not a love letter, and if it
was, it would be a very bad one.
Happy people do not want to live in
mansions. Happy people want small
houses with armchair-legs sunk into
the carpet. They don't keep their
dinnerware in sealed glass cases,
and their air conditioning is never
turned up too high.
But when I discovered Cantor, I

was not happy. I was trying to figure
out where home was, and what it
was, and whether it was anything
more than a storage unit for the
meaningless objects I was continu
ing to amass.

Cantor did not dispel my loneli
ness. The Rodin statues did not be
come my friends. The photography
exhibits did not keep me company.
Cantor did not welcome me with
open arms or slather me with oil
paint kisses. like I said before, this is
not a love letter.

Cantor was not my home, but it
offered me validation. We were well
matched. I was a lonely person, and
it was a lonely place.

Cantor made sure that whenev
er I visited, it was raining. I stuffed
my umbrella in a plastic bag, and I
read or wrote or coded or whatever
needed to be done. I liked being

alone with other people, who were
also being alone. I always stayed un
til one of the guards warned me that
I had five minutes until they locked
the doors.

Sometimes visiting a museum
does not feel like enough. Who, re
ally, is satisfied just to look at things?
Sometimes you must find away to
exist as a part of it. I wanted to ab
sorb the museum into me, to swal
low up its hard corners and unforgiv
ing floors. I wanted brushstrokes in
stead of eyes; I wanted to feel
bronze starting to harden in my ar
teries. But I couldn't do that, so I did
the next best thing.
Cantor was not my home, but I
could at least pretend it was my
house.
