# STUDENT LIFE
## Student artist shows feelings through film 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the seven-and-a-half-minute short
film "The Examined Light," a reporter sits
down at a table across from a burly student
who has been accused of pushing his girl
friend off of a balcony. The room is lit only
by an open window in the back and a single
lamp on the table, providing just enough
light to cast shadows that add to the eeri
ness of the scene.

"Do you believe in justice?" the re
porter asks.

"Depends on what you mean by jus
tice," the student answers, his voice deep
and brooding. "Revenge is the act of pas
sion. Vengeance is the act of justice."
If you want to know how this story
ends, though, you'll have to ask the writer
and director, Ty Olson 'l4, to show you.
Olson has been making films since Sep
tember 11, 2001.
"I was 12, and I guess I wanted to
record that feeling," he said. He down
loaded news clips "That took forever on
dial-up" and edited them together with
music. Although it was more of a slide show
than anything, the short film titled "The
Examined Light [1 ]" â€”was a beginning.

"I don't know if I wanted to be a direc
tor," he said, "but I knew I wanted to keep
capturing those feelings."
Today he's hidden "The Examined
Light" from public view on his Vimeo ac
count because he believes it doesn't reflect
how he's matured as a filmmaker. He's also
removed another eight-minute film called
"Snow Burnt," a dream-like sequence of
scenes that cut between a desolate, snowy
forest and the liveliness of Mexico. Both fea
ture him as an actor, a characteristic that is
absent from his more recent work. In an
email statement to The Daily with links to
the videos, he said, "Be nice ... I get a little
embarrassed."

In fact, Olson seems to want to detach
himself as much as possible from his acting
work, save for the credit line. My interview
with Olson took place over Skype as a
phone call, not video. When asked for a pic
ture of him that could be used for this arti
cle, his response via email was, "I hate to
suck, but I like to keep this as much about
the images, the art, the feeling, as possible."
Initially, this aversion to the public
seems strange considering that he used to
model for Ford Models, the same agency
that signed actor Channing Tatum. While
he's no longer signed with Ford, he's still
signed with an agency in Europe and anoth
er one in the United States. He says he has
n't done any modeling for a year, though,
and refuses to say much at all about that
part of his life.
"It's not exactly what I want to be
known for, and I do it for the money," he
said. "And it's fun sometimes. A lot of mod
els justify it as art, but it's not art."

What is art and what Olson does
want to be known for are his films. After
watching a few, one can easily begin to un
derstand Olson's desire to push all focus on
to his work. Olson is extremely good at cre

ating a mood through profound lines, arrest
ing imagery and exaggerated dramatics.
"They're always about feelings," he
said.
Take his film "Turner Dune" for exam
ple. "A couple years ago, I was driving home
from California to North Dakota, and I was
driving through the desert in Nevada," he
said. "I hadn't ever been in the desert be
fore, and it was very just expansive and
wide and open, and the road in that film,
I wanted to capture that feeling."
His biggest project to date, however, is
the one he is working on right now: a 20- to
25-minute movie for his American studies
honors thesis project about the Norwegian
American experience.
Olson himself is a Norwegian Ameri
can, with a family that rooted itself in Amer
ica several generations ago. He is from
North Dakota, a state that has the fourth
lowest population density in the United
States and the highest percentage of Nor
wegian Americans. He describes North
Dakota as "a really weird version of old
Scandinavia," where Norwegian pride
reigns strong.

"[The film] is a personally inspired por
trait," he explained. "[lt's] my own personal
interpretation of how I see my ancestry and
my hometown."
In order to get a better understanding
of Norway and Norwegians, Olson decided
to spend this quarter in Oslo, Norway.
Richard Gillam '65 Ph.D. '72, Olson's Amer
ican studies advisor, believes this is an im
portant element of Olson's project.
"You benefit by rooting yourself in a
place that's relevant to what you're doing,"
Gillam says.

Gillam said the distinctions between
talking to Norwegians and talking to Nor
wegian immigrants will be "unpredictable,
but it's going to make a difference in how
[Olson] thinks about the film and how he
lets the plot unfold."
According to Gillam, what Olson is tak
ing on with this project is huge.
"Certainly it doesn't sound like it's a
lot, but there's an enormous amount of
work that's going into a project like this," he
said, pointing out details such as casting
people, getting equipment and dealing with
financial issues.
For someone with the talent, motiva

tion and ambition that Olson has, however,
these obstacles shouldn't be an issue. He
didn't, for example, let money stop him
these past few years at Stanford while he
tried to take on more serious film endeav
ors.
"As a new director, you are always
freaking out about money and how to fi

nance some projects," he said.
The summer after his freshman year,
Olson worked as a waiter every single day,
all day. He said he knew his art was inhibit
ed by his lack of capital, so he tried to make
as much money as possible and spent every

dime on equipment.
The hard work certainly paid
off. Those who work closely with
Olson have only praise for his dili
gence and final products.
"Ty has extremely high stan
dards and a strong drive," said Adam
Tobin '93, Olson's technical advisor
and screenwriting instructor. "His
visual sense is impressive, and the
production values of his films are
high. They're often beautiful."
Even more remarkable, Olson
has managed to shoot four music
videos for two different European
bands, despite the fact that he has
yet to graduate, did not go to film
school and is completely self-taught.
But it wasn't some magical opportu
nity that just fell into his lap; Olson
took it upon himself to email one of
his favorite unsigned bands, Postiljo
nen, links of his work.
One thing led to another, with
another being Olson making a mu
sic video for them. Then the band

signed to a real label and reached
out to him to direct its first official
music video, bringing him one step
closer to his long-term goal of creat
ing a feature film.
While the spotlight on Stan
ford these days seems to focus
mostly on young entrepreneurs
with hot start-ups, it's students
like Olson who help remind the
Stanford community that the
same spirit students put towards
software engineering can also be
put towards artistic endeavors. His
advice for aspiring filmmakers is
simply to "shoot something,"
much like how successful
founders often recommend stu
dents to "build something."
And when you ask him what
his plans are if things don't work
out, you get an answer with the
same kind of determined confi
dence you'd expect from anyone
trying to convince you that their
app is the next Snapchat "No.
It's gonna work out."
