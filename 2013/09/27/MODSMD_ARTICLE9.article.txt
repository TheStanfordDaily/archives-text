# DJ balances music and school

Wiley Webb 'l6 has come a long way
since his first rave. While he was once just
another face in the crowd, the sophomore
is now on stage as the main event. His
songs, notable for their catchy riffs, have
thousands of plays online, and their popu
larity is only growing.
It all started five years ago, during Web
b's freshman year of high school in South
ern California.

"I fell in love with dance music original
ly because a friend dragged me to a rave in
ninth grade," Webb said. "I fell in love with
that scene and the crazy sounds and all
that."

After that night, Webb began to exper
iment on his computer, becoming his high
school's go-to DJ for events. Since then, he
has produced multiple original tracks that
he shares on online sites such as You Tube
and Sound Cloud. He has also performed
across the country; his recent shows took
place at the University of Michigan and at

venues in Seattle and San Francisco.
Webb entered the music scene at just
the right time without the help of social
media, the young DJ would not have been
able to make the necessary connections to
advance his career. Using Twitter for initial
networking, Webb landed his first perform
ance at a theater in Boulder, Colo., which in
turn allowed him to meet other people, in
cluding Justin Blau, who provided Webb
with his first big show in San Francisco last
October.

Webb is completely self-taught and at-

tributes his success to years of tinkering
with his electronic music gadgets.
"Becoming an expert at anything, I
think, is just the accumulation of a lot of fid
dling around and learning online," Webb

I fell in love with
the scene and the
crazy sounds.
