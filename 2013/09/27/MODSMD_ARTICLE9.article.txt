# DJ balances music and school
## 
### NIUNIU TEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wiley Webb 'l6 has come a long way
since his first rave. While he was once just
another face in the crowd, the sophomore
is now on stage as the main event. His
songs, notable for their catchy riffs, have
thousands of plays online, and their popu
larity is only growing.
It all started five years ago, during Web
b's freshman year of high school in South
ern California.

"I fell in love with dance music original
ly because a friend dragged me to a rave in
ninth grade," Webb said. "I fell in love with
that scene and the crazy sounds and all
that."

After that night, Webb began to exper
iment on his computer, becoming his high
school's go-to DJ for events. Since then, he
has produced multiple original tracks that
he shares on online sites such as You Tube
and Sound Cloud. He has also performed
across the country; his recent shows took
place at the University of Michigan and at

venues in Seattle and San Francisco.
Webb entered the music scene at just
the right time without the help of social
media, the young DJ would not have been
able to make the necessary connections to
advance his career. Using Twitter for initial
networking, Webb landed his first perform
ance at a theater in Boulder, Colo., which in
turn allowed him to meet other people, in
cluding Justin Blau, who provided Webb
with his first big show in San Francisco last
October.

Webb is completely self-taught and at-

tributes his success to years of tinkering
with his electronic music gadgets.
"Becoming an expert at anything, I
think, is just the accumulation of a lot of fid
dling around and learning online," Webb

I fell in love with
the scene and the
crazy sounds.

He also credited his prior knowledge
of piano with helping him learn how to pro
duce music.

"I'm only okay at [playing the piano],
but I think it was crucial," Webb said. "You
can't really make something of musical val
ue without really understanding music."
What started with "just fooling around
with samples and adding in notes and
stuff" soon evolved into a full-time occupa
tion. This past summer, Webb says he
spent more than 30 hours a week devoted
to mastering his craft.
"It's sort of been my full-time intern
ship, this past summer," Webb said. "It's a
combination of working on new music plus
the sort of business that's evolved from it.
There's lots and lots of emails.

"If I'm not procrastinating or working
successfully on something for the music it
self, I'll put in eight hours to 12 hours a
day," he continued. "But that's only when
things are working well, [and] it's not of
ten. I'm really bad at workflow."
In his free time, Webb enjoys cooking,
for many of the same reasons that he en
joys producing music.
"It's very analogous to making music,
actually," Webb said. "It's about knowing
your ingredients, preparing them individu
ally, shaping them into one cohesive whole
and the consumer has no idea what went
into it."

Currently, Webb is working towards a
major in product design and spends his free
time looking at design and architecture on
the Internet.

"I'm very ADD-ish, especially when
working on music," Webb said. "I love read
ing design blogs, looking at lots of architec

ture. That's how I waste time now, instead
of looking at LOL cats, so I guess that's
good."
Despite the distractions, Webb has
clearly put in enough work to excel on the
music circuit: This year, he is scheduled to
perform monthly at Ruby Skye and Vessel
and two nightclubs in San Francisco, on top
of various projects he is working on with
other artists around campus.
Webb hopes to one day have enough
material to perform an entire set of his own
material onstage. But for now, you can
catch him at your next frat party he's
that skinny kid killing it at the turntables.
