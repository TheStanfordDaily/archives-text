# Why I Became a Football Fan
## 
### Margaret Wenzlau 
I walked into the football stadi
um for last Saturday's game
against Arizona State Univer
sity ready for the intellectual chal
lenge. The near four hours of play,
complicated tactics and elaborate
scoring system that I never fully
grasped all could have intimidated
me. I'm used to being confused in
class, but a sporting event?
Nonetheless, I trotted over to
section 105 in the Red Zone and
found my rightful place in the
game as an enthusiastic fan. Who
cares if I did not understand the
game? I was ready for a good time.
I know this routine pretty well
it started at the first game my
freshman year. Even though I
have never been partial to the
technicalities of the sport, there is
plenty of room for enjoyment
among new and bandwagon fans
alike.
Never quite understood the nu
ances of the sport past the touch
downs and field goals? Don't let
the die-hard fans scare you. Never
joined in on the football hype be
fore Stanford? Well, neither had I,
and look how far I have come.
The first step to enjoying the
game without having the rules un
der your belt is going through the
motions. Show up to the game in
Cardinal attire, enter the student
section and never sit down. That's
right, a football game is an athlet
ic even for everyone involved.
Jump when those around you

do so during "All Right Now," and
have your keys ready for the dis
tinctive jingle. Pretty soon you'll
be leading the charge. Others will
look to you for the moment to hop
or shake, a proud and important
responsibility.
And if you came to Stanford for
the engineering rather than the
sport, you'll find that the stadium
rivals the newly renovated techni
cal quad on west campus. The foot
ball players themselves are some
of the finest feats of engineering
that Stanford has to offer.
The Red Zone forms an ideal
laboratory for their upclose obser
vation and the length of the
game allows for a thorough analy
sis of the players' mechanics. Go
ahead, take it all in ... And should
you require more advanced imag
ing equipment, the stadium comes
equipped with a fleet of state-of
the-art jumbotrons.
If you're more into the liberal
arts, look a football game as a cul
tural study. Considering the popu
larity of the sport in our country, it
seems necessary to at least appre
ciate it as an intellectual exercise
in understanding U.S. history.
Analyze the psychology behind
the ultimate fan, listen to the poet
ics of the sports announcer, look
for instances of mob-mentality.
For those more interested in glob
al studies, you'll find worldly
cuisines in the stadium
ranging from sushi to polish
sausage.
My next piece of advice
is to develop an apprecia
tion for the fellow Stanford
fan. It's not hard if you fol
lowed my first recommen
dation and stand in the Red
Zone. You'll find yourself
surrounded completely by
cardinal-clad supporters.
Consider the determina
tion and tenacity necessary
to line up with red body
paint, nearly naked
throughout the entire sea
son. And think, what skill it
must have taken to memo
rize the lineup and stats on

the players. No wonder
they got into Stanford!
And finally take a sec
ond to admire the emotion
al connection these fans
have to the team; don't you
applaud the love they feel?
Take in excitement of
the game, notice the energy
within the crowd and check
out the band. Make some
noise. And if you are still
iffy about the game, join in
for the sake of showing ex
citement of for your school.
Be happy to be at a
school where people care
enough to go a little crazy
at the games: You don't
need to be into football to
be on board with that, and
there is plenty of Stanford
pride to go around.
