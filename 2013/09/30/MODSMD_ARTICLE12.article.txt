# Time/Out
## 
### Alex Bayer 
I think that Paris may be a con
spiracy to make you forget
about time. Somehow I've for
gotten to worry about or even think
about it. It's funny how time works:
A whole summer of time makes you
go crazy with boredom, but an hour
to finish a paper kills you with
stress.
Through most of my life, time
has been a source of anxiety. I wor
ry too much about it for my own
good. I fret about it passing too
quickly, about becoming old, about
failing to accomplish what I had
dreams about accomplishing.
In my nightmarish vision of
time, its embodiment is less a kind
ly old father than a grim reaper
claiming back my childhood little by
little; the wise elders of my family
have passed on, and the cousins I
pretended to be spies with have fi
ancees and jobs and babies on the
way. It's crazy and weird. Hilary
Duff has a kid, and though I should
be happy for her, I am sad for my
self: wistful for the childhood that
was once, and never will be again.
Alex, you say rightfully, stop be
ing so melodramatic. Time isn't that
bad. And besides, if we didn't have
limits on time, then would not life be
monotonous and meaningless? Yes, I
would have to concede, you're right.
In Paris, time seems to move dif
ferently than it does in Palo Alto.
Maybe some of you have mastered
the art of time management, but I,
alas, have not.
When the experts talk about
time management it always seems
they're talking about being able to
do your assignments on time with
out procrastinating, but I think it's
much more complicated and diffi
cult than that. Granted, I still have
problems with procrastination, but
my bigger problem is that I just
can't seem to crack a balance be
tween doing work and living life.
The more last year went on, the
more I became a slave to the domi
nant (albeit unspoken) mentality at
Stanford, one that is part caveman,
part stock trader: WORK = GOOD.
NOT WORK = BAD. If I wasn't
doing work, I was feeling guilty
about not doing work, like the para
noid dude in a psychological horror
movie: Unread emails haunted her
mind like discontented ghosts, and
with the fanaticism of a mad
philosopher scribbling aphorisms,
she scrawled out pointless to-do list
after to-do list.

I'm curious: if someone had done
a brain study of my brain during
that time, what would they have
found? What would be the ratio of
actual thinking to thinking about
how I should be thinking?
The worst was definitely the
weekends. How many times did I
scratch my plans for Half Moon Bay
or San Francisco because I had a lit
tle too much work? Sigh. Too many.
If I went to a concert on a Tuesday
night I felt like a kid playing hooky
even though that hardly made
sense. Wasn't I in college? An adult?
By now, hadn't I earned the right to
decide whether I could go to a con
cert or do my homework?
Of course, it was all in my head.
My professor wasn't going to put
me in a corner with a dunce cap. At
worst, I would get a bad grade and
it would melt in with all the other
ones and my GPA, and then what
would come of that? Would it even
make it to my resume? And if it did,
would the reader see the blood
sweat and tears or merely a num
ber? Would an artist even ask for a
resume?
My anxieties about how I used
my time only magnified my funda
mental fear of time. But just when I
was ready to write off a truce, I came
here, and I realized that time is in
credibly relative.
One of the most beautiful things
about Paris is that you can be com
pletely busy and accomplish ab
solutely nothing. As the writer
Adam Gopnick eloquently put it, "In
Paris, Americans achieve absorption
without obvious accomplishment, a

lovely and un-American emotion."
Indeed, it's as if Paris is set up to
make you forget about using time
"productively."
Take the cafe experience: You can
sit at a table for hours, wilting or
reading or simply gazing at the peo
ple drifting by. Eventually, when you
do want to leave, you might find it
difficult to flag down your waiter for
the check. Some might mistakenly
call this culture one of leisure, but
that does it a disservice. It's much
more meaningful than that: All that
nothing is full of everything. We turn
back into philosophers, thinkers and
dreamers again.
What I really love about Paris,
and why I suspect so many artists
make their homes here, is that un
like so many westernized and west
ernizing parts of the world, in Paris,
time very much stands still. No
one's asking you to be anywhere or
deliver a product. Design thinking,
for all its outward appearance of
creative spontaneity, is still ulti
mately driven towards producing a
concrete idea that will lead to a con
crete product. In Paris, there is art
for art's sake.
The metros are plastered with
adverts for experimental plays and
art exhibits, many of which are
funded by the French government,
which places a high precedence on
supporting the arts as a staple of
national pride. Maybe it is a con
spiracy of sorts, but if it's the gov
ernment we're talking about, it's
kind of the most awful way to en
courage hard work: For in Paris, it's
as if you become so distracted with
art and beauty that you forget
about accomplishing something, or
why that was ever important in the
first place.
All you need is a friend to chat
with and enough money to buy
yourself an espresso, and if you can
snag a subsidized ticket to a show or
a pass to the Pompidou, you're set.
In Paris, it's not hard to see art. It's
everywhere, and if it's not behind
closed doors then it's in the metro:
via the man peddling his voice for
change, the hipster art history ma
jors with their Doc Martens, the
spacey bohemian artists with their
dyed and wild hair. You see, I've
learned it's much easier to forget
about time when the people around
you have forgotten about it too.

art exhibits, many of which are
funded by the French government,
which places a high precedence on
supporting the arts as a staple of
national pride. Maybe it is a con
spiracy of sorts, but if it's the gov
ernment we're talking about, it's
kind of the most awful way to en
courage hard work: For in Paris, it's
as if you become so distracted with
art and beauty that you forget
about accomplishing something, or
why that was ever important in the
first place.
All you need is a friend to chat
with and enough money to buy
yourself an espresso, and if you can
snag a subsidized ticket to a show or
a pass to the Pompidou, you're set.
In Paris, it's not hard to see art. It's
everywhere, and if it's not behind
closed doors then it's in the metro:
via the man peddling his voice for
change, the hipster art history ma
jors with their Doc Martens, the
spacey bohemian artists with their
dyed and wild hair. You see, I've
learned it's much easier to forget
about time when the people around
you have forgotten about it too.

Indeed, its as if
Paris is set up to
make you forget
about using time
"productively'
I think that Paris may be a con
spiracy to make you forget
about time. Somehow I've for
gotten to worry about or even think
about it. It's funny how time works:
A whole summer of time makes you
go crazy with boredom, but an hour
to finish a paper kills you with
stress.
Through most of my life, time
has been a source of anxiety. I wor
ry too much about it for my own
good. I fret about it passing too
quickly, about becoming old, about
failing to accomplish what I had
dreams about accomplishing.
In my nightmarish vision of
time, its embodiment is less a kind
ly old father than a grim reaper
claiming back my childhood little by
little; the wise elders of my family
have passed on, and the cousins I
pretended to be spies with have fi
ancees and jobs and babies on the
way. It's crazy and weird. Hilary
Duff has a kid, and though I should
be happy for her, I am sad for my
self: wistful for the childhood that
was once, and never will be again.
Alex, you say rightfully, stop be
ing so melodramatic. Time isn't that
bad. And besides, if we didn't have
limits on time, then would not life be
monotonous and meaningless? Yes, I
would have to concede, you're right.
In Paris, time seems to move dif
ferently than it does in Palo Alto.
Maybe some of you have mastered
the art of time management, but I,
alas, have not.
When the experts talk about
time management it always seems
they're talking about being able to
do your assignments on time with
out procrastinating, but I think it's
much more complicated and diffi
cult than that. Granted, I still have
problems with procrastination, but
my bigger problem is that I just
can't seem to crack a balance be
tween doing work and living life.
The more last year went on, the
more I became a slave to the domi
nant (albeit unspoken) mentality at
Stanford, one that is part caveman,
part stock trader: WORK = GOOD.
NOT WORK = BAD. If I wasn't
doing work, I was feeling guilty
about not doing work, like the para
noid dude in a psychological horror
movie: Unread emails haunted her
mind like discontented ghosts, and
with the fanaticism of a mad
philosopher scribbling aphorisms,
she scrawled out pointless to-do list
after to-do list.

I'm curious: if someone had done
a brain study of my brain during
that time, what would they have
found? What would be the ratio of
actual thinking to thinking about
how I should be thinking?
The worst was definitely the
weekends. How many times did I
scratch my plans for Half Moon Bay
or San Francisco because I had a lit
tle too much work? Sigh. Too many.
If I went to a concert on a Tuesday
night I felt like a kid playing hooky
even though that hardly made
sense. Wasn't I in college? An adult?
By now, hadn't I earned the right to
decide whether I could go to a con
cert or do my homework?
Of course, it was all in my head.
My professor wasn't going to put
me in a corner with a dunce cap. At
worst, I would get a bad grade and
it would melt in with all the other
ones and my GPA, and then what
would come of that? Would it even
make it to my resume? And if it did,
would the reader see the blood
sweat and tears or merely a num
ber? Would an artist even ask for a
resume?
My anxieties about how I used
my time only magnified my funda
mental fear of time. But just when I
was ready to write off a truce, I came
here, and I realized that time is in
credibly relative.
One of the most beautiful things
about Paris is that you can be com
pletely busy and accomplish ab
solutely nothing. As the writer
Adam Gopnick eloquently put it, "In
Paris, Americans achieve absorption
without obvious accomplishment, a

lovely and un-American emotion."
Indeed, it's as if Paris is set up to
make you forget about using time
"productively."
Take the cafe experience: You can
sit at a table for hours, wilting or
reading or simply gazing at the peo
ple drifting by. Eventually, when you
do want to leave, you might find it
difficult to flag down your waiter for
the check. Some might mistakenly
call this culture one of leisure, but
that does it a disservice. It's much
more meaningful than that: All that
nothing is full of everything. We turn
back into philosophers, thinkers and
dreamers again.
What I really love about Paris,
and why I suspect so many artists
make their homes here, is that un
like so many westernized and west
ernizing parts of the world, in Paris,
time very much stands still. No
one's asking you to be anywhere or
deliver a product. Design thinking,
for all its outward appearance of
creative spontaneity, is still ulti
mately driven towards producing a
concrete idea that will lead to a con
crete product. In Paris, there is art
for art's sake.
