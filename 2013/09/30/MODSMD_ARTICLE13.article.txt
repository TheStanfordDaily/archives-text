## DAVIES SAVES THE DAY GOALIE MAKES 16 SAVES, SALVAGES TRIP 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 6 Cardinal field hockey team faced
fierce offenses this weekend on the East Coast,
suffering its first loss since the beginning of the
season. Despite the 3-1 defeat at the hands of No.
5 Syracuse on Saturday, Stanford was able to
bounce back on Sunday by holding off No. 11 Al
bany 2-1.

The loss to Syra
cuse (8-1,0-IACC) on
Saturday was the first
for Stanford (7-2, 1-0
NorPac) since a 2-1
double-overtime deci-

sion against No. 4 Connecticut on Aug. 31, ending
the team's six-game winning streak. Although it
pulled off the win on Sunday, the Card was
outscored overall this weekend a shock to the
team after a four-game shutout streak in which it
allowed only nine shots on goal.
Despite the goals she allowed, Cardinal goal
keeper Dulcie Davies stepped it up in net by
making a season-high six saves on Saturday and
then breaking her record the following day with
a career-best 16 stops.
Syracuse senior defender Laura Hahnefeldt
started the scoring for the Orange in the 19th
minute on Saturday when she converted on a
penalty corner. It was the first goal Stanford had
allowed in 366:44. Syracuse dominated the game
throughout the first half with five shots to Stan
ford's two and three penalty corners to Stan
ford's one.
The Orange headed into halftime with a 2-0
lead when sophomore midfielder Alyssa Manley
scored her sixth goal of the season by knocking in
a rebound off a penalty corner.
The Cardinal came back strong in the second
half, however, showing clearer signs of the Nor-
Pac frontrunner the country has seen so far this
season. With help from fellow juniors Kelsey
Harbin and Shannon Herold, midfielder Alex
McCawley was able to put Stanford on the board
in the 60th minute of play by deflecting a penalty
corner for her third goal of the season.
Stanford held strong through the last 35 min
utes — it outshot Syracuse 6-5 and held a 5-1
penalty corner advantage in the second half —
but it was too little, too late for the Cardinal.
The Orange sealed its victory with a little over
five minutes to play, when sophomore forward
Emma Russell scored off of a spin move.
The Cardinal encountered another challeng
ing start on Sunday, when Albany dominated the
first 14 minutes of the game with seven shots and
two penalty corners (leaving Stanford with zero
in each). Davies was on her game, however, mak
ing five of her 16 saves during this span.
After a Stanford timeout in the 17th minute,
the Cardinal translated Davies' intensity to the
rest of the field and closed out the half with four
shots and three penalty corners.

outside the circle. Paula

Stanford was outshot 15-5

six of which were in the final

15 minutes.
