## Freshman wins it in overtime 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
One year after an overtime win at
UC-Santa Barbara, nothing much has
changed for the Stanford men's soccer
team.
On Friday night, freshman forward
Jordan Moms netted an overtime win
ner in the 95th minute to seal a 2-1
Stanford (5-1-1) victory over the Gau
chos (4-4-0) in front of a raucous crowd
on the first weekend of school.

"This was such a tough game in
every sense," Stanford head coach Je
remy Gunn told GoStanford.com.
"Santa Barbara threw everything at
us, and it was an incredible effort by
our players to continuously weather
the storm and stay composed and play
soccer when we had the opportunities
to."
Not only did the Gauchos team
throw everything at the Cardinal
team, but the wild 7,750-person crowd
also physically threw tortillas onto the
field in a usual Santa Barbara tradi
tion. The Cardinal overcame the diffi
cult environment and clinched a cru
cial victory in its final matchup before
the start of Pac-12 play.
Morris got the scoring started in
the 31st minute off of an Aaron Kovar
free kick, heading in the first of his two
goals off the cross looking toward the
near post.
"It was lovely for Jordan to get off
the mark tonight and get on the score
sheet," Gunn said. "The goal should be
looking pretty large for him in the fu
ture."
Santa Barbara responded in the
53rd minute with a goal from senior
