## Freshman wins it in overtime 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
One year after an overtime win at
UC-Santa Barbara, nothing much has
changed for the Stanford men's soccer
team.
On Friday night, freshman forward
Jordan Moms netted an overtime win
ner in the 95th minute to seal a 2-1
Stanford (5-1-1) victory over the Gau
chos (4-4-0) in front of a raucous crowd
on the first weekend of school.

"This was such a tough game in
every sense," Stanford head coach Je
remy Gunn told GoStanford.com.
"Santa Barbara threw everything at
us, and it was an incredible effort by
our players to continuously weather
the storm and stay composed and play
soccer when we had the opportunities
to."
Not only did the Gauchos team
throw everything at the Cardinal
team, but the wild 7,750-person crowd
also physically threw tortillas onto the
field in a usual Santa Barbara tradi
tion. The Cardinal overcame the diffi
cult environment and clinched a cru
cial victory in its final matchup before
the start of Pac-12 play.
Morris got the scoring started in
the 31st minute off of an Aaron Kovar
free kick, heading in the first of his two
goals off the cross looking toward the
near post.
"It was lovely for Jordan to get off
the mark tonight and get on the score
sheet," Gunn said. "The goal should be
looking pretty large for him in the fu
ture."
Santa Barbara responded in the
53rd minute with a goal from senior

defender Peter Schmetz. His
goal was the only stain on an
otherwise perfect day from
goalkeeper Drew Hutchins,
who recorded five saves on
the night. Later, five minutes
into overtime, Morris one
timed a ball that was bounc
ing around outside of the box
into the back of the net for
the golden goal that ended
the game.
Overall, Stanford showed
true resilience in maintain
ing its poise even after sur
rendering a tying goal in the
second half. That resilience
would pay off when Morris
scored the overtime winner.
"It was an electrifying at
mosphere, and every time
they got to go forward the
crowd was deafening," Gunn
told GoStanford.com. "But it
was just an incredible per
formance by our team. Maybe
you can't claim it to be our
best performance, but you
could claim it to be our gutsi
est performance. It is some
thing that I'm very proud of.
It would have been easy to
fold [when Santa Barbara
tied it up in the second half]
they had the momentum.
But we were gutsy, deter
mined, and we kept our
selves in the hunt, and I'm
very proud of our guys."
Morris not only captured
his first two career collegiate
goals but also joined Zach

Batteer and JJ Koval as the
three players to score twice
in a game for the Cardinal so
far this season. Morris has
consistently been a starter
for Gunn's squad and has
made an impact nearly every
game, and the freshman fi
nally put his name on the
score sheet in this one.
Stanford improved to 5-1-
1 on the season, winning its
fifth straight game at an all
important time. The Cardi
nal begins Pac-12 conference

play Thursday when No. 5
Washington comes into town
at 6-0-2. Washington will be
the start of a brutal stretch
that sees the Cardinal play
Oregon State at home before
traveling to face No. 13
UCLA, San Diego State and
No. 2 Cal.
Stanford takes on Wash
ington at 7 p.m. at Cagan
Stadium Thursday night.
