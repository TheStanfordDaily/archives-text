### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's soccer
kicked off the defense of its
four straight Pac-12 titles on a
high note, as the No. 2 Cardi
nal (8-0-1, 1-0 Pac-12) buckled
the Colorado Buffaloes (8-2, 0-
1) in Boulder, Colo., by a score
of 2-0 in both teams' confer
ence opener.

In doing so, the Cardinal con
tinued to exert its dominance on
its conference foes as it extended
its conference winning streak to
43 games, which includes 23 road
contests. Saturday's result also

marked the 13th straight year
that the team has won its confer
ence opener.

tions from its usual suspects,
junior forward Taylor Uhl
and senior forward Court
ney Verloo, as the Cardinal
scored two goals in the sec
ond half for the victory.
After neither team broke
through in the first half, the
Buffaloes almost struck first
in the 51st minute when Col
orado midfielder Madison
Krauser slipped past the de
fense of senior forward Na
talie Griffen and shot the ball
just above the head of Camp
bell.
Although Campbell put
her hands up for what should
have been an easy save, the
ball bounced off of her fin
gers and went over her head,
seemingly destined for the
back of the net. However, the
quick-thinking goalkeeper
averted a big mistake by
quickly turning around and
reaching back over her shoul
der to grab the ball on a sec
ond attempt and keep the
game scoreless.
After Campbell's save,
Stanford's forwards took
over quickly. In the 57th
minute, Verloo fresh off of
a hat trick against Santa
Clara drilled the ball to
ward the goal from 25 yards
out. Her shot bounced off of
the fingertips of Colorado
goalkeeper Annie Brunner
before ricocheting off of the
left goalpost and into the net
for a 1-0 Cardinal lead.
Stanford narrowly avoid
ed giving up a goal again in
the 59th minute when a cor
ner kick by the Buffaloes was
headed towards the goal by
forward Anne Stuller, catch
ing Campbell and the entire
Cardinal defense off guard
save one defender, who de
flected it away at the goal
line.
Stanford quickly regained
control, however, when Uhl
continued her stellar season
with her ninth goal of 2013,
beating a defender and firing

a pass from Verloo into the
right side of the goal to put
the Cardinal up 2-0 in the
67th minute.
The Cardinal cruised
from then on out, allowing
the Buffaloes to take only two
more shots in the final 23
minutes as it dealt Colorado a
loss in front of a crowd of
over 1,500 to extend its win
ning streak to six matches.
