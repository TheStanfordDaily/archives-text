# STRAIGHT SETS FOR STANFORD
## CARD SWEEPS NO. 16 ASU AT MAPLES 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
After losing the first set to Cal last
Wednesday, the No. 7 Stanford
women's volleyball team (9-2, 2-0 Pac
-12) regrouped and has not lost a set
since, beating Cal 3-1 and then sweep
ing No. 16 Arizona State 3-0 (25-17,25-
19,25-22) Friday night at Maples.

"We didn't play as well as we want
ed against Cal," said senior Rachel
Williams. "We had a good practice
[Thursday] night, and we were excited
to play on our home court, because we
love Maples and we wanted to play at
the speed we wanted and control the
ball better than at Cal. We were on our
heels too much, and we really wanted
to be on our toes against ASU, and I
think we did that."
The Card experienced strong lead-
