# STRAIGHT SETS FOR STANFORD
## CARD SWEEPS NO. 16 ASU AT MAPLES 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
After losing the first set to Cal last
Wednesday, the No. 7 Stanford
women's volleyball team (9-2, 2-0 Pac
-12) regrouped and has not lost a set
since, beating Cal 3-1 and then sweep
ing No. 16 Arizona State 3-0 (25-17,25-
19,25-22) Friday night at Maples.

"We didn't play as well as we want
ed against Cal," said senior Rachel
Williams. "We had a good practice
[Thursday] night, and we were excited
to play on our home court, because we
love Maples and we wanted to play at
the speed we wanted and control the
ball better than at Cal. We were on our
heels too much, and we really wanted
to be on our toes against ASU, and I
think we did that."
The Card experienced strong lead-

Senior Rachel Williams (above) noted that the Cardinal
didn't put together its best performance in a 3-1 win
against Cal on Wednesday, but she led Stanford's sweep
of No. 16 ASU two days later with nine kills.
ership from Williams and fel
low senior Carly Wopat to
start the game off right and
never looked back. Williams
finished the game with three
blocks, six digs and a team
high nine kills, to go along
with Wopat's seven kills on
12 attempts for a .500 hitting
percentage. She also had five
digs, which puts her into
fourth place on Stanford's
all-time career blocks list
with 508.
The team also saw contri
butions from sophomore
Inky Ajanaku, whose dy
namic play and blocking
were missed during the Cal
game as she was sick and
could not play. In Friday's
game, Ajanaku had eight
kills and a season-high nine
blocks. As a team, the Cardi
nal out-blocked the Sun Dev
ils 14 to 5.
Also of note, junior libero
Kyle Gilbert recorded her
ninth game of the season
with double-digit digs,
notching 12.
"Everyone is really solid
in their roles," Williams said,
"so we're just reminding
everyone to calm down and
embrace the moment and
not get too overwhelmed and
just play the game the way
we know how to play."

Stanford recorded just
five errors to ASU's 12 in the
first set to easily overtake
the Sun Devils 25-17, con
trolling the momentum of
the game from the first
serve. The second set ended
much the same with Stan
ford hitting an impressive
.464 and winning 25-19; how
ever, the start of the set was
a lot closer, with five tie
scores and four lead changes
early on.
As Stanford's lead slowly
stretched in the third set, the
Sun Devils were forced to
call a timeout, trailing 18-12.
The Card came out of the
break without the twin towers
of Ajanaku and sophomore
Brittany Howard, and fellow
sophomore Jordan Burgess
really came alive to stick it
to the Sun Devils with three
kills in the set. Burgess fin
ished the game with seven
kills and six digs.
Neither team hit well in
the final set, with Stanford
hitting .194 and ASU hit
ting just .062. The Sun Dev
ils slowly gained back the
momentum they held early
in the second set to bring the
score close at 21-18 at a
Stanford timout. Howard re
turned to the game and imm
mediately got a block to rally
the Card, but ASU answered
back, trying to force a fourth
set, and brought the score to
23-22 behind sophomore
Macey Gardner, who had a
game-high 17 kills.

However, her efforts
weren't enough, as Williams
hit her final kill of the set to
put the game at match point
and another kill from

Ajanaku ended the set 25-22.
Beating an opponent such
as Arizona State, ranked in
the top 25, will certainly help
Stanford move toward re-en

tering the top five and give
the team confidence heading
into a tough road trip against
No. 4 USC and No. 11
UCLA this week. The Cardi

nal meets the Bruins on
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
