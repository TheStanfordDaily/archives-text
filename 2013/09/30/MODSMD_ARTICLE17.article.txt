# By fixing old issues, Card dominates
## 
### Sam Fisher 
I thought about starting this col
umn with, "Sorry for doubting
you," but that wouldn't be 100
percent accurate. Yes, I should
have known better than to pre
dict just a seven-point win this week
end at Washington State, so I'm sor
ry, but "doubt" isn't the right word to
describe my feelings about Stanford
football right now.
The only way I know to describe
what it's like to follow this Stanford
season is that it's a lot like watching in
2011. This team is dominant in just
about everyway, and it's hard to imag
ine anyone but the Oregon Ducks
beating the Cardinal. However, I'm
still nervous every time a new game
approaches.
Why? It's because, as this game
with Washington State demonstrated,
Stanford is really, really good. In fact,
these last two performances have
been so dominant that I truly believe
Stanford is good enough to win the na
tional championship. Yet in this cur
rent system of college football, one
loss â€”whether a fair defeat at the
hands of Oregon or a fluky loss in a
Seattle monsoon could derail
everything.

So while I walk into every stadium
now with the Ml expectation that the
Cardinal should win and win easily, it's
still as scary as sitting through the fi
nale of "Breaking Bad" Sunday night.
Now, for the first time, it's starting
to get even more intense than in 2011,
when we talked about believing in a
national championship run. That's
how good Stanford looked.
It wasn't just that the Cardinal
dominated a Washington State team
that, in retrospect, was probably a bit
overrated due to its victory over a def
initely overrated USC squad. It was
how Stanford did it.
The one game plan that had
stopped Stanford best in the past was
to slow down the Cardinal rushing at
tack and take your chances against
the pass. Teams that cheated their
safeties toward the line of scrimmage
had a chance to win the game, espe
cially if the conditions weren't prime
for passing.
On the other side of the ball, while
Stanford's front seven had proven to
be dominant at getting penetration,
quarterbacks who got rid of the ball
quickly to athletic receivers on the
outside had a chance to move the ball
and put up points.
But Saturday night at Centu
ry Link Field, Stanford showed once
and for all that those strategies will
not work in 2013; in fact, they'll result
in embarrassing blowouts.
Every time Wazzu brought its
safeties close to the line of scrimmage,
quarterback Kevin Hogan had an an
swer. Receivers iy Montgomery,
Michael Rector and Devon Cajuste
have wildly exceeded expectations.
Even when double or triple teamed,
all three have burned by safeties that
have crept up to help out in the run
ning game. Saturday night, those
three combined for 12 catches, 262
yards and three touchdowns. Wazzu
tried to follow Washington's script
from 2012 and found itself behind 48-
3.
And when the Cougar's had the
ball, it was even worse. All of those
bubble screens no longer work thanks
to the physicality of cornerbacks
Wayne Lyons and Alex Carter com
bined with the speed of linebackers
A.J. Tarpley and the now-healthy
Shayne Skov.
Saturday night was not the first
time Stanford showed the ability to
execute on these key points. However,
it was the first time that Stanford ex
ecuted both of them perfectly for an
entire game, on the road against a sol
id opponent, no less.
If the Cardinal plays anywhere
close to that level, Stanford can beat
anyone besides the Ducks. And if
Stanford plays exactly that well, not
even Oregon or Alabama can
stop this remarkable freight train.
So let's try to enjoy the ride.

It's starting to get
even more intense
than in 2011.
