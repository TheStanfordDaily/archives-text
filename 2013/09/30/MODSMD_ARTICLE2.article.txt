### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
StartX, the Stanford-affiliated
nonprofit startup accelerator, host
ed its fall campus Demo Day on Sat
urday, Sept. 28 with returning pre
senters and members of the latest
StartX class.
The event featured startups
aiming to tackle various problems,
from simplifying consumer retail to
solving issues of information avail
ability in the private equity market.
Here are a few standout companies
worth learning more about.
Aviate
Aviate is a smartphone app com
pany focusing on an area tradition
ally ignored by developers the
home screen of a phone. Aviate's
app allows a customizable and intel
ligent home screen for phones run
ning the Android operating system.
Founder William Choi 'O9 M.S.
'O9 explained that the origins of the
app came from a desire to have in
formation at your fingertips, infor
mation that is relevant to a user.
"Now we have smartphones that
literally know everything about
you," Choi said.
"We believe you should use that
technology as efficiently as possi
ble," he added, explaining that a
large amount of time was wasted by
users on homescreens while access
ing their devices to retrieve rele
vant data.
Aviate's intelligent interface and
screen solve that problem, Choi ex
plained.
"The product we are making is
an intelligent homescreen for your
Android phone," he said. "Whether
you are at work or at a restaurant
or going to bed, we give you the
right information at the right time."
Docmunch
A change from the generally
consumer product-focused compa
nies, Docmunch's product focuses
on data acquisition from documents
and turning unstructured data into
a structured, usable format. Doc
munch allows users to create their
own data feeds, converting streams
of unstructured data into a coherent
structure of information.
Founder Michael Feng MS 'l2
explained that the problem Doc
munch hoped to solve involved diffi
culties that companies faced when
turning data from different sources
into information that they could
use.
Pixlee
Pixlee, founded in 2012, re
turned to Demo Day with an updat
ed product and significant traction.
CEO Kyle Wong 'l2 began his
presentation by emphasizing
the positive aspects of the
StartX incubator program.
"Seventy-five percent of
our revenues came from
companies that were direct
StartX introductions," Wong
said, adding that that number
was indicative of the compa
ny's first year. "Given
that StartX doesn't take any
equity," he added, "it's a pret
ty sweet deal."
Wong explained that
Pixlee helped companies mar
ket user-generated photos.

"The problem with user-gen
erated photos," he said, "[was
that] there was a lot of quanti
ty, but not enough quality."
"Our mission is to replace
that generic, one-size-fits-all
with heavy targeted, authen
tic, user-generated content,"
Wong said.

Verdigris
With the ambitious mis
sion to "put a kink in the CO2
curve", according to the
company's website, Verdi
gris developed a software,
Building. AI, that allows
users to obtain the device
level electricity consumption
of buildings in real time. Al
though the technology itself
is not new, the way it is de

ployed in a building enables
greater understanding of
household energy consump
tion.
"It allows us to take in
formation off of the panel of
the facility, and lets us devel
op a full picture of the build
ing," said Mark Chung, CEO
and co-founder of Verdigris
who graduated from Stan
ford with a master's degree
in electrical engineering, in a
public presentation.
The company is currently
working on developing a so
phisticated artificial intelli
gence to interpret the output
of Building.Al.
