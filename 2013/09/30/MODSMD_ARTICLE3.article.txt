# SWEET RETURN
## CARD STEAMROLLS WSU FOR FOUR QUARTERS 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
So much for the curse of Century Link Field,
and so much for the Cardinal being just a 10-
point favorite.
On a rainy, windy Saturday night in Seattle,
No. 5 Stanford (4-0, 2-0 Pac-12) collected two

pick-sixes to
score 21 points
in the third
quarter and an
nihilated Wash
ington State (3-

2,1-1) in a 55-17 blowout. The victory marked the
most points that the Cardinal has scored in regu
lation since its 65-21 rout of Washington in 2011.
In a game in which Stanford utterly dominat-

Ed on both sides of the ball, junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan completed 16 of his 25 passes for
288 yards a career high and three touch
downs, including a pair to junior wide receiver
Devon Cajuste, to improve to 9-0 as a starter.
"That's been the difference between us this
year and last year. If people drop safeties down,
we have the speed and ability to go deep," said
head coach David Shaw. "Kevin's been playing
great because he's not throwing it just to throw it.
He's throwing it when it's there. We had a lot of
opportunities tonight we didn't hit all of them,
but we hit more than we missed. And that has to
be part of who we are."

returned an interception for a
touchdown. The Cardinal had
a 35-point lead midway
through the third quarter, af
ter which second- and third
string Stanford players were
put in to finish the game.
More importantly, the
Cardinal players dedicated
their win to left guard David
Yankey; in Georgia earlier on
Saturday, Yankey had attend
ed the funeral for his father,
who passed away at the age of
54 last liiesday. Yankey's re
placement, backup sophomore
left guard Josh Garnett, wore
the number "54" Yankey's
jersey number —on his
wristband during the game.
Stanford and Washington
State traded field goals early
in the first quarter, but the
Cardinal soon pulled ahead
when Hogan found Cajuste
on a skinny post for a 57-yard
touchdown. The Cougars
failed to keep pace, and one
possession later, Hogan con
nected with Cajuste once
again for a 33-yard score to
give the Cardinal a 17-3 lead.
It appeared as if Stanford
would continue to build on its
advantage late in the second
quarter when its offense was
marching in the red zone, but
Hogan underthrew a fade to
Cajuste and ended up getting

picked off in the end zone.
Hogan's interception was
not the only sloppy moment
for Stanford before the half,
as the Cardinal also unchar
acteristically committed six
penalties in the first two
quarters, two of which were
delay-of-game infractions.
But when the second half
started, the Cardinal defense
transformed from merely a
dominant unit into a scoring
machine.
On the Cougars' second
drive of the third quarter,
Murphy exploded into the
backfield to lower the boom
on quarterback Connor Halli
day, who would leave the
game two plays later. Halli
day got rid off the ball just in
time, but Richards was there
to swoop away the lob ex
tending Stanford's takeaway
streak to 28 consecutive
games and then proceeded
to bolt into the end zone,
thanks to a bone-crunching
block delivered by fifth-year
senior defensive end Ben
Gardner.
Not to be outdone, Mur
phy matched Richards' feat
shortly after Hogan found
junior wide receiver Michael
Rector for a 45-yard score in
the middle of the third quar
ter.
In a sequence almost iden
tical to his big play against
Washington at Century Link
Field last year, Murphy
tipped backup quarterback
Austin Apodaca's pass to him

self and then ran for dear life
until he reached into the end
zone to essentially put the
game away.
On paper, Stanford's four
tackles for loss weren't nearly
as impressive as its 15-tackle
for-loss performance against
the Cougars last season. But
the Cardinal effectively shut
down Mike Leach's air raid,
allowing Washington State to
convert just four of its 16
third-down conversion at
tempts. The Cardinal also
held its pass-happy opponent
to 51 rushing yards.
There was no fourth-quar
ter letdown this time, as Stan
ford continued its domination
even when the backups came
took the field. First, it was
junior Remound Wright who
broke free for a 55-yard
touchdown run; then, midway
through the fourth quarter,
sophomore Barry Sanders
scored the first touchdown of
his college career on a 22-
yard scamper.
"That's what we expect
from [Sanders]," Shaw said.
"He made three guys miss.
All those reps are going to
pay off for our young guys in
the future."
Stanford now returns
home to host No. 16 Washing
ton one of only two teams
to beat the Cardinal last sea
son this Saturday in a piv
otal Pac-12 North showdown.

Stanford and Washington
State traded field goals early
in the first quarter, but the
Cardinal soon pulled ahead
when Hogan found Cajuste
on a skinny post for a 57-yard
touchdown. The Cougars
failed to keep pace, and one
possession later, Hogan con
nected with Cajuste once
again for a 33-yard score to
give the Cardinal a 17-3 lead.
It appeared as if Stanford
would continue to build on its
advantage late in the second
quarter when its offense was
marching in the red zone, but
Hogan underthrew a fade to
Cajuste and ended up getting

picked off in the end zone.
Hogan's interception was
not the only sloppy moment
for Stanford before the half,
as the Cardinal also unchar
acteristically committed six
penalties in the first two
quarters, two of which were
delay-of-game infractions.
But when the second half
started, the Cardinal defense
transformed from merely a
dominant unit into a scoring
machine.
On the Cougars' second
drive of the third quarter,
Murphy exploded into the
backfield to lower the boom
on quarterback Connor Halli
day, who would leave the
game two plays later. Halli
day got rid off the ball just in
time, but Richards was there
to swoop away the lob ex
tending Stanford's takeaway
streak to 28 consecutive
games and then proceeded
to bolt into the end zone,
thanks to a bone-crunching
block delivered by fifth-year
senior defensive end Ben
Gardner.
Not to be outdone, Mur
phy matched Richards' feat
shortly after Hogan found
junior wide receiver Michael
Rector for a 45-yard score in
the middle of the third quar
ter.
In a sequence almost iden
tical to his big play against
Washington at Century Link
Field last year, Murphy
tipped backup quarterback
Austin Apodaca's pass to him

self and then ran for dear life
until he reached into the end
zone to essentially put the
game away.
On paper, Stanford's four
tackles for loss weren't nearly
as impressive as its 15-tackle
for-loss performance against
the Cougars last season. But
the Cardinal effectively shut
down Mike Leach's air raid,
allowing Washington State to
convert just four of its 16
third-down conversion at
tempts. The Cardinal also
held its pass-happy opponent
to 51 rushing yards.
There was no fourth-quar
ter letdown this time, as Stan
ford continued its domination
even when the backups came
took the field. First, it was
junior Remound Wright who
broke free for a 55-yard
touchdown run; then, midway
through the fourth quarter,
sophomore Barry Sanders
scored the first touchdown of
his college career on a 22-
yard scamper.
"That's what we expect
from [Sanders]," Shaw said.
"He made three guys miss.
All those reps are going to
pay off for our young guys in
the future."

Sophomore wide receiver Michael Rector went for 93 yards on just two catches, one of
them for a touchdown, as Stanford's deep passing game took off against the Cougars.
So much for the curse of Century Link Field,
and so much for the Cardinal being just a 10-
point favorite.
On a rainy, windy Saturday night in Seattle,

Kevin Hogan completed 16 of his 25 passes for

downs, including a pair to junior wide receiver
Devon Cajuste, to improve to 9-0 as a starter.
"That's been the difference between us this
year and last year. If people drop safeties down,
we have the speed and ability to go deep," said
head coach David Shaw. "Kevin's been playing
great because he's not throwing it just to throw it.
He's throwing it when it's there. We had a lot of
opportunities tonight we didn't hit all of them,
but we hit more than we missed. And that has to
be part of who we are."
