# ACADEMICS
## WAYS requirements meet mixed reactions 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
As students started classes last
week, the Class of 2017 freshmen did so
with a new set of general education re
quirements (GERs) on their to-do lists.
The Ways of Thinking/Ways of Do
ing (WAYS) GERs, under which at
least 390 courses qualify for credit, is
intended to confer students greater
flexibility by letting them fulfill re
quirements with classes from a variety
of departments.
The new GERs will require stu
dents to take 11 total classes and at
least one in each WAYS category: Aes

thetic and Interpretive Inquiry, Social
Inquiry, Scientific Method and Analy
sis, Formal Reasoning, Applied Quan
titative Reasoning, Engaging Diversi
ty, Ethical Reasoning and Creative
Expression.
A variety of current classes can
qualify for each category.
For example, PHYSICS 113: Com
putational Physics is certified to fulfill
the Applied Quantitative Reasoning
(WAY-AQR) requirement as is
EARTHSYS 185: Feeding Nine Bil
lion.
"I like the perspective it gives,"
said Mac Arthur grant recipient David
Lobell Ph.D. 'O5, instructor for Feed

ing Nine Billion, of the new GERs. Be
fore his class was certified, he made
sure it fit the criteria of the AQR re
quirement.
"I'm making certain homework as
signments and a lot of the in-class ac
tivities much more calculation based
as opposed to reading and writing es
says," Lobell said. "I think that this
will make me feel justified in doing it
quite a bit more."
Lobell's class will focus on using
numbers to reason through argu
ments, not just the qualitative nature
of arguments.
