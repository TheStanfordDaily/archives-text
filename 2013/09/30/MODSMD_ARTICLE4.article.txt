## WAYS requirements meet mixed reactions 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
As students started classes last
week, the Class of 2017 freshmen did so
with a new set of general education re
quirements (GERs) on their to-do lists.
The Ways of Thinking/Ways of Do
ing (WAYS) GERs, under which at
least 390 courses qualify for credit, is
intended to confer students greater
flexibility by letting them fulfill re
quirements with classes from a variety
of departments.
The new GERs will require stu
dents to take 11 total classes and at
least one in each WAYS category: Aes

thetic and Interpretive Inquiry, Social
Inquiry, Scientific Method and Analy
sis, Formal Reasoning, Applied Quan
titative Reasoning, Engaging Diversi
ty, Ethical Reasoning and Creative
Expression.
A variety of current classes can
qualify for each category.
For example, PHYSICS 113: Com
putational Physics is certified to fulfill
the Applied Quantitative Reasoning
(WAY-AQR) requirement as is
EARTHSYS 185: Feeding Nine Bil
lion.
"I like the perspective it gives,"
said Mac Arthur grant recipient David
Lobell Ph.D. 'O5, instructor for Feed

ing Nine Billion, of the new GERs. Be
fore his class was certified, he made
sure it fit the criteria of the AQR re
quirement.
"I'm making certain homework as
signments and a lot of the in-class ac
tivities much more calculation based
as opposed to reading and writing es
says," Lobell said. "I think that this
will make me feel justified in doing it
quite a bit more."
Lobell's class will focus on using
numbers to reason through argu
ments, not just the qualitative nature
of arguments.

TAPS 103: Beginning Improvising,
taught by Dan
Klein AB '9 1, fulfills a new
WAYS requirement.
"My expectations are that
students will come in with a
better understanding of why
the calculations might be a
useful way of looking at
things," he said.
Other instructors are
working on adjusting their
class to adapt to changes the
requirement may pose, in
cluding Daniel Klein AB '9l,
the instructor for TAPS 103:
Beginning Improvising,
which fulfills the Creative Ex
pression requirement.
"The only challenge is real
ly capacity and figuring out how
to meet the need," Klein said.
"If my class is also meeting a
requirement in the university
then I'm anticipating having to

turn away some students."
In response to any capaci
ty issues, Klein anticipates
scaling his class by breaking it
up into small groups. Despite
these strains on capacity, how
ever, he said he is excited for
the new WAYS requirements.
"I like that the University
is expanding the offerings to
meet the needs of the entire
student body," Klein said.
"I've seen a number of differ
ent attempts at these various
graduation requirements, and
I like this one."
But not all freshman in the
Class of 2017 were as excited
for the new set of GERs.
"You have all the classes
you have to do for your major,
and you have to cram all of
your WAYS in by the time you
graduate," said Grace Tam
'l7.
However, Tam also said
she liked that the require

ments give students more
room to explore and become a
more well-rounded person.
Other students didn't find
the new GERs quite as daunt
ing.
"I think that they intimi
date us with it in the begin
ning, but once we start re
searching it, it's actually easy
to fulfill the requirements,"
said Sharon Kam 'l7, a poten
tial biology major.
Brandon Schow 'l5 said
that, even though he isn't re
quired to fulfill the require
ments as an upperclassman,
he liked the range of classes
the WAYS requirements al
low students to take.
"I know that you're able to
use dance classes, and that
could be really cool," Schow
said.
