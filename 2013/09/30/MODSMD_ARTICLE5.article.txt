Abbas Milani is the director of the
Iranian Studies Program at Stanford,
co-director of the Iran Democracy
Project at the Hoover Institution and
author of the book "The Shah," among
others. With recent news of direct
talks between Iran's President Has
san Rouhani and the Obama adminis
tration, The Daily sat down with Mi
lani to provide a context for the re
vived presence of US-Iran relations in
the media sphere.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What do

you see as the main challenges facing
Iran? Of these issues, what are the
Iranian people expecting President
Rouhani to improve on?
Abbas Milani (AM): Domestically the
biggest challenge, by far, is the econo
my.
Unemployment is officially at 20
percent... realistically at about 40 per
cent. Inflation is increasing above 40
percent, and realistically it's about
probably double that. Oil revenues,
which are 80 percent of the govern
ment's source of revenue, are dwin
dling. There is no sign of increase in
fact every indication shows that with
the sanctions increase there will be

further dwindling.
The second challenge is that the
right-wingers are now regrouping and
are trying to rock any reversal of
diplomacy that would hurt them eco
nomically and politically. We can look
to further tensions there within the
regime.
The more strategic tension is that
Iran is a multi-linguistic, multi-ethnic
country, and there are increasing signs
of dismantlement amongst the Kurds,
amongst the Turks, amongst the
Balochi, and holding the country to
gether as it has been for 2,000 years is

going to take some savvy hope
fully Mr. Rouhani will have that.
TSD: Regarding the economic
challenges, what do you expect
President Rouhani's position to be
in terms of mitigating the debilitat
ing economic effects of the sanc
tions imposed by the United States
on the Iranian people?
AM: I expect [President Rouhani]
to do two things. First of all: to stop
some of the utter corrupt incompe
tence that defined Ahmadinejad.
If [Ahmadinejad's administra
tion] had not squandered billions
and billions by some accounts
seven hundred billions of dollars in
the last seven to eight years
they could have weathered the
sanctioning much more easily. So
one aspect of what I expect
Rouhani to do is to try, but it's not
going to be easy because the gov
ernment is so used to corruption
and losing money.
The second thing I expect him
to do is to see as quickly as possible

whether he can find away of easing
sanctions. More oil, import more
and attract more foreign invest
ment. They have already an
nounced a major program to at
tract new tourism. They are trying
to increase the revenue, control the
expenditure, bring the budget un
der control, create some employ
ment and get out of the mess that
Ahmadinejad has created.

TSD: Upon his election, President
Rouhani spoke about "resetting re
lationships around the world." Do
you think that he is going to be will
ing to make the necessary reforms
to the trajectory of the Iranian nu
clear efforts, as well as simultane
ously restore relations with the
West?
AM: His views are that, "We are
not going to give up our program,
but we are willing to make the
kinds of concessions that would al
low the international community's
mind to rest at ease and would al
low us to continue some from of
peaceful nuclear program."
At the same time, the fact is
that there are radical groups on
both sides in the West and Israel,
and in Iran, that don't want these
negotiations to be fruitful. Tension

is in their benefit, and they might
well find away of torpedoing this.
Rouhani has some room to maneu
ver, but he can't maneuver too
much. He has to concoct a solution
that can be sold at home as a victo
ry over the West and over Israel,
and then be acceptable very much
to the West and Israel as a serious
enough concession to allow the
regime to continue. It sounds like
an oxymoron, but that's exactly
what he has to do.

TSD: Taking matters from the
other side, what does the interna
tional community need to do in or

der to act affirmatively towards
Iran, yet without removing
Rouhani's capability of reforming
his country with the support of his
people?
AM: The difficulty that the inter
national community faces is that,
on the one hand, they don't want to
make no response, but on the oth
er, the Iranian regime is now in a
much better negotiating mood be
cause it is feeling the effect of the
sanctions.
You don't want to completely
let them off the hook, but you also
don't want to hurt the Iranian peo
ple unnecessarily. The Iranian
population is overwhelmingly pro-
Western, and that is a very impor
tant political capital not to squan
der. Finding a balance between
these two, in other words
telling Rouhani that his good be
havior is going to be rewarded but
at the same time not falling prey to
some shenanigans of the regime ...
making some pretend concessions
and then going back as soon as the
pressure is lifted is going to be
the challenge of the U.S. policy

TSD: Looking back 20 years from
now, what should the United
States have done regarding its ap

proach to Iran and the nuclear
weapons program?
AM: I think they should have ac
cepted early on that Iran has the
right to enriched uranium within
the NPC but that, because [lran]
has lied in the past, because it has
launched programs without duly
notifying the lAEA, it needs to
sign the Protocol; it needs to ac
cept more intrusive inspections.
I think that the outline of an
agreement is fairly evident. Iran
continues at five-percent enrich
ment, it opens up all of its nuclear
sites and it makes a very clear cat
egorical statement that is in some
ways verifiable, that it won't take
larger steps towards weaponizing.
If they had insisted on trying to
do that, I think there would have
been an agreement some time ago.
Rouhani was very close to getting
this deal, and radicals torpedoed
it. Whether the 'torpedoists' will
succeed in torpedoing it again, I
hope not. But there are enough
people in Iran who are worried that
unless they make some kind of a
concession, the whole system will
collapse.

Rouhani has
some room to
maneuver, but he
can t maneuver
too much.
