Abbas Milani is the director of the
Iranian Studies Program at Stanford,
co-director of the Iran Democracy
Project at the Hoover Institution and
author of the book "The Shah," among
others. With recent news of direct
talks between Iran's President Has
san Rouhani and the Obama adminis
tration, The Daily sat down with Mi
lani to provide a context for the re
vived presence of US-Iran relations in
the media sphere.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What do

you see as the main challenges facing
Iran? Of these issues, what are the
Iranian people expecting President
Rouhani to improve on?
Abbas Milani (AM): Domestically the
biggest challenge, by far, is the econo
my.
Unemployment is officially at 20
percent... realistically at about 40 per
cent. Inflation is increasing above 40
percent, and realistically it's about
probably double that. Oil revenues,
which are 80 percent of the govern
ment's source of revenue, are dwin
dling. There is no sign of increase in
fact every indication shows that with
the sanctions increase there will be

further dwindling.
The second challenge is that the
right-wingers are now regrouping and
are trying to rock any reversal of
diplomacy that would hurt them eco
nomically and politically. We can look
to further tensions there within the
regime.
The more strategic tension is that
Iran is a multi-linguistic, multi-ethnic
country, and there are increasing signs
of dismantlement amongst the Kurds,
amongst the Turks, amongst the
Balochi, and holding the country to
gether as it has been for 2,000 years is
