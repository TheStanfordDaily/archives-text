# 'Perimeter trail' design proposed
## Parking situation near The Dish sparks controversy 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO DESK EDITOR 
The University recently announced a fi
nalized design of a new proposed 'perimeter
trail,' after San Mateo County rejected Stan
ford's proposal to fix the Lower Alpine Trail in
December 2011.
The new circular trail will connect several
roads, including Junipero Serra Boulevard,
Stanford Avenue and Quarry Road.
According to James Sweeney Ph.D. '7l,
professor of management science and engi
neering and president of the Stanford Cam
pus Residential Leaseholders (SCRL), this
"well-designed system of trails" provides "su
perb connectivity." It allows walkers, joggers
and cyclists to travel from the Baylands Na
ture Reserve all the way up to the
Arastradero Preserve in the foothills.
While the increased connectivity brought
about by the perimeter trail has generally
been well received, the impact of the trail on
the parking situation near The Dish is cloud
ed in controversy.
By preventing cars from parking down
one side of Stanford Avenue, the trail will cut
the available parking spots down from 60 to
27. However, 33 compensatory spaces will be
made available on Coyote Hill Road.
Many people from outer regions such as
Los Altos and Palo Alto lament the loss of
parking and the extra half-mile they have to
walk to and from the Dish.
"[People] don't want to walk to their walk
they want to drive to their walk," Sweeney
said.
Stanford residents, for their part, tend to
be more open to the change in parking situa
tion, as it alleviates the previous chaotic situa
tion with cars parked on both sides of the
road, which Sweeney described as "an acci
dent waiting to happen."
Sweeney's wish that residents, including
students, participate in Stanford's decision
making process regarding its final trail design
came true.
"There were hundreds and hundreds of
emails to the Santa Clara county board of su
pervisors, including many from students who
expressed then* views," Sweeney said. "Many
people came to communicate at public hear
ings. It became a very good, open process."
