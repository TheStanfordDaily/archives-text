# 'Perimeter trail' design proposed
## Parking situation near The Dish sparks controversy 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO DESK EDITOR 
The University recently announced a fi
nalized design of a new proposed 'perimeter
trail,' after San Mateo County rejected Stan
ford's proposal to fix the Lower Alpine Trail in
December 2011.
The new circular trail will connect several
roads, including Junipero Serra Boulevard,
Stanford Avenue and Quarry Road.
According to James Sweeney Ph.D. '7l,
professor of management science and engi
neering and president of the Stanford Cam
pus Residential Leaseholders (SCRL), this
"well-designed system of trails" provides "su
perb connectivity." It allows walkers, joggers
and cyclists to travel from the Baylands Na
ture Reserve all the way up to the
Arastradero Preserve in the foothills.
While the increased connectivity brought
about by the perimeter trail has generally
been well received, the impact of the trail on
the parking situation near The Dish is cloud
ed in controversy.
By preventing cars from parking down
one side of Stanford Avenue, the trail will cut
the available parking spots down from 60 to
27. However, 33 compensatory spaces will be
made available on Coyote Hill Road.
Many people from outer regions such as
Los Altos and Palo Alto lament the loss of
parking and the extra half-mile they have to
walk to and from the Dish.
"[People] don't want to walk to their walk
they want to drive to their walk," Sweeney
said.
Stanford residents, for their part, tend to
be more open to the change in parking situa
tion, as it alleviates the previous chaotic situa
tion with cars parked on both sides of the
road, which Sweeney described as "an acci
dent waiting to happen."
Sweeney's wish that residents, including
students, participate in Stanford's decision
making process regarding its final trail design
came true.
"There were hundreds and hundreds of
emails to the Santa Clara county board of su
pervisors, including many from students who
expressed then* views," Sweeney said. "Many
people came to communicate at public hear
ings. It became a very good, open process."
Paul Ufa M.D. '9l, a profes
sor in the School of Medicine
and leader of the Committee
to Fix Lower Alpine Trail,
echoed Sweeney's enthusi
asm for the project, qualify
ing it as "fabulous."
However, the sense of dis
appointment he feels about
the abandonment of the origi
nal Lower Alpine trail project
which can, according to
Sweeney, be attributed to
strong objections advanced
by the Alpine residents to a

trail going through their
neighborhood still hasn't
faded.
"It's a shame we couldn't
use Stanford's money [to fix
the trail]," he said.
In December 2011, Stan
ford proposed to spend $lO
million to repair the Lower
Alpine Trail. Stanford and
Santa Clara County agreed to
a contract seven years ago re
quiring the University to pay
the $lO million to Santa Clara
County money that would
solely be used for recreation
al purposes for Stanford cam
pus residents and facility
users if San Mateo County
chose not to use the fund to
revamp its trail.

Although the San Mateo
County has now budgeted
over two million dollars to fix
the trail from Portola Valley
to Piers Lane, Utz pointed
out that no action is being tak
en to address the problem of
congestion on Alpine Road.
Had Stanford's project
been approved, a frontage
road and a much wider trail,
separated by a fencing, would
have seen built.
"[The proposed change is]
better than the current situa
tion, which is extremely dan
gerous, but it's far from ideal,"
Utz said.
