## Professor wins high French cultural honor 
### â€“ Helm Gao 
Robert Harrison, professor of Italian literature,
was recently awarded the diploma and honorific title
of "Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres," one
of the highest cultural honors in France, by Aurelie
Filippetti, the French Minister of Culture and Com
munication.
Previously awarded to T.S. Eliot, Vaclav Havel
and George Clooney, among others, the award aims to
recognize prominent authors or artists who have ex
panded the limits of arts in France and the rest of the
world.
Harrison, a prolific and eminent author, has con
tributed to the New York Review of Books and is the
author of several well-acclaimed books, including
"The Body of Beatrice," "Forests: The Shadow of Civ
ilization," "The Dominion of the Dead" and "Gardens:
An Essay on the Human Condition."
Apart from his literary contributions, he is also
well known as the host of "Entitled Opinions," a
weekly radio talk show traversing several genres of
the humanities.
Harrison's new book, "Juvenescence: A Cultural
History of Our Age," will come out in the autumn of
2014.
"It's hard to characterize succinctly what [the
book] is about," he said in an interview with The Book
Haven. "What kind of age are we, culturally speaking,
at this time? How old are we in this particular age?"
