## OP-ED A 						Call to Public Service II 
### 
While Thomas Ehrlich grew
up in a time when most
Americans shared a strong
sense of civic responsibility, I grew
up surrounded by the boom of the
Internet and digital media. Tech
nology has fundamentally changed
the way we are able to interact with
others in civic work, as we discuss
in the last chapter of our book. I
have used technology to connect
with dozens of young civic leaders
around the world, and in writing
my portions of our book, Civic
Work, Civic Lessons: Two Genera
tions Reflect on Public Service, I
tell some of their stories, of which
one is included below.
We use the term "civic work"
synonymously with "public service"
to include both work in public poli
cy, politics, and government and al
so work in non-profit organizations
that promote the public good. We
chose the term "civic work" to lead
in our title because we have found
that "public service" is often not
understood as covering nonprofit
work of the kind that I and the
young people I know engage in.
In my teenage years, I started a
nonprofit organization, Visual Arts
and Music for Society, to share the
power of music. I encouraged fel
low high-school musicians to use
their talents to organize events for
people in need. Our audiences in
cluded abused women, homeless
families, orphans, and senior citi
zens.
This initiative pushed me to im
merse myself in a range of civic
ventures that other young people
were engaged in throughout the
country. The summer before col
lege, I joined a national board re
sponsible for allocating State Farm
Insurance's philanthropy dollars to
youth civic causes. I have since
been engaged in many other civic
organizations and am now on the
committee shaping a new leader
ship and service center at the Pre
sidio in San Francisco.
A key lesson in our book is that
public service should serve the
public interest, which can mean
providing basic human needs
through nonprofit organizations as
well as through government agen
cies.
Luis Ortiz is a young civic leader
whom Tom and I interviewed. As I
describe in our book, Luis works
with the Latin America organiza
tion Un Techo para mi Pais ("A
Roof for My Country") to construct
transitional houses for people who
literally have no roof over their
heads.
Luis helps provide a basic hu
man necessity—a home —to those
who cannot afford to buy or con
struct their own. In time, those
people may gain the resources to
acquire their own houses, but in the
interim, this group ensures that
they will have a place to call

"home."
Luis told me about one day
when he splashed his face over and
over again, allowing warm water to
trickle down his forehead and
cheeks. But he still felt dirty. He
had just returned from "The Ice," a
small village in central Mexico City
that was aptly named for its cold
weather. Beyond the cold, Luis re
called the grim life of the residents
living in mud. He remembered kids
with their knees covered with
mounds of dried dirt who attempt
ed to push wooden toy cars across
the mud. The mud pushed back at
the wheels of their cars, preventing
them from moving any distance.
Luis lived in "The Ice" for three
days. During that time, he worked
to lift planks of wood, hammer
nails, and ultimately, build a home.
When he finished building the
home, it remained clean for a few
minutes until one of the boys ran in
side the house, and pushed his
soiled car across the clean wooden
floor planks.
That was one moment that con
firmed Luis' interest in serving the
public, particularly in helping those
in need of the basic necessities of
life. Although he had felt filthy on
the outside, he felt clean and puri
fied on the inside. Upon returning
home, taking a lukewarm shower
wasn't enough. He had to do more
than help that one family. He had to
build more houses.
Tom Ehrlich and I are eager to
see youth civic energy not only con
tinue to grow, but also to focus
some of its attention on politics and
public policy. We are just as eager
to see the realm of public policy and
politics learn from the nonprofit
civic work in which so many youth
groups are now engaged.
If our democracy is to flourish,
youth must become much more ac
tive in public affairs and use the
tools of digital media and other new
technologies. Four key steps, as I
describe in the book, should be fol
lowed to enhance civic work by us
ing existing technologies and other
new technologies that will emerge
in the years ahead. These steps are:
attract, engage, act, and measure.
Every generation has reshaped
American civil society to meet the
difficulties of its times. American
youth today face particularly trou
bling challenges, both domestic and
international. We are convinced
that youth civic engagement can
master those challenges. Tom and I
hope our intergenerational vantage
points offer useful insights for
America's youth and for those who
advise them.

my portions of our book, Civic
Work, Civic Lessons: Two Genera
tions Reflect on Public Service, I
tell some of their stories, of which
one is included below.
We use the term "civic work"
synonymously with "public service"
to include both work in public poli
cy, politics, and government and al
so work in non-profit organizations
that promote the public good. We
chose the term "civic work" to lead
in our title because we have found
that "public service" is often not
understood as covering nonprofit
work of the kind that I and the
young people I know engage in.
In my teenage years, I started a
nonprofit organization, Visual Arts
and Music for Society, to share the
power of music. I encouraged fel
low high-school musicians to use
their talents to organize events for
people in need. Our audiences in
cluded abused women, homeless
families, orphans, and senior citi
zens.
This initiative pushed me to im
merse myself in a range of civic
ventures that other young people
were engaged in throughout the
country. The summer before col
lege, I joined a national board re
sponsible for allocating State Farm
Insurance's philanthropy dollars to
youth civic causes. I have since
been engaged in many other civic
organizations and am now on the
committee shaping a new leader
ship and service center at the Pre
sidio in San Francisco.
A key lesson in our book is that
public service should serve the
public interest, which can mean
providing basic human needs
through nonprofit organizations as
well as through government agen
cies.
Luis Ortiz is a young civic leader
whom Tom and I interviewed. As I
describe in our book, Luis works
with the Latin America organiza
tion Un Techo para mi Pais ("A
Roof for My Country") to construct
transitional houses for people who
literally have no roof over their
heads.
Luis helps provide a basic hu
man necessity—a home —to those
who cannot afford to buy or con
struct their own. In time, those
people may gain the resources to
acquire their own houses, but in the
interim, this group ensures that
they will have a place to call

"home."
Luis told me about one day
when he splashed his face over and
over again, allowing warm water to
trickle down his forehead and
cheeks. But he still felt dirty. He
had just returned from "The Ice," a
small village in central Mexico City
that was aptly named for its cold
weather. Beyond the cold, Luis re
called the grim life of the residents
living in mud. He remembered kids
with their knees covered with
mounds of dried dirt who attempt
ed to push wooden toy cars across
the mud. The mud pushed back at
the wheels of their cars, preventing
them from moving any distance.
Luis lived in "The Ice" for three
days. During that time, he worked
to lift planks of wood, hammer
nails, and ultimately, build a home.
When he finished building the
home, it remained clean for a few
minutes until one of the boys ran in
side the house, and pushed his
soiled car across the clean wooden
floor planks.
That was one moment that con
firmed Luis' interest in serving the
public, particularly in helping those
in need of the basic necessities of
life. Although he had felt filthy on
the outside, he felt clean and puri
fied on the inside. Upon returning
home, taking a lukewarm shower
wasn't enough. He had to do more
than help that one family. He had to
build more houses.
Tom Ehrlich and I are eager to
see youth civic energy not only con
tinue to grow, but also to focus
some of its attention on politics and
public policy. We are just as eager
to see the realm of public policy and
politics learn from the nonprofit
civic work in which so many youth
groups are now engaged.
If our democracy is to flourish,
youth must become much more ac
tive in public affairs and use the
tools of digital media and other new
technologies. Four key steps, as I
describe in the book, should be fol
lowed to enhance civic work by us
ing existing technologies and other
new technologies that will emerge
in the years ahead. These steps are:
attract, engage, act, and measure.
Every generation has reshaped
American civil society to meet the
difficulties of its times. American
youth today face particularly trou
bling challenges, both domestic and
international. We are convinced
that youth civic engagement can
master those challenges. Tom and I
hope our intergenerational vantage
points offer useful insights for
America's youth and for those who
advise them.
