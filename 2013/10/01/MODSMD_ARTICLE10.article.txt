## OP-ED Bring Back Aerial Fabrics 
### – Clementine Jacoby '14 
I left Stanford last year to join a
circus in Brazil. For 10 hours a
day I trained in a professional
program and taught aerial fabrics
to low-income youth in Rio's fave
las. I owe that year, in large part, to
the Stanford aerial arts program,
where my flare for fabrics was born
and bred.
Aerial fabrics is a circus art it
involves doing acrobatics while sus
pended from a thick strand of silk.
Last spring, Stanford counted itself
among the tiny handful of universi
ties with an aerial program. No sin
gle campus program, including my
major, has shaped my life so signif
icantly. But aerial fabrics classes
won't be offered this fall. The pro
gram, formerly underneath the
Stanford Outdoors umbrella, will
no longer be supported by Stanford
Outdoor Education (SOE).
Since its conception in 2008, the
student-run aerial fabrics program
has taught hundreds of faculty, stu
dents and staff. Students taught
the classes, baked brownies for
showcases, determined curriculum
and safety protocols, and turned a
profit. If the Stanford administra
tion is dedicated to supporting stu
dent-driven initiatives with broad
reach and impact, they should rein
state the Stanford Aerial Fabrics
Program.
Aerial classes were held at the
rock-climbing wall, where 25-foot
silks were rigged from the cross
beams. Aerial fabrics is an outra
geously hard workout. Even simple
poses oblige you to climb the silk,
requiring myriad muscles most
people have never used. Making
the poses beautiful requires grace
and flexibility. And all this precedes
the creative expression and brute
endurance that routine building de
mands.
Honing it all in simultaneity
feels like wielding a superpower,
and once offered entry into this
guild of beautiful badassery, I nev
er looked back. The circus people
became my people. The Stanford
aerial community was encouraging,
non-hierarchical, and physically im
pressive in the extreme.
Circus training is usually pro
hibitively expensive, but Stanford
was able to re-purpose existing in
frastructure and take advantage of
students' skills instead of hiring ex
pensive coaches. Experienced stu
dent instructors taught classes dur
ing hours when the wall wasn't

booked for climbing.
In terms of resources, the pro
gram asked for very little. We
hoped that after five years of
demonstrating that it could gener
ate enthusiastic demand, remain fi
nancially self-sufficient, and keep
students safe that aerial fabrics
would getmoresupport from the
University this year. It's frustrat
ing, as a student, to see Stanford in
vest in more expensive and less
popular programs while ignoring
student-driven endeavors with low
overhead and high impact.
This neglect is particularly bit
ter because these are exactly the
type of initiatives that Stanford is
famous for. The administration
should not underestimate the pow
er of extracurricular activities
especially those that combine nov
elty and rigor —in attracting to
this campus hardworking high
school students who think outside
the box.
It's uncommon to be able to
dabble in circus the training is
intense and expensive. But circus
has a mystical allure that lots of
people want to try.
The program was popular among
students, growing steadily each
quarter. When I came to Stanford
three years ago, there were two
teachers and maybe 15 students.
Last spring, there were 100 stu
dents registered and 50 waitlisted.
Again, many of us hoped that with
demand outstripping resources,
and with SOE moving into their
new digs, the fabrics program
would inherit the old space (or be
given the opportunity to expand as
well). Instead, it was canceled, and
we were told to find a new "organi
zational home."
We don't care what our organi
zational home is. We just need the
University's support to be able to
take and teach classes. Yes, this
change dampens the vibrancy of
the campus extracurricular com
munity. And yes, stopping the be
ginner classes where I routinely
watch students gain otherwise-nev
er-discovered muscles and friends
—is very sad. But it's a much
stiffen tonic for those already com
mitted to fabrics. This program has
defined and will I hope con
tinue to shape the Stanford experi
ence of many students and staff on
campus. Let's bring it back.

—is very sad. But it's a much

defined and will I hope con
tinue to shape the Stanford experi
ence of many students and staff on
campus. Let's bring it back.
I left Stanford last year to join a
circus in Brazil. For 10 hours a
day I trained in a professional
program and taught aerial fabrics
to low-income youth in Rio's fave
las. I owe that year, in large part, to
the Stanford aerial arts program,
where my flare for fabrics was born
and bred.
Aerial fabrics is a circus art it
involves doing acrobatics while sus
pended from a thick strand of silk.
Last spring, Stanford counted itself
among the tiny handful of universi
ties with an aerial program. No sin
gle campus program, including my
major, has shaped my life so signif
icantly. But aerial fabrics classes
won't be offered this fall. The pro
gram, formerly underneath the
Stanford Outdoors umbrella, will
no longer be supported by Stanford
Outdoor Education (SOE).
Since its conception in 2008, the
student-run aerial fabrics program
has taught hundreds of faculty, stu
dents and staff. Students taught
the classes, baked brownies for
showcases, determined curriculum
and safety protocols, and turned a
profit. If the Stanford administra
tion is dedicated to supporting stu
dent-driven initiatives with broad
reach and impact, they should rein
state the Stanford Aerial Fabrics
Program.
Aerial classes were held at the
rock-climbing wall, where 25-foot
silks were rigged from the cross
beams. Aerial fabrics is an outra
geously hard workout. Even simple
poses oblige you to climb the silk,
requiring myriad muscles most
people have never used. Making
the poses beautiful requires grace
and flexibility. And all this precedes
the creative expression and brute
endurance that routine building de
