# Separate and Unequal
## 
### Nick Ahamed 
From SCOTUS's Fisher v.
University of Texas decision
to the anniversary Martin
Luther King's "I Have a Dream
Speech," this summer was rife with
claims that the post-racial era has
come. True minorities are better
off than they were 50 years ago. But
for anyone who saw the film "Fruit
vale Station," you'll know that all
are not yet equal under the law.
But while "Fruitvale" highlights
the inequalities of our laws, I see it
as simply an outcome of a much big
ger problem: separate and unequal
education. The discrepancy starts
far before college admissions and
high school dropout rates are is
sues. Indeed, many studies demon
strate that minority children are
less prepared for kindergarten than
white children.
They also suggest that half of
the black-white achievement gap at
high school graduation could be
eliminated if all students were
equally prepared for the first grade.
Other studies then ask why the gap
starts so early; two such studies
find that your neighborhood and
your family background are strong
determinants.
In the latter case, researchers
demonstrate that beyond socio-eco
nomic status, simply the number of
parents and siblings of a student
can significantly affect his or her
performance. They also note that
black students are twice as likely to
live in non-traditional households,
where individual parents can be ab
sent, than white students a fact
that explains, in part, the race dis
parity in education.
As these out-of-school effects
start to take hold, they are com
pounded by in-school differences.
Forty percent of African-American
students don't graduate high
school. Claude Steele argues that
this number is so high because of
stereotypes and anxiety. Minority

students face a "negative intellectu
al stereotype" and are anxious
about confirming that generaliza
tion; that anxiety decreases per
formance in educational settings.
Studying Stanford students,
Steele and Joshua Aronson con
clude that putting African-Ameri
cans in an ability-testing situation
leads to lower performances than
whites in that situation or African-
Americans who took the same test
in a non-diagnostic context. Similar
ly, the University of Oklahoma's Ja
son Osborne concludes that as
much as 40 percent of the race
achievement gap can be explained
by this stereotype-induced anxiety.
The mere specter of racism contin
ues to affect schools today.
Stereotypes, income inequali
ties, non-traditional families all
these conditions make it difficult for
minority students to succeed in
school. As a result, African-Ameri
cans score about 100 points lower
on both the SAT math and verbal
sections than whites, on average.
Among many such statistics, we
know that the probability of black
students attending a highly selec
tive college is lower than the proba
bility for whites, regardless of in
come. But more fundamentally
problematic than college underrep
resentation are the long-term ef
fects of the education gap.
Education is an exceptionally
strong indicator of mortality rates,
earnings and unemployment, with
post-secondary education being
most important factor in re-employ
ment. Though inequality begets in
equality, it does so through educa
tion, or the lack thereof.
But, it doesn't have to be this
way. There do exist compelling ad
justments we can implement to ful
fill King's dream and erase this gap.
Most importantly, we must change
the way we fund schools. Stanford
professor Rob Reich argues in The

New York Times that charity to
public schools only exacerbates in
equality.
If the financing solutions he ad
vocates materialize, significant im
provements in school quality can
have profound impacts on black stu
dents. But even if only marginal im
provements are achieved, disadvan
taged minorities could see substan
tial economic benefits. Moreover,
equitable funding would allow a
more ideal distribution of good
teachers, who predict academic suc
cess better than any school charac
teristic. Equal funding begets equal
education.
More achievable than a policy
change, however, is a simple attitu
dinal change. Teacher and adminis
trator attitude can make or break
reform efforts, according to one
study. Their opinions also help per
petuateâ€” or end the negative
intellectual stereotype faced by mi
nority students.
To that end, psychologists have
developed teaching approaches that
successfully neutralize those
stereotypes. Student climate is like
wise important, and though it may
seem antiquated, I firmly believe
we need to push for better integra
tion.
Even small changes in peer
group composition can expose new
ideas and encourage achievement.
It is this that is the most personal
for me. Moving from suburban Min
nesota to Stanford made me more
aware aware of the inequalities
about which I write and aware of
the drastic need for solutions.
The dream is not yet finished;
let's not stop now.
