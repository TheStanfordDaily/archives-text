## Breaking Bad, Legalize Drugs

Warning: spoiler alert!

Walter White's double life in
"Breaking Bad" is recount
ed as a sort of Jekyll and
Hyde story, acclaimed for forcing
its fans to "re-construct... the lines
between good and evil." However,
the show's theme of guilt forces to

the surface far deeper implications
for morality, rights and the role of
government, rising above any crude
distinctions between good and evil.
Following the meth-producing
duo, Walter White and Jesse
Pinkman, we see two very different
sets of values. Walt feels guilty for
breaking the law, compounded by
his wife and in-laws. Meanwhile,
Jesse is haunted by the terrible
things he has done to people to
maintain the duo's position in the
market. Their perspectives provide
a contrast that raises an interesting
question: Is it wrong to sell drugs?
It is a theme throughout the
show that Walt should and does feel
a responsibility for the fate of his
customers. In the third season, Walt
burns his drug money in a barbeque
after learning of a plane crash
caused by an air-traffic controller,
who had recently lost his daughter
to drug overdose. Among other inci
dents, this speaks to Walt's underly
ing feelings of guilt for choosing to
participate in the market.
On the surface, the obvious an
swer is that the drug trade is highly
immoral and so Walt's family is cor
rect that it is wrong to sell drugs.
The black market is certainly full of
human rights abuses homicide,
theft, threats and worse and it
tears apart families and communi
ties through violence and addiction.
But that description does not sepa
rate the transaction from the cir
cumstances in which they are made,
and that is a crucial distinction.
At the core, drug dealing is a
mutually beneficial exchange be
tween two consenting adults, which
does not violate anyone's rights. If
there were a question of whether or
not the exchange is mutually bene
ficial, one need only to consider that
the individuals involved the deal
er and the consumer wouldn't
participate in the exchange if they
didn't think it would benefit them.
Thus, there is no reason for this
sort of exchange to be illegal. It is a
personal choice to sell private prop
erty, and it is a personal choice to
get high. Most importantly, it is per
sonal responsibility to deal with the
consequences of those choices.
When a man high on bath salts
chewed off the face of a poor home
less man last summer, it wasn't the
bath salt producer's fault it was
the junkie's fault.
Ultimately, the responsibility of
any actions made while on high a drug
rests on the shoulders of the user him
self, who took that drug in full knowl
edge of the risks to his or her percep
tion and decision-making faculties.

There is nothing inherently im
moral about getting high, as it only
directly affects the junkie. What is
immoral is abuse of other individu
als. Though these abuses may be
encouraged by the drug flowing
through the bloodstream, responsi
bility for actions always falls upon
the shoulders of the offender.
Saying that a drug dealer is re
sponsible for the actions of his cus
tomers is the same thing as sug
gesting that Corona is responsible
for its customers' DUIs or that Be
nadryl manufacturers are responsi
ble for a student sleeping through
his 9 a.m. class.
Taking a step back, we can see
that it isn't the transaction in and of
itself which leads to abuse of human
rights or even sleeping in too late. If
an adult wants to spend his Friday
night boozed out, stoned, or tweak
ing on his couch, power to him.
It doesn't hurt anyone but per
haps his own health, and liberty is
the freedom to make bad choices as
well as good ones. The issue lies in
the way he allows his choices to af
fect others. If he spends all of his
money on drugs instead of feeding
his kids, that is child abuse. If he at
tacks a fast-food server because
McDonald's doesn't serve Mc-
Nuggets before 10:30 a.m., that is
assault.
Ultimately, these choices are
made by the individual, not the
drug dealer. As a drug dealer, Walt
has no responsibility for the conse
quences of his customers' choices.
Rather, he should take Jesse's view
that what their customers do with
their product is not their concern. It
should not be illegal to sell drugs; it
is not the role of government to help
people make good life choices but
rather to protect people's rights
from the self-interest of others.

There is nothing
inherently
immoral about
getting high
