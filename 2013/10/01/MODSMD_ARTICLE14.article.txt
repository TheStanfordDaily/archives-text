## CATCHING ON FLEENER, ERTZ HAVE BREAKOUT GAMES 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As a Stanford graduate, it should perhaps
come as no surprise that the Seattle Seahawks'
Richard Sherman 'lO likes to obsessively study
his opponents' tendencies prior to games.
With less than three minutes left in a road
game against the Houston Texans, Sherman's
diligence paid off in a big way as he intercept
ed Texans' quarterback Matt Schaub and re
turned the pick 58 yards for a touchdown (with
one shoe, no less), capping a 14-point Sea
hawks comeback in the fourth quarter. Seattle
would go on to win the game 23-20 in overtime
and keep its undefeated season alive.
"I had picked the same play against our
scout team on Friday. We knew it was coming.
... It's a high-risk, high-reward play," Sherman
said in his press conference following the
game. "You have to jump in, and you might get
beat over the top for a 20- or 30-yard gain if he
gets the ball down there. But if you make the
play, you might get a pick-six and change the
game for your team."
While Sherman's pick-six forced the game
into overtime, wide receiver Doug Baldwin 'lO
was involved in the decisive play of the over
time period. After catching a 7-yard pass from
quarterback Russell Wilson, Baldwin was lift
ed and then thrown to the ground by Texans
cornerback Kareem Jackson, resulting in a 15-
yard unnecessary roughness penalty. That
play put Seattle into field-goal range, eventual
ly leading to kicker Steven Haushcka's game
winning field goal. Baldwin finished with 39
yards receiving on three catches.

Sunday was also an encouraging day for
three up-and-coming former Stanford tight
ends.
Against Jacksonville, the Colts' Coby Fleen
er 'll caught five passes for 77 yards (both sea
son highs). Fleener also caught a 31-yard
touchdown pass from Colts' quarterback An
drew Luck 'll, who shook off a slow start to fin
ish 22-for-36 with two touchdowns and an inter
ception in a 37-3 blowout victory over the
Jaguars.
In a 52-20 loss to the Broncos, Philadelphia
Eagles rookie Zach Ertz 'l3 reeled in a 38-yard
reception, the longest of his young career, from
quarterback Michael Vick. Although he strugr

gled with an uncharacteristic number of drops
during the preseason, Ertz now seems to be
steadily establishing himself within Chip Kel
ly's offense.
Like his former partner in crime Ertz,
Levine Toilolo 'l3 of the Atlanta Falcons saw
more action on offense in Atlanta's 30-23 loss to
New England. Toilolo also registered his third
career reception as he looks to grab the torch
from future Hall of Fame tight end Tony Gonza
lez, who plans to retire at the end of the season.

Sunday was also a positive day for former
Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh who
bounced back after losing consecutive games
for the first time in his NFL coaching career to
lead his San Francisco 49ers to a dominant 35-
11 victory over the St. Louis Rams. Following a
bye this week, the 49ers will face another major
test when they host the Texans on Oct. 6.
