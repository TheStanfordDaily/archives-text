# ANALYZING THE DEEP PASS
## 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is well known for being a physical
running team, but despite a brutal downpour
that would cause most teams to favor a running
attack, No. 5 Stanford bucked the trend and
threw the ball all over the field last Saturday.
Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan was positively
surgical in his precision as the Cardinal demol

ished the Washington State Cougars 55-17. Cu
riously tied at 3-3 late in the first quarter
against one of the worst teams in last year's Pac
-12, Stanford broke the game open with a deep
strike to receiver Devon Cajuste, and it was all
Cardinal from there.
Washington State's aggressive defense had
shut Stanford down on the previous two plays,
and Stanford was facing
third-and-9 at its own 43-
yard line. Seeing a chance to
burn the Cougars for their
aggressiveness, Stanford
sought refuge in audacity
and attacked downfield.
In recent years, with the
growing popularity of
spread offenses reliant on
speed, pundits across the
country have lauded Stan
ford for its old-school power
running system. But con
trary to popular belief,
David Shaw prides himself
on his multiple-formation of
fense, and needing a big
gain, the Cardinal brought in
a standard spread set with
four wide receivers hard
ly old-school. Having spread
players across the field,
Stanford called one of the ar
chetypal spread offense
plays: three verticals.
Anticipating a pass play,
Washington State showed a
conservative two-safety

look. Even after the Cougars
blitzed five players, they still
had six defenders remaining
to deal with Stanford's four
deep threats a numbers
disadvantage that is the cor
nerstone of most criticisms
of the spread offense. Wash
ington State looked to have
the best of both worlds a
solid two-safety coverage
and the ability to play an ag
gressive man-to-man cover
age underneath.
But Stanford had a key
advantage: the positional
mismatches caused by its two
extra wide receivers. Specifi
cally, Washington State was
forced to line up slower line
backers (S and M) against
speedy receivers Michael
Rector (A) and Devon Ca
juste (H). Against Rector,
the Cougars compensated
by adding safety help ($), but
Cajuste was now one-on-one
against a slower player.
Here the spread helped
pave the way to victory: By
spreading the receivers and
stretching the field, Stan
ford opened up space to run.
Stanford's three deep verti
cal routes pinned Washing

ton State's cornerbacks to
the sidelines, clearing out
the middle of the field to let
Cajuste find the open space.
With three receivers to the
right of the quarterback,
Washington State's remain
ing safety (F/S) overcommit
ted to the right. Cajuste eas
ily outpaced his man, drifted
left and found daylight in the
middle of the field, and his
57-yard touchdown catch
gave Stanford a lead it would
hold for the rest of the game.
Stanford repeatedly
burned Washington State on
vertical routes on Saturday,
not just with Cajuste but
Michael Rector as well. By
forcing one-on-ones, Stan
ford's spread minimized
Washington State's margin
for error, and with positional
advantages in hand, the Car
dinal made Cougar errors al
most unavoidable. That's not
to say that the spread is the
perfect offense, but it has its
uses, and when your score is
that lopsided, you did some
thing right.

Cajuste find the open space.
With three receivers to the
right of the quarterback,
Washington State's remain
ing safety (F/S) overcommit
ted to the right. Cajuste eas
ily outpaced his man, drifted
left and found daylight in the
middle of the field, and his
57-yard touchdown catch
gave Stanford a lead it would
hold for the rest of the game.
Stanford repeatedly
burned Washington State on
vertical routes on Saturday,
not just with Cajuste but
Michael Rector as well. By
forcing one-on-ones, Stan
ford's spread minimized
Washington State's margin
for error, and with positional
advantages in hand, the Car
dinal made Cougar errors al
most unavoidable. That's not
to say that the spread is the
perfect offense, but it has its
uses, and when your score is
that lopsided, you did some
thing right.
