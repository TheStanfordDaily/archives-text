# Haden had to fire Kiffin to save Troy
## 
### Ashley Westhem 
As I was watching Stan
ford football destroy
Washington State Sat
urday night, I got a text
from my dad saying,
"Stanford rules, USC drools," fol
lowed by: "Goodbye Lane Kiffin."
Now, you need to know that my
dad has been going to USC games
since he was 8, the same age that I
was when he started taking me. I
swiftly turned against the Trojans,
however, the second they rejected my
application and I got into Stanford.
My dad has taken a little more time to
jump off the USC bandwagon, but I
knew from the moment I saw the text
that he had finally left the dark side
and decided to start cheering for the
light team.
My dad, and probably half of all
college football fans, was correct in
predicting that USC Athletic Director
Pat Haden had little reason to keep
Kiffin on as head coach for his fourth
season after losing to Arizona State
62-41 on Saturday evening. Haden
was justified in biting the bullet and
getting the job done almost the sec
ond Kiffin landed at LAX.
If the USC students' chants of
"Fire Kiffin" during their first home
loss to Washington State are any in
dication, no one can deny that Haden
made the popular choice. As a Cardi
nal fan though, I may have hoped
that Kiffin would stay on so that USC
could keep up its dismal decline.
I am fortunate that I was able to
be a USC fan during its heyday of Pe
te Carroll with Carson Palmer and
Matt Leinart, and that I now get to
experience the success of Stanford
football post-Andrew Luck. As a for
mer Trojan supporter, I am disgust
ed, though, by how the USC football
program was run under Kiffin. But
as a current Cardinal enthusiast, I
feel it's my duty to emphasize his
misdeeds and misconduct and
emphasize how he tarnished
the name of USC football.
I will say that Kiffin inher
ited a far-from-ideal situation
with the start of the "Reggie
Bush" sanctions. Even contin
uing into this year, USC only
had 56 healthy scholarship
players going into last week's
game.
Kiffin created a lot of his
own problems, however, with
his ego, illogical decision-mak
ing, immaturity and irrespon
sibility. It was Kiffin who
prompted the Pac-12 to pass
the regulation requiring host
teams to allow visiting teams
to walk through the stadium
the day before a game
something that Kiffin had not
allowed. It was Kiffin who
switched around jersey num
bers last season to try to con
fuse the other team. It was
during Kiffin's time that USC
was fined $25,000 when a team
manager was caught deflating
footballs prior to hosting Ore
gon last year. And it was Kiffin
who walked out of a press con
ference after less than a

minute because he doesn't like
to respond to questions related
to player injuries. Really
Lane?
What's more, he did all of
this while USC was already
under scrutiny and walking on
thin ice with the Pac-12 and
NCAA after the sanctions.
I think that player attitude
toward their coach is the best
indicator of a coach's perform
ance and Kiffin fails on that
front as well. During the ASU
game, at a time when USC was
actually playing well, the an
nouncer pointed out that after
a good play, Kiffin was hard
pressed to find a player who
would high-five him.
I actually had the pleasure
(displeasure?) of meeting Kif
fin a couple years ago, along
with his associate defensive co
ordinator Ed Oi'geron (now
USC's interim head coach). He
had no personality and no peo
ple skills. Orgeron, on the oth
er hand, displayed what a head
coach should be: approachable,
amiable and just happy to be
there with the fans. Kiffin
would be better off as a coordi
nator or position coach or pos
sibly even in the NFL since
there's more business rather
than emotion involved in pro
fessional sports.
Now the big question:

What is going to happen to
USC football? I'm sure Stan
ford fans would love to hear me
say that this is the end; they
aren't coming back any time
soon and Stanford will contin
ue to walk all over the Trojans
from now until eternity. But I
would be lying and going
against what I know about
USC football if I said anything
close to that.
USC football is still rele
vant and the Trojans will
bounce back quickly due to
their tradition of and commit
ment to excellence. Also, now
that Kiffin is gone, USC can
hope to again become a hotbed
of recruiting.
But as last week's scores in
the Pac-12 indicate, USC will
have a tough end to the 2013
season considering the
strength in the conference.
For now, Cardinal fans can
be happy that Lane Kiffin was
never able to take a game from
Stanford and can look forward
to beating the Trojans at the
Coliseum next month.

Ashley Westhem still occa
sionally sounds like the USC
fan she once was. To talk to
Ashley about her "commit
ment to excellence" in col
