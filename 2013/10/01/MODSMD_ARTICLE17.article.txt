28 consecutive games in which the Cardinal has forced a
turnover.
Stanford's propensity for pressuring opponents into making mistakes continued on Sat
urday, as the Card returned two interceptions for touchdowns during a dominant third
quarter against Washington State.

receptions covering at least 30 yards by Cardinal wide re
ceivers on Saturday.
While Stanford's offensive identity has been defined thus far by wearing down opponents
through a physical offensive line and a strong running game, the Cardinal deep attack took
flight against the Cougars. Quarterback Kevin Hogan threw three long touchdown passes,
with Devon Cajuste hauling in 57- and 33-yard touchdown receptions, and Michael Rec
tor burning the defense for a 45-yard score.

straight wins to begin Kevin Hogan's career as Stanford's
starting quarterback.
The junior from McLean, Va., has helped lead the Cardinal on one of its finest stretches
in school history, with five victories against ranked opponents and Stanford's first Rose
Bowl title in more than 40 years.
