## Tigers get revenge in rematch 
### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a 9-8 overtime win
against No. 5 Pacific on Sept.
21 at the NorCal Invitational,
No. 3 Stanford faced the
Tigers once again this Sun
day, where they were not able
to secure a second victory.
Despite a late drive led pri
marily by sophomore driver
Bret Bonanni and fifth-year
senior two-meter Forrest
Watkins, the Cardinal was de
feated 14-12 in the match.
The Card maintained
pressure on the Tiger de
fense throughout the game,
eliciting 14 saves from goalie
Alex Malkis. Hat tricks from
Pacific powerhouses Balazs
Erdelyi, Goran Tomasevic
and Kevin Oliveira, however,
put the Tigers ahead to stay.
The game opened with
three goals in the first 1:34 of
play two of which were for
the Cardinal. Bonanni started
the Cardinal off strong with a
goal 56 seconds in, which was
quickly followed by a goal 25
seconds later from Oliveira.

Bonanni scored his second of
four goals 13 seconds after
Pacific's equalizer, putting the
Cardinal ahead 2-1.

Scoring slowed for Stan
ford shortly after, however,
with the Tigers outscoring
Stanford 6-0 over the next 10
minutes of play.
A timeout in the middle of
the second quarter got the
Cardinal fired up, battling
back with two goals from
Bonnani and one from
Watkins beginning his five
goal surge before the half.
Trailing 8-5 at halftime,
Stanford focused on coming
out hot in the second half —
and the Cardinal did. The
Tigers flexed them muscle as
well though, and the third pe
riod exploded open with sev
en goals three for Stanford
and four for Pacific in the
first 3:49 of the new half.
The end of the third quar

ter was Cardinal-dominated
more specifically Watkins
dominated —as the senior
scored three consecutive
goals, drawing the game to a
nail-biter of 12-11 with 7:54
left to play.
Just under four and a half
minutes into the final period,
Pacific's Aleksandar Petrovic
netted his second goal to so
lidify the Tiger's lead. Capi
talizing on a late penalty shot
by Erdelyi reopened Pacif
ic's lead to three goals a
gap Stanford never closed,
despite a late surge and goal
by junior Alex Bowen with
six seconds left in the game.
After starting the season
with nine road games, Stan
ford will look to reestablish
dominance at its home open
er on Saturday, Oct. 5
against No. 15 Santa Clara.
Stanford faced Santa Clara
in its home opener last year
as well, beating the Broncos
decidedly by a score of 19-1.
