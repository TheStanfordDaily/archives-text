## Summer alcohol ban lifted 
### BAKER TILNEY DESK EDITOR 
Students responded positively to
the summer 2013 reversal of the hard
alcohol ban implemented in summer
2012. The campus instead implement
ed the normal year-round Stanford
University Student Alcohol Policy.
The University decided to return
to the regular-year alcohol policy after
administrators received negative
feedback from the community about
2012's pilot ban. The pilot policy had
mandated that beverages with an alco
holic content above 20 percent would
not be allowed in any dorms, even in
the possession of students over the le
gal drinking age of 21.
One student, who spent both of the
last two summers on campus, praised
the lifting of the ban.
"I thought the ban last summer
was silly, because students still drank
all kinds of alcohol. This year, it was
much more open and actually felt
safer," said the junior, who chose to re
main anonymous.
A primary justification for the ban
was that Stanford hosts many stu
dents and athletes many still at
tending high school not otherwise
affiliated with the University.
Another student present on cam
pus in summer 2012 acknowledged the
administrative goal but found the ban
to produce a negative effect.
"I respect the University frying to
enforce a stricter alcohol policy during
the summer to have a safer and
healthier environment around the
summer camps. However, the policy
was difficult to enforce and many ig
nored it," said the student, who also
chose to remain anonymous.
That student also felt that the ban
caused trust issues between residents
and RAs, a strong contrast to the usu
al open relationships between the two
roles.
"A school that trusts students dur
ing the academic year with an honor
code and an open-door policy should
extend that trust throughout the sum
mer," he added.
In a previous Daily interview,
Ralph Castro, director of the Office of
Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE),
agreed that consistency throughout
the year is important.
Jarreau Bowen, assistant director
of OAPE, explained that the fact that
so many of Stanford's summer resi
dents are not actual Stanford students
means that OAPE has limited say in
the summer alcohol policy, but the of
fice did not know of any major alcohol
issues over the summer and does not
plan to reimplement the ban in future
summers.
Assistant Dean and Director of
Summer Session Jess Matthews was
unavailable for comment.
