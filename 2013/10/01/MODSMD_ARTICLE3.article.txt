# Ujamaa garden provides food for local nonprofit
## Student-run project garners administrative, peer support in its second year as a response to the food justice movement 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Brenda Mutuma 'l3 was attempting
to galvanize support last winter for the installa
tion of a new student-run garden, she sent out
an email to various campus organizations. Her
message began with the statement: "If you
haven't heard already, Ujamaa House is about
to have a baby."
And that's how Mutuma prefers to think
about the Ujamaa Community Garden, which

was installed by Stanford students last spring
and has since provided more than 100 pounds of
fresh produce to Stanford and East Palo Alto
community members. It's a baby that needs the
loving care of its parents.
Mutuma defines the word "parents" broadly.
She said the term does not just refer to her
self and Makshya Tolbert 'l5, the co-founders
who dreamed up the idea to transform an un
used area near Ujamaa into a student-run gar-

Brenda Mutuma '13 and Makshya Tolbert '15 started the Ujamaa Community Garden
project last year to participate in solving issues of food justice. In its first harvest the
garden produced more than 100 pounds of food.
den. And it doesn't just encompass
Ujamaa residents, who have come
to take primary responsibility for
the space.
Instead, Mutuma sees each
Stanford student as one of the gar
den's parents.
"I wrote this humongously long
email last year to a lot of organiza
tions, talking about the vision for
the space, and I said this is not just
going to be any ordinary garden,"
Mutuma said. "This is going to be
our garden, and whatever ideas
that you have let's go."
Since students finished in
stalling the seven-bed garden last
March, those ideas have included
an art day to create decorations for
the space, cooking and nutrition
workshops with dining hall chefs,
garden tours for high school stu
dents and food donations to both
the Stanford Farm Project and lo
cal nonprofit Collective Roots.
Jan Barker-Alexander, director
of the Black Community Services
Center (BCSC), was so impressed
with the garden's impact last year
that she named its co-founders
winners of her Director's Award in
the spring.
"They were able to have an im
pact not in a super superficial 'Oh,
it's cute' sense, but in away that
had depth and intellectual sub
stance, which permeated through
out the entire community," Barker-
Alexander said.
This year, the Ujamaa Com
muntiy Garden, like any baby, is
beginning to show signs of growth.

A new partnership with Collective
Roots means the garden's food will
provide fresh produce to East Palo
Alto residences on a monthly (or
perhaps, even biweekly) basis. To
help institutionalize the space,
Ujamaa's peer health educator
(PHE) will now be responsible for
leading a team that tends to the
garden.
Joining the food justice move
ment
It was a phone conversation
during winter break last year that
provided the metaphorical seed for
the project. Mutuma called Tolbert
after the two had been classmates
in the fall quarter class Food and
Community.
The fall course inspired them to
think more about food justice, a
movement that seeks to eliminate
disparities and inequalities in the
current food system.
"It's the idea that certain com
munities who should be entitled to
the same food as everybody else,
but don't have access to it," Tolbert
said.
The food justice movement is
particularly applicable in Stan
ford's backyard.
In East Palo Alto, the nonprofit
Collective Roots is focused on
making sure individuals have equal
access to healthy, affordable and
environmentally sustainable food.
According to Nicole Wires,
manager of community initiatives
for Collective Roots, there wasn't a
full-scale grocery store in East Pa
lo Alto until two and a half years
ago, when Mi Pueblo Food Center
opened in the Ravenswood Shop
ping Center.
But even that grocery store
might not remain open for long, ac

cording to Wires.
"Mi Pueblo has just filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy, so it's un
clear if it will continue to be a store
for much longer or how they will
manage that bankruptcy," Wires
said.
The lack of grocery stores in
East Palo Alto make it difficult for
residents to purchase fresh pro
duce, and even when fresh produce
is readily available, the prices are
too high, Wires said.
"As a result, there had been
less access to healthy foods, and
that's reflected in many ways in
some of the health disparities in
the community," she added.
Wires cited the fact that East
Palo Alto residents have some of
the highest rates of hypertension,
diabetes and obesity in the Penin
sula area. All three of these non
communicable diseases are linked
to diet.
Wires said none of these figures
should be interpreted outside of
the social and economic contexts,
which are what the food justice
movement is interested in examin
ing.
It was learning about these dis
parities in the food system, espe
cially in communities of color, that
inspired Mutuma to pick up the
phone and call Tolbert.
Tolbert immediately jumped on
board with the plan. The rest of
their winter break was spent re
searching what would be needed to
bring Mutuma's idea to life and
then creating a detailed budget for
the proposed garden.
By the time Mutuma and Tol
bert arrived back on the Farm,
they were ready to start pitching
their idea to University administra
tors.

'A recognition that this is ours'
Barker-Alexander, who became
one of the strongest advocates for
the garden project, admitted that
in the beginning, she had reserva
tions.
"I talked with them about what
this meant in terms of commitment
of other students who didn't come
up with the idea," Barker-Alexan
der said. "I wanted to help them
think critically about all the moving
parts, and the intellectual frame
work around food justice, and how
to incorporate that into everything
that's done."
Realizing that Mutuma and Tol
bert wanted the garden to be sus
tainable and outlive their own Stan
ford careers, Barker-Alexander
started helping them get in contact
with other departments at the Uni
versityâ€” most notably, Residen
tial & Dining Enterprises (R&DE).
Rodger Whitney, executive di
rector of R&DE Student Housing,
recalled in an emailed statement
that the students brought forward
a plan and thought-out budget dur
ing their first meeting in January.
R&DE Student Housing has
previously supported community
gardens at some of the Row houses
and at Escondido Village. The Uja
maa garden, however, would be the
first one to be student-run in a
large undergraduate residence,
Whitney said.
After agreeing to move forward
with Mutuma and Tolbert's propos
al, R&DE said staff would be will
ing to install the garden for them.
Instead, Mutuma opted for stu
dents to construct the garden
themselves.
"Here is where I did question
them," Barker-Alexander said. "I
said, 'Brenda, do you really think

Stanford students are going to
wake up on a Saturday, and ham
mer nails?' She had so much confi
dence, but I've been around the
block a while. Guess what? She was
right."
Football players, band mem
bers, Ujamaa residents and whole
fraternities and sororities turned
out on March 1 and 2 to install the
garden.
R&DE did help by clearing out
existing mulch, having carpentry
staff members provide training to
student volunteers, loaning tools
and installing gravel for walkways
between the planter beds.
Mutuma said having students
install the garden set the tone for
the space moving forward.
"It was a recognition that this is
ours," Mutuma said. "We are creat
ing a community of our own."
According to Wires, Collective
Roots has given the food to East
Palo Alto residents at its cooking
and nutrition workshops, which are
held at schools, community health
clinics, a drug and alcohol rehab
center, a senior center and a public
housing center.
"This year, I think we are try
ing to maintain [our donations], but
on a more frequent scale," possibly
even weekly basis, Tolbert said.
Another big goal, Tolbert said,
is using the space to increase edu
cation about the food justice mo
ment.
"I think that food is one of
beautiful things that can bring peo
ple together," Mutuma said. "And
why not do that from the ground up
getting people as involved as
possible in the food process?"
