## Alumni finds balance in love and work Creative project Lexigrams promotes visual learning 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
When Veronika Heckova 'O7 moved into
her room in the four-class dorm Okada in
2003, she never expected that the person
living next door, Albert Wu 'O4, would one
day become her life and business partner.
Heckova and her husband Wu now work
full time in developing and marketing Lexi
grams, a visual learning tool geared toward
making English words easier to memorize
through illustrated cards.
"We worked together in going through

Heckova said. "It was one of the first cre

Dan Tran 'O6, Wu's roommate his senior
year, recalled Heckova's interest in vocabu

"She really likes words and she was just
doing a bunch of these illustrative lexi
grams," Tran said.
Despite their initial success among
peers, Heckova and Wu did not continue
pursuing the idea until two and a half years
ago when Bulgarian blogger Maria Popova
found out about the project online and
wrote a post on it when the product name
was still Word-Without-Word.
