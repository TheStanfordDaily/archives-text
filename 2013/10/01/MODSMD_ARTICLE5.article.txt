## Alumni finds balance in love and work Creative project Lexigrams promotes visual learning 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
When Veronika Heckova 'O7 moved into
her room in the four-class dorm Okada in
2003, she never expected that the person
living next door, Albert Wu 'O4, would one
day become her life and business partner.
Heckova and her husband Wu now work
full time in developing and marketing Lexi
grams, a visual learning tool geared toward
making English words easier to memorize
through illustrated cards.
"We worked together in going through
the entire process of making [Lexigrams] a
physical thing," Heckova said. "[Wu] has
just been an incredible partner throughout
the whole process."
Moving from Slovakia to New Zealand
at the age of 7, Heckova has always had a
fondness for drawing. The idea of designing
Lexigrams first struck her while preparing
for the GRE.
"I am a visual learner and I want to cre
ate something for other visual learners,"
Heckova said. "At first they were just little
doodles, little illustrations. Later I showed
them to my friends, and they were like,
'This is really cool.'"
With the encouragement and support of
Wu and her friends, Heckova started work
ing on 20 illustrations in a style that was
very different from what it is now, and
named the project Word-Without-Word.
"Albert saw them and said, 'This is real
ly awesome and you should work on them
and make them into little illustrations,"'
Heckova said. "It was one of the first cre
ative projects we worked on [together]."
Dan Tran 'O6, Wu's roommate his senior
year, recalled Heckova's interest in vocabu
lary from their days on campus.
"She really likes words and she was just
doing a bunch of these illustrative lexi
grams," Tran said.
Despite their initial success among
peers, Heckova and Wu did not continue
pursuing the idea until two and a half years
ago when Bulgarian blogger Maria Popova
found out about the project online and
wrote a post on it when the product name
was still Word-Without-Word.
"I decided... that I was going to work on
this full time," Heckova said. "That's what
you see today, this full-on evolution of the
project, 100 illustrations."
While working on a business project with
one's life partner can sound romantic, some
times it can also make it difficult to define
the boundary between work and life.
"For our living room, we don't have a TV
we just have two desks next to each oth
er," Heckova said.
"Whatever conflict you have, it's not just
our work conflict, it's our whole life conflict,"
she added.
Nevertheless, Heckova was confident
that she and Wu could handle both their per
sonal lives and work.
"Whatever difficulty we had, it's all offset
by the fact that we are extremely honest
with each other," she said. "Sometimes in a
work situation, maybe you can't be as honest
and are trying to be a little political to pre
vent getting people mad."
Currently the couple is working on tar
geting a wider audience, not only vocabulary
learners. Among the customers are students
studying for the GRE and SAT as well as
people who love learning English or the arts.
Tran, who has bought four sets of Lexi
grams, found the product suitable for not on
ly exam preparations, but also for becoming
a better communicator.
Heckova and Wu are polishing the prod

uct by soliciting feedback from existing cus
tomers.
"One big feedback we receive right now is
that people want to have a pronunciation of
the words on the Web page," Heckova said.
"I think for people who are using it for
studying as opposed to enjoying it in their
own time, they would also like to see it as a

mobile app."
For couples interested in starting a busi
ness together, Heckova offered her advice.
"Start a small project and see how it goes
and whether you enjoy it," she said.
