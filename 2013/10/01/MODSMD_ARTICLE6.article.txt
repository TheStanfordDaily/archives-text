## Sophomore earns Silicon Valley respect Catalin Voss '16 founds Sension, a visual interface startup company 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Balancing homework, a social life and ex
tracurricular is one challenge, but for
StartX Innovator in Residence Catalin Voss
'l6 those things just scrape the surface.
This year Voss founded his first startup,
Sension, a visual interface company that aims
to make human experiences with computers
more interactive. Most of Sension's founding
staff includes Stanford students.
After having a mixed experience with a
class using the flipped class model, Voss and
Jonathan Yan 'l6, product and distribution
manager of Sension, decided to address the
root of the problem the human-technology
interaction.
Sension is developing computer vision
technology to use webcams to evaluate users'
facial expressions.
"I don't know about you, but if I have to
watch a 20-minute video sitting at home in
my underwear I'm just going to fall asleep,"
Voss said. "If the computer senses that you're
falling asleep or you're not paying attention,
it'll ask you a question and depending on how
you answer the question, it'll skip around or
re-explain a concept that you missed and
adapt to your learner type."
There are many other applications of the
face-tracking technology autism, for exam
ple.
"With Google Glass, we were able to port
our code into that device to recognize emotion
in real time so [a] kid with autism can come up
to you and interact with you appropriately,"
Yan explained.
Despite his young age, Voss has experience
working with prominent people in Silicon Val
ley, including Steve Capps, one of the original
developers of Apple's Finder application.
However, working in Silicon Valley before hit
ting 20 proves a challenge for him at times.
"You got to prove yourself in a different
way," Voss said. "But this is a place where peo
ple are much more open to that than anywhere
else in the world."
"You're measured by what you create. If
people like what you're doing, and whether
you're 15 or whatever, it doesn't really mat
ter," he added.
Yan, on the other hand, considers Voss ma
ture beyond his years, especially given his
dedication to the company.
"If you ask any other employee, one of the
top reasons they joined is because [Voss] is

there," Yan said. "He really inspires that trust
and belief as a CEO, even so young. We have
Ph.D.s working for us and they respect him."
Although Voss balances being an Innovator
in Residence at StartX and being a full-time
student, he said he was getting more sleep
than he had in high school.
Outside of his academics and business com
mitments, he enjoys music, playing the piano
and guitar and D Jing.

"Ninety-nine percent of the time I spend
with him is work, but with that work comes
fun," Yan said. "We hang out and definitely
have a good rapport outside of Sension. What
we really share is a vision and a lot of peo
ple say they have it but they don't do anything
about it. Catalin does."
