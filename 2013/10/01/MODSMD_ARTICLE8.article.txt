## ASSU offering new grants for student groups 
### â€“ Catherine Zaw 
The Undergraduate Senate Appropria
tions Committee is offering grants to student
groups hosting new winter quarter events.
Similar to the winter quarter grant from
last year, general student fee groups can po
tentially apply for up to $50,000 for new
events.
"We're targeting specifically for the winter
quarter because a lot of groups do activities
already for the fall and the same for the
spring," said Angela Zhang 'l6, a senator on
the Appropriations Committee. "We just
want to have something new and exciting for
the winter." For events that have been held
previously, the Senate is piloting an event
bonus program that will grant up to $3,000 to
improve attendance at group events.
Additionally, the Senate proposed last
Tuesday to create a $20,000 Class Presidents
Grant, which will allow the class presidents
to apply for additional funding for class and
all-campus events. This bill will be discussed
in today's Senate meeting.
