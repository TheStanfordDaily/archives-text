### Ivan Sag â€“ Catherine Zaw 
Ivan Sag, professor of linguistics and
symbolic systems, died at age 63 earlier this
month after a long battle with cancer.

A world-renowned re
searcher who made no
table contributions to the
fields of syntax, seman
tics, pragmatics and lan
guage processing, Sag
was an active member of
the Linguistics Society of
America for more than 30
years and authored or co-

authored 10 books in linguistics.
He co-founded Stanford's Center for the
Study of Language and Information in 1983
and helped create the Symbolic Systems
Program at Stanford, later serving as its di
rector for five years.
Aside from his academic work, Sag will be
remembered by the Stanford community as
the founder and leader of Dead Tongues, the
unofficial rock 'n' roll band of the Linguistics
Department.
Sag was a professor and mentor for many,
often inviting students to his home, and he
received a Dean's Award for teaching in
1982.
In April 2013, many of Sag's former stu
dents came to attend the three-day "Ivan
Fest," a conference held in honor of the 40th
anniversary of Sag's professional work.
Sag is survived by his wife, Penelope Eck
ert, a professor of linguistics at Stanford.
