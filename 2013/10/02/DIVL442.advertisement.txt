Free and open to the public
The United States is in the midst of a sea change in drug policy.
After forty years and $1 trillion in taxpayer money, the War on Drugs
is widely recognized as a failure. While having a negligible impact
on supply and demand, America's longest war has enriched criminal
cartels south of the border and resulted in the world's largest prison
population of 2.1 million.
More than 100 million Americans have used cannabis, including the
last three presidents. This easy-to-grow herb is the largest cash crop
in the US, out-earning corn and wheat combined.
Today, 55% of Americans favor full legalization of
adult social use of cannabis, and nearly 80 percent
support medical cannabis. Clearly, change is in the air.
But what comes next?
After the drug war, what will the "drug peace" look like?
Does post-alcohol Prohibition history provide a model?
Doug Fine, author of Too High to Fail: Cannabis and the New Green
Economic Revolution, will tackle these questions with eye-opening
slides, humorous storytelling, and evidence gathered during his
in-the-field investigative journalism.
