### â€” Alexa Liautaud 
The National Institutes of
Health awarded over $l7 million to
eight Stanford scientists on Sunday.
The grant will enable the recipients to
pursue major, groundbreaking proj
ects in the field of biomedicine that
might otherwise be too unconvention
al for mainstream funding, which gen
erally requires more certainty.

The awards are divided into cat
egories: the Pioneer Award, of
which one was given to a Stanford
faculty member; the Innovator
Award, of which three were given;
the Transformative Research
Award, of which four were given;
and the Early Independence
Award, the only grant not awarded
to a Stanford faculty member.
The recipients were Michael
Lin, Catherine Blish, Maximilian

Diehn MD 'Ol Ph.D. 'O4 MF 'O6,
Elizabeth Sattely, Thomas Rando,
David Relman and Susan Holmes.
Some of the research that was
recognized included a fluorescent
light-inducible protein (FLIP)
switch that controls the activity of a
protein using light, a study of the
positive effect of physical activity
on the brain's functioning capabili
ties and an investigation of the mi
crobiology of certain vegetables to
explain why they are beneficial to
human health.
The Stanford researchers are
among 78 National Institutes of
Health grantees, who were award
ed a total of approximately $123
million for their initiatives.
