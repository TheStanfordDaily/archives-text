# SPORTS
## To the woman who inspired me 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
This weekend, for the first
time in over five years, I
did not watch a single
minute of live sports. Oh
sure, I caught the high
lights of the Stanford game and read
about how the Patriots out-dueled the
Falcons in the Georgia Dome.
But I didn't watch. I really
couldn't.

I've been a sports nut since the
ripe old age of 8. Never having really
been an athlete, I contented myself
with watching the pros in action. I
made a living eating the tasty orange
slices that the bench players were
supposed to guard at youth soccer
games. Quite simply, it felt like the
athlete gene was missing in me. I
thought so, my dad thought so, my
brother thought so. Most damningly,
my coaches thought so too.
My mom never thought so; she
was always the one telling me that
anything was possible if I set my
mind to it. To her, the biggest failure
was giving up without a fight. Though
she barely watches any sports, sports
and my mother are irrevocably joined
at the hip in my mind. My love of one
(my mother) begets my love of the
other. But while I can live without
one, there is absolutely no way of liv
ing without the other.
My mother suffered a stroke last
Thesday as she was talking on the
phone with my brother. Under the
grimmest of circumstances, she self
diagnosed her condition and was at
the hospital within thirty minutes
with my father by her side and myself
and my brother fully aware of what
was going on. She underwent brain
surgery the next day and is thankful
ly out of danger. However, the left
side of her body has been paralyzed.
To those who know her, my moth
er is a ray of sunlight in a cloudy
world. Exceedingly kind, capable of
nearly infinite love, loyal to a fault,
brutally honest and ever smiling, the
golden person underneath would be
apparent to anyone merely laying
eyes on her. Mere words do not do her
justice, but they will have to do.
The scaliest part of this whole af
fair is its suddenness my mom was
the paragon of good health. After
having sprinted in high school, she
has kept herself fit and active in away
that astounds me to this veiy day.
Even now, as she fights to get herself
back to the way she was, she does so
with a cheeiy outlook and a resilience
that leaves me in tears.

I said earlier that my love of
sports stemmed from my mother.
Football has always been my favorite
sport, even though I am generally
atrocious at it. I only stalled playing
in high school, and the lack of experi
ence (among other things) showed,
with some of those other things, in
cluding a lack of height (5-foot-3 when
I started ninth grade), a lack of
weight (115 pounds) and a lack of vi
ciousness (I would rather run away
than try to make a tackle). Though I
was determined to stick it out and get
better, I would be lying if I said that I
had any faith in myself. How, I won
dered, could I ever try to compete?
Naturally, it was my mom who
picked me up when I needed it most.
Her words to me were as simple as
they were powerful: "Hard work will
always yield results." She has always
believed that it doesn't matter what
gifts you are born with; the only gifts
you are measured by are what you
earn and show. No words have ever
been more empowering.
One of the favorite quotes my
mom and I share is from the movie
"Chicken Run," where protagonist
Rocky Road proclaims: "You see, fly
ing takes three things: hard work,
perseverance and ...hard work." A
naysayer guffaws, "You said 'hard
work' twice!" To which Rocky replies,
"That's because it takes twice as
much work as perseverance." The
movie might have said it, but it is my
mom who lived it and made me live it
too.

There is much power in sports;
few other spectacles bring so many
people together and bind them with
strings as taut as steel hawsers. They
balance incredible joy with incredible
sadness, sandwiched around themes
of brotherhood, camaraderie and ath
letic perfection. They have, one way
or another, impacted my life and my
pursuits over the last 12 years.

Events like those of last week
tend to put everything in perspective.
For once, my overriding fear was not
related to an external entity I had
somehow chosen to support; it was
my mother, her health and her well
being. Everything else becomes irrel
evant in that instant. There are a ton
of things in the world bigger than
sports, and for one week I'm using
these words and paragraphs to talk
about those things instead.
The doctors said that over time,
with aggressive rehab and a little
luck, my mom would slowly regain
control of her body. Last Friday she
came off life support, over the week
end she began talking and eating on
her own and, just yesterday, she
managed to twitch her (supposedly
paralyzed) left leg a few inches. I

have no doubt at all in my mind that
she will continue to recover, progress
and fight her way back with hard
work, perseverance and hard work.
And my brother, my father, the rest
of my family and I will be there
every step of the way, cheering her
on.

It's funny how things come full
circle that way. When I was down, it
was my mom who picked me up and
set me down straight. Now, it is my
job to return the favor. Much love to
all, and God bless.
