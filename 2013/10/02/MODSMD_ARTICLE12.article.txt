# HUSKIES ON DECK
## SHAW, PLAYERS FOCUS AMID SANDERS HYPE 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In their weekly Tuesday press conference,
Stanford head coach David Shaw and several
players fielded a wide array of questions from
the media, ranging from this Saturday's
matchup against Washington to the media fren
zy surrounding sophomore running back Barry
Sanders and even to Shaw's own playing days
on the Farm.

When discussing the Cardinal's upcoming
game against Washington, Shaw praised head
coach Steve Sarkisian's work in rebuilding the
program and predicted that Saturday's
matchup "will be a battle." Shaw also lauded
Huskies quarterback Keith Price.
"He looks like a healthy quarterback, like he
did two years ago... He looks like a quarterback
that has a healthy offensive line in front of him,"
Shaw said. "He's playing with a lot of confi
dence. He's playing like that guy that burst on
the scene two years ago when everybody in the
conference took notice of him."

A few minutes later, the conversation shifted
to Shaw's time as a Stanford wide receiver in

the early 1990s â€”an era when the Huskies
were one of the most dominant programs in col
lege football.

When asked to recall his memories of play
ing against UW in the early 19905, Shaw
lamented that those recollections "took him
back to a dark place." Shaw went on to add that
Washington was "the best defense I had seen in
my entire life until I was with the Oakland
Raiders [as an assistant coach] and we played
the Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens."
"I still remember those guys' names," Shaw
said." "Those images were burned in my
brain."

While Shaw took some time to reminisce
about the strength of the Huskies' front seven
in the 19905, he also provided important injury
updates concerning his own defensive unit.
According to Shaw, senior defensive end
Henry Anderson's recovery from a leg injury is
progressing on schedule. He added that Ander
son plans to be off crutches by this week and
hopes to return in three to four weeks. Shaw al
so added that sophomore linebacker Blake
Martinez is progressing on schedule in his re
covery from an undisclosed injury suffered in
practice.

Without a doubt, the most popular topic dur
ing the press conference was the media atten
tion directed towards Sanders following his two
big plays against Washington State on Satur

day. Shaw noted that, if it were not for his name,
Sanders would not be getting anywhere near
the same level of attention, stating "there's no
way that he would have been the only two clips
shown [of the game] on Sports Center."
In addition, Shaw also downplayed any notion
that the media eruption in the wake of Sanders'
play would distract the team in any way.
"I don't have a problem with it," he said. "We
knew it was coming. We talked about it the day
after signing day... Me and the coaching staff
we're already prepared for it. We knew it
was going to happen."

In response to a similar question, sophomore
cornerback Alex Carter added: "It's not Bar
ry's fault, it's nothing he can d 0... We're all hap
py for Barry. We love him. I was excited when
he made his touchdown."

Carter went on to state that he was not sur
prised at all by Sanders' ankle-breaking moves
against Washington State. "That's what Barry
does. He makes people miss and it looks bad on
TV... He did it to me many times last year in
camp. It was fun."

The Cardinal will focus on more than
Sanders as a media darling as Stanford pre
pares to take on Washington. The Cardinal
faces the Huskies on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in
Stanford Stadium.
