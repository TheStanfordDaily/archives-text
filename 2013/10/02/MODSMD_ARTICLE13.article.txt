## Card rolls into tough road trip Big foes loom as title hopes at stake 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
After shutting out then-No. 16
Arizona State at Maples Pavilion on
Friday night, the Stanford women's
volleyball team heads into perhaps
its most difficult road trip of the sea
son on a high note riding a seven
game winning streak.
The No. 7 Cardinal (9-2, 2-0 Pac
-12) left the Farm yesterday for
matches against the No. 16 UCLA
Bruins (9-3, 0-2) tonight and to take
on the No. 2 USC Trojans (12-1,2-0)
on Friday.
Last season, Stanford took both
games from the Bruins, winning at
Maples in a five-set thriller before
beating them to clinch the Pac-12 ti
tle in four sets in the Bruins' first
game at the new Pauley Pavilion.
The Bruins will be hungry to beat
Stanford for the first time on the
new court.
The Bruins are averaging a .271
hitting percentage, good for sixth in
the conference. One of the three
players to keep an eye on is junior
outside hitter Karsta Lowe, who
ranks fifth in the Pac-12 and leads
the team in kills with 4.04 per set
while hitting .350. Senior middle
blocker Mariana Aquino leads the
Bruins in blocks with 1.13 per set
and is sixth in the conference with a
.415 attack percentage. Finally, sen
ior outside hitter Kelly Reeves has
been recording 2.78 kills and 2.96
digs per set.
However, the team that will give
the Card the greatest challenge in
winning a repeat conference title
(besides No. 1 Washington) is USC.
The Trojans dealt Stanford its only
Pac-12 loss last season at the Galen
Center in a four-set match. How
ever, the Card had already protect
ed its home court and ended up
splitting the series with USC. Both
teams are not only aiming for the
Pac-12 crown but also for the illus
trious NCAA title this year.
The Trojans' only loss of this
season came from then-No. 9 San
Diego at the beginning of Septem
ber. Stanford's only two losses were
also against ranked opponents
No. 3 Florida and No. 4 Texas.

The Trojans are hitting .285 and
are second best in the Pac-12 with
1.53 aces per set. Sophomore out
side hitter Samantha Bricio aver
ages 3.20 kills per set and is the rea
son behind USC's high number of
aces, recording .730 per set herself.
Senior middle blocker Alexis 01-
gard has the fourth-highest hitting
percentage in the conference at
.418 and is ninth in the Pac-12 with
1.16 blocks per set. Senior libero
Natalie Hagglund controls the
Trojan defense with 4.69 digs per
set, good for second in the Pac-12
conference.

"We are preparing for our side
of the net," said senior outside hit
ter Rachel Williams. "Stopping
what we can stop and controlling
what we can control."

Stanford has been experiencing
leadership and strong contribu
tions from all of its starters across
the board. Sophomore setter Madi
Bugg has been the facilitator of the
offense, allowing all of her team
mates to get a piece of the ball. She
ranks second in the Pac-12 and
10th in the nation with 11.62 as
sists per set.

Williams leads the team in dou
ble-doubles with five, of which three
were earned consecutively. She also
leads the team in kills per set at
3.11, tied with fellow senior Carly
Wopat. Wopat is also a threat at the
net in terms of blocking, ranking
third in school history with her 1.37
blocks per set average.
With great leadership from its
seniors and tremendous support
from its sophomore class, the Card
is expected to compete at the high
est level in Los Angeles starting

tonight at Pauley Pavilion and con
tinuing Friday night at the Galen
Center.

"Neither [USC nor UCLA] are
easy places to play," Williams said.

"Their fans and students are loud
so if we can just take the time to

play our game and not play theirs,
[we'll be successful], so just con
trolling the ball and shutting them
down [is important]."
