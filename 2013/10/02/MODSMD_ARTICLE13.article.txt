## Card rolls into tough road trip Big foes loom as title hopes at stake 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
After shutting out then-No. 16
Arizona State at Maples Pavilion on
Friday night, the Stanford women's
volleyball team heads into perhaps
its most difficult road trip of the sea
son on a high note riding a seven
game winning streak.
The No. 7 Cardinal (9-2, 2-0 Pac
-12) left the Farm yesterday for
matches against the No. 16 UCLA
Bruins (9-3, 0-2) tonight and to take
on the No. 2 USC Trojans (12-1,2-0)
on Friday.
Last season, Stanford took both
games from the Bruins, winning at
Maples in a five-set thriller before
beating them to clinch the Pac-12 ti
tle in four sets in the Bruins' first
game at the new Pauley Pavilion.
The Bruins will be hungry to beat
Stanford for the first time on the
new court.
The Bruins are averaging a .271
hitting percentage, good for sixth in
the conference. One of the three
players to keep an eye on is junior
outside hitter Karsta Lowe, who
ranks fifth in the Pac-12 and leads
the team in kills with 4.04 per set
while hitting .350. Senior middle
blocker Mariana Aquino leads the
Bruins in blocks with 1.13 per set
and is sixth in the conference with a
.415 attack percentage. Finally, sen
ior outside hitter Kelly Reeves has
been recording 2.78 kills and 2.96
digs per set.
However, the team that will give
the Card the greatest challenge in
winning a repeat conference title
(besides No. 1 Washington) is USC.
