# SAFETIES SPEAK LOUDLY

### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Senior free safety Ed
Reynolds earned the reputa
tion as Stanford's ball hawk
after his three pick-sixes in
2013. But his counterpart,
junior strong safety Jordan
Richards, is no pushover.
Richards is known as a
harder hitter and himself re
turned an interception for a
touchdown the first of his
career, against Washington
State on Saturday. We asked
football writers Winston
Shi, Do-Hyoung Park and
David, Colin: Which starting
safety is more valuable to
Stanford ?

Winston: I'm not entirely
sure that you could find two bet
ter safeties in college football
than Jordan Richards and Ed
Reynolds. Stanford's stars excel
at anything that one could rea
sonably expect from a safety
duo, and it's hard to imagine
them not being included in the
end-of-season accolades. The
two of them obviously have dif
ferent roles to play, but I'd say
that Richards is more of your
prototypical safety he's trust
ed to hold down the top of the de
fense, allowing Stanford's Cover
2 to take on the characteristics of
a single safety, run-stopping
Cover 1 look at times. The two
have great chemistry and Stan
ford is lucky to have both of
them.

Reynolds has made the dif
ference time and time again on
the football field, most notably
with his near pick-six in last
year's Pac-12 championship
game. But Richards' role, at the
very least, is more foundational
than that of Reynolds. The first
goal of every secondary should
always be to avoid the big play,
and Richards does that more ef
fectively than anybody else. Out

side of garbage time, Stanford
has only given up three plays of
longer than 30 yards this season.
That's less than one big play a
game that stinginess is the
prime mover of Stanford's defen
sive success.

Reynolds' nose for the big
play has repeatedly halted oppo
nents' drives. Turnovers are ab
solutely backbreaking for an of
fense, and Reynolds can thus
credit himself with a massive
share of Stanford's more recent
success. But Richards is Stan
ford's last line of defense, and his
ability to cover the middle of the
field is the reason that Reynolds
can gamble by floating in the in

termediate zone, jumping pass
routes and flying to the ball.
I believe that Reynolds can
run the show as Richards cur
rently does, so to a certain ex
tent the question is academic.
The answer depends on what
you think about Stanford: Can
Stanford throttle its opponents
with slow, active containment, or
is ball-hawking necessary to stop
the explosive offenses that Stan
ford faces day in and day out?
More importantly: If a defense
aims to be as elite as that of
Stanford, shouldn't it be able to
do both at the same time?
