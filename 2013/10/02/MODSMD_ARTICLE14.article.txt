# SAFETIES SPEAK LOUDLY
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Senior free safety Ed
Reynolds earned the reputa
tion as Stanford's ball hawk
after his three pick-sixes in
2013. But his counterpart,
junior strong safety Jordan
Richards, is no pushover.
Richards is known as a
harder hitter and himself re
turned an interception for a
touchdown the first of his
career, against Washington
State on Saturday. We asked
football writers Winston
Shi, Do-Hyoung Park and
David, Colin: Which starting
safety is more valuable to
Stanford ?

Winston: I'm not entirely
sure that you could find two bet
ter safeties in college football
than Jordan Richards and Ed
Reynolds. Stanford's stars excel
at anything that one could rea
sonably expect from a safety
duo, and it's hard to imagine
them not being included in the
end-of-season accolades. The
two of them obviously have dif
ferent roles to play, but I'd say
that Richards is more of your
prototypical safety he's trust
ed to hold down the top of the de
fense, allowing Stanford's Cover
2 to take on the characteristics of
a single safety, run-stopping
Cover 1 look at times. The two
have great chemistry and Stan
ford is lucky to have both of
them.

Reynolds has made the dif
ference time and time again on
the football field, most notably
with his near pick-six in last
year's Pac-12 championship
game. But Richards' role, at the
very least, is more foundational
than that of Reynolds. The first
goal of every secondary should
always be to avoid the big play,
and Richards does that more ef
fectively than anybody else. Out

side of garbage time, Stanford
has only given up three plays of
longer than 30 yards this season.
That's less than one big play a
game that stinginess is the
prime mover of Stanford's defen
sive success.

Reynolds' nose for the big
play has repeatedly halted oppo
nents' drives. Turnovers are ab
solutely backbreaking for an of
fense, and Reynolds can thus
credit himself with a massive
share of Stanford's more recent
success. But Richards is Stan
ford's last line of defense, and his
ability to cover the middle of the
field is the reason that Reynolds
can gamble by floating in the in

termediate zone, jumping pass
routes and flying to the ball.
I believe that Reynolds can
run the show as Richards cur
rently does, so to a certain ex
tent the question is academic.
The answer depends on what
you think about Stanford: Can
Stanford throttle its opponents
with slow, active containment, or
is ball-hawking necessary to stop
the explosive offenses that Stan
ford faces day in and day out?
More importantly: If a defense
aims to be as elite as that of
Stanford, shouldn't it be able to
do both at the same time?


MIKE KHEIR/The Stanford Daily
Senior free safety Ed Reynolds (right) has accounted for seven picks
in the last one and a half seasons and earned preseason All-American
honors for his important role in the Cardinal secondary.
Do: Winston's going to come at
you with his football jargon, but I
really don't think he's doing any
justice at all to the fact that Ed
Reynolds has been more explo
sive than anybody in this second
ary for the last year and a half.
All of Stanford's safeties will
make the tackles and play great
pass coverage 1 coaching staff
will make sure of that. But Ed
Reynolds does that and has done
so much more. In fact, why are we
even asking this question?
Sure, Richards' role may be
more "foundational" to the team's
defense, but is there really a bet
ter way to measure value to a
football team than results? Jor
dan Richards is a fantastic player
and avoids the big play on a level
that matches or exceeds most
safeties around the country. He
makes Reynolds' job possible, as
Winston said.

But really, Ed Reynolds is the
one that executes. His is the big
name that opposing quarter
backs are scanning the field for,
and the senior also brings an
additional element to the table
that really takes him over the
top: his uncanny ability to in
stinctually read opposing quar
terbacks and come up with huge
plays to spur the defense and en
ergize the team. He doesn't just

avoid big plays; he makes big
plays happen on his own terms.
Richards may be a harder hit
ter and play excellent pass cover
age in his zone, but Reynolds' pass
coverage has proven second to
none during this last season and a
half as he seems to be literally
everywhere on the field, just wait
ing with bated breath to pick off
whatever unfortunate quarter
back happens to be challenging
the Cardinal secondary that day
and bring it to the house. Not only
is he the ball-hawk of the vaunted
Stanford defense, he is also a
leader on the field who spurs his
fellow defenders onward through
both his presence and his play. And
that is what makes Ed Reynolds
so valuable to the Cardinal.

David: In a staff meeting earli
er this week, I likened the process
of deciding between Jordan
Richards and Ed Reynolds to
choosing whether air or water was
more important to life. More
specifically, any answer that the
three of us may give is going to be
highly subjective, and, ultimately,
the process of choosing one over
the other is going to inherently ig
nore the fact that both are vital to
the Cardinal's defensive designs.
However, since I am being forced
to choose, I will say that Jordan
Richards is more valuable to
Stanford.

When I was watching film on
Jordan Richards from last year's
Pac-12 championship game, I was
struck by Richards' sheer ability
to tackle in the open field. He pos

sesses tremendous strength to
fight through blocks and bring
ball carriers to the ground. In ad
dition to that, Richards has great
speed particularly evident in
one rather unexpected example.
Early in the first quarter of
the Pac-12 championship, UCLA
tailback Johnathan Franklin
broke a run up the middle for a
51-yard touchdown. However,
what most people probably did
not notice on that particular play
was that Richards was able to run
down Franklin on his way to the
end zone, eventually tackling
Franklin after he had crossed the
goal line. While Richards was un
able to prevent UCLA from scor
ing, the fact that he was able to
catch the speedy Franklin was
nonetheless very impressive.

I wish to reiterate that Stan
ford is fortunate to have two
NFL-caliber starting safeties. Ed
Reynolds and Jordan Richards
provide unique skill sets that are
both very valuable to the Cardi
nal. In the end, I am left echoing
a thought of my colleague Do, al
beit for a very different reason:
Why are we even asking this ques
tion?

Do-Hyoung Park is going to be
looking over his shoulder for a
bone-crushing hit from Jordan
Richards after picking Ed
Reynolds. Contact Do at dparko27
