## SEEING GREEN Drilling Down, Drinking Up 
### Holly Moeller 
No matter how many times I
hear Toto "bless the rains
down in Africa," I've never
thought of the continent as a water
rich place. Perhaps it's the fame of
the Sahara desert, the nature docu
mentaries depicting wildebeest mi
gration on the savannah or the har
rowing tales of East Africa's drought
but I've always conjured dry,
dusty visions instead.

So when I heard that a vast new
underground water supply had been
found in Kenya's Turkana region, I
was intrigued.

The five aquifers each lying
more than 100 meters below the
Earth's surface supposedly con
tain as much as 66 trillion gallons of
water, the equivalent of 100 million
Olympic swimming pools. They were
discovered using new techno-sawy
approaches that combine satellite
imagery with traditional geological
and hydrological surveys to predict
areas where water ought to accumu
late belowground. (So far, two of the
five aquifers have been verified us-

ing test wells.)
The prospective water supply in
creases Kenya's known water re
serves by 17 percent and is a boon in
a country where more than half the
population lives without adequate
sanitation, and four in 10 people lack
ready access to drinking water. The
United Nations which, together
with the Japanese government,
helped pay for the water prospecting
hopes that the water will also help
irrigate crops, reducing hunger and
food resource conflicts.

Despite billing as a potential sal
vation for the drought-ridden region,
though, the new water supply should
come with a list of caveats. First, the
aquifer depth means that foreign in
vestors will have to bankroll extrac
tion infrastructure. Second, the
aquifers refill only through slow ac
cumulation of rainfall, which perco
lates through the soil into the water
table. Weather events can be spo
radic, however, and even with steady,
generous rain, it would take 75 years
to re-accumulate the water held in
the aquifers. So if the Kenyans use
more than about 1.5 million swim
ming pools full of water a year,
they're using the resource at a non
sustainable rate.

At least these aquifers do seem to
replenish themselves, however.
Plenty of other areas around the
world use "fossil" water supplies
belowgi'ound freshwater stocks that
were formed thousands, or even mil
lions, of years ago. These one-time
use stocks have supplied tremen
dous growth in water-poor regions,
but their tenure is fragile. In coastal
areas, depletion of groundwater sup
plies can result in salt intrusion, as
ocean water seeps in to fill in the

gaps. Excessive water removal can
also change the ground's physical
stability, causing shifts and tremors
as the ground settles over new air
pockets.

But the greatest threat, of
course, is the one to water security.
What happens when water supplies
dwindle?

In the United States, we use just
under 80 billion gallons of groundwa
ter each day. The new Kenyan

aquifers would last us just two years
and a few months. Of course, our
own freshwater supplies are much
larger, but that hasn't stopped us
from depleting them by about 264
trillion gallons.

Despite increasing awareness of
limited freshwater supplies and new
conservation technology, we contin
ue to deplete our groundwater sup
ply by a further six trillion gallons
each year. California's Central Val
ley, just next door, is 38 trillion gal
lons in the hole. In some areas, the
local water table has fallen to 30 me
ters below sea level.

Across the country, we're using
water at an unsustainable rate.

And in some areas, especially giv
en drought conditions like the ones
we experienced last year, that means
a tough reevaluation of water rights.
How do you regulate access to a be
lowground supply that doesn't follow
surface political boundaries?
Texas, at least, knows how it
shouldn't be done. Keen to protect
the property rights of its citizens, the
state uses the "Rule of Capture." Re
gardless of who shares the water
supply below your property, the
right to its use depends on who can
pump it out the fastest. This pits
neighbor against neighbor, ultimate
ly destroying a public good.

Most other states own their
groundwater and choose to allocate
it according to the needs of various
interest groups cities, farmers
and so on. Still, as climate change
shifts rainfall patterns, compound
ing the emerging issues of water re
source exhaustion, decision-making
across the country and across the
world will only become more com
plex.

Prospecting for new water sup
plies might provide stopgap relief for
some human suffering, but it can al
so bolster unsustainable growth,
producing a sharper crash in the
long run. We should be mindful of
this before drinking to (or drinking
up) our new discoveries.

ready access to drinking water. The
United Nations which, together
with the Japanese government,
helped pay for the water prospecting
hopes that the water will also help
irrigate crops, reducing hunger and
food resource conflicts.

Despite billing as a potential sal
vation for the drought-ridden region,
though, the new water supply should
come with a list of caveats. First, the
aquifer depth means that foreign in
vestors will have to bankroll extrac
tion infrastructure. Second, the
aquifers refill only through slow ac
cumulation of rainfall, which perco
lates through the soil into the water
table. Weather events can be spo
radic, however, and even with steady,
generous rain, it would take 75 years
to re-accumulate the water held in
the aquifers. So if the Kenyans use
more than about 1.5 million swim
ming pools full of water a year,
they're using the resource at a non
sustainable rate.

At least these aquifers do seem to
replenish themselves, however.
Plenty of other areas around the
world use "fossil" water supplies
belowgi'ound freshwater stocks that
were formed thousands, or even mil
lions, of years ago. These one-time
use stocks have supplied tremen
dous growth in water-poor regions,
but their tenure is fragile. In coastal
areas, depletion of groundwater sup
plies can result in salt intrusion, as
ocean water seeps in to fill in the

gaps. Excessive water removal can
also change the ground's physical
stability, causing shifts and tremors
as the ground settles over new air
pockets.

But the greatest threat, of
course, is the one to water security.
What happens when water supplies
dwindle?

In the United States, we use just
under 80 billion gallons of groundwa
ter each day. The new Kenyan

aquifers would last us just two years
and a few months. Of course, our
own freshwater supplies are much
larger, but that hasn't stopped us
from depleting them by about 264
trillion gallons.

Despite increasing awareness of
limited freshwater supplies and new
conservation technology, we contin
ue to deplete our groundwater sup
ply by a further six trillion gallons
each year. California's Central Val
ley, just next door, is 38 trillion gal
lons in the hole. In some areas, the
local water table has fallen to 30 me
ters below sea level.

Across the country, we're using
water at an unsustainable rate.

And in some areas, especially giv
en drought conditions like the ones
we experienced last year, that means
a tough reevaluation of water rights.
How do you regulate access to a be
lowground supply that doesn't follow
surface political boundaries?
Texas, at least, knows how it
shouldn't be done. Keen to protect
the property rights of its citizens, the
state uses the "Rule of Capture." Re
gardless of who shares the water
supply below your property, the
right to its use depends on who can
pump it out the fastest. This pits
neighbor against neighbor, ultimate
ly destroying a public good.

Most other states own their
groundwater and choose to allocate
it according to the needs of various
interest groups cities, farmers
and so on. Still, as climate change
shifts rainfall patterns, compound
ing the emerging issues of water re
source exhaustion, decision-making
across the country and across the
world will only become more com
plex.

Prospecting for new water sup
plies might provide stopgap relief for
some human suffering, but it can al
so bolster unsustainable growth,
producing a sharper crash in the
long run. We should be mindful of
this before drinking to (or drinking
up) our new discoveries.

Across
the country,
we're using
water at an
unsustainable
rate.

No matter how many times I
hear Toto "bless the rains
down in Africa," I've never
thought of the continent as a water
rich place. Perhaps it's the fame of
the Sahara desert, the nature docu
mentaries depicting wildebeest mi
gration on the savannah or the har
rowing tales of East Africa's drought
but I've always conjured dry,
dusty visions instead.

So when I heard that a vast new
underground water supply had been
found in Kenya's Turkana region, I
was intrigued.

The five aquifers each lying
more than 100 meters below the
Earth's surface supposedly con
tain as much as 66 trillion gallons of
water, the equivalent of 100 million
Olympic swimming pools. They were
discovered using new techno-sawy
approaches that combine satellite
imagery with traditional geological
and hydrological surveys to predict
areas where water ought to accumu
late belowground. (So far, two of the
five aquifers have been verified us-

ing test wells.)
The prospective water supply in
creases Kenya's known water re
serves by 17 percent and is a boon in
a country where more than half the
population lives without adequate
sanitation, and four in 10 people lack
ready access to drinking water. The
United Nations which, together
