# Automation, Robots and the Disappearing Worker
## 
### Chi Ling Chan 
Days ago, I came upon a letter
sent to The Economist, written
by a jobless man whose desper
ation is hard to miss:

"I am young and unemployed and
face a lifetime on the dole. Why? This
morning I collected my jobseekers al
lowance from my bank, where I have it
paid directly into my account. I did not
see a cashier, but withdrew money
from a cash point. Then I went to the
supermarket... I scanned the items
at a self-serve till, no need for a check
out assistant. I went home, switched
on my Chinese computer and applied
for jobs online. I do not send letters
through the post; e-mail is more con
venient. I then shopped online, I
rarely use local shops. Who can I
blame for the lack of jobs?"
A century ago, the same question
had been on the minds of a group of
workers in Yorkshire, Lancashire and
Nottingham. In an act of rebellion,
they took it out on spinning jennies
and power looms, smashing the ma
chines that had left low-skilled, low
wage laborers without work. Posterity
calls them "Luddites," a word that is
today synonymous with being an old

fuddy-duddy, decidedly anti-technolo
gy and anti-progress.

In Stanford and in Silicon Valley
especially, being labeled a Luddite is
almost tantamount to being sent into
exile. After all, who can be anti-tech
nology in the heart of techie paradise?
Yet slapping the luddite label on the
unemployed does not make the prob
lem go away Being so close to Silicon
Valley, we see technological progress
creating a seemingly endless stream
of lucrative jobs; what we don't see,
however, is how it is also eliminating
other types of jobs and leaving the
typical worker worse off than before.

There is no doubt, for one, that
workers are increasingly being
squeezed out by robots and automa
tion. And we're not talking only about
jobs at the lowest end of the pay scale
â€”what were once considered "mid
dle-class" jobs are also being hol
lowed out as your property agent
gives way to mobile applications like
Airbnb and Trulia and your baggage
check-in staff at the airport are re
placed by self check-in kiosks. With
the advent of MOOCs, community
college lecturers might in time find
themselves confronting superstar
lecturers who put their own necessity
into question.

Today, a whole class of workers is
being rendered irrelevant as technol
ogy like the Internet, big data and ar
tificial intelligence are automating
many routine tasks. It's not as simple
as robots replacing workers digital
processes are creating new processes
that enable us to do more with fewer
people and making human jobs obso
lete at a faster pace the skills and or
ganizations can catch up.
Under such circumstances, the
market does what it does best: It re
wards whoever adds the greatest eco
nomic value captured by the price
mechanism. And they are, in
escapably, owners of capital and ma
chines that bring about greater pro
ductivity and profits. With capital
based technological change comes a
notable shift in income away from la
bor: in the United States, the share of
compensation in gross domestic in
come is at a 60-year low, and the share
of middle-class income has fallen from
62 percent in the 1980s to 45 percent
today. Wither the American dream
there is probably no worse time to be
a worker with no special skills.
Who is to be blamed? The popular
rejoinder proffered by governments
all over has been uniformly disingenu
ous: market forces. The inexorable
forces of market competition, so the
story goes, has led to innovations that
increase productivity, and internation
al trade has put downward pressures
on wages.

For many governments, especially

those insisting on welfare minimal
ism, the sole corrective has been to
promote labor productivity: The onus
is always on the workers to play
catch-up with the robots. But increas
ingly this is not going to work, be
cause better education will not do
much to increase incomes or reduce
inequality as long as productivity in
creases of the machines outpace that
of the worker which it most cer
tainly will.

"Market forces" is a convenient
scapegoat because, being sufficiently
nebulous, it doesn't hold anyone re
sponsible and creates the illusion that
the plight of the middle-class is 'in
evitable' in the face of unstoppable
technological advancements and glob
alization. But if it is true that automa
tion is efficient, it is simply untrue that
it got there because of the market.
Much of the most important inno
vations were a result of public sector
investment. Silicon Valley for exam
ple, did not come about through pri
vate capital before there was Sili
con Valley there was Microwave Val
ley, which was essentially a federal
project specializing in electronic intel
ligence for CIA and the military. Stan
ford had research labs working for the
CIA, and several engineering doctoral
theses were actually classified.
Before Google and Flacebook be
came poster children for Silicon Valley,
the largest employer in the valley had
been Lockheed Martin. In short, what
is now the world's hotbed of innovation
once started out as Uncle Sam's ex
periment.

If Silicon Valley and all the techno
logical disruptions that have made
less-skilled workers obsolete is a re
sult of government-driven market dis
tortion, then the hollowing out of the
middle class is a failure of govern
ment, not "technology" or "market
forces".

Luddites past and present are not
anti-technology in the abstract
rather, the real struggle is against the
restructuring of social relations at
their expense. Historically, technology
both creates and destroys jobs; in
creasingly, though, the costs of techno
logical transitions are going to fall on
the workers and the less skilled.
It is no coincidence that the United
States is seeing a more unequal distri
bution of wealth despite tremendous
increases in economic productivity.
For governments and technological
optimists (which we have no lack of in
Stanford) alike, there is a need to re
visit the assumption that technological
progress is a good in and of itself that
can be allowed to eclipse notions of
fairness and social betterment.
