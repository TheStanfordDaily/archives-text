# EMILY OLIVER
## LIFE OVER SOCCER 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Emily Oliver's first on
field action for the Stan
ford women's soccer
team came as a freshman
in 2010 when after en
tering at halftime the young goal
keeper held off the Georgia
Bulldogs to ensure a 2-1
overtime victory for the
Cardinal.
„ ' It didn't take
long for Oliver to estab
lish herself as one of
the most dominant fe
/ V male collegiate soccer
W* players in the country.
During the 2011 season,
Oliver led the nation with a
0.23 goals-against average,
W earned 12 shutouts and was
named the Defensive MVP of the
2011 College Cup, leading Stanford
to its first national title since the
tournament began in 1982. She was
truly at the top of her game and the
top of her position.
Less than two years later, on
Aug. 31,2013, Oliver's soccer career
would come to a premature and
abrupt end. She suffered her fourth
concussion in a regular-season game
against Portland and like an in
creasing number of collegiate ath
letes Oliver chose her health over
her sport. On Sept. 20, Oliver an
nounced she was medically retiring
from the women's soccer team.
♦ ♦♦
At the start of the 2011 season, it
seemed as if Stanford women's soc
cer was cursed. Following phenome
nal regular seasons and national title
game appearances in the 2009 and
2010 seasons, the team had lost both
championship games by a single goal
apiece.
That year, the Cardinal played
like a team that had smelled victory
and then thirsted for more. The
squad started the season with a 4-0

win over Penn State and never
slowed down as it went undefeated
and ultimately vanquished Duke 1-0
in the national championship game.
The goalkeeper for that 2011
team was Emily Oliver, a young
sophomore from Flossmoor, 111. Oliv
er's future looked nothing but prom
ising. Though at 5-foot-7 Oliver was
short for a goalkeeper, her play re
flected a firm, unshakeable desire to
win.

"I think we've had a lot of talent
ed goalkeepers, but I don't know if
we've had any as competitive as
Emily," said Paul Ratcliffe, the 10-
year head coach of Stanford
women's soccer. "She came in here
and said, 'I want to help the team
win a national championship.'"
Oliver first started playing goal
keeper as a child because she was
one of the only 8-year-old girls who
was not afraid of the ball. She would
maintain that fearlessness through
out her career, and her aggressive
style of play made her a force to be
reckoned with on the pitch. Howev
er, that same boldness also eventual
ly led to health problems for the tal
ented goalkeeper. After suffering a
single concussion in high school,
Oliver suffered three more at Stan
ford including a particularly
nasty one in the spring of 2012.
Concussions vary widely in sever
ity, but a bad one can have life-alter
ing consequences. After her third
concussion, Oliver suffered from an
acute sensitivity to light and an in
ability to focus it was as if she was
living her life in a fog.

"For a couple of months, I'd stay
inside all day," Oliver said. "In my
room. In a dark room. Listening to
music, listening to an audiobook or
something, and... that was my day. I
didn't go to class, I didn't go to prac
tice, I was in there all day, in a dark
room, because that was the place
where I physically felt the best."

herself primarily as a student and
an athlete, and suddenly those two
things had been torn from her life.
"When I got that third one, I
couldn't even go to practice be
cause it was too bright out for me.
I didn't go to class ... it isolated me
from my friends," she said. "That
was what I was doing to take care
of myself at the time, but socially,
emotionally, that was very difficult
for me to be doing."
♦ ♦♦
Oliver's decision to medically
retire comes at a time when the
full damage done by concussions is
just beginning to be fully under
stood, and her decision may be
come a more common one among
student athletes across the nation.
Two Arizona linebackers an
nounced their retirements in early
September of this year after doc
tors advised them to stop playing
football following multiple concus
sions. Football is a sport where the
specter of concussions looms large
the NFL recently settled a $765
million dollar lawsuit in late Au
gust with thousands of players,
money that will go toward concus
sion-related medical bills and re
search regarding concussions.
Examples of the consequences
of concussions abound here on the
Farm too. Star guard Toni Koke
nis, a member of two Final Four
teams for Stanford women's bas
ketball, decided this summer to sit
out her senior year after suffering
from several concussions. Chris
Owusu, a former Stanford wide re
ceiver who posted top-five 40-me
ter dash, vertical jump and long
jump numbers at the 2012 NFL
combine, went undrafted after
concerns about his three concus
sions left NFL teams worried.
Eventually signed and later re
leased by the San Francisco 49ers,
Owusu has only recorded a single
reception in the NFL.
But all of the precedent and re
search in the world didn't make
Oliver's decision to medically re
tire any easier. While she was
lucky that her fourth concussion
was not as severe as her third, it
was still enough to make her re
consider her future. The goalkeep
er that had always played without
fear suddenly had something to
think twice about.

"It was three weeks of thinking
about it after that fourth concus
sion, in terms of what I wanted to
do, did I think I could came back,"
Oliver said. "It had always been in
the back of the mind after the
third one. 'What happens if I get

hit again? Will I have to go
through all those months of every
thing?"'
Oliver worried that if she began
to play with hesitation —to shy
away from the contact and tone
down the aggression that made her
the dominant player that she was
she would end up hurting her team.
If she couldn't play her game, she
decided, then she shouldn't play at
all.

"It was difficult to say the first
time," Oliver said, choking up
while describing telling first her
coach, and then her teammates,
that she wouldn't be able to play
soccer again. "[Coach Rateliffe]
understood the decision and was
extremely supportive. When I told
the team and all the girls, they
were all the same way. Everybody
that I've talked to has been very
supportive and has helped make
the entire situation bearable."

"I think it shows great maturity
that she was able to do that," Rat
eliffe said, praising Oliver for her
decision. "I think most people
would keep playing and severely
damage their future. Emily is a
very smart young lady, and she
talked to the doctors and decided it
was not worth her future health."

In the 15 years that Ratcliffe
has coached women's soccer, he
has seen the game grow progres
sively more physical. That leads to
more severe injuries for players
sometimes eliminating possibili
ties for future careers at the pro
fessional level.
"It's difficult to hear those
words, because I know that chap
ter is done in her life," Ratcliffe
said. "Emily is one that could quite
easily have gone on to play profes
sionally."
♦ ♦♦
Oliver will remain a captain on
the women's soccer team during
her senior year, attending home
games and playing a limited role in
practices.
"I help strike balls during goal
keeper training, and I get to be on
the sidelines for games," she said.
"It's been nice to feel like I'm part of
the program and the team and not
lose that family support system."
Without a future in soccer, the
question of what comes next looms
large for Oliver. I joke that she's
just like any other senior now, wor
rying about post-graduation life
and jobs and struggling with the
realization that a chapter of her
life will soon end.

The difference is, somewhere
inside Emily Oliver, there's still
that fearless 8-year-old girl, stand
ing in the goal, ready for whatever
life will kick at her.

Oliver's decision to medically
retire comes at a time when the
full damage done by concussions is
just beginning to be fully under
stood, and her decision may be
come a more common one among
student athletes across the nation.
Two Arizona linebackers an
nounced their retirements in early
September of this year after doc
tors advised them to stop playing
football following multiple concus
sions. Football is a sport where the
specter of concussions looms large
the NFL recently settled a $765
million dollar lawsuit in late Au
gust with thousands of players,
money that will go toward concus
sion-related medical bills and re
search regarding concussions.
Examples of the consequences
of concussions abound here on the
Farm too. Star guard Toni Koke
nis, a member of two Final Four
teams for Stanford women's bas
ketball, decided this summer to sit
out her senior year after suffering
from several concussions. Chris
Owusu, a former Stanford wide re
ceiver who posted top-five 40-me
ter dash, vertical jump and long
jump numbers at the 2012 NFL
combine, went undrafted after
concerns about his three concus
sions left NFL teams worried.
Eventually signed and later re
leased by the San Francisco 49ers,
Owusu has only recorded a single
reception in the NFL.
But all of the precedent and re
search in the world didn't make
Oliver's decision to medically re
tire any easier. While she was
lucky that her fourth concussion
was not as severe as her third, it
was still enough to make her re
consider her future. The goalkeep
er that had always played without
fear suddenly had something to
think twice about.

"It was three weeks of thinking
about it after that fourth concus
sion, in terms of what I wanted to
do, did I think I could came back,"
Oliver said. "It had always been in
the back of the mind after the
third one. 'What happens if I get

hit again? Will I have to go
through all those months of every
thing?"'
Oliver worried that if she began
to play with hesitation —to shy
away from the contact and tone
down the aggression that made her
the dominant player that she was
she would end up hurting her team.
If she couldn't play her game, she
decided, then she shouldn't play at
all.

"It was difficult to say the first
time," Oliver said, choking up
while describing telling first her
coach, and then her teammates,
that she wouldn't be able to play
soccer again. "[Coach Rateliffe]
understood the decision and was
extremely supportive. When I told
the team and all the girls, they
were all the same way. Everybody
that I've talked to has been very
supportive and has helped make
the entire situation bearable."

"I think it shows great maturity
that she was able to do that," Rat
eliffe said, praising Oliver for her
decision. "I think most people
would keep playing and severely
damage their future. Emily is a
very smart young lady, and she
talked to the doctors and decided it
was not worth her future health."

In the 15 years that Ratcliffe
has coached women's soccer, he
has seen the game grow progres
sively more physical. That leads to
more severe injuries for players
sometimes eliminating possibili
ties for future careers at the pro
fessional level.
"It's difficult to hear those
words, because I know that chap
ter is done in her life," Ratcliffe
said. "Emily is one that could quite
easily have gone on to play profes
sionally."
♦ ♦♦
Oliver will remain a captain on
the women's soccer team during
her senior year, attending home
games and playing a limited role in
practices.
"I help strike balls during goal
keeper training, and I get to be on
the sidelines for games," she said.
"It's been nice to feel like I'm part of
the program and the team and not
lose that family support system."
Without a future in soccer, the
question of what comes next looms
large for Oliver. I joke that she's
just like any other senior now, wor
rying about post-graduation life
and jobs and struggling with the
realization that a chapter of her
life will soon end.

The difference is, somewhere
inside Emily Oliver, there's still
that fearless 8-year-old girl, stand
ing in the goal, ready for whatever
life will kick at her.

Emily Oliver's first on
field action for the Stan
ford women's soccer
team came as a freshman
in 2010 when after en
tering at halftime the young goal
keeper held off the Georgia
Bulldogs to ensure a 2-1
overtime victory for the
Cardinal.
„ ' It didn't take
long for Oliver to estab
lish herself as one of
the most dominant fe
/ V male collegiate soccer
W* players in the country.
During the 2011 season,
Oliver led the nation with a
0.23 goals-against average,
W earned 12 shutouts and was
named the Defensive MVP of the
2011 College Cup, leading Stanford
to its first national title since the
tournament began in 1982. She was
truly at the top of her game and the
top of her position.
Less than two years later, on
Aug. 31,2013, Oliver's soccer career
would come to a premature and
abrupt end. She suffered her fourth
concussion in a regular-season game
against Portland and like an in
creasing number of collegiate ath
letes Oliver chose her health over
her sport. On Sept. 20, Oliver an
nounced she was medically retiring
from the women's soccer team.
♦ ♦♦
At the start of the 2011 season, it
seemed as if Stanford women's soc
cer was cursed. Following phenome
nal regular seasons and national title
game appearances in the 2009 and
2010 seasons, the team had lost both
championship games by a single goal
apiece.
That year, the Cardinal played
like a team that had smelled victory
and then thirsted for more. The
squad started the season with a 4-0

win over Penn State and never
slowed down as it went undefeated
and ultimately vanquished Duke 1-0
in the national championship game.
The goalkeeper for that 2011
team was Emily Oliver, a young
sophomore from Flossmoor, 111. Oliv
er's future looked nothing but prom
ising. Though at 5-foot-7 Oliver was
short for a goalkeeper, her play re
flected a firm, unshakeable desire to
win.

"I think we've had a lot of talent
ed goalkeepers, but I don't know if
we've had any as competitive as
Emily," said Paul Ratcliffe, the 10-
year head coach of Stanford
women's soccer. "She came in here
and said, 'I want to help the team
win a national championship.'"
Oliver first started playing goal
keeper as a child because she was
one of the only 8-year-old girls who
was not afraid of the ball. She would
maintain that fearlessness through
out her career, and her aggressive
style of play made her a force to be
reckoned with on the pitch. Howev
er, that same boldness also eventual
ly led to health problems for the tal
ented goalkeeper. After suffering a
single concussion in high school,
Oliver suffered three more at Stan
ford including a particularly
nasty one in the spring of 2012.
Concussions vary widely in sever
ity, but a bad one can have life-alter
ing consequences. After her third
concussion, Oliver suffered from an
acute sensitivity to light and an in
ability to focus it was as if she was
living her life in a fog.

"For a couple of months, I'd stay
inside all day," Oliver said. "In my
room. In a dark room. Listening to
music, listening to an audiobook or
something, and... that was my day. I
didn't go to class, I didn't go to prac
tice, I was in there all day, in a dark
room, because that was the place
where I physically felt the best."

that fearless 8-year-old girl, stand

life will kick at her.

Emily Oliver's first on
field action for the Stan
ford women's soccer
team came as a freshman
in 2010 when after en
tering at halftime the young goal
keeper held off the Georgia
Bulldogs to ensure a 2-1
overtime victory for the
Cardinal.
„ ' It didn't take
long for Oliver to estab
lish herself as one of
the most dominant fe
/ V male collegiate soccer
W* players in the country.
During the 2011 season,
Oliver led the nation with a
0.23 goals-against average,
W earned 12 shutouts and was
named the Defensive MVP of the
2011 College Cup, leading Stanford
to its first national title since the
tournament began in 1982. She was
truly at the top of her game and the
top of her position.
Less than two years later, on
Aug. 31,2013, Oliver's soccer career
would come to a premature and
abrupt end. She suffered her fourth
concussion in a regular-season game
against Portland and like an in
creasing number of collegiate ath
letes Oliver chose her health over
her sport. On Sept. 20, Oliver an
nounced she was medically retiring
from the women's soccer team.
♦ ♦♦
At the start of the 2011 season, it
seemed as if Stanford women's soc
cer was cursed. Following phenome
nal regular seasons and national title
game appearances in the 2009 and
2010 seasons, the team had lost both
championship games by a single goal
apiece.
That year, the Cardinal played
like a team that had smelled victory
and then thirsted for more. The
squad started the season with a 4-0

win over Penn State and never
slowed down as it went undefeated
and ultimately vanquished Duke 1-0
in the national championship game.
The goalkeeper for that 2011
team was Emily Oliver, a young
sophomore from Flossmoor, 111. Oliv
er's future looked nothing but prom
ising. Though at 5-foot-7 Oliver was
short for a goalkeeper, her play re
flected a firm, unshakeable desire to
win.

"I think we've had a lot of talent
ed goalkeepers, but I don't know if
we've had any as competitive as
Emily," said Paul Ratcliffe, the 10-
year head coach of Stanford
women's soccer. "She came in here
and said, 'I want to help the team
win a national championship.'"
Oliver first started playing goal
keeper as a child because she was
one of the only 8-year-old girls who
was not afraid of the ball. She would
maintain that fearlessness through
out her career, and her aggressive
style of play made her a force to be
reckoned with on the pitch. Howev
er, that same boldness also eventual
ly led to health problems for the tal
ented goalkeeper. After suffering a
single concussion in high school,
Oliver suffered three more at Stan
ford including a particularly
nasty one in the spring of 2012.
Concussions vary widely in sever
ity, but a bad one can have life-alter
ing consequences. After her third
concussion, Oliver suffered from an
acute sensitivity to light and an in
ability to focus it was as if she was
living her life in a fog.

"For a couple of months, I'd stay
inside all day," Oliver said. "In my
room. In a dark room. Listening to
music, listening to an audiobook or
something, and... that was my day. I
didn't go to class, I didn't go to prac
tice, I was in there all day, in a dark
room, because that was the place
where I physically felt the best."

herself primarily as a student and
an athlete, and suddenly those two
things had been torn from her life.
"When I got that third one, I
couldn't even go to practice be
cause it was too bright out for me.
I didn't go to class ... it isolated me
from my friends," she said. "That
was what I was doing to take care
of myself at the time, but socially,
emotionally, that was very difficult
for me to be doing."
♦ ♦♦
Oliver's decision to medically
retire comes at a time when the
full damage done by concussions is
just beginning to be fully under
stood, and her decision may be
come a more common one among
student athletes across the nation.
Two Arizona linebackers an
nounced their retirements in early
September of this year after doc
tors advised them to stop playing
football following multiple concus
sions. Football is a sport where the
specter of concussions looms large
the NFL recently settled a $765
million dollar lawsuit in late Au
gust with thousands of players,
money that will go toward concus
sion-related medical bills and re
search regarding concussions.
Examples of the consequences
of concussions abound here on the
Farm too. Star guard Toni Koke
nis, a member of two Final Four
teams for Stanford women's bas
ketball, decided this summer to sit
out her senior year after suffering
from several concussions. Chris
Owusu, a former Stanford wide re
ceiver who posted top-five 40-me
ter dash, vertical jump and long
jump numbers at the 2012 NFL
combine, went undrafted after
concerns about his three concus
sions left NFL teams worried.
Eventually signed and later re
leased by the San Francisco 49ers,
Owusu has only recorded a single
reception in the NFL.
But all of the precedent and re
search in the world didn't make
Oliver's decision to medically re
tire any easier. While she was
lucky that her fourth concussion
was not as severe as her third, it
was still enough to make her re
consider her future. The goalkeep
er that had always played without
fear suddenly had something to
think twice about.

"It was three weeks of thinking
about it after that fourth concus
sion, in terms of what I wanted to
do, did I think I could came back,"
Oliver said. "It had always been in
the back of the mind after the
third one. 'What happens if I get

hit again? Will I have to go
through all those months of every
thing?"'
Oliver worried that if she began
to play with hesitation —to shy
away from the contact and tone
down the aggression that made her
the dominant player that she was
she would end up hurting her team.
If she couldn't play her game, she
decided, then she shouldn't play at
all.

"It was difficult to say the first
time," Oliver said, choking up
while describing telling first her
coach, and then her teammates,
that she wouldn't be able to play
soccer again. "[Coach Rateliffe]
understood the decision and was
extremely supportive. When I told
the team and all the girls, they
were all the same way. Everybody
that I've talked to has been very
supportive and has helped make
the entire situation bearable."

"I think it shows great maturity
that she was able to do that," Rat
eliffe said, praising Oliver for her
decision. "I think most people
would keep playing and severely
damage their future. Emily is a
very smart young lady, and she
talked to the doctors and decided it
was not worth her future health."

In the 15 years that Ratcliffe
has coached women's soccer, he
has seen the game grow progres
sively more physical. That leads to
more severe injuries for players
sometimes eliminating possibili
ties for future careers at the pro
fessional level.
"It's difficult to hear those
words, because I know that chap
ter is done in her life," Ratcliffe
said. "Emily is one that could quite
easily have gone on to play profes
sionally."
♦ ♦♦
Oliver will remain a captain on
the women's soccer team during
her senior year, attending home
games and playing a limited role in
practices.
"I help strike balls during goal
keeper training, and I get to be on
the sidelines for games," she said.
"It's been nice to feel like I'm part of
the program and the team and not
lose that family support system."
Without a future in soccer, the
question of what comes next looms
large for Oliver. I joke that she's
just like any other senior now, wor
rying about post-graduation life
and jobs and struggling with the
realization that a chapter of her
life will soon end.

The difference is, somewhere
inside Emily Oliver, there's still
that fearless 8-year-old girl, stand
ing in the goal, ready for whatever
life will kick at her.
