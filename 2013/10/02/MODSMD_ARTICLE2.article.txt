# EMILY OLIVER
## LIFE OVER SOCCER 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Emily Oliver's first on
field action for the Stan
ford women's soccer
team came as a freshman
in 2010 when after en
tering at halftime the young goal
keeper held off the Georgia
Bulldogs to ensure a 2-1
overtime victory for the
Cardinal.
„ ' It didn't take
long for Oliver to estab
lish herself as one of
the most dominant fe
/ V male collegiate soccer
W* players in the country.
During the 2011 season,
Oliver led the nation with a
0.23 goals-against average,
W earned 12 shutouts and was
named the Defensive MVP of the
2011 College Cup, leading Stanford
to its first national title since the
tournament began in 1982. She was
truly at the top of her game and the
top of her position.
Less than two years later, on
Aug. 31,2013, Oliver's soccer career
would come to a premature and
abrupt end. She suffered her fourth
concussion in a regular-season game
against Portland and like an in
creasing number of collegiate ath
letes Oliver chose her health over
her sport. On Sept. 20, Oliver an
nounced she was medically retiring
from the women's soccer team.

At the start of the 2011 season, it
seemed as if Stanford women's soc
cer was cursed. Following phenome
nal regular seasons and national title
game appearances in the 2009 and
2010 seasons, the team had lost both
championship games by a single goal
apiece.
That year, the Cardinal played
like a team that had smelled victory
and then thirsted for more. The
squad started the season with a 4-0

win over Penn State and never
slowed down as it went undefeated
and ultimately vanquished Duke 1-0
in the national championship game.
The goalkeeper for that 2011
team was Emily Oliver, a young
sophomore from Flossmoor, 111. Oliv
er's future looked nothing but prom
ising. Though at 5-foot-7 Oliver was
short for a goalkeeper, her play re
flected a firm, unshakeable desire to
win.

"I think we've had a lot of talent
ed goalkeepers, but I don't know if
we've had any as competitive as
Emily," said Paul Ratcliffe, the 10-
year head coach of Stanford
women's soccer. "She came in here
and said, 'I want to help the team
win a national championship.'"
Oliver first started playing goal
keeper as a child because she was
one of the only 8-year-old girls who
was not afraid of the ball. She would
maintain that fearlessness through
out her career, and her aggressive
style of play made her a force to be
reckoned with on the pitch. Howev
er, that same boldness also eventual
ly led to health problems for the tal
ented goalkeeper. After suffering a
single concussion in high school,
Oliver suffered three more at Stan
ford including a particularly
nasty one in the spring of 2012.
Concussions vary widely in sever
ity, but a bad one can have life-alter
ing consequences. After her third
concussion, Oliver suffered from an
acute sensitivity to light and an in
ability to focus it was as if she was
living her life in a fog.

"For a couple of months, I'd stay
inside all day," Oliver said. "In my
room. In a dark room. Listening to
music, listening to an audiobook or
something, and... that was my day. I
didn't go to class, I didn't go to prac
tice, I was in there all day, in a dark
room, because that was the place
where I physically felt the best."
