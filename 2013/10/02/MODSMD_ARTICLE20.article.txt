## Kim leads Card in Windy City 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Whenever the No. 12 Stanford
women's golf team is brought up,
the conversation almost immedi
ately centers on Mariah Stack
house and for good reason. The
budding sophomore star was the
team's lowest scorer in seven of her
team's 11 tournaments last year
and keyed the Cardinal's 24th place
finish at May's NCAA Champi
onships.

Somewhat lost in the Stack
house spotlight, however, was her
classmate Lauren Kim. But after a
dramatic win at August's California
State Women's Amateur and lead
ing her team to an impressive T-3rd
placing at the Windy City Colle
giate Classic yesterday, Stanford
may yet have another young golfer
ready to lead it to the promised
land.

Despite finishing T-4th individu
ally at Windy City held at
Northmoor Golf Course in High
land Park, 111. Kim had a rather
inauspicious start to her tourna

ment. She recorded two bogeys and
a double bogey in her first nine
holes of Monday's opening round
en route to carding a 4-over 75.
While the Los Altos native admit
tedly struggled with her rhythm
and ball striking, she made an
about face in the afternoon frame.
Her 3-under 68 was the second low
est round of the entire day, and it
would've been even better had it
not been for a two-stroke penalty
on the par-5 3rd for hitting the
wrong ball.
"I gave myself more opportuni
ties for birdie [in the afternoon ses
sion] even though I wasn't hitting
the ball very well all day," said Kim
after the first 36 holes. "I took ad
vantage of the birdie holes and
played more consistently. I was
struggling with my tempo in the
morning, which was something I
definitely fixed in the afternoon."

Kim maintained her momentum
into yesterday's final round,
birdieing three of her last five holes
to catapult from T-14th place to T
-4th in the individual standings. Her
cumulative score of 1-under 212

was four shots behind tournament
winner Lindsay Weaver of No. 10
Arizona. In doing so, she was the
lone Cardinal player to finish under
par.

"Lauren Kim was our star this
week," said second-year head coach
Anne Walker. "She was 4-over for
her first nine holes and then 5-un
der for her final 45 holes. She fin
ished with three straight birdies to
day on holes 14-16, and that was
clutch play."
Also turning in a solid tourna
ment was Mariko Tumangan, con
tinuing her resurgent play from the
end of the 2013 spring season. The
junior was her team's leader after
18 holes and shot rounds of 70-73-
72 on the par-71 course to finish in
a tie for seventh. Stackhouse was
Stanford's third player in the top
10, recording a cumulative score of
3-over 216, good enough for T-9th
in the individual race.

"My first 36 holes were very sol
id," commented Stackhouse after
Monday's rounds. "I struggled to
