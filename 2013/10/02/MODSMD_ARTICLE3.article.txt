## ASSU Senate debates new alcohol policy Senate approves new class traditions funding bills 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
The 15th Undergraduate Senate
held another busy meeting on Tuesday
evening, with a debate about an AS
SU-funded alcohol policy for student
groups and discussions of new funding
bills.

The Senate followed up on two bills
discussed during the previous meeting
the appropriation of general fees
reserves to create a Class President
Grant Program and the appropriation
of traditions funding for the classes of
2014, 2015 and 2016. The bills were
both discussed in the previous meeting
and passed unanimously on Tuesday
evening.

The traditions fund will give $l,OOO
to the senior class, $6,070 to the class
of 2015 and $5,430 to the class of 2016
totaling the proposed $12,500.
In addition, the Senate passed
$33,949.56 in funding bills for eight dif
ferent campus groups.

The meeting also focused on sever
al issues that the Senate hopes to tack
le in the future, such as the possibility
of funding alcohol for student events
with ASSU funds. The topic which
has already been discussed in the ap
propriations committee prompted a
heated debate in an open forum that
took place primarily between Hisham
Al-Falih 'l6 and Ilya Mouzykantskii
'l6.

Falih felt strongly that the Senate
should not support alcohol funding for
student events.
"I believe the biggest issue
right now is forcing 100 percent of
the student population to pay for
something that less than 25 per
cent of the population will be able
to use," said Falih.
Mouzykantskii, however, ar
gued that there is a large contin
gent of student groups on campus
that want to be able have alcohol
funded for their events and not de
pend on slush funds that, according
to Mouzykantskii, are fundamen
tally unsafe and expose the Univer
sity to risk.
"The appropriations alcohol
policy, if it stands ... will make alco
hol consumption safer, it will abide
by university policy and I think it
has to abide by federal, state and
local guidelines as well," said
Mouzykantskii.

Senator Nikos Liodakis 'l6 cut
the debate short, postponing the
discussion indefinitely so that the
appropriations committee, along

with any other senators who are in
terested, can focus on creating a
bill that will lead to a more organ
ized discussion at some point.

ASSU Assistant Financial Man
ager Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4 introduced two bills during the
meeting that are designated for
more overarching projects. The
first of the bills requests funds for
an upgrade of the ASSU office
space, and the second bill requests
money to study and improve ASSU
operations.
The financial managers are ask
ing for a total of $75,000 for these
two projects, which would come out
of the buffer funds from both the
Undergraduate Senate and the
Graduate Student Council.

Senator John-Lancaster Finley
'l6 spoke with enthusiasm about
Trusheim's proposals, urging the
rest of the Senate to vote on them
the following week.
The Senate also approved
Hunter Kodama'l4 as the Elec
tions Commissioner on the 2014
Elections Commission.
