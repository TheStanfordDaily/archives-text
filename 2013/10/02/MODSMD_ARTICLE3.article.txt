### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
The 15th Undergraduate Senate
held another busy meeting on Tuesday
evening, with a debate about an AS
SU-funded alcohol policy for student
groups and discussions of new funding
bills.

The Senate followed up on two bills
discussed during the previous meeting
the appropriation of general fees
reserves to create a Class President
Grant Program and the appropriation
of traditions funding for the classes of
2014, 2015 and 2016. The bills were
both discussed in the previous meeting
and passed unanimously on Tuesday
evening.

The traditions fund will give $l,OOO
to the senior class, $6,070 to the class
of 2015 and $5,430 to the class of 2016
totaling the proposed $12,500.
In addition, the Senate passed
$33,949.56 in funding bills for eight dif
ferent campus groups.

The meeting also focused on sever
al issues that the Senate hopes to tack
le in the future, such as the possibility
of funding alcohol for student events
with ASSU funds. The topic which
has already been discussed in the ap
propriations committee prompted a
heated debate in an open forum that
took place primarily between Hisham
Al-Falih 'l6 and Ilya Mouzykantskii
'l6.

Falih felt strongly that the Senate
should not support alcohol funding for
student events.
