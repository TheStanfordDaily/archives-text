## Muslim center opens tomorrow Markaz Resource Center to welcome students in Nitery 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow, the Markaz: Resource
Center for Engagement with the Cul
tures and Peoples of the Muslim
World will open its doors in the
Nitery Building in Old Union after
more than a decade of collaborative
discussions between students, faculty
and University administrators.
The center's goal is to offer a place
where students can learn about Islam
and the diverse countries and cul
tures that make up the Muslim world.
Hana Al-Henaid 'l4, president of
the Muslim Student Awareness Net
work (MSAN), played an integral
role in creating the center. She took
action after noticing Stanford's lack
of resources on Muslim culture.
"There really isn't a physical
space on campus where students can
go if they're just interested in doing
research in the Middle East or if
they're interested in Southeast Asia,"
Al-Henaid said.
Stanford has many ethnic-themed
dorms and community centers
around campus, but until now none of
them have been specifically designed
