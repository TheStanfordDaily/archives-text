## Muslim center opens tomorrow Markaz Resource Center to welcome students in Nitery 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow, the Markaz: Resource
Center for Engagement with the Cul
tures and Peoples of the Muslim
World will open its doors in the
Nitery Building in Old Union after
more than a decade of collaborative
discussions between students, faculty
and University administrators.
The center's goal is to offer a place
where students can learn about Islam
and the diverse countries and cul
tures that make up the Muslim world.
Hana Al-Henaid 'l4, president of
the Muslim Student Awareness Net
work (MSAN), played an integral
role in creating the center. She took
action after noticing Stanford's lack
of resources on Muslim culture.
"There really isn't a physical
space on campus where students can
go if they're just interested in doing
research in the Middle East or if
they're interested in Southeast Asia,"
Al-Henaid said.
Stanford has many ethnic-themed
dorms and community centers
around campus, but until now none of
them have been specifically designed
for Muslim students.
Sayeh Fattahi 'l4, vice president
of MSAN, stated that almost every
top-10 or top-20 ranked university in
the nation except for Stanford offers
a Muslim student resource.
"A big reason why [administra
tors] were so eager to help us was be
cause they realized the importance of
[a student center like the Markaz],"
Fattahi said.
Various events at the center have
already been proposed, such as pro
fessor talks, film screenings, sessions
offering advice about study abroad
opportunities and "chai chats" where
students can talk about issues in the
Muslim world in a more informal at
mosphere.
"It's a center for engagement and
learning," Fattahi said. 'At Stanford,
only so much of the learning happens
in the classroom."

"What we're trying to do with the
Markaz is have a place where people
can learn in a more personal setting,"
she added.

All programming at the Markaz
will be entirely student initiated be
cause no full-time program associate
has been hired to manage events at

the center. Al-Henaid said, however,
that getting a full-time staff member
to work at the Markaz is a long-term
goal.

Although the Markaz is located in
the Nitery, close to many community
centers such as El Centra Chicano
and the Native American Cultural
Center, those involved with the proj
ect decided it would distinguish itself
as a resource center, not a communi
ty center.

Al-Henaid explained that the
services and events held at the
Markaz would be more similar to the
types held at the LGBT Community
Resource Center than its neighbor
ing community centers.
"We want it to be an open space
that people are comfortable going
to," Fattahi added.

Both students and administrators
have felt the need for a Muslim stu
dent center on campus for a long
time.
"We definitely saw this as a need

on campus so when we were meeting
with administrator, they recognized
that need too, and they were very re
ceptive to us and worked with us a
lot."

Eattahi, Al-Henaid and other stu
dent leaders met with several admin
istrators, including Director of the
Office of Diversity and First-Genera
tion Programs Tommy Lee Woon,
Vice Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman, Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Harry Elam,
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D 'B2
and President John Hennessy, to dis
cuss the possibility of the center.
These initial student meetings
with administrators resulted in sev
eral proposals and the designation of
two rooms in the Nitery for the
Markaz. The Markaz is classified as a
Stanford University center and
therefore is not officially organized or
run by any particular student group.
"It was a very collaborative
process... it was kind of the melding
of [students' and administrators'] vi
sions that created the Markaz," Al-
Henaid said.

The grand opening celebration,
featuring welcome speeches by stu
dents, administrators and faculty will
begin at 6 p.m. tomorrow at the
Nitery in Old Union.
