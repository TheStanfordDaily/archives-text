## Honors in Arts sees diversity Inaugural class composed mainly of non-arts majors 
### KYLIE JUE 
This quarter marks the start of
Stanford's new interdisciplinary
Honors Program in the Arts for 12
inaugural students.

Participating seniors, many of
whom are not arts majors, will com
plete capstone projects combining
their majors with their interest in
the arts and will also have the op
portunity to graduate with an hon
ors distinction.

The Biology Department's Sen
ior Reflection capstone program
launched in 2010 by biology profes
sor Susan McConnell and Andrew
Todhunter, current associate direc
tor and workshop leader for the
Honors in the Arts program in
spired Matthew Tiews M.A. '99
Ph.D. 'O4, executive director of Arts
Programs, and Stephen Hinton, di
rector of the Stanford Arts Insti
tute, to develop a broader version
of the program that would be open
to all students.

Emily Saidel, grants adminis
trator and programs assistant for
the Arts Institute, explained that
the honors program had been pro
posed last year and was approved
in May 2013.

"Students from all different ma
jors can apply to be part of it and
form one cohort of people with lots
of different backgrounds," Saidel
said. "The goal of the program is to
integrate the art experience with
the student's other field of study,
whatever that other field of study
is."

To apply to the program, stu
dents had to demonstrate experi
ence through courses they've taken
in their chosen art form, write a de
tailed proposal for their capstone
project and have a GPA of 3.67 or
higher. However, administrators al
so said that many students took ad
vantage of the ability to petition to
apply even if their GPA was not
high enough.
"There were initially 39 applica
tions for the initial 12 spots," Tod
hunter said.

Although diversity played a role
when choosing applicants for the
program, Hinton emphasized the
importance of project proposals.
"Ultimately, I think our first cri
terion is, 'Does this look like an in
teresting project?' Are we hearing
from the student that they will re-

ally get something out of doing
this?" Hinton said.

Diverse student line-up

The 12 selected students come
from a wide range of backgrounds.
Their majors range from English
to anthropology to computer sci
ence, and seven of the 12 students
are also pursuing minors in areas
that include art and art history.
In fact, Todhunter said that
since the program takes an inter
disciplinary approach, very few
arts majors are participating.
"Because it's an interdiscipli
nary program, it's really designed
more to give students who are cre
ative but not arts majors ... the op
portunity to renew a creative life
here," Todhunter said.
David Grunzweig 'l4, an electri
cal engineering major, exemplifies
the interdisciplinary nature of the
program.

"I've always wanted to be a mu
sic double major or at least get a
music minor," Grunzweig said.
"This seemed to me like the best
way to really emphasize the signif
icance of music in my life."
Grunzweig is currently plan
ning his project around jazz compo
sition that incorporates modern
recording techniques. He hopes to
dispel the assumptions that com
puter music lacks expressiveness
and human connection.

"I'm trying to capture some re
ally big picture ideas with this proj
ect," Grunzweig said. "And I'm ex-

cited to hear back from people that
have... critiqued art as a profes
sion."

Tiffany Dharma 'l4, a computer
science major, learned about the
program through her participation
in the New York Arts Immersion
program during her sophomore
year. Although still subject to
change, her project also dabbles in
both the sciences and the arts.

"I haven't exactly pinned some
thing down yet, but in my proposal

... a lot of interest is in art museums
and the experience people have
with art in those spaces," Dharma
said.

The 12 students are divided into
two groups of six, and the pro
gram's format centers on hands-on
workshops that meet once a week
and may include guest speakers or
field trips.
To graduate with honors in the
arts, students must receive at least
an A- on them projects, which will
also be reviewed by an impartial
panel of professional artists.
Saidel is hopeful that all the stu
dents will come out with honors.

"In some ways, this may be
their last chance to really spend a
lot of time focused on their art
making," Saidel said. "In a year,
they'll graduate and go on to the
next stage in life, which doesn't al
ways allow for the flexibility to have
that artistic output."
