## UAR working to improve Pre-Major Advising 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
Over the past year, the Office of Un
dergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR) has been working on new ways to
enhance the Pre-Major Advising (PMA)
program.

One of the recent changes included
naming Alice Petty, a former academic di
rector, as the new director of the PMA
program.

However, UAR has also been working
to clarify the role of a PMA in response to
student feedback they received through
surveys and focus groups during spring
quarter of last year.

Throughout the 2012-13 school year,
academic directors and officials from UAR
held bi-weekly meetings for brainstorm
ing sessions they called PMA lab.
"We just got together to talk about
what we wanted to do with the PMA pro
gram in coming years," said Kirsti
Copeland, a PMA and associate dean of
residentially based advising and pre-ma
jor advising.

Copeland said one of the things they
discussed during their meetings was how
to structure conversations between PMAs
and students for specific times of the year
rather than limiting interactions to stu-

dents asking their advisors to lift a
hold barring them from registering
for classes each quarter.
She explained that a proposed
structure would involve quarterly
themed conversations with talk of
transitioning during the fall and dis
cussions of various campus opportu
nities during the winter. During the
spring, Copeland said students
should take a moment to reflect with
their PMAs on their past interac
tions.

"They're actually these impor
tant reflective moments to think

back to what's going on and how we
help a student best transition
[through] Stanford, find these op
portunities and reflect on their ex
perience," Copeland said.
Despite the PMA lab's sugges
tions, Copeland said that all PMAs
who volunteer for the unpaid role
have their own way of advising.
"We are not creating a one-size
fits all program," she said.
Indeed, PMAs have different
takes on their roles in advising stu
dents.

"I see my role as talking them
through the questions of why they
came to Stanford and what they're
interested in," said Roland Greene,
professor of comparative literature.
He said he tries to dispel stu
dents' assumptions about Stanford

as a PMA and encourage them to
think about what benefits they can
reap from their education.
However, Greene said he faces a
challenge when students come in
with ideas of what majors their
peers or parents consider more use
ful for securing employment after
graduation.
"You don't come to a place like
this to follow conventional wisdom,"
he said. "You come to expand your
self intellectually and as long as
you're doing that at a good pace,
you're doing the right thing.
Academic directors often pair
PMAs with students, though advi
sors can ask for students with par
ticular qualities. As former director
of the residential program Struc
tured Liberal Education (SLE),

Greene said he always asks for ad
visees in the program.
"I think the relationship with
those students is something I can
carry on into later years," he said.
Other PMAs have broader pref
erences.

"I like advisees who are polite
and passionate and have the
courage to find their own paths in
life," said Matthew Rabinowitz '96
M.S. '97 Ph.D. 'Ol, consulting pro
fessor in the School of Engineering.

Rabinowitz said he tries to ad
vise his students in areas other than
course selection and academics.

"I really think that the key
thing here in terms of helping stu
dents academically and profession
ally is to give them perspectives,"
he said. "It's about finding things
that they want to do and helping
them."

He added, however, that it's not
necessarily a simple task.
"Sometimes I get students who
have personal problems, and the
challenge for me as an advisor is to
know how involved [I should be] in
them," he said. "It's difficult to
know where the line should be."
Other PMAs faced similar chal

lenges in their advising, including
Marian Adams 'B4 Ph.D. '93, clini
cal associate professor of pediatrics
and neonatology at the Stanford
School of Medicine.
"I think that the most difficult
situation I find myself in was where
one of my advisees was getting in
over her head academically,"
Adams said. "I was kind of trying
to advise her to take it a bit easier,
and I wasn't quite getting
through."

Adams added that she could tell
her advisee was struggling aca
demically with the workload she set
for herself.
"I think that the most difficult
part is trying to be very supporting
but not wanting them to fall with
out a safety net and getting every
thing connected to get them help,"
Adams said.

Despite the challenges that
arise from the no one-size-fits-all
model of advising, surveyed PMAs
agreed that the voluntary work is
worthwhile for themselves and for
the students they serve.
