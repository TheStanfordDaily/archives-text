## Stanford engineers reach breakthrough in nanotechnology advancement 
### â€” Alexa Liautaud 
A team of Stanford engineers
has succeeded in creating a faster,
more energy-efficient computer us
ing transistors made of carbon nan
otubes. The breakthrough comes
after years of scientific efforts
around the world attempting to uti
lize this material as a replacement
to the current silicon transistor. No
one has been able to prove its func
tional use until now.

The notable team was led by
Stanford professors Subhasish Mi
tra Ph.D. 'OO and H.S. Philip Wong.
According to several experts,
the continued use of silicon chips is
becoming increasingly hazardous
and inefficient.

The electronics industry's in
creasing demand for thinner and

thinner devices has led to the need
for smaller and smaller silicon tran
sistors. The smaller the transistor,
the more energy is needed and the
more power is wasted demon
strated by the heat felt from the bot
tom of one's computer. Carbon nan
otubes offer lower-power computing
with better energy efficiency, both in
conducting and controlling electricity.
While scientists agree that there
is still much more testing to be done
before commercial use, the proof
that carbon nanotubes can substi
tute pure silicon transistors in pow
ering a universal computer is nev
ertheless a cutting-edge stride in
nanotechnology.
