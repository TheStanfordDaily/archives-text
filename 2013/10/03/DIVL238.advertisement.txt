Stanford Continuing Studies presents
The impressionist Magic of Claude Debussy:
An Evening with the Saint Michael Trio
Friday, October 4
8:00 pm
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Stanford University
Free and open to the public
Heavy-handed, cantankerous, his personal life a wreck, Claude
Debussy (1862-19181 nevertheless wrote music of unsurpassed
delicacy and refinement. Though he chafed at the label, he became
music's supreme impressionist in a twilight moment of European
culture. In this program, The Saint Michael Trio will show you how
the Impressionist movement emerged in one of the Trio's "informances,"
featuring slides, commentary, and demonstrations of Debussy's
path breaking compositional devices. Works to be performed include
Debussy's Piano Trio in G Major.
The Saint Michael Trio
Established in 2007, the Saint Michael Trio (Daniel Cher, Michel Flexer,
and Russell Hancock) has risen quickly to prominence. Hailed as
Silicon Valley's update to the classical music scene, the trio's
recordings have been applauded in the national press, and the
members have received special praise for making their concerts
interesting and accessible.
