## Embracing the Fundamental Standard, Honor Code and Cardinal Code

Say it's 2 a.m. and you have a 10-
page literary analysis due in
seven hours. You haven't read
the book and haven't slept. Browsing
the Internet, you find that someone
has written about this book before.
Maybe you could just copy and paste
and change a few words here and
there. Don't do it. Plagiarism is a vio
lation of the Honor Code. Better to
fail the assignment than go down that
road.
The Stanford community has rea
son to be proud of the Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard, which are poli
cies that articulate our values as a uni
versity Together, they create the Car
dinal Code, which embodies the notion
that we have obligations to each other
and to the community as a whole to al
ways strive to do the right thing.
But for all their virtues, the Hon
or Code and Firndamental Standard
suffer from a woeful lack of familiari
ty among students and faculty. That
was the conclusion of a committee
that recently reviewed the Stanford
judicial process. In their 2012 report,
student, staff and faculty committee
members lamented, "Our- evidence
shows that neither is as widely under
stood and valued by our students and
facility as it should be."
I find that troubling. For ours to
be a culture of integrity, all members
of the university community must
embrace the policies' noble intents.
So I dedicated my New Student
Orientation talk to freshmen and
transfer students to explaining the
Honor Code and Firndamental Stan
dard, emphasizing why both have
been Stanford mainstays for genera
tions and how both have contributed
to the University's excellence.
I did so because I believe that by
accepting our invitation to attend, all
students agree to become part of
something much bigger than them
selves. Students of the past sustained
this university so that those who fol
lowed could inherit the respect asso
ciated with a Stanford degree. For
that respect to continue, today's stu
dents must do their pari as well.
That means embracing their re
sponsibilities under the Honor Code,
which was established in 1921 and
written by students for students, and
the Firndamental Standard, which
was articulated by President David
Stan- Jordan in 1896. Both set stan
dards for student conduct inside and
outside the classroom.
The Firndamental Standard says,
"Students at Stanford are expected to
show both within and without the
University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the
rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens."
The Honor Code applies the Firn
damental Standard to the classroom,
expressing our' commitment to aca
demic integrity. On the one hand, stu
dents pledge not to give or receive un-

permitted aid or to present someone
else's work as their own. They also
agree to ensure that others uphold
this standard. In return, the faculty
agrees to trust in the integrity and
honesty of their' students, until that
trust is unwarranted.
Understanding the policies is one
thing. Living by them is another. It
can be hard. Say you're taking a final.
As required by the Honor Code, your
professor has left the room. You are
writing furiously, but you look up
from your blue book long enough to
see another student looking at notes
on an iPhone. You know the professor
prohibited electronic devices from the
test site. It is your job to tell the pro
fessor what you saw
Neither plagiarism as reflected in
my first example nor unpermitted aid
described in the second is victimless.
Cheating wounds the perpetrator
and poisons the culture. Moral
courage isn't easy. But the only way to
ensure the efficacy of the Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard is if we all
take responsibility for* them.
But there's more to the Cardinal
Code. We must also recognize that we
are partner's in the Stanford experi
ence. Partners watch out for one an
other. They help each other succeed
and take pleasure in each other's suc
cess. Sometimes they save friends
when they do something they'll be
sorry about in the morning.
Socrates once said, "Regard your
good name as the richest jewel you
can possibly be possessed of—for
credit is like fire; when once you have
kindled it, you may easily preserve it;
but if you once extinguish it, you will
find it an arduous task to rekindle it
again. The way to gain a good reputa
tion is to endeavor to be what you de
sire to appear."
Guard your good name and that of
Stanford and take care of one anoth
er. That's how you live by the Cardi
nal Code.

Guard your good
name and that of
Stanford... That's
how you live by
the Cardinal
Code
