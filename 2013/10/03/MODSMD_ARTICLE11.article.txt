# Information security is broken-but we can fix it!
## 
### Omar Diab 
The Sons of Liberty could not
have caused the American
Revolution if they could not
communicate privately.
Nowadays, secure communica
tion is more complicated than just
locking the doors and whispering.
With the advent of the World Wide
Web, the way people communicate
has fundamentally changed. Now,
communication happens not just
across the room but also across the
world.
I think that people ought to care
more about security, but the true
reason that most people shrug pri
vacy without a fight is not that they
don't care about it; it's that tools to
secure communication online are
not readily accessible to the gener
al, non-technical public.
It's just too much of a pain to se
cure your online activity, and it
shouldn't be that way.
If you have doubts on the impor
tance of information security, think
again. For one, the protection of
free speech depends on it; it is diffi
cult to be a political dissenter in a
strong surveillance state like China,
for instance.
While that opinion may border
too much on paranoia, it's also a
matter of protecting your personal
information from fraud and identity
theft. Many argue they have noth
ing to hide, but conveniently forget
that they do wish to hide their bank
account numbers, and don't want
the local cybei'-bully to read their
significant others' love letters.
The problem lies in the mecha
nisms for facilitating secure com
munication. On one level, some of

the technological approaches to se
curity are flawed because of the as
sumptions they rest on (that's an
other, nerdier discussion), but I
think most people fail to adopt secu
rity measures because the tools are
too plain difficult to use.
For instance, take email. Email
on its own is a fundamentally inse
cure protocol that is, it's not con
fidential, since you could intercept a
message as it is in transit; it doesn't
guarantee the sender or receiver
are who they claim they are; and
you can't necessarily even be sure
that what you receive is what the
sender actually sent, since someone
can intercept the message and
tamper with it.
There are two ways to deal with
this conundrum. For one, you could
just not use email (yeah, right). But
thankfully, there exists the Pretty
Good Privacy (PGP) program that
provides a suite of tools that allow
you to effectively secure all of the
above issues with email.
"That sounds great, Omar!" you
may exclaim, but using it is not triv
ial. First, you have to know about
PGP That already cuts out over
90% of all people in the United
States from even thinking about
having effective email security.
And even then, you have to in
stall a PGP implementation on your
computer and figure out how to use
it with your email client (if that's
even possible it's not if you use
the Gmail web interface, for in
stance). You then are confronted
with making and publishing public
and private keys, something that I
only learned about while doing my

computer science degree at Stan
ford.
My question is: why isn't there
just a "secure email" button? It's
not technologically infeasible; in
fact, every relevant tool already ex
ists. But neither Windows nor Mac
OSX come with the ability to com
municate securely preinstalled (the
Linux geeks like me can figure it
out ourselves), and almost none of
the popular email services like
Gmail or Yahoo provide this func
tionality out of the box.
I think that they all really should,
and this is just one example of many
things to be done to improve com
puter security. Companies seem to
be moving in this direction. The Ap
ple iPhone sS's fingerprint sensor
may have been thwarted already, but
it's a step in making security as easy
a swipe of a finger. I'm hoping that
technologies like public-key cryptog
raphy will one day put passwords on
the chopping block.
Since Edward Snowden re
vealed the tip of the enormous ice
berg of NSA surveillance on both
the American people and govern
ments throughout the world, the
American public made has little ef
fort to prevent future surveillance.
Stanford students and Silicon Val
ley giants, heed my call: you are the
heroes this world needs, and the
ones it deserves. Now would be a
great time to create the secure in
frastructure this world needs for
the defense of freedom and privacy
everywhere.

The Sons of Liberty could not
have caused the American
Revolution if they could not
communicate privately.
Nowadays, secure communica
tion is more complicated than just
locking the doors and whispering.
With the advent of the World Wide
Web, the way people communicate
has fundamentally changed. Now,
communication happens not just
across the room but also across the
world.
I think that people ought to care
more about security, but the true
reason that most people shrug pri
vacy without a fight is not that they
don't care about it; it's that tools to
secure communication online are
not readily accessible to the gener
al, non-technical public.
It's just too much of a pain to se
cure your online activity, and it
shouldn't be that way.
If you have doubts on the impor
tance of information security, think
again. For one, the protection of
free speech depends on it; it is diffi
cult to be a political dissenter in a
strong surveillance state like China,
for instance.
While that opinion may border
too much on paranoia, it's also a
matter of protecting your personal
information from fraud and identity
theft. Many argue they have noth
ing to hide, but conveniently forget
that they do wish to hide their bank
account numbers, and don't want
the local cybei'-bully to read their
significant others' love letters.
The problem lies in the mecha
nisms for facilitating secure com
munication. On one level, some of

the technological approaches to se
curity are flawed because of the as
sumptions they rest on (that's an
other, nerdier discussion), but I
think most people fail to adopt secu
rity measures because the tools are
too plain difficult to use.
For instance, take email. Email
on its own is a fundamentally inse
cure protocol that is, it's not con
fidential, since you could intercept a
message as it is in transit; it doesn't
guarantee the sender or receiver
are who they claim they are; and
you can't necessarily even be sure
that what you receive is what the
sender actually sent, since someone
can intercept the message and
tamper with it.
There are two ways to deal with
this conundrum. For one, you could
just not use email (yeah, right). But
thankfully, there exists the Pretty
Good Privacy (PGP) program that
provides a suite of tools that allow
you to effectively secure all of the
above issues with email.
"That sounds great, Omar!" you
may exclaim, but using it is not triv
ial. First, you have to know about
PGP That already cuts out over
90% of all people in the United
States from even thinking about
having effective email security.
And even then, you have to in
stall a PGP implementation on your
computer and figure out how to use
it with your email client (if that's
even possible it's not if you use
the Gmail web interface, for in
stance). You then are confronted
with making and publishing public
and private keys, something that I
only learned about while doing my

computer science degree at Stan
ford.
My question is: why isn't there
just a "secure email" button? It's
not technologically infeasible; in
fact, every relevant tool already ex
ists. But neither Windows nor Mac
OSX come with the ability to com
municate securely preinstalled (the
Linux geeks like me can figure it
out ourselves), and almost none of
the popular email services like
Gmail or Yahoo provide this func
tionality out of the box.
I think that they all really should,
and this is just one example of many
things to be done to improve com
puter security. Companies seem to
be moving in this direction. The Ap
ple iPhone sS's fingerprint sensor
may have been thwarted already, but
it's a step in making security as easy
a swipe of a finger. I'm hoping that
technologies like public-key cryptog
raphy will one day put passwords on
the chopping block.
Since Edward Snowden re
vealed the tip of the enormous ice
berg of NSA surveillance on both
the American people and govern
ments throughout the world, the
American public made has little ef
fort to prevent future surveillance.
Stanford students and Silicon Val
ley giants, heed my call: you are the
heroes this world needs, and the
ones it deserves. Now would be a
great time to create the secure in
frastructure this world needs for
the defense of freedom and privacy
everywhere.
