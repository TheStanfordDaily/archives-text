## This season is about more than Oregon 
### Winston Shi 
Stanford football has looked
like a world beater in the
last two games, and Cardi
nal fans can take a breath.
After the customary wor
ries about a new team in a new season,
most people's anxiety has faded: we
are truly in the calm before the storm.
A calm before the storm requires,
of course, a storm, and the scheduling
gods have provided approximately the
10th "Game of the Century" of the
century The Oregon Ducks loom, just
as they have loomed for the past 10
months. As soon as last year's Stan
ford team won the Rose Bowl, the sto
ryline for the next season was already
clear: Oregon. Stanford and Oregon
will take the field on Nov. 7, and that
night in Stanford Stadium, the two
kings of the Pacific Coast will play a
one-game season.
As it turns out, there are other
teams on Stanford's schedule. The
Pac-12 is 29-4 out of conference, with
depth from top to bottom. In an age
when scheduling nonconference cup
cakes is commonplace, that's impres
sive. But even as a resurgent Pac-12
displays a depth it hasn't enjoyed in
years, the subtext of the conversation
is all Oregon. Not to disparage the
other teams on Stanford's schedule,
but the Cardinal is expected to beat
them all.
College football is not about the
teams you beat but about the teams
you don't lose to. Twice in the last sev
en years, Boise State has faced sched
ules against which at least half of all
major conference teams would go un
defeated, and they have been reward
ed with BCS bowls. They have typi
cally acquitted themselves in these
bowls, but that is not the point: To get
into contention, you have to play to not
lose. Why shouldn't SEC teams
schedule as many directional state
universities as they can?
The doctrine of playing to not lose
wilfully ignores the fact that schedul
ing matters. There is some truth to
that point; even among major confer
ences, teams go up and down. Sched
ules are set many years in advance.
When Oregon played Tennessee, peo
ple laughed about the Ducks schedul
ing poorly, but back when Oregon se
cured the matchup, who would have
ever thought that the mighty Vols
would have cratered as they have?
Did Notre Dame ever think that Stan
ford would become a power when it
scheduled a series with the Cardinal?
Consider, most of all, the rise and
fall of Lane Kiffin. As Pete Carroll's
ace coordinator, he rode the USC dy
nasty to national prominence; his fail
ure in Oakland took him to a re
spectable year in Tennessee, which he
left as ruined as he found it. Kiffin's
tenure at USC was dizzying in every
respect; after a return to national
prominence in just two years, he
coached the most embarrassing col
lapse in football history the season af
ter, and is now the first fire of 2013.
To someone like me who grew up
with USC on top of the world, its im
plosion is proof that truth is stranger
than fiction. Many smart people
would have considered Stanford and
Oregon being on top of the football
world an impossibility itself. But all of
these things happened. Teams go up
and down. That's the argument:
schedules vary so why should they
matter?
But it is a shame that, as it is, the
quality of Stanford's competition
seems irrelevant. The depth of the
Pac-12 is irrelevant. All that people fo
cus on is the one game that presents
Stanford's biggest chance to lose. And
while that's fair for all the talk
about the SEC's depth, the same
rules apply to LSU and Georgia as to
Stanford and Oregon I'm not too
sure it makes sense.
Depth matters. It's not easy to
navigate a tough slate of games, but
we don't reward tough schedules the
way they should. Even if you call Ore
gon a coin flip and assume that every
other team can only beat Stanford 10
percent of the time, Stanford only has
a 15.7 percent chance of running the
table. A more realistic list of chances
would be 5.3 percent. Pac-12 aside,
any BCS conference team making the
national championship game is an
achievement. Oregon has a better
chance than anyone of beating Stan
ford, but that's not to say that Oregon
is the only team that can beat Stan
ford.
Playing Washington matters
for heaven's sake, they beat Stanford
last season! Stanford-Oregon may
well be the defining game of the sea
son, but let's not get too hasty. The
Cardinal has other games to play first.

Remind Winston that UCLA is also
a big part of the Cardinal's stormy
schedule, which doesn't include any
cupcakes at ivshi9i@stanford.edu.

nasty to national prominence; his fail
ure in Oakland took him to a re
spectable year in Tennessee, which he
left as ruined as he found it. Kiffin's
tenure at USC was dizzying in every
respect; after a return to national
prominence in just two years, he
coached the most embarrassing col
lapse in football history the season af
ter, and is now the first fire of 2013.
To someone like me who grew up
with USC on top of the world, its im
plosion is proof that truth is stranger
than fiction. Many smart people
would have considered Stanford and
Oregon being on top of the football
world an impossibility itself. But all of
these things happened. Teams go up
and down. That's the argument:
schedules vary so why should they
matter?
But it is a shame that, as it is, the
quality of Stanford's competition
seems irrelevant. The depth of the
Pac-12 is irrelevant. All that people fo
cus on is the one game that presents
Stanford's biggest chance to lose. And
while that's fair for all the talk
about the SEC's depth, the same
rules apply to LSU and Georgia as to
Stanford and Oregon I'm not too
sure it makes sense.
Depth matters. It's not easy to
navigate a tough slate of games, but
we don't reward tough schedules the
way they should. Even if you call Ore
gon a coin flip and assume that every
other team can only beat Stanford 10
percent of the time, Stanford only has
a 15.7 percent chance of running the
table. A more realistic list of chances
would be 5.3 percent. Pac-12 aside,
any BCS conference team making the
national championship game is an
achievement. Oregon has a better
chance than anyone of beating Stan
ford, but that's not to say that Oregon
is the only team that can beat Stan
ford.
Playing Washington matters
for heaven's sake, they beat Stanford
last season! Stanford-Oregon may
well be the defining game of the sea
son, but let's not get too hasty. The
Cardinal has other games to play first.

Remind Winston that UCLA is also
a big part of the Cardinal's stormy
schedule, which doesn't include any
cupcakes at ivshi9i@stanford.edu.
Stanford football has looked
like a world beater in the
last two games, and Cardi
nal fans can take a breath.
After the customary wor
ries about a new team in a new season,
most people's anxiety has faded: we
are truly in the calm before the storm.
A calm before the storm requires,
of course, a storm, and the scheduling
gods have provided approximately the
10th "Game of the Century" of the
century The Oregon Ducks loom, just
as they have loomed for the past 10
months. As soon as last year's Stan
ford team won the Rose Bowl, the sto
ryline for the next season was already
clear: Oregon. Stanford and Oregon
will take the field on Nov. 7, and that
night in Stanford Stadium, the two
kings of the Pacific Coast will play a
one-game season.
As it turns out, there are other
teams on Stanford's schedule. The
Pac-12 is 29-4 out of conference, with
depth from top to bottom. In an age
when scheduling nonconference cup
cakes is commonplace, that's impres
sive. But even as a resurgent Pac-12
displays a depth it hasn't enjoyed in
years, the subtext of the conversation
is all Oregon. Not to disparage the
other teams on Stanford's schedule,
but the Cardinal is expected to beat
them all.
College football is not about the
teams you beat but about the teams
you don't lose to. Twice in the last sev
en years, Boise State has faced sched
ules against which at least half of all
major conference teams would go un
defeated, and they have been reward
ed with BCS bowls. They have typi
cally acquitted themselves in these
bowls, but that is not the point: To get
into contention, you have to play to not
lose. Why shouldn't SEC teams
schedule as many directional state
universities as they can?
The doctrine of playing to not lose
wilfully ignores the fact that schedul
ing matters. There is some truth to
that point; even among major confer
ences, teams go up and down. Sched
ules are set many years in advance.
When Oregon played Tennessee, peo
ple laughed about the Ducks schedul
ing poorly, but back when Oregon se
cured the matchup, who would have
ever thought that the mighty Vols
would have cratered as they have?
Did Notre Dame ever think that Stan
ford would become a power when it
scheduled a series with the Cardinal?
Consider, most of all, the rise and
fall of Lane Kiffin. As Pete Carroll's
ace coordinator, he rode the USC dy
nasty to national prominence; his fail
ure in Oakland took him to a re
spectable year in Tennessee, which he
left as ruined as he found it. Kiffin's
