# YANKEY'S RETURN A SPARK
## 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
A matchup that's been circled on Stanford fans'
calendars for over a year now looms even larger as
it approaches. This time, Stanford's matchup
against Washington will be a battle between two
top-ranked teams as Stanford enters at No. 5 and
Washington at No. 15.
"There's no wonder why they're nationally
ranked," Shaw said. "[They present] multiple
problems the nation's leading rusher, a quarter
back that's been great, the best tight end in the na
tion. Those are three huge problems for our de
fense."
Stanford has certainly been no stranger to
high-tempo offenses after facing several such units
in the Pac-12 and in nonconference play, but Shaw
doesn't believe that makes it any easier.
"It's never easier; they're all so different,"
Shaw elaborated. "We still have to approach them
from a scheme standpoint. Their scheme is differ
ent from Oregon's scheme, a little different from
Arizona's scheme, a little different from Arizona
State's scheme, so it's different.... They're such
different offenses that it's hard to carry a game
plan from one game to another."
Stanford will enter the matchup with restored
depth after playing at less than full strength last
weekend against Washington State. Senior corner
back Barry Browning is expected to return for
Saturday's game and senior left guard David
Yankey returned to practice on Monday.
"It was big because he's the captain," Shaw re
sponded when asked about Yankey's return to the
team. "When he's not there you miss him [as] that
vocal leader, to be that mainstay of our offensive
line."
Sophomore guard Joshua Garnett put togeth

era strong performance in place of Yankey against
Washington State last Saturday, helping Stanford
amass 560 yards of total offense, including 238 on
the ground. In addition, Garnett played back in
his home state of Washington. A native of
Puyallup, Wash., Garnett felt right at home on
the field.
"I felt good, I had some good blocks," Garnett
said. "I did well but I think I could have done bet
ter; there were some mistakes I made... but it
definitely felt good getting out there and trying to
play for David and fill that void he left."
The offensive line will be a major key to Stan
ford's success in the upcoming game against
Washington. Last year, Stanford only rushed for
68 yards, its lowest total of the season, and aver
aged only 2.4 yards per carry in a 17-13 loss at
Century Link Field. Those numbers will have to
improve for Stanford to be successful this week
end.
"We definitely can't take back last year's
loss," said Garnett. "We can just move forward;
we want to be 1-0 this weekend. But I think a lot
of the guys really remember and it really hits

close to home ... what happened last year and
how they moved us and we didn't move them. It
kind of hits us guys on the offensive line a little
harder because we want to be the guys who move
them. A lot of guys are definitely excited for this
game."
After the past weekend's diverse rushing per
formance, it's difficult to imagine anyone shutting
down Stanford's ground game. Six different play
ers registered two carries, including junior Re
mound Wright who rushed for 56 yards and a
touchdown on two carries and sophomore Barry
Sanders who added 34 yards and a touchdown on
three carries.
"I think it was good to see those guys do what
they do every day in practice," Garnett said. "I
think it was good for everyone to see that we have
four, five, even six running backs who can score
touchdowns in games."
Kickoff against Washington is scheduled for
7:30 p.m. this Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
