# TWO BIG HOME MEETS ON DECK
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
No. 4 Stanford women's swim
ming and diving (1-0, 0-0 Pac-12)
begins its defense of its confer
ence title today as it welcomes the
Washington State Cougars (0-0,
0-0) to Avery Aquatic Center for
its first conference dual meet of
the season.
After the Cardinal easily
cruised past San Jose State in its
season-opening meet last week,
138-100, it will look to continue a
strong start to the season against
a Cougar team that struggled to a
1-5 record in conference dual
meets last season, with an aver
age margin of defeat of a whop
ping 62 points.
In its victory against San Jose
State last Thursday afternoon,
Stanford received strong contri
butions from all across the board,
including from veteran seniors
Maya Di√üado and Felicia Lee and
some new faces freshmen Tara
Halsted and Lia Neal.
Stanford returns 24 players
for the 2013-14 season. Last year,
the Card finished eighth in the
NCAA championships it's 33rd
consecutive top-10 finish dating
back to 1981. This year's fresh
man class is expected bring in
new power to keep the Card in
the top 10 once again. Swim Swam
ranked Stanford's recruiting class
at No. 4.
Today's meet against the
Cougars will offer another oppor
tunity for head coach Greg Mee
han to continue to evaluate the
younger members of his team
against easier competition. He ex
pressed a desire to see improve
ment from the freshmen after last
week's meet, despite wins by Neal

and Halsted.
It will also be the last opportu
nity for the coaches to evaluate
their swimmers in a meet setting
until the end of October. Although
the dual meets generally provide
a less competitive atmosphere for
teams, this will be a significant
opportunity for the coaches to ex
amine the players against a Wash
ington State team getting its feet
wet in its first meet of the season.
Just one day later, the No. 7
Stanford men's swimming and
diving team will look to rebound
from a disappointing 2012-13 per
formance with its first meet of the
new season at home against UC-
Santa Cruz.
Last season, the Cardinal fin
ished seventh in the NCAA
Championships amidst higher ex
pectations. T\vo disqualifications
hindered the Card's success de
spite top finishes by junior diver
Kristian Ipsen and junior swim
mer David Nolan. Both are ex
pected to lead the team heading
into the 2013-14 season.
The Banana Slugs should not
offer significant competition to
the championship-hopeful Cardi
nal to open the season, as the
squad from Santa Cruz did not
finish ranked, even in the less
competitive Division 111 of colle
giate athletics.
With both the men's and
women's swimming and diving
teams ranked in the top 10 to
start the season, fans should ex
pect both teams to put on impres
sive showings, and the men espe
cially will be anxious to improve
at the NCAA championships at
the end of the season.
