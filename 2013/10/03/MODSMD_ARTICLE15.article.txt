# FARM FILLED
## Weekend filled with key sports contests 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
It seems that everyday is game
day on the Farm and this weekend
is no exception. It's an exciting and
important weekend for Stanford
sports, as the Farm will host key
Pac-12 matchups on the field, on
the court and in the pool. The Car
dinal has five teams ranked in the
top 25 in the nation, looking to help
Stanford earn its 20th consecutive
Director's Cup for the 2013-14
season.
The most talked about game of
the weekend is the Saturday
evening football matchup, where
No. 5 Stanford (4-0) will look to
take down No. 15 Washington. But
that won't be close to the first
game to take place.
The men's soccer team (5-1-1)
will kick off the weekend Thurs
day at 7 p.m. in its Pac-12 opener
against No. 3 Washington. The
team will look to extend its five
game win streak the longest
streak the program has held since
winning six in a row in September
2009 and take down the
Huskies with the dominant offense
and consistent defense it has
shown thus far. Pac-12 player of
the week, freshman forward Jor
dan Morris, will be the player to
watch; he scored both goals
against UC-Santa Barbara last
Friday. Men's soccer will then fin
ish up the weekend on Sunday at 3

p.m. against Oregon State.
No. 2 women's soccer has an
equally eventful weekend as it
challenges Arizona on Friday af
ternoon at 4 p.m. in its conference
home opener and then looks for
ward to Arizona State on Sunday
evening. After extending its Pac
-12 win streak to 43 on Saturday
evening in the Pac-12 opener
against Colorado, the four-time
defending Pac-12 champions will
look to continue the success shown
thus far. Freshman goalie Jane
Campbell was named Pac-12 de
fensive player of the week and will
seek to add another win to the
team's 8-0-1 record.
Also taking the field this week
end is the No. 11 Stanford field
hockey team, who, after a de
manding weekend on the East
Coast, will look to re-establish
dominance at home on Friday
evening against Pacific at 6 p.m.
The Cardinal will travel away from
the Farm to UC-Davis later in the
weekend for a Sunday matchup.
The Avery Aquatic Center will
see its first action this season from
the men's and women's swimming
and diving teams as well as the
men's water polo team, as both
kick-off their first home games of
the season.
It will be the first meet of the
season for No. 7 men's swimming
and diving as it attempts to bounce
