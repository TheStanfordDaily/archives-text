## Volleyball dismantles the Bruins in three sets 
### â€” Ashley Westhem 
No. 7 Stanford women's volley
ball beat the Bruins handily last
night in a three-set sweep (25-17,
25-15, 25-16). No. 16 UCLA was
hoping to get a win over the Card
after it spoiled the Bruins opening
game at the new Pauley Pavilion
last season, but Stanford never
gave them a chance.
Neither team led by more than
one point to start the first set,
with plenty of tie scores and lead
changes. However, Stanford went
on a 4-0 run to push the lead to 21-
16. Sophomore Jordan Burgess
led the team in kills with seven at
the end of the set.
During the second set, Stan
ford did a very good job of placing
the ball well with its attacks. All of
the momentum was with the Car
dinal as it hit .447, leading 13-10 at
a UCLA timeout. After they
weren't able to make adjustments
the first time around, the Bruins
called another timeout to make
more corrections, especially on

defense. Senior middle blocker
Carly Wopat responded right out
of the break with a kill, putting
her at nine kills on 11 attempts.
UCLA never got a point in the
rest of the set as the Card scored
four points consecutively to take
the second set 25-15. UCLA hit
only .149 to the Card's .475 attack
percentage. Hitting errors also
hurt the Bruins as they commit
ted 13 almost three times that
of Stanford.
UCLA kept the beginning of
the final set close until Stanford
went on a 4-0 run to lead 11-5.
UCLA would start to get close but
then Stanford would respond with
a powerful play and shut the Bru
ins down down. Both teams were
kept on their toes but Stanford
played comfortably with a 24-16
lead at match point. A kill by
Rachel Williams ended the match.
The seniors dominated the
match as Wopat finished with a
.667 hitting percentage and a game
high 13 kills to go with 6 blocks and
outside hitter Rachel Williams had
11 digs and seven kills.

Almost all of Stanford's fall athletic teams are in action on the Farm this weekend. The most anticipated
matchup of the weekend at Stanford is the Cardinal football squad's game against No. 15 Washington.
