# FOOTBALL'S SUMMER INTERNSHIPS
## CAREER PLAN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Many people reached out to Cardinal kicker Jordan
Williamson after his struggle in the 2012 Fiesta
Bowl. Some were teammates and fellow Stan
ford students, others were family members and
friends from high school. ;
One was a Fortune-500 CEO. Cisco Chairman of the Board
and CEO John Chambers, a college football fan, had seen
Williamson miss that potential game-winning kick in Phoenix.
But given the opportunity to meet Williamson, Chambers didn't
just want to reassure the then-sophomore. Chambers wanted to
hire him.
"[He] wanted to kind of meet up and talk about my situation...
and tell me how business is really, actually, pretty similar to
sports," Williamson said. "There's ups and downs in both realms, and
it's just how you bounce back and how you learn from your failures,
and come back and be stronger. And so he told me about some of the
challenges that he faced both at Cisco and growing up, and we just
kind of talked about how the two overlapped."
That conversation led to Williamson's internship at Cisco, where he
has worked in sales and marketing for the last two summers.
Williamson lived a busier life than most of his fellow interns, waking
up for voluntary 6:30 a.m. team workouts before leaving for Cisco's
San Jose headquarters around 9 a.m. But for a Stanford football
player, that's just a typical summer day.
Williamson is one of the 70 to 80 Cardinal players who
are employed every summer, working in fields from re
al estate and finance to medicine and biotech. In the
six weeks between the end of spring quarter and
the start of fall training camp, the players wit
ness everything from boardroom deals to
open-heart surgeries.
