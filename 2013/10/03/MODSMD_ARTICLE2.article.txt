# FOOTBALL'S SUMMER INTERNSHIPS
## CAREER PLAN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Many people reached out to Cardinal kicker Jordan
Williamson after his struggle in the 2012 Fiesta
Bowl. Some were teammates and fellow Stan
ford students, others were family members and
friends from high school. ;
One was a Fortune-500 CEO. Cisco Chairman of the Board
and CEO John Chambers, a college football fan, had seen
Williamson miss that potential game-winning kick in Phoenix.
But given the opportunity to meet Williamson, Chambers didn't
just want to reassure the then-sophomore. Chambers wanted to
hire him.
"[He] wanted to kind of meet up and talk about my situation...
and tell me how business is really, actually, pretty similar to
sports," Williamson said. "There's ups and downs in both realms, and
it's just how you bounce back and how you learn from your failures,
and come back and be stronger. And so he told me about some of the
challenges that he faced both at Cisco and growing up, and we just
kind of talked about how the two overlapped."
That conversation led to Williamson's internship at Cisco, where he
has worked in sales and marketing for the last two summers.
Williamson lived a busier life than most of his fellow interns, waking
up for voluntary 6:30 a.m. team workouts before leaving for Cisco's
San Jose headquarters around 9 a.m. But for a Stanford football
player, that's just a typical summer day.
Williamson is one of the 70 to 80 Cardinal players who
are employed every summer, working in fields from re
al estate and finance to medicine and biotech. In the
six weeks between the end of spring quarter and
the start of fall training camp, the players wit
ness everything from boardroom deals to
open-heart surgeries.

That's a far cry from most other
college football teams, nearly all of
which use the summer as an oppor
tunity for their players to catch up
academically; the Cardinal's direc
tor of football operations, Matt
Doyle, claims that very few teams
enroll fewer than 90 percent of their
players in summer school. Though
Stanford allows its players to take
summer classes, Doyle said, only a
handful of Cardinal football players
have the need, and it's usually due to
course scheduling reasons, not aca
demic issues. Still, that doesn't mean
the program is going to let the sum
mer go to waste.
"We've taken something that
might be perceived outside of this
community as a disadvantage, and
turned it into an advantage," Doyle
said. "We want our guys working.
We want them resumes built up to a
point that, when they graduate,
they've got as good of a resume as
any college graduate in the country."
It all starts with Doyle, who
spends much of his time as the play
ers' de-facto headhunter. He coordi
nates the team's 12th Man Summer
Jobs Program, which connects inter
ested employers specifically with
Cardinal football players.
In return for their work, the play
ers receive the money that many of
them need to stay near campus for
those voluntary summer workouts.
The concept isn't new, but the job de
scriptions have changed dramatical
ly, especially over the past five or six
years.
"You hear stories from some of
the older players in the '6os and '7os
talking about, 'When I went to Stan
ford, I spent my summers lining the
fields at Palo Alto High School,"'
Doyle said. "Just doing stuff like that
that paid, gave them some money in
their pocket. But nowadays, we've
got dozens of guys working in fi
nance, in law, in tech, in startups, en
gineering firms."
"There may be a startup compa
ny that just wants a hardworking,
dedicated person that knows how to
work in a dynamic team environ
ment," he added. "Well, that's a
Stanford football player who's ma
joring in engineering."
The summer jobs program is le
gal under NCAA rules, assuming
that a few conditions Doyle spells
these out clearly to employers are
met. A player can't be compensated
unless he actually does work, can't
be paid more than his position is
worth and can't receive benefits that
other interns do not. The player has
to go through interviews like any
other candidate and, of course, he
must actually be qualified for the job.
Few players can draw a line be
tween football and their summer in
ternship as clearly as Williamson

can, but just about all of them can
thank the program to some degree.
Once the football season is over,
Doyle builds profiles of most of the
players on the team, meeting with
them to gauge their individual inter
ests. He also works with them on
their resumes, cover letters and in
terview skills most members of
the team even have Linkedln pages
making up for the training that
many players miss out on during the
fall career fair rush, which overlaps
with football season.
When it comes to actually pairing
the players with a summer job,
Doyle's involvement varies. For
some players, all Doyle has to do is
communicate the compliance and
timing considerations to their re
spective employers.
Take Stanford starting punter
Ben Rhyne, a senior biomechanical
engineering major, who approached
one of his professors last year about
working in the on-campus human
performance lab. He ended up doing
research there last summer, using
EMG, 3D motion capture and other
technology to model the movement
of test subjects wearing heavy back
packs over long periods of time.
"[Before the summer,] I felt like I
was a biomechanical engineer,"
Rhyne said, "but I didn't know what
biomechanical engineers did."
In other cases, a little push from
Doyle is needed to set things in mo
tion. Early in his career, senior run
ning back Anthony Wilkerson found
a summer position at Morgan Stan
ley with Doyle's help. While there,
Wilkerson made a connection that
led to a position he earned on his
own, an internship this summer at
SHOOTMedia, a media consulting
firm that specializes in sports.
"It's setting us up for life," Wilk
erson said of the summer jobs pro
gram. "We're not going to be playing
this game for the rest of our lives,
and we have a life after football."
Oftentimes, Doyle is more in
volved in the process than the play
ers even realize. When he was a
freshman, senior center Conor Mc-
Fadden set up a meeting with Jesse

Rogers '79, the co-founder of the
prominent Palo Alto firm Altamont
Capital, to talk about private equity.
"When I got in, I was actually
met by a couple of the vice presidents,
who kind of grilled me on just random
things," McFadden remembered.
"And I didn't know a single answer. I
just tried to keep a smile on my face,
and just 20 minutes later, I'm sitting
there, I'm like, 'Wow, I'm the dumbest
person ever.' But Mr. Rogers came in
and said, 'Hey, would you like to work
here this summer? People seem to en
joy being around you.'"
McFadden took the job, and went
to go tell Doyle the news.
"I'm like, 'Hey, this was a great
experience," 1 McFadden said. "[Doyle]
goes, 'Yeah, I talked to Jeff actually
yesterday before you went in there,
and I told him that you should look at
this kid a little harder.'"
As with many of the employers in
The 12th Man Summer Jobs Pro
gram, the Cardinal network runs
deep at Altamont. Rogers serves on
the board of Stanford University's
DAPER (Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation)
Investment Fund, and has hired sev
eral Cardinal football players over
the years. Senior linebacker Blake
Lueders also worked as an intern at
Altamont last summer, which was
McFadden's third year with the com
pany, and one of McFadden's direct
superiors was Chase Beeler 'lO M.A.
'll, his former Stanford teammate
and fellow center.
The list of connections goes on.
Another of McFadden's former men
tors on the offensive line, James
McGillicuddy 'O9 M.A. 'll, worked
for two summers at investment
banking firm Think Equity and two
more at a different firm founded by
Rogers, Golden Gate Capital, while
part of the team.

"Because of my experience in fi
nance working at Golden Gate Capi
tal for two summers and Think -
quity for two summers, I had a plat
form to speak somewhat intelligent
ly and articulately [when I entered
the workforce]," McGillicuddy said.
"The exposure was unreal, to be hon
est with you. But then also them be
ing cognizant about, 'Hey, in the af
ternoon I have to go train for foot
ball.' ... [l]t was incredible."
While many players' non-football
careers take flight in the 12th Man
Program, it was actually McGillicud
dy's playing ability that got a big
boost at Think Equity. McGillicuddy
missed the first three years of his
football career due to various in
juries, including a lingering knee is
sue that threatened to keep him off
the field through the end of college.
But at Think Equity, McGillicuddy
worked with former All-Pro quarter
back Steve Bono, who had himself
struggled with injury after retire
ment. Bono recommended the treat
ment that had healed his own
Achilles tendon. McGillicuddy had
the very same procedure done on his
knee and he saw the first game ac
tion of his career that following sea
son.
The Cardinal didn't just get three
good years out of McGillicuddy after
that internship; it also planted the
seeds for the continued growth of the
summer jobs program. At
McGillicuddy's urging, the execu
tives at RelatelQ, the startup where
he now works, hired former Stan
ford walk-on Andrew Stutz 'l3 as an
intern last summer. Stutz is no
longer on the team, but he still works
at RelatelQ part-time while pursu
ing a Master's degree at Stanford.
Even if the employer's affiliation
is not that direct, many participants
in the program have worked with a

Stanford football intern in the past,
were impressed by his performance
and have become interested in hiring
another Cardinal player as a result.
According to Doyle, employers
sometimes even ask an intern to rec
ommend a Cardinal teammate. And
so the network grows, year after
year.
The team's pipeline of summer
jobs, as Doyle put it, takes many dif
ferent forms. Internships can result
from positive encounters with pro
fessors, alumni's attempts to give
back and, in one case, missed field
goals. But the common thread is that
Stanford football players are pre
sented with unique opportunities off
the football field, and that their sup
port staff chief among them,
Doyle —is going to ensure they
make the most of those chances.
"Coach [David Shaw] has often
said, 'Get everything you can out of
Stanford. Wring it dry,"' Doyle said.
'"Be a sponge. Take advantage of
what the campus offers, what your
colleagues offer, what your fellow
students offer, what the Stanford
name offers.'"
Many of those who Doyle assists
know what field they're looking to
work in; all he has to do is pull up a
list of the employers who have
reached out to him and talk to them
to find the best fit for the player's
skillset. But 75 percent of the time, by
Doyle's estimation, his interaction with
a player takes a different form
one that is even more valuable.
"[Sometimes] the guy walks in
smart guy, intelligent, hard-work
ing— [and] has no idea what he
wants to do," Doyle said. "And he
ends up working for a company that
ends up changing his life."
