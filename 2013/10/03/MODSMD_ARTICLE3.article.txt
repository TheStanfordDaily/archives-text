# STUDENT GROUPS
## Students address mental health issues Stanford Peace of Mind hosts community event to promote open dialogue on happiness 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
On Oct. 1, Stanford Peace of Mind (SPoM) hosted
Let's Talk, an open discussion on mental health and the
campus attitude towards happiness, where students
were able to brainstorm potential ideas to help make
Stanford a better experience for all.
Nikita Desai 'l5, co-president of SPoM, said that the

goal of the group and these discussions is to help start
and maintain conversations about mental health and
happiness on campus.
"Universities are finally accepting that these are is
sues that have to be dealt with," Desai said. "Only stu
dents who are both academically strong as well as stu
dents who have good physical and mental health are re
ally going to be able to succeed."
A recent 2012-13 school year crime review reported
that the number of 911 calls for mental health concerns
on campus have been on the rise in the last three years,
with 27 calls in 2010-11 and 67 in
2012-13.
Desai explained that while the
spikes in these phone calls are diffi
cult to rationalize, several plausible
explanations include people become
more comfortable calling if they're
suffering or if their friends are suf
fering, or the police changing them
guidelines for what constitutes a
mental health-related call.
"Without looking deeper into the
issue, it's nearly impossible to tell
the real reason behind it," Desai
said.
Regardless of what contributed
to the rising trend of these 911 calls,
SPoM hopes to continue engaging
community members in open discus
sions on mental health issues.
According to Desai, SPoM had a
smaller presence on campus two
years ago, after many of its leader
ship team graduated. However,
Desai and others restored the stu
dent group last year in order to in
crease its reach and encourage the
discussion on campus about mental
health issues that many students
deal with.
One of the biggest programs the
group put together last year was a
series of panels held in various
dorms on campus in which three or
four students shared their stories
about dealing with mental health.
"The panels are meant to be an
informal thing," Desai said. "They
are for anyone who wants to feel like
they can voice their concern about
the campus climate and how we
should address those issues."
Analyssa Lopez 'l6, a member of
SPoM, said that while hosting these

panels in freshman dorms proved to
be a success in terms of audience
turnout, it is more difficult to break
into other areas of campus including
sororities and ethnic communities.
"If our goal is to reach Stanford's
campus in general, then one of our
focuses should be more panels tar
geted towards different audiences,"
Lopez said.
At the open community discus
sion this week, one of the talking
points revolved around the campus
attitude towards dealing with un
happiness, something Madeleine
Gill 'l5 - financial officer for SPoM -
considers to be a prevalent issue
among peers.
"It's impossible not to feel inade
quate here, when everyone around
you is really smart," she said. "When

you're at Stanford, you forget how
awesome you are."
Gill added that there is a campus
wide level of discomfort when it
comes to opening up about one's
problems.
"People here know that other
people have problems, but no one's
open about it, so they aren't able to
help themselves," she said.
The group went on to discuss po
tential plans for the year, including a
flyer campaign with statistics on the
number of Stanford students who
have dealt with mental health issues.
"The main thing is that people
want to know they're not alone," Gill
said.
Desai said that SPoM plans to in
crease its presence on campus this
year.

"We're hoping to collaborate with
other groups and let students know
that there are resources and places
for them to get help," Desai said.
Gill discussed the importance of
reaching out to other communities
on campus, such as the LGBTQ
community or ethnic groups on cam
pus, in order to spread the conversa
tion where needed.
"Those are spaces where stu
dents already feel comfortable," she
said. "We could weasel our way in,
and show how your mental health
is an aspect of your life that can tie
into other parts. We could make
them feel like it's part of their com
munity."
