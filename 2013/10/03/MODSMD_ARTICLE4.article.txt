## Homeless push back on PA vehicular living ban 
### SAMANTHA NEUBER 
Palo Alto City Council passed a
highly debated and controversial
ordinance in early August banning
the act of living in a vehicle

within the city.
. Liz Kniss, chair
woman of the City

Council's Policy and Servic
es Committee, said that vehicu
lar habitation in Palo Alto has been
happening for over 15 years, with
residents consistently citing in
stances of people living in their vehi
cles around the Cubberley Commu
nity Center.
According to Kniss, it has be
come easier for people to "park
[their] vehicles there and hook up to
the electricity" at the former site of
Cubberley High School.
Those interviewed for this arti
cle estimated that up to 30-50 peo
ple may be living in their cars in the
Cubberley area at any given time.
While the ordinance which is
accompanied by a six-month grace
period allowing current vehicle

dwellers time to seek alternatives
primarily bans living in one's car,
it also directly impacts the opera
tions at Cubberley. The center's
showers have been eliminated, the
Wi-Fi is disabled after 10 p.m. and
the electricity may be turned off in
the future as part of the ban.
The ordinance, originally pro
posed two years ago but ultimately
shelved in favor of alternative pro
grams, stems from complaints from
surrounding residential communi
ties.
Incidents involving littering, uri
nation and defecation have been re
ported in the area surrounding
Cubberley. Kniss explained that one
of the ban's selling points was that
residents' children find the area in
timidating and feel uncomfortable
walking through it.
While many community mem
bers fully support the ordinance,
there are a number of those who
find it mean-spirited.
"The idea of taking away shelter
proposal two years ago, and
has spurred the formation of
several local opposition
groups such as the Stop the
Ban group and the Commu
nity Cooperation Team.
Aparna Ananthasubrama
niam 'l3, M.S.'l4, is part of
both aforementioned groups.
Ananthasubramaniam first
became involved with housing
issues when she joined Night
Outreach, a Stanford student
group which takes walks in
Palo Alto on Fridays and en
gages in dialogue with home
less people.
Ananthasubramaniam, in
collaboration with another

Stanford student, formed the
Community Cooperation
Team two years ago when the
ban first came up for debate.
The group sought to oppose
the ban and to brainstorm al
ternatives that would "make
people who live in homes in
Palo Alto feel safe, but would
also allow people who sleep in
then cars to keep some of the
options they have."
Although it has been diffi
cult for Stanford students in
terested in this issue to pro
mote on-campus awareness
due to the conflict arising
over the summer, Anantha
subramaniam plans to speak

with several student groups
this year to gauge if they are
interested in supporting a
movement against the ban.
While the ban's support
ers and opponents each feel
strongly for their case, both
Ananthasubramaniam and
Jagoda agree that there has
not been as much discussion
between the two groups as
there could be, and that in
creased communication be
tween both sides in the com
munity may be advantageous
in finding a middle ground.
