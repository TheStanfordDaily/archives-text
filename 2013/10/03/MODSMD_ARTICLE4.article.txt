## Homeless push back on PA vehicular living ban 
### SAMANTHA NEUBER 
Palo Alto City Council passed a
highly debated and controversial
ordinance in early August banning
the act of living in a vehicle

within the city.
. Liz Kniss, chair

Wi-Fi is disabled after 10 p.m. and

residents' children find the area in
