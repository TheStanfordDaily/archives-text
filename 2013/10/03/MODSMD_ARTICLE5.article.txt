# STUDENT LIFE
## Oak Creek offers unique experiences, challenges 
### BAKER TILNEY DESK EDITOR 
For students living in Oak
Creek, life is unlike anywhere else
at Stanford.
The undergraduate community
placed into the Oak Creek Apart
ments complex has grown every
year since it was first used for stu
dent housing in 2009; this fall, there
are 120 students living there, with
that number expected to more than
double in winter quarter to 250 as
students return from studying
abroad.
Edith Wu-Nguyen, who, along
with her husband John serve as the
residential fellows at Oak Creek,
describes the experience of living at
Oak Creek as very different from
that of other housing arrangements.
"I always say [Oak Creek] is a
really great place to live, and a real
ly hard place to live as a Stanford
student for lots of reasons... Stan
ford is such a residentially based
campus," Wu-Nguyen said.
Because Oak Creek is off-cam
pus and a significant walk or bike
ride from central campus buildings,
living at the complex complicates

daily routines ranging from dining
to bringing books to class.
"Oak Creekers sometimes get
stressed," Wu-Nguyen said. "They
have to think, 'Okay, what do I need
for today? I have to carry all that on
my back, bring all that to school.'"
Hector Santa Cruz 'l5, who is
living in Oak Creek for the first time
this quarter, works his schedule
around the long transit time.
"It's a 10 to 15 minute bike ride,
so instead of coming back between
classes or during the day, I'll hang
out at Tresidder and read or some
thing," Santa Cruz said.
Since 2009, Wu-Nguyen and
Housing have worked to provide
more accessible transportation for
Oak Creek residents.
A Marguerite shuttle service
added last winter quarter has
proven very popular and useful for
night transportation to and from
Oak Creek. In addition, 5-SURE,
the free security escort service, now
offers rides to the apartments,
made possible when it began using
street-legal cars. For transport dur
ing the day, there are two other
