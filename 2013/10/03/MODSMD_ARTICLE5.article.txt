# STUDENT LIFE
## Oak Creek offers unique experiences, challenges 
### BAKER TILNEY DESK EDITOR 
For students living in Oak
Creek, life is unlike anywhere else
at Stanford.
The undergraduate community
placed into the Oak Creek Apart
ments complex has grown every
year since it was first used for stu
dent housing in 2009; this fall, there
are 120 students living there, with
that number expected to more than
double in winter quarter to 250 as
students return from studying
abroad.
Edith Wu-Nguyen, who, along
with her husband John serve as the
residential fellows at Oak Creek,
describes the experience of living at
Oak Creek as very different from
that of other housing arrangements.
"I always say [Oak Creek] is a
really great place to live, and a real
ly hard place to live as a Stanford
student for lots of reasons... Stan
ford is such a residentially based
campus," Wu-Nguyen said.
Because Oak Creek is off-cam
pus and a significant walk or bike
ride from central campus buildings,
living at the complex complicates

daily routines ranging from dining
to bringing books to class.
"Oak Creekers sometimes get
stressed," Wu-Nguyen said. "They
have to think, 'Okay, what do I need
for today? I have to carry all that on
my back, bring all that to school.'"
Hector Santa Cruz 'l5, who is
living in Oak Creek for the first time
this quarter, works his schedule
around the long transit time.
"It's a 10 to 15 minute bike ride,
so instead of coming back between
classes or during the day, I'll hang
out at Tresidder and read or some
thing," Santa Cruz said.
Since 2009, Wu-Nguyen and
Housing have worked to provide
more accessible transportation for
Oak Creek residents.
A Marguerite shuttle service
added last winter quarter has
proven very popular and useful for
night transportation to and from
Oak Creek. In addition, 5-SURE,
the free security escort service, now
offers rides to the apartments,
made possible when it began using
street-legal cars. For transport dur
ing the day, there are two other
Marguerite lines that stop at
the apartments.
Beyond the distance from
campus, another downside of
living in housing inhabited
by non-Stanford residents is
the lack of a sense of commu
nity. Of the buildings' 700
apartments, Stanford leases
around 150, and residents of
ten do not know if their
neighbor or a person in the
hallway is a student or an
outside resident.
"It feels like it's the sum
mer because I cook meals,
and instead of going to work
I go to school and come
back," Santa Cruz said. "It's
more like real life than living
in a dorm."
Exacerbating this prob
lem is the fact that, with a
few exceptions, Stanford un
dergraduates in Oak Creek
are all upperclassmen in
volved with other communi
ties and responsibilities.
"We can have planned
programs, but a lot of people
don't come because they
have classes, they have work
and they have other commit
ments," Wu-Nguyen said.
Relations between Stan
ford students and non-Stan
ford residents vary, but Wu-
Nguyen and the Residential
Assistants work to ensure
that all residents are treated
equally and abide by com
munity rules. That said, a re

cent increase from room
mate pairs to three-person
groups led to an increase in
room complaints.
"The walls are really
thin," Santa Cruz. "We got a
noise complaint at 11 p.m.
for playing music on a com
puter."
On the one hand, Oak
Creek apartments are larg
er than dorm rooms, with
two-bedroom apartments
featuring a living room, a
kitchen and a dining area.
However, complex includes a
swimming pool, a hot tub,
tennis courts and other
amenities, to which most un
dergraduates do not have ac
cess.
"Oak Creek is cool be
cause it's an apartment, but I
don't feel like I'm at Stanford
when I'm here," said Alex
Glaze 'l5, another first-time
residence of the complex.
Larger freshman classes
in recent years are primary
drivers for the growing un
dergraduate community in
Oak Creek, as Stanford
owned dormitories become
filled and students are left
unassigned.
According to Wu-
Nguyen, future construction
in Lagunita Court and Man
zanita should provide enough
housing to substantially de
crease the number of leased
units in Oak Creek, bringing
more students back on cam
pus within the next few
years.

from people who don't have
regular housing is mean,
draconian, counter-produc
tive â€” not what anybody is
brought up to do," said
Chuck Jagoda, a 70-year-old
Palo Alto resident camping in
his vehicle.
Jagoda and others feel
that homelessness is essen
tially the product of a lack of
resources, and that taking
those very resources away
such as those previously pro
vided by Cubberley is not
a valid solution.
"If you're concerned for
sanitation, why close bath
rooms?" Jagoda asked.
Jagoda also argued that
many vehicle dwellers
women in particular feel
safer sleeping in their locked
cars at night than they do
sleeping in a shelter. To take
away the ability to live in one's
vehicle is also to take away a
certain sense of security, he
added.
Additionally, although
Jagoda plans to take advan
tage of several alternative
programs and senior housing,
many people do not want al
ternative housing because
their vehicles have become a
comfortable space for them,
according to Kniss.
"I think it's very bad for
Palo Alto's legacy," Jagoda
said. "It is not in keeping with
the traditions of Palo Alto ...
or with an attitude of concern
for people less fortunate."

divisive even since its first
