## GSB will launch first MOOC on finance later this month 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Starting Oct. 14, the Stanford
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
will launch its first massive open online
course (MOOC) called The Finance of
Retirement and Pensions.
The free public course, to be taught
by professor of finance Joshua Rauh,
is part of the GSB's overall strategy to
use technology to enhance the teach
ing and learning experience on cam
pus, as well as have a larger global im
pact.
"We definitely view this inaugural
MOOC as a testing ground for us, and
so wanted to push the boundaries of
what a MOOC could do by enriching
the ways in which participants can en
gage with one another and with faculty
member Joshua Rauh," said Garth Sa
loner, dean of the GSB, in an email
statement to The Daily.
The GSB has previously imple
mented its technology-driven plan in
its use of the flipped classroom model,
where students are expected to learn
basic material outside of class time and
then practice and apply their knowl
edge in the classroom.

Students in the new eight-week on
line course will "learn the financial
concepts behind sound retirement plan
investment and pension fund manage
ment," according to the class website.
"If you're in the workforce now and
you're thinking that you need a long
term financial plan for retirement,
then the tools in this course are going
to be really useful for you," Rauh said
in the introductory course video.
Rauh's class expects its students to
spend between four to six hours a
week on the course and will present
statements of accomplishments when
students perform satisfactorily and
upon completion of the course.
In January, the class will culminate
in an interactive symposium about the
challenges of the U.S. pension system
featuring MOOC students presenting
ideas for pension reform to a panel of
distinguished faculty and experts. The
expenses for this symposium will be
covered by the GSB in collaboration
with the Hoover Institution.
The MOOC will be hosted on the
NovoEd online learning platform. The
course's design execution was done
