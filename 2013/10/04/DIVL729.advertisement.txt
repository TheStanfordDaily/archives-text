Earth Matters: "Fracking"—
The Blue Bridge to a Green Future?
Monday, October 7
7:30 pm
Cubberley Auditorium
School of Education
Stanford University
Free and open to the public
"Fracking"—shorthand for obtaining natural gas through hydraulic
fracturing—has become one of the most widely recognized and
emotionally charged words in our contemporary energy lexicon.
Thanks to abundant supplies, relatively low prices, and clean-burning
properties compared to coal, shale gas is booming in the worldwide
market. But concerns about the environmental impacts of extraction,
including the potential for contamination of fresh water aquifers, are
rallying communities to advocate government accountability, and
resulting in some outright bans.
Stanford Geophysics Professor Mark Zoback is a leading
international expert on this lightning rod issue, working closely with
governments including the US, Canada, and China to address safe
extraction. In this special event, Zoback will provide a real-world
view of the global energy landscape and will discuss the role that
shale gas can play in a clean-energy future.
