# SPORTS Pac-12 North battle
## Upstart Huskies look to supplant Card at top tier of conference 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
It's been 372 days since Stanford lost
to a Pac-12 team. Last year the Cardinal
converted two make-or-break fourth
downs to edge past Arizona, took down a
resilient UCLA team twice in the span of
six days and put on an epic defensive per
formance to take down mighty Oregon in
Autzen Stadium. Stanford defeated every
Pac-12 opponent it faced, regardless of
whether the game was an offensive
shootout or a defensive slugfest.
But the one team that the Cardinal
couldn't beat was the Washington
Huskies.

Tomorrow, No. 5 Stanford (4-0, 2-0
Pac-12) seeks redemption when it hosts
No. 15 Washington (4-0, 1-0), and though
the Cardinal players have avoided using
the word "revenge" throughout the
week, there is no doubt that last year's
loss to the Huskies left a bitter taste in
their mouths.

That feeling of disappointment still
resonates with junior wide receiver Ty
Montgomery, who dropped what would
have been the go-ahead touchdown with
less than three minutes to go in last year's

game against the Huskies. The ball was
one of the few well-thrown passes by
quarterback Josh Nunes 'l3 on that
Thursday night, but it went right through
the receiver's hands.

"I feel like I didn't do my part and let
everybody down," Montgomery said. "I
don't remember the plays, I choose not
to. I just remember how I felt, and I don't
want to feel that again."
In less than two years, defensive co
ordinator Justin Wilcox has managed to
transform a sloppy Huskies defense that
gave up 35.9 points and 284.6 passing
yards per game in 2011 into a fearsome
unit that so far has allowed just 10.8
points and 156.8 passing yards per game
two statistics both currently ranked in
the nation's top 10. Even with the loss of

GAME NOTES: Stanford takes on its second

Saturday night. The Huskies were one of two
teams to beat the Cardinal last season, top

Saturday night's game joins No. 2 Oregon in
the driver's seat of the Pac-12 title race.

Junior wide reciever Ty Montgomery (above) looks to improve upon his struggles from
last season's matchup against Washington this Saturday. Montgomery had a key drop
that could have given Stanford a late lead and perhaps the victory, but the Cardinal
eventually fell 17-13. Through four games, 2013 looks to be Montgomery's best season.
its star cornerback Desmond Tru
fant to the NFL, Washington's sec
ondary has not missed a beat, al
lowing just one touchdown
through the air while picking off
six passes.

Though the Fluskies defense
did not allow Stanford to score an
offensive touchdown in their last
meeting, the Cardinal offense has
developed a new downfield aerial
threat that was glaringly absent a
year ago at Century Link Field. The
speed and physicality of Mont
gomery and junior wideout Devon
Cajusteâ€”who hauled in four
catches for 115 yards for two
touchdowns in last weekend's
blowout win against Washington
State should prove to be espe
cially important if the Fluskies key
in on stopping the run.
"We have to show we'll go
downtown if it's there for our [re
ceivers]," said head coach David
Shaw. "That's got to be part of
who we are."

Tomorrow's matchup will fea
ture the two most efficient passers
in the Pac-12. Cardinal junior quar
terback Kevin Hogan leads the
conference in efficiency with a
174.6 rating and 9.56 yards per
pass attempt, while Huskies signal
caller Keith Price isn't far behind
with a 173.6 rating and 72.3 com
pletion percentage. After a sensa
tional 33-touchdown 2011 cam
paign, Price failed to meet expecta
tions last year behind an injury-rid
dled offensive line.

"[Price] looks like a healthy
quarterback, like he did two years
ago," Shaw said. "He looks like a
quarterback who has a healthy of
fensive line in front of him. He's
playing with a lot of confidence.
He's playing like that guy who
burst on the scene two years ago
when everybody in the conference
took notice of him."

Price has plenty of weapons
surrounding him on offense, in
cluding workhorse running back
Bishop Sankey, preseason Ail-
American tight end Austin Sefer
ian-Jenkins and shifty wide receiv
er Kasen Williams. One of the
most underrated halfbacks in the
country, Sankey broke a school
record last weekend when he car
ried the ball 40 times against Ari
zona. And while Seferian-Jenkins
has yet to have a breakout game in
2013, the Cardinal defense is all
too familiar with Williams' play
making ability; after all, it was
Williams who scored the game
winning touchdown on a screen
thanks to a missed tackle at the
line of scrimmage against Stan
ford last season.

"[Williams] is a big receiver.
He's strong, he's fast, and I know
we have to prepare for him," said
sophomore Alex Carter, who has
been playing lights-out in pass cov
erage as well as setting a hard edge
against the run. "[Defensive coor
dinator Derek] Mason always says,
'Pursue the ball.' A good tackling
team is a team that can get all hats
to the ball, so if we can just do
that, we can stop the big play from
happening. That's the biggest
thing."

Even if tomorrow isn't a re
venge game for Stanford, it will
certainly showcase two undefeat
ed Pac-12 North teams looking to
keep their conference title hopes
alive.

"It's going to be a battle,"
Shaw said.

Tomorrow's Pac-12 North
showdown will kickoff at 10:30
p.m., with national television cov
erage on ESPN.
