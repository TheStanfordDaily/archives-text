# SPORTS Pac-12 North battle
## Upstart Huskies look to supplant Card at top tier of conference 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
It's been 372 days since Stanford lost
to a Pac-12 team. Last year the Cardinal
converted two make-or-break fourth
downs to edge past Arizona, took down a
resilient UCLA team twice in the span of
six days and put on an epic defensive per
formance to take down mighty Oregon in
Autzen Stadium. Stanford defeated every
Pac-12 opponent it faced, regardless of
whether the game was an offensive
shootout or a defensive slugfest.
But the one team that the Cardinal
couldn't beat was the Washington
Huskies.

Tomorrow, No. 5 Stanford (4-0, 2-0
Pac-12) seeks redemption when it hosts
No. 15 Washington (4-0, 1-0), and though
the Cardinal players have avoided using
the word "revenge" throughout the
week, there is no doubt that last year's
loss to the Huskies left a bitter taste in
their mouths.

That feeling of disappointment still
resonates with junior wide receiver Ty
Montgomery, who dropped what would
have been the go-ahead touchdown with
less than three minutes to go in last year's

game against the Huskies. The ball was
one of the few well-thrown passes by
quarterback Josh Nunes 'l3 on that
Thursday night, but it went right through
the receiver's hands.

"I feel like I didn't do my part and let
everybody down," Montgomery said. "I
don't remember the plays, I choose not
to. I just remember how I felt, and I don't
want to feel that again."
In less than two years, defensive co
ordinator Justin Wilcox has managed to
transform a sloppy Huskies defense that
gave up 35.9 points and 284.6 passing
yards per game in 2011 into a fearsome
unit that so far has allowed just 10.8
points and 156.8 passing yards per game
two statistics both currently ranked in
the nation's top 10. Even with the loss of

GAME NOTES: Stanford takes on its second
ranked opponent of the season at Stanford
Stadium with its matchup against Washington
Saturday night. The Huskies were one of two
teams to beat the Cardinal last season, top
ping Stanford 17-13 in Seattle. The winner of
Saturday night's game joins No. 2 Oregon in
the driver's seat of the Pac-12 title race.

Junior wide reciever Ty Montgomery (above) looks to improve upon his struggles from
last season's matchup against Washington this Saturday. Montgomery had a key drop
that could have given Stanford a late lead and perhaps the victory, but the Cardinal
eventually fell 17-13. Through four games, 2013 looks to be Montgomery's best season.
