SAM FISHER
STANFORD 38, WASHINGTON 20: Just
like the Arizona State game two weeks ago, this is
the type of game that Stanford seems to always
win, and win convincingly. However, Washington is
a better team than Arizona State. Quarterback Keith
Price leads a potent Huskies offense, and Justin
Wilcox has completely turned around the Washing
ton defense. This team is good enough to beat
Stanford if the Cardinal slips up. I don't see that
happening. With the exception of a weird fourth
quarter against ASU, Stanford has been almost per
fect for the past two games. I think that will contin
ue, and Stanford will ride that to a sizeable lead.

Once the Cardinal is ahead, it'll be tough for anyone
to come back due to the ferocious pass rush. Stan
ford will pull away steadily to win easily and send
another message nationally, to those who are still
awake to notice.
GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 31, WASHINGTON 21 : its
simple: Stanford will win this game if the team plays
like it did against Washington State. Yes, quarterback
Keith Price is playing the best football of his life right
now, but the Cardinal defense has shown in the last
two games that it can shut down not just slow
down any offense as long as it applies enough
pressure on the quarterback. Bishop Sankey is also
a beast, but I truly believe that this year's front seven
is even better than last year's unit, which, if you re
call, found away to contain three Doak Walker
Award finalists. I expect Kevin Hogan and company
to get off to a hot start with a good mix of tunnel
screens to Ty Montgomery and the power running
game. The score might be close at halftime, but
Stanford will show its mettle in the fourth quarter and
put the Huskies away. Sidenote: Ed Reynolds is due
for a pick six.

MICHAEL PETERSON
STANFORD 30, WASHINGTON 17: is
there a team in the nation more at the top of its
game right now than Stanford? Back-to-back con
vincing wins have shown not only the continued
dominance of the ground game but a real develop
ment in the passing game and especially in Kevin
Hogan, who threw for a career-high 286 yards last
Saturday. And let's not forget about a defense that
scored two touchdowns and allowed only three
points until the fourth quarter, when the game was
essentially over. However, Washington is the most
balanced team Stanford has faced all season with
one of the nation's leading rushers, Bishop
Sankey, an experienced and dynamic quarterback
in Keith Price and the nation's No. 4 defense in
terms of points allowed. Expect Stanford to be up
by a touchdown early as its now-threatening pass
ing game opens up avenues for the run. Washing
ton will hang around until being put away late in
the fourth quarter for another Stanford victory.
