# Academies need to be self-sufficient
## 
### Joey Beyda 
Take it from a Barry Bonds fan: It's
just not fun when the federal gov
ernment gets involved in sports.
Congress' sojourn into the sports
pages this week was unintentional heck,

it got there by trying
to do nothing
but the conse
quences were near
ly disastrous. Here's
the skinny: When
the federal govern
ment stopped

working and shut
tered its doors on Tuesday cutting off mon-

ey to many nonessential programs, it left
the athletic departments at Army, Navy
and Air Force unfunded. That means that
the teams' football games for this Saturday
(Army-Boston College, Navy-Air Force)
were put on hold for nearly two days be
fore they were finally given the thumbs-up
late Wednesday.
Now, if those games had actually been
cancelled, I'd be writing a very different
column right now. Letting political issues
keep those storied college football pro
grams off the field is reprehensible in the
same way as boycotting the Olympics; larg
er agenda aside, it's just not fair to the ath
letes who have been preparing their whole
lives for this moment. There are only so
many college football games in four years,
after all.

I'm glad that this weekend's football
games are back on, and I have a feeling that
if anyone can stay mentally focused in
preparing for a game that may or may not
take place, it's the members of our armed
forces. But the only reason that those three
schools will play this weekend is that their
football games are not funded through
Congress.

Many of their other athletic teams

aren't so lucky.
At Navy, 19 events were cancelled or
postponed this weekend alone in yet anoth
er manifestation of the "all athletes are
equal, but some athletes are more equal
than others" standard that college athletics
has grown so accustomed to. At the very
least though I have no idea if there are
legal implications to this the shutdown
has ensured that the service academies will
fail to live up to Title IX's "proportionate op
portunities" standard in the short run.
It isn't just Navy. Army had to cancel a
women's soccer game Wednesday, while
none of Air Force's non-football teams will
be able to travel this weekend.
I don't know a whole lot about those
athletic programs. But I do know few stu
dent bodies support their teams the way
that the service academies do, and it's a
shame that they'll have to miss out for the

time being.
Even watching Stanford's game at
Army on TV last month, I could tell that
the atmosphere at West Point was electric.
Cadets were doing push-ups all over the
place, John Flacco was becoming an
overnight star and the tactical experts that
filled the student section actually seemed
to know a thing or two about football. At
least a bit of that school spirit has got to
carry over to other sports.
But if all of that can be put in jeopardy
by the governmental disputes that litter
Washington, D.C., nowadays, isn't it time
to privatize (no pun intended) the service
academies' athletic departments?
It's not like they'd have trouble find
ing the money. According to a 2011 Forbes
report, 17 of the 400 wealthiest Ameri
cans are veterans of the armed forces,
and each of them is worth at least $ 1 bil
lion. For every Phil Knight, there's a
David Murdoch; the Nike king may be
over five times richer than his Dole coun
terpart, but it's not like West Point's or

derly barracks need to be Oregonized
(pun definitely intended).
This is all for the sake of argument
I'm not trying to stake my claim to a posi
tion in Army's development office. But
we've been down this road before. Cal al
most lost five of its teams, including its
baseball program, due to budget cuts on
the state level back in 2010. Those teams
were preserved by aggressive fundraising
efforts by Golden Bear donors, who kept
all five of those programs alive. Even
though they're Cal affiliates, it's hard not
to commend their efforts. If the service
academies want to keep their teams on the
field despite the ups and downs of our
democratic system, maybe federal funding
isn't such a reliable crutch anymore.
Take a page out of Cal's book. I can't
believe I just said it.

Joseph Bey da doesn't think it's hypocritical to
write this column while still relying on his parents'
funding. Give him financial advice at
jbeyda@stanford. edu.

Take a page out of Cal's book. I can't
believe I just said it.

Joseph Bey da doesn't think it's hypocritical to
write this column while still relying on his parents'
funding. Give him financial advice at

Take it from a Barry Bonds fan: It's
just not fun when the federal gov
ernment gets involved in sports.
Congress' sojourn into the sports
pages this week was unintentional heck,

it got there by trying
to do nothing
but the conse
quences were near
ly disastrous. Here's
the skinny: When
the federal govern
ment stopped

working and shut
tered its doors on Tuesday cutting off mon-

ey to many nonessential programs, it left
the athletic departments at Army, Navy
and Air Force unfunded. That means that
the teams' football games for this Saturday
(Army-Boston College, Navy-Air Force)
were put on hold for nearly two days be
fore they were finally given the thumbs-up
late Wednesday.
Now, if those games had actually been
cancelled, I'd be writing a very different
column right now. Letting political issues
keep those storied college football pro
grams off the field is reprehensible in the
same way as boycotting the Olympics; larg
er agenda aside, it's just not fair to the ath
letes who have been preparing their whole
lives for this moment. There are only so
many college football games in four years,
after all.

I'm glad that this weekend's football
games are back on, and I have a feeling that
if anyone can stay mentally focused in
preparing for a game that may or may not
take place, it's the members of our armed
forces. But the only reason that those three
schools will play this weekend is that their
football games are not funded through
Congress.

Many of their other athletic teams

aren't so lucky.
At Navy, 19 events were cancelled or
postponed this weekend alone in yet anoth
er manifestation of the "all athletes are
equal, but some athletes are more equal
than others" standard that college athletics
has grown so accustomed to. At the very
least though I have no idea if there are
legal implications to this the shutdown
has ensured that the service academies will
fail to live up to Title IX's "proportionate op
portunities" standard in the short run.
It isn't just Navy. Army had to cancel a
women's soccer game Wednesday, while
none of Air Force's non-football teams will
be able to travel this weekend.
I don't know a whole lot about those
athletic programs. But I do know few stu
dent bodies support their teams the way
that the service academies do, and it's a
shame that they'll have to miss out for the

time being.
Even watching Stanford's game at
Army on TV last month, I could tell that
the atmosphere at West Point was electric.
Cadets were doing push-ups all over the
place, John Flacco was becoming an
overnight star and the tactical experts that
filled the student section actually seemed
to know a thing or two about football. At
least a bit of that school spirit has got to
carry over to other sports.
But if all of that can be put in jeopardy
by the governmental disputes that litter
Washington, D.C., nowadays, isn't it time
to privatize (no pun intended) the service
academies' athletic departments?
It's not like they'd have trouble find
ing the money. According to a 2011 Forbes
report, 17 of the 400 wealthiest Ameri
cans are veterans of the armed forces,
and each of them is worth at least $ 1 bil
lion. For every Phil Knight, there's a
David Murdoch; the Nike king may be
over five times richer than his Dole coun
terpart, but it's not like West Point's or

derly barracks need to be Oregonized
(pun definitely intended).
This is all for the sake of argument
I'm not trying to stake my claim to a posi
tion in Army's development office. But
we've been down this road before. Cal al
most lost five of its teams, including its
baseball program, due to budget cuts on
the state level back in 2010. Those teams
were preserved by aggressive fundraising
efforts by Golden Bear donors, who kept
all five of those programs alive. Even
though they're Cal affiliates, it's hard not
to commend their efforts. If the service
academies want to keep their teams on the
field despite the ups and downs of our
democratic system, maybe federal funding
isn't such a reliable crutch anymore.
