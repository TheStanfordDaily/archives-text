# Academies need to be self-sufficient

Take it from a Barry Bonds fan: It's
just not fun when the federal gov
ernment gets involved in sports.
Congress' sojourn into the sports
pages this week was unintentional heck,

it got there by trying
to do nothing
but the conse
quences were near
ly disastrous. Here's
the skinny: When
the federal govern
ment stopped

working and shut
tered its doors on Tuesday cutting off mon-

ey to many nonessential programs, it left
the athletic departments at Army, Navy
and Air Force unfunded. That means that
the teams' football games for this Saturday
(Army-Boston College, Navy-Air Force)
were put on hold for nearly two days be
fore they were finally given the thumbs-up
late Wednesday.
Now, if those games had actually been
cancelled, I'd be writing a very different
column right now. Letting political issues
keep those storied college football pro
grams off the field is reprehensible in the
same way as boycotting the Olympics; larg
er agenda aside, it's just not fair to the ath
letes who have been preparing their whole
lives for this moment. There are only so
many college football games in four years,
after all.

I'm glad that this weekend's football
games are back on, and I have a feeling that
if anyone can stay mentally focused in
preparing for a game that may or may not
take place, it's the members of our armed
forces. But the only reason that those three
schools will play this weekend is that their
football games are not funded through
Congress.
