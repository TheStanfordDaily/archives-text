### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
In the football world, it's big news
whenever a top recruit makes a decision
and chooses to play for a certain school.
And even before then, there is always end
less speculation by fans and experts alike all
around the nation debating the possibilities
and adding to the general hype. But outside
of football, baseball and even sometimes
basketball, new players on a team often
don't get the attention that they deserve.
With that in mind, it's not astonishing
that many Stanford students haven't heard
of junior forward Taylor Uhl of the women's
soccer team, who turned heads though
not as many as she should have —when
she chose to transfer to the Farm from the
University of Minnesota. But everything
about her performance screams that it
should be astonishing.
Taylor Uhl isn't just any transfer from
around the nation. She was the nation's
leading scorer last year on an 11-7-2 Min
nesota team, was first-team All-Big Ten and
on the Big Ten All-Academic team among a

much, much longer list of accolades. She
left the Golden Gophers as the No. 5 player
in Minnesota history with her 85 points
and her 36 goals. And this all was just in
two collegiate seasons. The sky was truly
the limit.

And despite Uhl's loaded resume, her
decision to transfer to Stanford was one
that many failed to note the significance of,
despite her national star status and its im
plications for a Stanford team that had fall
en just short of a national championship in
three of its last four seasons.

The significance, however, was not lost
on Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe.

"It means a lot to me," said Ratcliffe on
Uhl's decision. "It's a great honor to coach
one of the best players in Division I soccer.
It's something that I always want. It's al
ways a goal of mine to coach the best play
ers, and I think Stanford attracts the best
players. So we're really fortunate to have
her here, and hopefully we can take advan
tage of her abilities and try and compete for
a Pac-12 championship and a national
championship."
It caught many around the nation off

guard when Uhl decided to transfer, but in
her mind, focusing on her current status
with her new teammates holds a much
higher importance than dwelling on the cir
cumstances that brought her to a new
team.

"It was a tough decision for sure," Uhl
said. "I have nothing bad to say about Min
nesota. There were great people there and
it was an amazing program. Stanford just
brings so much to the table. It's an amazing
place and I'm so happy to be here."
Uhl is happy to be here, and her per
formance is definitely making Stanford fans
happy that she's here as well.
Halfway through her first season with
the Cardinal, the junior is making a huge
splash as her nine goals and 18 total points
place the No. 2 Stanford team in a season
in which the Cardinal hopes to make a sixth
straight Final Four run and push itself over
the edge to claim its second national cham
pionship in the last three years.

Junior forward Taylor Uhl (right) has already scored nine goals as a member of the Stanford Cardinal after transferring from Minnesota for
the 2013 season. Uhl has not given a specific reason for the move, but at Stanford Uhl has a much improved chance at an NCAA title.
aspirations and capabilities and ac
tively makes it a goal for herself to
help her new team as much as she
can. However, she prides herself
first and foremost on her goal-scor
ing abilities, which have found a
welcome niche on a Cardinal
squad with a team-first mentality
that gives Uhl as many opportuni
ties as she could ever want to drill
the ball into the back of the net.

"What I bring to the table is
goal scoring so I go into most games
and try to be as dangerous as I can
and get as many shots on goal as I
can," Uhl said. "But I like to get as
sists too, and just whatever the
team really needs, whether that's
bringing a ton of energy to the
game, high defensive pressure, be
ing a vocal leader, I try to adapt to
the situation. But the bottom line is,
I really pride myself on getting the
ball in the back of the net."

And Uhl takes full advantage of
those opportunities, as exactly half
of her 18 shots on goal have found
the back of the net so far this sea
son. Her nine goals account for just
under 40 percent of the Cardinal's
scoring in 2013.
Although Uhl is the player that
racks up the statistics as the season
progresses, she is always very quick
to credit the team around her a
much more complete and skilled
team than her former squad at Min
nesota for her accomplish
ments. She thinks of her goals as
simply what they are for a tight-knit,
team-first unit like that of Stanford
just the end product of a strong,
united team effort.

"What I bring to a team is usu
ally goal-scoring, and that's kind of
what I do and that's the gift I've
been given, but a goal's just, you
know, the final pass into the net,"
Uhl said. "That's what an amazing
team brings and they make my job
easy. They set me up really amazing

1y... I'm happy to be the one on the
other end finishing it, but again it's
a lot of behind-the-scenes and dirty
work that gets me those goals."
In that way, she has fit ex
tremely well into Stanford's system
on the pitch and has integrated her
self seamlessly into the team effort
that happens on the field. And by all
accounts, she has readily become a
true member of the team's off-the
pitch community as well.
"I think she's adjusting really
well," Ratcliffe commented.
"She's very popular with the girls
on the team. I've been really im
pressed with her maturity and her
work ethic."

"It was really cool getting to
come early," Uhl remarked. "We
came six weeks before school
started, so I got to bond with the
team a bit before school actually
started here, so I got a good group
of friends going."
Although she was playfully giv
en a hard time by the team when
she first joined as is the tradi
tion for freshmen and other new
players Uhl has rapidly become
a central part of the Cardinal
women's soccer community and
was quick to dive into the chem
istry that holds the team together.
"[Adjusting] wasn't easy, but a
great coaching staff here, they
made it really welcoming for me,"
Uhl said. "You know, they always
give freshmen a hard time, but
that brings the team closer togeth
er in the end."
And the Minnesotan isn't al
ways on the receiving end of play
ful banter with her teammates.
She knows how to dish it as well
just another element of truly
becoming a part of the team that
helped her to endear herself to
teammates.

"I like to make fun of the Cal
ifornia girls because I think they're
a little more high-maintenance
than the Midwest girls, but that's
just all in good fun," said Uhl with
a grin.

Her transition to the Farm as a
Stanford student, outside the ath
letic realm, has also been seamless,
as many elements of her situation
appealed to her and helped her
feel at home early on. Uhl re
marked that a substantial propor
tion of the transfer community this
year much more so than in
years past was comprised of fel
low Minnesotans, with whom she
shared geographical roots.

Even after the first week of
class by no means an easy chal
lenge for a Stanford junior Uhl
was still having fun. She comment
ed that the weather was amazing
and she was really finding a place
on campus. And even as the full
force of Pac-12 play looms 11
straight conference games, includ
ing last Saturday's win over Col
orado and today's home match
against Arizona she is enjoying
life on campus, both as a Stanford
student and Stanford athlete.

Uhl has truly embraced the
Stanford athlete lifestyle prac
tices and classes intertwined every
day in a daunting schedule and
has found enjoyment in it as well.
"It's a great training environ
ment in general," Uhl said, "be
cause there are so many good play
ers on the team and you come to
training, you get better every sin
gle day and then you go to the
games and you just get to have
fun."

And with her eyes on the ulti
mate prize of a national champi
onship a goal that is more with
in her reach here at Stanford than
it has ever been before she
knows that she's in the right place
to do it.

"However I can contribute to
the team doing well is why I'm
here," Uhl said. "It's exciting to say
that your team is challenging for a
national championship. What
more can you ask for?"

squad with a team-first mentality
that gives Uhl as many opportuni
ties as she could ever want to drill
the ball into the back of the net.

"What I bring to the table is
goal scoring so I go into most games
and try to be as dangerous as I can
and get as many shots on goal as I
can," Uhl said. "But I like to get as
sists too, and just whatever the
team really needs, whether that's
bringing a ton of energy to the
game, high defensive pressure, be
ing a vocal leader, I try to adapt to
the situation. But the bottom line is,
I really pride myself on getting the
ball in the back of the net."

And Uhl takes full advantage of
those opportunities, as exactly half
of her 18 shots on goal have found
the back of the net so far this sea
son. Her nine goals account for just
under 40 percent of the Cardinal's
scoring in 2013.
Although Uhl is the player that
racks up the statistics as the season
progresses, she is always very quick
to credit the team around her a
much more complete and skilled
team than her former squad at Min
nesota for her accomplish
ments. She thinks of her goals as
simply what they are for a tight-knit,
team-first unit like that of Stanford
just the end product of a strong,
united team effort.

"What I bring to a team is usu
ally goal-scoring, and that's kind of
what I do and that's the gift I've
been given, but a goal's just, you
know, the final pass into the net,"
Uhl said. "That's what an amazing
team brings and they make my job
easy. They set me up really amazing

1y... I'm happy to be the one on the
other end finishing it, but again it's
a lot of behind-the-scenes and dirty
work that gets me those goals."
In that way, she has fit ex
tremely well into Stanford's system
on the pitch and has integrated her
self seamlessly into the team effort
that happens on the field. And by all
accounts, she has readily become a
true member of the team's off-the
pitch community as well.
"I think she's adjusting really
well," Ratcliffe commented.
"She's very popular with the girls
on the team. I've been really im
pressed with her maturity and her
work ethic."

"It was really cool getting to
come early," Uhl remarked. "We
came six weeks before school
started, so I got to bond with the
team a bit before school actually
started here, so I got a good group
of friends going."
Although she was playfully giv
en a hard time by the team when
she first joined as is the tradi
tion for freshmen and other new
players Uhl has rapidly become
a central part of the Cardinal
women's soccer community and
was quick to dive into the chem
istry that holds the team together.
"[Adjusting] wasn't easy, but a
great coaching staff here, they
made it really welcoming for me,"
Uhl said. "You know, they always
give freshmen a hard time, but
that brings the team closer togeth
er in the end."
And the Minnesotan isn't al
ways on the receiving end of play
ful banter with her teammates.
She knows how to dish it as well
just another element of truly
becoming a part of the team that
helped her to endear herself to
teammates.

"I like to make fun of the Cal
ifornia girls because I think they're
a little more high-maintenance
than the Midwest girls, but that's
just all in good fun," said Uhl with
a grin.

Her transition to the Farm as a
Stanford student, outside the ath
letic realm, has also been seamless,
as many elements of her situation
appealed to her and helped her
feel at home early on. Uhl re
marked that a substantial propor
tion of the transfer community this
year much more so than in
years past was comprised of fel
low Minnesotans, with whom she
shared geographical roots.

Even after the first week of
class by no means an easy chal
lenge for a Stanford junior Uhl
was still having fun. She comment
ed that the weather was amazing
and she was really finding a place
on campus. And even as the full
force of Pac-12 play looms 11
straight conference games, includ
ing last Saturday's win over Col
orado and today's home match
against Arizona she is enjoying
life on campus, both as a Stanford
student and Stanford athlete.

Uhl has truly embraced the
Stanford athlete lifestyle prac
tices and classes intertwined every
day in a daunting schedule and
has found enjoyment in it as well.
"It's a great training environ
ment in general," Uhl said, "be
cause there are so many good play
ers on the team and you come to
training, you get better every sin
gle day and then you go to the
games and you just get to have
fun."

And with her eyes on the ulti
mate prize of a national champi
onship a goal that is more with
in her reach here at Stanford than
it has ever been before she
knows that she's in the right place
to do it.

"However I can contribute to
the team doing well is why I'm
here," Uhl said. "It's exciting to say
that your team is challenging for a
national championship. What
more can you ask for?"

In the football world, it's big news
whenever a top recruit makes a decision
and chooses to play for a certain school.
And even before then, there is always end
less speculation by fans and experts alike all
around the nation debating the possibilities
and adding to the general hype. But outside
of football, baseball and even sometimes
basketball, new players on a team often
don't get the attention that they deserve.
With that in mind, it's not astonishing
that many Stanford students haven't heard
of junior forward Taylor Uhl of the women's
soccer team, who turned heads though
not as many as she should have —when
she chose to transfer to the Farm from the
University of Minnesota. But everything
about her performance screams that it
should be astonishing.
Taylor Uhl isn't just any transfer from
around the nation. She was the nation's
leading scorer last year on an 11-7-2 Min
nesota team, was first-team All-Big Ten and
on the Big Ten All-Academic team among a

much, much longer list of accolades. She
left the Golden Gophers as the No. 5 player
in Minnesota history with her 85 points
and her 36 goals. And this all was just in
two collegiate seasons. The sky was truly
the limit.

And despite Uhl's loaded resume, her
decision to transfer to Stanford was one
that many failed to note the significance of,
despite her national star status and its im
plications for a Stanford team that had fall
en just short of a national championship in
three of its last four seasons.

The significance, however, was not lost
on Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe.

"It means a lot to me," said Ratcliffe on
Uhl's decision. "It's a great honor to coach
one of the best players in Division I soccer.
It's something that I always want. It's al
ways a goal of mine to coach the best play
ers, and I think Stanford attracts the best
players. So we're really fortunate to have
her here, and hopefully we can take advan
tage of her abilities and try and compete for
a Pac-12 championship and a national
championship."
It caught many around the nation off

guard when Uhl decided to transfer, but in
her mind, focusing on her current status
with her new teammates holds a much
higher importance than dwelling on the cir
cumstances that brought her to a new
team.

"It was a tough decision for sure," Uhl
said. "I have nothing bad to say about Min
nesota. There were great people there and
it was an amazing program. Stanford just
brings so much to the table. It's an amazing
place and I'm so happy to be here."
Uhl is happy to be here, and her per
formance is definitely making Stanford fans
happy that she's here as well.
Halfway through her first season with
the Cardinal, the junior is making a huge
splash as her nine goals and 18 total points
place the No. 2 Stanford team in a season
in which the Cardinal hopes to make a sixth
straight Final Four run and push itself over
the edge to claim its second national cham
pionship in the last three years.

Her transition to the Farm as a
Stanford student, outside the ath
letic realm, has also been seamless,
as many elements of her situation
appealed to her and helped her
feel at home early on. Uhl re
marked that a substantial propor
tion of the transfer community this
year much more so than in
years past was comprised of fel
low Minnesotans, with whom she
shared geographical roots.

Even after the first week of
class by no means an easy chal
lenge for a Stanford junior Uhl
was still having fun. She comment
ed that the weather was amazing
and she was really finding a place
on campus. And even as the full
force of Pac-12 play looms 11
straight conference games, includ
ing last Saturday's win over Col
orado and today's home match
against Arizona she is enjoying
life on campus, both as a Stanford
student and Stanford athlete.

Uhl has truly embraced the
Stanford athlete lifestyle prac
tices and classes intertwined every
day in a daunting schedule and
has found enjoyment in it as well.
"It's a great training environ
ment in general," Uhl said, "be
cause there are so many good play
ers on the team and you come to
training, you get better every sin
gle day and then you go to the
games and you just get to have
fun."

And with her eyes on the ulti
mate prize of a national champi
onship a goal that is more with
in her reach here at Stanford than
it has ever been before she
knows that she's in the right place
to do it.

"However I can contribute to
the team doing well is why I'm
here," Uhl said. "It's exciting to say
that your team is challenging for a
national championship. What
more can you ask for?"

In the football world, it's big news
whenever a top recruit makes a decision
and chooses to play for a certain school.
And even before then, there is always end
less speculation by fans and experts alike all
around the nation debating the possibilities
and adding to the general hype. But outside
of football, baseball and even sometimes
basketball, new players on a team often
don't get the attention that they deserve.
With that in mind, it's not astonishing
that many Stanford students haven't heard
of junior forward Taylor Uhl of the women's
soccer team, who turned heads though
not as many as she should have —when
she chose to transfer to the Farm from the
University of Minnesota. But everything
about her performance screams that it
should be astonishing.
Taylor Uhl isn't just any transfer from
around the nation. She was the nation's
leading scorer last year on an 11-7-2 Min
nesota team, was first-team All-Big Ten and
on the Big Ten All-Academic team among a

much, much longer list of accolades. She
left the Golden Gophers as the No. 5 player
in Minnesota history with her 85 points
and her 36 goals. And this all was just in
two collegiate seasons. The sky was truly
the limit.

And despite Uhl's loaded resume, her
decision to transfer to Stanford was one
that many failed to note the significance of,
despite her national star status and its im
plications for a Stanford team that had fall
en just short of a national championship in
three of its last four seasons.

The significance, however, was not lost
on Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe.

"It means a lot to me," said Ratcliffe on
Uhl's decision. "It's a great honor to coach
one of the best players in Division I soccer.
It's something that I always want. It's al
ways a goal of mine to coach the best play
ers, and I think Stanford attracts the best
players. So we're really fortunate to have
her here, and hopefully we can take advan
tage of her abilities and try and compete for
a Pac-12 championship and a national
championship."
It caught many around the nation off

guard when Uhl decided to transfer, but in
her mind, focusing on her current status
with her new teammates holds a much
higher importance than dwelling on the cir
cumstances that brought her to a new
team.

"It was a tough decision for sure," Uhl
said. "I have nothing bad to say about Min
nesota. There were great people there and
it was an amazing program. Stanford just
brings so much to the table. It's an amazing
place and I'm so happy to be here."
Uhl is happy to be here, and her per
formance is definitely making Stanford fans
happy that she's here as well.
Halfway through her first season with
the Cardinal, the junior is making a huge
splash as her nine goals and 18 total points
place the No. 2 Stanford team in a season
in which the Cardinal hopes to make a sixth
straight Final Four run and push itself over
the edge to claim its second national cham
pionship in the last three years.
The junior from Eden Prairie, Minn., is
fully aware of the Cardinal's championship

the 2013 season. Uhl has not given a specific reason for the move, but at Stanford Uhl has a much improved chance at an NCAA title.
aspirations and capabilities and ac
tively makes it a goal for herself to
help her new team as much as she
can. However, she prides herself
first and foremost on her goal-scor
ing abilities, which have found a
welcome niche on a Cardinal
squad with a team-first mentality
that gives Uhl as many opportuni
ties as she could ever want to drill
the ball into the back of the net.

"What I bring to the table is
goal scoring so I go into most games
and try to be as dangerous as I can
and get as many shots on goal as I
can," Uhl said. "But I like to get as
sists too, and just whatever the
team really needs, whether that's
bringing a ton of energy to the
game, high defensive pressure, be
ing a vocal leader, I try to adapt to
the situation. But the bottom line is,
I really pride myself on getting the
ball in the back of the net."

And Uhl takes full advantage of
those opportunities, as exactly half
of her 18 shots on goal have found
the back of the net so far this sea
son. Her nine goals account for just
under 40 percent of the Cardinal's
scoring in 2013.
Although Uhl is the player that
racks up the statistics as the season
progresses, she is always very quick
to credit the team around her a
much more complete and skilled
team than her former squad at Min
nesota for her accomplish
ments. She thinks of her goals as
simply what they are for a tight-knit,
team-first unit like that of Stanford
just the end product of a strong,
united team effort.

"What I bring to a team is usu
ally goal-scoring, and that's kind of
what I do and that's the gift I've
been given, but a goal's just, you
know, the final pass into the net,"
Uhl said. "That's what an amazing
team brings and they make my job
easy. They set me up really amazing

1y... I'm happy to be the one on the
other end finishing it, but again it's
a lot of behind-the-scenes and dirty
work that gets me those goals."
In that way, she has fit ex
tremely well into Stanford's system
on the pitch and has integrated her
self seamlessly into the team effort
that happens on the field. And by all
accounts, she has readily become a
true member of the team's off-the
pitch community as well.
"I think she's adjusting really
well," Ratcliffe commented.
"She's very popular with the girls
on the team. I've been really im
pressed with her maturity and her
work ethic."

"It was really cool getting to
come early," Uhl remarked. "We
came six weeks before school
started, so I got to bond with the
team a bit before school actually
started here, so I got a good group
of friends going."
Although she was playfully giv
en a hard time by the team when
she first joined as is the tradi
tion for freshmen and other new
players Uhl has rapidly become
a central part of the Cardinal
women's soccer community and
was quick to dive into the chem
istry that holds the team together.
"[Adjusting] wasn't easy, but a
great coaching staff here, they
made it really welcoming for me,"
Uhl said. "You know, they always
give freshmen a hard time, but
that brings the team closer togeth
er in the end."
And the Minnesotan isn't al
ways on the receiving end of play
ful banter with her teammates.
She knows how to dish it as well
just another element of truly
becoming a part of the team that
helped her to endear herself to
teammates.

"I like to make fun of the Cal
ifornia girls because I think they're
a little more high-maintenance
than the Midwest girls, but that's
just all in good fun," said Uhl with
a grin.

Her transition to the Farm as a
Stanford student, outside the ath
letic realm, has also been seamless,
as many elements of her situation
appealed to her and helped her
feel at home early on. Uhl re
