In the football world, it's big news
whenever a top recruit makes a decision
and chooses to play for a certain school.
And even before then, there is always end
less speculation by fans and experts alike all
around the nation debating the possibilities
and adding to the general hype. But outside
of football, baseball and even sometimes
basketball, new players on a team often
don't get the attention that they deserve.
With that in mind, it's not astonishing
that many Stanford students haven't heard
of junior forward Taylor Uhl of the women's
soccer team, who turned heads though
not as many as she should have â€”when
she chose to transfer to the Farm from the
University of Minnesota. But everything
about her performance screams that it
should be astonishing.
Taylor Uhl isn't just any transfer from
around the nation. She was the nation's
leading scorer last year on an 11-7-2 Min
nesota team, was first-team All-Big Ten and
on the Big Ten All-Academic team among a

much, much longer list of accolades. She
left the Golden Gophers as the No. 5 player
in Minnesota history with her 85 points
and her 36 goals. And this all was just in
two collegiate seasons. The sky was truly
the limit.

And despite Uhl's loaded resume, her
decision to transfer to Stanford was one
that many failed to note the significance of,
despite her national star status and its im
plications for a Stanford team that had fall
en just short of a national championship in
three of its last four seasons.

The significance, however, was not lost
on Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe.

"It means a lot to me," said Ratcliffe on
Uhl's decision. "It's a great honor to coach
one of the best players in Division I soccer.
It's something that I always want. It's al
ways a goal of mine to coach the best play
ers, and I think Stanford attracts the best
players. So we're really fortunate to have
her here, and hopefully we can take advan
tage of her abilities and try and compete for
a Pac-12 championship and a national
championship."
It caught many around the nation off

guard when Uhl decided to transfer, but in
her mind, focusing on her current status
with her new teammates holds a much
higher importance than dwelling on the cir
cumstances that brought her to a new
team.

"It was a tough decision for sure," Uhl
said. "I have nothing bad to say about Min
nesota. There were great people there and
it was an amazing program. Stanford just
brings so much to the table. It's an amazing
place and I'm so happy to be here."
Uhl is happy to be here, and her per
formance is definitely making Stanford fans
happy that she's here as well.
Halfway through her first season with
the Cardinal, the junior is making a huge
splash as her nine goals and 18 total points
place the No. 2 Stanford team in a season
in which the Cardinal hopes to make a sixth
straight Final Four run and push itself over
the edge to claim its second national cham
pionship in the last three years.

the 2013 season. Uhl has not given a specific reason for the move, but at Stanford Uhl has a much improved chance at an NCAA title.
