# Huskies will need a new game plan
## 
### WHAT TO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
Stanford conquered its Centu
rylink Field demons a week ago
in dramatic fashion. Now the
Cardinal has a chance to com
plete the exorcism with a victory on Sat
urday against Washington at Stanford Sta
dium.

Unlike Washington State last week
end, however, the Huskies are a top-15
team with a strong offense and defense.
And while the most improved unit for
Washington may be its defense, when
talking about the Huskies you still have to
start with their explosive offense.

In 2012, the Stanford defense was
able to mostly shut down that strong of
fensive attack. One big play —a 61-yard
touchdown run by star running back
Bishop Sankey on fourth-and-1 —and
one long scoring drive were all that the
Huskies could manage, but thanks to
Stanford's poor offensive performance,
Washington was able to prevail 17-13.

So while Stanford can take solace in
a strong defensive performance, there is
a twist: The Huskies are better on offense
in 2013. Price is healthy, his offensive line
is finally intact and Sankey has turned in
to the nation's leading rusher. Add three
explosive receivers on the outside and
suddenly Washington's offense starts to
sound a lot like Stanford's, but with per
haps the best tight end in the nation in
Austin Seferian-Jenkins.

From what I've heard through the
grapevine, Sankey and Seferian-Jenkins
may be a bit overrated. Sankey is a solid
