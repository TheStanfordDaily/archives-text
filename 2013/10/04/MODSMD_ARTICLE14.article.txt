# Huskies will need a new game plan
## 
### WHAT TO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
Stanford conquered its Centu
rylink Field demons a week ago
in dramatic fashion. Now the
Cardinal has a chance to com
plete the exorcism with a victory on Sat
urday against Washington at Stanford Sta
dium.

Unlike Washington State last week
end, however, the Huskies are a top-15
team with a strong offense and defense.
And while the most improved unit for
Washington may be its defense, when
talking about the Huskies you still have to
start with their explosive offense.

In 2012, the Stanford defense was
able to mostly shut down that strong of
fensive attack. One big play —a 61-yard
touchdown run by star running back
Bishop Sankey on fourth-and-1 —and
one long scoring drive were all that the
Huskies could manage, but thanks to
Stanford's poor offensive performance,
Washington was able to prevail 17-13.

So while Stanford can take solace in
a strong defensive performance, there is
a twist: The Huskies are better on offense
in 2013. Price is healthy, his offensive line
is finally intact and Sankey has turned in
to the nation's leading rusher. Add three
explosive receivers on the outside and
suddenly Washington's offense starts to
sound a lot like Stanford's, but with per
haps the best tight end in the nation in
Austin Seferian-Jenkins.

From what I've heard through the
grapevine, Sankey and Seferian-Jenkins
may be a bit overrated. Sankey is a solid

back, but much of his production
can be credited to poor defense and
good blocking. Seferian-Jenkins,
while a stud in years past, looks hob
bled by nagging injuries and has
been anything but a superstar. If the
Cardinal can continue playing good
fundamental defense and tackle
well, neither should be a problem. I

would expect Stanford to have its
pass rushers chip Seferian-Jenkins,
though, so that might slow down
the "Party in the backfield" a tad.
Washington's defense is much
more of an unknown. Defensive co
ordinator Justin Wilcox turned
around the Huskies defense in his
first season (2012), and early indica
tions are that Washington will be
stout again.

The trickiest part about analyz
ing the matchup between the Cardi

nal offense and Washington's de
fense is that the Huskies are likely to
change their style fairly dramatically
for this contest. In last season's
matchup, Wilcox shifted his lineup
around to get a lot more size on the
field than usual, a smart strategy
against Stanford's power offense.
Don't be surprised if you see six
foot, 334-pound backup nose tackle
Lawrence Lagafuaina playing a lot
more than he has in the first four
games.

The big question, however, is
how closely Wilcox will try to follow
that 2012 blueprint. Last weekend,
Washington State seemed to be try
ing everything that the Huskies used
in 2012, and it failed miserably. Was
that because of a lack of execution, a
lack of talent or a flawed game plan?
That will be up to Wilcox to decide
and evaluate throughout the game. I
will say that if Wilcox thinks he can
stuff the box with nine or 10 guys
like he did last year, he will watch

junior quarterback Kevin Hogan find
his three speedsters over the top all
night long and Stanford will win eas
ily. I bet Wilcox has something very
different up his sleeve, and we'll find
out tomorrow night.

You'll find Sam Fisher tomorrow night
sleeping on one of the shiny black
leather couches at the new Stanford
football building. Send him some blan
