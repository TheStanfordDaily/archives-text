# BACK AND FORTH WITH WASHINGTON
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's football
game between Stanford and
Washington, The Daily's David
Cohn chatted with Thuc Nhi
Nguyen, sports editor for The
Daily, Washington's student
newspaper, to get perspective
from both camps. Below is a par
tial transcript of their conversa
tion. For the full back-and-forth,
go to www.StanfordDaily.com/
category/sports.

David Cohn (DC): My first
question is what are your initial
thoughts on this matchup be
tween UW and Stanford?

True Nhi Nguyen (TN): I think
it should be a good one. Obvi
ously there's that possible re
venge factor with what hap
pened last season at Centu
ry Link. For the Huskies, it's a
chance to prove their worth
against a team that head coach
Steve Sarkisian called a "national
championship contender." It'll
be especially interesting to see if
the Huskies can, on defense,
make the switch back to defend
ing a slower pro-style offense af
ter putting so much effort into
getting better against the no
huddle.

DC: Much has been made about
Washington's struggles, particu
larly on the road in recent years.
Do you think UW has finally
bucked that trend, or is it too
soon to say at this point?

TN: That's a tough one to an
swer because on one hand, yes,
I do feel like this team is leaps
and bounds better than those in

the past. This team definitely has
a certain air around it that sug
gests a maturity and a confi
dence that maybe wasn't there
in the past. Going on the road to
Illinois and fending off a late
surge there said a lot about the
Huskies, who have really strug
gled on the road in the past. But,

with that said, I don't want to go
out and say that the UW is head
ed straight to the Rose Bowl or
anything like that; because while
this is supposed to be the UW's
year, it's also supposed to be
Oregon and Stanford's years too.
DC: Let's talk about Keith Price
for a moment. Do you think that

he has improved this year, and, if
so, what specific improvement
has he made that gives Husky
fans confidence that Price can
lead Washington to a victory this
weekend over Stanford?

TN: Keith Price has definitely
improved this year. The numbers
say it all: 72.3 percent comple
tions, nine touchdowns, only
two interceptions. He's making
smarter choices, not trying to
save the game when he doesn't
have to and more importantly,
not running for his life anymore.
The offensive line was porous at
best last year, and it went
through a lot of bumps and
bruises with all the injuries. It
was rough, but the guys up front
are better for it now because
they have more experience and
it's shown. Price has only been
sacked three times through four
games. Price is infinitely more
confident in himself, but mostly,
more confident in the people
around him, including the line
and his receivers, so he doesn't
feel like he has to do everything.
And it helps that the new of
fense fits him to a tee. People
will always hold him under a mi
croscope here, but for now,
Husky Nation is pretty pleased
with him.

DC: Turning to the other con
tributors on offense, Bishop
Sankey is an extremely talented
running back. I would argue that
he has been Washington's most
valuable player over the last year,
and he played an enormous role
in Washington's victory over the
Cardinal at Century Link Field
last season. Outside of Sankey,
can you give me another offen

sive playmaker that Stanford's de
fense should keep an eye on?

TN: Surely, Sankey is a very special
running back. He's a workhorse
and the Huskies are lucky to have
him. For someone outside of
Sankey, there are a lot of playmak
ers; that's why Sarkisian moved to
this no-huddle offense in the first
place, because it would emphasize
his skill players over his big guys.
Although Austin Seferian-Jenkins
and Kasen Williams are the biggest
names on offense and are huge
playmakers, someone to keep an
eye on would be Jaydon Mickens.
He's a small guy, but he's fast and
shifty, which makes him perfect for
the Huskies on bubble-screens and
short passes. He wasn't a huge con
tributor last season, but he's really
blossomed in the new offense late
ly in the slot receiver position. Price
dumps the ball off to him, and
Mickens does all the hard work
down the sideline.

DC: Moving to Washington's de
fense, the Huskies gave up only six
points on defense to Stanford last
season. However, this Cardinal of
fense is the farthest thing from the
unit, led by Josh Nunes, that took
on Washington last season. Cardi
nal quarterback Kevin Hogan is a

perfect 9-0 as the starting quarter
back for Stanford, and he brilliantly
exploited the WSU defensive strat
egy by completing long touchdown
passes to Devon Cajuste and
Michael Rector. With the loss of
Desmond Trufant now with the
Atlanta Falcons how can Wash
ington's defense stop an offense
that is running on all cylinders right
now?

TN: If I knew the answer to that, I
wouldn't be sitting at a college
newspaper and I would be on the
sideline next to [defensive coordi
nator] Justin Wilcox.

DC: Do you have any final thoughts
on this contest before we get to
predictions for Saturday's score?

TN: Hit me with the predictions.

DC: My prediction for Saturday's
game is a Stanford victory, as the
Cardinal win 38-21. However, this
score is by no means a negative
comment on Washington. In fact, I
think Washington will have a solid
season after this weekend. Howev
er, Stanford has been nearly flaw
less in its last two games, outside of
a garbage-time quarter that meant
nothing. I believe that seven quar
ters is a large enough sample size
that I can reasonably expect the
Cardinal to play at a national cham
pionship level in this game. If that
happens, I do not believe Washing
ton has any chance of winning this

game on the road.
TN: That's fair enough. I think it's
going to be closer than you, but the
Cardinal take it 41-35. The Huskies
are probably the best they've been
in a long, long time, but it's pretty
clear that Stanford is a national
championship contender and oper
ating at a level that is a little bit
higher than the UW However, if
Stanford is a bit off its game, the
Huskies could jump up and get a
momentum-swinging play that
could change everything. But that's
getting into hypotheticals. I'm defi
nitely with you on home-field ad
vantage for Stanford. The world
outside of Seattle hasn't always
been friendly to the Huskies.

in the past. Going on the road to
Illinois and fending off a late
surge there said a lot about the
Huskies, who have really strug
gled on the road in the past. But,

with that said, I don't want to go
out and say that the UW is head
ed straight to the Rose Bowl or
anything like that; because while
this is supposed to be the UW's
year, it's also supposed to be
Oregon and Stanford's years too.
DC: Let's talk about Keith Price
for a moment. Do you think that

he has improved this year, and, if
so, what specific improvement
has he made that gives Husky
fans confidence that Price can
lead Washington to a victory this
weekend over Stanford?

TN: Keith Price has definitely
improved this year. The numbers
say it all: 72.3 percent comple
tions, nine touchdowns, only
two interceptions. He's making
smarter choices, not trying to
save the game when he doesn't
have to and more importantly,
not running for his life anymore.
The offensive line was porous at
best last year, and it went
through a lot of bumps and
bruises with all the injuries. It
was rough, but the guys up front
are better for it now because
they have more experience and
it's shown. Price has only been
sacked three times through four
games. Price is infinitely more
confident in himself, but mostly,
more confident in the people
around him, including the line
and his receivers, so he doesn't
feel like he has to do everything.
And it helps that the new of
fense fits him to a tee. People
will always hold him under a mi
croscope here, but for now,
Husky Nation is pretty pleased
with him.

DC: Turning to the other con
tributors on offense, Bishop
Sankey is an extremely talented
running back. I would argue that
he has been Washington's most
valuable player over the last year,
and he played an enormous role
in Washington's victory over the
Cardinal at Century Link Field
last season. Outside of Sankey,
can you give me another offen

Stanford Saturday. All three have caught long touchdowns in 2013.
sive playmaker that Stanford's de
fense should keep an eye on?

TN: Surely, Sankey is a very special
running back. He's a workhorse
and the Huskies are lucky to have
him. For someone outside of
Sankey, there are a lot of playmak
ers; that's why Sarkisian moved to
this no-huddle offense in the first
place, because it would emphasize
his skill players over his big guys.
Although Austin Seferian-Jenkins
and Kasen Williams are the biggest
names on offense and are huge
playmakers, someone to keep an
eye on would be Jaydon Mickens.
He's a small guy, but he's fast and
shifty, which makes him perfect for
the Huskies on bubble-screens and
short passes. He wasn't a huge con
tributor last season, but he's really
blossomed in the new offense late
ly in the slot receiver position. Price
dumps the ball off to him, and
Mickens does all the hard work
down the sideline.

DC: Moving to Washington's de
fense, the Huskies gave up only six
points on defense to Stanford last
season. However, this Cardinal of
fense is the farthest thing from the
unit, led by Josh Nunes, that took
on Washington last season. Cardi
nal quarterback Kevin Hogan is a

perfect 9-0 as the starting quarter
back for Stanford, and he brilliantly
exploited the WSU defensive strat
egy by completing long touchdown
passes to Devon Cajuste and
Michael Rector. With the loss of
Desmond Trufant now with the
Atlanta Falcons how can Wash
ington's defense stop an offense
that is running on all cylinders right
now?

TN: If I knew the answer to that, I
wouldn't be sitting at a college
newspaper and I would be on the
sideline next to [defensive coordi
nator] Justin Wilcox.

DC: Do you have any final thoughts
on this contest before we get to
predictions for Saturday's score?

TN: Hit me with the predictions.

DC: My prediction for Saturday's
game is a Stanford victory, as the
Cardinal win 38-21. However, this
score is by no means a negative
comment on Washington. In fact, I
think Washington will have a solid
season after this weekend. Howev
er, Stanford has been nearly flaw
less in its last two games, outside of
a garbage-time quarter that meant
nothing. I believe that seven quar
ters is a large enough sample size
that I can reasonably expect the
Cardinal to play at a national cham
pionship level in this game. If that
happens, I do not believe Washing
ton has any chance of winning this

game on the road.
TN: That's fair enough. I think it's
going to be closer than you, but the
Cardinal take it 41-35. The Huskies
are probably the best they've been
in a long, long time, but it's pretty
clear that Stanford is a national
championship contender and oper
ating at a level that is a little bit
higher than the UW However, if
Stanford is a bit off its game, the
Huskies could jump up and get a
momentum-swinging play that
could change everything. But that's
getting into hypotheticals. I'm defi
nitely with you on home-field ad
vantage for Stanford. The world
outside of Seattle hasn't always
been friendly to the Huskies.

In advance of Saturday's football
game between Stanford and
Washington, The Daily's David
Cohn chatted with Thuc Nhi
Nguyen, sports editor for The
Daily, Washington's student
newspaper, to get perspective
from both camps. Below is a par

go to www.StanfordDaily.com/

David Cohn (DC): My first
question is what are your initial
thoughts on this matchup be
tween UW and Stanford?

True Nhi Nguyen (TN): I think
it should be a good one. Obvi
ously there's that possible re
venge factor with what hap
pened last season at Centu
ry Link. For the Huskies, it's a
chance to prove their worth
against a team that head coach
Steve Sarkisian called a "national
championship contender." It'll
be especially interesting to see if
the Huskies can, on defense,
make the switch back to defend
ing a slower pro-style offense af
ter putting so much effort into
getting better against the no
huddle.

DC: Much has been made about
Washington's struggles, particu
larly on the road in recent years.
Do you think UW has finally
bucked that trend, or is it too
soon to say at this point?

TN: That's a tough one to an
swer because on one hand, yes,
I do feel like this team is leaps
and bounds better than those in

the past. This team definitely has
a certain air around it that sug
gests a maturity and a confi
dence that maybe wasn't there
in the past. Going on the road to

will always hold him under a mi
croscope here, but for now,
Husky Nation is pretty pleased
with him.

DC: Turning to the other con
tributors on offense, Bishop
Sankey is an extremely talented
running back. I would argue that
he has been Washington's most
valuable player over the last year,
and he played an enormous role
in Washington's victory over the
Cardinal at Century Link Field
last season. Outside of Sankey,
can you give me another offen

sive playmaker that Stanford's de
fense should keep an eye on?

TN: Surely, Sankey is a very special
running back. He's a workhorse
and the Huskies are lucky to have
him. For someone outside of
Sankey, there are a lot of playmak
ers; that's why Sarkisian moved to
this no-huddle offense in the first
place, because it would emphasize
his skill players over his big guys.
Although Austin Seferian-Jenkins
and Kasen Williams are the biggest
names on offense and are huge
playmakers, someone to keep an
eye on would be Jaydon Mickens.
He's a small guy, but he's fast and
shifty, which makes him perfect for
the Huskies on bubble-screens and
short passes. He wasn't a huge con
tributor last season, but he's really
blossomed in the new offense late
ly in the slot receiver position. Price
dumps the ball off to him, and
Mickens does all the hard work
down the sideline.

DC: Moving to Washington's de
fense, the Huskies gave up only six
points on defense to Stanford last
season. However, this Cardinal of
fense is the farthest thing from the
unit, led by Josh Nunes, that took
on Washington last season. Cardi
nal quarterback Kevin Hogan is a

perfect 9-0 as the starting quarter
back for Stanford, and he brilliantly
exploited the WSU defensive strat
egy by completing long touchdown
passes to Devon Cajuste and
Michael Rector. With the loss of
Desmond Trufant now with the
Atlanta Falcons how can Wash
ington's defense stop an offense
that is running on all cylinders right
now?

TN: If I knew the answer to that, I
wouldn't be sitting at a college
newspaper and I would be on the
sideline next to [defensive coordi
nator] Justin Wilcox.

DC: Do you have any final thoughts
on this contest before we get to
predictions for Saturday's score?

TN: Hit me with the predictions.

DC: My prediction for Saturday's
game is a Stanford victory, as the
Cardinal win 38-21. However, this
score is by no means a negative
comment on Washington. In fact, I
think Washington will have a solid
season after this weekend. Howev
er, Stanford has been nearly flaw
less in its last two games, outside of
a garbage-time quarter that meant
nothing. I believe that seven quar
ters is a large enough sample size
that I can reasonably expect the
Cardinal to play at a national cham
pionship level in this game. If that
happens, I do not believe Washing
ton has any chance of winning this

game on the road.
TN: That's fair enough. I think it's
going to be closer than you, but the
Cardinal take it 41-35. The Huskies
are probably the best they've been
in a long, long time, but it's pretty
clear that Stanford is a national
championship contender and oper
ating at a level that is a little bit
higher than the UW However, if
Stanford is a bit off its game, the
Huskies could jump up and get a
momentum-swinging play that
could change everything. But that's
getting into hypotheticals. I'm defi
nitely with you on home-field ad
vantage for Stanford. The world
outside of Seattle hasn't always
been friendly to the Huskies.
