# The
						Daily's Pick For: Silicon Valley Restaurant Week
## 
### RENJIE WONG ELLA AITCHESON DESK EDITOR 
We scoped out the restaurants of Sili
con Valley Restaurant Week 2013 and
couldn't decide on just one recommenda
tion. As per tradition, participating Bay Area
restaurants will offer a discounted prix-fixe
menu from Oct. 16-23. Here are our two
top picks for joints to hit up for discount
but still gourmet dining.

MORTON'S STEAKHOUSE

Confession: I love steaks. They're sexy,
sizzling and best experienced with little or
no dressing the criteria for a lifelong
soul mate, basically. If I could get legally
married to a steak in the state of California,
I'd totally ride that gravy train.
But as much as I adore steaks, and as
many times as I have encountered Mor
ton's Steakhouse around the world, I'd nev
er really given the restaurant much serious
thought before. "After all," as a close friend
told me once, "that it is the world's largest
unfranchised steakhouse chain certainly
means that they serve tough, tasteless slabs
of meat." I was perfectly happy remaining
at the restaurant bar for its Happy Hour
anyway.

Which is why, when I sat down in the
Morton's dining room for the first time last
week, I was absolutely blown away. The
handsome wood panelling, dim lighting and
crystal chandeliers certainly made it feel a
lot less like a global restaurant chain and
more like an uptown dining establishment
in 1930's Art Deco Chicago.

"Anyone can buy a New York strip
steak from Safeway and cook it at home,"
said General Manager Margaret Elkins,
"but our customers come back here time
and again for the magical Morton's experi
ence."
Magical indeed and then the food
started coming.
It began with the egg, onion and pop
py seed bread, a hulking loaf of freshly
baked brioche that came with an all-too
knowing warning not to overload on.
After being physically restrained from
funneling the whole thing down my throat,
I moved on to the Morton's salad, an im
pressive mountain of romaine lettuce coat
ed with a blue cheese dressing. Chopped
eggs added subtle textual variation to the

dish, while the brininess of anchovies com
bined with sharp hits from the blue cheese
crumbles elevated the dish to ambrosial
heights.

The highlight of the menu for me, nat
urally, was the 6-ounce single-cut filet
mignon, a fist-sized chunk of incredibly
meaty flavor. As Executive Chef Damien
Duenas explained to me, Morton's Steak
house exclusively uses Midwestern beef
renowned around the world for its rich,
earthy taste sourced from farmers with
whom the restaurant has worked with
since its inception in 1978.
Flawlessly charred on the outside, the
filet mignon yielded under my steak knife
