# The 						Daily's Pick For: Silicon Valley Restaurant Week
## 
### RENJIE WONG ELLA AITCHESON DESK EDITOR 
We scoped out the restaurants of Sili
con Valley Restaurant Week 2013 and
couldn't decide on just one recommenda
tion. As per tradition, participating Bay Area
restaurants will offer a discounted prix-fixe
menu from Oct. 16-23. Here are our two
top picks for joints to hit up for discount
but still gourmet dining.

MORTON'S STEAKHOUSE

Confession: I love steaks. They're sexy,
sizzling and best experienced with little or
no dressing the criteria for a lifelong
soul mate, basically. If I could get legally
married to a steak in the state of California,
I'd totally ride that gravy train.
But as much as I adore steaks, and as
many times as I have encountered Mor
ton's Steakhouse around the world, I'd nev
er really given the restaurant much serious
thought before. "After all," as a close friend
told me once, "that it is the world's largest
unfranchised steakhouse chain certainly
means that they serve tough, tasteless slabs
of meat." I was perfectly happy remaining
at the restaurant bar for its Happy Hour
anyway.

Which is why, when I sat down in the
Morton's dining room for the first time last
week, I was absolutely blown away. The
handsome wood panelling, dim lighting and
crystal chandeliers certainly made it feel a
lot less like a global restaurant chain and
more like an uptown dining establishment
in 1930's Art Deco Chicago.

"Anyone can buy a New York strip
steak from Safeway and cook it at home,"
said General Manager Margaret Elkins,
"but our customers come back here time
and again for the magical Morton's experi
ence."
Magical indeed and then the food
started coming.
It began with the egg, onion and pop
py seed bread, a hulking loaf of freshly
baked brioche that came with an all-too
knowing warning not to overload on.
After being physically restrained from
funneling the whole thing down my throat,
I moved on to the Morton's salad, an im
pressive mountain of romaine lettuce coat
ed with a blue cheese dressing. Chopped
eggs added subtle textual variation to the

dish, while the brininess of anchovies com
bined with sharp hits from the blue cheese
crumbles elevated the dish to ambrosial
heights.

The highlight of the menu for me, nat
urally, was the 6-ounce single-cut filet
mignon, a fist-sized chunk of incredibly
meaty flavor. As Executive Chef Damien
Duenas explained to me, Morton's Steak
house exclusively uses Midwestern beef
renowned around the world for its rich,
earthy taste sourced from farmers with
whom the restaurant has worked with
since its inception in 1978.
Flawlessly charred on the outside, the
filet mignon yielded under my steak knife

to reveal a bright pink center that
was succulent and tender to the
bite. Elkins, a certified sommelier,
recommended veteran vintner Bill
Nancarrow's Duckhorn Decoy
Napa Valley 2010 Cabernet
Sauvignon ($l5 a glass), whose
bold tannins and delicate berry
notes were a veritable match for
the steak's meatiness. Assuaging
the carnivore's guilt was a whole
head of broccoli with Hol
landaise sauce, as well as impossi
bly silky mashed potatoes that
were topped with sour cream and
bacon, and which incidentally also
dealt the final blow to my half
hearted delusion of a low-carb diet.

Expanding its range of culi
nary options, the steakhouse will
also feature non-bovine dishes on
its Restaurant Week Menu. The
deceptively ordinary chicken
bianco pan-seared chicken
breast smothered with tomatoes,
capers, artichokes and a lemon but
ter sauce —was a cosseting slab
of poultry so tender that even I,
usually keeping only to dark meat,
not so much ate it as inhaled it.

The jumbo shrimp Alexan
der, paired with a lush beurre
blanc sauce and basil oil, was a
similarly satisfying combination of
textures and flavors that exploded
across the tongue with every bite.
Both these dishes paired phenom
enally with the effusive Conun
drum California 2011 White
Blend ($l3 a glass) , whose rich
floral bouquet and pear and melon
notes complemented the natural
sweetness of chicken and shrimp.

The homemade double
chocolate mousse, a dense Milky
Way of whipped chocolate cream
and tiny dark chocolate crumbles,
was a perfect conclusion to the
magnificent meal, deftly managing
to avoid the all-too-common pitfall
of being excessively sweet. Paired

with a robust Taylor Fladgate
Late Bottled Vintage Port ($ 11 a
glass) , it made me wonder why I
had been wasting my calories on
gummy premade junk all this time.
Morton's turned out to truly
be one of the finest steakhouse ex
periences I have ever had the priv
ilege of trying. Moral of the story?
Don't listen to your friend's advice
on worldwide steakhouse chains,
no matter how much he thinks he
understands your steak obsession.

LOFT BAR & BISTRO

It's the age-old Friday night
question: What do we do for dinner?
It's too depressing to close an
other week in the dining hall on
some wilting couches with fluores
cent lights; after all, a young per
son's arteries can only take so
much Axe and Palm in any given
week. "The Marguerite?" some
one suggests weakly, rolling over in
bed. Everyone spends a few con
templative moments scrolling up
and down Yelp reviews just to end
up at CoHo an hour later.
It's so easy to get trapped in
the Stanford bubble that we don't
even think about the options off
campus. Silicon Valley, as I discov
ered last week, is a rich place for
all kinds of cuisine, beyond Oren's
Hummus or CREAM.

One of our picks for Silicon
Valley Restaurant Week is Loft Bar
and Bistro, a swanky downtown
joint with two stories and a
rooftop patio just off the Caltrain
station in San Jose.
Near an improv club and a
new EF. Chang's, Loft is part of
the growing movement that's mak
ing downtown San Jose an it-place
to be. If we're advocating that you
not only skip the Marguerite but
wait for eight Caltrain stops, it has

to be something special.

Owner Kam Razavi and Exec
utive Chef Adrian Mullen, room
mates themselves 25 years ago,
know how to make an environ
ment that can suit any college
type. Sit downstairs for a quieter,
more intimate dinner with friends.
Come upstairs on Thursdays
through Sundays for entertain
ment and dancing ranging from
jazz performances to a live DJ. For
the truly elite experience, reserve
the rooftop patio and party like the
Silicon Valley execs do.
From the Silicon Valley
Restaurant Week menu, we bring
you four of our favorites:
For a sweet, smooth, and
summery spread with a crispy
shell, the ahi tuna tartare makes
for a truly breathtaking appetizer.
We enjoyed it with the Great
White, an incredibly refreshing
drink with guava rum that adds
the characteristic berry-like fra

grance of fruit. It's a strong drink
because of the Bacardi 151. If fi
nals didn't knock you out, this
drink might.
Too often prawns are small,
rubbery, and tasteless Loft's
grilled prawn skewers are tender
and well-cooked, a true shout-out
to the San Francisco Bay roots of
the restaurant. We paired it with
the Loft Hurricane a house
special that adds the caramel fla
vor of aged rum, a buttery depth to
the otherwise cloying sweetness
of passion fruit syrup.
The teriyaki short ribs a
personal favorite of Razavi has
tender meat braised for so long
that it literally falls off the bone at
a prod. The Speak Easy brought
this classic home with a clean,
botanical, metallic tang that
bloomed into the creamy warmth
of bourbon, with smoky under-

tones and the unexpected finish of
Madagascan vanilla.

The braised lamb shank, an
other powerful dish, is slow
cooked with garlic and herbs and
served with a side of rich and
creamy mashed potatoes. A Ly
chee Martini completed this
meal, with rose notes from the ly
chee syrup, pineapple and passion
fruit adding a uniquely tropical
touch to the most urbane of
drinks.

If these San Jose classics aren't
enough to drag you off campus on
a Friday, we don't know what will.
Let Silicon Valley Restaurant Week
take you off the Farm and teach
you a little bit about the Valley
around you. Ella Aitcheson

to reveal a bright pink center that
was succulent and tender to the
bite. Elkins, a certified sommelier,
recommended veteran vintner Bill
Nancarrow's Duckhorn Decoy
Napa Valley 2010 Cabernet
Sauvignon ($l5 a glass), whose
bold tannins and delicate berry
notes were a veritable match for
the steak's meatiness. Assuaging
the carnivore's guilt was a whole
head of broccoli with Hol
landaise sauce, as well as impossi
bly silky mashed potatoes that
were topped with sour cream and
bacon, and which incidentally also
dealt the final blow to my half
hearted delusion of a low-carb diet.

Expanding its range of culi
nary options, the steakhouse will
also feature non-bovine dishes on
its Restaurant Week Menu. The
deceptively ordinary chicken
bianco pan-seared chicken
breast smothered with tomatoes,
capers, artichokes and a lemon but
ter sauce —was a cosseting slab
of poultry so tender that even I,
usually keeping only to dark meat,
not so much ate it as inhaled it.

The jumbo shrimp Alexan
der, paired with a lush beurre
blanc sauce and basil oil, was a
similarly satisfying combination of
textures and flavors that exploded
across the tongue with every bite.
Both these dishes paired phenom
enally with the effusive Conun
drum California 2011 White
Blend ($l3 a glass) , whose rich
floral bouquet and pear and melon
notes complemented the natural
sweetness of chicken and shrimp.

The homemade double
chocolate mousse, a dense Milky
Way of whipped chocolate cream
and tiny dark chocolate crumbles,
was a perfect conclusion to the
magnificent meal, deftly managing
to avoid the all-too-common pitfall
of being excessively sweet. Paired

with a robust Taylor Fladgate
Late Bottled Vintage Port ($ 11 a
glass) , it made me wonder why I
had been wasting my calories on
gummy premade junk all this time.
Morton's turned out to truly
be one of the finest steakhouse ex
periences I have ever had the priv
ilege of trying. Moral of the story?

LOFT BAR & BISTRO

It's the age-old Friday night
question: What do we do for dinner?
It's too depressing to close an
other week in the dining hall on
some wilting couches with fluores
cent lights; after all, a young per
son's arteries can only take so
much Axe and Palm in any given
week. "The Marguerite?" some
one suggests weakly, rolling over in
bed. Everyone spends a few con
templative moments scrolling up
and down Yelp reviews just to end
up at CoHo an hour later.
It's so easy to get trapped in
the Stanford bubble that we don't
even think about the options off
campus. Silicon Valley, as I discov
ered last week, is a rich place for
all kinds of cuisine, beyond Oren's
Hummus or CREAM.

One of our picks for Silicon
Valley Restaurant Week is Loft Bar
and Bistro, a swanky downtown
joint with two stories and a
rooftop patio just off the Caltrain
station in San Jose.
Near an improv club and a
new EF. Chang's, Loft is part of
the growing movement that's mak
ing downtown San Jose an it-place
to be. If we're advocating that you
not only skip the Marguerite but
wait for eight Caltrain stops, it has

to be something special.

Owner Kam Razavi and Exec
utive Chef Adrian Mullen, room
mates themselves 25 years ago,
know how to make an environ
ment that can suit any college
type. Sit downstairs for a quieter,
more intimate dinner with friends.
Come upstairs on Thursdays
through Sundays for entertain
ment and dancing ranging from
jazz performances to a live DJ. For
the truly elite experience, reserve
the rooftop patio and party like the
Silicon Valley execs do.
From the Silicon Valley
Restaurant Week menu, we bring
you four of our favorites:
For a sweet, smooth, and
summery spread with a crispy
shell, the ahi tuna tartare makes
for a truly breathtaking appetizer.
We enjoyed it with the Great
White, an incredibly refreshing
drink with guava rum that adds
the characteristic berry-like fra

grance of fruit. It's a strong drink
because of the Bacardi 151. If fi
nals didn't knock you out, this
drink might.
Too often prawns are small,
rubbery, and tasteless Loft's
grilled prawn skewers are tender
and well-cooked, a true shout-out
to the San Francisco Bay roots of
the restaurant. We paired it with
the Loft Hurricane a house
special that adds the caramel fla
vor of aged rum, a buttery depth to
the otherwise cloying sweetness
of passion fruit syrup.
The teriyaki short ribs a
personal favorite of Razavi has
tender meat braised for so long
that it literally falls off the bone at
a prod. The Speak Easy brought
this classic home with a clean,
botanical, metallic tang that
bloomed into the creamy warmth
of bourbon, with smoky under-

tones and the unexpected finish of
Madagascan vanilla.

The braised lamb shank, an
other powerful dish, is slow
cooked with garlic and herbs and
served with a side of rich and
creamy mashed potatoes. A Ly
chee Martini completed this
meal, with rose notes from the ly
chee syrup, pineapple and passion
fruit adding a uniquely tropical
touch to the most urbane of
drinks.

If these San Jose classics aren't
enough to drag you off campus on
a Friday, we don't know what will.
Let Silicon Valley Restaurant Week
take you off the Farm and teach
you a little bit about the Valley
around you. Ella Aitcheson

Loft Bar & Bistro in downtown San Jose is also a participant in this year's Silicon Valley Restaurant Week. Known
for its fresh, California cuisine, the restaurant features live entertainment and dancing. Their prix-fixe menu will
allow diners to try, among other things, specialty cocktails, seafood and their signature teriyaki short ribs.
We scoped out the restaurants of Sili
con Valley Restaurant Week 2013 and
couldn't decide on just one recommenda
tion. As per tradition, participating Bay Area
restaurants will offer a discounted prix-fixe
menu from Oct. 16-23. Here are our two
top picks for joints to hit up for discount
but still gourmet dining.

MORTON'S STEAKHOUSE

Confession: I love steaks. They're sexy,
sizzling and best experienced with little or
no dressing the criteria for a lifelong
soul mate, basically. If I could get legally
married to a steak in the state of California,
I'd totally ride that gravy train.
But as much as I adore steaks, and as
many times as I have encountered Mor
ton's Steakhouse around the world, I'd nev
er really given the restaurant much serious
thought before. "After all," as a close friend
told me once, "that it is the world's largest
unfranchised steakhouse chain certainly
means that they serve tough, tasteless slabs
of meat." I was perfectly happy remaining
at the restaurant bar for its Happy Hour
anyway.

Which is why, when I sat down in the
Morton's dining room for the first time last
week, I was absolutely blown away. The
handsome wood panelling, dim lighting and
crystal chandeliers certainly made it feel a
lot less like a global restaurant chain and
more like an uptown dining establishment
in 1930's Art Deco Chicago.

"Anyone can buy a New York strip
steak from Safeway and cook it at home,"
said General Manager Margaret Elkins,
"but our customers come back here time
and again for the magical Morton's experi
ence."
Magical indeed and then the food
started coming.
It began with the egg, onion and pop
py seed bread, a hulking loaf of freshly
baked brioche that came with an all-too
knowing warning not to overload on.
After being physically restrained from
funneling the whole thing down my throat,
I moved on to the Morton's salad, an im
pressive mountain of romaine lettuce coat
ed with a blue cheese dressing. Chopped
eggs added subtle textual variation to the

dish, while the brininess of anchovies com
bined with sharp hits from the blue cheese
crumbles elevated the dish to ambrosial
heights.

The highlight of the menu for me, nat
urally, was the 6-ounce single-cut filet
mignon, a fist-sized chunk of incredibly
meaty flavor. As Executive Chef Damien
Duenas explained to me, Morton's Steak
house exclusively uses Midwestern beef
renowned around the world for its rich,
earthy taste sourced from farmers with
whom the restaurant has worked with
since its inception in 1978.
Flawlessly charred on the outside, the
filet mignon yielded under my steak knife

one suggests weakly, rolling over in
bed. Everyone spends a few con
templative moments scrolling up
and down Yelp reviews just to end
up at CoHo an hour later.
It's so easy to get trapped in
the Stanford bubble that we don't
even think about the options off
campus. Silicon Valley, as I discov
ered last week, is a rich place for
all kinds of cuisine, beyond Oren's
Hummus or CREAM.

One of our picks for Silicon
Valley Restaurant Week is Loft Bar
and Bistro, a swanky downtown
joint with two stories and a
rooftop patio just off the Caltrain
station in San Jose.
Near an improv club and a
new EF. Chang's, Loft is part of
the growing movement that's mak
ing downtown San Jose an it-place
to be. If we're advocating that you
not only skip the Marguerite but
wait for eight Caltrain stops, it has

to be something special.

Owner Kam Razavi and Exec
utive Chef Adrian Mullen, room
mates themselves 25 years ago,
know how to make an environ
ment that can suit any college
type. Sit downstairs for a quieter,
more intimate dinner with friends.
Come upstairs on Thursdays
through Sundays for entertain
ment and dancing ranging from
jazz performances to a live DJ. For
the truly elite experience, reserve
the rooftop patio and party like the
Silicon Valley execs do.
From the Silicon Valley
Restaurant Week menu, we bring
you four of our favorites:
For a sweet, smooth, and
summery spread with a crispy
shell, the ahi tuna tartare makes
for a truly breathtaking appetizer.
We enjoyed it with the Great
White, an incredibly refreshing
drink with guava rum that adds
the characteristic berry-like fra

grance of fruit. It's a strong drink
because of the Bacardi 151. If fi
nals didn't knock you out, this
drink might.
Too often prawns are small,
rubbery, and tasteless Loft's
grilled prawn skewers are tender
and well-cooked, a true shout-out
to the San Francisco Bay roots of
the restaurant. We paired it with
the Loft Hurricane a house
special that adds the caramel fla
vor of aged rum, a buttery depth to
the otherwise cloying sweetness
of passion fruit syrup.
The teriyaki short ribs a
personal favorite of Razavi has
tender meat braised for so long
that it literally falls off the bone at
a prod. The Speak Easy brought
this classic home with a clean,
botanical, metallic tang that
bloomed into the creamy warmth
of bourbon, with smoky under-

tones and the unexpected finish of
Madagascan vanilla.

The braised lamb shank, an
other powerful dish, is slow
cooked with garlic and herbs and
served with a side of rich and
creamy mashed potatoes. A Ly
chee Martini completed this
meal, with rose notes from the ly
chee syrup, pineapple and passion
fruit adding a uniquely tropical
touch to the most urbane of
drinks.

If these San Jose classics aren't
enough to drag you off campus on
a Friday, we don't know what will.

take you off the Farm and teach
you a little bit about the Valley
around you. Ella Aitcheson

Loft Bar & Bistro in downtown San Jose is also a participant in this year's Silicon Valley Restaurant Week. Known
for its fresh, California cuisine, the restaurant features live entertainment and dancing. Their prix-fixe menu will
allow diners to try, among other things, specialty cocktails, seafood and their signature teriyaki short ribs.
We scoped out the restaurants of Sili
con Valley Restaurant Week 2013 and
couldn't decide on just one recommenda
tion. As per tradition, participating Bay Area
restaurants will offer a discounted prix-fixe
menu from Oct. 16-23. Here are our two
top picks for joints to hit up for discount
but still gourmet dining.

MORTON'S STEAKHOUSE

Confession: I love steaks. They're sexy,
sizzling and best experienced with little or
no dressing the criteria for a lifelong
soul mate, basically. If I could get legally
married to a steak in the state of California,
I'd totally ride that gravy train.
But as much as I adore steaks, and as
many times as I have encountered Mor
ton's Steakhouse around the world, I'd nev
er really given the restaurant much serious
thought before. "After all," as a close friend
told me once, "that it is the world's largest
unfranchised steakhouse chain certainly
means that they serve tough, tasteless slabs
of meat." I was perfectly happy remaining
at the restaurant bar for its Happy Hour
anyway.

Which is why, when I sat down in the
Morton's dining room for the first time last
week, I was absolutely blown away. The
handsome wood panelling, dim lighting and
crystal chandeliers certainly made it feel a
lot less like a global restaurant chain and
more like an uptown dining establishment
in 1930's Art Deco Chicago.

"Anyone can buy a New York strip
steak from Safeway and cook it at home,"
said General Manager Margaret Elkins,
"but our customers come back here time
and again for the magical Morton's experi
ence."
Magical indeed and then the food
started coming.
It began with the egg, onion and pop
py seed bread, a hulking loaf of freshly
baked brioche that came with an all-too
knowing warning not to overload on.
After being physically restrained from
funneling the whole thing down my throat,
I moved on to the Morton's salad, an im
pressive mountain of romaine lettuce coat
ed with a blue cheese dressing. Chopped
eggs added subtle textual variation to the

dish, while the brininess of anchovies com
bined with sharp hits from the blue cheese
crumbles elevated the dish to ambrosial
heights.

The highlight of the menu for me, nat
urally, was the 6-ounce single-cut filet
mignon, a fist-sized chunk of incredibly
meaty flavor. As Executive Chef Damien
Duenas explained to me, Morton's Steak
house exclusively uses Midwestern beef
renowned around the world for its rich,
earthy taste sourced from farmers with
whom the restaurant has worked with
since its inception in 1978.
Flawlessly charred on the outside, the
filet mignon yielded under my steak knife

to reveal a bright pink center that
was succulent and tender to the
bite. Elkins, a certified sommelier,
recommended veteran vintner Bill
Nancarrow's Duckhorn Decoy
Napa Valley 2010 Cabernet
Sauvignon ($l5 a glass), whose
bold tannins and delicate berry
notes were a veritable match for
the steak's meatiness. Assuaging
the carnivore's guilt was a whole
head of broccoli with Hol
landaise sauce, as well as impossi
bly silky mashed potatoes that
were topped with sour cream and
bacon, and which incidentally also
dealt the final blow to my half
hearted delusion of a low-carb diet.

Expanding its range of culi
nary options, the steakhouse will
also feature non-bovine dishes on
its Restaurant Week Menu. The
deceptively ordinary chicken
bianco pan-seared chicken
breast smothered with tomatoes,
capers, artichokes and a lemon but
ter sauce —was a cosseting slab
of poultry so tender that even I,
usually keeping only to dark meat,
not so much ate it as inhaled it.

The jumbo shrimp Alexan
der, paired with a lush beurre
blanc sauce and basil oil, was a
similarly satisfying combination of
textures and flavors that exploded
across the tongue with every bite.
Both these dishes paired phenom
enally with the effusive Conun
drum California 2011 White
Blend ($l3 a glass) , whose rich
floral bouquet and pear and melon
notes complemented the natural
sweetness of chicken and shrimp.

The homemade double
chocolate mousse, a dense Milky
Way of whipped chocolate cream
and tiny dark chocolate crumbles,
was a perfect conclusion to the
magnificent meal, deftly managing
to avoid the all-too-common pitfall
of being excessively sweet. Paired

with a robust Taylor Fladgate
Late Bottled Vintage Port ($ 11 a
glass) , it made me wonder why I
had been wasting my calories on
gummy premade junk all this time.
Morton's turned out to truly
be one of the finest steakhouse ex
periences I have ever had the priv
ilege of trying. Moral of the story?
Don't listen to your friend's advice
on worldwide steakhouse chains,
no matter how much he thinks he
understands your steak obsession.

It's the age-old Friday night
question: What do we do for dinner?
It's too depressing to close an
other week in the dining hall on
some wilting couches with fluores
cent lights; after all, a young per
son's arteries can only take so
much Axe and Palm in any given
week. "The Marguerite?" some
one suggests weakly, rolling over in
bed. Everyone spends a few con
templative moments scrolling up
and down Yelp reviews just to end
