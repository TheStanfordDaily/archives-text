## An epicurian's manifesto on squeamishness "He was a bold man who first ate an oyster," once wrote Jonathan Swift. Yet, in our grocery store society, it seems like that adventurousness has all but vanished. 
### RENJIE WONG DESK EDITOR 
One evening during the summer
in an attempt to reassure my parents that
sending their youngest son off to a private
university in California was indeed a wor
thy investment I showed my mom and
dad some photos I had taken over the
course of my freshman year.
Scrolling through the photos, we
came upon a picture of my birthday dim
sum dinner, and my dad casually pointed
out that my friends all looked (and I quote)
"rather oddly coloured."
Initially dismissing it as his usual old
person casual racism, I took a closer look
at the photo only to find that my
friends' faces did, indeed, all have an odd

ashen cast. I was in the midst of trying to
figure out what was wrong with the
restaurant lighting when I noticed the
platter of kung pao pig intestines on the
table.

In my defence, it was my birthday
dinner, they did ask me to order whatever
I wanted, and I had been craving chitter
lings. I grew up eating them, after all
not to mention the fact that, other than a
couple of vehement protests that I may or
may not have heard, there were clearly no
objections to my ordering it.
In retrospect, I suppose, the horrified
looks around the table as I munched on
the elastic chunks of meat were some
what ominous portents of my friends'

squeamishness.
But this all got me thinking about the
differing cultural standards people hold
with food. Growing up in Singapore, a hy
permodern cosmopolis in the heart of
Asia, I have always been exposed to all
manners of food everything from exot
ic tropical fruits to dubious traditional
remedies (frog ovary soup, anyone?). In
particular, the all-pervading Chinese phi
losophy of waste not, want not has creat
ed a rich cuisine featuring every edible
part of the animal hence my platter of
pig intestines.

And it's not just Asia, either. Last
spring, on a lazy weekend hike in the San

ta Cruz foothills with Nadeem Hussain
'9O, a professor of philosophy, and his
wife, Pauline, we got to discussing the gas
tronomic gulf between her native Lyon

home to 22 Michelin stars and Ameri
ca. In the French city, she said, bouchons
dishing up offal are dime-a-dozen, where
as in most parts of le nouveau monde
one would be hard-pressed to find any
dish even vaguely resembling an animal
part. "You see," she whispered conspirato
rially, "it's almost like Americans are terri
fied of their food."

Clearly one man's meat is another
man's pink slime, as demonstrated by the
mass hysteria that swept across the nation
last year over the media's expose on "lean
finely textured beef" in ground meat. The
bulk of the public's spluttering discontent
or, dare we say, their beef was the
fact that this product is made by centrifu
gally removing fat from beef trimmings,
which often contain cartilage and liga
ments.

"Cartilage and ligaments?" What are

cartilage and ligaments doing in my
food? How dare they add parts of a cow's
meat into other parts of a cow's meat?!
Squeamishness reared its pristine, per
fectly-marbled wagyu head as the country
was divided over a Barbie-pink paste that
had been going into their Big Macs. Mean
while, the French were still roasting their
os a mdelle, the Italians braising their
trippa alia romana, and the Hong
Kongers simmering their beef tendon
soup as they had been doing for the
past millennia or so.
Now, while we at Weekend don't nec
essarily condone the use of pink slime

mislabelling is a particularly problematic
issue in the food industry maybe the
shock and horror that arose is sympto
matic of a people too far removed from its
roots as an agrarian society. Perhaps,
amidst the pampered privilege of having
cling-wrapped, Styrofoam-boxed meats on
supermarket shelves, we have become un
comfortable with the idea that our steak
once mooed, of which something as vis
ceral as pink slime is an intrusive re
minder.

But a little adventurousness never
harmed anybody, and maybe we would all
do well to expand our culinary horizons
beyond just rib-eyes and tenderloins. I
mean, if you were an animal being slaugh
tered, you'd want every last bit of you to
be used, right? In his cookbook "Nose to
Tail Eating," Ferguson Henderson famous
ly wrote: "If you're going to kill the ani
mal, it seems only polite to use the whole
thing."

Perhaps it is time we try to stop being
so queasy about what we eat and open up
our minds and taste buds to unfa
miliar foods. This Silicon Valley Restaurant
Week, why not venture out and pick
something on the menu that you've never
seen before? Yucca mash, kumatoes,
Rocky Mountain oysters: It's a whole new
world of unfamiliar dishes that could well
become your next go-to hangover food.
And then, maybe just maybe,
you'll finally be able to stomach the
thought of eating kung pao pig intestines.
