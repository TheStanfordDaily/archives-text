# Review: "Lady Windermere's Fan" falls flat
## Cal Shakes disappoints in new production of Wilde play 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
The California Shakespeare Theater
has made its name by mounting inventive,
modern productions of classics. Last year's
"Hamlet," directed by Leisl Tommy, man
aged to find a thought-provoking and con
vincing reason for a set consisting of an
empty and rank swimming pool: It provided
the stage with multiple levels and helped
emphasize the meta-theatrical components
of the play. This year's "Romeo and Juliet"
found away for experienced Shakespeare
an actors to convincingly portray teenagers
through movement and voice work and to
use lighting to emphasize the passage of
time and the rashness of the actions.

Given those two successful perform
ances, it was disappointing to find that
Christopher Liam Moore's production of
"Lady Windermere's Fan" was very much
museum theater: competently put togeth
er, but without a fresh take.
The first of Oscar Wilde's four plays,
"Lady Windermere's Fan" often feels like a
first draft for his later and better plays like
"An Ideal Husband" and "The Importance
of Being Earnest." We see the appearance
of what will become stock characters

the nonsense-talking Dandy (Cecil Graham
in "Fan," Algy in "Earnest"), the difficult
aristocratic matriarch (Duchess of Berwick
in "Fan," Lady Bertram in "Earnest"), the
wanton woman (Mrs. Erlynne in "Fan,"
Mrs. Cheevley in "Husband") and the good
and devoted wife who takes a misstep (Lady
Windermere in "Fan," Gertrude in "Hus
band") but the version of them in "Fan"
is less rich than those in the later plays.
When Cecil Graham (Dan Clegg) de-
cries serious moralizing talk
"Now, I never moralize. A man
who moralizes is usually a hyp
ocrite, and a woman who moral
izes is invariably plain" one
can't help but wish we were in
stead hearing Lord Goring pro
claim in "An Ideal Husband," "I
love talking about nothing, father.
It is the only thing I know anything
about."

As the title of the play sug
gests, there is much ado about La
dy Windermere's fan, which ends

up in the wrong place at the
wrong time and could be quite in
criminating. It all begins when the
mysterious Mrs. Erlynne (Stacy
Ross) shows up in town and seems
to be spending too much time
with Lord Windermere (Aldo
Billingslea), causing much gossip.
When his wife, the picture of
womanly perfection good in all
things discovers this (Emily
Kitchens in the most plain role
she's had at CalShakes to date),
she almost considers leaving him,
which sets about a series of mis
taken identities and humorous
plays. But it also leads to a grating
amount of moralizing, despite Ce

cil's early proclamation of how te
dious it is.
Instead of letting the silly ac
tion do the work of satire as he
does in his later plays, Wilde
forces his characters to talk
through their situations too much.
And in Moore's production, the
talk slows down the action, since
it's delivered for maximum dra
matic effect: Occasionally, we for
get we are watching what is meant
to be a comedy, considering how
long it's been since the last laugh.
The cast competently pushes

through a clunky production of a
clunky script: We do laugh at most
of the witticisms, and the charac-

ters are as convincing as the two
dimensional parts will allow them
to be. But rarely does the produc
tion sparkle or provide us with
something unexpected or mod
ern. It is Wilde as one might think
Wilde would have been 100 years
ago, and these portrayed cahrac
ters are not recognizable. The one
exception, and indeed the high
light of the play, is Danny Schie's
Duchess of Berwick, a role he

plays like a drag version of the
Dowager Countess of "Downton
Abbey." Like Maggie Smith, Schie
perfectly projects a mix of snob
bery and self-interest, which in
jects every line with life and hu
mor. He finds the perfect pacing
for everything, and he manages to
move like an elderly woman and
speak in a believably high enough
pitch. It's a stellar performance,
and enough to save the play from
this otherwise flat production.

vincing reason for a set consisting of an
empty and rank swimming pool: It provided
the stage with multiple levels and helped
emphasize the meta-theatrical components
of the play. This year's "Romeo and Juliet"
found away for experienced Shakespeare
an actors to convincingly portray teenagers
through movement and voice work and to
use lighting to emphasize the passage of
time and the rashness of the actions.

Given those two successful perform
ances, it was disappointing to find that
Christopher Liam Moore's production of
"Lady Windermere's Fan" was very much
museum theater: competently put togeth
er, but without a fresh take.
The first of Oscar Wilde's four plays,
"Lady Windermere's Fan" often feels like a
first draft for his later and better plays like
"An Ideal Husband" and "The Importance
of Being Earnest." We see the appearance
of what will become stock characters

the nonsense-talking Dandy (Cecil Graham
in "Fan," Algy in "Earnest"), the difficult
aristocratic matriarch (Duchess of Berwick
in "Fan," Lady Bertram in "Earnest"), the
wanton woman (Mrs. Erlynne in "Fan,"
Mrs. Cheevley in "Husband") and the good
and devoted wife who takes a misstep (Lady
Windermere in "Fan," Gertrude in "Hus
band") but the version of them in "Fan"
is less rich than those in the later plays.
When Cecil Graham (Dan Clegg) de-
cries serious moralizing talk
"Now, I never moralize. A man
who moralizes is usually a hyp
ocrite, and a woman who moral
izes is invariably plain" one
can't help but wish we were in
stead hearing Lord Goring pro
claim in "An Ideal Husband," "I
love talking about nothing, father.
It is the only thing I know anything
about."

As the title of the play sug
gests, there is much ado about La
dy Windermere's fan, which ends

up in the wrong place at the
wrong time and could be quite in
criminating. It all begins when the
mysterious Mrs. Erlynne (Stacy
Ross) shows up in town and seems
to be spending too much time
with Lord Windermere (Aldo
Billingslea), causing much gossip.
When his wife, the picture of
womanly perfection good in all
things discovers this (Emily
Kitchens in the most plain role
she's had at CalShakes to date),
she almost considers leaving him,
which sets about a series of mis
taken identities and humorous
plays. But it also leads to a grating
amount of moralizing, despite Ce

cil's early proclamation of how te
dious it is.
Instead of letting the silly ac
tion do the work of satire as he
does in his later plays, Wilde
forces his characters to talk
through their situations too much.
And in Moore's production, the
talk slows down the action, since
it's delivered for maximum dra
matic effect: Occasionally, we for
get we are watching what is meant
to be a comedy, considering how
long it's been since the last laugh.
The cast competently pushes

through a clunky production of a
clunky script: We do laugh at most
of the witticisms, and the charac-

ters are as convincing as the two
dimensional parts will allow them
to be. But rarely does the produc
tion sparkle or provide us with
something unexpected or mod
ern. It is Wilde as one might think
Wilde would have been 100 years
ago, and these portrayed cahrac
ters are not recognizable. The one
exception, and indeed the high
light of the play, is Danny Schie's
Duchess of Berwick, a role he

plays like a drag version of the
Dowager Countess of "Downton
Abbey." Like Maggie Smith, Schie
perfectly projects a mix of snob
bery and self-interest, which in
jects every line with life and hu
mor. He finds the perfect pacing
for everything, and he manages to
move like an elderly woman and
speak in a believably high enough
pitch. It's a stellar performance,
and enough to save the play from
this otherwise flat production.

The California Shakespeare Theater
has made its name by mounting inventive,
modern productions of classics. Last year's
"Hamlet," directed by Leisl Tommy, man
aged to find a thought-provoking and con
vincing reason for a set consisting of an

the stage with multiple levels and helped
emphasize the meta-theatrical components
