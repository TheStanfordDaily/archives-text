## Jason Collins reflects Discusses time on the Farm and life after coming out 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
When Jason Collins 'Ol announced that he
was gay in a Sports Illustrated cover story ear
lier this year, there was an immediate positive
response from the Stanford community.

Athletic Director Bernard Muir released a
statement applauding "the decision to be
true." Former teammate Mark Madsen 'OO
MBA 'l2 called Collins "one of the greatest
people you will ever meet in your life." And
across campus, students expressed pride that it
was a Stanford man who took the steps to be
come the first openly gay active male athlete in
a major U.S. professional sport.
But 12 years ago, when Collins was lead
ing the Cardinal basketball squad to the Elite 8,
the campus atmosphere was different.

"Now, in 2013, I think that the Stanford
community is extremely supportive but re
member... I was there from 1997-2001,"
Collins said. "American culture has changed, so
I personally wondered whether to publicly ac
knowledge and accept who I truly was back
then in college."
Other Stanford alumni most promi
nently Rachel Maddow '94 have expressed
frustration and disappointment with the way
LGBTQ students were treated while they were
on the Farm.

These problems were particularly pro
nounced within the athletic community. Cyd
Zeigler '95, co-founder of the gay-sports web
site Outsports.com, said that after he came
out, his fraternity brothers from the varsity
wrestling team refused to shake his hand. In
1994, the discrimination reached a head when
a group of Stanford athletes were arrested for
vandalizing a "Gay Liberation" sculpture on

campus.
Because Collins didn't come out until long
after college, he didn't have to face these is
sues while at Stanford. He refers to his basket
ball teammates as "brothers" and counts many
Stanford alumni among his closest friends. In
fact, Collins said that some of the first people
he came out to outside of his family were those
he met at Stanford.

However, Collins said that LGBTQ pres
ence on campus was minimal during his career
when asked, Collins could not recall a single
other LGBTQ athlete. He added that he never
considered coming out during college al
though he thinks his friends would have been
supportive, he said he personally wasn't ready
to make the announcement.

"I describe it as sort of baking in an oven,
as far as getting to the point where you let go
of denial, you let go of bothering, you let go of
shame, you let go of all that [emotion]," Collins
continued. "It's sort of like a 12-step process fi
nally getting to that point of acceptance, and it
took me a very long time to get to that point of
acceptance and that didn't happen until 2009."
Now that he has come out, Collins' life
path has changed. Outside of a few internships
and seminars through the Stanford Business
School and the NBA Players Association,
Collins said he hadn't spent much time think
ing about his post-NBA career before his an
nouncement. His announcement gave him
more focus since April, Collins has been
caught up in a whirlwind of speeches and
events, such as Boston's gay pride parade,
where he marched alongside former Stanford
roommate and current Massachusetts con
gressman Joseph Kennedy 111 'O3, and the Los

Angeles Dodgers' LGBT night,
where he threw out the first

pitch.
"I know that going forward, I
want to keep the conversation go
ing, as far as making it easier for
the next person to go through the
door, "Collins said.
But although Collins has
been busy in his role as an ac
tivist, he is still actively seeking an
NBA job.
NBA preseason camps
opened on Oct. 1, and despite
swirling rumors of interest, no
team has signed Collins yet.

When asked if he thinks the
impact of his announcement
would be diminished if he never

again pulls on an NBA jersey,
Collins answered with an emphat
ic no.

"Even though I wasn't out,"
Collins said, "people can still look
back on my career and see that
this guy played 12 years in the
NBA, that he was a consummate
professional, that [he was] a pro's
pro and constantly sacrificed [his]
personal stats for the sake of the
team."

"My action will have a posi
tive impact on someone else's life
that I may never meet," he said.
"And it's cool for me to know that
something that I've done will
have a positive impact on some
one else's life. It humbles me and
makes me feel so happy."
