# Toronto International Film Festival: tasteful sex or softcore porn?
## 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
When I walked out of the final
screening of "Stranger by the Lake" at
this year's Toronto International Film
Festival, the man sitting behind me
remarked, "So, watching soft-core
porn at TIFF. That's a new experi
ence." And my friend replied,
"Wouldn't be the first time at TIFF...
even this year."

While I wouldn't call the skillful
ly directed and shot "Stranger by the
Lake" pornâ€”the multitude of sex
scenes were key to character devel
opment and developing the eerie
mood it certainly had some of the
most explicit and erotic sex scenes at
the festival and probably answered
any idle question you might have had
about the mechanics of sex between
gay men.

The film takes place on a gay
cruising beach in France, which our
very handsome, but very, very stupid
protagonist Franck frequents daily in
order to have a series of largely anony
mous hookups. Everyone at the
beach is looking, and everyone

knows that the woods behind the
beach is where the sex happens, in
cluding one libidinous man who al
ways appears with his hand on his pe
nis, ready to watch others in the act
while he masturbates.

When one such hookup ends in
murder, and the murderer, Michel,
takes a liking to Franck, it's only a
matter of time before something
bad happens. Unfortunately, Franck
is so frustratingly dim-witted the
first sign being that he doesn't seem
to understand the point of using a
condom when being promiscuous
that despite the many hints
dropped in his lap that Michel is bad
news, including even watching
Michel murder someone, he is nev
er able to pull off his rose-colored
glasses, until, we suspect, it's too
late. Even the beautiful scenery and
still more beautiful actors cannot re
deem the sheer stupidity of the
leads.

Franpois Ozon's latest film,
"Young & Beautiful," was also re
plete with sex scenes, but it worked
because it was accompanied by a
frank examination of adolescent fe

male sexuality. We first meet Isabelle
(the stunning Marine Vacth) just be
fore her 17th birthday, as she takes
care of losing her virginity to a con
venient boy whom she doesn't quite
like. The sex is terrible it's all
about him and somewhere along
the line, she finds herself deciding to
become a prostitute.
Although it's a dangerous thing
to do, the audience can forgive her
stupidity as a symptom of her youth,
especially as Ozon's film explores
many interesting questions. If Is
abelle's experience with sex was
never about her, are her encounters

with clients really that different? At
least with them, she has the advan
tage of not having to worry about
their undesired emotional attach
ment to her, one of the burdens of
sex with the immature men her own
age, and even make some money It's
not that the film condones prostitu
tion or even suggests that she's a
prostitute because she likes sex. In
stead, it explores the limited sexual
options for a young and beautiful
woman, who is always seen by men
as a sexual object and yet expected to
want to form an attachment to the
very men who see her that way.

Twenty-five-year-old Canadian
filmmaker Chloe Robichaud's feature
debut, "Sarah Prefers to Run," which
made its debut at Cannes, was mas
terfully directed, but the script al
lowed for too little character growth.
The best thing about it was the one
very frank and very awkward sex
scene between the probably gay
Sarah (Sophie Desmarais) and her
smitten roommate Antoine (Jean-
Sebastien Courchesne).

town, and they decide to move to

Montreal together to help support each other, as
Sarah wants to run at McGill University and Antoine
wants to try his hand at the big city. Because neither
has any real source of income, Antoine suggests
that they get married for practical reasons: They
would then be eligible for government grants for
married students.

They do, and it's not long before Antoine
starts to develop feelings for Sarah, and Sarah, it
seems, begins to develop feelings for her team
mate Zoey (Genevieve Boivin-Roussy). When An
toine and Sarah do finally have sex in their

kitchen, she initiates it out of curiosity, just trying
to make sure she really doesn't like men. What fol
lows is awkward and horrible. She puts her hand
on his arm, and when he doesn't respond, awk
wardly withdraws. He puts his hand on her thigh,
and then the kissing begins, only her hands are flail
ing, uncertain what to do with them. The camera
holds on Sarah's bored face as she wonders why
she started this and stares off at the pots and pans,
which we see through a shaky camera. It's a perfect
piece of acting and directing, capturing the awk
wardness of sex without also being outlandish, as
"Girls" tends to be.
