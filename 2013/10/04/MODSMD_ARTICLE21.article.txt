# Surviving the Career Fair
## Tricks and tips for navigating a senior's bane of fall quarter 
### DAILY ARTS LIFE STAFF 
Ask any senior what the most traumatic
event of his or her week was, and I bet almost
all respond with just two words: career fair.
Tuesday's event in White Plaza was heralded by
a flurry of nervous questions "How should I
introduce myself?" "Should I wear heels?"
"Which booths are giving out the best swag?"
and a notable lack of paper in Row computer
clusters after a flurry of last-minute resume
printing.

In the aftermath of all the networking, as
students compared free t-shirts and stories of
awkward encounters, the seniors on The Daily
staff came up with a few things we wish some
one had told us before the fair. Juniors, listen
up!

1. There is no need to get really dressed up.
Business casual: the vaguest of terms, and one
that strikes fear into the hearts of college stu
dents who usually go to class in yoga pants. But
don't stress. Yes, look nice. (Shower maybe?
Definitely put on a clean shirt.) Some khakis and
a polo should do it for guys; girls can get away
with nice jeans or a sundress and a sweater. No

need for sky-high heels. The main thing is not to
look sloppy... just please no sweatpants.

2. The people working the booths aren't nec
essarily doing the hiring. I know they look im
pressive and are the sole tangible link to your
dream job, but chances are, the dudes manning
the tables are in human resources or low-level
recruiting managers in other departments
are the ones making the hiring decisions. So, as
satisfying and helpful as it may feel to chat them
up and see them add your resume to the pile,
make sure to check out the company's website
for formal job application forms.

3. Don't try to hit every single booth. First of
all, I'm pretty sure that's physically impossible
there were like 300 of them. But also, try to
look over the list of featured companies the
night before and choose a list of 10 to 15 that
you really want to check out. This focus will give
you a sense of purpose and keep you from get
ting overwhelmed among all the white umbrel
las.

4. However... Be open. Keep looking around as
you move through the fair, and don't be afraid to
go talk to someone friendly at a booth that
catches your eye. It's also okay to talk to people
who don't seem to be recruiting people
from your major fuzzies, even some of
the tech companies all the coders flock to
might be interested in your writing or mar
keting skills. You won't know until you try.

5) And the No. 1 piece of advice: They
want you. I know it feels like this whole
thing is about you trying desperately to im
press big-shot companies in the hopes of
maybe, hopefully, getting a job one day,
but the truth is that they are trying just as
hard to impress you. You are a Stanford
student with all that implies and
you've been working your butt off for the
last three years. Relax, smile confidently
and show those companies why they
would be lucky to have you.
