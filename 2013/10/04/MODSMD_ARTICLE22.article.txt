# Five things to know during Silicon Valley Restaurant Week
## 
### RENJIE WONG DESK EDITOR 
The lands around Stanford are
some of the richest and most indul
gent in the gastronomic world. Be
fore you head out for a week of
restaurant-hopping, here are a few
things you should know about mak
ing the most of your Restaurant Week
experience.

1. Seize the Bay: You can't go to a Bay
Area restaurant and ignore the
seafood it's unthinkable blasphemy
to the High Altar of Your Culinary Nir
vana. The most reliably tasty critter
this time of the year is Dungeness
crab, but spiny lobster, black cod and
clams truly complete a meal. We've
found that Bay Area restaurants have
developed a distinct way of preparing
seafood dishes that is distinctly lighter
on the palate than elsewhere in the
nation. The best part about it though?
It's usually lighter on the wallet, too.

2. Tis the season for veggies: Winter
squash, artichokes and potatoes are
the foods of the fall. If you've never
consciously thought about eating
what's in season (or if it's always bitter
winter where you're from that's
you, Alaska), there's no better place
than the Bay Area to be a fanatical sea
son-vore. For the best artichokes in the
Bay, Loft Bar & Bistro dishes up a mirac
ulously melt-in-your-mouth marinated
fire-roasted artichoke, while surely
the tastiest incarnation of potatoes is
Morton's Steakhouse's sour cream
mashed potatoes.
3. Brussels sprouts are bomb: Now,
we all know how you feel about Brus
sels sprouts it's slimy, suspiciously
eyeball-y and makes you fart the
foulest farts at the most inopportune
of post-dinner times. Absolutely the
foulest! It's pretty much the Veggie
Antichrist. But the Bay Area has one of
the finest climes for growing Brussels

sprouts, and at this time of the year its
flavor reaches its peak, which trans
lates to actually delicious slimy fart
inducing eyeballs being served at
restaurants here. And while not every
joint will have them on the menu,
here's an industry insider's tip: More
likely than not, restaurants will have
them stashed away for the regulars, so
ask for them anyway. You'll be ab
solutely blown away. (As will your sexy
post-dinner plans, unfortunately, but
hey, it's a worthy trade-off.)

4. BYOB: Unlike restaurants and bars
on the East Coast, most places in the
Bay Area are exceedingly diligent with
carding anyone ordering a drink.
Which makes sense, considering how
young and fresh-faced everyone looks
in California (we blame you, Holly
wood). We're not advocating underage
drinking, but if you absolutely must
enjoy your dinner with that delicious
Riesling, throw on a jacket, go with
someone actually over 21, bring your
own bottle and ask the server how
much the corkage is on the way to
your table. It almost always works.

5. Coman Latin American: Tired of all
the Italian and Thai restaurants that the
Bay Area is festooned with? (Not that
we're complaining about that one.) Try
upscale Latin American. You won't be
getting your hangover taco-to-go with
extra guac, and it's not just going to be
clearing out your spare change, either,
but you'll definitely be surprised at the
complexity of flavors and range of dish
es. Silicon Valley Restaurant Week's
lineup offers ample opportunities for
this: Palo Alto's own Reposado is as
good a place to start as any, but if you
want to venture out further, Palacio in
Los Gatos, Mezcal in San Jose and
Ciano's Modern Latin Flavors in
Campbell are phenomenal Bay Area
stars too.
