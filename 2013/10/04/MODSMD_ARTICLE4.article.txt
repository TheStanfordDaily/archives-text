# StAAT seeks safer spaces
## 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
It has been an exciting fall for
Cardinal sports, with the football
team's demolition of Washington
State, the women's soccer team's
thrilling come-from-behind victory
over Santa Clara and the field
hockey team's 366-minute
shutout streak. But there has also
been another exciting change in
Stanford stadiums: the presenta
tion of the "If You Can Play, You
Can Play" video, part of an ongoing
effort to help make the Farm a
safer place for LGBTQ athletes.
The video which will play

at every Cardinal sports venue this
year was produced last spring
by the Stanford Department of
Athletics and Stanford Athletes
and Allies Together (StAAT), a stu
dent group dedicated to support
ing LGBTQ and allied athletes.

Building a foundation
In May 2012, Stanford was
placed on the list of the top 10
most LGBT-friendly colleges for
athletes by Campus Pride, a non
profit supporting LGBT and allied
students on college campuses. Yet
many athletes on the Farm felt
that the recognition was unwar
ranted.

"We didn't feel like we actual
ly deserved it," said Toni Kokenis
'l4, one of the four founders of
StAAT. "We felt like we only got
the award because Stanford itself
is very LGBTQ-friendly, and we
are also one of the best athletic de
partments. It felt like they kind of
just put the two together."
After the announcement, a
group of Stanford alumni, stu
dents and staff members hosted
an event to both celebrate the
award and to start spreading
awareness about the topic.
"We felt that we were pretty
far behind and we kind of used the
event to spark awareness," Koke
nis said. "We wanted to show that
we got this award, and that we
should actually start doing things
to back this up."
Following the momentum of
the event, Kokenis reached out to
Cardinal diver Noah Garcia 'l4
about creating a group focused on
developing a safe community for
LGBTQ athletes.

"This was something that I

had been thinking about for a
while, because there wasn't really
any group on campus that was rep
resentative of who we were," Gar
cia said. "I was sort of afraid to go
out of my way to start thinking
about it or start making anything
happen. Having Toni's initiative re
ally inspired me."
As StAAT was born, Garcia
and Kokenis were joined by
women's club soccer player Annie
Graham 'l4 and women's rugby
player Smriti Sridhar 'l5. Kokenis
also credited the work of older
members in the Stanford commu
nity such as Holly Fetter 'l3, Xan
the Travlos' 11 and Laura Wadden
'O9, for laying the foundation for
the organization.
"We are in a unique situation
of having these cultures of really
good athletics and a really strong
queer community," Graham said.
"I definitely think it's important
that we step up. Because we have
so many talented athletic teams,
we should definitely focus on mak
ing those teams wonderful groups

of open people as well."

Struggles faced

LGBTQ athletes can often
face challenges unique to the lock
er room and team environment.

"There are certain stereo
types that come along with being
an athlete and certain stereotypes
that go along with homosexuality,
and I don't think the two overlap a
lot," said Stanford gymnast Cale
Robinson 'l4. "So I think people
are often kind of taken aback and
shocked when there are gay ath
letes."

These athletes specifically em
phasized the prevalence of gender
stereotypes within their sports.
"Something we have come
across a lot [at StAAT] is that there
is definitely a need to represent
some sort of image of masculinity
or femininity depending on your
gender," Garcia said. "That plays a
big role in feeling comfortable
about revealing some sort of sexu

al orientation and how that might
be associated with being weak."

Kokenis said female athletes
in more masculine sports are of
ten affected by the stereotype that
all really good female athletes
must be lesbians.
"A lot of athletes feel that if
you are LGBTQ, that you need to
hide your sexuality so that you are
not conforming to the stereo
type," Kokenis said. "Or if you are
straight, you need to over-empha
size your femininity to make sure
that you aren't conforming to the
stereotype."
Robinson said that the sport
men's gymnastics has often faced
a perception that it has a lot of gay
athletes.

"I was around this culture up
until the point that I came to Stan
ford, a culture that was hypersen
sitive about being looked at as a
gay sport. There was always a big
effort to do everything we could
to not be seen as a gay sport,"
Robinson said. "I was never com
fortable coming out or anything
like that in club or really in any oth
er environment except for Stan
ford."

The team environment can al
so make coming out more difficult.
Robinson said there is a notion that
if an athlete comes out as gay, then
the whole culture of the locker
room is going to change.
"It's not really an issue that's
talked about, and that silence can
be really scary for an athlete that is
in the closet and not sure how their
teammates and coaches are going to
respond," Kokenis said.

Creating safe spaces

StAAT's main focus has been
on creating safe spaces for all varsi
ty and club teams while also work
ing to make the athletic depart
ment more conscious of LGBTQ

adversities.
Kokenis said that while Stan
ford had a very active and visible
LGBTQ community, that activity
didn't necessarily translate to the
LGBTQ athlete community.
"When we got the award, we
realized that all of these resources
do exist, but very few athletes were
taking advantage of these re
sources," Kokenis said. "We knew
how accepting the overall commu
nity was, but you didn't really get
that feeling of acceptance in the
locker room or in the overall athletic

environment."
StAAT kicked off their cam
paign last fall with a panel of
LGBTQ athletes as part of the
LGBTQ Community Resource Cen
ter's "Safe and Open Spaces at
Stanford" program.
The group then began hosting
weekly meetings for athletes to
share experiences and seek advice.
Some of the discussion topics in
cluded goals for the organization,
ways to help teammates become
better allies and strategies for deal
ing with difficult situations.
In October, Hudson Taylor, a
three-time NCAA Ail-American
wrestler at Maryland and the
founder of the non-profit Athlete Al
ly, came to campus to speak to the

athletic community about the im
portance of athlete allies.
Lexie Ross 'l3, a member of
the women's water polo team, said
Taylor's talk helped initiate a change
in her team environment. After the
speech, Ross said head coach John
Tanner held a meeting with the
team to make clear that any sort of
judgment or discrimination would
not be tolerated.
"It was the first time since I
had been on the team that [Tan
ner] had ever actually acknowl
edged that there were people on
our team that were not exactly
the same as other people," Ross
said. "It was refreshing to know
that he was on that page and that
everyone on the team was on

that same page."

Collaboration with Department
of Athletics

In addition to providing a safe
space for athletes to talk to other
athletes about these issues, StAAT
wanted to make sure there was an
organized effort to speak to the
athletic department about this
topic.

"The athletic department has
so many things to focus on that we
as the students need to be focused
on consistently talking to them
about what we want," Graham
said.

Both sides said the partner
ship has been successful so far.
Senior Associate Athletic Director
Earl Koberlein credited StAAT
with being proactive, organized
and passionate about creating
change, while representatives of
StAAT said that the athletic de
partment was "willing to help [us]
in anyway possible."
Kokenis, who attended the
Nike LGBT "Go Athlete" sports
summit this June, said that after
meeting with LGBTQ student-ath
letes from around the country, she
believed that Stanford has one of
the most supportive athletic de

partments.
"Many athletic departments
were hesitant to support LGBTQ
initiatives because they didn't
want it to appear negatively to
their own image, per se," Kokenis
said. "From what I have heard, we
have the strongest alliance with
our athletic department —we are
actively trying to work with them
and make sure that this is some
thing we are doing together."

ment used their partnership to or

and allies to speak at a coaches' meeting in
the spring.
Additionally, the group handed out
rainbow flags and stickers that they encour
aged coaches and staff to put on their doors
or in their offices.

"StAAT impressed upon us how impor
tant a little thing like a flag or sticker is to a
student," Koberlein said. "We are trying to
make that a priority so they know that we
are a safe place and that there are a lot of
safe places around the athletic department
for students to come to."

For Robinson, this small change made a
big difference. Robinson said that before
StAAT, many student-athletes didn't know if
they could approach their coaches about
challenges related to their sexual identity.
"I know my coach now has a sticker in
his office that says he is an ally and that this
is an LGBT safe area," Robinson said.
"[Coaches] don't necessarily have to sup
port LGBT rights, but I think that every stu
dent-athlete has to know that they are in a
safe place and I think that's what the athlet
ic department is doing right now."
Graham sees the athletic department's
commitment as an important sign of future
leadership.
"If our meeting with the athletics de
partment is any indicator and I think
that it is then Stanford is definitely will
ing to be a leader on this and wants to be a
leader on this," said Graham.

You can play
The 'You Can Play" video was also a
joint effort between StAAT and the Depart
ment of Athletics. The video has either a
coach or player from every team on campus
to help share the message that "If you can
play, you can play," regardless of gender or
sexual identity.

Koberlein said the video which also
includes representatives of athlete support
services such as the weight room and the
Athlete Resource Center (ARC) —is an im
portant representation of Stanford's sup
portive position.

"We're throwing [the You Can Play

video] out there; we are really making that
a priority, to be accepting and that some
one's sexual orientation is not going to be a
negative," Koberlein said. "I think publiciz
ing that is a step in that direction."

What the future holds
While most athletes said their overall
experience at Stanford has been positive,
both the athletic department and StAAT ex
pressed a desire to continue improving sup
port networks and leading the charge for
universities across the country.
"Spreading awareness about the issue
and education will be our main goal," said
Kokenis. "We are trying to get more people
involved by either just knowing that we ex
ist as a resource or if they have a teammate
that comes out to them that we are a
place where an athlete or ally can go."
StAAT will continue having weekly
meetings this year as well as the safe spaces
panel. Additionally, StAAT hopes to build off
of an idea spawned at UCLA and host an
athlete-ally week filled with high profile
speakers and events.

Another potential idea is a field day in
the spring for athletes focused on the issue
of inclusion. The idea would be to bring
athletes together regardless of sexual ori
entation, race, religion or other dividing
factors.

"From where we were a few years ago
to where we ended this year, we have
made huge strides," Kokenis said. "A lot of
that has to do with how supportive the ath
letic department has been. Obviously, we
still have a lot of work to do but we are re
ally optimistic and hopeful based on how last
year ended."

sources," Kokenis said. "We knew
how accepting the overall commu
nity was, but you didn't really get
that feeling of acceptance in the
locker room or in the overall athletic

environment."
StAAT kicked off their cam
paign last fall with a panel of
LGBTQ athletes as part of the
LGBTQ Community Resource Cen
ter's "Safe and Open Spaces at
Stanford" program.
The group then began hosting
weekly meetings for athletes to
share experiences and seek advice.
Some of the discussion topics in
cluded goals for the organization,
ways to help teammates become
better allies and strategies for deal
ing with difficult situations.
In October, Hudson Taylor, a
three-time NCAA Ail-American
wrestler at Maryland and the
founder of the non-profit Athlete Al
ly, came to campus to speak to the

athletic community about the im
portance of athlete allies.
Lexie Ross 'l3, a member of
the women's water polo team, said
Taylor's talk helped initiate a change
in her team environment. After the
speech, Ross said head coach John
Tanner held a meeting with the
team to make clear that any sort of
judgment or discrimination would
not be tolerated.
"It was the first time since I
had been on the team that [Tan
ner] had ever actually acknowl
edged that there were people on
our team that were not exactly
the same as other people," Ross
said. "It was refreshing to know
that he was on that page and that
everyone on the team was on

that same page."

Collaboration with Department
of Athletics

In addition to providing a safe
space for athletes to talk to other
athletes about these issues, StAAT
wanted to make sure there was an
organized effort to speak to the
athletic department about this
topic.

"The athletic department has
so many things to focus on that we
as the students need to be focused
on consistently talking to them
about what we want," Graham
said.

Both sides said the partner
ship has been successful so far.
Senior Associate Athletic Director
Earl Koberlein credited StAAT
with being proactive, organized
and passionate about creating
change, while representatives of
StAAT said that the athletic de
partment was "willing to help [us]
in anyway possible."
Kokenis, who attended the
Nike LGBT "Go Athlete" sports
summit this June, said that after
meeting with LGBTQ student-ath
letes from around the country, she
believed that Stanford has one of
the most supportive athletic de

partments.
"Many athletic departments
were hesitant to support LGBTQ
initiatives because they didn't
want it to appear negatively to
their own image, per se," Kokenis
said. "From what I have heard, we
have the strongest alliance with
our athletic department —we are
actively trying to work with them
and make sure that this is some
thing we are doing together."

and allies to speak at a coaches' meeting in
the spring.
Additionally, the group handed out
rainbow flags and stickers that they encour
aged coaches and staff to put on their doors
or in their offices.

"StAAT impressed upon us how impor
tant a little thing like a flag or sticker is to a
student," Koberlein said. "We are trying to
make that a priority so they know that we
are a safe place and that there are a lot of
safe places around the athletic department
for students to come to."

For Robinson, this small change made a
big difference. Robinson said that before
StAAT, many student-athletes didn't know if
they could approach their coaches about
challenges related to their sexual identity.
"I know my coach now has a sticker in
his office that says he is an ally and that this
is an LGBT safe area," Robinson said.
"[Coaches] don't necessarily have to sup
port LGBT rights, but I think that every stu
dent-athlete has to know that they are in a
safe place and I think that's what the athlet
ic department is doing right now."
Graham sees the athletic department's
commitment as an important sign of future
leadership.
"If our meeting with the athletics de
partment is any indicator and I think
that it is then Stanford is definitely will
ing to be a leader on this and wants to be a
leader on this," said Graham.

You can play
The 'You Can Play" video was also a
joint effort between StAAT and the Depart
ment of Athletics. The video has either a
coach or player from every team on campus
to help share the message that "If you can
play, you can play," regardless of gender or
sexual identity.

Koberlein said the video which also
includes representatives of athlete support
services such as the weight room and the
Athlete Resource Center (ARC) —is an im
portant representation of Stanford's sup
portive position.

"We're throwing [the You Can Play

video] out there; we are really making that
a priority, to be accepting and that some
one's sexual orientation is not going to be a
negative," Koberlein said. "I think publiciz
ing that is a step in that direction."

What the future holds
While most athletes said their overall
experience at Stanford has been positive,
both the athletic department and StAAT ex
pressed a desire to continue improving sup
port networks and leading the charge for
universities across the country.
"Spreading awareness about the issue
and education will be our main goal," said
Kokenis. "We are trying to get more people
involved by either just knowing that we ex
ist as a resource or if they have a teammate
that comes out to them that we are a
place where an athlete or ally can go."
StAAT will continue having weekly
meetings this year as well as the safe spaces
panel. Additionally, StAAT hopes to build off
of an idea spawned at UCLA and host an
athlete-ally week filled with high profile
speakers and events.

Another potential idea is a field day in
the spring for athletes focused on the issue
of inclusion. The idea would be to bring
athletes together regardless of sexual ori
entation, race, religion or other dividing
factors.

"From where we were a few years ago
to where we ended this year, we have
made huge strides," Kokenis said. "A lot of
that has to do with how supportive the ath
letic department has been. Obviously, we
still have a lot of work to do but we are re
ally optimistic and hopeful based on how last
year ended."

It has been an exciting fall for
Cardinal sports, with the football
team's demolition of Washington
State, the women's soccer team's
thrilling come-from-behind victory
over Santa Clara and the field
hockey team's 366-minute
shutout streak. But there has also
been another exciting change in
Stanford stadiums: the presenta
tion of the "If You Can Play, You
Can Play" video, part of an ongoing
effort to help make the Farm a
safer place for LGBTQ athletes.
The video which will play

at every Cardinal sports venue this
year was produced last spring
by the Stanford Department of
Athletics and Stanford Athletes
and Allies Together (StAAT), a stu
dent group dedicated to support
ing LGBTQ and allied athletes.

Building a foundation
In May 2012, Stanford was
placed on the list of the top 10
most LGBT-friendly colleges for
athletes by Campus Pride, a non
profit supporting LGBT and allied
students on college campuses. Yet
many athletes on the Farm felt
that the recognition was unwar
ranted.

"We didn't feel like we actual
ly deserved it," said Toni Kokenis
'l4, one of the four founders of
StAAT. "We felt like we only got
the award because Stanford itself
is very LGBTQ-friendly, and we
are also one of the best athletic de
partments. It felt like they kind of
just put the two together."
After the announcement, a
group of Stanford alumni, stu
dents and staff members hosted
an event to both celebrate the
award and to start spreading
awareness about the topic.
"We felt that we were pretty
far behind and we kind of used the
event to spark awareness," Koke
nis said. "We wanted to show that
we got this award, and that we
should actually start doing things
to back this up."
Following the momentum of
the event, Kokenis reached out to
Cardinal diver Noah Garcia 'l4
about creating a group focused on
developing a safe community for
LGBTQ athletes.

"This was something that I

had been thinking about for a
while, because there wasn't really
any group on campus that was rep
resentative of who we were," Gar
cia said. "I was sort of afraid to go
out of my way to start thinking
about it or start making anything
happen. Having Toni's initiative re
ally inspired me."
As StAAT was born, Garcia
and Kokenis were joined by
women's club soccer player Annie
Graham 'l4 and women's rugby
player Smriti Sridhar 'l5. Kokenis
also credited the work of older
members in the Stanford commu
nity such as Holly Fetter 'l3, Xan
the Travlos' 11 and Laura Wadden
'O9, for laying the foundation for
the organization.
"We are in a unique situation
of having these cultures of really
good athletics and a really strong
queer community," Graham said.
"I definitely think it's important
that we step up. Because we have
so many talented athletic teams,
we should definitely focus on mak
ing those teams wonderful groups

of open people as well."

Struggles faced

LGBTQ athletes can often
face challenges unique to the lock
er room and team environment.

"There are certain stereo
types that come along with being
an athlete and certain stereotypes
that go along with homosexuality,
and I don't think the two overlap a
lot," said Stanford gymnast Cale
Robinson 'l4. "So I think people
are often kind of taken aback and
shocked when there are gay ath
letes."

These athletes specifically em
phasized the prevalence of gender
stereotypes within their sports.
"Something we have come
across a lot [at StAAT] is that there
is definitely a need to represent
some sort of image of masculinity
or femininity depending on your
gender," Garcia said. "That plays a
big role in feeling comfortable
about revealing some sort of sexu

and Allies Together (StAAT), which works to create awareness and build support for LGBTQ and allied athletes.
al orientation and how that might
be associated with being weak."

Kokenis said female athletes
in more masculine sports are of
ten affected by the stereotype that
all really good female athletes
must be lesbians.
"A lot of athletes feel that if
you are LGBTQ, that you need to
hide your sexuality so that you are
not conforming to the stereo
type," Kokenis said. "Or if you are
straight, you need to over-empha
size your femininity to make sure
that you aren't conforming to the
stereotype."
Robinson said that the sport
men's gymnastics has often faced
a perception that it has a lot of gay
athletes.

"I was around this culture up
until the point that I came to Stan
ford, a culture that was hypersen
sitive about being looked at as a
gay sport. There was always a big
effort to do everything we could
to not be seen as a gay sport,"
Robinson said. "I was never com
fortable coming out or anything
like that in club or really in any oth
er environment except for Stan
ford."

The team environment can al
so make coming out more difficult.
Robinson said there is a notion that
if an athlete comes out as gay, then
the whole culture of the locker
room is going to change.
"It's not really an issue that's
talked about, and that silence can
be really scary for an athlete that is
in the closet and not sure how their
teammates and coaches are going to
respond," Kokenis said.

Creating safe spaces

StAAT's main focus has been
on creating safe spaces for all varsi
ty and club teams while also work
ing to make the athletic depart
ment more conscious of LGBTQ

adversities.
Kokenis said that while Stan
ford had a very active and visible
LGBTQ community, that activity
didn't necessarily translate to the
LGBTQ athlete community.
"When we got the award, we
realized that all of these resources
do exist, but very few athletes were
taking advantage of these re
sources," Kokenis said. "We knew
how accepting the overall commu
nity was, but you didn't really get
that feeling of acceptance in the
locker room or in the overall athletic

environment."
StAAT kicked off their cam

of inclusion. The idea would be to bring
athletes together regardless of sexual ori
entation, race, religion or other dividing
factors.

"From where we were a few years ago
to where we ended this year, we have
made huge strides," Kokenis said. "A lot of
that has to do with how supportive the ath
letic department has been. Obviously, we
still have a lot of work to do but we are re
ally optimistic and hopeful based on how last
year ended."

It has been an exciting fall for
Cardinal sports, with the football
team's demolition of Washington
State, the women's soccer team's
thrilling come-from-behind victory
over Santa Clara and the field
hockey team's 366-minute
shutout streak. But there has also
been another exciting change in
Stanford stadiums: the presenta
tion of the "If You Can Play, You
Can Play" video, part of an ongoing
effort to help make the Farm a
safer place for LGBTQ athletes.
The video which will play

at every Cardinal sports venue this
year was produced last spring
by the Stanford Department of
Athletics and Stanford Athletes
and Allies Together (StAAT), a stu
dent group dedicated to support
ing LGBTQ and allied athletes.

Building a foundation
In May 2012, Stanford was
placed on the list of the top 10
most LGBT-friendly colleges for
athletes by Campus Pride, a non
profit supporting LGBT and allied
students on college campuses. Yet
many athletes on the Farm felt
that the recognition was unwar
ranted.

"We didn't feel like we actual
ly deserved it," said Toni Kokenis
'l4, one of the four founders of
StAAT. "We felt like we only got
the award because Stanford itself
is very LGBTQ-friendly, and we
are also one of the best athletic de
partments. It felt like they kind of
just put the two together."
After the announcement, a
group of Stanford alumni, stu
dents and staff members hosted
an event to both celebrate the
award and to start spreading
awareness about the topic.
"We felt that we were pretty
far behind and we kind of used the
event to spark awareness," Koke
nis said. "We wanted to show that
we got this award, and that we
should actually start doing things
to back this up."
Following the momentum of
the event, Kokenis reached out to
Cardinal diver Noah Garcia 'l4
about creating a group focused on
developing a safe community for
LGBTQ athletes.

"This was something that I

had been thinking about for a
while, because there wasn't really
any group on campus that was rep
resentative of who we were," Gar
cia said. "I was sort of afraid to go
out of my way to start thinking
about it or start making anything
happen. Having Toni's initiative re
ally inspired me."
As StAAT was born, Garcia
and Kokenis were joined by
women's club soccer player Annie
Graham 'l4 and women's rugby
player Smriti Sridhar 'l5. Kokenis
also credited the work of older
members in the Stanford commu
nity such as Holly Fetter 'l3, Xan
the Travlos' 11 and Laura Wadden
'O9, for laying the foundation for
the organization.
"We are in a unique situation
of having these cultures of really
good athletics and a really strong
queer community," Graham said.
"I definitely think it's important
that we step up. Because we have
so many talented athletic teams,
we should definitely focus on mak
ing those teams wonderful groups

of open people as well."

Struggles faced

LGBTQ athletes can often
face challenges unique to the lock
er room and team environment.

"There are certain stereo
types that come along with being
an athlete and certain stereotypes
that go along with homosexuality,
and I don't think the two overlap a
lot," said Stanford gymnast Cale
Robinson 'l4. "So I think people
are often kind of taken aback and
shocked when there are gay ath
letes."

These athletes specifically em
phasized the prevalence of gender
stereotypes within their sports.
"Something we have come
across a lot [at StAAT] is that there
is definitely a need to represent
some sort of image of masculinity
or femininity depending on your
gender," Garcia said. "That plays a
big role in feeling comfortable
about revealing some sort of sexu

and Allies Together (StAAT), which works to create awareness and build support for LGBTQ and allied athletes.
al orientation and how that might
be associated with being weak."

Kokenis said female athletes
in more masculine sports are of
ten affected by the stereotype that
all really good female athletes
must be lesbians.
"A lot of athletes feel that if
you are LGBTQ, that you need to
hide your sexuality so that you are
not conforming to the stereo
type," Kokenis said. "Or if you are
straight, you need to over-empha
size your femininity to make sure
that you aren't conforming to the
stereotype."
Robinson said that the sport
men's gymnastics has often faced
a perception that it has a lot of gay
athletes.

"I was around this culture up
until the point that I came to Stan
ford, a culture that was hypersen
sitive about being looked at as a
gay sport. There was always a big
effort to do everything we could
to not be seen as a gay sport,"
Robinson said. "I was never com
fortable coming out or anything
like that in club or really in any oth
er environment except for Stan
ford."

The team environment can al
so make coming out more difficult.
Robinson said there is a notion that
if an athlete comes out as gay, then
the whole culture of the locker
room is going to change.
"It's not really an issue that's
talked about, and that silence can
be really scary for an athlete that is
in the closet and not sure how their
teammates and coaches are going to
respond," Kokenis said.

Creating safe spaces

StAAT's main focus has been
on creating safe spaces for all varsi
ty and club teams while also work
ing to make the athletic depart
ment more conscious of LGBTQ

adversities.
Kokenis said that while Stan
ford had a very active and visible
LGBTQ community, that activity
didn't necessarily translate to the
LGBTQ athlete community.
"When we got the award, we
realized that all of these resources
do exist, but very few athletes were
taking advantage of these re
sources," Kokenis said. "We knew
how accepting the overall commu
nity was, but you didn't really get
that feeling of acceptance in the
locker room or in the overall athletic

environment."
StAAT kicked off their cam
paign last fall with a panel of
LGBTQ athletes as part of the
LGBTQ Community Resource Cen
ter's "Safe and Open Spaces at
Stanford" program.
The group then began hosting
weekly meetings for athletes to
share experiences and seek advice.
Some of the discussion topics in
cluded goals for the organization,
ways to help teammates become
better allies and strategies for deal
ing with difficult situations.
In October, Hudson Taylor, a
three-time NCAA Ail-American
wrestler at Maryland and the
founder of the non-profit Athlete Al
ly, came to campus to speak to the

athletic community about the im
portance of athlete allies.
Lexie Ross 'l3, a member of
the women's water polo team, said
Taylor's talk helped initiate a change
in her team environment. After the
speech, Ross said head coach John
Tanner held a meeting with the
team to make clear that any sort of
judgment or discrimination would
not be tolerated.
"It was the first time since I
had been on the team that [Tan
ner] had ever actually acknowl
edged that there were people on
our team that were not exactly
the same as other people," Ross
said. "It was refreshing to know
that he was on that page and that
everyone on the team was on

that same page."

Collaboration with Department
of Athletics

In addition to providing a safe
space for athletes to talk to other
athletes about these issues, StAAT
wanted to make sure there was an
organized effort to speak to the
athletic department about this
topic.

"The athletic department has
so many things to focus on that we
as the students need to be focused
on consistently talking to them
about what we want," Graham
said.

Both sides said the partner
ship has been successful so far.
Senior Associate Athletic Director
Earl Koberlein credited StAAT
with being proactive, organized
and passionate about creating
change, while representatives of
StAAT said that the athletic de
partment was "willing to help [us]
in anyway possible."
Kokenis, who attended the
Nike LGBT "Go Athlete" sports
summit this June, said that after
meeting with LGBTQ student-ath
letes from around the country, she
believed that Stanford has one of
the most supportive athletic de

partments.
"Many athletic departments
were hesitant to support LGBTQ
initiatives because they didn't
want it to appear negatively to
their own image, per se," Kokenis
said. "From what I have heard, we
have the strongest alliance with
our athletic department —we are
actively trying to work with them
and make sure that this is some
thing we are doing together."
StAAT and the athletic depart
ment used their partnership to or

and held meetings like the one pictured above, the support system for LGBTQ athletes was lacking.
and allies to speak at a coaches' meeting in
the spring.
Additionally, the group handed out
rainbow flags and stickers that they encour
aged coaches and staff to put on their doors
or in their offices.

"StAAT impressed upon us how impor
tant a little thing like a flag or sticker is to a
student," Koberlein said. "We are trying to
make that a priority so they know that we
are a safe place and that there are a lot of
safe places around the athletic department
for students to come to."

For Robinson, this small change made a
big difference. Robinson said that before
StAAT, many student-athletes didn't know if
they could approach their coaches about
challenges related to their sexual identity.
"I know my coach now has a sticker in
his office that says he is an ally and that this
is an LGBT safe area," Robinson said.
"[Coaches] don't necessarily have to sup
port LGBT rights, but I think that every stu
dent-athlete has to know that they are in a
safe place and I think that's what the athlet
ic department is doing right now."
Graham sees the athletic department's
commitment as an important sign of future
leadership.
"If our meeting with the athletics de
partment is any indicator and I think
that it is then Stanford is definitely will
ing to be a leader on this and wants to be a
leader on this," said Graham.

You can play
The 'You Can Play" video was also a
joint effort between StAAT and the Depart
ment of Athletics. The video has either a
coach or player from every team on campus
to help share the message that "If you can
play, you can play," regardless of gender or
sexual identity.

Koberlein said the video which also
includes representatives of athlete support
services such as the weight room and the
Athlete Resource Center (ARC) —is an im
portant representation of Stanford's sup
portive position.

"We're throwing [the You Can Play

video] out there; we are really making that
a priority, to be accepting and that some
one's sexual orientation is not going to be a
negative," Koberlein said. "I think publiciz
ing that is a step in that direction."

What the future holds
While most athletes said their overall
experience at Stanford has been positive,
both the athletic department and StAAT ex
pressed a desire to continue improving sup
port networks and leading the charge for
universities across the country.
"Spreading awareness about the issue
and education will be our main goal," said
Kokenis. "We are trying to get more people
involved by either just knowing that we ex
ist as a resource or if they have a teammate
that comes out to them that we are a
place where an athlete or ally can go."
StAAT will continue having weekly
meetings this year as well as the safe spaces
panel. Additionally, StAAT hopes to build off
of an idea spawned at UCLA and host an
athlete-ally week filled with high profile
speakers and events.

Another potential idea is a field day in
the spring for athletes focused on the issue
of inclusion. The idea would be to bring
athletes together regardless of sexual ori
entation, race, religion or other dividing
factors.

"From where we were a few years ago
to where we ended this year, we have

respond," Kokenis said.

Creating safe spaces

StAAT's main focus has been
on creating safe spaces for all varsi
ty and club teams while also work
ing to make the athletic depart
ment more conscious of LGBTQ

adversities.
Kokenis said that while Stan
ford had a very active and visible
LGBTQ community, that activity
didn't necessarily translate to the
LGBTQ athlete community.
"When we got the award, we
realized that all of these resources
do exist, but very few athletes were
taking advantage of these re
sources," Kokenis said. "We knew
how accepting the overall commu
nity was, but you didn't really get
that feeling of acceptance in the
locker room or in the overall athletic

environment."
StAAT kicked off their cam
paign last fall with a panel of
LGBTQ athletes as part of the
LGBTQ Community Resource Cen
ter's "Safe and Open Spaces at
Stanford" program.
The group then began hosting
weekly meetings for athletes to
share experiences and seek advice.
Some of the discussion topics in
cluded goals for the organization,
ways to help teammates become
better allies and strategies for deal
ing with difficult situations.
In October, Hudson Taylor, a
three-time NCAA Ail-American
wrestler at Maryland and the
founder of the non-profit Athlete Al
ly, came to campus to speak to the

athletic community about the im
portance of athlete allies.
Lexie Ross 'l3, a member of
the women's water polo team, said
Taylor's talk helped initiate a change
in her team environment. After the
speech, Ross said head coach John
Tanner held a meeting with the
team to make clear that any sort of
judgment or discrimination would
not be tolerated.
"It was the first time since I
had been on the team that [Tan
ner] had ever actually acknowl
edged that there were people on
our team that were not exactly
the same as other people," Ross
said. "It was refreshing to know
that he was on that page and that
everyone on the team was on

that same page."

Collaboration with Department
of Athletics

In addition to providing a safe
space for athletes to talk to other
athletes about these issues, StAAT
wanted to make sure there was an
organized effort to speak to the
athletic department about this
topic.

"The athletic department has
so many things to focus on that we
as the students need to be focused
on consistently talking to them
about what we want," Graham
said.

Both sides said the partner
ship has been successful so far.
Senior Associate Athletic Director
Earl Koberlein credited StAAT
with being proactive, organized
and passionate about creating
change, while representatives of
StAAT said that the athletic de
partment was "willing to help [us]
in anyway possible."
Kokenis, who attended the
Nike LGBT "Go Athlete" sports
summit this June, said that after
meeting with LGBTQ student-ath
letes from around the country, she
believed that Stanford has one of
the most supportive athletic de

partments.
"Many athletic departments
were hesitant to support LGBTQ
initiatives because they didn't
want it to appear negatively to
their own image, per se," Kokenis
said. "From what I have heard, we
have the strongest alliance with
our athletic department —we are
actively trying to work with them
and make sure that this is some
thing we are doing together."

and allies to speak at a coaches' meeting in
the spring.
Additionally, the group handed out
rainbow flags and stickers that they encour
aged coaches and staff to put on their doors
or in their offices.

"StAAT impressed upon us how impor
tant a little thing like a flag or sticker is to a
student," Koberlein said. "We are trying to
make that a priority so they know that we
are a safe place and that there are a lot of
safe places around the athletic department
for students to come to."

For Robinson, this small change made a
big difference. Robinson said that before
StAAT, many student-athletes didn't know if
they could approach their coaches about
challenges related to their sexual identity.
"I know my coach now has a sticker in
his office that says he is an ally and that this
is an LGBT safe area," Robinson said.
"[Coaches] don't necessarily have to sup
port LGBT rights, but I think that every stu
dent-athlete has to know that they are in a
safe place and I think that's what the athlet
ic department is doing right now."
Graham sees the athletic department's
commitment as an important sign of future
leadership.
"If our meeting with the athletics de
partment is any indicator and I think
that it is then Stanford is definitely will
ing to be a leader on this and wants to be a
leader on this," said Graham.

You can play
The 'You Can Play" video was also a
joint effort between StAAT and the Depart
ment of Athletics. The video has either a
coach or player from every team on campus
to help share the message that "If you can
play, you can play," regardless of gender or
sexual identity.

Koberlein said the video which also
includes representatives of athlete support
services such as the weight room and the
Athlete Resource Center (ARC) —is an im
portant representation of Stanford's sup
portive position.

"We're throwing [the You Can Play

video] out there; we are really making that
a priority, to be accepting and that some
one's sexual orientation is not going to be a
negative," Koberlein said. "I think publiciz
ing that is a step in that direction."

What the future holds
While most athletes said their overall
experience at Stanford has been positive,
both the athletic department and StAAT ex
pressed a desire to continue improving sup
port networks and leading the charge for
universities across the country.
"Spreading awareness about the issue
and education will be our main goal," said
Kokenis. "We are trying to get more people
involved by either just knowing that we ex
ist as a resource or if they have a teammate
that comes out to them that we are a
place where an athlete or ally can go."
StAAT will continue having weekly
meetings this year as well as the safe spaces
panel. Additionally, StAAT hopes to build off
of an idea spawned at UCLA and host an
athlete-ally week filled with high profile
speakers and events.

Another potential idea is a field day in
the spring for athletes focused on the issue
of inclusion. The idea would be to bring
athletes together regardless of sexual ori
entation, race, religion or other dividing
factors.

"From where we were a few years ago
to where we ended this year, we have
made huge strides," Kokenis said. "A lot of
that has to do with how supportive the ath
letic department has been. Obviously, we
still have a lot of work to do but we are re
ally optimistic and hopeful based on how last
year ended."

It has been an exciting fall for
Cardinal sports, with the football
team's demolition of Washington
State, the women's soccer team's
thrilling come-from-behind victory
over Santa Clara and the field
hockey team's 366-minute
shutout streak. But there has also
been another exciting change in
Stanford stadiums: the presenta
tion of the "If You Can Play, You
Can Play" video, part of an ongoing
effort to help make the Farm a
safer place for LGBTQ athletes.
The video which will play

at every Cardinal sports venue this
year was produced last spring
by the Stanford Department of
Athletics and Stanford Athletes
and Allies Together (StAAT), a stu
dent group dedicated to support
ing LGBTQ and allied athletes.

Building a foundation
In May 2012, Stanford was
placed on the list of the top 10
most LGBT-friendly colleges for
athletes by Campus Pride, a non
profit supporting LGBT and allied
students on college campuses. Yet
many athletes on the Farm felt
that the recognition was unwar
ranted.

"We didn't feel like we actual
ly deserved it," said Toni Kokenis
'l4, one of the four founders of
StAAT. "We felt like we only got
the award because Stanford itself
is very LGBTQ-friendly, and we
are also one of the best athletic de
partments. It felt like they kind of
just put the two together."
After the announcement, a
group of Stanford alumni, stu
dents and staff members hosted
an event to both celebrate the
award and to start spreading
awareness about the topic.
"We felt that we were pretty
far behind and we kind of used the
event to spark awareness," Koke
nis said. "We wanted to show that
we got this award, and that we
should actually start doing things
to back this up."
Following the momentum of
the event, Kokenis reached out to
Cardinal diver Noah Garcia 'l4
about creating a group focused on
developing a safe community for
LGBTQ athletes.

"This was something that I

had been thinking about for a
while, because there wasn't really
any group on campus that was rep
resentative of who we were," Gar
cia said. "I was sort of afraid to go
out of my way to start thinking
about it or start making anything
happen. Having Toni's initiative re
ally inspired me."
As StAAT was born, Garcia
and Kokenis were joined by
women's club soccer player Annie
Graham 'l4 and women's rugby
player Smriti Sridhar 'l5. Kokenis
also credited the work of older
members in the Stanford commu
nity such as Holly Fetter 'l3, Xan
the Travlos' 11 and Laura Wadden
'O9, for laying the foundation for
the organization.
"We are in a unique situation
of having these cultures of really
good athletics and a really strong
queer community," Graham said.
"I definitely think it's important
that we step up. Because we have
so many talented athletic teams,
we should definitely focus on mak
ing those teams wonderful groups

of open people as well."

Struggles faced

LGBTQ athletes can often
face challenges unique to the lock
er room and team environment.

"There are certain stereo
types that come along with being
an athlete and certain stereotypes
that go along with homosexuality,
and I don't think the two overlap a
lot," said Stanford gymnast Cale
Robinson 'l4. "So I think people
are often kind of taken aback and
shocked when there are gay ath
letes."

These athletes specifically em
phasized the prevalence of gender
stereotypes within their sports.
"Something we have come
across a lot [at StAAT] is that there
is definitely a need to represent
some sort of image of masculinity
or femininity depending on your
gender," Garcia said. "That plays a
big role in feeling comfortable
about revealing some sort of sexu

and Allies Together (StAAT), which works to create awareness and build support for LGBTQ and allied athletes.
al orientation and how that might
be associated with being weak."

Kokenis said female athletes
in more masculine sports are of
ten affected by the stereotype that
all really good female athletes
must be lesbians.
"A lot of athletes feel that if
you are LGBTQ, that you need to
hide your sexuality so that you are
not conforming to the stereo
type," Kokenis said. "Or if you are
straight, you need to over-empha
size your femininity to make sure
that you aren't conforming to the
stereotype."
Robinson said that the sport
men's gymnastics has often faced
a perception that it has a lot of gay
athletes.

"I was around this culture up
until the point that I came to Stan
ford, a culture that was hypersen
sitive about being looked at as a
gay sport. There was always a big
effort to do everything we could
to not be seen as a gay sport,"
Robinson said. "I was never com
fortable coming out or anything
like that in club or really in any oth
er environment except for Stan
ford."

The team environment can al
so make coming out more difficult.
Robinson said there is a notion that
if an athlete comes out as gay, then
the whole culture of the locker
room is going to change.
"It's not really an issue that's
talked about, and that silence can
be really scary for an athlete that is
in the closet and not sure how their
teammates and coaches are going to
respond," Kokenis said.

StAAT's main focus has been
on creating safe spaces for all varsi
ty and club teams while also work
