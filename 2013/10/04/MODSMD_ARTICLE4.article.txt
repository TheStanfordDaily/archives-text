# StAAT seeks safer spaces

### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
It has been an exciting fall for
Cardinal sports, with the football
team's demolition of Washington
State, the women's soccer team's
thrilling come-from-behind victory
over Santa Clara and the field
hockey team's 366-minute
shutout streak. But there has also
been another exciting change in
Stanford stadiums: the presenta
tion of the "If You Can Play, You
Can Play" video, part of an ongoing
effort to help make the Farm a
safer place for LGBTQ athletes.
The video which will play

at every Cardinal sports venue this
year was produced last spring
by the Stanford Department of
Athletics and Stanford Athletes
and Allies Together (StAAT), a stu
dent group dedicated to support
ing LGBTQ and allied athletes.

Building a foundation
In May 2012, Stanford was
placed on the list of the top 10
most LGBT-friendly colleges for
athletes by Campus Pride, a non
profit supporting LGBT and allied
students on college campuses. Yet
many athletes on the Farm felt
that the recognition was unwar
ranted.

"We didn't feel like we actual
ly deserved it," said Toni Kokenis
'l4, one of the four founders of
StAAT. "We felt like we only got
the award because Stanford itself
is very LGBTQ-friendly, and we
are also one of the best athletic de
partments. It felt like they kind of
just put the two together."
After the announcement, a
group of Stanford alumni, stu
dents and staff members hosted
an event to both celebrate the
award and to start spreading
awareness about the topic.
"We felt that we were pretty
far behind and we kind of used the
event to spark awareness," Koke
nis said. "We wanted to show that
we got this award, and that we
should actually start doing things
to back this up."
Following the momentum of
the event, Kokenis reached out to
Cardinal diver Noah Garcia 'l4
about creating a group focused on
developing a safe community for
LGBTQ athletes.

"This was something that I

had been thinking about for a
while, because there wasn't really
any group on campus that was rep
resentative of who we were," Gar
cia said. "I was sort of afraid to go
out of my way to start thinking
about it or start making anything
happen. Having Toni's initiative re
ally inspired me."
As StAAT was born, Garcia
and Kokenis were joined by
women's club soccer player Annie
Graham 'l4 and women's rugby
player Smriti Sridhar 'l5. Kokenis
also credited the work of older
members in the Stanford commu
nity such as Holly Fetter 'l3, Xan
the Travlos' 11 and Laura Wadden
'O9, for laying the foundation for
the organization.
"We are in a unique situation
of having these cultures of really
good athletics and a really strong
queer community," Graham said.
"I definitely think it's important
that we step up. Because we have
so many talented athletic teams,
we should definitely focus on mak
ing those teams wonderful groups

of open people as well."

Struggles faced

LGBTQ athletes can often
face challenges unique to the lock
er room and team environment.

"There are certain stereo
types that come along with being
an athlete and certain stereotypes
that go along with homosexuality,
and I don't think the two overlap a
lot," said Stanford gymnast Cale
Robinson 'l4. "So I think people
are often kind of taken aback and
shocked when there are gay ath
letes."

These athletes specifically em
phasized the prevalence of gender
stereotypes within their sports.
"Something we have come
across a lot [at StAAT] is that there
is definitely a need to represent
some sort of image of masculinity
or femininity depending on your
gender," Garcia said. "That plays a
big role in feeling comfortable
about revealing some sort of sexu
