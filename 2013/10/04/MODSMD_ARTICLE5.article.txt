# Transgender prof, advocates for women in science

### NIUNIU TEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ben Barres lounged in a plush
leather armchair in his office in the
Fairchild Building of the Stanford
School of Medicine. The first words
out of his mouth after an initial
greeting were: "So, are you gay?"
I said no, hesitantly, and he nod
ded, his glasses reflecting the light
from his ceiling. "Just wanted to get
it out of the way," he added, his
bearded face cracking into a wry
smile.

He propped his sneaker-clad
feet on the table in front of him.
"Shall we begin?"
Barres doesn't like having his
picture taken or speaking in public,
which are perhaps not traits one
would expect to find in a promi
nent activist for women's rights.
However, he is a staunch supporter
for women in science, and despite
his reservations against appearing
in public, has spoken at Harvard
and published articles about the
matter.

He came to national attention
in 2006 for his article published in
"Nature" that firmly negated the
idea that women are somehow in
nately at a disadvantage in scientific
fields. He calls this presumption
the "Larry Summers Hypothesis,"
referring to former Harvard Univer
sity president Summers' comment
that the underrepresentation of
women in the sciences could be ex
plained by a "different availability of
aptitude at the high end" instead of
social discrimination and prejudice.
Barres knows what he's talking
about he has a degree in biology
from MIT, a medical degree from
Dartmouth and a doctorate in neu

robiology from Harvard. He is cur
rently chair of the Department of
Neurobiology at the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine, and he
runs a lab that focuses on research
ing the interactions between neu
rons and glial cells in the nervous
system. And what's more, he is
sympathetic to women in away few
other men are after all, he was
born a woman, and spent the first
40 years of his life playing that role.

Growing up female
Barres said he was a happy
child, despite being repeatedly
scolded for transgressing gender
norms.

"I had a good childhood," he
said. "But kids always have fun. I
grew up in New Jersey, so there you
go, so I had to deal with that. But
back then, I didn't know I could have
been living out here, in paradise."
His gender identity became
clear from the very beginning.
"I noticed from a very early age
I was very different from [my sis
ter]," Barres said, referring to his
fraternal twin. "She wanted to play
with little girls and I wanted to play
with little boys. It's a pretty typical
transgender story, from what I've
read."

Although Barres wasn't aware
of the social term for his identity, he
couldn't help but notice a differ
ence in the way he acted.

"I felt like a naked chicken
shaving," he said. "I was very aware
that I felt more like a boy; I guess I
just thought I was a tomboy. It was
a little awkward. That was in the
days before the Internet, and there
were really very few transgender
people. I knew I was different, but
it wasn't something I would ever

talk about. I sort of just behaved

that way."
However, unlike many trans
gender individuals, he never found
himself attracted to members of ei
ther sex.

"I had a boyfriend in college,
kind of in the experimentation of
youth," he said. "I didn't realize that
I just don't experience the same
feelings the butterflies in the
stomach, the sweaty palms, whatev
er you're supposed to feel. I'm just
not wired that way."
His true passion science
stayed constant throughout his life.
"I found dates boring," he said.
"I always found myself wishing I
was in the lab."

Transitioning

It wasn't until Barres found
himself in Silicon Valley after ac
cepting a job at the Medical School
that he discovered the possibility of
using surgery to fully assume his
gender identity.

"I read an article in the San
Francisco Chronicle about James
Green, a woman who underwent
surgery to become a man," he said.
For Barres, science had been a
passion throughout his life, and he
was worried about the effect transi
tioning changing from female to
male —would have on his career.
"I couldn't move away like
some other people did, and start
fresh somewhere else where no
body would know," he said. "But I
couldn't resist the idea [of transi
tioning] once I learned of it. To
know there was something I could
do about it that was irresistible."

However, after his transition,
he was welcomed back to the field

with open arms.

"Everyone was fantastic, really
fantastic. They were immediately
supportive, and it hasn't affected
my career at all," Barres said.
"There was a huge weight off
my back," he continued. "It's like
my whole life I had to pretend I was
a woman, and that's very hard for a
person to do."

Women in the sciences

Barres experienced every so
cial bias associated with a woman

aspiring to a career in science he
was a tenured professor at Stanford
by the time he underwent his tran
sition. Flowever, he noticed a differ
ence in the way he was treated be
fore and after his treatment.
"You become aware of the dif
ferences in how people treat you,"
he said. "When I was at MIT, I
couldn't get into a good lab, and
they were all headed by men. I had
the grades, I worked hard, I had

everything I needed. Have things
really changed?"
He paused, and answered his
own question.

"Nothing has changed," he
said. "Women also assume that
things are okay, but they aren't.
There's a lot of work left to do.
There are real barriers, and they're
pervasive."
Although Barres has gone
above and beyond in his defense of
women in science as well as in soci
ety in general, he insisted that
women should be doing more to
fight for their own opportunities.
"Men are not only to blame for
the prejudices in our society," he
said. "Women need to be less com
placent. All they need to do is get to
gether and ask, with a few men to
help them, and people will listen."

a woman, and that's very hard for a
person to do."

Women in the sciences

Barres experienced every so
cial bias associated with a woman

aspiring to a career in science he
was a tenured professor at Stanford
by the time he underwent his tran
sition. Flowever, he noticed a differ
ence in the way he was treated be
fore and after his treatment.
"You become aware of the dif
ferences in how people treat you,"
he said. "When I was at MIT, I
couldn't get into a good lab, and
they were all headed by men. I had
the grades, I worked hard, I had

everything I needed. Have things
really changed?"
He paused, and answered his
own question.

"Nothing has changed," he
said. "Women also assume that
things are okay, but they aren't.
There's a lot of work left to do.
There are real barriers, and they're
pervasive."
Although Barres has gone
above and beyond in his defense of
women in science as well as in soci
ety in general, he insisted that
women should be doing more to
fight for their own opportunities.
"Men are not only to blame for
the prejudices in our society," he
said. "Women need to be less com
placent. All they need to do is get to
gether and ask, with a few men to
help them, and people will listen."

Neurobiology professor Ben Barres has been a prominent advocate
for the rights of women in science since transitioning to living
as a man.
Ben Barres lounged in a plush
leather armchair in his office in the
Fairchild Building of the Stanford
School of Medicine. The first words
out of his mouth after an initial
greeting were: "So, are you gay?"
I said no, hesitantly, and he nod
ded, his glasses reflecting the light
from his ceiling. "Just wanted to get
it out of the way," he added, his
bearded face cracking into a wry
smile.

He propped his sneaker-clad
feet on the table in front of him.
"Shall we begin?"
Barres doesn't like having his
picture taken or speaking in public,
which are perhaps not traits one
would expect to find in a promi
nent activist for women's rights.
However, he is a staunch supporter
for women in science, and despite
his reservations against appearing
in public, has spoken at Harvard
and published articles about the
matter.

He came to national attention
in 2006 for his article published in
"Nature" that firmly negated the
idea that women are somehow in
nately at a disadvantage in scientific
fields. He calls this presumption
the "Larry Summers Hypothesis,"
referring to former Harvard Univer
sity president Summers' comment
that the underrepresentation of
women in the sciences could be ex
plained by a "different availability of
aptitude at the high end" instead of
social discrimination and prejudice.
Barres knows what he's talking
about he has a degree in biology
from MIT, a medical degree from
Dartmouth and a doctorate in neu

robiology from Harvard. He is cur
rently chair of the Department of
Neurobiology at the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine, and he
runs a lab that focuses on research
ing the interactions between neu
rons and glial cells in the nervous
system. And what's more, he is
sympathetic to women in away few
other men are after all, he was
born a woman, and spent the first
40 years of his life playing that role.

Growing up female
Barres said he was a happy
child, despite being repeatedly
scolded for transgressing gender
norms.

"I had a good childhood," he
said. "But kids always have fun. I
grew up in New Jersey, so there you
go, so I had to deal with that. But
back then, I didn't know I could have
been living out here, in paradise."
His gender identity became
clear from the very beginning.
"I noticed from a very early age
I was very different from [my sis
ter]," Barres said, referring to his
fraternal twin. "She wanted to play
with little girls and I wanted to play
with little boys. It's a pretty typical
transgender story, from what I've
read."

Although Barres wasn't aware
of the social term for his identity, he
couldn't help but notice a differ
ence in the way he acted.

"I felt like a naked chicken
shaving," he said. "I was very aware
that I felt more like a boy; I guess I
just thought I was a tomboy. It was
a little awkward. That was in the
days before the Internet, and there
were really very few transgender
people. I knew I was different, but
it wasn't something I would ever

talk about. I sort of just behaved

that way."
However, unlike many trans
gender individuals, he never found
himself attracted to members of ei
ther sex.

"I had a boyfriend in college,
kind of in the experimentation of
youth," he said. "I didn't realize that
I just don't experience the same
feelings the butterflies in the
stomach, the sweaty palms, whatev
er you're supposed to feel. I'm just
not wired that way."
His true passion science
stayed constant throughout his life.
"I found dates boring," he said.
"I always found myself wishing I
was in the lab."

Transitioning

It wasn't until Barres found
himself in Silicon Valley after ac
cepting a job at the Medical School
that he discovered the possibility of
using surgery to fully assume his
gender identity.

"I read an article in the San
Francisco Chronicle about James
Green, a woman who underwent
surgery to become a man," he said.
For Barres, science had been a
passion throughout his life, and he
was worried about the effect transi
tioning changing from female to
male —would have on his career.
"I couldn't move away like
some other people did, and start
fresh somewhere else where no
body would know," he said. "But I
couldn't resist the idea [of transi
tioning] once I learned of it. To
know there was something I could
do about it that was irresistible."

However, after his transition,
he was welcomed back to the field

with open arms.

"Everyone was fantastic, really
fantastic. They were immediately
supportive, and it hasn't affected
my career at all," Barres said.
"There was a huge weight off
my back," he continued. "It's like
my whole life I had to pretend I was
a woman, and that's very hard for a
person to do."
