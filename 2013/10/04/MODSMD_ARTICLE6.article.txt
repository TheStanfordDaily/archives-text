Stanford Athletes and Allies
Together (StAAT)

Co-founded by four Stanford athletes last year,
Stanford Athletes and Allies Together (STATT) is
aimed at making the Farm a safer, more welcom
ing place for LGBT student athletes. The group
hosts events and meetings between members of
the queer and allied athlete community as a
means of fostering a greater sense of acceptance
and support on and off the field. The organiza
tion was pivotal in the creation of the "If You Can
Play, You Can Play" Stanford Athletics video, a
multimedia approach at stamping out this preju
dice.

Queer Straight Alliance

Created to foster a sense of unity and acceptance
between members of Stanford's LGBT communi
ty and the campus, the Queer Straight Alliance
(QSA) organizes social events and speakers series
targeted at bridging this divide. The QSA also
partners with other LGBT organizations on cam
pus to host parties, including Genderfuk, cam
pus' annual gender-bending, cross-dressing ex
travaganza.

Queer Studies Coalition

An academic-focused group, the Queer Studies
Coalition was established to nurture the study of
sexuality and gender orientation on campus,
whether in the form of supporting student re
search or advocating for the introduction of class
es that address such topics. The organization also
fosters mentorship connection between student
and faculty members of the Stanford LGBT com
munity.

Stanford Pride

Aimed at fostering a network of LGBT alumni,
students and faculty, Stanford Pride hosts events
and programs on campus and across the country
as a means of keeping the community intact. In
addition to hosting networking events and social
get-togethers, the organization also administers
the annual Huffington Pride Fellowship, a grant
for students who are providing a positive service
to the LGBT community.

Stanford Students for Queer
Liberation

For individuals who want to take a more proac
tive stance on asserting their LGBT statuses,
Stanford Students for Queer Liberation is fo
cused not on accommodating social norms but
trying to change them. In years past, the group
was involved in protesting against the reinstitu
tion of ROTC on campus as well as hosting Inter
sections Week, an annual event that explores the
relationship between sexual orientation and
racial identities.
