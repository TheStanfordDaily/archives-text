# OPINIONS
## Against marriage? 
### Gustavo Empinotti 
Stanford is the first place I have ever
been at where the angry looks are di
rected not at LGBTQs themselves but
at their opponents. It is also where I
first saw LGBTQs oppose marriage equality.
The arguments for such opposition are sum
marized by Erika Lynn's Daily piece, Against
Marriage.
Erika starts by summarizing the history of
LGBTQ activism, pointing out how the first
major gay organizations marginalized the
movement's initiators. Then, she goes on to
argue that queers should not have to assimi
late to mainstream culture, and that "[qjueer
relationships often take on forms very differ
ent from that of norm."

The fact that the movement's first sup
porters mishandled the cause, however, is not
a case against the cause itself. When marriage
equality is brought to court, it also pertains to
people and not just a subsection of our socie
ty. Therefore, we should only analyze whether
or not it is a just cause in itself.
The answer would be "no" if marriage
equality excluded other queers inherently. I
will argue that it doesn't.

The first argument against marriage is
that it excludes those that opt for a non
monogamous lifestyle. This, however, is an ar
gument against marriage as a whole, not
same-sex marriages specifically.
Erika's statement about "queer relation
ships" is a generalization about LGBTQs and
an oversight of straight, sexually liberal peo
ple. Completely denying marriage is a differ
ent point, but even dissenters should agree
that it must either be legal for all or for none.
The status quo in most of the world legal
only for heterosexuals is an inherently un
just distinction.

Which brings us to the abolition of mar
riage. I have no space to include my view on
the topic in this column, but marriage abolition
supporters need to focus on the overall aboli
tion instead of targeting the discussion on
same-sex marriage, because their cause doesn't
oppose the latter exclusively.
Another claim is that achieving
marriage equality might reduce
LGBTQ activism, since many would
think the fight is won. This argu
ment is a denial of partial advance
because it could essentially be used
to keep any law from passing.
No law solves all the problems
of a given social group at once.
When slavery was abolished, the
previously enslaved obviously did
not immediately rise to the stan
dard of living of their owners, and
the gap remains. At that point in
time, it could have been argued
that ending slavery would lead
some to think the fight was over.
I'm sure we all agree, however,
that though abolishing slavery was
the right thing to do, it did not end
the discussion on racism and we
have been striving towards equali
ty ever since, even though we
haven't reached it yet.
A third argument asks about
other more important changes that
need to happen inside the queer
community. Erika mentions an un

documented immigrant queer
who cannot report a hate crime for
fear of being deported. This once
more has absolutely nothing to do
with LGBTQ issues.

It is the same problem for a
wife who can't report domestic vi
olence, or for that matter, any un
documented victim of any crime.
Its solution is increasing immigrant
rights for everyone, which is not in
the least mutually exclusive with
marriage equality.
Both fights need to continue.
The same is true for any problem
faced by members of the LBGTQ
community who belong to some
other socially marginalized group.
Their problem obviously has to be
solved, but by policies that have
nothing to do with their LGBTQ
status. Improving racial and social
equality should not be fought dif
ferently within the LGBTQ com
munity than it is elsewhere.
Fights for other queer rights,
such as deciding the legal gender
of trans people, need to continue
but are not intrinsically hindered

by marriage.
There is also a problem of per
spective here. If marriage equality

had been denied by the Supreme
Court, it would not have been due
to any of the reasons above but
rather because there is still a de
sire for legal distinction based on
sexual orientation.
It would have been far more
concerning if conservative Ameri
ca had won the legal battle as op
posed to the hypothetical conse
quence of reduced LGBTQ ac
tivism.

It would have been devastating
had the Supreme Court ratified con
servative disapproval of same-sex
marriage. From a pragmatic point of
view, passing marriage equality will
usher an ideological swing much
more significant than the one it
might supposedly hinder.
Turning the marriage equality
cause into a petty fight between
segments of the LGBTQ communi
ty ignores the reality: The obsta
cle to change is the conservative
side. Activists need to bring their
voices together and confront
those who are really hindering
progress.
