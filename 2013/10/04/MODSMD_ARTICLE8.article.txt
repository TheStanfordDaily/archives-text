# OPINIONS
## Against marriage? 
### Gustavo Empinotti 
Stanford is the first place I have ever
been at where the angry looks are di
rected not at LGBTQs themselves but
at their opponents. It is also where I
first saw LGBTQs oppose marriage equality.
The arguments for such opposition are sum
marized by Erika Lynn's Daily piece, Against
Marriage.
Erika starts by summarizing the history of
LGBTQ activism, pointing out how the first
major gay organizations marginalized the
movement's initiators. Then, she goes on to
argue that queers should not have to assimi
late to mainstream culture, and that "[qjueer
relationships often take on forms very differ
ent from that of norm."

The fact that the movement's first sup
porters mishandled the cause, however, is not
a case against the cause itself. When marriage
equality is brought to court, it also pertains to
people and not just a subsection of our socie
ty. Therefore, we should only analyze whether
or not it is a just cause in itself.
The answer would be "no" if marriage
equality excluded other queers inherently. I
will argue that it doesn't.

The first argument against marriage is
that it excludes those that opt for a non
monogamous lifestyle. This, however, is an ar
gument against marriage as a whole, not
same-sex marriages specifically.
Erika's statement about "queer relation
ships" is a generalization about LGBTQs and
an oversight of straight, sexually liberal peo
ple. Completely denying marriage is a differ
ent point, but even dissenters should agree
that it must either be legal for all or for none.
The status quo in most of the world legal
only for heterosexuals is an inherently un
just distinction.

Which brings us to the abolition of mar
riage. I have no space to include my view on
the topic in this column, but marriage abolition
supporters need to focus on the overall aboli
tion instead of targeting the discussion on
same-sex marriage, because their cause doesn't
oppose the latter exclusively.
