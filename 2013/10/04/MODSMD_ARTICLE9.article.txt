## Farm gets "F" on cigarettes 
### Blake Montgomery 
What poisonous product
can you buy at Stan
ford Marketplace and
the Valero on campus?
A substance responsible for one in
five deaths in the world? A product
that will kill over half its users?
Cigarettes.

It's 2013, and Stanford is the on
ly university in Santa Clara County
that continues to allow the sale of to
bacco on campus. For this practice,
the Santa Clara Public Health Depart
ment gave Stanford an F in their re
port card on tobacco policy.
We were the only university to re
ceive a failing grade.

At such a prominent institution,
in a state that has led the nation in to
bacco control policy, are we satisfied
with failing our students and commu
nity? Is it worth the profits to Valero
to continue the sale of a deadly prod
uct on campus? Is it in our best inter
ests to support an industry that has
thrived on the addiction of its cus
tomers and preyed on their igno
rance? Absolutely not.

The hazards of cigarettes may be
viewed as "old news, but tobacco-re
lated diseases continue to be the
leading cause of preventable death in
America and the world. About 45 mil
lion Americans regularly smoke, and
nearly half of these people will die
from their habit.

Nor are we immune to the pit
falls of tobacco use here at Stanford.
In 2012 the Office of Alcohol Policy
surveyed Stanford students and
found that the annual smoking preva
lence is 20 percent. This percentage
is half that of the national average,
and the rate of students who have
smoked recently is even lower. This
bodes well for Stanford students, but
can't we lower it by limiting our own
access to cigarettes?

Stanford is a modern campus at

the forefront of innovation, yet we
are being left behind with our failing
grade. As of July 8, more than 1,100
American universities have enacted
smoke-free campus policies: No
smoking cigarettes indoors or any
where outdoors. 800 of these univer
sities have passed tobacco-free poli
cies, banning the presence of any to
bacco products. Can Stanford take
the first step and ban their sale?
Berkeley will go tobacco-free on
Jan. 1, 2014. UCLA was the first in
the University of California system,
going tobacco-free on April 22 of this
year. University of Oregon went to
bacco free Sept. 2012 with sponsor
ship from Nike. Can Stanford keep
up?

Think smoking is an issue just for
smokers? The air exhaled by a smoker
and the side stream smoke released
from a cigarette exposes those
around him to 69 chemicals known
to cause cancer. If a neighboring
power plant were emitting toxins like
these, would we be sitting by so pas
sively? Even with the bans on smok
ing within 20 feet of buildings, sec-

About 45 million
Americans
regularly
smoke... nearly
half will die
from their habit.
ondhand smoke remains toxic to
nonsmokers. The National Can
cer Institute has found that there
is no safe level of exposure. Per
sonal freedoms extend as far as
they don't harm others; it does
not seem that smoking qualifies.

Consider the intersection of
social justice and tobacco. We
loathe industries that commit hu
man rights abuses, but what of in
dustries that invite us to abuse
ourselves? Yes, we can choose not
to smoke. We have agency. But
when so much misinformation on
tobacco prevails, when even our
choices are the products of covert
advertising constructions like
smoking in the movies and faux
anti-tobacco pitches in schools by
industry experts, why should we
trust this industry with our mon
ey? With our health?
Consider the story of the
face of Winston cigarettes, a male
model named David Goerlitz. Af
ter a photoshoot, he asked Win
ston executives if he could keep
some of the cigarettes used in the
shoot. They told him to take them
all. Perplexed, he asked them if
they smoked. One answered: "Are
you kidding? We reserve that
right for the poor, the young, the
black and the stupid."
"The young" are the "re
placement smokers," the "learn
ers," the under-20 demographic
of first-time smokers who are re
ferred to so often in industry doc
uments. That's us. We replace the
older smokers who are dying.
Does that also make us "the stu
pid"? We can't allow an industry
that targets us with contempt and
misinformation to continue to
manipulate us. We can do better.

Some may argue against me,
saying that smoking is a personal
freedom, a mode of expression.
The tobacco industry has market-

Ed smoking as a form of free
speech since the late 1980s. We
should be able to think outside
their rhetoric, to define ourselves
rather than allowing their market
ing to twist our thinking.
In the face of overwhelming
evidence of the hazards of smok
ing and the misconduct of the in
dustry, why do we continue to de
fend tobacco? Why would we con
tinue to allow its sale on our cam-

pus? For convenience? Easy pur
chase is not a right, and it carries
sinister implications: By allowing
the sale of cigarettes on campus,
Stanford tacitly endorses the to
bacco industry.
Consider your own experi
ence. Flow many smokers do you
know who are proud of that as
pect of their identity? Especially
older smokers. Smoking has be
come a part of their identity they
can't escape even though they re
gret ever starting. Do we want
that for ourselves? Do we want
this part of our free expression to
become a ball and chain?

As for banning the sale of cig
arettes, I turn to Stanford profes
sor Robert Proctor: "Smokers
should have the right to smoke,
but the product is too dangerous
to sell." How many other prod
ucts have such a dismal history as
cigarettes? How many diseases
have such a high mortality rate?
From 1965 to 2009, smoking
declined by 50 percent, with a
small peak around the turn of the
millennium. We can keep going.
We can kick the deadliest human
invention in history off our cam
pus. The Stanford School of Med
icine has already successfully
done so. Let's follow their lead.
Let's make smoke-free environ
ments to help smokers quit. Let's
remove the cues to use. Make
Stanford a better place. Make it a
place that doesn't sell cigarettes.
