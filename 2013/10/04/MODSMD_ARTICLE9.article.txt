## Farm gets "F" on cigarettes 
### Blake Montgomery 
What poisonous product
can you buy at Stan
ford Marketplace and
the Valero on campus?
A substance responsible for one in
five deaths in the world? A product
that will kill over half its users?
Cigarettes.

It's 2013, and Stanford is the on
ly university in Santa Clara County
that continues to allow the sale of to
bacco on campus. For this practice,
the Santa Clara Public Health Depart
ment gave Stanford an F in their re
port card on tobacco policy.
We were the only university to re
ceive a failing grade.

At such a prominent institution,
in a state that has led the nation in to
bacco control policy, are we satisfied
with failing our students and commu
nity? Is it worth the profits to Valero
to continue the sale of a deadly prod
uct on campus? Is it in our best inter
ests to support an industry that has
thrived on the addiction of its cus
tomers and preyed on their igno
rance? Absolutely not.

The hazards of cigarettes may be
viewed as "old news, but tobacco-re
lated diseases continue to be the
leading cause of preventable death in
America and the world. About 45 mil
lion Americans regularly smoke, and
nearly half of these people will die
from their habit.

Nor are we immune to the pit
falls of tobacco use here at Stanford.
In 2012 the Office of Alcohol Policy
surveyed Stanford students and
found that the annual smoking preva
lence is 20 percent. This percentage
is half that of the national average,
and the rate of students who have
smoked recently is even lower. This
bodes well for Stanford students, but
can't we lower it by limiting our own
access to cigarettes?

Stanford is a modern campus at

the forefront of innovation, yet we
are being left behind with our failing
grade. As of July 8, more than 1,100
American universities have enacted
smoke-free campus policies: No
smoking cigarettes indoors or any
where outdoors. 800 of these univer
sities have passed tobacco-free poli
cies, banning the presence of any to
bacco products. Can Stanford take
the first step and ban their sale?
Berkeley will go tobacco-free on
Jan. 1, 2014. UCLA was the first in
the University of California system,
going tobacco-free on April 22 of this
year. University of Oregon went to
bacco free Sept. 2012 with sponsor
ship from Nike. Can Stanford keep
up?

Think smoking is an issue just for
smokers? The air exhaled by a smoker
and the side stream smoke released
from a cigarette exposes those
around him to 69 chemicals known
to cause cancer. If a neighboring
power plant were emitting toxins like
these, would we be sitting by so pas
sively? Even with the bans on smok
ing within 20 feet of buildings, sec-

About 45 million
Americans
regularly
smoke... nearly
half will die
from their habit.
