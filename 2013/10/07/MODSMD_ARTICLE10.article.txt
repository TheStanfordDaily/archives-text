Loum, an iPhone app that provides a so
cial networking service for both public and
anonymous sharing and networking within
local communities, launched today exclu
sively for Stanford.
According to Alex Potrivaev, co-founder

and CEO of Loum, the app is currently the
only social networking site that allows its
users to choose between posting publicly or
anonymously.
Determining the implications of this key
feature was the biggest challenge while cre
ating the app, according to Potrivaev.
"We believe in people, and we believe
that they are mature enough to use this
freedom widely and to tell the truth in a
more secure way," Potrivaev said.
Loum also differs from other web-based
social services, concentrating on the creation
of location and interest-based communities
as a means of keeping people connected.
Compared to Facebook, where the ma
jority of viewed posts carry no relevance to
one's life, and individual posts are viewed
by only 12 percent of one's friends, the
popularity of Loum posts depends on rele
vance rather than on an individual's follow
ing, Potriavaev said. This system results in
the elimination of clutter from one's news
feed.
Loum's first trial took place at Boston
University, where people spent an average
of 41 minutes a day on the site, Potriavaev
said.
As a result of this first experiment,
Loum became an exclusive mobile service
now available to the Stanford community.
After Stanford, Loum seeks to expand in
the Bay Area, one community at a time, in
cluding offices, clubs and neighborhoods as
well as other college campuses.
"Our true mission is to help people find
freedom on the Internet," Potrivaev said.
