## The 						Importance of Being Alone 
### Chi Ling Chan 
During my second week of
junior year at Stanford, I
found myself alone at a
dingy cafe in Moscow drinking
cheap Russian compote, listening to
the breathy whir of the oven puff
ing heat into the frigid air. Outside
people were coming and going
while my headphones blasted The
Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby." All the
lonely people/ Where do they
all come from... ?
It suddenly hit me that it had
been a while since I had had the
chance to be alone, sitting midday
lost in a sea of foreignness, doing
nothing. There is something very
precious about moments like these
moments of solitude, when one
finds company in herself, her
thoughts freed from the Internet
hive mind and allowed to wander
about on its own. This is one reason
why I had come all the way to
Moscow this fall: to have time alone.
Yes, solitude. That was what I
had been craving so desperately
while I had been at Stanford, so
much so that I decided I had to
take a quarter off. Two years at
Stanford have taught me that there
is no place in the world where it is
harder to find time alone. Much too
often, there is no time to breathe,
let alone think. It is as if the entire
campus has been skillfully organ
ized to prevent feeling alone: There
is always a mixer somewhere on
campus, a party, a meeting or an in
terview to go to. There is always
something, someplace to go to, and
we inundate our calendars to keep
loneliness at bay. There simply isn't
time nor reason to be alone.
For some of us, this tugging
need to be somewhere doing
something has made us incapable
of solitude. A friend once confided
to me that she felt unbearably anx
ious and uncomfortable every time
she found herself sitting alone. She
refused to write her papers in her
own room, preferring to do so at a
friend's place, and she would skip
going to the dining halls if she
couldn't find a dinner buddy. The
equivocation of aloneness with
loneliness has become so en
trenched that being alone is some
thing to be averted at all costs, as if
there is anything wrong with
spending time with oneself.
In this age of hyper-connectivi
ty, averting aloneness has become
all too easy. With social media,
everybody is practically one degree
apart: All it takes is a Facebook
message to find oneself in some
body's company, if only virtually.
The News Feed and other network
ing platforms have made it possible
to be privy to friends' lives even if
we have no part in them, creating
the illusion that we are somewhat
"connected" to the experiences of
many distanced others. A disturb
ing byproduct of being in constant
company is that our minds, too, are
never alone: They buzz with sound
bites and opinions we conveniently
lay claim to by clicking "share." So
much for independent thought. The
canvassing of sound bites through
social networking online and off
â€”is fast replacing sustained
thought and introspection.

What happens when sociability
leaves little room for solitude?
What does it mean to be educated
at a place where you are never
alone, and where it takes enormous
effort to find solitude?
I think it means we are at risk of
losing an essential precondition for
thinking deeply or living the intel
lectual life that a liberal arts educa
tion is supposed to give us.
"In order to understand the
world," Albert Camus said, "one
has to turn away from it on occa
sion." The same might be said of
understanding the self: If we are
fearful of finding ourselves alone,
then it is likely that we will never
find ourselves.
There has always been a tug of
war between the fear of loneliness
and the need for solitude. Our lan
guage wisely captures the two sides
of being alone we have the word
"loneliness" which carries with it
the reverberations of isolation and
seclusion, and "solitude," which
rings with a quiet freedom and
tranquility. The former drives us in
to an endless quest for company, at
the expense of time and space for
solitude. At Stanford, the pressures
to be constantly networked and
connected easily eclipse the impor
tance of being alone.
So amid the avalanche of emails
asking for your attendance at this
event and that event, take time to
be alone. Wake up at 8 a.m. when it
is dead quiet and savor the precious
silence uninterrupted by crashing
bikes. Make yourself a cup of hot
chocolate to last through the book
you meant to read but never got to.
Grab that instrument you have
neglected for too long. Go to Lake
Lagunita before the sun sets, right
down into the middle of the
lakebed, and take a deep, deep
breath. Feel the freedom of soli
tude, weightless as feathers. Put
your gadgets away be uncon
tactable for a time your friends
will understand.
Because being alone is okay.
And if you came into college with
the hope of understanding the
world and finding yourself, Camus'
advice is good to keep in mind.
