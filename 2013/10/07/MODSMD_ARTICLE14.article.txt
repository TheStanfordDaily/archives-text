## Bohemian Grove 
### Kevin Rouff 
I arrived last weekend at a serene
spot near the Russian River
about 60 miles north of San
Francisco, where I was staying with
a pal. The small wooden cottages,
primarily intended for the respite
seeking crowds rushing northwards
from the Bay, are grouped into small
clusters among the Redwoods such
that along each inward canyon
small, isolated cottages can be
found, stretching away from the riv
er.
This weekend, I learned there
was another side of this picturesque
outpost. Nestled just a few miles
downstream is the illustrious and
infamous Bohemian Grove. Con
trary to its name, this is not cur
rently a place where hedonism or
alternative lifestyles thrive, though
it did begin in the 1870s as the Bo
hemian Club, a place of congrega
tion for artists and people of bo
hemian build.
After some gradual acquisition of
land, the Bohemian Grove became
the place in which the
"Grovers"/"Bohos" could rejoice, dis

cuss, ponder, knock out a few brain
cells and be themselves according to
the motto "Weaving Spiders Come
Not Here" (i.e. "Don't bring your
work with you"). These alcohol-fu
eled traditions later became odder
rituals, such as the "Cremation of
Care" (similar to Burning Man or the
pagan-inspired Zozobra ritual) and
an annual play.
However, this all changed as the
event and location got bought out
by businessmen, politicians and
people of generally higher social
stature. By the 1920s and continu
ing to this very day, the "bohemian"
has been replaced by the suit. To
day, some of the most important fig
ures in the nation were, and cur
rently are, members of the all-male
club be it every Republican pres
ident since 1923 (many Democratic
presidents too), or CEOs represent
ing a vast spectrum of industries.
The grove is as VIP as it gets.
Rumors are that some Stanford
heads are affiliated, and I have no
doubt that there are a fair share of
alumni gathering there as well.

Besides being apparently very
similar to a frat party ("Bros only!")
and having several cult-like traits,
the place becomes truly of interest
when you realize that future masters
of the universe are not just imbibing
as in their University days, in the
woods, relieving themselves at will
(how often do you imagine they get
to do that kind of thing?), but that
these prominent figures are bring
ing their "weavings" with them, con
trary to Bohemian Grove's long-ob
served motto. This bacchanal is only
a small part of the two-week cam
pout, as introductions, agreements,
deals and partnerships are integral
to this men's club.
The club and its grove has been
the cause of much protest, al
though, as you can imagine, these
protests fail to garner much atten
tion or support. Why shouldn't
these neatly ironed suits have a mo
ment to unbutton? And yet, the dis
concerting point remains that they
are weaving together handshakes
and words that eventually become
highly influential outcomes for the
masses. After all, secret discussions
for the Manhattan Project were
held, in part, at the Bohemian Grove.
How to become a member is, to
me, unclear. Women are forbidden
altogether, which I am sure has at
tracted a fair amount of protest. The
club was actually taken to the Cali
fornia Supreme Court, and they are
now required to hire women. This
changes little other than the fact
that the alcohol-fueled testosterone
is now further stoked by the women
who work on the event's staff.
Though the club itself is relative
ly transparent (or at least has some
level of manageability by external
forces), the event is still relatively
unfamiliar to the public eye. The
several infiltrators mainly report
the ceremonial aspects or note all
the high spirits (both in liquid vol
umes and emotionally). However,
inside hierarchy among the Grovers
themselves Club members are
divided into named groups (George
Bush is apparently a member of the
"Hillbilly" camp) seems to sug
gest that these infiltrators could not
possibly see or hear the true work
ings of the higher-ups.
So something is apparently go
ing on in those woods. Not witches,
no voodoo, not even debauched
teenagers, but just neckties loosen
ing, hands shaking, cigars smoking,
and the system following suit with
their subsequent hangovers.
No need to worry; carry on.
