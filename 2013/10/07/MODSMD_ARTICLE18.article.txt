## STREAKS SNAPPED SUN DEVILS SHOCK CARD WITH 1-0 UPSET 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium collec
tively stood in a stunned silence. The
crowd had just minutes earlier been
furiously cheering for a comeback
from its beloved home team, yelling
and groaning with every missed op
portunity for the Cardinal.
But for the first time in more than
half a decade, the comeback never
came. A shell-shocked Cardinal team
walked off of the field in silence as
the truth sank in for all 1,701 people
in attendance: The streak was over.

When the final whistle blew with
the scoreboard displaying "Arizona
State: 1, Stanford: 0" on Sunday
night, the Cardinal had just lost at
home for the first time since Novem
ber 2007 a span of 73 matches, the
second-longest such streak in NCAA
history. Stanford's 44-match confer
ence winning streak was also
snapped as it dropped a Pac-12 con
test for the first time since 2008
against UCLA
With the loss on Sunday, No. 2
Stanford (9-1-1, 2-1 Pac-12) split the
weekend's two matches against the
Arizona schools after having claimed
a 2-1 overtime victory against Ari
zona (5-3-3, 0-2) on Friday afternoon.

Junior forward Taylor Uhl (right) rescued Stanford with a game-winning goal in overtime Friday, but she
could not provide the heroics again Sunday when ASU gave the Cardinal its first home loss since 2007.
The Cardinal first welcomed
Arizona to the Farm on Friday for
its home opener and the first of a
five-match conference homestand.
Stanford did not come out of the
gate with its usual control as it al
lowed Arizona to control the ball
throughout the first half.
However, the Cardinal broke
through in the 37th minute when
senior forward Sydney Payne beat
a defender and supplied a perfect
cross that freshman forward
Megan Turner headed into the net
for her first collegiate goal.
After the half, the Cardinal
dominated possession but couldn't
put the game away. The Wildcats
scored the equalizer in the 78th
minute off an intercepted pass; Ari
zona junior forward Emily Lai
eventually punched into the back of
the net to knot the match at one
goal apiece. The match was forced
into overtime after neither team
could pull ahead in the remaining
minutes of regulation.
And then, for the 10th time this
season, junior forward Taylor Uhl
came through for the Cardinal in a
big way. The Cardinal took control
in the overtime, locking down pos
session of the ball as Stanford out
shot Arizona five to zero three of
which were by Uhl.
After missing high and wide
right the first two times, Uhl con
nected on her third attempt with
just eight seconds remaining in the
first overtime. She absorbed a long
pass and set herself up before
sending a sliding shot inside the
right post for the golden goal and a
Stanford victory.
"Taylor has an incredible abili
ty to slow the play down," head
coach Paul Ratcliffe told GoStan
ford.com. "A lot of people would
rush that shot, but Taylor always
shows great composure and was re
warded with the goal."

After its overtime victory over
the Wildcats, the Cardinal faced its
other Arizona test on Sunday
evening when it hosted Arizona
State (7-4, 2-1), which was coming
off a tough loss to UC-Berkeley in
the first match of its five-match
road trip.
Sunday's match started off in a
manner strikingly similar to Fri
day's, with Stanford looking partic
ularly shaky in the first half. The
Cardinal could never settle into a
groove due to Arizona State's ag
gressiveness on both sides of the
ball, particularly on defense.
"I think Arizona State was hun
gry," said Ratcliffe after the match.
"They had great energy; I think we
still looked a little tired and didn't
have the intensity necessary to win
a big Pac-12 game."
The Sun Devils' defenders
played Stanford close all evening,
limiting pass opportunities and not
giving the Cardinal players any
space with which to create opportu
nities. Stanford only mustered six
shots in the first half compared
to Arizona State's 11 and was
unable to consistently keep the ball
away from its half of the field.
Freshman goalkeeper Jane Camp
bell's first-half saves kept the Sun
Devils from capitalizing on its op
portunities.
Although she made five saves in
the first half, Campbell couldn't get
to one ball before it got past her
the lone, decisive goal in a hard
fought match.
In the 24th minute, Sun Devils
sophomore midfielder Tommi
Goodman found sophomore for
ward Sara Tosti open 25 yards
from Stanford's goal. Tosti prompt
ly shot the ball past the arms of
Campbell and into the top right
corner of the goal for her third goal
of the season and an early 1-0 Ari
zona State lead.
One goal was all the Sun Devils
would need to upset the No. 2 team
in the nation, as their defense bent
but did not break in the second
half.
Stanford took 13 shots on goal

and kept the ball on Arizona State's
half of the pitch for most of the sec
ond half but could never find an
opening to capitalize. Sun Devil
goalkeeper Chandler Morris made
five big saves after the half to keep
the Cardinal off of the board.
The Cardinal took three corner
kicks and three shots in the final 10
minutes as it looked to make a final
comeback, but after Uhl's shot in
the 87th minute went high and Ari
zona State got the ball away from
its half of the field with precious
seconds bleeding off of the clock,
Stanford couldn't find an opening
and the final whistle blew to seal
the Cardinal's fate.
When asked after the match
whether the loss would affect the
team's mentality moving forward,
Ratcliffe was unsure. In the after
math of the loss his words indicat
ed that he recognized the signifi
cance of the streak coming to an
end.
"I think this will be a test of
their character, to see what they're
made of for sure," Ratcliffe said.
"It's been amazing, the track
record we've had. You know, some
one just told me I hadn't lost since
2007. It's truly amazing. I don't
think it'll be ever repeated in this
era of soccer."
Stanford will look to bounce
back when the Cardinal welcomes
UCLA to the farm Thursday night
at 7:30 p.m.

unable to consistently keep the ball

Freshman goalkeeper Jane Camp

Although she made five saves in
the first half, Campbell couldn't get

the lone, decisive goal in a hard

In the 24th minute, Sun Devils
sophomore midfielder Tommi

the Cardinal off of the board.
The Cardinal took three corner
kicks and three shots in the final 10

Stanford couldn't find an opening

"It's been amazing, the track

2007. It's truly amazing. I don't

Junior forward Taylor Uhl (right) rescued Stanford with a game-winning goal in overtime Friday, but she
could not provide the heroics again Sunday when ASU gave the Cardinal its first home loss since 2007.
The Cardinal first welcomed
Arizona to the Farm on Friday for
its home opener and the first of a
five-match conference homestand.
Stanford did not come out of the
gate with its usual control as it al
lowed Arizona to control the ball
throughout the first half.
However, the Cardinal broke
through in the 37th minute when
senior forward Sydney Payne beat
a defender and supplied a perfect
cross that freshman forward
Megan Turner headed into the net
for her first collegiate goal.
After the half, the Cardinal
dominated possession but couldn't
put the game away. The Wildcats
scored the equalizer in the 78th
minute off an intercepted pass; Ari
zona junior forward Emily Lai
eventually punched into the back of
the net to knot the match at one
goal apiece. The match was forced
into overtime after neither team
could pull ahead in the remaining
minutes of regulation.
And then, for the 10th time this
season, junior forward Taylor Uhl
came through for the Cardinal in a
big way. The Cardinal took control
in the overtime, locking down pos
session of the ball as Stanford out
shot Arizona five to zero three of
which were by Uhl.
After missing high and wide
right the first two times, Uhl con
nected on her third attempt with
just eight seconds remaining in the
first overtime. She absorbed a long
pass and set herself up before
sending a sliding shot inside the
right post for the golden goal and a
Stanford victory.
"Taylor has an incredible abili
ty to slow the play down," head
coach Paul Ratcliffe told GoStan
ford.com. "A lot of people would
rush that shot, but Taylor always
shows great composure and was re
warded with the goal."

After its overtime victory over
the Wildcats, the Cardinal faced its
other Arizona test on Sunday
evening when it hosted Arizona
State (7-4, 2-1), which was coming
off a tough loss to UC-Berkeley in
the first match of its five-match
road trip.
Sunday's match started off in a
manner strikingly similar to Fri
day's, with Stanford looking partic
ularly shaky in the first half. The
Cardinal could never settle into a
groove due to Arizona State's ag
gressiveness on both sides of the
ball, particularly on defense.
"I think Arizona State was hun
gry," said Ratcliffe after the match.
"They had great energy; I think we
still looked a little tired and didn't
have the intensity necessary to win
a big Pac-12 game."
The Sun Devils' defenders
played Stanford close all evening,
limiting pass opportunities and not
giving the Cardinal players any
space with which to create opportu
nities. Stanford only mustered six
shots in the first half compared
