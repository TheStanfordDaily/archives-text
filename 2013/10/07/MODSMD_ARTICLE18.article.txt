## STREAKS SNAPPED SUN DEVILS SHOCK CARD WITH 1-0 UPSET 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium collec
tively stood in a stunned silence. The
crowd had just minutes earlier been
furiously cheering for a comeback
from its beloved home team, yelling
and groaning with every missed op
portunity for the Cardinal.
But for the first time in more than
half a decade, the comeback never
came. A shell-shocked Cardinal team
walked off of the field in silence as
the truth sank in for all 1,701 people
in attendance: The streak was over.

When the final whistle blew with
the scoreboard displaying "Arizona
State: 1, Stanford: 0" on Sunday
night, the Cardinal had just lost at
home for the first time since Novem
ber 2007 a span of 73 matches, the
second-longest such streak in NCAA
history. Stanford's 44-match confer
ence winning streak was also
snapped as it dropped a Pac-12 con
test for the first time since 2008
against UCLA
With the loss on Sunday, No. 2
Stanford (9-1-1, 2-1 Pac-12) split the
weekend's two matches against the
Arizona schools after having claimed
a 2-1 overtime victory against Ari
zona (5-3-3, 0-2) on Friday afternoon.

could not provide the heroics again Sunday when ASU gave the Cardinal its first home loss since 2007.
