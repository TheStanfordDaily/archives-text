## Stanford cruises in home opener 
### LUKE ASPERGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After starting the season off
with a 7-2 road trip, the men's wa
ter polo team returned home to
Avery Aquatic Center to take on
Santa Clara Saturday afternoon.
The No. 4 Cardinal quickly took
control of the match with tight de
fense and a fast counterattack to
secure a resounding 20-5 victory
over the No. 15 Broncos.
Santa Clara (9-5) took an early
lead in the first quarter when driv
er Mark Davis skipped a shot past
Stanford fifth-year senior goalie

Scott Platshon after just over a
minute of play. Stanford (8-2) re
sponded quickly and forcefully on
the next play when senior Forrest
Watkins drilled a shot into the
high corner from 2 meters. On
the next play, Watkins promptly
stole the ball from the Broncos
and got it to sophomore Bret Bo
nanni who was beating his de
fender. With a wide-open cage,

Bonanni scored to give the Cardi
nal a 2-1 lead.
Stanford finished the quarter
on a 5-0 run with a goal from jun
ior Alex Bowen and two in a row
from redshirt freshman Griffin
Bolan at 2 meters. Even with the
Bronco defense dropping back on
him, Bolan managed to score the
last goal of period by getting off a
quick sweep shot to the top right
corner.
Santa Clara fought back at the
beginning of the second quarter,
scoring on a six-on-five after a
Stanford ejection. However, Stan
ford would bounce back a few

plays later when Bowen inter
cepted a Santa Clara pass, swam
the ball down to the other side
and skipped it past the out
stretched arms of Santa Clara
goalie Matt Pritchett.
At halftime, with Stanford up
8-3, the game was still somewhat
within reach for Santa Clara, but
Stanford put the Broncos away
for good by opening the second
half with five goals in a row. The
Cardinal's press defense held the
Broncos to only two goals during
the final half, outpaced by 12 from
