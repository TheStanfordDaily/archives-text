# GREAT ESCAPE
## MONTGOMERY HELPS CARDINAL SURVIVE 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Certain phrases have come to be
associated with Stanford football:
Nerd Nation, "party in the backfield"
and "focus and finish," among others.
But on Saturday night, "cardiac Card"
was no doubt the most defining term.
In a battle of the undefeated, No. 5
Stanford (5-0, 3-0 Pac-12) held off a
furious rally by No. 15 Washington
(4-1,1-1) to prevail 31-28 and keep its

national title hopes intact. Junior wide
receiver Ty Montgomery starred with
290 all-purpose yards and two touch
downs, including a score on the open
ing kickoff, but the Cardinal needed a
late fourth-down incompletion by
quarterback Keith Price first ruled

a completion, but overturned upon
further review to escape with the
victory.
"We talked about being finishers,
we talk about training for games like
this, because that's our conference,"
said David Shaw, who improved to 28-
4 as Stanford's head coach with the
win. "This is the way it's going to be
from here on out. There's going to be a
one-score lead in the fourth quarter....

Junior wide receiver Ty Montgomery (left) picked up 280 all-purpose yards, including a 99-yard kickoff return
for a touchdown to open the game, providing the Card just enough offense to hold off the Husky upset bid.
Either we're going to be up or we're
going to be down, and that is just the
way it's going to be."
"I think you needed to be tested
on occasion to prove to yourself what
you're capable of and to improve,"
added fifth-year senior linebacker
Shayne Skov, who recorded a team
high 14 tackles along with lk sacks.
"You find out things about yourself
when you have to push through ad
versity. You have to rise up to the
challenge.... The more difficult the
games are, the better we'll become."
Stanford seemed to have the
game well under control when it held
a 31-21 lead with just over four min
utes left in the game. But Price
mounted a lightning-quick touch
down drive galvanized by a 40-
yard circus catch by wide receiver
Kasen Williams that took just 1:34
off the clock and cut the deficit to 3.
Needing just one first down on
the next chive to seal the game, jun
ior quarterback Kevin Hogan
bounced outside on the usually suc
cessful bootleg play but failed to
move the chains on third-and-1. A
Cardinal punt gave the Huskies the
ball with 1:51 left in the game. Price
hooked up with Williams once again
for an 18-yard pickup on the first play
of the drive before Stanford's defense
stood its ground on the next three
snaps, with fifth-year senior defen
sive end Ben Gardner and fifth-year
senior outside linebacker Trent Mur
phy applying the pressure on Price.
It seemed as if the game was over
when multiple Cardinal defenders
rushed into the backfield on fourth
and-10, but the shifty Price pulled a
Houdini and fired a bullet to wideout
Kevin Smith near the right sideline
at the Cardinal 33 for a first down.
The officials ruled the pass complete,
but after a lengthy review of the play,
they overturned the call, stating that
the ball had hit the ground as Smith
was trying to make the catch.
"The guys upstairs said they saw
a replay from behind," Shaw said.
"You could see the ball go through,
hit [Smith's] chest, bounce off the
ground and into his hands."
With 1:16 left in the game and the
Huskies down to one timeout, Hogan
kneeled down twice after the
turnover on downs to end the game.
"One of our team goals is just to go
1-0 every week," Murphy said. "It
wasn't pretty, but we got it. We can't
be the same team we were a week
ago. We just have to keep moving for
ward."
Montgomery jump-started the

Cardinal when he took the opening
kickoff for a 99-yard touchdown in an
impressive display of speed, marking
the first time in more than four years
in which a Cardinal returner brought
back an opening kickoff for a score. A
defensive struggle ensued, with
Hogan throwing an interception in
Huskies territory and Washington
punting five times in a row. Only a 33-
yard field goal by Jordan Williamson
increased Stanford's lead to 10-0
midway through the second quarter.
But as the first half started to
wind down, the Huskies offense be
gan to open up. Price ran the offense
at warp speed with a combination of
handoffs to running back Bishop
Sankey and quick completions to his
targets, including a 19-yard strike to
tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins
over the middle of the field.
"Can't say enough about Keith
Price," Shaw said. "Athletic, smart,
great kid, tough competitor. We
probably should have had four to five
more sacks tonight, but we couldn't
bring him down. He's that good."
On first-and-goal at the Cardinal
7, Sankey somehow stayed upright
after getting hit near the line of
scrimmage and darted into the end
zone to cut the margin to 3 points.
The junior running back would even
tually finish the game with 136 yards
and two touchdowns on 27 carries.
Hogan looked uncharacteristical
ly skittish he finished the contest
just 12-of-20 passing for 105 yards in
what was the worst game of his ca
reer and his receivers did him no
favors by creating little or no separa
tion from the disciplined Washington
defensive backs. On offense, the Car
dinal was outgained by the Huskies
489 to 284 yards and picked up only
14 first downs compared to Washing
ton's 30. But the junior quarterback
delivered in the waning moments of
the second quarter, when he found
Montgomery down the right sideline
for a 39-yard touchdown to give
Stanford a 17-7 lead heading into
halftime.
"[Washington's defense] is well
coached and they're extremely
good," Shaw said. "There were not a
lot of passing lanes. They did a good
job squeezing the receivers, getting
underneath the receivers. The cor
ners and safeties played deep, so it
was hard to get the deep shot. This is
a defense that makes you try to go
the long way without giving up big
plays."
The Cardinal defense gave up all
kinds of big plays to staid the third
quarter. A 30-yard rush by Sankey
followed by a 29-yard touchdown re
ception by Smith chipped Stanford's
lead to three just a minute into the
second half. Hogan answered on the
next drive, however, when he found

the end zone with a 4-yard option
keeper before Sankey struck again
toward the end of the third quarter,
weaving his way into the end zone
from 15 yards out. The play was eeri
ly similar to Sankey's 61-yard touch
down run against Stanford last year,
a game-changing score that also cut
Stanford's lead from 10 to 3 and
turned the tide in Washington's favor.
But on Saturday night, Mont
gomery was not going to let history
repeat itself.
Washington intentionally kicked
the ball away from him, but Mont
gomery fielded the ball anyways and
exploded through a crease before fi
nally getting dragged down at the
Husky 19. Three plays later, running

back Tyler Gaffney punched it in
from 11 yards out to put the Cardinal
back up by 10.
"Much was made about last
year's game with Ty and him having
a rough game," Shaw said. "We all
had a rough game last year. But what
I love about Ty right now and his
mentality is this wasn't away to get
back at Washington or wasn't re
demption by any stretch of the imag
ination; it's just his growth. I mean,
he's a better player now than he was
a year- ago. He's gotten better every
single week."
Washington had a chance to pull
within 3 again with less than six min
utes left in the game, but Murphy
tipped a pass from Price on first-and

goal at the Cardinal 7, allowing senior
linebacker A. J. Tarpley to come down
with the ball. The pick extended Stan
ford's takeaway streak to 29 games,
and more importantly, prevented the
Huskies from walking away with any
points. And after a three-and-out by
Hogan and company, Washington be
gan its furious rally.
"We were in a fight and [it came]
down to the last minute," Montgomery
said. "We showed that we can stand in
there and we can finish a game and win
in a fight if we have to."
Stanford travels to Salt Lake
City next weekend to take on Utah.
