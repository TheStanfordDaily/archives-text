### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After opening the weekend with a decisive
6-1 win against Pacific Friday night, Stanford
suffered a shocking 3-2 loss its first Nor-
Pac conference loss of the season at UC-
Davis in overtime Sunday.

The Cardinal
(8-3, 2-1 NorPac)
fell behind to the
Aggies (3-7, 1-0)
1-0 just before
halftime, but sen
ior attacker Hope

Burke evened up the game with a quick goal
right out of the break. Stanford jumped
ahead for the first time all night when fresh
man Fran Tew scored with just over 15 min
utes to play, but that would be the last strike
for the Cardinal all night.
With just six minutes remaining, Stephie
Sabraw tied the game for the Aggies. Nei
ther team could break through in the remain
der of regulation, but in overtime, a Jamie
Garcia goal sent Stanford home with a disap
pointing NorPac loss.
The surprising defeat came just two days
after an easy home victory against Pacific
Friday night. The Cardinal scored five unan
swered goals to pull away after an early tie to
coast to a 6-1 win. Stanford was solid all
across the field, outshooting the visiting
Tigers 19-6.
Stanford started the scoring at 10:51 into
the half with a penalty corner shot, netted by
junior Kelsey Harbin and assisted by senior
Hope Burke and junior Shannon Herold. It
was the fifth goal for the defender Harbin
this season.

Senior attacker Hope Burke (above) picked up a goal in both of the Cardinal's weekend games.
Stanford won easily Friday at home against Pacific, but fell Sunday night at UC-Davis.
Pacific retaliated five minutes
later on a penalty corner of its own.
Emily Tregoning rocketed a shot
into the bottom left corner of the
cage. It was the last goal Pacific
would see however, as sophomore
goalie Dulcie Davies ended the
game with four saves.
Scoring exploded for the Cardi
nal as they added two more goals
before halftime, one in the 25th
minute by sophomore attacker
Clemence Couteau and another in
the 34th minute by Burke. The Car
dinal showed poise and dominance,
masterfully controlling posses
sions, distributing throughout the
midfield and receiving a powerful
punch from the forward line. The
defense, in classic Stanford style,
was stingy, limiting the Tigers to
just six shots and two penalty cor
ners over the 70 minutes of play.
The second half proved just as
bountiful for a relentless Stanford
squad, as they added three more
goals, including the first of the sea
son for freshman Casey Deeds, to
end the scoring in the 67th minute.

"It was invigorating, unreal,"
commented Deeds on her goal, a
nicely played rebound off a shot by
junior midfielder Kasey Quon. "I
looked at my teammates and they
were waiting for me to react, and I
didn't know what to do."
When asked about the chem
istry of the Cardinal team, Deeds
said with a smile, "The team has re
ally good chemistry. Since there are
only four freshmen the team was al
ready really close, but they're very
accepting."
Deeds was named Cardinal of
the Game by coach Tara Danielson,
an honor given to a Stanford play
er with a particularly spectacular
performance in a given match.
While Sunday's loss dampened
the positive feeling after the win
against Pacific, Stanford won't
have to wait long for a chance at re
venge. The Cardinal is back in ac
tion Friday night at home against
UC-Davis.
Friday's game against the Ag
gies is scheduled to begin on the
Varsity Turf at 6 p.m.

After opening the weekend with a decisive
6-1 win against Pacific Friday night, Stanford
suffered a shocking 3-2 loss its first Nor-
Pac conference loss of the season at UC-
Davis in overtime Sunday.

The Cardinal
(8-3, 2-1 NorPac)
fell behind to the
Aggies (3-7, 1-0)
1-0 just before
halftime, but sen
ior attacker Hope

Burke evened up the game with a quick goal
right out of the break. Stanford jumped
ahead for the first time all night when fresh
man Fran Tew scored with just over 15 min
utes to play, but that would be the last strike
for the Cardinal all night.
With just six minutes remaining, Stephie
Sabraw tied the game for the Aggies. Nei
ther team could break through in the remain
der of regulation, but in overtime, a Jamie
Garcia goal sent Stanford home with a disap
pointing NorPac loss.
The surprising defeat came just two days
after an easy home victory against Pacific
Friday night. The Cardinal scored five unan
swered goals to pull away after an early tie to
coast to a 6-1 win. Stanford was solid all
across the field, outshooting the visiting
Tigers 19-6.
Stanford started the scoring at 10:51 into
the half with a penalty corner shot, netted by
junior Kelsey Harbin and assisted by senior
Hope Burke and junior Shannon Herold. It
was the fifth goal for the defender Harbin
this season.

ALISA ROYER/The Stanford Daily
Senior attacker Hope Burke (above) picked up a goal in both of the Cardinal's weekend games.
Stanford won easily Friday at home against Pacific, but fell Sunday night at UC-Davis.
Pacific retaliated five minutes
later on a penalty corner of its own.
Emily Tregoning rocketed a shot
into the bottom left corner of the
cage. It was the last goal Pacific
would see however, as sophomore
goalie Dulcie Davies ended the
game with four saves.
Scoring exploded for the Cardi
nal as they added two more goals
before halftime, one in the 25th
minute by sophomore attacker
Clemence Couteau and another in
the 34th minute by Burke. The Car
dinal showed poise and dominance,
masterfully controlling posses
sions, distributing throughout the
midfield and receiving a powerful
punch from the forward line. The
defense, in classic Stanford style,
was stingy, limiting the Tigers to
just six shots and two penalty cor
ners over the 70 minutes of play.
The second half proved just as
bountiful for a relentless Stanford
squad, as they added three more
goals, including the first of the sea
son for freshman Casey Deeds, to
end the scoring in the 67th minute.

"It was invigorating, unreal,"
commented Deeds on her goal, a
nicely played rebound off a shot by
junior midfielder Kasey Quon. "I
looked at my teammates and they
were waiting for me to react, and I
didn't know what to do."
When asked about the chem
istry of the Cardinal team, Deeds
said with a smile, "The team has re
ally good chemistry. Since there are
only four freshmen the team was al
ready really close, but they're very
accepting."
Deeds was named Cardinal of
the Game by coach Tara Danielson,
an honor given to a Stanford play
er with a particularly spectacular
performance in a given match.
While Sunday's loss dampened
the positive feeling after the win
against Pacific, Stanford won't
have to wait long for a chance at re
venge. The Cardinal is back in ac
tion Friday night at home against
UC-Davis.
Friday's game against the Ag
gies is scheduled to begin on the
Varsity Turf at 6 p.m.
