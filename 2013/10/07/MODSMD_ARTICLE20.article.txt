6-1 win against Pacific Friday night, Stanford
suffered a shocking 3-2 loss its first Nor-
Pac conference loss of the season at UC-
Davis in overtime Sunday.

The Cardinal
(8-3, 2-1 NorPac)
fell behind to the
Aggies (3-7, 1-0)
1-0 just before
halftime, but sen
ior attacker Hope

Burke evened up the game with a quick goal
right out of the break. Stanford jumped
ahead for the first time all night when fresh
man Fran Tew scored with just over 15 min
utes to play, but that would be the last strike
for the Cardinal all night.
With just six minutes remaining, Stephie
Sabraw tied the game for the Aggies. Nei
ther team could break through in the remain
der of regulation, but in overtime, a Jamie
Garcia goal sent Stanford home with a disap
pointing NorPac loss.
The surprising defeat came just two days
after an easy home victory against Pacific
Friday night. The Cardinal scored five unan
swered goals to pull away after an early tie to
coast to a 6-1 win. Stanford was solid all
across the field, outshooting the visiting
Tigers 19-6.
Stanford started the scoring at 10:51 into
the half with a penalty corner shot, netted by
junior Kelsey Harbin and assisted by senior
Hope Burke and junior Shannon Herold. It
was the fifth goal for the defender Harbin
this season.
