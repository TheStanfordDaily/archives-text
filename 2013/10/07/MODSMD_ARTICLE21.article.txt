# Close call presents big concerns
## 
### Sam Fisher 
Well that was close.
As senior Ben
Rhyne trotted out
to punt the ball
back to the Huskies
with Stanford only leading by 3 and
two minutes remaining in the game, I
started mentally preparing myself
for a Stanford loss. Washington's of
fense was going to score.
It wouldn't have been the de
fense's fault either. Yes, Stanford had
scored 31 points, but special teams
was directly responsible for 14 of
them. After showing up briefly for
the end of the second quarter and
most of the third, the offense disap
peared down the stretch to the tune
of three consecutive three-and-outs
to end the game.
Now I don't care if you're taking
on the vintage Pittsburgh Steelers, a
good offense has to be able to get one
first down in that situation. Stanford
couldn't get it done, and that left Stan
ford's championship hopes hanging in
an awful balance.

But somehow, in classic Stanford
fashion most recently reminiscent of
the end of regulation against Arizona
in 2012, the fatigued and short-handed
defense came through and the Cardi
nal survived.
So, how do we move forward ft'om
that? Should we take a deep breath
and say "A win is a win," and move on?
Should we go into full panic mode and
start making Alamo Bowl plans? I
think the answer is somewhere in be
tween, but much closer to the former
than the latter.
Every team is going to have bad
games. Most of the time, great teams
can get away with this due to huge
matchup advantages. As we saw up
close on Saturday night, Stanford did
not have that large of a talent gap over
the Huskies, so the Cardinal's mis
takes were very apparent.
Anyone who watched the game
could notice that junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan was off his game. To put
it mildly, he did not look veiy good, with
the exception of a perfect deep ball to
junior wide receiver Ty Montgomery
at the end of the first half But that was
Hogan's first truly bad performance in
10 games at quarterback, and Stanford
still got the win to bring Hogan to 10-0
as a starter.
I think Hogan will bounce back
with a good performance against Utah.
He's a lot better than he played against
the Huskies, so there's no reason to
panic over his poor performance, but
there was one trend that is a bit trou
bling: Hogan's jitters in the pocket.
Washington barely pressured
Hogan. For most of the game, Wash
ington brought only four or five rash
el's and dropped the rest of their de
fenders in coverage. For the most part,
the offensive line was stout in protec
tion, but that message never got to
Hogan, who seemed to be in a rush
against a three-second clock to get the
ball out of his hands.
The problem with this strategy was
that the Huskies secondary shut down
Stanford's receivers. With six or seven
good defenders in pass coverage, the
Cardinal receivers needed a little extra
time to get open. Hogan had the time,
but wasn't waiting. He forced throws
before he needed to get rid of the ball,
and for that reason had serious trouble
getting anything going.
Still, as I mentioned earlier, those
mistakes are no reason to panic. While
Hogan has had similar struggles in the
past, he is rarely held down for too
long. We know that Hogan is a com
petitor, so a weak performance on a big
stage will be an effective motivator as
he prepares for Stanford's upcoming
games. And who knows? Maybe that
scare was exactly what the Cardinal
needed to avoid complacency which
has been a challenge since Stanford
burst onto the national stage in 2010.
If that doesn't happen, Utah could
give the Cardinal a serious scare, and
I'm not sure my heart can handle two
of those in one week.

still got the win to bring Hogan to 10-0
as a starter.
I think Hogan will bounce back
with a good performance against Utah.
He's a lot better than he played against
the Huskies, so there's no reason to
panic over his poor performance, but
there was one trend that is a bit trou
bling: Hogan's jitters in the pocket.
Washington barely pressured
Hogan. For most of the game, Wash
ington brought only four or five rash
el's and dropped the rest of their de
fenders in coverage. For the most part,
the offensive line was stout in protec
tion, but that message never got to
Hogan, who seemed to be in a rush
against a three-second clock to get the
ball out of his hands.
The problem with this strategy was
that the Huskies secondary shut down
Stanford's receivers. With six or seven
good defenders in pass coverage, the
Cardinal receivers needed a little extra
time to get open. Hogan had the time,
but wasn't waiting. He forced throws
before he needed to get rid of the ball,
and for that reason had serious trouble
getting anything going.
Still, as I mentioned earlier, those
mistakes are no reason to panic. While
Hogan has had similar struggles in the
past, he is rarely held down for too
long. We know that Hogan is a com
petitor, so a weak performance on a big
stage will be an effective motivator as
he prepares for Stanford's upcoming
games. And who knows? Maybe that
scare was exactly what the Cardinal
needed to avoid complacency which
has been a challenge since Stanford
burst onto the national stage in 2010.
If that doesn't happen, Utah could
give the Cardinal a serious scare, and
I'm not sure my heart can handle two
of those in one week.

Yes, Stanford had
scored 31 points, but
special teams was
directly responsible.

Well that was close.
As senior Ben
Rhyne trotted out
to punt the ball
back to the Huskies
with Stanford only leading by 3 and
two minutes remaining in the game, I
started mentally preparing myself
for a Stanford loss. Washington's of
fense was going to score.
It wouldn't have been the de
fense's fault either. Yes, Stanford had
scored 31 points, but special teams
was directly responsible for 14 of
them. After showing up briefly for
the end of the second quarter and
most of the third, the offense disap
peared down the stretch to the tune
of three consecutive three-and-outs
to end the game.
Now I don't care if you're taking
on the vintage Pittsburgh Steelers, a
good offense has to be able to get one
first down in that situation. Stanford
couldn't get it done, and that left Stan
ford's championship hopes hanging in
an awful balance.

But somehow, in classic Stanford
fashion most recently reminiscent of
the end of regulation against Arizona
in 2012, the fatigued and short-handed
defense came through and the Cardi
nal survived.
So, how do we move forward ft'om
that? Should we take a deep breath
and say "A win is a win," and move on?
Should we go into full panic mode and
start making Alamo Bowl plans? I
think the answer is somewhere in be
tween, but much closer to the former
than the latter.
Every team is going to have bad
games. Most of the time, great teams
can get away with this due to huge
matchup advantages. As we saw up
close on Saturday night, Stanford did
not have that large of a talent gap over
the Huskies, so the Cardinal's mis
takes were very apparent.
Anyone who watched the game
could notice that junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan was off his game. To put
it mildly, he did not look veiy good, with
the exception of a perfect deep ball to
junior wide receiver Ty Montgomery
at the end of the first half But that was
Hogan's first truly bad performance in
10 games at quarterback, and Stanford
still got the win to bring Hogan to 10-0
as a starter.
I think Hogan will bounce back
with a good performance against Utah.
