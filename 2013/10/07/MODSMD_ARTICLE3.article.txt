# Standardized class start times proposed
## FacSen to discuss uniform schedule 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
A new course scheduling pro
posal intended to help rational
ize scheduling by requiring
courses to adhere to a standard
ized set of start times will be dis
cussed at the Faculty Senate
meeting on Thursday.
The proposal, which was sent
to the Faculty Senate by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Harry Elam and Uni
versity Registrar Tom Black, is
similar to the one that the Facul
ty Senate discussed last Janu
ary. That version was revised
due to heavy student discontent
and pressure last spring.
The latest scheduling propos
al drops one of the most contro
versial requirements banning
students from double-booking
classes without a waiver but
preserves another contentious is
sue: starting classes at 8:30 a.m.
According to the memo, the
new meeting grid recommends
that all classes start on the half
hour from 8:30 a.m. until 7:30
p.m. Under the terms of the pro
posal, all classes must begin on
the half hour, but ending times
are more flexible to allow for
courses of different lengths.

Reducing chaos
W.E. Moerner, chair of the
Chemistry Department, said
that the new schedule will be a
wonderful improvement for stu
dents and pointed out the com
plications that the current
schedule causes.
"[Now], students sometimes
can't take a course because half

of it overlaps with some other
course," Moerner said. "If you
have a streamlined schedule,
you have more choices you
can either take section A or sec
tion B, but you won't have any
thing that will overlap both."
According to the memo,
there are currently 13 separate
starting times for classes be
tween 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. and 89
different meeting patterns.
"The biggest benefit [of the
new proposal] is much less chaos
when it comes to planning class
es," said ASSU Executive Dan
Ashton 'l4. "It is a much more
simplified and effective plan go
ing down from the ridiculous
messy chaos to something that
is a little more structured."

Starting early
While students have ex
pressed support for the stan
dardized schedule, there remain
concerns about starting classes
at 8:30 a.m.
At last January's Faculty
Senate meeting, Black said that
one rationale for beginning the
day early was opening up more
periods for athletes to take
classes in the morning before af
ternoon practices.
However, athletes noted that
many teams also have morning
practices or training sessions
that would conflict with 8:30 a.m.
classes. Zoe Wolford 'l4, a
coxswain on the lightweight

mornings per week.
"We already wake up at
5:30 a.m. for practice," Wol
ford said. "If class time was
earlier, there is a chance we
would have to move practice
back to accommodate every
one."
Will Drinkwater 'l6, a run
ner on the men's track and
field team, said that he had
thought a lot about the idea
but concluded that moving
the schedule "hurts [track
athletes] more than it helps
us."
Drinkwater said that he
hadn't had trouble filling out a
schedule under the current
conditions, and morning prac
tices would force his team to
adjust its training schedule.
"We have practice at 7:15
in the morning, and it usually
goes until 8:15 or sometimes
up until 9:30 [in the morn-

Scheduling diversity
The proposal also recom
mends that departments
schedule at least 50 percent of
their classes outside the peak
period of 10:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. to ensure "that classes
are offered at diverse times to
meet student needs while en
suring that classroom space is
fully utilized throughout the
day."
Last January, Black sug
gested to the Faculty Senate
that "departments could se
lect a handful of popular
classes and put them [at the
8:30 a.m. times] and then al
low them to rotate," in order
to take advantage of the new
time slot. Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences
Richard Sailer added during
the discussion that the Pro
gram in Human Biology
(Humßio) was ready to

schedule its core courses at
8:30 a.m.
The terms of the new pro
posal do not address which
classes would be moved to the
new time slot, as each depart
ment is responsible for set
ting its own schedule. Neither
Black nor a representative of
Humßio was available for
comment before press time.
Language Center director
Elizabeth Bernhardt said in
an email statement to The
Daily that language center
programs were already pre
pared to shift their schedule
for this current year.
"[A start time of] 8:30
doesn't bother us," Bernhardt

wrote. She added that the lan
guage center currently has
more than 200 sections at dif
ferent times.
Moerner said that the
Chemistry Department
would continue offering intro
ductory courses in both the
morning and the afternoon to
provide more opportunities
for students.
He added that the new
schedule would allow greater
flexibility in scheduling lab
times as the department adds
two-hour lab sessions for
first-year courses. He ex
plained that because lab ses
sions run all day, some stu
dents may prefer the sched
ule to start earlier so that lat
er lab sessions will also start
earlier and don't run into din
ner.
"At one end or the other,
you're going to make some
one not be the happiest,"
Moerner said. "There may
be some students who do like
the 8:30 start, and when you
give many options, you give
more opportunities for some
to take that and some to take
others."
Soliciting student feedback
Senator Ilya Mouzykantskii
'l6 said that the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate is con
sidering advocating for
pushing the schedule down
to begin at 9 a.m.
"This proposal... we like
the main part of it, but we're
not sure that 8:30 is the right
start time for classes,"
Mouzykantskii said. "We're
not sure of the effect that that
will have on the student body,
and we're really interested in
feedback from students in
trying to understand what
their views are on the issue."
He said ASSU represen
tatives were particularly in
terested in hearing from ath
letes and other student lead
ers and populations who are
concerned about the new

schedule.
Both Ashton and
Mouzykantskii expressed
concern about the amount of
sleep students would get un
der the new proposal, espe
cially since many Stanford
students tend to stay up late.
"There's a concern when
people are getting less sleep
than the low amount of sleep
that they're already getting,"
Ashton said. "Hopefully if stu
dents actually care about that,
they'll speak up when given the
opportunity and we can have a
voice."
Mouzykantskii said that the
Undergraduate Senate would
discuss the issue on Thesday

night and potentially vote on
how to represent the student
body before he and Ashton
make a presentation at the Fac
ulty Senate meeting on Thurs
day.
"We are for the most part
really happy that the registrar
has rationalized the course
schedule," Mouzykantskii said.
'A lot of effort has been put in
to this and we believe that this
is fundamentally good, and
the one small part that we
are now concerned about is
whether it is worth shifting
everything up half an hour."

Both Ashton and
Mouzykantskii expressed
concern about the amount of

On Thursday, the Faculty Senate will discuss a revised
course scheduling proposal that recommends all classes to
start on the half hour from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
A new course scheduling pro
posal intended to help rational
ize scheduling by requiring
courses to adhere to a standard
ized set of start times will be dis
cussed at the Faculty Senate
meeting on Thursday.
The proposal, which was sent
to the Faculty Senate by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Harry Elam and Uni
versity Registrar Tom Black, is
similar to the one that the Facul

due to heavy student discontent
and pressure last spring.
The latest scheduling propos
al drops one of the most contro
versial requirements banning
students from double-booking
classes without a waiver but
preserves another contentious is
sue: starting classes at 8:30 a.m.
According to the memo, the
new meeting grid recommends
that all classes start on the half
hour from 8:30 a.m. until 7:30
p.m. Under the terms of the pro
posal, all classes must begin on
the half hour, but ending times
are more flexible to allow for
courses of different lengths.

Reducing chaos
W.E. Moerner, chair of the
Chemistry Department, said
that the new schedule will be a
wonderful improvement for stu
dents and pointed out the com
plications that the current
schedule causes.
"[Now], students sometimes
can't take a course because half

of it overlaps with some other
course," Moerner said. "If you
have a streamlined schedule,
you have more choices you
can either take section A or sec
tion B, but you won't have any
thing that will overlap both."
According to the memo,
there are currently 13 separate
starting times for classes be
tween 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. and 89
different meeting patterns.
"The biggest benefit [of the
new proposal] is much less chaos
when it comes to planning class
es," said ASSU Executive Dan
Ashton 'l4. "It is a much more
simplified and effective plan go
ing down from the ridiculous
messy chaos to something that
is a little more structured."

Starting early
While students have ex
pressed support for the stan
dardized schedule, there remain
concerns about starting classes
at 8:30 a.m.
At last January's Faculty
Senate meeting, Black said that
one rationale for beginning the
day early was opening up more
periods for athletes to take
classes in the morning before af
ternoon practices.
However, athletes noted that
many teams also have morning
practices or training sessions
that would conflict with 8:30 a.m.

mornings per week.
"We already wake up at
5:30 a.m. for practice," Wol
ford said. "If class time was
earlier, there is a chance we
would have to move practice
back to accommodate every
one."
Will Drinkwater 'l6, a run
ner on the men's track and
field team, said that he had
thought a lot about the idea
but concluded that moving
the schedule "hurts [track
athletes] more than it helps
us."
Drinkwater said that he
hadn't had trouble filling out a
schedule under the current
conditions, and morning prac
tices would force his team to
adjust its training schedule.
"We have practice at 7:15
in the morning, and it usually
goes until 8:15 or sometimes
up until 9:30 [in the morn-

Scheduling diversity
The proposal also recom
mends that departments
schedule at least 50 percent of
their classes outside the peak
period of 10:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. to ensure "that classes
are offered at diverse times to
meet student needs while en
suring that classroom space is
fully utilized throughout the
day."
Last January, Black sug
gested to the Faculty Senate
that "departments could se
lect a handful of popular
classes and put them [at the
8:30 a.m. times] and then al
low them to rotate," in order
to take advantage of the new
time slot. Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences
Richard Sailer added during
the discussion that the Pro
gram in Human Biology
(Humßio) was ready to

schedule its core courses at
8:30 a.m.
The terms of the new pro
posal do not address which
classes would be moved to the
new time slot, as each depart
ment is responsible for set
ting its own schedule. Neither
Black nor a representative of
Humßio was available for
comment before press time.
Language Center director
Elizabeth Bernhardt said in
an email statement to The
Daily that language center
programs were already pre
pared to shift their schedule
for this current year.
"[A start time of] 8:30
doesn't bother us," Bernhardt

wrote. She added that the lan
guage center currently has
more than 200 sections at dif
ferent times.
Moerner said that the
Chemistry Department
would continue offering intro
ductory courses in both the
morning and the afternoon to
provide more opportunities
for students.
He added that the new
schedule would allow greater
flexibility in scheduling lab
times as the department adds
two-hour lab sessions for
first-year courses. He ex
plained that because lab ses
sions run all day, some stu
dents may prefer the sched

Drinkwater said that he

Scheduling diversity
The proposal also recom
mends that departments
schedule at least 50 percent of
their classes outside the peak
period of 10:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. to ensure "that classes
are offered at diverse times to
meet student needs while en
suring that classroom space is
fully utilized throughout the
day."
Last January, Black sug
gested to the Faculty Senate
that "departments could se
lect a handful of popular
classes and put them [at the
8:30 a.m. times] and then al
low them to rotate," in order
to take advantage of the new
time slot. Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences
Richard Sailer added during
the discussion that the Pro
gram in Human Biology
(Humßio) was ready to

schedule its core courses at
8:30 a.m.
The terms of the new pro
posal do not address which
classes would be moved to the
new time slot, as each depart
ment is responsible for set

Black nor a representative of
Humßio was available for
comment before press time.
Language Center director
Elizabeth Bernhardt said in
an email statement to The
Daily that language center
programs were already pre
pared to shift their schedule
for this current year.
"[A start time of] 8:30
doesn't bother us," Bernhardt

wrote. She added that the lan
guage center currently has
more than 200 sections at dif
ferent times.
Moerner said that the
Chemistry Department
would continue offering intro
ductory courses in both the
morning and the afternoon to
provide more opportunities
for students.
He added that the new
schedule would allow greater
flexibility in scheduling lab
times as the department adds
two-hour lab sessions for
first-year courses. He ex
plained that because lab ses
sions run all day, some stu
dents may prefer the sched
ule to start earlier so that lat
er lab sessions will also start
earlier and don't run into din
ner.
"At one end or the other,
you're going to make some
one not be the happiest,"
Moerner said. "There may
be some students who do like
the 8:30 start, and when you
give many options, you give
more opportunities for some
to take that and some to take
others."
Soliciting student feedback
Senator Ilya Mouzykantskii
'l6 said that the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate is con
sidering advocating for
pushing the schedule down
to begin at 9 a.m.
"This proposal... we like
the main part of it, but we're
not sure that 8:30 is the right
start time for classes,"
Mouzykantskii said. "We're
not sure of the effect that that
will have on the student body,
and we're really interested in
feedback from students in
trying to understand what
their views are on the issue."
He said ASSU represen
tatives were particularly in
terested in hearing from ath
letes and other student lead
ers and populations who are
concerned about the new

schedule.
Both Ashton and
Mouzykantskii expressed
concern about the amount of
sleep students would get un
der the new proposal, espe
cially since many Stanford
students tend to stay up late.
"There's a concern when
people are getting less sleep
than the low amount of sleep
that they're already getting,"
Ashton said. "Hopefully if stu
dents actually care about that,
they'll speak up when given the
opportunity and we can have a
voice."
Mouzykantskii said that the
Undergraduate Senate would
discuss the issue on Thesday

night and potentially vote on
how to represent the student
body before he and Ashton
make a presentation at the Fac
ulty Senate meeting on Thurs
day.
"We are for the most part
really happy that the registrar
has rationalized the course
schedule," Mouzykantskii said.
'A lot of effort has been put in
to this and we believe that this
is fundamentally good, and
the one small part that we
are now concerned about is
whether it is worth shifting
everything up half an hour."

On Thursday, the Faculty Senate will discuss a revised
course scheduling proposal that recommends all classes to
start on the half hour from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
A new course scheduling pro
posal intended to help rational
ize scheduling by requiring
courses to adhere to a standard
ized set of start times will be dis
cussed at the Faculty Senate
meeting on Thursday.
The proposal, which was sent
to the Faculty Senate by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Harry Elam and Uni
versity Registrar Tom Black, is
similar to the one that the Facul
ty Senate discussed last Janu
ary. That version was revised
due to heavy student discontent
and pressure last spring.
The latest scheduling propos
al drops one of the most contro
versial requirements banning
students from double-booking
classes without a waiver but
preserves another contentious is
sue: starting classes at 8:30 a.m.
According to the memo, the
new meeting grid recommends
that all classes start on the half
hour from 8:30 a.m. until 7:30
p.m. Under the terms of the pro
posal, all classes must begin on
the half hour, but ending times
are more flexible to allow for
courses of different lengths.

Reducing chaos
W.E. Moerner, chair of the
Chemistry Department, said
that the new schedule will be a
wonderful improvement for stu
dents and pointed out the com
plications that the current
schedule causes.
"[Now], students sometimes
can't take a course because half

of it overlaps with some other
course," Moerner said. "If you
have a streamlined schedule,
you have more choices you
can either take section A or sec
tion B, but you won't have any
thing that will overlap both."
According to the memo,
there are currently 13 separate
starting times for classes be
tween 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. and 89
different meeting patterns.
"The biggest benefit [of the
new proposal] is much less chaos
when it comes to planning class
es," said ASSU Executive Dan
Ashton 'l4. "It is a much more
simplified and effective plan go
ing down from the ridiculous
messy chaos to something that
is a little more structured."

Starting early
While students have ex
pressed support for the stan
dardized schedule, there remain
concerns about starting classes
at 8:30 a.m.
At last January's Faculty
Senate meeting, Black said that
one rationale for beginning the
day early was opening up more
periods for athletes to take
classes in the morning before af
ternoon practices.
However, athletes noted that
many teams also have morning
practices or training sessions
that would conflict with 8:30 a.m.
classes. Zoe Wolford 'l4, a
coxswain on the lightweight
rowing team, said that earlier
start times for classes would
negatively affect her because
her team practices two or three
ing]," Drinkwater said. "So ei
ther way, whether it's a long
practice or a short practice, it
would bump right up against
that 8:30 time."

mornings per week.
"We already wake up at
5:30 a.m. for practice," Wol
ford said. "If class time was
earlier, there is a chance we
would have to move practice
back to accommodate every
one."
Will Drinkwater 'l6, a run
ner on the men's track and
field team, said that he had
thought a lot about the idea
but concluded that moving
the schedule "hurts [track
athletes] more than it helps
