# Standardized class start times proposed
## FacSen to discuss uniform schedule 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
A new course scheduling pro
posal intended to help rational
ize scheduling by requiring
courses to adhere to a standard
ized set of start times will be dis
cussed at the Faculty Senate
meeting on Thursday.
The proposal, which was sent
to the Faculty Senate by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Harry Elam and Uni
versity Registrar Tom Black, is
similar to the one that the Facul
ty Senate discussed last Janu
ary. That version was revised
due to heavy student discontent
and pressure last spring.
The latest scheduling propos
al drops one of the most contro
versial requirements banning
students from double-booking
classes without a waiver but
preserves another contentious is
sue: starting classes at 8:30 a.m.
According to the memo, the
new meeting grid recommends
that all classes start on the half
hour from 8:30 a.m. until 7:30
p.m. Under the terms of the pro
posal, all classes must begin on
the half hour, but ending times
are more flexible to allow for
courses of different lengths.

Reducing chaos
W.E. Moerner, chair of the
Chemistry Department, said
that the new schedule will be a
wonderful improvement for stu
dents and pointed out the com
plications that the current
schedule causes.
"[Now], students sometimes
can't take a course because half

of it overlaps with some other
course," Moerner said. "If you
have a streamlined schedule,
you have more choices you
can either take section A or sec
tion B, but you won't have any
thing that will overlap both."
According to the memo,
there are currently 13 separate
starting times for classes be
tween 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. and 89
different meeting patterns.
"The biggest benefit [of the
new proposal] is much less chaos
when it comes to planning class
es," said ASSU Executive Dan
Ashton 'l4. "It is a much more
simplified and effective plan go
ing down from the ridiculous
messy chaos to something that
is a little more structured."

Starting early
While students have ex
pressed support for the stan
dardized schedule, there remain
concerns about starting classes
at 8:30 a.m.
At last January's Faculty
Senate meeting, Black said that
one rationale for beginning the
day early was opening up more
periods for athletes to take
classes in the morning before af
ternoon practices.
However, athletes noted that
many teams also have morning
practices or training sessions
that would conflict with 8:30 a.m.
classes. Zoe Wolford 'l4, a
coxswain on the lightweight
rowing team, said that earlier
start times for classes would
negatively affect her because
her team practices two or three
