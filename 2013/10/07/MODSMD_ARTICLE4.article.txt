## New alumni fund in development Students to launch Cardinal Fund platform in support of creative projects 
### HANNAH GRACE 
Stanford students Ryan Atallah 'l6 and Eric
Smalls 'l6 are developing a beta for Cardinal
Fund, a crowd-funding platform for Stanford
alumni to financially support students' creative
projects, which they plan to launch early in win
ter quarter.
Emphasizing the creative process of bring
ing art and technology together, the founding
paii l envision the platform serving many pur
poses for students, alumni, the University as a
whole and even the surrounding community.
Stanford students inspired to undertake var
ious projects such as creating a computer sci
ence program for girls in local schools or build
ing a thoughtful sculpture in a public place
can pitch their ideas on the Cardinal Fund web
site. Stanford alumni interested in donating
may complete a questionnaire about their inter
ests and time at Stanford.
Atallah and Smalls first plan to manually
match alumni to 10 to 15 initial student projects,
but eventually they hope to carry out the
process algorithmically as the platform grows.
In this way, the sophomores hope to give alumni
a more satisfying experience when giving mon
ey to Stanford.
'Alumni want to see where then* money is
going," Smalls said. "It is an exciting thing to
see a project come to fruition."
Atallah added that the validation and sup
port of student projects is a critical facet of their
mission.
"If you feel that you have the ability to just
go out and create something that is worth creat
ing, then you become willing to just try any
thing," Atallah said.
In the long run, as the platform grows, the
fundamental premise of the Cardinal Ffind will
not be limited to alumni and undergraduates.
"It's not even restricted to Stanford," Atal
lah said.
The Cardinal Fund founders also hope that
students will undertake endeavors that will pro
mote positive social change. Smalls wants peo
ple to get excited about social impact.
"We want to grow that culture," Smalls said.
Atallah and Smalls are also working to secure
a "maker space," a place on campus
where students can be around oth
ers who are creating or working on
various projects. Smalls is especially
enthusiastic about focusing purely
on the creative process and endors
ing a community of creators at Stan
ford.

The Cardinal Fund website itself
serves as a place where students
with similar interests can connect.
Atallah and Smalls plan to keep a
record of every activity on the site,
so students interested in collaborat
ing with peers can find someone
with similar interests or ideas.
Students can also find unfinished
projects and continue a project an
other student did not complete.
