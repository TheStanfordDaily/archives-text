## Stanford creates NYC exchange program Stanford graduate students teach courses at the City College of New York 
### MAX WANG 
A new partnership between Stanford and the
City College of New York (CCNY) has resulted
in a cross-country exchange of students and
ideas.
The collaboration aims to promote graduate
level humanities research among minority and
first-generation college students. Through the
exchange program, three Stanford graduate stu
dents are currently teaching classes at CCNY, a
position granting them access to a city consid
ered one of the world's centers for humanities
research, said Lanier Anderson, exchange pro

gram director and an associate professor of phi
losophy.
Ten CCNY undergraduate students were se
lected to conduct their own research this past
summer under the guidance of a Stanford pro
fessor on campus.
The idea for the program arose after Stan
ford withdrew its application to build an applied
sciences center in New York City, Anderson said.
"Because of the centrality of NYC as a center
for a lot of humanistic inquiry... it was thought
that there was really an opportunity to benefit
the humanities and arts at Stanford by having
some role in the New York initiative in general to
realize those benefits," Anderson said.

gram's costs. At Stanford, the pro
gram is funded by the Office of the
Provost, said Humanities and Arts
Initiatives Coordinator Katie Mc-
Donough M.A. 'O9 Ph.D. 'l3.
"It's offering a sustained rela
tionship between two schools that
doesn't occur in any other sort of
program," McDonough said.

While the program works with
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences' Summer Research Early
Identification Program (SR-EIP)
which adopts a similar goal of
promoting research among
groups underrepresented in all
research areas the partnership
with CCNY also strives to build a
sense of community, a task that is
hard to accomplish under the mul
ti-institutional structure of the
SR-EIP program, according to
Anderson.
"One thing that [CCNY] stu
dents don't get is an experience of
living in a residential university
community, where you're sur
rounded all the time with people
engaged by scholarship and
study" said Blake Francis Ph.D.

toral student in philosophy
"Most the students there are
from New York, and stay in the
same apartment or house when
they head to school," Francis
added.
Social activities, such as pizza

parties and movie nights, were
planned for CCNY students over
the summer at Stanford to help
them bond with each other and be
part of a larger community.
Derek Vanderpool M.A. 'O7
Ph.D. 'l4, a writing tutor for the
summer program and a graduate
student in history, noted the di
versity of the students from CC
NY.
"There was a level of diversity
that we don't have here at Stan
ford. They brought different per
spectives and different questions,"
Vanderpool said. "There was a stu
dent that was looking at the issue
of bilingual education from a legal
perspective, and he tied it to his
own personal background, which
was very interesting to me."
However, Vanderpool added
that the CCNY students and Stan
ford peers have more in common
than they do differences.
City impacts Stanford graduate
students' research
As part of the exchange, three
Stanford graduate students in the
humanities two studying Eng
lish and one studying philosophy
are currently teaching at CCNY.
According to Arezoo Islami
Ph.D. 'l4, a Stanford philosophy
graduate student teaching at CC
NY this quarter, the classes that
she is auditing have influenced
her research ideas.
"Some of the classes Pm taking
are questioning the assumptions
which my dissertation is based
on," Islami said. "And that's amaz
ing it's magical to look at
the whole project from a different
point of view."
Simply being in New York City
may also change students' ap

proaches to research.
"One might think that how and
where they live is independent of
their research, saying, 'You can do
research anywhere you want,'" Is
lami said. "I don't think that's
true. I think the movement opens
up our mental space. And New
York City and this college are very
diverse places with very diverse
ideas."
