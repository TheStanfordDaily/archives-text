City College of New York (CCNY) has resulted
in a cross-country exchange of students and
ideas.
The collaboration aims to promote graduate

position granting them access to a city consid

the humanities and arts at Stanford by having
some role in the New York initiative in general to
realize those benefits," Anderson said.
