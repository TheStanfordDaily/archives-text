## Class Owl startup integrated into Coursework, helps scheduling 
### KYLIE JUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Class Owl, a startup founded by
Julienne Lam 'l3 and Sam Purtill
'l3, recently became integrated into
Course Work with the goal of tack
ling scheduling problems by exam
ining class schedules and course
evaluations.
"[During] my freshman year at
Stanford, it was very overwhelming
adjusting to your new environment
and not really know how to navigate

the whole system," Lam said.
Class Owl aggregates a student's
classes and allows students and
professors to keep track of all as
signments. Associate Vice Provost
for Student Affairs and University
Registrar Thomas Black provided
Class Owl with the official course
evaluation data collected by Stan
ford at the end of each quarter.
"I became interested in seeing if
I could help them think through the
kinds of things that they would of
fer in the application," Black said.

Black sent out an email to stu
dents last week notifying the inte
gration of Class Owl into Course-
Work.
"I thought it was something that
was missing in the present iteration
of Course Work, and, quite frankly,
[the founders of Class Owl] did too,"
Black said.
Like many other startups, Clas
s Owl's story began with paper pro
totyping.
"We started off with paper pro
totypes," Lam said. "[lt's] some
thing that you only see in movies
like playing on whiteboards and us
ing chalk and such."
After prototyping the product's
features and examining the compa
ny's branding, the team launched
the pilot version of Class Owl in
2012 to gather user feedback.
"We held focus groups with pro
fessors about 30 different Stan
ford professors and maybe about 50
different Stanford students to see
how they interacted with the site,"
Lam said.
In the summer of 2011, Clas
s Owl participated in StartX, a non
profit startup incubator, which pro
vided them with not only office
space and legal assistance, but also
a community of mentors across dif
ferent areas, Lam added. During its
time in the incubator, the company
signed its first contract with the
University.
The development period for
Class Owl began in February 2012,
and the product was released to
students just two months later. Ac
cording to Lam, 1,200 students
signed up for the application during

the first four weeks.
"We were also all in school at the
time," Lam said. "Essentially, it like
was a full-time job on top of a full
time job."
Since releasing the product to
the market by selling the contract
in August, the team has continued
to develop the product and collect
user feedback.
So far, on-campus reviews have
been positive.
"The No. 1 thing that we've re
ceived in terms of feedback is that
it's extremely intuitive and easy-to
use and simple," Lam said.
Student user Chris Barber 'l6
has been an advocate for Class Owl
ever since it launched.
"To me Class Owl is just a huge
time-saver," Barber said. "People
maybe don't realize how much
they're trying to keep in their
heads, and it's nice when you have
it all down and you don't have to
worry about what's coming up."
Beyond the farm, Class Owl is
launching its first high school pi
lot at a public school in Los Ange

les along with its mobile applica
tion, which will be available within
the next month. Meanwhile, it has
also partnered with Pearson, the
largest education book publishing
company in the world, to expand
its user base.
"Working with Pearson, we're
hoping that we can get Class Owl
into the hands of every student in
the United States," Lam said.
Black believes that Class Owl
has the potential to follow in the
footsteps of other successful Stan
ford startups.
"I would love to see them vast
ly successful," Black said.
"We've had a couple of student
groups, as a result of some of the
applications they've written, be
come successful such as the
terribly clever team that devel
oped
iStanford," he added. "That just is
so Stanford, it seems. So I'd like to
see Class Owl equally successful."
