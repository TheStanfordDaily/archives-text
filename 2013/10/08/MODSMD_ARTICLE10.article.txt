The Stanford men's soccer
team (6-2-1, 1-1-0 Pac-12) re
bounded from their loss to then
third-ranked Washington (7-0-3,
1-0-1) on Sunday afternoon and
defeated Oregon State (7-4-0, 0-
2-0) 2-1 at home in a scoreline
that seemed to flatter the visi
tors. Stanford dominated chances
and possession throughout the
game,

with senior goalkeeper Drew
Hutchins rendered a spectator
for the majority of the game and
senior and junior fullbacks Tyler
Conklin and Jimmy Callinan con
stantly creating scoring opportu
nities with some beautifully
weighted through balls.
"I thought we played fantastic
today," said head coach Jeremy
Gunn after the game. "A couple of
our chances were breathtaking.
We kept getting chances and cre
ating opportunities against a
very good Oregon State team. We
deserved the result."
On Saturday, it was hard to
dispute that fact, as Stanford
should perhaps have been one or
two goals ahead well before the
breakthrough was made in the

29th minute. The early play was
characterized by a series of dan
gerous Stanford crosses that
ended in goal-scoring opportuni
ties, with senior center back Matt
Taylor heading just over the goal
in the 12th minute and crosses
from both sophomore winger
Aaron Kovar and redshirt sopho
more Eric Verso narrowly miss
ing their intended targets. The
best chance of the opening ex
changes fell to freshman forward
Jordan Morris, who was released
by a lovely lofted through ball by
Callinan, only to see his one-on
one stopped by a great save from
Oregon State goalkeeper Matt
Bersano.
Having already registered a
large number of chances, it came
as no surprise when junior for
ward Zach Batteer opened the
scoring with a looping header in
to the far corner after a cross
from Callinan, beating his de
fender in the air and unleashing a
header Bersano could do nothing
about. However, Oregon State
tied the game quickly after on its
first real chance of the match.
Beaver midfielder Mike Reck
meyer latched onto a ball in the
box and sent it to freshman mid
fielder Ole Sandnes, who slotted
it past a diving Hutchins.
Stanford, though, fought back
after the break. The Cardinal
came out for the second half with

much of the same control of terri
tory and chances, with Batteer and
Morris both being denied by
Bersano. The pressure continued
to build for the Card, and in the
end, Oregon State finally broke.
Morris picked up the ball on the
halfway line, beat one defender,
cut past the covering junior mid
fielder Will Seymore and laid the
ball off to Batteer. Batteer imme
diately squared the ball back to
Morris, who placed it in the bottom
left corner for his third goal of the
season.

The rest of the game was fairly
comfortable for Stanford, with fur
ther scoring chances going beg
ging as Kovar blazed a shot over
the bar in the 88th minute. On the
defensive end, Hutchins only had
to watch a Daniel Van Vleet head
er go past the post, as the rest of
his night was uneventful.
Stanford now embarks on a dif
ficult three-game road trip that
will take the Cardinal to sixth
ranked UCLA, San Diego State
and third-ranked Cal.
Thursday's match at UCLA is
scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. and
will be broadcast on the Pac-12
Networks.
