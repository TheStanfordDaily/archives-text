## INSTANT REPLAY: THE ZONE READ 
### WINSTSON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There are a lot of cliches that can accurately
be used to describe Stanford's 31-28 escape
against Washington on Saturday night both
teams played hard and left everything on the
field, there was a great deal of physical play
across the board, playmakers on each team
made clutch plays again and again, and so on.
But an underrated element the game was the
amount of creativity and fluidity that both teams

brought to both sides of the ball. Stanford won,
but it wasn't because the Cardinal ran the same
play sixty times.
In a game as close as this one, every possible
advantage counted. Fans in Stanford Stadium
may not have expected that one field goal would
determine the outcome of the game, but as it
turned out, that was the difference. This 19-yard
run by quarterback Kevin Hogan led to the field
goal that provided Stanford's final victory mar
gin. Giving Stanford a 10-point lead, Washington
was forced to chase Stanford all game, and they

eventually fell just short. To do that, Stanford
freed up Hogan in what was a schematic work of
art.
Stanford lined up in a heavily unbalanced set:
four out of five potential receivers to the right of
the quarterback, with running back Tyler
Gaffney light behind Hogan. Understandably,
Washington wanted to brtng in as many defend
ers to Stanford's strong side as possible, but
overreacting to the unbalanced formation, the
Huskies left only four players to the weak
side.
Stanford's formation seemed to be heavily
biased towards the right, but it also displayed
remarkable balance in the backfield. With
three players behind the line of scrimmage,
Stanford could easily flip six offensive players
(including F) to the weak side and overwhelm
the Washington defense.
As it was, Stanford did exactly that. Call
ing the übiquitous zone read play, Stanford's
offensive line blocked to the right in unison,
drawing the Washington defense's attention
to the right. After receiving the snap, Kevin
Hogan had a choice: He could hand off the
ball to Tyler Gaffney (R) going inside or keep
the ball himself and run to the left. The
choice depended on whether the Washington
cornerback (circled in red) defended the out
side or the inside Hogan would direct the
ball wherever the cornerback was not.
That is nothing new. Although it only re
cently took the NFL by storm, the zone read
has been one of the most popular plays in col
lege football for years. Defenses will typical
ly block off the outside keeper and force the
play to go towards the strong side, making
the play look like a conventional run. What

Stanford added to this play, however, was an
arc block by the fullback, Ryan Hewitt (F).
Because Hewitt was to the right of Hogan,
the defense added strength to the right of
Hogan. Since Hewitt was so close to the left
side however, it was easy to flip the strength
of the formation to the left. Stanford's extra
blocking added a dose of old-school football
to a modern, trendy spread-offense play.
Washington went one way, and Stanford
went the other: With Hewitt lead blocking
for him, Hogan had plenty of room to run
and slashed deep into Washington territory.
Although Chris Ault, lately of Nevada, was
well known for running this play, it was iron
ically the NFL that popularized it specifi
cally, inventive running teams such as Jim
Harbaugh's San Francisco 49ers.
Power football is not necessarily staid; on
the contrary, it is inventive, creative and
schematically devastating. On this play,
Stanford took advantage of both numbers
and leverage numbers because of the bal
anced "unbalanced" set, but also leverage be
cause Stanford's blockers knew where they
were going and the defense did not. Wash
ington was caught literally flat-footed, and
the result was one of many plays that gave
birth to an instant classic.
On this play, the author is indebted
to the keen insight of ESPN/Grantland
columnist Chris Brown.

teams played hard and left everything on the
field, there was a great deal of physical play
across the board, playmakers on each team
made clutch plays again and again, and so on.
But an underrated element the game was the
amount of creativity and fluidity that both teams

brought to both sides of the ball. Stanford won,
but it wasn't because the Cardinal ran the same
play sixty times.
In a game as close as this one, every possible
advantage counted. Fans in Stanford Stadium
may not have expected that one field goal would
determine the outcome of the game, but as it
turned out, that was the difference. This 19-yard
run by quarterback Kevin Hogan led to the field
goal that provided Stanford's final victory mar
gin. Giving Stanford a 10-point lead, Washington
was forced to chase Stanford all game, and they

eventually fell just short. To do that, Stanford
freed up Hogan in what was a schematic work of
art.
Stanford lined up in a heavily unbalanced set:
four out of five potential receivers to the right of
the quarterback, with running back Tyler
Gaffney light behind Hogan. Understandably,
Washington wanted to brtng in as many defend
ers to Stanford's strong side as possible, but
overreacting to the unbalanced formation, the
Huskies left only four players to the weak
side.
Stanford's formation seemed to be heavily
biased towards the right, but it also displayed
remarkable balance in the backfield. With
three players behind the line of scrimmage,
Stanford could easily flip six offensive players
(including F) to the weak side and overwhelm
the Washington defense.
As it was, Stanford did exactly that. Call
ing the übiquitous zone read play, Stanford's
offensive line blocked to the right in unison,
drawing the Washington defense's attention
to the right. After receiving the snap, Kevin
Hogan had a choice: He could hand off the
ball to Tyler Gaffney (R) going inside or keep
the ball himself and run to the left. The
choice depended on whether the Washington
cornerback (circled in red) defended the out
side or the inside Hogan would direct the
ball wherever the cornerback was not.
That is nothing new. Although it only re
cently took the NFL by storm, the zone read
has been one of the most popular plays in col
lege football for years. Defenses will typical
ly block off the outside keeper and force the
play to go towards the strong side, making
the play look like a conventional run. What

Stanford added to this play, however, was an
arc block by the fullback, Ryan Hewitt (F).
Because Hewitt was to the right of Hogan,
the defense added strength to the right of
Hogan. Since Hewitt was so close to the left
side however, it was easy to flip the strength
of the formation to the left. Stanford's extra
blocking added a dose of old-school football
to a modern, trendy spread-offense play.
Washington went one way, and Stanford
went the other: With Hewitt lead blocking
for him, Hogan had plenty of room to run
and slashed deep into Washington territory.
Although Chris Ault, lately of Nevada, was
well known for running this play, it was iron
ically the NFL that popularized it specifi
cally, inventive running teams such as Jim
Harbaugh's San Francisco 49ers.
Power football is not necessarily staid; on
the contrary, it is inventive, creative and
schematically devastating. On this play,
Stanford took advantage of both numbers
and leverage numbers because of the bal
anced "unbalanced" set, but also leverage be
cause Stanford's blockers knew where they
were going and the defense did not. Wash
ington was caught literally flat-footed, and
the result was one of many plays that gave
birth to an instant classic.
On this play, the author is indebted
to the keen insight of ESPN/Grantland
columnist Chris Brown.
