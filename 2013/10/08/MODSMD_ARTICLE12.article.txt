# A 						first take on the selection committee
## 
### Ashley Westhem 
Last spring, the BCS confer
ence commissioners an
nounced that there would
be a new system for deter
mining each year's BCS
champion. There has been substan
tial controversy in the past surround
ing the validity of the Bowl Champi
onship Series, in which the top two
teams automatically get to play in
that year's BCS championship game.
There are differing opinions circu
lating as to why the old system didn't
work most obvious is that there
are differing rankings based on dif
ferent polls. For me, there's more to
consider in choosing the best possible
matchup for the championship game.
A computer-generated ranking isn't
going to necessarily give you the
most exciting game. And aren't we all
a bit tired of seeing Alabama blow out
its opponent?
I think just the fact that Alabama
beat LSU in a shutout in 2012 and
beat Notre Dame by 28 in last sea
son's championship proves that there
has to be a better way to ensure a
more competitive game.
And so the novel concept: People
heavily involved in and familiar with
football could probably do a better
job in picking a successful matchup of
four teams to compete in a playoff
style system than the cold calcula
tions of a computer.
Thus, the College Football Playoff
was born.
However, there might be even
more controversy surrounding the
beginnings of this system than there
was before. How are the 12 to 18
members of the selection committee
going to be selected themselves? And
how do you determine which athletic
director or administrator or former
player is more qualified?
Obviously, the committee needs to
be made up of people who have good
football knowledge and some kind of
experience or connection to the game
or sports in general. The "five power
conferences" the ACC, Big 12, Big
Ten, Pac-12 and SEC —will all have
at least one athletic director on the
committee.
There is inevitably going to be a
perceived bias, as anyone who is con
sidered will have some tie to a college.
Therefore, the goal is simply to get a
diverse representation of schools and
regions in the mix. Ultimately,
though, when the committee is offi
cially announced on Nov. 11, there
will be plenty of assumptions regard
less of who makes the final cut.
Right now, the names that have
been prematurely released are rela
tively predictable and understand
able: Wisconsin Athletic Director
Barry Alvarez, USC Athletic Direc
tor Pat Haden, Arkansas Athletic Di
rector Jeff Long, West Virginia Ath
letic Director Oliver Luck and Clem
son Athletic Director Dan
Radakovich, former Ole Miss and
NFL quarterback Archie Manning,
former NCAA Executive Vice Presi
dent Tom Jernstedt and former Big
East Commissioner Mike Tranghese.
And then you have the outlier of
the group: Condoleezza Rice. Huh?
Rice has reportedly held a big
paid in recruiting Stanford football
prospects to attend Stanford and has
even announced her desire to be
NFL Commissioner, but I'm not so
sure that qualifies her to be on the
committee. She would add diversity
to the mix, and I'm totally in support
of having a female on the committee
but why Rice and not a female ath
letic director, such as Julie Hermann
of Rutgers or Sandy Barbour of Cal?
I'm not saying I'm completely
against Rice being chosen. She obvi
ously has an invested interest in col
lege football and has been involved
with Stanford Athletics, but I'm not
so sure that those are valid enough
justifications. Maybe the added dy
namic and opinion that she could
throw in as a curve ball every once in
a while is ample reason to have her on
the committee.
In any case, until the committee is
selected and then approved by all the
college football fans out there —who
are sure to have some initial com
plaints and misgivings the College
Football Playoff will be more of a has
sle than the BCS system.
Hopefully, in the long run, it will
be successful and provide us with
some more exciting games than Al
abama's blowouts. In the meantime,
let us appreciate the last season of the
top two teams contending in the
championship game, and may the
BCS rest in peace.

College Football Playoff committee
needs another female 'member to
jo in Condoleezza Rice. To tell Ashley

are differing rankings based on dif
ferent polls. For me, there's more to
consider in choosing the best possible
matchup for the championship game.
A computer-generated ranking isn't
going to necessarily give you the
most exciting game. And aren't we all
a bit tired of seeing Alabama blow out
its opponent?
I think just the fact that Alabama
beat LSU in a shutout in 2012 and
beat Notre Dame by 28 in last sea
son's championship proves that there
has to be a better way to ensure a
more competitive game.
And so the novel concept: People
heavily involved in and familiar with
football could probably do a better
job in picking a successful matchup of
four teams to compete in a playoff
style system than the cold calcula
tions of a computer.
Thus, the College Football Playoff
was born.
However, there might be even
more controversy surrounding the
beginnings of this system than there
was before. How are the 12 to 18
members of the selection committee
going to be selected themselves? And
how do you determine which athletic
director or administrator or former
player is more qualified?
Obviously, the committee needs to
be made up of people who have good
football knowledge and some kind of
experience or connection to the game
or sports in general. The "five power
conferences" the ACC, Big 12, Big
Ten, Pac-12 and SEC —will all have
at least one athletic director on the
committee.
There is inevitably going to be a
perceived bias, as anyone who is con
sidered will have some tie to a college.
Therefore, the goal is simply to get a
diverse representation of schools and
regions in the mix. Ultimately,
though, when the committee is offi
cially announced on Nov. 11, there
will be plenty of assumptions regard
less of who makes the final cut.
Right now, the names that have
been prematurely released are rela
tively predictable and understand
able: Wisconsin Athletic Director
Barry Alvarez, USC Athletic Direc
tor Pat Haden, Arkansas Athletic Di
rector Jeff Long, West Virginia Ath
letic Director Oliver Luck and Clem
son Athletic Director Dan
Radakovich, former Ole Miss and
NFL quarterback Archie Manning,
former NCAA Executive Vice Presi
dent Tom Jernstedt and former Big
East Commissioner Mike Tranghese.
And then you have the outlier of
the group: Condoleezza Rice. Huh?
Rice has reportedly held a big
paid in recruiting Stanford football
prospects to attend Stanford and has
even announced her desire to be
NFL Commissioner, but I'm not so
sure that qualifies her to be on the
committee. She would add diversity
to the mix, and I'm totally in support
of having a female on the committee
but why Rice and not a female ath
letic director, such as Julie Hermann
of Rutgers or Sandy Barbour of Cal?
I'm not saying I'm completely
against Rice being chosen. She obvi
ously has an invested interest in col
lege football and has been involved
with Stanford Athletics, but I'm not
so sure that those are valid enough
justifications. Maybe the added dy
namic and opinion that she could
throw in as a curve ball every once in
a while is ample reason to have her on
the committee.
In any case, until the committee is
selected and then approved by all the
college football fans out there —who
are sure to have some initial com
plaints and misgivings the College
Football Playoff will be more of a has
sle than the BCS system.
Hopefully, in the long run, it will
be successful and provide us with
some more exciting games than Al
abama's blowouts. In the meantime,
let us appreciate the last season of the
top two teams contending in the
championship game, and may the
BCS rest in peace.

College Football Playoff committee
needs another female 'member to
jo in Condoleezza Rice. To tell Ashley
why she is totally qualified, email

Last spring, the BCS confer
ence commissioners an
nounced that there would
be a new system for deter
mining each year's BCS
champion. There has been substan
tial controversy in the past surround
ing the validity of the Bowl Champi
onship Series, in which the top two
teams automatically get to play in
that year's BCS championship game.
There are differing opinions circu
lating as to why the old system didn't
work most obvious is that there
are differing rankings based on dif
ferent polls. For me, there's more to
consider in choosing the best possible
matchup for the championship game.
