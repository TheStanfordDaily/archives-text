290 all-purpose yards for wide receiver and kick returner Ty
Montgomery on Saturday against Washington
The junior from Dallas had a night for the ages. Montgomery returned the opening
kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown and later scored on a 39-yard touchdown pass from
Kevin Hogan just before the end of the first half. In short, Montgomery seemingly had a
response for every time the Huskies appeared to gain momentum.
tackles by fifth-year senior linebacker Shayne Skov
Stanford's defensive stalwart helped will the Cardinal defense to a fourth-quarter stand
near midfield that sealed the victory over the Huskies. Skov also added 11/2 sacks in the
31 -28 win.
44. ' yards per punt average by punter Ben Rhyne
The senior from Charlotte, N.C., helped establish the decisive field-position advantage
that Stanford enjoyed for most of Saturday's game. Two of Rhyne's six punts pinned
Washington inside its own 20, forcing quarterback Keith Price and the Husky offense to
travel close to the length of the field on a majority of Washington's drives.
13 consecutive victories for the Cardinal.
Stanford extended the nation's second-longest winning streak, improving to 5-0 on the
season. Over the course of those 13 wins, the Card has notched victories over six top
-25 opponents, with wins against every Pac-12 North Division team.
