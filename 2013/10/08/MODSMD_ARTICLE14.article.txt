## BELTWAY PERSPECTIVES Government Taken Hostage 
### Nick Ahamed 
You might think that the scari
est part of last week was
Thursday afternoon, when
shots erupted from directly outside
my Constitution Avenue office.
You'd be wrong. By far, it was the
hostage crisis I witnessed in the na
tion's capital at 11:59 on Monday
night.
By law, Congress is required to
pass an annual federal budget to
fund "discretionary programs."
That budget consists of 12 appropri
ations bills that encapsulate various
federal programs. These appropria
tions differ from the other primary
type of legislation: authorization
bills. The latter creates the pro
grams while the former funds them.
However, discretionary pro
grams are anything but discre
tionary. Both the Department of
Homeland Security and the FDA
are considered discretionary pro
grams, yet these programs are still
vital services. Note that the Afford
able Care Act (ACA) aka "Oba
macare" —is not discretionary
spending, it's a mandatory pro
gram. This will be important later.
Historically, we pass all 12 ap
propriations bills. Lately, we've
passed only a few. This year, we
passed none. Nevertheless, the gov
ernment largely continues to func
tion. Some programs lose funding,
but Congress traditionally passes
stopgap temporary measures
called "continuing resolutions" (or
CR's) to maintain discretionary
spending at their current levels.
Our most recent CR financed the
government through the fiscal year
2013, which ended last Monday
night.
That brings us back to our cur
rent hostage crisis. A few Republi
cans denied a vote on a normal CR
that would extend spending for 10
weeks (now six weeks). Instead,
they insisted on attaching a "non
germane" rider one that would
defund the ACA. Typically, these
riders are minor amendments that
somehow relate to the appropria
tion bill at hand. However, this rider
goes far beyond discretionary
spending and alters the authorizing
legislation. Even Karl Rove warned
Republicans that this strategy was
a mistake.
Now, think back to 2006. Presi
dent Bush's signature healthcare
reform, Medicare Part D, is going
into effect. However, Democrats,
who know it's entirely unfunded
and unethically passed, oppose it.
So, the Democrats filibuster the
nominations of "essential HHS ap
pointees" to stop them "from ad
ministering the law," as NBC's
Chuck Todd put it. They vote
dozens of times to repeal it. They
challenge it in the courts. They
spend millions of dollars to per
suade seniors against it. And after
all of these fail, the House Democ
rats attempt to defund it in an ap

propriations bill.
Sounds a lot like today, right?
Except, it's all complete fiction; De
mocrats did nothing of the sort
when they opposed Bush's reforms.
Republicans' intransigence is
uniquely irresponsible.
The Republicans say they're ne
gotiating. They're not—just listen
to Rand Paul's conversation with
Mitch McConnell. But actions
speak louder than words, so let's
look at the iterations of the House's
amendments. They moved from
completely defunding the ACA, to a
one-year delay in its entirety, to a
delay of the individual mandate and
denial of benefits to Congressional
staffers.
Maybe that seems reasonable.
But, personally, I'll never negotiate
with a gun to my head, whether it's
a 12-gauge shotgun or a smaller
9mm.
Fool me once, shame on you. De
mocrats and moderate Republicans
have sincerely tried to govern.
However, the exploding use of the
filibuster has prevented that, ac
cording to The Century Founda
tion. The New Yorker calculates
that, on average, there are as many
filibusters as there are in-session
days. The House is no better. A bi
partisan immigration reform bill
was "dead on arrival" in the House.
But fool me twice, shame on me.
This time, let's not be fooled.
Michele Bachmann boasted that
House Republicans are outright
happy about the shutdown. Repub
lican Representative Marlin Stutz
man bragged, "We're not going to
be disrespected. We have to get
something out of this. And I don't
know what that even is." Now that
we've received the ransom note,
let's call this what it is: a hostage
crisis.
Speaker Boehner claims that
the Democrats are not negotiating,
despite the compromise Democrats
made with Republicans on spend
ing levels. But more importantly,
funding the government is non-ne
gotiable. Raising the debt ceiling is
non-negotiable. Take care of those
issues. Speaker Boehner: Bring a
clean CR to the floor, regardless of
your ad-hoc Hastert Rule. Then
talk about Obamacare; everyone is
open to ironing out an admittedly
imperfect law, just put the gun
down first.
