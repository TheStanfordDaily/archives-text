# Dems In it to Win It
## 
### Marshall Watkins 
As the partial shutdown of the
federal government looks set
to continue into a second
week, it's easy as you'll see else
where on this page to point fin
gers at a Republican Party seem
ingly consumed by efforts to over
turn President Barack Obama's
signature healthcare reform legis
lation at all costs. Looking back
over the past few years, an intran
sigent and destructive G.O.R is

nothing new. A Democratic Party
that has sunk to the same level in
an effort to "win" the shutdown,
however, is.
The origins of the current shut
down lie in Congress' failure to
pass a continuing resolution that
would extend discretionary spend
ing beyond the previously author
ized period, which ended last Mon
day. That Congress has come to re
ly on continuing resolutions in lieu
of a comprehensive budget
which requires the passage of 12
separate appropriations bills is
n't unusual in and of itself. This
year, however, congressional Re
publicans declined to pass a contin
uing resolution without a rider de
funding the Affordable Care Act,
and Senate Democrats didn't cave.
That kind of narrow-minded ob
stinacy is nothing new for the cur
rent House Republicans, many of
who were elected with the backing
of conservative grassroots in the
2010 midterms. While the Afford
able Care Act popularly known
as "Obamacare" is a flawed
piece of legislation that made its
way into law under questionable
circumstances and benefited from a
similarly dubious ruling by Chief
Justice John Roberts when re
viewed by the Supreme Court,

holding the government hostage
and eventually shutting it down
over a constitutionally valid law for
purely partisan purposes remains
unacceptable.
Of course, for the world outside
Washington, D.C., the shutdown
may as well not be in effect. While
mass government furloughs and
the corresponding emergence of
"shutdown specials" for hungry
and thirsty staffers have had a
visible impact in the nation's capi
tal, as has the closure of national
parks and other tourist attractions
around the country, almost every
thing else the federal government
spends money on has continued to
receive funding. From visa applica
tions and Social Security checks to
military salaries, life will go on as
close to normal as may be expected.
The few spending items that
have suffered child nutrition and
development programs, disaster
management agencies and so on
have been the subject of funding at
tempts by Republicans through the
shutdown. Despite the value that
such programs add, however, De
mocrats have refused to consider
restoring funding not out of any
principled objection to the pro
grams but rather, according to a
senior administration official, be

cause "we are winning."
Putting aside the reality that
public opinion is close to split on
whether Republicans or President
Obama are more to blame for the
shutdown, banking on the blame
from government dysfunction ac
cruing to the other side rather
than proactively engaging with Re
publicans to marginalize any pe
ripheral impact of the shutdown
demonstrates a distinct lack of both
leadership and principle. Yes, it
makes political sense, and yes, such
cold calculation may compare fa
vorably to blind dogmatism, but
such willing indifference does little
credit to a self-proclaimed "adult in
the room."
Thankfully, the costs incurred
by a government shutdown are
largely trivial compared to those
that would ensue from failing to
raise the debt limit. House Repub
licans have consistently shown that
they shouldn't be trusted with man
aging either, given their proclivity
for political stunts over substantive
policymaking. The Obama adminis
tration and Senate Democrats are
dangerously close, regrettably, to
doing the same.

tal, as has the closure of national
parks and other tourist attractions
around the country, almost every
thing else the federal government
spends money on has continued to
receive funding. From visa applica
tions and Social Security checks to
military salaries, life will go on as
close to normal as may be expected.
The few spending items that
have suffered child nutrition and
development programs, disaster
management agencies and so on
have been the subject of funding at
tempts by Republicans through the
shutdown. Despite the value that
such programs add, however, De
mocrats have refused to consider
restoring funding not out of any
principled objection to the pro
grams but rather, according to a
senior administration official, be

cause "we are winning."
Putting aside the reality that
public opinion is close to split on
whether Republicans or President
Obama are more to blame for the
shutdown, banking on the blame
from government dysfunction ac
cruing to the other side rather
than proactively engaging with Re
publicans to marginalize any pe
ripheral impact of the shutdown
demonstrates a distinct lack of both
leadership and principle. Yes, it
makes political sense, and yes, such
cold calculation may compare fa
vorably to blind dogmatism, but
such willing indifference does little
credit to a self-proclaimed "adult in
the room."
Thankfully, the costs incurred
by a government shutdown are
largely trivial compared to those
that would ensue from failing to
raise the debt limit. House Repub
licans have consistently shown that
they shouldn't be trusted with man
aging either, given their proclivity
for political stunts over substantive
policymaking. The Obama adminis
tration and Senate Democrats are
dangerously close, regrettably, to
doing the same.
