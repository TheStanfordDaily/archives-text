# SPORTS BRIEF
## Murphy, Montgomery named Pac-12 players of the week 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
The Pac-12 named Stanford outside linebacker
Trent Murphy and kick returner Ty Montgomery its
defensive and special teams players of the week, re
spectively, on Monday, following the No. 5 Cardinal's
31-28 home victory against then-No. 15 Washington on
Saturday.
Murphy led all players with 2i/2 tackles for loss in
the game, sacking Huskies quarterback Keith Price on
two occasions. The fifth-year senior also tipped a Price
pass in the red zone that led to an interception by sen
ior inside linebacker A. J. Tarpley in the fourth quarter.

Montgomery opened Saturday's game with a 99-
yard kickoff return touchdown, the second of his three
year career at Stanford. The other return touchdown,
coincidentally, came on the very last play of a game,
Stanford's 44-14 win against Washington State in 2011.
The junior finished with 290 all-purpose yards Satur
day night, breaking the career high he set at Army
(255) earlier this year, and added a critical 39-yard
touchdown reception in the waning moments of the
first half.
The conference Player of the Week honors were
Stanford's first this season through five games. The
Cardinal racked up seven such awards in 2012.
