# Stanford Law students' bill signed into Calif, law
## 
### PETER SAMUEL MOON 
Last weekend, California Gover
nor Jerry Brown signed into law
Assembly Bill 551, which was initi
ated by the research of two Stan
ford Law School (SLS) graduates,
Nicholas Reed 'O2 JD 'l2 and Juan
Carlos Cancino 'O2 JD 'OB.
The bill enacts the Urban Agri
culture Incentive Zones Act, which
authorizes small-scale urban farm
ing under the approval of state
counties.

According to Reed, he and Can
cino developed a friendship during
their undergraduate years at Stan
ford starting when they were fresh
man year roommates.
Under the guidance of Richard
Ford 'BB, a law school professor who
specializes in local government and
law, Reed said he was inspired to be
gin an independent research project
on urban agriculture a topic he is
passionate about. Cancino, who
graduated four years before Reed,
assisted him as the Alumni Mentor

in-Residence at Stanford Law
School.
"I realized that there was a prob
lem to solve, and at SLS we identi
fied the problems around us and
sought to resolve them," Reed said.
After two years of research,
Reed finished his independent proj
ect on urban agriculture in Palo Al
to during his third year at SLS and
published his work in the Stanford
Law and Policy Review. However,
with the guidance of Ford and the
help of Cancino, he expanded his

project into AB 551.
The bill developed gradually
from Reed and Cancino's involve
ment with the San Francisco Green
house Project, a nonprofit organiza
tion that advocates for urban agri
cultural development and planning.
The duo was also part of the San
Francisco Urban Agriculture Al
liance, an organization that sup
ports small-scale farming in cities.
Reed said they shared their find
ings from the initial research proj
ect with the residents of Palo Alto

and were soon invited by the state
assembly in Sacramento to testify
on the matter with both the assem
bly and the state senate. After re
ceiving positive responses from
both legislative bodies, the two
Stanford alums partook in the actu
al crafting of the bill.
Reed and Cancino said stu
dents should keep in mind the pos
itive outcomes their research may
lead to.
"We often feel like the work
we're doing in academia will never
see the light of day," Reed said. "I
think that students should bear in
mind that they have an impact. They
should approach problems with a
positive mentality."
Cancino expressed similar senti
ments, specifically for SLS students.
"Don't look at your time at law
school as time away from the
world," he said. "Try to seize the
opportunity to try to change the lo
cal places [and your environment]

for the better."
However, Reed said the bill's
passage did not finalize its effects.
"The law has passed, but coun
ties in California still need to opt
in,"' he said. "We hope that Stan
ford students and the residents of
Palo Alto help obtain local support
from their counties to see true light
in the bill."
Reed is now a co-founder of
Ravel Law, a start-up created to
make legal research easier for
lawyers. Cancino is currently a
lawyer for a nonprofit legal organ
ization, the California Rural Legal
Assistance.
