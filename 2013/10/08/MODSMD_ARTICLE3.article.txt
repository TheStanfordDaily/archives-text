## Your Art Here program gets revitalized 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC 
Coordinators for the Your Art Here pro
gram an initiative to showcase student art
and allow students to curate art spaces
around campus are addressing personnel
concerns this year in an effort to revitalize the
project.
Through the program, originally launched
in Fall 2010, student artists have the chance to
share their work with the Stanford communi
ty in six student art spaces, ranging from the
walls of eateries like Cool Cafe at the Cantor
Arts Center, the CoHo and Lakeside Dining
to traditional galleries at Wallenberg Hall, Old
Union and the newly added gallery at the
Hume Center for Writing and Speaking.
Paula Salazar 'l3, the Arts in Student Life
Coordinator for the Stanford Arts Institute
who is overseeing the program's rejuvenation,
said there was a drop off in participation to
wards the end of last year due to excessive
hours demanded of students as the program
grew in popularity.
"The time commitment became very inten
sive for students," Salazar said, "but we rec
ognized that and that's why we are re-launch
ing it to see what would work best with stu
dents' lifestyle and schedule and needs."
This year, the program is dividing gallery
management from a single curator position to

a close-knit team consisting of two curators,
an exhibitions manager and a publicity agent
for each location.
Your Art Here's six gallery locations ac
cept submissions from any Stanford student,
regardless of whether they are involved in an
arts class on campus. Student curators, who
are trained in museum management tasks
through the program, then select pieces to de
velop and publicize exhibitions.
Shanae Davis 'l4 was attracted to the pro
gram last year after she had studied abroad in
Oxford during her sophomore year, where she

worked at the Pitt Rivers Museum at the Uni
versity of Oxford.
"I found that just because you have art and
you put it somewhere, that doesn't make it an
exhibition space," Davis said.
She added that the Your Art Here program
gave her a chance to work directly with artists
and express their vision through her displays,
while also giving her practical experience in co
ordinating with dozens of people and drafting
schedules for the various phases of exhibitions.

Old Union houses one of Your Art Here's six galleries across campus where students can
contribute art pieces to exhibit or curate the displays themselves through the program.
