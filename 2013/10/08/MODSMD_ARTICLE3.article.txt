## Your Art Here program gets revitalized 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC 
Coordinators for the Your Art Here pro
gram an initiative to showcase student art
and allow students to curate art spaces
around campus are addressing personnel
concerns this year in an effort to revitalize the
project.
Through the program, originally launched
in Fall 2010, student artists have the chance to
share their work with the Stanford communi
ty in six student art spaces, ranging from the
walls of eateries like Cool Cafe at the Cantor
Arts Center, the CoHo and Lakeside Dining
to traditional galleries at Wallenberg Hall, Old
Union and the newly added gallery at the
Hume Center for Writing and Speaking.
Paula Salazar 'l3, the Arts in Student Life
Coordinator for the Stanford Arts Institute
who is overseeing the program's rejuvenation,
said there was a drop off in participation to
wards the end of last year due to excessive
hours demanded of students as the program
grew in popularity.
"The time commitment became very inten
sive for students," Salazar said, "but we rec
ognized that and that's why we are re-launch
ing it to see what would work best with stu
dents' lifestyle and schedule and needs."
This year, the program is dividing gallery
management from a single curator position to

a close-knit team consisting of two curators,
an exhibitions manager and a publicity agent
for each location.
Your Art Here's six gallery locations ac
cept submissions from any Stanford student,
regardless of whether they are involved in an
arts class on campus. Student curators, who
are trained in museum management tasks
through the program, then select pieces to de
velop and publicize exhibitions.
Shanae Davis 'l4 was attracted to the pro
gram last year after she had studied abroad in
Oxford during her sophomore year, where she

worked at the Pitt Rivers Museum at the Uni
versity of Oxford.
"I found that just because you have art and
you put it somewhere, that doesn't make it an
exhibition space," Davis said.
She added that the Your Art Here program
gave her a chance to work directly with artists
and express their vision through her displays,
while also giving her practical experience in co
ordinating with dozens of people and drafting
schedules for the various phases of exhibitions.

Old Union houses one of Your Art Here's six galleries across campus where students can
contribute art pieces to exhibit or curate the displays themselves through the program.
Davis hopes to either pursue
further education in museum
studies or work in public relations
for a museum.
"My dream job after 10 or 20
years of experience would be to be
one of the first black, female mu
seum directors," Davis said.
Though the hands-on experi
ence with the galleries is given to
those involved with curatorial
roles, the program expands access
to the arts for all students, in line
with the campus-wide effort to in
crease and improve the Universi
ty's art programs and facilities,
Salazar said.
"Just going to class and seeing
something on your way is really
important to demystifying the art
world and integrating it holistical
ly into your daily Stanford life,"
Salazar said.

Tess Dufrechou 'l6, who exhib
ited her art in the program last
year, said hearing fellow students,
most of whom were not artists, ac
knowledge her art was exciting.
In the coming years, Dufre
chou hopes that these galleries
will expand to play a larger role in
uniting the arts community. She
said she sees displaying art pub
licly as a chance for artists and
non-artists to see what other stu
dents are doing, offering an cam
pus unity vital to Stanford's col
laborative culture.
"I think we can really work on
getting artists to talk to each oth
er more," Dufrechou said. "It
would be nice to talk to people who
have design skills or something
different than my skills and see
how they're doing their art."
Salazar said the program appli
cations for serving on the Your Art
Here committee are still being ac
cepted.
