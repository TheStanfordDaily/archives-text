## Stanford endowment rose to $18.7 billion in 2013 
### MICHAEL TUSCHMAN 
The University saw a 9.7-per
cent increase in its endowment this
year, bringing the total value to
$18.7 billion after the 2013 fiscal
year.
The endowment total has
steadily increased since 2009,
marking a recovery from the 2008
financial crisis that hit major na
tional investments including uni
versity endowments.
According to Randy Liv
ingston, Stanford's vice president
for business affairs and chief fi
nancial officer, the increase in
this year's total was due to a
combination of returns on en
dowment investments managed
by the Stanford Management
Company, new gifts, internal
transfers of expendable funds and
payout from the endowment to
support current operations.
The University has not yet re
leased specific information about
the new gifts to the endowment and
transfers for the 2013 fiscal year.
Despite the growth, Livingston
said he does not predict any reallo

cation of University funding.
"The investment returns and
growth of endowment were very
consistent with our long-term
forecasting model, so this year's
results will not change the Univer
sity's budget or spending pat
terns," Livingston said.
The endowment payout funds
most of the University's pro
grams, including financial aid.
Karen Cooper, director of financial
aid, said around $1 billion is re
served for financial aid each year.
While Cooper also noted that
the changes in the endowment will
not have a direct impact on the
amount of financial aid available to
students annually, she predicts
there will be a growing availability
of financial aid to international
students in the future.
"As funds that we have avail
able for international students
specifically grow, we can continue
to admit more international stu
dents with financial aid packages,"
Cooper said. "We have already
made significant improvements
just in the class this fall."
Indeed, 45 international stu

dents in the class of 2017 are re
ceiving financial aid, almost dou
ble the number of those in the
class of 2016.
Stanford was among the first
of its peer institutions to release
endowment figures in 2013. Dur
ing the previous fiscal year, Stan

ford's endowment was the fourth
largest in the nation, with Har
vard, Yale and the University of
Texas having the three largest uni
versity endowments.
