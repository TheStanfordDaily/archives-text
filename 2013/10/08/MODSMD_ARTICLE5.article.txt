## Applicants, college students connect on Chalky 
### IRENE HSU 
College applicants and current
students can now connect with one
another through Chalky, a new
start-up that coordinates mentor
ships for guidance and support be
fore, during and after college.
Founded by Isaac Madan 'l5
and Charlie Yang 'l5 this past
June, Chalky has since expanded
to hundreds of colleges, including
selective schools Harvard, Yale,

Princeton, among others that
are in high demand by the thou
sands of users on the site.
"We want to improve the expe
rience at Stanford and then repli
cate that at other schools, like
growing in one ecosystem and
then expanding to others," Madan
said.
Chalky's purpose is to offer
one-on-one mentorship by match
ing users to one another after they
fill out an online profile. One of its

main uses is to guide students
through the college application
process.
"The best personal advice is
what you get from passionate peo
ple who have been in our shoes,"
Madan said. This feeds into
Chalky's ultimate goal to "un
lock life's collective experiences,"
according to Madan.
Over the summer, Chalky am
bassadors Negin Behzadian 'l7
and Dennis Xu 'l7, also organized

live talks about applications and
scholarships as another method of
reaching out to college applicants,
especially high school students,
who make up the site's biggest au
dience.
"It is one of the biggest mo
ments in life, when people are
making crucial, independent deci
sions," Madan said about the ap
plication process. "We recognized
that there was an inefficiency in the
process â€”we spend so much time
and money to try to get into college
and, after learning all these great
things in the process, the informa
tion goes unused."
Beyond answering basic ques
tions about college, Chalky serves as
a platform for people to build rela
tionships with those who have been
in their shoes. For instance, Xu's re
cent experience with college applica
tions motivated him to join the
Chalky team as a mentor.
"There was this abstract defini
tion of the 'passion' everyone was
talking about," Xu said. "My first
three years of high school, I spent all
my time trying to pursue a defini
tion of passion and what it meant to
be passionate."
Chalky boasts features such as
messaging, blogs and an advice page
to create more personal relation
ships between users,
Currently in close contact with
his 20 high school mentees, Xu em
phasized Chalky's personal environ
ment, which doesn't focus as much
on numbers and statistics as other
forum sites such as College Confi
dential.
"Experiences are so much more
important than the objective score,"
Xu said. "It's not about the data, it's
about the person."
Similarly, Behzadian feels that
the mentorship established through
Chalky is much more personal.

"Even though I'm just helping
them on the college app context,
there's so much more in front of
them and in front of me, to share ex
periences and learn how far we've
come," she said. "We're not just us
ing each other to get help but build
ing a healthy relationship."
Madan said that with funding
from Innovation Works (founded by
former Google China President Kai-
F\i Lee) and The Brandery, the co
founders are currently working to
enhance user experience by improv
ing the algorithm that matches
mentees with mentors.
After December deadlines for
college applications, Madan hopes to
shift the company's focus and ex
pand its reach to connect college
alumni and students from all over
the world.
'As people grow, Chalky grows
with them," Madan said. "We began
with the college application process,
but we also want to scale to other
transitions in life."
