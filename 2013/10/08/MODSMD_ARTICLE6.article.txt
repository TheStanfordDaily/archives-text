# STUDENT LIFE
## GSEE seeks to unite grad community Suicide prompts grad student to improve social experience 
### PINNAREE TEA-MANGKORNPAN 
In 2008, a final year Ph.D. student in
the electrical engineering department
committed suicide.
Motivated by the loss of her friend
and feeling a gap in the support given to
graduate students in the department,
Chinyere Ife?ma Nwabugwu M.S. 'lO
Ph.D.'l6 established the Graduate Stu
dents in Electrical Engineering
(GSEE) in May 2011 along with six oth
er founding members to foster commu
nity among students, faculty and ad
ministration.
"[We wanted to] create a student
support network to help students navi
gate the electrical engineering gradu
ate program and primarily focus on stu
dents helping students," said Nwabug
wu. "I think we can [be] helping each
other to be successful together."
Stanford University's graduate stu
dent community outnumbers its under
graduate population, with nearly 9,000
students in 90 departments and pro
grams across seven schools. The elec
trical engineering department has the
largest graduate student population
895 students in 2012 accounting for
10 percent of total graduate enrollment,
according to Patricia Gumport, vice
provost for graduate education.
Despite them predominant presence
on campus, graduate students and ad
ministrators say there are more diffi
culties for these students than under
graduates when it comes to connecting
with the Stanford community, citing
factors such as arriving at Stanford at
different times and starting their grad
uate careers at different stages of life.
Nwabugwu and her peers in the
electrical engineering department have
taken action to fill in the community
gaps.

HappEE graduates
GSEE started organizing events
long before it officially became a stu
dent organization in January 2012.
Its first event was the HappEE
hour in September 2011, which has now
expanded to become a biweekly event
offered throughout the year.
In order to increase faculty partici
pation, the group launched GSEE Af
ternoon Tea on Wednesdays and stu
dent-faculty lunches, which offer stu
dents a chance to meet faculty in a more
intimate setting, Nwabugwu said.
