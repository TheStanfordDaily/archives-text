## GSEE seeks to unite grad community Suicide prompts grad student to improve social experience 
### PINNAREE TEA-MANGKORNPAN 
In 2008, a final year Ph.D. student in
the electrical engineering department
committed suicide.
Motivated by the loss of her friend
and feeling a gap in the support given to
graduate students in the department,
Chinyere Ife?ma Nwabugwu M.S. 'lO
Ph.D.'l6 established the Graduate Stu
dents in Electrical Engineering
(GSEE) in May 2011 along with six oth
er founding members to foster commu
nity among students, faculty and ad
ministration.
"[We wanted to] create a student
support network to help students navi
gate the electrical engineering gradu
ate program and primarily focus on stu
dents helping students," said Nwabug
wu. "I think we can [be] helping each
other to be successful together."
Stanford University's graduate stu
dent community outnumbers its under
graduate population, with nearly 9,000
students in 90 departments and pro
grams across seven schools. The elec
trical engineering department has the
largest graduate student population
895 students in 2012 accounting for
10 percent of total graduate enrollment,
according to Patricia Gumport, vice
provost for graduate education.
Despite them predominant presence
on campus, graduate students and ad
ministrators say there are more diffi
culties for these students than under
graduates when it comes to connecting
with the Stanford community, citing
factors such as arriving at Stanford at
different times and starting their grad
uate careers at different stages of life.
Nwabugwu and her peers in the
electrical engineering department have
taken action to fill in the community
gaps.

HappEE graduates
GSEE started organizing events
long before it officially became a stu
dent organization in January 2012.
Its first event was the HappEE
hour in September 2011, which has now
expanded to become a biweekly event
offered throughout the year.
In order to increase faculty partici
pation, the group launched GSEE Af
ternoon Tea on Wednesdays and stu
dent-faculty lunches, which offer stu
dents a chance to meet faculty in a more
intimate setting, Nwabugwu said.
Faculty, staff and administrators,
along with 200 students, also attend
ed the GSEE sponsored EE Prom,
which was held on the last day of the
electrical engineering qualifying ex
aminations last year.
"My wife and I went last year
it was great," said Brad Osgood,
GSEE's faculty advisor and senior
associate dean for student affairs in
the School of Engineering.
Other events that GSEE holds
include mixers with other graduate
programs, a pumpkin carving con
test, movie nights and DiscoverEE,
an event for prospective students to
help the department with recruit
ing admits. This quarter the group
created its first intramurals team
with more than 80 participants.
"We want to send a message to
other departments ... [that] they
can build both a support network
for the graduate students in their
departments and for the students
[outside of their departments],"
Nwabugwu said. "It is very near to
my heart to be able to do this to
be able to pursue excellence while
fostering community."
While GSEE encourages bond
ing on the departmental level, the
Graduate Student Council (GSC) fo
cuses on interdepartmental bonding.
"We're trying to do one [gradu
ate student event] at least every
quarter," said Trevor Martin 'O3
MBA 'll, co-chair of the GSC.
The graduate student Welcome
Back Party and Grad Formal are
examples of the GSC's community

events. The council also funds stu
dent groups that graduate students
are involved in, as long their events
are open for everyone.

Administrative action
University administration plays
its own part to ensure community
bonding among graduate students,
especially after the Student Mental
Health and Well-Being Task Force
published a report in 2008 about the
campus climate on mental health is
sues based on research conducted
from Fall 2006 through Winter
2008.
"At Stanford, some graduate
students spoke movingly of the
stress of isolation and about the
need for friends," the report stated.
"They are concerned about not hav
ing friends and not being able to
make them."
"[According to the 2008 report,]
students don't feel connected to
campus at large or between each
other," said Ken Hsu, director of the
Graduate Life Office.
Hsu named two challenges:
First, that graduate students are
very diverse and arrive at Stanford
at different times, and therefore
lack the mutual starting experience
that undergraduates have; and sec
ond, that the graduate student's life
is mostly a "worn-out path" from
home and the department.
"Graduate students commute di
rectly from home to then* depart
ment," Hsu said. "That's why you
don't see many graduates on cam
pus. The [graduate student's]
lifestyle does not lend itself to meet
ing other people from other focus of
different programs."
As a consequence of the 2008 re

port, the Graduate Life Office
launched three main projects: im
provement of the Community Asso
ciates program (equivalent to the
undergraduate Residential Assis
tants program), New Graduate Stu
dent Orientation (NGSO) and the
Graduate Student Programming
Board (GSPB) which holds events
that all students can participate,
connecting off-campus students to
the Stanford community.
From the academic perspective,
Gumport said the office of the Vice
Provost for Graduate Education
(VPGE) makes the effort to build
programs for professional develop

ment, interdisciplinary learning, di
versity and innovation. One of these
includes Student Projects for Intel
lectual Community Enhancement
(SPICE), which fosters communi
ties for multi-disciplinary conversa
tions and also provides funding for
innovative activities that expand de
partmental intellectual communi
ties.
"Interdisciplinary is a Stanford
identity," Gumport said. "Students
make academic success when they
feel a sense of belonging. [The Uni
versity] finds ways to build commu
nity and encourage [bonding] within
departments."

As graduate students continue to
seek belonging within the Stanford
community through student groups
like GSEE, Hsu offers a general
three-rule piece of advice to those
trying to fill in a bonding gap.
"Get yourself informed about
your life here, whether it is a health
plan, support or resources; get in
volved in activities that you like, ac
tivities outside [your] department;
and finally, please get help," Hsu
said. "Everything we do is to ensure
these three things for our students."

Last year, the Graduate Students in Electrical Engineering sponsored an EE Prom with 200 students attending.
The event demonstrates the group's drive to promote a sense of community within the department.
