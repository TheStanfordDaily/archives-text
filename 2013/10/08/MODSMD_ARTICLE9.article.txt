## THE 						FARM TO THE NFL SAN DIEGO CHARGERS ACTIVATE THOMAS KEISER 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
There may be no better feeling for an NFL
player than having the long hours and the hard
work he spent refining his game pay off in the
form of Sunday playing time. For outside line
backer Thomas Keiser 'll, this feeling again be
came a reality last week when the San Diego
Chargers activated him off of their practice
squad.
"I was ecstatic," Keiser said about his reac
tion to being activated. "Sitting on practice
squad was frustrating because you participate
in practice all week but you don't get to do the
best part, which is going out there and compet
ing on game day. Once I was activated, I knew I
was going to be seeing the field and that's
what I play for."
Keiser spent his first two seasons with the
Carolina Panthers, collecting 17 tackles, 4i/2
sacks and an interception. In May, he was
waived from the Panthers, but he quickly found
a home with the Chargers this summer, earning
a spot on the practice squad and now on the 53-
man roster.
"The most difficult aspect [of my career] has
been earning the opportunity to play on Sun
day," Keiser elaborated. "Coming into the
league as an undrafted free agent, your battle to
make it is a lot more difficult. You have to make
seven times the plays of drafted guys, you have
to do things perfect all the time and be on top of
your stuff so that the coaches and management
trust you to go out there on Sunday and do what
you're expected to do."
Keiser believes that he has been looked at
differently as a player because of the way he en
tered the NFL as an undrafted free agent in
2011.
"The mentality is that there must be some is
sue or detractor against the athlete because he
was undrafted," Keiser added. "That's some
thing that, for your first two, three, four years,
makes you have to play to prove that you belong
in this league."
As a Stanford grad in the NFL, Keiser expe
rienced firsthand the stereotypes and develop
ing views on players who come into the NFL
from Stanford. Over the past few years, the
NFL has received an influx of extremely talent
ed Stanford football players who are helping to
negate what were once poor opinions of Stan
ford players. Now, Stanford's standing in the
NFL is higher than ever before.
"You have a lot of respect from your team
mates and coaches because you got an education

from an elite school," Keiser said. "At the same
time, one of the biggest concerns people have
about Stanford NFL football players is that
their mind isn't completely into the game
that they have other interests and that football
isn't them life.
"You do need to prove your passion for the
game more than the average person," he added.
"Personally, I kind of laugh at that issue.... Stan
ford wasn't a school where football players were

treated like gods like most of the other BCS pro
grams. We really play for the love of the game
we were out there for each other and because
we love football."
After playing with Panthers quarterback
Cam Newton and now with Chargers quarter
back Philip Rivers, Keiser still had high praise
for his former Stanford quarterback Andrew

Linebacker Thomas Keiser '11 (above) played in his first game for the San Diego Chargers on
Sunday. Now in his third NFL season, Keiser began the year on the Chargers' practice squad.
Luck 'l2. Keiser played with
Luck for three years and saw
the benefits he brought to
the football team.
"Andrew was phenome
nal," Keiser said. "Along with
all the physical attributes, he
always had the intangibles
you look for in a quarterback
with leadership, poise under
pressure and an understand
ing of the game in away very
few people do. I think he's
going to do awesome in the
league."
The San Diego Chargers
fell 27-17 to the Oakland
Raiders Sunday night in
Reiser's first game with the
team. Keiser recorded one
tackle in the game.

At this point, would we re
ally expect anything differ
ent from Andrew Luck?
Luck led the Colts on a
game-winning drive in the
fourth quarter the ninth
such drive in his young ca-

reer —as they upset the
previously unbeaten Sea
hawks 34-28. Luck finished
16-for-29 with 229 yards and
two touchdowns in the win.

"A win is a win, if it was
ugly, if it was great," Luck
told ESPN. "To come back,
you hold on for dear life, but
a chance to beat a good team
in front of our home fans, to
get back on track at home,
we take a lot of pride in that."

Luck was even unafraid
to throw at Richard Sher
man 'lO, who was covering
top Colts receiver Reggie
Wayne, as Wayne caught five
passes for 65 yards on the
day. The other former Cardi
nal player on the Seahawks
squad, Doug Baldwin 'll,
continued to have an excel
lent season and recorded five
catches for 80 yards on the
day.
The Colts improved to 4-1
on the season and have now
beaten two of the top teams
in the league, the 49ers and
the Seahawks.
In others news around
the NFL, Falcons tight end
Levine Toilolo 'l3 caught a
touchdown pass from Matt
Ryan with just under two
minutes left on Monday
Night Football to give At
lanta the lead over the Jets,
28-27. The touchdown was
the second in Toilolo's career
The Jets, however, would ral
ly on a late drive and kick a
game-winning field goal with
time expiring to win 30-28.

in this league."
As a Stanford grad in the NFL, Keiser expe
rienced firsthand the stereotypes and develop
ing views on players who come into the NFL
from Stanford. Over the past few years, the
NFL has received an influx of extremely talent
ed Stanford football players who are helping to
negate what were once poor opinions of Stan
ford players. Now, Stanford's standing in the
NFL is higher than ever before.
"You have a lot of respect from your team
mates and coaches because you got an education

from an elite school," Keiser said. "At the same
time, one of the biggest concerns people have
about Stanford NFL football players is that
their mind isn't completely into the game
that they have other interests and that football
isn't them life.
"You do need to prove your passion for the
game more than the average person," he added.
"Personally, I kind of laugh at that issue.... Stan
ford wasn't a school where football players were

treated like gods like most of the other BCS pro
grams. We really play for the love of the game
we were out there for each other and because
we love football."

Linebacker Thomas Keiser '11 (above) played in his first game for the San Diego Chargers on
Sunday. Now in his third NFL season, Keiser began the year on the Chargers' practice squad.
Luck 'l2. Keiser played with
Luck for three years and saw
the benefits he brought to
the football team.
"Andrew was phenome
nal," Keiser said. "Along with
all the physical attributes, he
always had the intangibles
you look for in a quarterback
with leadership, poise under
pressure and an understand
ing of the game in away very
few people do. I think he's
going to do awesome in the
league."
The San Diego Chargers
fell 27-17 to the Oakland
Raiders Sunday night in
Reiser's first game with the
team. Keiser recorded one
tackle in the game.

At this point, would we re
ally expect anything differ
ent from Andrew Luck?
Luck led the Colts on a
game-winning drive in the
fourth quarter the ninth
such drive in his young ca-

reer —as they upset the
previously unbeaten Sea
hawks 34-28. Luck finished
16-for-29 with 229 yards and
two touchdowns in the win.

"A win is a win, if it was
ugly, if it was great," Luck
told ESPN. "To come back,
you hold on for dear life, but
a chance to beat a good team
in front of our home fans, to
get back on track at home,
we take a lot of pride in that."

Luck was even unafraid
to throw at Richard Sher
man 'lO, who was covering
top Colts receiver Reggie
Wayne, as Wayne caught five
passes for 65 yards on the
day. The other former Cardi
nal player on the Seahawks
squad, Doug Baldwin 'll,
continued to have an excel
lent season and recorded five
catches for 80 yards on the
day.
The Colts improved to 4-1
on the season and have now
beaten two of the top teams
in the league, the 49ers and
the Seahawks.

the NFL, Falcons tight end
Levine Toilolo 'l3 caught a
touchdown pass from Matt
Ryan with just under two
minutes left on Monday
Night Football to give At

28-27. The touchdown was
the second in Toilolo's career
The Jets, however, would ral

There may be no better feeling for an NFL
player than having the long hours and the hard
work he spent refining his game pay off in the
form of Sunday playing time. For outside line
backer Thomas Keiser 'll, this feeling again be
came a reality last week when the San Diego
Chargers activated him off of their practice
squad.
"I was ecstatic," Keiser said about his reac
tion to being activated. "Sitting on practice
squad was frustrating because you participate
in practice all week but you don't get to do the
best part, which is going out there and compet
ing on game day. Once I was activated, I knew I
was going to be seeing the field and that's
what I play for."
Keiser spent his first two seasons with the
Carolina Panthers, collecting 17 tackles, 4i/2
sacks and an interception. In May, he was
waived from the Panthers, but he quickly found
a home with the Chargers this summer, earning
a spot on the practice squad and now on the 53-
man roster.
"The most difficult aspect [of my career] has
been earning the opportunity to play on Sun
day," Keiser elaborated. "Coming into the
league as an undrafted free agent, your battle to
make it is a lot more difficult. You have to make
seven times the plays of drafted guys, you have
to do things perfect all the time and be on top of
your stuff so that the coaches and management
trust you to go out there on Sunday and do what
you're expected to do."
Keiser believes that he has been looked at
differently as a player because of the way he en
tered the NFL as an undrafted free agent in
2011.
"The mentality is that there must be some is
sue or detractor against the athlete because he
was undrafted," Keiser added. "That's some
thing that, for your first two, three, four years,
makes you have to play to prove that you belong
in this league."
