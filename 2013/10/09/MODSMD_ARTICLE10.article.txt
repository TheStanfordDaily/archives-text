## Tennis lives in the age of the "Big Four" 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
The headlines on ESPN
were momentous. In his
first full year back from
chronic left knee problems
and on the strength of a
stellar year of play and reaching the fi
nals of the China Open, Rafael Nadal
had reclaimed the No. 1 ranking in
men's tennis from the clutches of No
vak Djokovic, who had held the ranking
in his stead.
Quite naturally Nadal's opponent in
the China Open final was (you guessed
it) Djokovic, who clobbered a stunned
Nadal 6-3,6-4. You can't make this kind
of stuff up.
A quick consultation of the ATP
rankings reveals a number of startling
facts. Firstly Roger Federer, holder of
the most Grand Slam titles in history is
ranked a measly seventh behind indi
viduals such as David Ferrer, Juan
Martin Del Potro and Tomas Berdych.
To a guy who grew up watching Fed
erer play almost unbeatable tennis
from 10 B.N. (before Nadal) to about 2
AN. (after Nadal), this is a shocking
turn of events.
The romantic in me weeps at Feder
er's decline; however, the "aged" Fed
erer is still almost a shoo-in to reach the
semis at every tournament he plays
in, which would be the best case for
most tennis players. The fact that we
think that this is somehow a disgrace
speaks to the impossibly high stan
dards Federer has set for himself
more than his purported decline.
The other scary fact is this: Of the
top 100, only five players hold Grand
Slam titles at all: Nadal (No. 1),
Djokovic (No. 2), Murray (No. 3), Del
Potro (No. 5), and Federer (No. 7),
with Del Potro only having a single
U.S. Open title to his name. In fact,
Del Potro is the only player other
than the Big Four (Nadal, Djokovic,
Murray, Federer) to have won a
men's grand slam singles title after
2005. That's utterly terrifying. To put
it another way, of the last 35 majors,
34 have gone to the Big Four (cut to
the rest of the ATP top 100 sobbing
quietly into their towels).
As a result of the sheer domi
nance by these four players, the
number of truly outstanding tennis
matches between them over the last
few years cannot be counted with
two or even four pairs of hands. Take
your mind back through the depths
of time and the amazing tennis mo
ments contained therein; I will bet
you dollars to donuts that the great
tennis moments featured (with more
than 90 percent confidence) one of
the Big Four in some capacity. In
fact, I'm even willing to bet that
many of the greatest moments fea
tured two members of the Big Four
butting heads in a no-holds-barred
cage match. (I will pause for a mo
ment to let readers wipe the drool off
then* mouths.)
The simple law of tennis is this:
When you pit two outstanding play
ers against one another, fireworks
may be produced. The Big Four
corollary to this statement is the fol
lowing: When you match members
of the Big Four against each other,
fireworks will be produced, without
fail.
In general, when members of the
Big Four play anyone outside of
their elite clique, the results are
bloody but predictable: They never
seem to lose. Excepting Federer's
recent decline in form, any one of
the Big Four losing to anyone out
side the Big Four is cause for the
universe (or Twitterverse, which is
what we are slowly becoming these
days) to explode.
However, when members of the
Big Four play each other, chaos en
sues. For a time, it seemed like Fed
erer owned Nadal, to the point that
Nadal would always come ever so
close to beating his arch-nemesis
before eventually faltering. Then
Nadal proceeded to own Federer,
turning the previous situation on its
head. All of a sudden, Djokovic
showed up to the scene and began
his reign of terror, appearing to to
tally and utterly own both Nadal
and Federer.
As if this chaos wasn't enough,
Murray emerged from under the

weight of the expectations of his en
tire country to win both Olympic
gold and the first Wimbledon title
by a British citizen in 77 years, tak
ing down Djokovic's aura of impen
etrability in the process. On any
given day, it seems any of the four
can and will beat another a far
cry from Federer slaughtering his
opponents for a period of nearly 10
years. Parity is the watchword in
side the Big Four enclave. Outside
this zone, times are pretty tough.
Thus, as this calendar year draws

to a close, although the rankings have
shuffled a bit, the picture that tennis
paints remains as clear as mud. To
borrow a famous catehphrase, the
haves and the have-nots have clearly
drawn lines in the sand. Let the bat
tle commence.

Vignesh Venkataraman once re
trieved a towel used by Roger Federer
during a match. Ten years later, he
still sleeps with it under his pillow.
Tell him, why that's more than a little
weird at viggy@stanford.edu.
