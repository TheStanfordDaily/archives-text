# SENIOR SIT DOWN
## RACHEL WILLIAMS 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
In the first 2013-11 edition of the Senior
Sit Down, The Daily's Sam Fisher chatted
with women's volleyball senior outside hit
ter Rachel Williams. The following is a con
densed version of their conversation. For

Sam Fisher (SF): Now that we're in week three
of senior year, academically it seems like week
50 in terms of the sports season, I'm sure how
are you feeling? Does it feel real at all that this is
your last run?

Rachel Williams (RW): In week three, teachers
are starting to talk about midterms, so it's kind of
[hard], especially with us being on the road for
most of last week. We were gone Thesday to Sat
urday, so that's a lot of class missed and catching
up on that for midterms. It feels pretty normal.
The beginning of preseason, it was like, "Oh my
gosh. It's my senior preseason. This is our last
chance. This is our last time to do this and our last
trip here and our last trip there."
It's still a little bit [emotional] when we go on
the road and it's like my last time in the Galen
Center or Pauley Pavilion, or things like that. And
there's definitely a greater appreciation for play
ing in Maples, because there's only so many
matches left. But now that school's started, it's a
lot more in the grind, just focused on getting to
class, getting to practice on time, taking care of
the body. So not as much focus on every day being
one less day until graduation.
I know that seniors don't really like to talk
about graduation. We like to pretend that we're
staying here forever because this place is so amaz
ing. It's lots of hard work, lots of focus. In and out,
I'll notice things that it's like, "Yeah, this is it," but
it's not too overwhelming.

SF: You mentioned the weird travel schedule last
week. As a senior, you have a unique perspective.
In years one and two, [there was] very little tele
vision coverage. In years three and four, a lot of
television means very different types of trips like
that. What's that transition been like, getting used
to having to leave on a Tuesday rather than a
Thursday and figuring out how to balance school
and life?

RW: It's not as difficult as I would have assumed
it would be. It might be a little harder for the
freshmen, because they're adjusting to every
thing and having to miss that much class.... Defi
nitely I would say that it's asking a little bit more

of us as student-athletes to be on top of our work,
but nothing that we can't handle.
SF: Can you talk about what you're taking this fall
and what you have left before you graduate?
RW: I'm taking Earth Systems 10, to fulfill my
Natural Science GER.
SF: I still need to do that.

RW: I was going to take sports med and it got can
celled. I was so disappointed. That was with [Dan]
Garza he's a doctor on the 49ers. I heard that
was a great class so I was excited to take it. So I'm
taking this to fulfill the GER, I'm taking Soc 200,
which is a seminar for my major because I'm ma
joring in sociology. And that is basically a 25-page
research paper and I am going to focus on

whether there is greater racial diversity on athlet
ic varsity teams that have more scholarships than
the ones that have like three and have to divide
them up among the team. So I'm looking forward
to doing that project. And then my last class is
PoliSci 114 D, which is "Democracy, Development
and the Rule of Law" for my minor. And I will be
done with all of my major and minor requirements
after this quarter, so winter and spring is a lot
more play time. My dad's telling me that I need to
find classes that will get me a job. He's trying to
get me to take accounting and finance and econ,
which don't look as much fun as the other options.
Mel (Mary Ellen Luck), another senior on the
team (my roommate), wants to take sailing in
spring and tennis in winter, so I might join her.


IAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
Senior outside hitter Rachel Williams (right) is enjoying her final season on Stanford's women's
volleyball team as she finishes up her major and a productive four-year career with the Card.
SF: It can help you get a job as a
sailor or tennis instructor.
RW: Exactly. I tried to tell [my dad]
that all of my major and minor re
quirements were like the job part.
I'm looking forward to having some
fun classes. I'm trying to figure out
what to do because I can take any
thing that I want. It's kind of
strange. And then not being in off
season with the team will be weird;
kind of being a regular student and
not a student-athlete any more will
kind of by weird, for two quarters.

SF: That's always been something
that I've asked about. Being in a fall
sport means having no summer for
pretty much all of your time at Stan
ford, but you also get that experience
for six months of being a normal
Stanford student. Do you think
about that at all? Have there been
things you are looking forward to
about that, anything you want to
knock off your bucket list or are you
going to wait until after the season to
think about those things?

RW: We don't have a whole lot of
specifics, but Mel and I do a lot to
gether, obviously; I've mentioned her
like three times now. We do have a

bucket list and we are planning on
doing a lot of things that we couldn't
do when we were athletes. So more
trips to the city probably on week
ends and we're working on being
more spontaneous because this is our
last go-around. But we do like our
schedule and we're excited that we
get the two quarters off compared to
some of the other sports that do go
all the way through. Because we do
get eight weeks of summer, even
though we're training, but it's still
nice; we get to see the sun. I think
we're going to go camping. We decid
ed that winter break we are going to
plan out a full bucket list of every
thing we want to get done in the six
months before we graduate.

SF: Do you have any plans for volley
ball after this fall season ends or are
you thinking of hanging them up?

RW: I'm going to try to play over
seas, get an agent and go see what
professional volleyball is like in Eu
rope. Hopefully Italy, but that's not
based on anything. I got to go visit
Alix Klineman in Italy last spring
break and got to see what her life is
like as a professional-level player. We
went to Milan, Florence and Cinque
Terra. So that was an amazing trip.
Very compact. I went with Mary
Ellen and Hannah [Benjamin], an
other volleyball alum. And talking to
her and other players that have
played overseas, I think it's worth a
shot. And I think it would be a cool
experience to live in another country

for a year or two. And they all say
that you say a year or two, but you'll
play for five or six years. But I want
to go through the process and see if I
get a cool opportunity locationwise
and with a team that's comfortable
and go from there. Otherwise it's
getting a job, which does not sound
as much fim as playing volleyball in
Italy. So I'm definitely going to try to
do that, which means I'll probably be
training with the indoor team still in
the offseason, on and off more at my
leisure than at their regimented
schedule but I'll probably be in the
gym quite a bit.
SF: That still sounds a little bit nicer
than the recommended schedule.

RW: Yeah. I won't have to come in at
6 a.m.
SF: How's your Italian?
RW: Not good.
SF: That's the idea for the class now
that you're looking for, the classes in
winter and spring.

RW: Yeah. I should probably take
Italian. That would actually be really
helpful. Good idea. My dad will prob
ably enjoy that. So yeah, I'm really
excited. Nervous, because Stanford's
so comfortable and it's home now. I
can't imagine leaving this place.
