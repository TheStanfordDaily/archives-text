# SENIOR SIT DOWN
## RACHEL WILLIAMS 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
In the first 2013-11 edition of the Senior
Sit Down, The Daily's Sam Fisher chatted
with women's volleyball senior outside hit
ter Rachel Williams. The following is a con
densed version of their conversation. For

Sam Fisher (SF): Now that we're in week three
of senior year, academically it seems like week
50 in terms of the sports season, I'm sure how
are you feeling? Does it feel real at all that this is
your last run?

Rachel Williams (RW): In week three, teachers
are starting to talk about midterms, so it's kind of
[hard], especially with us being on the road for
most of last week. We were gone Thesday to Sat
urday, so that's a lot of class missed and catching
up on that for midterms. It feels pretty normal.
The beginning of preseason, it was like, "Oh my
gosh. It's my senior preseason. This is our last
chance. This is our last time to do this and our last
trip here and our last trip there."
It's still a little bit [emotional] when we go on
the road and it's like my last time in the Galen
Center or Pauley Pavilion, or things like that. And
there's definitely a greater appreciation for play
ing in Maples, because there's only so many
matches left. But now that school's started, it's a
lot more in the grind, just focused on getting to
class, getting to practice on time, taking care of
the body. So not as much focus on every day being
one less day until graduation.
I know that seniors don't really like to talk
about graduation. We like to pretend that we're
staying here forever because this place is so amaz
ing. It's lots of hard work, lots of focus. In and out,
I'll notice things that it's like, "Yeah, this is it," but
it's not too overwhelming.

SF: You mentioned the weird travel schedule last
week. As a senior, you have a unique perspective.
In years one and two, [there was] very little tele
vision coverage. In years three and four, a lot of
television means very different types of trips like
that. What's that transition been like, getting used
to having to leave on a Tuesday rather than a
Thursday and figuring out how to balance school
and life?

RW: It's not as difficult as I would have assumed
it would be. It might be a little harder for the
freshmen, because they're adjusting to every
thing and having to miss that much class.... Defi
nitely I would say that it's asking a little bit more

of us as student-athletes to be on top of our work,
but nothing that we can't handle.
SF: Can you talk about what you're taking this fall
and what you have left before you graduate?
RW: I'm taking Earth Systems 10, to fulfill my
Natural Science GER.
SF: I still need to do that.

RW: I was going to take sports med and it got can
celled. I was so disappointed. That was with [Dan]
Garza he's a doctor on the 49ers. I heard that
was a great class so I was excited to take it. So I'm
taking this to fulfill the GER, I'm taking Soc 200,
which is a seminar for my major because I'm ma
joring in sociology. And that is basically a 25-page
research paper and I am going to focus on

whether there is greater racial diversity on athlet
ic varsity teams that have more scholarships than
the ones that have like three and have to divide
them up among the team. So I'm looking forward
to doing that project. And then my last class is
PoliSci 114 D, which is "Democracy, Development
and the Rule of Law" for my minor. And I will be
done with all of my major and minor requirements
after this quarter, so winter and spring is a lot
more play time. My dad's telling me that I need to
find classes that will get me a job. He's trying to
get me to take accounting and finance and econ,
which don't look as much fun as the other options.
Mel (Mary Ellen Luck), another senior on the
team (my roommate), wants to take sailing in
spring and tennis in winter, so I might join her.
