# PRESS CONFERENCE NOTES
## SHAW DENIES FAKING INJURIES 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford head coach David Shaw opened up
Tuesday's press luncheon in an unconventional
matter with an opening statement, read from
hand-written notes on a Stanford football
notepad, repeating what he had stated earlier
in the day during the Pac-12 coaches' telecon
ference.
"First and foremost, we do not fake in
juries," Shaw said. "We never have, we never
wi11.... I don't care what [Washington head
coach] Steve Sarkisian thinks he saw, we didn't
do it against Oregon and we're for sure not go
ing to do it against Washington."
Sarkisian publicly accused Stanford defen
sive line coach Randy Hart, who spent two
decades as an assistant at Washington, of en
couraging his players to fake injuries in order
to slow down the Huskies' offense. Two key
players fifth-year senior captains Shayne
Skov and Ben Gardner went down as Wash
ington drove late in the game to prompt Sark
isian's accusations.

Shaw said that Gardner and Skov are still
battling these injuries and Skov even sat out of
practice on Monday in the aftermath of the hy
perextension of his surgically repaired knee.
"I believe it's unprofessional to call out an
assistant coach on another team," said Shaw re
garding Sarkisian's accusation. "It's unprofes
sional and it's disrespectful. The only D-line
coach that I know of that's ever instructed play
ers to fake injury works at the University of
Washington and not Stanford. That's not call
ing someone out, that's stating a fact."
Shaw was referencing Huskies defensive
line coach Tosh Lupoi, who was suspended for a
game in 2010 after admitting to teaching the
fake injury ploy to his players for a game
against Oregon.

Shaw continued to defend Stanford and,
specifically, the program that he runs.
"I have strict instructions from every boss
that I have on campus, from the president of
the University to the provost to our athletic di
rector, to run a program that's above reproach,
that doesn't do anything questionable," Shaw
elaborated. "We don't allow it, we don't teach it,
we don't coach it."
The comment from Sarkisian that seemed to
irk Shaw the most was his quip that faking in
juries was "how they play at Stanford." Shaw
was especially forceful when responding to that
statement.
"How we play here at Stanford is averaging
