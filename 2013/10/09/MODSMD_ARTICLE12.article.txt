# PRESS CONFERENCE NOTES
## SHAW DENIES FAKING INJURIES 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford head coach David Shaw opened up
Tuesday's press luncheon in an unconventional
matter with an opening statement, read from
hand-written notes on a Stanford football
notepad, repeating what he had stated earlier
in the day during the Pac-12 coaches' telecon
ference.
"First and foremost, we do not fake in
juries," Shaw said. "We never have, we never
wi11.... I don't care what [Washington head
coach] Steve Sarkisian thinks he saw, we didn't
do it against Oregon and we're for sure not go
ing to do it against Washington."
Sarkisian publicly accused Stanford defen
sive line coach Randy Hart, who spent two
decades as an assistant at Washington, of en
couraging his players to fake injuries in order
to slow down the Huskies' offense. Two key
players fifth-year senior captains Shayne
Skov and Ben Gardner went down as Wash
ington drove late in the game to prompt Sark
isian's accusations.

Shaw said that Gardner and Skov are still
battling these injuries and Skov even sat out of
practice on Monday in the aftermath of the hy
perextension of his surgically repaired knee.
"I believe it's unprofessional to call out an
assistant coach on another team," said Shaw re
garding Sarkisian's accusation. "It's unprofes
sional and it's disrespectful. The only D-line
coach that I know of that's ever instructed play
ers to fake injury works at the University of
Washington and not Stanford. That's not call
ing someone out, that's stating a fact."
Shaw was referencing Huskies defensive
line coach Tosh Lupoi, who was suspended for a
game in 2010 after admitting to teaching the
fake injury ploy to his players for a game
against Oregon.

Shaw continued to defend Stanford and,
specifically, the program that he runs.
"I have strict instructions from every boss
that I have on campus, from the president of
the University to the provost to our athletic di
rector, to run a program that's above reproach,
that doesn't do anything questionable," Shaw
elaborated. "We don't allow it, we don't teach it,
we don't coach it."
The comment from Sarkisian that seemed to
irk Shaw the most was his quip that faking in
juries was "how they play at Stanford." Shaw
was especially forceful when responding to that
statement.
"How we play here at Stanford is averaging

5.5 penalties a game," Shaw re
sponded. "How we play here at
Stanford has led to three BCS bowl
games in a row, a Pac-12, a Rose
Bowl and an Orange Bowl champi
onship and a 100 percent gradua
tion rate. We're one of the most
well-respected programs in the na
tion. I'm not going to put that all on
the line just to beat Washington."

When not talking about accusa
tions of fake injuries, Shaw ad
dressed one of the major factors
that powered Stanford to victory
last Saturday against Washington:
its performance on special teams.
Ty Montgomery's kick returns
and Barry Sanders' punt return
may have stolen the show, but the
punt coverage unit was equally im
portant and impactful. Unlike many
other programs around the coun
try, Shaw and Stanford continue to
use key players from offense and
defense on special teams units.
"Special teams and particularly
coverage units are about running
and hitting," Shaw explained. "You
put your best guys at running and
hitting out there. At the same time,
we don't worry about if a guy gets
hurt. No, the guy plays football.
Find me a better guy on a punt cov

erage team than Skov."
On the offensive side of things,
Stanford struggled to find success
in the passing game all evening
long. Washington's cornerbacks
locked down Montgomery and jun
ior wideout Devon Cajuste and
gave junior quarterback Kevin
Hogan very little room for error.
"I think [Washington's defend
ers] contributed to us not being in
rhythm in the passing game," Shaw
explained. "They are very good,
very sound, have very good ath
letes, and have a very good
scheme."
Hogan struggled to find any
throwing lanes and didn't have one
of the better games of his career,
finishing 12-of-20 for 100 yards, a
touchdown and an interception.
With Washington quarterback Kei
th Price playing impressively on
the other side, Hogan's perform
ance appeared especially mediocre
to those skeptical of his abilities.
"He still hasn't started 12
games," said Shaw in defense of
Hogan. "His ceiling is extremely
high. We're going to go through
some more growing pains here and
there; he's going to have a couple
more unbelievable games and a
couple rough games. He's not a fin
ished product.... He knows he's not
perfect but he's pushing himself to
be as good as he can be."

ington drove late in the game to prompt Sark
isian's accusations.

Shaw said that Gardner and Skov are still
battling these injuries and Skov even sat out of
practice on Monday in the aftermath of the hy
perextension of his surgically repaired knee.
"I believe it's unprofessional to call out an
assistant coach on another team," said Shaw re
garding Sarkisian's accusation. "It's unprofes
sional and it's disrespectful. The only D-line
coach that I know of that's ever instructed play
ers to fake injury works at the University of
Washington and not Stanford. That's not call
ing someone out, that's stating a fact."
Shaw was referencing Huskies defensive
line coach Tosh Lupoi, who was suspended for a
game in 2010 after admitting to teaching the
fake injury ploy to his players for a game
against Oregon.

Shaw continued to defend Stanford and,
specifically, the program that he runs.
"I have strict instructions from every boss
that I have on campus, from the president of
the University to the provost to our athletic di
rector, to run a program that's above reproach,
that doesn't do anything questionable," Shaw
elaborated. "We don't allow it, we don't teach it,
we don't coach it."
The comment from Sarkisian that seemed to
irk Shaw the most was his quip that faking in
juries was "how they play at Stanford." Shaw
was especially forceful when responding to that
statement.
"How we play here at Stanford is averaging

5.5 penalties a game," Shaw re
sponded. "How we play here at
Stanford has led to three BCS bowl
games in a row, a Pac-12, a Rose
Bowl and an Orange Bowl champi
onship and a 100 percent gradua
tion rate. We're one of the most
well-respected programs in the na
tion. I'm not going to put that all on
the line just to beat Washington."

When not talking about accusa
tions of fake injuries, Shaw ad
dressed one of the major factors
that powered Stanford to victory
last Saturday against Washington:
its performance on special teams.
Ty Montgomery's kick returns
and Barry Sanders' punt return
may have stolen the show, but the
punt coverage unit was equally im
portant and impactful. Unlike many
other programs around the coun
try, Shaw and Stanford continue to
use key players from offense and
defense on special teams units.
"Special teams and particularly
coverage units are about running
and hitting," Shaw explained. "You
put your best guys at running and
hitting out there. At the same time,
we don't worry about if a guy gets
hurt. No, the guy plays football.
Find me a better guy on a punt cov

erage team than Skov."
On the offensive side of things,
Stanford struggled to find success
in the passing game all evening
long. Washington's cornerbacks
locked down Montgomery and jun
ior wideout Devon Cajuste and
gave junior quarterback Kevin
Hogan very little room for error.
"I think [Washington's defend
ers] contributed to us not being in
rhythm in the passing game," Shaw
explained. "They are very good,
very sound, have very good ath
letes, and have a very good
scheme."
Hogan struggled to find any
throwing lanes and didn't have one
of the better games of his career,
finishing 12-of-20 for 100 yards, a
touchdown and an interception.
With Washington quarterback Kei
th Price playing impressively on
the other side, Hogan's perform
ance appeared especially mediocre
to those skeptical of his abilities.
"He still hasn't started 12
games," said Shaw in defense of
Hogan. "His ceiling is extremely
high. We're going to go through
some more growing pains here and
there; he's going to have a couple
more unbelievable games and a
couple rough games. He's not a fin
ished product.... He knows he's not
perfect but he's pushing himself to
be as good as he can be."

Stanford head coach David Shaw opened up
Tuesday's press luncheon in an unconventional
matter with an opening statement, read from
hand-written notes on a Stanford football
notepad, repeating what he had stated earlier
in the day during the Pac-12 coaches' telecon
ference.
"First and foremost, we do not fake in
juries," Shaw said. "We never have, we never
wi11.... I don't care what [Washington head
coach] Steve Sarkisian thinks he saw, we didn't
do it against Oregon and we're for sure not go
ing to do it against Washington."
Sarkisian publicly accused Stanford defen
sive line coach Randy Hart, who spent two
decades as an assistant at Washington, of en
couraging his players to fake injuries in order
to slow down the Huskies' offense. Two key
players fifth-year senior captains Shayne
Skov and Ben Gardner went down as Wash
