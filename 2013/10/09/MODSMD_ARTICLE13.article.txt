# OPINIONS
## SEEING GREEN Neither Dollars Nor Sense 
### Holly Moeller 
One week before my grant
submission deadline, my in
ternal procrastinator finally
decided to get serious. I fired off
drafts to collaborators, requests for
letters of recommendation to my
mentors and one very clumsy re
search summary to an extraordi
narily tolerant friend. And then I
sat down at my computer and
pulled up the National Science
Foundation's grant application
webpage.
Only to be greeted by a white
screen and a few paragraphs of
text.
Bluntly translated, the website
read: "We're closed because the
Federal Government is shut down.
We'll let you know what we plan to
do with grant deadlines and what
not whenever Congress gets their
act together. Carry on doing your
science if you have money for it. If
not, sorry —we won't be cutting
any checks right now, either."
Oops. I thanked my lucky stars
that I'd downloaded the research
proposal instructions before the
shutdown took them offline, apolo
gized to my letter-writers for the
confusion and figured I'd be grate
ful if this bought me time for a few
extra rounds of spell-check.
Every year, the NSF provides
more than $6 billion in research
funding to scientists across the
United States and to U.S. citi
zens working abroad. It funded the
undergraduate field research that
cemented my interest in science, let
me spend the second year of my
master's degree on a thesis project
that truly excited me and is cur
rently footing the bill for a high
risk (and hopefully high-reward)
chunk of my doctoral dissertation.
For scientists active in my field
of ecology and evolution, whose
questions don't always link clearly
to medicine, commercial interests
or other "applied" results, NSF's
"pure science" funding can mean
the difference between leading
your field to the next great discov
ery and watching your bright ideas
fade into hazy daydreams.
The NSF isn't the only govern
ment agency that funds this basic
research. Also currently closed for
business are: the National Insti
tutes of Health, whose potentially
life-saving clinical trials are affected
just as much as the research money
it directs toward cell biology and ge
netics; the Environmental Protec
tion Agency, which happens to be
mid-rule on several important pol
lutants; NASA, except for a skele
ton crew keeping an eye on the
space station astronauts; and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, where the National
Weather Service employees are
frustrated about working for free.
No matter how temporary the
closure, the impacts are being felt
immediately as a cost to human
health (we're not monitoring the
start of the flu season!) and envi
ronmental monitoring (we've shut
down non-essential measurements
and lost access to some key
datasets).
And soon enough, the longer
term impacts will be irreversible.
I cringed as I read last week's
report on our Antarctic research
stations. On the cusp of launching
their summer fieldwork (remem
ber, seasons are reversed in the

Southern Hemisphere), dozens of
scientists now have to tell their
teams that, with federal funding di
aled down to zero, the research sta
tions they planned to use will now
need to shut their doors.
This is appalling news not
just for those (like myself) with a
bizarre fondness for weird mi
crobes, or others (read as: normal
people) who just love penguins
for a planet's worth of humans who
are struggling to understand just
how much they are impacting the
global climate. If funding doesn't
resume in a matter of weeks, we
could lose this year's chance for on
the-ground monitoring of critical
climate cues like ice sheet thick
ness, melting rates and seasonal
ecology dynamics.
Crises like this raise red flags
about the future reliability of public
science funding.
As the United States dials back
its research fleet, people like James
Cameron are mounting solo expedi
tions to the sea floor and Google ex
ecutives are bankrolling 270-foot
research vessels. We're actively
privatizing manned space flight. In
creasingly, my colleagues in acade
mia are securing multi-year posi
tions through funding from private
donors and organizations. Is the fu
ture of American scientific advance
private?
If it is, I can't help but voice the
classic defenses of government in
vestment in the sciences. Who will
pay for research that doesn't have
an obvious commercial benefit?
Who will pay for research that isn't
charismatic? Who will pay for re
search that isn't trendy in our pres
ent-day culture of flash-in-the-pan
Twitter hashtags?
While I applaud private invest
ment in scientific research, I'm not
sure it has the staying power of the
United States government and
the economy and tax dollars that
back it. But then again, these days
I'm not exactly confident in the
government, either. Of course, I'm
still refreshing the NSF's website.

decided to get serious. I fired off
drafts to collaborators, requests for
letters of recommendation to my
mentors and one very clumsy re
search summary to an extraordi
narily tolerant friend. And then I
sat down at my computer and
pulled up the National Science
Foundation's grant application
webpage.
Only to be greeted by a white
screen and a few paragraphs of
text.
Bluntly translated, the website
read: "We're closed because the
Federal Government is shut down.
We'll let you know what we plan to
do with grant deadlines and what
not whenever Congress gets their
act together. Carry on doing your
science if you have money for it. If
not, sorry —we won't be cutting
any checks right now, either."
Oops. I thanked my lucky stars
that I'd downloaded the research
proposal instructions before the
shutdown took them offline, apolo
gized to my letter-writers for the
confusion and figured I'd be grate
ful if this bought me time for a few
extra rounds of spell-check.
Every year, the NSF provides
more than $6 billion in research
funding to scientists across the
United States and to U.S. citi
zens working abroad. It funded the
undergraduate field research that
cemented my interest in science, let
me spend the second year of my
master's degree on a thesis project
that truly excited me and is cur
rently footing the bill for a high
risk (and hopefully high-reward)
chunk of my doctoral dissertation.
For scientists active in my field
of ecology and evolution, whose
questions don't always link clearly
to medicine, commercial interests
or other "applied" results, NSF's
"pure science" funding can mean
the difference between leading
your field to the next great discov
ery and watching your bright ideas
fade into hazy daydreams.
The NSF isn't the only govern
ment agency that funds this basic
research. Also currently closed for
business are: the National Insti
tutes of Health, whose potentially
life-saving clinical trials are affected
just as much as the research money
it directs toward cell biology and ge
netics; the Environmental Protec
tion Agency, which happens to be
mid-rule on several important pol
lutants; NASA, except for a skele
ton crew keeping an eye on the
space station astronauts; and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, where the National
Weather Service employees are
frustrated about working for free.
No matter how temporary the
closure, the impacts are being felt
immediately as a cost to human
health (we're not monitoring the
start of the flu season!) and envi
ronmental monitoring (we've shut
down non-essential measurements
and lost access to some key
datasets).
And soon enough, the longer
term impacts will be irreversible.
I cringed as I read last week's
report on our Antarctic research
stations. On the cusp of launching
their summer fieldwork (remem
ber, seasons are reversed in the

Southern Hemisphere), dozens of
scientists now have to tell their
teams that, with federal funding di
aled down to zero, the research sta
tions they planned to use will now
need to shut their doors.
This is appalling news not
just for those (like myself) with a
bizarre fondness for weird mi
crobes, or others (read as: normal
people) who just love penguins
for a planet's worth of humans who
are struggling to understand just
how much they are impacting the
global climate. If funding doesn't
resume in a matter of weeks, we
could lose this year's chance for on
the-ground monitoring of critical
climate cues like ice sheet thick
ness, melting rates and seasonal
ecology dynamics.
Crises like this raise red flags
about the future reliability of public
science funding.
As the United States dials back
its research fleet, people like James
Cameron are mounting solo expedi
tions to the sea floor and Google ex
ecutives are bankrolling 270-foot
research vessels. We're actively
privatizing manned space flight. In
creasingly, my colleagues in acade
mia are securing multi-year posi
tions through funding from private
donors and organizations. Is the fu
ture of American scientific advance
private?
If it is, I can't help but voice the
classic defenses of government in
vestment in the sciences. Who will
pay for research that doesn't have
an obvious commercial benefit?
Who will pay for research that isn't
charismatic? Who will pay for re
search that isn't trendy in our pres
ent-day culture of flash-in-the-pan
Twitter hashtags?
While I applaud private invest
ment in scientific research, I'm not
sure it has the staying power of the
United States government and
the economy and tax dollars that
back it. But then again, these days
I'm not exactly confident in the
government, either. Of course, I'm
still refreshing the NSF's website.
