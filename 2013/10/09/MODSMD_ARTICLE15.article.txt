# DON'T KNOW JACK
## Newton Leroy Did It Better 
### Jack Weller 
Ted Cruz is the national buga
boo of late, and that seems
about right. Within the space
of nine months in the Senate, he's
become a legitimate presidential
contender and a stronger influence
on the House Republican caucus
than John Boehner.
Indeed, his enormous talents are
exceeded only by his vast legislative
accomplishments. He is a man who
spoke for 21 hours about the impor
tance of listening. He is a man who
single-handedly uncovered Chuck
Hagel's North Korean sympathies.
He is the only man willing to recog
nize unsung patriot Jesse Helms.
Most importantly, Cruz also has the
potential to bring people together,
usually in dislike of him. I don't
know how someone manages to
make enemies out of Dianne Fein
stein, Lynn Westmoreland and John
McCain at the same time, but clear
ly the junior senator from Texas has
rare gifts. So as we watch the gears

of government grind to a halt, it's
important to remember, and
uniquely honor, the individual most
responsible.
But Ted, I have to tell you, some
body already did it better. Seven
teen years ago, not long after you
ferreted the communists out of
Harvard Law School, a different
man stood tall in the halls of Con
gress like a colossus. Newton Leroy
Gingrich has already been there
and done that.
Though you may think of your
self as a smart guy, Newt made sure
to tell us every day that he was the
smartest. Though it does take guts
to read "Green Eggs and Ham" on
the Senate floor, Newt was his own
Dr. Seuss character, capable of in
venting a new reality every morn
ing. One fish, two fish, colony on the
moon fish? Senator Cruz, you may
be famous right now for invective
and hyperbole, but Newt Gingrich
leveraged both of those to political

success long before it was the cool
thing to do in the Republican Party.
Gingrich brought down a speak
er of the house on ethics charges of
which he himself was also guilty. He
led Republicans to their first Con
gressional majority in 40 years, on
ly to be shoved out the door by his
own party within two election cy
cles. Though you may only know
him in his modern incarnation, the
presidential candidate who de
manded that poor children finally
start cleaning their own schools,
Newt Gingrich used to be thought
of as a relevant and influential polit
ical figure, if you can believe it.
Most relevantly, Newton Leroy
was the last guy who decided that a
government shutdown was the best
way to get his name in the papers.
And it did. Right next to the infa
mous picture of a big crying baby. I
tend to think most '9os nostalgia is
misplaced, but in this instance the
'9os version of a legislative troll was
vastly more entertaining. Don't just
look at the media response, look at
the substantive policy outcomes
achieved by the shutdown. Without
Newt's tactical brilliance, the radi
cal Clinton agenda would never
have been beaten, and the Contract
with America would never have
been passed. Some would even say
that without Newt Gingrich, Presi
dent Dole wouldn't have stood a
chance.
Indeed, Newt Gingrich played
the game masterfully. And just look
at where he is now.
So remember this, Senator
Cruz. Newt Gingrich already did it,
and he did it better than you.
