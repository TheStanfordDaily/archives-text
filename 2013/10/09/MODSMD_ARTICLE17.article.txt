# RODGERS KEYS CARDINAL VICTORY
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Only one team event removed from a crush
ing, season-ending tournament at the NCAA re
gional in May and the graduation of key play
ers Andrew Yun and Steve Kearney, the Stan
ford men's golf team is seemingly back on top
again. The Cardinal thoroughly dominated the
14-team field at the inaugural Erin Hills Invita
tional in Erin, Wis., winning by eight strokes
over conference foe UCLA. In doing so, junior
Patrick Rodgers also collected the individual
win, the sixth of his collegiate career.
"I'm proud of the guys on picking up their
first win of the season in our second event," said
head coach Conrad Ray. "Our guys did a nice job
in their preparation and practice gearing up to
the event, and I think that served us well at the
tournament. It was neat to see the team win and
play well with the lead [Tuesday]. They hit some
smart shots, avoided trouble and double bogeys
which is something we've been talking a lot
about and they've been working on."
If Ray's message was to stay away from high
numbers, his players clearly got the message at
Erin Hills: The five-man squad combined for on
ly three double bogeys or worse over the 54-hole
tournament. Experience with the course cer
tainly helped, with Rodgers, senior Cameron
Wilson and freshman Jim Liu all having played
the 2011 U.S. Amateur on the 7-year-old course.
The Card was able to drop strokes in bunch
es. Stanford received two eagles from Wilson
both on the par-5 14th hole in rounds one and
two and a dramatic hole-in-one courtesy of
sophomore David Boote on the par-3 sixth in the
second round. It was the first hole-in-one in
competitive play in the history of Erin Hills.
"So far, we've done a great job of keeping it

with a 7-under performance in the tournament that helped him claim the sixth individual win of his decorated collegiate career.
in play off the tee," com
mented Wilson on the team's
play after Monday's second
round. "The fescue grass
and native areas are penal
but many of the holes can be
attacked from the fairway.
Also, we've capitalized on
the par-ss, most of which are
reachable."
Rodgers, Wilson and
Boote all attacked the four
par-5s well, shooting a com
bined 11 under par on those
holes. Wilson fared especial
ly well, shooting 7-under on
the par-ss, for which the av
erage length was 590 yards.
Wilson ultimately finished
alongside teammate Boote in
a four-way tie for sixth place
at 2-under par.
Rodgers saw his name
atop the leaderboard for the
entire event, shooting 68-72-
69 on the par-72 course to

best his closest competitor,
Ryan McCormick of St.
John's, by three strokes.
"Patrick Rodgers picked
up his sixth individual win
and played really well with
the lead today coming down
the stretch," Ray said. "He
kept the ball in front of him
and made a couple of key up
and-downs when he needed
to, which really helped his
score and allowed him to
pick up the win."
Freshmen Jim Liu and
Maverick McNealy rounded
out the Cardinal's lineup
making their NCAA debuts.
Liu, tied for third after 36
holes, placed T-lOth with an
aggregate 1-under 215. Mc-
Nealy fired an even-par 72 in
Sunday's opening round but
faded over the last two days
of the event, shooting a com
bined 4-over par to notch a
T-25th finish. The duo beat
out veterans Dom Francks,
Patrick Grimes and Shane
Lebow for the right to be on
the traveling squad.
"They both have done re

ally well in qualifying and in
their preparation, so we de
cided they were good fits for
our lineup this year," said
Ray of his freshmen. "I think
everyone is excited about
our depth this year, and the
freshmen have definitely al
ready made their mark early
on here during the first cou
ple weeks of the season."
In the team competition,
the Card led early and never
looked back. The team
opened up a six-shot lead
over the Bruins and SMU af
ter 18 holes, with the advan
tage ballooning to 11 strokes
after the second round.
Though UCLA made a bit of
a run on the back nine on
Tuesday, the Bruins' tourna
ment-low round of 9-under
279 only got them to within
eight shots of Stanford.
The Cardinal next com
petes Oct. 18-20 at the Geor
gia Tech-hosted U.S. Colle
giate Championships.
