# RODGERS KEYS CARDINAL VICTORY
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Only one team event removed from a crush
ing, season-ending tournament at the NCAA re
gional in May and the graduation of key play
ers Andrew Yun and Steve Kearney, the Stan
ford men's golf team is seemingly back on top
again. The Cardinal thoroughly dominated the
14-team field at the inaugural Erin Hills Invita
tional in Erin, Wis., winning by eight strokes
over conference foe UCLA. In doing so, junior
Patrick Rodgers also collected the individual
win, the sixth of his collegiate career.
"I'm proud of the guys on picking up their
first win of the season in our second event," said
head coach Conrad Ray. "Our guys did a nice job
in their preparation and practice gearing up to
the event, and I think that served us well at the
tournament. It was neat to see the team win and
play well with the lead [Tuesday]. They hit some
smart shots, avoided trouble and double bogeys
which is something we've been talking a lot
about and they've been working on."
If Ray's message was to stay away from high
numbers, his players clearly got the message at
Erin Hills: The five-man squad combined for on
ly three double bogeys or worse over the 54-hole
tournament. Experience with the course cer
tainly helped, with Rodgers, senior Cameron
Wilson and freshman Jim Liu all having played
the 2011 U.S. Amateur on the 7-year-old course.
The Card was able to drop strokes in bunch
es. Stanford received two eagles from Wilson
both on the par-5 14th hole in rounds one and
two and a dramatic hole-in-one courtesy of
sophomore David Boote on the par-3 sixth in the
second round. It was the first hole-in-one in
competitive play in the history of Erin Hills.
"So far, we've done a great job of keeping it
