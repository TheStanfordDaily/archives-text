# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## TAKE THREE: CLUTCH CARDINAL IN THE PAST? 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Stanford was a great
fourth-quarter team, in
2012, scoring 70 points to
its opponents' 39 in the
final frame. That pro
duction late in games
helped the Cardinal go 8-
2 in contests decided by a
touchdown or less last
season. However, Stan
ford hasn't been nearly as
invincible in the fourth
quarter in 2013. Though
the Card has scored
points in just, five fourth
quarters, it has also sur
rendered f9,10 more than
it did in its U games last
season. The offensive line
hasn't always gotten the
push Stanford needs in
late short-yardage situa
tions, and the secondary
has given up a lot of
yards through the air at
the end of the game. Those
issues were front-and
center in the team's close
win against Washington,
so we asked football writ
ers David Cohn, Winston
Shi and Do-Hyoung
Park: Has the Cardinal
lost its clutch?

David Cohn: I have to be
honest: This question seems
to be in line with the Bayless
ian model of trolling. Substi
tute "Leßron James" for
"Stanford" in this question
and you have the classic Skip
Bayless "debate" topic.
As such, I am sure you
can tell where I am going
with my answer: The notion
that Stanford has lost its
"clutch gene" is absolutely
ludicrous. First of all, each
team and each game within a
season is its own unique enti
ty. More specifically, 2013
Stanford has a different pro
file of strengths and weak
nesses when compared to
last year's team, and the
game situations that the
Card has faced in 2013 is

consistently different from
the circumstances encoun
tered by the Cardinal in
2012.
This year's team is most
noticeably different from last
year's version on offense; the
Cardinal in 2013 has aver
aged nearly 40 points on of
fense — including a 55-spot
against Washington State
and has put up 42 and 31
points on top-25 opponents
Arizona State and Washing
ton, respectively. In contrast,
last year's team, on average,
scored 10 fewer points per
game.
As a result of the in
creased firepower on of
fense, Stanford has gone into
the fourth quarter of every
game this season with a dou
ble-digit lead, including a 32-
point lead against Arizona
State. On the other hand, the
Cardinal down the stretch in
2012 found itself behind or
clinging to the narrowest of
leads six times.
Obviously, the strategies
and focus on offense are
completely different when a
team is holding a comfort
able lead versus a situation
in which that same team is
protecting a slim lead or
even trailing. The Cardinal
in 2013 has needed to pre
serve wins by consistently
running the ball, extending
drives and trying to run out
the clock. Points should not
be the concern when a team
has a large lead.
Ultimately, even if you
are not convinced by my
analysis above, Stanford's
record this season is really
the only set of numbers I
need to argue this question:
5-0. That record seems pret
ty clutch in my eyes.

Winston Shi: Any Stanford
fans worrying about the
clutch factor are definitely
overreacting. I agree with
David that Stanford is play
ing a different game than it
was last year, and it's ulti
mately better to be on the

good end of garbage time
than not have garbage time
at all. Stanford had a lot of
close games last year and a
couple of slips in the second
ary could have brought on a
losing record, and it's good
that the Cardinal is enjoying
larger margins of victory.
But I'd also like to highlight
a few other things.
Through five games,
Stanford has faced better
competition than it did last
year. This year's Washington
would beat 2012 Washington
by three touchdowns. Ari
zona State and Washington
State have improved as well.
There have been issues in
garbage time against Army
and Arizona State, but
garbage time by definition is
irrelevant; in five games,
there has been only one
game in which Stanford has
been truly tested, and Wash
ington should really be a top
-10 team.
I think Stanford taking
its foot off the gas is not a
sign of lack of clutch, but a
sign of respect for its defense
and its opponents. Nobody
who has watched Stanford in
its first four games can say
that Stanford wasn't in con
trol of the games. Even in
the ASU game, look at Kevin
Hogan coming back in to
close things out. He was ab
solutely in command.
Stanford is capable of do
ing better than how it did
against Washington and on
the right day the Card might
annihilate the Huskies, but
the score of the game was
close enough to what one
could reasonably expect. I'm
not worried about Stanford.
Stanford was clutch last year
and with most of last year's
team intact, it'll be capable of
that once again. If Stanford
loses, it will be because it's
faced a worthy opponent, not
because it couldn't rise to the
occasion.

Do-Hyoung Park: I'm going
to be honest here: While I

don't have any evidence that
suggests that Stanford has
"lost its clutch," its play late
in games this season as it has
gone about protecting its
leads has definitely made me
worried.
Look at Stanford's foot
ball season so far. As David
mentioned earlier, Stanford
has yet to trail going into
the fourth quarter of any of
its games so far this season.
As a matter of fact, it has
had double-digit leads go
ing into the final frame in
each of its five victories.
Those aren't clutch situa
tions by any stretch of the
imagination. We simply
haven't seen Stanford in
any situations in which it
has had to decisively show
its mettle thus far this sea
son, and so I'm not going to
speculate on what we might
have seen if Stanford had
found itself in such situa
tions. We'll see plenty of that
moving forward with big
games against UCLA and
Oregon looming on the hori

zon. Time will tell.
But what does worry me
is Stanford's play while pro
tecting its leads and this is
where I'll disagree with Win
ston's statement that Stan
ford has been in control.
There was obviously the
fourth-quarter meltdown de
bacle against Arizona State,
and this past Saturday's
matchup against Washington
reinforced the fact that Stan
ford's secondary has been
very porous late in games.
And the offense hasn't been
much better, struggling to
move the ball with any effica
cy whatsoever. Heck, it
couldn't even pick up one
first down that would have
sealed the game against
Washington.
Stanford's play-calling
hasn't been very conducive
to protecting leads. Shaw's
insistence to stick to the
ground, while fundamentally
reasonable, has not been jus
tified by the run game's play
on the field late in games.
While running it down oppo-

nents' throats has worked in
those situations in previous
years, it hasn't worked this
year. And what worries me is
that Stanford is refusing to
mix it up with more creative
play-calling to move the
chains.

And with a near-loss to
Washington only averted by
a pass that was just inches
too low, I think that unless
that changes, the Card will
slip up at some point. No
team is perfect, and I think
such mental mistakes could
eventually doom a team that
made its big run last year
coming from behind every
game instead of holding
leads.

David and Winston are a bit
worried about Do's lack of
clutch writing. To ease their
concerns, contact David and
Winston at dmcohn@ Stan
ford. edu and wshi9^@Stan
ford. edu, respectively, and to
help Do improve his clutch
ness, email him at dparko°27

Stanford football head coach David Shaw (above) and the Cardinal have performed in
an uncharacteristically shaky manner in the fourth quarters of big games against Arizona
State and Washington this season, prompting questions from both fans and reporters.
