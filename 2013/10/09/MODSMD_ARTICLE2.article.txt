## Oxford Fall '14 cancelled by renovations Stanford House to undergo six- month construction project 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
The Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram (BOSP) in Oxford will not oper
ate during Fall Quarter 2014-15 due to
renovations on the Stanford House.
The total construction project will
include a remodeling of student living
spaces, adding a classroom large
enough for all of the students in the
program and creating disability access
in the facility, according to Irene
Kennedy, executive director and vice
provost of BOSP
Kennedy said the renovations will
cost approximately $4 million and will
be funded through general funds from
the facility's reserve. She added that
the last renovation to the Stanford
House was done 30 years ago.
"It's simply time to refresh and re
place again," she said.
The renovation project will likely
begin a day after students in the
Spring 2013-14 program depart from
Oxford and end before the start of win
ter break in 2014, according to
Kennedy.
"We were looking for the minimum
impact on students," she said. "The
other option would have been [to start
during] spring quarter, but we weren't
ready to launch the project at that
point."
However, Kennedy said the main
reason for choosing to renovate during
fall quarter was that it allowed a six
month construction period because of
the summer break.
She said BOSP began reviewing
general contractors for the renovation
this week.
Towards the end of the program, a
few students in Oxford last spring
gathered with officials to discuss the
possibility for the renovation project.
Many, like Tyler Haddow 'l4, agreed
that the Stanford House was in need of
some renovations.
"The access to disabled students is
important," Haddow said. "I don't
know what they would have done if a
disabled student had studied abroad
there. There was no elevator; it was
hard to get in the house."
However, Haddow did not think
that all the renovations are necessary.
"I was actually not sure why we re
ally needed a room in the house that
fits all the students," he said. "I think
that there was one, maybe two times
when all of us gathered in one place."
Robert Mata 'l4, who also partici
pated in the Oxford program last
spring, thinks the newly released in
formation on the renovation project
appropriately echoes what was dis
cussed abroad.
