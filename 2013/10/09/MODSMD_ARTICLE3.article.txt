## Woods Institute projects go global Seven interdisciplinary research teams receive funding 
### SABELLE SMYTHE STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Woods Institute for the Envi
ronment has announced its latest crop of Envi
ronmental Venture Projects (EVP), each of
which will receive funding over the next two
years to tackle significant environmental issues
worldwide.
The grants for the seven projects total near
ly $1.25 million. The selection process aimed to
identify interdisciplinary research with facul
ty members coming from fields as diverse as an
thropology and physics that sought practical
solutions to global problems.
"It's a really interesting funding mecha
nism," said Michael Hsieh '93, assistant profes
sor of urology and grant recipient. "They specif
ically want interdisciplinary efforts, so, for ex
ample, at least one investigator on every EVP
project needs to be outside of the Woods Insti
tute."
This year's projects span five continents,
from one endeavor that aims to understand the
effects of ammonium on marine life in the near
by San Francisco Bay Delta, to another that
hopes to alleviate lead contamination in food and
topsoil in rural Bangladesh. The new grant re
cipients join 49 other Woods Institute funded re
search teams working in 24 countries around
the world.
The newly funded projects also cover a wide
variety of disciplines, with several departments
being represented for the first time.
Formed in 2004 to provide sustainable
sources of food, water and other vital needs to
communities around the world, the Woods Insti
tute for the Environment has continually devot-

Ed itself to interdisciplinary work, with involve
ment from faculty from all seven of Stanford's
schools.
Past EVPs have led to successful advance
ment in a variety of fields, from new wastewater
treatment technology to biodegradable building
materials to endangered species protection in
California.
Recipients of the project funds passed a rig
orous two-tiered application process. In early
January, applicants presented a letter of intent.
From this pool, teams that the selection commit
tee deemed competitive were asked to submit a
full proposal in early April.
The selection process prioritized projects
that are "high-risk" and "transformative," with
a focus on practical solutions to significant prob
lems. Teams were also required to represent
new collaborations between faculties who have
not worked together in the past, with preference
given to teams who have not worked with the
Woods Institute before.
In addition to the project in the San Francis
co Bay Delta, North American-based projects
include a new, more efficient way of conducting
marine life censuses using environmental DNA,
tissue and waste cells found in water samples;
and a project to predict the effects of climate
change on infrastructure to prevent highway
bridge failure.
Other grant recipients include a project to
balance cultural sustainability and environmen
tal conservation in the deserts of Australia; a
study on insect-parasite interactions that aims
to help predict global outbreaks of insect-borne
diseases; and an effort to control schistosomia-
