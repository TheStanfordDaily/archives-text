After developing a mobile payments com
pany with his friend in 2011 during his sopho
more year, Nima Ahmadi 'l3 decided to take

time away from Stanford.
When Ahmadi and his co
founder approached Pres
ident John Hennessy in
Spring 2011 with a pitch
and a request for leave,
Hennessy gave Ahmadi
the green light.
"We told him our idea
...and he said, 'Guys, I
think it's time to dive in,"'
Ahmadi said.
But for many Stanford
students who file for
leaves, stories like Ahma
di's are the exception, not
the rule.
"You have examples
that the media puts before
you, and you think to your
self that a Zuckerberg is a
common occurrence," said
Virgil Zanders 'l4.
Stanford University's
leave of absence policy—
which allows students to
re-enroll without a formal
application —is different
from that of other univer
sities. The open-ended pol-

icy provides away for a variety of students to
leave the university and return at any point
during their academic careers.
Having left Stanford two years into an elec
trical engineering degree due to financial diffi
culties, Zanders' path back to the Farm wasn't
exactly easy
After he left Stanford, Zanders landed a
job at a hedge fund in Palo Alto. He said he
found success in private equity, and when his
boss closed the company, Zanders cashed out
and used his money to travel the world.
But when Zanders lost the money he'd
made in stock market deals, he realized that
without a degree, he had hit a glass ceiling in
the workforce. Zanders matriculated back in
to Stanford in 2012, and, according to him, the
transition back into the college environment
was difficult.
However, many students who take leaves
of absence quickly find that there are re
sources on campus to support them when
they return.

Resources aplenty
Strong returning-student advising has be
come part of a university-wide effort in recent
years to establish support programs for stu
dents, according to Sally Mentzer, the aca
demic advisor for returning students in the
office of Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR).
"I love supporting people in making au
thentic choices," Mentzer said.
