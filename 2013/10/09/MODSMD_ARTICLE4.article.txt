After developing a mobile payments com
pany with his friend in 2011 during his sopho
more year, Nima Ahmadi 'l3 decided to take

time away from Stanford.
When Ahmadi and his co
founder approached Pres
ident John Hennessy in
Spring 2011 with a pitch
and a request for leave,
Hennessy gave Ahmadi
the green light.
"We told him our idea
...and he said, 'Guys, I
think it's time to dive in,"'
Ahmadi said.
But for many Stanford
students who file for
leaves, stories like Ahma
di's are the exception, not
the rule.
"You have examples
that the media puts before
you, and you think to your
self that a Zuckerberg is a
common occurrence," said
Virgil Zanders 'l4.
Stanford University's
leave of absence policy—
which allows students to
re-enroll without a formal
application —is different
from that of other univer
sities. The open-ended pol-

icy provides away for a variety of students to
leave the university and return at any point
during their academic careers.
Having left Stanford two years into an elec
trical engineering degree due to financial diffi
culties, Zanders' path back to the Farm wasn't
exactly easy
After he left Stanford, Zanders landed a
job at a hedge fund in Palo Alto. He said he
found success in private equity, and when his
boss closed the company, Zanders cashed out
and used his money to travel the world.
But when Zanders lost the money he'd
made in stock market deals, he realized that
without a degree, he had hit a glass ceiling in
the workforce. Zanders matriculated back in
to Stanford in 2012, and, according to him, the
transition back into the college environment
was difficult.
However, many students who take leaves
of absence quickly find that there are re
sources on campus to support them when
they return.

Resources aplenty
Strong returning-student advising has be
come part of a university-wide effort in recent
years to establish support programs for stu
dents, according to Sally Mentzer, the aca
demic advisor for returning students in the
office of Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR).
"I love supporting people in making au
thentic choices," Mentzer said.

probation must submit a personal
statement defending the reasons he
or she feels prepared, Mentzer said.
The student must also complete a Re
quest to Return and Register form,
outlining his or her personal and aca
demic goals.
According to Mentzer, students
who typically take leaves of absence
have suffered economic, academic,
psychological or filial setbacks. Her
advising follows a holistic approach,
working with other offices on campus
to help ease the transition.
Other new efforts are also under
way on campus to support returning
students. Two years ago, Mentzer
started the Resilience Project, which
provides in-residence workshops to
students who struggle academically.
Last year, associate director of UAR,
Lourdes Andrade, founded a program
that matches returning undergrads
with post-grad student coaches.
After a yearlong suspension fol
lowed by another yearlong voluntary
leave, Thembi Thompson 'l4 credited
her academic coach, Angela Farr
Schiller, for her success at Stanford.
"[Angela] helps me with study
habits, notetaking, organization...
whatever I need," Thompson said.
'And I need someone to hold me ac
countable."
Thompson said that these re
sources are only effective for students
willing to take advantage of them.
Although students are given sup
port when they return to Stanford,
many of them still value the time they
spent away from the university.
"It made me aware of what my
strengths were and how the real

world functioned," Ahmadi said.
Zanders also credited his leave of
absences with enhancing his overall
education.
"When you take the time off—and
you understand how the world oper
ates —you recognize what the de
gree does," he said.
Ahmadi is now in his first year at
the Stanford Graduate School of
Business. Thompson said she hopes
to earn a master's degree in behav
ioral psychology after she graduates
from Stanford in March. Zanders
said he plans to begin law school in
2015.
"Being a returning student is not
something to be ashamed of. It's
something to be proud of," Zander
said. "Sometimes doing things differ
ently makes you a better person, a
stronger person. If you see yourself
that way, I think the world will become
that way for you."
