## Senate discusses new schedule proposal 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
Tackling a 20-page agenda,
the 15th Undergraduate Senate
gathered on Tuesday evening in
a meeting nearing two hours,
which included a five-minute re
cess. Despite a few moments of
disorder, Senate Chair Ben Hol
ston 'l5 commanded the meet
ing, controlling a substantive
open forum on 8:30 a.m. class
times and passing three bills,
$20,193 in funding bills.
"I think the fact that we are
having long meetings is a good
thing, because the reason
they're long is that we're doing a
lot," Holston said. "We're very
busy, we're very committed to
helping the University and on
nights like tonight, that takes
time."

One of the central parts of
Tuesday's meeting was the dis
cussionâ€” initiated by Senator
Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6 on a
scheduling proposal written by
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam and Uni
versity Registrar Tom Black
that will be discussed at the Fac
ulty Senate meeting this Thurs
day.
Elam and Black's proposal
recommends several scheduling
changes, including that all class
es start on the half hour from
8:30 a.m. until 7:30 p.m.

President Dan Ashton 'l4 were
