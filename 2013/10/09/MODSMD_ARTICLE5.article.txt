## Senate discusses new schedule proposal 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
Tackling a 20-page agenda,
the 15th Undergraduate Senate
gathered on Tuesday evening in
a meeting nearing two hours,
which included a five-minute re
cess. Despite a few moments of
disorder, Senate Chair Ben Hol
ston 'l5 commanded the meet
ing, controlling a substantive
open forum on 8:30 a.m. class
times and passing three bills,
$20,193 in funding bills.
"I think the fact that we are
having long meetings is a good
thing, because the reason
they're long is that we're doing a
lot," Holston said. "We're very
busy, we're very committed to
helping the University and on
nights like tonight, that takes
time."

One of the central parts of
Tuesday's meeting was the dis
cussion— initiated by Senator
Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6 on a
scheduling proposal written by
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam and Uni
versity Registrar Tom Black
that will be discussed at the Fac
ulty Senate meeting this Thurs
day.
Elam and Black's proposal
recommends several scheduling
changes, including that all class
es start on the half hour from
8:30 a.m. until 7:30 p.m.
Mouzykantskii and ASSU
President Dan Ashton 'l4 were
invited to a meeting with Black,
Elam and the Chair of the Facul
ty Senate David Palumbo-Liu
last Wednesday to discuss their

discussed by the Faculty Senate that would standardize class start times on the half hour from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
thoughts on the proposal.
"We are thankful to the regis
trar for spending the time he spent
on the proposal to rationalize
scheduling for students,"
Mouzykantskii said. "The one part
that I, as a representative of the
student body, and Dan, as a repre
sentative for the Executive of AS
SU, wanted to address, was moving
class times up to 8:30 a.m."
Mouzykantskii felt that in this
situation, the Senate —as the
elected representatives of the un
dergraduate student body could
represent student opinion on keep
ing the class start time at 9 a.m.
Black indicated he was willing to
consider this modification, accord
ing to Mouzykantskii.
The Senate was unable to vote
on a resolution about amending the
registrar's proposal because, tech
nically, the full text of the resolu
tion must be presented at least one
week in advance of the Senate
meeting and the resolution was not
presented until Sunday. The sena
tors were largely supportive of the

amendment, however, noting the
inconvenience to athletes and cit
ing widespread student opposition
to the earlier start times.
Although bylaws did not permit
official action on the issue, the Sen
ate was able to take a straw poll,
assessing whether the senators
were in support of the spirit of the
resolution in favor of moving the
start of classes to 9 a.m.
Twelve of the 14 senators were
in support of the spirit of the reso
lution, with Hisham Al-Falih 'l6
and Ryan Matsumoto 'l6 abstain
ing. Mouzykantskii will present
these results to the Faculty Senate
on Thursday during his three
minute speaking time on student
opinion.
Following open forum, the Sen
ate passed a bill appointing Hunter
Kodama 'l4 as ASSU Elections
Commissioner, and then discussed
two proposals that were presented
by Assistant Financial Manager
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 last
week; the first proposal was to up
grade the ASSU offices and the
second to study and improve ASSU
operations. After some back and
forth between Mouzykantskii and
Trusheim, a few friendly amend
ments were added, and the two
bills were passed.

The Senate also began dis
cussing bills that will be voted on in
future meetings including a win
ter quarter grant bill, currently ti
tled "A Snowy Surprise: Winter
Quarter Grant Program," which
creates a $50,000 grant to support
general fees groups' winter quarter
events.
The Senate Innovation Bill
which will distribute $3,000 to each
senator to help affect change in the
Stanford community was draft
ed by Mouzykantskii this past
week based on Trusheim's initial
blueprint. The two aim to meet in
the next week to hash out some of
the bill's details, such as ensuring
that there is a strong system of
checks and balances in the
process.
Lastly, the Senate suspended
the rules of order at the end of the
meeting to reassign Brianna
Brown 'l6 to the Appropriations
Committee to replace Senator Ab
by Dow 'l6, who recently left the
committee. The Senate kept the
rules of order suspended to provide
reimbursements for Mouzykantskii
and Deputy Chair Anna Breed 'l6,
respectively.

that will be discussed at the Fac

day.
Elam and Black's proposal
recommends several scheduling
changes, including that all class
es start on the half hour from
8:30 a.m. until 7:30 p.m.

last Wednesday to discuss their

The 15th Undergraduate Senate held a lengthy, substantive open forum on amending a class schedule proposal to be
discussed by the Faculty Senate that would standardize class start times on the half hour from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
thoughts on the proposal.
"We are thankful to the regis
trar for spending the time he spent
on the proposal to rationalize
scheduling for students,"
Mouzykantskii said. "The one part
that I, as a representative of the
student body, and Dan, as a repre
sentative for the Executive of AS
SU, wanted to address, was moving
class times up to 8:30 a.m."
Mouzykantskii felt that in this
situation, the Senate —as the
elected representatives of the un
dergraduate student body could
represent student opinion on keep
ing the class start time at 9 a.m.
Black indicated he was willing to
consider this modification, accord
ing to Mouzykantskii.
The Senate was unable to vote
on a resolution about amending the
registrar's proposal because, tech
nically, the full text of the resolu
tion must be presented at least one
week in advance of the Senate
meeting and the resolution was not
presented until Sunday. The sena
tors were largely supportive of the

amendment, however, noting the
inconvenience to athletes and cit
ing widespread student opposition
to the earlier start times.
Although bylaws did not permit
official action on the issue, the Sen
ate was able to take a straw poll,
assessing whether the senators
were in support of the spirit of the
resolution in favor of moving the
start of classes to 9 a.m.
Twelve of the 14 senators were
in support of the spirit of the reso
lution, with Hisham Al-Falih 'l6
and Ryan Matsumoto 'l6 abstain
ing. Mouzykantskii will present
these results to the Faculty Senate
on Thursday during his three
minute speaking time on student
opinion.
Following open forum, the Sen
ate passed a bill appointing Hunter
Kodama 'l4 as ASSU Elections
Commissioner, and then discussed
two proposals that were presented
by Assistant Financial Manager
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 last
week; the first proposal was to up
grade the ASSU offices and the
second to study and improve ASSU
operations. After some back and
forth between Mouzykantskii and
Trusheim, a few friendly amend
ments were added, and the two
bills were passed.

The Senate also began dis
cussing bills that will be voted on in
future meetings including a win
ter quarter grant bill, currently ti
tled "A Snowy Surprise: Winter
Quarter Grant Program," which
creates a $50,000 grant to support
general fees groups' winter quarter
events.
The Senate Innovation Bill
which will distribute $3,000 to each
senator to help affect change in the
Stanford community was draft
ed by Mouzykantskii this past
week based on Trusheim's initial
blueprint. The two aim to meet in
the next week to hash out some of
the bill's details, such as ensuring
that there is a strong system of
checks and balances in the
process.
Lastly, the Senate suspended
the rules of order at the end of the
meeting to reassign Brianna
Brown 'l6 to the Appropriations
Committee to replace Senator Ab
by Dow 'l6, who recently left the
committee. The Senate kept the
rules of order suspended to provide
reimbursements for Mouzykantskii
and Deputy Chair Anna Breed 'l6,
respectively.

Tackling a 20-page agenda,
the 15th Undergraduate Senate
gathered on Tuesday evening in
a meeting nearing two hours,
which included a five-minute re
cess. Despite a few moments of
disorder, Senate Chair Ben Hol
ston 'l5 commanded the meet
ing, controlling a substantive
open forum on 8:30 a.m. class
times and passing three bills,
$20,193 in funding bills.
"I think the fact that we are
having long meetings is a good
thing, because the reason
they're long is that we're doing a
lot," Holston said. "We're very
busy, we're very committed to
helping the University and on
nights like tonight, that takes
time."

One of the central parts of
