## PA City Council sets aside money to help 'high-risk' homeless 
### â€” Alexa Liautaud 
After recent and highly contest
ed decisions by the Palo Alto City
Council to close Cubbei'ley Com
munity Center at night and create
a ban on people living in cars, city
officials have voted to spend
$250,000 on improving living condi
tions for the homeless population of
the city.
This spending budget would in
clude funding homeless shelters
and case managers employees
who will be in charge of locating
homeless individuals and guiding
them through the housing proce
dure by facilitating logistics with
the landlord as well as handling
personal issues and long-term hous
ing retention.
In an Oct. 7 City Council meet
ing, an 8-0 vote initiated a partner
ship between Santa Clara County
and the City of Palo Alto to assist
those who are at high risk and have

had contact with the criminal-judi
cial system get off the streets as
soon as possible.
These actions have been catego
rized as a one-off, short-term solu
tion addressing a small portion of a
much larger problem that still
needs to be solved. City officials and
others involved with these new ef
forts have simultaneously ex
pressed the need for more sustain
able, long-term solutions to the
problem.
