# Stanford physicists construct working, chip-sized particle accelerator
## 
### â€” Alexis Garduno Alexa Liautaud 
Stanford researchers have cre
ated a chip-sized particle accelera
tor smaller than a grain of salt and
capable of accelerating electrons
near the speed of light.
The work surrounding the chip
sized accelerator was published in

Nature, in which Stanford graduate
students explained how their cre
ation is capable of accelerating par
ticles ten times faster than the ex
isting SLAC accelerator.
Edgar Peralta Ph.D. 'l4 who
currently works in a Stanford ap
plied physics lab led by Professor
Robert Byer M.S. '67 Ph.D. '69
created the chip-sized accelerator.
Peralta said that the chip was basi
cally the structure that was put out
seven years ago by Tomas Plettner
Ph.D.'o3, who also worked under
Byer.
Peralta originally tried to con
struct the silica chip out of commer
cial parts previously purchased by
Byer's group, but the faulty ridges,
or "gratings," of the chip would
have made the experiment unsuc
cessful.
He ultimately fused two wafer
chips together to create a chip
essentially a tiny half-micron chan
nel through which the particles are
focused. From there, an infrared
light interacts with the ridges in the
channel to generate an electric field
that boosts the electron's energy.
The chip stands out from other
particle-accelerator options be
cause of how quickly the particles'
energy increases. At its full capaci
ty, researchers envision the chip
matching the 2-mile long SLAC lin
ear accelerator in power, but doing
so in 100 feet.
In the future, the team hopes to
see this innovation applied in the re
al world.
"For me, I was interested in the
direct application to radiation gen
eration," said Peralta.
Peralta envisions a future in
which cancer patients will no longer
be forced to travel by plane to reach
cancer treatment facilities to under
go special treatment, because local
hospitals could provide them with
these services.
The research behind the acceler
ator is funded by U.S. Department
of Energy's Office of Science and
Defense Advanced Research Proj
ects Agency (DARPA).
