Steven Greitzer '13 flies his unmanned aerial vehicle during a small build-and-automate competition
hosted by the Stanford UAV club on Oct. 5. Teams of four built Bixler-2 RC airplanes loaded with weight
and got a chance to fly their newly built unmanned aerial vehicles from Durand to Lake Lagunita.
