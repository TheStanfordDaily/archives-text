The article "GSEE seeks to
unite grad community" pub
lished on Oct. 8 said
Chinyere Ifeoma Nwabugwu
would receive her Ph.D. in
2016 when she will actually
receive it in 2014. It also in
correctly named the GSEE
EE Prom as simply the EE
Prom and Trevor Martin
Ph.D. 'l5 as Trevor Martin
'O3 MBA 'll. The Daily re
grets these errors.
