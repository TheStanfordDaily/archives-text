## Shaw uses media to his advantage 
### Winston Shi 
If there is any humor to Steve
Sarkisiaris "Stanford faked in
juries" fiasco, it is that David
Shaw got angry. Shaw is con
tinually polished and adroit as
a public figure and his reserved de
meanor is at this point meme-worthy.
It seems at times incomprehensible
that Shaw and raging 49ers head
coach Jim Harbaugh ever worked to
gether.
To a certain extent all coaches
have their own game to play. There is
no profession better suited to non
committal statements and outright
bloviating than coaching. And while
media coverage is the lifeblood of the
sports industry, most coaches would
prefer to keep the press at arm's
length. All coaches try to use the
press to further their own ends. It's
the smart thing to do.
Sarkisian probably scored points
in the Washington locker room by
taking shots at Stanford. Similarly, if
Shaw had not come out swinging
against Sarkisian the next day, it
would have been incredibly disre
spectful to his coaches and his players
moreover, it would have implied
that Sarkisian was right. Statements
need to be matched with statements
and accusations met with denials.
That is the nature of the media game.
But it's hard to believe that Stan
ford's attitude on this matter is rhet
oric for the locker room. It's still a
matter of true or false, right or
wrong. Responding angrily to accusa
tions isn't just a matter of public rela
tions. It is a matter of principle.
Let's take a look at some of Stan
ford's injuries on defense. Junior line
backer James Vaughters went down
on the first play of the second half.
Stanford was well rested, so why
would the Cardinal fake an injury,
then? Fifth-year senior defensive end
Ben Gardner was injured on the sev
enth play of a different drive late in
the game, but seven plays in is hard
ly enough to warrant stopping the
clock. It was just two minutes into the
drive and Stanford had enjoyed an of
fensive possession and the fourth
quarter break before that. Fifth-year
senior linebacker Shayne Skov took a
hit to the knee on the same drive just
seven plays later. After Gardner's
lengthy injury timeout, I doubt Stan
ford actually needed to take a break.
One would imagine that if Stan
ford were taking dives, it would have
done so later in the game, with Wash
ington riding high and after the Stan
ford offense posted two brutal three
and-outs.
Why would Stanford tell its cap
tains to take a dive? Gardner espe
cially headlined a thin, injury-ridden
defensive line and the team needed
all hands on deck. But more impor
tantly, the fact that Sarkisian thought
his offense was so good that Stanford
had to cheat to beat it boggles the
mind.
Shaw is right: Stanford beat Ore
gon last year without faking injuries.
All respect to Washington, a top-10
team in my mind, but better teams
have tried and failed to beat the Card.
This is not to say that nobody's
