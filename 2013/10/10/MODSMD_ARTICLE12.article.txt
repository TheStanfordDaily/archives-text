# CARD SNAGS TWO WINS
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
It has been quite a successful past couple of
days for the Stanford golf teams. A day after
the men scored a convincing win at the Erin
Hills Intercollegiate in Wisconsin, the women's
squad led by veterans sophomore Mariah
Stackhouse and junior Mariko Tumangan
won by an even greater margin at the Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invitational. Stackhouse also captured
the individual crown at the event, held at Sa
halee Country Club in Sammamish, Wash.
"This is our most dominant win, certainly [in
my tenure]," said head coach Anne Walker.
"Washington is a great team and will definitely
be in the mix in May. To beat them by 27
[strokes], on an extremely difficult course gives
us a ton of confidence."
The tournament was a 54-hole event played
over two days, meaning the teams had to play
36 holes on Tuesday. Though that kind of setup
can tax players' patience and endurance, the
Cardinal did an excellent job of focusing on each
individual shot.
"We had a great mindset going into [Tues
day]," Walker remarked. "We tried to look at
this 10-hour, 36 hole day, as a football game and
break it into quarters. Not every down is going
to go as planned, but you have to regroup quick
ly and play the next down well if you want to
compete. We regrouped very well, bounced
back quickly after mistakes and took opportuni
ties when they presented themselves."
For Tumangan, however, there was little ad
versity to overcome, save for the wet conditions
and a burst of hail that temporarily stopped
play. The junior from San Jose, Calif., played
bogey-free golf in the first two rounds, record
ing seven birdies to put herself alone in first
place. Stackhouse's opening day was a bit
bumpier; the sophomore had to overcome two
bogeys in the first round and a double-bogey in
the afternoon frame to finish at 6-under 138.
"It's awesome to be with another teammate at
the top of the leaderboard," Stackhouse com
mented after Tuesday's rounds. 'As a team, we
have pretty high goals and it takes all of us being
able to compete against the rest of the field and
not each other. To have a couple players on the
same team leading mid-tournament means that
we haven't lost sight of the fact that every team in
the field is capable of winning and we have to play
with the desire to come out on top as a team."
The Card certainly showed a desire not only

to win, but also to dominate. It placed four play
ers in the top-10 and had all five golfers finish in
the top-25 of the tournament's individual race.
Sophomore Lauren Kim last week's hero at
the Windy City Collegiate placed seventh with
a three-round total of 7-over 223, as did freshman
Quirine Eijkenboom. Eijkenboom, hailing from
Germany, was one of two freshmen in the Stan
ford lineup along with Casey Danielson. Though
Walker could have gone with the more tested sen
iors Danielle Frasier and Marissa Mar, the sec
ond-year head coach has chosen to continue the
youth movement on her starting five.
"They are steady," Walker said of her fresh
men. "They both have a tremendous amount of
playing experience and it shows in their game.
They fight hard, never give up and love the
competition. They are super fun to coach."
Stackhouse one year removed from her
own freshman experience collected her third
individual collegiate title, leapfrogging team
mate Tumangan in the final round with a 1-un
der 71. The sophomore from Georgia birdied
the final hole to move to 7-under for the tourna

ment, her second best combined score to par in
an NCAA event. With the win, Staekhouse has
cemented herself once again as a contender for
Pac-12 and NCAA titles come April and May.
"[Staekhouse] made some small swing ad
justments between Chicago and [Sahalee] that
allowed her to hit more accurate approach
shots, which in turn gave her more birdie oppor
tunities," Walker said of her budding superstar.
"Given the opportunity, Mariah will make a lot
of putts."
From the team perspective, Stanford
knocked off four conference opponents at
Edean Ihlanfeldt en route to the win. Much like
their male counterparts in Erin Hills, the Car
dinal women jumped out to a whopping 21-shot
lead after 36 holes, increasing the margin to 27
when play concluded yesterday.
Next up for the Cardinal is the Stanford In
tercollegiate, held at the Stanford Golf Course
Oct. 25-27.

a three-round total of 7-over 223, as did freshman
Quirine Eijkenboom. Eijkenboom, hailing from
Germany, was one of two freshmen in the Stan
ford lineup along with Casey Danielson. Though
Walker could have gone with the more tested sen
iors Danielle Frasier and Marissa Mar, the sec
ond-year head coach has chosen to continue the
youth movement on her starting five.
"They are steady," Walker said of her fresh
men. "They both have a tremendous amount of
playing experience and it shows in their game.
They fight hard, never give up and love the
competition. They are super fun to coach."
Stackhouse one year removed from her
own freshman experience collected her third
individual collegiate title, leapfrogging team
mate Tumangan in the final round with a 1-un
der 71. The sophomore from Georgia birdied
the final hole to move to 7-under for the tourna

ment, her second best combined score to par in
an NCAA event. With the win, Staekhouse has
cemented herself once again as a contender for
Pac-12 and NCAA titles come April and May.
"[Staekhouse] made some small swing ad
justments between Chicago and [Sahalee] that
allowed her to hit more accurate approach
shots, which in turn gave her more birdie oppor
tunities," Walker said of her budding superstar.
"Given the opportunity, Mariah will make a lot
of putts."
From the team perspective, Stanford
knocked off four conference opponents at
Edean Ihlanfeldt en route to the win. Much like
their male counterparts in Erin Hills, the Car
dinal women jumped out to a whopping 21-shot
lead after 36 holes, increasing the margin to 27
when play concluded yesterday.
Next up for the Cardinal is the Stanford In
tercollegiate, held at the Stanford Golf Course
Oct. 25-27.

Sophomore Mariah Stackhouse's (above) strong performances to start the season put her in
an excellent position to be a repeat contender for the Pac-12 and NCAA titles this spring.
It has been quite a successful past couple of
days for the Stanford golf teams. A day after
the men scored a convincing win at the Erin
Hills Intercollegiate in Wisconsin, the women's
squad led by veterans sophomore Mariah
Stackhouse and junior Mariko Tumangan
won by an even greater margin at the Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invitational. Stackhouse also captured
the individual crown at the event, held at Sa
halee Country Club in Sammamish, Wash.
"This is our most dominant win, certainly [in
my tenure]," said head coach Anne Walker.
"Washington is a great team and will definitely
be in the mix in May. To beat them by 27
[strokes], on an extremely difficult course gives
us a ton of confidence."
The tournament was a 54-hole event played
over two days, meaning the teams had to play
36 holes on Tuesday. Though that kind of setup
can tax players' patience and endurance, the
Cardinal did an excellent job of focusing on each
individual shot.
"We had a great mindset going into [Tues
day]," Walker remarked. "We tried to look at
this 10-hour, 36 hole day, as a football game and
break it into quarters. Not every down is going
to go as planned, but you have to regroup quick
ly and play the next down well if you want to
compete. We regrouped very well, bounced
back quickly after mistakes and took opportuni
ties when they presented themselves."
For Tumangan, however, there was little ad
versity to overcome, save for the wet conditions
and a burst of hail that temporarily stopped
play. The junior from San Jose, Calif., played
bogey-free golf in the first two rounds, record
ing seven birdies to put herself alone in first
place. Stackhouse's opening day was a bit
bumpier; the sophomore had to overcome two
bogeys in the first round and a double-bogey in
the afternoon frame to finish at 6-under 138.
"It's awesome to be with another teammate at
the top of the leaderboard," Stackhouse com
mented after Tuesday's rounds. 'As a team, we
have pretty high goals and it takes all of us being
able to compete against the rest of the field and
not each other. To have a couple players on the
same team leading mid-tournament means that
we haven't lost sight of the fact that every team in
the field is capable of winning and we have to play
with the desire to come out on top as a team."
The Card certainly showed a desire not only

to win, but also to dominate. It placed four play
ers in the top-10 and had all five golfers finish in
the top-25 of the tournament's individual race.
Sophomore Lauren Kim last week's hero at
the Windy City Collegiate placed seventh with
a three-round total of 7-over 223, as did freshman
Quirine Eijkenboom. Eijkenboom, hailing from
Germany, was one of two freshmen in the Stan
ford lineup along with Casey Danielson. Though
