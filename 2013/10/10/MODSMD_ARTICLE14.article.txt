# BRUINS POSE NEW CHALLENGE AFTER LOSS
## 
### FIONA NOONAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's and women's soccer teams
each have something to prove as both Cardinal
squads face UCLA tonight.
The women, coming off of a devastating loss to
Arizona State Sunday night, come into the game as
the underdogs for the first time this season, having
fallen to No. 5 on the NSCAA Coaches' Poll rank
ings, with the Bruins ranked second. The men, for
their part, must show that they can continue their
solid play and maintain a presence in the Pac-12
standings going up against the No. 10 Bruins.
Tonight's home match will be critical for both the
confidence and ranking of the women's team. Sun
day marked the first home loss since 2007 for the
Cardinal and the first time in 44 games that the
women have lost a conference match.
Despite the team's shock after Sunday's match,
head coach Paul Ratcliffe emphasized the impor
tance of the UCLA match in terms of moving on.
"That's the only way to get over these losses, is
to get back out on the field and play another game,"
Ratcliffe said. "I've always said, 'You're only as good
as your last performance.'"
The Cardinal (9-1-1, 2-1 Pac-12) will look to im
prove its performance against No. 2 UCLA (10-1-1,
2-0) as it attempts to restart its winning streaks and
reclaim its place atop the Pac-12 standings.
The matchup between the two powerhouses will
be intense; together the
UCLA and Stanford women
have won a share of all 12 of
the past 12 Pac-12 Champi
onships (Arizona and UCLA
split the title in 2004), and the
all-time series between the
teams is close at 12-9-3, with
Stanford holding the edge.
The Bruins, under goal
keeper Katelyn Rowland (0.34
goals-against average) have
managed eight shutouts this
season, so the Cardinal will
look to junior forward Taylor
Uhl (10 goals, 20 points) and
redshirt senior captain Court
ney Verioo (6 goals, 5 assists,
17 points) to round out the of
fensive effort. Junior forward
Chioma Übogagu (1 goal, 3 as
sists, 5 points) may also prove
critical against UCLA Last
season she scored key goals in
the regular season and Pac-12
Championship matches
against the Bruins.
Tonight, though, the Cardi
nal must forget past results
and focus on the game at hand.
"We're going to have to try
to bounce back and see what
we can do," Ratcliffe said.
The men's team also faces
a formidable challenge as it
travels to Drake Stadium in
Los Angeles. The Cardinal (6-
2-1,1-1 Pac-12) is coming off of
a 2-1 home win against Oregon
State Sunday afternoon and
will try to carry that momen
tum into tonight's match

against the Bruins (6-2-1,0-0).
According to head coach
Jeremy Gunn, the team is feel
ing good going into the game.
"We're really confident with
how we're playing at the mo
ment," Gunn said. "Through
out the season we've been real
ly consistent with the perform
ances game in and game out."
Tonight, Stanford will try
to continue that consistency
and avenge last season's pair
of losses to UCLA
Junior forward Zach Bah
teer (5 goals, 1 assist, 11
points) and star freshman for
ward Jordan Morris (3 goals, 3
assists, 9 points), with help of
sophomore midfielder Aaron
Kovar and senior midfielder
JJ Koval, will lead the offense,
while the team as a whole will
look to maintain defensive
composure against the pass
ing-oriented Bruins.
Despite being the under
dogs against UCLA the Car
dinal will continue to play its
own game.
"Going to UCLA it's a
very tough place to play,"
Gunn said. "But we've played
other teams like them this
year and done extremely well,
and so we'll just be looking for
ward and excited that it's an
other opportunity and another
challenge."
The double header will be
gin tonight at 5:30 p.m. with
the men at UCLA and end
with the women taking on the
Bruins at 7:30 p.m. at home at
Cagan Stadium.

The Stanford men's and women's soccer teams
each have something to prove as both Cardinal
squads face UCLA tonight.
The women, coming off of a devastating loss to
Arizona State Sunday night, come into the game as
the underdogs for the first time this season, having
fallen to No. 5 on the NSCAA Coaches' Poll rank
ings, with the Bruins ranked second. The men, for
their part, must show that they can continue their
solid play and maintain a presence in the Pac-12
standings going up against the No. 10 Bruins.
Tonight's home match will be critical for both the
confidence and ranking of the women's team. Sun
day marked the first home loss since 2007 for the
Cardinal and the first time in 44 games that the
women have lost a conference match.
Despite the team's shock after Sunday's match,
head coach Paul Ratcliffe emphasized the impor
tance of the UCLA match in terms of moving on.
"That's the only way to get over these losses, is
to get back out on the field and play another game,"
Ratcliffe said. "I've always said, 'You're only as good
as your last performance.'"
The Cardinal (9-1-1, 2-1 Pac-12) will look to im
prove its performance against No. 2 UCLA (10-1-1,
2-0) as it attempts to restart its winning streaks and
reclaim its place atop the Pac-12 standings.
The matchup between the two powerhouses will
be intense; together the
UCLA and Stanford women
have won a share of all 12 of
the past 12 Pac-12 Champi
onships (Arizona and UCLA
split the title in 2004), and the
all-time series between the
teams is close at 12-9-3, with
Stanford holding the edge.
The Bruins, under goal
keeper Katelyn Rowland (0.34
goals-against average) have
managed eight shutouts this
season, so the Cardinal will
look to junior forward Taylor
Uhl (10 goals, 20 points) and
redshirt senior captain Court
ney Verioo (6 goals, 5 assists,
17 points) to round out the of
fensive effort. Junior forward
Chioma Übogagu (1 goal, 3 as
sists, 5 points) may also prove
critical against UCLA Last
season she scored key goals in
the regular season and Pac-12
Championship matches
against the Bruins.
Tonight, though, the Cardi
nal must forget past results
and focus on the game at hand.
"We're going to have to try
to bounce back and see what
we can do," Ratcliffe said.
The men's team also faces
a formidable challenge as it
travels to Drake Stadium in
Los Angeles. The Cardinal (6-
2-1,1-1 Pac-12) is coming off of
a 2-1 home win against Oregon
State Sunday afternoon and
will try to carry that momen
tum into tonight's match

against the Bruins (6-2-1,0-0).
According to head coach
Jeremy Gunn, the team is feel
ing good going into the game.
"We're really confident with
how we're playing at the mo
ment," Gunn said. "Through
out the season we've been real
ly consistent with the perform
ances game in and game out."
Tonight, Stanford will try
to continue that consistency
and avenge last season's pair
of losses to UCLA
Junior forward Zach Bah
teer (5 goals, 1 assist, 11
points) and star freshman for
ward Jordan Morris (3 goals, 3
assists, 9 points), with help of
sophomore midfielder Aaron
Kovar and senior midfielder
JJ Koval, will lead the offense,
while the team as a whole will
look to maintain defensive
composure against the pass
ing-oriented Bruins.
Despite being the under
dogs against UCLA the Car
dinal will continue to play its
own game.
"Going to UCLA it's a
very tough place to play,"
Gunn said. "But we've played
other teams like them this
year and done extremely well,
and so we'll just be looking for
ward and excited that it's an
other opportunity and another
challenge."
The double header will be
gin tonight at 5:30 p.m. with
the men at UCLA and end
with the women taking on the
Bruins at 7:30 p.m. at home at
Cagan Stadium.
