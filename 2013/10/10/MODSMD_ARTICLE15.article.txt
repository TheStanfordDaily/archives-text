# FOOTBALL NOTES
## Moving past fake injury allegations 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Just hours after calling out Washington
head coach Steve Sarkisian for suggesting
that his team was faking injuries to slow
down the Huskies' offense, Stanford head
football coach David Shaw spoke to the me
dia once again, following the conclusion of
Tuesday's practice.
Unlike in the press conference earlier in
the day, where he began with an impromptu
opening statement addressing Sarkisian's
allegations, Shaw chose to look ahead to
Saturday's game against Utah, touching on
key injury situations as well as his plan for
keeping the Cardinal mentally and physical
ly fresh through the long grind of Pac-12
play.
Shaw first provided an update on the
status of team captains and fifth-year sen
iors, defensive end Ben Gardner and inside
linebacker Shayne Skov, whose arm and
knee injuries, respectively, in last week's
game sparked Sarkisian's now infamous
claims.
"[Gardner was] better today," Shaw said.
"We rotated him in and out a bit. He didn't
practice the whole practice, but it's feeling
better. Shayne [Skov] was good today. We
took some reps off of him and thankfully
[sophomore inside linebacker] Blake Mar
tinez was able to come up and take some
reps."
A more pressing injury concern for the
Cardinal heading into its showdown on the
road against the Utes is the status of senior
defensive tackle David Parry. According to
Shaw, Parry is currently dealing with a low
er abdominal injury and was unable to par
ticipate completely in practice. With sopho
more defensive tackle Ikenna Nwafor still
out for several weeks, Stanford may have to
dig deep into the depth chart if Parry is un
able to play on Saturday.
In other injury-related news, senior de
fensive end Henry Anderson is now off
crutches as he continues to recover from a
leg injury suffered against Army. Anderson
is not expected to return for another three
to four weeks.
In addition, Shaw also addressed fifth
year senior fullback Ryan Hewitt's lack of
production so far this season. In the final
five games of last season, when Kevin
Hogan took over as the starting quarter
back, Hewitt's numbers skyrocketed with
11 receptions for 110 yards and a touch
down. In the first five games of 2013, howev-
er, Hewitt has only two re
ceptions for three yards.
Shaw pinpointed this drop in
production to improved de
fensive schemes, but never
theless expressed confidence
that Hewitt will emerge at
some point this season.
"He's one of those guys
who we try to game-plan for.
And sometimes the plays get
called and sometimes they
don't and sometimes the
plays get called and he's cov
ered," Shaw said. "I thought
when we called a quick play
action pass down in the red
zone, I thought for sure he
was going to sneak out in the
flat and get a touchdown, but
Washington did a great job
covering him. Hopefully,
we'll get him going at some
point during the season."

Saturday's game in Salt
Lake City takes on an addi
tional level of significance for
sophomore quarterback Dal
las Lloyd, a native of Pleas
ant Grove, Utah, and a life
long Utes fan.
"BYU, Utah, and Utah
State football were every
thing to us... I always
dreamed of playing in
[Utah's] Rice-Eccles [Stadi
um] in front of all those fans
and the crazy atmosphere,
but growing up I didn't think
I'd be playing for Stanford,"

Lloyd said. "This has been a
fun week so far. There's a lit
tle extra passion in my
heart."
Now Lloyd, who runs the
same "change-of-pace" pack
age that Hogan operated at
the beginning of last season,
will get an opportunity to live

out his childhood dream, but
wearing a slightly different
shade of red Cardinal, not
Crimson when Stanford
visits Utah Saturday at 3
p.m.

field action in his first year as backup quarterback, but it's
the game against his home state of Utah that matters most.
