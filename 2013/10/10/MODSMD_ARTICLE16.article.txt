## Bitcoin After Silk Road 
### Omar Diab 
"T ~jr Then the FBI shuttered Silk
\/\ / Road, a popular Bitcoin-
V V backed online black mar
ket, the value of Bitcoin fell from
over $l4l to below $llO. Nonethe
less, the end of Silk Road represents
a turning point people will inno
vate to make Bitcoin more robust
and decentralized than it ever has
been.
In particular, Bitcoin threatens
to redefine the concept of currency
as we know it, and the aftermath of
Silk Road's fall proves it.
Other popular illicit market
places shut down after Silk Road's
demise, and the FBI caught several
Silk Road drug dealers. Many prior
users are paranoid of trusting new
marketplaces, thinking they may
just be DEA honeypots and that the
NSA may have already cracked en
cryption technologies like PGR ren
dering online anonymity futile.
Some speculate that Bitcoin, an
anonymous digital currency intro
duced at the start of 2009, will have
trouble rebounding from the loss of
its biggest illegal marketplace.
Some even believe that Silk Road's
collapse will accelerate the regula
tion of Bitcoin because it reveals
how the currency's anonymity en
courages tax evasion.
That couldn't be further from the
case. People already see Bitcoin as a
currency whose domain extends be
yond the black market. Drug sales
account for only about half a percent
of all Bitcoin transactions, and some
brick and mortar stores, like the for
ward-thinking Coupa Cafe in Palo
Alto, now accept Bitcoin.
Silk Road's fall made it clear that
for Bitcoin to become truly anony
mous, transactions need to be de
centralized and untraceable. If that
goal becomes a reality, Bitcoin can
change the way governments and
currencies work forever.
Some have already proposed
new marketplace structures to
counter Silk Road's failures. Its
centralized nature likely caused its
eventual failure (along with Silk
Road founder Ross Ulbricht's
carelessness), causing ideas like a
"federated distributed social net
work" for Bitcoin trade to top start
up incubator Y-Combinator's news
website.
Others are tackling deficiencies
in Bitcoin itself by building more
layers of privacy. Because Bitcoin
transactions are public, some doubt
the anonymity of Bitcoin transac
tions. In order to obscure the flow of
Bitcoin, people often run Bitcoins
through Bitcoin tumblers. Tumblers
hide the true origin of your money
by replacing your Bitcoins with a
mixture of random Bitcoins with dif
ferent transaction histories.
Silk Road used its own central
ized tumbler, making it useless for
privacy when it got compromised.

Therefore, new systems like Zero
coin hope to ensure decentralized,
untrackable Bitcoin transactions.
All signs point to the acceleration
of Bitcoin becoming a truly untrace
able currency.
Silk Road served not just as a
black market, but also as a massive
social experiment. It helped people
explore the benefits of having a
crowd-regulated drug market. Silk
Road's robust reviewing system and
security features made it a prime
place to buy substances with confi
dence in their purity. Many active
Silk Road users heralded the serv
ice as a leader of safe drug use be
cause the illegality of drugs pre
vents their regulation. It is impossi
ble to distinguish between what
street dealers claim they sell and
their actual products, but by allow
ing online dealers to establish trust
while maintaining anonymity, buy
ers could purchase and consume
drugs more safely.
Silk Road also prompted people
to discover the important features of
anonymous marketplaces in gener
al. In its wake, many are working to
correct flaws in Silk Road and Bit
coin's designs.
Inevitably, a more robust system
will rise to meet the needs of the
public. In the midst of the recent
NSA fiasco, ever-shifting drug le
gality and financial turmoil in the
wake of the recent U.S. government
shutdown, Bitcoin has a chance to
fundamentally change the way cur
rency works.
By being government-independ
ent, difficult to track and decentral
izable, Bitcoin threatens to reduce
trade to the mere exchange of data,
making currency as unregulatable
as MP3s.
Silk Road's demise closely re
sembles the shutdown of pre-emi
nent Bit Torrent piracy site, Oink's
Pink Palace (OiNK). In OiNK's
wake, a slew of alternatives arose,
growing well beyond OiNK's origi
nal size. One such site, what.cd, even
implemented an open-source Bit-
Torrent tracker that anyone can use
to make a torrent site, showing just
how difficult it is for governments to
control how people use the web.
Bit Torrent is reducing digital
media to the exchange of data. Bit
coin is abstracting away the ex
change of money, and in the same
vein, emerging 3D printing technol
ogy may represent the digitization
and eventual piracy of physical
goods.
Where Silk Road fell, the Bitcoin
market is split wide open for innova
tion, growth and rebirth. Whatever
happens, the times, they are a
changin', and count me excited to
see what's on the horizon.

anonymous digital currency intro
duced at the start of 2009, will have
trouble rebounding from the loss of
its biggest illegal marketplace.
Some even believe that Silk Road's
collapse will accelerate the regula
tion of Bitcoin because it reveals
how the currency's anonymity en
courages tax evasion.
That couldn't be further from the
case. People already see Bitcoin as a
currency whose domain extends be
yond the black market. Drug sales
account for only about half a percent
of all Bitcoin transactions, and some
brick and mortar stores, like the for
ward-thinking Coupa Cafe in Palo
Alto, now accept Bitcoin.
Silk Road's fall made it clear that
for Bitcoin to become truly anony
mous, transactions need to be de
centralized and untraceable. If that
goal becomes a reality, Bitcoin can
change the way governments and
currencies work forever.
Some have already proposed
new marketplace structures to
counter Silk Road's failures. Its
centralized nature likely caused its
eventual failure (along with Silk
Road founder Ross Ulbricht's
carelessness), causing ideas like a
"federated distributed social net
work" for Bitcoin trade to top start
up incubator Y-Combinator's news
website.
Others are tackling deficiencies
in Bitcoin itself by building more
layers of privacy. Because Bitcoin
transactions are public, some doubt
the anonymity of Bitcoin transac
tions. In order to obscure the flow of
Bitcoin, people often run Bitcoins
through Bitcoin tumblers. Tumblers
hide the true origin of your money
by replacing your Bitcoins with a
mixture of random Bitcoins with dif
ferent transaction histories.
Silk Road used its own central
ized tumbler, making it useless for
privacy when it got compromised.

Therefore, new systems like Zero
coin hope to ensure decentralized,
untrackable Bitcoin transactions.
All signs point to the acceleration
of Bitcoin becoming a truly untrace
able currency.
Silk Road served not just as a
black market, but also as a massive
social experiment. It helped people
explore the benefits of having a
crowd-regulated drug market. Silk
Road's robust reviewing system and
security features made it a prime
place to buy substances with confi
dence in their purity. Many active
Silk Road users heralded the serv
ice as a leader of safe drug use be
cause the illegality of drugs pre
vents their regulation. It is impossi
ble to distinguish between what
street dealers claim they sell and
their actual products, but by allow
ing online dealers to establish trust
while maintaining anonymity, buy
ers could purchase and consume
drugs more safely.
Silk Road also prompted people
to discover the important features of
anonymous marketplaces in gener
al. In its wake, many are working to
correct flaws in Silk Road and Bit
coin's designs.
Inevitably, a more robust system
will rise to meet the needs of the
public. In the midst of the recent
NSA fiasco, ever-shifting drug le
gality and financial turmoil in the
wake of the recent U.S. government
shutdown, Bitcoin has a chance to
fundamentally change the way cur
rency works.
By being government-independ
ent, difficult to track and decentral
izable, Bitcoin threatens to reduce
trade to the mere exchange of data,
making currency as unregulatable
as MP3s.
Silk Road's demise closely re
sembles the shutdown of pre-emi
nent Bit Torrent piracy site, Oink's
Pink Palace (OiNK). In OiNK's
wake, a slew of alternatives arose,
growing well beyond OiNK's origi
nal size. One such site, what.cd, even
implemented an open-source Bit-
Torrent tracker that anyone can use
to make a torrent site, showing just
how difficult it is for governments to
control how people use the web.
Bit Torrent is reducing digital
media to the exchange of data. Bit
coin is abstracting away the ex
change of money, and in the same
vein, emerging 3D printing technol
ogy may represent the digitization
and eventual piracy of physical
goods.
Where Silk Road fell, the Bitcoin
market is split wide open for innova
tion, growth and rebirth. Whatever
happens, the times, they are a
changin', and count me excited to
see what's on the horizon.
