# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,

The issues raised by Alii Rath
("We Can Do Better for the
Arts," Oct. 2, 2013) should
concern all of us who believe that
the arts have an indispensable role
to play in a Stanford education. As
the editorial points out, there have
been numerous instances where
demand for slots in applied classes
especially in studio art out
strips supply. The problem that
Rath describes with respect both
to Art and to Music has to do not
only with an insufficient number of
instructors to meet the need for
such classes, but also with a lack of
adequate space. The chairs of the
arts departments and the deans in
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences have been aware of this
problem for some time and have
been taking various steps to ad
dress it. There is progress to report
on both fronts.
On the space front, the Mc-
Murtry Building, due to open in
2015, will allow the Department of
Art and Art History to make better
use of studio classrooms thanks to
increased storage space. In Music,
the piano studio ("Small and
cramped, resulting in a room
crammed with pianos to the point
of poor acoustics," according to
Rath) has recently received a sub
stantial upgrade. This past summer
the department replaced all of the
studio's pianos (a motley collection
of worn-out, retirement-ready in
struments) with brand new Yama
ha NU-1 pianos. These space-sav
ing hybrid instruments combine
mechanical acoustic piano action
with digital sound production, sub
stantially improving the classroom
experience. Students can now learn
the mechanics required to play a
traditional acoustic piano (in differ
ent historical temperaments, if

they so wish), while listening
through headphones. The faculty
who tested the pianos last year
raved about them.
It's important to recognize how
all the new buildings function in
various ways as teaching and learn
ing spaces. With Bing Concert
Hall, for example, we now have a
facility to teach large ensemble
performance properly. Hundreds of
students, whether in the Symphony
Orchestra, the Jazz Orchestra and
Early Music Singers, or in student
groups such as Talisman, Fleet
Street Singers and Mariachi Car
denal, have benefitted from this ex
pansion of music performance
space.
On the instructor front, there
has been a VPUE-supported initia
tive to offer additional arts cours
es, such as Internet Art, Cell
Phone Photography and Sound
and Image, designed specifically
to address the new Creative Ex
pression requirement. Not only
has the piano studio been upgrad
ed, the class piano instructor posi
tion has been converted from half
time to full-time, and capacity in
voice lessons has been increased,
specifically to reduce the waitlist
that the department has had each
quarter. In addition, the curricu
lum has been expanded to offer
private instruction in rock guitar
and rock drums, a Baroque
Soloists string ensemble and a Chi
nese Music Ensemble.
Alii Rath no doubt speaks for
many students and faculty in ex
pressing the view that we can do
better in the arts. Stanford is in
deed committed to doing so, as I
hope the above examples illustrate.
