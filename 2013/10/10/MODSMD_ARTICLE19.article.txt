Space entrepreneurship is hard.
Good ideas can be hard to
come by and discovering one
often requires a deep knowledge of
the field. Huge upfront costs and
long lead times before real return
on investment has often left space
the realm of governments and the
extremely rich. But thanks to
emerging companies, unique busi
ness models and developing tech
nology, these obstacles are eroding.
And the Stanford Student Space
Initiative is capitalizing on this new
environment to show students how
they can make a difference.
Examples of this changing envi
ronment are all around us. The re
cent success of SpaceX's new Fal
con 9 gives tremendous credibility
to the company's promise of lower
cost paths to orbit. The explosion of
cubesats, small satellites with stan
dardized dimensions that fly as sec
ondary payloads, has created a low
cost means of getting hardware to
orbit; this has allowed 50-person
companies like Planet Labs to put
up dozens of satellites at a time for
a few hundred thousand dollars to
accomplish tasks that previously
would have cost billions.
The growing number of low cost,
space-based platforms being
launched to the International Space
Station brings the promise of open
ing up space experiments and man
ufacturing to everyone. As just one
example, Made In Space, a 15-per
son company based at the NASA
Ames Research Park, is on track to
send a 3D printer to the ISS this

summer and give people the oppor
tunity to create their own products
in orbit for extremely low cost.
These developments have fos
tered tremendous public excite
ment and involvement, which has
become critical to the survival of
this industry. Virgin Galactic has
overcome hardships and delays in
its quest to revolutionize space
tourism because of the dedication
of their customers. SpaceX, Plane
tary Resources and most space
startups rely on talented student
interns to help them accomplish
their ambitious goals with limited
budgets and small teams. Even well
established agencies like NASA
will depend on a new generation of
visionaries to push our nation's
space program in the right direc
tion, as the majority of their em
ployees near retirement.
Recognizing both this growing
need and burgeoning opportunity,
Stanford students are coming to
gether to make a difference through
the Stanford Student Space Initia
tive (SSI). Aiming to both promote
space entrepreneurship and build a
stronger space community SSI
shows students how they can get in
volved, educate them on the pain
points in the industry and provide
them with the network and re
sources to pursue their ideas.
Bolstered by huge support from
alumni, local companies and profes
sors, SSI helps students get hands
on experience with real aerospace
hardware and holds recruiting
events to help these students find

internships; for example, the group
brought SpaceX President Gwynne
Shotwell to Stanford on Sept. 30.
Going further, SSI also pushes stu
dents to develop their own ideas
through ideation sessions and start
up events like the New Space Busi
ness Plan Conference, which SSI is
hosting at Stanford on Oct. 24 in
partnership with the Space Frontier
Foundation and NASA.
Our ventures in space have al
ways embodied the human desire to
learn and explore. The spectacular
Apollo missions continue to inspire
generations to dream big and liter
ally reach for the stars, including
Elon Musk, whose dream of going
to Mars has inspired thousands.
Dozens of nations are creating
and expanding their space pro
grams in the name of science. Cu
riosity's findings on Mars continue
to make headlines and jumpstart
discussions about life beyond Earth.
The excitement of all these incredi
ble projects and new space discov
eries is tangible. It's only been a few
months since SSI was recognized as
an official student group, but it's al
ready grown to hundreds of mem
bers.
Ultimately, SSI believes that we
are approaching a transformative
time where anyone who wants to go
to space will actually be able. All it
takes to get there is showing people
how they can make it happen and
providing them the tools to do so.

Space entrepreneurship is hard.
Good ideas can be hard to
come by and discovering one
often requires a deep knowledge of
the field. Huge upfront costs and
long lead times before real return
on investment has often left space
the realm of governments and the
extremely rich. But thanks to
emerging companies, unique busi
ness models and developing tech
nology, these obstacles are eroding.
And the Stanford Student Space
Initiative is capitalizing on this new
environment to show students how
they can make a difference.
Examples of this changing envi
ronment are all around us. The re
cent success of SpaceX's new Fal
con 9 gives tremendous credibility
to the company's promise of lower
cost paths to orbit. The explosion of
cubesats, small satellites with stan
dardized dimensions that fly as sec
ondary payloads, has created a low
cost means of getting hardware to
orbit; this has allowed 50-person
companies like Planet Labs to put
up dozens of satellites at a time for
a few hundred thousand dollars to
accomplish tasks that previously
would have cost billions.
The growing number of low cost,
space-based platforms being
launched to the International Space
Station brings the promise of open
ing up space experiments and man
ufacturing to everyone. As just one
example, Made In Space, a 15-per
son company based at the NASA
Ames Research Park, is on track to
send a 3D printer to the ISS this

summer and give people the oppor
tunity to create their own products
in orbit for extremely low cost.
These developments have fos
tered tremendous public excite
ment and involvement, which has
become critical to the survival of
this industry. Virgin Galactic has
overcome hardships and delays in
its quest to revolutionize space
tourism because of the dedication
of their customers. SpaceX, Plane
tary Resources and most space
startups rely on talented student
interns to help them accomplish
their ambitious goals with limited
budgets and small teams. Even well
established agencies like NASA
will depend on a new generation of
visionaries to push our nation's
space program in the right direc
tion, as the majority of their em
ployees near retirement.
Recognizing both this growing
need and burgeoning opportunity,
Stanford students are coming to
gether to make a difference through
the Stanford Student Space Initia
tive (SSI). Aiming to both promote
space entrepreneurship and build a
stronger space community SSI
shows students how they can get in
volved, educate them on the pain
points in the industry and provide
them with the network and re
sources to pursue their ideas.
Bolstered by huge support from
alumni, local companies and profes
sors, SSI helps students get hands
on experience with real aerospace
hardware and holds recruiting
events to help these students find

internships; for example, the group
brought SpaceX President Gwynne
Shotwell to Stanford on Sept. 30.
Going further, SSI also pushes stu
dents to develop their own ideas
through ideation sessions and start
up events like the New Space Busi
ness Plan Conference, which SSI is
hosting at Stanford on Oct. 24 in
partnership with the Space Frontier
Foundation and NASA.
Our ventures in space have al
ways embodied the human desire to
learn and explore. The spectacular
Apollo missions continue to inspire
generations to dream big and liter
ally reach for the stars, including
Elon Musk, whose dream of going
to Mars has inspired thousands.
Dozens of nations are creating
and expanding their space pro
grams in the name of science. Cu
riosity's findings on Mars continue
to make headlines and jumpstart
discussions about life beyond Earth.
The excitement of all these incredi
ble projects and new space discov
eries is tangible. It's only been a few
months since SSI was recognized as
an official student group, but it's al
ready grown to hundreds of mem
bers.
Ultimately, SSI believes that we
are approaching a transformative
time where anyone who wants to go
to space will actually be able. All it
takes to get there is showing people
how they can make it happen and
providing them the tools to do so.
