						LOOK INSIDE LANCASTER, TARPLEY AND SKOV LEAD DOMINANT CARD DEFENSE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA SAM FISHER 
There's just something
special about Stanford's
inside linebackers. For
one, a unit that consists
of four seniors prides it
self on special teams, of all things
and Stanford's eye-blacked, mo
hawked Sports Illustrated cover boy
is no exception.
"We think of ourselves as kind of
like the Marines of special teams,"
said fifth-year senior captain
Shayne Skov. "You kind of just plug
and put us in where you need us, and
we can do it all."
Nowhere is that more apparent
than on the punt team, where long
snapper Reed Miller is flanked by
the entire inside linebacker two
deep: Joe Hemschoot and Skov on
his left, A. J. Tarpley and Jarek Lan
caster on his right. Even though
Skov, Tarpley and Lancaster have
combined for 572 tackles, 541/2 tack
les for loss and 23 sacks over their
careers, it's Hemschoot, the least
recognizable name of the bunch, who
Skov calls the Cardinal's most fero
cious hitter.
But special teams are just the tip
of the iceberg. What makes the in
side linebackers truly unique is that
their collective role changes dramat
ically every week and that then*
individual roles have taken a roller
coaster ride of their own over the
last two years.
To the first point, the inside line
backers have to adjust more than

anyone to the bevy of different of
fenses that Stanford faces. One
game, they'll be clogging up the mid
dle against a team like Army, which
runs the ball over 80 percent of the
time; two weeks later, they'll have to
cover speedy slot receivers like
those at Washington State, whose
starting pass catchers are an aver
age 5-foot-ll in height and 184
pounds in weight; the next week,
they'll be tasked with defending
Washington tight end Austin Sefer
ian- Jenkins, a Mackey Award fron
trunner who towers over the field at
6-foot-6,276 pounds.
So how do the Cardinal's inside
linebackers fly to the ball so consis
tently when their assignment more
or less resets every week? According
to Tarpley, the first key is footwork;
one bad step is all a read-option team
needs to gash a defense. Even when
the inside linebackers are in the
right position to play either the run
or the pass, they still have to fight a
mental battle as well.
'A game like Washington State,
you don't want it to frustrate you,"
Tarpley said, referencing the game
when he and Skov combined for just
eight tackles against the Cougars'
bubble screens. "Everyone is going
to have a hard down."
The unit's speed is perhaps the
biggest game-changer against the
Pac-12's spread offenses, as it gives
the linebackers the ability to run
down playmakers behind the line of
scrimmage multiple times a game.

in the 2011 season and, after missing two seasons, is finally back to
his 2010 form, tackling for losses and beating offenses to the edge.
