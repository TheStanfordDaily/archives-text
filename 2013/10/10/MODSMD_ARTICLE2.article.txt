## A 						LOOK INSIDE LANCASTER, TARPLEY AND SKOV LEAD DOMINANT CARD DEFENSE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA SAM FISHER 
There's just something
special about Stanford's
inside linebackers. For
one, a unit that consists
of four seniors prides it
self on special teams, of all things
and Stanford's eye-blacked, mo
hawked Sports Illustrated cover boy
is no exception.
"We think of ourselves as kind of
like the Marines of special teams,"
said fifth-year senior captain
Shayne Skov. "You kind of just plug
and put us in where you need us, and
we can do it all."
Nowhere is that more apparent
than on the punt team, where long
snapper Reed Miller is flanked by
the entire inside linebacker two
deep: Joe Hemschoot and Skov on
his left, A. J. Tarpley and Jarek Lan
caster on his right. Even though
Skov, Tarpley and Lancaster have
combined for 572 tackles, 541/2 tack
les for loss and 23 sacks over their
careers, it's Hemschoot, the least
recognizable name of the bunch, who
Skov calls the Cardinal's most fero
cious hitter.
But special teams are just the tip
of the iceberg. What makes the in
side linebackers truly unique is that
their collective role changes dramat
ically every week and that then*
individual roles have taken a roller
coaster ride of their own over the
last two years.
To the first point, the inside line
backers have to adjust more than

anyone to the bevy of different of
fenses that Stanford faces. One
game, they'll be clogging up the mid
dle against a team like Army, which
runs the ball over 80 percent of the
time; two weeks later, they'll have to
cover speedy slot receivers like
those at Washington State, whose
starting pass catchers are an aver
age 5-foot-ll in height and 184
pounds in weight; the next week,
they'll be tasked with defending
Washington tight end Austin Sefer
ian- Jenkins, a Mackey Award fron
trunner who towers over the field at
6-foot-6,276 pounds.
So how do the Cardinal's inside
linebackers fly to the ball so consis
tently when their assignment more
or less resets every week? According
to Tarpley, the first key is footwork;
one bad step is all a read-option team
needs to gash a defense. Even when
the inside linebackers are in the
right position to play either the run
or the pass, they still have to fight a
mental battle as well.
'A game like Washington State,
you don't want it to frustrate you,"
Tarpley said, referencing the game
when he and Skov combined for just
eight tackles against the Cougars'
bubble screens. "Everyone is going
to have a hard down."
The unit's speed is perhaps the
biggest game-changer against the
Pac-12's spread offenses, as it gives
the linebackers the ability to run
down playmakers behind the line of
scrimmage multiple times a game.

SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
Fifth-year senior captain Shayne Skov (left) tore his ACL and MCL early
in the 2011 season and, after missing two seasons, is finally back to
his 2010 form, tackling for losses and beating offenses to the edge.
Kotulski noted, though Skov
and Tarpley combined for just
two tackles for a loss against
Washington State, both of
them came on pass plays.
"It kind of shows the ath
letic ability that they have, go
ing out and covering wide re
ceivers or tackling guys," Ko
tulski said. "I think both of
them have an understanding
of how they fit, so as different
offenses present different
problems, they have a great
understanding of how they
work together."
That understanding ex
tends beyond just the
starters. Though sophomore
Blake Martinez started the
year as a second-stringer, af
ter he suffered an injury in
practice early in the season,
the entire two-deep at the po
sition has been made up of
seniors.
"I think it's interesting;
just operating in an environ
ment where any time some
body makes a mistake, they

immediately know what hap
pened," Skov said of the
group's experience. "You're
not arguing about what it's
like on paper; you're arguing
about what the intricacies are
—why you did this and why I
was wrong."
Getting to that point, how
ever, has been anything but
easy. It all started two sea
sons ago, when Skov, the
team's leading tackier as a
sophomore in 2010, tore his
ACL and MCL in the third
game of the 2011 season. That
thrust Lancaster and Tarpley
into action.
"I think our eyes were a
little wide," Lancaster re
membered. "We had some
saucers for eyes, especially
having to fill in for Shayne
Skov, you know, giant shoes to
fill, and we'd never both been
in that position. So we both
kind of rallied with each oth
er."
As Skov nursed his injury
and provided guidance for his
replacements, the duo pushed
each other to improve, com
peting for playing time. Both
of them shined in big mo
ments; Tarpley recovered the
game-winning fumble in

triple-overtime at USC, while
Lancaster went on to lead the
team with 70 tackles that
year.

"I think [Tarpley] is the
smartest linebacker in our
core," Skov added. "[He] just
has an all-around expansive
knowledge, surpasses my
knowledge of the defense
probably at this point."
Add to that Tarpley's pen
chant for pass coverage he
has now picked off elite Pac
-12 quarterbacks Matt
Barkley, Marcus Mariota and
Keith Price in consecutive
seasons; the Cardinal is set up
as well as anyone in the coun
try at inside linebacker. The
replacement has become the
partner in crime and all is
well.
Except for one thing:
Where is Lancaster?
Take a wild guess.
"Special teams is my call
ing here," he said.
It might seem like a bit of
a demotion for a guy who, af
ter all, led the team in tackles
just two seasons ago. But as
the defensive playing time be
came more and more scarce
over the last season and a
half, Lancaster began to see
things differently.
"Since redshirt freshman
year, I've been on all four spe
cial teams," Lancaster re
flected. "It's just a part of
what kind of player I am.
High-motor guy, I love to hit,
I love to do whatever the
team needs me to do."
"Jarek, who did an incred
ible job two years ago, [is an]
explosive guy," Skov said. "I
think probably the most fluid
out of all of us. And I think
just, also, given the situation
that he's been in, starting and
not stalling, [he's] just an in
credible teammate."
"I've done every role that
you could possibly ask me to
do," Lancaster said, "and I
love it. I just like being in the
locker room with the guys,
and if coach says, 'Hey, listen,
if this week I need you to do
this,' well, then that's what
I'm going to do."

The following offseason,
Lancaster and Tarpley would
be competing once again, this
time to determine who would
play alongside Skov for the
2012 season. Tarpley gained a
slight edge in the battle be
cause of his ability to read op
posing offenses and slip by
linemen, Lancaster admits,
and that earned him the
starting job. But Skov was
impressed by both of his for
mer replacements.
"I started essentially the
first three seasons of my ca
reer, and I didn't know if I
was going to start last year,"
Skov said. "That's a testa
ment to, within that one sea
son, how much guys had
grown and what they'd done."
Skov did end up starting
in 2012, but he wasn't the
same player who had gone off
on Virginia Tech for 12 tack
les and three sacks in the
2011 Orange Bowl. Though
he continued to be the team's
vocal and emotional leader,
his explosiveness on the field
wasn't yet back.
"We knew what he could
do, you know, what he was
still getting better at," Tarp
ley said. "He was obviously
still a great player for us. It
wasn't like he was a liability."
After another year of heal
ing, Skov finally is back to his
2010 form. He's able to beat
offensive playmakers to the
edge again; Lancaster pin
points it to that tackle for loss
against Washington State,
when Skov met Cougar run
ning back Marcus Mason just
after he caught a checkdown
pass in the backfield.
But don't be so quick to
tab him as the No. 1 guy.
"I'm not going to sit here
and take a back seat to [Skov]
in any way," Tarpley said.
"And he knows that."
To the untrained eye, Skov
and Tarpley look more and
more like each other every
game; they share the physi
cality and the war-painted
eye black, after all. Kotulski
can still identify some differ
ences, however.
"[Tarpley] is like that good
running back that can put his
foot in the ground, make
somebody miss, come on back
and do it again. And Shayne's
probably more of that big tail
back that's going to pound
you and hit you," Kotulksi
said. "So one's a little shiftier,
but they both have toughness
and athletic ability."

and Stanford's eye-blacked, mo
hawked Sports Illustrated cover boy
is no exception.
"We think of ourselves as kind of
like the Marines of special teams,"
said fifth-year senior captain
Shayne Skov. "You kind of just plug
and put us in where you need us, and
we can do it all."
Nowhere is that more apparent
than on the punt team, where long
snapper Reed Miller is flanked by
the entire inside linebacker two
deep: Joe Hemschoot and Skov on
his left, A. J. Tarpley and Jarek Lan
caster on his right. Even though
Skov, Tarpley and Lancaster have
combined for 572 tackles, 541/2 tack
les for loss and 23 sacks over their
careers, it's Hemschoot, the least
recognizable name of the bunch, who
Skov calls the Cardinal's most fero
cious hitter.
But special teams are just the tip
of the iceberg. What makes the in
side linebackers truly unique is that
their collective role changes dramat
ically every week and that then*
individual roles have taken a roller
coaster ride of their own over the
last two years.
To the first point, the inside line
backers have to adjust more than

anyone to the bevy of different of
fenses that Stanford faces. One
game, they'll be clogging up the mid
dle against a team like Army, which
runs the ball over 80 percent of the
time; two weeks later, they'll have to
cover speedy slot receivers like
those at Washington State, whose
starting pass catchers are an aver
age 5-foot-ll in height and 184
pounds in weight; the next week,
they'll be tasked with defending
Washington tight end Austin Sefer
ian- Jenkins, a Mackey Award fron
trunner who towers over the field at
6-foot-6,276 pounds.
So how do the Cardinal's inside
linebackers fly to the ball so consis
tently when their assignment more
or less resets every week? According
to Tarpley, the first key is footwork;
one bad step is all a read-option team
needs to gash a defense. Even when
the inside linebackers are in the
right position to play either the run
or the pass, they still have to fight a
mental battle as well.
'A game like Washington State,
you don't want it to frustrate you,"
Tarpley said, referencing the game
when he and Skov combined for just
eight tackles against the Cougars'
bubble screens. "Everyone is going
to have a hard down."
The unit's speed is perhaps the
biggest game-changer against the
Pac-12's spread offenses, as it gives
the linebackers the ability to run
down playmakers behind the line of
scrimmage multiple times a game.

SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
Fifth-year senior captain Shayne Skov (left) tore his ACL and MCL early
in the 2011 season and, after missing two seasons, is finally back to
his 2010 form, tackling for losses and beating offenses to the edge.
Kotulski noted, though Skov
and Tarpley combined for just
two tackles for a loss against
Washington State, both of
them came on pass plays.
"It kind of shows the ath
letic ability that they have, go
ing out and covering wide re
ceivers or tackling guys," Ko
tulski said. "I think both of
them have an understanding
of how they fit, so as different
offenses present different
problems, they have a great
understanding of how they
work together."
That understanding ex
tends beyond just the
starters. Though sophomore
Blake Martinez started the
year as a second-stringer, af
ter he suffered an injury in
practice early in the season,
the entire two-deep at the po
sition has been made up of
seniors.
"I think it's interesting;
just operating in an environ
ment where any time some
body makes a mistake, they

immediately know what hap
pened," Skov said of the
group's experience. "You're
not arguing about what it's
like on paper; you're arguing
about what the intricacies are
—why you did this and why I
was wrong."
Getting to that point, how
ever, has been anything but
easy. It all started two sea
sons ago, when Skov, the
team's leading tackier as a
sophomore in 2010, tore his
ACL and MCL in the third
game of the 2011 season. That
thrust Lancaster and Tarpley
into action.
"I think our eyes were a
little wide," Lancaster re
membered. "We had some
saucers for eyes, especially
having to fill in for Shayne
Skov, you know, giant shoes to
fill, and we'd never both been
in that position. So we both
kind of rallied with each oth
er."
As Skov nursed his injury
and provided guidance for his
replacements, the duo pushed
each other to improve, com
peting for playing time. Both
of them shined in big mo
ments; Tarpley recovered the
game-winning fumble in

triple-overtime at USC, while
Lancaster went on to lead the
team with 70 tackles that
year.

"I think [Tarpley] is the
smartest linebacker in our
core," Skov added. "[He] just
has an all-around expansive
knowledge, surpasses my
knowledge of the defense
probably at this point."
Add to that Tarpley's pen
chant for pass coverage he
has now picked off elite Pac
-12 quarterbacks Matt
Barkley, Marcus Mariota and
Keith Price in consecutive
seasons; the Cardinal is set up
as well as anyone in the coun
try at inside linebacker. The
replacement has become the
partner in crime and all is
well.
Except for one thing:
Where is Lancaster?
Take a wild guess.
"Special teams is my call
ing here," he said.
It might seem like a bit of
a demotion for a guy who, af
ter all, led the team in tackles
just two seasons ago. But as
the defensive playing time be
came more and more scarce
over the last season and a
half, Lancaster began to see
things differently.
"Since redshirt freshman
year, I've been on all four spe
cial teams," Lancaster re
flected. "It's just a part of
what kind of player I am.
High-motor guy, I love to hit,
I love to do whatever the
team needs me to do."
"Jarek, who did an incred
ible job two years ago, [is an]
explosive guy," Skov said. "I
think probably the most fluid
out of all of us. And I think
just, also, given the situation
that he's been in, starting and
not stalling, [he's] just an in
credible teammate."
"I've done every role that
you could possibly ask me to
do," Lancaster said, "and I
love it. I just like being in the
locker room with the guys,
and if coach says, 'Hey, listen,
if this week I need you to do
this,' well, then that's what
I'm going to do."

The following offseason,
Lancaster and Tarpley would
be competing once again, this
time to determine who would
play alongside Skov for the
2012 season. Tarpley gained a
slight edge in the battle be
cause of his ability to read op
posing offenses and slip by
linemen, Lancaster admits,
and that earned him the
starting job. But Skov was
impressed by both of his for
mer replacements.
"I started essentially the
first three seasons of my ca
reer, and I didn't know if I
was going to start last year,"
Skov said. "That's a testa
ment to, within that one sea
son, how much guys had
grown and what they'd done."
Skov did end up starting
in 2012, but he wasn't the
same player who had gone off
on Virginia Tech for 12 tack
les and three sacks in the
2011 Orange Bowl. Though
he continued to be the team's
vocal and emotional leader,
his explosiveness on the field
wasn't yet back.
"We knew what he could
do, you know, what he was
still getting better at," Tarp
ley said. "He was obviously
still a great player for us. It
wasn't like he was a liability."
After another year of heal
ing, Skov finally is back to his
2010 form. He's able to beat
offensive playmakers to the
edge again; Lancaster pin
points it to that tackle for loss
against Washington State,
when Skov met Cougar run
ning back Marcus Mason just
after he caught a checkdown
pass in the backfield.
But don't be so quick to
tab him as the No. 1 guy.
"I'm not going to sit here
and take a back seat to [Skov]
in any way," Tarpley said.
"And he knows that."
To the untrained eye, Skov
and Tarpley look more and
more like each other every
game; they share the physi
cality and the war-painted
eye black, after all. Kotulski
can still identify some differ
ences, however.
"[Tarpley] is like that good
running back that can put his
foot in the ground, make
somebody miss, come on back
and do it again. And Shayne's
probably more of that big tail
back that's going to pound
you and hit you," Kotulksi
said. "So one's a little shiftier,
but they both have toughness
and athletic ability."

and put us in where you need us, and
we can do it all."
Nowhere is that more apparent
than on the punt team, where long
snapper Reed Miller is flanked by
the entire inside linebacker two
deep: Joe Hemschoot and Skov on
his left, A. J. Tarpley and Jarek Lan
caster on his right. Even though
Skov, Tarpley and Lancaster have
combined for 572 tackles, 541/2 tack
les for loss and 23 sacks over their
careers, it's Hemschoot, the least
recognizable name of the bunch, who
Skov calls the Cardinal's most fero
cious hitter.
But special teams are just the tip
of the iceberg. What makes the in
side linebackers truly unique is that
their collective role changes dramat
ically every week and that then*
individual roles have taken a roller
coaster ride of their own over the
last two years.
To the first point, the inside line
backers have to adjust more than

anyone to the bevy of different of
fenses that Stanford faces. One
game, they'll be clogging up the mid
dle against a team like Army, which
runs the ball over 80 percent of the
time; two weeks later, they'll have to
cover speedy slot receivers like
those at Washington State, whose
starting pass catchers are an aver
age 5-foot-ll in height and 184
pounds in weight; the next week,
they'll be tasked with defending
Washington tight end Austin Sefer
ian- Jenkins, a Mackey Award fron
trunner who towers over the field at
6-foot-6,276 pounds.
So how do the Cardinal's inside
linebackers fly to the ball so consis
tently when their assignment more
or less resets every week? According
to Tarpley, the first key is footwork;
one bad step is all a read-option team
needs to gash a defense. Even when
the inside linebackers are in the
right position to play either the run
or the pass, they still have to fight a
mental battle as well.
'A game like Washington State,
you don't want it to frustrate you,"
Tarpley said, referencing the game
when he and Skov combined for just
eight tackles against the Cougars'
bubble screens. "Everyone is going
to have a hard down."
The unit's speed is perhaps the
biggest game-changer against the
Pac-12's spread offenses, as it gives
the linebackers the ability to run
down playmakers behind the line of
scrimmage multiple times a game.

SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
Fifth-year senior captain Shayne Skov (left) tore his ACL and MCL early
in the 2011 season and, after missing two seasons, is finally back to
his 2010 form, tackling for losses and beating offenses to the edge.
Kotulski noted, though Skov
and Tarpley combined for just
two tackles for a loss against
Washington State, both of
them came on pass plays.
"It kind of shows the ath
letic ability that they have, go
ing out and covering wide re
ceivers or tackling guys," Ko
tulski said. "I think both of
them have an understanding
of how they fit, so as different
offenses present different
problems, they have a great
understanding of how they
work together."
That understanding ex
tends beyond just the
starters. Though sophomore
Blake Martinez started the
year as a second-stringer, af
ter he suffered an injury in
practice early in the season,
the entire two-deep at the po
sition has been made up of
seniors.
"I think it's interesting;
just operating in an environ
ment where any time some
body makes a mistake, they

immediately know what hap
pened," Skov said of the
group's experience. "You're
not arguing about what it's
like on paper; you're arguing
about what the intricacies are
—why you did this and why I
was wrong."
Getting to that point, how
ever, has been anything but
easy. It all started two sea
sons ago, when Skov, the
team's leading tackier as a
sophomore in 2010, tore his
ACL and MCL in the third
game of the 2011 season. That
thrust Lancaster and Tarpley
into action.
"I think our eyes were a
little wide," Lancaster re
membered. "We had some
saucers for eyes, especially
having to fill in for Shayne
Skov, you know, giant shoes to
fill, and we'd never both been
in that position. So we both
kind of rallied with each oth
er."
As Skov nursed his injury
and provided guidance for his
replacements, the duo pushed
each other to improve, com
peting for playing time. Both
of them shined in big mo
ments; Tarpley recovered the
game-winning fumble in

triple-overtime at USC, while
Lancaster went on to lead the
team with 70 tackles that
year.

"I think [Tarpley] is the
smartest linebacker in our
core," Skov added. "[He] just
has an all-around expansive
knowledge, surpasses my
knowledge of the defense
probably at this point."
Add to that Tarpley's pen
chant for pass coverage he
has now picked off elite Pac
-12 quarterbacks Matt
Barkley, Marcus Mariota and
Keith Price in consecutive
seasons; the Cardinal is set up
as well as anyone in the coun
try at inside linebacker. The
replacement has become the
partner in crime and all is
well.
Except for one thing:
Where is Lancaster?
Take a wild guess.
"Special teams is my call
ing here," he said.
It might seem like a bit of
a demotion for a guy who, af
ter all, led the team in tackles
just two seasons ago. But as
the defensive playing time be
came more and more scarce
over the last season and a
half, Lancaster began to see
things differently.
"Since redshirt freshman
year, I've been on all four spe
cial teams," Lancaster re
flected. "It's just a part of
what kind of player I am.
High-motor guy, I love to hit,
I love to do whatever the
team needs me to do."
"Jarek, who did an incred
ible job two years ago, [is an]
explosive guy," Skov said. "I
think probably the most fluid
out of all of us. And I think
just, also, given the situation
that he's been in, starting and
not stalling, [he's] just an in
credible teammate."
"I've done every role that
you could possibly ask me to
do," Lancaster said, "and I
love it. I just like being in the
locker room with the guys,
and if coach says, 'Hey, listen,
if this week I need you to do
this,' well, then that's what
I'm going to do."

The following offseason,
Lancaster and Tarpley would
be competing once again, this
time to determine who would
play alongside Skov for the
2012 season. Tarpley gained a
slight edge in the battle be
cause of his ability to read op
posing offenses and slip by
linemen, Lancaster admits,
and that earned him the
starting job. But Skov was
impressed by both of his for
mer replacements.
"I started essentially the
first three seasons of my ca
reer, and I didn't know if I
was going to start last year,"
Skov said. "That's a testa
ment to, within that one sea
son, how much guys had
grown and what they'd done."
Skov did end up starting
in 2012, but he wasn't the
same player who had gone off
on Virginia Tech for 12 tack
les and three sacks in the
2011 Orange Bowl. Though
he continued to be the team's
vocal and emotional leader,
his explosiveness on the field
wasn't yet back.
"We knew what he could
do, you know, what he was
still getting better at," Tarp
ley said. "He was obviously
still a great player for us. It
wasn't like he was a liability."
After another year of heal
ing, Skov finally is back to his
2010 form. He's able to beat
offensive playmakers to the
edge again; Lancaster pin
points it to that tackle for loss
against Washington State,
when Skov met Cougar run
ning back Marcus Mason just
after he caught a checkdown
pass in the backfield.
But don't be so quick to
tab him as the No. 1 guy.
"I'm not going to sit here
and take a back seat to [Skov]
in any way," Tarpley said.
"And he knows that."
To the untrained eye, Skov
and Tarpley look more and
more like each other every
game; they share the physi
cality and the war-painted
eye black, after all. Kotulski
can still identify some differ
ences, however.
"[Tarpley] is like that good
running back that can put his
foot in the ground, make
somebody miss, come on back
and do it again. And Shayne's
probably more of that big tail
back that's going to pound
you and hit you," Kotulksi
said. "So one's a little shiftier,
but they both have toughness
and athletic ability."

Senior inside linebacker A.J. Tarpley (above) stepped up to
to replace Skov after his injuries in 2011. The pair has
ended up complementing each other better than expected.
There's just something
special about Stanford's
inside linebackers. For
one, a unit that consists
of four seniors prides it
self on special teams, of all things
and Stanford's eye-blacked, mo

is no exception.
