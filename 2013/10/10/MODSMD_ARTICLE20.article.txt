### â€” Ashley Westhem 
For the first time in nearly
a decade the NCAA has
agreed to allow schools to
host the NCAA tournament
regionals, with the intention
being to noticeably increase
game attendance.
The four schools chosen to
host are Stanford, Notre
Dame, Louisville and Nebras
ka. In the past Stanford has
typically hosted the first
round of the tournament. All
four schools have experienced
incredible success playing at
home and tend to draw large

crowds. Since the 2007-08
season, the Cardinal is 92-2 at
Maples Pavilion.
Maples Pavilion, with a
7,233-seat capacity has hosted
the NCAA Regional four
times previously the last
time being in 2003. This is al
so the 18th year that Stanford
has hosted NCAA Tourna
ment games since 1989. The
Cardinal averaged 4,284 fans
per home game during the
2012-13 season.
The NCAA Regionals will
take place March 29 through
April 1, with specific dates
and times for each game yet
to be determined.
