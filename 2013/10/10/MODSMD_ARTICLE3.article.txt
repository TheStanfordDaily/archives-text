# Hoover turns to court
## Stanford caught in family feud over Chiang Kai-shek diaries 
### LINDSAY FUNK 
The U.S. District Court in San
Jose will now decide the rightful
claimant to the diaries of former
Chinese Nationalist Party leader
Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chi
ang Ching-kuo. Fifty-one boxes of
their writings were loaned to the
Hoover Institution, where they have
been preserved, archived and made
available for scholarly research.
Ever since Chiang Ching-kuo's
daughter-in-law lent the diaries in
December 2004, nine other family
members have come forward to
claim ownership of them.
On Sept. 20, Stanford filed a
motion requesting the district
court's assistance in resolving a
family feud over the documents' le
gitimate owner. The court motion
filed by Stanford names the
claimants as the children and
grandchildren of Chiang Ching-kuo,
amongst others; they are scattered
across Taiwan, Mainland China, the
United Kingdom and California,
complicating efforts to resolve the
dispute.
"For the last several years, the
Hoover Institution has tried to work
with all the claimants to reach an
agreement on the status of the de
posit, which is crucial to under
standing 20th century history," said

Eryn Witcher, Bechtel Director of
Public Affairs at the Hoover Institu
tion, in a written statement. "De
spite our attempts, we have not
been able to resolve the dispute am
icably and so are reluctantly turn
ing to the court for assistance."
The diaries span over five
decades of Chiang Kai-shek's life,
from his early rise in the Chinese
Nationalist Party to his twilight
years ruling Taiwan in exile. They
provide an intimate look at Chi
ang's time as the Chinese head of
state from 1928-49.
The diaries draw hundreds of
scholars every year, making them
one of Hoover's most popular col
lections.
Hsiao-Ting Lin, curator of
Hoover's East Asia collection, em
phasized the scholarly value of the
diaries' deeply personal nature, con
trasting their content with the
many official documents from the
time period.
"The diaries bring us into the in
ner world of one of the most famous
world leaders in the past century,"
said Lin, who is also a research fel
low at Hoover. "They provide schol
ars with not only details of major
historical events but also insight in
to the human element of history."
Lin uses the diaries to supple
ment his own research. He recent

ly completed a manuscript on U.S.-
Taiwan-China triangular relations
during the early Cold War.
"The diaries reveal how person
al events played a crucial role in
Chiang Kai-shek's management of
China and Taiwan's foreign af
fairs," he said.
The Chiang Kai-shek diaries
complement Hoover's vast East
Asia archive, which includes over
800 archival collections and has be
come one of the preeminent hold
ings for papers on modern Chinese
history.
The court deliberation could
determine whether these diaries
will stay at Hoover, although the
motion doesn't indicate whether
any family member has requested
that the diaries be relocated. The
motion does note, however, that
claimants have "given differing in
structions regarding the handling
of the [diaries]," which may im
pact how they are redacted and
handled even if they remain at
Hoover.
"It has been a great privilege for
the Hoover Institution to be the
home to the Chiang family materi
al," Witcher said. "We hope that a
resolution can be found soon."
