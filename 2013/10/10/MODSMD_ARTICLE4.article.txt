### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
"It's magical to do something
when you think no one is going to
care."
That is how Daniel Handler
more commonly known as
Lemony Snicket went into the
writing process of his popular
children's series, "A Series of
Unfortunate Events."
Through collaboration be
tween the Stanford Storytelling
Project and the Stanford Speak
er's Bureau, Handler gave a talk

at Cemex auditorium Wednesday
night.
During the talk, Handler read
passages from "When Did You
See Her Last?", the second in
stallment in his "All the Wrong
Questions" young adult series,
which follows the life of Lemony
Snicket as a young man. The au
thor also read a passage from his
first novel, "The Basic Eight."
Three students were given
the chance to ask Handler ques
tions about his work at the event.
