care."

Unfortunate Events."

tween the Stanford Storytelling
Project and the Stanford Speak
er's Bureau, Handler gave a talk

at Cemex auditorium Wednesday
night.

See Her Last?", the second in
stallment in his "All the Wrong
Questions" young adult series,
which follows the life of Lemony
Snicket as a young man. The au
thor also read a passage from his
first novel, "The Basic Eight."

Author Daniel Handler, also known as Lemony Snicket, spoke on
Wednesday evening at CEMEX auditorium, where he discussed
the inspiration behind his series, "A Series of Unfortunate Events."
Robin Summers 'l6, Aaron Broder
'l5 and Ouree Lee 'l7 engaged
Handler in a question-and-answer
session that ranged from topics
concerning his writing style to his
inspiration for "All the Wrong
Questions" to his spirit animal.
Handler told the audience his in
terest in writing stems from his in
terest in telling stories. He was in
spired to write "All the Wrong
Questions" because of his curiosity
concerning how Count Olaf, the an
tagonist of "A Series of Unfortunate
Events," could become the kind of
man readers see in the series.
"In 'A Series of Unfortunate
Events,' Lemony Snicket is a full
grown man, with a habit of defining
his own words," Handler said.
"Where do you get a habit like that,
that you might still have as an
adult?"
The noir genre of "A Series of

Unfortunate Events" and "All the
Wrong Questions" came around
because of a parallel Handler no
ticed between the journeys of a
noir detective and a child as he or
she grows up.
"It's like the agenda that adults
tell you when you're growing up
because they want to hide some
thing from you," Handler said.
"The noii- detective discovers this
agenda and wants to pursue it and
he's told to lay off the case and
doesn't like that. That's childhood
too."
"Children are trying to find
their own moral path that's sepa
rate from the moral path assigned
to them. They're hitting adoles
cence and realizing that everyone's
lying all the time," he added.
Handler said he finds inspira
tion for his stories in everyday life.
"I'll have some idea or see some
thing or an event will strike me in a
certain way," he said. "I'll string it
along immediately and think of
where it could lead and where it
could go. I think of a story."
The interaction between the

three students and moderator was
followed by the audience Q&A ses
sion. During this time, Handler
gave his views on the importance
of plot over character.
This distinction was important
for Arielle Basich 'l5, a member in
the audience who has dealt with the
issue of character versus plot im
portance in her own writing.
"It was a really refreshing look
at storytelling and different from
how a lot of other people think
about it," she said. "I hate how peo
ple think you should know every
thing about a character."
During the talk, Handler also
discussed his inspiration for "A Se
ries of Unfortunate Events."
Handler told the audience he
came up with the idea for the series
after thinking about all of the terri
ble things that could happen to or
phans.
"No one thought it was going to
work," Handler said. "And we were
all wrong."

"It's magical to do something
when you think no one is going to
care."
That is how Daniel Handler
more commonly known as
Lemony Snicket went into the
writing process of his popular
children's series, "A Series of
Unfortunate Events."
Through collaboration be
tween the Stanford Storytelling
Project and the Stanford Speak
er's Bureau, Handler gave a talk

at Cemex auditorium Wednesday
night.
During the talk, Handler read
passages from "When Did You
See Her Last?", the second in
stallment in his "All the Wrong
Questions" young adult series,
which follows the life of Lemony
Snicket as a young man. The au
thor also read a passage from his
first novel, "The Basic Eight."
Three students were given
the chance to ask Handler ques
tions about his work at the event.

Author Daniel Handler, also known as Lemony Snicket, spoke on
Wednesday evening at CEMEX auditorium, where he discussed
the inspiration behind his series, "A Series of Unfortunate Events."
Robin Summers 'l6, Aaron Broder
'l5 and Ouree Lee 'l7 engaged
Handler in a question-and-answer
session that ranged from topics
concerning his writing style to his
inspiration for "All the Wrong
Questions" to his spirit animal.
Handler told the audience his in
terest in writing stems from his in
terest in telling stories. He was in
spired to write "All the Wrong
Questions" because of his curiosity
concerning how Count Olaf, the an
tagonist of "A Series of Unfortunate
Events," could become the kind of
man readers see in the series.
"In 'A Series of Unfortunate
Events,' Lemony Snicket is a full
grown man, with a habit of defining
his own words," Handler said.
"Where do you get a habit like that,
that you might still have as an
adult?"
The noir genre of "A Series of

Unfortunate Events" and "All the
Wrong Questions" came around
because of a parallel Handler no
ticed between the journeys of a
noir detective and a child as he or
she grows up.
"It's like the agenda that adults
tell you when you're growing up
because they want to hide some
thing from you," Handler said.
"The noii- detective discovers this
agenda and wants to pursue it and
he's told to lay off the case and
doesn't like that. That's childhood
too."
"Children are trying to find
their own moral path that's sepa
rate from the moral path assigned
to them. They're hitting adoles
cence and realizing that everyone's
lying all the time," he added.
Handler said he finds inspira
tion for his stories in everyday life.
"I'll have some idea or see some
thing or an event will strike me in a
certain way," he said. "I'll string it
along immediately and think of
where it could lead and where it
could go. I think of a story."
The interaction between the

three students and moderator was
followed by the audience Q&A ses
sion. During this time, Handler
gave his views on the importance
of plot over character.
This distinction was important
for Arielle Basich 'l5, a member in
the audience who has dealt with the
issue of character versus plot im
portance in her own writing.
"It was a really refreshing look
at storytelling and different from
how a lot of other people think
about it," she said. "I hate how peo
ple think you should know every
thing about a character."
During the talk, Handler also
discussed his inspiration for "A Se
ries of Unfortunate Events."
Handler told the audience he
came up with the idea for the series
after thinking about all of the terri
ble things that could happen to or
phans.
"No one thought it was going to
work," Handler said. "And we were
all wrong."
