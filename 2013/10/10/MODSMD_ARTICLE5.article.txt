## Study finds 22 percent poverty rate in CA 
### MICHAELA ELIAS 
A recent study conducted by
Stanford scholars revealed that
22 percent of California resi
dents are in poverty.
The Stanford Center on
Poverty and Inequality and the
Public Policy Institute of Cali
fornia (PPIC) conducted the
study prompted by the Sup
plemental Poverty Measure re
leased by the Census Bureau
revealing that California's
poverty rate was the highest of
any state.
While the Census Bureau
study relied on self reports from
those who use federal safety
nets such as CalFresh (Cali

fornia's food stamp program),
CaIWORKs (California's cash
assistance program) and the
federal Earned Income Tax
Credit the Stanford-PPIC
study used a new method of cal
culating poverty called the Cali
fornia Poverty Measure (CPM),
which relies on administrative
data on safety net use and ac
counts for housing costs and
transfer payments.
"We wanted a better esti
mate of economic need across
the state of California that con
sidered how well families were
being served by the safety net,"
said Beth Mattingly, one of the

researchers that helped the
Stanford team.
While California is sub
ject to many of the same
causes of poverty as other
states, there are some fac
tors that might be more
prominent in the Golden
State. The CPM revealed
that nearly 30 percent of
California's immigrant pop
ulation is in poverty.
Another source of finan
cial concern in the state is
the skyrocketing housing
costs in certain metropolitan
areas such as Los Angeles,
which drain the income of
California immigrants at
tracted by abundant work
opportunities in those areas.
While the study findings
may paint a dismal picture,
they could potentially accel
erate policy reforms. David
Grusky, director of the Stan
ford Center on Poverty and
Inequality, said the new re

port will allow state legisla
tors to assess how many peo
ple are living in poverty
more accurately.
"We have far too long
been flying blind, trying
gamely to develop policy
without knowing how severe
poverty is, where it's most
extreme and how it's chang
ing," Grusky said. "The Cal
ifornia Poverty Measure al
lows us to develop policy on
the basis of evidence rather
than guesswork."
The CPM has a few fea
tures that can assist policy
makers in addressing the high
poverty rate. One has to do
with the extent of the popula
tion that the study comprises.
Whereas the Census' Sup
plemental Poverty Measure
derives its numbers from the
Current Population Survey,
the CPM relies on the Amer
ican Community Survey,
which is based on a much
larger sample size and allows
researchers to take a more
systematic approach to deal
ing with the poverty issue.
Additionally, the CPM
takes into account county

differences in measuring
poverty rates. For example,
a poverty rate of 26.9 per
cent was found in urban re
gions like Los Angeles
County where housing is
particularly expensive.
Apart from factoring in
geographical differences,
the CPM also quantitatively
measures the success of fed
eral safety nets. For example
the three largest safety net
programs jointly reduce
child poverty rates by 12
percent, which translates to
1.1 million children lifted
from poverty.
Both Mattingly and
Grusky believe that CPM al
lows the legislature to better
assess the impact of govern
ment policies and make
more informed decisions
about cutting and imple
menting programs.
"The study has sparked
widespread interest across
the state, both among policy
makers and advocates,"
Mattingly said.
