## DLCL creates minor in translation New program aims to offer language work to all majors 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
The Division of Literatures, Cul
tures and Languages (DLCL) is of
fering a new minor program in
translation studies this year.
The minor consists of 26 units in
core, language, literature and elec
tive courses and a final translation
project conducted under the super
vision of an instructor.
The new program is aimed at
students who want to explore what
it means to adapt literary works to
a different language and is available
to students who have no experience
in their chosen foreign languages of
study as well as students who are
native speakers in the language or
languages they want to use in their
final projects.
"All the courses and different
components the language study,
the literature study, the electives
are meant to give the students a
greater context in which to be more
skilled," said Cintia Santana, advi
sor for the minor program. "All of it
is to make students better readers,
which makes [them] a better trans
lator."
Gabriella Safran, chair of the
DLCL, worked with Santana and
Indra Levy, an associate professor
in East Asian Languages and Cul
tures, to design the minor and its
course list for the past two years.
"It's a good moment for this type
of program," Safran said. "Living
here and having this base of students
with such diverse languages and liv
ing in such a connected world makes
us aware of the degree to which our
lives depend on translation."
Santana said there was a rela
tively high number of students in
terested in the minor at Majors
Night on Oct. 1. Safran said she an
ticipates that about five to 10 stu
dents will participate in the pro
gram this year a range that fits
the program well because, accord
ing to her, the minor is very advis
ing intensive.
"Maybe we'll get a huge crowd
of students pouring in and we'll
have to think about a new structure
to meet all of their needs,"
Safran said. "You have to be
open-minded as you institute
a new program."
One of two core classes for
the minor, DLCL 293: Liter
ary Translation taught by
Santana, has been offered in
the department before. San
tana said that enrollment in
this class offered again
this year during winter quar
ter — will give the DLCL a
better sense of how many stu
dents are interested in the
program.
Trent Walker 'lO took
Santana's class as an under
graduate and said he appreci
ated the chance to explore the
critical theory concerning
translation and work closely
with his own writing in a safe
space to exchange ideas.
"Something I would have
really appreciated about a
translation minor is being
able to connect with other
students who are doing that
minor and to be able to learn

from what they are strug
gling with or working with,"
Walker said.
Aliya Deri 'l3, who also
took the Literary Translation
course, said that even as a
computer science major, trans
lation was a valuable skill to
learn.
"A course like this helps
those in engineering—espe
cially those in computer sci
ence situate themselves
and their work in the history
of translation, which is some
thing I had never done be
fore," Deri said.
Indeed, Safran said the
minor program is for stu
dents of all areas of study.
"One reason why it's ex
citing to be involved in lan
guages and literatures is
because we have students
with such diverse languages
and interests," Safran said.
"This minor is away to give
students a context, a struc
ture, in which they can take
their knowledge of language
further, explore foreign cul
tures and then do something
with it."
