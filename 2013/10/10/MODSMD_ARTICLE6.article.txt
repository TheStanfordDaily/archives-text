## DLCL creates minor in translation New program aims to offer language work to all majors 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
The Division of Literatures, Cul
tures and Languages (DLCL) is of
fering a new minor program in
translation studies this year.
The minor consists of 26 units in
core, language, literature and elec
tive courses and a final translation
project conducted under the super
vision of an instructor.
The new program is aimed at
students who want to explore what
it means to adapt literary works to
a different language and is available
to students who have no experience
in their chosen foreign languages of
study as well as students who are
native speakers in the language or
languages they want to use in their
final projects.
"All the courses and different
components the language study,
the literature study, the electives
are meant to give the students a
greater context in which to be more
skilled," said Cintia Santana, advi
sor for the minor program. "All of it
is to make students better readers,
which makes [them] a better trans
lator."
Gabriella Safran, chair of the
DLCL, worked with Santana and
Indra Levy, an associate professor
in East Asian Languages and Cul
tures, to design the minor and its
course list for the past two years.
"It's a good moment for this type
of program," Safran said. "Living
here and having this base of students
with such diverse languages and liv
ing in such a connected world makes
us aware of the degree to which our
lives depend on translation."
Santana said there was a rela
tively high number of students in
terested in the minor at Majors
Night on Oct. 1. Safran said she an
ticipates that about five to 10 stu
dents will participate in the pro
gram this year a range that fits
the program well because, accord
ing to her, the minor is very advis
ing intensive.
"Maybe we'll get a huge crowd
of students pouring in and we'll
have to think about a new structure
