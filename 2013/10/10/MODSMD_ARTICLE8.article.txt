## Professor Michael Levitt awarded 2013 Nobel Prize 
### â€“ Ileana Najarro 
Michael Levitt, professor in cancer re
search and structural biology at the Stan
ford School of Medicine, won the 2013 No
bel Prize in Chemistry "for the develop
ment of multiscale models for complex
chemical systems."
"I think that progress is made by solv
ing lots of little technical problems,"
Levitt said in a University video in which
he shared his news. "You never really get
an 'ah-ha' moment and solve it all."
Levitt shares the award with Martin
Karplus, professeur conventionne at the
Universite de Strasbourg, France, profes
sor of chemistry emeritus at Harvard and
Arieh Warshel, a distinguished professor
of chemistry at USC.
The three winners are credited for us
ing computer models to make Newton's
classical physics "work side-by-side with
the fundamentally different quantum
physics." In doing so they demonstrated
the value of computer technology in the
modern chemical lab.
Each winner will receive approximate
ly $1.2 million.
News of Levitt's Nobel Prize distinc
tion comes just two days after Thomas
Siidhof, neuroscientist and professor of
molecular and cellular physiology at the
School of Medicine, won the 2013 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Yale

professor and former Stanford professor
of biochemistry, James Rothman, and
UC-Berkeley professor Randy Schekman
Ph.D. '75.
"This is our second Nobel prize this
week," said President John Hennessy at a
press conference celebrating Levitt's ac
complishments. "I think great science and
great people dedicated to their science is
what the Nobel Prize is all about, and
Michael is a great inspiration in that re
gard."
Brian Kobilka, professor and chair of
molecular and cellular physiology at the
School of Medicine and his former
postdoctoral advisor, Robert Lefkowitz
won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
for them work on G protein-coupled recep
tors (GPCR), a large family of receptor
proteins found on the surface of cells.
