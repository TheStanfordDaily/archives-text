## 
### â€“ Brittany Torres 
Jim Plummer M.S. '67 Ph.D '7l, dean
of the School of Engineering, will step
down at the end of this year after serving
as dean for 15 year's, according to a press
release.
"I have been privileged to serve as
dean and to work with some of the best
faculty, staff and students in the world, but
it is time for me and the School of Engi

neering to move on," Plummer said.
"Change is good. It is good for people and
it is good for institutions."
Plummer is the longest-serving dean
of the school to date.
At the end of this year, Plummer will
begin a yearlong sabbatical, after which
he will return to research as a professor in
the Electrical Engineering department.
"Jim Plummer's leadership has
changed the character of Stanford's
graduate and undergraduate engineer
ing education, which has become known
internationally for its hands-on, creative,
multidisciplinary approach," said
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2.
"The soaring numbers of students and
the accomplishments of our engineering
alumni are proof of that success."
Since being appointed as dean in
1999, Plummer has overseen upgrades to
the school's physical plant, including the
Science and Engineering Quad slated for
completion in 2014. During his tenure,
the percentage of undergraduates pursu
ing a degree in engineering has grown
from 20 percent to nearly 35 percent.
"Students come to Stanford because
they want to change the world, and more
of them are deciding that engineering
provides the means to do this," Plummer
said.
Etchemendy will appoint a search
committee this fall to replace Plummer.
