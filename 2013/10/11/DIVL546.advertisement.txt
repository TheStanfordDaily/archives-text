The Roger W. Heyns Lecture in Religion & Society
Krista Tippett
99
Peabody Award winning broadcaster Krista Tippett attended
Brown and Yale (Master of Divinity). She is a prolific writer
and contributor to the conversations about the spiritual and
intellectual content of faith on her weekly public radio program
called "On Being with Krista Tippett" (onbeing.org) and forums
like TED.
Her talk will focus on the current direction of religion and
public discourse and tie into her latest undertaking, the Civil
Conversations Project (CCP). CCP is a series of radio shows and an
online resource for beginning new conversations in families and
communities. How do we speak the questions we don't know how
to ask each other? Can we find ways to bridge gulfs between us
about politics, morality, and life itself? Can we do that even while
we continue to disagree, passionately? How is technology playing
into all this, and how can we shape it?
