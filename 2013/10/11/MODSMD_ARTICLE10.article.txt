NO. 5 STANFORD [5-0,3-0 PAC-12] AT AT
UTAH [3-2, 0-2]

GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 31, UTAH 13 : Phew, last
week was close. A trip to Salt Lake this weekend
won't be easy for the Cardinal, but I think Kevin
Hogan will bounce back on the road after the
worst game of his career against Washington.
That being said, Utah's defensive line is scary
good — the unit has recorded 18 sacks so far
this season, good for second best in the nation —
even with the loss of Star Lotulelei to the NFL.
The Utes probably will be able to get some pres
sure on Hogan, but I think he'll hang tough and
be more patient with his throws. This is a game
that Stanford should win by at least two touch
downs.
SAM FISHER
STANFORD 38, UTAH 24: There is only
one relevant question to answer when deciding
how to pick this matchup: Will Stanford rebound
from a middling performance against Washington
or will that game only be the beginning of a trend?
I have a feeling that the competitive nature of
David Shaw, Hogan and the rest of the Cardinal,
combined with added anger over Steve Sark
isian's fake-injury comments, will be enough to
bring back the dominant version of this Stanford
team. The Cardinal will win easily, but Utah will
make the final score a bit more respectable in
garbage time, where Stanford has allowed points
all season long.
VLHAN LAKSHMAN
STANFORD 35, UTAH 17: REYNOLDS AND
company have to be licking their chops. While
the Utes played UCLA tough last Thursday, the
decisive factor in the game was Wilson's whop
ping six interceptions. Like at Army and Wazzu, I
have a feeling the Cardinal will start off with a
lackluster first quarter as players get acclimated
to the tough environment of Rice-Eccles Stadi
um. At the end of the day, once Stanford takes
the lead, the Utes will be forced into passing situ
ations to keep up with the Card's balanced offen
sive attack. And when that time comes, Trent
Murphy and the entire party in the backfield will
arrive to put this game on ice.
