# QBs key in Salt Lake City battle
## 
### WHAT TO WATCH FOR San Fisher 
Utah: the final frontier of Stan
ford football domination. Be
lieve it or not, the Utes are
the only team left in the Pac
-12 against which the Cardinal does
not own an active winning streak.
Stanford hasn't taken on Utah since
1996, however, so the Utes will be
facing a very different type of Stan
ford team.
That doesn't mean that Utah
can't beat the Cardinal. Anyone who
saw Utah almost beat UCLA last
Thursday night—even with quarter
back Travis Wilson throwing six inter
ceptions—knows that, at least at
Rice-Eccles Stadium, the Utes are a
dangerous opponent.
The keys to this game start with
the quarterbacks. Stanford junior quar
terback Kevin Hogan needs to rebound
from a very weak performance against
Washington. Hogan looked jittery in
the pocket all night long, made bad de
cisions and missed open receivers even
when he made the right reads. He has
to be better for Stanford to win the
Pac-12.
The difficulty for Hogan Saturday
afternoon will be that he is again fac
ing a very strong defensive line. The
Utes graduated a first-round NFL
draft pick in nose tackle Star Lo
tulelei, but somehow the unit hasn't
missed a beat. Defensive ends Nate
Orchard and Trevor Reilly are both re
turning starters who earned honor
able mention all-Pac-12 honors in
2012 and will be tasked with applying
pressure on Hogan without the help

of blitzing linebackers.

Stanford's offensive line has
been pretty stout in pass protection
on the season, but a few lapses can
have a noticeable impact. If Utah's
linemen can battle Stanford's mam
moths up front and get enough pres

sure on Hogan to keep him out of
rhythm again, the Utes might be able
to pull off the upset.
On the other side of the ball,
Wilson is going to have to show some
serious mental toughness to bounce
back from a six-interception perform
ance. Stanford's defense is oppor
tunistic and loves rattling the quarter
back. Heck, if I got hit by fifth-year
senior linebackers Trent Murphy and
Shayne Skov a few times, I'd be rat

tied too.

Wilson is going to have to be
mentally tougher than I am, however,
as Stanford is a much better team
than UCLA and will win by a lot more
than seven points if Wilson throws six
interceptions. It will be difficult for
Wilson, as his offensive line looked
mediocre against UCLA, and rumor
has it that his two top tight ends will
both be out on Saturday; but he's a
talented quarterback who certainly

can give defenses nightmares.
The one non-quarterback X-fac
tor in this matchup is Stanford's dom
inant special teams unit. Obviously,
the group took center stage against
Washington with Montgomery's two
big returns, but Stanford has been slyly
picking up yards on every special
teams play all year long. My favorite
stat: Stanford's average start on kick
offs is 12 yards better than that of its
opponents. That translates to a little

over one point of expected value on
every kickoff. That's a good way to
win games. The question this week
end: Will the altitude in Salt Lake City
shrink this edge? We'll see soon
enough.

Sam Fisher hopes his... edge won't
shrink in the Salt Lake City altitude. If
