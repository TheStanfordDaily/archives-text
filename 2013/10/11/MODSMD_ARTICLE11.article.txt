# QBs key in Salt Lake City battle

### WHAT TO WATCH FOR San Fisher 
Utah: the final frontier of Stan
ford football domination. Be
lieve it or not, the Utes are
the only team left in the Pac
-12 against which the Cardinal does
not own an active winning streak.
Stanford hasn't taken on Utah since
1996, however, so the Utes will be
facing a very different type of Stan
ford team.
That doesn't mean that Utah
can't beat the Cardinal. Anyone who
saw Utah almost beat UCLA last
Thursday night—even with quarter
back Travis Wilson throwing six inter
ceptions—knows that, at least at
Rice-Eccles Stadium, the Utes are a
dangerous opponent.
The keys to this game start with
the quarterbacks. Stanford junior quar
terback Kevin Hogan needs to rebound
from a very weak performance against
Washington. Hogan looked jittery in
the pocket all night long, made bad de
cisions and missed open receivers even
when he made the right reads. He has
to be better for Stanford to win the
Pac-12.
The difficulty for Hogan Saturday
afternoon will be that he is again fac
ing a very strong defensive line. The
Utes graduated a first-round NFL
draft pick in nose tackle Star Lo
tulelei, but somehow the unit hasn't
missed a beat. Defensive ends Nate
Orchard and Trevor Reilly are both re
turning starters who earned honor
able mention all-Pac-12 honors in
2012 and will be tasked with applying
pressure on Hogan without the help
