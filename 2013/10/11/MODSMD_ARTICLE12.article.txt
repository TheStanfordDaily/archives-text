# BACK AND FORTH WITH UTAH
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's football game be
tween Stanford and Utah, The Daily's Win
ston Shi chatted with Ryan McDonald,
sports editor for the Utah Daily Chronicle,
Utah's student newspaper, to get perspec
tive from both camps. Below is a partial tran
script of their conversation. For the full
back-and-forth, go to www.stanforddaily.

Winston Shi (WS): Looking at Utah's sched
ules in recent years, Stanford is the best confer
ence opponent Utah has welcomed to Rice-Ec
cles since the Pac-12 became a thing. Two and
a bit years into the Pac-12 experiment, how is
the Utah football program? How are you adjust
ing to the increased strength of schedule, how
is the fan base taking the growing pains (and a
losing season), and is recruiting improving?

Ryan McDonald (RM): All in all, the pro
gram is in a good place. There have definitely
been growing pains, but things this year are
actually considerably better than I expected
them to be. [Quarterback Travis] Wilson was
n't good as a freshman and I wasn't confident
that he would progress much from last year
to this year, but he's been excellent. Yes, he
threw six interceptions last Thursday, but on
ly two of them were his fault, and [head
coach Kyle] Whittingham revealed Monday
that Wilson was sick last Thursday, so that af
fected him.

Going back to the program, a new $32-
million football facility was built and is now
open. It's an incredibly gaudy place, and Whit
tingham is hopeful that'll help recruiting in the
future. So I think the pace of progression has
been accelerated this season more than most
thought it would, making where the team is at
now better than what I think many people ex
pected.

WS: Definitely Utah's been using some of that
Pac-12 cash flow. It certainly allowed them to
bring in Dennis Erickson as offensive coordina
tor. What's Erickson been doing with the Ute
offense?

RM: Transforming it. To be serious, a lot of
great things are happening with the offense.
They didn't have a quarterback last year (yeah,
Wilson began starting halfway through the season,
but he was thrown into the fire so I don't think
anything he did last year can be considered),
which trickled down into the rest of the offense.
The receivers couldn't do anything without a de
cent quarterback and so even though they had a
good running back, he was less effective because
the passing game didn't work.

WS: Do you think that Utah is going to try to run
the ball? Throw the ball? And how does losing
star tight end Jake Murphy play into that?

RM: As far as the tight end situation goes,
Murphy hasn't been utilized as much as I
thought he would be, so I'm not sure how
huge of a loss it will be, but I will say this:
Tight end was going to be a strength this year
with Murphy and Westlee Tonga, but they're
both going to be out on Saturday. If Tonga was
going to be there, Utah would have been okay
at tight end on Saturday because, like I said,
it's not like they're throwing to the tight ends
on every play. But with both of them being
out, that presents a problem.

WS: So Tonga is definitely going to be out?

RM: As far as I've been made aware.

WS: Especially with fewer healthy tight
ends, Utah needs to keep an eye out for the
Stanford pass rush. How is Utah's offensive
line doing this season?

RM: It's been good, but not wonderful.
They were expecting good things with [left
tackle] C.J. Poutasi and [left guard] Jeremiah
Tofaeono, but so far they haven't been any
thing to write home about. Like I said, they
haven't been awful by any means, but they
haven't been great. I know Wilson is count
ing on the Stanford pass rush being tough.

WS: Keeping all these things in mind:
What's your prediction? How do you see the
game turning out?

RM: I ultimately think Stanford has too much
for Utah to handle, but I don't think it'll be a
blowout. Last I checked, the Vegas line was 9
1/2 and I've been saying somewhere be
tween 10 and 17 points all week long.

WS: The final tally, then?

RM: Let's say 34-20 for Stanford.
WS: I think it's going to be similar to that, al
though I honestly
don't know what's going to happen. I think
it's a bit more low-scoring than that, perhaps
a 31-13 affair, but it's big-time college foot
ball: Anything and probably everything can
and will happen.
