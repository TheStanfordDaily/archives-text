### JORDAN WALLACH 
Coming off a Southern California road trip in
which it was swept in a match for the first time
since 2011 by No. 2 USC, Stanford women's vol
leyball is eager to return to the friendly confines
of Maples Pavilion, where it hasn't lost since Dec.
3, 2011.
The No. 8 Cardinal (10-3, 2-1 Pac-12) con
tinues its Pac-12 campaign tonight against the
unranked Utah Utes (13-3, 2-2) and on Saturday
against the unranked Colorado Buffaloes (11-3,
3-1).

Stanford and Utah met just in 2012, with the
Cardinal posting a four-set victory in Salt Lake City
as part of its 21-match winning streak. Despite
Utah advantages in hitting, team blocks and service
aces in the match, Stanford won three straight sets
after dropping the first to pull out the win.
Friday's match pairs two of the top three teams
in blocking in the Pac-12: The Utes rank third with
2.83 blocks per set and the Cardinal ranks first, as

Senior Carly Wopat (center) leads the Pac-12 with 1.39 blocks per set, and noted that the Cardinal
has focused on blocking this week as it prepares for visits from Utah and Colorado. The
Utes in particular are specialists at the net and are 12-1 when outblocking their opponents.
