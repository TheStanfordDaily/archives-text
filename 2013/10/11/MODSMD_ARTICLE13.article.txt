# Blocking big for Cardinal
## 
### JORDAN WALLACH 
Coming off a Southern California road trip in
which it was swept in a match for the first time
since 2011 by No. 2 USC, Stanford women's vol
leyball is eager to return to the friendly confines
of Maples Pavilion, where it hasn't lost since Dec.
3, 2011.
The No. 8 Cardinal (10-3, 2-1 Pac-12) con
tinues its Pac-12 campaign tonight against the
unranked Utah Utes (13-3, 2-2) and on Saturday
against the unranked Colorado Buffaloes (11-3,
3-1).

Stanford and Utah met just in 2012, with the
Cardinal posting a four-set victory in Salt Lake City
as part of its 21-match winning streak. Despite
Utah advantages in hitting, team blocks and service
aces in the match, Stanford won three straight sets
after dropping the first to pull out the win.
Friday's match pairs two of the top three teams
in blocking in the Pac-12: The Utes rank third with
2.83 blocks per set and the Cardinal ranks first, as

Senior Carly Wopat (center) leads the Pac-12 with 1.39 blocks per set, and noted that the Cardinal
has focused on blocking this week as it prepares for visits from Utah and Colorado. The
Utes in particular are specialists at the net and are 12-1 when outblocking their opponents.
well as first in the nation, with 3.10 blocks per
set. Stanford will look to take advantage of a
slight edge in size with its middle blockers, 6-
foot-2 senior Carly Wopat and 6-foot-3 sopho
more Inky Ajanaku, in order to counter Utah's
attack. The Utes are 12-1 in matches in which
they outblock their opponents, so there prom
ises to be a constant battle at the net.

Wopat, who leads the Pac-12 with 1.39
blocks per set and a .494 hitting percentage
(third nationally), noted that the team has
been focused especially on blocks this week.
"We've been doing a lot of defensive
drills covering, which is important for not
letting blocks drop," Wopat said, "and just get
ting after it offensively tooling the block,
seeing where the blockers are and hitting
away from them, and just being smart with

our shots."

Senior middle blocker Erin Redd-Bran
don, ranked second in the Pac-12 in blocks per
set, is one of the keys to the Utes' defensive
game. She also leads the Utes with a .337 hit
ting percentage. Junior libero Lea Adolph is
another Ute to watch, as she had a career-high
24 digs and five assists last Friday against
Washington State.
Colorado will enter Saturday's game with
some swagger, having upset No. 1 Washington
at home in a four-set victory a week ago. The
Buffs are 2-0 against ranked opponents over
all, having also defeated No. 11 UCLA in a
five-set match on Sept. 27.
Two players to watch are the Simpson sis
ters. Junior outside hitter Taylor Simpson had
a career-high 23 kills in last Sunday's win over
Washington State, and she's averaging 3.68
kills per set, which ranks eighth in the Pac-12.
True freshman libero Cierra Simpson, who de
cided to commit to Colorado after her sister

transferred there last year, leads the team
with 3.23 digs per set.
Stanford is 9-0 all time against the Buffs,
including a four-set victory last season on Sen
ior Night in Maples Pavilion.
The Card hopes to continue its recent
successes against Utah and Colorado to start a
new winning steak after having its eight
match streak snapped last Sunday at USC.
"Losing to USC was really tough. The
whole weekend, we couldn't stop thinking
about it," Wopat said. "We want to use that
loss to be a huge motivating factor and a turn
ing point in our season. Our goal is still to win
the national championship and we still believe
just as strongly that we can do it."
Stanford hosts Utah tonight at 6 p.m. and
then welcomes the Buffs for Saturday's 7 p.m.
showdown. Tonight's contest will be televised
on Pac-12 Networks.

well as first in the nation, with 3.10 blocks per
set. Stanford will look to take advantage of a
slight edge in size with its middle blockers, 6-
foot-2 senior Carly Wopat and 6-foot-3 sopho
more Inky Ajanaku, in order to counter Utah's
attack. The Utes are 12-1 in matches in which
they outblock their opponents, so there prom
ises to be a constant battle at the net.

Wopat, who leads the Pac-12 with 1.39
blocks per set and a .494 hitting percentage
(third nationally), noted that the team has
been focused especially on blocks this week.
"We've been doing a lot of defensive
drills covering, which is important for not
letting blocks drop," Wopat said, "and just get
ting after it offensively tooling the block,
seeing where the blockers are and hitting
away from them, and just being smart with

our shots."

Senior middle blocker Erin Redd-Bran
don, ranked second in the Pac-12 in blocks per
set, is one of the keys to the Utes' defensive
game. She also leads the Utes with a .337 hit
ting percentage. Junior libero Lea Adolph is
another Ute to watch, as she had a career-high
24 digs and five assists last Friday against
Washington State.
Colorado will enter Saturday's game with
some swagger, having upset No. 1 Washington
at home in a four-set victory a week ago. The
Buffs are 2-0 against ranked opponents over
all, having also defeated No. 11 UCLA in a
five-set match on Sept. 27.
Two players to watch are the Simpson sis
ters. Junior outside hitter Taylor Simpson had
a career-high 23 kills in last Sunday's win over
Washington State, and she's averaging 3.68
kills per set, which ranks eighth in the Pac-12.
True freshman libero Cierra Simpson, who de
cided to commit to Colorado after her sister

transferred there last year, leads the team
with 3.23 digs per set.
Stanford is 9-0 all time against the Buffs,
including a four-set victory last season on Sen
ior Night in Maples Pavilion.
The Card hopes to continue its recent
successes against Utah and Colorado to start a
new winning steak after having its eight
match streak snapped last Sunday at USC.
"Losing to USC was really tough. The
whole weekend, we couldn't stop thinking
about it," Wopat said. "We want to use that
loss to be a huge motivating factor and a turn
ing point in our season. Our goal is still to win
the national championship and we still believe
just as strongly that we can do it."
Stanford hosts Utah tonight at 6 p.m. and
then welcomes the Buffs for Saturday's 7 p.m.
showdown. Tonight's contest will be televised
on Pac-12 Networks.

Coming off a Southern California road trip in
which it was swept in a match for the first time
since 2011 by No. 2 USC, Stanford women's vol
leyball is eager to return to the friendly confines
of Maples Pavilion, where it hasn't lost since Dec.
3, 2011.
The No. 8 Cardinal (10-3, 2-1 Pac-12) con
tinues its Pac-12 campaign tonight against the
unranked Utah Utes (13-3, 2-2) and on Saturday
against the unranked Colorado Buffaloes (11-3,
3-1).

Stanford and Utah met just in 2012, with the
Cardinal posting a four-set victory in Salt Lake City
as part of its 21-match winning streak. Despite
Utah advantages in hitting, team blocks and service
aces in the match, Stanford won three straight sets
after dropping the first to pull out the win.
Friday's match pairs two of the top three teams
in blocking in the Pac-12: The Utes rank third with
2.83 blocks per set and the Cardinal ranks first, as
