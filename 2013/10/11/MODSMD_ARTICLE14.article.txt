# Soccer streak hard to ignore
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
I will never forget my first Stanford women's
soccer match, a 7-0 win against Arizona in
which six Cardinal players scored and starting
goalie Emily Oliver didn't face a single shot
before being pulled in the 58th minute. I was
only a first-week freshman, but I could tell that
was pretty darn good.
Over two years have passed since that
match, and Stanford women's soccer is as dom
inant as ever. But the No. 2 Cardinal did some
thing on Sunday night that I've never witnessed,
no current Daily staffer has ever witnessed and,
most likely, no current undergrad has ever wit
nessed.

Stanford women's soccer lost at home.

Before the Cardinal's 1-0 overtime defeat at
the hands of Arizona State on Sunday, Stanford's
last home loss came in November 2007. For a
little perspective, that's when Jim Harbaughwas
in the middle of his first season as the school's
head football coach and Miley Cyrus was in
the middle of her second season as the star of
Hannah Montana.

In the nearly six years since that loss, the
Cardinal has won its first College Cup, taken
home three consecutive Hermann Trophies
and dominated just about everyone who has
dared brave the Farm. Other streaks were
snapped on Sunday as well, among them the
team's 44-match winning streak in conference
play, but none of them was as impressive as
Stanford's perfect defense of its home turf.
Seventy teams had filed into Cagan both
the old stadium and its renovated counterpart

and 70 had been
sent packing.
"I don't think
[the streak] will be
replicated," head
coach Paul Ratcliffe
told GoStanford.com
on Sunday. But even

though so many intan
gibles had to come together for Stanford to go
on its 70-match, 70-month run, it's not hard to
quantify just how incredible the streak was.
Consider:
70-0-3: Stanford's home record between
its losses to Connecticut (Nov. 23, 2007) and
Arizona State (Oct. 6, 2013). Only North Car
olina's 84-match home unbeaten streak,
dating from 1986-94, tops the Cardinal's
73-match run in Division I women's soc
cer history. Another prominent Cardinal
team, women's basketball, holds the sec
ond-longest home winning streak in the
Division I history of its own sport (82
games). That run also began in 2007, and
it was also bookended by a loss to UConn

though the Huskies beat the Cardinal at the
end, not the beginning, of the streak.
2.79: Average margin of victory for the
Cardinal at home during the streak. Stanford
scored at least three goals in 45 of those 73
matches, all the while allowing just 30 goals
at Cagan in six years. By contrast, the Cardi
nal men's soccer team has given up 30 goals
at home in just two years, dating back to

Oct. 14, 2011.
46: The number of shutouts recorded
by the Cardinal at Cagan during that stretch.
How tough is that to pull off in just 73
matches? As a rough comparison, only 10
goalies in MLS history have recorded more
than 46 shutouts over their careers, and
each of them has played in at least 189
matches.

14: Number of one-goal wins by Stan
ford at Cagan during the streak. The Cardi
nal won three of those matches in overtime,
including the Elite Eight win against Oklaho
ma State in the middle of Stanford's 2011
College Cup run.
Ratcliffe is right that the Cardinal prob
ably won't be able to duplicate its historic
run; the team lost again last night to No. 2
UCLA on its home turf. But in any case, it's
going to be at least six more years before Stan
ford women's soccer can top its own impres
sive feat. On a campus so full of greatness that
it's easy to let events like this slip through the
cracks, let's take a second to simply recognize
the enormity of Stanford women's soccer's ac
complishment.
Few teams in the country have been this
dominant for this long. We can put up with a
loss every now and then.
