## Defying gender relations Protagonist in "Wadjda" rebels against Saudi gender and cultural norms 
### GILLIE COLLINS 
"Wadjda" is the first feature-length film
both shot entirely in Saudi Arabia and di
rected by a Saudi woman and Saudi Ara
bia's first Oscar nomination for best foreign
film.

The film is powerful because its hero
ine, Wadjda, is powerful: She is a clever, en
terprising 10-year-old girl whose gumption
cannot be contained by her burka (a full
body cloak worn by Muslim women), her
parents or her madrassa (school). She lives
with her mother (Reem Abdullah) and mostly
absentee father (Sultan A1 Assaf) in a suburb
outside Riyadh, the nation's capital. There,
she wears high-top Converse sneakers to
school, listens to American pop music and
sells bracelets illicitly. More than anything,
Wadjda wants to buy a bike to race her closest
friend, Abdullah (Abdullrahman A1 Gohani).
When she sees a green bike strapped to
the roof of a truck peeking out from behind
a roadside wall, Wadjda follows it to a local
toyshop. There, she discovers that bike costs
800 riyal, far outside her family's price
range. Despite her mother's warnings that
biking jeopardizes female fertility, Wadjda
commits herself to various moneymaking
schemes in order to purchase her bike. She
sells mix tapes and agrees to carry notes be
tween clandestine lovers.

The trope of the bicycle as a vehicle of
freedom is by no means original, but maybe
that's part of the point. "Wadjda" inevitably
recalls Vittorio Di Sica's classic "The Bicycle
Thief" and, more recently, the Dardenne
brothers' "The Kid With the Bike." But in a
country where women cannot drive Wad
jda's mother depends on male drivers for
everyday mobility a bike is a particularly
exciting emblem of autonomy.
In fact, as Wadjda attempts to define an
identity in conversation with her parents' val
ues and expectations, her story reminds us
that the turbulence of teenage years is uni
versal. From her eye rolls delivered to her
parents across the kitchen table to tearstains

of frustrated self-expression, Wadjda's vivid
facial expressions are as imminently relatable
as her teenage rebellion: She develops pref
erences for clothing, friends and hobbies
contrary to her parent's wishes.
A1 Monsoura unveils the hypocrisies
embedded in strict gender norms, critiquing
conventional Western narratives about gen
der issues in the Middle East by showing
that women are not passive victims in Saudi
society. Wadjda's school principal, for in
stance, comes closest to serving as the
movie's villain by enforcing a strict behav
ioral code in the school hallways and on the
playground.
At the same time, she dresses in West
ern clothing, wears make-up and is even ru
mored to have a boyfriend. There are no easy
male-female, oppressor-victim categories in
this film; instead, women actively elaborate
and challenge gender roles and religious doc
trine.

In the film's expansive beige-colored
cityscapes, women move around anony
mously, as silhouettes of themselves. In the
intimate warmth of the kitchen and bed
room, on the other hand, Wadjda's mother
comes into her voice, singing songs while
she prepares dinner or talking with friends
on the phone. In one scene, Wadjda and her
mother stand on the roof of their building.
Below them, community political leaders
and their all-male followers are gathering,
epitomizing the consolidation of public de
cision-making authority among Saudi men.
From their open-air sanctuary however,
Wadjda and her mother are positioned to
gaze back at the men from above.
"Wadjda" is a quietly affecting portrait
of girl and society in the midst of transition.
We sense the director's own subtle subver
sion and unyielding hope for Saudi society. For
100 minutes, we see this optimism embodied
in a mother-daughter embrace, a green bike
and a young, hungry human spirit.

"Wadjda," Saudi Arabia's first Oscar nomination for best foreign film, features a 10-year-old
girl who defies societal expectations by wearing Converse sneakers and buying a bike.
"Wadjda" is the first feature-length film
both shot entirely in Saudi Arabia and di
rected by a Saudi woman and Saudi Ara
bia's first Oscar nomination for best foreign
film.

The film is powerful because its hero
ine, Wadjda, is powerful: She is a clever, en
terprising 10-year-old girl whose gumption
cannot be contained by her burka (a full
body cloak worn by Muslim women), her
parents or her madrassa (school). She lives
with her mother (Reem Abdullah) and mostly
absentee father (Sultan A1 Assaf) in a suburb
outside Riyadh, the nation's capital. There,
she wears high-top Converse sneakers to
school, listens to American pop music and
sells bracelets illicitly. More than anything,
Wadjda wants to buy a bike to race her closest
friend, Abdullah (Abdullrahman A1 Gohani).
When she sees a green bike strapped to
the roof of a truck peeking out from behind
a roadside wall, Wadjda follows it to a local
toyshop. There, she discovers that bike costs
800 riyal, far outside her family's price
range. Despite her mother's warnings that
biking jeopardizes female fertility, Wadjda
commits herself to various moneymaking
schemes in order to purchase her bike. She
sells mix tapes and agrees to carry notes be
tween clandestine lovers.

The trope of the bicycle as a vehicle of
freedom is by no means original, but maybe
that's part of the point. "Wadjda" inevitably
recalls Vittorio Di Sica's classic "The Bicycle
Thief" and, more recently, the Dardenne
brothers' "The Kid With the Bike." But in a
country where women cannot drive Wad
jda's mother depends on male drivers for
everyday mobility a bike is a particularly
exciting emblem of autonomy.
In fact, as Wadjda attempts to define an
identity in conversation with her parents' val
ues and expectations, her story reminds us
that the turbulence of teenage years is uni
versal. From her eye rolls delivered to her
parents across the kitchen table to tearstains

of frustrated self-expression, Wadjda's vivid
facial expressions are as imminently relatable
as her teenage rebellion: She develops pref
erences for clothing, friends and hobbies
contrary to her parent's wishes.
