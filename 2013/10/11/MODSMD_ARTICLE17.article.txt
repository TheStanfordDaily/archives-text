# fashion on the farm: fall fashion essentials
## 
### KEYA TEKLU FASHION COLUMNIST 
Greetings, fellow fashion
istas! Allow me to intro
duce myself: I'm Keya Tek
lu, one of the Weekender's
resident fashion colum
nists, and today I'm here to

give a little lesson on sweater weather. That's
right, it's time to say goodbye to flip-flops,
tank tops, and booty shorts. (Well, that's not
entirely true. This is California after all, and
I'm pretty sure you could get away with wear
ing all of these things well into December.)
Nevertheless, the fall season is finally upon
us, so I've taken it upon myself to list some of
this year's fall wardrobe essentials, and how
to wear them with style.
1. Sweaters: It's called "sweater weather"
for a reason. Nothing says cool, comfortable
and classy like a nice cable-knit sweater. If you
want to go oversized with it, go right ahead!
The larger the sweater, the more "effortlessly
cool" you'll look. One of my favorite things
about sweaters is how ridiculously easy they
are to style. Just pair them with leggings, jeg
gings or jeans, a funky statement necklace
and you're good to go. Or go sans-jewelry for
a simple-but-chic look. You literally can't go
wrong with sweaters, which is why they're
my number one.
2. Scarves: I must admit, I have a slight
weakness for scarves. And by slight, I mean
that if I see a scarf anywhere in my vicinity, I
will drop whatever I happen to be doing and
dive for that sucker like Tom Daley at the Lon
don Olympics. But can you blame me?

Scarves are perfect for fall, and what's really
special about them is that you can wear
scarves 365 days a year and still look appro
priate. They will never go out of style (the day
that happens, I might go on strike), and just
like sweaters, they are so easy to wear.
As Stanford students, we just don't have
the time to dilly-dally every morning trying to
figure out what to wear. For most of us, leav
ing our dorms fully clothed is an accomplish
ment on it's own. Ain't nobody got time fo
dat! Scarves understand this. Scarves feel the
struggles we face every morning trying to
look presentable, and they comfort us by
looking good with just about anything. T-shirt
and jeans? Add a scarf to transform boring
and plain to exciting and trendy. How do
scarves work in such powerful and mysteri
ous ways? It's actually not that mysterious.
They simply add instant texture, print and col
or to an outfit, making the look more aesthet
ically pleasing. There is a certain science be
hind putting together an interesting outfit,
and scarves are the best "enzymes" (can you
tell I'm a Humßio major?).

3. Boots: No fall-inspired outfit is truly com
plete without a nice pair of boots. The great
thing about this wardrobe essential is that
there are plenty of styles to choose from: rid
ing boots (by far the most popular choice for
fall attire), ankle boots, high-heeled boots,
leather boots, over-the knee boots, cowboy
boots the list goes on and on. You can re
ally customize as much as you want with
boots, and you'll still look appropriately "fall."

4. Trench coats: Nothing,
and I mean nothing, is classier
than a person in a trench coat.
Think of the most sophisticated
human being on planet Earth,
and they will probably be wear
ing a trench coat right now. Al
though it isn't quite cold
enough here during the day to
comfortably pull them off, Stan
ford nights were made for
trench coats. The best thing
about them is that you don't
need to put as much effort into
the rest of your outfit. As long
as you're wearing that trench
coat, it really doesn't matter
what you wear underneath (pa
jamas, sweats, even nothing at
all —if you're into that). It is

the perfect piece to complete a
look super put-together without
actually putting in the effort.

5. Leather: I know this is a
controversial wardrobe essen
tial, especially considering the
vastly different opinions people
have on leather. (Some argue
that if we use animals for food,
why not for fashion, while oth
ers feel that manufacturing
leather is unnecessary and cru
el to animals, and that vegan
leather is a much friendlier al
ternative. However, some say
that even purchasing vegan
leather still supports the leather
industry by perpetuating the
look of leather in street fash
ion.)

Politics aside, leather is a
great way to transition yourself
into the fall season. It's warm,
classic and adds a hint of edge
to any outfit. I wear strictly veg

an leather (mostly because I'm
broke), and it can be worn in a
multitude of ways. Leather jack
ets are a popular choice, but
most recently the trend has
been to incorporate leather into
bottoms, such as skater skirts
and leggings. Adding leather to
an outfit will unequivocally
state to the world that you are
ready for fall.

That's all for my list of fall
wardrobe essentials. It is, of
course, by no means exhaus
tive, and there are many other
clothing items that are staples
for the fall time, but I hope you
will have a fun time styling
these classic pieces in the up
coming months. I can't wait to
see some fine-looking fashion
on the Farm!

as you're wearing that trench
coat, it really doesn't matter
what you wear underneath (pa
jamas, sweats, even nothing at
all —if you're into that). It is

the perfect piece to complete a
look super put-together without
actually putting in the effort.

5. Leather: I know this is a
controversial wardrobe essen
tial, especially considering the
vastly different opinions people
have on leather. (Some argue
that if we use animals for food,
why not for fashion, while oth
ers feel that manufacturing
leather is unnecessary and cru
el to animals, and that vegan
leather is a much friendlier al
ternative. However, some say
that even purchasing vegan
leather still supports the leather
industry by perpetuating the
look of leather in street fash
ion.)

Politics aside, leather is a
great way to transition yourself
into the fall season. It's warm,
classic and adds a hint of edge
to any outfit. I wear strictly veg

an leather (mostly because I'm
broke), and it can be worn in a
multitude of ways. Leather jack
ets are a popular choice, but
most recently the trend has
been to incorporate leather into
bottoms, such as skater skirts
and leggings. Adding leather to
an outfit will unequivocally
state to the world that you are
ready for fall.

That's all for my list of fall
wardrobe essentials. It is, of
course, by no means exhaus
tive, and there are many other
clothing items that are staples
for the fall time, but I hope you
will have a fun time styling
these classic pieces in the up
coming months. I can't wait to
see some fine-looking fashion
on the Farm!

Greetings, fellow fashion
istas! Allow me to intro
duce myself: I'm Keya Tek
lu, one of the Weekender's
resident fashion colum
nists, and today I'm here to

give a little lesson on sweater weather. That's
right, it's time to say goodbye to flip-flops,
tank tops, and booty shorts. (Well, that's not
entirely true. This is California after all, and
I'm pretty sure you could get away with wear
ing all of these things well into December.)
Nevertheless, the fall season is finally upon
us, so I've taken it upon myself to list some of
this year's fall wardrobe essentials, and how
to wear them with style.
1. Sweaters: It's called "sweater weather"
for a reason. Nothing says cool, comfortable
and classy like a nice cable-knit sweater. If you
want to go oversized with it, go right ahead!
The larger the sweater, the more "effortlessly
cool" you'll look. One of my favorite things
about sweaters is how ridiculously easy they
are to style. Just pair them with leggings, jeg
gings or jeans, a funky statement necklace
and you're good to go. Or go sans-jewelry for
a simple-but-chic look. You literally can't go
wrong with sweaters, which is why they're
my number one.
2. Scarves: I must admit, I have a slight
weakness for scarves. And by slight, I mean
that if I see a scarf anywhere in my vicinity, I
will drop whatever I happen to be doing and
dive for that sucker like Tom Daley at the Lon
don Olympics. But can you blame me?

Scarves are perfect for fall, and what's really
special about them is that you can wear
scarves 365 days a year and still look appro
priate. They will never go out of style (the day
that happens, I might go on strike), and just
like sweaters, they are so easy to wear.
As Stanford students, we just don't have
the time to dilly-dally every morning trying to
figure out what to wear. For most of us, leav
ing our dorms fully clothed is an accomplish
ment on it's own. Ain't nobody got time fo
dat! Scarves understand this. Scarves feel the
struggles we face every morning trying to
look presentable, and they comfort us by
looking good with just about anything. T-shirt
and jeans? Add a scarf to transform boring
and plain to exciting and trendy. How do
scarves work in such powerful and mysteri
ous ways? It's actually not that mysterious.
They simply add instant texture, print and col
or to an outfit, making the look more aesthet
ically pleasing. There is a certain science be
hind putting together an interesting outfit,
and scarves are the best "enzymes" (can you
tell I'm a Humßio major?).

3. Boots: No fall-inspired outfit is truly com
plete without a nice pair of boots. The great
thing about this wardrobe essential is that
there are plenty of styles to choose from: rid
ing boots (by far the most popular choice for
fall attire), ankle boots, high-heeled boots,
leather boots, over-the knee boots, cowboy
boots the list goes on and on. You can re
ally customize as much as you want with
boots, and you'll still look appropriately "fall."

4. Trench coats: Nothing,
and I mean nothing, is classier
than a person in a trench coat.
Think of the most sophisticated
human being on planet Earth,
and they will probably be wear
ing a trench coat right now. Al
though it isn't quite cold
enough here during the day to
comfortably pull them off, Stan
ford nights were made for
trench coats. The best thing
about them is that you don't
need to put as much effort into
the rest of your outfit. As long
as you're wearing that trench
coat, it really doesn't matter
what you wear underneath (pa
jamas, sweats, even nothing at
