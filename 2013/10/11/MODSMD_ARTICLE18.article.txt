# Roxy Sass: How to stay safe in the bedroom
## 
### ROXY SASS 
In the wake of the recent Stanford comput
er hack and ever-increasing numbers of
late-night SU Alert texts, it seems every
one is talking about safety, and Roxy is no
exception. She's got some tips for staying
safe where it really matters... in the bed
room.
1. First off, some security of a more social
kind. As much as Roxy supports her room
mates' sexual endeavors (she's got that wing
woman shit on lock), she doesn't need to wit
ness it firsthand when lecture finishes a bit
early. Whether it's a quick text to the roomie
or a sock on the door, make sure the logistics
are covered before you get beneath the cov
ers.

2. Don't get her wrong, Roxy's no slouch when
it comes to inventive moves, but she's also no
gymnast, so sometimes a bit of stretching is in

order. Stay limber by taking a one-unit yoga
class at Arrillaga it can add some peace to a
hectic schedule during the day and make sure
you don't pull any muscles later that night.
3. Avoid any unfortunate accidents and make
sure the screws of your bedframe are tight
ened after any lofting adjustments. The only
things you want to fall down tonight are your
panties...

4. And, of course, Roxy's No.l safe sex tip:
protection, protection, protection. Hit up the
SHPRC or your PHE for condoms (they're
free!). And take a quick field trip with your
partner to Vaden to get screened for STDs, so
you can get back to playing doctor with no
worries.
