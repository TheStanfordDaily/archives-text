## ALL SHOOK UP Massive earthquakes in 1906 and 1989 forced campus to rebuild 
### MOLLY VORWERCK MANAGING EDITOR 
Early in the morning of April 18,
1906, Stanford community members
were asleep in their beds when a massive
earthquake shook them awake. The 7.8-
magnitude shaker, known as "the Great
Earthquake," lasted for a 20 seconds and
caused tremendous damage throughout
the Bay Area, including two deaths at
Stanford.

Eighty-three years later, history re
peated itself. A 6.9-magnitude earthquake
shook Stanford apart at 5:04 p.m. Al

dollars of damage.

disasters in Stanford history.

brought 300 scantily clad men into the
corridors in a mad rush for safety and
open air" while "the cries of the victims
buried in the ruins of the collapsed third
floor were plainly audible."
Two men perished in the quake: Ju
nius R. Hanna 'OB, and Otto Gerdis, a
campus fireman. Hanna, a resident of
Encina Hall then an all-male residence
â€”was crushed to death when a chimney
fell through the building's roof. Gerdis
was in a campus utility tower attempting
to turn off the school's steam and electric
ity circuits when the building collapsed on
him. Six other students sustained major
