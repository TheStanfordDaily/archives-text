## ALL SHOOK UP Massive earthquakes in 1906 and 1989 forced campus to rebuild 
### MOLLY VORWERCK MANAGING EDITOR 
Early in the morning of April 18,
1906, Stanford community members
were asleep in their beds when a massive
earthquake shook them awake. The 7.8-
magnitude shaker, known as "the Great
Earthquake," lasted for a 20 seconds and
caused tremendous damage throughout
the Bay Area, including two deaths at
Stanford.

Eighty-three years later, history re
peated itself. A 6.9-magnitude earthquake
shook Stanford apart at 5:04 p.m. Al
though no deaths were reported on cam
pus, the earthquake caused millions of
dollars of damage.
As a result of its California location,
the Farm is near two major faults: the San
Andreas and Hayward lines. Although a
number of smaller quakes have struck
campus throughout the years, the Great
Earthquake of 1906 and the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake tower above all other
disasters in Stanford history.

Structures razed and lives lost

At approximately 5:07 a.m. on April 18,
1906, the Great Earthquake struck Palo Al
to.
According to a Daily Palo Alto (now
The Stanford Daily) article titled "Magnif

icent Structures Razed and Two Lives
Lost" published the day of the earth
quake, "the first shock in Encina Hall
brought 300 scantily clad men into the
corridors in a mad rush for safety and
open air" while "the cries of the victims
buried in the ruins of the collapsed third
floor were plainly audible."
Two men perished in the quake: Ju
nius R. Hanna 'OB, and Otto Gerdis, a
campus fireman. Hanna, a resident of
Encina Hall then an all-male residence
—was crushed to death when a chimney
fell through the building's roof. Gerdis
was in a campus utility tower attempting
to turn off the school's steam and electric
ity circuits when the building collapsed on
him. Six other students sustained major

injuries.
David Starr Jordan, the Univer
sity President at the time, released a
statement in the Daily Palo Alto re
garding the university's next course
of action. He began his commentary
by focusing on the sad, but slightly
uplifting, circumstances of Hanna
and Gerdis' deaths: Despite these
tragedies, he said, "had the earth
quake taken place in the daytime,
the loss of life would have been ap
palling."
Jordan anticipated that the dam
age would total $2.8 million ($73.7
million today) and hoped that
"oldjerj" and "rich" alumni would
contribute to the reconstruction ef
forts. Jordan's prediction was rough
ly $1 million over the mark.
According to Daniel Hartwig,
the University's current archivist,
there was around $1.75 million
(over $44.7 million today) worth of
damage across campus. Damage in
the inner quad the construction
of which was had been scrupulously
overseen by Leland Stanford before
his death in 1893 — totaled to
roughly $50,000.
The other sections of campus, in
cluding the outer quad, Memorial
Church and the museum experi
enced approximately $1.7 million of
damage because they were not as ad
equately prepared for earthquakes.
"They started [reconstruction]
on the outer quad that summer, in
cluding the library, the physics cor
ner and the assembly hall, finishing
renovations a year later," Hartwig
said. "Rebuilding the church, which
was badly damaged, was put off and
was much more expensive, started
in 1908 and lasted until 1917."

The day after the earthquake,
Jordan closed the University for the
remainder of the quarter and sent all
students home. However, many
chose to stick around for the sum
mer in order to volunteer for relief
efforts in San Francisco. According
to Hartwig, Stanford students partic
ipated in Camp Stanford in the City,
a project that helped provide food
and build shelters for people affect-

Ed by the earthquake.
The school did not reopen until
late August of that same year when
fall quarter commenced and the sen
iors, known as "the Calamity Class,"
were able to graduate.
Despite the need for extra in
come, the college continued to offer
free admission to all students, a prac
tice that was discontinued in the
19305, and received most of their ren
ovation funds from private donations.

The quake televised 'round the
world

The Loma Prieta Earthquake of
1989 struck on Oct. 17, just before
the third game of the 1989 World
Series. Coincidentally, it was the
Northern California teams, the Oak
land Athletics and the San Francisco
Giants, that were competing for the
championship.
Richard Gillam '65 Ph.D. '72, a
professor of American Studies, was
at home watching the game when
the 6.9-magnitude quake hit the Bay
at 5:04 p.m.
"My daughter was down the
street, and she came running out of
the neighbor's house and back to
home," Gillam said. "It took some

The 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake struck campus at approximately 5:04 p.m so students were dispersed around
campus. The quake hit right before Game 3 of the 1989 World Series between the As and the Giants was set to begin.
small amount of time to calm her
down and convince her that the
world was not falling."

In contrast to the 1906 earth
quake, the disaster struck at the end
of the day, and so most students
were dispersed across campus.
Although Loma Prieta did not
result in nearly as much destruction
as the 1906 disaster, renovation
fees totaled $l6O million (nearly
$302 million today). No deaths or
injuries were reported, although
students and staff alike certainly felt
its seismic waves.

Mark Lawrence '67, KZSU's
chief engineer, was working at the
radio station's transmitter site near
the Dish when the quake hit. In the

middle of tinkering with a piece of
equipment, Lawrence suddenly fell
on his rear end. After realizing what
had happened, Lawrence rushed
back to the station's headquarters in
the basement of Memorial Auditori
um to assess any potential damage.
Back at the station, a broadcast
er announcing a news report had
rapidly adjusted the content to in
clude word of the quake. KZSU was
the only radio station on the air in
the Bay Area —if only for a few
minutes.

"The reason for that is not only
that we have a backup generator,
but also battery power supply on
the transmitter," Lawrence said.
"We didn't lose power on campus,
but we did lose power at the trans
mitter for half a day."
Like the 1906 earthquake,
however, Memorial Church and the

main library (now Green Library)
were two of the most damaged loca
tions. The church was closed for
renovation until 1992, and the li
brary didn't reopen until 1999.
In the quake's immediate after
math, many buildings were evacuat
ed until a team of engineers could
determine whether or not they
were safe to occupy. Fortunately,
many of them were.
Despite the damage, Monica
Moore '7l, a longtime campus ad
ministrator, found a silver lining in
the way that the campus united af
ter the disaster. Smaller programs
shared office space and faculty held
classes outside students even
utilized construction spaces as out
lets for creativity.
'After the earthquake, they put
up these big plywood supports on
the arches, and then the Studio Art

students came out and painted
them," Moore said. "They were
kind of big, bright and colorful, sort
of abstract mostly, and I just thought
we should keep them there as pub
lic art, but they took them down
once they retrofitted the arches."

Preparing for the future
In the years since Loma Prieta,
Stanford has done much to ramp up
its earthquake safety precautions,
particularly in light of scientific pre
dictions for another shaker in the
near future.

After the disastrous earthquake
that struck Honshu, Japan, on
March, 11, 2011, Stanford seismol
ogists became concerned with the
Hayward fault, which is reaching the
end of its average fault slip cycle of
140 years.
'After the 1989 Earthquake,

Stanford became much more
adamant about being earthquake
safe," Hartwig said.
Stanford's next step towards
earthquake preparedness will be de
molishing Meyer Library, a campus
staple for late-night studying since
1966.

"[Recently], there was analysis
done and the cost was determined
to be prohibitive, so rather than up
grade and reuse Meyer, it was bet
ter to tear it down," Hartwig said.
For the Stanford community,
the end of Meyer, which university
officials have proposed to demolish
in 2015, will mark a step towards
earthquake preparedness, even if
such disasters can never be truly pre
dicted.
