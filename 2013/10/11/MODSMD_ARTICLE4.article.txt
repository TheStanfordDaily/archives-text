## SUDPS warns of biking dangers

Hundreds of vehicles zoom
around a circle, trying to avoid
each other and reach their desti
nations as quickly as possible. No,
it's not NASCAR, it's Stanford's
notorious "circle of death," the
traffic circle near the Clock Tower
that is perennially clogged with bi
cyclists during peak traffic times.
Deputy Allen James of the
Stanford University Department
of Public Safety (SUDPS) uses an
apocalyptic film to describe anoth
er treacherous intersection

Serra Street and Arguello Way
near the Knight Management
Center.

"[Watching 'World War Z'\
would give you a good idea of

what the Serra and Arguello
Street intersection is like at 10
minutes of the hour," James said.
"It's pretty much crazy."
According to SUDPS Deputy
Chris Mclntyre, these two loca
tions are among those where bike
traffic laws are most frequently
flouted.

Mclntyre is one of five
deputies who regularly patrol the
campus on bikes.
"We're out there at the inter
sections, especially the [problem
atic] ones, and we're writing cita
tions," Mclntyre said. "Our rea
son is not to be punitive, but to
get that point across: Safety is our
goal, and education if that's


ZETONG LI/The Stanford Daily
According to the Stanford University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS), approximately 300 cyclists are
injured on campus each year. SUDPS estimates that only 11 percent of undergraduates wear bicycle helmets.

volume of bike traffic during passing times. Cyclists are supposed to travel counter-clockwise but many do not.
what's needed."

Although the SUDPS keeps
statistics on bicycle collisions, it's
difficult to know the exact num
bers because accidents are widely
underreported, according to James.
"We don't really trust [the sta
tistics] too much, because most
people do not report the acci
dents," he said. "We maybe get 10
percent [of accidents] reported to
us."

James estimated that more
than 300 cyclists are seriously in
jured while riding on campus each
year.

Safe Biking Practices
Mclntyre advised that stop
ping at stop signs and being aware
of one's surroundings are the two
most important steps cyclists
should follow to be safe while riding
on campus.

"If you do those two things,"
Mclntyre said, "you will probably
make it through your time here
without significant injury."
Mclntyre also said that cyclists
should maintain their brakes, keep
tires properly inflated and anticipate
possible mistakes by other cyclists
or drivers.
"And don't hit things," added
James.
James said that in 2011-2012,
SUDPS issued 1680 bicycle cita
tions.

In an effort to encourage safe
biking practices, James started the
department's bike diversion pro
gram in 2008. Under the program,
those who receive citations for vio
lating bike traffic laws may, once
every 18 months, attend a safety
class in lieu of paying the fine for
their citations.

To date, more than 3,500 peo
ple have attended the bike diversion
program's safety classes, which are
also open to the public. Those inter
ested in attending may sign up on
the SUDPS website.
"Our enforcement efforts
aren't intended to be punitive,"

Mclntyre said. "They are intended
to be educational and safety-based.
We take far too many people to the
hospital due to these types of
things. Almost every time, it is the
cyclist's fault."

Protecting students' brains
James also highlighted the im
portance of wearing a helmet while
riding a bike. According to the De
partment of Parking and Transporta
tion Services, just 11 percent of
undergraduates wear helmets con
sistently, while 40 percent of grad
uate students wear them.

Several University organiza
tions have partnered to subsidize
helmet purchases for freshmen.
Residents of all freshmen dormito
ries may purchase a $3O-$4O hel
met for a subsidized price of $5.
Other members of the Stanford
community can purchase subsi
dized helmets for up to a 40 per
cent discount at the Campus Bike
Shop.

According to Bicycle Program
Coordinator Ariadne Scott, the
program was launched by Kali Lind
say ' 12, who suffered a brain injury
after a bike crash. Scott said Lind
say began sharing her story to en
courage students to wear helmets
for every ride, no matter how long.
The helmet subsidy is supple
mented by the Bike Safety Dorm
Challenge, in which freshman
dorms compete for the largest
number and greatest proportion of
residents signing a pledge to obey
traffic laws and wear a helmet
while riding.
The competition will run until
Dec. 17. On that date, the dorms
leading in each category will re
ceive a free bus charter to Lake
Tahoe. At press time, the Fresh-

Man-Sophomore College (FroSO'
Co) was leading in both categories.

Some students don't need an
incentive to wear a helmet.
Eric Smalls 'l6 said that he
started wearing his helmet at the
urging of a friend after his fresh
man year.

"I think it's really important to
have bike safety," Smalls said.
Smalls noted that students are put
ting such an investment in their
time at Stanford that it would be a
mistake not to protect themselves.

Nick Xu ' 15, a resident advisor
in Twain, described similar reasons
for his own decision to start wear
ing a helmet.
"What's the most precious
thing that I possess?" Xu asked.
"It's the thing between my ears. So
why am I not protecting it proper
ly?"

First-year graduate student
Therice Morris agreed. "I'm here
for my brain, and I want to keep it
safe."

Xu described the difficulties
he has encountered while trying to
persuade others to wear their hel
mets.

"No matter how much you
preach, you're not really going to
convince others," Xu said. He said
that he now tries to lead by exam
ple by consistently wearing his hel
met, even for the shortest of trips.
For many, seeing the conse
quences firsthand is the most ef
fective stimulus.

"Two people in my dorm al
ready got into accidents in the past
week," said Jessica Zhao 'l7, "so I
just want to wear a helmet to be
safe."

Coordinator Ariadne Scott, the
program was launched by Kali Lind
say ' 12, who suffered a brain injury
after a bike crash. Scott said Lind
say began sharing her story to en
courage students to wear helmets
for every ride, no matter how long.
The helmet subsidy is supple
mented by the Bike Safety Dorm
Challenge, in which freshman
dorms compete for the largest
number and greatest proportion of
residents signing a pledge to obey
traffic laws and wear a helmet
while riding.
The competition will run until
Dec. 17. On that date, the dorms
leading in each category will re
ceive a free bus charter to Lake
Tahoe. At press time, the Fresh-

Man-Sophomore College (FroSO'
Co) was leading in both categories.

Some students don't need an
incentive to wear a helmet.
Eric Smalls 'l6 said that he
started wearing his helmet at the
urging of a friend after his fresh
man year.

"I think it's really important to
have bike safety," Smalls said.
Smalls noted that students are put
ting such an investment in their
time at Stanford that it would be a
mistake not to protect themselves.

Nick Xu ' 15, a resident advisor
in Twain, described similar reasons
for his own decision to start wear
ing a helmet.
"What's the most precious
thing that I possess?" Xu asked.
"It's the thing between my ears. So
why am I not protecting it proper
ly?"

First-year graduate student
Therice Morris agreed. "I'm here
for my brain, and I want to keep it
safe."

Xu described the difficulties
he has encountered while trying to
persuade others to wear their hel
mets.

"No matter how much you
preach, you're not really going to
convince others," Xu said. He said
that he now tries to lead by exam
ple by consistently wearing his hel
met, even for the shortest of trips.
For many, seeing the conse
quences firsthand is the most ef
fective stimulus.

"Two people in my dorm al
ready got into accidents in the past
week," said Jessica Zhao 'l7, "so I
just want to wear a helmet to be
safe."

it's not NASCAR, it's Stanford's
notorious "circle of death," the
traffic circle near the Clock Tower
that is perennially clogged with bi
cyclists during peak traffic times.
Deputy Allen James of the
Stanford University Department
of Public Safety (SUDPS) uses an
apocalyptic film to describe anoth

Serra Street and Arguello Way
near the Knight Management
Center.

"[Watching 'World War Z'\
would give you a good idea of

what the Serra and Arguello
Street intersection is like at 10
minutes of the hour," James said.
"It's pretty much crazy."
According to SUDPS Deputy
Chris Mclntyre, these two loca
tions are among those where bike
traffic laws are most frequently
flouted.

Mclntyre is one of five
deputies who regularly patrol the
campus on bikes.
"We're out there at the inter

According to the Stanford University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS), approximately 300 cyclists are
injured on campus each year. SUDPS estimates that only 11 percent of undergraduates wear bicycle helmets.

what's needed."

Although the SUDPS keeps
statistics on bicycle collisions, it's
difficult to know the exact num
bers because accidents are widely
underreported, according to James.
"We don't really trust [the sta
tistics] too much, because most
people do not report the acci
dents," he said. "We maybe get 10
percent [of accidents] reported to
us."

James estimated that more
than 300 cyclists are seriously in
jured while riding on campus each
year.

Safe Biking Practices
Mclntyre advised that stop
ping at stop signs and being aware
of one's surroundings are the two
most important steps cyclists
should follow to be safe while riding
on campus.

"If you do those two things,"
Mclntyre said, "you will probably
make it through your time here
without significant injury."
Mclntyre also said that cyclists
should maintain their brakes, keep
tires properly inflated and anticipate
possible mistakes by other cyclists
or drivers.
"And don't hit things," added
James.
James said that in 2011-2012,
SUDPS issued 1680 bicycle cita
tions.

In an effort to encourage safe
biking practices, James started the
department's bike diversion pro
gram in 2008. Under the program,
those who receive citations for vio
lating bike traffic laws may, once
every 18 months, attend a safety
class in lieu of paying the fine for
their citations.

To date, more than 3,500 peo
ple have attended the bike diversion
program's safety classes, which are
also open to the public. Those inter
ested in attending may sign up on
the SUDPS website.
"Our enforcement efforts
aren't intended to be punitive,"

Mclntyre said. "They are intended
to be educational and safety-based.
We take far too many people to the
hospital due to these types of
things. Almost every time, it is the
cyclist's fault."

Protecting students' brains
James also highlighted the im
portance of wearing a helmet while
riding a bike. According to the De
partment of Parking and Transporta
tion Services, just 11 percent of
undergraduates wear helmets con
sistently, while 40 percent of grad
uate students wear them.

Several University organiza
tions have partnered to subsidize
helmet purchases for freshmen.
Residents of all freshmen dormito
ries may purchase a $3O-$4O hel
met for a subsidized price of $5.
Other members of the Stanford
community can purchase subsi
dized helmets for up to a 40 per
cent discount at the Campus Bike
Shop.
