# Earthquake
## Preparedness By the Numbers 
### 
41 The number of building
evacuation drills conducted at
each residence on campus
each year. Emergency Manager
Keith Perry said that resident
assistants (RAs) are given train
ing on evacuation procedures,
which they are required to re
view with residents. In case of
emergency, students, faculty
and staff are supposed to con
gregate at emergency access
points if it is safe to do so.

/uu: The number of Uni
versity staff members who are
trained to conduct an exterior
assessment of the damage
done to buildings. According
to Perry, these volunteers can
use specific indicators to de
termine whether a building is
safe or unsafe to occupy. Train
ing for new volunteer asses
sors is offered every year, with
refresher courses offered
every two years.

2010: The last year the
University conducted a full
campus emergency drill. Perry
said the event helped raise
awareness about earthquake
preparations and forced the
community to consider their
evacuation routes and emer
gency assembly points. He
added that the University has
considered holding another
drill but has no imminent
plans to do so.

15,000: The number
of people the university could
supply with food and water for
up to three days in case of ex
tensive damage or long-term
power outage. According to
Perry, Arrillaga Dining has "a
very robust emergency power
program" to ensure that it can
continue providing food to the
campus community.
