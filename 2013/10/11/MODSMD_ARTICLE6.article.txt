## Tech. difficulties delay AlertSU test 
### LIAM KINNEY STAFF WRITER 
On July 18, there was an
armed robbery near Palm Drive
and Palo Road. On September
10, a sexual batter was reported
on Lake Lagunita path. And early
on the morning of Sept. 28, a
student named Joseph went
missing in some "tan bark" near
Bowdoin Street and Campus
Drive, but was found safely 30
minutes later.

The Stanford community
was alerted to these incidents
through text messages from the
AlertSU emergency notification
system, one of the ways the Stan
ford University Department of
Public Safety (SUDPS) helps keep
students informed about crime
and potential threats on campus.
According to Stanford police
spokesperson Bill Larson, the sys
tem is also part of Stanford's
compliance with the Clery Act, a
federal law that requires univer
sities to disclose information
about crime on campus.
The AlertSU technology
transmits a message to the entire
student body through a text mes
sage, email or transmission on
the KZSU student radio station.
There are only 10 people in
cluding the university president,
the director of the Stanford
News Service and the executive
director of IT services who
are qualified to send messages,
but approximately 40,000 people
receive them.

"We don't really believe that
we are going to have 40,000 peo
ple simultaneously become
aware of something," said Kathy
Harris, emergency manager and

community outreach coordinator
for SUDPS. "The rule of thumb
in emergency notification is the
rule of 60 percent."
The idea of emergency man
agement is that if you can reach
60 percent [of the community],
they're going to tell a colleague,"
Harris continued. "That's a pret
ty reasonable level of awareness
to expect from that kind of sys
tem."

Harris is one of the people
charged with selecting which
medium the messages go
through. On weekends, she
prefers to use text messages as
opposed to emails or posts on the
SUDPS Facebook page, "because
students are out and about."

However, Harris added that
text messages can be the most
unpredictable form of notifica
tion in the AlertSU arsenal.

"Students may receive them
at different times or not at all,"
Harris said. "The system sends
them out immediately, but we
have no control over how the cell
phone vendors batch them. We
have weekly meetings with our
vendors to make sure they're do
ing everything to expedite that."
The AlertSU system can also
be used to make sure people are
safe in case of emergency. Ac
cording to an email sent to the
student body, the Stanford Office
of Emergency Management is
scheduled to conduct a test of
the system on Oct. 11. Recipi
ents will be asked to respond to
specific questions to assess the
system's effectiveness in ac
counting for people during an ac
tual emergency.
The test was originally scheduled for
Oct 10., but according to an email sent to
the student body that afternoon by Emer
gency Manager Keith Perry, it was post
poned because of technical difficulties re
lated to the third-party vendor that Stan
ford contracts to send the messages.
According to Perry, accounting for
everybody on campus would be one of the
biggest challenges during an emergency like
an earthquake. Perry said that the electronic
system would work in conjunction with
physical check-ins at emergency assembly
points.

"If we don't have a response from
someone electronically," Perry said, "we
can try to track them down and get infor
mation about them from other channels."
While Larson and Harris will continue
their efforts to streamline the system, they
insist that the most valuable resource for
them is student cooperation. They encour
age students interested in emergency noti
fication and general campus safety to check
out the 2013 Safety, Security and Fire Re
port available at police.stanford.edu.

On July 18, there was an
armed robbery near Palm Drive
and Palo Road. On September
10, a sexual batter was reported
on Lake Lagunita path. And early
on the morning of Sept. 28, a
student named Joseph went
missing in some "tan bark" near
Bowdoin Street and Campus
Drive, but was found safely 30
minutes later.

The Stanford community
was alerted to these incidents
through text messages from the
AlertSU emergency notification
system, one of the ways the Stan
ford University Department of
Public Safety (SUDPS) helps keep
students informed about crime
and potential threats on campus.
According to Stanford police
spokesperson Bill Larson, the sys
tem is also part of Stanford's
compliance with the Clery Act, a
federal law that requires univer
sities to disclose information
about crime on campus.
The AlertSU technology
transmits a message to the entire
student body through a text mes
sage, email or transmission on
the KZSU student radio station.
There are only 10 people in
cluding the university president,
the director of the Stanford
News Service and the executive
director of IT services who
are qualified to send messages,
but approximately 40,000 people
receive them.

"We don't really believe that
we are going to have 40,000 peo
ple simultaneously become
aware of something," said Kathy
Harris, emergency manager and

community outreach coordinator
for SUDPS. "The rule of thumb
in emergency notification is the
rule of 60 percent."
The idea of emergency man
agement is that if you can reach
60 percent [of the community],
they're going to tell a colleague,"
Harris continued. "That's a pret
ty reasonable level of awareness
to expect from that kind of sys
tem."

Harris is one of the people
charged with selecting which
medium the messages go
through. On weekends, she
prefers to use text messages as
opposed to emails or posts on the
SUDPS Facebook page, "because
students are out and about."

However, Harris added that
text messages can be the most
unpredictable form of notifica
tion in the AlertSU arsenal.

"Students may receive them
at different times or not at all,"
Harris said. "The system sends
them out immediately, but we
have no control over how the cell
phone vendors batch them. We
have weekly meetings with our
vendors to make sure they're do
ing everything to expedite that."
The AlertSU system can also
be used to make sure people are
safe in case of emergency. Ac
cording to an email sent to the
student body, the Stanford Office
of Emergency Management is
scheduled to conduct a test of
the system on Oct. 11. Recipi
ents will be asked to respond to
specific questions to assess the
system's effectiveness in ac
counting for people during an ac
tual emergency.
The test was originally scheduled for
Oct 10., but according to an email sent to
the student body that afternoon by Emer
gency Manager Keith Perry, it was post
poned because of technical difficulties re
lated to the third-party vendor that Stan
ford contracts to send the messages.
According to Perry, accounting for
everybody on campus would be one of the
biggest challenges during an emergency like
an earthquake. Perry said that the electronic
system would work in conjunction with
physical check-ins at emergency assembly
points.

"If we don't have a response from
someone electronically," Perry said, "we
can try to track them down and get infor
mation about them from other channels."
While Larson and Harris will continue
their efforts to streamline the system, they
insist that the most valuable resource for
them is student cooperation. They encour
age students interested in emergency noti
fication and general campus safety to check

port available at police.stanford.edu.
