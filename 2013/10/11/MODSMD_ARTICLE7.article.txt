### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Columbine. Virginia Tech. Oikos.
The mention of all three places can elicit horrific
memories of a shooter wreaking havoc on a school, an
institution ideally considered a safe haven for youth.
Just yesterday, Sanjose State Universitywas put
on lockdown because of reports of a gunman on cam
pus. Although no gunman was found, the threat once
again illuminated the need to be on alert on campus.
Even at suburban Stanford, campus police are con
stantly working to prevent the next potential tragedy.

Emergency preparedness
Police spokesperson Bill Larson said the Stanford
University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS)

takes its responsibility to prepare for an active threat
a person with a gun, knife, explosive or other
weapon very seriously.
Larson said all SUDPS deputies go through reg
ular trainings on how to respond to a threat. He
added that one lesson learned from past school
shootings was that local law enforcement officers
cannot wait for SWAT or other forces to arrive to stop
the shooter.

"If there is an active shooter situation, the initial
riding deputies will go in and try to neutralize the
threat that's a big change [in policy]," Larson said.
Larson said that SUDPS is also working to create
tactical plans for different buildings across campus so
that officers will know ahead of time how to respond
