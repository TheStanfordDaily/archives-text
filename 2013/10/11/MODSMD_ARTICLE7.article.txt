# How Stanford preps for potential threats
## 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Columbine. Virginia Tech. Oikos.
The mention of all three places can elicit horrific
memories of a shooter wreaking havoc on a school, an
institution ideally considered a safe haven for youth.
Just yesterday, Sanjose State Universitywas put
on lockdown because of reports of a gunman on cam
pus. Although no gunman was found, the threat once
again illuminated the need to be on alert on campus.
Even at suburban Stanford, campus police are con
stantly working to prevent the next potential tragedy.

Emergency preparedness
Police spokesperson Bill Larson said the Stanford
University Department of Public Safety (SUDPS)

takes its responsibility to prepare for an active threat
a person with a gun, knife, explosive or other
weapon very seriously.
Larson said all SUDPS deputies go through reg
ular trainings on how to respond to a threat. He
added that one lesson learned from past school
shootings was that local law enforcement officers
cannot wait for SWAT or other forces to arrive to stop
the shooter.

"If there is an active shooter situation, the initial
riding deputies will go in and try to neutralize the
threat that's a big change [in policy]," Larson said.
Larson said that SUDPS is also working to create
tactical plans for different buildings across campus so
that officers will know ahead of time how to respond

to crises at different locations.

"[We do] an assessment of the
vulnerabilities and [determine] if
there was an active threat situation,
how would we approach the build
ing [and] how could we get into the
building," Larson said. "There are a
lot of buildings on campus so it will
take a lot of time, but we are actually
looking to put together tactical
plans."

Larson said SUDPS also works
in collaboration with Emergency
Management and senior administra
tors to plan the administrative re
sponse to potential crises.
Emergency Manager Keith Per
ry said the University has a situation
triage assessment team made up of
representatives from departments
across campus, including the Univer
sity president and the Provost's of
fice.

According to Perry, if an active
threat emerged on campus, SUDPS
would simultaneously send respon
ded to the scene and start the
process of campus-wide communica
tion through the AlertSU system.
He said the situation triage as
sessment team would convene as
quickly as possible either
through teleconferencing or in-per
son —to determine the course of
action across campus. Perry said the
group has conducted "tabletop exer
cises" in order to prepare.
Perry said that an exercise con
ducted last fall helped give adminis
trators a better idea of the best re
sponse to a crisis, even though it did
n't change the fundamental plans in
place.

"I think what it did was it al
lowed [the administrators] to under
stand the impact that [an active
threat] would have on the campus
and the need for responding effec
tively and rapidly to resolve the situ
ation," Perry said.

Assessing threats
SUDPS Sergeant Christopher
Cohendet said the most effective
way of preventing danger is reaching
individuals before they become vio

lent. Cohendet pointed out that in
past incidents such as the shootings
at Columbine High School or the Au
rora, Colo., movie theater, there
were clear warning signs that were
ignored until it was too late.

Cohendet is a member of the
University's threat assessment team,
a group of representatives of 10 dif
ferent departments across the Uni
versity that meets regularly to dis
cuss potential threats. Both Larson
and Cohendet encouraged commu
nity members to reach out with any
concerns they have about others.

Once the threat assessment
team receives a tip, Cohendet said
the team will work together to eval
uate the nature of the threat. Often,
this means reaching out to those
close to the individual to try to put
potentially threatening comments or
actions in context.

"The whole point is to under
stand what is going on in that per
son's life," Cohendet said.
He emphasized that the point
of an assessment was not to get
someone in trouble, but instead to
get them help.

"We want to determine what
we can put in place to help reduce
the likelihood a violent act will oc
cur," Cohendet said. "There are lots
of resources [at Stanford] and so we
want people to see that there are
other ways for people to deal with is
sues or conflicts."

Community outreach
However, Larson said that an
equally important part of preparation
was ensuring that students, faculty
and staff know how to respond if an
emergency were to occur.

"We're well trained, but it's no
good when [students] are in a shoot
ing system and [they] don't have that
training," Larson said. "Lessons
learned from previous shootings are
that we need to get the message out
to the community as to how to pre
pare until we can get there."
Robin Hattersley Gray, execu
tive editor of "Campus Safety Maga
zine," a nationwide resource for
campus security, said that basic prior
training can be crucial to keeping
people safe during a crisis.
"It's kind of like what they do

with airlines when you're flying
across the country," Gray said.
"They say, look around and know
where your exits are. That's some
thing to keep in mind just as far as
general situational awareness."
For this reason, Larson said that
in 2009, SUDPS lieutenant Kay lida
created a one-hour safety presenta
tion that teaches community mem
bers how to avoid and respond to an
active threat.

"We let people know right up
front that it's not to scare and not to
make them paranoid; it's just to pre
pare them," Larson said. "It's unlike
ly but it's always possible here at
Stanford."

According to Vince Bergado, a
SUDPS staffer, a key aspect of prepa
ration is considering your surround
ings before a crisis occurs. Bergado
says he tells staff and faculty to think
about how they would respond to a
threat that was outside their office
or classroom door.

"Do you have something you
can put in front of the door, or is
your file cabinet too heavy to move?"
Bergado asked. "Do you have a win
dow that you can actually escape
out of, or is it locked?"
Larson said that on request,
SUDPS will come to offices or dor
mitories to give residents an assess
ment of the potential danger spots
or potential escape routes in their
building.

Run, hide, fight
According to Larson, if there
were an active threat, every person
should respond in one of three
ways: running, hiding or fighting.
He said the police department uses
a You Tube video produced by the De
partment of Homeland Security and
the City of Houston to break down
these three options and when you
should use them.

"If you can get out, get out and
escape as long as you are escaping
away from the gunfire and you're
pretty sure you know where it is so
you aren't running to it," Larson said.
He added that if a person can escape,
they should run in a zigzag pattern
and leave all their belongings behind.

Larson said that if there were no
escape route, the next-best option

would be to hide, particularly if an
alert message has been sent out say
ing "shelter in place."
"That means to barricade your
self, stay inside the building, secure
yourself in place," Larson explained.
He said that when one is forced to
stay inside, one should lock all doors
and windows if it is safe to do so and
barricade doors with furniture to pre
vent an intruder from entering.
He emphasized that students
should not just cower under desks
because escaping is the better option
as long as it is safe to do so.
"[Hiding] may not be your only
option—you may be able to escape
through some other route," Larson
said. "So don't just immediately hear
gunfire and go under the table be
cause you might be able to find away
to get out."

Larson said that fighting is the
last resort if your life depends on it.

"If somebody were to come into
a room and they have a gun ready to
shoot or they are shooting, you don't
want to just be waiting to be shot,
you want to do something," Larson
said. "So we say, throw something at
him, get him distracted and if there's
more than one person, the idea is to
try to disarm him and try to take him
down until the police arrive."

Larson said this was a lesson
learned from the Virginia Tech shoot
ing in 2007, when students may
have missed an opportunity to dis
arm the shooter before he inflicted
more damage.
"That's why we're learning from
[past tragedies] to get more edu
cation and information out to the
community about the options that
they have," Larson said.
