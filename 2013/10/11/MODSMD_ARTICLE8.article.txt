## Find Your Passion? 
### Not So Humble Opinion Haley Sims 
Want to know three words I
really dislike? Too bad if you
don't. "Find your passion."

How many graduation speeches, for
tune cookies or self-help blogs have we all
read that encourage us in the context of a
career or study path to "find your passion
and follow it?" Too many.

What does this overused phrase even
mean? To me, a passion is something that
you give yourself fully to it's something
that you believe in with every fiber of your
being. You would pretty much sacrifice
anything for it; it burns inside of you. Sim
ply look at the way the word is generally
employed: We use the words "passion"
and "passionate" to describe romance and
love, from the star cross'd Romeo and Juli
et to the sparkling Edward and Bella (don't
act like you never read the books, or at
least indulged in the movie).
The problem is that this phrase has be
come, in my not-so-humble opinion, so
übiquitously overused that its meaning has
been lost. Or maybe that causal relation
ship is entirely reversed, and perhaps the
phrase's meaning was never understood in
the first place. How many people are really
feeling the fire that drives them towards
greatness day in and day out?
But we throw the phrase around be
cause it's hip, or because the idea of hav
ing a life where you wake up every day lov
ing every thing that is your impassioned
life is a great dream to have. It gives life a
focus, a determined simplicity, and gives
us the feeling that our endeavors are truly
worthwhile.

Really, though, how many of us truly
anticipate finding a job where we wake up
every day more excited to go to work than
the day before? Not all of us can be the
awesomely over-enthusiastic drum major
of the Stanford marching band, constantly
excited with what we are doing and living
life effervescently. I really hope that some

of you prove me wrong and do, but for the
majority, this might not be the case.
And that's OK! I believe very strongly
that it is possible to do something in life
that brings you some sense of satisfaction
and fulfillment. You can find a job or make
a decision that might not give you a com
plete outlet for all the fiery zeal burning
inside of you, but it will allow you to point
to something and say, "I did that. That's
mine. I'm happy with it."

And there it is: happiness. Because isn't
that really what we're all looking for? I feel
like I am constantly bombarded by "ways
to be happy" every day. Books, pamphlets
and Buzzfeed posts are published about it
and thrown in front of my face, telling me
that I'm not happy with my life but if I read
this punchy self-help book endorsed by
Oprah's Book Club I will finally know what
joy is!

But I think really being happy is about
being sure of yourself and truly knowing

who you are in a given moment. It's not a
secret you have to find and unlock, but a
state of mind. It doesn't necessarily come
at the flip of a switch —we can't all say
"OK, I choose to be happy right now," and
poof, we're all suddenly smiley and bub
bling over with delight. Finding those
things that make you feel satisfied and ful
filled, though, can probably help keep that
switch flipped on.

Some people might, however, truly
have passion for what they do. The desire
to engage in some pursuit is so strong they
do give themselves fully to it. And most
likely, simply engaging in this pursuit
brings some measure of fulfillment cre
ating a positive feedback loop, which helps
them forge onward. But this isn't the case
for all of us.

Although I am completely unqualified
to impart any grand platitudes relating to
life, I do encourage everyone to seek
something that brings them fulfillment. It
might not bring fulfillment every moment
of every day, but it should do so enough to
make the bad days worth it. Otherwise
what's the point?

And so thank you Life Hack.com, Huff
ington Post and Oprah, but I respectfully
decline your invitation to "Find my pas
sion." Instead, I'll try and find a little more
happiness and fulfillment.

Being happy is
about being sure of
yourself.
