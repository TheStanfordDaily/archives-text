# UTAH SEEKS UPSET
## Win would complete Card's Pac-12 sweep 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
Going into Saturday's
matchup in Salt Lake City, the
Stanford Cardinal owns an ac
tive winning streak against 11 of
the 12 teams in the Pacific-12

conference. From blowouts like
the dismantling of Washington
State at Century Link Field two
weeks ago to nail-biters like the
overtime thriller against Oregon
at Autzen last season, the Cardi
nal has seen it all in its most re
cent trip around its conference.

And when the No. 5 Cardi
nal (5-0, 3-0 Pac-12) takes on
Utah (3-2, 0-2) for the first time
since 1996 at Rice-Eccles Stadi
um on Saturday afternoon, the
defending Pac-12 champions
will finally get the opportunity to
check the 12th and final team
off of that list and notch the last
win of a victorious circuit of one
of the toughest conferences in
the nation.

Although the Utes are still
winless in conference play after
a heartbreaking seven-point loss
against UCLA last weekend, the
Cardinal cannot afford to catch
itself looking past an upstart
Utah team to the toughest
stretch of its 2013 schedule

consecutive games against
UCLA, Oregon State and Ore
gonâ€” and fall victim to the
classic "trap game" scenario
against a team that is better than
its record suggests.
One of the matchup's signif
icant factors in both the Utes'
quest to pull off one of the
biggest upsets of the year and
the Cardinal's quest to avoid
falling from the ranks of the un
defeated will be the ability for
both second-year quarterbacks
to bounce back from subpar per
formances.

However, the similarities
between the pocket-passers for
the two teams do not stop there.
Both sophomore Travis Wilson
for the Utes and junior Kevin
Hogan for the Cardinal estab
lished themselves as the starters
of their respective teams mid
way through last season.

Wilson started the final sev
en games last season after start
ing quarterback Jordan Wynn in
jured his shoulder in the second
game of the season and chose to
retire. Many were skeptical of
head coach Kyle Whittingham's
choice to start the freshman Wil-

son over veteran John Hays, but
Wilson has emerged in a big way
this season after going 3-4 as a
starter in 2012.

The sophomore has already
passed for 1,406 yards through
five games to go with an impres
sive 248 yards on the ground.
Wilson couples a 6-foot-7, 240-
pound frame with his scrappy
scrambling ability, characteris
tics that are shared with Hogan
and have kept opposing defens
es on their toes all season long.
"The thing is, he can see it
all," said Stanford head coach
David Shaw. "He's a head above
everybody. They don't get a lot
of balls deflected, which is one
thing we get pretty good at. He's
a better athlete than a tall guy
should be ... If you think you got
a beat on him, he'll push up in
the pocket and take off on you.
It's about containing and making
sure that we keep guys on all

GAME NOTES: Stanford heads to Salt
Lake City for the first time in almost
20 years to take on the Utes. The
Cardinal has won its last matchup
with every Pac-12 opponent besides
Utah, who bested Stanford at the
old Stanford Stadium in 1996 when
these teams last met. Stanford junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan and Utah
junior quarterback Travis Wilson will
look to bounce back from tough
performances last week to lead their
respective teams to victory.

Junior wide receiver Ty Montgomery (above) was named a Pac-12
player of the week last week after his 290 all-purpose yards against
Washington. His speed could prove key at Salt Lake City's altitude.
