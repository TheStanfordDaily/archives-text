# UTAH SEEKS UPSET
## Win would complete Card's Pac-12 sweep 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
Going into Saturday's
matchup in Salt Lake City, the
Stanford Cardinal owns an ac
tive winning streak against 11 of
the 12 teams in the Pacific-12

conference. From blowouts like
the dismantling of Washington
State at Century Link Field two
weeks ago to nail-biters like the
overtime thriller against Oregon
at Autzen last season, the Cardi
nal has seen it all in its most re
cent trip around its conference.

And when the No. 5 Cardi
nal (5-0, 3-0 Pac-12) takes on
Utah (3-2, 0-2) for the first time
since 1996 at Rice-Eccles Stadi
um on Saturday afternoon, the
defending Pac-12 champions
will finally get the opportunity to
check the 12th and final team
off of that list and notch the last
win of a victorious circuit of one
of the toughest conferences in
the nation.

Although the Utes are still
winless in conference play after
a heartbreaking seven-point loss
against UCLA last weekend, the
Cardinal cannot afford to catch
itself looking past an upstart
Utah team to the toughest
stretch of its 2013 schedule

consecutive games against
UCLA, Oregon State and Ore
gon— and fall victim to the
classic "trap game" scenario
against a team that is better than
its record suggests.
One of the matchup's signif
icant factors in both the Utes'
quest to pull off one of the
biggest upsets of the year and
the Cardinal's quest to avoid
falling from the ranks of the un
defeated will be the ability for
both second-year quarterbacks
to bounce back from subpar per
formances.

However, the similarities
between the pocket-passers for
the two teams do not stop there.
Both sophomore Travis Wilson
for the Utes and junior Kevin
Hogan for the Cardinal estab
lished themselves as the starters
of their respective teams mid
way through last season.

Wilson started the final sev
en games last season after start
ing quarterback Jordan Wynn in
jured his shoulder in the second
game of the season and chose to
retire. Many were skeptical of
head coach Kyle Whittingham's
choice to start the freshman Wil-

son over veteran John Hays, but
Wilson has emerged in a big way
this season after going 3-4 as a
starter in 2012.

The sophomore has already
passed for 1,406 yards through
five games to go with an impres
sive 248 yards on the ground.
Wilson couples a 6-foot-7, 240-
pound frame with his scrappy
scrambling ability, characteris
tics that are shared with Hogan
and have kept opposing defens
es on their toes all season long.
"The thing is, he can see it
all," said Stanford head coach
David Shaw. "He's a head above
everybody. They don't get a lot
of balls deflected, which is one
thing we get pretty good at. He's
a better athlete than a tall guy
should be ... If you think you got
a beat on him, he'll push up in
the pocket and take off on you.
It's about containing and making
sure that we keep guys on all

GAME NOTES: Stanford heads to Salt
Lake City for the first time in almost
20 years to take on the Utes. The
Cardinal has won its last matchup
with every Pac-12 opponent besides
Utah, who bested Stanford at the
old Stanford Stadium in 1996 when
these teams last met. Stanford junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan and Utah
junior quarterback Travis Wilson will
look to bounce back from tough
performances last week to lead their
respective teams to victory.

player of the week last week after his 290 all-purpose yards against
Washington. His speed could prove key at Salt Lake City's altitude.
sides of him and squeeze because
you can't let him scramble for first
downs."

However, the Utes were truly
sunk last weekend —in a game
they arguably should have won
by the six interceptions thrown by
Wilson. Only two of the picks,
however, could completely be at
tributed to bad decisions by the
sophomore, who had also been bat
tling an illness in the days leading
up to the contest. No matter the
reason, Utah's offense will have to
limit the turnovers against a Stan
ford defense that has forced at least
one turnover in each of its last 29
contests.

The Utes' strong passing game
took a major step back when big
tight end Jake Murphy underwent
a potentially season-ending surgery
after playing through a broken
wrist in the second half against
UCLA. The Utes' other primary
tight end, Westlee Tonga, is expect
ed to be out against Stanford after
missing the UCLA game with an in
jury, leaving Wilson with two fewer
big targets to look for downfield.
On Stanford's side, Hogan im
proved his unblemished record as a
starter to 10-0 last weekend de
spite having one of the least pro
ductive nights of his career. Against
a stingy Huskies secondary, Hogan
could only complete 12 of his 20
passes for a very pedestrian 100
yards. Washington's defensive
backs read his eyes effectively and

played airtight coverage, giving
Hogan very few opportunities to
work with.

Because of the lack of opportu
nities to make plays with his arm
and consistently push the ball
downfield, Hogan never settled in
to a rhythm and missed his re
ceivers on the few occurrences in
which they were open.
A very inexperienced Utah
secondary, ranking 101 st in the
FBS with over 274 passing yards al
lowed per game, should provide an
opportunity for Hogan to regain his
bearings and return to form.
However, as Hogan attempts
to make his presence known from
the pocket, Stanford's offensive
line will have to hold off a strong
Utah pass rush that has not lost a
step after losing star defensive
tackle Star Lotulelei to the NFL.
Led by junior linebacker Jacoby
Hale and senior defensive tackle
Tenny Palepoi, the Utes have com
piled 18 sacks through five games,
good for fourth in the nation.
Despite three injury scares
within Stanford's starting front sev
en during the Washington game
junior linebacker James Vaughters,
fifth-year senior defensive end Ben
Gardner and fifth-year senior line
backer Shayne Skov all went down
(much to the ire of Huskies coach
Steve Sarkisian) all three have
improved significantly and look to
be good to bring pressure on Wil
son throughout Saturday after
noon. Nose tackle David Parry has
also missed practice this week with
a lower-abdominal injury, but is ex
pected to play.

While Stanford's front seven

will attempt to unleash its pressure
on Wilson, it will be playing at alti
tude, a factor that is likely to tire
players out more quickly. However,
Shaw and his players are not con
cerned.

"Usually with the altitude
games, it's the first quarter and a
half," Shaw said. "The first time
you get a little winded, trying to
suck the air in, but your bodies ad
just. We haven't had an issue in the

second half of any game."
Indeed, Stanford was not put
off by a higher altitude when it vis
ited Boulder to take on the Col
orado Buffaloes last year, a game
that it won 48-0 as Hogan estab
lished himself as the Cardinal's
starter of the future. When he
takes the field again in thinner air
this Saturday, he will not be trying
to establish himself as an individ
ual. Rather, he will be trying to so

lidify his team's status as a firm na
tional-title contender this time
around.

Stanford and Utah will kick off
at 3 p.m. PDT on Saturday from
Salt Lake City with the Cardinal at
tempting to improve its record to
6-0 leading up to a Pac-12 Champi
onship rematch against UCLA.
