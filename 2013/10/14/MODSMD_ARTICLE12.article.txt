# A 						Fourth Open Letter to Miley
## 
### Alex Bayer 
Dear Miley,
I was on your side until now. It's
not that I didn't cringe watch
ing the YMAs or "Wrecking
Ball," but I gave you the benefit of
the doubt. The media has a history
of being hypocritical about female
sexuality, both afraid and mesmer
ized by it.
When you explained that your
VMA performance wasn't about
being sexy, I had even more respect
for you. Once you stated this wasn't
your aim, the blame fell on us as
spectators: Why were we expecting
it in the first place? Why did we as
sume that your goal was seduction?
Why, if we broaden the question,
do we feel like we're entitled to it?
When you look at the actresses who
are most in demand (Scarlet Jo
hansson, Olivia Wilde, etc.) and the
roles they're offered, it's not hard
to see that the media prescribes

women a certain function: as sirens
and objects of desire, and if they
fail in this function, if they fail to se
duce us in the eyes of a society
that judges them for exclusively
this they have nothing else of
value to their name.
I am just hypothesizing. Miley,
don't take offense, but I don't imag
ine any such deeper agenda in
spired your VMA performance. You
were just being you, following your
prerogative, as my beloved Britney
Spears once sang.
The rebellious young woman
coming into her own will fascinate
the critics in perpetuity and lead
others to bemoan the state of youth
culture, wondering about the sexu
ality of female pop stars and
whether it expresses empower
ment or further forces women to
perform to their function as sexual
ized objects.
Regardless, Miley, I lost all re
spect for you when you tweeted a
screenshot of Sinead O'Connor's
tweets from two years ago. You in
voked her struggle with mental ill
ness as a means to delegitimize her
opinion, which she had wielded not
to hurt you but to warn you.
She was critical of your actions
but not critical of you. They were
harsh but not ill-intentioned words,
but in your binary view (Miley vs.
the world), you misconstrued them
as an attack and responded with
one of your own that, unlike her let
ter, was deeply hurtful and insensi
tive in its intent.
As O'Connor writes, though it's
hardly news, showbiz is imperson
al. Most executives behind it have
less regard for the soul-saving pow
ers of music than the profits. As
O'Connor pointed out, the decade
long trend of singing shows has
turned singing, just like everything
else in America, into a competition
where the only thing that matters
is who is "best."
I have no problem with you do
ing your thing, Miley —to each
their own, and if swinging naked on
a wrecking ball is your thing, I
don't care enough to persuade you
to think otherwise. But if your goal
really is to show up the critics and
rebel against people's expectations
of you, have conviction beneath it;
stand for something, for someone
not just for you, not just for the
sake of rebelling.
Sinead is a model for doing your

own thing, and she's radical as it
gets, but no one can say she isn't
fearless. When you took a dig at her
mental illness, you were acting out
of fear. If all of your latest work was
your soul playing out its preroga
tive, you shouldn't care what people
think.
But the more defensive you get
about it, the more I think that your
desire to prove everyone wrong is
trumping your desire to create art.
If you believe in the art, then you
have my respect, and if you can
stand up for it, then you have it
doubly. But when you treat some
one with such insensitivity, it does
n't matter. You've lost me.
We look to artists to interpret
pain and give it a name and a sem
blance of beauty, to convey to us
hope when we have none. Your re
sponse to Sinead wasn't just an in
sult to those with diagnosed mental
health issues. It was an insult to the
power and purpose of music.
I can't deny how catchy "We
Can't Stop Is," but I can't respect
you as an artist in the way I respect
those who do it from a place of ten
derness. Music is not the business
of the cruel; it is the business of the
wronged.
It belongs to the bird with bro
ken wings willing to sing, to the po
et who has touched rock bottom
and lived to tell the tale. The musi
cian is the ally of the suffering soul.
When you paraded Sinead's strug
gle out into the world to make a
mockery of it, the person you did
the greatest injury to wasn't
Sinead, but to the millionth lonely
soul turning to music when nothing
else remains.

fail in this function, if they fail to se
duce us in the eyes of a society
that judges them for exclusively
this they have nothing else of
value to their name.
I am just hypothesizing. Miley,
don't take offense, but I don't imag
ine any such deeper agenda in
spired your VMA performance. You
were just being you, following your
prerogative, as my beloved Britney
Spears once sang.
The rebellious young woman
coming into her own will fascinate
the critics in perpetuity and lead
others to bemoan the state of youth
culture, wondering about the sexu
ality of female pop stars and
whether it expresses empower
ment or further forces women to
perform to their function as sexual
ized objects.
Regardless, Miley, I lost all re
spect for you when you tweeted a
screenshot of Sinead O'Connor's
tweets from two years ago. You in
voked her struggle with mental ill
ness as a means to delegitimize her
opinion, which she had wielded not
to hurt you but to warn you.
She was critical of your actions
but not critical of you. They were
harsh but not ill-intentioned words,
but in your binary view (Miley vs.
the world), you misconstrued them
as an attack and responded with
one of your own that, unlike her let
ter, was deeply hurtful and insensi
tive in its intent.
As O'Connor writes, though it's
hardly news, showbiz is imperson
al. Most executives behind it have
less regard for the soul-saving pow
ers of music than the profits. As
O'Connor pointed out, the decade
long trend of singing shows has
turned singing, just like everything
else in America, into a competition
where the only thing that matters
is who is "best."
I have no problem with you do
ing your thing, Miley —to each
their own, and if swinging naked on
a wrecking ball is your thing, I
don't care enough to persuade you
to think otherwise. But if your goal
really is to show up the critics and
rebel against people's expectations
of you, have conviction beneath it;
stand for something, for someone
not just for you, not just for the
sake of rebelling.
Sinead is a model for doing your

own thing, and she's radical as it
gets, but no one can say she isn't
fearless. When you took a dig at her
mental illness, you were acting out
of fear. If all of your latest work was
your soul playing out its preroga
tive, you shouldn't care what people
think.
But the more defensive you get
about it, the more I think that your
desire to prove everyone wrong is
trumping your desire to create art.
If you believe in the art, then you
have my respect, and if you can
stand up for it, then you have it
doubly. But when you treat some
one with such insensitivity, it does
n't matter. You've lost me.
We look to artists to interpret
pain and give it a name and a sem
blance of beauty, to convey to us
hope when we have none. Your re
sponse to Sinead wasn't just an in
sult to those with diagnosed mental
health issues. It was an insult to the
power and purpose of music.
I can't deny how catchy "We
Can't Stop Is," but I can't respect
you as an artist in the way I respect
those who do it from a place of ten
derness. Music is not the business
of the cruel; it is the business of the
wronged.
It belongs to the bird with bro
ken wings willing to sing, to the po
et who has touched rock bottom
and lived to tell the tale. The musi
cian is the ally of the suffering soul.
When you paraded Sinead's strug
gle out into the world to make a
mockery of it, the person you did
the greatest injury to wasn't
Sinead, but to the millionth lonely
soul turning to music when nothing
else remains.

Dear Miley,
I was on your side until now. It's
not that I didn't cringe watch
ing the YMAs or "Wrecking
Ball," but I gave you the benefit of
the doubt. The media has a history
of being hypocritical about female
sexuality, both afraid and mesmer
ized by it.
When you explained that your
VMA performance wasn't about
being sexy, I had even more respect
for you. Once you stated this wasn't
your aim, the blame fell on us as
spectators: Why were we expecting
it in the first place? Why did we as
sume that your goal was seduction?
Why, if we broaden the question,
do we feel like we're entitled to it?
When you look at the actresses who
are most in demand (Scarlet Jo
hansson, Olivia Wilde, etc.) and the
roles they're offered, it's not hard
to see that the media prescribes

women a certain function: as sirens
and objects of desire, and if they
fail in this function, if they fail to se
duce us in the eyes of a society
that judges them for exclusively
this they have nothing else of
value to their name.
