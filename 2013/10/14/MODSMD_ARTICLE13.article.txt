## SWIFT REVENGE STANFORD PICKS UP TWO SHUTOUT WINS 
### CARLIE TENENBAUM 
In a bitter NorPac field hockey rematch Fri
day night, the Stanford Cardinal bested the vis
iting UC-Davis Aggies 5-0. After losing 3-2 in a
gripping overtime match last Sunday at Aggie
Stadium, Stanford rebounded with the decisive
shutout victory. Then, on Sunday, Stanford
topped Yale 4-0.
Senior attacker Courtney Haldeman opened

the scoring just 1:10 in
to the match, a shot that
ended up being the
game winner. Cardinal
sophomore goalie Dul
cie Davies needed only

one save to shut out the visiting Aggies.
Maintaining possession for the majority of
the first half, the Cardinal looked dominant. An
chored in the midfield by juniors Kasey Quon
and Alex McCawley, Stanford deftly maneu
vered through a fatigued Aggie defense. Forc
ing four corners in the opening half, Stanford
remained a potent offensive threat throughout,
rarely allowing the Aggies to mount an attack.
The few drives UC-Davis had were easily
contained by a stringent Cardinal defense led
by junior Kelsey Harbin. In an especially strong
showing, the Card held the Aggies to just two
shots and no penalty corners.
Offensively, Stanford benefitted from a two
goal effort by senior forward Hope Burke.
Burke has shown tremendous leadership this
season and was instrumental in a key game
against Davis.
"The win against Davis was great," said
Burke. "It marks the starting point for the rest
of the season. We took last Sunday's loss really
hard."
The team took the field Friday determined
for revenge and after goals by Haldeman and
Burke, rolled into halftime with a 2-0 lead.
"Scoring in the first two minutes was
thrilling," Burke said. "It gave us a calm confi
dence going forward."
The momentum soundly with the Cardinal,
the second half yielded goals from sophomore
attacker Clemence Couteau, Burke and Mc-
Cawley. Much like in the game against Pacific,
Stanford recorded goals from a variety of play
ers, hinting at a chemistry that seemed to be
missing in Sunday's loss at Davis.
"We refocused as a team on and off the
field," Burke said. "We came back with a new
passion for the remaining regular season
games."
Stanford rode the excitement of its 5-0 win
into Sunday's game against unranked Yale.
Midway through the first half, Harbin recorded
her sixth goal of the season on Stanford's first
penalty corner of the game. The Cardinal has
struggled with corners this season, but had a
breakout performance against the Bulldogs, go

ing 3-3. The second goal came with a minute and
a half remaining in the first half as sophomore
attacker Lauren Becker converted, assisted by
Harbin and sophomore midfielder Jessica
Chisholm.
Coming out of halftime leading 2-0, the Car
dinal kept up the pressure and secured a 4-0
win, adding goals from senior midfielder Elise
Ogle and a third corner strike from Quon.
Davies Cardinal of the Game against Yale

had a much more active day than Friday,
recording seven saves in the team's second con
secutive shutout win.
"Shutouts are huge for team morale,"
Davies commented. "[A shutout] creates a
confidence in the defense that spreads to the
offense, and the whole team plays more confi
dently."

ALISA ROYER/The Stanford Daily
Senior forward Hope Burke scored twice in Stanford's 5-0 victory against UC-Davis Friday
night. The Cardinal avenged a shocking upset at the hands of the Aggies the week before.
A passionate Yale team, hin
dered by four injuries during the
game, was able to penetrate the
Stanford defense a few times,
working 11 shots over the course of
the match. With her defense look
ing a bit shaken, Davies took con
trol, quickly and efficiently settling
her teammates' nerves.
"It's my responsibility to organ
ize the defense on counter attacks,

make sure everyone's in position,"
Davies said. "It takes a lot of com
munication."
Davies, just a sophomore, leads
the defense with poise.
"Sometimes I just have to re
mind the team we're fine. Like to
day I just told them, we're winning
by 4, we're okay."
Stanford hits the road for its up
coming slate, playing at Wake For
est and Duke before returning
home to battle Michigan on Oct.
25.
