# DEFENSE KEYS SWEEPS

### JORDAN WALLACH 
After a long week of defensive
work, team meetings and film
study to overcome last Saturday's
loss to No. 2 USC, Stanford's
women's volleyball team swept
both of its weekend matches
against the Utah Utes and the Col
orado Buffaloes in dominating
fashion.

The No. 8 Cardinal (12-3, 5-1
Pac-12) defeated the Utes (14-4,3-
3) in three sets (25-17, 25-18, 25-
18) on Friday. With the victory,
Stanford improved to 19-4 in

matches directly after losses over
its last five seasons.
The Card won five straight
points on serve to start off the first
set and never looked back. It main
tained control throughout the
match, falling behind just once at
8-9 in the second set. But after
winning three straight points
two on Utah attack errors to go
back up 11-9, the Card didn't sur
render the lead for the rest of the
match.
On the attack, Stanford outhit
Utah .327 to .149. It was a season
low in hitting percentage for the
Utes, forced by a strong Cardinal
defense. Junior libero Kyle Gilbert
had a team-high 19 digs and soph
omore outside hitter Jordan
Burgess added 12.
"One of the things we've been
focusing on in practice is defense,"
said senior middle blocker Carly
Wopat, "and we did a lot better
with that."
The Cardinal also held the Utes
to a season-low five team blocks
with a combination of tips, hard
spikes and shot placement. The
team has been hard to block in
general throughout the season, as
opponents have recorded an aver
age of just 1.3 blocks per set.
"For us, it just depends on
passing. When we pass well
enough, it doesn't matter who the
team is, we're hard to block," said
head coach John Dunning. "Our
passers did a good job tonight, and
so our setter, most of the time, had
choices."
Sophomore setter Madi Bugg
had 37 assists in the match and 39
in Saturday's match against Col
orado, improving her season aver
age to 11.88 assists per set, which
ranks among the top six in the na
tion.
Stanford extended its modest
winning streak in Saturday's
match against Colorado (11-5,3-3),
earning another three-set sweep
(25-17, 25-19, 25-21).
Senior Rachel Williams was the
star of the match, earning her
team-high sixth double-double of
