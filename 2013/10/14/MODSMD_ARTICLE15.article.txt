## Another home loss for Card 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
It really wasn't a good week
end to be a fifth-ranked Stan
ford team.
A little more than 24 hours
after the football team was
shocked by underdog Utah, the
women's soccer team suffered
an even more stunning defeat as
the No. 5 Cardinal (9-3-1, 2-3-0
Pac-12) was toppled by the
struggling USC Trojans (6-6-2,
1-3-1) by a score of 1-0 in front
of a packed crowd of 2,150 at Ca
gan Stadium.

For a team that hadn't lost at
home since 2007 going into last
weekend, the Cardinal hit a his
toric low with its third consecu
tive home loss on Sunday night.
It marked the first time since
1987 that the Cardinal had lost
three home matches in a row
and the first time ever in the
program's history that Stanford
had lost three conference home
games in a row.
Although Stanford had en
tered the season as a consensus
top-five team, the Cardinal's
championship hopes have plum
meted over its last three match
es. It seemed as though last
Sunday's home loss to Arizona
State had stunned both the
players and coaches into a lull
that was just accentuated in a
loss to a championship-caliber
No. 2 UCLA squad on Thurs
day. That loss of confidence
came to a forefront on Sunday
against a USC team that had

not won a match in almost a month
and was still looking for its first
conference victory.
Stanford made some changes to
its starting lineup for Sunday's
match after its stagnant play and
lack of explosiveness against Ari
zona State and UCLA. The most
notable switch was the removal of
junior forward Taylor Uhl al
ready responsible for 10 goals this
season in favor of freshman
Megan Turner. Freshman goal
keeper Jane Campbell also took a
predetermined match off to give
sophomore Sarah Cox a chance to
play.
Neither team's players were
able to maintain firm possession of
the ball all evening combining for
just seven shots and three saves
through a scoreless first half. Stan
ford's passing was especially off,
with the power, direction and tim
ing of many passes leading to
turnovers and balls going out of
bounds in the face of USC's high
pressure defense.
The Cardinal had one good op
portunity in the 18th minute when
junior forward Chioma Übogagu
sped down the sideline and set up a
great cross into the box for senior
forward Courtney Verloo. Howev
er, Yerloo's sliding shot went just
wide of the right post, and the Car
dinal came up empty in one of its
few promising scoring opportuni
ties of the evening.
USC pulled ahead after half
time when it scored a rare goal off
of a corner kick as forward Kayla
Mills got the ball to midfielder Alex
Quincey, who headed the ball into
the goal off of a ricochet.
Although the Cardinal solidified
its passing and gave itself many
more opportunities in the second
half, goalkeeper Caroline Stanley
played a shutdown match for the
Trojans and kept Stanford off the
board despite a 12-4 shot advan
tage for the Cardinal.
Übogagu was on the move all
evening, beating defenders and
creating opportunities as she tried
to spark the Cardinal to victory.
However, despite her best efforts,
the Cardinal couldn't get the ball

into the back of the net.
In the 75th minute, Übogagu
used some nifty footwork in the box
to keep the ball away from defend
ers and set up a good pass to fresh
man defender Maddie Bauer, who
was robbed of a goal by a good save
from Stanley. Übogagu also used
her standout speed to create oppor
tunities in the 66th and 85th min
utes by beating the whole USC de
fense and getting clear shots off
that were also saved by Stanley,
who saved six shots in all in the sec
ond half.
"I think [Ubogagu] had some
amazing opportunities, and I'm
sure she's very upset that she was
n't able to capitalize on them," said
head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "But she
had good energy, she was trying to
be a difference maker and she was.
She just couldn't connect on the
chances she created. The goalkeep
er came up with a couple of good
saves on her opportunities."
Ratcliffe admitted after the
match that he was still unsure of
how his team's mentality was hold
ing up under the pressures of an
extremely rare and demotivating
losing streak.
"I hope the mentality is, 'Hey,
work hard and good things will
come our way,' but there does seem
to be a little bit of a mental block,
and they seem a little down," Rat
cliffe said. "Hopefully we can
bounce back. We have a lot of work
to do and, you know, we're going to
see their character now."
The Cardinal will have one final
opportunity to bounce back at
home against Utah on Friday at 7
p.m. amidst this tough stretch be
fore it embarks on a four-game con
ference road trip.
