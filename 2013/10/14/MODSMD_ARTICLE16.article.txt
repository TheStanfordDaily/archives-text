# Stats say run the ball on third-and-2
## 
### Sam Fisher 
Stanford football has an
identity crisis. For most of
the first three quarters
and the final two plays on
Saturday, Stanford looked
a team that was simply lost. A Pac-12
champion cannot go 45 minutes with
out scoring a point and expect to win.
Speaking of Stanford being a Pac
-12 champion, I'm sure I'm not the on
ly one who noticed that Utah's offen
sive game plan Saturday was almost
identical to UCLAs in the Pac-12
championship game last season. Yet
due to injuries, poor tackling and a
suspect defensive game plan, it took
the Cardinal three quarters to figure
out how to slow the Utes down.
But the most frustrating aspect of
the loss wasn't that Stanford strug
gled mightily for three quarters, it
was that, even after those early-game
struggles, the Cardinal should have
won the game. Yet, for some inexpli
cable reason, Stanford decided not to
punch it in on third-and-2 from the 6
but instead throw two pass plays.
I'm sure that head coach David
Shaw had his reasons for calling a
pass maybe there was some
matchup advantage he liked on tape
but that is over-thinking a very
simple situation. The Stanford Cardi
nal runs the football. Since Jim Har
baugh arrived on the Farm to take
over the head coaching job in late
2006, bringing Shaw with him, the
Cardinal has been a team that will
out-physical opponents for those
yards on the ground.
On Oct. 12,2013, that identity dis
appeared. Through the first five
games of the 2013 season, Stanford
had faced thud- or fourth-and-2 three
times. In all three situations, the Car
dinal ran the ball, and all three times
the Cardinal picked up the first down.
Against Utah, Stanford faced that
same situation three more times, and
all three times Stanford threw the
ball, only converting one of the three.
I know that's a small sample size,
but if you expand it outwards by ac
cepting a bit more generality (third or
fourth downs with three yards or
fewer remaining), it's staggering
what the numbers say.
With Hogan in the game at quar
terback (equivalently, in non-garbage
time), Stanford has faced 30 such sit
uations this season (including against
Utah). Stanford has thrown the ball
10 times, with two completions for
first downs and eight incompletions.
You don't need to be a statistician to
figure out that those numbers are not
very good.
On the other hand, when Stanford
ran the ball (the other 20 times), the
Cardinal picked up a first down or a
touchdown 18 times, a whopping 90
percent conversion rate. And the two
times Stanford didn't pick up the first
down? The bootleg by Hogan at the
end of the Washington game â€”why
didn't Stanford run power? and a
third-and-1 against Washington State
when Stanford converted on fourth
and-1 a play later by, you guessed it,
running the football again.
Shaw tried to justify his decision
Saturday, at least partially, in his
postgame press conference by saying
that he didn't want to use his final
timeout after the play if the run
failed. Are you kidding me? On the 6-
yard-line with over a minute to go,
Shaw was concerned about running
the ball because he thought the Car
dinal would run out of time? I find it
hard to believe that was actually the
reasoning, but if it was, that would be
truly remarkable.
Now I'm not a football coach, and
I've never had to make a crunch-time
decision like Shaw had to against the
Utes, but taking all of this into consid
eration, I just can't understand why
Stanford would throw the ball. Shaw
may claim that he had confidence in
those passing plays, but the decision
smells more like Shaw saying that he
doesn't have confidence in his run
ning game; if I were a Stanford offen
sive lineman, those play-calls would
feel like a slap in the face.
And while Stanford never should
have let the game be so close, that de
cision is a big reason why the Cardi
nal could not escape with a victory.
After talking about a BCS Champi
onship Game appearance for the past
few months, Stanford is facing a bru
tal stretch of must-win games to keep
the hope of any BCS berth alive.
That is a real shame.
