## Men's soccer ties SDSU in wild match 
### â€“ Dylan Fugel 
Stanford men's soccer (6-3-2,1-2-1 Pac
-12) will feel a bit tired when it returns from
a tough road trip to Southern California, as
an enthralling game against San Diego
State (3-6-1, 0-2-1) ended in a 3-3 tie after
double overtime could not break the dead
lock.
The Cardinal was up 2-0 at one point
and then 3-2 thanks to goals by freshman
forward Jordan Morris, junior midfielder
Eric Verso and sophomore winger Aaron
Kovar, who notched his first goal of the
2013 campaign. However, Stanford was
constantly pushed back on defense
throughout the game. Seniors Jordan On
garo and Kody Duff pulled SDSU back
from an early deficit with goals before
senior midfielder Kevin Bick netted the
crucial equalizer only 44 seconds after
Stanford had retaken the lead courtesy of
Morris.
Though SDSU junior defender Wil
Cannon was sent off in the 73rd minute
with a red card, Stanford was unable to
capitalize on the man advantage and had
to settle for a somewhat disappointing
draw.
Jeremy Gunn's squad will look to re
group as it travels to No. 1 Cal (9-0-2, 3-0-
1) next Sunday in what should be a hard
fought matchup of the Bay Area archrivals.
