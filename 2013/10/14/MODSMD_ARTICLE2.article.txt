## GSB, CS to offer new joint degree The 						three-year graduate program starts in 2014-15 
### ELIZABETH DAVIS 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business (GSB) and the Computer
Science (CS) Department have
launched a three-year joint degree
program that will allow students to
earn both MBA and M.S. degrees.
Recently approved for the 2014-
15 academic year, the program will
combine two of the University's
most in-demand degrees into one
curriculum a combination never
been seen before at peer institu
tions.
The program targets students
who have interests in going into
technology yet also want to develop
skills in management and finance.
"Stanford's really well known as
being an incubator for new technol
ogy ventures," said Mary Oleksy,
associate director of joint and dual
degree programs at the GSB. "Our
hope is that this degree is going to
foster innovation that springs natu
rally from two of our world-class
programs, the GSB and our Com
puter Science Department."
Students interested in Stan
ford's Computer Science
M.S./MBA program must apply for
the master's programs in CS and
the GSB in two separate applica
tions. Students accepted into the
joint degree program will ideally
spend the first year of their three
year program taking MBA courses.
They will then spend their remain
ing two years taking courses in
both programs.
Over two dozen of Stanford's
GSB courses, including "Creating a
Startup," "Strategic Management
of Technology" and "Innovation
and Stochastic Networks," may
count towards M.S. requirements.
The program demands a total of
129 units, with 84 taken in the GSB
and 45 taken in the CS Depart
ment. The computer science cur
riculum also offers the opportunity
for students to specialize in various
concentrations, such as artificial in
telligence and biocomputation.
The Computer Science
M.S./MBA program is no
tably Stanford's first joint
degree program with the
School of Engineering. The
CS department offers one
other joint degree, a
J.D./M.S. with the Stanford
Law School.
The GSB already offers
joint degree programs with
other schools, such as a
J.D./MBA with the Stanford
Law School, an M.A./MBA
with the Graduate School of
Education and an MPP/MBA
with the Public Policy Pro
gram in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences. The
GSB also offers a dual degree
M.D./MBAwith the Stanford
Medical School and the
chance to pursue degrees
with other universities.
Nevertheless, the GSB

has plans to continue com
bining business with other
graduate technology pro
grams, such as electrical en
gineering.
"Increasingly, it's very
hard to think of technology
as its own industry," said
Madhav Rajan, senior asso
ciate dean for academic af
fairs at the GSB, discussing
the GSB's technology focus
for future joint degree pro
grams.
"Technology really goes
across every industry. For
example, finance is going to
be disrupted by a lot of
tech-based startups," he
added. "We're not thinking
of this degree as simply be
ing for corporate positions
in technology companies
but as preparation for going
into any industry that will
be affected or disrupted by
technology in the near fu
ture."
