## GSB, CS to offer new joint degree The
						three-year graduate program starts in 2014-15 
### ELIZABETH DAVIS 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business (GSB) and the Computer
Science (CS) Department have
launched a three-year joint degree
program that will allow students to
earn both MBA and M.S. degrees.
Recently approved for the 2014-
15 academic year, the program will
combine two of the University's
most in-demand degrees into one
curriculum a combination never
been seen before at peer institu
tions.
The program targets students
who have interests in going into
technology yet also want to develop
skills in management and finance.
"Stanford's really well known as
being an incubator for new technol
ogy ventures," said Mary Oleksy,
associate director of joint and dual
degree programs at the GSB. "Our
hope is that this degree is going to
foster innovation that springs natu
rally from two of our world-class
programs, the GSB and our Com
puter Science Department."
Students interested in Stan
ford's Computer Science
M.S./MBA program must apply for
the master's programs in CS and
the GSB in two separate applica
tions. Students accepted into the
joint degree program will ideally
spend the first year of their three
year program taking MBA courses.
They will then spend their remain
ing two years taking courses in
both programs.
Over two dozen of Stanford's
GSB courses, including "Creating a
Startup," "Strategic Management
of Technology" and "Innovation
and Stochastic Networks," may
count towards M.S. requirements.
The program demands a total of
129 units, with 84 taken in the GSB
and 45 taken in the CS Depart
ment. The computer science cur
riculum also offers the opportunity
for students to specialize in various
concentrations, such as artificial in
telligence and biocomputation.
