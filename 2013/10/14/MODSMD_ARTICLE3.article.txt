## SLOPPY CARD FALLS JUST SHORT AT UTAH 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
For the first time in his colle
giate career, quarterback Kevin
Hogan failed to deliver with the
game on the line.
On Saturday, Utah (4-2, 1-2
Pac-12) shocked No. 5 Stanford
(5-1, 3-1) 27-21 at Rice-Eccles
Stadium and handed Hogan his
first loss in 11 games as a starting
college quarterback. After play
ing sloppily on both sides of the
ball for most of the afternoon, the
Cardinal began a furious fourth
quarter rally that fell just short
when Hogan's pass fell incom
plete on fourth-and-2 at the Utah

6-yard line with 47 seconds left in
the game. The game's controver
sial play call, however, came on
the previous snap, when Stanford
elected to pass the ball on third
and-2 rather than run out of the
jumbo package.

Though Stanford did itself no
favors by committing two
turnovers, the Utes gashed the
Cardinal defense for 410 yards
with quick passes to the perime
ter and effective zone blocking.
Running back Robert Poole

rushed for 111 yards on 20 car
ries against a Stanford front seven
that uncharacteristically missed
open-field tackles, and at times
seemed confused by the variety of
looks Utah was showing. And
while Utah's offensive line domi
nated for most of the game, its de
fensive line applied enough pres
sure to disrupt the Cardinal's
running game Stanford had a
season-low 143 rushing yards
and throw Hogan off-rhythm.
"We knew we were coming in
to a hornet's nest," said head
coach David Shaw. "They out
played us, they out-coached us,

Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan (right) lost for the first time as Stanford's starting quarterback against
Utah Saturday. Hogan had been 10-0 as the starter before the loss to the unranked Utes. Hogan had
two opportunities to win the game at the end, but both of his passes to the endzone fell incomplete.
