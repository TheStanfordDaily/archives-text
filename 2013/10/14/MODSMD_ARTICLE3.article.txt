## SLOPPY CARD FALLS JUST SHORT AT UTAH 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
For the first time in his colle
giate career, quarterback Kevin
Hogan failed to deliver with the
game on the line.
On Saturday, Utah (4-2, 1-2
Pac-12) shocked No. 5 Stanford
(5-1, 3-1) 27-21 at Rice-Eccles
Stadium and handed Hogan his
first loss in 11 games as a starting
college quarterback. After play
ing sloppily on both sides of the
ball for most of the afternoon, the
Cardinal began a furious fourth
quarter rally that fell just short
when Hogan's pass fell incom
plete on fourth-and-2 at the Utah

6-yard line with 47 seconds left in
the game. The game's controver
sial play call, however, came on
the previous snap, when Stanford
elected to pass the ball on third
and-2 rather than run out of the
jumbo package.

Though Stanford did itself no
favors by committing two
turnovers, the Utes gashed the
Cardinal defense for 410 yards
with quick passes to the perime
ter and effective zone blocking.
Running back Robert Poole

rushed for 111 yards on 20 car
ries against a Stanford front seven
that uncharacteristically missed
open-field tackles, and at times
seemed confused by the variety of
looks Utah was showing. And
while Utah's offensive line domi
nated for most of the game, its de
fensive line applied enough pres
sure to disrupt the Cardinal's
running game Stanford had a
season-low 143 rushing yards
and throw Hogan off-rhythm.
"We knew we were coming in
to a hornet's nest," said head
coach David Shaw. "They out
played us, they out-coached us,

Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan (right) lost for the first time as Stanford's starting quarterback against
Utah Saturday. Hogan had been 10-0 as the starter before the loss to the unranked Utes. Hogan had
two opportunities to win the game at the end, but both of his passes to the endzone fell incomplete.
they beat us."
The game had the makings of a
shootout when Stanford and Utah
traded touchdown chives on the first
two possessions of the afternoon. Af
ter junior wide receiver Mont
gomery turned a hook route into a
45-yard pickup on the first snap of
the game, sophomore wideout Kodi
Whitfield followed suit with a 28-
yard reception. Three plays later,
senior halfback Tyler Gaffney
punched it in from one yard out to
put the Cardinal up early.
Utes quarterback Travis Wilson
led his team on an eight-play, 75-yard
drive to tie things up, but Mont
gomery picked up right from where
he left off against Washington by re
turning the subsequent kiekoff for a
touchdown. Barely midway through
the first quarter, Stanford led Utah
14-7.
But that's when things started to
collapse for Stanford.
Facing a third-and-17 near mid
field, Wilson launched the ball deep
toward wideout Dres Anderson, who
muscled his way past senior defen
sive back Devon Carrington to come
down with the ball for a 51-yard
touchdown.
Stanford's offense, meanwhile,
became stagnant. Senior Jordan
Williamson's 38-yard field goal at
tempt on the Cardinal's second drive
of the game went wide right, and af
ter that, senior Ben Rhyne punted
three straight times to end the first
half.
One of Rhyne's punts pinned
Utah at its own 1-yard line, but de
spite being better known for their
big-play capability, the Utes used an

impressive 11-play, 99-yard touch
down chive capped by Anderson's
short run to go up 21-14 heading into
halftime.
"[Utah] played UCLA to the end,
Oregon State to the end," Gaffney
said. "This was definitely not an
overlooked team."
Things didn't get much better for
the Cardinal in the third quarter.
Senior inside linebacker Joe Hem
schoot came up big when he inter
cepted a tipped pass to halt Utah's
march deep in Stanford territory at
the start of the quarter, but Mont
gomery gave the ball right back by
fumbling near midfield on the fol
lowing possession. Despite cough
ing up the ball, Montgomery was
still by far Stanford's most impact
ful player on the afternoon and
would finish the game with eight re
ceptions for 131 yards on top of his
touchdown return.
The Cardinal offense, which
moved the ball just 28 yards in the
third quarter, committed its second
turnover of the quarter when Hogan
lost the ball after getting hit from be
hind. The turnovers only dug Stan
ford into a deeper hole, as two field
goals sandwiching Hogan's
turnover from Utah kicker An
drew Phillips gave the Utes a 24-14
lead early in the fourth quarter.
"We knew it would be a battle and
we didn't play well enough," Shaw
said. "Our front seven didn't play well
tonight. Some of the pressure was
our quarterback's fault and some
wasn't."
Not ready to lie down just yet, the
Cardinal shrugged off its mistakes
on offense to go on a 52-yard touch
down drive in just five plays. Once
again, Montgomery proved to be
the catalyst with a big 45-yard gain
on a screen pass that bailed Stan
ford out of a tough third-and-10 sit
uation. Hogan overthrew junior

wide receiver Devon Cajuste on a
back-shoulder fade on first-and
goal, but immediately went back to
him on the next snap that would pay
off in the form of a 7-yard touch
down.
After forcing a three-and-out
from the Utah offense, the Cardi
nal got the ball back down by six
points with 7:53 left in the game.
Despite never having found a
rhythm for most of the afternoon,
Hogan settled down as the Stan
ford offense reverted to its method
ical, efficient style of play. The jun
ior signal-caller completed his first

five passes of the drive, three of
which went to Montgomery for 10
or more yards, to march the Cardi
nal down to the Utah 14-yard line.
Rushes by Gaffney and Hogan
brought up a third-and-2 at the
Utah 6-yard line with about a
minute left in the game. But Stan
ford could not convert when it mat
tered the most. On third down,
Hogan's pass intended for junior
tight end Charlie Hopkins fell in
complete on a play that was de
signed to get the ball to fifth-year
senior fullback Ryan Hewitt, and on
the final attempt, Utah brought

pressure to force an overthrown
ball from Hogan.
"It's about how we respond from
here on out," said fifth-year senior
outside linebacker Trent Murphy,
who recorded two tackles for loss
on Saturday. "It's a long season.
There are still a lot of games to
win."
Stanford will have to regroup
quickly as it hosts No. 9 UCLA next
Saturday during Homecoming
weekend.

Fifth-year senior defensive end Ben Gardner (right) fought through injury to help lead a weakened Cardinal
defensive line. Gardner's effort was not enough, however, as the Utes shocked Stanford with a 27-21 win.
