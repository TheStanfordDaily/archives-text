## EPASA tutoring goes beyond the classroom 
### MINKEE SOHN 
The East Palo Alto Stanford Academy
(EPASA), a long-standing organization of the
Haas Center's Education Partnerships pro
gram, has undergone significant changes since
its inception in 1986 with new offerings in store.
Over the past 27 years, EPASA has been
pairing Stanford tutors with seventh and eighth
grade students from the Ravenswood City
School District to provide weekly tutoring in top

ics such as math and writing for one to two
years.
EPASA Director Theresa Metz said that be
yond the academic tutoring, the program fosters
more personal relationships with the middle
schoolers and their families. Aiming to maximize
the students' education, the program has also es
tablished working relationships with the princi
pals and teachers of the schools the children at-

tend.
These key relationships
build the strong "sense of
connectedness and commu
nity" that Metz sees as a
unique quality for the pro
gram.
Amika Guillaume, princi
pal of Cesar Chavez & Green
Oaks Academy appreciates
Stanford's dedication to the
local schools.
"[Workers at EPASA] in
vest in our students over
time," she said. "We value
their partnership."
During a tutor orienta
tion on Oct. 6, administra
tors from the Haas Center
discussed the objectives of
EPASA with tutors volun
teering for the program.
EPASA aims to strength
en its focus on community
connectedness by develop
ing a greater degree of com
mitment on the part of Stan
ford tutors and better com
municate what the pro
gram's needs are to those in
volved.
Co Tran 'l7, a freshman
tutor for EPASA, said that
she was involved because
seventh grade was rather a
pivotal year for her, especial
ly because she felt people
took interest in her academ
ic career. She added that
EPASA middle-schoolers
are at a time in their lives
during which they decide the
kind of person they are go
ing to be.
Improvement in EPASA
revolves around a core ques
tion, according to Metz: How
can EPASA provide this op

portunity to more people?
EPASA plans to launch a
concerted effort to involve
Stanford students in activi
ties other than tutoring and
mentoring, such as organiz
ing lunch and teaching elec
tives. EPASA will also invite
previous tutors to continue
building relationships with
the EPASA alumni.
The changes in EPASA
reflect a wider pattern as
the Haas Center's Educa
tion Partnerships programs
collectively adjust to chang
ing needs in education.
As STEM fields play in
creasing roles in society,
Metz discussed a growing in
terest in fields such as com
puter science, which EPASA
now offers electives for.
According to Kelly Beck,
director for education part
nerships, the staff is very ex
cited about this year's
launch of Preschool Counts,
a math literacy program de
signed for students in early
childhood. The Haas Center
also offers the Science in
Service program, providing
youth with what Beck called
"hands-on discovery in sci
ence."
According to Metz, the
Haas Center's Education
Partnerships' early pro
grams aim to create a sturdy
basis for children on their
paths to higher education,
and participation in EPASA
enables teenager to make
smarter choices later on
about their academics in
high school.
"All our programs are the
puzzle pieces that fit togeth
er for our efforts in educa
tion," Metz said.
