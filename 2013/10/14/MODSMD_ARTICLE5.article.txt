### KYLIE JUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a study from the Office of the Vice
Provost for Online Learning (VPOL), re
searchers found that seniors between the
ages of 60 and 70 encompass the age demo
graphic that posts most often on Coursera
forums.
Marc Sanders Ph.D. '94, instructional
designer for VPOL; Jane Manning, M.A.
'93 Ph.D. '94, director of platforms for
VPOL; and Jonathan Huang 'O5, a postdoc
toral scholar in the Computer Science de
partment, analyzed survey data from 32
Coursera classes for which 11.1 percent of
students responded.
The study was inspired by the respons
es to the researchers' previous look into fo
rum usage and student grades in massive
open online courses (MOOCs).
Although the largest group of students
who responded to the survey were between
the ages of 20 and 30, the survey results re
vealed that seniors between the ages of 60
and 70 posted the most on forums and that
with the exception of 70- to 75-year-olds
the likelihood of posting rose with age.
"It's just that the 20- to 30-year-olds
don't post as much as the other people,"
