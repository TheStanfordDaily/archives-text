## Age linked to forum post rate on Coursera Study finds 60 to 70 year-olds most likely to post in online discuss ions 
### KYLIE JUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a study from the Office of the Vice
Provost for Online Learning (VPOL), re
searchers found that seniors between the
ages of 60 and 70 encompass the age demo
graphic that posts most often on Coursera
forums.
Marc Sanders Ph.D. '94, instructional
designer for VPOL; Jane Manning, M.A.
'93 Ph.D. '94, director of platforms for
VPOL; and Jonathan Huang 'O5, a postdoc
toral scholar in the Computer Science de
partment, analyzed survey data from 32
Coursera classes for which 11.1 percent of
students responded.
The study was inspired by the respons
es to the researchers' previous look into fo
rum usage and student grades in massive
open online courses (MOOCs).
Although the largest group of students
who responded to the survey were between
the ages of 20 and 30, the survey results re
vealed that seniors between the ages of 60
and 70 posted the most on forums and that
with the exception of 70- to 75-year-olds
the likelihood of posting rose with age.
"It's just that the 20- to 30-year-olds
don't post as much as the other people,"
Manning said. "I think there are a
lot for different possible explana
tions for that."
Fred Turner, an associate pro
fessor of communication, explained
that it would be difficult to predict
or put hard numbers on exactly
why different groups of people post
online.
"I just think that posting is just
something that most everyone does
these days, and so getting a kind of
quantity out of that depends almost
entirely on the social and cultural
context of the kind of posting
they're doing," Turner said.
Julia Stiglitz M.A./MBA 'lO,
Coursera's director of business de
velopment and strategic partner
ships, provided some general sta
tistics for the company's user de
mographics.
"[The average age of users] is
between 25 and 35," Stiglitz said.
"[The study] is surprising just giv
en the average age."
Stiglitz said users have a variety
of motivations for taking Coursera
courses.
"About 50 percent of people who
are signed up say that they're tak
ing courses for job-related rea

sons," Stiglitz said. "There are also
a high percentage of students who
are taking it just for enjoyment
reasons."
Keith Devlin, co-founder and ex
ecutive director of Stanford's Hu
man-Sciences and Technologies
Advanced Research Institute (H
-STAR), teaches a class on Coursera
called Introduction to Mathemati
cal Thinking. Through his experi
ence teaching a MOOC, Devlin did
not find the results of the study
surprising.
"I always identify students who
are very good contributors, and I
appoint them as community TAs,"
Devlin said. "So I knew anecdotally
that the active contributors, and
certainly the ones that have matu
rity, were indeed certainly well into
their 50s. It didn't surprise me to
hear that many of them were actu
ally into their 60s and 705."
Devlin believes that MOOCs
provide an easy way for seniors to
be mentally active in their free
time.
"One of the great things that
MOOCs offer is that people ... can
be students again," Devlin said. "I
think it's not surprising that [se
niors] are extremely keen and ea
ger and active students because
they've got a lot of time, and this
gives them an awful lot of stimula
tion in their lives."

Manager Jane Marcus Ph.D. 'B5,
has followed MOOCs for several
years and also was not surprised by
the results of the study. At Stan
ford, she worked to support the use
of technology in the University's
academic and administrative func

tions.
"[Seniors] have got lots of ener
gy and lots of time on their hands
and can start second careers, and
those careers don't necessarily
have to be paying careers," Marcus
said. "MOOCs can help them on

those intellectual journeys."
Devlin explained that he origi
nally became involved with MOOCs
because of their potential to pro
vide quality education to parts of
the world without access. Now he's
pleased that the courses are offer
ing access to education to an entire
ly different group: seniors.
"I think it's neat that we're ac
tually providing something that
gives stimulation and interest to a
whole older generation," Devlin
said. "It's a contribution to society,
and it can only do us a lot of good."
Like Stiglitz, Marcus expressed
interest in seeing the breakdown of
demographics based on courses.
"I would love to see the Cours
era courses broken down into disci
plines and then the demographic
data analyzed within those disci
plines," Marcus said.
In fact, along with forum con
tent, breaking demographics down
by discipline is one of the many
items that Huang hopes to study
further.
"There's so much data," Huang
said. "For the very first time we
have huge amounts of demographic
data combined with grade data.
And that's going to give us terrific
insights that no one's been able to
get before."

"I think it's neat that we're ac
tually providing something that
gives stimulation and interest to a
whole older generation," Devlin
said. "It's a contribution to society,
and it can only do us a lot of good."
Like Stiglitz, Marcus expressed
interest in seeing the breakdown of
demographics based on courses.
"I would love to see the Cours
era courses broken down into disci
plines and then the demographic
data analyzed within those disci
plines," Marcus said.
In fact, along with forum con
tent, breaking demographics down
by discipline is one of the many
items that Huang hopes to study
further.
"There's so much data," Huang
said. "For the very first time we
have huge amounts of demographic
data combined with grade data.
And that's going to give us terrific
insights that no one's been able to
get before."

In a study from the Office of the Vice
Provost for Online Learning (VPOL), re
searchers found that seniors between the
ages of 60 and 70 encompass the age demo
graphic that posts most often on Coursera
forums.
Marc Sanders Ph.D. '94, instructional
designer for VPOL; Jane Manning, M.A.
'93 Ph.D. '94, director of platforms for
VPOL; and Jonathan Huang 'O5, a postdoc
toral scholar in the Computer Science de
partment, analyzed survey data from 32
Coursera classes for which 11.1 percent of
students responded.
The study was inspired by the respons
es to the researchers' previous look into fo
rum usage and student grades in massive
open online courses (MOOCs).
Although the largest group of students
who responded to the survey were between
the ages of 20 and 30, the survey results re
vealed that seniors between the ages of 60
and 70 posted the most on forums and that
with the exception of 70- to 75-year-olds
the likelihood of posting rose with age.
"It's just that the 20- to 30-year-olds
don't post as much as the other people,"
Manning said. "I think there are a
lot for different possible explana
tions for that."
Fred Turner, an associate pro
fessor of communication, explained
that it would be difficult to predict
or put hard numbers on exactly
why different groups of people post
online.
"I just think that posting is just
something that most everyone does
these days, and so getting a kind of
quantity out of that depends almost
entirely on the social and cultural
context of the kind of posting
they're doing," Turner said.
Julia Stiglitz M.A./MBA 'lO,
Coursera's director of business de
velopment and strategic partner
ships, provided some general sta
tistics for the company's user de
mographics.
"[The average age of users] is
between 25 and 35," Stiglitz said.
"[The study] is surprising just giv
en the average age."
Stiglitz said users have a variety
of motivations for taking Coursera
courses.
"About 50 percent of people who
are signed up say that they're tak
ing courses for job-related rea

sons," Stiglitz said. "There are also
a high percentage of students who
are taking it just for enjoyment
reasons."
Keith Devlin, co-founder and ex
ecutive director of Stanford's Hu
man-Sciences and Technologies
Advanced Research Institute (H
-STAR), teaches a class on Coursera
called Introduction to Mathemati
cal Thinking. Through his experi
ence teaching a MOOC, Devlin did
not find the results of the study
surprising.
"I always identify students who
are very good contributors, and I
appoint them as community TAs,"
Devlin said. "So I knew anecdotally
that the active contributors, and
certainly the ones that have matu
rity, were indeed certainly well into
their 50s. It didn't surprise me to
hear that many of them were actu
ally into their 60s and 705."
Devlin believes that MOOCs
provide an easy way for seniors to
be mentally active in their free
time.
"One of the great things that
MOOCs offer is that people ... can
be students again," Devlin said. "I
think it's not surprising that [se
niors] are extremely keen and ea
ger and active students because
they've got a lot of time, and this
gives them an awful lot of stimula
tion in their lives."

Manager Jane Marcus Ph.D. 'B5,
has followed MOOCs for several
years and also was not surprised by
the results of the study. At Stan
ford, she worked to support the use
of technology in the University's
academic and administrative func

tions.
"[Seniors] have got lots of ener
gy and lots of time on their hands
and can start second careers, and
those careers don't necessarily
have to be paying careers," Marcus
said. "MOOCs can help them on

those intellectual journeys."
Devlin explained that he origi
nally became involved with MOOCs
because of their potential to pro
vide quality education to parts of
the world without access. Now he's
pleased that the courses are offer
ing access to education to an entire
ly different group: seniors.
