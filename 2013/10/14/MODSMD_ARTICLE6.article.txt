# STUDENT LIFE
## Program strengthens dorm culture New Community Leader program launched 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
This year, Castano launched its
pilot Community Leader program,
hiring four unpaid staff to help de
velop the community of the upper
classmen dorm.
The program grew out of the
Residential Fellow's (RF) desire to
make the culture of the dorm's
community more long-lasting. Pe
ter Kao, RF of Castano and associ
ate professor of Medicine, had dis
cussed with Student Housing about
creating a program to bring back
residents for several years, espe
cially since Castano doesn't have a
pre-assignment system like theme
dorms.
"Most residents in Castano are
sophomores," said Kao, explaining
the difficulty of creating dorm cul
ture. "They've already used their
Tier 2 and it's difficult to come back
with a Tier 3. With the current sys
tem with draw numbers, it's sort of
random, and students get shuffled
every year."
Tenzin Atruktsang 'l4, a current
Residential Assistant (RA) in Cas
tano, said that traditionally it's dif
ficult for upperclassmen to get to
know people in the dorm outside of
their draw groups.
"When I lived in Castano, I only
knew my draw group," Atruktsang
said. "It was always awk
ward when I was brushing
my teeth in the morning and
I didn't know who the person
next to me was."
A Community Leader's
role would be to work with
the staff, meeting regularly
to talk about how the resi
dents are doing, evaluating
the community in the dorm
and encouraging residents to
stay involved within the
dorm especially for soph
omores.
"It's our job to combat
the sophomore slum," said
Rachel Crovello 'l5, a com
munity leader in Castano.
"Inadvertently, Manz has
turned into sophomore ghet
to, the place where everyone
that didn't get into Toyon
goes. As people transition

out of freshmen dorms, we
work to make sure they don't
lose the freshman culture
that the freshman RAs had
worked so hard for."
Crovello reported that
she was in the process of in
dividually emailing all 113
residents of Castano in order
to get to know them better.
Alison Nguyen 'l5, another
Community Leader, holds
tea sessions for residents to
socialize with one another
and listed other potential
community developing activ
ities, such as arts and crafts
sessions and communal
cooking.
"I became a community
leader because, aside from
the fact that I had a great
time being part of the Cas
tano family, I didn't want to
just be a dorm leader that
put on social programming,"
Nguyen said. "I wanted to
also be a mentor who could
support my peers."
Atrukstang said he has

already seen the work of
Community Leaders pay off
in the first three weeks of
classes.
"A lot of people are in
their rooms with their doors
open [and] there's been
great attendance in dorm
events and crosstalk be
tween groups," Atruksang
said.
The Community Leaders
all take MEDI3S: Communi
ty Leadership, a weekly
class offered by Residential
Education and led by Kim
Wisckol, according to Kao.
The class focuses on topics
such as emotional intelli
gence, facilitating meetings
and group dynamics, and on
leading discussions on more
serious topics such as race,
ethnicity, spirituality and
personal development. Wis
ckol hopes to re-offer this
class every quarter.
"The training that is of
fered to RAs is so effective,
why limit that to just RAs?"

Wisckol said. "Some of those
topics [discussed during RA
training] are valuable for all
people to learn." "This is
for people that are not pre
pared to be on call for 24
hours like an RA but still
want the enrichment, the
connecting and program
ming," Wisckol added.
According to Kao and
Wisckol, about 15 previous
residents returned to live in
Castano.
"It's all about trying to
make sure that each resident
feels comfortable in Cas
tano," Kao said. "We want to
pass culture down longitudi
nally, a community where
people are interested in each
other. Within this communi
ty, there would be horizontal
learning where students
learn from their peers
through deep conversa
tions."

their rooms with their doors
open [and] there's been
great attendance in dorm
events and crosstalk be
tween groups," Atruksang
said.
The Community Leaders
all take MEDI3S: Communi
ty Leadership, a weekly
class offered by Residential
Education and led by Kim
Wisckol, according to Kao.
The class focuses on topics
such as emotional intelli
gence, facilitating meetings
and group dynamics, and on
leading discussions on more
serious topics such as race,
ethnicity, spirituality and
personal development. Wis
ckol hopes to re-offer this
class every quarter.
"The training that is of
fered to RAs is so effective,
why limit that to just RAs?"

Wisckol said. "Some of those
topics [discussed during RA
training] are valuable for all
people to learn." "This is
for people that are not pre
pared to be on call for 24
hours like an RA but still
want the enrichment, the
connecting and program
ming," Wisckol added.
According to Kao and
Wisckol, about 15 previous
residents returned to live in
Castano.
"It's all about trying to
make sure that each resident
feels comfortable in Cas
tano," Kao said. "We want to
pass culture down longitudi
nally, a community where
people are interested in each
other. Within this communi
ty, there would be horizontal
learning where students
learn from their peers
through deep conversa
tions."

With increasing number of sophomores eating at Manzanita Dining, Castaño is offering a new Community Leadership
Program which helps to develop upperclassman dorm culture by encouraging student interactions.
This year, Castano launched its
pilot Community Leader program,
hiring four unpaid staff to help de
velop the community of the upper
classmen dorm.
The program grew out of the
Residential Fellow's (RF) desire to
make the culture of the dorm's
community more long-lasting. Pe
ter Kao, RF of Castano and associ
ate professor of Medicine, had dis
cussed with Student Housing about
creating a program to bring back
residents for several years, espe
cially since Castano doesn't have a
pre-assignment system like theme
dorms.
"Most residents in Castano are
sophomores," said Kao, explaining
the difficulty of creating dorm cul
ture. "They've already used their
Tier 2 and it's difficult to come back
with a Tier 3. With the current sys
tem with draw numbers, it's sort of
random, and students get shuffled
every year."
Tenzin Atruktsang 'l4, a current
Residential Assistant (RA) in Cas
tano, said that traditionally it's dif
ficult for upperclassmen to get to
know people in the dorm outside of
their draw groups.
"When I lived in Castano, I only
knew my draw group," Atruktsang
said. "It was always awk
ward when I was brushing
my teeth in the morning and
I didn't know who the person
next to me was."
A Community Leader's
role would be to work with
the staff, meeting regularly
to talk about how the resi
dents are doing, evaluating
the community in the dorm
and encouraging residents to
stay involved within the
dorm especially for soph
omores.
"It's our job to combat
the sophomore slum," said
Rachel Crovello 'l5, a com
munity leader in Castano.
"Inadvertently, Manz has
turned into sophomore ghet
to, the place where everyone
that didn't get into Toyon
goes. As people transition

out of freshmen dorms, we
work to make sure they don't
lose the freshman culture
that the freshman RAs had
worked so hard for."
Crovello reported that
she was in the process of in
dividually emailing all 113
residents of Castano in order
to get to know them better.
Alison Nguyen 'l5, another
Community Leader, holds
tea sessions for residents to
socialize with one another
and listed other potential
community developing activ
ities, such as arts and crafts
sessions and communal
cooking.
"I became a community
leader because, aside from
the fact that I had a great
time being part of the Cas
tano family, I didn't want to
just be a dorm leader that
put on social programming,"
Nguyen said. "I wanted to
also be a mentor who could
support my peers."
Atrukstang said he has

already seen the work of
Community Leaders pay off
in the first three weeks of
classes.
"A lot of people are in
their rooms with their doors
open [and] there's been
great attendance in dorm
events and crosstalk be
tween groups," Atruksang
said.
