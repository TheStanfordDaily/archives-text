## Program strengthens dorm culture New Community Leader program launched 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
This year, Castano launched its
pilot Community Leader program,
hiring four unpaid staff to help de
velop the community of the upper
classmen dorm.
The program grew out of the
Residential Fellow's (RF) desire to
make the culture of the dorm's
community more long-lasting. Pe
ter Kao, RF of Castano and associ
ate professor of Medicine, had dis
cussed with Student Housing about
creating a program to bring back
residents for several years, espe
cially since Castano doesn't have a
pre-assignment system like theme
dorms.
"Most residents in Castano are
sophomores," said Kao, explaining
the difficulty of creating dorm cul
ture. "They've already used their
Tier 2 and it's difficult to come back
with a Tier 3. With the current sys
tem with draw numbers, it's sort of
random, and students get shuffled
every year."
Tenzin Atruktsang 'l4, a current
Residential Assistant (RA) in Cas
tano, said that traditionally it's dif
ficult for upperclassmen to get to
know people in the dorm outside of
their draw groups.
"When I lived in Castano, I only
knew my draw group," Atruktsang
