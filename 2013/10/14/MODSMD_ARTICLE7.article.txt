## FacSen talks scheduling changes Registrars proposal to start classes early prompts debate 
### BAKER TILNEY DESK EDITOR 
The first meeting of the 46th
Faculty Senate took place last
Thursday, with a primary focus of
discussing proposed changes to the
academic course schedule that
would standardize class start times
with the earliest at 8:30 a.m.
Prior to the scheduling discus
sion, President John Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 provided updates about various
projects and administrative mat
ters. These included a summary of
the previous year's fundraising ef
forts, discussion of the stepping
down of Dean of the School of Engi
neering Jim Plummer M.S. '67
Ph.D. '7l, Stanford's reaccredita
tion and the construction underway
around campus.
Senate Chair David Palumbo-
Liu also congratulated Thomas
Siidhof and Michael Levitt for their
recent Nobel Prize awards and Dr.
David Lobell Ph.D. 'O5 and Dr.
Kevin Boyce for receiving
Mac Arthur fellowships in Septem
ber.
Scheduling debate
University Registrar Tom Black
presented a modified form of the
scheduling proposal created by the
registrar's office and Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education Har
ry Elam.
A central goal of the proposal is
simplification of the overall sched
ule, which is more complex than
Stanford's peer institutions and can
be difficult for students to navigate.
Black discussed the need to
eliminate overlap in class times by
moving courses away from peak
times and coordinating scheduling
between departments. He
stressed that compromise
between teachers and stu
dents is key.
"We believe that the
schedule can fit our curricu
lum, but we're going to all
have to work together to
make that happen," Black
said.
Black believes that the
suggested changes will alle
viate the need for students to
double-book two classes into
the same time slot a prac
tice the University is still
considering disallowing. Ac
cording to the registrar,
there are about 1,000 stu
dents double-booked in any
given quarter.

Elam weighed in, citing
Brown University and the
University of Chicago
where Black worked before
coming to Stanford as two
institutions with more
streamlined scheduling sys
tems.
The Senate allowed stu
dent representatives to voice
their views on the proposal
before Black solicited discus
sion from faculty senators.
Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6,
chair of undergraduate life
for the ASSU Senate, and
ASSU Executive Dan Ash
ton 'l4 thanked the Senate
for incorporating student
feedback into the changed
proposal. They argued
against the 8:30 a.m. class
start time, mentioning the
importance of sleep and say
ing that the extra half hour of
time for class would be more
favorable at the end of the

day rather than in the morn
ing.
"We believe that by shift
ing everything down 30 min
utes, you still have the same
utilization," Mouzykantskii
said.
An active debate among
the faculty followed, with
most of the participants
agreeing with the suggestion
to make 9 a.m. the earliest
class time.
Kathryn Moler 'BB Ph.D.
'95, associate professor of
physics and applied physics,
worried that students would
simply not attend 8:30 a.m.
classes. She used her experi
ence teaching a 9 a.m.
Physics 61 lecture as an ex
ample.
"I can report that by the
third or fourth week of the
quarter, even the kids who
love the class and are very
committed to physics are

dragging themselves into the
classroom," Moler said.
Marcia Stefanick Ph.D.
'B2 ED. 'B4, professor of med
icine and of obstetrics and gy
necology, pointed out the fact
that some students are natu
ral larks and others night
owls and argued that Stan
ford should focus more on
sleep hygiene in general.
On the other hand, Paula
Moya, associate professor of
English, argued that a sched
ule should include early class
es to recognize diversity of
habits in students and profes
sors.
"There is a subsection of
students who wake up, who
are up at 8 a.m. and want to
take a class," Moya said.
Brad Osgood, senior asso
ciate dean for student affairs
in the School of Engineering,
stressed that departments
will need to collaborate on
scheduling to make any
changes successful.
"It's not as though de
partments have been rush
ing to collaborate in the past,
but if ever there was a mo
ment for that to happen, it's
now," Osgood said.
The senate did not take a
vote on the proposed sched
ule changes at the end of the
discussion, so the items re
main up for consideration.
Development, reaccreditation
and construction
At the meeting, Hen
nessy gave a summary of
fundraising in the last year.
Stanford raised $931.6 mil
lion from over 82,000 fami
lies or individual donors. The
money was spent on a vari
ety of initiatives.
"A lot of this money went
to medicine in our new hospi
tal, but a lot of it also went to
issues like financial aid and
faculty endowment, which
continue to be critical issues
for us, especially given a sce
nario in Washington which is
not the most rosy for re
search universities," Hen
nessy said.
Hennessy also addressed
the hack of the Stanford net
work that occurred during
the summer and advised fac
ulty to encrypt mobile de
vices, use complex pass
words and avoid the use of
older, less secure computers
that the University plans to
replace.
For his part, Etchemendy
announced that the Western
Association of Schools and
Colleges (WASC) reaccredit
ed Stanford in a process that
took six and a half years.
The reaccreditation will
last for ten years and re
quires no report during that
period. Etchemendy stated
that the terms of the reac
creditation is unheard of.
"I think we're the first in
stitution probably [during
the six-and-a-half years of
the review] that has received
ten years of accreditation un
interrupted by an interim re
port," Etchemendy said.
Etchemendy ended his
update by describing the
progress of the nearly $5OO
- central energy facili
ty. The central facility is ap
proximately 40 percent com
plete, with the electrical sub
station and hot water distri
bution system the reason
for construction on roads
around campus each
about 60 percent completed.
"When we are done with
this, we will have an effi
cient, sustainable energy
system unlike just about any
university in the world,"
Etchemendy said. "It will be
incredible."
The Faculty Senate will
meet again on Oct. 24.

day rather than in the morn
ing.
"We believe that by shift
ing everything down 30 min
utes, you still have the same
utilization," Mouzykantskii
said.
An active debate among
the faculty followed, with
most of the participants
agreeing with the suggestion
to make 9 a.m. the earliest
class time.
Kathryn Moler 'BB Ph.D.
'95, associate professor of
physics and applied physics,
worried that students would
simply not attend 8:30 a.m.
classes. She used her experi
ence teaching a 9 a.m.
Physics 61 lecture as an ex
ample.
"I can report that by the
third or fourth week of the
quarter, even the kids who
love the class and are very
committed to physics are

dragging themselves into the
classroom," Moler said.
Marcia Stefanick Ph.D.
'B2 ED. 'B4, professor of med
icine and of obstetrics and gy
necology, pointed out the fact
that some students are natu
ral larks and others night
owls and argued that Stan
ford should focus more on
sleep hygiene in general.
On the other hand, Paula
Moya, associate professor of
English, argued that a sched
ule should include early class
es to recognize diversity of
habits in students and profes
sors.
"There is a subsection of
students who wake up, who
are up at 8 a.m. and want to
take a class," Moya said.
Brad Osgood, senior asso
ciate dean for student affairs
in the School of Engineering,
stressed that departments
will need to collaborate on
scheduling to make any
changes successful.
"It's not as though de
partments have been rush
ing to collaborate in the past,
but if ever there was a mo
ment for that to happen, it's
now," Osgood said.
The senate did not take a
vote on the proposed sched
ule changes at the end of the
discussion, so the items re
main up for consideration.
Development, reaccreditation
and construction
At the meeting, Hen
nessy gave a summary of
fundraising in the last year.
Stanford raised $931.6 mil
lion from over 82,000 fami
lies or individual donors. The
money was spent on a vari
ety of initiatives.
"A lot of this money went
to medicine in our new hospi
tal, but a lot of it also went to
issues like financial aid and
faculty endowment, which
continue to be critical issues
for us, especially given a sce
nario in Washington which is
not the most rosy for re
search universities," Hen
nessy said.
Hennessy also addressed
the hack of the Stanford net
work that occurred during
the summer and advised fac
ulty to encrypt mobile de
vices, use complex pass
words and avoid the use of
older, less secure computers
that the University plans to
replace.
For his part, Etchemendy
announced that the Western
Association of Schools and
Colleges (WASC) reaccredit
ed Stanford in a process that
took six and a half years.
The reaccreditation will
last for ten years and re
quires no report during that
period. Etchemendy stated
that the terms of the reac
creditation is unheard of.
"I think we're the first in
stitution probably [during
the six-and-a-half years of
the review] that has received
ten years of accreditation un
interrupted by an interim re
port," Etchemendy said.
Etchemendy ended his
update by describing the
progress of the nearly $5OO
- central energy facili
ty. The central facility is ap
proximately 40 percent com
plete, with the electrical sub
station and hot water distri
bution system the reason
for construction on roads
around campus each
about 60 percent completed.
"When we are done with
this, we will have an effi
cient, sustainable energy
system unlike just about any
university in the world,"
Etchemendy said. "It will be
incredible."
The Faculty Senate will
meet again on Oct. 24.

Tom Black, University Registrar, presented a proposal to
standardize course scheduling to the Faculty Senate on
Thursday. The plan was met with mixed reactions.
The first meeting of the 46th
Faculty Senate took place last
Thursday, with a primary focus of
discussing proposed changes to the
academic course schedule that
would standardize class start times
with the earliest at 8:30 a.m.
Prior to the scheduling discus
sion, President John Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 provided updates about various
projects and administrative mat
ters. These included a summary of
the previous year's fundraising ef
forts, discussion of the stepping
down of Dean of the School of Engi
neering Jim Plummer M.S. '67
Ph.D. '7l, Stanford's reaccredita
tion and the construction underway
around campus.
Senate Chair David Palumbo-
Liu also congratulated Thomas
Siidhof and Michael Levitt for their
recent Nobel Prize awards and Dr.
David Lobell Ph.D. 'O5 and Dr.
Kevin Boyce for receiving
Mac Arthur fellowships in Septem
ber.
Scheduling debate
University Registrar Tom Black
presented a modified form of the
scheduling proposal created by the
registrar's office and Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education Har
ry Elam.
A central goal of the proposal is
simplification of the overall sched
ule, which is more complex than
Stanford's peer institutions and can
be difficult for students to navigate.
Black discussed the need to
eliminate overlap in class times by
moving courses away from peak
times and coordinating scheduling
between departments. He
stressed that compromise
between teachers and stu
dents is key.
"We believe that the
schedule can fit our curricu
lum, but we're going to all
have to work together to
make that happen," Black
said.
Black believes that the
suggested changes will alle
viate the need for students to
double-book two classes into
the same time slot a prac
tice the University is still
considering disallowing. Ac
cording to the registrar,
there are about 1,000 stu
dents double-booked in any
given quarter.

Elam weighed in, citing
Brown University and the
University of Chicago
where Black worked before
coming to Stanford as two
institutions with more
streamlined scheduling sys
tems.
The Senate allowed stu
dent representatives to voice
their views on the proposal
before Black solicited discus
sion from faculty senators.
Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6,
chair of undergraduate life
for the ASSU Senate, and
ASSU Executive Dan Ash
ton 'l4 thanked the Senate
for incorporating student
feedback into the changed
proposal. They argued
against the 8:30 a.m. class
start time, mentioning the
importance of sleep and say
ing that the extra half hour of
time for class would be more
favorable at the end of the

day rather than in the morn
ing.
"We believe that by shift
ing everything down 30 min

For his part, Etchemendy
announced that the Western
Association of Schools and
Colleges (WASC) reaccredit
ed Stanford in a process that
took six and a half years.
The reaccreditation will
last for ten years and re
quires no report during that
period. Etchemendy stated
that the terms of the reac
creditation is unheard of.
"I think we're the first in
stitution probably [during
the six-and-a-half years of
the review] that has received
ten years of accreditation un
interrupted by an interim re
port," Etchemendy said.
Etchemendy ended his
update by describing the
progress of the nearly $5OO
- central energy facili
ty. The central facility is ap
proximately 40 percent com
plete, with the electrical sub
station and hot water distri
bution system the reason
for construction on roads
around campus each
about 60 percent completed.
"When we are done with
this, we will have an effi
cient, sustainable energy
system unlike just about any
university in the world,"
Etchemendy said. "It will be
incredible."
The Faculty Senate will
meet again on Oct. 24.
