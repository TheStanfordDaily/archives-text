The first meeting of the 46th

Thursday, with a primary focus of
discussing proposed changes to the
academic course schedule that
would standardize class start times
with the earliest at 8:30 a.m.
Prior to the scheduling discus
sion, President John Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 provided updates about various
projects and administrative mat
ters. These included a summary of
the previous year's fundraising ef
forts, discussion of the stepping
down of Dean of the School of Engi
neering Jim Plummer M.S. '67
Ph.D. '7l, Stanford's reaccredita
tion and the construction underway
around campus.
Senate Chair David Palumbo-
Liu also congratulated Thomas
Siidhof and Michael Levitt for their
recent Nobel Prize awards and Dr.
David Lobell Ph.D. 'O5 and Dr.
Kevin Boyce for receiving
Mac Arthur fellowships in Septem
ber.
Scheduling debate
University Registrar Tom Black
presented a modified form of the
scheduling proposal created by the
registrar's office and Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education Har
ry Elam.
A central goal of the proposal is
simplification of the overall sched
ule, which is more complex than
Stanford's peer institutions and can
be difficult for students to navigate.
Black discussed the need to
eliminate overlap in class times by
moving courses away from peak
times and coordinating scheduling
