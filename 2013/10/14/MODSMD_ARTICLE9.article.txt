## Blurred Art 
### Alli Rath 
Countless online articles have
deemed the hit song
"Blurred Lines" to be Robin
Thicke's "rape anthem," claiming
that the song glorifies male domi
nance in denial of a woman's sexual
agency, especially in tandem with
its controversial music video.
Much has been written about
the song and its accompanying
video, but few have assessed the
artistic inclinations of the piece.
Few have asked questions about
what visual tropes were used, about
how the viewer's gaze is directed in
the video and the effect that indi
vidual phrases have on the listener.
I acknowledge that there are
some classless moments in the
song. References to "bitches" and
penis size will never be classy or
even acceptable in my book, but
that does not necessarily mean that
the song is "rapey."
The people I have spoken with
are most familiar with the lines trot
ted out by every anti-"Blurred
Lines" writer. "I know you want it"
appears on repeat, as does "You're a
good girl." What these writers nev
er mention is that the majority of
the lyrics tend to mitigate any ques
tionable implications of "I know you
want it."
So this guy thinks he knows that
the woman wants him, but he is still
very much focused on convincing
her to choose him. While that may
be arrogant and crass, it is not
predatory. "I know you want it" is
far different from, "I know you
don't want it, and I am going to
force myself upon you."
Many young people have met
another person's eye at a club or
bar and thought, "Oh, this one has
been throwing looks at me all night.
Definitely wants me." The blurred
lines in question could be interpret
ed as the decision of whether to ap
proach someone new.
On the other hand, they could al
so reference the dichotomy of a
girl's outward appearance and any
potentially hidden sexual desires, or
the blurred lines of a girl in a rela
tionship meeting someone new; the
possibilities for interpretation are
virtually limitless.
The visual interpretation of the
video is somewhat less flexible if
you observe the video through the
lens of an art critic. Articles claim
that the video objectifies women
and displays them as inferior, posit
ing that, in the video, "the only peo
ple worthy of clothes are men."
In feminist film theory, much of
the stress is put on the typically
male gaze present in classic Holly
wood. The woman is the object of
the gaze (often in the form of the
camera portraying the woman, un
aware she is being watched, in a
voyeuristic sense). The woman
rarely moves the narrative for
ward, and she often makes her de
cisions based on a man, while male
agents typically drive the actual
storyline.
If we view the "Blurred Lines"
video through this lens, it becomes
instantly clear that the women own
this video. They stare the viewer
right in the eye, command the cam
era and it is their gaze the camera
most often follows, not that of the
male singers.
They do not spread their legs
and pose sexily for the camera; they
frolic around with odd props, act

generally silly and turn the whole
video into a caricature of the typi
cally demeaning videos of artists
like 50 Cent (anyone remember
"Candy Shop"?).
Sure, things would be more eq
uitable if the men were naked as
well, but I have no interest in seeing
a naked, middle-aged Robin Thicke.
I take no offense at nudity; in the
words of Robin Thicke's wife Paula
Patton, "Violence is ugly. Nudity is
not."
The most wonderful and chal
lenging aspect of art is that mean
ing is rarely set. Much of a song,
painting, photo or sculpture comes
down to how people interpret the
information presented.
Thicke later remarked of the
song, "It's supposed to stir conver
sation, it's supposed to make us talk
about what's important and what
the relationships between men and
women are." Mission accomplished.
The main thing that bothers me
about the controversy surrounding
"Blurred Lines" is the lack of out
cry about genuinely troublesome
lyrics present in a lot of popular rap
and hip-hop songs.
For example, despite the fact
that Beyonce is lauded as a champi
on of strong, beautiful and inde
pendent women, I failed to see any
negative press surrounding her
song with Kanye West, "Big Ego."
The lyrics transparently refer to
Kanye's massive penis ahem,
"big ego" â€”with Beyonce singing,
"It's too big, it's too wide/ It's too
strong, it won't fit / It's too much,
it's too tough/... I love his big ego."
Another genuinely terrifying
song by Eminem called "Stay Wide
Awake" includes this gem in the
verse:
"I see my target, put my car in
park and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Bren
da and I pretend to befriend her...
... see whore, you're the kind of
girl that I'd assault
And rape then figure why not
try not to make your pussy wider?
Fuck you with an umbrella, then
open it up while the shit's inside ya."
The words leave me speechless
and horrified, yet for some reason,
the American public continues to
support Eminem's music, often
touting him as one of the best rap
pers of our time. Other offenders in
clude songs by Three 6 Mafia, Juve
nile and Lil Wayne, and the hit "Ice
Cream Paint Job" by TVga. The list
goes on and on and, until truly vio
lent lyrics are relegated to the past,
I refuse to take part in the railroad
ing of a relatively harmless al
beit sometimes tasteless song
like "Blurred Lines."
The question of defining human
desire is every bit as convoluted as
the meaning of "Blurred Lines."
Until we can make sense of our own
confused desires, songs like this will
continue to resonate across a broad
audience.
The only thing that is clear is
that there will never be an unassail
ably correct interpretation of
"Blurred Lines," but perhaps it
would be best to focus on the artists
whose songs unequivocally pro
mote rape culture.
