# CATCHING UP WITH TOBY GERHART
## 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When looking back at Stanford
football's meteoric rise from a low
ly Pac-10 doormat in 2006 to peren
nial BCS contender, it has become
impossible to ignore the contribu
tions of one former player who first
led the charge in lifting the Cardi
nal back into the national spotlight:
running back Toby Gerhart 'lO.
After enduring the pains of a 1-
11 season his freshman year, Ger
hart burst onto the national scene
in 2009 under Jim Harbaugh
rushing for 1,871 yards and 28
touchdowns, finishing second in
the 2009 Heisman Trophy voting
and molding, by example, the
team's new identity as a physical,
run-first bully.
As impressive as Gerhart and
Stanford were in the 2009 season,
he believes that they would proba
bly be no match for the 2013 ver
sion of the Cardinal due to the
tremendous depth and versatility
of this year's squad.
"They're dang good," Gerhart
said of the team. "They're proba
bly a better team then we were.
Just the depth that is there at
Stanford now is what's remark
able.
"When we were there, I don't
think we were as complete of a
team as they are now, and that's
not just with their starters....
Their defense is unbelievable. I
think their defense is the strength
of their team whereas I think when
I was there it was our offense.
They're definitely just a complete,
packaged team."
In his four seasons in the NFL
with the Minnesota Vikings, Ger
hart has seen sporadic playing

time as the backup to All-Pro Adri
an Peterson. Nevertheless, Ger
hart has enjoyed working with Pe
terson for his career thus far.
"It's been great to learn from
one of the best ever that's going

to play the game," Gerhart said.
"Now, I'm like his second set of
eyes. When he comes off the field,
he'll ask me what I think he
should have done differently or
what I saw. We have a good work

relationship."
"He's a monster," Gerhart con
tinued. "He doesn't get tired it
seems like, and it's really limited
my ability to get on the field, but
that's the nature of the game....
The great thing is I have a role and
I'm going out there and enjoying
it."
Life in the NFL has given Ger
hart some experiences off the field
that he has enjoyed. Gerhart noted
the opportunity to play in London
this season when the Vikings took
on the Pittsburgh Steelers as par
ticularly memorable.
"London was awesome.... I was
running around like a tourist in the
little off-time that we had trying to
see all the sites that I could see."
Gerhart said. "The fans were
great.... There was passion for
football, and it was just a lot of
fun."
While he certainly enjoys his
life in the NFL, Gerhart has never
strayed from his Stanford roots. As
one of the most famous and
beloved members of the Cardinal
in recent memory, Gerhart's name
is almost synonymous with Stan
ford football. Though no longer on
the Farm, Gerhart still keeps tabs
on the team and watches as many
games as he can.
Gerhart also stays in touch with
his former coach Jim Harbaugh
who attended Gerhart's wedding
this June as well as the growing
number of Stanford graduates in
the NFL.
"It seems like every week our
opponent has somebody from
Stanford, so I'll talk to them
pregame [and] postgame," Gerhart
said. "It's good to see a bunch of
