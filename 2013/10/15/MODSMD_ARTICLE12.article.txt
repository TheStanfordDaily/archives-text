## SUPER TUESDAY No Way to Govern 
### Marshall Watkins 
As the ongoing federal govern
ment shutdown nears a third
week, it's more than unfortu
nate that a second and infinitely
more severe crisis is imminent.
With just days left until the
United States runs out of money to
service its debt obligations, Democ
rats and Republicans remain at an
impasse in negotiations to advance
a stopgap measure for both crises,
in a situation that will require a de
gree of responsibility that neither
party has yet demonstrated.
First created during World War
I as a means for Congress to estab
lish an upper limit on federal bor
rowing, the debt ceiling caps the
amount of money that the federal
government can borrow through
the issuance of sovereign debt by
the Treasury Department to
fund spending obligations.
The current debt limit is just un
der $l7 trillion, a figure that was
actually exceeded earlier this year
but which has been sustained
through "extraordinary measures"
by the Treasury Department.
Those measures will be exhausted
on or around Oct. 17, at which point
the United States will no longer be
able to honor existing debt obliga
tions.
Historically, raising the debt
ceiling has been a relatively routine
matter since 1960, Congress has
increased the debt ceiling 78 times.
The consequences of failing to do so
this year would be catastrophic
discretionary spending, from de
fense to education, would stop, enti
tlement programs would face simi
lar squeezes and resolving the gap
between federal outlays and rev
enues would likely necessitate vast
tax hikes.
Beyond the short-term —but
still unprecedented domestic eco
nomic shocks, the likely downgrade
in the United States' credit rating
would prompt much higher borrow
ing costs for the foreseeable future
and the fundamental devaluation of
the global reserve currency, likely
resulting in a severe worldwide re
cession.
Of course, putting aside petty
partisan politics or at least ab
surd notions that Congress' failure
to endorse a debt ceiling hike would
have anything but severe conse
quences— in the debt ceiling de
bate would be a promising first step.
As desirable as a balanced budg
et — or fewer runaway deficits
may be, such an eventuality would
take years to attain without crip
pling growth. Jeopardizing the
United States' fiscal future for an
inconsistent and uncompromising
political agenda in the interim is no
way to govern, even as a party of
opposition, and Republicans are
still struggling to come to terms
with that reality.
Extending the debt ceiling for a
credible period would be a powerful
statement in itself in the eyes of
both the financial markets and the
American people, and certainly the
appropriate one.
That said, the GOP message

if not the tactics isn't without
merit. The long-run outlook for the
federal government's finances is
alarming, a reality driven largely
by unsustainable projected growth
in entitlement spending and debt
servicing. Reforming critical pro
grams like Social Security and
Medicare to ensure their future
credibility is a necessary step, and
one that would be far more signifi
cant than further slanting a tax sys
tem that is already more progres
sive than most other Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and De
velopment (OECD) countries.
To get to that point of progress,
however, President Barack Obama
needs to demonstrate a renewed
commitment to the nation's long
term prospects by following
through on a promise to engage in
serious discussions with Republi
cans pending resolution of the shut
down and debt ceiling crisis.
Obama has been consistently
unwilling to broach the subject of
long-term spending and tax reform
at least not in a nonpartisan and
balanced manner and scuppered
"grand bargain" negotiations in
2011 by caving to Democratic pres
sure at the 11th hour and stipulat
ing further revenue increases that
were far more than had been previ
ously agreed.
Obama's record to date, in other
words, isn't promising, and there
may be little reason to hope for
more from him in the weeks to
come. It may not be easy for GOP
representatives to bank on that
faint hope, but it's still the respon
sible — and the right thing to
do. The alternative simply doesn't
bear thinking about.
