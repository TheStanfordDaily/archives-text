## The
						Debt Ceiling Broken Down 
### Nick Ahamed 
Recent times have seen the
debt ceiling invoked ominous
ly far too much. In an press
conference on Oct. 8, President
Barack Obama noted some of the
"more polite words" economists are
using to talk about not raising the
debt ceiling: "insane," "catastroph
ic," "chaos."
Famed investor Warren Buffett
made more inflammatory remarks:
"It should be banned as a weapon. It
should be like nuclear bombs, basi
cally too horrible to use." Countless
others have echoed these senti
ments, but they shouldn't have to. It
just should not be this way.
Indeed, originally it wasn't. The
Congressional Research Service re
ports that for the first century of our
history, we had no debt ceiling.
Rather, Congress authorized specif
ic loans. But when World War I re
quired larger financing, the debt
ceiling was born. The Second Liber
ty Bond Act of 1917 authorized the
Treasury to issue bonds-debt- until it
reached a certain threshold -the debt
ceiling. Today, that threshold stands
at $16,699 trillion.
Ironically, it was intended to give
the Treasury more flexibility in man

aging our debt, not less.
But it was also used to play an im
portant role by forcing discussions
about the budget. However, the
Budget Control Act of 1974 made it
obsolete on that account by reform
ing the annual budget process and
creating a new forum for these dis
cussions.
Noting the new uselessness of the
debt ceiling in 1979, Dick Gephardt
instilled in the budget process his en
tirely pragmatic namesake rule,
which increased the debt ceiling
enough to fund the most recent
budget, making it a pure formality.
This rule stood until 1995, when
Newt Gingrich's overzealous Repub
licans saw political advantage in
turning it into a massive bargaining
chip. That reversion returned us to
brinkmanship politics, lurching from
crisis to crisis.
In our most recent battle, in 2011,
intense debate over spending result
ed in a last minute compromise: the
creation of a super committee on
deficit reduction and mandated
spending cuts, though no revenue
increases.
Yet that too was pointless; giving
no recommendation, the super com-

mittee concluded: "it will not be pos
sible to make any bipartisan agree
ment available to the public before
the committee's deadline."
With no comprehensive, biparti
san deficit reduction plan, ad hoc
proposals prevailed including the
sequester and we arrived at our
present situation. Technically, the
limit was hit on May 19, 2013. How
ever, the Treasury has a set of ac
counting gymnastics called ex
traordinary measures it can per
form to produce the needed cash.
As of Oct. 17, Treasury Secre
tary Jack Lew laments those meas
ures will no longer be enough. The
government will fall off the prover
bial balance beam.
Time and time again, we've un
necessarily manufactured these
crises. And while the debt ceiling is
a completely artificial limit, the con
sequences are anything but.
2011's merely near-default was
so frightening to investors that the
rating agency Standard and Poor's
downgraded our perfect credit rat
ing from AAA to AA+. Despite cur
rent Republican claims that a de
fault would not be so bad, the Bipar
tisan Policy Center estimates that
the 2011 downgrade will cost tax
payers an additional $18.9 billion
over 10 years. Third Way, a think
tank, calculated that 200,000 lost
jobs can be attributed to the 2011
crisis.
This current round could be even
more detrimental. That's why our
first step must be to raise the debt
ceiling. Any discussions about the
shutdown or other policy matters
should not be held at gunpoint, as I
argued last week. Neither President
Obama nor Speaker John Boehner
want America's first default in their
respective legacies, so let's stop
playing politics.
However, we can't just raise the
debt ceiling; our current path of cri
sis negotiations is unsustainable.
The current Republican proposal
only raises the debt ceiling until
Nov. 22. In six weeks, we could again
be having this same discussion
again, unnecessarily.
The absurdity of the debt ceiling
is astounding. Imagine going to a
restaurant and deciding what to or
der. That's the budget process in the
United States. Now imagine getting
the check and haggling with the
waiter over if you're going to pay the
bill. That's the debt ceiling debate.
Perhaps there is a reason that no
other country in the world has a
(non)functional debt ceiling. Per
haps our second step is to abolish it.
