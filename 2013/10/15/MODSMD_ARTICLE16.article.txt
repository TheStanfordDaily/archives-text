# FALLING IN PLACE
## CARDINAL TAKES FOURTH AT UCI 
### LUKE ASPERGER 
The men's water polo
team traveled to Southern
California this weekend to
test itself in the highly com
petitive UC-Irvine Invita
tional a tournament that
featured all of the top-10
teams in the current Colle
giate Water Polo Association
rankings. The No. 4 Cardinal
asserted its dominance on
Saturday with wins over No.
14 UC-Davis and No. 5 Cali
fornia before falling to No. 1
UCLA and No. 3 Pacific on
Sunday.

Stanford (10-4) rolled into
Saturday's opening matches
fresh off of a convincing 20-5
victory against No. 15 Santa
Clara the previous week. The
Card offense cruised through
the first game against UC-
Davis (7-8), downing the Ag
gies 18-7 with a balanced of

fensive attack during which
eight different Cardinal play
ers scored.
Stanford jumped off to a
6-1 lead in the first period
and never looked back, run
ning the score up to 10-3 by
the end of the half and 17-4
by the end of the third peri
od. The Cardinal offense was
led by four goals from fresh
man Jackson Kimbell and
paced by hat tricks from jun
ior Alex Bowen, sophomore
Griffin Bolan and freshman
Connor Stapleton. Sopho
more Adam Abdulhamid
scored twice and sophomores
Bret Bonanni and B.J. Churn
side and freshman Reid
Chase each added a goal
apiece.
In its second match of the
day, Stanford took down Cal
with a decisive 14-8 win.
Fifth-year senior Forrest
Watkins got the Card on the
scoreboard during the first
minute of play. After the
Golden Bears responded with
a goal of their own, Stanford
took off on a 4-0 run and fin
ished the half ahead 6-2.

California hung within
striking distance in the third
quarter, matching the Cardi
nal offense goal for goal, but

fourth-quarter goals by
Churnside and Bonanni
who each scored four goals in
the match put the game
out of reach for good. Senior
Conner Cleary scored three
goals for Stanford, while Bo
nanni, Churnside and Chase
each racked up a goal as well.
After cruising through
Saturday's matches, Stanford
couldn't handle the strong de
fense of an undefeated UCLA
lineup in the semifinals Sun
day morning, falling 10-5 to
the Bruins. After UCLA
jumped ahead to an early 2-0
lead, Stapleton was able to
get the Cardinal on the board
with 1:45 left in the first peri
od to cut the deficit in half.
It would take another 19
minutes of play, however, for
Stanford to score again. By
then, it was too late to over
come UCLA's lead, even
though the Cardinal matched
the Bruins goal for goal in the
fourth quarter. The Bruins
(18-1) later fell to No. 2 USC
in the tournament finals.
In the afternoon, Stanford
battled No. 3 Pacific for third
place in the tournament, but
couldn't maintain an early
lead as the Card fell in an 11-
10 defeat. Stanford jumped
ahead in the first quarter 3-0
with two goals from Bowen
and one from Bonanni, but
Pacific bounced right back,
tying the game 3-3 in the sec
ond period. The Cardinal re
sponded, pulling ahead with
goals from Bonanni and
Cleary, but by time the half
ended, the Tigers had once
again evened the score at 5-5.
The two teams battled
back and fourth throughout
the third period and into the
fourth, leaving the score even
at 9-9 with four minutes of
play left. Pacific pulled away
with two goals, putting the
Tigers ahead 11-9 with 35
seconds left on the clock. The
Card managed to respond
with one goal from Bonanni
10 seconds later, but Pacific
was able to capture the win,
holding Stanford off from a
tying goal.
Despite the Sunday loss
es, freshman goalie Drew
Holland looked strong over
the weekend, posting a total
of 23 saves over the four
games.
Stanford will get another
chance to take down No. 1
UCLA when the two teams
face off again this Saturday
at 10 a.m. at the Avery
Aquatic Center.

couldn't handle the strong de
fense of an undefeated UCLA
lineup in the semifinals Sun
day morning, falling 10-5 to
the Bruins. After UCLA
jumped ahead to an early 2-0
lead, Stapleton was able to
get the Cardinal on the board
with 1:45 left in the first peri
od to cut the deficit in half.
It would take another 19
minutes of play, however, for
Stanford to score again. By
then, it was too late to over
come UCLA's lead, even
though the Cardinal matched
the Bruins goal for goal in the
fourth quarter. The Bruins
(18-1) later fell to No. 2 USC
in the tournament finals.
In the afternoon, Stanford
battled No. 3 Pacific for third
place in the tournament, but
couldn't maintain an early
lead as the Card fell in an 11-
10 defeat. Stanford jumped
ahead in the first quarter 3-0
with two goals from Bowen
and one from Bonanni, but
Pacific bounced right back,
tying the game 3-3 in the sec
ond period. The Cardinal re
sponded, pulling ahead with
goals from Bonanni and
Cleary, but by time the half
ended, the Tigers had once
again evened the score at 5-5.
The two teams battled
back and fourth throughout
the third period and into the
fourth, leaving the score even
at 9-9 with four minutes of
play left. Pacific pulled away
with two goals, putting the
Tigers ahead 11-9 with 35
seconds left on the clock. The
Card managed to respond
with one goal from Bonanni
10 seconds later, but Pacific
was able to capture the win,
holding Stanford off from a
tying goal.
Despite the Sunday loss
es, freshman goalie Drew
Holland looked strong over
the weekend, posting a total
of 23 saves over the four
games.
Stanford will get another
chance to take down No. 1
UCLA when the two teams
face off again this Saturday
at 10 a.m. at the Avery
Aquatic Center.

fourth place, losing to No. 1 UCLA and No. 3 Pacific.

team traveled to Southern
California this weekend to
test itself in the highly com
petitive UC-Irvine Invita
tional a tournament that
featured all of the top-10
teams in the current Colle
giate Water Polo Association
rankings. The No. 4 Cardinal
asserted its dominance on
Saturday with wins over No.
14 UC-Davis and No. 5 Cali
fornia before falling to No. 1
UCLA and No. 3 Pacific on
Sunday.

Stanford (10-4) rolled into
Saturday's opening matches
fresh off of a convincing 20-5
victory against No. 15 Santa
Clara the previous week. The
Card offense cruised through
the first game against UC-
Davis (7-8), downing the Ag
gies 18-7 with a balanced of

fensive attack during which
eight different Cardinal play
ers scored.
Stanford jumped off to a
6-1 lead in the first period
and never looked back, run
ning the score up to 10-3 by
the end of the half and 17-4
by the end of the third peri
od. The Cardinal offense was
led by four goals from fresh
man Jackson Kimbell and
paced by hat tricks from jun
ior Alex Bowen, sophomore
Griffin Bolan and freshman
Connor Stapleton. Sopho
more Adam Abdulhamid
scored twice and sophomores
Bret Bonanni and B.J. Churn
side and freshman Reid
Chase each added a goal
apiece.
In its second match of the
day, Stanford took down Cal
with a decisive 14-8 win.
Fifth-year senior Forrest
Watkins got the Card on the
scoreboard during the first
minute of play. After the
Golden Bears responded with
a goal of their own, Stanford
took off on a 4-0 run and fin
ished the half ahead 6-2.

California hung within
striking distance in the third
quarter, matching the Cardi
nal offense goal for goal, but

fourth-quarter goals by
Churnside and Bonanni
who each scored four goals in
the match put the game
out of reach for good. Senior
Conner Cleary scored three
goals for Stanford, while Bo
nanni, Churnside and Chase
each racked up a goal as well.
