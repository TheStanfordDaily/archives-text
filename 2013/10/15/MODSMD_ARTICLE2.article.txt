### LAN ANH LE 
While Stanford has often of
fered students an inside look at Sil
icon Valley entrepreneurship cul
ture, the Association of Chinese
Students and Scholars at Stanford
(ACSSS) brought China's Internet
giant, Alibaba Group, on campus
through a technological forum this
weekend.
The forum attracted more than
250 attendees, including Stanford
students and affiliates as well as
Silicon Valley and Bay Area-based
engineers who have interests in e
commerce and technology in China.
Chief Technology Officer Wang
Jian and Executive Vice Chairman
Joe Tsai of the Alibaba Group
shared an inside look into the inner
workings of the company as well as
insights on the overall growth of
the global e-commerce market in
China.
"Stanford is the center of inno
vation and technological develop
ment, and that is what Alibaba [has
been] doing for a lot of time," said
James Jian Li, Ph.D. 'l7, vice-pres
ident of ACSSS's department of ca
reer development.
Founded by Jack Ma, a former
English teacher from Hangzhou,
China, Alibaba Group consists of a
family of Internet-based business
es that strives to streamline online
business and make it easier to buy
and sell products online worldwide.
Ma's mission was not only to
make the Internet trustworthy and
accessible for everyone but also to
help small companies who typically
face many challenges in doing busi
ness.
"[Ma] wanted to create an Inter
net platform, as to make informa
tion more transparent and help the
'small guy,"' Tsai said at the forum.
"He was involved in the import-ex
port trade business before starting
Alibaba, and he saw that small com
panies didn't have lots of resources
and could not easily compete with
the big guys."
Since its foundation, Alibaba has
developed leading technologies
and businesses in consumer-based
e-commerce, business-to-business
markets, online payment and cloud
computing. Reaching Internet users
from more than 240 countries and
regions, Alibaba still adheres to its
initial mission statement, which is to
make doing business easier and help
out small businesses.
Tsai explained that while Ama
zon is single-mindedly focused on
consumers and making consumer
experience great, Alibaba also
makes sure that merchants are
happy to sell on their platform
