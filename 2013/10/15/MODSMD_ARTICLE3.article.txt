# Graduate space program thrives
## Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics among the nation's best 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC 
Despite the government shutdown and its
effects on National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration, students such as Sean Copeland
M.S. 'lO, Ph.D. 'l5 in Stanford's Department of
Aeronautics & Astronautics remain hopeful for
a career in the field.
"I'm not worried about finding a job,"
Copeland said. "But I am worried about finding
the solutions to the challenges facing our gen
eration."
Copeland said NASA's funding doesn't nec
essarily worry him either.
"NASA's budget is only about 0.5 percent of
the overall federal budget," he added, "and de

spite cuts in recent years, fundamental aero
nautics research within the agency has re
mained fairly steady."
Copeland is one of the 200 graduate stu
dents and dozens of undergraduate students in
the Aeronautics & Astronautics Department.
The Stanford program is one of the largest in
the nation and is run by 12 full-time faculty
members who guide eager students in pursuing
their passion.
"That's their dream; they'd look out the win
dow and see the moon and say I'm going to get
somewhere there," said Charbel Farhat, chair
man of the department. "That's the kind of stu
dents we're going to get."
Professor emeritus and former department

chair, George Springer has been with the pro
gram since 1983 and believes that the quality,
not quantity of the faculty, has supported the
program since its inception.
He added that the innovative work conduct
ed within the department attracts highly ambi
tious students and faculty.
"The program only changed in the sense
that new topics became more interesting, and
that's why the department is one of the top de
partments in the country," Springer said "We
don't get stuck on one topic because something
that was interesting 20 years ago is not on the
front burner now."
