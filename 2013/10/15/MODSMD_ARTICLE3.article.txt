# Graduate space program thrives
## Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics among the nation's best 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC 
Despite the government shutdown and its
effects on National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration, students such as Sean Copeland
M.S. 'lO, Ph.D. 'l5 in Stanford's Department of
Aeronautics & Astronautics remain hopeful for
a career in the field.
"I'm not worried about finding a job,"
Copeland said. "But I am worried about finding
the solutions to the challenges facing our gen
eration."
Copeland said NASA's funding doesn't nec
essarily worry him either.
"NASA's budget is only about 0.5 percent of
the overall federal budget," he added, "and de

spite cuts in recent years, fundamental aero
nautics research within the agency has re
mained fairly steady."
Copeland is one of the 200 graduate stu
dents and dozens of undergraduate students in
the Aeronautics & Astronautics Department.
The Stanford program is one of the largest in
the nation and is run by 12 full-time faculty
members who guide eager students in pursuing
their passion.
"That's their dream; they'd look out the win
dow and see the moon and say I'm going to get
somewhere there," said Charbel Farhat, chair
man of the department. "That's the kind of stu
dents we're going to get."
Professor emeritus and former department

chair, George Springer has been with the pro
gram since 1983 and believes that the quality,
not quantity of the faculty, has supported the
program since its inception.
He added that the innovative work conduct
ed within the department attracts highly ambi
tious students and faculty.
"The program only changed in the sense
that new topics became more interesting, and
that's why the department is one of the top de
partments in the country," Springer said "We
don't get stuck on one topic because something
that was interesting 20 years ago is not on the
front burner now."
Farhat cited Stanford's
department as the one that
put global positioning sys
tem (GPS) technology on
the map. He added that the
program has come a long
way since then.
"We are heading in two
different and complementa
ry directions," Farhat said.
Farhat explained that he
sees micro air vehicles and
deep space machines as the
next realm of aeronautics
and astronautics, both of
which are topics currently
being investigated by Stan
ford students and profes
sors.
While the department
enters new territory, so too
do the program's graduate
students who are headed to
wards a variety of fields.
Copeland said he plans to
finish the program this year
and is considering continu
ing as a research scientist or
going into government re
search.
"I think working as part

of a government lab is a
good mix of doing funda
mental research and doing
new things but also having
an opportunity to work on a
project that is real in the
sense that what you're
working on has an applica
tion," Copeland said.
But first, Copeland must
complete a variety of classes
in the department. As part
of the preparation for their
careers, students are re
quired to take courses in the
five basic areas of aeronau
tics and astronautics: fluids,
structures, guidance and
control, propulsion and ex
perimentation and design.
Farhat said the program
also encourages students to
work in the industry
through summer intern
ships during their time at
Stanford.
"We have NASA Ames
[Research Center] across
the street, the Lockheed
Martin research offices, Lo
ral Space I mean the
area is full of opportunities
for internships," Farhat
said.
This hands-on approach
also appears in students'
course work. Copeland said

that his favorite class at
Stanford was a three-course
series on aircraft design, of
which the last quarter fo
cused on creating and test
ing an autonomous aircraft.
"As a part of that class,

we had an opportunity to go
to the Edwards Air Force
Base in Southern California
which is sort of an impor
tant location for aerospace
research," Copeland said.
"We had an opportunity to

pursue a world record for
highest altitude of an un
manned aerial vehicle in
that class."
