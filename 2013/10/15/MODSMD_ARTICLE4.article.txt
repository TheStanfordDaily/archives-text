## Solar car places fourth in global challenge 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
Placing fourth overall, Stanford's handmade
solar racecar, Luminos, was the top American
finisher at the 2013 Bridgestone World Solar
Challenge.
Luminos raced nearly 2,000 miles across
the Australian outback over the course of five
days, competing against 39 teams from 23
countries. The Stanford team finished 10 km
behind the third place team, University of
Twente and Saxion in the Netherlands.
The race started from Darwin on Oct. 6 and
ended in Adelaide on Oct. 10. Logging over
6,000 miles on its odometer, Luminos crossed
the last 4,000 miles with zero component fail
ures.

"As a driver, I feel very glad that we had
the car we did," said Jason Trinidad 'l6.
"There were a lot of high winds and Luminos
was a very stable car. Other teams got pushed
around a lot by the wind."
Weighing in at 375 pounds, Luminos was
built to endure harsh weather conditions. Dur
ing most of the race, Luminos encountered up
to 60 mph crosswinds that forced several oth
er teams to pull over to the side road due to
mechanical failures.
"The trick was that the worse the weather
got, the better it would be for us, because we
were less likely to break down through the
wind and the rain," said lan Girard 'll M.S.
'll, mechanical team co-leader for the Stan
ford Solar Car Project.
Strategic pre-race planning played a large

role in the team's successful strategy this year.
The team members were able to foresee vari
ous potential obstacles through repeated test
ing that gave them a significant edge.
"We were able to run a lot of strategy mod
els before the race determining when to go fast
and when not to go fast," Girard said. "We do a
lot of pre-planning and logistics to minimize
the number of unexpected problems that we
are going to get, but you can't predict every
thing."
In the last day of the race, Luminos en
countered a heavy rainstorm that soaked the
entire car. Fortunately, the team had the fore
sight to design the electronic components to
be waterproof.
