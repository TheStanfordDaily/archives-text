## Wieman merges science and education 
### ELIZABETH DAVIS 
Nobel Laureate Carl Wieman
Ph.D. '77 is applying his passion for
science in a unique way: by re
searching how to teach students to
think like scientists and thereby
revolutionize science education.
Wieman recently became Stan
ford's only professor holding a joint
appointment at the Department of
Physics and the Graduate School of
Education.
"I'm not really here to change
how Stanford teaches," Wieman
said. "My peak interest is doing re
search on learning and research on
different ways to teach things and
carefully measure what people are
learning and measure that in a
deeper more thorough way."
Wieman discovered the impor
tance of hands-on learning starting

his freshman year at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology,
where he lived and breathed
physics.
"I got involved in research very
early on, and my MIT career was
largely spent trying to avoid taking
any classes and spending all my
time on research," Wieman said. "I
did realize how little use classes
were compared to what I was
learning in the lab and talking to
the research scientists."
In fact, Wieman became so ded
icated to physics research that he
decided to move out of his dorm
room entirely and into his lab.
"After a while, I had this labora
tory of my own, and I spent all my
time there, so it seemed kind of sil
ly to be paying for a dorm room,"
Wieman said.
Wieman later discovered his

passion for laser physics and
moved to Stanford to pursue his
Ph.D., where most of his learning
took place in the laboratory. He
then went on to become a professor
at the University of Colorado at
Boulder, where his research on the
Bose-Einstein condensate earned
him and two other physicists the
2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Nevertheless, it was clear from
the very beginning that under
graduate education was a focus for
Wieman.
He developed a website that us
es interactive simulations to teach
scientific concepts. This website
has more than 50 million users
each year and continues to help
students visualize and understand
what's going on in science at the
