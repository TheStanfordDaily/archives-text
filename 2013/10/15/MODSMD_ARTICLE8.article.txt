## Be wary of three-peat's challenges 
### Ashley Westhem 
On Saturday, I shared
some of my thoughts
on the Utah matchup
during the KZSU
pregame show. In
stead of focusing on the Utah game it
self, I pointed out its implications for
Stanford's performance in this
week's game against UCLA I over
looked Utah as being nothing more
than a prep game for the bigger chal
lenge that the Bruins would pose for
us the following week.
Well, obviously, I shouldn't have
done that. But to continue my prac
tice of overlooking things, I am going
to kick the Utah game under the rug
and turn my attention to UCLA —
plus it's just too painful to dwell on
the past and what can't be changed.
The main reason UCLA will be
such a challenge is due to the fact that
it is really hard to beat the same team
twice let alone three times —in
less than a year. And let's not forget
that this isn't just any team; it is a
very good team.
Last year, the Card was able to
handily take down the Bruins in
Pasadena 35-17 and then turn around
and beat them again a week later at
Stanford Stadium to claim the Pac-12
title. The game was a lot closer the
second time around 27-24 and
I'm not so convinced that Stanford
would have won without the home
field advantage.
This year the Cardinal is fortu
nate to have the game on the Farm
once again, and perhaps the Utah loss
will spark a fire under the Card and
motivate it to tear apart the Bruins.
Especially now that Stanford will en
ter the game with a worse ranking
than UCLA, the Cardinal has a lot to
prove as it enters the hardest part of
its schedule.
After the Card's loss to Utah and
UCLA's dismantling of Cal, UCLA
moved up two spots to No. 9 and
Stanford plummeted out of the top 10
to No. 13. In addition, Stanford is
playing a UCLA team that is out for
revenge. What team wants to lose
three in a row? Ask USC and I'm
sure they'll tell you that the third loss
was just as painful as the fourth to the
Card. It's clear that the Bruins are
going to be ready to play.
The Stanford women's basketball
team also knows how difficult it is to
turn around and beat a good team
twice, as shown by their series with
Cal last season.
The Battle of the Bay occurred
twice in a five-day span. Stanford
came out on top at Haas Pavilion, de
spite the score going back and forth
for the entirety of the game. Most
everyone, myself included, expected
Stanford to snap out of whatever
funk it was in at Berkeley and deci
sively beat Cal at Maples to leave no
doubt as to which school is the bas
ketball powerhouse.
But that didn't happen. So it was
then that Stanford lost its first Pac-12
