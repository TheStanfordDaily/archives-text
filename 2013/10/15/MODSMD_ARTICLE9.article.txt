# INSTANT REPLAY: THE SCREEN
## THE 						EVOLUTION OF THE "STANFORD FORMULA" 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Screens." To a football announcer calling
Stanford, no word is more übiquitous, and to a
Stanford fan, no word is more irritating. Stan
ford has seen nearly every kind of screen you can
imagine. Bubble screens, tunnel screens, flare
screens and slow screens short passes thrown
behind the line of scrimmage rather than down
field strikes. For a conference that prides itself
on its tactical diversity, it is entertaining to see
just how homogenous Stanford's opponents have
been for the last two years.
Recently, Arizona, Washington State, Oregon,
UCLA, San Jose State, Arizona State, Washing
ton and now Utah have all utilized approximate
ly the same strategy against the Cardinal. Over
time, the "Stanford formula" has evolved, culmi
nating in the end of Stanford's 13-game winning
streak this past Saturday against Utah. As a re
sult, the Cardinal faithful should expect to see
the same strategies again and again.
It was clear from Utah's very first drive that
the Utes were committed to the screen-option
game. Before I continue, let's make this clear:
What Stanford has been seeing isn't a gimmick,

nor is it new. In the spread
option, the offense spaces its
receivers to spread out the
defense and open up lanes for
the option run game. With
screen passes effectively be
ing runs, the spread option
allows the offense to run
from all over the field. Ironi
cally, the screen pass was ac
tually invented by Pop Warn
er at Stanford.
The beauty of this offense
is that if four receivers are
utilized in the passing game
to block four defensive play
ers and the defense keeps a
safety downfield to avoid big
plays (as displayed in the dia
gram), the offense has five of
fensive linemen against six
defenders in the tackle box.
If the two players in the
backfield can option off one
defender through deception,
the blocking is five on five,
meaning that there is nobody
left in the immediate vicinity
to tackle the runner. This
leads to a steady diet of 5- to
7-yard runs. To further the
defensive disadvantage, if the
lone safety drops to provide
run support, the offense has
an advantage on the perime
ter with the screen game.
Under Mike Bellotti, Chip
Kelly and now Mark Hel
frich, this version of the
spread option made Oregon
famous. In 2011, Oregon
shredded Stanford 53-30 with
a spread option attack, but
curiously enough, teams did
not catch on.
Appropriately, the anti-
Stanford strategy found its
genesis with the original ar
chitect of the spread option,
Arizona's Rich Rodriguez. In
October 2012, Rodriguez be
gan with a more traditional
offensive game plan. Howev
er, Stanford shut down the
Arizona run game, and under
relentless pressure from the
Stanford front seven, quar
terback Matt Scott took hits

that would have sent many
people to the hospital. In re
sponse, Rodriguez started
calling quick bubble screens
to the outside, and with Stan
ford's safeties focusing on the
run game, Stanford surren
dered a staggering 617 yards,
of which the vast majority
were through the air.
Stanford's defensive coor
dinator Derek Mason prom
ised changes after the Ari
zona debacle and six weeks
later, Mason's defense scored
a massive triumph against
Oregon, holding the vaunted
Ducks offense to 14 points.
By playing "quarters" cover
age (a cover 4), Stanford's
safeties had more support in
the passing game, giving
them more freedom to read
and react they could at
tack the run game and play
the pass simultaneously.
Quarters is not the only cov
erage Stanford uses, but
Stanford has used it exten
sively since the game against
Oregon. In the play dia
grammed, Stanford is in
what looks to be quarters.
Offenses evolve, as they
are wont to do, and in the
2012 Pac-12 Championship
Game, UCLA took Stanford
to the wire, stringing up sev
eral long drives and racking
up 461 yards. The Bruins' in
novation was motion: By
sending receivers in pre-snap
orbit motion (e.g. what Utah's
A is doing in the diagrammed
play), UCLA gained the abili
ty to shift players from side to
side, changing the mathemat
ics of the game as the ball was
being snapped. The motion
forced Stanford's safeties to
respect the swing pass in
stead of first reading and re
acting, effectively destroying
the quarters look. It's easy to
imagine Utah's coaches
watching this game with big
grins on then* faces.
Here against Utah, if jun
ior strong safety Jordan
Richards hadn't shifted to
cover the A, the Utes would
have had a three-on-two ad
vantage on the flare screen
that might have gone for a

touchdown. But Richards al
so took himself out of the run
game by doing so he had
effectively been blocked
without actually having been
blocked. Stanford was back
to square one.
With Richards out of the
play, Utah's quarterback and
running back optioned off a
defender and the running
back took the ball and ran
left. With a huge five-on-four
advantage in the tackle box,
Utah's offensive line had no
problem double-teaming
Stanford's defensive linemen
and sealing Stanford's line
backers away from the play.
In this case, Utah's right tack
le Siaosi Aiono had nobody in
front of him, hit the second
level of the defense immedi
ately and pushed Shayne
Skov out of the play, allowing
running back Bubba Poole to
cut back for a 21-yard gain.
Poole would go on to gash the
Cardinal for 111 yards on 22
carries, most of his yardage
coming on plays like this.
The Utah game was not
typical. Stanford's defensive
line was horrendously
banged up, and without the
protection that defensive
penetration affords, Utah's
offensive line had no problem
blocking Stanford's lineback
ers. Utah is also a good team
that would likely have beaten
No. 9 UCLA but for a spate
of fluky interceptions. But
the fact remained that Utah
ran all over Stanford, and it
was brutally clear that Stan
ford would have to adapt.
Mason changed his tactics as
the game went on, bringing
more pressure to bear on
Utah's backfield and playing
man coverage to free up the
safeties. With the game still
close, the Cardinal success
fully forced several three
and-outs that almost brought
the team back from the
brink. But these efforts were
not enough, and Stanford
was shocked in Salt Lake
City.

erage Stanford uses, but
Stanford has used it exten
sively since the game against
Oregon. In the play dia
grammed, Stanford is in
what looks to be quarters.
Offenses evolve, as they
are wont to do, and in the
2012 Pac-12 Championship
Game, UCLA took Stanford
to the wire, stringing up sev
eral long drives and racking
up 461 yards. The Bruins' in
novation was motion: By
sending receivers in pre-snap
orbit motion (e.g. what Utah's
A is doing in the diagrammed
play), UCLA gained the abili
ty to shift players from side to
side, changing the mathemat
ics of the game as the ball was
being snapped. The motion
forced Stanford's safeties to
respect the swing pass in
stead of first reading and re
acting, effectively destroying
the quarters look. It's easy to
imagine Utah's coaches
watching this game with big
grins on then* faces.
Here against Utah, if jun
ior strong safety Jordan
Richards hadn't shifted to
cover the A, the Utes would
have had a three-on-two ad
vantage on the flare screen
that might have gone for a

touchdown. But Richards al
so took himself out of the run
game by doing so he had
effectively been blocked
without actually having been
blocked. Stanford was back
to square one.
With Richards out of the
play, Utah's quarterback and
running back optioned off a
defender and the running
back took the ball and ran
left. With a huge five-on-four
advantage in the tackle box,
Utah's offensive line had no
problem double-teaming
Stanford's defensive linemen
and sealing Stanford's line
backers away from the play.
In this case, Utah's right tack
le Siaosi Aiono had nobody in
front of him, hit the second
level of the defense immedi
ately and pushed Shayne
Skov out of the play, allowing
running back Bubba Poole to
cut back for a 21-yard gain.
Poole would go on to gash the
Cardinal for 111 yards on 22
carries, most of his yardage
coming on plays like this.
The Utah game was not
typical. Stanford's defensive
line was horrendously
banged up, and without the
protection that defensive
penetration affords, Utah's
offensive line had no problem
blocking Stanford's lineback
ers. Utah is also a good team
that would likely have beaten
No. 9 UCLA but for a spate
of fluky interceptions. But
the fact remained that Utah
ran all over Stanford, and it
was brutally clear that Stan
ford would have to adapt.
Mason changed his tactics as
the game went on, bringing
more pressure to bear on
Utah's backfield and playing
man coverage to free up the
safeties. With the game still
close, the Cardinal success
fully forced several three
and-outs that almost brought
the team back from the
brink. But these efforts were
not enough, and Stanford
was shocked in Salt Lake
City.

"Screens." To a football announcer calling
Stanford, no word is more übiquitous, and to a
Stanford fan, no word is more irritating. Stan
ford has seen nearly every kind of screen you can
imagine. Bubble screens, tunnel screens, flare
screens and slow screens short passes thrown
behind the line of scrimmage rather than down
field strikes. For a conference that prides itself
on its tactical diversity, it is entertaining to see
just how homogenous Stanford's opponents have
been for the last two years.
Recently, Arizona, Washington State, Oregon,
UCLA, San Jose State, Arizona State, Washing
ton and now Utah have all utilized approximate
ly the same strategy against the Cardinal. Over
time, the "Stanford formula" has evolved, culmi
nating in the end of Stanford's 13-game winning
streak this past Saturday against Utah. As a re
sult, the Cardinal faithful should expect to see
the same strategies again and again.
It was clear from Utah's very first drive that
the Utes were committed to the screen-option
game. Before I continue, let's make this clear:
What Stanford has been seeing isn't a gimmick,


IRENE HSU/The Stanford Daily
nor is it new. In the spread
option, the offense spaces its
receivers to spread out the
defense and open up lanes for
the option run game. With
screen passes effectively be
ing runs, the spread option
allows the offense to run
from all over the field. Ironi
cally, the screen pass was ac
tually invented by Pop Warn
er at Stanford.
The beauty of this offense
is that if four receivers are
utilized in the passing game
to block four defensive play
ers and the defense keeps a
safety downfield to avoid big
plays (as displayed in the dia
gram), the offense has five of
fensive linemen against six
defenders in the tackle box.
If the two players in the
backfield can option off one
defender through deception,
the blocking is five on five,
meaning that there is nobody
left in the immediate vicinity
to tackle the runner. This
leads to a steady diet of 5- to
7-yard runs. To further the
defensive disadvantage, if the
lone safety drops to provide
run support, the offense has
an advantage on the perime
ter with the screen game.
Under Mike Bellotti, Chip
Kelly and now Mark Hel
frich, this version of the
spread option made Oregon
famous. In 2011, Oregon
shredded Stanford 53-30 with
a spread option attack, but
curiously enough, teams did
not catch on.
Appropriately, the anti-
Stanford strategy found its
genesis with the original ar
chitect of the spread option,
Arizona's Rich Rodriguez. In
October 2012, Rodriguez be
gan with a more traditional
offensive game plan. Howev
er, Stanford shut down the
Arizona run game, and under
relentless pressure from the
Stanford front seven, quar
terback Matt Scott took hits

that would have sent many
people to the hospital. In re
sponse, Rodriguez started
calling quick bubble screens
to the outside, and with Stan
ford's safeties focusing on the
run game, Stanford surren
dered a staggering 617 yards,
of which the vast majority
were through the air.
Stanford's defensive coor
dinator Derek Mason prom
ised changes after the Ari
zona debacle and six weeks
later, Mason's defense scored
a massive triumph against
Oregon, holding the vaunted
Ducks offense to 14 points.
By playing "quarters" cover
age (a cover 4), Stanford's
safeties had more support in
the passing game, giving
them more freedom to read
and react they could at
tack the run game and play
the pass simultaneously.
