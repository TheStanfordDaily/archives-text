## TIGHT END SHIFTS TO DEFENSE INJURIES TO LINE MOVE KAUMATULE 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
Despite its tough loss at Utah last
Saturday, the Stanford Cardinal football
team and head coach David Shaw contin

Shaw emphasized that he has played
very well at the position, particularly in
downfield blocking. Ultimately it was the
injuries on the defensive line and not lack

However, Shaw did not rule out the
possibility that Kaumatule would one
