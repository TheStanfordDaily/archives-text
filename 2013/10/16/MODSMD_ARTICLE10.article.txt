## TIGHT END SHIFTS TO DEFENSE INJURIES TO LINE MOVE KAUMATULE 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
Despite its tough loss at Utah last
Saturday, the Stanford Cardinal football
team and head coach David Shaw contin
ue to maintain their calm, business-like
demeanor with an overall surprisingly
upbeat attitude towards the crucial con
ference showdowns remaining on the
schedule.
Nevertheless, while the overall tone
of Tuesday's press conference remained
unchanged from those of previous weeks,
Shaw did announce that the Cardinal's
depth chart would receive a major shuf
fle.
With senior defensive end Henry An
derson out with a leg injury until at least
the Oregon game on Nov. 7 and fifth
year senior defensive end Ben Gardner
dealing with an arm contusion, Shaw an
nounced Tuesday that sophomore tight
end Luke Kaumatule would be moving
back to defensive end, the position he
was originally recruited to play, to allevi
ate the shaky depth at the position.
"With Henry being down, our guys
are playing a lot," Shaw said. "We need
ed a spark, and that's Luke."
While the 6-foot-7, 276-pound sopho
more from Honolulu has not taken a snap
on defense this season, he certainly
showed off his tremendous power and ex
plosiveness in the trenches when he was
part of the contingent that blocked a punt
against Arizona State, a play that result
ed in a safety against the Sun Devils.
Coming into this season, Kaumatule
was expected to be the new flag-bearer
of 'Tight End U," a lineage that includes
several current NFL players such as Co
by Fleener 'll, Zach Ertz 'l3 and Levine
Toilolo 'l3. Despite the fact that Kaumat
ule lacked the same presence in the Car
dinal passing game as his predecessors,
Shaw emphasized that he has played
very well at the position, particularly in
downfield blocking. Ultimately it was the
injuries on the defensive line and not lack
of play that prompted the change.
However, Shaw did not rule out the
possibility that Kaumatule would one
day return to the offensive side of the
ball, perhaps even this season. In typical,
cryptic Shaw fashion, he declared
that the move would be permanent
"for this week." Through two prac
tices, Kaumatule's presence is be
ing felt, though he is certainly not
polished just yet.
"[Kaumatule] has no idea what
he's doing, but he's running around
full speed," Shaw said. "He
brought us some energy and life on
the defensive side. Now we just
need to get him pointed in the right
direction."
Although much of Tuesday's
presser was devoted to Kaumat
ule's move, Shaw also discussed his
methodology for dealing with a
tough loss and the growth of junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan, who
had just taken his first loss as Stan
ford's starter.
When addressing the team af
ter the loss in Salt Lake City, Shaw
had encouraged his players to be

come introspective.
"The first word I used [after the
loss] was perspective," Shaw said.
"Let's look at where we are. Let's
look at how we got here. Let's look
at where we're going. That's the
most important thing for me. In or
der to go forward, you have to
know where you are."
Regarding Hogan, Shaw con
ceded that this quarterback was in
a bit of slump for most of the Utah
game, but on the final drive ap
peared to rediscover that "spark"
that made him so dangerous last
season.
"Kevin has not played great in

the last couple of weeks, but in each
game he's made some great plays,"
Shaw said. "The throws that he
made to get us down there [were]
outstanding. The big-time throw on
the corner route to [sophomore
wide receiver] Kodi Whitfield...
that's an NFL throw."
Ultimately, Shaw hopes that
Hogan, as well as the entire squad,
can use the positive energy on that
final Stanford drive to get ready
for a critical showdown Saturday at
Stanford Stadium against UCLA.

of Tuesday's press conference remained
unchanged from those of previous weeks,
Shaw did announce that the Cardinal's
depth chart would receive a major shuf
fle.
With senior defensive end Henry An
derson out with a leg injury until at least
the Oregon game on Nov. 7 and fifth
year senior defensive end Ben Gardner
dealing with an arm contusion, Shaw an
nounced Tuesday that sophomore tight
end Luke Kaumatule would be moving
back to defensive end, the position he
was originally recruited to play, to allevi
ate the shaky depth at the position.
"With Henry being down, our guys
are playing a lot," Shaw said. "We need
ed a spark, and that's Luke."
While the 6-foot-7, 276-pound sopho
more from Honolulu has not taken a snap
on defense this season, he certainly
showed off his tremendous power and ex
plosiveness in the trenches when he was
part of the contingent that blocked a punt
against Arizona State, a play that result
ed in a safety against the Sun Devils.
Coming into this season, Kaumatule
was expected to be the new flag-bearer
of 'Tight End U," a lineage that includes
several current NFL players such as Co
by Fleener 'll, Zach Ertz 'l3 and Levine
Toilolo 'l3. Despite the fact that Kaumat
ule lacked the same presence in the Car
dinal passing game as his predecessors,
Shaw emphasized that he has played
very well at the position, particularly in
downfield blocking. Ultimately it was the
injuries on the defensive line and not lack
of play that prompted the change.
However, Shaw did not rule out the
possibility that Kaumatule would one
day return to the offensive side of the
ball, perhaps even this season. In typical,
cryptic Shaw fashion, he declared
that the move would be permanent
"for this week." Through two prac
tices, Kaumatule's presence is be
ing felt, though he is certainly not
polished just yet.
"[Kaumatule] has no idea what
he's doing, but he's running around
full speed," Shaw said. "He
brought us some energy and life on
the defensive side. Now we just
need to get him pointed in the right
direction."
Although much of Tuesday's
presser was devoted to Kaumat
ule's move, Shaw also discussed his
methodology for dealing with a
tough loss and the growth of junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan, who
had just taken his first loss as Stan
ford's starter.
When addressing the team af
ter the loss in Salt Lake City, Shaw
had encouraged his players to be

come introspective.
"The first word I used [after the
loss] was perspective," Shaw said.
"Let's look at where we are. Let's
look at how we got here. Let's look
at where we're going. That's the
most important thing for me. In or
der to go forward, you have to
know where you are."
Regarding Hogan, Shaw con
ceded that this quarterback was in
a bit of slump for most of the Utah
game, but on the final drive ap
peared to rediscover that "spark"
that made him so dangerous last
season.
"Kevin has not played great in

the last couple of weeks, but in each
game he's made some great plays,"
Shaw said. "The throws that he
made to get us down there [were]
outstanding. The big-time throw on
the corner route to [sophomore
wide receiver] Kodi Whitfield...
that's an NFL throw."
Ultimately, Shaw hopes that
Hogan, as well as the entire squad,
can use the positive energy on that
final Stanford drive to get ready
for a critical showdown Saturday at
Stanford Stadium against UCLA.
