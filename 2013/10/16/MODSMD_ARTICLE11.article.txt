# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE: CHAMPIONSHIP CARDINAL?
## 
### THE DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Stanford's loss to Utah on Sat
urday all but ended its chances
for a national title this season.
As it often does, the Cardinal
struggled to pull away from' an
underdog; the difference this
time was that the Ut.es took ad
vantage. On one hand, head
coach David Shaw has often
defended his team's conserva
tive play calling and penchant
for cutting it close. On the oth
er hand, Stanford's inability to
blow out opponents has left it
exposed to losses like Satur
day's, and in college football,
teams are expected to be per
fect for 11> i veeks if they hope to
compete for the crystal trophy.
That's why we asked football

writers Winston Shi, David
Cohn and Do-Hyoung Park: Is
this Stanford team just not
built to win a national cham
pionship?
Winston Shi: I agree with the
premise, as I've mentioned it be
fore in a previous column. Teams
vary from week to week, but re
gardless, I don't think Stanford is a
national championship team.
David Shaw slows the game
down on offense as a benefit to the
defense, but in doing so, he also al
lows low-probability events to have
more of an effect on a game
what financiers call "black swans."
If Stanford is truly the better team,
it needs more opportunities to re
duce the effect of randomness.
Slowing the game down takes away
time, and time is to an offense as

oxygen is to a flame.
More ironically, Stanford em
phasizes the run in order to avoid
randomness, to get the consistent
4- to 5-yard gain instead of the spo
radic 10- to 12-yard gain. Kevin
Hogan played pretty well, but he
needs to learn the offense better so
that Stanford doesn't have to eat up
clock sending in play calls. That will
allow the offense to begin playing
with speed if not throughout the
game, then at least during critical
moments.
Now, I love Stanford's throw
back power running, max-blocking
schemes and deep play action. It's
multiple, it's confusing to the de
fense and it will win games. But all
in all, Stanford isn't executing that
game plan on offense right now.
On defense, Stanford's philoso
phy is to wait for either a penalty, a

sack, a couple small mistakes or a
turnover but the level of offen
sive execution is getting better and
better. It's hard to overestimate
just how important getting to third
and-long and then relying on the
pass rush has been to Stanford. But
even when Utah threw the ball
around, they got third and shorts.
Opposing offenses aren't going to
make mistakes. Stanford is going to
have to force them to do so. If the
Cardinal doesn't have the horses or
the discipline in the secondary to
play some man coverage, it proba
bly doesn't deserve to win a nation
al championship.

late in the Utah game mixing in
more press coverage and exotic
blitzes but by then it was too

Stanford football players (above) celebrate after their Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin last season. Saturday's loss to Utah put the national
title-hopeful Cardinal's championship hopes in serious jeopardy, with big games against UCLA, Oregon State, Oregon and USC still to come.
