# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE: CHAMPIONSHIP CARDINAL?
## 
### THE DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Stanford's loss to Utah on Sat
urday all but ended its chances
for a national title this season.
As it often does, the Cardinal
struggled to pull away from' an
underdog; the difference this
time was that the Ut.es took ad
vantage. On one hand, head
coach David Shaw has often
defended his team's conserva
tive play calling and penchant
for cutting it close. On the oth
er hand, Stanford's inability to
blow out opponents has left it
exposed to losses like Satur
day's, and in college football,
teams are expected to be per
fect for 11> i veeks if they hope to
compete for the crystal trophy.
That's why we asked football

writers Winston Shi, David
Cohn and Do-Hyoung Park: Is
this Stanford team just not
built to win a national cham
pionship?
Winston Shi: I agree with the
premise, as I've mentioned it be
fore in a previous column. Teams
vary from week to week, but re
gardless, I don't think Stanford is a
national championship team.
David Shaw slows the game
down on offense as a benefit to the
defense, but in doing so, he also al
lows low-probability events to have
more of an effect on a game
what financiers call "black swans."
If Stanford is truly the better team,
it needs more opportunities to re
duce the effect of randomness.
Slowing the game down takes away
time, and time is to an offense as

oxygen is to a flame.
More ironically, Stanford em
phasizes the run in order to avoid
randomness, to get the consistent
4- to 5-yard gain instead of the spo
radic 10- to 12-yard gain. Kevin
Hogan played pretty well, but he
needs to learn the offense better so
that Stanford doesn't have to eat up
clock sending in play calls. That will
allow the offense to begin playing
with speed if not throughout the
game, then at least during critical
moments.
Now, I love Stanford's throw
back power running, max-blocking
schemes and deep play action. It's
multiple, it's confusing to the de
fense and it will win games. But all
in all, Stanford isn't executing that
game plan on offense right now.
On defense, Stanford's philoso
phy is to wait for either a penalty, a

sack, a couple small mistakes or a
turnover but the level of offen
sive execution is getting better and
better. It's hard to overestimate
just how important getting to third
and-long and then relying on the
pass rush has been to Stanford. But
even when Utah threw the ball
around, they got third and shorts.
Opposing offenses aren't going to
make mistakes. Stanford is going to
have to force them to do so. If the
Cardinal doesn't have the horses or
the discipline in the secondary to
play some man coverage, it proba
bly doesn't deserve to win a nation
al championship.

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Stanford football players (above) celebrate after their Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin last season. Saturday's loss to Utah put the national
title-hopeful Cardinal's championship hopes in serious jeopardy, with big games against UCLA, Oregon State, Oregon and USC still to come.
late. Stanford still controls
its Pac-12 destiny, but
UCLA's Brett Hundley is a
very talented passer who, if
Stanford doesn't sit him
down repeatedly, can march
the Bruins down the field
and crush Stanford's remain
ing Rose Bowl hopes.

David Cohn: Before I get in
to the heart of my response,
let me first discuss the previ
ous assertion that all teams
that are selected to play in
the National Championship
have to be perfect. That is
simply not true. In fact, in
previous years, Alabama
twice won the national cham
pionship after losing a regu
lar season home game.
In addition, LSU won a
national championship in
2007 after losing twice dur
ing the regular season, in
cluding a home loss while
ranked No. 1 in the nation to
an unranked Arkansas team
that finished the season 8-5.
To prove that this string of
imperfection is not limited to
SEC schools, Ohio State,
LSU's opponent in that 2007
BCS National Champi
onship, also lost at home
while holding the No. 1 rank
ing to a then-unranked Illi
nois squad.
In fact, it is becoming in
creasingly more difficult for
AQ-teams to make it through
their seasons unscathed, as
only two teams finished the
regular season last year
without a loss: Notre Dame
and an ineligible Ohio State
team. This phenomenon
means that it has been three
years since a national cham
pionship game last featured
two undefeated squads.
Ultimately, this now-fre
quently incorrect notion of

perfection is the reason why
we have to answer the ques
tion of whether Stanford is
built to a national champi
onship, since a majority of
the national pundits have al
ready written off the Card's
chances of winning this year.
No one knows how the
season is going to play out
for Stanford, nor any other
team for that matter. In par
ticular, I have heard this sen
timent several times already:
"Stanford can't make the na
tional championship game
because Ohio State (or Flori
da State or Clemson) is going
to go undefeated." The peo
ple who made these asser
tions may be right, and these
teams may not lose on their
way to possible national
championship berths. How
ever, by the same token, no
one saw West Virginia losing
to Pitt in December 2007,
Oklahoma State losing to
lowa State in November
2011 or even Oregon losing
to Stanford last November.
Therefore, I cannot judge
whether this Cardinal team
is or is not built to win a na
tional championship until the
season has run its course.
Do-Hyoung Park: The bot
tom line is: regardless of
what David Shaw says, style
points matter. The Coaches
poll is voted on by people
not named David Shaw. As
is the Harris poll. When the
pollsters will ultimately de
termine which team to rank
at No. 1 and No. 2 in De
cember, who will they put
ahead: a one-loss Oregon
(not to say that the Ducks
will lose) sporting a 45-point
win over Tennessee of the
SEC or a one-loss Stanford
(not to say that the Cardinal
will win out) with just a 14-
point win over... um ...
Army?
I do believe that this
Stanford team does have the
talent and the personnel to

bring home the crystal foot
ball. Despite the question
able secondary on the defen
sive side, the offense has re
ally come into its own. Kevin
Hogan is maturing and mak
ing better throws and deci
sions (admittedly, more work
is needed on the latter). Ty
Montgomery can change
games. Tyler Gaffney is a
workhorse. Kelsey Young
can do amazing things with
an open field. Devon Cajuste
has looked like Zach Ertz at
times.
Stanford's brand of foot
ball will win games. That's a
tried and true statement that
the last half-decade of Stan
ford football has shown. I'm
in no position to criticize
David Shaw. But in this day
and age, with lighting up
scoreboards being synony
mous with championship-cal
iber teams to many around
the nation (see: Baylor
hype), isn't it time to adapt to
the times? Why not push the
pedal to the metal and see
what happens?
While Stanford is certain
ly built like a BCS Champi
onship team the Cardi
nal's depth on both sides of
the ball is almost unparal
leled â€”it is still being
coached with a Rose Bowl
mindset. Things change
when you're a championship
caliber team and all eyes are
on you. And until Shaw can
make championship calls
up the tempo when needed,
lose the conservativeness,
use Kelsey Young(!) a
Rose Bowl team is all Stan
ford will be.
