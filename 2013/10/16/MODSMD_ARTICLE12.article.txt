## SEEING GREEN Tirelessly Telling the Truth 
### Holly Moeller 
I've been spending a lot of time
lately wondering what I'd like
to do with my life profession
ally, that is. It's hardly a unique
problem: I know plenty of people
graduating this year from universi
ty, defending their Ph.D.s or find
ing that it's time to move on from
their current job. As we fumble
through cover letters and grant ap
plications, it can be easy to forget
what's motivating us.

When I lose perspective, I
sometimes think back to a child
hood memory from the shores of
Monterey Bay. I was giddy over the
marine life my vacationing family
had spotted in the kelp beds and
tide pools along the coast. My mom
was giddy over what might have
been my first real interest in a sci
entific career.

"If you want to be a marine biol
ogist," she told me, "you have to go
to Woods Hole. That's where
Rachel Carson worked."
It's hard to underestimate the
influence that Rachel Carson had
on my family. My dad read her nat
ural history accounts of the sea
while he was growing up and al
most had a career in marine biology
because of them. And Carson's
fearless environmental and conser
vation reporting won over my
mom's heart.
But there's a reason that Rachel
Carson is a household name in
more than just our scientifically fix
ated one: Her work changed the en
tire world.
After decades of writing about
science for the public, Carson pub
lished "Silent Spring" in 1962. The
book exposed the dark underbelly of
the chemical pesticides that had be
come wildly popular after World War
11. Though obviously immediately
effective at, for example, killing off
disease-spreading mosquitoes and
crop-devouring locusts, pesticides
have some major problems.
First, they aren't a long-term
fix: Insects (and other things we
like to fight with chemicals, like
bacteria) can evolve resistance, so
that over time, the pesticides stop
working. Second, pesticides can do
tremendous environmental dam
age: They're rarely specific in their
toxic effects, so they can pose poi
sonous danger to other animals, in
cluding humans.
For example, DDT, highlighted
by Carson in "Silent Spring," works
its way up the food chain, accumu
lating in the fatty tissues of long
lived top predators, like the osprey
and eagles whose populations were
decimated by DDT-induced nest
failure, and even us humans.
"Silent Spring" sparked an up
roar. The book was published at a
time when America's confidence in
its scientific prowess was high. Af
ter all, science in the form of an
atom bomb won the war for us in
Japan. Tremendous government in
vestments in other technologies

were pushing industry forward.
And a woman with a 300-page book
had just thrown a wrench into the
works.

It must have been a scary thing
to do. And given the amount of
preparation Carson and her pub
lishing team did before the book's
release, she knew what was com
ing. The endless interview re
quests. Testifying before Congress.
Personal attacks calling her a bad
scientist, and even a Communist
(quite the loaded term in those
Cold War days).

And she did it all while she was
fighting terminal breast cancer,
which would ultimately claim her
life fewer than two years later.
Rachel Carson died at age 56, be
fore she could see many of the last
ing effects of her work come to
fruition, like the nationwide ban of
DDT, the passage of the Clean Air
Act and the founding of the Envi
ronmental Protection Agency.
Last July, more than fifty years
after "Silent Spring," I stood by the
sea in Woods Hole, Mass., as the
town dedicated a statue of Rachel
Carson, looking out over the water
as she must have so often during
her time there.

The Reverend Deborah Warner
gave a closing blessing, calling on
the scientists there to "rededicate
ourselves to the service of steward
ship to this burdened, yet bountiful
beckoning blue planet" and thank
ing Rachel Carson, for always "tire
lessly telling the truth."
When I think about my career,
my writing, my life from political
debates with friends to deliberating
over organic vegetables and fair
trade chocolate to struggling over
scientific publications and giant
writing I think about those mo
ments by the sea. I think about
Reverend Warner's words and my
mother's. I think about Rachel Car
son and doing the right thing. I
think about the beauty of the scien
tific method, my own call to honor it
and the value of tirelessly telling
the truth.

Rachel Carson's
work changed
the entire world.
