# Working Harder Doesn't Pay Better
## 
### Chi Ling Chan 
For as long as I can remember,
my mother has been working
as an office secretary, a 9-to-5
job that isn't the most exciting in the
world. But it was a livelihood that,
though not well paying, sustained
the family.
Over the years, I have noticed
two things: her pay has hardly risen
and, in fact, decreased in real
terms and her working hours
have become longer. This is in spite
of the fact that her productivity has
increased significantly: Whereas 20
years ago she would tabulate sums
manually with a calculator, she now
uses Excel to accomplish the same
tasks at a much faster pace.
Where did all that working
smarter, working better (which
economists call "productivity
gains") go to? It certainly wasn't re
flected in her paycheck, nor had it
led to shorter working hours.
Across the world, as far as data sug
gests, majority of workers are
working harder and becoming more
productive, but they are earning
less in terms of real income.
This should be puzzling to us. In
1930, Keynes had predicted that by
the century's end technology would
have advanced sufficiently that de
veloped countries like the United
States and Great Britain would
have achieved a 15-hour work week.
While it is true that technology has
led to massive gains in overall pro

ductivity, a three to four hour work
day simply hasn't materialized.
If anything, people are working
harder and being paid less (relative
to their output): In the United
States, for example, worker produc
tivity has increased by 254 percent
from 1948 to 2011, but hourly com
pensation has seen only seen a 113
percent increase, which is less than
half of what it should be if pay fol
lows productivity. Workers are con
stantly told to increase their produc
tivity through obtaining new skills,
but, as we can see, it just doesn't re
ally pay off for the workers them
selves.
At the same time, governments
are investing heavily in technologi
cal innovation, seeing it as the key to
increasing productivity, lowering
costs of production and fostering
greater competitiveness. While new
technology is often readily adopted,
the social costs that come with such
changes are virtually never dis
cussed.
It seems as if everybody has held
a quasi-religious faith in the auto
matic beneficence of technological
progress, assuming that greater in
vestments in technology naturally
brings about economic growth, jobs

and shorter working hours.
But it hasn't. Laborsaving tech
nologies have not been used to save
workers' labor but rather to accrue
greater profits for the top echelons.
Productivity gains have gone to
those with power, at the expense of
those without it.
To the extent that there have
been tangible benefits from automa
tion, they have gone in only one di
rection: up. Today, labor's share of
income is declining, contributing to
greater inequality and CEO and
managers sitting on fat bonuses and
paychecks. The Occupy Movements
shed some light on these inequali
ties, but little has changed after its
fizzling out.
So what have we got with all that
technological progress? Instead of
being relieved of effort, workers
have been relieved of their liveli
hood. As I have written in a previous
column, technology is putting people
out of work faster than ever. Theo
retically, that might be a good thing
because people are now relieved
from mindless, menial jobs that sap
the human soul. But in practice, un
employment in capitalist societies
that provide little welfare provisions
means a very hard life, not self-actu
alization.
Unless, of course, you are living
in Switzerland, a country that is go
ing through a referendum to give
every adult a basic income of 2500
francs (USDS2BOO) regardless of
employment status.
Such proposals would probably
be met with suspicion even in the
most liberal quarters of United
States: "Work" and "ethics" have
such a strong link in people's heads
that paying someone for not working
is simply unacceptable, and well, "so
cialist." In the United States, that la
bel is apparently a sufficient reason
to kill a proposal regardless of its
merits.
"Radical" proposals aside, it is
probably time to take a break from
singing paeans to technological
progress to take stock of unexam
ined assumptions. We have blithely
assumed that once we get the com
petition going in a capitalist system,
it will promote technological
progress and things will take care of
themselves, when really this is an ill
defined faith that is rarely articulat
ed with logical rigor and clarity.
When we examine these assump
tions closely, we see that the causal
chain is ambiguous at every link:
Adoption of new technology does
not necessarily lead to increases in
productivity, and productivity gains
might not translate into better wel
fare and standard of living for all.
Some will win and many will lose
there is nothing automatic about
the magic loop between technology
and welfare. They merely follow
from the social choices made by
those who have had the power to de
cide who gets what.

and, in fact, decreased in real
terms and her working hours
have become longer. This is in spite
of the fact that her productivity has
increased significantly: Whereas 20
years ago she would tabulate sums
manually with a calculator, she now
uses Excel to accomplish the same
tasks at a much faster pace.
Where did all that working
smarter, working better (which
economists call "productivity
gains") go to? It certainly wasn't re
flected in her paycheck, nor had it
led to shorter working hours.
Across the world, as far as data sug
gests, majority of workers are
working harder and becoming more
productive, but they are earning
less in terms of real income.
This should be puzzling to us. In
1930, Keynes had predicted that by
the century's end technology would
have advanced sufficiently that de
veloped countries like the United
States and Great Britain would
have achieved a 15-hour work week.
While it is true that technology has
led to massive gains in overall pro

ductivity, a three to four hour work
day simply hasn't materialized.
If anything, people are working
harder and being paid less (relative
to their output): In the United
States, for example, worker produc
tivity has increased by 254 percent
from 1948 to 2011, but hourly com
pensation has seen only seen a 113
percent increase, which is less than
half of what it should be if pay fol
lows productivity. Workers are con
stantly told to increase their produc
tivity through obtaining new skills,
but, as we can see, it just doesn't re
ally pay off for the workers them
selves.
At the same time, governments
are investing heavily in technologi
cal innovation, seeing it as the key to
increasing productivity, lowering
costs of production and fostering
greater competitiveness. While new
technology is often readily adopted,
the social costs that come with such
changes are virtually never dis
cussed.
It seems as if everybody has held
a quasi-religious faith in the auto
matic beneficence of technological
progress, assuming that greater in
vestments in technology naturally
brings about economic growth, jobs

and shorter working hours.
But it hasn't. Laborsaving tech
nologies have not been used to save
workers' labor but rather to accrue
greater profits for the top echelons.
Productivity gains have gone to
those with power, at the expense of
those without it.
To the extent that there have
been tangible benefits from automa
tion, they have gone in only one di
rection: up. Today, labor's share of
income is declining, contributing to
greater inequality and CEO and
managers sitting on fat bonuses and
paychecks. The Occupy Movements
shed some light on these inequali
ties, but little has changed after its
fizzling out.
So what have we got with all that
technological progress? Instead of
being relieved of effort, workers
have been relieved of their liveli
hood. As I have written in a previous
column, technology is putting people
out of work faster than ever. Theo
retically, that might be a good thing
because people are now relieved
from mindless, menial jobs that sap
the human soul. But in practice, un
employment in capitalist societies
that provide little welfare provisions
means a very hard life, not self-actu
alization.
Unless, of course, you are living
in Switzerland, a country that is go
ing through a referendum to give
every adult a basic income of 2500
francs (USDS2BOO) regardless of
employment status.
Such proposals would probably
be met with suspicion even in the
most liberal quarters of United
States: "Work" and "ethics" have
such a strong link in people's heads
that paying someone for not working
is simply unacceptable, and well, "so
cialist." In the United States, that la
bel is apparently a sufficient reason
to kill a proposal regardless of its
merits.
"Radical" proposals aside, it is
probably time to take a break from
singing paeans to technological
progress to take stock of unexam
ined assumptions. We have blithely
assumed that once we get the com
petition going in a capitalist system,
it will promote technological
progress and things will take care of
themselves, when really this is an ill
defined faith that is rarely articulat
ed with logical rigor and clarity.
When we examine these assump
tions closely, we see that the causal
chain is ambiguous at every link:
Adoption of new technology does
not necessarily lead to increases in
productivity, and productivity gains
might not translate into better wel
fare and standard of living for all.
Some will win and many will lose
there is nothing automatic about
the magic loop between technology
and welfare. They merely follow
from the social choices made by
those who have had the power to de
cide who gets what.

For as long as I can remember,
my mother has been working
as an office secretary, a 9-to-5
job that isn't the most exciting in the
world. But it was a livelihood that,
though not well paying, sustained
the family.
