# ROWERS READY FOR REGATTA
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
This week, the Stanford men's crew team
will prepare for the Head of the Charles Re
gatta (HOTC), the world's largest two-day
rowing competition. Since 1965, the HOTC
has hosted the world's best crew teams and
attracts over 9,000 athletes and 300,000 spec
tators each year to the Charles River be
tween Boston and Cambridge.
Stanford won the Championship Fours
one of the most prestigious events last
year and will send another four boats this
weekend. Stanford will return senior stroke
seat Austin Hack, junior three seat Scott
Roycroft, junior bow seat Kaess Smit and
sophomore coxswain Nathalie Weiss. The
team will also welcome freshman two seat
Ryan Hails to the boat.
"We have a good amount of experience in
the boat, and we're all used to the race and
know how to win the race to some degree. It's
great to be going again, and Ryan seems to
be stepping up pretty seamlessly," Roycroft
said. "But at the same time, it's a new boat, it
rows differently and we have to all refocus
and not think that we have any outstanding
ability or advantage as returners. It's a new
race and a new year, so we've got to step up."
The HOTC will offer a different look for
many of the rowers from normal spring rac
ing due to its status as a head race, in which
boats leave one at a time to compete against
the clock instead of starting together and
competing head to head. There are no lanes,
and the boat must follow the course of the
river, making the job of the coxswain that
much more important.
"During the sprint season, my job is just
to go straight, and there are all different
lanes," Weiss said, "but in head races, I steer
the course and there's pretty much a 180-de
gree turn in the course, and so I make sure
that we cut that turn as closely as possible
and make it easy on the boys."
Another distinction that Weiss made will be

at the end of the race, at which point it will still
be unclear how the team is doing in compari
son to other teams. Instead of getting a push of
adrenaline at the end as it tries to pass the near
est boat, it will just be important to focus on not
getting passed by teams with later starts.
The length of the race is also different at
the HOTC. A normal spring race is typically
two kilometers, whereas the HOTC is slightly
over five kilometers, making endurance a
more significant factor in the race.
Boats start the race at 15-second intervals,
with starting order based on the crew's finish
ing time the previous year. Since Stanford won
last year, it will leave the starting line first.
"It means we get to go out a lot harder be
cause when you start behind someone else, the

boats create a lot of wake, but when you start
first, it's clear sailing," Hack said. "The down
side of that is Nathalie can't really see if we're
gaining on anybody or losing, whereas we can
kind of see the boats behind us, which is an ad
vantage. It'll definitely be different. Our
coaches are making us focus on the first half of
the race."
Last year, the Card finished with a time of
16:50.385 a convincing six-second win over
the University of Washington. This year, the
main competition will again be Washington.
"[The Huskies are] always good, and
they're incredibly deep. Then* four will be
great, and their eight will be great," Kaess
said. "Also the senior national team, the guys
who will be on the Olympic team and who have

been on the Olympic team, have submitted a
few entries, so they're also very good."
Despite the strong competition, with expe
rience and a prime starting position on its side,
the Card is still in a good place to do damage
at the HOTC once again.
Hack believes that it will just be important
to "put your head down, and do your own
thing, and do it well" as the Cardinal looks to
claim its second straight victory in the annu
al regatta.
The Men's Championship Fours race is
scheduled to begin at 2:31 p.m. EDT on Sun
day in Cambridge, Mass.

Senior Austin Hack (above) was one of the members of the Cardinal men's rowing team that finished in first place in the Championship
Fours at the Head of the Charles Regatta last year. This weekend, he and his teammates will look to defend their first-place finish.
This week, the Stanford men's crew team
will prepare for the Head of the Charles Re
gatta (HOTC), the world's largest two-day
rowing competition. Since 1965, the HOTC
has hosted the world's best crew teams and
attracts over 9,000 athletes and 300,000 spec
tators each year to the Charles River be
tween Boston and Cambridge.
Stanford won the Championship Fours
one of the most prestigious events last
year and will send another four boats this
weekend. Stanford will return senior stroke
seat Austin Hack, junior three seat Scott
Roycroft, junior bow seat Kaess Smit and
sophomore coxswain Nathalie Weiss. The
team will also welcome freshman two seat
Ryan Hails to the boat.
"We have a good amount of experience in
the boat, and we're all used to the race and
know how to win the race to some degree. It's
great to be going again, and Ryan seems to
be stepping up pretty seamlessly," Roycroft
said. "But at the same time, it's a new boat, it
rows differently and we have to all refocus
and not think that we have any outstanding
ability or advantage as returners. It's a new
race and a new year, so we've got to step up."
The HOTC will offer a different look for
many of the rowers from normal spring rac
ing due to its status as a head race, in which
boats leave one at a time to compete against
the clock instead of starting together and
competing head to head. There are no lanes,
and the boat must follow the course of the
river, making the job of the coxswain that
much more important.
"During the sprint season, my job is just
to go straight, and there are all different
lanes," Weiss said, "but in head races, I steer
the course and there's pretty much a 180-de
gree turn in the course, and so I make sure
that we cut that turn as closely as possible
and make it easy on the boys."
Another distinction that Weiss made will be

at the end of the race, at which point it will still
be unclear how the team is doing in compari
son to other teams. Instead of getting a push of
adrenaline at the end as it tries to pass the near
est boat, it will just be important to focus on not
getting passed by teams with later starts.
The length of the race is also different at
the HOTC. A normal spring race is typically
two kilometers, whereas the HOTC is slightly
over five kilometers, making endurance a
more significant factor in the race.
Boats start the race at 15-second intervals,
with starting order based on the crew's finish
ing time the previous year. Since Stanford won
last year, it will leave the starting line first.
"It means we get to go out a lot harder be
cause when you start behind someone else, the

boats create a lot of wake, but when you start
first, it's clear sailing," Hack said. "The down
side of that is Nathalie can't really see if we're
gaining on anybody or losing, whereas we can
kind of see the boats behind us, which is an ad
vantage. It'll definitely be different. Our
coaches are making us focus on the first half of
the race."
Last year, the Card finished with a time of
16:50.385 a convincing six-second win over
the University of Washington. This year, the
main competition will again be Washington.
"[The Huskies are] always good, and
they're incredibly deep. Then* four will be
great, and their eight will be great," Kaess
said. "Also the senior national team, the guys
who will be on the Olympic team and who have

been on the Olympic team, have submitted a
few entries, so they're also very good."
Despite the strong competition, with expe
rience and a prime starting position on its side,
the Card is still in a good place to do damage
at the HOTC once again.
Hack believes that it will just be important
to "put your head down, and do your own
thing, and do it well" as the Cardinal looks to
claim its second straight victory in the annu
al regatta.
