## BOSP offers new summer seminars Eight new overseas programs include first in West Africa 
### MICHAEL TUSCHMAN 
The Bing Overseas Studies Program
(BOSP) is offering eight overseas semi
nars for Summer 2014, including two lo
cations in England, one in Ghana and
one in Ecuador.
Each seminal- provides students with
a three-week intensive study abroad op
portunity with a Stanford faculty mem
ber in a foreign country.
In January, BOSP asked Stanford
faculty to submit proposals for future
overseas seminars in countries of their
choosing, said BOSP Director Ramon
Saldivar. The proposals are reviewed by
a committee of Stanford faculty, who
make the final decision on which semi
nars will be offered.
According to Saldivar, the commit
tee received more proposals this year
than it could facilitate since the sum
mer seminars program re-launched
two years ago.
"We don't tell people where they
should go teach seminars. The faculty
come to us with ideas," Saldivar said.
"Like Sophomore College, they come
to us with an idea for a research topic
that they think will benefit students'
progression through their academic
curriculum."
Sean Hanretta, an associate profes
sor of history, has spent his summers
working in Ghana for the past eight
years and will be leading a seminar
there this summer. The seminar will fo
cus on art, religion, culture and develop
ment in West Africa.
Hanretta said he is excited to see
BOSP expanding programs to previous
ly underrepresented study-abroad loca
tions.
"This is the first official program of
any kind that Stanford has ever had in
West Africa," Hanretta said. "We
haven't had a presence before and there
is an untapped demand."
Hanretta said he believes the semi
nal" in Ghana will support the growing
interest
in studying abroad in Africa, especially
after the announcement of a new sum
mer quarter-long program in Cape
Town.
Hanretta said the significant amount
of travel that will be done in his seminal*
will allow students to experience Ghana
ian culture and society in a fast-paced
but effective way
"We are pretty much going through
all the major sites in the southern half of
the country," Hanretta said. "We will be
doing a lot of meeting with people and
experiential learning through hands-on
activities."
Stephen Goodspeed 'l6, who partici
pated in a seminar in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil last summer, said the program al
lowed for an incredible breadth of stu
dent and experience.
"The focus of our work was on the
pacification and socioeconom
ic development of the slums in
Rio called favelas," Good
speed said. "We were able to
not only meet with chiefs of
police in charge of pacification,
but we also had meals with
several favela families and
heard a much more personal
take on the situation."
Although some of the sem
inars focus on exposure to the
culture of the destination
country, BOSP Executive Di
rector Irene Kennedy said the

goal of the seminar program
is very different than that of
the quarter-long BOSP pro
grams and involves less of an
emphasis on cultural immer
sion than on a first glance.
"Students looking for cul
tural immersion and language
immersion, like living with a lo
cal family, should apply to our
other programs," Kennedy
said. "Our overseas seminars
are focused on an academic
experience with a Stanford
faculty member."
The deadline to apply to an
overseas seminar is Nov. 3.
