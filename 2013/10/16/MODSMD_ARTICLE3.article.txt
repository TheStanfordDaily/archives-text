# Senate to vote on BJA bylaws bill
## Senators angered by lark of initial student input in changes to bylaws 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
Next Tbesday, the 15th Undergraduate Sen
ate will vote on a bill to overrule changes made to
bylaws of the Board of Judicial Affairs (BJA)
without obtaining input from the Senate.
While the BJA has the authority to imple

but found out in late September that these by
laws had already been changed when the Senate
was out of session for the summer.

Finley said he and the Senate were left com

Both Finley and Holston mentioned their
hesitancy to take action in June because they
were waiting on updates from ASSU Executive
Billy Gallagher, who, according to the senators,
was looking into the matter.
"It seems like [B JA] really want to amend the
spirit of the charter and in order to do that you
need an actual chatter amendment —which re
quires our approval, not just forwarding [an
email] to the chair—which is why I'm opposed
to all of it," Finley said.
In response, the Undergraduate Senate and
the GSC have each drafted similar bills to over-
