# Senate to vote on BJA bylaws bill
## Senators angered by lark of initial student input in changes to bylaws 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
Next Tbesday, the 15th Undergraduate Sen
ate will vote on a bill to overrule changes made to
bylaws of the Board of Judicial Affairs (BJA)
without obtaining input from the Senate.
While the BJA has the authority to imple
ment these changes through majority vote, Sen
ator John-Lancaster Finley 'l6, the Senate point
person on matters pertaining to the BJA, and
several other senators as well as the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) are concerned about

their lack of input in this process.
Both Associate Dean & Director of the Office
of Community Standards (OCS) Koren
Bakkegard and Dean of Student Life Chris Grif
fith were present at the meeting, which intended
to focus on establishing a better working rela
tionship between the ASSU and the OCS. In
stead, the focus moved largely to the senators'
concern with the OCS's desire to shift judicial af
fairs into an educational process, and to the lack
of student input provided in this decision.
Senate Chair Ben Holston'ls received an
email last June about proposed changes to the in
terpretation of the honor code and the bylaws,
but found out in late September that these by
laws had already been changed when the Senate
was out of session for the summer.

Finley said he and the Senate were left com
pletely in the dark about any of the changes.
Both Finley and Holston mentioned their
hesitancy to take action in June because they
were waiting on updates from ASSU Executive
Billy Gallagher, who, according to the senators,
was looking into the matter.
"It seems like [B JA] really want to amend the
spirit of the charter and in order to do that you
need an actual chatter amendment —which re
quires our approval, not just forwarding [an
email] to the chair—which is why I'm opposed
to all of it," Finley said.
In response, the Undergraduate Senate and
the GSC have each drafted similar bills to over-

rule the B JA bylaws. The Un
dergraduate Senate will vote
on its bill next Tuesday, follow
ing a senate discussion with
one of the B JA co-chairs.
"The entire change in the
bylaws reflects an attitude of
moving away from the judicial
process and moving towards
one more focused on educa
tion," Finley said after the
meeting. "I think that having
an educational process kind of
means the presumption of
guilt, in that it's saying you've
done something wrong and
we are going to educate you
on how to make it better."
Senator Ilya
Mouzykantskii 'l6 agreed.
"My concern is that, based
on the case study and anec
dotal reports that I as a sena
tor and other senators have
received, [the judicial charter
of 1997] is flatly being ig
nored," Mouzykantskii said
after the meeting. "I'm con
cerned that the decisions that
are being made violate the
spirit and the word of the judi
cial code."
Mouzykantskii asked Grif
fith four times when the stu
dent body would be receiving
a response to the case study.
Griffith answered, saying that
she had responded to individ
uals on the phone, in email
and through in-person meet
ings, and that this was no
longer relevant.
"I believe that the campus
community deserves a written

and succinct response to the
case study, and the fact that
the Office of Community
Standards does not want to
provide that is damning,"
Mouzykantskii said.
Senators also raised other
concerns with the allegations
made in the case study, some
of which were refuted by Grif
fith and Bakkegard. Despite
the heated conversation, the
open forum concluded with a
desire from both the OCS and
the Senate to increase student
input into the process.
Griffith specifically sug
gested creating a committee
that included a subset of the
Senate and the GSC to start
working with the OCS to
learn about the process and
provide input. Holston plans
to start working on creating
this committee as soon as pos
sible.
"There are serious issues
that they didn't provide satis
factory enough answers for, so
there's more work to be
done," Holston said. "I think
it's going to be more appropri
ately handled in a committee
setting."
During the second portion
of the meeting the Senate
passed the Winter Quarter
Grant Bill which will allow
general fees groups to apply
for money for winter quarter
events and the Senate In
novation Bill.
The Senate Innovation
Bill, which barely passed the
necessary 2/3 vote, will give
each senator $3,000 to pursue
both students' and their own
initiatives in the Stanford
community. Mouzykantskii
who authored the bill with the

help of Assistant Financial
Manager Stephen Trusheim
'l3 M.S. 'l4 was particular
ly excited about its passing.
Mouzykantskii also fol
lowed up on the 8:30 a.m. class
discussion from the previous
week. He and ASSU Execu
tive Dan Ashton 'l4 attended
the Faculty Senate meeting
last Thursday and received

positive feedback from their
proposed amendment.

The Undergraduate Sen
ate unanimously passed the
resolution supporting the
amendment to push back the
registrar's proposed new
schedule by 30 minutes, which
would keep the earliest class
times beginning at 9 a.m. Ad
ditionally, the Senate passed
$24,298.14 in funding bills.

on the case study and anec
dotal reports that I as a sena
tor and other senators have
received, [the judicial charter
of 1997] is flatly being ig
nored," Mouzykantskii said
after the meeting. "I'm con
cerned that the decisions that
are being made violate the
spirit and the word of the judi
cial code."
Mouzykantskii asked Grif
fith four times when the stu
dent body would be receiving
a response to the case study.
Griffith answered, saying that
she had responded to individ
uals on the phone, in email
and through in-person meet
ings, and that this was no
longer relevant.
"I believe that the campus
community deserves a written

and succinct response to the
case study, and the fact that
the Office of Community
Standards does not want to
provide that is damning,"
Mouzykantskii said.
Senators also raised other
concerns with the allegations
made in the case study, some
of which were refuted by Grif
fith and Bakkegard. Despite
the heated conversation, the
open forum concluded with a
desire from both the OCS and
the Senate to increase student
input into the process.
Griffith specifically sug
gested creating a committee
that included a subset of the
Senate and the GSC to start
working with the OCS to
learn about the process and
provide input. Holston plans
to start working on creating
this committee as soon as pos
sible.
"There are serious issues
that they didn't provide satis
factory enough answers for, so
there's more work to be
done," Holston said. "I think
it's going to be more appropri
ately handled in a committee
setting."
During the second portion
of the meeting the Senate
passed the Winter Quarter
Grant Bill which will allow
general fees groups to apply
for money for winter quarter
events and the Senate In
novation Bill.
The Senate Innovation
Bill, which barely passed the
necessary 2/3 vote, will give
each senator $3,000 to pursue
both students' and their own
initiatives in the Stanford
community. Mouzykantskii
who authored the bill with the

help of Assistant Financial
Manager Stephen Trusheim
'l3 M.S. 'l4 was particular
ly excited about its passing.
Mouzykantskii also fol
lowed up on the 8:30 a.m. class
discussion from the previous
week. He and ASSU Execu
tive Dan Ashton 'l4 attended
the Faculty Senate meeting
last Thursday and received

positive feedback from their
proposed amendment.

The Undergraduate Sen
ate unanimously passed the
resolution supporting the
amendment to push back the
registrar's proposed new
schedule by 30 minutes, which
would keep the earliest class
times beginning at 9 a.m. Ad
ditionally, the Senate passed
$24,298.14 in funding bills.

Next Tbesday, the 15th Undergraduate Sen
ate will vote on a bill to overrule changes made to
bylaws of the Board of Judicial Affairs (BJA)
without obtaining input from the Senate.
While the BJA has the authority to imple
ment these changes through majority vote, Sen
ator John-Lancaster Finley 'l6, the Senate point
person on matters pertaining to the BJA, and
several other senators as well as the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) are concerned about

their lack of input in this process.
Both Associate Dean & Director of the Office
of Community Standards (OCS) Koren
Bakkegard and Dean of Student Life Chris Grif
fith were present at the meeting, which intended
to focus on establishing a better working rela
tionship between the ASSU and the OCS. In
stead, the focus moved largely to the senators'
concern with the OCS's desire to shift judicial af
fairs into an educational process, and to the lack
of student input provided in this decision.
Senate Chair Ben Holston'ls received an
email last June about proposed changes to the in
terpretation of the honor code and the bylaws,
but found out in late September that these by
laws had already been changed when the Senate
was out of session for the summer.

Finley said he and the Senate were left com
pletely in the dark about any of the changes.
Both Finley and Holston mentioned their
hesitancy to take action in June because they
were waiting on updates from ASSU Executive
Billy Gallagher, who, according to the senators,
was looking into the matter.
"It seems like [B JA] really want to amend the
spirit of the charter and in order to do that you
need an actual chatter amendment —which re
quires our approval, not just forwarding [an
email] to the chair—which is why I'm opposed
to all of it," Finley said.
In response, the Undergraduate Senate and
the GSC have each drafted similar bills to over-

rule the B JA bylaws. The Un
dergraduate Senate will vote
on its bill next Tuesday, follow
ing a senate discussion with
one of the B JA co-chairs.
"The entire change in the
bylaws reflects an attitude of
moving away from the judicial
process and moving towards
one more focused on educa
tion," Finley said after the
meeting. "I think that having
an educational process kind of
means the presumption of
guilt, in that it's saying you've
done something wrong and
we are going to educate you
on how to make it better."
