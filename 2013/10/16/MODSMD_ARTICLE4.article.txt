## CAPS to start new evening open hours Due to rising student demand, CAPS adds new psychiatrist and extra hours 
### ALI GALI 
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) will start offering evening hours on a
limited basis.
CAPS Director Ronald Albucher said the
addition of open hours is due to a request from
Rebecca Smith-Coggins, associate dean for
Medical Student Life Advising, and aims to ac
commodate medical students, whose class
schedules conflict with CAPS's regular busi
ness hours.
According to Nikita Desai 'l5, president of
Stanford Peace of Mind (SPoM), the increase in
CAPS hours is a "positive development" for all
students, not just those in the medical field.

"From what I hear there is plenty of de
mand for CAPS services, and there's usually al
ways a shortage of appointments available for
students," she said.
The new evening time slots will be open to
the entire Stanford community Monday
through Thursday.
CAPS has seen several other changes in its

offerings during the past few years, including
an increase in staff in response to a growing
number of student visits. This year, CAPS has
added a new psychiatrist who will work three
days a week.
Last year, CAPS saw about 14.5 percent of

the undergraduate and grad
uate populations, according
to Albucher.
"That is the highest it has
ever been," Albucher said. "I
think that the biggest reason
is more and more people are
comfortable accessing the
service."
According to Albucher,
the increase in visits may be
attributed to students be
coming better educated on
the resources that CAPS of
fers.
Albucher also said that
over the years, lectures giv
en on campus by profession
als might have helped stu
dents recognize early signs
of mental issues and motivat
ed them to seek help sooner.
CAPS also aims to in
crease the number of inter
national students who use
the services offered this
year, as it is a demographic
that Albucher said is typical
ly underrepresented at
CAPS, although this number
has also been on the rise.
"We have seen a gradual
increase in the utilization of
CAPS services over the last
three years, but want to see
if we can improve further up
on this," Albucher said.
He said CAPS will meet

with the Mental Health and
Well-Being Advisory Board
and the Graduate Student
Council this year to address
the issue.

On a broader level, CAPS
continues to work towards
making students feel more
comfortable utilizing its
services. Albucher cited
CAPS's various connections
with community centers, in
cluding El Centro Chicano,
as an example of this effort.
He said that they are now
present in most of the com
munity centers on campus.
"We offer drop-in hours
and we even see patients
there," he said. Apart from
these community centers,
CAPS also has direct connec
tions with the School of Med
icine and the School of Engi-

neering.
CAPS will also be assess
ing student satisfaction after
appointments this year, in
addition to the phone triage
evaluation it performs prior
to booking.
"Basically, when a stu
dent comes in, they will fill
out a survey in the waiting
area that will assess their
symptoms and satisfaction,"
Albucher said. "We will have
away to monitor our service
as well as to compare it with
other colleges' counseling
centers."
