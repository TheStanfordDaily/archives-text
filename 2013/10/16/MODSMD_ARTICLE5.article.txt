## Renovations in FloMo praised 
### JENNA SHAPIRO 
Florence Moore Hall (FloMo) underwent sever
al major renovations that have garnered overall
positive responses from residents, despite nostal
gia for the removed roof catwalks.
The main work done to the seven-house under
graduate residence included a complete makeover
of the dining hall, renovated restrooms and newly
painted walls. Outside the buildings, wooden ta
bles, umbrella covers and rocking chairs have re
placed the picnic benches.
Students like Austin Lewis 'l5, a resident assis
tant (RA) in Loro who also spent his freshman year
in the same dorm, notice the most apparent differ
ence in the dining hall. Sparkling, steel surfaces
and a more open walking space characterize the
renovated cafeteria.
"The dining hall was notoriously crowded, and

Florence Moore Hall underwent extensive renovations over the summer and this fall. Despite the residence's trademark catwalks
being stripped, student response to the changes, which include new bathrooms and a renovated dining facility, have been positive.
they've really opened it up,
allowing for more space,"
Lewis said. "It's just easier
to move around in there,
particularly on Sundays
when everyone comes here
for Indian food."
Ramona Malczynski 'l4,
living in FloMo for her third
year, also sees a marked im
provement in the quality of
the food itself.
"The food was already
the best, but now it's un
doubtedly the best," Mal
czynski said.
Among the renovations,
only the removal of the cat
walks something students
considered to be a trade

mark just as representative
of FloMo as the weekly Indi
an food has prompted
mixed reactions.
Last year, the decision to
remove the wooden walk
ways due to safety precau
tions met resistance from
some students. The catwalks
were ultimately taken down
due to their age and failure
to meet the accessibility
standards of the Americans
with Disabilities Act. Many
understand the necessity of
their removal, but a sense of
nostalgia still lingers.
"I'm still really disap
pointed that the catwalks are
gone," said Johnathan
Bowes 'l5, another return
ing FloMo resident and RA
of Cardenal. "They were
such a huge part of the Flo-
Mo culture."
Students spoke of the

tanning, talking, stargazing,
yoga and studying that oc
curred on the catwalks. In
addition, the catwalks also
served a practical purpose of
connecting the dorms. Stu
dents argued that, without
the walkways, they cannot
move directly between
dorms but instead must
travel to other dorms via
ground level.
Despite the physical dis
connect between dorms,
Malczynski described how
the updated lounge areas
now serve a similar social
purpose that the walkways
did.
"I understand the cat
walks were probably a safety
hazard, so I think the reno
vations are mostly positive,"
Malczynski said. "People
hang out in the lounge now
because we can project

movies onto the SMART
Board, and there are a lot
more areas to be in the
lounge."
Lewis also perceives the
loss of the catwalks as an un
fortunate, but necessary and
somewhat innocuous, change.
"At first I was a little dis
appointed by the [removal
of] catwalks," Lewis said.
"But although it's slightly
annoying to go down the
flights of stairs and back up,
it really hasn't changed any
thing."
While some have not felt
dramatic downsides of the
renovation, others suggest
that a safer, more structural
ly sound set of catwalks
would be an idea worth pur
suing.
