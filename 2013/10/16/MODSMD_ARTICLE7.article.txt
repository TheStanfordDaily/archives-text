## Jim Clark donates $60 million to Stanford 
### â€“ Nikhita Obeegadoo 
Former Stanford profes
sor and founder of Netscape
and Silicon Graphics, Jim
Clark, donated $6O million to
Stanford for the purpose of
interdisciplinary research
spanning life sciences, tech
nology and engineering.
Research across disci
plines was a cornerstone of
Clark's own experience at
Stanford as a professor in the
early 1980s, during which he
created computer chip tech
nologies that he later used in
his first private venture, Sili
con Graphics and Netscape.
The donation was an
nounced during a celebration
of the 10th anniversary of the
James H. Clark Center for
Biomedical Engineering and
Sciences the product of
Clark's previous donation.

Clark withheld part of an
original donation of $l5O mil
lion in 2001 on account of leg
islation limiting government
funding on state research,
and, consequently, a lead gift
of $9O million went towards
the construction of the 146,000
square-foot Clark Center.
"The research and tech
nology that have been pro
duced in the Clark Center
over the past 10 years have
exceeded my wildest expec
tations and, it is clear, will
continue to make a big im
pact on human health going
forward," Clark said in an ar
ticle from the Silicon Valley
Business Journal. "My gift to
Stanford is one of the best
things I have ever done."
