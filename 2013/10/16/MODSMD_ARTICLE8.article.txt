## Coaching conundrums abound 
### Viggy Venkataraman 
When Tom Brady
threw one of the
worst interceptions
of his storied ca
reer against the
New Orleans Saints, I turned the TV
off and went back to my homework.
After all, there were just over two
minutes left on the clock, the opposing
quarterback was Drew Brees, the op
posing head coach was Sean Payton
and in the immortal words of Bait
Scott, the Patriots defense has often
struggled to "stop a nosebleed."
After the gut-wrenching Stanford
loss the day before, I just didn't have
it in me to tough out the rest of the
game. Like half the fans in attendance
at Gillette Stadium, I chickened out
and left.
Little did I realize that Tom Terrif
ic had one last hurrah left in him.
About 20 minutes later, my phone
buzzed with the unlikely score: 30-27
in favor of the Patriots. I stared at it in
disbelief before texting my room
mate. His response? "It has to be an
ESPN glitch or something."
But nay... Verily, the Patriots had
actually beaten the Saints on a laser
strike from Tom Brady to Kenbrell
Thompkins with just five seconds to
go in the game. In all the years I have
been watching football, this game was
probably the biggest emotional roller
coaster of all. In the last five minutes
of the game, the Patriots proceeded
from being certain winners to losers
to winners to losers to winners again.
One of the most intriguing games
in recent memory was also home to a
bevy of tough coaching decisions that
equally favored and dismembered
the head coaches on both sides of the
ball. On the Patriots' sideline, Bill Be
lichick chose to go for it on fourth
and-6 from his own 25-yard line de
spite holding all three timeouts with
more than three minutes on the
clock, without even taking into ac
count the surefire score he would be
giving up should the conversion at
tempt fail. Right after getting the
ball back, Sean Payton of the Saints
proceeded to run almost no time off
the clock, throwing incomplete on
third down before booting a field goal
to put them up by a full four points.
However, it looked as if all that was
rendered moot as Brady was inter
cepted on the very next play Payton
proceeded to dial up three weak runs
up the middle before punting the ball
back to the Patriots offense, giving
them then- third possession in under
three minutes.
The rest, as they say, is history
Despite more dropped passes, more
wide receivers getting injured and the
immortal Jake Locker passing Brady
on ESPN's total QBR rankings table
(while injured), Brady marched the
Patriots down the field before deliver
ing a pinpoint laser to the back corner
of the end zone, where Jabari Greer
was caught watching the backfield as
Thompkins outfought him in the air
and tapped his toes inbounds.
Touchdown and ballgame.
But in this day and age, it would be
remiss of me to let the coaches off
without analyzing their decisions. It
would seem that Belichick was right
to go for it on fourth down that early
since his team won, but it was certain
ly a highly risky suggestion.
Equally shaky is Payton's play
calling. I know how agitated we get
when teams get all hyper-conserva
tive and run their back into the line
three times, but when you're already
in field goal range and all the defense
cares about is preventing the touch
down, just run the ball! The lack of
time run off the clock proved especial
ly costly as the Patriots managed to
somehow get the ball back after all
their mistakes and astonishingly still
had time to mount a game-winning
drive.
The other deep insight I can pro
vide is that coaching is hard. In games
like these I'm not sure that even hard
math could produce a single set of
coaching directives that would en
hance someone's chance of winning;
there are just too many variables.
Sometimes, you just have to roll with
the punches and let the chips fall
where they may. To quote the famous
sports adage: "There is a reason they
play the game on the field, not on pa
per." Now, if only my homework oper
ated the same way...

game. Like half the fans in attendance
at Gillette Stadium, I chickened out
and left.
Little did I realize that Tom Terrif
ic had one last hurrah left in him.
About 20 minutes later, my phone
buzzed with the unlikely score: 30-27
in favor of the Patriots. I stared at it in
disbelief before texting my room
mate. His response? "It has to be an
ESPN glitch or something."
But nay... Verily, the Patriots had
actually beaten the Saints on a laser
strike from Tom Brady to Kenbrell
Thompkins with just five seconds to
go in the game. In all the years I have
been watching football, this game was
probably the biggest emotional roller
coaster of all. In the last five minutes
of the game, the Patriots proceeded
from being certain winners to losers
to winners to losers to winners again.
One of the most intriguing games
in recent memory was also home to a
bevy of tough coaching decisions that
equally favored and dismembered
the head coaches on both sides of the
ball. On the Patriots' sideline, Bill Be
lichick chose to go for it on fourth
and-6 from his own 25-yard line de
spite holding all three timeouts with
more than three minutes on the
clock, without even taking into ac
count the surefire score he would be
giving up should the conversion at
tempt fail. Right after getting the
ball back, Sean Payton of the Saints
proceeded to run almost no time off
the clock, throwing incomplete on
third down before booting a field goal
to put them up by a full four points.
However, it looked as if all that was
rendered moot as Brady was inter
cepted on the very next play Payton
proceeded to dial up three weak runs
up the middle before punting the ball
back to the Patriots offense, giving
them then- third possession in under
three minutes.
The rest, as they say, is history
Despite more dropped passes, more
wide receivers getting injured and the
immortal Jake Locker passing Brady
on ESPN's total QBR rankings table
(while injured), Brady marched the
Patriots down the field before deliver
ing a pinpoint laser to the back corner
of the end zone, where Jabari Greer
was caught watching the backfield as
Thompkins outfought him in the air
and tapped his toes inbounds.
Touchdown and ballgame.
But in this day and age, it would be
remiss of me to let the coaches off
without analyzing their decisions. It
would seem that Belichick was right
to go for it on fourth down that early
since his team won, but it was certain
ly a highly risky suggestion.
Equally shaky is Payton's play
calling. I know how agitated we get
when teams get all hyper-conserva
tive and run their back into the line
three times, but when you're already
in field goal range and all the defense
cares about is preventing the touch
down, just run the ball! The lack of
time run off the clock proved especial
ly costly as the Patriots managed to
somehow get the ball back after all
their mistakes and astonishingly still
had time to mount a game-winning
drive.
The other deep insight I can pro
vide is that coaching is hard. In games
like these I'm not sure that even hard
math could produce a single set of
coaching directives that would en
hance someone's chance of winning;
there are just too many variables.
Sometimes, you just have to roll with
the punches and let the chips fall
where they may. To quote the famous
sports adage: "There is a reason they
play the game on the field, not on pa
per." Now, if only my homework oper
ated the same way...

When Tom Brady
threw one of the
worst interceptions
of his storied ca
reer against the
New Orleans Saints, I turned the TV
off and went back to my homework.
After all, there were just over two
minutes left on the clock, the opposing
quarterback was Drew Brees, the op
posing head coach was Sean Payton
and in the immortal words of Bait
Scott, the Patriots defense has often
struggled to "stop a nosebleed."
After the gut-wrenching Stanford
loss the day before, I just didn't have
it in me to tough out the rest of the
game. Like half the fans in attendance
at Gillette Stadium, I chickened out
and left.
