ior midfielder J J Koval. The follow
ing is a condensed, version of their
conversation. For the full transcript, go to

Sam Fisher (SF): First of all, does it feel real yet
that you're a senior and this is your last go-around
here? I know it happens so fast.

JJ Koval (JK):Gosh, it does go so fast. Does it feel
real? Yeah, because this last season is so important
to me, to the team. Not just because I'm a senior,

but every season is so important. And we've been
working hard at changing things since Jeremy
Gunn and John Smith got here. So yeah, it's an im
portant season, and it means even more to me be
cause it is my senior year. Just being aware of the
fact that, yeah, this is the last season that I've got
playing Stanford soccer and it's such a blessing.
And I've enjoyed it so much, and it's hard to see
the tail end of it coming. But it just makes me rel
ish every moment even more.

SF: It's been a wild season so far. Some big wins,
some tough losses, and I think bookended your
first game and then your most recent game by
two 3-3 draws. You don't see that a lot. So what's
this season been like for you and the team?
