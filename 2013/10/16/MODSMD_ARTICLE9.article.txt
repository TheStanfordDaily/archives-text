### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
7n the second 2013-11+ edition of the
"Senior Sit Down," The Daily's Sam
Fisher chatted with men's soccer sen
ior midfielder J J Koval. The follow
ing is a condensed, version of their
conversation. For the full transcript, go to
www.StanfordDaily.com/category/sports.
Sam Fisher (SF): First of all, does it feel real yet
that you're a senior and this is your last go-around
here? I know it happens so fast.

JJ Koval (JK):Gosh, it does go so fast. Does it feel
real? Yeah, because this last season is so important
to me, to the team. Not just because I'm a senior,

but every season is so important. And we've been
working hard at changing things since Jeremy
Gunn and John Smith got here. So yeah, it's an im
portant season, and it means even more to me be
cause it is my senior year. Just being aware of the
fact that, yeah, this is the last season that I've got
playing Stanford soccer and it's such a blessing.
And I've enjoyed it so much, and it's hard to see
the tail end of it coming. But it just makes me rel
ish every moment even more.

SF: It's been a wild season so far. Some big wins,
some tough losses, and I think bookended your
first game and then your most recent game by
two 3-3 draws. You don't see that a lot. So what's
this season been like for you and the team?


SEAN CHRISTOFFERSON/The Stanford Daily
Senior midfielder JJ Koval (right) has started all but one match for Stanford men's soccer since
he arrived on the Farm as a freshman. He has since emerged as a key leader of Stanford's team.
JK: We've had a good start to
the season. Relative to last
year, especially, we're in a
good position. The season is
never going to go exactly how
you want it to. Soccer is a
very imperfect sport. This
past weekend, we didn't get
exactly the results that we
wanted, but the cool thing is
this next weekend we've got
another opportunity, and
that's all you can really look
forward to. So the team is in
good spirits. We're excited
about taking every challenge
in stride and looking forward
to the next one and not
dwelling too much on the
past. Like I said, it's been an
awesome start to the season.
A lot of exciting moments and
a lot of promising stuff for the
future. We've got seven
games left before the play
offs. Our goal is to win the
Pac-12 and to make it into the
playoffs, and that won't
change.
SF: You have a really big test
coming up in No. 1 Cal.
JK: Yeah, we're going to their
place on Sunday. They've ob
viously been getting good re
sults, but we're excited about
another opportunity, another
challenge. We're not fearful
at all. We're ready to go, man.
SF: You talked about that
there have been some ups
and downs this year. You're
having a pretty good start to
the year, especially compared
to last year. You've been
through a lot as a senior. A lot
of Stanford sports don't have
senior classes that have had
such a tumultuous ride. So
what's it been like for your
class? Can you talk about the
dynamic of your class and the
type of leadership that you
guys bring to the younger
guys on the team?

JK: You're right. We've seen a
lot over the past three-and-a
half years. We've seen a lot of
change over the past two
years. Gosh, coming in fresh
man year, we only had six
wins total the whole season.
I've seen the team transform
a lot from a team that wasn't
really sure how we were go
ing to do, hoping to get re
sults every game, to a team
that now, we expect to win
every single game. And that
confidence and energy, the
excitement that we have with
each other as a unit, is some
thing that I've seen change so
much. I think our mentality
has changed a ton. So, as sen
iors, we have experienced a
lot and that just gives us that

much more responsibility for
the younger guys, showing
them how much every game
matters, how much training
every single day like it's your
last training session matters.
We see what the mentality
was when we were freshmen
and sophomores and now
how the mentality has
changed. They didn't get to
experience that first mentali
ty, so it's even more impor
tant to us to instill that new
mentality in the younger
guys and teach them how im
portant every single day is to
getting better and pushing
yourself forward.
SF: As you mentioned, you
don't have a lot of days left to
do that. In season you're
probably focused on that, but
have you thought at all about
the things you want to do at
Stanford when you're no
longer on this team?
JK: I haven't thought about it
too much, to be honest. I
haven't thought about too
much other than just soccer
this whole quarter. [Senior
goalkeeper] Drew [Hutchins]
and I are on track to gradu
ate at the end of December.
So I'm not really sure what's
next. I would love to go to
med school someday I'm
just not sure exactly what the
future holds.
SF: What about soccer? Have
you thought about what kind
of role you want soccer to
play after the season? Are
you going to try to continue
playing afterwards?
JK: I want to play as long as
I can. I love the sport. I can
say that with a smile on my
face because I truly enjoy go
ing out every day and playing
this sport. It's been a dream
my whole life to play after
college and to accomplish
that would be awesome and
be such a blessing. But I'm
not thinking about that too
much right now. I'm 100-per
cent focused on the team and
the here and the now and the
unbelievable season that we
have the possibility of having.
So the answer is yeah, I want
to play soccer I don't want
to stop. I love it too much. I'm
excited about that, but it
doesn't cross my mind too
much right now.

SF: Can you talk a little bit
about the dynamic of sharing
a field and so much of your
time with Stanford women's
soccer, which is enjoying,
since you showed up, the
most successful period in its
history. You talked about
what you guys were fighting
through. You've had a really
strong start to this season
compared to years past, but
you guys went through some
tough times while they were

going through their best ever,
so what was that like for you
guys?
JK: We're happy for them
and how much success that
they've had. We see someone
out on the same field that's
doing really well in the league
that they play in, and it
makes us want to be the best
at the league that we play in.
So we respect them, but we
don't think about it too much.
We want to do just as well as
they do. A part of me would
n't want it any other way. All
the struggles taught me so
much. I don't think you would
ever want anything to be
easy, not that it's easy for [the
women's team] at all. But I've
enjoyed the struggles, too,
because I feel like they've
taught me so much about
who I am and what a team
looks like and what we should
be striving for. So I embrace
the struggles, and I'm happy
that they happened. I would
n't trade these four years for
anything different, as crazy
as that might sound. You can
look at successes in different
ways and the amount that's
changed for me individually
and as a team since I got here
freshman year to now is
amazing, and that's a big suc
cess for me.
SF: When I talked to
[women's volleyball senior
outside hitter] Rachel
Williams last week, she joked
that she has a bucket list of
things, like she's never been
to Hoover Tower. You don't
have any lists like that of
things you need to do?
JK: I don't think so.
SF: Have you been up
Hoover Tower?
JK: Yes I've been up Hoover
Tower. It's a sweet, sweet
spot. I've been up there a few
times. We've taken recruits
up there a couple of times.

SF: Do you have one place on
campus that you'll miss the
most?

JK: It's got to be [Cagan]
Stadium. Going out there on
a Friday night, having the
lights on and just the feel of a
game about to start, you
don't get anything like that
anywhere else on campus.
And I guess it just means
more to me, obviously, be
cause I play on the team and
I get to be a part of that.
Those moments make all the
hard work and effort worth
it. Those are the moments
that I'll cherish for the rest of
my life and never forget. The
pitch is definitely the thing
that I'll remember most.
