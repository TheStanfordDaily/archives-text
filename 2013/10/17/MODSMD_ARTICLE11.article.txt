The article "After absences, stu
dents adjust to Farm life" pub
lished on Oct. 9 said that Sally
Mentzer started the Resilience
Project when in fact it was
started by Adina Glickman. It
also incorrectly said that the
Resilience Project provides in
residence workshops and that a
program that matches return
ing undergrads with post-grad
student coaches was founded
only by Lourdes Andrade when
in fact it was co-founded along
with Glickman. The Daily re
grets these errors.
