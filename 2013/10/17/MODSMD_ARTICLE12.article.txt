## Dealing with the stages of sports grief 
### Winston Shi 
It seems bewildering that Stan
ford's loss to Utah felt worse
than the losses to Notre Dame
and Washington a year ago,
but I can't say it didn't.
All losses suck, but the worst part
about this one is that, while 2012's de
feats were bitter, bare-knuckle fist
fights in which the other team was as
fortunate to win as Stanford was to
lose, Utah dominated the game.
That's not to say that Utah blew
Stanford out, because the Cardinal
were six yards from eking out a victo
ry in Salt Lake City, but the Utes con
trolled the tempo for most of the
game. So, as a suddenly competent
UCLA squad approaches the Farm, I
still have Utah on my mind.
I'm not going to say that I went
through the five stages of grief (de
nial, anger, bargaining, depression and
acceptance). Fan grief isn't real grief
and it would be both callous and mis
guided to compare the two. There is a
neat framework for fan (and real)
emotion, but there are a number of
other stages that the model doesn't
represent, the most resounding of
which is disappointment.
I watched UCLAs escape against
Utah before Stanford's game and it
was more than apparent that Utah
was a very good team. The Utes have
simply had some horrendous luck be
fore. Utah didn't win because Stanford
lost. Utah had a clear and coherent
game plan and, more importantly play
ers that could cany that game plan out.
Ultimately I progressed to accepts
ance in near record time, skipping
most of the steps along the way If
Stanford plays as it did against the
Utes, and I've said this before, it has
no business being in the national
championship game.
But disappointment that was
definitely real. This was my first year
as a Stanford student in which the
Cardinal had national championship
aspirations. Although, in hindsight,
last year's squad was a few breaks
from battling for the crystal football.
The Pac-12 Championship, however,
was entirely a matter in which Stan
ford controlled its own destiny and
though pretty much nobody expected
Stanford to win the Rose Bowl, the
Card did it anyway
Coming off a Rose Bowl win, ex
pectations for Stanford this year re
sembled the hopes of the Andrew
Luck years. I sent in my early applica
tion to Stanford a couple days before
the undefeated, fourth-ranked Cardi
nal took on Oregon and lost, 53-30.1
would have applied early to Stanford
anyway, win or lose, but since I'd al
ready submitted my Common App,
the question was academic.
Of course, I hadn't actually gotten
into Stanford at the time. But I watched
the game in the school cafe with a rabid
Duck fan, and as Stanford crashed to
earth in the driving rain, our reactions
were polar opposites of the other's.
Disappointed in 2011 and disap
pointed early in 2012, last year's team
was not expected to win big, but it did
win big. It didn't submit itself to the
mercy of scheduling chaos; it was an
agent of chaos. Alabama can thank its
lucky stars for Stanford, because with
out the Cardinal, it would not have
sniffed the national championship
game. Meanwhile, Oregon was left to
rue what could have been.
Like the 2012 team, this Stanford
squad still controls its Rose Bowl des
tiny It could conceivably lose one
more game in conference and still go
to Pasadena.
Ranked at No. 13, Stanford needs
11 teams above it to lose. Two are on
its schedule UCLA next week and
Oregon. Four SEC teams will likely
beat each other up, but to what de
gree? One may wefl survive. Likewise,
I expect one ACC team out of Florida
State, Clemson and Miami to emerge
unscathed. Ohio State, Louisville and
Baylor have fewer contenders left on
their schedules, but perhaps the com
puters will finally dock them for their
strength of schedule.
None of these teams can glide
through the regular season —every
team can lose. No\y without some de
gree of luck, the Card will indeed have
to revise its aspirations. But after pain
and disappointment there is nothing
left to feel except hope. The real hope
that remains for the Cardinal, bitter
ly slim though it is, is that chaos has
happened before. Quite frankly it's
the one thing that a college football
fan can count on.

Winston Shi is in denial of the
emotional pain that is still cours
ing through him from the loss. Of
fer him some advice on how to cope
at wshi9Jf@stanford.edu.

unscathed. Ohio State, Louisville and
Baylor have fewer contenders left on
their schedules, but perhaps the com
puters will finally dock them for their
strength of schedule.
None of these teams can glide
through the regular season —every
team can lose. No\y without some de
gree of luck, the Card will indeed have
to revise its aspirations. But after pain
and disappointment there is nothing
left to feel except hope. The real hope
that remains for the Cardinal, bitter
ly slim though it is, is that chaos has
happened before. Quite frankly it's
the one thing that a college football
fan can count on.

Winston Shi is in denial of the
emotional pain that is still cours
ing through him from the loss. Of
fer him some advice on how to cope
at wshi9Jf@stanford.edu.

It seems bewildering that Stan
ford's loss to Utah felt worse
than the losses to Notre Dame
and Washington a year ago,
but I can't say it didn't.
All losses suck, but the worst part
about this one is that, while 2012's de
feats were bitter, bare-knuckle fist
fights in which the other team was as
fortunate to win as Stanford was to
lose, Utah dominated the game.
That's not to say that Utah blew
Stanford out, because the Cardinal
were six yards from eking out a victo
ry in Salt Lake City, but the Utes con
trolled the tempo for most of the
game. So, as a suddenly competent
UCLA squad approaches the Farm, I
still have Utah on my mind.
I'm not going to say that I went
through the five stages of grief (de
nial, anger, bargaining, depression and
acceptance). Fan grief isn't real grief
and it would be both callous and mis
guided to compare the two. There is a
neat framework for fan (and real)
emotion, but there are a number of
other stages that the model doesn't
represent, the most resounding of
which is disappointment.
I watched UCLAs escape against
Utah before Stanford's game and it
was more than apparent that Utah
was a very good team. The Utes have
simply had some horrendous luck be
fore. Utah didn't win because Stanford
lost. Utah had a clear and coherent
game plan and, more importantly play
ers that could cany that game plan out.
Ultimately I progressed to accepts
ance in near record time, skipping
most of the steps along the way If
Stanford plays as it did against the
Utes, and I've said this before, it has
no business being in the national
championship game.
But disappointment that was
definitely real. This was my first year
as a Stanford student in which the
Cardinal had national championship
aspirations. Although, in hindsight,
last year's squad was a few breaks
from battling for the crystal football.
The Pac-12 Championship, however,
was entirely a matter in which Stan
ford controlled its own destiny and
though pretty much nobody expected
Stanford to win the Rose Bowl, the
Card did it anyway
Coming off a Rose Bowl win, ex
pectations for Stanford this year re
sembled the hopes of the Andrew
Luck years. I sent in my early applica
tion to Stanford a couple days before
the undefeated, fourth-ranked Cardi
nal took on Oregon and lost, 53-30.1
would have applied early to Stanford
anyway, win or lose, but since I'd al
ready submitted my Common App,
the question was academic.
Of course, I hadn't actually gotten
into Stanford at the time. But I watched
the game in the school cafe with a rabid
Duck fan, and as Stanford crashed to
earth in the driving rain, our reactions
were polar opposites of the other's.
Disappointed in 2011 and disap
pointed early in 2012, last year's team
was not expected to win big, but it did
win big. It didn't submit itself to the
mercy of scheduling chaos; it was an
agent of chaos. Alabama can thank its
lucky stars for Stanford, because with
out the Cardinal, it would not have
sniffed the national championship
game. Meanwhile, Oregon was left to
rue what could have been.
Like the 2012 team, this Stanford
squad still controls its Rose Bowl des
tiny It could conceivably lose one
more game in conference and still go
to Pasadena.
Ranked at No. 13, Stanford needs
11 teams above it to lose. Two are on
its schedule UCLA next week and
Oregon. Four SEC teams will likely
beat each other up, but to what de
gree? One may wefl survive. Likewise,
I expect one ACC team out of Florida
State, Clemson and Miami to emerge
unscathed. Ohio State, Louisville and
Baylor have fewer contenders left on
their schedules, but perhaps the com
puters will finally dock them for their
strength of schedule.
