# FOOTBALL UPDATE
## PREPPING FOR TOUGH TEST 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Several days may have elapsed since
Stanford's loss to Utah, but the sting of
defeat and the resulting effects linger as
fresh as ever. The wounds from last Sat
urday's 27-21 loss showed themselves in
practice this week.
"Certain guys have an edge to them
because what we put on film last week is
not who we want to be," said head coach
David Shaw. "We have another opportu
nity. That's the best thing about being in
the middle of the season; even if you go
out and don't play your best, you get six
days to get ready for the next one."
In its loss to Utah, Stanford played
very uncharacteristically losing the
turnover margin, recording only one
sack and allowing 176 rushing yards.
Against UCLA this Saturday, Shaw and
Stanford hope to return to the level of
play it displayed against UCLA last year,
beating the Bruins twice in a span of six
days, including a win in the Pac-12
Championship Game.
"We didn't play up to our standard
and we got beat by a good football team,"
Shaw said. "We have another really good
team coming in, justifiably highly
ranked, and playing great. It's going to
take our best game to have a chance to
win."
Stanford prepares to face UCLA this
upcoming Saturday in what looks to be a
statement game for both teams Stan
ford eager to prove the loss as a fluke
and UCLA ready to show that they are
now among the elite in the Pac-12.
UCLA enters ranked No. 9 in the Asso
ciated Press Poll and hopes it can estab
lish itself as one of the country's top
teams with wins in both, or even just one,
of its two upcoming games, road trips
against Stanford and Oregon.
"They're good, they're athletic, and

they're disciplined," said senior running
back lyier Gaffney. "Usually athletic and
disciplined together are hard to come by,
but that's what makes a team great. And
UCLA has been both of those."

UCLA has allowed only one 100-yard
game from a running back all season
long, which came in the first week of the
season when Nevada's junior quarter
back Cody Fajardo rushed for 106 yards.
Gaffney and the Cardinal will look to
change that this weekend.
"It's going to come down to the three
things we got the line and the passing
game, which will inevitably open up the
run game," Gaffney elaborated. "If we
can solidify the passing and the line
game, the run game should follow suit."
The run game was noticeably absent
on the final two plays from scrimmage
for Stanford against Utah. On subse
quent third and fourth downs with 2
yards to go, Shaw opted to throw the ball
instead of handing it off to Gaffney.
"Every good player wants the ball in
that situation," said Gaffney. "Hogan
would love to have the ball in that situa
tion. Ty would love to have the ball in
that situation. I feel the same way but it
is what it is. If we score it's the right call,
if we don't it's the wrong call. It could
have gone either way."

On the other side of the ball, the de
fensive line is still reeling from injuries
senior defensive end Henry Anderson
and sophomore defensive tackle Ikenna
Nwafor are sidelined for a few more
weeks, and senior defensive tackle David
Parry and fifth-year senior Ben Gardner
have been slowed down by abdominal
and arm injuries, respectively. To in
crease the depth on the line, defensive
coordinator Derek Mason requested that
sophomore Luke Kaumatule switch from
tight end to defensive end. Through

game and will try to rack up yards against a stiff defense.
three practices, the move
seems to be going well.

"He knows a little bit
more what he needs to do,"
Shaw said. "He's a day bet
ter. But bottom line, it's high
effort and it's exactly what
we need. Right now we an
ticipate him getting some
playing time."
In other injury news,
senior kicker Jordan
Williamson tweaked a mus
cle in his leg. Shaw sounded
optimistic that Williamson
would kick Saturday, but it
is not a guarantee. If
Williamson is out, sopho
more Conrad Ukropina
would fill in.
With or without
Williamson, Stanford takes
on UCLA at 12:30 p.m. Sat
urday.

Several days may have elapsed since
Stanford's loss to Utah, but the sting of
defeat and the resulting effects linger as
fresh as ever. The wounds from last Sat
urday's 27-21 loss showed themselves in
practice this week.
"Certain guys have an edge to them
because what we put on film last week is
not who we want to be," said head coach
David Shaw. "We have another opportu
nity. That's the best thing about being in
the middle of the season; even if you go
out and don't play your best, you get six
days to get ready for the next one."
In its loss to Utah, Stanford played
very uncharacteristically losing the
turnover margin, recording only one
sack and allowing 176 rushing yards.
Against UCLA this Saturday, Shaw and
Stanford hope to return to the level of
play it displayed against UCLA last year,
beating the Bruins twice in a span of six
days, including a win in the Pac-12
Championship Game.
"We didn't play up to our standard
and we got beat by a good football team,"
Shaw said. "We have another really good
team coming in, justifiably highly
ranked, and playing great. It's going to
take our best game to have a chance to
win."
Stanford prepares to face UCLA this
upcoming Saturday in what looks to be a
statement game for both teams Stan
ford eager to prove the loss as a fluke
and UCLA ready to show that they are
now among the elite in the Pac-12.
UCLA enters ranked No. 9 in the Asso
ciated Press Poll and hopes it can estab
lish itself as one of the country's top
teams with wins in both, or even just one,
of its two upcoming games, road trips
against Stanford and Oregon.
"They're good, they're athletic, and

they're disciplined," said senior running
back lyier Gaffney. "Usually athletic and
disciplined together are hard to come by,
but that's what makes a team great. And
UCLA has been both of those."

UCLA has allowed only one 100-yard
game from a running back all season
long, which came in the first week of the
season when Nevada's junior quarter
back Cody Fajardo rushed for 106 yards.
Gaffney and the Cardinal will look to
change that this weekend.
"It's going to come down to the three
things we got the line and the passing
game, which will inevitably open up the
run game," Gaffney elaborated. "If we
can solidify the passing and the line
game, the run game should follow suit."
The run game was noticeably absent
on the final two plays from scrimmage
for Stanford against Utah. On subse
quent third and fourth downs with 2
yards to go, Shaw opted to throw the ball
instead of handing it off to Gaffney.
"Every good player wants the ball in
that situation," said Gaffney. "Hogan
would love to have the ball in that situa
tion. Ty would love to have the ball in
that situation. I feel the same way but it
is what it is. If we score it's the right call,
if we don't it's the wrong call. It could
have gone either way."

On the other side of the ball, the de
fensive line is still reeling from injuries
senior defensive end Henry Anderson
and sophomore defensive tackle Ikenna
Nwafor are sidelined for a few more
weeks, and senior defensive tackle David
Parry and fifth-year senior Ben Gardner
have been slowed down by abdominal
and arm injuries, respectively. To in
crease the depth on the line, defensive
coordinator Derek Mason requested that
sophomore Luke Kaumatule switch from
tight end to defensive end. Through
