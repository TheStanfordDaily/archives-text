# COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF
## RICE PLACED ON COMMITTEE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Former Secretary of State Con
doleezza Rice, a Stanford Graduate
School of Business professor and
senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, was officially named a mem
ber of the College Football Playoff
selection committee on Wednesday.
She later defended her spot in the
13-person group comprised oth
erwise of former coaches, football
administrators and sports journal
ists — in a Wednesday afternoon
teleconference.
The 13-member committee will
be tasked with determining the
four participants in the new playoff
system, which will replace the con
troversial BCS beginning with the
2014 season. Other members with

notable Stanford affiliations are
former coach Tyrone Willingham,
who led the Cardinal to the 2000
Rose Bowl and is now a volunteer
assistant coach for the Stanford
women's golf team, and West Vir
ginia athletic director Oliver Luck,
the father of quarterback Andrew
Luck 'l2.
Rice's inclusion in the selection
committee has come under fire
since it was reported by the Associ
ated Press on Oct. 4. Most notably,
ESPN analyst David Pollack said
on College Game Day that he
thought the committee members
should have played football or been
around the sport and should be
able to judge teams on tape, imply
ing that Rice was not qualified.
The former Stanford provost
addressed those concerns on

Wednesday, noting that she has not
only been a lifetime college football
fan she mentioned a 1966 game
between Michigan State and Notre
Dame twice during the teleconfer
ence but that she has also
served an important administra
tive role for Cardinal athletics.

"As provost at Stanford, athlet
ics reported to me for six years,"

Rice said. "So I understand the
game from the administrative side
too, facilities and compliance is
sues. I hired Ty Willingham when I
was provost, and indeed, all the
way back in 1988, served on the
committee that brought Denny
Green to Stanford as coach."

Condoleezza Rice (above) is the only female and only person on the
committee without formal football experience but will be valued for
her differing outlook and ability to make decisions under pressure.
Asked whether she was
leading the way for other
women in football Pol
lack's comments have been
interpreted by many as sex
ist— Rice downplayed her
role.
"I don't feel that I'm car
rying a banner for anyone,
except those of us who love
college football," she said.
"And by the way, that in
cludes a lot of women too."
Rice said that she was
originally approached by
Pac-12 Commissioner Larry
Scott about the position, and
that Big 12 Commissioner
Bob Bowlsby, Stanford's ath
letic director from 2006-12,
also convinced her to join the
committee.

"People thought that it
was important to have diver
sity of experience," Rice

said. "There's a reason that,
for instance, corporate
boards are not all CEOs. You
want people who have diver
sity of experience. Secondly,
they said we want people
who will make critical judg
ments and can do so under
pressure, and I think that's
going to describe this com
mittee.
"But they also said we
want people who love college
football, and I absolutely fit
into that category."
Rice's involvement with
Stanford football has outlived
her time as provost (1993-99).
As The Daily reported in
March, she often meets with
Cardinal recruits to intro
duce them to the Farm. Head
coach David Shaw has
praised her knowledge of the
game, and though Rice ad
mitted Wednesday that she is
"a student of the game," she
said she would review as
much game film as possible
to make the right decisions
another apparent re

sponse to Pollack's remarks.
Committee members, of
course, are expected to ex
cuse themselves from any
vote that relates to a school
they are affiliated with. Shaw
said on Tuesday that he was
n't expecting any help from
Rice and Willingham, any
way.
"If I was going to pack the
jury, I wouldn't pick them,
because they're going to be
unbelievably unbiased," Shaw
said. "I don't think you can
question their integrity.
They're going to do and fight
for what they believe is
right."
For Rice, that means two
things: ensuring the fairness
of the new playoff system and
safeguarding the student
athlete experience.
"It's a special thing to be a
student-athlete," she said,
"and I think we have to pro
tect that."
