# COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF
## RICE PLACED ON COMMITTEE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Former Secretary of State Con
doleezza Rice, a Stanford Graduate
School of Business professor and
senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, was officially named a mem
ber of the College Football Playoff
selection committee on Wednesday.
She later defended her spot in the
13-person group comprised oth
erwise of former coaches, football
administrators and sports journal
ists â€” in a Wednesday afternoon
teleconference.
The 13-member committee will
be tasked with determining the
four participants in the new playoff
system, which will replace the con
troversial BCS beginning with the
2014 season. Other members with

notable Stanford affiliations are
former coach Tyrone Willingham,
who led the Cardinal to the 2000
Rose Bowl and is now a volunteer
assistant coach for the Stanford
women's golf team, and West Vir
ginia athletic director Oliver Luck,
the father of quarterback Andrew
Luck 'l2.
Rice's inclusion in the selection
committee has come under fire
since it was reported by the Associ
ated Press on Oct. 4. Most notably,
ESPN analyst David Pollack said
on College Game Day that he
thought the committee members
should have played football or been
around the sport and should be
able to judge teams on tape, imply
ing that Rice was not qualified.
The former Stanford provost
addressed those concerns on

Wednesday, noting that she has not
only been a lifetime college football
fan she mentioned a 1966 game
between Michigan State and Notre
Dame twice during the teleconfer
ence but that she has also
served an important administra
tive role for Cardinal athletics.

"As provost at Stanford, athlet
ics reported to me for six years,"

Rice said. "So I understand the
game from the administrative side
too, facilities and compliance is
sues. I hired Ty Willingham when I
was provost, and indeed, all the
way back in 1988, served on the
committee that brought Denny
Green to Stanford as coach."

Condoleezza Rice (above) is the only female and only person on the
committee without formal football experience but will be valued for
her differing outlook and ability to make decisions under pressure.
