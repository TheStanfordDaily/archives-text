## Ready to break rare losing streak 
### FIONA NOONAN 
The No. 10 Stanford women's soccer
team (9-3-1, 2-3-0 Pac-12) goes up
against unranked Utah (7-2-5, 3-1-1)
Friday night in the final match of its
five-game homestead.
Not only will it attempt to restart the
team's historic success in a win against
the Utes, but also it will do so in front of
over 60 of the program's alumnae, who
will be honored in a halftime ceremony
as part of Homecoming Weekend.
The game comes in the wake of the
Cardinal's third consecutive home con
ference loss, the most recent of which
was a 1-0 defeat suffered against USC
(6-6-2,1-3-1) this past Sunday. The first
of those losses broke a six-year unde
feated streak at Cagan Stadium.
The Cardinal holds a 4-1 lead in the
all-time series against Utah, but will
need to be prepared for Utah's leading
scorer, junior midfielder Katie Taylor,
who scored the game-winning goal
against WSU Sunday for a 4-3 overtime
victory.
A victory for Stanford would prevent
extending the team's longest losing
streak since 2006, when it lost three
games from the end of the 2005 to the
beginning of the 2006 season.
Head coach Paul Rateliffe is looking
for "better play" against Utah. He em-
phasized maintaining posses
sion, increasing the offensive
attack, playing with energy
and scoring goals as keys to
success.
"I think this team's lack
ing a little bit of confidence,"
Ratcliffe said, "and if they get
a goal, then I think you could
see a different team."
In terms of the whole
team's mindset, senior de
fender and co-captain Kendall
Romine also talked about
confidence.
"[We are] trying to just
stay positive," Romine said.
"We're trying to reevaluate
and figure out what we can do
to come back and really make

a statement and show what
we're capable of doing."
Aside from scoring, the
team's primary concern this
week has been attention to
detail, according to Romine.
"A score doesn't always
dictate the performance of
the game," Romine said, "but
at the same time it's some
thing where the smallest little
detail can cause you to lose or
win a game."
If all goes well, this atten
tion to detail will result in
quality shots for the Cardinal.
Stanford certainly has more
than ample firepower up top
between junior forward Tay
lor Uhl, senior co-captain for
ward Courtney Verloo and
junior forward Chioma Ãœbo
gagu, who had several excel
lent scoring opportunities
against the Trojans.
Uhl, who didn't see much

playing time on Sunday, could
be critical to the offensive at
tack against Utah.
No matter what, the Car
dinal has high expectations to
fulfill in front of what is sure
to be a huge Homecoming
crowd. This match will be
critical for the team's overall
confidence before it begins a
long road trip and continues
to reevaluate.
"We have a lot of work to
do and, you know, we're going
to see their character now,"
Ratcliffe said. "They're true
champions, they're going to
work harder and keep im
proving and down the stretch
we'll get stronger."
The Cardinal will kick off
against the Utes on Friday at
7 p.m. at Cagan Stadium.
