# FIELD HOCKEY
## ROAD TRIP TO SOUTH ON DECK 
### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In their last meeting, No. 18 Stanford
women's field hockey upset No. 8 Wake
Forest 4-2 on Wake Forest's home turf. It
was the 2010-11 season; a season that took
the Cardinal all the way to a first-round
match in the NCAA tournament against
No. 2 North Carolina.
This season, though, the rankings sit
far closer and No. 13 Stanford will come in
to the game as more of an equal against
No. 14 Wake Forest than it did three years
ago.
Both teams are fairly young squads,
each with just four seniors who were pres
ent at the teams' last meeting. Wake For
est, carrying a freshmen class of nine, is
currently 8-5. However, the Demon Dea
cons boast a 6-2 record at home.
Stanford arrives in North Carolina
with a record of 10-3, but is 2-1 on the road.
Coming off a rebound week with two big
wins, Stanford approaches Friday's game
with momentum at its back. Armed with
what senior Hope Burke called "a new pas
sion for the rest of our regular season
games," Stanford looks to reclaim a top-10
slot in the rankings.

Well-rested and confident, according to
sophomore goalie Dulcie Davies, the Car-

senior Hope Burke make up the Cardinal's offensive
trio that will test Duke's stingy defense.
dinal will attempt to main
tain its shutout run. Outscor
ing its opponents by an aver
age of 3-1 this season and
earning penalty corners at
three times the rate, Stanford
will need a high powered of
fensive effort to combat a tal
ented Wake Forest defense.
Holding opponents to, on av
erage, less than two goals a
game, the Demon Deacon de
fense will have their hands
full with Burke, junior Kelsey
Harbin and junior Alex Mc-
Cawley Stanford's power
ful offensive trio.
Wake Forest has found
much of its success this sea
son outside conference play;
the Demon Deacons are win
less through four games in
the ACC. But with only one
game lost outside of confer
ence, Wake Forest poses a

tough match for the Card.
Following Friday's game
against Wake Forest is a
Sunday game at No. 7 Duke.
Duke has had a very promis
ing start to their season
boasting a 10-3 record to
match Stanford's. With sev
en goals thus far this season,
senior forward and midfield
er Emmie Le Marchand
leads the offensive threat of
the Blue Devils. Le Marc
hand represents an integral
part of the Duke attack. A
starter and leading goal scor
er since her freshmen sea
son, Le Marchand should
prove an excellent test for
Harbin of Stanford.
Harbin, who has been
stellar all season, has been a
key component in each of
Stanford's six shutouts this
year. Duke and Stanford last
went head to head in the
playoffs of the 2011-12 sea
son, with the fifth-ranked
Duke team defeating the
Cardinal 5-0. Stanford will
take the field Sunday looking

for revenge and a chance to
build momentum for a huge
home game next Friday
against Michigan.
Duke goalie Lauren Blaz
er has been stingy in the
cage, averaging just over one
goal against per game on av
erage. With Stanford's penal
ty corner conversion rate on
the rise, it will be interesting
to see the impact that has, as
Harbin will be looking to add
to her six goals, all on cor
ners, this season.
Stanford comes into a
tough atmosphere to play in.
Duke is 8-2 at home this year
and the Blue Devils always
draw large crowds. Sunday is
sure to be no exception as
both teams are jockeying for
single-digit rankings.
Friday's game at Wake
Forest is scheduled for 4 p.m.
PDT and Sunday's game at
Duke is scheduled for 9 a.m.
PDT.
