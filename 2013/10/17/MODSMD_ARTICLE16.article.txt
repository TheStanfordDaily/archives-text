## ROAD TRIP TO SOUTH ON DECK

In their last meeting, No. 18 Stanford
women's field hockey upset No. 8 Wake
Forest 4-2 on Wake Forest's home turf. It
was the 2010-11 season; a season that took
the Cardinal all the way to a first-round
match in the NCAA tournament against
No. 2 North Carolina.
This season, though, the rankings sit
far closer and No. 13 Stanford will come in
to the game as more of an equal against
No. 14 Wake Forest than it did three years
ago.
Both teams are fairly young squads,
each with just four seniors who were pres
ent at the teams' last meeting. Wake For
est, carrying a freshmen class of nine, is
currently 8-5. However, the Demon Dea
cons boast a 6-2 record at home.
Stanford arrives in North Carolina
with a record of 10-3, but is 2-1 on the road.
Coming off a rebound week with two big
wins, Stanford approaches Friday's game
with momentum at its back. Armed with
what senior Hope Burke called "a new pas
sion for the rest of our regular season
games," Stanford looks to reclaim a top-10
slot in the rankings.

sophomore goalie Dulcie Davies, the Car-

Junior Kelsey Hardin (above), junior Alex McCawley and
senior Hope Burke make up the Cardinal's offensive
trio that will test Duke's stingy defense.
