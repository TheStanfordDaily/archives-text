## Letter to the Editor 
### 
Dear Editor,
We'd like to clarify informa
tion in the Oct. 16 article
"ASSU Senate to vote on
bill overruling Board of Judicial Af
fairs (BJA) bylaw changes." The ar
ticle suggests there was no student
input into the bylaws of the BJA
and that the bylaws were imple
mented by the BJA when the Sen
ate was out of session. This isn't
true.
The Board on Judicial Affairs is
"a standing committee of students,
faculty and staff" created by the
Student Judicial Charter "to over
see all aspects of judicial affairs."
The Board has six voting student
members appointed by the ASSU
Nominations Commission. The BJA
has three powers: to adopt or modi
fy bylaws, to adopt and/or to modify
the Student Conduct Penalty Code
and to propose amendments to the
Charter.

During the 2012-13 academic
year, the BJA met 11 times. In fall
and winter quarters, the BJA
learned about the recently finalized
Internal Review Panel Report and
worked with the Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student
Council to make changes to the Al
ternate Review Process (ARP). Af
ter the revisions of the ARP were fi
nalized, the BJA turned to the Hon
or Code and formed subcommittees.
Work from the subcommittees
was forwarded by members as pro
posed bylaws. They were discussed
and passed at the meetings on May
21 and June 4. Per the Charter, the
co-chairs of the BJA "forward[ed]
the text of the changes to the chair
of the Undergraduate Senate of the
Associated Students of Stanford
University, the chair of the Gradu
ate Student Council of the Associat
ed Students of Stanford University,
the chair of the Senate of the Aca
demic Council and the President of
the University" (111.A.2.2). This
happened on June 11, and the
memo was from co-chairs Michele
Dauber and Jonathan York.
Members of the Office of Com
munity Standards (OCS), which is
separate from the BJA, met with
ASSU executives over the spring
and summer and shortly before the
start of classes to improve communi
cation between the ASSU and OCS.
On Sept. 25, Koren Bakkegard con
tacted ASSU leaders about the by
laws on behalf of the BJA.

Bakkegard reminded them of the
memo and wrote, "The Charter does
not specify a timeline for the entities
to exercise them authority to over
rule them, but it will be helpful for
the BJA and OCS to know sooner
rather than later if any might be
overruled." Bakkegard also sug
gested that the Undergraduate Sen
ate and GSC might talk with the two
student members of the 'l2- 'l3 BJA
who would be returning to the 'l3-
'l4 BJA "in the event you would like
to talk with student representatives
about the changes and rationale."

Discussions of the Honor Code,
Student Judicial Charter and judi
cial process are important, and they
should be informed by facts. As the
article correctly states, we asked to
attend the Undergraduate Senate
meeting Tuesday night to "focus on
establishing a better working rela
tionship between the ASSU and the
OCS." For that to happen, we need
to work with students in good faith
with accurate information.
In addition, since an Internal
Review Panel was convened in Fall
2010, OCS has engaged in a review
of the judicial process that included
student forums. The recommenda
tions from the 18-month review, as
well as some concerns from a case
study, provided information on
which to base procedural and admin
istrative changes. The case study in
formed some of the changes made,
and to characterize it as not relevant
is inaccurate. However, to focus on
the case study at this point given
our progress is not productive.

Dear Editor,
We'd like to clarify informa
tion in the Oct. 16 article
"ASSU Senate to vote on
bill overruling Board of Judicial Af
fairs (BJA) bylaw changes." The ar
ticle suggests there was no student
input into the bylaws of the BJA
and that the bylaws were imple
mented by the BJA when the Sen
ate was out of session. This isn't
true.
The Board on Judicial Affairs is
"a standing committee of students,
faculty and staff" created by the
Student Judicial Charter "to over
see all aspects of judicial affairs."
The Board has six voting student
members appointed by the ASSU
Nominations Commission. The BJA
has three powers: to adopt or modi
fy bylaws, to adopt and/or to modify
the Student Conduct Penalty Code
and to propose amendments to the
Charter.

During the 2012-13 academic
year, the BJA met 11 times. In fall
and winter quarters, the BJA
learned about the recently finalized
Internal Review Panel Report and
worked with the Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student
Council to make changes to the Al
ternate Review Process (ARP). Af
ter the revisions of the ARP were fi
nalized, the BJA turned to the Hon
or Code and formed subcommittees.
Work from the subcommittees
was forwarded by members as pro
posed bylaws. They were discussed
and passed at the meetings on May
21 and June 4. Per the Charter, the
co-chairs of the BJA "forward[ed]
the text of the changes to the chair
of the Undergraduate Senate of the
Associated Students of Stanford
University, the chair of the Gradu
ate Student Council of the Associat
ed Students of Stanford University,
the chair of the Senate of the Aca
demic Council and the President of
the University" (111.A.2.2). This
happened on June 11, and the
memo was from co-chairs Michele
Dauber and Jonathan York.
Members of the Office of Com
munity Standards (OCS), which is
separate from the BJA, met with
ASSU executives over the spring
and summer and shortly before the
start of classes to improve communi
cation between the ASSU and OCS.
On Sept. 25, Koren Bakkegard con
tacted ASSU leaders about the by
laws on behalf of the BJA.

Bakkegard reminded them of the
memo and wrote, "The Charter does
not specify a timeline for the entities
to exercise them authority to over
rule them, but it will be helpful for
the BJA and OCS to know sooner
rather than later if any might be
overruled." Bakkegard also sug
gested that the Undergraduate Sen
ate and GSC might talk with the two
student members of the 'l2- 'l3 BJA
who would be returning to the 'l3-
'l4 BJA "in the event you would like
to talk with student representatives
about the changes and rationale."
