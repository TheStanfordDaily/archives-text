## Enforce the Charter 
### 
As a presiding administrative
law judge of the California
Unemployment Insurance
Appeals Board, I devote a great
deal of time to ensuring due process
is observed by the 25 judges I su
pervise in our administrative hear
ings. Moreover, as a former deputy
federal public defender and crimi
nal defense lawyer, I have dealt
with due process at an even higher
level of scrutiny.
In 1997, Stanford students and
faculty enacted the 1997 Student
Judicial Charter. This document
strictly defines the handling of all
judicial cases at Stanford. I was a
co-author, along with three stu
dents, of an extensive case study
that followed a single Honor Code
violation through the Stanford judi
cial process from start to finish at
the Office of Community Stan
dards.
That case study, discussed by The
Stanford Daily on May 13, came to
one principal conclusion the Of

fice of Community Standards was
failing to process judicial actions at
Stanford in conformance with the
1997 Student Judicial Charter.
When I assisted in the represen
tation of students accused of Honor
Code violations at Stanford, I was
appalled by the lack of due process
afforded them. Some of the most
basic due process protections were
discouraged or outright denied.
Students were advised that they
should not only desist from contact
ing witnesses but they were denied
the opportunity to question their
own witnesses in the proceeding.
They were denied the opportunity
to confront their accuser. They were
discouraged from objecting to the
testimony against them and from
cross-examining those witnesses.
New issues were raised at the hear
ing that were not part of the scope
of the accusation and for which no
notice had been given.
Overall, the hearing evidenced a
lack of impartiality and a lack of un
derstanding of the most basic legal
concepts that ensure a fair proceed
ing. No one involved in the day-to
day doings at the Office of Commu
nity Standards had a legal back
ground or an apparent familiarity
with elements of procedural due
process.
The students outlined just some
of the violations of the Student Ju
dicial Charter in their letter to The
Daily on May 22, 2013.
Our students had representa
tives to advise them even though
the representatives were not al
lowed to appear or participate in
the actual proceeding. I cannot
imagine how unrepresented stu
dents would be able to navigate
such a process at all, let alone suc
cessfully.
Under the 1997 Student Judicial
Charter, every student is entitled to
be represented while going through
the process. Yet, many students who
have come forward to us since The

Daily's article on the case study in
May have suggested they are either
intimidated from retaining an attor
ney, or are led to believe it would be
in their best interests not to.
Further, it has become apparent
that those who are not represented
face an entirely different experi
ence from those who have compe
tent counsel who can protect their
rights in every step of the process.
This is happening now, in cases re
solved or commenced in the spring
of 2013.
I want to be clear on the issue
that now confronts all of us at Stan
ford. It is not about changing the
1997 Student Judicial Charter. The
Office of Community Standards has
already done that.
The issue is going back to the
1997 Student Judicial Charter, and
enforcing it strictly. It was designed
to protect students, and that protec
tion needs to be restored. Recent
practices demonstrate what can
happen when the Charter is ig
nored.
As a Stanford graduate who is
proud of the excellence of most all
that Stanford does, I was deeply
disturbed by this lack of profession
alism and fairness at the Office of
Community Standards. In his letter
from the Birmingham Jail in April
1963, Martin Luther King said, "An
injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere."
Dr. King's cautionary words
ring just as true today, 50 years lat
er. It is incumbent on those of us
who care about Stanford and its
continuing excellence that we take
steps to prevent the miscarriage of
justice that will surely come from
the continuation of such a flawed ju
dicial process at Stanford.
