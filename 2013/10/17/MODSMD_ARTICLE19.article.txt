# You Do Deserve to Be Here
## 
### Gustavo Empinotti 
The latest viral Facebook post
among Stanford students is a
blow to the head for not only
the incoming freshmen but all of us
who, in one definition or another,
have in some way been the benefici
aries of privilege. "You don't de
serve to be here" was Kevin
Carey's conclusion after attending
the freshman convocation a few
weeks ago.
Having bumped into one too
many BMWs on Palm Drive, Carey
was convinced the acceptance let
ter was not earned. After all, it is a
known fact that if you throw
enough luxury items on a baby (and
you, freshmen, have all been there),
he or she will eventually become a
NASA scientist.
While Carey seems to ignore
that some students were not born
in silken diapers, his arguments are
flawed even when targeted at the
students from wealthy households.
It is certainly true that if the
tortoise and the hare reach the fin
ish line at the same time, the tor
toise is the worthy of greater admi
ration; but denying merit from our
well-born students is eating the
cake and having it too.
Their relative advantage is al
ready taken into consideration in
the admission process. At an ac
ceptance rate of 5.7 percent, the
golden cradle babies still had to
beat all their equally privileged
classmates. They had to be compar
atively, not absolutely, impressive.
Stanford students are remarkable
even when their starting point is
taken into account.
Sure, financial aid is limited and
does not provide for complete
equality. I wish it were different.
What I cannot accept is denying
any merit whatsoever to those that
were involuntarily born in a
wealthy family, and suggesting
they have a larger moral obligation
to give back to others.
It is as if they were presented
with Christ's last temptation at the
exit of the womb: you can have this
kingdom, but you must forfeit your
own dreams and instead fix all these
problems that you didn't create.
Of course, I am not condoning
lack of consideration for others'

less fortunate conditions. There are
ways to soften inequality without
yielding to a misplaced guilt. We
can ameliorate societal inequalities
by, for example, agreeing to pay
higher taxes in order to improve
medical conditions for the not-so
lucky (hi, Tea Party!). On the other
hand, forcing the elite into a path
of self-denial is revoking any of
their personal inclinations or de
sires for the arbitrary fact of their
privilege.
At the cost of sounding preten
tious (aren't we all at Stanford?), I
cite a favorite passage from Kant:
"[... T]here arises in many per
sons, if only they are candid enough
to admit it, a certain degree of mis
ology, hatred of reason. This is par
ticularly the case with those who
are most experienced in its use. Af
ter counting all the advantages [...],
they nevertheless find that they
have actually brought more trouble
on their shoulders instead of gain
ing in happiness; they finally envy,
rather than despise, the common
run of men who are better guided
by mere natural instinct on their
conduct."
Haven't we all raised our head
from our problem sets and be
grudged that lonely cat sunbathing
on the lawn outside the window,
void of responsibilities?
Kant speaks of the burden of
knowledge, not wealth, which rais
es another problem: in Carey's
eyes, we will only deserve what we
so far haven't when we finally come
back and share our service with our
children and peers.
Some of us, however, will not
and should not follow that path. In
addition to providing excellent op
portunities for service, Stanford al
so amasses some of the greatest
minds in the world who are con
cerned with highly theoretical and
intangible problems. They think
about questions never before re
solved, in any civilization.
While service to others is val
ued, Stanford also accepts some
youngsters that achieved success
by serving themselves. They
served themselves so much that
they became the best at something
highly irrelevant for most of the

world, yet vital for their personal
satisfaction. And they are so
uniquely good that they really
should be investing all their time on
themselves and their vain pursuits.
Service is not the only road to
merit, and being born in a pot of
gold does not render one's achieve
ments infinitely worthless, espe
cially if those achievements are not
at the expense of others. The way
to bridge the opportunity gap is not
to diminish the top, but rather to
empower the bottom.

Service is not the only road to
merit, and being born in a pot of
gold does not render one's achieve
ments infinitely worthless, espe
cially if those achievements are not
at the expense of others. The way
to bridge the opportunity gap is not
to diminish the top, but rather to
empower the bottom.

The latest viral Facebook post
among Stanford students is a
blow to the head for not only
the incoming freshmen but all of us
who, in one definition or another,
have in some way been the benefici
aries of privilege. "You don't de
serve to be here" was Kevin
Carey's conclusion after attending
the freshman convocation a few
weeks ago.
Having bumped into one too
many BMWs on Palm Drive, Carey
was convinced the acceptance let
ter was not earned. After all, it is a
known fact that if you throw
enough luxury items on a baby (and
you, freshmen, have all been there),
he or she will eventually become a
NASA scientist.
While Carey seems to ignore
that some students were not born
in silken diapers, his arguments are
flawed even when targeted at the
students from wealthy households.
It is certainly true that if the
tortoise and the hare reach the fin
ish line at the same time, the tor
toise is the worthy of greater admi
ration; but denying merit from our
well-born students is eating the
cake and having it too.
Their relative advantage is al
ready taken into consideration in
the admission process. At an ac
ceptance rate of 5.7 percent, the
golden cradle babies still had to
beat all their equally privileged
classmates. They had to be compar
atively, not absolutely, impressive.
Stanford students are remarkable
even when their starting point is
taken into account.
Sure, financial aid is limited and
does not provide for complete
equality. I wish it were different.
What I cannot accept is denying
any merit whatsoever to those that
were involuntarily born in a
wealthy family, and suggesting
they have a larger moral obligation
to give back to others.
It is as if they were presented
with Christ's last temptation at the
exit of the womb: you can have this
kingdom, but you must forfeit your
own dreams and instead fix all these
problems that you didn't create.
Of course, I am not condoning
lack of consideration for others'

less fortunate conditions. There are
ways to soften inequality without
yielding to a misplaced guilt. We
can ameliorate societal inequalities
by, for example, agreeing to pay
higher taxes in order to improve
medical conditions for the not-so
lucky (hi, Tea Party!). On the other
hand, forcing the elite into a path
of self-denial is revoking any of
their personal inclinations or de
sires for the arbitrary fact of their
privilege.
At the cost of sounding preten
tious (aren't we all at Stanford?), I
cite a favorite passage from Kant:
"[... T]here arises in many per
sons, if only they are candid enough
to admit it, a certain degree of mis
ology, hatred of reason. This is par
ticularly the case with those who
are most experienced in its use. Af
ter counting all the advantages [...],
they nevertheless find that they
have actually brought more trouble
on their shoulders instead of gain
ing in happiness; they finally envy,
rather than despise, the common
run of men who are better guided
by mere natural instinct on their
conduct."
Haven't we all raised our head
from our problem sets and be
grudged that lonely cat sunbathing
on the lawn outside the window,
void of responsibilities?
Kant speaks of the burden of
knowledge, not wealth, which rais
es another problem: in Carey's
eyes, we will only deserve what we
so far haven't when we finally come
back and share our service with our
children and peers.
Some of us, however, will not
and should not follow that path. In
addition to providing excellent op
portunities for service, Stanford al
so amasses some of the greatest
minds in the world who are con
cerned with highly theoretical and
intangible problems. They think
about questions never before re
solved, in any civilization.
While service to others is val
ued, Stanford also accepts some
youngsters that achieved success
by serving themselves. They
served themselves so much that
they became the best at something
highly irrelevant for most of the

world, yet vital for their personal
satisfaction. And they are so
uniquely good that they really
should be investing all their time on
themselves and their vain pursuits.
Service is not the only road to
merit, and being born in a pot of
gold does not render one's achieve
ments infinitely worthless, espe
cially if those achievements are not
