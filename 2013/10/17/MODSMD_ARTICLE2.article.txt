# PA housing proposal to be voted on Nov. 5
## 
### SAM KURLAND 
A controversial project that
would provide 60 low-income housing
units for seniors and 12 new single
family market-rate homes in Palo Al
to will come to a head in the city's up
coming general election on Nov. 5.
Earlier this year, the private non
profit Palo Alto Housing Corpora
tion, which manages 20 affordable
housing properties throughout the
city, proposed the construction proj
ect at 567-595 Maybell Avenue.
Because existing zoning regula
tions for the property did not permit
development at that density, the non
profit petitioned the City Council to
designate the site as a planned com
munity zone.
"The existing zoning would allow
us to maximize 46 senior units, but it
would not be a financially feasible
project for low-income senior hous
ing," said Candice Gonzalez, execu
tive director of the Palo Alto Housing
Corporation. "The land is pretty ex
pensive. We wouldn't be competitive
in all of our funding applications be
cause the cost per unit would be in
sane."
The city council unanimously ap
proved the rezoning petition in June.
Dissatisfied with the rezoning de
cision, a group of Palo Alto residents
formed a campaign committee, called
Palo Altans to Preserve Neighbor
hood Zoning, to oppose the new proj
ect. The group prepared petitions for
a referendum on the council's deci

sion to allow the rezoning.
"We needed 2,300 signatures on
these petitions, and we got over
4,000," said Joseph Hirsch, a mem
ber of the Palo Altans to Preserve
Neighborhood Zoning leadership
team.
Because the group's petition for a
referendum on the decision succeed
ed, the rezoning question will appear
before Palo Alto voters as Measure D

on the general election ballot in No
vember.
"I think the high density rezoning
of Maybell is wrong," Hirsch said.
"The traffic was not properly stud
ied. The building is higher than it
should be for the senior housing, and
as much as anything else, the num
ber of single-family homes... are just
totally out of character with their
surrounding single-family neighbor

hood. The lots are very small."
Hirsch, a former planning com
missioner, explained that the pro
posed single-family lots are approxi
mately 58 percent of the typical size
of single-family residential lots in Pa
lo Alto. "Housing that size in our
neighborhood I just find [it] inap
propriate," he said.
Gonzalez presented a different
view.

"It's not a single-family neighbor
hood, as the opposition [to Measure
D] seems to think," she said. "It's sin
gle-family on one side.'
Measure D has been endorsed by
Palo Alto Mayor Greg Scharff, Vice
Mayor Nancy Shepherd and all sev
en City Council members.
"We are really fighting an uphill
battle against City Hall and against
Palo Alto Housing Corporation,
which has pulled out all the stops,"
Hirsch said.
According to Gonzalez, Palo Alto
has only one site dedicated to seniors
and the disabled, the 57-unit Sheri
dan Apartments.
"We have about 500 people on
that waiting list, and it takes about
five years to get off the wait list,"
Gonzalez said.
If Measure D passes, construc
tion of the housing project is sched
uled to begin in spring 2014 and is ex
pected to last for one year.
According to Palo Alto Housing
Corporation Board Member Jean
McCown '56, the corporation has ap
plied for and received financial sup
port from the Santa Clara County af
fordable housing fund, to which Stan
ford contributes taxes levied on its
new developments on campus.
The University plays no role in al
locating the affordable housing funds
and has no other connection to the
proposed housing project.

Palo Alto Mayor Greg Scharff, Vice
Mayor Nancy Shepherd and all sev

"We are really fighting an uphill
battle against City Hall and against
Palo Alto Housing Corporation,
which has pulled out all the stops,"
Hirsch said.
According to Gonzalez, Palo Alto
has only one site dedicated to seniors
and the disabled, the 57-unit Sheri

"We have about 500 people on
that waiting list, and it takes about
five years to get off the wait list,"
Gonzalez said.
If Measure D passes, construc

According to Palo Alto Housing
Corporation Board Member Jean
McCown '56, the corporation has ap
plied for and received financial sup
port from the Santa Clara County af
fordable housing fund, to which Stan
ford contributes taxes levied on its
new developments on campus.
The University plays no role in al
locating the affordable housing funds
and has no other connection to the
proposed housing project.

On Nov. 5, Palo Alto residents will vote on a controversial proposal by the Palo Alto Housing Corporation
that will provide low-income housing for seniors and single-family homes at 567-595 Maybell Avenue.
A controversial project that
would provide 60 low-income housing
units for seniors and 12 new single
family market-rate homes in Palo Al
to will come to a head in the city's up
coming general election on Nov. 5.
Earlier this year, the private non
profit Palo Alto Housing Corpora
tion, which manages 20 affordable
housing properties throughout the
city, proposed the construction proj
ect at 567-595 Maybell Avenue.
Because existing zoning regula
tions for the property did not permit
development at that density, the non
profit petitioned the City Council to
designate the site as a planned com
munity zone.
"The existing zoning would allow
us to maximize 46 senior units, but it
would not be a financially feasible
project for low-income senior hous
ing," said Candice Gonzalez, execu
tive director of the Palo Alto Housing
Corporation. "The land is pretty ex
pensive. We wouldn't be competitive
in all of our funding applications be
cause the cost per unit would be in
sane."
The city council unanimously ap
proved the rezoning petition in June.
Dissatisfied with the rezoning de
cision, a group of Palo Alto residents
formed a campaign committee, called
Palo Altans to Preserve Neighbor
hood Zoning, to oppose the new proj
ect. The group prepared petitions for
a referendum on the council's deci

sion to allow the rezoning.
"We needed 2,300 signatures on
these petitions, and we got over
4,000," said Joseph Hirsch, a mem
ber of the Palo Altans to Preserve
Neighborhood Zoning leadership
team.
Because the group's petition for a
referendum on the decision succeed
ed, the rezoning question will appear
before Palo Alto voters as Measure D

on the general election ballot in No
vember.
"I think the high density rezoning
of Maybell is wrong," Hirsch said.
"The traffic was not properly stud
ied. The building is higher than it
should be for the senior housing, and
as much as anything else, the num
ber of single-family homes... are just
totally out of character with their
surrounding single-family neighbor

hood. The lots are very small."
Hirsch, a former planning com
missioner, explained that the pro
posed single-family lots are approxi
mately 58 percent of the typical size
of single-family residential lots in Pa
lo Alto. "Housing that size in our
neighborhood I just find [it] inap
propriate," he said.
Gonzalez presented a different
view.

"It's not a single-family neighbor
hood, as the opposition [to Measure
D] seems to think," she said. "It's sin
gle-family on one side.'
Measure D has been endorsed by
Palo Alto Mayor Greg Scharff, Vice
Mayor Nancy Shepherd and all sev
en City Council members.
"We are really fighting an uphill
battle against City Hall and against
