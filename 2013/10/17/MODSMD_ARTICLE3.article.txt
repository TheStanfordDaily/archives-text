# Q&A
## WILLIAM NEWSOME PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND DIRECTOR OF BIO-X NEURO VENTURES 
### MINKEE SOHN 
William Newsome, a professor
of neurobiology and director of
Bio-X NeuroVentures, began di
recting a new interdisciplinary
neuroscience institute last spring.
The Daily sat down with Newsome
to discuss his experience as direc
tor thus far and his new fundrais
ing and expansion goals for the in
stitute.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can
you describe the overarching pur
pose of the institute?
William Newsome (WN): The
overarching purpose is to create a

campus-wide community of schol
arship in the neurosciences. We
want to further basic discovery
about the brain and how the brain
makes our mental lives possible.
We want to use that basic discov
ery to enhance human health in
medicine and also to enhance hu
man education and to apply knowl
edge in law and business and the
social sciences. We feel the social
sciences and the professional
schools have much to offer for neu
roscience, and that any science
that deals with human behavior
sets out phenomena that we want
to understand from the point of
view of the brain.

TSD: What are your duties as di
rector of the institute?
WN: As the director, I have a duty
to sort of increase the neuroscience
activity on three strategic inter
faces. One interface is with engi
neering, mathematics, physics and
quantitative sciences. Another big

strategic interface is for chemical
biology and with molecular and cell
biology and with chemistry. A third
key strategic interface is the social
sciences and the school of law, the
school of education and the school

So what I, as director, am do
ing is trying to create new rela
tionships and new collaborative
research projects across these in
terfaces. We're trying to engage
in fundraising so that we can have
seed grants for collaborative re
search projects that involve both
neuroscientists and collaborators
in one of these three strategic in
terfaces, and try to start interdis
ciplinary research projects be
tween people that might not nor
mally ever work together. And we
believe that by doing that, we'll
bring people together who will
ask questions about the brain and
behavior that have never been
asked before. And so I'm all
about catalyzing those relation
ships.
So I've got a big job here to
do. I've got fundraising to do,
I've got community building to
do, and I've got leadership in

trying to start all of these pro
grams that we'd like to start.
TSD: How have you seen the
collaborative nature of the insti
tute panning out? Can you give
a specific example of collabora
tion in the institute between
members of different depart
ments?
WN: One example I can give
you is a collaboration between
Professor Krishna Shenoy, who
is in the department of electri
cal engineering, and Professor
Jaimie Henderson, who is in the
department of neurosurgery.
Henderson and Shenoy have
started major collaboration that
seeks to take new discoveries
out of engineering and basic
neuroscience and use those new
discoveries to treat people with
motor disease more effectively.
They have recently implant
ed their first electro-chip in a
human patient who is paralyzed.
This electro-chip grabs signals
out of the human motor cortex
and sends those signals to an
external computer. This exter
nal computer decodes the move

ment that the patient has been
thinking about and then uses
that decoded signal to guide the
cursor on a screen. So the per
son, even though they're mostly
paralyzed, can use that cursor
to open e-mail, answer e-mail,
compose messages and draw lit
tle things, just by thinking
about what they want to do. And
this is a really dramatic exam
ple of the novel kinds of things
that can happen when Stanford
faculty reaches across disci
plines and really work creative
ly to use basic neuroscience to
address real-world, practical
problems.
TSD: How do you see the future
of the institute? What are the
next steps you believe should be
taken?
WN: We have quite a few specif
ic plans. The University presi
dent and provost have estab
lished as a goal that we will raise
$175 million to start new cam
pus-wide programs in neuro
science. We will hire 10 faculty
[members] over the next seven
years, and we will build a new

building that will house the new
neuroscience institute and the
new chemical biology institute.

What we want to do at the in
stitute level is simply set some
general guidelines and some
general directions. But what we
really want to do is enable the
faculty and students to pursue
their greatest and most creative
dreams. We all want to do
things that will teach us really
deep things about where the hu
man mind comes from, where
thought comes from, where cre
ativity comes from. Everywhere
you look there are mysteries
about the brain. We want to cat
alyze really excellent research
that addresses these mysteries.
The institute is motivated by fun
damental research and curiosity,
but with the conviction that it's
going to have broad impact all
over the University and through
out society.

William Newsome, a professor
of neurobiology and director of
Bio-X NeuroVentures, began di
recting a new interdisciplinary
neuroscience institute last spring.
The Daily sat down with Newsome
to discuss his experience as direc
tor thus far and his new fundrais
ing and expansion goals for the in
stitute.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can
you describe the overarching pur
pose of the institute?
William Newsome (WN): The
overarching purpose is to create a

campus-wide community of schol
arship in the neurosciences. We
want to further basic discovery
about the brain and how the brain
makes our mental lives possible.
We want to use that basic discov
ery to enhance human health in
medicine and also to enhance hu
man education and to apply knowl
edge in law and business and the
social sciences. We feel the social
sciences and the professional
schools have much to offer for neu
roscience, and that any science
that deals with human behavior
sets out phenomena that we want
to understand from the point of
view of the brain.

TSD: What are your duties as di
rector of the institute?
WN: As the director, I have a duty
to sort of increase the neuroscience
activity on three strategic inter
faces. One interface is with engi
neering, mathematics, physics and
quantitative sciences. Another big

strategic interface is for chemical
biology and with molecular and cell
biology and with chemistry. A third
key strategic interface is the social
sciences and the school of law, the
school of education and the school

So what I, as director, am do
ing is trying to create new rela
tionships and new collaborative
research projects across these in
terfaces. We're trying to engage
in fundraising so that we can have
seed grants for collaborative re
search projects that involve both
neuroscientists and collaborators
in one of these three strategic in
terfaces, and try to start interdis
ciplinary research projects be
tween people that might not nor
mally ever work together. And we
believe that by doing that, we'll
bring people together who will
ask questions about the brain and
behavior that have never been
asked before. And so I'm all
about catalyzing those relation
ships.
So I've got a big job here to
do. I've got fundraising to do,
I've got community building to
do, and I've got leadership in

trying to start all of these pro
grams that we'd like to start.
TSD: How have you seen the
collaborative nature of the insti
tute panning out? Can you give
a specific example of collabora
tion in the institute between
members of different depart
ments?
WN: One example I can give
you is a collaboration between
Professor Krishna Shenoy, who
is in the department of electri
cal engineering, and Professor
Jaimie Henderson, who is in the
department of neurosurgery.
Henderson and Shenoy have
started major collaboration that
seeks to take new discoveries
out of engineering and basic
neuroscience and use those new
discoveries to treat people with
motor disease more effectively.
They have recently implant
ed their first electro-chip in a
human patient who is paralyzed.
This electro-chip grabs signals
out of the human motor cortex
and sends those signals to an
external computer. This exter
nal computer decodes the move

ment that the patient has been
thinking about and then uses
that decoded signal to guide the
cursor on a screen. So the per
son, even though they're mostly
paralyzed, can use that cursor
to open e-mail, answer e-mail,
compose messages and draw lit
tle things, just by thinking
about what they want to do. And
this is a really dramatic exam
ple of the novel kinds of things
that can happen when Stanford
faculty reaches across disci
plines and really work creative
ly to use basic neuroscience to
address real-world, practical
problems.
TSD: How do you see the future
of the institute? What are the
next steps you believe should be
taken?
WN: We have quite a few specif
ic plans. The University presi
dent and provost have estab
lished as a goal that we will raise
$175 million to start new cam
pus-wide programs in neuro
science. We will hire 10 faculty
[members] over the next seven
years, and we will build a new

building that will house the new
neuroscience institute and the
new chemical biology institute.

What we want to do at the in
stitute level is simply set some
general guidelines and some
general directions. But what we
really want to do is enable the
faculty and students to pursue
their greatest and most creative
dreams. We all want to do
things that will teach us really
deep things about where the hu
man mind comes from, where
thought comes from, where cre
ativity comes from. Everywhere
you look there are mysteries
about the brain. We want to cat
alyze really excellent research
that addresses these mysteries.
The institute is motivated by fun
damental research and curiosity,
but with the conviction that it's
going to have broad impact all
over the University and through
out society.
