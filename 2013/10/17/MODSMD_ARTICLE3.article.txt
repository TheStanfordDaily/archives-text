# Q&A
## WILLIAM NEWSOME PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND DIRECTOR OF BIO-X NEURO VENTURES 
### MINKEE SOHN 
William Newsome, a professor
of neurobiology and director of
Bio-X NeuroVentures, began di
recting a new interdisciplinary
neuroscience institute last spring.
The Daily sat down with Newsome
to discuss his experience as direc
tor thus far and his new fundrais
ing and expansion goals for the in
stitute.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can
you describe the overarching pur
pose of the institute?
William Newsome (WN): The
overarching purpose is to create a

campus-wide community of schol
arship in the neurosciences. We
want to further basic discovery
about the brain and how the brain
makes our mental lives possible.
We want to use that basic discov
ery to enhance human health in
medicine and also to enhance hu
man education and to apply knowl
edge in law and business and the
social sciences. We feel the social
sciences and the professional
schools have much to offer for neu
roscience, and that any science
that deals with human behavior
sets out phenomena that we want
to understand from the point of
view of the brain.

TSD: What are your duties as di
rector of the institute?
WN: As the director, I have a duty
to sort of increase the neuroscience
activity on three strategic inter
faces. One interface is with engi
neering, mathematics, physics and
quantitative sciences. Another big

strategic interface is for chemical
biology and with molecular and cell
biology and with chemistry. A third
key strategic interface is the social
sciences and the school of law, the
school of education and the school
