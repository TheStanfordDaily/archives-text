## Race focus misplaced on Latinos Mexican immigration to U.S. in decline, researchers say 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford experts affirm that,
despite its portrayal in the U.S. me
dia as a Latino or even Mexican
issue, undocumented immigra
tion in the U.S. affects a diverse set
of nationalities and that in fact,
Mexican migration to the States is
on the decline.
According to Leo Chavez AM.'76
Ph.D. 'B2, who is currently a profes
sor of Anthropology at UC-Irvine,
there are 1.2 million Asian and
300,000 Eastern European unau
thorized immigrants living in the
United States.
He added that although 40 per
cent of undocumented immigra
tion comes from elsewhere, exten
sive media focus on detentions and
the arrest of unauthorized Mexican
immigrants by border patrol
have transformed Mexico into
the iconic nationality for all types
of unauthorized migration to the
United States.
"Obviously these detention
rates are skewed because they
target the Mexican flow across
the border," Chavez said. "Other
groups might be able to get in
more easily because they aren't
so visibly recognized or seen as
undocumented."
Stanford Assistant Professor
of Sociology Tomas Jimenez,
whose research has focused on
immigration, social mobility and
assimilation, noted the stigma
that even Latino families who
have been legally situated in the
United States for generations
must face due to this widespread
perception.

Chavez calls this dominating
association of illegal immigration
a "historically constructed set of
ideas" influenced by the Immi
gration Act of 1924.
To further demonstrate a
broader ethnic voice, current de
mands for immigration reform
come from a variety of nationali
ties, including both Latino and
Asian populations.
Katherine Nasol 'l5, member
of the Pilipino-American Student
Union (PASU) on campus and an
attendee at the 4th International
Assembly of Migrants and
Refugees in New York City, per
sonally advocates for this reform.
Despite the stigma surround
ing legal status among the Fil
ipino-American population, she
stressed Stanford's collective re
sponsibility to reach out to these
individuals.
"Our campus needs to move
forward, listen to the stories of
those affected and connect how
the status of these students are
affected by larger systemic prob

lems such as forced migration
and racial discrimination in our
current legal system," Nasol
said. "Media and social attention
is just one of the many tools we
can use to shed light on these un
heard stories."
While movements like those

of the DREAMers and Revolu
tionizing Asian American Immi
grant Stories (RAISE) work to
ward immigration reform, both
Jimenez and Chavez said Mexi
can immigration to the United
States is declining in general.
A variety of factors, including
American hostilities toward
unauthorized immigrants and an
improving Mexican economy,
have reduced the flow of Mexi
cans to the United States and in
creased the number of those who
are moving back to Mexico.
"Given the historical immi
gration from Mexico and our still
large dependence on Mexican la
bor and that from other Latin
American countries, I imagine
that these countries will remain
dominant in proportion to the
overall unauthorized immigrant
population, but I can definitely
see it decline in that dominance,"
Jimenez said.
