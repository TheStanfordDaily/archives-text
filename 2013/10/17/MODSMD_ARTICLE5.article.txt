# LOOKINS AHEAD
## AFTER LOSS, CARD IS EAGER TO MOVE ON 
### JOSEPH BAYDA SAM FISHER 
Every Monday, after 9[
Stanford football fin- sfSjf
ishes watching the
film from its game two days ear
lier, quarterback coach Mike
Sanford collects his game plans, notes and
play diagrams from the previous week and
files them away, literally closing the books
on the Cardinal's last opponent.
That moment couldn't come too soon
this week, as Stanford tried to shake off a
stunning loss to unranked Utah in Salt
Lake City that severely dampened —if
not completely ended the Cardinal's na
tional title aspirations.
Few losses in recent memory have

changed the outside rhetoric
surrounding Stanford foot
ball so drastically. The Car
dinal, ranked as high as No.
2 in the preseason by some
publications, fell out of the
top 10 entirely, having seem
ingly strayed from its identi
ty at the worst possible
time: just as it entered a
daunting home stretch that
includes conference con
tenders No. 9 UCLA and
No. 2 Oregon.
Though Stanford's coach
es preach mental toughness,
it's hard for the players to
move on immediately. More
over, the Cardinal's last four
losses have all come on the
road or in a bowl game, so
the team's veterans have ex
perienced several tough
plane flights over their ca
reers.

"Usually, on the flight
home you're still feeling real
bad," said senior left guard
David Yankey. "The game
literally just happened... Af
ter a loss, you usually don't
get much sleep."
The players have access
to game film on their team
issued iPads by the time
they board their flight,
though Yankey admits that
he doesn't like to watch it
right away after a loss. He
says that the emotional heal
ing really begins when the
physical healing does, as
players come in to stretch,
lift and work out any sore
ness the day after the game.
The mental step usually
comes on Monday, when the
players sit down in front of a
projector screen with their
coaches for the first time.

"The closure happens af
ter we watch that full film
with the players, make all
the corrections," Sanford
said. "And that's win or lose.
Because sometimes you're
still on the euphoria of a vic
tory, and you have to move

on from that."
But even after the team
has supposedly turned the
page, the previous week
end's emotions sometimes
spill over into practice. Head
coach David Shaw noted
Tuesday that some of the
players namely, Yankey
and his fellow captains
had an "edge" to them in
practice, adding that he'd ex
pect nothing less after a loss.
"These first two days [of
practice], I don't know if I've
seen our team since I've
been playing —so focused
and ready to go," said junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan.
"We know we can't sulk; we
can't waste a minute reflect
ing on last week. We've
moved on completely."
The Cardinal is hoping
the loss becomes a turning
point, much like its overtime
defeat at No. 7 Notre Dame
did last season.

After that loss, the team's
three captains had called a
players' meeting a regu
lar occurrence during the
early years of the program's
rise, but the first of its kind
during Shaw's tenure and
challenged the team to keep
fighting despite the 4-2
start. That's exactly what
Stanford did, finishing the
season with an eight-game
winning streak that included
wins against both the Ducks
and the Bruins.
"The work ethic looks ex
actly similar to after we suf
fered that defeat to Notre
Dame," said sophomore wide
receiver Kodi Whitfield.
"Guys are just ready to
work. They're hungry
again."
So, despite outside per
ception, it's not quite panic
time for the No. 13 Cardinal,
which still enters this week
end's homecoming show
down against No. 9 UCLA
as a six-point favorite.
"We have a process that
we really trust in and believe
in, and this process has led
to a lot of wins," Yankey said.
"Every now and then, when
you don't get the job done,

it's really tough and you
want to blame things. But
you just go back to the de
tails, look at what you did
wrong, you see all the cor
rectable mistakes and we've
got to take care of that. And
we will."
"Sometimes," Whitfield
noted, "you need to taste
your own blood a bit to get
back to work."
