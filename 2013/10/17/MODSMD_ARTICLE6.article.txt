## Stanford Nomz set to launch Sophomore's website to offer local restaurant reviews 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
Angela Sy 'l6 will launch a new
website tomorrow called Stanford
Nomz where students can share,
rate and review their favorite local
restaurants.
The site originated as Sy's final
project for the spring freshman In
troductory Seminar CS73N: The
Business of the Internet, which, ac
cording to Shirley Tessler M.S. '96
co-instructor of the course and co
principal of Aldo Ventures, Inc. with
Avron Ban* M.S. 'Bl attracts an
average of 100 applications each
year for about 16 spots.
Students in the seminar are re
quired to build a substantial website
as a final project applying the les
sons they learn about wilting for the
web.
Sy said that the class's combined
focus on technology and entrepre-

neurship spoke to
her interests and
granted access to
mentorship fi-om in
structors like Tfessler
and Gio Wieder
hold, emeritus pro
fessor of computer
science, medicine
and electrical engi-

neering who worked as a program
manager at the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA),
the originator of the Internet.
"The instructors asked each of us
to come up with a business plan for
our site," Sy said. "We looked a lot at
user interaction for example, how
the interface works and how does
that appeal to the audience."
Sy's inspiration for Stanford
Nomz came from a practical prob
lem she faced as a freshman. With
limited access to transportation and
knowledge of the area not to men
tion a passion for food Sy wanted
to create one resource where stu
dents could share information about
top restaurants to dine in.
"The whole idea behind Stanford
Nomz is that it's not like a food blog
where there's only one voice speak
