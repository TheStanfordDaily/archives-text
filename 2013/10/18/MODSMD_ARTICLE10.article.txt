# American Monuments
## 
### Esoterica Kevin Rouff 
On my drive back to school, following
a circuitous route traced by an often
mysterious family friend, I had the
fortune to come across many inte
gral constituents of Americana: the Grand
Canyon, Yosemite, pine forests, vast expans
es of deserts split by soft-shouldered roads
simmering in the heat.

From brothels on Nevada's Highway 95
to Tuolumne County's Chinese Camp, from
the grand "scenic view" to the simple "histor
ical marker," signs would direct my gaze to
wards these places in such away that I could
easily find them, take a photo and move on,
regardless of what I was actually looking at.
I ate it up.

I was purposefully driving to see certain
sights that I considered worthwhile based on
iconic photos I had previously seen or simply
due to having seen the names sprawled on
my map. I encountered others along the way
that, through markers, were deemed impor
tant. By the time I reached Yosemite Valley, I
was craning my neck out of the car window
looking for those iconic Ansel Adams photo
graphs. What I found instead was what
looked like a university campus: paved bike
ways and quaint picnic tables adorned with
beer guzzlers, nestled under the truly im
pressive mountains.

Searching for these preconceived im
ages (and usually not finding them) is not un
usual, as it is part of a monumentalized vision
of our nation of any nation that is of
ten propagated through images. We often
seek out these images: Our eyes are looking
for the same viewpoints that social media,
Google Images and pop culture have inundat
ed us with. John Szarkowski, the noted
American photographer, compared his craft
to the "act of pointing" the stream of im
ages become markers, and what they point to
are deemed "monuments," "historical," a
"national" something or other.
"Anything is potentially an attraction,"
says Dean MacCannell in his book, "The
Tourist." "It simply awaits one person to take
the trouble to point it out to another as some
thing noteworthy, as worth seeing."
Greg Stimac'l3 M.F.A. explored many of
these iconic images and sights through his own
work, shaking conventional visual foundations,
revealing voids or using this very same "monu
mentalization" of objects to his advantage.
In one of his works, "Old Faithful Inver
sion," he finds footage of Yellowstone Nation
al Park on You Tube and loops and inverts it on
film, an endeavor which results in a languid
and endless video of the iconic geyser,
stripped and given an eerie feeling of premo
nition.

Stimac told me about a man who lived
and worked in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for years.
He stared for a long time at the work, and only
after reading the title did he understand he
was looking at an American landmark; the im
age given was one that did not fit the monu
mentalized image of historical art and the con
temporary flood of images. It's as if Stimac is
pointing to the transience of these symbols as
they are, not just because Yosemite might
erupt into a super volcano but because the
concept of these monuments themselves are
undergoing dramatic shifts.
We go to Yosemite, the Eiffel Tower or the
Great Wall carrying preconceived images of
these monuments, which can even be filtered
and ranked by the first images results of a
Google search or the quantity of views or so
cial media "likes." When we visit, we are not
seeing for the first time, but only revalidating

what has already been seen. We read guide
books to assure ourselves that we have indeed
visited the correct spots and consumed the
best of what we could, be it the photos, the
food, the markets or the temples.
So the monuments signified in historical
art and contemporary media lose their roles as
signifiers themselves. We no longer see a
unique construct of the human or natural
forces but rather an inexact replica of the view
we were mentally seeking prior to physically
perceiving it.

In one of Stimac's works in progress, he
sets up audio recordings of the hordes of
tourists that descend on Mount Rushmore
every summer. In the soundtrack accompany
ing the video of the monument, one can hear
a little girl ask her father, "Is that the real
Mount Rushmore?"
Yet is this recent artistic focus on the
symbolic shift around tourism and monu
ments criticizing the tourist? I would argue
that it is not at least not directly. It is too
easy to dislike tourists, to search for the path
less taken and to pretend that "I'm not a
tourist."

"The Tourist," which has enjoyed more
commercial success recently than when it was
originally published probably due to the
artistic interest in this field maintains that
"we are all tourists," and yet in the newer edi
tion he remarks that he did not intend for the
use of the word "touristic" to take on a nega
tive connotation.

What recent art more specifically, re
cent Stanford art aims to do is redirect the
unconsciously directed gaze that has been led
by the geyser of cyber images. Art and Art His
tory Professor Joel Leivick has a new series,
"The Rapture," which will soon show at the

Stanford Art Gallery. In the series, he takes
close-up photographs of tourists glaring up
wards through their camera screens, wearing
expressions that are remarkably dumbfound
ed and confuse, all lit by the same warm light
of Rome's Pantheon interior.

His photos point back towards the very
same viewers of art, those in the Pantheon
and us gazing in a similar manner at them,
without a negative tone but rather one that
lifts them up to the same stature of the art it
self. With Leivick gazing down into his flip
screen, the tourists gazing up and Leivick's
camera gazing horizontally forward, we are
presented with a multifaceted view of the
monument and art itself without actually see
ing the works. In doing so, Leivick gives us a
new art: his own photographs.
I cannot jump to the conclusion that these
artists are criticizing the tourism of today

that thought is cliche and a much larger discus
sion but rather it seems we are given views
that, just like the previously discussed markers,
point anew. Why are we going to this temple
or that glacier deposit anyways? Why am I
taking this photo? And if it really is a form of
mimicry, what does this imply for the role of
the artist or the photographer?
Besides, most art is often a form of copy
ing inspiration; the photograph itself comes
from the concept of copy with a negative inver
sion and recopies this impression on paper.
How can my own art, perhaps as a tourist, re
flect anew upon an age-old subject?
These questions are not for me to answer,
but rather products of this Ã¼biquitous tourism,
and in themselves prove to be of much artistic
value if not simply food for thought.
