# American Monuments

### Esoterica Kevin Rouff 
On my drive back to school, following
a circuitous route traced by an often
mysterious family friend, I had the
fortune to come across many inte

American photographer, compared his craft
to the "act of pointing" the stream of im
ages become markers, and what they point to
are deemed "monuments," "historical," a
"national" something or other.
"Anything is potentially an attraction,"
