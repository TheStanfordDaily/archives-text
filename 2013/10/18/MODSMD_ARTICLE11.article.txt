## PREDICTIONS 
### 
SAM FISHER
STANFORD 24, UCLA 27: This is a very
difficult game to pick. I don't think UCLA is as good as
Washington, and the Cardinal already knocked off the
Huskies at home. However, I just can't feel confident in
what Stanford is doing on both sides of the ball right
now. Special teams have bailed out the Cardinal again
and again, but I expect UCLA will have a plan to limit
Ty Montgomery's ability to change a game on kickoff
returns. In the end, I think quarterback Brett Hundley
does just enough to avenge a very close Pac-12
Championship Game loss. The Bruins will seize com
mand of the race for second place in the Pac-12 while
sending the Cardinal off to Oregon State on a two
game skid.
GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 24, UCLA 21 I don't think
picking UCLA to beat Stanford would be an overreac
tion to the Cardinal's loss to Utah last Saturday by any
means. The Cardinal was simply outplayed by the
Utes, and that by itself is a huge worry. But I'm confident
in the players' ability to regroup and put the disappointing
loss behind them. UCLA will probably run jet sweeps and
bubble screens like it did in the Pac-12 Championship last
year, but I think the Cardinal defense will be better pre
pared for them this time. On the other side of the ball,
quarterback Kevin Hogan has struggled when the de
fense drops back in coverage, but look for his clutch ability
to come back tomorrow night. It'll be a close game, but
I think the Cardinal will come out on top.
DAVID COHN
STANFORD 34, UCLA 30: Stanford has
the luxury of facing UCLA at home, where the Cardi
nal has only lost once (to Oregon in 2011) since 2009.
Brett Hundley will test the Card throughout the game
with his ability to pick apart a defense with his feet
and his accuracy in throwing the football. As such, if
Stanford is going to win this week, the defensive line
has to get more pressure on Hundley than it did last
week against Travis Wilson, and the secondary has to
fight off blocks better on the inevitable bubble screens.
However, I think the defense responds to the chal
lenge, Kevin Hogan has a much better game throwing
the football and the Cardinal reaffirms its standing as
Oregon's greatest challenge in the Pac-12.
