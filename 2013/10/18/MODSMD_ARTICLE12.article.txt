# PLUGGING THE LEAKS
## CARD'S PAC-12 TITLE HOPES AT STAKE 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
After its national title aspirations took a
major if not fatal hit in Salt Lake City
last weekend, Stanford football finds itself in
unfamiliar territory after the loss, its first
since the overtime defeat to Notre Dame in
2012.

Besides losing ground in the tight Pac-12
North Division race, the Cardinal saw a num
ber of its impressive streaks the second
longest winning streak in the nation and a
conference-leading 11 straight victories over
Pac-12 teams, among others snapped last
Saturday.
It will be a quick turnaround for No. 13
Stanford (5-1, 3-1 Pac-12) because more
streaks and BCS implications will be on the
line tomorrow when the Cardinal welcomes
quarterback Brett Hundley and No. 9 UCLA
(5-0, 2-0) in a division showdown. The Bruins
are itching to avenge their loss to the Cardinal

in last year's Pac-12 Championship Game.
Stanford hopes to avoid losing two
games in a row for the first time since 2009,
when it fell to Oregon State and Arizona in
back-to-back weeks. But most importantly,
given how dominant No. 2 Oregon has been
so far this season, tomorrow's game is a must
win for the Cardinal if it hopes to defend its
Pac-12 title and remain in the Rose Bowl
hunt.

"Here we are: We're 5-1, tied with Ore
gon State for second place in the Pac-12
North, and we have five straight conference
games," said head coach David Shaw. "It's go
ing to be hard. I believe our guys are up to the
challenge. They know we need a better per
formance every week from here on out than
we had last Saturday."
After getting gashed by Utah's bubble
screens and zone read, the Cardinal defense
will face a tall order in stopping a Bruins of
fense that likes to run jet sweeps and the read
option, two tactics that UCLA used success-

fully against Stanford in the Pac-12 Champi
onship Game.

At the helm of the Bruins offense is
Hundley, who has emerged as a dark horse
Heisman candidate and also as one of this
year's top NFL quarterback prospects. Hund
ley showed his raw talents in 2012, but has
proven to be a more polished passer so far
this season by completing 68.1 percent of his
throws for 1,469 yards and 12 touchdowns in
addition to rushing for 260 yards and three
scores.

"There's never a point in any game this
year where [Hundley] looks uncomfortable,"
Shaw said. "He's not a young quarterback
anymore. He doesn't get surprised, he
doesn't get flustered. Even when he gets
rushed, you see him escape with composure
... He's going to be a starter at the next level
before too long."
Saturday's matchup between UCLA's of
fensive line and Stanford's defensive line
should prove to be an interesting one. The
Bruins gave up 52 sacks last season, second
worst in the nation, and while their pass pro
tection has improved considerably this year,
they are also starting two true freshmen on
the offensive line.

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal and the Bruins meet
for the third time in 11 months, as Stanford
looks to bounce back from its unexpected road
loss at Utah last weekend. UCLA's scheme is
very similar to that of the Utes, as the Bruins em
ploy bubble screens and the read option, which
could spell trouble for a battered Stanford de
fense. A loss would essentially end the Cardinal's
Pac-12 title and Rose Bowl hopes.

Defensive end Ben Gardner (left) is nursing an arm injury that his coach says "hurts like a
son of a gun," but given the Card's thinned defensive line, he'll still have to make an impact.

has been plagued by injuries. Senior defensive
end Henry Anderson and redshirt freshman
defensive tackle Ikenna Nwafor are still out
while fifth-year senior Ben Gardner has pain
in his arm that, according to Shaw, "hurts like
a son of a gun." Earlier this week, Shaw
moved tight end Luke Kaumatule to defensive
end in an effort to bolster depth at that posi
tion.

So far in 2013, the Bruins have outscored
their opponents 71-0 in the third quarter. Part
of this third-quarter dominance can be attrib
uted to big plays made by Hundley, but the
successful halftime adjustments that the Bru
ins make on defense have complemented the
offensive explosion. Outside linebacker Antho
ny Barr strikes fear in the hearts of offenses
with his deadly versatility in both pass rush and
pass coverage. A preseason Ail-American, Barr
forced two fumbles in UCLA's 41-21 victory
over then-No. 23 Nebraska in September.
"[Barr] is unbelievable. As good as he was
last year, he's better [now]," Shaw said. "He
looks bigger, stronger, faster. He's so quick, so
explosive, but he's got power... He's the best

defensive player that the conference has seen
in the last few years I don't think it's
close."

The Bruins secondary may not be the
most experienced unit in the conference, but
it has been effective so far with a 6/8 touch
down allowed/interception ratio. And given
that opposing defenses have seemingly found
quarterback Kevin Hogan's kryptonite by
dropping seven or even eight defenders back
into coverage, the Bruins may be able to
game-plan more effectively against Hogan in
their third showdown against the Cardinal
junior in 11 months.
"They have some young [defensive
backs], but also very athletic DBs," said fifth
year senior center Khalil Wilkes. "They're a
very physical team. They have a lot of big guys
up front, and they have a veteran group a
lot of seniors on that team."

Tomorrow's matchup is scheduled for a
12:30 p.m. kickoff, with national television
coverage on ABC/ESPN2.

Junior wide receiver Devon Cajuste (right) caught a Kevin Hogan lob in the fourth quarter
against Utah, but the Cardinal couldn't score again in the tough road loss. Cajuste will need
to produce once more on Saturday if Stanford hopes to keep up with UCLA's electric offense.
