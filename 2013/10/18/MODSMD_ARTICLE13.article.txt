# BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DAILY BRUIN
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's foot
ball game between Stanford
and UCLA, The Daily's Do-Hy
oung Park chatted with An
drew Erickson, a senior sports
staffer at The Daily Bruin,
UCLA's student newspaper, to
get perspective from both
camps. Below is a partial tran
script of their conversation.
For a more complete transcript
of their back-and-forth, go to
www.stanforddaily.com/cate
gory/sports.

Do-Hyoung Park (DP): I defi
nitely think that the biggest story
line heading into this matchup is
Stanford's defeat to Utah over the
weekend. Kevin Hogan had not
lost as a starter going into that
matchup but he certainly looked
shaky against Utah and against
Washington as well. How big of a
factor do you think that loss will
play on the field on Saturday?

Andrew Erickson (AE): That's
funny, I was about to ask you the
same question. Right before
UCLA started its game against
Cal, I watched the last few plays
of the Stanford-Utah game and
thought to myself that the ab
solute best thing for UCLA would
be for Stanford to win, primarily
because the Cardinal has the Bru
ins' number (see: 2012) and any
sold-out road game in the Pac-12
is tough enough.

DP: It's funny that you say that
the Cardinal has the Bruins' num
ber because I was actually about
to say that UCLA has Stanford's
number. That Pac-12 Champi
onship loss was a huge scare for
the Cardinal and Hundley has
looked even better this year.
Utah's game plan on Saturday re
minded a lot of people of UCLA's
game plan against Stanford last

year in that close loss, and Mora
and Hundley have got to be lick
ing their chops and waiting for
this shaken-up Cardinal second
ary that couldn't make tackles or
cover well against Utah. I think
UCLA definitely has the upper
hand in this matchup because of
that, especially given how it defi
nitely won't want to lose for a
third time this year.

AE: For being a potential All Pac
-12 quarterback, Hundley has had
his good games, and he's had his
get-the-job-done games. While
the stat line points to the con
trary, I would say the latter is true
of his Saturday performance
against Cal. Yes, he finished with
a career-high 410 yards and com
pleted 31 of 41 passes, but even
he said after the game that it was
just "okay." He under-threw run
ning back Damien Thigpen on
what should have been a 70-yard
touchdown, missed five potential
touchdown passes inside the 10-
yard line and consistently seems
to be throwing the ball behind
slot receiver Devin Fuller, ar
guably UCLA's best offensive ath
lete, on the drag routes they like
to run over the middle.

And I like that you brought
up Utah. To me, Utah is probably
the second-best team in the Pac
-12 South and Rice-Eccles Stadi
um is undoubtedly, because of
the crowd noise and elevation,
one of the toughest places to play
in the conference. It certainly was
for UCLA, who I think could very
easily have shared Stanford's fate
if it hadn't picked off six Travis
Wilson passes over the course of
the game, the last coming with
Utah driving in the closing sec
onds.

DP: What do you think will be
the biggest factor in who wins on
Saturday?
AE: I think this game
comes down who can
make the big play at the
right time and/or not make
costly mistakes when the
game is on the line. UCLA
has really only played in
one game that was close
beyond the third quarter,
and that was the Utah
game. I'll also point out
that it wasn't close because
of the Bruins defense, but
because of Hundley, who
misread a Devin Lucien out
route and gave up a pick
six. Hundley later made up
for it with a game-winning
touchdown run on a draw
play.

There's no glaring

weaknesses on either team
that lead me to believe Ve
gas is wrong and that it will
be a blowout either way, so
the difference could be ac
counted for in a broken-up
pass, an interception or a
defender slipping at some
point to allow a big play.
I'm also glad you men
tioned Stanford's offen
sive line, which I think
could be a handful for
UCLA, given that two of
its most heavily-featured
defensive ends, Keenan
Graham and Cassius
Marsh, are pretty under
sized. If those two in par
ticular can hold their own,
as they've been able to do
for the first five games,
then I think we could be in
for a tight one.

looked even better this year.
Utah's game plan on Saturday re
minded a lot of people of UCLA's
game plan against Stanford last

year in that close loss, and Mora
and Hundley have got to be lick
ing their chops and waiting for
this shaken-up Cardinal second
ary that couldn't make tackles or
cover well against Utah. I think
UCLA definitely has the upper
hand in this matchup because of
that, especially given how it defi
nitely won't want to lose for a
third time this year.

AE: For being a potential All Pac
-12 quarterback, Hundley has had
his good games, and he's had his
get-the-job-done games. While
the stat line points to the con
trary, I would say the latter is true
of his Saturday performance
against Cal. Yes, he finished with
a career-high 410 yards and com
pleted 31 of 41 passes, but even
he said after the game that it was
just "okay." He under-threw run
ning back Damien Thigpen on
what should have been a 70-yard
touchdown, missed five potential
touchdown passes inside the 10-
yard line and consistently seems
to be throwing the ball behind
slot receiver Devin Fuller, ar
guably UCLA's best offensive ath
lete, on the drag routes they like
to run over the middle.

And I like that you brought
up Utah. To me, Utah is probably
the second-best team in the Pac
-12 South and Rice-Eccles Stadi
um is undoubtedly, because of
the crowd noise and elevation,
one of the toughest places to play
in the conference. It certainly was
for UCLA, who I think could very
easily have shared Stanford's fate
if it hadn't picked off six Travis
Wilson passes over the course of
the game, the last coming with
Utah driving in the closing sec
onds.

DP: What do you think will be
the biggest factor in who wins on
Saturday?
AE: I think this game
comes down who can
make the big play at the
right time and/or not make
costly mistakes when the
game is on the line. UCLA
has really only played in
one game that was close
beyond the third quarter,
and that was the Utah
game. I'll also point out
that it wasn't close because
of the Bruins defense, but
because of Hundley, who
misread a Devin Lucien out
route and gave up a pick
six. Hundley later made up
for it with a game-winning
touchdown run on a draw
play.

There's no glaring

weaknesses on either team
that lead me to believe Ve
gas is wrong and that it will
be a blowout either way, so
the difference could be ac
counted for in a broken-up
pass, an interception or a
defender slipping at some
point to allow a big play.
I'm also glad you men
tioned Stanford's offen
sive line, which I think
could be a handful for
UCLA, given that two of
its most heavily-featured
defensive ends, Keenan
Graham and Cassius
Marsh, are pretty under
sized. If those two in par
ticular can hold their own,
as they've been able to do
for the first five games,
then I think we could be in
for a tight one.

In advance of Saturday's foot
ball game between Stanford
and UCLA, The Daily's Do-Hy
oung Park chatted with An
drew Erickson, a senior sports
staffer at The Daily Bruin,
UCLA's student newspaper, to
get perspective from both
camps. Below is a partial tran
script of their conversation.
For a more complete transcript
of their back-and-forth, go to
www.stanforddaily.com/cate
gory/sports.

Do-Hyoung Park (DP): I defi
nitely think that the biggest story
line heading into this matchup is
Stanford's defeat to Utah over the
weekend. Kevin Hogan had not
lost as a starter going into that
matchup but he certainly looked
shaky against Utah and against
Washington as well. How big of a
factor do you think that loss will
play on the field on Saturday?

Andrew Erickson (AE): That's
funny, I was about to ask you the
same question. Right before
UCLA started its game against
Cal, I watched the last few plays
of the Stanford-Utah game and
thought to myself that the ab
solute best thing for UCLA would
be for Stanford to win, primarily
because the Cardinal has the Bru
ins' number (see: 2012) and any
sold-out road game in the Pac-12
is tough enough.

DP: It's funny that you say that
the Cardinal has the Bruins' num
ber because I was actually about
to say that UCLA has Stanford's
number. That Pac-12 Champi
onship loss was a huge scare for
the Cardinal and Hundley has
looked even better this year.
