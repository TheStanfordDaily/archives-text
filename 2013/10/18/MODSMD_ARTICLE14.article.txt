# Wopat nears kill milestone
## 
### JORDAN WALLACH 
Having swept both of its
matches last weekend with both
defense and offense in sync, now
is as good a time as any for Stan
ford's women's volleyball team to
embark on one of its most diffi
cult road trips of the year.
The No. 7 Cardinal (12-3, 5-
1 Pac-12) will look to sustain its
momentum tonight against the
Washington State Cougars (15-4,
2-4), ahead of a showdown be
tween two of the three highest
ranked Pac-12 teams on Sunday
against the No. 6 Washington

Huskies (14-1, 6-1).
"This is a big trip every year,"
said head coach John Dunning. "It's
the one you have to fly in between,
so you really have to be rested and
get yourself ready to do it."
After focusing on defensive
drills in practice leading up to last
weekend after a loss to No. 2
USC, Stanford defeated Utah on
Friday and Colorado on Saturday
with exactly that: defense. The
team held its opponents to a. 191
hitting percentage over the week
end and recorded 18.67 digs per

set, compared to its 15.37 average pri
or. Junior libero Kyle Gilbert led the
team with 5.83 digs per set, controlling
many of them to set up offensive at
tacks.

Senior outside hitter Carly Wopat,
who had 10 kills and hit .529 in each of
the team's weekend matches, was
named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of
the Week on Oct. 14, the first Cardinal
player to receive the honor this season.
This season, she leads the Pac-12 with a
.498 hitting percentage (third national
ly) and 1.40 blocks per set (13th nation
ally). With 992 career kills, Wopat can
surpass 1,000 tonight against Washing
ton State.

Stanford looks to improve its 52-3
overall record against Washington State;
the last time the Cougars beat the Card
was on Nov. 16, 2002 in Pullman,
Wash. The Cougars are coming off a

split last weekend in which they upset
No. 16 Arizona State but lost to Ari
zona, both in five-set matches. Fresh
man outside hitter Kyra Holt leads the
team with 4.11 kills per set (fifth in Pac
-12).

A tougher test will come on Sun
day, when the Cardinal, who owns a 49-
11 record all-time against Washington,
looks to repeat history, trying to hand
the Huskies their first home loss of the
season like it did last October. Down
23-24 in the fourth set, Stanford saved
match point on a Husky service error
and won the set 26-24, before decisive
ly taking the fifth set 15-7. Washington
had 16 team blocks and held the Card
to a season-low .110 hitting percentage
but couldn't pull out the victory in front
of a season-high crowd of 4,401. The
Card defeated the Huskies again on
Nov. 8 last year in a four-setter at
Maples Pavilion.
Washington has won four straight
matches, having dropped only one set,
since losing for the first time on Oct. 4
against Colorado in Boulder. Coming in

to this week, the team led the NCAA
with 1.96 service aces per set, with
sophomore outside hitter Cassie Strick
land leading the team with 0.41 service
aces per set.

Two Huskies to watch are junior
outside hitters Krista Vansant and
Kaleigh Nelson. Vansant, who is hitting
.344 and leads the team with 3.90 kills
per set, is coming off a dominant match
against Cal on Wednesday. She reached
1,000 career kills in the match, hit .448
and recorded her sixth double-double
of the season with 14 kills and 14 digs.
Nelson, who is hitting .293 and averag
ing 2.75 kills per set, matched her
teammate with 14 kills in the match
against Cal, with seven of those coming
in the first set.

Stanford takes on Washington
State in Pullman tonight at 6 p.m. and
Washington in Seattle at 4:30 p.m. on
Sunday. Both matches will be televised
on Pac-12 Networks.
