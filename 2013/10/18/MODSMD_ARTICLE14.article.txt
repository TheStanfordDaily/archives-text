# Wopat nears kill milestone
## 
### JORDAN WALLACH 
Having swept both of its
matches last weekend with both
defense and offense in sync, now
is as good a time as any for Stan
ford's women's volleyball team to
embark on one of its most diffi
cult road trips of the year.
The No. 7 Cardinal (12-3, 5-
1 Pac-12) will look to sustain its
momentum tonight against the
Washington State Cougars (15-4,
2-4), ahead of a showdown be
tween two of the three highest
ranked Pac-12 teams on Sunday
against the No. 6 Washington

Huskies (14-1, 6-1).
"This is a big trip every year,"
said head coach John Dunning. "It's
the one you have to fly in between,
so you really have to be rested and
get yourself ready to do it."
After focusing on defensive
drills in practice leading up to last
weekend after a loss to No. 2
USC, Stanford defeated Utah on
Friday and Colorado on Saturday
with exactly that: defense. The
team held its opponents to a. 191
hitting percentage over the week
end and recorded 18.67 digs per

Senior outside hitter Carly Wopat (above) needs eight more kills to
reach 1,000 on her career. She can achieve that milestone tonight at
6 p.m. as the Cardinal travels to Pullman to face Washington State.
