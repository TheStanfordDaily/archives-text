# UCLA, Utah offer same challenges
## 
### WHAT TO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
In my three-plus seasons watch
ing Cardinal football, I'm not
sure there has been a more im
portant game at Stanford Stadi
um than tomorrow's against UCLA.
One can make an argument for
Oregon in 2011, of course, but Stan
ford lost that one and still went to a
BCS game. That will almost certainly
not happen if the Cardinal falls to
UCLA.

That's what's at stake if Stanford
loses. But if the Card can bounce
back and top the Bruins, then it will
be in the driver's seat for the Rose
Bowl (with either a win or a loss
against Oregon).
The problem is that simple mo
tivation by what's at stake won't be
enough to beat a very good UCLA
team. Besides the fluky Arizona win,
the game that gave Stanford the
most defensive trouble in 2012 was
the Pac-12 Championship Game
against UCLA. And the Bruins' game
plan that day? You saw it replicated
almost identically by the Utes last
Saturday.

So while Stanford also needs to
play better offensively, those defen
sive struggles bring me to the most
important thing to watch for Satur
day: How well can Stanford's de
fense slow down this bubble
screen/swing-pass/read-option at
tack?

There is one reason to think
that the Cardinal will be worse off
this week than last and another rea
son to think that Stanford will be

better off.
On the pessimistic side, UCLA
quarterback Brett Hundley is a lot bet
ter than Utah quarterback Travis Wil
son, especially in the downfield pass
ing game.

This could present a very big
problem for Stanford's defense. As
we saw against Utah, the best way to
stop the swing pass and bubble
screen is to have many defensive play
ers flowing toward that side of the
field. Look to see both safeties flow
ing with the motion to try to help out
the cornerbacks and linebackers.

However, that strategy leaves
one man on an island: the backside
cornerback. Utah burned Stanford
deep once last Saturday on a 51-yard
touchdown pass against senior cor
nerback Devon Carrington. Stanford

is going to have a few one-on-one cov
erage situations, and with Hundley's
athleticism, accuracy and poise, Car
dinal defenders won't get away with
bad defense. One or two of those
deep balls could be the difference in
the game.

The reason to be optimistic is
that UCLAs offensive line is a big
weakness, especially on the right
side. Right guard Alex Redmond and

right tackle Caleb Benenoch are true
freshmen, and Benenoch has only
one career start under his belt.
Normally, a matchup like that
would mean domination by the Card.
However, Stanford's hobbled defen
sive line has been having trouble get
ting any penetration whatsoever. Per
haps sophomore Luke Kaumatule's
move from tight end back to defen
sive end this week will provide the
spark that the defensive line needs to
restart the #Partyinthebackfield.
Otherwise, there's no reason to
think Stanford will be able to stop the
Bruins any better than it stopped the
Utes, leaving a heavy burden on its
special teams and offense to put up a
lot of points and save the season.

to defensive line this week didn't go
quite as smoothly as Luke Kaumat
ule's. Remind him not to quit his day

side. Right guard Alex Redmond and

right tackle Caleb Benenoch are true
freshmen, and Benenoch has only
one career start under his belt.
Normally, a matchup like that
would mean domination by the Card.
However, Stanford's hobbled defen
sive line has been having trouble get
ting any penetration whatsoever. Per
haps sophomore Luke Kaumatule's
move from tight end back to defen
sive end this week will provide the
spark that the defensive line needs to
restart the #Partyinthebackfield.
Otherwise, there's no reason to
think Stanford will be able to stop the
Bruins any better than it stopped the
Utes, leaving a heavy burden on its
special teams and offense to put up a
lot of points and save the season.

Sam Fisher's move from play-by-play
to defensive line this week didn't go
quite as smoothly as Luke Kaumat
ule's. Remind him not to quit his day
job at safisher@stanford.edu and fol
low him on Twitter @SamFisher9oB.

UCLA quarterback
Brett Hundley is a lot
better than Utah
quarterback Travis
Wilson.
