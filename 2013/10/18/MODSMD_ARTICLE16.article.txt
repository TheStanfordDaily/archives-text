# College football's brain trust
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Say what you want about Con
doleezza Rice's qualifications
as a football expert, or the lo
gistics of the College Football
Playoff system that will begin in 2014.
I've got a feeling that Rice and the rest
of the committee announced Wednes
day aren't just going to improve the col
lege football postseason.
They're going to improve college
football.

Everyone seems nervous about
the first big decisions the committee
will have to make next December; ES
PN even dubbed the group's members
the "Unlucky 13." But though it can't
get much worse than the BCS does
Stanford really do that well in computer
rankings, or is the Red Zone just filled
to the brim with hackers? (Think about
it.) I don't think the selection com
mittee is just the lesser of two evils.
Take a look at the group that will
be meeting around that conference
table. They're big names, and it's not
just a random selection; these people
know each other.

You've got Barry Alvarez and Ty
rone Willingham, the two head coach
es in the 2000 Rose Bowl, as well as
Archie Manning and Oliver Luck, for
mer teammates with the Houston Oil
ers in the 'Bos who have since fathered
successive Indianapolis Colts franchise
quarterbacks. And, believe it or not,
Rice and Willingham have both served
as volunteer assistant coaches for the
Stanford women's golf team.

Those connections and the
mutual respect they (in most cases) en
tail are why there was a pervasive
sense of excitement during Wednes
day's conference call announcement.
The committee members are leaders
in their respective realms, so knowl
edgeable and so passionate that the
sky's the limit in this new setting.
Maybe the selection committee
doesn't know it yet, but that group is
primed to change the college football
landscape if it's given the chance.

Here's an example of what I
mean. During the teleconference, Rice
didn't just talk about filling a four-team
playoff; she mentioned her desire to
preserve the student-athlete experi
ence. Last I checked, decidingwhether
to pick a one-loss SEC team over an un
defeated ACC school doesn't really fit
into that category. What, then, was she
referring to?
How about figuring out how to
keep players safe, especially in a sport
that is becoming severely threatened
by head injury at all levels? Or address
ing the plague of violations that have
swept across the NCAA in recent
years? USC athletic director and com
mittee member Pat Haden, who
helped clean up the mess at USC,
might know a thing or two about
changing a program's culture.
Few collections of people have
the collective know-how and boots-on
the-ground experience (that includes
Rice, who hired Willingham when she
was Stanford's provost) as the 13 com
mittee members announced on
Wednesday.
That's why Condi and Co. can be
more than just a selection committee
they can be a college football think
tank.

It sounds bizarre, and yes, it's go
ing to be another 14 months before
we truly know if the selection commit
tee can make wise decisions. But given
the NCAAs administrative struggles,
maybe college football needs someone
else to come up with revolutionary
ideas. Division I already has a board of
directors, but it's made up of university
presidents, not necessarily people who
are passionate about football.
We're lucky to have the Unlucky
13. Let's put them to work.

know each other.

You've got Barry Alvarez and Ty
rone Willingham, the two head coach
es in the 2000 Rose Bowl, as well as
Archie Manning and Oliver Luck, for
mer teammates with the Houston Oil
ers in the 'Bos who have since fathered
successive Indianapolis Colts franchise
quarterbacks. And, believe it or not,
Rice and Willingham have both served
as volunteer assistant coaches for the
Stanford women's golf team.

Those connections and the
mutual respect they (in most cases) en
tail are why there was a pervasive
sense of excitement during Wednes
day's conference call announcement.
The committee members are leaders
in their respective realms, so knowl
edgeable and so passionate that the
sky's the limit in this new setting.
Maybe the selection committee
doesn't know it yet, but that group is
primed to change the college football
landscape if it's given the chance.

Here's an example of what I
mean. During the teleconference, Rice
didn't just talk about filling a four-team
playoff; she mentioned her desire to
preserve the student-athlete experi
ence. Last I checked, decidingwhether
to pick a one-loss SEC team over an un
defeated ACC school doesn't really fit
into that category. What, then, was she
referring to?
How about figuring out how to
keep players safe, especially in a sport
that is becoming severely threatened
by head injury at all levels? Or address
ing the plague of violations that have
swept across the NCAA in recent
years? USC athletic director and com
mittee member Pat Haden, who
helped clean up the mess at USC,
might know a thing or two about
changing a program's culture.
Few collections of people have
the collective know-how and boots-on
the-ground experience (that includes
Rice, who hired Willingham when she
was Stanford's provost) as the 13 com
mittee members announced on
Wednesday.
That's why Condi and Co. can be
more than just a selection committee
they can be a college football think
tank.

It sounds bizarre, and yes, it's go
ing to be another 14 months before
we truly know if the selection commit
tee can make wise decisions. But given
the NCAAs administrative struggles,
maybe college football needs someone
else to come up with revolutionary
ideas. Division I already has a board of
directors, but it's made up of university
presidents, not necessarily people who
are passionate about football.
We're lucky to have the Unlucky
13. Let's put them to work.
