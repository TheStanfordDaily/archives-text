## Reasons to Join Band 
### BLAKE MONTGOMERY 
Have you watched the
Band running around
in crazy costumes (or
in nothing at all) and
always secretly wished you
were cool enough to join them?
Well, you are! And lucky for
you, it's never too late to join.
Special correspondent Blake
Montgomery is here to give
you five reasons why you
should become the newest
member of the LSJUMB.
Homies: I've met the best peo
ple in Band, and many of them
became my draw mates. Do you
want to meet new friends and
lovers? Then join Band.
Rally: Looking to spice up your
fall wardrobe? Try a bedazzled
German beer maid outfit. Tired
of everything in your closet?
Pick up this flattering muumuu
in an understated shade of
neon green. Bored with your
love life? Try these plaid jorts
for some jazzy foreplay.
Learn to play an instrument:
... Or not. I've been in Band for

four years and can only make
squeaks on the tenor sax. But
section leaders do offer lessons.
Joining Band is a casual way to
learn a fun new skill and make
friends.
Party town down: In Band, we
call a party a "sex." Tenorsex is
a party for the tenor sax sec
tion. Definitely the best parties
I've been to at Stanford, and
much more low-key than an all
campus party. Joining Band is a
great way to learn about your
new friends and their drinking
habits.
De-stress: Band is the one ac
tivity I've been consistently in
volved with for all four years at
Stanford. There's no stress in
volved. I show up in strange
clothes, dance every which way
like an idiot and make wacky
noises. No worries, no cares.
And for some reason, specta
tors love what we do. I certainly
love doing it. It's so liberating to
have no expectations except to
be enthusiastic and goofy.
