# FASHION ON THE FARM:
## HOW TO PULLA MILEY 
### KEYA TEKLU FASHION COLUMNIST 
Miley Cyrus, former Disney child star and cur
rent pop icon, has been all over the news lately for
her experimental fashion choices. Now, I'm not say
ing I'm a Miley supporter, nor am I saying I hate her
guts, but what I am saying is that more of us today
could afford to do a little of what she's doing.
What is she doing, you might ask? She's taking
sartorial risks. She's being bold. She is dressing how
she wants to dress and isn't too concerned what the
fashion industry thinks about it. No matter what you
wear, you are sending a message, intentional or not.
And right now Miley's message is "I'm going to
break rules and have some fun!"

Say what you want about Miley and most
people have been doing just that but you can't
deny how daring and unafraid she is with her choic
es. Rules, especially fashion rules, are sometimes
meant to be broken, and Miley is dare I say it
wrecking them all.

Her ways might be a bit extreme, but the
method behind her madness is worthy of discussion.
In my opinion, her style advocates fearlessness in
fashion. I'm not saying to go to her extremes, but
don't be afraid to pull a Miley once in a while. Buy
that top in the store that you're drawn to but feel is
n't necessarily "mainstream" or "appropriate"
enough. Bring some color into your wardrobe. Wear
printed pants. Try hair tinsel! Be bold! Live long and

accessorize!
College is the time to experiment with fashion.
Undergraduates have a unique opportunity to wear
whatever they want and blame it on feeling "young,
wild and free." You can't pull off a micro-mini skirt
the same way at 21 that you can at 45, so do it now.
Take advantage of the fact that few people take us
youngsters seriously it's okay to make mistakes.
This is true for all aspects of life, but it is especially
applicable in fashion. Clothes can be so much
fun to experiment with, but if you follow the strict
rules that the industry preaches (e.g. no white after
Labor Day, no bright colors in the fall, florals are only
for spring and summer, etc.) fashion becomes a drag.
