# FASHION ON THE FARM:
## HOW TO PULLA MILEY 
### KEYA TEKLU FASHION COLUMNIST 
Miley Cyrus, former Disney child star and cur
rent pop icon, has been all over the news lately for
her experimental fashion choices. Now, I'm not say
ing I'm a Miley supporter, nor am I saying I hate her
guts, but what I am saying is that more of us today
could afford to do a little of what she's doing.
What is she doing, you might ask? She's taking
sartorial risks. She's being bold. She is dressing how
she wants to dress and isn't too concerned what the
fashion industry thinks about it. No matter what you
wear, you are sending a message, intentional or not.
And right now Miley's message is "I'm going to
break rules and have some fun!"

Say what you want about Miley and most
people have been doing just that but you can't
deny how daring and unafraid she is with her choic
es. Rules, especially fashion rules, are sometimes
meant to be broken, and Miley is dare I say it
wrecking them all.

Her ways might be a bit extreme, but the
method behind her madness is worthy of discussion.
In my opinion, her style advocates fearlessness in
fashion. I'm not saying to go to her extremes, but
don't be afraid to pull a Miley once in a while. Buy
that top in the store that you're drawn to but feel is
n't necessarily "mainstream" or "appropriate"
enough. Bring some color into your wardrobe. Wear
printed pants. Try hair tinsel! Be bold! Live long and

accessorize!
College is the time to experiment with fashion.
Undergraduates have a unique opportunity to wear
whatever they want and blame it on feeling "young,
wild and free." You can't pull off a micro-mini skirt
the same way at 21 that you can at 45, so do it now.
Take advantage of the fact that few people take us
youngsters seriously it's okay to make mistakes.
This is true for all aspects of life, but it is especially
applicable in fashion. Clothes can be so much
fun to experiment with, but if you follow the strict
rules that the industry preaches (e.g. no white after
Labor Day, no bright colors in the fall, florals are only
for spring and summer, etc.) fashion becomes a drag.


ZETONG LI/The Stanford Daily
It is unbelievable how much an outfit
can add to a person's self-esteem, as
evidenced by Miss Cyrus. She could not
be more confident, even with all her
haters, and I honestly feel that this is be
cause she is doing what she wants and
wearing what she likes, not what other
people think is appropriate for her.
At age 20, she is at the same
turning point in her life as all Stan
ford students, but she is taking full
advantage of it. I want her fashion for
wardness to inspire all of you to be
bolder in your fashion choices. I real
ize that this is a fashion column, and

my job is to report on the trends and
tell you what looks good and what
doesn't, but sometimes it really does
n't matter what looks good it mat
ters what you think looks good. If
you want to wear neon pants with a
highlighter yellow top, do it. And be
confident in it. I bet Miley could rock
that same look on the red carpet, and
it would be on fashion runways in a
matter of days. That's because she is
no longer a trend-follower; she is a
trendsetter. That's what happens
when the rules go out the window.
Now, when we graduate, get
jobs and start living in the "real
world," our fashion choices could
have very real consequences. Bosses
could feel uncomfortable; clients
could be put-off. But Stanford is a

"bubble" in more than just the geo
graphical sense. It is a bubble in that
mistakes and risks that are made here
don't mean as much than if they were
made in the real world. So don't be
afraid to pull a Miley this week. Wear
something bold and crazy. If you nor
mally straighten your hair, let it go au
natural. If you always wear sweats to
class, maybe try some ripped jeans
(but please don't get naked that is
probably a reasonable place to draw
the line). Everybody has seen Miley's
VMA's performance, as well as her
questionable choices in fashion, but
you can either be outraged by it, or
inspired by it. I choose the latter.

And right now Miley's message is "I'm going to
break rules and have some fun!"

Say what you want about Miley and most
people have been doing just that but you can't
deny how daring and unafraid she is with her choic
es. Rules, especially fashion rules, are sometimes
meant to be broken, and Miley is dare I say it
wrecking them all.

Her ways might be a bit extreme, but the
method behind her madness is worthy of discussion.
In my opinion, her style advocates fearlessness in
fashion. I'm not saying to go to her extremes, but
don't be afraid to pull a Miley once in a while. Buy
that top in the store that you're drawn to but feel is
n't necessarily "mainstream" or "appropriate"
enough. Bring some color into your wardrobe. Wear
printed pants. Try hair tinsel! Be bold! Live long and

accessorize!
College is the time to experiment with fashion.
Undergraduates have a unique opportunity to wear
whatever they want and blame it on feeling "young,
wild and free." You can't pull off a micro-mini skirt
the same way at 21 that you can at 45, so do it now.
Take advantage of the fact that few people take us
youngsters seriously it's okay to make mistakes.
This is true for all aspects of life, but it is especially
applicable in fashion. Clothes can be so much
fun to experiment with, but if you follow the strict
rules that the industry preaches (e.g. no white after
Labor Day, no bright colors in the fall, florals are only
for spring and summer, etc.) fashion becomes a drag.

It is unbelievable how much an outfit
can add to a person's self-esteem, as
evidenced by Miss Cyrus. She could not
be more confident, even with all her
haters, and I honestly feel that this is be
cause she is doing what she wants and
wearing what she likes, not what other
people think is appropriate for her.
At age 20, she is at the same
turning point in her life as all Stan
ford students, but she is taking full
advantage of it. I want her fashion for
wardness to inspire all of you to be
bolder in your fashion choices. I real
ize that this is a fashion column, and

my job is to report on the trends and
tell you what looks good and what
doesn't, but sometimes it really does
n't matter what looks good it mat
ters what you think looks good. If
you want to wear neon pants with a
highlighter yellow top, do it. And be
confident in it. I bet Miley could rock
that same look on the red carpet, and
it would be on fashion runways in a
matter of days. That's because she is
no longer a trend-follower; she is a
trendsetter. That's what happens
when the rules go out the window.
Now, when we graduate, get
jobs and start living in the "real
world," our fashion choices could
have very real consequences. Bosses
could feel uncomfortable; clients
could be put-off. But Stanford is a

"bubble" in more than just the geo
graphical sense. It is a bubble in that
mistakes and risks that are made here
don't mean as much than if they were
made in the real world. So don't be
afraid to pull a Miley this week. Wear
something bold and crazy. If you nor
mally straighten your hair, let it go au
natural. If you always wear sweats to
class, maybe try some ripped jeans
(but please don't get naked that is
probably a reasonable place to draw
the line). Everybody has seen Miley's
VMA's performance, as well as her
questionable choices in fashion, but
you can either be outraged by it, or
inspired by it. I choose the latter.

Miley Cyrus, former Disney child star and cur
rent pop icon, has been all over the news lately for
her experimental fashion choices. Now, I'm not say
ing I'm a Miley supporter, nor am I saying I hate her
guts, but what I am saying is that more of us today
could afford to do a little of what she's doing.
What is she doing, you might ask? She's taking
sartorial risks. She's being bold. She is dressing how
she wants to dress and isn't too concerned what the
fashion industry thinks about it. No matter what you
wear, you are sending a message, intentional or not.
And right now Miley's message is "I'm going to
break rules and have some fun!"
