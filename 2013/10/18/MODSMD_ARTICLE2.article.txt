## How the Band was born Following 1963 strike, band director Barnes spearheaded change 
### MINNA XIAO DESK EDITOR 
Those familiar with the Band's mod
ern-day incarnation may be surprised to
learn that Stanford's most colorful student
organization started off as a traditional all
male, Sousa-playing marching band, com
plete with in-step line formations and mili
tary uniforms.
Formed in 1893, the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB)
had all the makings of a typical college
marching band. Turmoil arrived in 1963,
however, when a reorganization of the mu
sic department resulted in the dismissal of
long-time Band director Jules Schucat.
Enraged at the change, the bandsmen
organized themselves to withhold their mu
sical services in what became known as the
Band Strike of '63. At the first two football
games of the season in the fall of 1963, the
Stanford Band was conspicuously absent.
The reign of Dr. Barnes
Enter Arthur E Barnes D.M.A. '65, a
former band and music theory instructor at
Fresno State who had been tapped to re
place Schucat as Band director while pursu
ing his doctorate in musical education at
Stanford.
Gifted with perfect pitch and incredi
ble musical talent, Barnes won the students
over with his innovative and timely two
minute arrangements of their generation's
most popular rock 'n' roll songs and his lais
sez-faire attitude towards Band govern
ment. Effectively ceding all control of the
Band to the students, Barnes focused in
stead on cultivating a musical repertoire
that radically deviated from traditional

marching music.
"We were the world's largest rock 'n'
roll band," said David Ruiz '73, who played
trumpet in the Band and served as the
Band's assistant manager and later as man
ager. He recounts Band members bringing
records and cassettes to Barnes, who would
then translate, if suitable, the hits of The
Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys into
band music befitting every instrument sec
tion.

"We chose the music that resonated
with us, that had cultural meaning," Ruiz
said. "The music reflected the organiza
tion's composite the people."
Indeed, the Band's present-day de fac
to fight song, 'All Right Now," was charted
by Barnes following a student suggestion.

A little autonomy never hurt anybody
Barnes' appointment ushered in a new
era of a student-run Band, a modus operan
di that has defined the culture of the Band
to this day. Greg Louden 'B9 M.A. '9O,

chairman of the Stanford Band Alumni
Board, likens Barnes to "the cool uncle, the
one who helped you achieve what you
wanted, but also let you do your own
thing."

"Dr. Barnes took control of the band by
giving control to the students," Louden
added.

This newfound student autonomy was
soon exhibited in the Band's field shows,
which quickly took on the distinct humor
and tongue-in-cheek irreverence that to this
day flavor the Band's performances. In the
transformative years following the Band
Strike, students were not mandated to sub
mit the music and scripts of their halftime
shows for reviews and thus exercised con
siderable creative reign.

Hal Mickelson'7l, who served as stadi
um announcer for 15 years and established
himself as an integral voice of the Band's
field shows, said that the Band focused on

Before the strike in 1963, the Stanford marching band was a traditional, all-male, Sousaplaying
marching band. After the strike, students took over and the Band began reflecting
the culture of the 1960s with a scatter band style and rock 'n' roll arrangements.
