## How the Band was born Following 1963 strike, band director Barnes spearheaded change 
### MINNA XIAO DESK EDITOR 
Those familiar with the Band's mod
ern-day incarnation may be surprised to
learn that Stanford's most colorful student
organization started off as a traditional all
male, Sousa-playing marching band, com
plete with in-step line formations and mili
tary uniforms.
Formed in 1893, the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB)
had all the makings of a typical college
marching band. Turmoil arrived in 1963,
however, when a reorganization of the mu
sic department resulted in the dismissal of
long-time Band director Jules Schucat.
Enraged at the change, the bandsmen
organized themselves to withhold their mu
sical services in what became known as the
Band Strike of '63. At the first two football
games of the season in the fall of 1963, the
Stanford Band was conspicuously absent.
The reign of Dr. Barnes
Enter Arthur E Barnes D.M.A. '65, a
former band and music theory instructor at
Fresno State who had been tapped to re
place Schucat as Band director while pursu
ing his doctorate in musical education at
Stanford.
Gifted with perfect pitch and incredi
ble musical talent, Barnes won the students
over with his innovative and timely two
minute arrangements of their generation's
most popular rock 'n' roll songs and his lais
sez-faire attitude towards Band govern
ment. Effectively ceding all control of the
Band to the students, Barnes focused in
stead on cultivating a musical repertoire
that radically deviated from traditional

marching music.
"We were the world's largest rock 'n'
roll band," said David Ruiz '73, who played
trumpet in the Band and served as the
Band's assistant manager and later as man
ager. He recounts Band members bringing
records and cassettes to Barnes, who would
then translate, if suitable, the hits of The
Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys into
band music befitting every instrument sec
tion.

"We chose the music that resonated
with us, that had cultural meaning," Ruiz
said. "The music reflected the organiza
tion's composite the people."
Indeed, the Band's present-day de fac
to fight song, 'All Right Now," was charted
by Barnes following a student suggestion.

A little autonomy never hurt anybody
Barnes' appointment ushered in a new
era of a student-run Band, a modus operan
di that has defined the culture of the Band
to this day. Greg Louden 'B9 M.A. '9O,

chairman of the Stanford Band Alumni
Board, likens Barnes to "the cool uncle, the
one who helped you achieve what you
wanted, but also let you do your own
thing."

"Dr. Barnes took control of the band by
giving control to the students," Louden
added.

This newfound student autonomy was
soon exhibited in the Band's field shows,
which quickly took on the distinct humor
and tongue-in-cheek irreverence that to this
day flavor the Band's performances. In the
transformative years following the Band
Strike, students were not mandated to sub
mit the music and scripts of their halftime
shows for reviews and thus exercised con
siderable creative reign.

Hal Mickelson'7l, who served as stadi
um announcer for 15 years and established
himself as an integral voice of the Band's
field shows, said that the Band focused on

Before the strike in 1963, the Stanford marching band was a traditional, all-male, Sousaplaying
marching band. After the strike, students took over and the Band began reflecting
the culture of the 1960s with a scatter band style and rock 'n' roll arrangements.
making formations that could fully illustrate
the joke.
"By the time I arrived in 1967, the forma
tions were the punch lines of jokes," Mickel
son said. "The combination of the visuals on
the field and the song titles were like a single
panel cartoon."
To facilitate the playing of music, band
members began "scattering," or running hap
hazardly between formations instead of march
ing in predetermined paths. According to
GoStanford.com, LSJUMB is one of just 10
known scatter bands at Division I schools.

"Equal opportunity offenders"
Talk to any "Old Fart," as Band alumni are
affectionately called, and he or she will regale
you with tales of most memorable Band antics
and field shows past. A significant amount of
these anecdotes display an obvious â€”if
provocative disregard for convention and
decorum, a not-unexpected trend given the
Band's proclivity for bold and impudent state
ments.

Sam Boot '7O, who served as properties

manager and played the trumpet in Band, re
called the 1970 Stanford-Arkansas football
game, in which during a Beach Boys-themed
half-time show, Stanford band members
dropped their pants on national television to
reveal surf jams underneath. Mickelson re
members announcing a "Death of Chairman
Mao" show at an away game at Penn State fol
lowing the death of the communist leader.
"I'd like to think we were narcissistically
clever... equal opportunity offenders, if you
will," said Ruiz, who fielded his fair share of
calls from disgruntled spectators during his
time as manager.

Perhaps few know controversy as well as
Louden, who served as drum major in 1990
during the Band's infamous University of Ore
gon halftime show, which spoofed the spotted
owl timber battle between the logging industry
and environmentalists. Formations included a
giant chainsaw and band members re-forming
the word "OWL' to "AWOL' on the field. Fol
lowing the inevitable backlash, the governor of
Oregon attempted to ban the Band from the
state of Oregon (he failed).

Louden noted the environment that the
Band was operating in became much more re
strictive in the 19905, attributing the increas
ing cries of outrage to the growth of a more
conservative society and the "politics of being
offended."
Though the Band was and still is no
stranger to controversy, its alumni are quick to
defend its sometimes-divisive antics, arguing
that the Band's intentions are often miscon
strued and not politically charged.
"The Band is incredibly clever and slightly
controversial and not specific as to whom we
might offend," Ruiz explained. "Truth is, most
of the halftime shows and music were done by
a volunteer group coming from all spectrums
of society, from athletes to ROTC students.
Band was a safe haven from life and its stres
sors, where we lost all sense of individual poli
tics and religion and used our alter egos to ex
press ourselves."
The Band plays on
As the Band celebrates its 50th-year re
union since the Band Strike of '63, the red
blazer-clad, white-golf hat-sporting members of
Band continue to carry on the carousing spirit
and mischievous legacy of their predecessors.
Mickelson describes the evolution of the
Band in the past 50 years as one of "breathtak
ing consistency."
"The personalities of student organiza
tions turnover fast when new people come
over," he explained. "What is remarkable and
dazzling is that the personality of the band has
n't changed at all. The same kind of jokes, hu
mor, irreverence and attitude towards authori

ty hasn't changed. Band's sense of humor has
been consistent over 50 years."
"Youth is for the youthful," Ruiz said. "The
band has continued to reflect the contempo
rary Stanford culture. The Band is what it is.
It's a reflection of Stanford whenever one hap
pens to be in it, so it continues to accomplish
its mission."
