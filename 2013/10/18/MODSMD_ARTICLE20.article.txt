# Exhibit captures facial "Rapture"

Forty-five new color photo
graphs by Joel Leivick grace the
walls of Stanford's Thomas Wel
ton Art Gallery as part of his
new exhibit, "The Rapture."
This engaging and thought-pro
voking collection features a vari
ety of candid portraits of visitors
at one of Rome's most famous
tourist locations, The Pantheon.
Leivick, the Robert and
Ruth Halperin professor in pho
tography, has been with the De
partment of Art & Art History at
Stanford since 1981. He has al
so participated in a variety of so
lo and group shows in the Bay
Area, including at the San Fran
cisco Museum of Modern Art,
the Scott Nichols Gallery (also
located in San Francisco) and
the Santa Cruz Museum of Art
and History. His work has also
been exhibited in several out-of
state galleries, such as the Blue
Sky Gallery in Portland, Ore.,
and the Emory University Art
Gallery.

Leivick's new exhibition is a
departure both visually and con
ceptually from his previous
work. Before "The Rapture," he
worked in large-format black
and white landscapes and out
door scenes, all very rich in tex
ture; yet, what interested
Leivick the most at the Pan
theon were the visitors all
around him. Over the course of
four days last fall, he took a se
ries of candid photos using a
Sony digital camera.
While simpler in both tex
ture and composition than his
previous work, the beautifully lit
and color-saturated photographs
of "The Rapture" present an in
teresting contrast between old
and new: the visitors, armed
with their cameras, cell phones
and iPods, against the building's
ancient stone walls.

Though Leivick lays no
claims that, through his photo
graphs, he has come to "know"
any of these people, the images

evoke a certain intimacy a con
nection between viewer and subject
that makes you want to keep look
ing that makes you feel like you
could know these people, too. The
subjects of Leivick's photos come

from all walks of life men,
women, adults and children alike
but the looks of concentration and
awe spread across each face create a
peculiar feeling of commonality.
As I walked through the
gallery looking at the photographs
on the walls, I couldn't help but no
tice the same expressions of the
photo subjects reflected in the
faces of everyone at the exhibit's

reception. Leivick's photos remind
us that, as humans, we all strive to
find meaning in beauty. Just as the
Pantheon visitors screw up their
faces in concentration as they gaze
through the oculus in search of
some profound experience, so do
we at Leivik's photos of them.
