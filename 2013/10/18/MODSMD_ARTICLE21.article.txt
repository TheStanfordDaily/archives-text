# TIDBITS WITH: The Stanford DOLLIES
## 
### RENJIE WONG DESK EDITOR 
The Dollies are a Stanford insti
tution. Actually, scrap that
they're a national staple. Since the
19505, they have been setting fields
and hearts across the land afire with
their hotter-than-sr/rac/za hijinks. Af
ter all, what would the Rose Parade
have been without our glamour girls
leading the way? Would ESPN still
be in business without these sizzling
sirens? Most importantly, would
America even be a global political
powerhouse without the Cardinal
queens of choreography?
We think not. Which is why, for
our inaugural Tidbits With, we sit
down with the five divas Lindsay
Fiorentino 'l6, Leigh Kinney 'l6,
Heather Glenny 'l6, Courtney Yang
'l6 and Amelia Chen 'l6 to talk
about such pressing issues of culinary
importance as kale chips, ice cream
filled donuts and Love Bitches.

What is the Dollies' preferred
Bay Area restaurant?
Dollies love going out to eat, but re
ally, at the end of the day, it's home
cooking that takes the cake. (No, lit
erally. Usually a red velvet cake.) If
we absolutely had to pick, though,
our favorite place is Jimmy V Sports
Cafe, which is conveniently enough
right on campus. The mocha shakes
are amazing, but it's really that
peanut butter banana milkshake that
keeps us coming back for more.

What is the go-to recipe for the
Dollies?

Kale chips! Rub olive oil into pieces
of raw kale, spread them on a cookie
sheet and sprinkle with salt, pepper,
cumin, garlic and any other spices
you love. Bake at 350 Â°F for about
15 minutes or so, until they become
all crisp and the edges slightly
browned. It's so tasty, even Lindsay
who is strictly anti-vegetables
is a huge fan.
Thai or Mediterranean?

Thai, duh. As part of our extensive
food research we've tried both Siam
Royal and Oren's Hummus on Uni
versity Avenue, and Thai unani-
