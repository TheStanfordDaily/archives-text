# Roxy Sass: Full Moon on the Quad Cheat Sheet
## 
### ROXY SASS 
This coming week, Roxy is looking forward to what
might be her all-time favorite event at Stanford: Full
Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ). It's the one night
when it is socially acceptable to kiss as many people
as you want, no matter his or her age (Roxy is not
afraid to dabble in a bit of cradle robbing). Now, we
all know that studying is not Roxy's main activity on campus,
but this is one cheat sheet she is happy to spend some time
working on. Voila, Roxy Sass' FMOTQ bingo board!

Flere are a few of her top targets:
1. One person from each class ('l4 all the way down to ' 17,
but, please, stop before Paly)
2. The Tree (or just a tree ...)
3. A football player (Roxy can make him forget all about Utah
... too soon?)
4. Someone who hasn't taken CSIO6A (this one might be
hard ... if you know what Roxy means)
5. A sober monitor (Roxy likes to reward responsible behav
ior, especially when she is not engaging in it)
6. Tan-bark Joseph (or just someone who smells like apples
...)
7. Someone who might take winter quarter off to work on
his or her startup (quick, wouldn't want to miss out on
that...)
8. That bi-curious friend you've always secretly wanted to
experiment with
9. Someone who swore he or she was only coming to watch
10. A senior humanities major (what follows might be the
only "job" he or she will get this year)

If you think you meet any of these requirements, hit Roxy up at
life@stanforddaily.com ...or just find her on the quad Tuesday
night. She's ready to give you b-i-n-g-ohhhh.
