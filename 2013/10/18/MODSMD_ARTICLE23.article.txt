# U.N. film fest features Farm alums
## Festival's picks focus on "individuals and universal" 
### SOFIA ALEXANDRA FILIPPA 
The 16th United Nations Associ
ation Film Festival (UNAFF) will be
held from Oct. 17-27 at several Bay
Area locations, including Palo Alto
and Stanford University.
The theme for this year's festival
is "individual to universal," featuring a
total of 70 international and national
film documentaries dealing with a
myriad of topics, such as human
rights, poverty, LGBTQ issues, envi
ronmental policy and education.
There are several promising
works being shown at the festival. A
talented list of filmmakers is attend
ing the event, including Academy
Award nominees Mark Kitchell and
Connie Field. What's more, six mem
bers of the Stanford community are
screening their films in this year's fes
tival, including Jan Krawitz, a profes
sor of art and art history, Charlene
Music M.F.A 'O9 and Anne Make
peace '69 M.A. '7l M.F.A. 'B2.
Krawitz is presenting her film
"Perfect Strangers." It is the account
of Ellie, a woman who altruistically
decides to donate her kidney to

Kathy, a woman she has never met.
The documentary presents a curious,
unusual case of human kindness, and,
at the same time, it raises awareness
about the current situation of organ
donation in our country. With various
artistic film shots and scenes, Krawitz
truly manages to capture the essence
behind each person, providing some
interesting food for thought.
Historical figures are also fea
tured in UNAFF's films. Makepeace
directed and produced "Eleanor Roo
sevelt: Close to Home," which is
planned to be screened at the film's
opening night in Aquarius Theatre in
Palo Alto. Although a bit too short, it
does a good job of introducing the
story of the prominent First Lady and
her extensive political and social ac
tivism throughout her life. It leaves
the viewer wishing for deeper detail;
a lengthier account would do more
justice to this captivating film work.
"Alias Ruby Blade: A Story of
Love and Revolution," directed and
produced by British-American couple
Alex and Tanya Meillier, is also being
featured at the opening night. This
film presents the breathtaking story
of Australian activist Kirsty Sword,
who was a secret informant during
the East Timor revolution. She collab
orates with Kay Rala Xanana Gusmao,

the revolution leader, and the two un
expectedly fall in love. The intense
scenes make the viewer feel the ten
sion as their own, living the action
through the eyes of brave Kirsty.
Thrilling emotions, suspense and in
trigue are just a few of the themes
that describe this excellent documen
tary.

Other highly anticipated films in
clude "Familia Ayara," a Colombian-
Spanish production. The film is about
the inspiring Don Popo and how he
founded an organization that provides
support through hip-hop for children
who have been mentally, sexually or
physically abused. Also, do not miss
the "Nowhere to Run" animated se
ries, an IrakyTurkey/U.S. original cre
ation that deals with LGBTQ issues in
refugee communities around the
world.

Tickets can be purchased at
Tresidder Union at Stanford Universi
ty or at the United Nations Associa
tion gift shop in Palo Alto. Same-day
tickets are free for students with a
valid I.D and for seniors (62+).
