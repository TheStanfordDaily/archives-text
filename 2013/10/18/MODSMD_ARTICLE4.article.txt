# Alumni celebrate 50 years of LSJUMB
## 
### DANIA MARINSHAW 
The Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band (LSJUMB) has invit
ed all Band alumni back to the Farm for
Homecoming this weekend to honor
their contribution to 50 years of music,
spirit and tradition on Stanford's cam
pus.

Aimed at honoring the student
group's colorful history and reuniting a
substantial alumni network, the reunion
is a product of a multi-year collaboration
between current staff and the Band
Alumni Board.

"My favorite part of events like
these is when two people who haven't
seen each other in two decades are able
to feel like they're right where they left
off —which in our case may be in the
middle of the football field," said Yanessa
Lasley, who coordinated the event.
Lasley tackled registration, event
communication and game-day logistics
leading up to this weekend, all on top of
a full-time engineering job in San Francis
co. She is not a Stanford alumna, but
agreed to help organize the event be
cause she has a large number of friends
that are or were in Band.

"The hardest part has definitely
been communication," said Lasley, who
has fielded dozens of emails a day in
preparation. "We have a lot of people
asking a lot of questions, and it's been
hard to make sure everything gets an
swered."

Over 500 former LSJUMB members
are expected to attend the reunion.
When friends and family members are
factored in, attendance may reach close
to 800 individuals.

"The number is really astonishing,"
said Hal Mickelson '7l, an alumni coor
dinator who has remained closely in
volved with the Band since joining as a
stadium announcer in 1969. According
to Mickelson, the assembled Band popu
lation may exceed that of many class re
unions also taking place this weekend.

The reunion festivities kick off Fri
day night with an alumni banquet at the
Decathalon Club in Sunnyvale, Calif.,
where a slideshow of 50 years of
LSJUMB history will accompany an

evening of dining and dancing. Satur
day's football game against UCLA is the
main event of the weekend, followed by
a LSJUMB alumni tailgate.
According to Molly Cain 'l5, one of
the Band's alumni relations chairs, any
alumnus who wants to play alongside
current students at the game is welcome
to do so. While many plan to attend only
the Friday evening event or the post
game tailgate, the staff anticipates
around 400 extra bodies on the field Sat
urday.

To prepare alumni for the halftime
show during Saturday's football game
against UCLA, music and formation re
hearsals are planned for Friday afternoon
and Saturday morning.
Along with Cain and the rest of cur
rent Band staff, three volunteer coordina
tors — Lasley, Kimberly Myers Hewlett
'99 and Tanicia Perry '99 have helped
direct the reunion's planning.
Additional help came from ex-LJ
SUMB members on the reunion sub
committee of the Stanford Band Alumni
Board, which functioned as an advising
group for the students throughout the
organizing process.

Though he stressed that the volun
teer coordinators and student staff han
dled most of the responsibility for the re
union planning, Greg Louden 'B9 M.A.
'9O, chair of the Band Alumni Board, has
had this weekend on his mind for years.
"At one point, I looked up and
thought, 'Wait a minute, we're five years
away from the 50th anniversary of creat
ing the modern Band,"' Louden said.
With this in mind, Louden and other
Band Alumni Board members adjusted
their planning efforts after the 2007 re
union. Rather than stick to what was a
typical schedule of one reunion every
four years, they elected to shift plans to
allow for a reunion exactly 50 years after
the group's beginnings.
The fall of 1963 was the beginning
of a momentous year for LSJUMB, as it
marked the Band's transition to the non
traditional music, dress and attitude that
define the group today. The Band went
on strike after the former director was
