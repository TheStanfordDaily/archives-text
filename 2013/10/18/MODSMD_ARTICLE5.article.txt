# Behind the Scenes
## The
						ins and outs of a field show

Standing atop a mobile tower, overlooking a grass field
and its current congregation of around 50 Stanford stu
dents, Giancarlo Aquilanti D.MA '96 introduces himself.
Most of the ground-level crowd already knows the
man with the microphone and scream out his name ("Gian

Aquilanti laughs and presses on, sharing that he is a

Before the fluorescent Stanford Stadium lights go on,
the Band members are getting prepped at Friday afternoon
field rehearsal.

"There are some formalities that we have to take care
of at the beginning," Aquilanti says, acknowledging the new

as the trumpet player continues his solo.
Fierro finishes without missing a note.
"That is the formality," Aquilanti says, after the ritual
has concluded. "Now, we have to do something that's not a
formality: tuning."

Funny, Gross or Both
When Aquilanti warned the new members they were
about to see something that's sometimes "funny," some
times "gross" and sometimes "both," he was referring to
the group's long-running tradition of putting the trumpet
soloist through a minor form of torture during field re
hearsals leading up to a football game. The idea is that if the
soloist can perform during rehearsals under somewhat
harsh conditions, he can perform at showtime, even when
thousands of spectators' eyes are directed towards him.
But the remark could just as easily apply to the entire
