# Behind the Scenes
## The 						ins and outs of a field show 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Standing atop a mobile tower, overlooking a grass field
and its current congregation of around 50 Stanford stu
dents, Giancarlo Aquilanti D.MA '96 introduces himself.
Most of the ground-level crowd already knows the
man with the microphone and scream out his name ("Gian
carlo!") before he has a chance to introduce himself.
Aquilanti laughs and presses on, sharing that he is a
music professor and conductor of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University Marching Band (LSJUMB). He makes the an
nouncement mostly for the sake of the crowd's freshmen,
who will be performing, for their first time, as LSUMB
members the following evening at the Oct. 6 football game
against the University of Washington.
Before the fluorescent Stanford Stadium lights go on,
the Band members are getting prepped at Friday afternoon
field rehearsal.

"There are some formalities that we have to take care
of at the beginning," Aquilanti says, acknowledging the new
comers. "Sometimes, they're funny. Sometimes, they're
gross. Sometimes, they're both."

On this note, trumpet section leader Kyle Fierro 'l4
walks forward, instrument in hand, and stops near the base
of the tower. The rest of the Band forms a circle around Fier
ro, who begins playing his opening trumpet solo of "The
Star-Spangled Banner." All seems ordinary until a Band
member returns, bearing a padded jousting stick. This sec
ond member proceeds to strike Fierro with the toy weapon,
as the trumpet player continues his solo.
Fierro finishes without missing a note.
"That is the formality," Aquilanti says, after the ritual
has concluded. "Now, we have to do something that's not a
formality: tuning."

Funny, Gross or Both
When Aquilanti warned the new members they were
about to see something that's sometimes "funny," some
times "gross" and sometimes "both," he was referring to
the group's long-running tradition of putting the trumpet
soloist through a minor form of torture during field re
hearsals leading up to a football game. The idea is that if the
soloist can perform during rehearsals under somewhat
harsh conditions, he can perform at showtime, even when
thousands of spectators' eyes are directed towards him.
But the remark could just as easily apply to the entire
Band: It's sometimes funny, sometimes gross, and
at its best, both.
A scatter band differs from most university
marching bands in that members are not assigned
marching routes or individual positions during
field shows. Instead, they stand and perform in
loose formations, which spell out words and make
images.

For LSJUMB members, being in a scatter
band means technical precision becomes less im
portant than other attributes such as humor, free
spiritedness, confidence, inclusivity and overall
fun. The group's pregame and halftime shows, for
instance, often double as comedic sketches.

Give 'em a show
Andrew Kleinschmidt' 14 and Matt Appleby
'l5 bear ultimate creative responsibility for the
Band's field shows. Both share the position of
"Graphix."
"We're kind of the overarching controller of the
field shows from start to finish," Appelby said.
He proceeded to detail their responsibili
ties, which include choosing a staff of writers, se
lecting the theme for each show, working with
writers to complete (or write for themselves) the
scripts, bringing these scripts to a University re
view committee for approval, designing field
charts and running rehearsals.
But Kleinschmidt and Appleby both said
they love their job. They excitedly discussed the
genesis of the field shows for the University of
Washington game.
The first idea came during the summer,
when they heard Stanford Stadium would be in
troducing closed captioning to the Band's field
performances this season.
"Somebody told us that, and we thought, 'lt
would be funny if we wrote a show about us
finding out that there's closed captioning now,'"
Appleby said. "We wrote that actually a long
time ago, and kept revising it in the weeks after
that."

The second idea came more serendipitous
ly. Kleinschmidt said he brainstormed a list of
everything he associated with the state of Wash
ington. The Space Needle, Nirvana, grunge and
Starbucks all appeared on the paper before he
happened to write the line: "Washington, you
look great in your snazzy purple uniforms."
Kleinschmidt said he first considered writ
ing just about the purple uniforms, but then re
called a previous conversation about how ridicu
lous Arizona State's uniforms are.
"I [also] think Oregon's uniforms are just in

herently funny, so I decided, 'Why don't we just
do the Pac-12 Fashion Review?'" Kleinschmidt
described.

Presenting the scripts to the University re
view committee, which includes officials from
Student Affairs and the Department of Athletics,
went well, according to Appleby. Initially, the
committee was formed to prevent obscene or
offensive material from making it into the Band's
field shows. In recent years, however, the Band
and the committee members have become
more like collaborative partners.
"They'll tell us what parts of it would be of
concern to them, but once that's been voiced, it
sort of turns into: 'How can we make this fun
nier?' 'How can we approve it given the current
events that are happening right now?"' Appleby
said.

According to Kleinschmidt, the committee
did have one concern before the Washington
game: The original script included several jokes
about the University of Oregon's uniforms,
which are manufactured by Nike. It turned out
that Nike co-founder and chairman Phil Knight
MBA '62, the man who also donated $lO5 mil
lion to construct a new campus for the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, would be attend
ing the Saturday game.
"We couldn't be insulting a potential donor
at a game that he was going to be at," Appleby
said.

University officials recommended they
move their satirical gaze to USC. Kleinschmidt
and Appelby said they saw plenty of comedic ma
terial in the substitution, so they decided to ac
commodate the suggestion.

Leader of the Band
Annalise Lockhart 'l4 first visited California
during her own Admit Weekend. She said prior
to her flight from New York, she was concerned
whether or not she would fit in on The Farm.
Those fears dissipated, however, as soon she saw
the Stanford Band perform during an event for
prospective freshmen.
"I was really worried about what Stanford's
like," Lockhard said. "Then, I saw the Band play
ing in the Admit Weekend rally, and I knew there
would be weird people here that I can bond
with."

Nearly four years later, she's now drum ma
jor, a position also known as Band's "spiritual
leader." For each field show, she's responsible for
choosing the song list, cutting down songs for
time, leading a portion of rehearsals and also, as
the public face of the Band, creating an elaborate
costume to wear. She has an office in the Band
Shak crammed with sequins, hot glue guns, rib
bons and old outfits for the last task.

"The Band major should be a figure that

changes constantly and is constantly pushing up
against what a leader's like," Lockhart said.
"Sometimes, I try to be really intense, almost met
al-like, but then at other times, really goofy, and I
think a leader can be those things. My costume
choices try to reflect that: switching around a lot."
For the Washington game, Lockhart decided
to dress as Marie Antoinette.

"Last game before, I was Thor, which is first
of all, a man, but also a male god," Lockhart said.
"This week, I wanted to do something that was
flipping it completely: being very feminine, but al
so being a feminine symbol of power."
According to Lockhart, there's an unwritten
rule amongst former drum majors that a costume
will never be repeated. She said costumes ideas
must be checked through a message to an email
list to which all previous drum majors are sub
scribed.

She hasn't run into too many problems with
already-used costume ideas so far, but it helps that
she is only the sixth female drum major in the 50-
year history of LSJUMB.
"A lot of guy drum majors cross-dress, but
there's still many female characters throughout
history and media that have not been done be
fore," Lockhart said.

Ready for Homecoming
Just minutes after LSJUMB took the field for
their halftime show at the Washington game, a
Band alumnus sent an email to the entire group.
He quite simply wrote: "That show was pretty ter
rible. Please be funnier."

Kleinschmidt and Appleby agreed that reac
tion to their Washington field performances was
mixed, saying they knew the closed captioning
show in particular was going to be "hit-or-miss"
with the audience because of its absurdist humor.
They added, however, that the Band is usually its
own worst critics.

"We get feedback from the Band pretty di
rectly," Kleinschmidt said.
That makes their next task—writing a field
show for the Band's 50th anniversary this Satur
day — even more difficult.
"Basically, for this reunion show, it feels like
we have to be funny, we also have to be historical
and we also have to represent the Band in a some
what-good way," Appleby said.
"It's an interesting mixture of people we are
trying to please," Kleinschmidt added.
Still, the two said they're up for the chal
lenge.
"It's going to be a mess, but it's going to be
a great mess—a glorious mess," Kleinschmidt
said.

And LSJUMB wouldn't have it any other way.

He proceeded to detail their responsibili
ties, which include choosing a staff of writers, se
lecting the theme for each show, working with
writers to complete (or write for themselves) the
scripts, bringing these scripts to a University re
view committee for approval, designing field
charts and running rehearsals.
But Kleinschmidt and Appleby both said
they love their job. They excitedly discussed the
genesis of the field shows for the University of
Washington game.
The first idea came during the summer,
when they heard Stanford Stadium would be in
troducing closed captioning to the Band's field
performances this season.
"Somebody told us that, and we thought, 'lt
would be funny if we wrote a show about us
finding out that there's closed captioning now,'"
Appleby said. "We wrote that actually a long
time ago, and kept revising it in the weeks after
that."

The second idea came more serendipitous
ly. Kleinschmidt said he brainstormed a list of
everything he associated with the state of Wash
ington. The Space Needle, Nirvana, grunge and
Starbucks all appeared on the paper before he
happened to write the line: "Washington, you
look great in your snazzy purple uniforms."
Kleinschmidt said he first considered writ
ing just about the purple uniforms, but then re
called a previous conversation about how ridicu
lous Arizona State's uniforms are.
"I [also] think Oregon's uniforms are just in

herently funny, so I decided, 'Why don't we just
do the Pac-12 Fashion Review?'" Kleinschmidt
described.

Presenting the scripts to the University re
view committee, which includes officials from
Student Affairs and the Department of Athletics,
went well, according to Appleby. Initially, the
committee was formed to prevent obscene or
offensive material from making it into the Band's
field shows. In recent years, however, the Band
and the committee members have become
more like collaborative partners.
"They'll tell us what parts of it would be of
concern to them, but once that's been voiced, it
sort of turns into: 'How can we make this fun
nier?' 'How can we approve it given the current
events that are happening right now?"' Appleby
said.

According to Kleinschmidt, the committee
did have one concern before the Washington
game: The original script included several jokes
about the University of Oregon's uniforms,
which are manufactured by Nike. It turned out
that Nike co-founder and chairman Phil Knight
MBA '62, the man who also donated $lO5 mil
lion to construct a new campus for the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, would be attend
ing the Saturday game.
"We couldn't be insulting a potential donor
at a game that he was going to be at," Appleby
said.

University officials recommended they
move their satirical gaze to USC. Kleinschmidt
and Appelby said they saw plenty of comedic ma
terial in the substitution, so they decided to ac
commodate the suggestion.

Leader of the Band
Annalise Lockhart 'l4 first visited California
during her own Admit Weekend. She said prior
to her flight from New York, she was concerned
whether or not she would fit in on The Farm.
Those fears dissipated, however, as soon she saw
the Stanford Band perform during an event for
prospective freshmen.
"I was really worried about what Stanford's
like," Lockhard said. "Then, I saw the Band play
ing in the Admit Weekend rally, and I knew there
would be weird people here that I can bond
with."

Nearly four years later, she's now drum ma
jor, a position also known as Band's "spiritual
leader." For each field show, she's responsible for
choosing the song list, cutting down songs for
time, leading a portion of rehearsals and also, as
the public face of the Band, creating an elaborate
costume to wear. She has an office in the Band
Shak crammed with sequins, hot glue guns, rib
bons and old outfits for the last task.

"The Band major should be a figure that

changes constantly and is constantly pushing up
against what a leader's like," Lockhart said.
"Sometimes, I try to be really intense, almost met
al-like, but then at other times, really goofy, and I
think a leader can be those things. My costume
choices try to reflect that: switching around a lot."
For the Washington game, Lockhart decided
to dress as Marie Antoinette.

"Last game before, I was Thor, which is first
of all, a man, but also a male god," Lockhart said.
"This week, I wanted to do something that was
flipping it completely: being very feminine, but al
so being a feminine symbol of power."
According to Lockhart, there's an unwritten
rule amongst former drum majors that a costume
will never be repeated. She said costumes ideas
must be checked through a message to an email
list to which all previous drum majors are sub
scribed.

She hasn't run into too many problems with
already-used costume ideas so far, but it helps that
she is only the sixth female drum major in the 50-
year history of LSJUMB.
"A lot of guy drum majors cross-dress, but
there's still many female characters throughout
history and media that have not been done be
fore," Lockhart said.

Ready for Homecoming
Just minutes after LSJUMB took the field for
their halftime show at the Washington game, a
Band alumnus sent an email to the entire group.
He quite simply wrote: "That show was pretty ter
rible. Please be funnier."

Kleinschmidt and Appleby agreed that reac
tion to their Washington field performances was
mixed, saying they knew the closed captioning
show in particular was going to be "hit-or-miss"
with the audience because of its absurdist humor.
They added, however, that the Band is usually its
own worst critics.

"We get feedback from the Band pretty di
rectly," Kleinschmidt said.
That makes their next task—writing a field
show for the Band's 50th anniversary this Satur
day — even more difficult.
"Basically, for this reunion show, it feels like
we have to be funny, we also have to be historical
and we also have to represent the Band in a some
what-good way," Appleby said.
"It's an interesting mixture of people we are
trying to please," Kleinschmidt added.
Still, the two said they're up for the chal
lenge.
"It's going to be a mess, but it's going to be
a great mess—a glorious mess," Kleinschmidt
said.

And LSJUMB wouldn't have it any other way.

Standing atop a mobile tower, overlooking a grass field
and its current congregation of around 50 Stanford stu
dents, Giancarlo Aquilanti D.MA '96 introduces himself.
Most of the ground-level crowd already knows the
man with the microphone and scream out his name ("Gian
carlo!") before he has a chance to introduce himself.
Aquilanti laughs and presses on, sharing that he is a
music professor and conductor of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University Marching Band (LSJUMB). He makes the an
nouncement mostly for the sake of the crowd's freshmen,
who will be performing, for their first time, as LSUMB
members the following evening at the Oct. 6 football game
against the University of Washington.
Before the fluorescent Stanford Stadium lights go on,
the Band members are getting prepped at Friday afternoon
field rehearsal.

"There are some formalities that we have to take care
of at the beginning," Aquilanti says, acknowledging the new
comers. "Sometimes, they're funny. Sometimes, they're
gross. Sometimes, they're both."

On this note, trumpet section leader Kyle Fierro 'l4
walks forward, instrument in hand, and stops near the base
of the tower. The rest of the Band forms a circle around Fier
ro, who begins playing his opening trumpet solo of "The
Star-Spangled Banner." All seems ordinary until a Band
member returns, bearing a padded jousting stick. This sec
ond member proceeds to strike Fierro with the toy weapon,
as the trumpet player continues his solo.
Fierro finishes without missing a note.
"That is the formality," Aquilanti says, after the ritual
has concluded. "Now, we have to do something that's not a
formality: tuning."

Funny, Gross or Both
When Aquilanti warned the new members they were
about to see something that's sometimes "funny," some
times "gross" and sometimes "both," he was referring to
the group's long-running tradition of putting the trumpet
soloist through a minor form of torture during field re
hearsals leading up to a football game. The idea is that if the
soloist can perform during rehearsals under somewhat
harsh conditions, he can perform at showtime, even when
thousands of spectators' eyes are directed towards him.
But the remark could just as easily apply to the entire
Band: It's sometimes funny, sometimes gross, and
at its best, both.
A scatter band differs from most university
marching bands in that members are not assigned
marching routes or individual positions during
field shows. Instead, they stand and perform in
loose formations, which spell out words and make
images.

For LSJUMB members, being in a scatter
band means technical precision becomes less im
portant than other attributes such as humor, free
spiritedness, confidence, inclusivity and overall
fun. The group's pregame and halftime shows, for
instance, often double as comedic sketches.

Give 'em a show
Andrew Kleinschmidt' 14 and Matt Appleby
'l5 bear ultimate creative responsibility for the
Band's field shows. Both share the position of
"Graphix."
"We're kind of the overarching controller of the
field shows from start to finish," Appelby said.

whether or not she would fit in on The Farm.
Those fears dissipated, however, as soon she saw
the Stanford Band perform during an event for
prospective freshmen.
"I was really worried about what Stanford's
like," Lockhard said. "Then, I saw the Band play
ing in the Admit Weekend rally, and I knew there
would be weird people here that I can bond
with."

Nearly four years later, she's now drum ma
jor, a position also known as Band's "spiritual
leader." For each field show, she's responsible for
choosing the song list, cutting down songs for
time, leading a portion of rehearsals and also, as
the public face of the Band, creating an elaborate
costume to wear. She has an office in the Band
Shak crammed with sequins, hot glue guns, rib
bons and old outfits for the last task.

"The Band major should be a figure that

changes constantly and is constantly pushing up
against what a leader's like," Lockhart said.
"Sometimes, I try to be really intense, almost met
al-like, but then at other times, really goofy, and I
think a leader can be those things. My costume
choices try to reflect that: switching around a lot."
For the Washington game, Lockhart decided
to dress as Marie Antoinette.

"Last game before, I was Thor, which is first
of all, a man, but also a male god," Lockhart said.
"This week, I wanted to do something that was
flipping it completely: being very feminine, but al
so being a feminine symbol of power."
According to Lockhart, there's an unwritten
rule amongst former drum majors that a costume
will never be repeated. She said costumes ideas
must be checked through a message to an email
list to which all previous drum majors are sub
scribed.

She hasn't run into too many problems with
already-used costume ideas so far, but it helps that
she is only the sixth female drum major in the 50-
year history of LSJUMB.
"A lot of guy drum majors cross-dress, but
there's still many female characters throughout
history and media that have not been done be
fore," Lockhart said.

Ready for Homecoming
Just minutes after LSJUMB took the field for
their halftime show at the Washington game, a
Band alumnus sent an email to the entire group.
He quite simply wrote: "That show was pretty ter
rible. Please be funnier."

Kleinschmidt and Appleby agreed that reac
tion to their Washington field performances was
mixed, saying they knew the closed captioning
show in particular was going to be "hit-or-miss"
with the audience because of its absurdist humor.
They added, however, that the Band is usually its
own worst critics.

"We get feedback from the Band pretty di
rectly," Kleinschmidt said.
That makes their next task—writing a field
show for the Band's 50th anniversary this Satur
day — even more difficult.
"Basically, for this reunion show, it feels like
we have to be funny, we also have to be historical
and we also have to represent the Band in a some
what-good way," Appleby said.
"It's an interesting mixture of people we are
trying to please," Kleinschmidt added.
Still, the two said they're up for the chal
lenge.
"It's going to be a mess, but it's going to be
a great mess—a glorious mess," Kleinschmidt
said.

And LSJUMB wouldn't have it any other way.

Standing atop a mobile tower, overlooking a grass field
and its current congregation of around 50 Stanford stu
dents, Giancarlo Aquilanti D.MA '96 introduces himself.
Most of the ground-level crowd already knows the
man with the microphone and scream out his name ("Gian
carlo!") before he has a chance to introduce himself.
Aquilanti laughs and presses on, sharing that he is a
music professor and conductor of the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University Marching Band (LSJUMB). He makes the an
nouncement mostly for the sake of the crowd's freshmen,
who will be performing, for their first time, as LSUMB
members the following evening at the Oct. 6 football game
against the University of Washington.
Before the fluorescent Stanford Stadium lights go on,
the Band members are getting prepped at Friday afternoon
field rehearsal.

"There are some formalities that we have to take care
of at the beginning," Aquilanti says, acknowledging the new
comers. "Sometimes, they're funny. Sometimes, they're
gross. Sometimes, they're both."

On this note, trumpet section leader Kyle Fierro 'l4
walks forward, instrument in hand, and stops near the base
of the tower. The rest of the Band forms a circle around Fier
ro, who begins playing his opening trumpet solo of "The
Star-Spangled Banner." All seems ordinary until a Band
member returns, bearing a padded jousting stick. This sec
ond member proceeds to strike Fierro with the toy weapon,
as the trumpet player continues his solo.
Fierro finishes without missing a note.
"That is the formality," Aquilanti says, after the ritual
has concluded. "Now, we have to do something that's not a
formality: tuning."

Funny, Gross or Both
When Aquilanti warned the new members they were
about to see something that's sometimes "funny," some
times "gross" and sometimes "both," he was referring to
the group's long-running tradition of putting the trumpet
soloist through a minor form of torture during field re
hearsals leading up to a football game. The idea is that if the
soloist can perform during rehearsals under somewhat
harsh conditions, he can perform at showtime, even when
thousands of spectators' eyes are directed towards him.
But the remark could just as easily apply to the entire
Band: It's sometimes funny, sometimes gross, and
at its best, both.
A scatter band differs from most university
marching bands in that members are not assigned
marching routes or individual positions during
field shows. Instead, they stand and perform in
loose formations, which spell out words and make
images.

For LSJUMB members, being in a scatter
band means technical precision becomes less im
portant than other attributes such as humor, free
spiritedness, confidence, inclusivity and overall
fun. The group's pregame and halftime shows, for
instance, often double as comedic sketches.

Give 'em a show
Andrew Kleinschmidt' 14 and Matt Appleby
'l5 bear ultimate creative responsibility for the
Band's field shows. Both share the position of
"Graphix."
"We're kind of the overarching controller of the
field shows from start to finish," Appelby said.
He proceeded to detail their responsibili
ties, which include choosing a staff of writers, se
lecting the theme for each show, working with
writers to complete (or write for themselves) the
scripts, bringing these scripts to a University re
view committee for approval, designing field
charts and running rehearsals.
But Kleinschmidt and Appleby both said
they love their job. They excitedly discussed the
genesis of the field shows for the University of
Washington game.
The first idea came during the summer,
when they heard Stanford Stadium would be in
troducing closed captioning to the Band's field
performances this season.
"Somebody told us that, and we thought, 'lt
would be funny if we wrote a show about us
finding out that there's closed captioning now,'"
Appleby said. "We wrote that actually a long
time ago, and kept revising it in the weeks after
that."

The second idea came more serendipitous
ly. Kleinschmidt said he brainstormed a list of
everything he associated with the state of Wash
ington. The Space Needle, Nirvana, grunge and
Starbucks all appeared on the paper before he
happened to write the line: "Washington, you
look great in your snazzy purple uniforms."
Kleinschmidt said he first considered writ
ing just about the purple uniforms, but then re
called a previous conversation about how ridicu
lous Arizona State's uniforms are.
"I [also] think Oregon's uniforms are just in

herently funny, so I decided, 'Why don't we just
do the Pac-12 Fashion Review?'" Kleinschmidt
described.

Presenting the scripts to the University re
view committee, which includes officials from
Student Affairs and the Department of Athletics,
went well, according to Appleby. Initially, the
committee was formed to prevent obscene or
offensive material from making it into the Band's
field shows. In recent years, however, the Band
and the committee members have become
more like collaborative partners.
"They'll tell us what parts of it would be of
concern to them, but once that's been voiced, it
sort of turns into: 'How can we make this fun
nier?' 'How can we approve it given the current
events that are happening right now?"' Appleby
said.

According to Kleinschmidt, the committee
did have one concern before the Washington
game: The original script included several jokes
about the University of Oregon's uniforms,
which are manufactured by Nike. It turned out
that Nike co-founder and chairman Phil Knight
MBA '62, the man who also donated $lO5 mil
lion to construct a new campus for the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, would be attend
ing the Saturday game.
"We couldn't be insulting a potential donor
at a game that he was going to be at," Appleby
said.

University officials recommended they
move their satirical gaze to USC. Kleinschmidt
and Appelby said they saw plenty of comedic ma
terial in the substitution, so they decided to ac
commodate the suggestion.

Leader of the Band
Annalise Lockhart 'l4 first visited California
during her own Admit Weekend. She said prior
to her flight from New York, she was concerned
whether or not she would fit in on The Farm.
Those fears dissipated, however, as soon she saw
the Stanford Band perform during an event for
prospective freshmen.
