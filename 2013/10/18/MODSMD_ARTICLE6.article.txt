# INJURY DERAILS
## DOLLIE DANCER 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
With a month of intensive training under their
belt and nearly 30 dances in their repertoire, the
2013-14 Stanford Dollies entered the season's first
football game against San Jose State with confidence,
excitement and lots of adrenaline.

"All of the previous Dollies had told us about
that first moment when you walk into the stadium,"
said Leigh Kinney 'l6, or "Dollie No. 3," as she is
known within the Band. "You are on the field and
you start to see all of the seats filling up. It's this
promising moment when you realize that this is your
time to shine."

Although the Dollies perform for almost every
different sport at some point during the year, football
season is the true cornerstone of their season.

"We had prepared for months and months and
just put our hearts and souls into this training," Kin
ney said. "We were totally ready... knowing that we
were there for a reason, we were there to support
the game and we were taking our presence as our
year for the Dollies."
The Dollies' evening began with the famous
"Come Join The Band" dance, and then moved
quickly into their pregame field show. The first song
of the show was a success and the Pac-12 Network
cameras centered on Kinney the entire time as
Dollie No. 3, she dances right in the middle.
The Dollies ran to the far side of the field to per
form their second dance, and returned to the stu
dent section for their third dance titled "Battle With
out Honor or Humanity."
It was during this song that the night took a hor
rible turn.

"We were halfway through the dance and I was
jumping left out of a double right pencil turn when
all of a sudden I heard this pop," Kinney said. "I fell
down and crumbled to the ground. My immediate
reaction was 'I can't believe I just fell in my first
pregame show,' so I tried to get back up as quickly as
possible."

"As soon as I stood up though, I realized I could
n't hold my weight. When I had heard the pop, I
knew something was wrong, but when I couldn't
even stand up, I knew something was terribly

wrong."
The football trainers at the stadium told Kinney
that she had a dislocated patella, but two days later,
she found out that she had torn her anterior crucial
ligament (ACL), a much more severe injury.
"When I heard [the news], I couldn't control
myself. I was sobbing uncontrollably on the doctor's
table," Kinney said.
The first decision Kinney faced was when to
have surgery.

Her doctor who also treated San Francisco
Giants catcher Buster Posey explained that he
sometimes prescribes athletes with aggressive phys
ical therapy and a special brace that allow them to
play their sport temporarily without an ACL as away
to avoid immediate surgery.
"At first, I was really willing to take that risk,"
Kinney said. "It gave me the option to still dance and
I felt like I could find the strength to compensate for
not having an ACL."
Despite the risks associated with dancing on a
torn ACL such as further damage to the knee, Kinney
was back at Stanford's next home football game on
Sept. 21. She was able to freestyle dance during
some of the songs and when she wasn't dancing, she
would step to the side and photograph the other Dol
lies performing.
"At first, it was kind of hard to watch them, be
cause I was watching them get to do everything that
I knew I should be able to do and should be doing
with them," Kinney said. "[But] I was pretty quickly
able to put that aside and realize how wonderful it
was that I had the opportunity to be there in the first
place."

As Kinney reached the end of her third week of
physical therapy, however, she decided to reconsider
her decision. She said that while she was be able to
do a lot of Dollie moves, she realized that her knee
was too weak to execute jumps, turns and kicks,
which are a huge portion of the Dollies' movement.
In late September, Kinney had a talk with the
other Dollies and Band Assistant Manager Ben
Rosenberg 'l4, about her next steps.
"I think I had been so excited about the option
of getting rid of my injury, that I forgot that I had a
body to think about and a future to think about,"
Kinney said. "Our talk got me more excited about

surgery and the prospect of being on the upward
trend and actually healing for good."
The four remaining Dollies, Amelia Chen 'l6,
Lindsay Fiorentino 'l6, Heather Glenny 'l6 and
Courtney Yang' 16, also had to decide how to adjust
moving forward and quickly, given a scheduled
performance at a volleyball game the following
week.

Whether or not to find an alternate Dollie or a
Dollie from the previous year to fill in became a point
of contention between old Dollies, band manage-
