# Misconduct alleged in Honor Code trials
## 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The Student Justice Project, a
group alleging the University has
subjected students to a biased judi
cial affairs process, has compiled tes
timonials from students, alumni and
counsel about the Office of Commu
nity Standards (OCS). The state
ments, released at a press confer
ence on Oct. 17, allege that the Uni
versity intimidated students charged
under the Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard in operating a bi
ased system that assumed guilt.
After releasing a 2011 case
study that alleged OCS violations of
the Student Judicial Charter of 1997
and misconduct on behalf of officials
assigned to Judicial Affairs cases, the
Student Justice Project raised issues
against the OCS including intimida
tion of witnesses, violation of stu
dent privacy and refusing to cooper
ate with students subsequent to
hearings.

Reid Spitz 'l4, the founder of
the Student Justice Project, outlines
two main missions for the organiza
tion to enforce the Student Char
ter of 1997, a document that defines
the handling of all judicial cases at
Stanford, and to educate the Stan
ford community about the "injus
tices that occur within the Office of
Community Standards."
The group has recruited Bob Ot
tilie '77, a San Diego-based attorney,
and is continuing to collect stories
from the Stanford community. Ot
tilie and a group of attorneys have
pledged to provide free legal counsel
to students going through the Judi-
cial Affairs process.
"Over the past few months, students,
alumni, representatives, parents and even
grandparents, have reached out to us to tell
us about their experiences with the OCS,"
Spitz said according to a prepared text.
"Each and every testimony describes the
plight of a Stanford student ... being rail
roaded through a fundamentally flawed
process with little to no regard for their
rights."

According to the statements released
by Spitz and Ottilie, students, parents and
counsel have accused the OCS of failing to
follow due process. Many allege that the
University and its officers denied Charter
guarantees like access to witnesses and legal
representation, and abused positions of
power to intimidate students.
"The 'neutral' Judicial Advisor in my
case co-authored a brief advocating for my
conviction," wrote an anonymous student

charged with an Honor Code violation in
2012. "The one person, whom I was told I
could trust, pretended to advise me confi
dentially before advocating for my convic
tion."
"My advisor threatened me with a Fun
damental Standard violation if I were to talk
to the other student involved in my case,"
wrote another student charged in 2013.
"He later co-authored a brief arguing for my
conviction."
"The staff involved showed a clear lack
of training and, consequently, have danger
ously interpreted sections of the Stanford
[Student] Judicial Charter to better suit
their needs," wrote Graham Gilmer 'O5, an
alumnus advisor to a student in the judicial
process. "I am absolutely confident that in
nocent students have been found guilty
through this slanted system."
