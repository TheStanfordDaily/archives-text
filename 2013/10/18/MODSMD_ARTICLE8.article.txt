## America's Exceptionally Sorry State 
### McKenzie Andrews 
My common app essay started with the line
"American by birth; Southern by the
grace of God." I keep a large American
flag in my dorm, and I regularly wear a
bro tank that sports Old Glory and reads "Back to
Back World War Champs." The Star Spangled Banner
is my favorite anthem: I'm proud to be an American.
At the beginning of this month, I was ready to
get a job. Not really, but as a Stanford sophomore, I
was ready to get some free start-up t-shirts and shot
glasses: aka, the Career Fair. I had some inkling I
should print some resumes after morning classes,
but instead I ate lunch and then biked over to White
Plaza.

When I got there, the first thing I did was go to
the map of attendees and find the U.S. State Depart
ment: table 105. They (and all y'all taxpayers) paid
for my gap year of Chinese study in Taiwan that fu
eled an interest in diplomacy in East Asia. When I
got to table 105, however, I was let down. On Oct.
1, 2013, the yellow slip of paper read, "The De
partment of State is not attending the fair today."
The U.S. Marines made it, but our civil servants
did not.

I love America, but I'm disappointed. A friend
of mine captured my sentiments well. "Our gener
ation, the millennials, continues to suffer from
short-term and ultimately self-destructive gover
nance of many of the Baby Boomers. Our country,
in every facet from global credibility, economic sta
bility, education, infrastructure, healthcare, etc., is
at risk for our future."

In my opinion, the United States is the best and
most influential country in the world, but we're
suffering from a dearth in leadership. The political
motivations that have gotten us to this point reflect
hubris that sacrifices cooperation. We through
our elected politicians have brought the inter
national ridicule over the state of the United States
on ourselves.

To make things worse, the domestic chicken
dance in Washington over the debt ceiling (which,
until an 11th hour conclusion, had the po
tential to cause unprecedented chaos in
global financial markets), almost made the
recent government shutdown seem practi
cally quaint.
Asian nations such as China and Japan,
who hold large chunks of our debt through
U.S. treasuries, are appealing to our gov
ernment to resolve the stalemate.

Chinese state-sponsored news agency
Xinhua stated, "As U.S. politicians of both po
litical parties are still shuffling back and forth
between the White House and the Capitol

Hill without striking a viable deal to bring
normality to the body politic they brag about,
it is perhaps a good time for the befuddled
world to start considering building a de-
Americanized world."

China is concerned that American grid
lock will hurt other economies as our politi
cal dysfunction reverberates through the
world; they've voiced their frustration with
the impasse that has frozen our capitol.
This sentiment is echoed globally. Indian
business leaders told Voice for America that
they did not understand how a developed na
tion like the United States could shutdown
due to a legislative impasse.

British Prime Minister David Cameron
said to the BBC, "It is a risk to the world
economy if the US can't properly sort out its

spending." France's Le Monde christened
the shutdown "grotesque" and described
how American cemeteries in France will be
closed: War memorials abroad operate on our
domestic funds.

The American government is unable to
fulfill its basic legislative functions, and the
international community is rightfully unim
pressed.

If the United States wants to remain
great, it's time for our leaders to come to
gether and negotiate a solution. I'm proud of
being an American, but the partisanship that
has split our nation is shameful.
Our politicians have created a situation
that is embarrassing and reflects disconnect
with the needs of the constituents who vot
ed them into office.

Governmental incompetence doesn't
mean that I'm about to move to Canada, but
it's making me question my interest in work
ing as a civil servant. If our politicians' failure
shuts down the public sector opportunities,
maybe I should consider serving my country
by majoring in computer science and work
ing for the start up with free t-shirts. Or the
(generally apolitical) military.
America's sad state inspires doubts and
apathy towards what our government actual
ly can get done. Domestically and interna
tionally, people aren't impressed. It's time for
our leadership to work together our fu
tures depend on it.
