# In defense of tobacco
## 
### Renjie Wong 
Last week, The Daily published an
opinions piece arguing that Stan
ford the healthy, glowing bub
ble of super grains, carrot sticks
and organic low-calorie farm-to-table vod
kas ran afoul of the Santa Clara Public
Health Department. For being the only
university in the county to allow the sale
of tobacco products on campus, the Farm
received an F.

That's right, the Farm receiving a big
fat flaming F. F for Fumes. Or Fuming
Mad, as it were, given the disgruntled re
actions of many an incredulous Week
ender reader, who felt that surely an in
stitution of Stanford's academic stature
would be familiar enough with the dan
gers of tobacco to disallow the sale of
such toxic substances on its hallowed
grounds.

Indeed, out here on the West Coast,
we have come to view tobacco as the
spawn of the devil. Maybe it's the health
freak streak that has been bred into our
blood, or maybe it's the rebelliously alter
native strain that we inherited from our
hippie forebears, but it has become our
second nature to decry the cigarette in

favor of other (purportedly healthier) nar
cotics like marijuana. In hip-hop queen
Kelis' words, "it's the bitch we all love to
hate"; in other words, it's the Gwyneth
Paltrow of the Recreational Drug World.
But does smoking really deserve to
be kicked in its cigarette butt?
Sure, it does have a ton of awful
chemicals that companies throw in to get
you addicted. And the smoke and mirrors
put up to market tobacco as trendy and
upbeat are supremely manipulative. And
you are statistically more likely to die a
slow, painful death at an earlier age than
if you didn't indulge in it.
But if it feels like you've heard this
all before, it's because you have. See al
so: 6 pc. Chicken McNuggets.
Smoking seems to have been inordi
nately demonized in contemporary Cali
fornian culture, and in the cosmic toss
up that includes such noxious substances
as fast food, alcohol and that 16-ounce
can of Monster, we have somehow de
cided that tobacco provides the poorest
pleasure-to-pain ratio.

I'm not saying that it's good for you, or
that it isn't that bad for you or any other line
of doomed argument. I'm not even going to
take the whole smoking-reduces-your-risk-of-
Parkinson's approach (because, let's be real,
obviously lying six feet under is going to sig
nificantly decrease your risk of wobbly
hands).

And while I could argue that, as in many
other cultures around the world, tobacco has
a very significant social and ritual function
amongst its partakers, I'll take the angle most
befitting of this column that of the Epi
curean.

Because, behind all the huffing and puff
ing over the medical implications of smok
ing, there is something to be said for the ap
preciation of tobacco's remarkably complex
flavors. Society may have decided that it pro
vides the least gratification vis-a-vis its
health detriments, but it'd prove truly naive
to entirely ignore what enjoyment it can
give us.

Cigarettes by far the most common
and condemned of tobacco products

were a Flapper Girl favourite, after all, par
tially because it allowed her previously re
pressed self to fully claim her belle
garqonne identity, but mostly because its
toasted, earthy flavor could be enjoyed at any
time of the day, and (in those days) anywhere
she went. A Roaring Twenties chewing gum,
if you will. And as choking as second-hand
cigarette smoke is, in an ingenious sybaritic
sleight of hand, the smoker somehow tastes
none of its gag-inducing qualities.
And then there are the cigars. Like a
finely aged Sauternes wine or a carefully ma
tured Epoisses de Bourgogne cheese, a cigar
presents a rich interplay of complex flavors,
the glimmering ring of fire producing an
hours-long degustation. From nutty and
creamy to hints of chocolate and coffee, it
does not take a pretentious connoisseur to
be able to savor a delicious cigar. Its reliably
luxurious depth, in fact, makes it the perfect
postprandial accompaniment to a peaty
Scotch whisky, a cognac or a syrupy dark
rum.

Granted, the most prestigious cigars are
incredibly difficult to procure in America due
to their Cuban provenance someone I
know once arranged to purchase a Hoyo de
Monterrey Epicure No. 2 cigar in a shady Pa
lo Alto back alley, crack-deal style. But

Guatemalan, Puerto Rican and Honduran ci
gars are equally exquisite, and most certainly
worth the effort of tracking down. After all,
"a good cigar," as Liszt once famously said,
"closes the door to the vulgarities of the
world." And what do generations of Stan
ford's music students have to thank lor Hun
garian Rhapsody No. 2, if not for the fact
that tobacco was tasty enough for Christo
pher Columbus to bring it back with him to
Europe?

So here we are, stranded at the not-un
familiar crossroads between a prudent rock
and an indulgent hard place. Which road
should you take, you ask?

For me, you see, the answer to that
question is clear: As a non-smoker, I often
take a stance against tobacco that is cement
ed by our unfamiliarity with its flavors. But
perhaps it would be more productive to give
credit where credit is due, acknowledge the
gustatory motivations for smoking and with
hold from vilifying a drug that is only as
morally objectionable as Ronald McDonald's
tasty treats.
Or as they say take a chill pill, and
pass the peace pipe.

ing, there is something to be said for the ap
preciation of tobacco's remarkably complex
flavors. Society may have decided that it pro
vides the least gratification vis-a-vis its
health detriments, but it'd prove truly naive
to entirely ignore what enjoyment it can
give us.

Cigarettes by far the most common
and condemned of tobacco products

were a Flapper Girl favourite, after all, par
tially because it allowed her previously re
pressed self to fully claim her belle
garqonne identity, but mostly because its
toasted, earthy flavor could be enjoyed at any
time of the day, and (in those days) anywhere
she went. A Roaring Twenties chewing gum,
if you will. And as choking as second-hand
cigarette smoke is, in an ingenious sybaritic
sleight of hand, the smoker somehow tastes
none of its gag-inducing qualities.
And then there are the cigars. Like a
finely aged Sauternes wine or a carefully ma
tured Epoisses de Bourgogne cheese, a cigar
presents a rich interplay of complex flavors,
the glimmering ring of fire producing an
hours-long degustation. From nutty and
creamy to hints of chocolate and coffee, it
does not take a pretentious connoisseur to
be able to savor a delicious cigar. Its reliably
luxurious depth, in fact, makes it the perfect
postprandial accompaniment to a peaty
Scotch whisky, a cognac or a syrupy dark
rum.

Granted, the most prestigious cigars are
incredibly difficult to procure in America due
to their Cuban provenance someone I
know once arranged to purchase a Hoyo de
Monterrey Epicure No. 2 cigar in a shady Pa
lo Alto back alley, crack-deal style. But

Guatemalan, Puerto Rican and Honduran ci
gars are equally exquisite, and most certainly
worth the effort of tracking down. After all,
"a good cigar," as Liszt once famously said,
"closes the door to the vulgarities of the
world." And what do generations of Stan
ford's music students have to thank lor Hun
garian Rhapsody No. 2, if not for the fact
that tobacco was tasty enough for Christo
pher Columbus to bring it back with him to
Europe?

So here we are, stranded at the not-un
familiar crossroads between a prudent rock
and an indulgent hard place. Which road
should you take, you ask?

For me, you see, the answer to that
question is clear: As a non-smoker, I often
take a stance against tobacco that is cement
ed by our unfamiliarity with its flavors. But
perhaps it would be more productive to give
credit where credit is due, acknowledge the
gustatory motivations for smoking and with
hold from vilifying a drug that is only as
morally objectionable as Ronald McDonald's
tasty treats.
Or as they say take a chill pill, and
pass the peace pipe.

We have somehow
decided that tobacco
provides the poorest
pleasure-to-pain ratio.
Last week, The Daily published an
opinions piece arguing that Stan
ford the healthy, glowing bub
ble of super grains, carrot sticks
and organic low-calorie farm-to-table vod
kas ran afoul of the Santa Clara Public
Health Department. For being the only
university in the county to allow the sale
of tobacco products on campus, the Farm
received an F.

That's right, the Farm receiving a big
fat flaming F. F for Fumes. Or Fuming
Mad, as it were, given the disgruntled re
actions of many an incredulous Week
ender reader, who felt that surely an in
stitution of Stanford's academic stature
would be familiar enough with the dan
gers of tobacco to disallow the sale of
such toxic substances on its hallowed
grounds.

Indeed, out here on the West Coast,
we have come to view tobacco as the
spawn of the devil. Maybe it's the health
freak streak that has been bred into our
blood, or maybe it's the rebelliously alter
native strain that we inherited from our
hippie forebears, but it has become our
second nature to decry the cigarette in

favor of other (purportedly healthier) nar
cotics like marijuana. In hip-hop queen
Kelis' words, "it's the bitch we all love to
hate"; in other words, it's the Gwyneth
Paltrow of the Recreational Drug World.
But does smoking really deserve to
be kicked in its cigarette butt?
Sure, it does have a ton of awful
chemicals that companies throw in to get
you addicted. And the smoke and mirrors
put up to market tobacco as trendy and
upbeat are supremely manipulative. And
you are statistically more likely to die a
slow, painful death at an earlier age than
if you didn't indulge in it.
But if it feels like you've heard this
all before, it's because you have. See al
so: 6 pc. Chicken McNuggets.
Smoking seems to have been inordi
nately demonized in contemporary Cali
fornian culture, and in the cosmic toss
up that includes such noxious substances
as fast food, alcohol and that 16-ounce
can of Monster, we have somehow de
cided that tobacco provides the poorest
pleasure-to-pain ratio.

I'm not saying that it's good for you, or
that it isn't that bad for you or any other line
of doomed argument. I'm not even going to
take the whole smoking-reduces-your-risk-of-
Parkinson's approach (because, let's be real,
obviously lying six feet under is going to sig
nificantly decrease your risk of wobbly
hands).

And while I could argue that, as in many
other cultures around the world, tobacco has
a very significant social and ritual function
amongst its partakers, I'll take the angle most
befitting of this column that of the Epi
curean.
