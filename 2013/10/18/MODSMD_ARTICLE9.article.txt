# In defense of tobacco
## 
### Renjie Wong 
Last week, The Daily published an
opinions piece arguing that Stan
ford the healthy, glowing bub
ble of super grains, carrot sticks
and organic low-calorie farm-to-table vod
kas ran afoul of the Santa Clara Public
Health Department. For being the only
university in the county to allow the sale
of tobacco products on campus, the Farm
received an F.

That's right, the Farm receiving a big
fat flaming F. F for Fumes. Or Fuming
Mad, as it were, given the disgruntled re
actions of many an incredulous Week
ender reader, who felt that surely an in
stitution of Stanford's academic stature
would be familiar enough with the dan
gers of tobacco to disallow the sale of
such toxic substances on its hallowed
grounds.

Indeed, out here on the West Coast,
we have come to view tobacco as the
spawn of the devil. Maybe it's the health
freak streak that has been bred into our
blood, or maybe it's the rebelliously alter
native strain that we inherited from our
hippie forebears, but it has become our
second nature to decry the cigarette in

favor of other (purportedly healthier) nar
cotics like marijuana. In hip-hop queen
Kelis' words, "it's the bitch we all love to
hate"; in other words, it's the Gwyneth
Paltrow of the Recreational Drug World.
But does smoking really deserve to
be kicked in its cigarette butt?
Sure, it does have a ton of awful
chemicals that companies throw in to get
you addicted. And the smoke and mirrors
put up to market tobacco as trendy and
upbeat are supremely manipulative. And
you are statistically more likely to die a
slow, painful death at an earlier age than
if you didn't indulge in it.
But if it feels like you've heard this
all before, it's because you have. See al
so: 6 pc. Chicken McNuggets.
Smoking seems to have been inordi
nately demonized in contemporary Cali
fornian culture, and in the cosmic toss
up that includes such noxious substances
as fast food, alcohol and that 16-ounce
can of Monster, we have somehow de
cided that tobacco provides the poorest
pleasure-to-pain ratio.
