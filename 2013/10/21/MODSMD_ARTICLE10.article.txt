## ESOTERICA LessHomeLess 
### Kevin Rouff 
What happened to the admira
tion of freight train-hopping
nomads? People used to
drop a few bucks or pick up hitchhik
ers, historical icons of the Americana,
just to meet a stranger and hear a
good story; today it's done to be char
itable, to cure a societal ill.
If someone were to say he or she
was a "nomad," we'd either scoff at
the poor attempt to relive "Into the
Wild" or perhaps only sympathize
with this "bum" and help out.
There is virtually no end to the
amount of articles about homeless
ness, though nearly all articles seem
to remove the voice of the homeless
entirely. The media either provide
criticism of the homeless as individu
als who made poor choices or they
criticize society's structure with re
gards to the homeless.
Both are saturated with an etio
logical focus that effectively diminish
es the ethos of the homeless as indi
viduals, and both deny the multitude
of subcultures the homeless enjoy by
framing them under specific lan
guage that is advantageous to their
message, market or morale.
Critical media blames addictive
substance and the individual's choic
es, which often leads to causal justifi
cation for whether the individual is
"deserving" or not of his or her situ
ation. Sociologists have pointed to
the scapegoat concept that came
from the ancient Greek "pharmakos"
rituals it's easier for us to blame
the individuals than it is to feel the
larger social guilt.
Though I'm sure most of you
would quickly disagree with this sort
of media, it is reflective of a certain
mentality we take day to day to es
sentially silence the homeless voice.
They are silent, and we are content.
But what of those who try to help?
Often times the portrayal is such that
the homeless are "victims of circum
stance", and the result of these cir
cumstances is often what critical me
dia finds to be the cause.
In viewing the entirety of the
homeless as being beyond a minimum
threshold of society, we place them be
low "us" they are "them," and they
are thus easy to help. Many organiza
tions make use of this discourse to
propagate their message, to draw
funding, and to invite charity a call
that many of us are glad to answer.
And make no mistake, helping has the
same result as blaming the individual:

They are silent, and we are content.
By imposing the distinction, that
of helpers and helped, the homeless
are driven, just as they were in the
case of the critical media, to find com
pensatory subcultures ("Dark Days"
documents a physically subterranean
subculture) that allow the homeless
to create their own social network,
free of discriminatory distinctions.
A shelter is not a home, and this is
precisely because of the rhetoric used
in charity and its resulting style of
charity, that of victimization, which,
as you can imagine, is difficult to
swallow (in 2011, it was predicted
that 42 percent of the homeless were
"rough sleepers," or unsheltered in
public spaces, which raises questions
beyond the capacity limit but rather
with regards to the voluntary opting
out of help).
Despite having good intentions,
we forget that much of our desire to
help simultaneously frames homeless
individuals as a single entity and cre
ates further alienation.
We do help, and we do feel better,
though with little regard to the side
effects. Many of us continue in appar
ent selflessness when, in full fact, we
are compensated for our "help" be
cause of the their position beneath
our own, and we involuntarily pro
mote this distinction, either directly
in our manner of helping or by adding
to the success of the discourse used.
Yes, you can and should help when
possible, but do so with modesty and
awareness you too are getting
something from them, just as a con
sumer would, and you too are part of
the discourse that is generated. The
helped is in a much more vulnerable
position than the giver, as they are of
ten being defined in a process that ac
knowledges the differences between
the two rather than the similarities
and continuity.
Helping is by all means crucial, so
long as the exchange is not detrimen
tal, that there is no "stooping to their
level," just as one wouldn't look upon
his or her friend in that way, let alone
an emblem of the old Americana.
Sometimes is as simple as letting a
voice be heard. (Listen to some Bob
Dylan or something to kick your ad
miration of the freewheelers into
gear help, hear out a stranger,
make a friend.)

the discourse that is generated. The
helped is in a much more vulnerable
position than the giver, as they are of

knowledges the differences between
the two rather than the similarities

Helping is by all means crucial, so

his or her friend in that way, let alone
an emblem of the old Americana.
Sometimes is as simple as letting a
voice be heard. (Listen to some Bob

miration of the freewheelers into

make a friend.)

What happened to the admira
tion of freight train-hopping
nomads? People used to
drop a few bucks or pick up hitchhik
ers, historical icons of the Americana,
just to meet a stranger and hear a
good story; today it's done to be char
itable, to cure a societal ill.
If someone were to say he or she
was a "nomad," we'd either scoff at
the poor attempt to relive "Into the
Wild" or perhaps only sympathize
with this "bum" and help out.
There is virtually no end to the
amount of articles about homeless
ness, though nearly all articles seem
to remove the voice of the homeless
entirely. The media either provide
criticism of the homeless as individu
als who made poor choices or they
criticize society's structure with re
gards to the homeless.
Both are saturated with an etio
logical focus that effectively diminish
es the ethos of the homeless as indi
viduals, and both deny the multitude
of subcultures the homeless enjoy by
framing them under specific lan
guage that is advantageous to their
message, market or morale.
Critical media blames addictive
substance and the individual's choic
es, which often leads to causal justifi
cation for whether the individual is
"deserving" or not of his or her situ
ation. Sociologists have pointed to
the scapegoat concept that came
from the ancient Greek "pharmakos"
rituals it's easier for us to blame
the individuals than it is to feel the
larger social guilt.
Though I'm sure most of you
would quickly disagree with this sort
of media, it is reflective of a certain
mentality we take day to day to es
sentially silence the homeless voice.
They are silent, and we are content.
But what of those who try to help?
Often times the portrayal is such that
the homeless are "victims of circum
stance", and the result of these cir
cumstances is often what critical me
dia finds to be the cause.
In viewing the entirety of the
homeless as being beyond a minimum
threshold of society, we place them be
low "us" they are "them," and they
are thus easy to help. Many organiza
tions make use of this discourse to
propagate their message, to draw
funding, and to invite charity a call
that many of us are glad to answer.
And make no mistake, helping has the
same result as blaming the individual:

They are silent, and we are content.
By imposing the distinction, that
of helpers and helped, the homeless
are driven, just as they were in the
case of the critical media, to find com
pensatory subcultures ("Dark Days"
documents a physically subterranean
subculture) that allow the homeless
to create their own social network,
free of discriminatory distinctions.
A shelter is not a home, and this is
precisely because of the rhetoric used
in charity and its resulting style of
charity, that of victimization, which,
as you can imagine, is difficult to
swallow (in 2011, it was predicted
that 42 percent of the homeless were
"rough sleepers," or unsheltered in
public spaces, which raises questions
beyond the capacity limit but rather
with regards to the voluntary opting
out of help).
Despite having good intentions,
we forget that much of our desire to
help simultaneously frames homeless
individuals as a single entity and cre
ates further alienation.
We do help, and we do feel better,
though with little regard to the side
effects. Many of us continue in appar
ent selflessness when, in full fact, we
are compensated for our "help" be
cause of the their position beneath
our own, and we involuntarily pro
mote this distinction, either directly
in our manner of helping or by adding
to the success of the discourse used.
Yes, you can and should help when
possible, but do so with modesty and
awareness you too are getting
something from them, just as a con
sumer would, and you too are part of
the discourse that is generated. The
helped is in a much more vulnerable
position than the giver, as they are of
ten being defined in a process that ac
