# DON'T KNOW JACK
## The 						Hoover Maneuver 
### Jack Weller 
I've often heard Stanford's most
prominent landmark called our
enduring monument to a failed
president. No matter what context
you ascribe, that seems historically
accurate. Hoover Tower stands 285
feet tall, looms over campus and is
named after a bungler of the high
est order.
To put it diplomatically, Herbert
Hoover was out of his depth in a
time of crisis. To put it frankly, he
really sucked at the job. He came
into office envisioning "the day
when poverty will be banished from
this nation" and left four years later
with the unemployment rate above
20 percent.
He graced the United States
with its greatest example of protec
tionist failure, and also its best
named piece of legislation ever, in
the Smoot-Hawley tariff, which
eviscerated global trade.
There's a reason that a "Hoover
Flag" referred to an empty pocket
turned inside out. In fact, things
were so bad that a young, equivo
cating governor of New York was
able to win the 1932 election in a
massive landslide and thereby es

tablish a new political order.
So maybe it's a strained intellec
tual maneuver to try and rescue
Hoover's reputation from his most
public and enduring failure.
Nonetheless, it's worth a shot.
Though Hoover will forever be re
membered by the legacy of his
presidency, I believe he deserves
much more.
Both before and after his tenure
in the Oval Office, Hoover demon
strated talents and qualities that we
should celebrate. To paraphrase
Kevin Carey, he emphatically de
served to be here.
A member of our first freshman
class, Hoover was a man of science
and industry. From humble begin
nings as the orphaned son of an
lowa blacksmith, he worked his way
up into unparalleled success as a
mining tycoon.
With his equally impressive wife
Lou, he learned Chinese and Latin
and helped translate "De re
metallica" into English for the
first time. Even more significantly,
the food relief program he set up in
Europe after World War I fed mil
lions of people, literally saving some

from starvation.
Moving into government, he
helped establish the Department of
Commerce as a vibrant and essen
tial cabinet bureau. And, of course,
he established the Hoover Institu
tion, housed within the aforemen
tioned tower, and an essential col
lection of documents from both
World Wars.
In so many ways, his biography
jumps out as a quintessentially
Stanford story. But then he ran for
President, got himself elected and
just about ruined that good reputa
tion.
While it's important not to as
sign Hoover blame for the structur
al causes of the Great Depression,
it's equally crucial to admit that his
macroeconomic response (or lack
thereof) was utterly inadequate.
Though it perplexes me still how
Calvin Coolidge seems to get off
scot free for the economic collapse
that ensued directly after his time
in the White House, Hoover was
very much a part of the same tradi
tion.
Though he dissented from the
even more passive response strate
gy of Andrew Mellon, it must al
ways be remembered that Hoover
failed to provide the American peo
ple with recovery, relief and reform,
to disastrous effects.
Upon leaving the Presidency,
Hoover returned to his more suc
cessful career of helping others. He
again worked in food relief follow
ing World War II and was especial
ly influential as head of the Hoover
Commission, appointed by Harry
Truman, to reorganize the execu
tive branch.
Among its various recommenda
tions were several that lay the foun
dations of the modern welfare state,
including what later became the
Department of Health and Human
Services. Ironically, that depart
ment for several decades housed
the Social Security Administration,
legislation that, more than any oth
er, stood as a repudiation of Presi
dent Hoover's time in Washington.
Life outside of politics was good
for Hoover, and for the countless
lives improved through his tireless
labor.
So when I bike by Hoover Tower
every morning, I don't actually look
up and see a monument to failure.
Hubris perhaps, and a form of
hide-bound rigidity. A belief in the
old ways and a stunning failure of
imagination.
But vitally, this is twinned with a
willingness to serve the greater
cause of mankind, the cause that
never ends. Ultimately, I see a good
man, and occasionally a great one,
the most fitting tribute of all.
