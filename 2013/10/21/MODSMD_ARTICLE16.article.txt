The article "Technical dif
ficulties delay AlertSU test"
published on Oct. 11 said
that the AlertSU technology
transmits a message through
KZSU student radio station
when in fact that method is a
separate part of the emer
gency notification system.
The article left out that
AlertSU also transmits mes
sages through phone calls.

The article "PA housing
proposal to be voted on Nov.
5" published on Oct. 17 incor
rectly said that Jean McCown
was a Stanford alumna. The
Daily regrets this error.
