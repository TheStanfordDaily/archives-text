## TAR HEEL SPLIT STANFORD TOPS WAKE FOREST, LOSES AT DUKE 
### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 13 Stanford returns from a
weekend road trip to North Carolina
1-1, having defeated No. 14 Wake For
est on Friday before falling to No. 8
Duke Sunday morning.

In one of the Card's closest match
es of the season, Wake Forest (10-6, 0-
4 ACC) matched Stanford (11-4, 3-1
NorPac) shot for shot, drawing a
scoreless tie through regulation. Out
shot 7-5 in the first half, Stanford ben
efitted from five saves from goalie Dul
cie Davies, part of an eight-save effort
in Stanford's third consecutive
shutout.
A high-powered Demon Deacon of
fense was matched by a tenacious
Stanford defense, especially in the sec
ond half as Stanford allowed only four
shots. On the other end of the field,
Stanford's offense faltered on penalty
corners. After going three for three
against Yale, the Cardinal failed to
convert on any of its seven attempts
throughout the game. Coupled with
seven saves by Wake Forest goalie Va
lerie Dahmen, an explosive Cardinal
offense was contained.
With the only offensive distinction
between the teams coming in a one
penalty corner advantage for Stanford
(7-6) the game turned into a defensive
battle.
After 70 minutes of passionate play,
the two teams entered a sudden-death
overtime contest. Stanford has not
faired well in overtime, which is played
seven-on-seven, this season. Record

Freshman defender Fran Tew (above) scored the lone goal in Stanford's 1-0 overtime win at Wake
Forest Friday. The Cardinal fell in the second leg of its Southeast swing, however, at Duke Sunday.
ing losses to UC-Davis and No. 4 Con
necticut earlier in the season, the
Cardinal was winless when the game
went to an extra period.
Freshman Fran Tew ended that
skid with a goal in the ninth minute
of Friday's overtime, deflecting a
crossing pass from senior attacker
Courtney Haldeman for her third
goal of the season. An exhilarating
finish left the Cardinal at 11-3 on the
season heading into another top-25
matchup against eighth-ranked
Duke.
Riding the momentum of three
shutout games in a row, the Cardinal
was met Sunday morning by a
vengeful Blue Devil team. Having
just lost two games to top-10 teams,
Duke (11-4, 2-2 ACC) staunchly de

fended its home field.
The first half was evenly matched
and scoreless. Though Stanford
recorded more shots (6-4) and penal
ty corners (3-2) through the first 35
minutes play, the stifled Duke of
fense was unleashed in the second
half, forcing six penalty corners to
Stanford's one. In the 59th minute of
play, Duke earned a corner, and
Amanda Kim punctuated the offen
sive drive with her first goal of the
season. Kim's goal marked the first
scoring strike against Davies and the
Cardinal since the overtime loss at
UC-Davis.
Stanford continued to battle how
ever, tallying four shots in the sec
ond half. With two minutes of regula
tion time remaining, the Cardinal
substituted goalie Davies for a field
player in an attempt to generate a
late attack. The risky move ended up
backfiring for Stanford.
With the addition of an extra for
ward, Stanford left its defense sub

stantially weakened. Duke capital
ized on the empty net and, with 20
seconds left in the game, Jessica
Buttinger found the cage for her
sixth goal of the season.
The 2-0 final gave Stanford its
first shutout loss of the season.
Plagued by its inefficiency on penal
ty corners, the team has four days of
practice to work out its issues before
battling Michigan at home on Friday.
Coming out of two top-25 games
I-1, Stanford returns home with an
11-4 record on the season. Now 4-2
against ranked teams, the Cardinal
will need to maintain its high level of
play, closing the regular season with
the Wolverines, followed by two Nor-
Pac games against University of Pa
cific and Cal.
Friday's game against Michigan is
scheduled for 2 p.m. on the Varsity
Turf.

Duke Sunday morning.

In one of the Card's closest match
es of the season, Wake Forest (10-6, 0-
4 ACC) matched Stanford (11-4, 3-1
NorPac) shot for shot, drawing a
scoreless tie through regulation. Out
shot 7-5 in the first half, Stanford ben
efitted from five saves from goalie Dul
cie Davies, part of an eight-save effort
in Stanford's third consecutive
shutout.
A high-powered Demon Deacon of
fense was matched by a tenacious
Stanford defense, especially in the sec
ond half as Stanford allowed only four
shots. On the other end of the field,
Stanford's offense faltered on penalty
corners. After going three for three
against Yale, the Cardinal failed to
convert on any of its seven attempts
throughout the game. Coupled with
seven saves by Wake Forest goalie Va
lerie Dahmen, an explosive Cardinal
offense was contained.
With the only offensive distinction
between the teams coming in a one
penalty corner advantage for Stanford
(7-6) the game turned into a defensive
battle.
After 70 minutes of passionate play,
the two teams entered a sudden-death
overtime contest. Stanford has not
faired well in overtime, which is played
seven-on-seven, this season. Record

Freshman defender Fran Tew (above) scored the lone goal in Stanford's 1-0 overtime win at Wake
Forest Friday. The Cardinal fell in the second leg of its Southeast swing, however, at Duke Sunday.
ing losses to UC-Davis and No. 4 Con
necticut earlier in the season, the
Cardinal was winless when the game
went to an extra period.
Freshman Fran Tew ended that
skid with a goal in the ninth minute
of Friday's overtime, deflecting a
crossing pass from senior attacker
Courtney Haldeman for her third
goal of the season. An exhilarating
finish left the Cardinal at 11-3 on the
season heading into another top-25
matchup against eighth-ranked
Duke.
Riding the momentum of three
shutout games in a row, the Cardinal
was met Sunday morning by a
vengeful Blue Devil team. Having
just lost two games to top-10 teams,
Duke (11-4, 2-2 ACC) staunchly de

fended its home field.
The first half was evenly matched
and scoreless. Though Stanford
recorded more shots (6-4) and penal
ty corners (3-2) through the first 35
minutes play, the stifled Duke of
fense was unleashed in the second
half, forcing six penalty corners to
Stanford's one. In the 59th minute of
play, Duke earned a corner, and
Amanda Kim punctuated the offen
sive drive with her first goal of the
season. Kim's goal marked the first
scoring strike against Davies and the
Cardinal since the overtime loss at
UC-Davis.
Stanford continued to battle how
ever, tallying four shots in the sec
ond half. With two minutes of regula
tion time remaining, the Cardinal
substituted goalie Davies for a field
player in an attempt to generate a
late attack. The risky move ended up
backfiring for Stanford.
With the addition of an extra for
ward, Stanford left its defense sub

stantially weakened. Duke capital
ized on the empty net and, with 20
seconds left in the game, Jessica
Buttinger found the cage for her
sixth goal of the season.
The 2-0 final gave Stanford its
first shutout loss of the season.
Plagued by its inefficiency on penal
ty corners, the team has four days of
practice to work out its issues before
battling Michigan at home on Friday.
Coming out of two top-25 games
I-1, Stanford returns home with an
11-4 record on the season. Now 4-2
against ranked teams, the Cardinal
will need to maintain its high level of
play, closing the regular season with
the Wolverines, followed by two Nor-
Pac games against University of Pa
cific and Cal.
Friday's game against Michigan is
scheduled for 2 p.m. on the Varsity
Turf.
