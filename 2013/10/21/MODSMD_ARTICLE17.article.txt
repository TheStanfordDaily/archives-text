## TAR HEEL SPLIT STANFORD TOPS WAKE FOREST, LOSES AT DUKE 
### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 13 Stanford returns from a
weekend road trip to North Carolina
1-1, having defeated No. 14 Wake For
est on Friday before falling to No. 8
Duke Sunday morning.

In one of the Card's closest match
es of the season, Wake Forest (10-6, 0-
4 ACC) matched Stanford (11-4, 3-1
NorPac) shot for shot, drawing a
scoreless tie through regulation. Out
shot 7-5 in the first half, Stanford ben
efitted from five saves from goalie Dul
cie Davies, part of an eight-save effort
in Stanford's third consecutive
shutout.
A high-powered Demon Deacon of
fense was matched by a tenacious
Stanford defense, especially in the sec
ond half as Stanford allowed only four
shots. On the other end of the field,
Stanford's offense faltered on penalty
corners. After going three for three
against Yale, the Cardinal failed to
convert on any of its seven attempts
throughout the game. Coupled with
seven saves by Wake Forest goalie Va
lerie Dahmen, an explosive Cardinal
offense was contained.
With the only offensive distinction
between the teams coming in a one
penalty corner advantage for Stanford
(7-6) the game turned into a defensive
battle.
After 70 minutes of passionate play,
the two teams entered a sudden-death
overtime contest. Stanford has not
faired well in overtime, which is played
seven-on-seven, this season. Record
