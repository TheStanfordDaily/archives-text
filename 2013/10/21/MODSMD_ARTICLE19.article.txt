# VERLOO GOAL ENDS RARE SKID
## WIN OVER UTES GIVES MUCH-NEEDED BOOST 
### FIONA NOONAN 
What a difference one goal can
make.
That's all it took for the Stan
ford women's soccer team (10-3-1,
3-3-0 Pac-12) to beat Utah (7-3-5,
3-2-1 Pac-12) in decisive fashion in
front of a packed Homecoming
crowd at Cagan Stadium Friday
night.

Though the match ended in a
1-0 Cardinal victory, the women
dominated the Utes in all aspects
of the game, finally looking like
the team that has won the Pac-12
Championship the last four years
in a row.
The difference last night was
an energy that had been lacking
in Stanford's previous three
games and which Stanford head
coach Paul Ratcliffe had been try
ing to draw out of the team all
week. His effort paid off last
night.
"They had high energy,
worked hard as a team, and it was

a good result in the end," Rat
cliffe said after the game.
Stanford's attack was an of
fensive firestorm, ending the
game with 22 shots to Utah's sev
en. Junior forward Chioma Übo
gagu led the charge with three
shots on goal, continuing to estab
lish herself as a powerful pres
ence up top. Senior defender Na
talie Griffen also contributed two
shots on goal, demonstrating 90
minutes of solid play.
Ultimately, the deciding goal
came in the 67th minute, when a
foul just outside of Utah's penalty
arc resulted in a free kick for the
Cardinal. Redshirt senior for
ward and co-captain Courtney
Verloo took the kick off of a touch
by Übogagu, drilling the ball into
left back of the net before Utes
goalkeeper Lindsey Luke could
even react.
It was just what the team
and the crowd needed.
"It felt great," Verloo said.
"You know, it'd been a while for
me, it'd been a while for my team.
We had been unfortunate in the
past couple of games and just
couldn't get it in the back of the
net, so it was just a great feeling
to finally do that for the team."
Utah's only chance of an
equalizer came in the 81st minute,
when junior forward Ashton Hall
forced a dramatic save out of

The win could not have come at
a better time for the Cardinal. An
other loss would have extended the
team's longest losing streak since
2006, but the victory sends the
women on their road trip to the Pa
cific Northwest with a huge confi
dence boost.
The Cardinal also proved itself
in front of an audience that held
nearly 50 alumni of the soccer pro
gram, an impressive group that in
cludes five Olympians, seven active
international players and a com
bined 524 international appear
ances. These women were honored
in a special ceremony at halftime
as part of Homecoming Weekend.
Moving forward, the team's fo
cus will be winning out the Pac-12,
then looking to achieve success in
the post season.
"I hope we can build on this,
and we want to get back to our
winning ways," Ratcliffe said.
"This was the beginning of
starting a new winning streak
hopefully."
The Cardinal will get a chance
to extend its streak next Friday
when it faces Oregon in Eugene at
4 p.m. on the Pac-12 Networks.

What a difference one goal can
make.
That's all it took for the Stan
ford women's soccer team (10-3-1,
3-3-0 Pac-12) to beat Utah (7-3-5,
3-2-1 Pac-12) in decisive fashion in
front of a packed Homecoming
crowd at Cagan Stadium Friday
night.

Though the match ended in a
1-0 Cardinal victory, the women
dominated the Utes in all aspects
of the game, finally looking like
the team that has won the Pac-12
Championship the last four years
in a row.
The difference last night was
an energy that had been lacking
in Stanford's previous three
games and which Stanford head
coach Paul Ratcliffe had been try
ing to draw out of the team all
week. His effort paid off last
night.
"They had high energy,
worked hard as a team, and it was

a good result in the end," Rat
cliffe said after the game.
Stanford's attack was an of
fensive firestorm, ending the
game with 22 shots to Utah's sev
en. Junior forward Chioma Übo
gagu led the charge with three
shots on goal, continuing to estab
lish herself as a powerful pres
ence up top. Senior defender Na
talie Griffen also contributed two
shots on goal, demonstrating 90
minutes of solid play.
Ultimately, the deciding goal
came in the 67th minute, when a
foul just outside of Utah's penalty
arc resulted in a free kick for the
Cardinal. Redshirt senior for
ward and co-captain Courtney
Verloo took the kick off of a touch
by Übogagu, drilling the ball into
left back of the net before Utes
goalkeeper Lindsey Luke could
even react.
It was just what the team
and the crowd needed.
"It felt great," Verloo said.
"You know, it'd been a while for
me, it'd been a while for my team.
We had been unfortunate in the
past couple of games and just
couldn't get it in the back of the
net, so it was just a great feeling
to finally do that for the team."
Utah's only chance of an
equalizer came in the 81st minute,
when junior forward Ashton Hall
forced a dramatic save out of

Fifth-year senior forward Courtney Verloo (above) scored the only goal
of the match in Stanford's 1-0 win against Utah Friday night. Verloo's
goal helped the Card break a rare three-match home losing streak.
Stanford's freshman goalkeeper
Jane Campbell, who managed to
maintain the Cardinal lead.
The win could not have come at
a better time for the Cardinal. An
other loss would have extended the
team's longest losing streak since
2006, but the victory sends the
women on their road trip to the Pa
cific Northwest with a huge confi
dence boost.
The Cardinal also proved itself
in front of an audience that held
nearly 50 alumni of the soccer pro
gram, an impressive group that in
cludes five Olympians, seven active
international players and a com
bined 524 international appear
ances. These women were honored
in a special ceremony at halftime
as part of Homecoming Weekend.
Moving forward, the team's fo
cus will be winning out the Pac-12,
then looking to achieve success in
the post season.
"I hope we can build on this,
and we want to get back to our
winning ways," Ratcliffe said.
"This was the beginning of
starting a new winning streak
hopefully."
The Cardinal will get a chance
to extend its streak next Friday
when it faces Oregon in Eugene at
4 p.m. on the Pac-12 Networks.
