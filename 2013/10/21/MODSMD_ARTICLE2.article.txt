# GAME ON
## CARD BOUNCES BACK AGAINST UCLA 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Late in the fourth quarter, with
his team up by seven, senior tail
back Tyler Gaffney looked at head
coach David Shaw and said,
"Coach, I ain't tired."
"We're not taking you out any
more," Shaw responded.
Shaw wasn't going to pass the ball
after what had happened in Salt
Lake City the week before, and
Gaffney certainly wasn't going to let
his team's Pac-12 title hopes slip away

Gaffney rushed for a career
high 171 yards and two touch
downs on 36 carries to propel No.
13 Stanford (6-1, 4-1 Pac-12) past
No. 9 UCLA (5-1,2-1) 24-10 in Sat
urday's Homecoming game. The
Cardinal bounced back in emphat
ic fashion from its heartbreaking
loss to Utah last weekend, and its
goal of repeating as Pac-12 cham

pions along with its slim
chances of playing for the national
championship remains intact.
After giving up 410 yards of to
tal offense to the Utes, the Cardi
nal defense played lights out even
by its own high standards, harass
ing Bruin star quarterback Brett
Hundley for most of the afternoon.
With fewer than three minutes
left in the game and his team cling
ing to a seven-point lead, junior
safety Jordan Richards picked off

Sophomore wide reciever Kodi Whitfield (middle) made a specatcular circus catch to help propel the
Cardinal to a key victory against then-No. 9 UCLA Saturday in front of a sold-out Homecoming crowd.
Hundley for the second time in the
game at the UCLA 40-yard line.
Working with a short field, Stanford
gave Gaffney the ball five times in a
row behind its big offensive line to
extend its lead to 14 and put the
game away.
"If we can stay on the clock and
run the ball with efficiency, we have
a chance to do what we want to do,
which is run the ball between the
tackles," Shaw said. "Guys wanted
to bounce back. They wanted to
turn the page and move on, and the
advice that I gave them earlier was,
'Bring last week with you. Bring the
lessons learned about how hard you
have to play, about how smart you
have to play and about how you
have to finish.'"
The first half proved to be a de
fensive slugfest. The Cardinal
opened the game with a promising
drive that came up empty when jun
ior wide receiver Ty Montgomery
dropped a well-thrown deep ball
from junior quarterback Kevin
Hogan inside the 10-yard line. Bru
ins running back Malcom Jones got
things started for his team with a
few runs to the outside, but the
UCLA offense ultimately stalled
before it could cross midfield.
Stanford and UCLA then traded
three-and-outs before the Cardinal
offense started to open up on its
third drive towards the end of the
first quarter. Hogan dropped back
to pass nine times during the pos
session he hit junior wide re
ceivers Devon Cajuste and Jordan
Pratt for first downs and also
picked up 24 yards on three carries
and looked comfortable in the
pocket for the first time in two
weeks.
But an inopportune fumble by
senior halfback Anthony Wilkerson
at the UCLA 12-yard line forced the
Cardinal into a first-and-20 hole af
ter Hogan somehow fought off two
Bruin defenders to recover the ball
at the 20-yard line. Stanford had to
settle for a field goal attempt, and
sophomore kicker Conrad
Ukropina, who filled in for an in
jured Jordan Williamson, made a
31-yard boot for the first field goal
of his college career.
The defensive battle continued
in the second quarter, as the Bruins
suffered two three-and-outs in a
row while Hogan was intercepted
right before halftime when his pass
bounced off a sliding Cajuste right
into the hands of cornerback Ish
mael Adams deep in Bruin territo
ry. Still, the Cardinal defense held
its end of the bargain by limiting
Hundley to just five-of-10 passing
for 37 yards and 8 yards on three
carries in the first half.
"I have to give a lot of credit to
[defensive coordinator] Derek Ma
son," Shaw said. "Just knowing that
we had to contain these guys. Par
tially based on what happened in
Utah, the swing passes giving up
seven, eight yards a chunk. We
shored up that. We knew [Hundley]

is hard to bring down. He's a big,
physical guy, but he's also an ath
lete, so we had to keep contain of
him."
The Cardinal's three-point ad
vantage at the half was far from a
comfortable lead, especially consid
ering that the Bruins came into the
game outscoring their opponents
71-0 in the third quarter this sea
son. Hundley showed a glimpse of
that third-quarter explosiveness
when he broke contain to scramble
for 30 yards on the opening drive.
However, Stanford's defense buck
led down and forced UCLA to settle
for a field goal.
"We wanted to keep [Hundley]
in the box," said fifth-year senior
outside linebacker Trent Murphy,
who sacked the slippery Hundley
twice. "Unfortunately he got out on
us a couple times, but that's going to
happen. He's a phenomenal player,
a great kid. He holds the key to
their offense... But the key is us all
hunting together, keeping it in the

box and putting pressure."
Unlike last weekend, the Cardi
nal offense answered when it need
ed to. After connecting with Mont
gomery for 29 yards, Hogan
launched a deep ball a late throw,
even though the Bruin safety was
out of position into the end zone,
where sophomore wide receiver Ko
di Whitfield made an unbelievable
one-handed touchdown catch de
spite tight coverage by the corner.
The score put the Cardinal back up

by seven midway through the third
quarter.
"It was a phenomenal catch,"
Murphy said. "Once I saw it up in
the air, I started jogging out for the
PAT because I knew [Whitfield] was
coming down with it."
"Unbelievable," Hogan added.
"He just went up and made a play.
I can't wait to see it on Sports-
Center."

Three plays later, it was the de
fense's turn to come up big. On

third-and-7, Hundley unwisely
launched the ball down the sideline
and was picked off by Richards,
who would finish the game with a
team-high 10 tackles. Although
Richards ran the interception back
into the end zone, the touchdown
was called back because of a holding
penalty on junior linebacker James
Vaughters. But no harm was done,
as Hogan found Cajuste in the mid
dle of the field for 34 yards and
Gaffney punched it in three plays
later on third-and-goal for a 1-yard
touchdown run to give the Cardinal
a 17-3 lead.
"Dominant, dominant," said
Shaw, describing Richards' play on
Saturday. "The year that Ed
Reynolds has had or had last year,
the ball is staying away from Ed.
What Ed put on film last year
leading the nation in interception
return yardage has led him to
not have a lot of opportunities. The
ball is going Jordan's way. Jordan's
doing a great job of disguising cov
erage ... He's athletic, he's smart.
He's our other quarterback back
there."
Hundley would find wideout
Shaquelle Evans for a 3-yard touch
down at the start of the fourth quar
ter, but the Cardinal defense held
steady and kept Stanford's seven
point lead safe despite Ukropina
missing a 46-yard field goal attempt
way wide right.
Stanford's offense went three
and-out on three straight running
plays with the fourth quarter wind
ing down, but Richards' second in
terception of the day and Gaffney's
workhorse performance sealed the
game minutes later.
Stanford will travel to Corvallis,
Ore., to take on Oregon State next
weekend before its highly anticipat
ed date with No. 2 Oregon on Nov. 7.

is hard to bring down. He's a big,
physical guy, but he's also an ath
lete, so we had to keep contain of
him."
The Cardinal's three-point ad
vantage at the half was far from a
comfortable lead, especially consid
ering that the Bruins came into the
game outscoring their opponents
71-0 in the third quarter this sea
son. Hundley showed a glimpse of
that third-quarter explosiveness
when he broke contain to scramble
for 30 yards on the opening drive.
However, Stanford's defense buck
led down and forced UCLA to settle
for a field goal.
"We wanted to keep [Hundley]
in the box," said fifth-year senior
outside linebacker Trent Murphy,
who sacked the slippery Hundley
twice. "Unfortunately he got out on
us a couple times, but that's going to
happen. He's a phenomenal player,
a great kid. He holds the key to
their offense... But the key is us all
hunting together, keeping it in the

box and putting pressure."
Unlike last weekend, the Cardi
nal offense answered when it need
ed to. After connecting with Mont
gomery for 29 yards, Hogan
launched a deep ball a late throw,
even though the Bruin safety was
out of position into the end zone,
where sophomore wide receiver Ko
di Whitfield made an unbelievable
one-handed touchdown catch de
spite tight coverage by the corner.
The score put the Cardinal back up

by seven midway through the third
quarter.
"It was a phenomenal catch,"
Murphy said. "Once I saw it up in
the air, I started jogging out for the
PAT because I knew [Whitfield] was
coming down with it."
"Unbelievable," Hogan added.
"He just went up and made a play.
I can't wait to see it on Sports-
Center."

Three plays later, it was the de
fense's turn to come up big. On

third-and-7, Hundley unwisely
launched the ball down the sideline
and was picked off by Richards,
who would finish the game with a
team-high 10 tackles. Although
Richards ran the interception back
into the end zone, the touchdown
was called back because of a holding
penalty on junior linebacker James
Vaughters. But no harm was done,
as Hogan found Cajuste in the mid
dle of the field for 34 yards and
Gaffney punched it in three plays
later on third-and-goal for a 1-yard
touchdown run to give the Cardinal
a 17-3 lead.
"Dominant, dominant," said
Shaw, describing Richards' play on
Saturday. "The year that Ed
Reynolds has had or had last year,
the ball is staying away from Ed.
What Ed put on film last year

not have a lot of opportunities. The

erage ... He's athletic, he's smart.

Hundley would find wideout
Shaquelle Evans for a 3-yard touch
down at the start of the fourth quar

steady and kept Stanford's seven

missing a 46-yard field goal attempt

Late in the fourth quarter, with
his team up by seven, senior tail
back Tyler Gaffney looked at head

Shaw wasn't going to pass the ball

Sophomore wide reciever Kodi Whitfield (middle) made a specatcular circus catch to help propel the
Cardinal to a key victory against then-No. 9 UCLA Saturday in front of a sold-out Homecoming crowd.
Hundley for the second time in the
game at the UCLA 40-yard line.
Working with a short field, Stanford
gave Gaffney the ball five times in a
row behind its big offensive line to
extend its lead to 14 and put the
game away.
"If we can stay on the clock and
run the ball with efficiency, we have
a chance to do what we want to do,
which is run the ball between the
tackles," Shaw said. "Guys wanted
to bounce back. They wanted to
turn the page and move on, and the
advice that I gave them earlier was,
'Bring last week with you. Bring the
lessons learned about how hard you
have to play, about how smart you
have to play and about how you
have to finish.'"
The first half proved to be a de
fensive slugfest. The Cardinal
opened the game with a promising
drive that came up empty when jun
ior wide receiver Ty Montgomery
dropped a well-thrown deep ball
from junior quarterback Kevin
Hogan inside the 10-yard line. Bru
ins running back Malcom Jones got
things started for his team with a
few runs to the outside, but the
UCLA offense ultimately stalled
before it could cross midfield.
Stanford and UCLA then traded
three-and-outs before the Cardinal
offense started to open up on its
third drive towards the end of the
first quarter. Hogan dropped back
to pass nine times during the pos
session he hit junior wide re
ceivers Devon Cajuste and Jordan
Pratt for first downs and also
picked up 24 yards on three carries
and looked comfortable in the
pocket for the first time in two
weeks.
But an inopportune fumble by
senior halfback Anthony Wilkerson
at the UCLA 12-yard line forced the
Cardinal into a first-and-20 hole af
ter Hogan somehow fought off two
Bruin defenders to recover the ball
at the 20-yard line. Stanford had to
settle for a field goal attempt, and
sophomore kicker Conrad
Ukropina, who filled in for an in
jured Jordan Williamson, made a
31-yard boot for the first field goal
of his college career.
The defensive battle continued
in the second quarter, as the Bruins
suffered two three-and-outs in a
row while Hogan was intercepted
right before halftime when his pass
bounced off a sliding Cajuste right
into the hands of cornerback Ish
mael Adams deep in Bruin territo
ry. Still, the Cardinal defense held
its end of the bargain by limiting
Hundley to just five-of-10 passing
for 37 yards and 8 yards on three
carries in the first half.
"I have to give a lot of credit to
[defensive coordinator] Derek Ma
son," Shaw said. "Just knowing that
we had to contain these guys. Par
tially based on what happened in
Utah, the swing passes giving up
seven, eight yards a chunk. We
shored up that. We knew [Hundley]

Sophomore wide reciever Kodi Whitfield (middle) made a specatcular circus catch to help propel the
Cardinal to a key victory against then-No. 9 UCLA Saturday in front of a sold-out Homecoming crowd.
Hundley for the second time in the
game at the UCLA 40-yard line.
Working with a short field, Stanford
gave Gaffney the ball five times in a
row behind its big offensive line to
extend its lead to 14 and put the
game away.
"If we can stay on the clock and
run the ball with efficiency, we have
a chance to do what we want to do,
which is run the ball between the
tackles," Shaw said. "Guys wanted
to bounce back. They wanted to
turn the page and move on, and the
advice that I gave them earlier was,
'Bring last week with you. Bring the
lessons learned about how hard you
have to play, about how smart you
have to play and about how you
have to finish.'"
The first half proved to be a de
fensive slugfest. The Cardinal
opened the game with a promising
drive that came up empty when jun
ior wide receiver Ty Montgomery
dropped a well-thrown deep ball
from junior quarterback Kevin
Hogan inside the 10-yard line. Bru
ins running back Malcom Jones got
things started for his team with a
few runs to the outside, but the
UCLA offense ultimately stalled
before it could cross midfield.
Stanford and UCLA then traded
three-and-outs before the Cardinal
offense started to open up on its
third drive towards the end of the
first quarter. Hogan dropped back
to pass nine times during the pos
session he hit junior wide re
ceivers Devon Cajuste and Jordan
Pratt for first downs and also
picked up 24 yards on three carries
and looked comfortable in the
pocket for the first time in two
weeks.
But an inopportune fumble by
senior halfback Anthony Wilkerson
at the UCLA 12-yard line forced the
Cardinal into a first-and-20 hole af
ter Hogan somehow fought off two
Bruin defenders to recover the ball
at the 20-yard line. Stanford had to
settle for a field goal attempt, and
sophomore kicker Conrad
Ukropina, who filled in for an in
jured Jordan Williamson, made a
31-yard boot for the first field goal
of his college career.
The defensive battle continued
in the second quarter, as the Bruins
suffered two three-and-outs in a
row while Hogan was intercepted
right before halftime when his pass
bounced off a sliding Cajuste right
into the hands of cornerback Ish
mael Adams deep in Bruin territo
ry. Still, the Cardinal defense held
its end of the bargain by limiting
Hundley to just five-of-10 passing
for 37 yards and 8 yards on three
carries in the first half.
"I have to give a lot of credit to
[defensive coordinator] Derek Ma
son," Shaw said. "Just knowing that
we had to contain these guys. Par
tially based on what happened in
Utah, the swing passes giving up
seven, eight yards a chunk. We
shored up that. We knew [Hundley]

is hard to bring down. He's a big,
physical guy, but he's also an ath
lete, so we had to keep contain of
him."
The Cardinal's three-point ad
vantage at the half was far from a
comfortable lead, especially consid
ering that the Bruins came into the
game outscoring their opponents
71-0 in the third quarter this sea
son. Hundley showed a glimpse of
that third-quarter explosiveness
when he broke contain to scramble
for 30 yards on the opening drive.
However, Stanford's defense buck
led down and forced UCLA to settle
for a field goal.
"We wanted to keep [Hundley]
in the box," said fifth-year senior
outside linebacker Trent Murphy,
who sacked the slippery Hundley
twice. "Unfortunately he got out on
us a couple times, but that's going to
happen. He's a phenomenal player,
a great kid. He holds the key to
their offense... But the key is us all
hunting together, keeping it in the

box and putting pressure."
Unlike last weekend, the Cardi
nal offense answered when it need
ed to. After connecting with Mont
gomery for 29 yards, Hogan
launched a deep ball a late throw,
even though the Bruin safety was
out of position into the end zone,
where sophomore wide receiver Ko
di Whitfield made an unbelievable
one-handed touchdown catch de
spite tight coverage by the corner.
The score put the Cardinal back up

by seven midway through the third
quarter.
"It was a phenomenal catch,"
Murphy said. "Once I saw it up in
the air, I started jogging out for the
PAT because I knew [Whitfield] was
coming down with it."
"Unbelievable," Hogan added.
"He just went up and made a play.
I can't wait to see it on Sports-
Center."

Three plays later, it was the de
fense's turn to come up big. On

third-and-7, Hundley unwisely
launched the ball down the sideline
and was picked off by Richards,
who would finish the game with a
team-high 10 tackles. Although
Richards ran the interception back
into the end zone, the touchdown
was called back because of a holding
penalty on junior linebacker James
Vaughters. But no harm was done,
as Hogan found Cajuste in the mid
dle of the field for 34 yards and
Gaffney punched it in three plays
later on third-and-goal for a 1-yard
touchdown run to give the Cardinal
a 17-3 lead.
"Dominant, dominant," said
Shaw, describing Richards' play on
Saturday. "The year that Ed
Reynolds has had or had last year,
the ball is staying away from Ed.
What Ed put on film last year
leading the nation in interception
return yardage has led him to
not have a lot of opportunities. The
ball is going Jordan's way. Jordan's
doing a great job of disguising cov
erage ... He's athletic, he's smart.
He's our other quarterback back
there."
Hundley would find wideout
Shaquelle Evans for a 3-yard touch
down at the start of the fourth quar
ter, but the Cardinal defense held
steady and kept Stanford's seven
point lead safe despite Ukropina
missing a 46-yard field goal attempt
way wide right.
Stanford's offense went three
and-out on three straight running
plays with the fourth quarter wind
ing down, but Richards' second in
terception of the day and Gaffney's
workhorse performance sealed the
game minutes later.
Stanford will travel to Corvallis,
Ore., to take on Oregon State next
weekend before its highly anticipat
ed date with No. 2 Oregon on Nov. 7.
