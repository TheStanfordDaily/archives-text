# GAME ON
## CARD BOUNCES BACK AGAINST UCLA 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Late in the fourth quarter, with
his team up by seven, senior tail
back Tyler Gaffney looked at head
coach David Shaw and said,
"Coach, I ain't tired."
"We're not taking you out any
more," Shaw responded.
Shaw wasn't going to pass the ball
after what had happened in Salt
Lake City the week before, and
Gaffney certainly wasn't going to let
his team's Pac-12 title hopes slip away

Gaffney rushed for a career
high 171 yards and two touch
downs on 36 carries to propel No.
13 Stanford (6-1, 4-1 Pac-12) past
No. 9 UCLA (5-1,2-1) 24-10 in Sat
urday's Homecoming game. The
Cardinal bounced back in emphat
ic fashion from its heartbreaking
loss to Utah last weekend, and its
goal of repeating as Pac-12 cham

pions along with its slim
chances of playing for the national
championship remains intact.
After giving up 410 yards of to
tal offense to the Utes, the Cardi
nal defense played lights out even
by its own high standards, harass
ing Bruin star quarterback Brett
Hundley for most of the afternoon.
With fewer than three minutes
left in the game and his team cling
ing to a seven-point lead, junior
safety Jordan Richards picked off
