# Win sends message that Card is back
## 
### Sam Fisher 
In the face of its first Rose Bowl
elimination game, the Cardinal
stepped up in a big way. The 24-
10 win against UCLA Saturday
wasn't just a win, it was a win
that sent multiple statements to the
rest of the Pac-12.
The biggest statement was that
the loss to Utah was a fluke, not the
norm. Stanford seemed to play half of
its quarters well and half poorly over
the past few weeks. Amazingly it had
gotten to a point where I just wasn't
sure how good the Cardinal, or its
vaunted defense, was anymore.
Saturday, we found out that Stan
ford can still physically dominate very
good football teams and do so —at
least defensively for all four quar
ters. Fifth-year senior inside line
backer Shayne Skov was an animal on
the field, combining with fifth-year
senior defensive end Josh Mauro to
shut down the read-option game
alone. Junior strong safety Jordan
Richards bounced back from a game
where he looked exposed with a game
where he looked like an all-conference
player, flying around the field making
great plays.
On offense, though the Cardinal
certainly was not perfect, we got a
glimpse at Stanford finding its identi
ty again. Stanford converted eight of
10 third-and-short opportunities
six of seven running and two of three
passing—and wasn't afraid to go to
senior running back Tyler Gaffney
again and again and again (36 carries,
171 yards, two touchdowns and zero
negative plays).
Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan
was better as well. After an up-and
down last two weeks, Hogan was on
for almost the entire game, finishing
18-for-25 with 227 yards, a touchdown
and one interception (that wasn't his
fault at all). That average of more than
nine yards per attempt is right on par
with his strong early-season numbers
and probably should have been even
higher because junior wideout iy
Montgomery dropped a sure touch
down on the first drive of the game.
Speaking of Montgomery, per
haps the most impressive aspect of
Saturday's game for Hogan is that he
was able to be successful without
leaning on Montgomery. While Mont
gomery didn't have a bad game by
any means (five catches for 50 yards),
his performance was nowhere close
to the dominance we saw over the
past few games. Still, Hogan re
mained poised and found other tar
gets — namely Devon Cajuste, who
had a career day before going down
with a knee injury, which we're hear
ing isn't as bad as it initially looked. If
Hogan can continue to play like he did
on Saturday, it's hard to imagine any
team besides Oregon can beat the
Cardinal.
And on the same day as Stanford's
bounce-back performance, a Utah
team playing with and without a
banged-up Travis Wilson lost at Ari
zona, reminding the conference that
Utah's good performance last Satur
day night was just as fluky as Stan
ford's bad performance, and it took
every bit of flukiness for the Cardinal
to leave Salt Lake City with a loss.
Utah wasn't the only Cardinal op
ponent to lose in Arizona last night
either. Washington continued its
shocking downward spiral with an
embarrassing 53-24 loss at Arizona
State, a team that the Cardinal man
handled at Stanford Stadium earlier
in the year.
I'm not sure how the Washington
blowout loss will directly affect Stan
ford the rest of the way, but it's cer
tainly a reminder that playing on the
road in the Pac-12 can be a surprising
ly difficult challenge, no matter whom
the opponent is.
That game also shook up the Pac
-12 pecking order a bit, as there is no
longer a clear* fourth-place team be
hind Stanford, Oregon and UCLA. If
Stanford can take care of business at
Oregon State this Saturday, then the
race for fourth becomes even more
complicated, but it won't include the
Cardinal.
So as disappointing as the loss at
Utah was, Stanford's win over UCLA,
combined with all of the other crazy
results throughout the country Satur
day showed me that the Cardinal,
somehow, is still alive for everything it
wanted to achieve at the start of the
year*. Isn't that something?

Sam Fisher would consent to a knee
transplant if it meant returning
junior receiver Devon Cajuste to
full health. Recommend him an or
thopedic surgeon at safisher@Stan
