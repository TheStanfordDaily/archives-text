# SPORTS BRIEFS
## Stanford ranked No. 6 in first BCS rankings 
### â€“ Sam Fisher 
Fresh off a bounce-back win against then-No. 9 UCLA
Saturday afternoon, Stanford football earned the No. 6 spot
in the first BCS rankings released Sunday night.
The top two teams in the BCS rankings at the end of the
season will play in the BCS National Championship Game.
Any team ranked in the top 14 is eligible for an at-large bid in
to another BCS bowl.
The Cardinal came in at No. 8 in all three major human
polls: the Harris Poll, USA Today Coaches Poll and the AP
Poll. Stanford was the highest ranked one-loss team but was
behind every undefeated team from an AQ-conference be

sides No. 9 Texas Tech.
The computer rankings, however, propelled the Cardinal
past No. 7 Miami and No. 8 Baylor for the sixth spot in the
BCS. Stanford had an average ranking of sixth in the comput
er polls, four higher than Miami and six higher than Baylor.
The Pac-12 has four teams ranked in the BCS top 25: Ore
gon, Stanford, UCLA and Oregon State.
Oregon leads the way at No. 3, just a hair behind Florida
State, which used a No. 1 computer ranking to move past the
Ducks. UCLA dropped only two spots in the human polls af
ter the loss to Stanford and came in at No. 12 in the BCS.
Oregon State is the surprising team to squeak into the
rankings at No. 25. The Beavers are unranked in both human
polls but are ranked No. 20 by the computers. Oregon State
hosts Stanford Saturday night at 7:30 p.m.
