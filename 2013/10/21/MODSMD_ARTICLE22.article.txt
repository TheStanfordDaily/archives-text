# Men's soccer falls at No. 1 Cal on controversial penalty
## 
### â€“ Dylan Fugel 
Stanford gave the No. 1 team in the country a run for its
money, but a controversial penalty kick awarded to Cal with
less than five minutes remaining in the match gave the Bears
a 1-0 victory in Berkeley Sunday afternoon.
Senior goalkeeper Drew Hutchins dove to his left, easily
palming away the penalty that had been placed there by Cal's
Steve Birnbaum. But the senior could only lay prostrate after
the save and watch as the rebound fell directly to the feet of
Birnbaum with no defender in sight. Hutchins flailed out a de
spairing hand, but to no avail. With four minutes remaining,
Birnbaum had given Cal the lead that it would go on to keep
for the rest of the match.
In a match marred by the questionable penalty decision,
the top-ranked Cal Bears (10-0-2, 4-0-1 Pac 12) eked out the

victory against Stanford (6-4-2, 1-3-1 Pac 12), retaining its
place at the top of the Pac-12 standings. Birnbaum's penalty
took him to a Pac-12-leading eight goals, while the loss ex
tended a recent run of poor luck for Stanford, which has
earned only one point from its last four games in conference
play.
Stanford returns home for its next match hoping to regain
momentum. The Cardinal welcomes the USF Dons to Cagan
Stadium Friday night at 7 p.m.
