# Men's Rowing snags third at Head of the Charles Regatta

The Stanford men's rowing squad finished third at the
Head of the Charles Regatta Sunday in Boston and, for the
second consecutive year, was the highest placing collegiate
team in the field.
In its 2013-14 season debut, the Card used a dramatic,
late-race surge to best the Washington Huskies by nearly four
seconds. The lineup, anchored by one of the nation's best
young rowers, senior Austin Hack, was in seventh after the
first of four time splits and in sixth after the third split. Stan
ford then turned on the jets, recording the second-fastest fi
nal split to earn a third-place overall finish behind profession
al teams Camp Randall Rowing Club and USRowing.
"Finishing strong was something we were talking about
before the race," Hack told gostanford.com. "We really want
ed to empty our tanks at the end, and being able to do that
helped us out for our finish."
The Card next competes at the Head of the American com
petition Oct. 28 in Gold River, Calif.
