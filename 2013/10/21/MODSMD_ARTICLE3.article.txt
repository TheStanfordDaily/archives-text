# Homecoming sees record numbers
## Youngest alumni groups get highest rise in participation rate 
### SKYLAR COHEN 
Reunion Homecoming Weekend
hit record attendance numbers this
year, with more than 6,850 alumni
and more than 9,510 individuals at
tending in total.
Leslie Winick, director of alumni
and student class outreach for the
Stanford Alumni Association, said
that the youngest alumni reunion
groups experienced the greatest
rise in participation this year, with
the largest gains seen in the five
year and 10-year reunions as well as
the Recent Grad Reunion for stu
dents who matriculated fewer than
five years ago.
Winick added that only 50 alum
ni attended the first year they invit-

Ed recently graduated classes back.
This year, they had over 1,000.
Howard Wolf 'BO, president of
the Stanford Alumni Association,
said that, if anything, online inter
connectivity has helped the process
of encouraging past students to
come back to the Farm and recon
nect face to face with their college
peers.
"We think Facebook is actually a
means to connect with each other
that then drives the desire for peo
ple to see each other in person,"
Wolf said. "There's a saying in Sili
con Valley the more high tech
things become, the more people
yearn for high touch."
This year, large emphasis was
placed on mini-reunions, in which
individuals who closely participat
ed in a club, fraternity or sorority
come together for events that
range from tailgating to food track
fairs. Once such reunion was that
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band
(LSJUMB), which celebrated its
50th year in its current irreverent
form.
For the first time ever, each
current undergraduate class'
plaque which will eventually be
placed in the Main Quad was
displayed in the Arrillaga Alumni
Center for alumni and students to
see.
Artful events and planning
strategies
The partnership with the Stan
ford Institute for Creativity and
the Arts has matured since its in
ception during last year's Home
coming. In addition to a strong
emphasis on the arts in schedule
handouts provided to attendees,
new events like the Arts Student
and Alumni Reception allowed the
arts to have a large impact on
alumni.
"Last year, we piloted the arts
program, and it was very small,"
Winick said. "Even though it's ac
tually technically not new, I feel
like we're honoring what [the
Stanford Institute for Creativity
and the Aits] are trying to do,
which is making the arts part of
Stanford."
A large part of the complexity
involved in the process of plan
ning Homecoming Weekend
every year is receiving and coor
dinating the input of each alumni
year's volunteers, who are re
sponsible for planning and exe
cuting the weekend's event offer
ings.
According to Winick, a large
part of the creative process comes
from the alumni themselves. For

example, a reunion class helped
initiate the use of food trucks at
last year's Homecoming Weekend.
Some details, on the other
hand, simply could not be worked
out in advance due to factors be
yond the organizational team's
control. According to Wolf, no
fewer than 12 different scenarios
had to be planned in regards to
the kick-off time the start time
was not determined until Oct. 9
for the football game against

UCLA, which Stanford won 24-10.
Overall, the planned events
were able to help Stanford gradu
ates reconnect with each other and
also meet potential future mem
bers of the Farm family.
"I saw a baby [Friday]. She was
three months old," Winick said.
"She had a nametag on that said
Class of 2033."

yearn for high touch."
This year, large emphasis was
placed on mini-reunions, in which
individuals who closely participat
ed in a club, fraternity or sorority
come together for events that
range from tailgating to food track
fairs. Once such reunion was that
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band
(LSJUMB), which celebrated its
50th year in its current irreverent
form.
For the first time ever, each
current undergraduate class'
plaque which will eventually be
placed in the Main Quad was
displayed in the Arrillaga Alumni
Center for alumni and students to
see.
Artful events and planning
strategies
The partnership with the Stan
ford Institute for Creativity and
the Arts has matured since its in
ception during last year's Home
coming. In addition to a strong
emphasis on the arts in schedule
handouts provided to attendees,
new events like the Arts Student
and Alumni Reception allowed the
arts to have a large impact on
alumni.
"Last year, we piloted the arts
program, and it was very small,"
Winick said. "Even though it's ac
tually technically not new, I feel
like we're honoring what [the
Stanford Institute for Creativity
and the Aits] are trying to do,
which is making the arts part of
Stanford."
A large part of the complexity
involved in the process of plan
ning Homecoming Weekend
every year is receiving and coor
dinating the input of each alumni
year's volunteers, who are re
sponsible for planning and exe
cuting the weekend's event offer
ings.
According to Winick, a large
part of the creative process comes
from the alumni themselves. For

example, a reunion class helped
initiate the use of food trucks at
last year's Homecoming Weekend.
Some details, on the other
hand, simply could not be worked
out in advance due to factors be
yond the organizational team's
control. According to Wolf, no
fewer than 12 different scenarios
had to be planned in regards to
the kick-off time the start time
was not determined until Oct. 9
for the football game against

UCLA, which Stanford won 24-10.
Overall, the planned events
were able to help Stanford gradu
ates reconnect with each other and
also meet potential future mem
bers of the Farm family.
"I saw a baby [Friday]. She was
three months old," Winick said.
"She had a nametag on that said
Class of 2033."

Reunion Homecoming Weekend
hit record attendance numbers this
year, with more than 6,850 alumni
and more than 9,510 individuals at
tending in total.
Leslie Winick, director of alumni
and student class outreach for the
Stanford Alumni Association, said
that the youngest alumni reunion
groups experienced the greatest
rise in participation this year, with
the largest gains seen in the five
year and 10-year reunions as well as
the Recent Grad Reunion for stu
dents who matriculated fewer than
five years ago.
Winick added that only 50 alum
ni attended the first year they invit-

Ed recently graduated classes back.
This year, they had over 1,000.
Howard Wolf 'BO, president of
the Stanford Alumni Association,
said that, if anything, online inter
connectivity has helped the process
of encouraging past students to
come back to the Farm and recon
nect face to face with their college
peers.
"We think Facebook is actually a
means to connect with each other
that then drives the desire for peo
ple to see each other in person,"
Wolf said. "There's a saying in Sili
con Valley the more high tech
things become, the more people
yearn for high touch."
