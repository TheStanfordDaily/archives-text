## Youngest alumni groups get highest rise in participation rate 
### SKYLAR COHEN 
Reunion Homecoming Weekend
hit record attendance numbers this
year, with more than 6,850 alumni
and more than 9,510 individuals at
tending in total.
Leslie Winick, director of alumni
and student class outreach for the
Stanford Alumni Association, said
that the youngest alumni reunion
groups experienced the greatest
rise in participation this year, with
the largest gains seen in the five
year and 10-year reunions as well as
the Recent Grad Reunion for stu
dents who matriculated fewer than
five years ago.
Winick added that only 50 alum
ni attended the first year they invit-

Ed recently graduated classes back.
This year, they had over 1,000.
Howard Wolf 'BO, president of
the Stanford Alumni Association,
said that, if anything, online inter
connectivity has helped the process
of encouraging past students to
come back to the Farm and recon
nect face to face with their college
peers.
"We think Facebook is actually a
means to connect with each other
that then drives the desire for peo
ple to see each other in person,"
Wolf said. "There's a saying in Sili
con Valley the more high tech
things become, the more people
yearn for high touch."
