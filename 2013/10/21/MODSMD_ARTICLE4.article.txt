## Roundtable 2013 talks happiness, well-being A 						panel of experts from diverse fields discuss happiness research 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
What does it mean to be happy?
Can we control happiness? Are we
happiness junkies?
These questions and more were
discussed at the 2013 Roundtable
at Stanford last Friday, hosted by
Katie Couric.
The five-person panel titled
"Are You Happy Now? The New
Science of Happiness and Wellbe
ing" featured experts in the
fields of psychology, business, neu
roscience and design discussing re
search on happiness that has re
cently grown in popularity.
"I thought it was an opportuni

ty to have a really interesting, stim
ulating conversation with a lot of
very intelligent and accomplished
people," Couric said in an interview
after the event.
During the panel, Couric pointed
out that, in the last month, more
than 1,000 new books about happi
ness have appeared on Amazon.
Panelist Sonja Lyubomirsky
Ph.D. '94, a psychology professor
and director of the Positive Psychol
ogy Lab at the UC-Riverside, ex
plained that, in many parts of the
western world, people have achieved
a level of comfort that has enabled a
focus on finding happiness.
"We are able to devote more time
to researching happiness and have
learned that it is something that can
be measured," Lyubomirsky said.
Measures of happiness
One of the research topics on
the measure of happiness brought
up by lan Gotlib chair of the
department of psychology and di
rector of the Stanford Mood and
Anxiety Disorders Laboratory
was that people have different set
points of happiness, along with
set points of friendliness, aggres
siveness and other such charac
teristics.
"This set point is influenced by
genetics but also by your upbring
ing and environment," he said.
"When you experience events that
are positive or negative, you fluctu
ate around this set point, but you
always return to it."

Lyubomirsky provided further
evidence of the role of nature and
nurture on happiness measure
ments.
"Studies have been done on
identical twins versus fraternal
twins and have found that identical
twins have a more similar happi
ness level than fraternal twins, in
dicating the genetic component of
happiness," Lyubomirsky said.
"But there is a component of what
you do in your everyday life that af
fects it. If you learn happiness
habits, you can raise your happi
ness set point."
David Kelley M.S. '7B, founder
of the global design consultancy
IDEO and professor in mechanical
engineering, personally tested the
influence of one's own habits on
raising happiness levels when he
was diagnosed with throat cancer
in 2007.
He said that he focused on his

calling in life and doing something
of importance, which led to him
finding meaning in his life during
the medical ordeal.
"I'd recommend a diagnosis of a
terminal illness [to achieve more
happiness], as long as you don't ac
tually have one," Kelley said. "If
you're going to try to survive the
illness, you get excited about what
is fun in your life."
The flipside of happiness
The panelists also addressed
the topics of depression and anxi
ety, focusing on the increase in
rates of these illnesses over the
years.
Gotlib explained that the rates
are higher for younger people and
that, while there are many theories
as to why this is the case, there is
no definitive reason.

Lyubomirsky said that she felt
that there was a norm or desirabil

ity to be happy, with a lot of closet
ed unhappiness as a consequence.
"We shouldn't be happy all the
time," she said. "Negative emotions
have their value. They become a
problem when they are chronic."
Lyubomirsky also discussed the
term "hedonic adaptation," in
which a person gradually gets used
to the new things in his or her life
and stops gaining the positive ef
fects he or she originally gained.
"Appreciating what you have
combats this adaptation," she said.
"You must savor what you have and
put less focus on what you don't
have."
The need for reflection
In reviewing studies and re
search on happiness, the panelists
also offered the audience their per
sonal tips on how to achieve happi
ness in their day-to-day lives.
Kelley emphasized the impor

tance of being present and mindful
in your life and awareness about
the good things happening to you.
"You should celebrate the posi
tive things so that they stick," he
said.
For Jennifer Aaker Ph.D. '95,
professor of marketing at the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business,
understanding how one is spending
one's time is key for gaining happi
ness.
"We feel like we don't have
enough time during the day and so
our stress increases, and this can
drive unhappiness," she said.
"Think about how you are spending
your time. What experiences are
you going through? Are you pres
ent during everything? What is the
nature of your relationships? Are
you happy?"

Can we control happiness? Are we
happiness junkies?
These questions and more were
discussed at the 2013 Roundtable
at Stanford last Friday, hosted by
Katie Couric.
The five-person panel titled
"Are You Happy Now? The New
Science of Happiness and Wellbe
ing" featured experts in the
fields of psychology, business, neu
roscience and design discussing re
search on happiness that has re
cently grown in popularity.
"I thought it was an opportuni

ty to have a really interesting, stim
ulating conversation with a lot of
very intelligent and accomplished
people," Couric said in an interview
after the event.
During the panel, Couric pointed
out that, in the last month, more
than 1,000 new books about happi
ness have appeared on Amazon.
Panelist Sonja Lyubomirsky
Ph.D. '94, a psychology professor
and director of the Positive Psychol
ogy Lab at the UC-Riverside, ex
plained that, in many parts of the
western world, people have achieved
a level of comfort that has enabled a
focus on finding happiness.
"We are able to devote more time
to researching happiness and have
learned that it is something that can
be measured," Lyubomirsky said.
Measures of happiness
One of the research topics on
the measure of happiness brought
up by lan Gotlib chair of the
department of psychology and di
rector of the Stanford Mood and
Anxiety Disorders Laboratory
was that people have different set
points of happiness, along with
set points of friendliness, aggres
siveness and other such charac
teristics.
"This set point is influenced by
genetics but also by your upbring
ing and environment," he said.
"When you experience events that
are positive or negative, you fluctu
ate around this set point, but you
always return to it."

Lyubomirsky provided further
evidence of the role of nature and
nurture on happiness measure
ments.
"Studies have been done on
identical twins versus fraternal
twins and have found that identical
twins have a more similar happi
ness level than fraternal twins, in
dicating the genetic component of
happiness," Lyubomirsky said.
"But there is a component of what
you do in your everyday life that af
fects it. If you learn happiness
habits, you can raise your happi
ness set point."
David Kelley M.S. '7B, founder
of the global design consultancy
IDEO and professor in mechanical
engineering, personally tested the
influence of one's own habits on
raising happiness levels when he
was diagnosed with throat cancer
in 2007.
He said that he focused on his

calling in life and doing something
of importance, which led to him
finding meaning in his life during
the medical ordeal.
"I'd recommend a diagnosis of a
terminal illness [to achieve more
happiness], as long as you don't ac
tually have one," Kelley said. "If
you're going to try to survive the
illness, you get excited about what
is fun in your life."
The flipside of happiness
The panelists also addressed
the topics of depression and anxi
ety, focusing on the increase in
rates of these illnesses over the
years.
Gotlib explained that the rates
are higher for younger people and
that, while there are many theories
as to why this is the case, there is
no definitive reason.

Lyubomirsky said that she felt
that there was a norm or desirabil

ity to be happy, with a lot of closet
ed unhappiness as a consequence.
"We shouldn't be happy all the
time," she said. "Negative emotions
have their value. They become a
problem when they are chronic."
Lyubomirsky also discussed the
term "hedonic adaptation," in
which a person gradually gets used
to the new things in his or her life
and stops gaining the positive ef
fects he or she originally gained.
"Appreciating what you have
combats this adaptation," she said.
"You must savor what you have and
put less focus on what you don't
have."
The need for reflection
In reviewing studies and re
search on happiness, the panelists
also offered the audience their per
sonal tips on how to achieve happi
ness in their day-to-day lives.
Kelley emphasized the impor

tance of being present and mindful
in your life and awareness about
the good things happening to you.
"You should celebrate the posi
tive things so that they stick," he
said.
For Jennifer Aaker Ph.D. '95,
professor of marketing at the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business,
understanding how one is spending
one's time is key for gaining happi
ness.
"We feel like we don't have
enough time during the day and so
our stress increases, and this can
drive unhappiness," she said.
"Think about how you are spending
your time. What experiences are
you going through? Are you pres
ent during everything? What is the
nature of your relationships? Are
you happy?"
