### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
What does it mean to be happy?
Can we control happiness? Are we
happiness junkies?
These questions and more were
discussed at the 2013 Roundtable
at Stanford last Friday, hosted by
Katie Couric.
The five-person panel titled
"Are You Happy Now? The New
Science of Happiness and Wellbe
ing" featured experts in the
fields of psychology, business, neu
roscience and design discussing re
search on happiness that has re
cently grown in popularity.
"I thought it was an opportuni

ty to have a really interesting, stim
ulating conversation with a lot of
very intelligent and accomplished
people," Couric said in an interview
after the event.
During the panel, Couric pointed
out that, in the last month, more
than 1,000 new books about happi
ness have appeared on Amazon.
Panelist Sonja Lyubomirsky
Ph.D. '94, a psychology professor
and director of the Positive Psychol
ogy Lab at the UC-Riverside, ex
plained that, in many parts of the
western world, people have achieved
a level of comfort that has enabled a
focus on finding happiness.
"We are able to devote more time
to researching happiness and have
learned that it is something that can
be measured," Lyubomirsky said.
