## Miss California shares pageant insights 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
Crystal Lee 'l3 M.A. 'l3, Miss
California 2013 and First Runner-
Up to Miss America 2014, returned
to her junior year home in EAST
House last Thursday to discuss her
life in the world of pageants and
what role these beauty events play
in conversations of sexism and femi
nism.
Lee opened up the conversation
by talking about how she first start
ed competing in pageants at the age
of 15 to finance her college educa
tion.
"When I was in high school, I
started thinking about college, and I
didn't really realize how expensive
college was," Lee said. "I looked at
the number for the very first time,
and I looked at how much I would
earn at a part-time job working at
Taco Bell, and I did the actual
math."
While at Stanford, she had to
juggle multiple activities while con
tinuing to pursue her pageant career
as Miss Chinatown USA 2010. She
graduated with a B.A. in human biol
ogy and an M.A. in communication
after only 11 quarters at Stanford.
"You learn time management
from day one... because at the end
of the day, if you want to do it, you'll
make time for it," Lee said. "It's
something that I think all Stanford
students are really good at."
Talking about the Miss America
organization, Lee acknowledged
that while it is "notoriously conser
vative," she also believes that the

next frontier of pageants will include
both transgender and openly gay
contestants.
"We have not had an openly gay
Miss America yet. Yet. But... I think
it will happen in the next 30 or 40
years," Lee said. "And the reason
why I say that is because there have
been lesbian contestants in the past.
I think it will change inevitably."

Despite her success at many pag
eant contests, Lee admitted that she
sometimes had to "play the game"
even if it meant compromising per
sonal choices.
In particular, she described how
she came up short in her first ap
pearance in the Miss California pag-

eant, where she wondered if
her decision to perform a
Chinese dance her first year
had affected her chances of
winning.
"A lot of the volunteers
and the audience members
came up to me afterwards,
and they said, 'Oh you would
have won, but you did a Chi
nese dance. No one gets that.
They don't get it,'" Lee said."
And I hate to say it, but I
changed it to ballet [for the
second year], and I won."
Being a pageant partici
pant provided Lee with an
unconventional perspective
on feminism.
Lee said that while some
people believe that women
have to act more like men to
succeed in the professional
world, she learned there is
nothing wrong with women
using their own power to ob
tain their goals, even if it is in
a pageant setting.
She added that the social
impact of pageants them
selves call into question is
sues of gender and feminine
beauty.

"Essentially, pageants
have changed a lot, and it's
arguable as to whether pag
eants have led the way in the
way people think or whether
pageants are just a reflection
of society and a reflection of
the changing ideals of beau
ty," Lee said.
Thanh Nguyen 'l4, who
met Lee when she was a
freshman year and was a pri
mary coordinator for the
event, said that he was
pleased with the audience's
high level of engagement and
willingness to ask difficult
questions. He also applauded
Lee's thoughtful and candid
responses.
"She represents the [Miss
America] organization so
she's certainly limited in

what she can say," Nguyen
said. "After talking with some
students, they felt a little bit
uncomfortable by some of
her answers, which is fine be
cause it's a tricky topic."
Through her platform as
Miss California, Lee aims to
empower women in science,
technology, engineering and
math (STEM). She herself has
interned at Dropbox and has
been involved with Nanoly, a
startup working towards elim
inating the difficulties of vac
cine transportation.
"The issue I care about is
getting more women in
STEM fields," Lee said. "So
anything related to Stanford
and coming back here is al
ways something that I really
enjoy and something that the
organization will let me do."
After her reign as Miss
California, she wants to start
her own company and contin
ue in the STEM fields.
"I already have a few in
teresting opportunities com
ing up, and I'm already start
ing to lay the groundwork be
cause, you know, Rome was
n't built in a day," Lee said.
"So I'm already thinking
about next July."

Crystal Lee 'l3 M.A. 'l3, Miss
California 2013 and First Runner-
Up to Miss America 2014, returned
to her junior year home in EAST
House last Thursday to discuss her
life in the world of pageants and
what role these beauty events play
in conversations of sexism and femi
nism.
Lee opened up the conversation
by talking about how she first start
ed competing in pageants at the age
of 15 to finance her college educa
tion.
"When I was in high school, I
started thinking about college, and I
didn't really realize how expensive
college was," Lee said. "I looked at
the number for the very first time,
and I looked at how much I would
earn at a part-time job working at
Taco Bell, and I did the actual
math."
While at Stanford, she had to
juggle multiple activities while con
tinuing to pursue her pageant career
as Miss Chinatown USA 2010. She
graduated with a B.A. in human biol
ogy and an M.A. in communication
after only 11 quarters at Stanford.
"You learn time management
from day one... because at the end
of the day, if you want to do it, you'll
make time for it," Lee said. "It's
something that I think all Stanford
students are really good at."
Talking about the Miss America
organization, Lee acknowledged
that while it is "notoriously conser
vative," she also believes that the

next frontier of pageants will include
both transgender and openly gay
contestants.
"We have not had an openly gay
Miss America yet. Yet. But... I think
it will happen in the next 30 or 40
years," Lee said. "And the reason
why I say that is because there have
been lesbian contestants in the past.
I think it will change inevitably."

Despite her success at many pag
eant contests, Lee admitted that she
sometimes had to "play the game"
even if it meant compromising per
sonal choices.
In particular, she described how
she came up short in her first ap
pearance in the Miss California pag-

story as a pageant contestant and her thoughts on feminism.
eant, where she wondered if
her decision to perform a
Chinese dance her first year
had affected her chances of
winning.
"A lot of the volunteers
and the audience members
came up to me afterwards,
and they said, 'Oh you would
have won, but you did a Chi
nese dance. No one gets that.
They don't get it,'" Lee said."
And I hate to say it, but I
changed it to ballet [for the
second year], and I won."
Being a pageant partici
pant provided Lee with an
unconventional perspective
on feminism.
Lee said that while some
people believe that women
have to act more like men to
succeed in the professional
world, she learned there is
nothing wrong with women
using their own power to ob
tain their goals, even if it is in
a pageant setting.
She added that the social
impact of pageants them
selves call into question is
sues of gender and feminine
beauty.

"Essentially, pageants
have changed a lot, and it's
arguable as to whether pag
eants have led the way in the
way people think or whether
pageants are just a reflection
of society and a reflection of
the changing ideals of beau
ty," Lee said.
Thanh Nguyen 'l4, who
met Lee when she was a
freshman year and was a pri
mary coordinator for the
event, said that he was
pleased with the audience's
high level of engagement and
willingness to ask difficult
questions. He also applauded
Lee's thoughtful and candid
responses.
"She represents the [Miss
America] organization so
she's certainly limited in

what she can say," Nguyen
said. "After talking with some
students, they felt a little bit
uncomfortable by some of
her answers, which is fine be
cause it's a tricky topic."
Through her platform as
Miss California, Lee aims to
empower women in science,
technology, engineering and
math (STEM). She herself has
interned at Dropbox and has
been involved with Nanoly, a
startup working towards elim
inating the difficulties of vac
cine transportation.
"The issue I care about is
getting more women in
STEM fields," Lee said. "So
anything related to Stanford
and coming back here is al
ways something that I really
enjoy and something that the
organization will let me do."
After her reign as Miss
California, she wants to start
her own company and contin
ue in the STEM fields.
"I already have a few in
teresting opportunities com
ing up, and I'm already start
ing to lay the groundwork be
cause, you know, Rome was
