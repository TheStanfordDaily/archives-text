## Miss California shares pageant insights 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
Crystal Lee 'l3 M.A. 'l3, Miss
California 2013 and First Runner-
Up to Miss America 2014, returned
to her junior year home in EAST
House last Thursday to discuss her
life in the world of pageants and
what role these beauty events play
in conversations of sexism and femi
nism.
Lee opened up the conversation
by talking about how she first start
ed competing in pageants at the age
of 15 to finance her college educa
tion.
"When I was in high school, I
started thinking about college, and I
didn't really realize how expensive
college was," Lee said. "I looked at
the number for the very first time,
and I looked at how much I would
earn at a part-time job working at
Taco Bell, and I did the actual
math."
While at Stanford, she had to
juggle multiple activities while con
tinuing to pursue her pageant career
as Miss Chinatown USA 2010. She
graduated with a B.A. in human biol
ogy and an M.A. in communication
after only 11 quarters at Stanford.
"You learn time management
from day one... because at the end
of the day, if you want to do it, you'll
make time for it," Lee said. "It's
something that I think all Stanford
students are really good at."
Talking about the Miss America
organization, Lee acknowledged
that while it is "notoriously conser
vative," she also believes that the

next frontier of pageants will include
both transgender and openly gay
contestants.
"We have not had an openly gay
Miss America yet. Yet. But... I think
it will happen in the next 30 or 40
years," Lee said. "And the reason
why I say that is because there have
been lesbian contestants in the past.
I think it will change inevitably."

Despite her success at many pag
eant contests, Lee admitted that she
sometimes had to "play the game"
even if it meant compromising per
sonal choices.
In particular, she described how
she came up short in her first ap
pearance in the Miss California pag-
