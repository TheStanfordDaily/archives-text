## SURPS attracted diverse projects Presentations this year range from Natural Sciences to Creative Arts 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
The 2013 Symposium of Undergraduate
Research and Public Service (SURPS) fea
tured 115 student posters in the annual show
case of students' individual projects held at
the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
According to Vivienne Fong M.A. '95
Ph.D. '9B, the research programs director of
Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR), SURPS asks students to think about
how they will share their research and proj
ects with the larger community to inspire
peers to partake in the resources available for
independent work.
Robert Urstein, director of UAR and dean
of freshmen, said he encourages freshmen to
attend SURPS to get a broader scope of the
areas of study in which they can be involved.
He emphasized the value of SURPS for
gaining skills in all fields.
"We want students to appreciate that get
ting involved in research can help build skills
that are valuable past your education,"
Urstein said. "These skills can be applied to
different career paths and different areas of
interest."
According to Associate Dean of UAR Bri
an Thomas, SURPS is used as a link between
the research students are doing and how the
different majors at Stanford support those
students and allow them to do research.
"As you are exploring different majors,
you should attend SURPS," Thomas said.
"We want students to understand the impor
tance of research and show them that it's
what faculty are doing and it's what other stu
dents are doing."
Diverse projects
The diverse projects presented this year
were based in the Natural Sciences, Creative
Arts, Public Service, Social Sciences and Hu
manities and Engineering. Many of the proj
ects were funded by the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) though some received more uncon
ventional forms of funding.
Linta Reji 'l4 studied the diversity and
abundance of a certain type of gene in the es
tuary sediments of the San Francisco Bay
this past summer
"I can't explain how much I learned [this
summer]," Reji said. "If I were taking classes
instead, I wouldn't have learned as much. I
loved doing the research... I was really sad
when it ended, but I'm going to continue work
ing with this project over the next few years."
Laura Marsh 'l5 spent her summer doing

research at Chavin de Huantar, an archaeo
logical site in Peru, looking at ceramic origins
through thin-section analysis.
According to Marsh, she first went to
Chavin two summers ago with an archaeolo
gy field school program and wanted to return
this past summer in order to work on her own
personal research. Marsh's studies were
funded through a Major Grant from UAR.
"There's a lot that can and should be done
with [this data]," Marsh said. "I'd like to go
back this summer to take more data and look
further into it because now I have a better un
derstanding of how to look for it and how to
go about the process of analysis."
Marsh said she wants to turn her research
into an honors thesis in archaeology.
Natalie Griffen 'l4's project stemmed
from a personal curiosity and represented
work she had started as a rising junior. She
spent this past summer studying the process
of creating more comfortable high-heeled
shoes at the London College of Fashion.
"My research started with an interest in
sports shoes," Griffen said. "Why don't we
have nice shoes that make us feel good? I
want to translate the attitude of creating re
ally comfortable sports shoes into creating
more formal shoes."
Griffen received a Chappell Lougee Schol
arship when she was a sophomore that al
lowed her to spend the summer in London
studying how to make shoes. This past sum
mer, a Major Grant from the Engineering
Department helped her extend her research.
Jessica Savoie 'l4 took a distinct research
approach by interning with the Office for Civ
il Rights and Civil Liberties in the Depart
ment of Homeland Security (DHS).
"What I ended up doing was working with
a lot of immigration detention cases and ap
prehension cases," she said. "Basically, my
job as an intern was to be the first eyes on a
case. I would get a file or a complaint stack
[and] would help make decisions about what
to do with the case."
Unlike many other students, Savoie did
not get her fellowship through Stanford. In
stead, she sent out her resume to various gov
ernment departments and was contacted by
the DHS for an interview.
"It was hard for the University to under
stand that I got this on my own," she said. "I
had to call them to get proof of enrollment...
and the University was reluctant to release
that information because it wasn't through
Stanford."
Savoie did receive an award from Stan
ford's Public Policy Summer Internship
Funding program that enabled her to present
her work at SURPS.

with [this data]," Marsh said. "I'd like to go
back this summer to take more data and look
further into it because now I have a better un
derstanding of how to look for it and how to
go about the process of analysis."
Marsh said she wants to turn her research
into an honors thesis in archaeology.
Natalie Griffen 'l4's project stemmed
from a personal curiosity and represented
work she had started as a rising junior. She
spent this past summer studying the process
of creating more comfortable high-heeled
shoes at the London College of Fashion.
"My research started with an interest in
sports shoes," Griffen said. "Why don't we
have nice shoes that make us feel good? I
want to translate the attitude of creating re
ally comfortable sports shoes into creating
more formal shoes."
Griffen received a Chappell Lougee Schol
arship when she was a sophomore that al
lowed her to spend the summer in London
studying how to make shoes. This past sum
mer, a Major Grant from the Engineering
Department helped her extend her research.
Jessica Savoie 'l4 took a distinct research
approach by interning with the Office for Civ
il Rights and Civil Liberties in the Depart
ment of Homeland Security (DHS).
"What I ended up doing was working with
a lot of immigration detention cases and ap
prehension cases," she said. "Basically, my
job as an intern was to be the first eyes on a
case. I would get a file or a complaint stack
[and] would help make decisions about what
to do with the case."
Unlike many other students, Savoie did
not get her fellowship through Stanford. In
stead, she sent out her resume to various gov
ernment departments and was contacted by
the DHS for an interview.
"It was hard for the University to under
stand that I got this on my own," she said. "I
had to call them to get proof of enrollment...
and the University was reluctant to release
that information because it wasn't through
Stanford."
Savoie did receive an award from Stan
ford's Public Policy Summer Internship
Funding program that enabled her to present
her work at SURPS.

The 2013 Symposium of Undergraduate
Research and Public Service (SURPS) fea
tured 115 student posters in the annual show
case of students' individual projects held at
the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
According to Vivienne Fong M.A. '95
Ph.D. '9B, the research programs director of
Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR), SURPS asks students to think about
how they will share their research and proj
ects with the larger community to inspire
peers to partake in the resources available for
independent work.
Robert Urstein, director of UAR and dean
of freshmen, said he encourages freshmen to
attend SURPS to get a broader scope of the
areas of study in which they can be involved.
He emphasized the value of SURPS for
gaining skills in all fields.
"We want students to appreciate that get
ting involved in research can help build skills
that are valuable past your education,"
Urstein said. "These skills can be applied to
different career paths and different areas of
interest."
According to Associate Dean of UAR Bri
an Thomas, SURPS is used as a link between
the research students are doing and how the
different majors at Stanford support those
students and allow them to do research.
"As you are exploring different majors,
you should attend SURPS," Thomas said.
"We want students to understand the impor
tance of research and show them that it's
what faculty are doing and it's what other stu
dents are doing."
Diverse projects
The diverse projects presented this year
were based in the Natural Sciences, Creative
Arts, Public Service, Social Sciences and Hu
manities and Engineering. Many of the proj
ects were funded by the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) though some received more uncon
ventional forms of funding.
Linta Reji 'l4 studied the diversity and
abundance of a certain type of gene in the es
tuary sediments of the San Francisco Bay
this past summer
"I can't explain how much I learned [this
summer]," Reji said. "If I were taking classes
instead, I wouldn't have learned as much. I
loved doing the research... I was really sad
when it ended, but I'm going to continue work
ing with this project over the next few years."
Laura Marsh 'l5 spent her summer doing

research at Chavin de Huantar, an archaeo
logical site in Peru, looking at ceramic origins
through thin-section analysis.
According to Marsh, she first went to
Chavin two summers ago with an archaeolo
gy field school program and wanted to return
this past summer in order to work on her own
personal research. Marsh's studies were
funded through a Major Grant from UAR.
"There's a lot that can and should be done
with [this data]," Marsh said. "I'd like to go
