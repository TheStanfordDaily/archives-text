## School of Medicine study to help infertile women conceive 
### â€“ Michaela Elias 
A recent study by the Stanford University
School of Medicine has discovered away to
give some infertile women a second chance to
have children. Through the technique, one
woman in the experiment gave birth to a
healthy child.
The study, authored by Aaron Hsueh, pro
fessor of obstetrics and gynecology, aims to
combat Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI),
a condition that affects one percent of women
under 40. Women who suffer from this condi
tion are unable to become pregnant due to the
absence of mature follicles in their bodies. The
study suggests that a method called in vitro ac

tivation (IVA) might be able to reverse this
condition by stimulating small residual follicles
in the ovaries of women with POI.
Of the 27 women in Japan who have taken
part in the experiment so far, two women who
previously could not conceive were able to get
pregnant. One of these women miscarried, but
the other woman gave birth to a baby boy.
While the success rate is too low to make
the technique a standard option in the future,
the research has generated a huge amount of
interest worldwide.
"We want to get to the point where the
technology can identify who is likely to benefit
and if the results can be duplicated," said As
sociate Professor of Obstetric and Gynecology
Valerie Baker, one of the researchers who ran
the study. "We have to gain more experience
so we can optimize its effectiveness."
