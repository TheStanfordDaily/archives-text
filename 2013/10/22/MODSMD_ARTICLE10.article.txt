## Defense spurs two-victory weekend 
### LUKE ASPERGER 
Defense was the name of the
game for the Stanford men's water
polo team over Homecoming Week
end as the No. 4 Cardinal took
down No. 2 UCLA 8-6 on Saturday
and rolled past No. 11 UC-Davis
19-5 on Sunday.

Stanford (12-4) hosted UCLA
(19-2) Saturday morning, having
just fallen to the Bruins 10-5 the
previous week in the semifinals of
the UCI Invitational. During the
Oct. 13 match the Cardinal offense
suffered a 19-minute scoring
drought between its first two goals
at the hands of the UCLA defense.
This Saturday, however, was a dif
ferent story, as Stanford jumped
out to a 3-0 lead to start the first
half.
Freshman Jackson Kimbell put
the Cardinal on the scoreboard af
ter just one minute of play recover
ing a rebound on a shot by senior
Conner Cleary. Sophomore Bret
Bonanni added to the lead later in
the period by scoring off a UCLA
ejection.
In Stanford's first possession of
the second period, Cleary in
creased the lead to 3-0 by drilling a
shot over the head of UCLA goalie
Garrett Danner. The Bruins got on
to the scoreboard shortly after
when Aimone Barabino scored on a
counter, but Bonanni answered
