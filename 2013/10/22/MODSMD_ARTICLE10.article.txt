## Defense spurs two-victory weekend 
### LUKE ASPERGER 
Defense was the name of the
game for the Stanford men's water
polo team over Homecoming Week
end as the No. 4 Cardinal took
down No. 2 UCLA 8-6 on Saturday
and rolled past No. 11 UC-Davis
19-5 on Sunday.

Stanford (12-4) hosted UCLA
(19-2) Saturday morning, having
just fallen to the Bruins 10-5 the
previous week in the semifinals of
the UCI Invitational. During the
Oct. 13 match the Cardinal offense
suffered a 19-minute scoring
drought between its first two goals
at the hands of the UCLA defense.
This Saturday, however, was a dif
ferent story, as Stanford jumped
out to a 3-0 lead to start the first
half.
Freshman Jackson Kimbell put
the Cardinal on the scoreboard af
ter just one minute of play recover
ing a rebound on a shot by senior
Conner Cleary. Sophomore Bret
Bonanni added to the lead later in
the period by scoring off a UCLA
ejection.
In Stanford's first possession of
the second period, Cleary in
creased the lead to 3-0 by drilling a
shot over the head of UCLA goalie
Garrett Danner. The Bruins got on
to the scoreboard shortly after
when Aimone Barabino scored on a
counter, but Bonanni answered

with another goal after a
UCLA ejection. The back
and forth continued as Gor
don Marshall scored for
UCLA with two seconds left
in the half, cutting the Cardi
nal lead to 4-2.
Stanford came out strong
in the second half, running
up the score to 6-2 with goals
from Bonanni and sopho
more B.J. Churnside.
"It showed the momen
tum was on our side," Bo
nanni said. "We got two
goals right off the bat, and
that put us up four. That was
just kind of the nail in the
coffin for them."
With strong defense and
two more goals from Bonan
ni and senior Forrest
Watkins, the Card held on to
pick up the 8-6 win.
Freshman Drew Holland
was stellar in goal, with his
11 saves highlighted by an
incredible diving block on a
nearside shot from UCLA's
Jack Fellner on a seemingly
wide-open cage.
"We went to the same
high school so I kind of know
[Fellner's] tendencies," Hol
land said. "I wanted to bait
him a little bit to shoot to the
near side."
The Cardinal fervor con
tinued onto Sunday when

the Cardinal faced UC-
Davis (7-10). The Stanford
defense was flawless and its
offense deadly throughout
the first half, leaving the
scoreboard at Stanford 12,
UC-Davis 0.
The Aggies managed to
muster a little more offense
in the second half, but the
Card did not let up en route
to a 19-5 victory. Leading
Stanford's offense was jun
ior Alex Bowen, who
notched five goals during the
match. Bonanni added four,
Watkins had three, and
freshmen Adam Abdul
hamid and Griffin Bolan
scored two. In addition, sen
ior Paul Rudolph and fresh
man Reid Chase contributed
one goal apiece.
The key to Stanford's
success over the weekend
was defense, anchored in the
goal by Holland on Saturday
and senior Scott Platshon on
Sunday.
"We were trying a lot of
movement defense and that
takes a lot of communication
and coordination," said Stan
ford head coach John Var
gas. "That was the biggest
adjustment we made, and
the guys did a great job this
weekend."
The Cardinal will return
to the pool next Sunday when
it hosts No. 9 Pepperdine at
Avery Aquatic Center.
