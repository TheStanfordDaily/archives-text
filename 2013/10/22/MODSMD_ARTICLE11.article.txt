# INSTANT REPLAY: THE RED ZONE
## 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It seems rather ironic that of
fenses good enough to march to the
red zone so often sputter and die
once they get there. Defenses go to
their blitzes and bring the house.
Running backs are confronted by
piles of men where daylight once
appeared. Quarterbacks run
around but can't find an open man.
Much is made of red zone scoring
percentage, but even without forc
ing turnovers, teams win champi
onships by forcing field goals in the
red zone. It's the reason why head
coach David Shaw specifically han
dles play calling in the red zone.
Generally, inside the 20 is where
games are won.
In Saturday's win against then-
No. 9 UCLA, Stanford's stout de
fense held the Bruins to 10 points
nearly a fifth of UCLA's scoring
average on the season. The Bruins
never got anything going on of
fense except for a 75-yard drive in
the third quarter, which was
capped off by a 3-yard touchdown
pass to Shaq Evans to open the
fourth quarter.
Defenses tighten up in the red
zone because when they're backed
up against the wall, they don't have

to defend downfield anymore. Of
fenses can't fully stretch the field
with downfield passes, and with so
little space, game-breaking speed
becomes much less of a factor. That
removes the need for safeties to
protect the middle of the field
it's as if the defense gets an extra

player once it's lined up at the goal
line. Every defensive coordinator
in America will dial up the blitz
with this sort of advantage.
Stanford's defense lined up in
man coverage, each defender tak
ing the UCLA player across from
him. Free safety Ed Reynolds

green-dogged UCLA running back
Steven Manfro (R), blitzing if Man
fro pass-blocked and covering
Manfro if he tried to catch a pass.
Since football is an 11-on-ll game
and one offensive player has to car
ry the ball, Stanford could always
bring one more blitzer than UCLA
could handle.
As it was, UCLA's dual-threat
quarterback Brett Hundley had
repeatedly burned Stanford on
quarterback draws and scrambles,
and Stanford opted to drop line
backer A.J. Tarpley (M) in a spy
technique a few yards behind the
line of scrimmage so that Hundley
wouldn't be able to escape. Never
theless, with six pass rushers
against six blockers, one mistake
by UCLA and Hundley would be
running for his life.
UCLA called a fairly common
spacing concept to the left re
ceiver Devin Lucien (A) ran a fade
to the corner, while Evans (Z)
slanted to the inside. Manfro head
ed to the flat to threaten the de
fense. Hundley flowed to the play
side, with a backside slant behind
him to punish Stanford in case they
didn't spy a linebacker.
This combination is so popular

because it is effective against
both man and zone coverage.
A and Z ran rub routes, A
crossing over Z a combi
nation that defensive coach
es both more derisively and
more descriptively call "pick
routes." Manfro's route drew
away Ed Reynolds, opening
up a large space in the mid
dle of the field. Against man
coverage, with Lucien effec
tively blocking strong safety
Jordan Richards ($) with his
body, Evans could break in
side unimpeded and run free.
Against zone coverage,
Richards and Devon Car
rington (C) would simply ex
change coverage responsibil
ities and neutralize the rub
routes, but with Reynolds in

the middle of the field, there
would be nobody to cover
Manfro. Nevertheless, the
play relied on Hundley hav
ing enough time to throw the
ball.
Against Stanford's man
coverage, the routes unfold
ed perfectly Stanford's blitz
nearly got to Hundley not
one but three players came
close to sacking him but
Hundley hit the wide-open
Evans for six. What Hundley
later found out was that al
though the Bruins won that
battle, Stanford's pass rush
would harass him all game,
and that his pass would be
the last points the Bruins
would score that day. Stan
ford's defense was ultimately
triumphant, all but extin
guishing the Bruins' nation
al title hopes.
