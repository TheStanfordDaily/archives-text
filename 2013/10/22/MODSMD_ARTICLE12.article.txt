# STANFORD IN THE NFL
## LUCK TOPS MANNING 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Over a year and a half after being released by the
Colts, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning
finally returned to Indianapolis, receiving a warm
greeting from the city where he played for 14 years.
The reception from the man he was replaced by, how
ever, was not so kind.
Andrew Luck 'l2 orchestrated an efficient Colts
offense on Sunday that held the lead on the Broncos
for most of the game and eventually clinched a 39-33
victory over the previously unbeaten Broncos. Luck
delivered one of his best performances to date, finish
ing 21-for-38 with 228 yards passing and four total
touchdowns (three passing, one rushing). Luck also
rushed for 29 yards, outperforming Manning with a
65.4 QBR.
The Broncos had started the season with six con
secutive wins. Manning set numerous records for
passing statistics, including the most touchdowns
ever at this point in the season (22). On Sunday, how
ever, his replacement in Indianapolis, Luck, deserved
all the acclaim.
"It's not real fun watching him [from the side
lines]," Luck said to ESPN about Manning. "But he
is something to watch."
If anyone still questioned the Colts' decision to
move on from Manning and draft Luck before the
2012 season even after Luck led a nine-win im
provement on the previous season and took the Colts
to the playoffs last year, and even after it was re
vealed that Manning advocated the decision to draft
Luck this win had to make them consider other
wise.
While Luck may never post the same passing
yardage as Manning, Luck looked like the better
quarterback for much of Sunday's game, showing the
poise, maturity and decision-making needed to be an
elite quarterback in the NFL for years to come.
The future of Luck's Colts looks bright with the
quarterback performing at such a high level and the
team succeeding despite numerous injuries, includ
ing season-ending injuries to the top two running
backs on the depth chart at the season's start, Ahmad
Bradshaw and Vick Ballard. The Colts have now
beaten three of the NFLs top teams: the Broncos,
the Seahawks and the 49ers.
Colts tight end Coby Fleener 'l2 also caught five
passes for 38 yards, including an 8-yard score to give
the Colts a 26-14 lead with 10 seconds remaining in
the first half. He continues to build upon a successful
season in which he has already caught as many
touchdowns two as he did all of last year.

Chargers linebacker Thomas Keiser 'll, who was
recently activated by San Diego, had arguably his best
game yet as a professional this Sunday, recording three
tackles including two sacks and a pass defended,
as the Chargers beat the Jaguars 24-6. Reiser's per
formance on Sunday is a significant step towards solid
ifying his place on the Chargers 53-man roster.

Former Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck '12 (above) beat the man he replaced in
Indianapolis with a dominant performance Sunday night. Luck finished with four total
touchdowns in the Colts' victory over the Broncos and quarterback Peyton Manning.
Zach Ertz 'l2 caught
three passes for 33 yards as
the Eagles fell to the Cow
boys 17-3 at home on Sunday.
Ertz is one of the top targets
on a team that is struggling
to keep its quarterbacks
healthy with former USC
quarterback Matt Barkley
stepping in for second-string
quarterback Nick Foles who
left the game with a suspect
ed head injury. Barkley
threw three interceptions in
the game.

Ertz is one of the top targets
on a team that is struggling
to keep its quarterbacks
healthy with former USC
quarterback Matt Barkley
stepping in for second-string
quarterback Nick Foles who
left the game with a suspect
ed head injury. Barkley
threw three interceptions in
the game.
