## OP-ED An Economic Growth Agenda for the Middle Class 
### 
The central challenge for Amer
ica in the 21st century is eco
nomic. To lead the world, we
must ensure that we remain the en
gine of economic growth and innova
tion. We also must confront growing
economic inequality and figure out
how to prevent the further erosion of
the middle class.
Unfortunately, Congress lacks a
coherent vision for our economy.
Everyone knows that Congress has
failed at its most basic task of passing
a budget on time. But even more
problematically, our elected repre
sentatives have completely neglected
to prepare America to compete in a
global economy.
We need a new economic platform
that gets past the stale rhetoric of ex
treme ideology. Instead of dema
goguery against "Benedict Arnold"
entrepreneurs and business leaders,
we must think about what policies
will actually create a favorable envi
ronment for companies to invest in
and stay in the United States.
At the same time, we must priori
tize basic government investments in
public goods such as education pri
mary schools, vocational programs
and colleges and universities to
provide all Americans with equal op
portunities. In other words, we need
an economic growth agenda for the
middle class.
There are six prongs to such a
plan that should attract bipartisan
support, starting with tax reform.
We have a tax code written in the
1960s that actually incentivizes com
panies to park money overseas and is
filled with inefficient loopholes and
deductions that put small businesses
at a disadvantage. Congress needs to
rewrite the rules to incentivize com
panies to make investments in the
United States. In short, we need a
simpler, fairer, and more competitive
tax code that phases out incentives
that impede our progress like fossil
fuel subsidies and unnecessary sup
port to mature industries.
We absolutely must simplify the
bureaucracy. Many small businesses
and companies face yearlong delays
in permitting and have to deal with
scores of different agencies on com
pliance issues. We need to use tech
nology to streamline the paperwork
burden and create a one-stop online
shop that is responsive to the needs
of business owners.
A distinct part of the growth
agenda is radically rethinking educa
tion. Attending a public university
should be affordable for every Amer
ican. We need to make investments in
our public colleges and universities so
they are not forced to make up for
budget shortfalls by raising tuition
for middle-class students.
We also need greater investment
in primary education, particularly for
improving the pay and professional
training of our teachers. The 21st
century requires us to make bold
changes to prepare students for the
jobs of the fiiture including broad
band access in every classroom, de
mocratizing education through mas
sive open online courses (MOOCs)
and adding computer coding to the
curriculum.
Finally, we should support voca
tional programs in computer pro
gramming, CNC machines, robotics
and 3-D printing that lead to good
paying jobs that are in high demand.
Supporting science and technolo
gy is a critical part of the growth
agenda. Silicon Valley has flourished
because the federal government
made basic investments in disruptive
technologies in the 1960s and 19705.
When we cut our funding to the Na
tional Institute of Health, or the Na

tional Science Foundation or the Ad
vanced Research Projects Agency-
Energy, we are literally shortchang
ing future generations.
Congress's cuts to science and
technology research rank among the
worst economic policy decisions in
our country's history. We can't simply
plan for the next year or five years
we need to make critical investments
to maintain our position as a global
leader in innovation for the next cen
tury.
We need to welcome immigrants,
the hard-working individuals from
around the world who set up busi
nesses here, work here and create
jobs here. Studies overwhelmingly
show that immigration fuels econom
ic growth and leads to more jobs for
Americans. We need to expedite the
path to green cards and citizenship
for folks making meaningful contri
butions to our economy, in both the
skilled and unskilled sectors. We also
need an expansion for startup visas to
incentivize immigrants to start busi
nesses here.
The final prong is the creation of
an adequate safety net. Our economy
cannot grow if we continue to have
policies that undermine the middle
class. In the last 20 years household
debt has increased and middle class
wages have stagnated.
We need to provide programs for
early education and childcare, protect
Social Security, raise the minimum
wage, and provide benefits for work
ers who are dislocated or in need of
training. Otherwise, we risk return
ing to the gilded age of the 1920s
when concentrated wealth impeded
our economic progress.
From the time of Alexander
Hamilton, Americans have been
pragmatists when it comes to eco
nomic policy. We have avoided both
free-market absolutism and the im
pediments of excessive government
intervention.
Yet, our current Congress has
strayed from this pragmatic tradition
at a time when we most need it. It's
time to get back to the fundamental
economic principles that made us a
great economy with a thriving middle
class.

Yet, our current Congress has
strayed from this pragmatic tradition
at a time when we most need it. It's
time to get back to the fundamental
economic principles that made us a
great economy with a thriving middle
class.

The central challenge for Amer
ica in the 21st century is eco
nomic. To lead the world, we
must ensure that we remain the en
gine of economic growth and innova
tion. We also must confront growing
economic inequality and figure out
how to prevent the further erosion of
the middle class.
Unfortunately, Congress lacks a
coherent vision for our economy.
Everyone knows that Congress has
failed at its most basic task of passing
a budget on time. But even more
problematically, our elected repre
sentatives have completely neglected
to prepare America to compete in a
global economy.
We need a new economic platform
that gets past the stale rhetoric of ex
treme ideology. Instead of dema
goguery against "Benedict Arnold"
entrepreneurs and business leaders,
we must think about what policies
will actually create a favorable envi
ronment for companies to invest in
and stay in the United States.
At the same time, we must priori
tize basic government investments in
public goods such as education pri
mary schools, vocational programs
and colleges and universities to
provide all Americans with equal op
portunities. In other words, we need
an economic growth agenda for the
middle class.
There are six prongs to such a
plan that should attract bipartisan
support, starting with tax reform.
We have a tax code written in the
1960s that actually incentivizes com
panies to park money overseas and is
filled with inefficient loopholes and
deductions that put small businesses
at a disadvantage. Congress needs to
rewrite the rules to incentivize com
panies to make investments in the
United States. In short, we need a
simpler, fairer, and more competitive
tax code that phases out incentives
that impede our progress like fossil
fuel subsidies and unnecessary sup
port to mature industries.
We absolutely must simplify the
bureaucracy. Many small businesses
and companies face yearlong delays
in permitting and have to deal with
scores of different agencies on com
pliance issues. We need to use tech
nology to streamline the paperwork
burden and create a one-stop online
shop that is responsive to the needs
of business owners.
A distinct part of the growth
agenda is radically rethinking educa
tion. Attending a public university
should be affordable for every Amer
ican. We need to make investments in
our public colleges and universities so
they are not forced to make up for
budget shortfalls by raising tuition
for middle-class students.
We also need greater investment
in primary education, particularly for
improving the pay and professional
training of our teachers. The 21st
century requires us to make bold
changes to prepare students for the
jobs of the fiiture including broad
band access in every classroom, de
mocratizing education through mas
sive open online courses (MOOCs)
and adding computer coding to the
curriculum.
Finally, we should support voca
tional programs in computer pro
gramming, CNC machines, robotics
and 3-D printing that lead to good
paying jobs that are in high demand.
Supporting science and technolo
gy is a critical part of the growth
agenda. Silicon Valley has flourished
because the federal government
made basic investments in disruptive
technologies in the 1960s and 19705.
When we cut our funding to the Na
tional Institute of Health, or the Na

tional Science Foundation or the Ad
vanced Research Projects Agency-
Energy, we are literally shortchang
ing future generations.
Congress's cuts to science and
technology research rank among the
worst economic policy decisions in
our country's history. We can't simply
plan for the next year or five years
we need to make critical investments
to maintain our position as a global
leader in innovation for the next cen
tury.
We need to welcome immigrants,
the hard-working individuals from
around the world who set up busi
nesses here, work here and create
jobs here. Studies overwhelmingly
show that immigration fuels econom
ic growth and leads to more jobs for
Americans. We need to expedite the
path to green cards and citizenship
for folks making meaningful contri
butions to our economy, in both the
skilled and unskilled sectors. We also
need an expansion for startup visas to
incentivize immigrants to start busi
nesses here.
The final prong is the creation of
an adequate safety net. Our economy
cannot grow if we continue to have
policies that undermine the middle
class. In the last 20 years household
debt has increased and middle class
wages have stagnated.
We need to provide programs for
early education and childcare, protect
Social Security, raise the minimum
wage, and provide benefits for work
ers who are dislocated or in need of
training. Otherwise, we risk return
ing to the gilded age of the 1920s
when concentrated wealth impeded
our economic progress.
From the time of Alexander
Hamilton, Americans have been
pragmatists when it comes to eco
nomic policy. We have avoided both
free-market absolutism and the im
pediments of excessive government
intervention.
