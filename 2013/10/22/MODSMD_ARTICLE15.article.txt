# Full Mooning
## 
### McKenzie Andrews 
As a high schooler who had on
ly kissed boys while sober, I
first heard about Full Moon
on the Quad when I opened up to
the California section of Insider's
Guide to Colleges and flipped to
Stanford University. At America's
dream school, the smartest kids in a
faraway land wait until midnight
when the gifted princes kiss the
brilliant ladies. Because the admis
sions rate was low, everyone must
be perfect and talented. It is a tra
dition that began with senior colle
giate gentlemen bringing roses to
the freshman girls; FMOTQ was
fairytale that only could exist far
away in an unimaginable place.
Fast-forward to freshman year:
I was living the dream. The excite
ment of fall quarter in a Wilbur
dorm is contagious. Making friends
on the scavenger hunt in San Fran
cisco; discovering that FloMo
serves Indian food every Sunday at
dinner; being awoken by the virtu
oso piano music from your dorm
mate in the lounge: Life was good.
Cedro stayed up into the wee
hours of the night talking about life,
eating Late Night, and finishing p
sets. We were sure that we had the
highest "work hard, play hard" ratio
of any freshman dorm on campus.
My RA had a list on her closet
door that described all the things
"To Do Before I Graduate," and
"get kissed at Full Moon on the
Quad" was there. Inspired, I knew

that that was something I wanted to
check off my list. Never before had
I been to an event where painted
nudity was an expectation.
Never before had I gotten drunk
on a Tuesday. Never before had I
had such an opportunity to shame
lessly make out with randos. At
FMOTQ, all of this changed.
They told us there'd be free
Chipotle, but there wasn't any left
by the time we got there. With a
pack of dormmates and SUID in
tow, I was ready to throw away my
Karel worries away and experience
college in California.
As they say in Designing Your
Stanford, YOSO: You only Stanford
once. I shuffled into the Quad and
stuck with the familiar faces from
my dorm. Not quite sure of the
names of all the people there, I
waited in anticipation for the clock
to strike midnight.
Freshmen, when you head to the
Quad for your first time, be pre
pared. Use some mouthwash. Em
brace that kissing unknown suitors
is only awkward if you let it be.
Head there and back with people
you know. 5-SURE exists, so our
students can golf-cart home rather
than walk. The Sophomore Class of
past and present does not admit vis
ibly intoxicated students to Quad
(keyword: visibly).
At 12, it began. It was kind of
like a frat party, but outside, with
more kissing and less grinding.

About one-third of the people were
shy and maybe spectating, one
third were there to party and get a
couple friendly kisses, and one
third were rampantly trying to
make out with as many people as
possible.
Surprisingly, people mostly main
tained a casualness and respect for
those around them: Remember to
stay classy. Though the kissing got
shut down in less than 20 minutes,
the madness was everywhere, and I
managed to peck the Tree as well as
few other gentlemen.
Back at the dorm, I was sur
prised to realize that others had a
number for the night. (Pro tip: Keep
count.) One friend admitted he'd
just had his first kiss with a girl
whose name he didn't know.
Another girl managed to kiss a
boy from home she'd known in high
school. I'd just kissed my first (and
possibly into the double digits)
Stanford boys. Everyone saw the
painted, swinging bodies.
FMOTQ could only exist on the
West Coast academic Disneyland
that is our school. I love that at
America's No. 1 dream school, it's
school tradition to have a massive
make out orgy that increases the
number of connections between the
newest class of Stanford students
and those of us who have been here
a bit longer, a chance to be more
open with those with whom we work
and play.
FMOTQ is an intoxicating expe
rience enjoyed by budding adventur
ists and those looking to have a good
time alike. Freshmen and upper
classmen should go, experience the
craziness, then head home. For the
brief time it lasts, in the Quad there
is an undeniably palpable and unique
energy; equal parts trepidation, ir
reverence, hope, and curiosity.

Freshmen,
when you head
to the Quad for
the first time, be
prepared.
