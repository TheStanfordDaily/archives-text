# BOGEY PROBLEMS COST CARD
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
After a resounding win at the Erin
Hills Invitational two weeks ago, the
Stanford men's golf team fell back to
earth over the weekend at the U.S. Col
legiate Championships. Head coach
Conrad Ray's five-man squad finished
tied for seventh at the event, played at
the Golf Club of Georgia and hosted by
Georgia Tech. Individually, junior
Patrick Rodgers and senior Cameron
Wilson tied for 15th with a cumulative 2-
under 214 score on the par-72, 7,017-
yard Lakeside Course.
"We were a little disappointed with
our finish today but just a few shots sep
arated third place and where we fin
ished in seventh," Ray said. "We had a
little bit of a soft finish on the last few
holes with a couple of bogeys and double
bogeys, but I felt overall the guys com
peted hard and played their best this
weekend."
Indeed, going into the tournament
Ray emphasized that "avoiding three
putts and hitting the ball in the fairway"
would be crucial to success. Unfortu
nately for the Card, it simply recorded
too many high numbers to get into con
tention, shooting nine double bogeys or
worse as a team over the length of the
event. The lineup which has a di
verse mix of youth and experience
struggled to generate any kind of signif
icant momentum, with scorecards
marked by strings of alternating birdies
and bogeys.

The tough playing conditions, espe
cially the Bermuda rough and speedy
greens, came into play most notably for
the junior standout Rodgers at the end
of Saturday's second round. The de
fending champion at the event, Rodgers
went into the par-5, 564-yard 18th hole
at 2-under with four birdies to two bo
geys. An errant tee shot left him with a
tough lie and his subsequent chip landed
where no golfer ever wants to be: in the
water. He would go on to double-bogey
the hole, dropping his score to an even
par 72 on the day.
But Rodgers one of the best ama
teur golfers in the country quickly
shook off the late-round flop and had a
spectacular Sunday, scorching the
course with a 5-under 67 to move into
the top 20 and a tie with teammate
Cameron Wilson. Even with the second
lowest round of the tournament, he was
still eight strokes behind individual win
ner Ollie Schniederjans of Georgia Tech.
"It was a good showing by Cameron
Wilson and Patrick Rodgers, tying for
15th in a very strong field," Ray said,
"and it was neat to see Patrick come
back after a couple tough, tough days of
play."
Sophomore David Boote was not far
behind, finishing tied for 29th with a 1-
over 217. The Englishman has seeming
ly entrenched himself in Ray's lineup
along with freshmen Jim Liu and Mav
erick McNealy. Ray has stuck with the
newcomers over veterans Shane Lebow,
a senior, and Patrick Grimes, a junior,
for the last two events, and both fresh

men have showed signs of promise. Af
ter a tough first round in Georgia, Liu
rebounded nicely with a 1-under 71 on
Saturday, one of only five rounds under
par for the team at the event. McNealy,
though carding several double bogeys,
was nonetheless consistent in his scor
ing with rounds of 75, 74 and 76.
"I've played a lot of these courses,
played poorly, played well, been injured;
I'm aware of what most of the guys are
going through and able to help them
navigate a lot of the situations that
arise," commented Wilson on how he's
been helping the freshmen. "That could
be course strategy, something in then
technique, or even how to schedule
classes."
As for the team competition in Al
pharetta, No. 6 Oklahoma State and
host No. 2 Georgia Tech ran away from
the competition, with the Cowboys ulti
mately eking out a one-stroke victory.
There was a considerable gap to the rest
of the field, where things started to
bunch up only five strokes separated
third-place Wake Forest from Stanford,
which tied for seventh with lowa. The
Cardinal was only two shots behind con
ference foe No. 7 UCLA, and defeated
No. 4 Washington and No. 23 USC by
eight and three strokes, respectively.
Stanford wraps up its fall schedule at
the Royal Oaks Intercollegiate hosted
by Baylor, beginning next Monday in
Dallas.

"It was a good showing by Cameron
Wilson and Patrick Rodgers, tying for
15th in a very strong field," Ray said,
"and it was neat to see Patrick come
back after a couple tough, tough days of
play."
Sophomore David Boote was not far
behind, finishing tied for 29th with a 1-
over 217. The Englishman has seeming
ly entrenched himself in Ray's lineup
along with freshmen Jim Liu and Mav
erick McNealy. Ray has stuck with the
newcomers over veterans Shane Lebow,
a senior, and Patrick Grimes, a junior,
for the last two events, and both fresh

men have showed signs of promise. Af
ter a tough first round in Georgia, Liu
rebounded nicely with a 1-under 71 on
Saturday, one of only five rounds under
par for the team at the event. McNealy,
though carding several double bogeys,
was nonetheless consistent in his scor
ing with rounds of 75, 74 and 76.
"I've played a lot of these courses,
played poorly, played well, been injured;
I'm aware of what most of the guys are
going through and able to help them
navigate a lot of the situations that
arise," commented Wilson on how he's
been helping the freshmen. "That could
be course strategy, something in then
technique, or even how to schedule
classes."
As for the team competition in Al
pharetta, No. 6 Oklahoma State and
host No. 2 Georgia Tech ran away from
the competition, with the Cowboys ulti
mately eking out a one-stroke victory.
There was a considerable gap to the rest
of the field, where things started to
bunch up only five strokes separated
third-place Wake Forest from Stanford,
which tied for seventh with lowa. The
Cardinal was only two shots behind con
ference foe No. 7 UCLA, and defeated
No. 4 Washington and No. 23 USC by
eight and three strokes, respectively.
Stanford wraps up its fall schedule at
the Royal Oaks Intercollegiate hosted
by Baylor, beginning next Monday in
Dallas.

Senior Cameron Wilson (above) led the Cardinal with a 2-under 214 for the tournament. His impressive play was not
enough, however, as the Card, hurt by bogeys, finished seventh only two weeks after winning the Erin Hills Invitational.
After a resounding win at the Erin
Hills Invitational two weeks ago, the
Stanford men's golf team fell back to
earth over the weekend at the U.S. Col
legiate Championships. Head coach
Conrad Ray's five-man squad finished
tied for seventh at the event, played at
the Golf Club of Georgia and hosted by
Georgia Tech. Individually, junior
Patrick Rodgers and senior Cameron
Wilson tied for 15th with a cumulative 2-
under 214 score on the par-72, 7,017-
yard Lakeside Course.
"We were a little disappointed with
our finish today but just a few shots sep
arated third place and where we fin
ished in seventh," Ray said. "We had a
little bit of a soft finish on the last few
holes with a couple of bogeys and double
bogeys, but I felt overall the guys com
peted hard and played their best this
weekend."
Indeed, going into the tournament
Ray emphasized that "avoiding three
putts and hitting the ball in the fairway"
would be crucial to success. Unfortu
nately for the Card, it simply recorded
too many high numbers to get into con
tention, shooting nine double bogeys or
worse as a team over the length of the
event. The lineup which has a di
verse mix of youth and experience
struggled to generate any kind of signif
icant momentum, with scorecards
marked by strings of alternating birdies
and bogeys.

The tough playing conditions, espe
cially the Bermuda rough and speedy
greens, came into play most notably for
the junior standout Rodgers at the end
of Saturday's second round. The de
fending champion at the event, Rodgers
went into the par-5, 564-yard 18th hole
at 2-under with four birdies to two bo
geys. An errant tee shot left him with a
tough lie and his subsequent chip landed
where no golfer ever wants to be: in the
water. He would go on to double-bogey
the hole, dropping his score to an even
par 72 on the day.
But Rodgers one of the best ama
teur golfers in the country quickly
shook off the late-round flop and had a
spectacular Sunday, scorching the
course with a 5-under 67 to move into
the top 20 and a tie with teammate
Cameron Wilson. Even with the second
lowest round of the tournament, he was
still eight strokes behind individual win
ner Ollie Schniederjans of Georgia Tech.
