## FMOTQ '13 brings new surprises 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The 2013 edition of
Stanford's classic
Full Moon on the
Quad (FMOTQ)
will take place

tonight on the
Main Quad with new addi
tions including food trucks and
a photo booth projecting pic
tures on a giant screen.
The event, which began in the
1800s as a chaste tradition during
which senior men and freshmen
women would exchange roses and
kisses, has developed into a multifaceted
dance party complete with student musical
performances, Peer Health Educators
(PHEs) handing out mouthwash and a raucous
environment with students wearing ridiculous
outfits or nothing at all.

The Sophomore Class presidents are re
sponsible for organizing FMOTQ and this
year's presidents, Amanda Brockbank 'l6,
Stephen 'Mac' Goodspeed 'l6, Brandon Hill 'l6
and Tara McCullough 'l6, started planning al
most immediately after their election.
"[FMOTQ] is something that's quintessen
tially Stanford it's wacky, it's off-the-wall, al
most illegal type of event that brings everybody
together from all different backgrounds," Hill
said. "Now, it's going to be fun perpetuating the
tradition and improving upon it."
The co-presidents said that even though
they were all experienced in planning events as
part of last year's Frosh Council, the planning
for FMOTQ was far more extensive. In the
spring, they started brainstorming big picture
ideas and then began filling in the details when
they arrived back on campus in the fall.
"We have to turn off the sprinklers for the
night, we have to make sure certain bathrooms
are open and random little things that you
would never expect," Brockbank said. "There's
that logistical aspect of it, and then there're the
other aspects of making sure it's a safe event
and making sure your messaging is on time and
all that."
This year's slate credited last year's Sopho
more Class presidents for their help with the

planning, but they also decided to make some
changes to the event. Last year, FMOTQ was
preceded by musical performances and free
Chipotle at Old Union. This year, the organiz
ers decided to keep the event centered around
the Main Quad, where student groups will be
performing from 10:30 p.m. onward. At 11:30
p.m., DJ Lumo will take the stage for the rest
of the night.
At 10 p.m. three food trucks will be set up
outside Main Quad. At least the first 1,000 stu
dents to arrive will be able to get free food from
the Oaxacan Kitchen Mobile, Curry Up Now
and Kara's Cupcakes trucks.
"We settled on food tracks because they're fun,

they're a good way to get
L food in people and in
I combination with the
I student performances,
it's just a fun way to
give another aspect to
I it," Brockbank said.
This year's event
I will also feature a pho
' to booth and a large
screen where the im
ages will be projected,
which Hill said would add
mother fun element to the

another tun element to the
event.
"Of course you get the
printout, but also being able to
see yourself on a huge screen, we
thought that was pretty cool too,"
Hill said. "We want people to be able to
remember their night and be able to take
nome souvenirs from what's supposed to be a
jmeless memory."

Many of the new features are intended to al
low all students to feel safe and comfortable.
Last year, four students were transported fol
lowing the event a drop from the seven trans
ported the year before.
According to Ralph Castro, the director of
the Office of Alcohol Policy & Education
(OAPE), the office has been working with resi
dent assistants to make sure students know how
to be safe at FMOTQ. Because all four trans
ports last year were of upperclassmen, OAPE is
particularly reaching out to upperclassmen, es
pecially those on the Row, in addition to their
usual messaging to freshmen.
"There's always concerns for health, but the
PHE tables will do a good job and we've tried
to reach out to all the freshmen to make sure
they know health concerns," Goodspeed said.
The co-presidents said they are excited to
see their planning efforts come to fruition.
"It's really an extended process and it can be
kind of grating at times, but to see the final
product will be really rewarding," Goodspeed
said. "I'm sure we'll have our moment during
the final countdown where the four of us will be
there and we'll just be like, 'This is it, this is
great.'"

"Of course you get the
printout, but also being able to
see yourself on a huge screen, we
thought that was pretty cool too,"
Hill said. "We want people to be able to
remember their night and be able to take
nome souvenirs from what's supposed to be a
jmeless memory."

Many of the new features are intended to al
low all students to feel safe and comfortable.
Last year, four students were transported fol
lowing the event a drop from the seven trans
ported the year before.
According to Ralph Castro, the director of
the Office of Alcohol Policy & Education
(OAPE), the office has been working with resi
dent assistants to make sure students know how
to be safe at FMOTQ. Because all four trans
ports last year were of upperclassmen, OAPE is
particularly reaching out to upperclassmen, es
pecially those on the Row, in addition to their
usual messaging to freshmen.
"There's always concerns for health, but the
PHE tables will do a good job and we've tried
to reach out to all the freshmen to make sure
they know health concerns," Goodspeed said.
The co-presidents said they are excited to
see their planning efforts come to fruition.
"It's really an extended process and it can be
kind of grating at times, but to see the final
product will be really rewarding," Goodspeed
said. "I'm sure we'll have our moment during
the final countdown where the four of us will be
there and we'll just be like, 'This is it, this is
great.'"

The 2013 edition of
Stanford's classic
Full Moon on the
Quad (FMOTQ)
will take place

tonight on the
Main Quad with new addi
tions including food trucks and
a photo booth projecting pic
tures on a giant screen.
The event, which began in the
1800s as a chaste tradition during
which senior men and freshmen
women would exchange roses and
kisses, has developed into a multifaceted
dance party complete with student musical
performances, Peer Health Educators
(PHEs) handing out mouthwash and a raucous
environment with students wearing ridiculous
outfits or nothing at all.

The Sophomore Class presidents are re
sponsible for organizing FMOTQ and this
year's presidents, Amanda Brockbank 'l6,
Stephen 'Mac' Goodspeed 'l6, Brandon Hill 'l6
and Tara McCullough 'l6, started planning al
most immediately after their election.
"[FMOTQ] is something that's quintessen
tially Stanford it's wacky, it's off-the-wall, al
most illegal type of event that brings everybody
together from all different backgrounds," Hill
said. "Now, it's going to be fun perpetuating the
tradition and improving upon it."
The co-presidents said that even though
they were all experienced in planning events as
part of last year's Frosh Council, the planning
for FMOTQ was far more extensive. In the
spring, they started brainstorming big picture
ideas and then began filling in the details when
they arrived back on campus in the fall.
"We have to turn off the sprinklers for the
night, we have to make sure certain bathrooms
are open and random little things that you
would never expect," Brockbank said. "There's
that logistical aspect of it, and then there're the
other aspects of making sure it's a safe event
and making sure your messaging is on time and
all that."
This year's slate credited last year's Sopho
more Class presidents for their help with the

planning, but they also decided to make some
changes to the event. Last year, FMOTQ was
preceded by musical performances and free
Chipotle at Old Union. This year, the organiz
ers decided to keep the event centered around
the Main Quad, where student groups will be
performing from 10:30 p.m. onward. At 11:30
p.m., DJ Lumo will take the stage for the rest
of the night.
At 10 p.m. three food trucks will be set up
outside Main Quad. At least the first 1,000 stu
dents to arrive will be able to get free food from
the Oaxacan Kitchen Mobile, Curry Up Now
and Kara's Cupcakes trucks.
"We settled on food tracks because they're fun,

they're a good way to get
L food in people and in
I combination with the
I student performances,
it's just a fun way to
give another aspect to
I it," Brockbank said.
This year's event
I will also feature a pho
' to booth and a large
screen where the im
ages will be projected,
which Hill said would add
mother fun element to the

another tun element to the
event.
