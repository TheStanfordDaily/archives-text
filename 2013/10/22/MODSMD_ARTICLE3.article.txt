Freshman Outlooks
Farkasi Kathawala
"I think it's going to be fun. I'm excited to see people, like
what they wear. I hope people are going to be a lot more re
vealing than they are supposed to be in normal days."
Andrew Lovett
"It's supposed to be a big party thing, but I don't expect to
have anything out of control."
Nikarikoy Bedekar
"I have absolutely no idea [what to expect] actually be
cause a lot of my upperclassman friends haven't told me
anything because they want me to be surprised when I get

there. So I have no clue."
Ates Akjutc
"I'm hoping to kiss a very beautiful girl, and that's the idea
for Full Moon on the Quad."
Senior Reflections
KupvHuynU
"Not everyone should be naked."
Fabiajiy Bock
"I'm really excited about the food trucks from 10 to 11 p.m.
on Serra Street. I always get hungry around that time so
that'll definitely be the highlight of my night."

Tint Truotuj *
"I'm not sure what I am to expect from Full Moon on the
Quad other than the same usual things... herds of scared,
nervous, wide-eyed freshmen... seniors and upperdassmen
walking around like they own the place cause it's not our first
time. I always find it slightly underwhelming, but when
you're a senior these events become more of a nostalgic op
portunity than anything else."
Jemty Baruv
"I didn't even go to last year's Full Moon on the Quad. But
since this is my senior year, I'm actually sort of looking for
ward to observing tbe tradition one last time. I guess I'm
feeling weirdly sentimental."
