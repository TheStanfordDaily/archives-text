## BJA claims recanted by senator ASSU Senate to vote on bill overruling new bylaws today 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Benjamin Holston 'l5, chair of
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate,
backed away from his claims made
at last week's senate meeting that
the Board of Judicial Affairs (B JA)
had added eight new bylaws to the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997
over the summer without properly
soliciting student input.
The Undergraduate Senate
plans to take up a bill that would
overrule the adoption of the new
bylaws at tonight's senate meeting.
"They didn't technically break
any rules," Holston said, referring
to the board members who voted
last spring to adopt the new bylaws.
However, some students and
ASSU officials argue the incident
still highlights a lack of accountabil
ity and transparency in the Univer
sity's judicial affairs process.
The BJA is a 15-member com
mittee composed of Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff. It has the
power to adopt or modify bylaws
that specify policies or procedures
pertaining to the University's judi
cial affairs process.
The Office of Community Stan
dards (OCS) is then responsible
for carrying out these policies and
procedures.
At the board's May 21 and June
4 meetings, members voted to
adopt the first new bylaws in more
than eight years, according to
Jonathan York 'l3, student co-chair
at the time. The new bylaws altered
the language concerning the charg
ing standard, pre-hearing eviden
tiary consideration and raising evi
dentiary concerns during a hearing.
"We wanted to take what was
the practice of the office, and just
put it in black-and-white and into

the text of document," York said.
In accordance with its govern
ing document the Student Judi
cial Charter of 1997 the board,
through Koren Bakkegard, associ
ate dean and director of the OSC,
sent an email to six individuals no
tifying them of the approved
changes. The message was sent on
June 11 to the University Presi
dent, the Faculty Senate Chair, the
ASSU President, the Undergradu
ate Senate Chair and the two
Graduate Student Council Co-
Chairs.
The email stated: "Please find
attached a memo and related docu
ments that I am sending you on be
half of Michele Dauber and
Jonathan York, the faculty and stu
dent Co-Chairs of the Board on Ju
dicial Affairs."
Two of the attachments were
named "BJA Memo Re Proposed
Bylaws" and "Proposed Honor
Code Interpretations."
Holston and ASSU President

Billy Gallagher 'l4 both admitted
they initially did not have much
time to analyze the attachments
given that it was finals week. This
led Holston to misinterpret the
purpose of the email.
"The Senate was out of session,
and it was during finals week I
had my last final the next day,"
Holston said. "I thought it was just
a proposal, and that we would hear
about it later, whatever it would
turn into."
The second paragraph of the
first attachment stated that the by
laws were adopted.
On Sept. 25, Bakkagard sent
another email reiterating the adop
tion of the bylaws. She added that,
according to the Student Judicial
Charter of 1997, the Undergradu
ate Senate and the GSC had the
power to overrule the bylaws at
any time.
"Honestly, she probably didn't
have to [send the second email] be
cause she had already sent the one

on June 11," Holston said.
According to Holston, it was
Paul Harold J.D. 'l4, parliamentar
ian of GSC, who was confused with
this process and decided to draft a
bill to overrule the changes.
The incident gained greater
significance this past week when
Reid Spitz 'l4 and San Diego
based attorney Bob Ottilie '77 re
leased a packet of 23 testimonials
from students, their parents and
their legal counsel, about their ex
perience with OCS. The testimoni
als claim that the University's judi
cial process remains implicitly
slanted toward finding respon
dents guilty, despite claims from
OCS that these issues have been
resolved following an Internal Re
view Panel that began in the fall
2010.
Spitz and Ottilie advocated for
an overrule of these bylaw
changes, with the former writing
in an Oct. 15 email to ASSU offi
cials: "Our position, for now, is that

the senate overrule the amend
ments until such a time when the
community can have an informed
debate on the matter."
They argued the changes were
made behind "closed doors without
any input from the community,"
and said the Board of Judicial Af
fairs should strive for more trans
parency and student involvement.
In particular, Ottilie said Uni
versity officials have not respond
ed to his repeated requests for in
formation about the times and lo
cations of the board meetings.
Current BJA co-chair Miles
Seiver 'l4, who met with the parlia
mentarians from the Undergradu
ate Senate and GSC this week, said
he supports the legislative bodies
using their veto power, but hopes
the officials "would consider each
of bylaws on its merits before exer
cising their veto."

Benjamin Holston 'l5, chair of
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate,
backed away from his claims made
at last week's senate meeting that
the Board of Judicial Affairs (B JA)
had added eight new bylaws to the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997
over the summer without properly
soliciting student input.
The Undergraduate Senate
plans to take up a bill that would
overrule the adoption of the new
bylaws at tonight's senate meeting.
"They didn't technically break
any rules," Holston said, referring
to the board members who voted
last spring to adopt the new bylaws.
However, some students and
ASSU officials argue the incident
still highlights a lack of accountabil
ity and transparency in the Univer
sity's judicial affairs process.
The BJA is a 15-member com
mittee composed of Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff. It has the
power to adopt or modify bylaws
that specify policies or procedures
pertaining to the University's judi
cial affairs process.
The Office of Community Stan
dards (OCS) is then responsible
for carrying out these policies and
procedures.
At the board's May 21 and June
4 meetings, members voted to
adopt the first new bylaws in more
than eight years, according to
Jonathan York 'l3, student co-chair
at the time. The new bylaws altered
the language concerning the charg
ing standard, pre-hearing eviden
tiary consideration and raising evi
dentiary concerns during a hearing.
"We wanted to take what was
the practice of the office, and just
put it in black-and-white and into

the text of document," York said.
In accordance with its govern
ing document the Student Judi
cial Charter of 1997 the board,
through Koren Bakkegard, associ
ate dean and director of the OSC,
sent an email to six individuals no
tifying them of the approved
changes. The message was sent on
June 11 to the University Presi
dent, the Faculty Senate Chair, the
ASSU President, the Undergradu
ate Senate Chair and the two
Graduate Student Council Co-
Chairs.
The email stated: "Please find
attached a memo and related docu
ments that I am sending you on be
half of Michele Dauber and
Jonathan York, the faculty and stu
dent Co-Chairs of the Board on Ju
dicial Affairs."
Two of the attachments were
named "BJA Memo Re Proposed
Bylaws" and "Proposed Honor
Code Interpretations."
Holston and ASSU President

Billy Gallagher 'l4 both admitted
they initially did not have much
time to analyze the attachments
given that it was finals week. This
led Holston to misinterpret the
purpose of the email.
"The Senate was out of session,
and it was during finals week I
had my last final the next day,"
Holston said. "I thought it was just
a proposal, and that we would hear
about it later, whatever it would
turn into."
The second paragraph of the
first attachment stated that the by
laws were adopted.
On Sept. 25, Bakkagard sent
another email reiterating the adop
tion of the bylaws. She added that,
according to the Student Judicial
Charter of 1997, the Undergradu
ate Senate and the GSC had the
power to overrule the bylaws at
any time.
"Honestly, she probably didn't
have to [send the second email] be
cause she had already sent the one

on June 11," Holston said.
According to Holston, it was
Paul Harold J.D. 'l4, parliamentar
ian of GSC, who was confused with
this process and decided to draft a
bill to overrule the changes.
The incident gained greater
significance this past week when
Reid Spitz 'l4 and San Diego
based attorney Bob Ottilie '77 re
leased a packet of 23 testimonials
from students, their parents and
their legal counsel, about their ex
perience with OCS. The testimoni
als claim that the University's judi
cial process remains implicitly
slanted toward finding respon
dents guilty, despite claims from
OCS that these issues have been
resolved following an Internal Re
view Panel that began in the fall
2010.
Spitz and Ottilie advocated for
an overrule of these bylaw
changes, with the former writing
in an Oct. 15 email to ASSU offi
cials: "Our position, for now, is that

the senate overrule the amend
ments until such a time when the
community can have an informed
debate on the matter."
They argued the changes were
made behind "closed doors without
any input from the community,"
and said the Board of Judicial Af
fairs should strive for more trans
parency and student involvement.
In particular, Ottilie said Uni
versity officials have not respond
ed to his repeated requests for in
formation about the times and lo
cations of the board meetings.
Current BJA co-chair Miles
Seiver 'l4, who met with the parlia
mentarians from the Undergradu
ate Senate and GSC this week, said
he supports the legislative bodies
using their veto power, but hopes
the officials "would consider each
of bylaws on its merits before exer
cising their veto."
