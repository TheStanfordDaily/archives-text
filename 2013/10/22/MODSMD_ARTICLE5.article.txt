## CPI launches undergrad certificate 
### DANIA MARINSHAW 
The Stanford Center for Poverty
and Inequality (CPI) launched a pro
gram this quarter that allows under
graduates to pursue a Certificate on
Poverty and Inequality and become
more involved in one of the center's
10 research groups.
The certificate program, which is
open to all undergraduates, requires
students to complete a series of
three courses including the core
class SOC140: Introduction to Social
Stratification —as well as a re
search project. The certificate does
not appeal 1 on an official University
transcript but still serves as formal
recognition of rigorous work.
"Part of the commitment to build
ing infrastructure for dealing with
poverty and inequality is, of course,
training the next generation of schol
ars and activists who are going to be
involved in that fight," said Charles
Varner, associate director of the CPI.
By participating in the certificate
program, students will be able to join
one of the center's research
clusters, giving them access
to more than 300 CPI affili
ates at Stanford and other
universities. The 10 research
groups within the CPI range
in theme from poverty meas
urement and trends to resi
dential segregation.
"The [certificate] program
will give students a better tool
for understanding how these
inequalities are developed
and how they are perpetuat
ed," said Beth Mattingly, a
staff assistant who helped de
velop the program.
Though only approved
earlier this fall, the certificate
program already has 75 stu
dents enrolled. To accommo

date each student's individual
interests, eligible electives
span many departments, al
lowing for an interdiscipli
nary approach to poverty and
inequality.
Varner hopes that even
students from non-social sci
ence backgrounds will find
their own place at the CPI.
"The general altruism
that drives someone to be a
doctor, for instance, may also
drive [him or her] to become
involved in this initiative," he
said.
According to David Grusky,
director of the CPI, in the past
the Stanford community
lacked a space for conversa
tion among students with
unique academic backgrounds
who shared a desire to attack
these critical social issues.
"Students who are inter
ested in issues of poverty and
inequality [had] to cobble to

gether a program on their
own," Grusky said. "By virtue
of having this program, we
can bring together students
and faculty with common in
terests so they can learn from
one another."
Tina Tran 'l4 is one such
student. Though Tran is ma
joring in Human Biology
(Humßio), she has been
working with the CPI for the
past two years and plans to
pursue the certificate in
poverty and inequality this
year.
"You can definitely do im
pactful research here," Tran
said.
Tran initially sought re
search opportunities at the
CPI to supplement her
Humßio concentration in
health policy, as well as her in
volvement with Night Out
reach, a student group devot
ed to helping the homeless in

the Bay Area.
"I'm widely interested in
disparities across different
sectors of society," she added.
If the certificate program
garners enough interest, the
CPI will also pursue develop
ment of a minor program and
an honors program that
would allow students to build
upon them research done for
the certificate.
"What we want is to give
people a menu of options as to
how deeply they want to
weave the study of poverty
and inequality into their
lives," Grusky said. "We're at
this extraordinary moment in
U.S. history in which inequal
ity is higher than it has ever
been before. Something is go
ing on that we need to under
stand."
