# Q&A
## JIM PLUMMER DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING 
### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
Jim Plummer M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7l,
dean of the School of Engineering,
recently announced that he would
step down from his position after a
15-year tenure.
Plummer has led the School of
Engineering since 1999, prior to
which he was the senior associate
dean and chair of the Department of
Electrical Engineering. Plummer's
time as dean saw rapid growth of
Stanford facilities and research, in
cluding the construction of the new

Sciences and Engineering Quad.
Plummer sat down with The Dai
ly to reflect on his time as dean and
talk about his plans for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):When
you first took the job of being the
dean, what was the first thing that
went through your mind? Looking
back on that, how has your view of
the school changed?
Jim Plummer (JP):l've been at
Stanford for a long time I was in
the dean's office, I was senior associ-


Courtesy of Jim Plummer
ate dean for a few years be
fore I was dean, so I had a
pretty good idea of what the
dean's office was all about. I
was also a professor and a de
partment chair.
Anyone who walks into
this position walks into a po
sition where the school is well
respected and well posi
tioned, and [it] recruits great
faculty and students. It's a
position where you're not ex
actly at the top of the moun
tain, but very close to the top
of the mountain. It's more of
an opportunity to see what
you can do to make it better
than what it already is.

TSD: During your time as
dean, when the engineering
quad was built, did you see a
change in the mindset of any
one in the School of Engi
neering, and in the type of
work that was going on?
JP: There's actually been a
goal for around 20 years in
the School of Engineering to
try and get all of our nine de
partments into 21st-century
facilities. This quad [the Sci
ence and Engineering Quad]
finishes something that has
been underway for more than
20 years. It positions our de
partments to do 21st-century
research and have some of
the best teaching facilities
around.

TSD: Do you think that the
new quad has affected the
vast increase in the number
of undergraduates pursuing
engineering?

JP: I think a number of fac
tors contributed to that, and
this is certainly one of them.
Another factor that con
tributed to that [increase in
the number of students] was
that we, along with the rest of
the University, have paid a lot
of attention to things like
freshman seminars and intro
ductory classes. We have also
paid a lot of attention to our
undergraduate majors.
Probably the best exam
ple of that is computer sci
ence (CS), which completely
redid its undergraduate cur
riculum four to five years ago.
That was the point at which
the number of undergraduate
majors took off in CS, and
now it is the largest under
graduate major on campus.
It's a combination of won
derful new facilities, and the
fact that a lot of young people
nowadays really want to have
careers that change the world
they want to work on ener
gy or environment or human
health problems, something
which is going to make a dif

ference in the world.
I think that increasingly
young people are connecting
the dots and seeing that in or
der to do that, having the
technical skills to be able to
contribute to those [solutions]
is a good idea. Engineering
provides those skills.

TSD: If you were an under
graduate today at Stanford
and were planning on pursu
ing engineering, what would
you do?
JP: I get asked that question
a lot. My usual first answer to
it, which is the most impor
tant thing by far, is to learn a
bit about different areas of
engineering and find out
what you are really excited
about.
You need to find some
thing that inspires you, which
you're passionate about, and
then pursue it. If you do that,
then you're probably going to
be wildly successful at it, and
it will position you to learn
the kinds of skills you will
need for a career going for
ward.
TSD: Do you have any advice
for the incoming dean?
JP: My advice, above all else,
would be to make sure that
you are well attuned to the
ideas that are building up
from our faculty and from
our students, because no in
dividual is as smart as the
collective intelligence of 250
faculty and several thousand
students.
The best ideas are going
to come from that group and
probably not from whoever
sits in this office. So, whoever
sits here can listen and learn,
and help pick out what seem
to be the best ideas and en
able them to happen.
TSD: What are your plans af
ter this?
JP: I am just beginning to
think about what I might do.
So, I see it as a time of renew
al, and with this job I haven't
been as active in research
over the last 14 going on 15
years than I was, so for sure,
I am going to dig back into
technical fields.

ing engineering, what would
you do?
JP: I get asked that question
a lot. My usual first answer to
it, which is the most impor
tant thing by far, is to learn a
bit about different areas of
engineering and find out
what you are really excited
about.
You need to find some
thing that inspires you, which
you're passionate about, and
then pursue it. If you do that,
then you're probably going to
be wildly successful at it, and
it will position you to learn
the kinds of skills you will
need for a career going for
ward.
TSD: Do you have any advice
for the incoming dean?
JP: My advice, above all else,
would be to make sure that
you are well attuned to the
ideas that are building up
from our faculty and from
our students, because no in
dividual is as smart as the
collective intelligence of 250
faculty and several thousand
students.
The best ideas are going
to come from that group and
probably not from whoever
sits in this office. So, whoever
sits here can listen and learn,
and help pick out what seem
to be the best ideas and en
able them to happen.
TSD: What are your plans af
ter this?
JP: I am just beginning to
think about what I might do.
So, I see it as a time of renew
al, and with this job I haven't
been as active in research
over the last 14 going on 15
years than I was, so for sure,
I am going to dig back into
technical fields.

Jim Plummer M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7l,
dean of the School of Engineering,
recently announced that he would
step down from his position after a
15-year tenure.
Plummer has led the School of
Engineering since 1999, prior to
which he was the senior associate
dean and chair of the Department of
Electrical Engineering. Plummer's
time as dean saw rapid growth of
Stanford facilities and research, in
cluding the construction of the new

Sciences and Engineering Quad.
Plummer sat down with The Dai
ly to reflect on his time as dean and
talk about his plans for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):When
you first took the job of being the
dean, what was the first thing that
went through your mind? Looking
back on that, how has your view of
the school changed?
Jim Plummer (JP):l've been at
Stanford for a long time I was in
the dean's office, I was senior associ-


Courtesy of Jim Plummer
ate dean for a few years be
fore I was dean, so I had a
pretty good idea of what the
dean's office was all about. I
was also a professor and a de
partment chair.
Anyone who walks into
this position walks into a po
sition where the school is well
respected and well posi
tioned, and [it] recruits great
faculty and students. It's a
position where you're not ex
actly at the top of the moun
tain, but very close to the top
of the mountain. It's more of
an opportunity to see what
you can do to make it better
than what it already is.

TSD: During your time as
dean, when the engineering
quad was built, did you see a
change in the mindset of any
one in the School of Engi
neering, and in the type of
work that was going on?
JP: There's actually been a
goal for around 20 years in
the School of Engineering to
try and get all of our nine de
partments into 21st-century
facilities. This quad [the Sci
ence and Engineering Quad]
finishes something that has
been underway for more than
20 years. It positions our de
partments to do 21st-century
research and have some of
the best teaching facilities
around.

TSD: Do you think that the
new quad has affected the
vast increase in the number
of undergraduates pursuing
engineering?

JP: I think a number of fac
tors contributed to that, and
this is certainly one of them.
Another factor that con
tributed to that [increase in
the number of students] was
that we, along with the rest of
the University, have paid a lot
of attention to things like
freshman seminars and intro
ductory classes. We have also
paid a lot of attention to our
undergraduate majors.
Probably the best exam
ple of that is computer sci
ence (CS), which completely
redid its undergraduate cur
riculum four to five years ago.
That was the point at which
the number of undergraduate
majors took off in CS, and
now it is the largest under
graduate major on campus.
It's a combination of won
derful new facilities, and the
fact that a lot of young people
nowadays really want to have
careers that change the world
they want to work on ener
gy or environment or human
health problems, something
which is going to make a dif

ference in the world.
I think that increasingly
young people are connecting
the dots and seeing that in or
der to do that, having the
technical skills to be able to
contribute to those [solutions]
is a good idea. Engineering
provides those skills.

you do?
