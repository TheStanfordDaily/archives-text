## Sophomores shine given opportunity

In addition to sophomore wide
receiver Kodi Whitfield's epic
one-handed catch in Saturday's
win against UCLA, there were
also two other catches on Col
lege Football's Top Plays made with
only one hand.
So I guess making a one-handed
catch these days isn't so rare, but
Whitfield definitely managed to do it
with style. Twisting his arm backward
while moving forward, and then hav
ing to pull the ball downward â€”be-
tween two defenders no less. Serious
ly? It was the work of an acrobatic ge
nius. He won ESPN's biggest Pac-12
play of the week for the catch, which
all analysts are saying should end up
being a top-10 play for the 2013 college
football season.

This is something that you see on
ESPN's best lists and think, "Wow I
wish that was my team that made the
unbelievable play" And for this week,
eveiyone else can be jealous of our
awesome team.
Oh, and guess what. That was
Whitfield's first career touchdown
catch. What away to enter the scor
ing books. Yes, it's amazing that he
caught the ball in such a crazy fash
ion, but like I said, two other players
one from Connecticut and another
from Tennessee managed a one
handed grab.
Other wide receivers, such as jun
iors Devon Cajuste and Ty Mont
gomery and sophomore Michael
Rector, have been stepping up this
season and have had their time (or
times) to shine. This was Whitfield's
time and he seized the opportunity
no matter how hard the catch was
to make. That was his touchdown and
he knew it. It makes me happy when
players rise to the occasion and make
the play happen and, as a former dor
mmate of Whitfield's, I'm extremely
proud of him.
But Whitfield wasn't the only soph
omore to make a difference Saturday
and have a career first; nor was he the
only player irom Loyola High School
in Los Angeles, Calif., to put some
points on the board.

For this week,
