## Sophomores shine given opportunity 
### Ashley Westhem 
In addition to sophomore wide
receiver Kodi Whitfield's epic
one-handed catch in Saturday's
win against UCLA, there were
also two other catches on Col
lege Football's Top Plays made with
only one hand.
So I guess making a one-handed
catch these days isn't so rare, but
Whitfield definitely managed to do it
with style. Twisting his arm backward
while moving forward, and then hav
ing to pull the ball downward —be-
tween two defenders no less. Serious
ly? It was the work of an acrobatic ge
nius. He won ESPN's biggest Pac-12
play of the week for the catch, which
all analysts are saying should end up
being a top-10 play for the 2013 college
football season.

This is something that you see on
ESPN's best lists and think, "Wow I
wish that was my team that made the
unbelievable play" And for this week,
eveiyone else can be jealous of our
awesome team.
Oh, and guess what. That was
Whitfield's first career touchdown
catch. What away to enter the scor
ing books. Yes, it's amazing that he
caught the ball in such a crazy fash
ion, but like I said, two other players
one from Connecticut and another
from Tennessee managed a one
handed grab.
Other wide receivers, such as jun
iors Devon Cajuste and Ty Mont
gomery and sophomore Michael
Rector, have been stepping up this
season and have had their time (or
times) to shine. This was Whitfield's
time and he seized the opportunity
no matter how hard the catch was
to make. That was his touchdown and
he knew it. It makes me happy when
players rise to the occasion and make
the play happen and, as a former dor
mmate of Whitfield's, I'm extremely
proud of him.
But Whitfield wasn't the only soph
omore to make a difference Saturday
and have a career first; nor was he the
only player irom Loyola High School
in Los Angeles, Calif., to put some
points on the board.

his first career start at Mcker
in the absence of senior Jordan
Williamson. Ukropina got his
first point as a Cardinal kicker
when he made the PAT in the
fourth quarter against Wash
ington State. He made his first
collegiate field goal against
UCLA though, from 31 yards
out before missing a long 46-
yard field goal to end the game.
The paii' of sophomore Los
Angeles natives accounted for
the first 10 points scored by the
Card and for half of all points
scored on Saturday. That's what
I call representing your school.
I saw Ukropina after the
game and he was literally glow
ing and beaming with excite
ment. It was surreal for him
that moment of running onto
the field and making a child
hood dream a reality
"It just happened. Good

snap, good hold and the kick
went through. Jogging off [the
field], it felt just like high school
again," Ukropina told me.

Those are the moments that
make the grueling practices
worthwhile. Those are the mo
ments that could propel them
fi'om young contributors to reg
ular players and carry them
throughout their time here at
Stanford. Every other touch
down, every other field goal will
be just as important to the pro
gram as a whole, but they will
never be as sweet for the play
ers individually as that first
catch in the end zone or the first
placement of the ball between
the goal posts. Those are the
moments that college football is
all about.

Ashley Westhem will never
forget her first clutch broad
casting performance. To ask

In addition to sophomore wide
receiver Kodi Whitfield's epic
one-handed catch in Saturday's
win against UCLA, there were
also two other catches on Col
lege Football's Top Plays made with
only one hand.
So I guess making a one-handed
catch these days isn't so rare, but
Whitfield definitely managed to do it
with style. Twisting his arm backward
while moving forward, and then hav
ing to pull the ball downward —be-
tween two defenders no less. Serious
ly? It was the work of an acrobatic ge
nius. He won ESPN's biggest Pac-12
play of the week for the catch, which
all analysts are saying should end up
being a top-10 play for the 2013 college
football season.

This is something that you see on
ESPN's best lists and think, "Wow I
wish that was my team that made the
unbelievable play" And for this week,
eveiyone else can be jealous of our
awesome team.
Oh, and guess what. That was
Whitfield's first career touchdown
catch. What away to enter the scor
ing books. Yes, it's amazing that he
caught the ball in such a crazy fash
ion, but like I said, two other players
one from Connecticut and another
from Tennessee managed a one
handed grab.
Other wide receivers, such as jun
iors Devon Cajuste and Ty Mont
gomery and sophomore Michael
Rector, have been stepping up this
season and have had their time (or
times) to shine. This was Whitfield's
time and he seized the opportunity
no matter how hard the catch was
to make. That was his touchdown and
he knew it. It makes me happy when
players rise to the occasion and make
the play happen and, as a former dor
mmate of Whitfield's, I'm extremely
proud of him.
But Whitfield wasn't the only soph
omore to make a difference Saturday
and have a career first; nor was he the
only player irom Loyola High School
in Los Angeles, Calif., to put some
points on the board.
Sophomore Conrad Ukropina had

his first career start at Mcker
in the absence of senior Jordan
Williamson. Ukropina got his
first point as a Cardinal kicker
when he made the PAT in the
fourth quarter against Wash
ington State. He made his first
collegiate field goal against
UCLA though, from 31 yards
out before missing a long 46-
yard field goal to end the game.
The paii' of sophomore Los
Angeles natives accounted for
the first 10 points scored by the
Card and for half of all points
scored on Saturday. That's what
I call representing your school.
I saw Ukropina after the
game and he was literally glow
ing and beaming with excite
ment. It was surreal for him
that moment of running onto
the field and making a child
hood dream a reality
"It just happened. Good

snap, good hold and the kick
went through. Jogging off [the
field], it felt just like high school
again," Ukropina told me.

Those are the moments that
make the grueling practices
worthwhile. Those are the mo
ments that could propel them
fi'om young contributors to reg
ular players and carry them
throughout their time here at
Stanford. Every other touch
down, every other field goal will
be just as important to the pro
gram as a whole, but they will
never be as sweet for the play
ers individually as that first
catch in the end zone or the first
placement of the ball between
the goal posts. Those are the
moments that college football is
all about.
