# POWELL READY FOR SEASON
## CARD PICKED TO FINISH SIXTH IN PAC-12 RACE 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford senior forward Dwight Powell and head
coach Johnny Dawkins were among the 12 player
coach tandems that descended on the Pac-12 Net
works studio last Thursday for the Pac-12 Men's Bas
ketball Media Day. The event was in anticipation of the
upcoming season, which officially tips off on Nov. 8.
The Media Day is typically an opportunity for
members of the press to ask a wide variety of ques
tions to the players and coaches, ranging from the po
litically comical to the competitively incendiary. On be
ing asked for his take on the end of the government
shutdown, Oregon State head coach Craig Robinson
brother of First Lady Michelle Obama replied,
"You see the stuff I have to put up with?"
His response elicited laughs from members of the
press, while new USC and former Florida Gulf Coast
head coach Andy Enfield was grilled on a comment he
made in practice last week about the "slow" UCLA
Bruins, his new crosstown rival.
"It will add more fire to the battle," said Trojan
guard J.T. Terrell, defending his new coach. "I'm hop
ing for a better game now."
Some of the notable faces at this year's event in
cluded coaching newcomers Enfield of USC and Steve
Afford of UCLA, in addition to a few of the confer
ence's most outstanding players from a year ago: All-
Pac-12 guards Jahii Carson of Arizona State, Spencer
Dinwiddie of Colorado and C.J. Wilcox of Washington.
Arizona State head coach Herb Sendek and Col
orado's Dinwiddie were particularly complimentary of
Stanford's talent when speaking about the Cardinal's
contingent.
"Powell is an NBA forward," Sendek said, while
Dinwiddie noted that Powell and junior guard Chas
son Randle were two of the better players in the con
ference.
Despite being one of the most experienced teams
in the country, the Cardinal, which finished last season
with a 19-15 (9-9 Pac-12) record, was picked sixth in
the preseason media poll behind Arizona, UCLA, Col
orado, Oregon and Cal.
The team returns four of five starters and all but
two scholarship players from last year's squad. The
Cardinal is led by Powell, Randle, senior forward Josh

Senior forward Dwight Powell (left) returned to the Farm for his senior year after turning
down a chance at the NBA. The Cardinal is hoping for an NCAA Tournament berth.
Huestis an All-Pac-12 First
Team Defense honoree last
season and senior point
guard Aaron Bright. The four
returning starters bring back
combined averages of 48.3
points, 21.6 rebounds, 9.0 as
sists, 3.3 blocks, and 3.2 steals
per game.
Powell recognizes the
abundant wealth of talent and
experience returning for the
Cardinal this season and in
tends to capitalize on it.
"We haven't won at the lev
el we have wanted to so far in
my career," Powell said, "so
we've taken a long offseason
to develop on the court, to
grow closer together, and as
well off the court, to try and
develop that synergy and cre
ate a culture of winning."
"We have definitely spent
a lot of time with our group
both on and off the court and
developing some synergy,"
Dawkins added. "[We're] ex
cited about our way of play
ing, excited about the way
we're enjoying the process
and looking forward to contin
uing to get better throughout
the next couple months."
The team had gained me
dia attention for undergoing a

Navy SEAL training pro
gram during the offseason.
Powell certainly believes that
it will pay off for the team in
the future.
"I definitely think it was
beneficial," Powell said. "First
and foremost, it was a chal
lenge that maybe not all of us
thought we could get through,
but we did. And we did so as a
team. I think we can take
away a lot from that going in
to our season and in the
preparation for our season, as
far as no excuses and fighting
through adversity and fight
ing through pain, but all to
gether. So, yeah, we got a lot
out of it."
Powell is clearly hungry
for more this season as the
Cardinal seeks to make its
first NCAA tournament ap
pearance since the 2007-08
season. That year, the team
reached the Sweet Sixteen
behind future NBA stars
Brook 'lO and Robin Lopez
'lO. Powell, who returned for
his senior season rather than
declare for the professional
draft, in the same mold as fel
low student athletes Shayne
Skov 'l3, Ben Gardner 'l3
and most famously, Andrew
Luck 'l2, said it was impor
tant to him to return for his
senior season.

"Coming in with [my
class], we had a lot of goals of
things we wanted to achieve

and we needed to achieve to
deem our career as collegiate
athletes successful," Powell
said. "And not all of those
things have been accom
plished yet. So coming back,
personally, for me, it was ex
tremely important."
If the Cardinal is going to
achieve some of those goals
this season, the team will need
to be better at closing out
close games. Despite leading
the league in scoring and
three-point field goal percent
age during conference play as
well as finishing second in
scoring margin, Stanford fin
ished just 3-7 in Pac-12 games
last season decided by single
digits.
What might the team do
better to translate some of
those points into wins this
time around?
"We definitely have a new
way of playing and a new way
of also thinking," Dawkins
said. "That's been something
that's been our approach from
the preseason up until now."
Dawkins, Powell and the
rest of the Cardinal will hope
they can put the team's new
mindset to good use when the
team opens its season Nov. 8
against Bueknell, an NCAA
tournament team from a sea
son ago.

ing for a better game now."
Some of the notable faces at this year's event in
cluded coaching newcomers Enfield of USC and Steve
Afford of UCLA, in addition to a few of the confer
ence's most outstanding players from a year ago: All-
Pac-12 guards Jahii Carson of Arizona State, Spencer
Dinwiddie of Colorado and C.J. Wilcox of Washington.
Arizona State head coach Herb Sendek and Col
orado's Dinwiddie were particularly complimentary of
Stanford's talent when speaking about the Cardinal's
contingent.
"Powell is an NBA forward," Sendek said, while
Dinwiddie noted that Powell and junior guard Chas
son Randle were two of the better players in the con
ference.
Despite being one of the most experienced teams
in the country, the Cardinal, which finished last season
with a 19-15 (9-9 Pac-12) record, was picked sixth in
the preseason media poll behind Arizona, UCLA, Col
orado, Oregon and Cal.

two scholarship players from last year's squad. The
Cardinal is led by Powell, Randle, senior forward Josh

Senior forward Dwight Powell (left) returned to the Farm for his senior year after turning
down a chance at the NBA. The Cardinal is hoping for an NCAA Tournament berth.
Huestis an All-Pac-12 First
Team Defense honoree last
season and senior point
guard Aaron Bright. The four
returning starters bring back
combined averages of 48.3
points, 21.6 rebounds, 9.0 as
sists, 3.3 blocks, and 3.2 steals
per game.
Powell recognizes the
abundant wealth of talent and
experience returning for the
Cardinal this season and in
tends to capitalize on it.
"We haven't won at the lev
el we have wanted to so far in
my career," Powell said, "so
we've taken a long offseason
to develop on the court, to
grow closer together, and as
well off the court, to try and
develop that synergy and cre
ate a culture of winning."
"We have definitely spent
a lot of time with our group
both on and off the court and
developing some synergy,"
Dawkins added. "[We're] ex
cited about our way of play
ing, excited about the way
we're enjoying the process
and looking forward to contin
uing to get better throughout
the next couple months."
The team had gained me
dia attention for undergoing a

Navy SEAL training pro
gram during the offseason.
Powell certainly believes that
it will pay off for the team in
the future.
"I definitely think it was
beneficial," Powell said. "First
and foremost, it was a chal
lenge that maybe not all of us
thought we could get through,
but we did. And we did so as a
team. I think we can take
away a lot from that going in
to our season and in the
preparation for our season, as
far as no excuses and fighting
through adversity and fight
ing through pain, but all to
gether. So, yeah, we got a lot
out of it."
Powell is clearly hungry
for more this season as the
Cardinal seeks to make its
first NCAA tournament ap
pearance since the 2007-08
season. That year, the team
reached the Sweet Sixteen
behind future NBA stars
Brook 'lO and Robin Lopez
'lO. Powell, who returned for
his senior season rather than
declare for the professional
draft, in the same mold as fel
low student athletes Shayne
Skov 'l3, Ben Gardner 'l3
and most famously, Andrew
Luck 'l2, said it was impor
tant to him to return for his
senior season.

"Coming in with [my
class], we had a lot of goals of
things we wanted to achieve

and we needed to achieve to
deem our career as collegiate
athletes successful," Powell
said. "And not all of those
things have been accom
plished yet. So coming back,
personally, for me, it was ex
tremely important."
If the Cardinal is going to
achieve some of those goals
this season, the team will need
to be better at closing out
close games. Despite leading
the league in scoring and
three-point field goal percent
age during conference play as
well as finishing second in
scoring margin, Stanford fin
ished just 3-7 in Pac-12 games
last season decided by single
digits.
What might the team do
better to translate some of
those points into wins this
time around?
"We definitely have a new
way of playing and a new way
of also thinking," Dawkins
said. "That's been something
that's been our approach from
the preseason up until now."
Dawkins, Powell and the
rest of the Cardinal will hope
they can put the team's new
mindset to good use when the
team opens its season Nov. 8
against Bueknell, an NCAA
tournament team from a sea
son ago.

Stanford senior forward Dwight Powell and head

coach tandems that descended on the Pac-12 Net
works studio last Thursday for the Pac-12 Men's Bas
ketball Media Day. The event was in anticipation of the
upcoming season, which officially tips off on Nov. 8.
The Media Day is typically an opportunity for
members of the press to ask a wide variety of ques
tions to the players and coaches, ranging from the po
litically comical to the competitively incendiary. On be
ing asked for his take on the end of the government
shutdown, Oregon State head coach Craig Robinson
brother of First Lady Michelle Obama replied,
"You see the stuff I have to put up with?"
His response elicited laughs from members of the
press, while new USC and former Florida Gulf Coast
head coach Andy Enfield was grilled on a comment he
made in practice last week about the "slow" UCLA
Bruins, his new crosstown rival.
