# POWELL READY FOR SEASON
## CARD PICKED TO FINISH SIXTH IN PAC-12 RACE 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford senior forward Dwight Powell and head
coach Johnny Dawkins were among the 12 player
coach tandems that descended on the Pac-12 Net
works studio last Thursday for the Pac-12 Men's Bas
ketball Media Day. The event was in anticipation of the
upcoming season, which officially tips off on Nov. 8.
The Media Day is typically an opportunity for
members of the press to ask a wide variety of ques
tions to the players and coaches, ranging from the po
litically comical to the competitively incendiary. On be
ing asked for his take on the end of the government
shutdown, Oregon State head coach Craig Robinson
brother of First Lady Michelle Obama replied,
"You see the stuff I have to put up with?"
His response elicited laughs from members of the
press, while new USC and former Florida Gulf Coast
head coach Andy Enfield was grilled on a comment he
made in practice last week about the "slow" UCLA
Bruins, his new crosstown rival.
"It will add more fire to the battle," said Trojan
guard J.T. Terrell, defending his new coach. "I'm hop
ing for a better game now."
Some of the notable faces at this year's event in
cluded coaching newcomers Enfield of USC and Steve
Afford of UCLA, in addition to a few of the confer
ence's most outstanding players from a year ago: All-
Pac-12 guards Jahii Carson of Arizona State, Spencer
Dinwiddie of Colorado and C.J. Wilcox of Washington.
Arizona State head coach Herb Sendek and Col
orado's Dinwiddie were particularly complimentary of
Stanford's talent when speaking about the Cardinal's
contingent.
"Powell is an NBA forward," Sendek said, while
Dinwiddie noted that Powell and junior guard Chas
son Randle were two of the better players in the con
ference.
Despite being one of the most experienced teams
in the country, the Cardinal, which finished last season
with a 19-15 (9-9 Pac-12) record, was picked sixth in
the preseason media poll behind Arizona, UCLA, Col
orado, Oregon and Cal.
The team returns four of five starters and all but
two scholarship players from last year's squad. The
Cardinal is led by Powell, Randle, senior forward Josh
