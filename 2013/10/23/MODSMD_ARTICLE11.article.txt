### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
As a whole, the Stanford foot
ball team looked much improved
against No. 9 UCLA after its dis
appointing loss at unranked
Utah. Not only was the Cardi
nal's defense stifling, but its of
fense cilso put together several
solid drives (though it often
failed to capitalize). We asked
football writers Do-Hyoung
Park, Winston Shi and David
Cohn: Which Stanford player
made the biggest strides last
week?
Do: Andrus Peat
During Stanford's devastating
loss to Utah two weeks ago, sopho
more left tackle Andrus Peat had an
unusually rough day, as he couldn't
cleanly handle his blocking assign
ments on several occasions. This was
especially evident on a play in the
fourth quarter, with Stanford trailing
by 13 and facing a critical third down.
The 6-foot-7,312-pound Peat couldn't
hold back the much smaller 255-
pound Nate Orchard, who easily got
to Hogan on his blind side and forced
a fumble. Although Peat fell on top of
the ball to retain possession, it was ev
ident throughout the afternoon that
Hogan was never very comfortable in
the pocket, due in part to plays like
that one.
Against UCLA on Saturday, how
ever, Peat showed the Cardinal faith
ful exactly why people are touting
him as a future NFL-caliber talent.
Faced with one of the toughest block
ing assignments in the nation in All-
Pac-12 linebacker Anthony Barr, Peat
had an absolutely fantastic day as he
stood firm and anchored the left side
of the line. Hogan took zero sacks on
the afternoon against a UCLA front
seven that had averaged over two
sacks per game as Peat held back the
floodgates play after play and kept
Barr from getting anywhere near
Hogan.
Although Peat had been perform
ing at a high level while settling into
his first-year starting role, his per
formance against the Bruins was es
pecially significant in that it allowed
Hogan to regain his pocket presence
after three shaky weeks.
Winston: Devon Cqjuste
I think Do made a great pick of
Peat, although I don't think that Peat
made strides in the past week so
much as build off what had already
been an extremely high level of play.
Junior wideout Devon Cajuste al
ready had his breakout game against
Washington State to the tune of 115
yards, but Saturday's game revealed
