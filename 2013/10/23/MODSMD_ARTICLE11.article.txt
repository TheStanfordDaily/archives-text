# TAKE THREE

### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
As a whole, the Stanford foot
ball team looked much improved
against No. 9 UCLA after its dis
appointing loss at unranked
Utah. Not only was the Cardi
nal's defense stifling, but its of
fense cilso put together several
solid drives (though it often
failed to capitalize). We asked
football writers Do-Hyoung
Park, Winston Shi and David
Cohn: Which Stanford player
made the biggest strides last
week?
Do: Andrus Peat
During Stanford's devastating
loss to Utah two weeks ago, sopho
more left tackle Andrus Peat had an
unusually rough day, as he couldn't
cleanly handle his blocking assign
ments on several occasions. This was
especially evident on a play in the
fourth quarter, with Stanford trailing
by 13 and facing a critical third down.
The 6-foot-7,312-pound Peat couldn't
hold back the much smaller 255-
pound Nate Orchard, who easily got
to Hogan on his blind side and forced
a fumble. Although Peat fell on top of
the ball to retain possession, it was ev
ident throughout the afternoon that
Hogan was never very comfortable in
the pocket, due in part to plays like
that one.
Against UCLA on Saturday, how
ever, Peat showed the Cardinal faith
ful exactly why people are touting
him as a future NFL-caliber talent.
Faced with one of the toughest block
ing assignments in the nation in All-
Pac-12 linebacker Anthony Barr, Peat
had an absolutely fantastic day as he
stood firm and anchored the left side
of the line. Hogan took zero sacks on
the afternoon against a UCLA front
seven that had averaged over two
sacks per game as Peat held back the
floodgates play after play and kept
Barr from getting anywhere near
Hogan.
Although Peat had been perform
ing at a high level while settling into
his first-year starting role, his per
formance against the Bruins was es
pecially significant in that it allowed
Hogan to regain his pocket presence
after three shaky weeks.
Winston: Devon Cqjuste
I think Do made a great pick of
Peat, although I don't think that Peat
made strides in the past week so
much as build off what had already
been an extremely high level of play.
Junior wideout Devon Cajuste al
ready had his breakout game against
Washington State to the tune of 115
yards, but Saturday's game revealed
a completely new aspect of his
game.
When a mad rash of in
juries on the defensive line
forced sophomore tight end
Luke Kaumatule to switch to
his old defensive end position,
Cajuste switched roles as well
(albeit, not positions). Sure,
Kaumatule hadn't seen that
many targets on offense, but
on Saturday, Cajuste showed
that he could be the big, reli
able and still explosive pos
session receiver that Stanford
had hoped Kaumatule would
eventually become.
Now, Cajuste's big-play
potential has always been
known, and he was indeed
clinical in that role against
UCLA, as Hogan hit him for
a key 34-yard gain that set up
Stanford's second touchdown.
With the big X receiver, Ca
juste, lined up to the inside
and in the slot on several oc
casions, Hogan went to him
repeatedly, and the receiver
delivered.
Two key Cajuste catches
on third downs led to two
Stanford scores. Hogan went
7-of-8 on throws to Cajuste,
and although Cajuste was the
target on Hogan's only inter
ception, he was money in the
bank the rest of the game.
The big junior led Stanford
with seven catches for 105
yards almost as many
catches as he'd had in the last
three games combined.
If Cajuste can be the reli
able, chain-moving safety
valve that Zach Ertz and
Stepfan Taylor were for
Hogan last year, Stanford's
offense will be moving along a
lot more smoothly than be
fore.

David: Kodi Whitfield
While Winston and Do
made great selections with
their takes, I think that soph
omore wide receiver Kodi

Whitfield also had a breakout
day for Stanford. In fact,
Whitfield's emergence on the
national stage was so pro
found that his touchdown
catch vaulted him to the top of
Sports Center's Top 10 plays.
However, the significance
of Whitfield's first career
touchdown reception does not
stop at his spectacular one
handed grab; the play also
came at a crucial moment in
the game, with the score tied
at 3 halfway through the third
quarter. His spectacular catch
gave Stanford much-needed
points against a UCLA team
that had not allowed any team
to score in the third quarter
prior to Saturday.
With opposing defenses
now consistently game-plan
ning to minimize the impact
of Ty Montgomery and De
von Cajuste's health now at
least momentarily in ques
tion, Whitfield may become

an even more important cog
in the offense going forward.
At the very least, Whitfield's
catch in double coverage pro
pelled the Cardinal to a lead
it would never relinquish.
This singular play clearly
demonstrates that Stanford
has yet another talented wide
receiver who is capable of
making a game-changing
play on the largest stage
when the lights are brightest.
This revelation alone repre
sents a big step forward for
both Stanford's offense and
for Whitfield's continued de
velopment.

Richards, who played per

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Junior wide receiver Devon Cajuste (above) had a career
game against UCLA Saturday. Winston Shi picked him as
the Cardinal's most improved player in the winning effort.
