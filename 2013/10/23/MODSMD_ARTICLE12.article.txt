## CARDINAL ON THE MEND 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Few college football players will ever have a
touchdown catch as spectacular as sophomore Ko
di Whitfield's grab this past Saturday. Even fewer,
if any at all, will have as amazing of a catch for
their first career touchdown as Whitfield did.
"It didn't start too well," Whitfield admitted. "I
got pressed at the line. It was more so how could I
recover and get in a position for [junior quarter
back Kevin] Hogan to throw me the ball. Once I
looked back for the ball, it was in the air and [I just
thought] I have to catch it at this point."
Whitfield's catch will surely wind up as one of
college football's top plays of the season, but un
fortunately for him, Shane Victorino's grand slam
to clinch the Boston Red Sox a berth in the World
Series stole the number one spot on Sports Ce
nter's Top 10 plays over the weekend.
"I was a little a disappointed," remarked Whit
field jokingly about not earning the Sports Center
top play distinction.
Catch or no catch, by virtue of being the son of
former Stanford All-American offensive lineman
Bob Whitfield '93, Kodi is always pushed to be his
best at blocking by his father, who acts as a men
tor from a lineman's point of view as Kodi plays
the game.
"At first, he asked me how I missed that block
on 97-Power," said Kodi about his dad's first words
to him after the game. "We talk football a lot. It's
mostly about how my blocking can improve."
Another wide receiver that stepped up and
earned more playing time against UCLA was jun
ior Jordan Pratt. Pratt, the oldest member of the

Cardinal at age 28, played minor league baseball
for eight years as a pitcher before choosing to
come to Stanford and pursue a degree. Pratt
caught his first pass of the year and took it for 13
yards on Saturday.
"He has some valuable experience as far as life
goes outside of football," said Whitfield about
Pratt. "An affectionate nickname we have for him
is 'Pratt Daddy' because he's a lot older than all of
us; he's one of the guys on the team who's married
as well. He's a little separated socially from us as
well but he loves the game just as much as we do."

Despite the increasing number of injuries
building up among Cardinal players, the injury
outlook is relatively bright moving forward. Junior
wideout Devon Cajuste, who caught seven passes
for 109 yards the second-highest total of his ca
reer injured his right leg and left the game on
Saturday early in the fourth quarter, but the knee
appears to not be as seriously injured as originally
feared.
"There is a chance Devon Cajuste will play this
week," detailed head coach David Shaw. "No liga
ment damage, MRI was pretty clean, X-rays pret
ty clean. It's probably a little more than a hard-to
deal-with bone bruise, but he's feeling better, actu
ally ran a little bit yesterday... If he can't go, he
should be ready for Oregon."
On special teams, senior kicker Jordan
Williamson missed the game against UCLA due to
a tweaked muscle in his leg and sophomore Conrad
Ukropina kicked in his absence, going l-for-2 on
field goal attempts and converting all three extra

Junior wide receiver Jordan Pratt (87) picked up his first catch of the 2013 season Saturday against
UCLA. Pratt played eight seasons of minor league baseball before joining the Cardinal roster in
2011. Pratt's teammates have jokingly nicknamed him "Pratt Daddy" due to his rare older age.
