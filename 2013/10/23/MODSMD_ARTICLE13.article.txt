## SEEING GREEN Striking a Balance 
### Holly Moeller 
Last week, I wrote a column
that was supposed to be about
inspiration. I told the story of
Rachel Carson, famed naturalist, sci
ence writer, and personal hero.
Fifty years after Silent Spring's
publication, I figured I could get
away with a quick summary of Car
son's contributions. Judging by some
of the commentary I received, I was
wrong.
For example, I referred to Car
son's exhaustive research on the en
vironmental harms posed by DDT,
which was, at the time, extensively
used to control disease-spreading
and crop-harming insects.
While Congress ultimately
agreed with her conclusion that DDT
was overused in the United States
where we were already "winning"
the battle against these pests with
other means the chemical was still
used elsewhere in the world where
other means of insect control were
less available or less effective.
Today, DDT is banned worldwide,
mostly because of the threat it poses
to human health because of its
acute toxicity, because it decreases
sperm counts, and so on. But excep
tions to the ban are permitted be
cause sometimes, the potential to
save human lives outweighs the
costs.
So many times we as individuals,
and as groups of policymakers, oper
ate like pendulums, swinging from
one extreme to the other - from liber
al use of DDT to its ban (and back
again to those who hold Carson re
sponsible for millions of malaria
caused deaths).
It's only by damping this instinct
to seek black-and-white answers that
we can progress as a society. Nu
anced views are tougher: they re
quire more energy spent collecting
information, and more thought di
gesting that information. But in the
end, they're more truthful and more
rewarding.
I often say that "Seeing Green" is
really about seeing in shades of gray.
Last week, trying to squeeze in un
der my word limit, I probably paint
ed Rachel Carson a bit too white in
comparison to DDT's black. Yet some
of the responses I received were even
more extreme, ranging from unin
formed chastisements to personal at
tacks.
My parents, sports coaches, sci
ence advisors, and journalism in
structors trained me to have a thick
skin. Still, some of the attacks stung,
and they made me think hard about
what Rachel Carson had to go
through during the last 18 months of
her life. The backlash, magnified by
Silent Spring's popularity and the
big pocketbooks of the chemical in
dustry, was ferocious.
Fortunately, I've never faced a
threat to my safety because of my
work. But I have friends in graduate
school who have already had to think
hard about whether their careers are
worth subjecting families to the occa
sional death threat. Sadly, they're not
the first, nor likely to be the last.
Are our reactions to ideas that we
don't like becoming more extreme?
Some would argue that the nature of
modern media - and, generally, infor
mation accessibility in the digital age
- has amplified the rabid nature of

the more aggressive among us.
Many comment forums, like the
one on The Stanford Daily's web
page, are anonymous: It's much easi
er to make vitriolic comments if no
one knows who you are. And while,
as an opinion columnist for The Dai
ly, my voice gets promoted to a slight
ly higher level of authority, anyone
with an Internet connection can post
his or her opinions on almost any fo
rum. It's easy to find both like-mind
ed people to reinforce your view
point, and dissenters to target.
Simultaneously, the media strug
gles with its timeless charge of unbi
ased reporting. Achieving "balance"
is especially challenging today be
cause so many environmental issues
have become hopelessly politicized.
For example, though internation
al scientific consensus is that "warm
ing of the climate system is unequiv
ocal", and "human influence on the
climate system is clear" (and the "sci
entists" who write otherwise are,
frankly, less credible), barely half of
Americans believe them. Does a me
dia outlet have to pair every climate
scientist with a skeptic?
It was refreshing last week to
read a brief piece from the Los Ange
les Times letters editor, Paul Thorn
ton. He wrote that he wouldn't print
climate change denial letters any
more because, the scientific consen
sus being what it is, these letters are
simply not factual.
And while his job as an editor is to
incorporate valued varied view
points, he will not sacrifice his fact
keeping mission. (His comment, of
course, was quickly met with accusa
tions of bias, slander calling him a
"moron," and renewed "liberal me
dia" labeling for the "LA SLIMES".)
We need more bravery like Thorn
ton's truth-telling. Being fearless is
just as important as being tireless
you won't change any minds if you
don't try. People may react, and over
react.
You may overreact yourself. Just
remember that you have the intelli
gence and the ability to damp that
pendulum swing and pick out those
shades of gray.

Does media have
to pair every
climate scientist
with a skeptic?

Last week, I wrote a column
that was supposed to be about
inspiration. I told the story of
Rachel Carson, famed naturalist, sci
ence writer, and personal hero.
Fifty years after Silent Spring's
publication, I figured I could get
away with a quick summary of Car
son's contributions. Judging by some
of the commentary I received, I was
wrong.
For example, I referred to Car
son's exhaustive research on the en
vironmental harms posed by DDT,
which was, at the time, extensively
used to control disease-spreading
and crop-harming insects.
While Congress ultimately
agreed with her conclusion that DDT
was overused in the United States
where we were already "winning"
the battle against these pests with
other means the chemical was still
used elsewhere in the world where
other means of insect control were
less available or less effective.
Today, DDT is banned worldwide,
mostly because of the threat it poses
to human health because of its
acute toxicity, because it decreases
sperm counts, and so on. But excep
tions to the ban are permitted be
cause sometimes, the potential to
save human lives outweighs the
costs.
So many times we as individuals,
and as groups of policymakers, oper
ate like pendulums, swinging from
one extreme to the other - from liber
al use of DDT to its ban (and back
again to those who hold Carson re
sponsible for millions of malaria
caused deaths).
It's only by damping this instinct
to seek black-and-white answers that
we can progress as a society. Nu
anced views are tougher: they re
quire more energy spent collecting
information, and more thought di
gesting that information. But in the
end, they're more truthful and more
rewarding.
I often say that "Seeing Green" is
really about seeing in shades of gray.
Last week, trying to squeeze in un
der my word limit, I probably paint
ed Rachel Carson a bit too white in
comparison to DDT's black. Yet some
of the responses I received were even
more extreme, ranging from unin
formed chastisements to personal at
tacks.
My parents, sports coaches, sci
ence advisors, and journalism in
structors trained me to have a thick
skin. Still, some of the attacks stung,
and they made me think hard about
what Rachel Carson had to go
through during the last 18 months of
her life. The backlash, magnified by
Silent Spring's popularity and the
big pocketbooks of the chemical in
dustry, was ferocious.
Fortunately, I've never faced a
threat to my safety because of my
work. But I have friends in graduate
school who have already had to think
hard about whether their careers are
worth subjecting families to the occa
sional death threat. Sadly, they're not
the first, nor likely to be the last.
Are our reactions to ideas that we
don't like becoming more extreme?
Some would argue that the nature of
modern media - and, generally, infor
mation accessibility in the digital age
- has amplified the rabid nature of

the more aggressive among us.
Many comment forums, like the
one on The Stanford Daily's web
page, are anonymous: It's much easi
er to make vitriolic comments if no
one knows who you are. And while,
as an opinion columnist for The Dai
ly, my voice gets promoted to a slight
ly higher level of authority, anyone
with an Internet connection can post
his or her opinions on almost any fo
rum. It's easy to find both like-mind
ed people to reinforce your view
point, and dissenters to target.
Simultaneously, the media strug
gles with its timeless charge of unbi
ased reporting. Achieving "balance"
is especially challenging today be
cause so many environmental issues
have become hopelessly politicized.
For example, though internation
al scientific consensus is that "warm
ing of the climate system is unequiv
ocal", and "human influence on the
climate system is clear" (and the "sci
entists" who write otherwise are,
frankly, less credible), barely half of
Americans believe them. Does a me
dia outlet have to pair every climate
scientist with a skeptic?
It was refreshing last week to
read a brief piece from the Los Ange
les Times letters editor, Paul Thorn
ton. He wrote that he wouldn't print
climate change denial letters any
more because, the scientific consen
sus being what it is, these letters are
simply not factual.
And while his job as an editor is to
incorporate valued varied view
points, he will not sacrifice his fact
keeping mission. (His comment, of
course, was quickly met with accusa
tions of bias, slander calling him a
"moron," and renewed "liberal me
dia" labeling for the "LA SLIMES".)
