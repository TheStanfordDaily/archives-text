# SUPER TUESDAY
## VC to DC A
						far cry from Zuckerberg's hoodies, Washington is not only hyper-partisan, it's hyper-professional.

Moving from the heart of Sili
con Valley to the center of
national politics has been a
shock to the system to say the least,
especially for this Midwesterner.
Some would probably guess that
D.C. is paradise for a political
junkie and it is but the Valley
isn't so bad either.
First things first: there is no
"Stanford Bubble" in Washington.
Unsurprisingly, almost everyone in
the District is focused on national
news and world affairs. One student
here joked that even his taxi driver
was more knowledgeable about pol
itics than the average Stanford stu
dent.
The city is obsessed with news.
Half a million copies of The Wash
ington Post go out each day to resi
dents of the District, Virginia and
Maryland, which is not to mention

The Post's free daily edition, Ex
press or the nation's largest dailies,
The Wall Street Journal and The
New York Times. The Post reports
that nearly 70% of DC area adults
read it or an affiliate at least once a
week.
Part of this phenomenon, of
course, is the nature of business in
Washington, D.C. Almost 40% of
residents in the District work for
the government, not to mention
those whose private sector jobs re
volve around politics. Washington,
at its core, is a company town.
While this focus is often a re
freshing change from The Bubble,
it too can be a drag. Even as an ar
dent Democrat, I have found D.C.
to be hyper-partisan. The immedi
ate conversation after the debt ceil
ing fight was about which party and
which individuals "won" there
was no time for a sigh of relief and a
short respite. Hidden in every con
versation about policy is a calculat
ed political stance.
A far cry from Zuckerberg's
hoodies, Washington is not only hy
per-partisan, it's hyper-professional.
The attitude at work is to arrive
early and stay late. Here, hard and
dedicated work gets you recognized
and promoted, but only if it's visi
ble. The opposite is true at Stan
ford; there is a reason we have the
Duck Syndrome on campus.
Work permeates everything
here: how you dress, how you drink,
even how you walk. "Casual Friday"
in the office may permit jeans, but
those jeans must be paired with a
blazer. "Dress to impress" has more
meaning here than it ever did at
Stanford.
While you might anticipate suits
being more common than flip-flops,
the professional role of drinking is
less expected. Young Washingtoni
ans love to go out to the bars, not
only to relax, but also to network.
That, of course, is not to mention
the copious amounts of coffee con
sumed throughout the week.
Maybe it's the caffeine, but the

pace of life moves more quickly in
D.C. People walk with purpose
here, especially on the escalator
down to the Metro: walk on the left,
stand on the right. Mixing that ax
iom is much like heading the wrong
direction around the Circle of
Death: it will get you yelled at.
Unlike Silicon Valley's entrepre
neurial spirit, Washington is entire
ly establishment based. Indeed, it's
so bureaucratic, various interac
tions I have had suggest that co
workers deal with positions not
individuals, titles, not people.
In a similarly bureaucratic man
ner, "start ups" are a vague concept,
still uncommon and unheard of in
government. The expected career
path is to work up through the hier
archy, not side step it with a new
product.
But more than that, the role of
technology here is much smaller.
Blackberry has maintained its hold
on government employees, despite
its declining relevance in the larger
smartphone market. Recall the bat
tle over SOPA and PIPA that took
place mostly during January of
2012. Government and Tech don't
always get along.
But they can and they should.
The Valley's skilled and spirited
workers could no doubt help solve
many of healthcare.gov's vexing
glitches, amongst other challenges.
Stanford has its benefits, as
does D.C. Most importantly, both
places have something to learn
from the other. The District should
take itself less seriously sometimes
and relax: it's okay to have a drink
without reciting your resume. On
the other hand, Stanford students
should try to engage with the na
tion's affairs more. Likewise, my
experience in Washington has
shown me that we should recognize
and applaud hard work; people
shouldn't try to hide it under the
water.
