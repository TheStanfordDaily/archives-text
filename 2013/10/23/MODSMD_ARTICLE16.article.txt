### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
For the third year in a row,
Stanford women's tennis swept
the USTA/ITA Regional Champi
onships, as senior Kristie Ahn
cruised to a singles title while
freshman Taylor Davidson and
junior Ellen Tsay claimed the
doubles title in the Northwest
Region.
Ahn, a two-time Ail-American
who won the decisive match in
last year's NCAA Championships
against Texas A&M, followed up a
strong start to the season with an
absolutely dominant performance
on her home court at the Stan
ford-hosted regional.
In the nine matches that she
played throughout the singles
tournament, the third-seeded sen
ior never dropped a single set and
steamrolled first-seeded Zsofi Su
sanyi of Cal in the semifinals, 6-0,
6-1, before easily taking out the
sixth-seeded Jenny Jullien of St.
Mary's in the finals, 6-4, 6-2.
The rest of Stanford's
women's team also had signifi
cant success throughout the sin
gles tournament as six of the top
32 and four of the top eight repre

sented the Farm. Tsay and
Davidson consecutively lost to
Susanyi in the round of 16 and
the quarterfinals, before Ahn
took care of business against her
in the semifinals. On the other
side of the bracket, freshman
Caroline Doyle and freshman
Carol Zhao were also consecu
tively defeated in the quarterfi
nals and semifinals by Jullien,
who would go on to be defeated
by Ahn.
Ahn almost claimed the dou
bles championship as well, as she
and Zhao made it all the way to
the finals before falling to David
son and Tsay, 8-6, in a closely con
tested, all-Stanford final.
With the win, Tsay notched
her third consecutive doubles ti
tle at the USTA/ITA Regionals
after winning the event in each of
the last two years with the now
graduated Stacey Tan 'l3 as her
partner. Ahn's singles victory al
so marked the fourth straight
season in which a member of the
Cardinal claimed the singles title.
In the men's tournaments at
St. Mary's, however, the Cardinal
was less successful. The last man
standing for Stanford was sopho
more Anthony Tsodikov, who was

eventually eliminated, 6-3,6-4, by
Cal's Andre Goransson in the
quarterfinals.
Junior John Morrissey, who
entered the tournament as the
No. 1 seed, was upset by Pacific's
Sam Verbeek in the round of 16 as
every Stanford player still stand
ing outside of Tsodikov Morris
sey, sophomores Trey Strobel,
Nolan Paige and Maciek Ro
manowicz was taken down be
fore reaching the quarterfinals.
The Card fared only slightly
better in the men's doubles tour
nament, with Morrissey and
freshman partner Yale Goldberg
making it to the semifinals before
being soundly defeated, 8-2, by
the Cal duo of Chase Melton and
Gregory Bayane.
Moving forward, the women
will look to continue their success
at the ITA National Indoors
Tournament at Flushing Mead
ows, N.Y., in early November.
The men's team will also attend
the ITA National Indoors Tour
nament after an invitational at
the University of the Pacific a
week earlier.
