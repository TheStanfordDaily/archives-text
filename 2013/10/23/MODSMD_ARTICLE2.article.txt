# STUDENT LIFE
## Stripping down with Columbae Q&A with Alec Wilkens '14, Columbae co-op resident FULL MOON 2013 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
Full Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ)
is a tradition that has students wor
rying. Some students worry about
being awkward, some about mono
and some about what clothing to
wear or the lack thereof.
To shed light on nudity at
FMOTQ, The Daily spoke with Alec
Wilkens 'l4, community manager at
Columbae, a co-op house that tradi
tionally attends FMOTQ with a
group of body painters.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Has
there ever been concern about stu
dents, especially freshmen, who feel
uncomfortable because of the nudi
ty? If so, how has Columbae ad
dressed this?
Alec Wilkens (AW): Honestly I
think that once you're no longer a
freshman, you realize that Pull Moon
is a pretty absurd event. It's not a
natural environment people don't
just get together and make out for
no reason. We don't spend time
thinking, 'Oh, are we going to make
people feel uncomfortable in an al
ready weird and uncomfortable envi
ronment?' It's kind of like away for
us to go hard at the event and away
to make people see that it's a pretty
silly thing and that they shouldn't be
taking anything too seriously.
I think we do realize people are
uncomfortable with nudity, including
people in our own house. It's a bit of
a challenge because we do have the
tradition of going nude or partially
nude and the body painting and it's
hard for us to cancel the event just
because it would make someone un
comfortable. This year there are a
number of people not attending the
event because they are uncomfort
able with being around naked people
and being nude themselves. That's
something we've tried to address in
terms of just telling people the rea
son why we get naked and why we
body paint and everything, which is
