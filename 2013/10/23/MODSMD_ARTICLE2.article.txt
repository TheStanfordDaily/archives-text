# STUDENT LIFE
## Stripping down with Columbae Q&A with Alec Wilkens '14, Columbae co-op resident FULL MOON 2013 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
Full Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ)
is a tradition that has students wor
rying. Some students worry about
being awkward, some about mono
and some about what clothing to
wear or the lack thereof.
To shed light on nudity at
FMOTQ, The Daily spoke with Alec
Wilkens 'l4, community manager at
Columbae, a co-op house that tradi
tionally attends FMOTQ with a
group of body painters.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Has
there ever been concern about stu
dents, especially freshmen, who feel
uncomfortable because of the nudi
ty? If so, how has Columbae ad
dressed this?
Alec Wilkens (AW): Honestly I
think that once you're no longer a
freshman, you realize that Pull Moon
is a pretty absurd event. It's not a
natural environment people don't
just get together and make out for
no reason. We don't spend time
thinking, 'Oh, are we going to make
people feel uncomfortable in an al
ready weird and uncomfortable envi
ronment?' It's kind of like away for
us to go hard at the event and away
to make people see that it's a pretty
silly thing and that they shouldn't be
taking anything too seriously.
I think we do realize people are
uncomfortable with nudity, including
people in our own house. It's a bit of
a challenge because we do have the
tradition of going nude or partially
nude and the body painting and it's
hard for us to cancel the event just
because it would make someone un
comfortable. This year there are a
number of people not attending the
event because they are uncomfort
able with being around naked people
and being nude themselves. That's
something we've tried to address in
terms of just telling people the rea
son why we get naked and why we
body paint and everything, which is

basically just to have fun. And if it's
not for you, then there's no point to
do it. There's no pressure with that.

TSD: At FMOTQ, there are hy
giene concerns for attendees who
share kisses. What, if any, are some
hygiene concerns for body painters?
AW: I don't think there's any con
cerns or differences than people that
are fully clothed. I know when I was
a freshman I definitely wanted to
kiss a naked person covered in paint.
So you might get kissed more often,
but other than that, I don't think
there are any specific hygiene con
cerns.

TSD: Can you walk me through
how Columbae preps for FMOTQ?
Any collaboration with Synergy?
AW: We've been doing a lot of
shopping lately like buying plastic to
cover the walls. We've purchased al
cohol and body paint and special face
paint. Synergy's coming a bit earlier
so we can party a bit beforehand. We
also have a little talk with the house
about being safe and how to not
make people feel uncomfortable and
education about what's the point of

getting naked and getting covered in
paint. A, it's really, really fun, and B,
it's a good way to start working on
the body image that we have. I think
especially at Stanford there are
many people who have impressive
bodies and it makes people who are
more average feel more self-con
scious. Being outside with all your
friends with all your clothes off is a
bit more equalizing and helps people
start to realize it's not a big deal if
they don't have a perfect body.
TSD: Last year The Daily re
ported on how Stanford police and li
brarians barred Columbae residents
from performing their traditional
Dead Day streak through Green Li
brary. How have interactions be
tween University officials changed
over the years on the issue of nudi
ty?
AW: The University has been
fairly supportive. We've gotten mul
tiple emails from various people

from different positions of adminis
tration and student government to
make sure that our residents are
safe and don't feel objectified or
picked on by other people at Full
Moon and making sure people can
overcome seeing people naked so
that they can go out with their
friends. I don't think they're partic
ularly in opposition to nudity. They
just want us to be safe with minimal
amount of bad consequences.
Everybody recognizes that it's a
tradition that's not going to not hap
pen. So they might as well help us do
it in a safe way, which we really ap
preciate.

TSD: What memories can you
share about your freshman year
FMOTQ? Do you remember seeing
the Columbae body painters then?
AW: Freshman year FMOTQ
was pretty boring. I think I was way
too sober and it was kind of awk
ward. I made out with a couple peo
ple and then stood around. I did kiss
a Columbae body painter but I did
n't know anything at the time I
thought they were just weirdos with
body paint.
