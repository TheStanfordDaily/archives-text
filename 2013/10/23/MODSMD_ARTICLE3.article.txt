### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO DESK EDITOR 
5-SURE On Foot, the Office of
Alcohol Policy and Education
(OAPE)'s new security escort serv
ice funded by the Stanford Universi
ty Department of Public Safety, was
unofficially launched last night at
Full Moon on The Quad (FMOTQ).
According to Ralph Castro, two
of the five student staffers were as
sisted by sober monitors in walking
around finding students who re
quested help to walk back home
from the event. He added that the pi
lot went well.

"We wanted to gauge feedback
from students and know what they'd
like to get from the program, [as well
as] feedback from the future staff
about what [aspects of the job] they
feel comfortable with," said Betty
Hancock 'l5, 5-SURE student coor
dinator.
The new service, scheduled to of
ficially launch within two weeks, will
feature student staff members rov
ing around high-traffic areas on cam
pus on Friday and Saturday nights to
escort students safely back to then
own residences.
Jarreau Bowen 'O7 M.A. 'OB, as
sistant director and outreach educa
tion coordinator at OAPE, empha
sized that although the campus is
generally safe and well-lit, there are


ZETONG LI/The Stanford Daily
some areas where students don't
feel safe walking to and from alone.
He added that the presence of 5-
SURE On Foot enables more es
cort services to be provided over
longer distances by lessening the
burden on the currently offered 5-
SURE vehicle and golf cart escort
service.
5-SURE On Foot is away of re
sponding to increased student de
mand of the 5-SURE service, which
Hancock believes is due to yearly
increases in the student body as
well as an increased comfort level in
calling 5-SURE.
"[5-SURE is] for anybody who
feels like they're in a dangerous sit
uation on campus, and who wants to
have someone by their side," Han
cock said.
This includes students under
the influence of alcohol, who aren't
comfortable walking home by
themselves after dark and who are
unsure of their way around campus.
According to David Kaczorows
ki, administrative office manager at
OAPE, the walking program was
first put on the table last year dur
ing a discussion of how to best meet
students where they are and help
them return to their dorms.
According to Hancock, the 5-
SURE On Foot program is a nice
complement that fills in the gaps
left by 5-SURE.
Mason Black 'l6 echoed this
statement by qualifying 5-SURE
On Foot as a good idea.
"Part of the issue [with 5-
SURE] is that people who are al
ready on the Row drinking...
there's a potential that they're [ei
ther] too drunk to think to call 5-
SURE [or] they might not know
about it," Black said. "So I think it's
a good idea to actually have people
there to have conversations with
[people]."
Among other issues, 5-SURE
On Foot addresses the modeling of
bystander intervention behavior.
"To do something, it helps to see
other people doing it," Kaczorowski
said. "[We can] build that impulse
into students because they see
[their peers] doing it."
According to Hancock, the de
creased formality of the program al
so renders it much more accessible.

calling 5-SURE.
"[5-SURE is] for anybody who
feels like they're in a dangerous sit
uation on campus, and who wants to
have someone by their side," Han
cock said.
This includes students under
the influence of alcohol, who aren't
comfortable walking home by
themselves after dark and who are
unsure of their way around campus.
According to David Kaczorows
ki, administrative office manager at
OAPE, the walking program was
first put on the table last year dur
ing a discussion of how to best meet
students where they are and help
them return to their dorms.
According to Hancock, the 5-
SURE On Foot program is a nice
complement that fills in the gaps
left by 5-SURE.
Mason Black 'l6 echoed this
statement by qualifying 5-SURE
On Foot as a good idea.
"Part of the issue [with 5-
SURE] is that people who are al
ready on the Row drinking...
there's a potential that they're [ei
ther] too drunk to think to call 5-
SURE [or] they might not know
about it," Black said. "So I think it's
a good idea to actually have people
there to have conversations with
[people]."
Among other issues, 5-SURE
On Foot addresses the modeling of
bystander intervention behavior.
"To do something, it helps to see
other people doing it," Kaczorowski
said. "[We can] build that impulse
into students because they see
[their peers] doing it."
According to Hancock, the de
creased formality of the program al
so renders it much more accessible.
