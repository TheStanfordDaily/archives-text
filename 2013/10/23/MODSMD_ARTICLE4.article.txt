## Bitcoin at Coupa sees mixed reaction 
### GABBI FISHER 
The Coupa Cafe franchise reports a steady
stream of unconventional revenue through Bitcoin, a
digital open-source currency, despite customers'
mixed responses to the payment method.
According to Jean Paul Coupal 'O7, co-founder and
owner of Coupa Cafe, at least 50 different Bitcoin
transactions have been processed since the introduc
tion of the payment method four months ago. He
added that the number of transactions has remained
steady, if not slowly increasing.
"I get a notification on my phone every time
someone buys at Coupa using Bitcoin," Coupal said.
"I get at least one to two a day. They're adding up a
lot. I might have to turn them off soon."
As stated on its main site, Bitcoin "is the first de
centralized peer-to-peer payment network that is
powered by its users with no central authority or
middlemen."
As a result, Bitcoin can offer a higher degree of fi
nancial privacy to its users.
Coupa accepts Bitcoins through Quick Response
(QR) codes. A customer wishing to pay in Bitcoins
would scan Coupa's QR code with a smartphone ap
plication, and directly transfer funds to the cafe a
process that, according to Coupal, takes the same
amount of time as using a credit card.
"We always want to be at the forefront of technol
ogy, especially in away that our customers could in
teract with in their day-to-day activities," he added.
"So, being able to accept Bitcoins in order to get a lat
te or a cappuccino is in line with our vision."
Some customers were hesitant about using Bit
coins for Coupa Cafe. Hart Goldman 'l5 said he knew

of Bitcoins but wouldn't use them
as a payment method.
"I think that [Bitcoins] are a
novelty, but there might be some
motivation behind using them...
like being off the grid," Goldman
said.
Han Lee 'l5 found Bitcoins
frustrating to use.
"Converting real U.S. dollars
into Bitcoins is a painful process
that disincentivizes consumers to
adopt the system," Lee said.
Bitcoins can be acquired
through online Bitcoin exchange
websites and marketplaces, and
stored on digital Bitcoin accounts.
John Backus 'l6, a member of
the Stanford Bitcoin Group that
develops Bitcoin programs and
services, thought that Bitcoins
were better suited for digital trans
actions, not at a cafe.
"At first, [the real-life use of Bit
coins] seems sort of gimmicky," he
said. "The option of obtaining them
in person isn't strictly practical in
my opinion."
Backus also noted Bitcoin's
volatility as a newer form of cur
rency.

"You have issues like the Bitcoin
possibly going up 20 or 30 dollars
[in value] in a day," he said.
To counteract the currency's
volatility, Coupa Cafe's Bitcoin sys
tem has safeguards in place to fa
cilitate its use.
"We program the current ex
change rate of Bitcoin versus dollar
so if the [value of Bitcoin] goes up
or down, you're actually quoted re
al-time what the exchange rate ac
tually is," Coupal said.
As a digital currency, Backus
still argues that Bitcoin's place is
online.
"I absolutely think [Bitcoin use]
will extend beyond Coupa in terms
of other businesses," Backus said.
"It's way more practical in an on
line space because it's a truly digi
tal currency."

seen a steady revenue through the digital currency Bitcoin for the last four
months, students share mixed reactions on using this new payment method.
of Bitcoins but wouldn't use them
as a payment method.
"I think that [Bitcoins] are a
novelty, but there might be some
motivation behind using them...
like being off the grid," Goldman
said.
Han Lee 'l5 found Bitcoins
frustrating to use.
"Converting real U.S. dollars
into Bitcoins is a painful process
that disincentivizes consumers to
adopt the system," Lee said.
Bitcoins can be acquired
through online Bitcoin exchange
websites and marketplaces, and
stored on digital Bitcoin accounts.
John Backus 'l6, a member of
the Stanford Bitcoin Group that
develops Bitcoin programs and
services, thought that Bitcoins
were better suited for digital trans
actions, not at a cafe.
"At first, [the real-life use of Bit
coins] seems sort of gimmicky," he
said. "The option of obtaining them
in person isn't strictly practical in
my opinion."
Backus also noted Bitcoin's
volatility as a newer form of cur
rency.

"You have issues like the Bitcoin
possibly going up 20 or 30 dollars
[in value] in a day," he said.
To counteract the currency's
volatility, Coupa Cafe's Bitcoin sys
tem has safeguards in place to fa
cilitate its use.
"We program the current ex
change rate of Bitcoin versus dollar
so if the [value of Bitcoin] goes up
or down, you're actually quoted re
al-time what the exchange rate ac
tually is," Coupal said.
As a digital currency, Backus
still argues that Bitcoin's place is
online.
"I absolutely think [Bitcoin use]
will extend beyond Coupa in terms
of other businesses," Backus said.
"It's way more practical in an on
line space because it's a truly digi
tal currency."
