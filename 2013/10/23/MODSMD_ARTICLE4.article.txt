## Bitcoin at Coupa sees mixed reaction 
### GABBI FISHER 
The Coupa Cafe franchise reports a steady
stream of unconventional revenue through Bitcoin, a
digital open-source currency, despite customers'
mixed responses to the payment method.
According to Jean Paul Coupal 'O7, co-founder and
owner of Coupa Cafe, at least 50 different Bitcoin
transactions have been processed since the introduc
tion of the payment method four months ago. He
added that the number of transactions has remained
steady, if not slowly increasing.
"I get a notification on my phone every time
someone buys at Coupa using Bitcoin," Coupal said.
"I get at least one to two a day. They're adding up a
lot. I might have to turn them off soon."
As stated on its main site, Bitcoin "is the first de
centralized peer-to-peer payment network that is
powered by its users with no central authority or
middlemen."
As a result, Bitcoin can offer a higher degree of fi
nancial privacy to its users.
Coupa accepts Bitcoins through Quick Response
(QR) codes. A customer wishing to pay in Bitcoins
would scan Coupa's QR code with a smartphone ap
plication, and directly transfer funds to the cafe a
process that, according to Coupal, takes the same
amount of time as using a credit card.
"We always want to be at the forefront of technol
ogy, especially in away that our customers could in
teract with in their day-to-day activities," he added.
"So, being able to accept Bitcoins in order to get a lat
te or a cappuccino is in line with our vision."
Some customers were hesitant about using Bit
coins for Coupa Cafe. Hart Goldman 'l5 said he knew
