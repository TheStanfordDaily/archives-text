## Senate votes to keep BJA bylaws The 						Graduate Student Council will vote tonight on a bill for an overrule 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
With a split 7-7 vote, the 15th Undergradu
ate Senate decided not to overturn the newly
adopted Board of Judicial Affairs (B JA) bylaws.
However, the Graduate Student Council (GSC)
will be voting on a bill tonight that, if approved,
would overturn the very same bylaws.
Although the BJA has the power to unilater
ally adopt new bylaws, several senators â€”in
addition to members of the GSC had ex
pressed concern over both the process by which
the BJA adopted the bylaws and the content of
the bylaws.
Student Co-Chair of the BJA, Miles Seiver
'l4, attended the meeting on Tuesday evening
along with two other BJA student members,
prompting debate on whether to overrule the
bylaws.
Senator John-Lancaster Finley 'l6 advocat
ed overruling the bylaws in order to enable an
informed discussion on them.
"I have been approached with significant
concerns from members of the Stanford com
munity that some of these bylaw amendments
may be detrimental to students going through
the process," Finley said.
He stressed that starting by overruling the
bylaws and then having an informed discussion
in committee about which bylaws to keep, re-
move or amend was the best ap
proach to the situation.
Adam Horowitz M.A. 'lO Ph.D.
'l4, graduate student member of the
BJA, suggested that instead of over
ruling everything now, the BJA and
the ASSU should discuss every
thing in a separate subcommittee,
and come back and overrule the
specific bylaws that should not exist.
The BJA student representa
tives explained that these bylaws
could be overruled at any time.
Horowitz and Seiver also explained
that the changes were intended to
make the judicial process more effi
cient and that extensive time was
put into creating and discussing the
amendments.
"I don't care if you veto it or not.
The conversation from me is going
to happen regardless," Seiver said.
"I know those bylaws came from a
community that felt very strongly
that these were necessary changes
to improve the Stanford community
... All that I ask, as a student, is that
if you are going to be vetoing these
bylaws... [that] you consider
whether you fully understand each
of those bylaws and what you are

vetoing."
Senator Natasha Patel 'l6
who voted against the overruling of
the bylaws felt that the Senate
should trust the judgment of the
BJA.
"I chose to vote against overrul
ing the bylaws because I under
stand that we elect a committee of
students as well as faculty to make
these decisions," Patel said.
"They've had a longer time to as
sess whether the bylaws are good
and we haven't had as much time
and so I'm going to trust their opin
ion over mine."
Senator Abby Dow 'l6 also vot
ed against the overruling of the by
laws, stressing that it was unneces
sary to deconstruct the current by
laws and instead supported review
ing the bylaws in a joint committee
and overruling the specific bylaws
at a later time.
Although the Senate was not
able to fully overrule the bylaws,
the BJA still hopes to work with
both the Senate and the GSC in a
joint committee.
The creation of the committee
will be officially voted on next
week, after the Administration &
Rules Committee decides how
many representatives of the Un
dergraduate Senate should be in
cluded.
Seiver was supportive of the

idea of a joint committee, stressing
that it was the best way to address
this topic.
At the Tuesday night meeting,
the Senate also revisited the topic
of the Senate Innovation Bill, which
was passed last week, in order to

address specific concerns about the
oversight process.
The bill will allocate $3,000 to
each senator to effect change in the
Stanford community. Several sena
tors wanted to increase Senate over
sight over the way that funds were

reimbursed. As a result, the Senate
amended last week's bill by creat
ing an ad-hoc committee to oversee
the reimbursement process.
