## IntroSem offerings increase, apps stay constant 
### FIONA NOONAN 
Though there was an overall increase in the
number of Introductory Seminars (IntroSems)
offered this year - , the number of applications for
and enrollments in fall quarter seminar's stayed
relatively the same as last year, according to
Russell Berman, faculty director of the Stan
ford Introductory Seminar's (SIS) program.
This year, 257 classes are available over the
course of three quarters more than the 221
classes offered last year some of which are
also eligible to fulfill the new Ways of Think
ing/Ways of Doing breadth requirement.
Some fall quarter seminars attracted ex
traordinary application volume, making entry
more difficult.
"These very popular' courses sometimes cre
ate a problem for the program insofar as stu
dents apply for these and nine out of 10 are go
ing to get turned down," Berman said. "Some
times students only apply to those courses that
have strong enrollments, and then they get
turned down multiple times."
Berman noted several courses from all disci
plines with competitive entries this quarter,
including ME26N: Think Like A Designer,
taught by Shilajeet Banerjee M.S. 'OO, associ
ate professor of mechanical engineering at
the d.school; Psychology Professor Carol
Dweck's PSYCHI2N: Self Theories; and

ECON26N: Who gets what? The New Eco
nomics of Matchmaking and Market Design,
taught by Alvin Roth M.A. '73 Ph.D. '74, a
professor of economics who won the 2012 No
bel Prize in Economic Sciences.
The professors who had to review hundreds of
applications to their popular classes developed
their own acceptance policies. Roth specifically
asked his prospective students to write about
something they had experienced related to the
course's subject matter.
"I chose students who wrote about something
interesting," Roth said.
Dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences Richard Sailer, who teaches CLASSHIS
24N: The Roman Empire: Its Grandeur and Its
FhU, went through a similar screening process,
taking only students who "seemed to have a real
reason for taking the course."
Both Sailer's and Roth's courses are among
the few that fulfill the Social Inquiry WAYS grad
uation requirement.
"We are encouraging all of the seminar faculty
to explore whether their course could be certified
to meet one or the other of the WAYS," Berman
said, adding that the Ways of Thinking Ways of
Doing requirements may impact students' course
selections down the road.
WAYS accreditation for classes is reviewed by
the Breadth Governance Board, which is chaired
by Chris Edwards, a professor of mechanical en

gineering. Despite the efforts made by SIS, not all
IntroSem professors went through the process
that would potentially allow their class to fulfill
a WAYS requirement.
"This is, in a sense, similar to what prevailed
under the old GER regime," Berman said. "We
would encourage faculty to get GER accredita
tion for then* courses, and many would, some
wouldn't. These are courses about which facul
ty are very passionate and they want to struc
ture them in then* particular ways."
Regardless of the requirements, students
and professors alike have continued to enjoy
the IntroSem experience.
"I think [the IntroSem Program] is quite ef
fective," Sailer said. "And that's because I think
that learning is most effective when there's a lot
of exchange between students and between stu
dents and faculty, and I think having a small
group of students encourages that."
Although certain courses will most likely re
ceive many applications, Berman said stu
dents should not necessarily worry if they are
not accepted, and he encouraged students to
show up to their desired class on the first day.
"If there's space available, they may luck
out," Berman said.
IntroSem applications for Winter Quarter
seminars are due Nov. 11.

Russell Berman, faculty director of the
Stanford Introductory Seminars program,
encouraged IntroSem professors to ac-credit their classes under the WAYS criteria.
Though there was an overall increase in the
number of Introductory Seminars (IntroSems)
offered this year - , the number of applications for
and enrollments in fall quarter seminar's stayed
relatively the same as last year, according to
Russell Berman, faculty director of the Stan
ford Introductory Seminar's (SIS) program.
This year, 257 classes are available over the
course of three quarters more than the 221
classes offered last year some of which are
also eligible to fulfill the new Ways of Think
ing/Ways of Doing breadth requirement.
Some fall quarter seminars attracted ex
traordinary application volume, making entry
more difficult.
"These very popular' courses sometimes cre
ate a problem for the program insofar as stu
dents apply for these and nine out of 10 are go
ing to get turned down," Berman said. "Some
times students only apply to those courses that
have strong enrollments, and then they get
turned down multiple times."
Berman noted several courses from all disci
plines with competitive entries this quarter,
including ME26N: Think Like A Designer,
taught by Shilajeet Banerjee M.S. 'OO, associ
ate professor of mechanical engineering at
the d.school; Psychology Professor Carol
Dweck's PSYCHI2N: Self Theories; and

ECON26N: Who gets what? The New Eco
nomics of Matchmaking and Market Design,
taught by Alvin Roth M.A. '73 Ph.D. '74, a
professor of economics who won the 2012 No
bel Prize in Economic Sciences.
The professors who had to review hundreds of
applications to their popular classes developed
their own acceptance policies. Roth specifically
asked his prospective students to write about
something they had experienced related to the
course's subject matter.
"I chose students who wrote about something
interesting," Roth said.
Dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences Richard Sailer, who teaches CLASSHIS
24N: The Roman Empire: Its Grandeur and Its
FhU, went through a similar screening process,
taking only students who "seemed to have a real
reason for taking the course."
Both Sailer's and Roth's courses are among
the few that fulfill the Social Inquiry WAYS grad
uation requirement.
"We are encouraging all of the seminar faculty
to explore whether their course could be certified
to meet one or the other of the WAYS," Berman
said, adding that the Ways of Thinking Ways of
Doing requirements may impact students' course
selections down the road.
WAYS accreditation for classes is reviewed by
the Breadth Governance Board, which is chaired
by Chris Edwards, a professor of mechanical en

gineering. Despite the efforts made by SIS, not all
IntroSem professors went through the process
that would potentially allow their class to fulfill
a WAYS requirement.
"This is, in a sense, similar to what prevailed
under the old GER regime," Berman said. "We
would encourage faculty to get GER accredita
tion for then* courses, and many would, some
wouldn't. These are courses about which facul
ty are very passionate and they want to struc
ture them in then* particular ways."
Regardless of the requirements, students
and professors alike have continued to enjoy
the IntroSem experience.
"I think [the IntroSem Program] is quite ef
fective," Sailer said. "And that's because I think
that learning is most effective when there's a lot
of exchange between students and between stu
dents and faculty, and I think having a small
group of students encourages that."
Although certain courses will most likely re
ceive many applications, Berman said stu
dents should not necessarily worry if they are
not accepted, and he encouraged students to
show up to their desired class on the first day.
"If there's space available, they may luck
out," Berman said.
IntroSem applications for Winter Quarter
seminars are due Nov. 11.
