### ELIZABETH DAVIS 
In front of over a hundred
students gathered in Cub
berley Auditorium Monday
evening, Julian Castro '96,
current mayor of San Anto
nio, discussed how his life at
Stanford prepared him for
the political world and pro
vided advice on how to make
a difference through public
service.
"Getting a great educa
tion [at Stanford] prepared
me to understand complex
issues, and studying with a
diverse student population
helped prepare me for lead

ing a diverse community,"
Castro said. "From Stanford,
I got a sense of what's possi
ble and a confidence about
achieving my dreams."
A political science and
communication major, Cas
tro and his twin brother
Joaquin Castro '96 cur
rently a San Antonio con
gressman both ran for
ASSU Senate while at Stan
ford. The brothers tied for
first place in the election, re
ceiving exactly 811 votes
each. Julian Castro then
went on to attend Harvard
Law School, and later won
another political election
this time as the youngest
mayor of San Antonio
with his campaign focusing
on education initiatives.
"I have felt very blessed
to get to attend Stanford and
Harvard, and a primary goal
of mine is to help extend that
opportunity to all young peo
ple in San Antonio," Castro
said. "And that was my moti
vation for focusing on im
proving education in our
city."
Castro went on to discuss
his major accomplishments
in education including his
biggest capital investment:
Cafe College, a resource cen
ter that is designed to help
San Antonio students pursue
higher education by offering

free advice on college admis
sion and financial aid, as well
as test preparation for the
SAT.
Castro's greatest opera
tional investment was in Pre-
K 4 SA, a program that will
provide pre-kindergarten
services to thousands of four
year-old children annually.
Though Castro does not
have definitive plans for his
political future yet, he in
tends to serve out his term in
San Antonio and continue to
make an impact through
community-based education
al programs. He is also con
sidering running for another
public office.
Castro advised students
to simply follow their pas
sions and understand that
meaningful impact on society
can be achieved through the
private sector, such as
through entrepreneurial en
terprises.
When asked about what
students should do prior to
running for public office,
Castro said "first to under
stand what they believe,
what their fundamental prin
ciples are before they go into
office and to be willing to lis
ten to others and to learn
from them."
