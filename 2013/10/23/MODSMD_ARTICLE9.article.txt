## A
						fitting end to the BCS's reign of terror 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
With last week's fi
nalization of the
College Football
Playoff committee
and all of the con
troversy and mudslinging that fol
lowed, it seems as if much of America
has forgotten that we still have one
year left in the ever pleasing Bowl
Championship Series (BCS) era.
Well, it looks like the football gods
sure haven't forgotten, because this
year is shaping up to be a doozy
This last weekend yielded an incal
culable number of upsets, with many a
team's national championship aspira
tions spinning out faster than the
scoreboard at the Baylor-Oregon
game that every points enthusiast
wants to see. The aftermath of the
carnage yielded just four undefeated
teams rising to the top of the coffee
mug: Alabama, Florida State, Oregon
and Ohio State. The bad news for the
BCS is that all of these teams have
very good chances of going undefeat
ed. As a wise man once said, "Who ya
got?"
Alabama is the reigning two-time
national champion led by AJ McCar
ron, his traitorous (but amazingly
beautiful) Auburn-going girlfriend
and a whole host of first-round picks
on defense. Florida State has its own
trophy quarterback in "Famous"
Jameis Winston and just finished wip
ing the floor with Clemson in the
blowout of the season to date. Oregon
has yet to even be tested this season,
having scored a boatload of points
with the tough part of then- schedule
yet to come. And Ohio State has en
dured, grinding out tough wins to re
main undefeated while weathering in
juries on both sides of the ball.
Looking at each of these teams
and their schedules from now until the
end of the season, there is a distinct
chance that more than two of them
will remain undefeated. At that point,
I picture the entire BCS collapsing
like The Barad-dur at the end of the
Lord of the Rings: violently and
quickly
I know that it is bad form to beat a
dead horse, but why, oh why, can we
not move up the start of the playoff to
this season? There are still two and a
half months to go before the bowl
games need to be finalized and the se
lection committee for the playoff has
already been chosen and vetted.
It seems distinctly likely that this
season will feature a lot more parity
amongst the elite teams than we have
seen in the past. On a neutral field, I
have no idea who I would pick to win
because all of these teams pair incred
ible strengths with evident flaws. That
is part of what makes this sport so en
ticing, and part of why the playoff sys
tem is perfect for a year like this one.
I would kill to see those four teams
play each other and settle the debate
on the field. More than just being fair,
this would make for highly entertain
ing football. Enough said.
In 2004, USC and Oklahoma met
in the BCS National Championship
Game (or didn't, depending on which
revisionist view of history you sub
scribe to in the post-Reggie Bush
scandal era), leaving undefeated Utah
and undefeated Auburn in the lurch.
After a ho-hum national champi
onship game in which USC plastered
Heisman trophy winner Jason White
in a 55-19 rout, both Auburn and
Utah, which had won then' respective
bowl games, felt (rightfully) peeved
that they were not given the chance to
prove then- merits on the football field
thanks to the evil BCS formula. This
season has all the smatterings of a
similar outcome, but to me, nothing
would give me more pleasure than
seeing the BCS fail one last time be
fore riding off into the sunset.
There is one excellent thing, how
ever, that has come out of the BCS: It
has proven to be wonderful fodder for
columnists such as myself to write
about. It's almost as easy as taking
candy from a baby.
So in away, I will be sad to see the
BCS go. It might go gently into the
night, ruffling no feathers and exiting
stage left with nary a fuss. Or this sea
son could end in the BCS apocalypse,
ushering in the playoff era with the
biggest of all "I told you so!" mo
ments.

Boy, the rest of this college football
season is going to be fun. Your move,
BCS.

Some men like Vignesh Venkatara
man just want to watch the world
burn. In his ideal BCS apocalypse,
Viggy has undefeated Fresno State
fating undefeated Northern Illinois in
the championship. Tell him off spec
