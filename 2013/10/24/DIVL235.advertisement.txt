Stanford Continuing Studies presents
An Evening with Fusion Vocalist
Hamed Nikpay and Ensemble
Friday, October 25
8:00 pm
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Stanford University
Free and open to the public
Stanford Continuing Studies is pleased to welcome Hamed
Nikpay and his ensemble back to campus for a majestic evening
of music. At the forefront of experimental music, Nikpay has
a passion for his innovative genre that is embedded in his solid
knowledge of the fundamentals of Persian music, his ability to
perform on numerous Eastern instruments, and his incisive
interpretation and selection of Persian poetry for his songs.
Having learned how to sing at a very young age, he also studied
with some of the masters of classical Persian music.
His love of Persian music motivated him to learn and play many
musical instruments revered in the culture â€”tar, setar, tanbour,
oud, and daf, all of which he plays expertly and soulfully.
Nikpay has also performed as a fusion vocalist, and has
produced four albums: Solo Passage, All Is Calm, Spellbound
and most recently, Reaching You.
