# FOOTBALL NOTES
## ON THE LOOKOUT FOR NO. 7 DEFENSE PREPS FOR UP-TEMPO BEAVER OFFENSE 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford football head coach David Shaw's
first remarks following Tuesday's practice reit
erated his comments earlier in the day when he
expressed his admiration for Oregon State wide
receiver Brandin Cooks, who wears the No. 7 for
the Beavers.
"Practice was good today," Shaw said. "The
defense was flying around trying to recognize
where No. 7 is."
Specifically, Shaw noted that the Cardinal
spent a lot of time in practice decision simulating
the unique matchup problems that Cooks, a 5-
foot-10, 186-pound speedster with 1,176 yards
and 12 touchdowns on the season, creates.
To prepare for the up-tempo and athletic Ore
gon State offense, which leads the nation in pass
ing yards, Shaw and his coaching staff decided to
designate multiple players on the scout team as
No. 7, rotating players rapidly to keep the Stan
ford defense on its toes.
"We need more than one [No. 7] because we
need to be full speed on every play," Shaw said.
"We're rotating guys through and trying not to
give our defense too much rest, just to make sure
they feel the speed and urgency with which
[Cooks] runs routes, because he runs routes like
his life depends on them."
In particular, Shaw noted that receivers
Keanu Nelson and Dontonio Jordan, who both
have similar builds to Cooks', have impressed on
the scout team in getting the defense ready for
Saturday. Shaw also noted that he is very pleased
with the rapid progress of Jordan, a sophomore
wideout.
"[Jordan has] probably had his best couple
weeks of practice in the last couple of weeks."
Shaw stated. "He had an outstanding scrimmage
last week. He's coming along."

On the injury front, Shaw shared some posi
tive news regarding cornerback Alex Carter and
wide receiver Devon Cajuste, who both went
down with injuries against UCLA.
Shaw revealed that Carter suffered a bruise
after getting kicked during last Saturday's con
test. The sophomore practiced very well on Tues
day while battling soreness and hopes to be at full
strength by Saturday.
Meanwhile, Cajuste was held out of practice
while he waits for his knee brace to arrive. Earli
er in the day, Shaw disclosed that the junior suf
fered no ligament damage when he injured his
knee against the Bruins. Cajuste is expected to
play against OSU.
Continuing his streak of positive news, Shaw

also announced that senior defensive end Henry
Anderson might be able to return for Stanford's
showdown with Oregon on Nov. 7. Anderson has
now finished all of his "in-house" rehabilitation
and is now working on running full speed outside.
Shaw also expressed confidence that Ander
son will be able to contribute and aid a banged-up
Cardinal defensive line right away based on the
program's previous success in rehabbing players.
"When our guys come back to play, they
come back ready to go," Shaw said. "We'll still
probably rotate [Anderson] to make sure he
gets his wind back, but when our guys are
cleared they're ready to come play."

Saturday's trip to Corvallis also marks the
first road game for the Cardinal since its loss at

Utah on Oct. 12. To prepare for the game against
the No. 25 ranked Beavers, Shaw plans to men
tion the Utah game frequently to keep his play
ers focused.
"When you go through something tough, the
worst thing you can do is forget about it," Shaw
said. "You have to learn your lessons and bring
those lessons forward. We got outplayed... and
we have to make sure that doesn't happen
again."
The Cardinal will try to avoid another upset
on the road when it travels to Oregon State this
Saturday. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. and
the game will be televised on ESPN.

in the coming weeks. Anderson has been sidelined since suffering a knee injury against Army.
Stanford football head coach David Shaw's
first remarks following Tuesday's practice reit
erated his comments earlier in the day when he
expressed his admiration for Oregon State wide
receiver Brandin Cooks, who wears the No. 7 for
the Beavers.
"Practice was good today," Shaw said. "The
defense was flying around trying to recognize
where No. 7 is."
Specifically, Shaw noted that the Cardinal
spent a lot of time in practice decision simulating
the unique matchup problems that Cooks, a 5-
foot-10, 186-pound speedster with 1,176 yards
and 12 touchdowns on the season, creates.
To prepare for the up-tempo and athletic Ore
gon State offense, which leads the nation in pass
ing yards, Shaw and his coaching staff decided to
designate multiple players on the scout team as
No. 7, rotating players rapidly to keep the Stan
ford defense on its toes.
"We need more than one [No. 7] because we
need to be full speed on every play," Shaw said.
"We're rotating guys through and trying not to
give our defense too much rest, just to make sure
they feel the speed and urgency with which
[Cooks] runs routes, because he runs routes like
his life depends on them."
In particular, Shaw noted that receivers
Keanu Nelson and Dontonio Jordan, who both
have similar builds to Cooks', have impressed on
the scout team in getting the defense ready for
Saturday. Shaw also noted that he is very pleased
with the rapid progress of Jordan, a sophomore
wideout.
"[Jordan has] probably had his best couple
weeks of practice in the last couple of weeks."
Shaw stated. "He had an outstanding scrimmage
last week. He's coming along."

On the injury front, Shaw shared some posi
tive news regarding cornerback Alex Carter and
wide receiver Devon Cajuste, who both went
down with injuries against UCLA.
Shaw revealed that Carter suffered a bruise
after getting kicked during last Saturday's con
test. The sophomore practiced very well on Tues
day while battling soreness and hopes to be at full
strength by Saturday.
Meanwhile, Cajuste was held out of practice
while he waits for his knee brace to arrive. Earli
er in the day, Shaw disclosed that the junior suf
fered no ligament damage when he injured his
knee against the Bruins. Cajuste is expected to
play against OSU.
Continuing his streak of positive news, Shaw

also announced that senior defensive end Henry
Anderson might be able to return for Stanford's
showdown with Oregon on Nov. 7. Anderson has
now finished all of his "in-house" rehabilitation
and is now working on running full speed outside.
Shaw also expressed confidence that Ander
son will be able to contribute and aid a banged-up
Cardinal defensive line right away based on the
program's previous success in rehabbing players.
"When our guys come back to play, they
come back ready to go," Shaw said. "We'll still
probably rotate [Anderson] to make sure he
gets his wind back, but when our guys are
cleared they're ready to come play."

Saturday's trip to Corvallis also marks the
first road game for the Cardinal since its loss at

Utah on Oct. 12. To prepare for the game against
the No. 25 ranked Beavers, Shaw plans to men
tion the Utah game frequently to keep his play
ers focused.
"When you go through something tough, the
worst thing you can do is forget about it," Shaw
said. "You have to learn your lessons and bring
those lessons forward. We got outplayed... and
we have to make sure that doesn't happen
again."
The Cardinal will try to avoid another upset
on the road when it travels to Oregon State this
Saturday. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. and
the game will be televised on ESPN.
