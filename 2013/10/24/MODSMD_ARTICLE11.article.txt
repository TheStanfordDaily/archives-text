# HOME-COURSE ADVANTAGE
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Playing at home can have its advantages, espe
cially in collegiate golf. For one, there is no tiresome
travel or learning on the fly during practice rounds.
Competing on home turf affords the player more
confidence: She knows what to expect because she's
had this exact shot or that lie many times before.
However, oddly enough, playing at home can al
so be disrupting to routines. Some athletes may get
complacent and not prepare themselves as much as
they would prior to a road event. In addition, having
so many familiar faces in the gallery at home tour
naments can be detrimental.
The Stanford women's golf team will try to play
the role of dominant instead of uninspired
hosts this weekend at the Stanford Intercollegiate

and continue the strong play it exhibited at the
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational.
For the Cardinal, which comes into the event
ranked No. 3 nationally, it will be the first home
tournament since last May's NCAA West Regional.
The squad finished fifth and advanced to the NCAA
Finals then. Prior to that, Stanford dominated the
Peg Barnard Invitational at its home course in Feb
ruary. And after finishing third at the Stanford In
tercollegiate last year, the Cardinal will certainly be
looking to reign supreme over the scheduled 54
holes against a very strong field that contains four
of the nation's top-five teams and six other top-25
squads.
The defending NCAA champions, USC also
the winner at this event in 2012 will give Stanford
