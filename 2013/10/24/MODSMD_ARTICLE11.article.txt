# HOME-COURSE ADVANTAGE
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Playing at home can have its advantages, espe
cially in collegiate golf. For one, there is no tiresome
travel or learning on the fly during practice rounds.
Competing on home turf affords the player more
confidence: She knows what to expect because she's
had this exact shot or that lie many times before.
However, oddly enough, playing at home can al
so be disrupting to routines. Some athletes may get
complacent and not prepare themselves as much as
they would prior to a road event. In addition, having
so many familiar faces in the gallery at home tour
naments can be detrimental.
The Stanford women's golf team will try to play
the role of dominant instead of uninspired
hosts this weekend at the Stanford Intercollegiate

and continue the strong play it exhibited at the
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational.
For the Cardinal, which comes into the event
ranked No. 3 nationally, it will be the first home
tournament since last May's NCAA West Regional.
The squad finished fifth and advanced to the NCAA
Finals then. Prior to that, Stanford dominated the
Peg Barnard Invitational at its home course in Feb
ruary. And after finishing third at the Stanford In
tercollegiate last year, the Cardinal will certainly be
looking to reign supreme over the scheduled 54
holes against a very strong field that contains four
of the nation's top-five teams and six other top-25
squads.

everything it can handle, as
will the top-ranked Bruins
and No. 6 Washington. But
the group, led by sophomore
Mariah Staekhouse, feels its
meticulous preparation and
course knowledge will put it
over the top.
"The Stanford Golf
Course requires a lot of pa
tience," said Staekhouse, one
of the nation's best young
golfers. "There are certain
holes that I look at as birdie
opportunities, and others
that I've learned to play safe
by avoiding risky areas. It's
a mentally challenging
course with very tough fin
ishing holes, but it's relative
ly tight and that fits my
eye."
While Staekhouse is the
most recent champion of the
group after her individual
win at Edean Ihlanfeldt, fel
low sophomore Lauren Kim
and junior Mariko Tuman
gan have also lead the Cardi
nal at different points in the
young season. And with the
continued development of
freshmen Casey Danielson
and Quirine Eijkenboom,
Stanford's squad looks
strong, despite the loss of
seasoned veteran Sally Wat
son 'l3.
"The best teams in the
country have deep rosters, it
is what separates the good
teams from the great
teams," said head coach
Anne Walker. "Although we
have seen strong showings
from Lauren, Mariko and

Mariah, I believe that in the
course of the year we will al
so see our freshman step up
and lead us in a tournament
or two. We have strong play
ers this year from top to bot
tom and we are looking for
ward to seeing them all in
action this weekend."
Not only will the Stan
ford coaching staff be eager
to see how its players com
pete this weekend, so will
many from the community.
The team's high ranking and
forecasted temperatures in
the high 70s should swell the
galleries, especially those
following local product Lau
ren Kim. Despite the extra
sets of eyes trained on her,
the sophomore hailing from
nearby Los Altos doesn't
feel like the added attention
will be negative.
"I absolutely love playing
at home because we have
such a supportive communi
ty," Kim said. "Being local, it
is easy for many of my
friends and family to come
watch. I feed off of their en
ergy and their wanting us to
succeed. When I make
birdies and hear clapping
and support from family and
friends, it reminds me of all
the endless support we get."
Stanford is hoping the
big turnout will translate in
to an even bigger win over
nine conference opponents.
The tournament, hosted by
former Secretary of State
and strong Stanford Athlet
ics supporter Condoleezza
Rice, begins Friday morning
with play concluding Sun
day

The Stanford women's golf team will try to play
the role of dominant instead of uninspired

tournament since last May's NCAA West Regional.
The squad finished fifth and advanced to the NCAA

everything it can handle, as
will the top-ranked Bruins
and No. 6 Washington. But
the group, led by sophomore
Mariah Staekhouse, feels its
meticulous preparation and
course knowledge will put it
over the top.
"The Stanford Golf
Course requires a lot of pa
tience," said Staekhouse, one
of the nation's best young
golfers. "There are certain
holes that I look at as birdie
opportunities, and others
that I've learned to play safe
by avoiding risky areas. It's
a mentally challenging
course with very tough fin
ishing holes, but it's relative
ly tight and that fits my
eye."
While Staekhouse is the
most recent champion of the
group after her individual
win at Edean Ihlanfeldt, fel
low sophomore Lauren Kim
and junior Mariko Tuman
gan have also lead the Cardi
nal at different points in the
young season. And with the
continued development of
freshmen Casey Danielson
and Quirine Eijkenboom,
Stanford's squad looks
strong, despite the loss of
seasoned veteran Sally Wat
son 'l3.
"The best teams in the
country have deep rosters, it
is what separates the good
teams from the great
teams," said head coach
Anne Walker. "Although we
have seen strong showings
from Lauren, Mariko and

Mariah, I believe that in the
course of the year we will al
so see our freshman step up
and lead us in a tournament
or two. We have strong play
ers this year from top to bot
tom and we are looking for
ward to seeing them all in
action this weekend."
Not only will the Stan
ford coaching staff be eager
to see how its players com
pete this weekend, so will
many from the community.
The team's high ranking and
forecasted temperatures in
the high 70s should swell the
galleries, especially those
following local product Lau
ren Kim. Despite the extra
sets of eyes trained on her,
the sophomore hailing from
nearby Los Altos doesn't
feel like the added attention
will be negative.
"I absolutely love playing
at home because we have
such a supportive communi
ty," Kim said. "Being local, it
is easy for many of my
friends and family to come
watch. I feed off of their en
ergy and their wanting us to
succeed. When I make
birdies and hear clapping
and support from family and
friends, it reminds me of all
the endless support we get."
Stanford is hoping the
big turnout will translate in
to an even bigger win over
nine conference opponents.
The tournament, hosted by

Rice, begins Friday morning
with play concluding Sun

Playing at home can have its advantages, espe
cially in collegiate golf. For one, there is no tiresome
travel or learning on the fly during practice rounds.
Competing on home turf affords the player more
confidence: She knows what to expect because she's
had this exact shot or that lie many times before.
