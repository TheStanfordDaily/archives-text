## Card leaves Ducks in the dust 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 6 Stanford women's volley
ball won its 23rd consecutive home
match last night as it beat No. 20
Oregon in a three-set shutout, 25-
22, 25-13, 25-22.

In the first set both teams went
on their own runs to share the lead
multiple times. Stanford finished
with all of the momentum, however,
and, in the end, finished with the
run that would take the set 25-22.
The second set began much the
same as the first with neither team
ahead by more than two points un
til Stanford went on a 4-0 run, gain
ing confidence from an ace by soph
omore setter Madi Bugg and a kill
by senior middle blocker Carly
Wopat. At that point, Stanford took
the lead 14-10 to force an Oregon
timeout.
Coming out of the timeout,
Stanford continued to pull away.
Two consecutive kills by sophomore
outside hitter Jordan Burgess, fol
lowed by two consecutive blocks by
senior outside hitter Rachel
Williams, gave Stanford a 10-point
lead at 22-12. Oregon was never
able to even come close to recover
ing and the Card won the second
set 25-13.
"Oregon started [the match]
very quickly. They were setting and
sliding and we just couldn't stop it.
