## Card leaves Ducks in the dust 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 6 Stanford women's volley
ball won its 23rd consecutive home
match last night as it beat No. 20
Oregon in a three-set shutout, 25-
22, 25-13, 25-22.

In the first set both teams went
on their own runs to share the lead
multiple times. Stanford finished
with all of the momentum, however,
and, in the end, finished with the
run that would take the set 25-22.
The second set began much the
same as the first with neither team
ahead by more than two points un
til Stanford went on a 4-0 run, gain
ing confidence from an ace by soph
omore setter Madi Bugg and a kill
by senior middle blocker Carly
Wopat. At that point, Stanford took
the lead 14-10 to force an Oregon
timeout.
Coming out of the timeout,
Stanford continued to pull away.
Two consecutive kills by sophomore
outside hitter Jordan Burgess, fol
lowed by two consecutive blocks by
senior outside hitter Rachel
Williams, gave Stanford a 10-point
lead at 22-12. Oregon was never
able to even come close to recover
ing and the Card won the second
set 25-13.
"Oregon started [the match]
very quickly. They were setting and
sliding and we just couldn't stop it.

They were passing perfectly," Stan
ford head coach John Dunning said
after the second set. "We stopped
right there and fought back and I
thought we played really steady af
ter that. A key for us is we have to
be tough when we get to those mo
ments when we have to play."
The Card managed to contain
the Ducks' best hitter, middle block
er Ariana Williams, to just a .167
hitting percentage. The senior came
into the match hitting .393, good
enough for fourth in Pac-12 and
33rd in the nation.
Stanford earned the first point
of the third set but the Card and the
Ducks traded points thereafter. The
Ducks kept it close despite Stanford
having a far superior hitting per
centage at .364 compared to Ore
gon's .117 when the set was tied at
11. Stanford never led by more than
four points in the set and didn't get
that lead until the score was 16-12.
The Card again managed to
stretch the lead to four at 22-18. Af
ter the second match point, with the
Card only up by two, Stanford called
a timeout. Wopat took control and
recorded the final kill of the match to
give the Card the 25-22 victory.
After suffering a loss to Wash
ington last weekend in a grueling,
two-hour-plus match, the Card was
able to bounce back with a relative
ly quick win over the ranked Ducks.
Stanford will look to draw on this
momentum from last night in Fri
day's match up with Oregon State.
The Cardinal welcomes Oregon
State to Maples Pavilion Friday at 7
p.m.
