## DO-GOODER The 						Missing Link 
### Elizabeth Woodson 
W'hat matters to you and
why? This is our newest ad
missions question, the gate
keeper to Stanford's privileged
world and a testament to this insti
tution's desire to attract and sup
port motivated students who posses
sincere passions.
Presumably, successful answers
involve stories of personal discovery,
empathy for others, care about a
specific challenge and how that indi
vidual has or plans to solve it.
What really does matter to us,
current Stanford students? The Pew
Research Center's survey of the
millennial generation demonstrated
that we care about social impact, in
some form or another.
Fifty-seven percent of 18-29 year
olds have volunteered in the last 12
months. Twenty-one percent say
"helping other people who are in
need" is one of the most important
things in their lives, and 60 percent
say it is among the most important.
Sixty-six percent say it is likely that
they will switch careers sometime in
their work lives. Fifteen percent pri
oritize having a high-paying career.
Regardless of what we say mat
ters to us, whether in a Stanford ap
plication or a research study, ulti
mately our job placements are not
aligning with our stated priorities. A
recent article by Nobel laureate
Robert Shiller noted this phenome
non and reiterated statistics to this
end, most notably at Princeton
where 46 percent of them 2006 grad
uating class entered jobs in financial
services.
I am, of course, not the first to be
asking the question of why there ex
ists such a drastic disconnect be
tween millennials who want to cre
ate positive impact in their careers
and the organizations that severely
need their talent to successfully cre
ate change; nor is this a question
that is constricted to just one institu
tion.
In February 2012, professor
Robert Reich posted a question on
Facebook to Stanford students and
recent grads: "Why do so many stu
dents enter finance or management
consulting?" The responding 58
comments highlighted that this was
a heated debate with many opinions
and little supporting research to
back it up or provide answers, and
there was confusion as to how
earnest students could sincerely
pursue work in a sector that created
social impact.
That is why Stanford alumni
Jonny Dorsey 'O9 and Fagan Harris
'O9 founded the Impact Careers Ini
tiative (ICI) at the Aspen Institute
in June 2012. It was clear that both
the desire of young people to serve
and the need of organizations for
their talents are high ... but where is
the connection?
Today it does not exist. Want to
be an investment banker? A consult
ant? There is a pathway you can fol
low. I believe that if that is what you
want to do, you should act on that
desire. But if it isn't, prepare your
self.
Getting a social impact career is
a hard fight. Just a few barriers not
ed by the ICI research are the fact
that visualizing a social impact ca-

reer path is difficult because we lack
archetypes, on-campus recruiting is
almost nonexistent and respect for
social impact jobs is far below those
in the private sector. Bottom line?
The connection is not there and find
ing a meaningful job opportunity
will be an uphill battle.
This is why I took issue with
Kevin Carey's recent article in the
Chronicle of Higher Education. I
agree that when freshmen arrive at
Stanford and sit in the Main Quad
listening to praising convocation
speeches, they do not deserve to be
here.
Carey cleverly reminded us that
the word deserve derives from the
Latin "de," which translates to
"completely" and "servire," which
translates to "to serve", and they
have not yet served adequately to be
honored with the use of that word.
But are they being given the
chance to? When they leave Palm
Drive after graduation to begin
their first job, have they been sup
ported adequately to fulfill whatever
passion they said mattered to them
on their Stanford application essay?
I think my opinion on this ques
tion is clear: They are not... yet.
We have an exciting opportunity
right now Farouk Dey of the Ca
reer Development Center and Tom
Schnaubelt of the Haas Center un
derstand this challenge and want to
build a successful connector be
tween Stanford's talent and jobs of
positive social impact.
Over the past two weeks, 74 stu
dents attended three lunch discus
sions on social impact careers to de
sign the ideal process for finding the
jobs they seek.
President Hennessy's column in
the most recent issue of the Stan
ford Magazine, "Doing Well by Go
ing Good," is another testament to
the fact that supporting students'
energies to create positive impact is
a current priority.
By the time I graduate in June of
2015,1 am excited to be one of a sig
nificant percentage of my class
mates heading to jobs that will em
power us to connect our interests
and talents to creating positive so
cial impact in the world.
We will be able to look back on
our "What Matters Most" essay, and
instead of being unrecognizable with
our current passions and aims, the
two will match. And when we return
to campus for reunions, we will be
able to feel that we do, in fact, de
serve to be here.

President Hennessy's column in

By the time I graduate in June of
2015,1 am excited to be one of a sig
nificant percentage of my class
mates heading to jobs that will em
power us to connect our interests
and talents to creating positive so

We will be able to look back on
our "What Matters Most" essay, and
instead of being unrecognizable with
our current passions and aims, the
two will match. And when we return

able to feel that we do, in fact, de
serve to be here.

Getting a
social impact
career is a
hard fight.
W'hat matters to you and
why? This is our newest ad
missions question, the gate
keeper to Stanford's privileged
world and a testament to this insti
tution's desire to attract and sup
port motivated students who posses
sincere passions.
Presumably, successful answers
involve stories of personal discovery,
empathy for others, care about a
specific challenge and how that indi
vidual has or plans to solve it.
What really does matter to us,
current Stanford students? The Pew
Research Center's survey of the
millennial generation demonstrated
that we care about social impact, in
some form or another.
Fifty-seven percent of 18-29 year
olds have volunteered in the last 12
months. Twenty-one percent say
"helping other people who are in
need" is one of the most important
things in their lives, and 60 percent
say it is among the most important.
Sixty-six percent say it is likely that
they will switch careers sometime in
their work lives. Fifteen percent pri
oritize having a high-paying career.
Regardless of what we say mat
ters to us, whether in a Stanford ap
plication or a research study, ulti
mately our job placements are not
aligning with our stated priorities. A
recent article by Nobel laureate
Robert Shiller noted this phenome
non and reiterated statistics to this
end, most notably at Princeton
where 46 percent of them 2006 grad
uating class entered jobs in financial
services.
I am, of course, not the first to be
asking the question of why there ex
ists such a drastic disconnect be
tween millennials who want to cre
ate positive impact in their careers
and the organizations that severely
need their talent to successfully cre
ate change; nor is this a question
that is constricted to just one institu
tion.
In February 2012, professor
Robert Reich posted a question on
Facebook to Stanford students and
recent grads: "Why do so many stu
dents enter finance or management
consulting?" The responding 58
comments highlighted that this was
a heated debate with many opinions
and little supporting research to
back it up or provide answers, and
there was confusion as to how
earnest students could sincerely
pursue work in a sector that created
social impact.
That is why Stanford alumni
Jonny Dorsey 'O9 and Fagan Harris
'O9 founded the Impact Careers Ini
tiative (ICI) at the Aspen Institute
in June 2012. It was clear that both
the desire of young people to serve
and the need of organizations for
their talents are high ... but where is
the connection?
Today it does not exist. Want to
be an investment banker? A consult
ant? There is a pathway you can fol
low. I believe that if that is what you
want to do, you should act on that
desire. But if it isn't, prepare your
self.
Getting a social impact career is
a hard fight. Just a few barriers not
ed by the ICI research are the fact
that visualizing a social impact ca-

reer path is difficult because we lack
archetypes, on-campus recruiting is
almost nonexistent and respect for
social impact jobs is far below those
in the private sector. Bottom line?
The connection is not there and find
ing a meaningful job opportunity
will be an uphill battle.
This is why I took issue with
Kevin Carey's recent article in the
Chronicle of Higher Education. I
agree that when freshmen arrive at
Stanford and sit in the Main Quad
listening to praising convocation
speeches, they do not deserve to be
here.
Carey cleverly reminded us that
the word deserve derives from the
Latin "de," which translates to
"completely" and "servire," which
translates to "to serve", and they
have not yet served adequately to be
honored with the use of that word.
But are they being given the
chance to? When they leave Palm
Drive after graduation to begin
their first job, have they been sup
ported adequately to fulfill whatever
passion they said mattered to them
on their Stanford application essay?
I think my opinion on this ques
tion is clear: They are not... yet.
We have an exciting opportunity
right now Farouk Dey of the Ca
reer Development Center and Tom
Schnaubelt of the Haas Center un
derstand this challenge and want to
build a successful connector be
tween Stanford's talent and jobs of
positive social impact.
Over the past two weeks, 74 stu
dents attended three lunch discus
sions on social impact careers to de
sign the ideal process for finding the
jobs they seek.
