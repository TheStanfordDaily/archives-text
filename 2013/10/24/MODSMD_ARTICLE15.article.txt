# Smartphones and Networked Individualism
## 
### Chi Ling Chan 
Call me a dinosaur, if you must. I
have never owned a smart
phone, and I still carry one of
those old Nokia models that lets me
text, call and nothing more.
"Why don't you just get a smart
phone so I can get hold of you any
time?" friends have frequently en
treated. Even my parents have been,
with all the best intentions, trying to
lure me into their Whatsapp conver
sations.
Perhaps that makes me a less
than-ideal friend and daughter, but
really, I don't want to be contactable
at every instant, or ever-present in
the virtual world.
On some levels it is impossible to
dispute that having the Internet on
your palm affords a number of con
veniences. We now marvel at how we
lived life before we had Google Maps,

Facebook and the World Wide Web in
our hands, and we feel we are em
powered by our possession of these
myriad resources. Can we really do
without a smartphone today, we the
hyper-connected generation?
It's not obvious that we can: we
sleep with our phones, and take no
ease unless we know where it is. We
hold onto them like a rosary, reflex
ively thumbing it even as we speak.
We feel our smartphones flicker
ing in the periphery, in the middle of
a lecture. In what seems like a nerv
ous tic we are compelled to look
down on our device every couple
minutes, as if there is always some
thing very important to do or to at
tend to. You see, I'm not sure I will
call being chained to a smartphone
empowering.
I still startle each time I enter an
eerily silent subway with passengers
all hunched over their screens, tap
ping away at Candy Crush, scrolling
down an endless Facebook newsfeed.
What became more troubling was
realizing how family gatherings have
become technology parties where
both adults and children sit in the
same living room, eyes glued to their
devices. Or at dinner parties, where
people could be physically there, but
with their heads in the technological
cloud except during the occasional
clinking of glasses. We can be so
alone together these days.
Sociologists say we are living in
an age of networked individualism
people are not hooked on gadgets,
they argue, people are just hooked
on each other.
We are increasingly networked as
individuals in loose, fragmented net
works providing on-demand succor,
rather than embedded in tight-knit
ted groups. We can choose who we
want to interact with over the net
work, and overcome physical con
straints of the social environment we
grow up in.
In the past people lived in vil
lages, today we live in cities and to
morrow we live in huge server farms
we call "the cloud". For many of us
and you, reader, if you are reading
this presently on your smartphone or
laptop tomorrow is already here.
There is a general sense that this
represents some sort of freedom that
we have never had. But for all the
semblance of freedom we have
gained, I can't help wondering what
we might have lost.
How much of our lives are we se
cluding away as we divide our atten
tion between the interminable notifi

cations, emails and social posts that
aren't really that pressing? Is Candy
Crash really that much more re
warding than, say, a serendipitous
conversation with a random stranger
you meet on the train? Or reading a
book, for that matter? Yes, I forgot to
mention how smartphones have also
taken the book away from people
these days.
More so than that, I think we
have adopted a new lifestyle without
giving enough thought to what it
means to be constantly sharing as
pects of our lives on our thin simu
lacrams online. Do radical sharing,
openness and personal transparency
make us happier, or more lonely and
divided?
Is social networking, which
smartphones have made enticingly
easy, really creating more authentic
identities, or entrapping us in a hive
mind where groupthink leads to the
cult of the amateur and an amnesia of
the self? And what about the massive
amounts of personal data and digital
footprints we leave behind in the
public-by-default, private-through
effort Internet culture we live in?
Clearly these are not easy ques
tions to answer, and I imagine it
wouldn't be a simple choice between
having a smartphone or a dumb
phone.
In fact, even the choice to stay
out of the virtual network is increas
ingly an illusion as maintaining an
online presence is normalized to the
point that not participating makes
you unusual, even suspicious.
What surprises me, though, is
how rarely we even ask these ques
tions before we adopt a lifestyle of
hyper-connectivity.
I might be getting a little nostalgic
here, but I do miss the days when
serendipitous interactions occur in the
real not virtualâ€”world: random
discussions over a book a fellow com
muter is reading, or the nod of recog
nition from someone noticing that we
were wearing the same T-shirt.
And more so than that, I miss a
time when it had been easier for
everyone to be fully present at a get
together, enjoying each other's com
pany without the distractions of a
flicker or buzz on their phones.
At least for now, I am quite con
tented with my old Nokia, and am
holding out on getting a smartphone.
So, leave me a message after the
tone, and I promise to call you back.
