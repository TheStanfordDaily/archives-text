# BOSP to launch new program in Istanbul
## 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
The Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram (BOSP), in partnership with
Kog University, is planning a new
winter quarter program in Istan
bul, Turkey.
Scheduled to launch in January
2015, the program will include
courses from a range of fields and
may even offer students the chance
to room with Turkish students who
attend Kog University.
According to Irene Kennedy, as
sociate vice provost and executive
director of BOSI? there has been a
considerable amount of student de
mand for a program in the Middle
East, with 155 applications re
ceived for the 15 spots in the 2012
summer Overseas Seminar in Is
tanbul.
Kog University will provide
classrooms, housing, field trips and
cultural programs for Stanford stu
dents in the new winter program.
According to Kennedy, the partner
ship came about through a connec
tion with Kog University president,
Umran Inan Ph.D. '77, a Stanford
professor emeritus of electrical en

gmeenng.
Kennedy said this partnership
program is the beginning of a trend
in BOSP initiatives.
"It is a different model for us in
that we are partnering with anoth
er university, and we are not build
ing the infrastructure that we nor
mally build when we open up a cen
ter," she said. "I think you'll see
more flexible programs."
Ramon Saldivar, director of
BOSIJ explained that the winter
program is part of a larger effort to
balance the availability of study
abroad offerings throughout the
year.
"The hope is that Istanbul will
be successful and popular and we
will expand to other quarters, but
for now we thought that this was a
quarter that fit well for Kog and for
us as well," Saldivar said.
According to Inan, a big chal
lenge so far has been trying to inte
grate the quarter-long program in
to Kog University's semester sys
tem.
"We had to work hard at this be
cause, I think, obviously the semes
ter and quarter systems may ap
pear to be incompatible," he said.

However, despite these chal
lenges, he expects the students to
feel comfortable with the program.
Inan said the environment the
Turkish students are in is similar to
that of Stanford because 90 percent
of the faculty obtained their Ph.D.

from an American university.
"But [it is] very different at the
same time," Inan said. "So there's a
comfort of knowing that your feet
are on the ground, but you are also
so close to incredible diversity in
terms of culture and history."

Inan and BOSP administrators
share high hopes for the new pro
gram.
"I'm hoping basically that the
program will not only attract stu
dents, but will attract much more
student numbers than we are ini
tially expecting, so we may even
have to do this in the fall quarter,"
he said.
Meanwhile, BOSP is currently
working with faculty at Kog to de
velop curriculum. According to
Kennedy, the biggest challenge is
selecting which courses will be
taught as well as the disciplines
that the courses will fall under.
Saldivar added that the courses
offered would be from a variety of
fields.
"We're looking to have an excit
ing, interesting and challenging set
of courses that really cover the
broad spectrum that Stanford stu
dents are used to," he said.
In early November, Saldivar will
meet with a committee of Stanford
faculty interested in the program to
discuss potential course offerings.
