## Employees offered new health plan Stanford provides new low-cost healthcare amid rising costs 
### DANIA MARINSHAW 
Amid concerns over rising health
care costs, Stanford recently launched
a new, low-cost healthcare option for
its employees and their dependents
with an extended open enrollment date
until Nov. 19.
Stanford Health Care Alliance
(SHCA) connects employees and their
dependents with a network of physi
cians from Stanford Hospital & Clin
ics, Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal and other local providers.
While employees who choose the
SHCA plan will be required to select a
primary care physician from over 300
primary care providers, they will also
have access to 2,300 specialists across
the Bay Area, according to informa
tion available on the SHPA website.
The chosen primary care physician
will coordinate the care throughout
the greater network.
According to Neal Evans, director
of Health and Welfare Programs for
University Human Resources, the new
healthcare plan is priced similarly to
the Kaiser Permanente HMO plan,
which was previously the cheapest op
tion for Stanford employees. Now,
both SHCA and the Kaiser HMO pro
vide free, employee-only coverage.
To allow for this free coverage, the
University will pay a semi-monthly
contribution of $290.74 to Stanford
Hospital & Clinics. Employees whose
family members share a plan will be
required to contribute an additional,
semi-monthly payment, though it
would still be less than what they
would have to pay under the other
three current options.
"Cost was really becoming an issue
for [Stanford] employees," Evans said.
"The arrangement is really premised
on delivering efficient, high-quality
care at a reasonable price."
James Larkin, director of Corpo
rate Communications & Public Rela
tions for Stanford Hospital & Clinics,
predicts that SHCA's emphasis on cus
tomer service and user accessibility
will attract many Stanford employees
to the new plan in addition to reducing
the price tag.
One such benefit is that each pa
tient will be assigned a member care
specialist who will help patients coor
dinate all of their individual medical
plans. For example, Larkin said that if
an employee is newly diagnosed with
diabetes, he or she might need to see a
