## Employees offered new health plan Stanford provides new low-cost healthcare amid rising costs 
### DANIA MARINSHAW 
Amid concerns over rising health
care costs, Stanford recently launched
a new, low-cost healthcare option for
its employees and their dependents
with an extended open enrollment date
until Nov. 19.
Stanford Health Care Alliance
(SHCA) connects employees and their
dependents with a network of physi
cians from Stanford Hospital & Clin
ics, Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal and other local providers.
While employees who choose the
SHCA plan will be required to select a
primary care physician from over 300
primary care providers, they will also
have access to 2,300 specialists across
the Bay Area, according to informa
tion available on the SHPA website.
The chosen primary care physician
will coordinate the care throughout
the greater network.
According to Neal Evans, director
of Health and Welfare Programs for
University Human Resources, the new
healthcare plan is priced similarly to
the Kaiser Permanente HMO plan,
which was previously the cheapest op
tion for Stanford employees. Now,
both SHCA and the Kaiser HMO pro
vide free, employee-only coverage.
To allow for this free coverage, the
University will pay a semi-monthly
contribution of $290.74 to Stanford
Hospital & Clinics. Employees whose
family members share a plan will be
required to contribute an additional,
semi-monthly payment, though it
would still be less than what they
would have to pay under the other
three current options.
"Cost was really becoming an issue
for [Stanford] employees," Evans said.
"The arrangement is really premised
on delivering efficient, high-quality
care at a reasonable price."
James Larkin, director of Corpo
rate Communications & Public Rela
tions for Stanford Hospital & Clinics,
predicts that SHCA's emphasis on cus
tomer service and user accessibility
will attract many Stanford employees
to the new plan in addition to reducing
the price tag.
One such benefit is that each pa
tient will be assigned a member care
specialist who will help patients coor
dinate all of their individual medical
plans. For example, Larkin said that if
an employee is newly diagnosed with
diabetes, he or she might need to see a
specialist, a nutritionist and
a diabetes education expert.
"It's a lot to know about
managing your condition,"
Larkin said. "The member
care specialist system really
takes all of the legwork out
of what the patients would
normally have to do on their
own."
SHCA also provides ac
cess to "telemedicine," al
lowing patients to communi
cate with their physician via
video chat, set up a visit via
email and even check lab re

suits online. This will make
care much more accessible
to employees, Larkin said.
In addition to SHCA and
Kaiser HMO, Stanford of
fers an EPO plan, a PPO
plan and a high-deductible
plan for employees.
Evans expects that some
employees who are currently
under the PPO plan the
most expensive option
will switch to SHCA, as it
will allow them access to the
same providers at a lower
price point. The University
is anticipating roughly 1,700
employees to select the new
plan during this open enroll
ment period, Evans added.
The lower-cost options
may not be ideal for every

one, however, since both SH
PA and Kaiser are regional
to the Bay Area and Califor
nia, respectively.
"If you have kids back
East, you probably won't se
lect that plan unless they're
coming home on a regular
basis," Evans said.
Beginning Oct. 28, the ex
tended enrollment period
will allow employees more
time to review the details of
the new medical plan, thus
giving them a chance to
make an informed health
care selection among a
group of five distinct cover
age plans.
After the November
deadline, Stanford employ
ees will be unable to change

plans or add or drop eligible
dependents from coverage
until next fall, given no ma
jor life events come up. Qual
ified life events may include
a change in marriage or
partnership, welcoming a
new child to the family, tak
ing a leave of absence or ex
periencing a change in em
ployment, according to the
University's human re
sources website.
"Of course, everyone has
their own health profile and
their own concerns," Larkin
said. "We built this so that it
could be appealing to a broad
population."

ics, Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal and other local providers.
While employees who choose the
SHCA plan will be required to select a
primary care physician from over 300
primary care providers, they will also
have access to 2,300 specialists across
the Bay Area, according to informa
tion available on the SHPA website.
The chosen primary care physician
will coordinate the care throughout
the greater network.
According to Neal Evans, director
of Health and Welfare Programs for
University Human Resources, the new
healthcare plan is priced similarly to
the Kaiser Permanente HMO plan,
which was previously the cheapest op
tion for Stanford employees. Now,
both SHCA and the Kaiser HMO pro
vide free, employee-only coverage.
To allow for this free coverage, the
University will pay a semi-monthly
contribution of $290.74 to Stanford
Hospital & Clinics. Employees whose
family members share a plan will be
required to contribute an additional,
semi-monthly payment, though it
would still be less than what they
would have to pay under the other
three current options.
"Cost was really becoming an issue
for [Stanford] employees," Evans said.
"The arrangement is really premised
on delivering efficient, high-quality
care at a reasonable price."
James Larkin, director of Corpo
rate Communications & Public Rela
tions for Stanford Hospital & Clinics,
predicts that SHCA's emphasis on cus
tomer service and user accessibility
will attract many Stanford employees
to the new plan in addition to reducing
the price tag.
One such benefit is that each pa
tient will be assigned a member care
specialist who will help patients coor
dinate all of their individual medical
plans. For example, Larkin said that if
an employee is newly diagnosed with
diabetes, he or she might need to see a
specialist, a nutritionist and
a diabetes education expert.
"It's a lot to know about
managing your condition,"
Larkin said. "The member
care specialist system really
takes all of the legwork out
of what the patients would
normally have to do on their
own."
SHCA also provides ac
cess to "telemedicine," al
lowing patients to communi
cate with their physician via
video chat, set up a visit via
email and even check lab re

suits online. This will make
care much more accessible
to employees, Larkin said.
In addition to SHCA and
Kaiser HMO, Stanford of
fers an EPO plan, a PPO
plan and a high-deductible
plan for employees.
Evans expects that some
employees who are currently
under the PPO plan the
most expensive option
will switch to SHCA, as it
will allow them access to the
same providers at a lower
price point. The University
is anticipating roughly 1,700
employees to select the new
plan during this open enroll
ment period, Evans added.
The lower-cost options
may not be ideal for every

one, however, since both SH
PA and Kaiser are regional
to the Bay Area and Califor
nia, respectively.
"If you have kids back
East, you probably won't se
lect that plan unless they're
coming home on a regular
basis," Evans said.
Beginning Oct. 28, the ex
tended enrollment period
will allow employees more
time to review the details of
the new medical plan, thus
giving them a chance to
make an informed health
care selection among a
group of five distinct cover
age plans.
After the November
deadline, Stanford employ
ees will be unable to change

plans or add or drop eligible
dependents from coverage
until next fall, given no ma
jor life events come up. Qual
ified life events may include
a change in marriage or
partnership, welcoming a
new child to the family, tak
ing a leave of absence or ex
periencing a change in em
ployment, according to the
University's human re
sources website.
"Of course, everyone has
their own health profile and
their own concerns," Larkin
said. "We built this so that it
could be appealing to a broad
population."

Amid concerns over rising health
care costs, Stanford recently launched
a new, low-cost healthcare option for
its employees and their dependents
with an extended open enrollment date
until Nov. 19.
Stanford Health Care Alliance
(SHCA) connects employees and their
dependents with a network of physi
cians from Stanford Hospital & Clin
ics, Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal and other local providers.
While employees who choose the
SHCA plan will be required to select a
primary care physician from over 300
