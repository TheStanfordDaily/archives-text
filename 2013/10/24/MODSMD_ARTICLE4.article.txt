## CAPS improves ADHD assessment protocol 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK 
This year, Counseling and Psycho
logical Sendees (CAPS) changed how
they would conduct assessments on
students for attention deficit hyperac
tivity disorder (ADHD).
The new protocol's primary goal is
to make the assessment process more
efficient and to ensure improved ac
curacy of diagnosis and treatment,
said Julie Tinklenberg B.S. '9O M.S.
'9O, a staff psychiatrist at CAPS in
volved in changing the guidelines.
In recent year's, the number of
students seeking an ADHD diagnosis
has increased, Tinklenberg said. Ac
cording to CAPS data, 1.8 percent of
Stanford undergraduates were diag
nosed and/or treated for ADHD in
the last twelve months.
The new assessment protocol re
quires that a student, a close friend or
family member and someone who
knew them as a child fill out an assess
ment form.
"What we're doing through hav
ing these forms is getting rating num
bers and free text to give specific ex

amples of what did they look like as a
child, how exactly are they impaired
now," Tinklenberg said. "We collect
all of that information and then when
they come in, we have what we need.
We don't have to spend time tracking
down the different pieces."
CAPS Director Ronald Albucher
said that the changes in the ADHD
assessment were independent of oth
er recent changes at CAPS includ
ing expanding hours and increased
staff caused by increased student
demand.
"We've spent several years re
searching this [issue]," Albucher said.
He explained that this research in
cluded conversations with staff psy
chiatrists, looking at the issues of
proper stimulant use on college cam
puses and determining the role of
neuropsychological testing as well as
CAPS' relationship with the Office of
Accessible Education.
In addition to simplifying the as
sessment protocol, linldenberg ex
plained how the forms would improve
