## CAPS improves ADHD assessment protocol 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK 
This year, Counseling and Psycho
logical Sendees (CAPS) changed how
they would conduct assessments on
students for attention deficit hyperac
tivity disorder (ADHD).
The new protocol's primary goal is
to make the assessment process more
efficient and to ensure improved ac
curacy of diagnosis and treatment,
said Julie Tinklenberg B.S. '9O M.S.
'9O, a staff psychiatrist at CAPS in
volved in changing the guidelines.
In recent year's, the number of
students seeking an ADHD diagnosis
has increased, Tinklenberg said. Ac
cording to CAPS data, 1.8 percent of
Stanford undergraduates were diag
nosed and/or treated for ADHD in
the last twelve months.
The new assessment protocol re
quires that a student, a close friend or
family member and someone who
knew them as a child fill out an assess
ment form.
"What we're doing through hav
ing these forms is getting rating num
bers and free text to give specific ex

amples of what did they look like as a
child, how exactly are they impaired
now," Tinklenberg said. "We collect
all of that information and then when
they come in, we have what we need.
We don't have to spend time tracking
down the different pieces."
CAPS Director Ronald Albucher
said that the changes in the ADHD
assessment were independent of oth
er recent changes at CAPS includ
ing expanding hours and increased
staff caused by increased student
demand.
"We've spent several years re
searching this [issue]," Albucher said.
He explained that this research in
cluded conversations with staff psy
chiatrists, looking at the issues of
proper stimulant use on college cam
puses and determining the role of
neuropsychological testing as well as
CAPS' relationship with the Office of
Accessible Education.

sessment protocol, linldenberg ex
plained how the forms would improve

the accuracy of diagnoses
made by CAPS clinicians by
allowing for a more consistent
method of gathering informa
tion needed for a diagnosis.
"The protocol makes me
more comfortable as a clini
cian because I know that I'm
doing a thoughtful, thorough
assessment," Tinklenberg
said.

In previous years, clini
cians at CAPS would have to
gather several pieces of infor
mation, including a medical
history of the patient from the
patient's parents. The final di
agnosis would require three or
more visits until clinicians
could determine if the infor
mation they received was con
sistent or inconsistent with
ADHD criteria found in the
fifth edition of the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-V).
According to Tinklenberg,
there is no clinical test that
can give a definitive answer
regarding whether a student
has ADHD, but the new sys
tem of assessment can help
clinicians improve the accura

cy of an ADHD diagnosis.
"In assessing someone,
you have to know who they
were as an elementary school
student and if they were hav
ing a hard time at school, at
home and in social circum
stances," Tinklenberg said.
"In two of those areas, there
has to be impairment due to
these symptoms."
Tinklenberg described
that there must be lifelong
symptoms in inattention and
hyperactivity to qualify for a
diagnosis. This criterion helps
rule out other diagnoses, in
cluding bipolar disorder, anxi
ety disorder and substance
abuse where individuals may
show similar symptoms to
that of ADHD.
She also said the new as
sessment will help clinicians
be more careful when pre
scribing medication.
"In a lot of cases students
are interested in starting
stimulant treatment, and I am
uncomfortable starting on
that path for someone unless
it makes sense," Tinklenberg
said. "Taking the time to make
sure that it makes sense, I
think that it's going to be
much better."

more visits until clinicians
could determine if the infor
mation they received was con
sistent or inconsistent with
ADHD criteria found in the
fifth edition of the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-V).
According to Tinklenberg,
there is no clinical test that
can give a definitive answer
regarding whether a student
has ADHD, but the new sys
tem of assessment can help
clinicians improve the accura

cy of an ADHD diagnosis.
"In assessing someone,
you have to know who they
were as an elementary school
student and if they were hav
ing a hard time at school, at
home and in social circum
stances," Tinklenberg said.
"In two of those areas, there
has to be impairment due to
these symptoms."
Tinklenberg described
that there must be lifelong
symptoms in inattention and
hyperactivity to qualify for a
diagnosis. This criterion helps
rule out other diagnoses, in
cluding bipolar disorder, anxi
ety disorder and substance
abuse where individuals may
show similar symptoms to
that of ADHD.
She also said the new as
sessment will help clinicians
be more careful when pre
scribing medication.
"In a lot of cases students
are interested in starting
stimulant treatment, and I am
uncomfortable starting on
that path for someone unless
it makes sense," Tinklenberg
said. "Taking the time to make
sure that it makes sense, I
think that it's going to be
much better."

This year, Counseling and Psycho
logical Sendees (CAPS) changed how
they would conduct assessments on
students for attention deficit hyperac
tivity disorder (ADHD).
The new protocol's primary goal is
to make the assessment process more
efficient and to ensure improved ac
curacy of diagnosis and treatment,
said Julie Tinklenberg B.S. '9O M.S.
'9O, a staff psychiatrist at CAPS in
volved in changing the guidelines.
In recent year's, the number of
students seeking an ADHD diagnosis
has increased, Tinklenberg said. Ac
cording to CAPS data, 1.8 percent of
Stanford undergraduates were diag
nosed and/or treated for ADHD in
the last twelve months.
The new assessment protocol re
quires that a student, a close friend or
family member and someone who
knew them as a child fill out an assess
ment form.
"What we're doing through hav
ing these forms is getting rating num
bers and free text to give specific ex

amples of what did they look like as a
child, how exactly are they impaired
now," Tinklenberg said. "We collect
all of that information and then when
they come in, we have what we need.
We don't have to spend time tracking
down the different pieces."
CAPS Director Ronald Albucher
said that the changes in the ADHD
assessment were independent of oth
er recent changes at CAPS includ
ing expanding hours and increased
staff caused by increased student
demand.
"We've spent several years re
searching this [issue]," Albucher said.
He explained that this research in
cluded conversations with staff psy
chiatrists, looking at the issues of
proper stimulant use on college cam
puses and determining the role of
neuropsychological testing as well as
CAPS' relationship with the Office of
Accessible Education.
In addition to simplifying the as
sessment protocol, linldenberg ex
plained how the forms would improve

the accuracy of diagnoses
made by CAPS clinicians by
allowing for a more consistent
method of gathering informa
tion needed for a diagnosis.
"The protocol makes me
more comfortable as a clini
cian because I know that I'm
doing a thoughtful, thorough
assessment," Tinklenberg
said.

In previous years, clini
cians at CAPS would have to
gather several pieces of infor
mation, including a medical
history of the patient from the
patient's parents. The final di

more visits until clinicians
could determine if the infor
