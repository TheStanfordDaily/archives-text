## A
						LOOK AT STANFORD'S STARTING CORNERBACKS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
If you're a Pac-12 offensive coordinator,
you've got to pick your battles when going
up against Stanford. It's probably not
wise to attack the Cardinal's vaunted
front seven. Thus, only 15 Division I
teams have faced fewer carries per game than
Stanford has or its ballhawking safeties.
Thus, only eight of the 184 completions against
the Cardinal have gone for 30 yards or more.
By process of elimination, then, Stanford's
opponents have been picking on its corners,
sophomore Alex Carter and junior Wayne
Lyons. There's just one problem with that strat
egy: Few young players have garnered as much
praise from head coach David Shaw as Carter
and Lyons have.
