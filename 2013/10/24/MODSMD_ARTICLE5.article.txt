# LIFE ON THE EDGE
## A 						LOOK AT STANFORD'S STARTING CORNERBACKS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
If you're a Pac-12 offensive coordinator,
you've got to pick your battles when going
up against Stanford. It's probably not
wise to attack the Cardinal's vaunted
front seven. Thus, only 15 Division I
teams have faced fewer carries per game than
Stanford has or its ballhawking safeties.
Thus, only eight of the 184 completions against
the Cardinal have gone for 30 yards or more.
By process of elimination, then, Stanford's
opponents have been picking on its corners,
sophomore Alex Carter and junior Wayne
Lyons. There's just one problem with that strat
egy: Few young players have garnered as much
praise from head coach David Shaw as Carter
and Lyons have.

Back when Lyons was a
freshman, Shaw said he could
very well become one of the
best defensive backs in the
country by the end of his ca
reer; earlier this month, Shaw
claimed that Carter could go at
only 75 percent and still cover
most receivers. But have Stan
ford's corner's lived up to the
hype?
Carter, for one, has contin
ued to improve after his break
out 2012 campaign, which saw
him earn All-Pac-12 Honorable
Mention as a freshman. That
has put a lot of pressure on
Lyonsâ€”not to live up to his
coach's expectations, but to
shoulder the burden when of
fenses try to keep the ball away
from Carter.
"[Lyons] is a competitive
guy" said defensive coordina
tor Derek Mason. "He takes it
personally when guys think,
'Oh, you won't throw it to
[Carter], but you'll throw it to
me.'"
Few expected that fate for
Lyons back in 2011. The then
freshman stood out to his
coaches for his competitive
ness, his strength and his re
fusal to shy away from contact,
and it appealed that he would
soon become Stanford's top
corner.
Lyons' development, how

ever, was somewhat side
tracked by a broken foot he
suffered his freshman year. He
wasn't as explosive when he re
turned in 2012, limiting his pro
duction to 25 tackles, a mark he
surpassed in just the first five
games of this season.
"It's been a great journey"
Lyons said of his recovery "[Di
rector of Spoils Performance
Shannon] Turley did a great job
helping me recover... I can
move the way I want to now"
Mason noted that while
Lyons' physical development
took a slight detour, his mental
improvement continued through
the injury
"Coming from [a] high
school where he played almost
every position because he was
everything to his team, the
thing that you see now is that
he's able to settle into a position
and learn, gain experience,
watch guys before him who are
now playing in the NFL," Ma
son said. "He's actually started
to increase his football IQ; but
more than that, he's really
starting to come into his own,
because he's older... He's get
ting better every time he touch
es the grass."
That was apparent earlier
this season, when Lyons took
three pass interference penal
ties in a span of just two weeks
against Arizona State and
Washington State. Around that
time, Mason noted that Lyons'
aggressive style of play would
inevitably result in penalties,
but that as the corner matured

in his new starting role, he
would get a better feel for when
the referees would throw a flag.
In the three games since the
matchup with the Cougars,
Lyons hasn't been flagged for
interference once.
The Cardinal will need that
kind of disciplined play fi'om
Carter and Lyons this weekend
when it goes up against Oregon
State's passing attack, which
boasts the best statistical quar
terback (Sean Mannion, 2,992
passing yards) and wideout
(Brandin Cooks, 1,176 receiv
ing yards) in the country.
Though the matchup is a test
of both Stanford corners' de
velopment, chances are the
Beavers will do what every
other Cardinal opponent does:
pick on Lyons.
"The one thing I'm trying
to get him to understand is re
ally just [to] take it in stride,"
Mason said of the competitive
Lyons. "Just continue to play
hard and good things will hap
pen."
