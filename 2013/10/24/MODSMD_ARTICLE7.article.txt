## Pre-education students seek formal advising program 
### JAMIE HELYAR 
While students pursuing pre
professional courses of study have
concerns about advising programs
meeting their needs, those inter
ested in a career in education cur
rently lack formal support.
Student leaders in the Stanford
Pre-Education Society (SPREES)
have started conversations with
Undergraduate Advising and Re
search and the Career Develop
ment Center regarding the estab
lishment of pre-education advising.
Unlike undergraduates inter
ested in pursuing careers in Medi
cine, Law or Business, there is
still no formal pre-professional ad
vising program for students inter
ested in education.
"I think the reason there hasn't
been education-specific advising is
because there's this myth, this be
lief that Stanford students aren't
really interested," said Julia Quin
tero 'l5, SPREES president.
Quintero founded SPREES last
year to address this lack of advising.
In the meantime, the group is
already gearing up for its first
campus-wide event on Oct. 29,
aiming to generate discussion on
why Stanford needs to prepare
students for careers in education.
Speakers will include President
John Hennessy, Claude Steele,
dean of the Graduate School of
Education (GSE), Michael Kirst,

president of the California State
Board of Education and Rachel
Lotan M.A.'Bl, M.A. 'B3, Ph.D. 'B5,
director of the Stanford Teacher
Education Program.
Quintero hopes that the posi
tive response to SPREES on cam
pus will encourage the University
to create pre-education advising.
"I think there's a big interest in
education that we're just now
teasing out, that we didn't realize
was there because [students']
needs weren't being met," Quin
tero said.
However, students cite gaps
even among current pre-profes
sional advising programs.
Though pre-medical students
are not required to undergo pre
professional advising, Stanford of
fers two pre-medical advisors and
one part-time advisor to address
the needs of hundreds of pre-med
students many of whom have
felt that their advising experience
is not individualized enough.
"For specific questions, they
were good at referring me to other
places," said Adele Xu, 'l4. "They
gave me good, general informa
tion."
Xu said other mentors who she
worked with have played a larger
role helping her through her pre
medical experience and the appli
cation process for medical schools
than did her pre-med advisors.

Recently however, pre-medical
advisors have incorporated more
personalized components into
their advising. Some pre-med ad
visors, like Patricia Lewis, encour
age students to keep a reflective
journal.
Trevor Mooney 'l4 said jour
naling was the most helpful aspect
of his advising experience for ap
plying to medical schools. "When
it came time to sit down and actu
ally write my essay, it flowed real
ly well," Mooney said.
Mooney also cited the mock-in
terviews conducted by advisors as
a strong resource for prospective
medical school applicants.
Still, students feel there are still
more changes to be made. Students
noted that none of the three pre
medical advisors have backgrounds
as physicians, which puts them at a
disadvantage when seeking insight
on the application process.
"There are other sources where
you can get experience from some
one who actually applied them
selves, had gone through the
process themselves," Xu said.
But according to Lewis, while
medical doctors make good mentors
for students, it is the job of pre
medical advisors to stay updated on
current developments in medical
school applications, MCAT guide
lines and pre-med curriculum.
"[Doctors] may have matriculat-

Ed in med school 30 years ago,"
Lewis said, whose background is in
education. "The rules change com
pletely. The admissions have
changed."
Stanford's pre-medical advisors
aren't the only pre-professional ad
visors to lack formal background in
the profession they oversee. Sally
Mentzer, the advisor for pre-busi
ness students, did not attend busi
ness school.
In addition, many pre-business
students do not even know advising
exists for their field.
"I wasn't aware of the presence
of pre-business advising at Stan
ford," said Kemar England 'l4, who
plans on applying to business school
after graduating.
Many pre-professional students
are still hoping changes will be
made to advising programs.
Vanessa Ochavillo 'l6, a pre-med
student, said she would like to see
the premedical advising department
offer more immersion programs
similar to those like Cardinal Free
Clinics student-run clinics pro
viding healthcare to the uninsured
but without the current high lev
els of selectivity.
"The programs that give you
those opportunities are very, very
competitive," Ochavillo said.
