## Disillusioned with the SEC at last 
### Winston Shi 
It's funny—except not actually
funny—just how much rever
ence the Southeastern Confer
ence (SEC) commands in the
eyes of the college football
community.
This is a fairly ridiculous thing to
say, seeing as the SEC has won the
last seven national championships,
but the sort of adulation the SEC gets
can be a bit grating. When the Pac-12
eats itself alive in conference play it's
called mediocrity; when the SEC
does so, it's called depth.
Last week saw fireworks across
the South. The most renowned con
ference in college football has all sorts
of teams with massive flaws LSU
and Texas A&M are giving up points
by the boatload, Florida is sputtering
beyond belief on offense and Georgia
and South Carolina, beset by injuries,
have been killed by their lack of
depth. Formerly moribund teams like
Ole Miss and Tennessee and even
Vanderbilt beat squads that had been
penciled in for 10 wins. Alabama re
mains the ultimate conference stan
dard-bearer, and Missouri and
Auburn have fielded strong teams as
well, but the vulnerability of the SEC
seems clearer than ever.
After the smoke cleared, we're all
wondering: What happened?
The easiest question to ask is: Was
the SEC simply overrated? People
love to bash the conference for its
commitment to scheduling badly. The
SEC only schedules eight conference
games a year, and its teams love to
pay hundreds of thousands of dollars
to play and beat squads that are over
matched for the sake of being over
matched. Scheduling is a science and
the SEC caught on more quickly than
anybody else that strength of sched
ule doesn't really matter.
But that's not the whole story
Though SEC teams are for the most
part disinterested in playing out of
conference, they still understand that
some out-of-conference linkage
makes comparisons possible. If the
SEC didn't play strong teams out of
conference, they'd be the D-l version
of the New England Small College
Athletic Conference.
Under Nick Saban, Alabama has
played Florida State, Clemson,
Michigan, Virginia Tech twice and
Penn State twice. LSU kicked off its
run to the 2011 national champi
onship game by beating the daylights
out of Oregon. Georgia was willing to
schedule Boise State when almost no
body would (and lost, but it's the
thought that counts).
The latest round of conference re
alignment has killed Texas A&M-
Texas and Missouri-Kansas, but the
SEC has traditionally paid attention
to its great out-of-conference rival
ries; Georgia-Georgia Tech and Flori
da-FSU immediately spring to mind.
Moreover, the SEC has tradition
ally done well in bowl games, even
outside its national championship
streak. Its bowl tie-ins have en
trenched a certain sense of superiori
ty bowls are supposed to match up
similar teams, and the SEC's No. 3
team plays the Big 12's No. 2, its No.
4 plays the Big Ten's No. 3, its No. 5
plays the ACC's No. 2 (!), and its No.
6 plays the Big Ten's No. 4. Despite
these unfavorable matchups, the
SEC wins 60 percent of its bowl
games. Let's not underestimate what
has been a marvelous run for a mar
velous conference.
When the SEC is looking weak, I
doubt it's because it wasn't any good
before. Teams ebb and flow, and it's
just not easy to field six good teams
year in and year out. The confer
ence's upper-middle class was always
going to regress to the mean one way
or the other, and let's not forget that
every team in the country is still look
ing up at Alabama until proven other
wise.
David Shaw made news when he
needled the media for comparing
Stanford's style of football to Ala
bama or LSU.
"I don't necessarily take [those
comparisons] as a compliment," he
said. "I'd rather have people say
we're old school."
He's right in that no team has a
monopoly on pro-style offense or
staunch defense. I remember when
Alabama was clawing its way back
from irrelevance, and LSU has slipped
up at times as well. Shaw's words
weren't a knock against the SEC, but
they definitely sounded like one, and
Shaw is too smart to not know how the
media would run with it.
It's nice to poke fun at the SEC. It
reminds the world that there are oth-

er conferences out there. One
might even call it a public
service. Luck has played a
massive role in the SEC as
cendancy, as it does for all
runs of success; but if not for
Stanford, Baylor, lowa State
and not one but two absurd
blocked field goals by Ter
rence Cody, Nick Saban

would still be ring-less in
Tuscaloosa.
If the Pac-12 wants re
spect, it needs to bring an end
to what the SEC can always
hold over the rest of the coun
try. This is as good a chance as
any to strike. End the SEC's
streak, and the pundits will fi
nally shut up.

If you're still unclear as to
what Winston's feelings are
towards the SEC, email him
at wshi9Jf@stanford.edu and
he will gladly elaborate.

Tuscaloosa.
If the Pac-12 wants re
spect, it needs to bring an end
to what the SEC can always
hold over the rest of the coun
try. This is as good a chance as
any to strike. End the SEC's
streak, and the pundits will fi
nally shut up.

what Winston's feelings are

It's funny—except not actually
funny—just how much rever
ence the Southeastern Confer
ence (SEC) commands in the
eyes of the college football
community.
This is a fairly ridiculous thing to
say, seeing as the SEC has won the
last seven national championships,
but the sort of adulation the SEC gets
can be a bit grating. When the Pac-12
eats itself alive in conference play it's
called mediocrity; when the SEC
does so, it's called depth.
Last week saw fireworks across
the South. The most renowned con
ference in college football has all sorts
of teams with massive flaws LSU
and Texas A&M are giving up points
by the boatload, Florida is sputtering
beyond belief on offense and Georgia
and South Carolina, beset by injuries,
have been killed by their lack of
depth. Formerly moribund teams like
Ole Miss and Tennessee and even
Vanderbilt beat squads that had been
penciled in for 10 wins. Alabama re
mains the ultimate conference stan
dard-bearer, and Missouri and
Auburn have fielded strong teams as
well, but the vulnerability of the SEC
seems clearer than ever.
After the smoke cleared, we're all
wondering: What happened?
The easiest question to ask is: Was
the SEC simply overrated? People
love to bash the conference for its
commitment to scheduling badly. The
SEC only schedules eight conference
games a year, and its teams love to
pay hundreds of thousands of dollars
to play and beat squads that are over
matched for the sake of being over
matched. Scheduling is a science and
the SEC caught on more quickly than
anybody else that strength of sched
ule doesn't really matter.
But that's not the whole story
Though SEC teams are for the most
part disinterested in playing out of
conference, they still understand that
some out-of-conference linkage
makes comparisons possible. If the
SEC didn't play strong teams out of
conference, they'd be the D-l version
of the New England Small College
Athletic Conference.
Under Nick Saban, Alabama has
played Florida State, Clemson,
Michigan, Virginia Tech twice and
Penn State twice. LSU kicked off its
run to the 2011 national champi
onship game by beating the daylights
out of Oregon. Georgia was willing to
schedule Boise State when almost no
body would (and lost, but it's the
thought that counts).
The latest round of conference re
alignment has killed Texas A&M-
Texas and Missouri-Kansas, but the
SEC has traditionally paid attention
to its great out-of-conference rival
ries; Georgia-Georgia Tech and Flori
da-FSU immediately spring to mind.
Moreover, the SEC has tradition
ally done well in bowl games, even
outside its national championship
streak. Its bowl tie-ins have en
trenched a certain sense of superiori
ty bowls are supposed to match up
similar teams, and the SEC's No. 3
team plays the Big 12's No. 2, its No.
4 plays the Big Ten's No. 3, its No. 5
plays the ACC's No. 2 (!), and its No.
6 plays the Big Ten's No. 4. Despite
these unfavorable matchups, the
SEC wins 60 percent of its bowl
games. Let's not underestimate what
has been a marvelous run for a mar
velous conference.
When the SEC is looking weak, I
doubt it's because it wasn't any good
before. Teams ebb and flow, and it's
just not easy to field six good teams
year in and year out. The confer
ence's upper-middle class was always
going to regress to the mean one way
or the other, and let's not forget that
every team in the country is still look
ing up at Alabama until proven other
wise.
David Shaw made news when he
needled the media for comparing
Stanford's style of football to Ala
bama or LSU.
"I don't necessarily take [those
comparisons] as a compliment," he
said. "I'd rather have people say
we're old school."
He's right in that no team has a
monopoly on pro-style offense or
staunch defense. I remember when
Alabama was clawing its way back
from irrelevance, and LSU has slipped
up at times as well. Shaw's words
weren't a knock against the SEC, but
they definitely sounded like one, and
Shaw is too smart to not know how the
media would run with it.
It's nice to poke fun at the SEC. It
reminds the world that there are oth-

er conferences out there. One
might even call it a public
service. Luck has played a
massive role in the SEC as
cendancy, as it does for all
runs of success; but if not for
Stanford, Baylor, lowa State
and not one but two absurd
blocked field goals by Ter
rence Cody, Nick Saban

would still be ring-less in
