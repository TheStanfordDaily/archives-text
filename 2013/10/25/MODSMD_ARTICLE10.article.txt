### JORDAN WALLACH 
With a rematch against No. 4 USC rapidly
approaching, Stanford's women's volleyball
hopes to earn a victory tonight against Oregon
State to carry some momentum into next
Wednesday's showdown.
The No. 6 Cardinal (14-4, 7-2 Pac-12) hits
the mid-way point of its Pac-12 season with
tonight's game against the Beavers (9-10,0-8),
who are still looking for their first conference
win this season.
Stanford is coming off a sweep against
the No. 20 Oregon Ducks, in which it hit .296
and totaled 14 team blocks, one less than its

season-high. It was a bounce-back victory af
ter the team's five-set loss to previous No. 6
Washington last Sunday, improving the Cardi
nal's record to 20-4 in matches after a loss
over the last five seasons.
The Card is 56-0 all-time against Oregon
State, including two sweeps of the Beavers in
the 2012 season. Senior outside hitter Carly
Wopat hit .516 with 18 kills over the two
matches, while sophomore outside hitter Brit
tany Howard had 17 kills and 21 digs.
While Oregon State started the season
with nine wins in its first 11 games, it has not

Senior outside hitter Carly Wopat (right) hit .516 and posted 18 kills against Oregon State in
two matches last season. Wopat looks to help the No. 6 Cardinal continue its 56-0 all-time
dominance of the Beavers when the two squads meet at Maples Pavilion tonight at 7 p.m.
won a match since Sept. 20 against
Long Beach State. Since the skid
began at the start of conference
play, the team ranks last in the Pac
-12 in team hitting, kills, assists and
blocks. While that clearly shows the
strength of the conference, which
currently boasts three of the six top
teams in the country, the Beavers'
drop-off from a .242 hitting per
centage in their first 11 games to a
.125 mark over their last eight also
conveys internal struggles.
"I need to give this team credit
for really battling but right now, we
are still making too many unforced
errors," head coach Taras Liskevych
told osubeavers.com after Oregon
State's three-set loss to Colorado
last Sunday. "When you are in a los
ing streak, it is very tough to be ag
gressive at the end of sets. That's
what we have to do. We have to get
in there, be aggressive and finish
the game."
Still, the Beavers have a couple
players to watch: one each on the
offensive and defensive ends. Sen
ior libero Becky Defoe ranks fourth
in the Pac-12 with 4.41 digs per set
this season, and has a chance to
reach a career milestone by the end
of the season. She currently has
1,831 career digs, and if she tallies
about 14 digs per match for the rest
of the season, she'll become just
the 10th player in Pac-12 history
with 2,000 career digs. Meanwhile,
senior setter Tayla Woods controls
the Beaver offense, averaging 9.89
assists per set this season, which
ranks seventh in the conference.

With just four full days after
this match before its next one
against USC, Stanford will look to
take care of Oregon State quickly
before moving on to film study and
preparation for the top team in the
Pac-12.
The Cardinal takes on the
Beavers at 7 p.m. tonight at Maples
Pavilion.
