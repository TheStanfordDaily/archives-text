# Pass rush key against Mannion

### MHO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
Let me preface this preview
with a caveat: No one, in
cluding myself, truly knows
how good this Oregon State
team is right now.

video-game numbers on offense all
year long. At the same time, the
Oregon State defense has had trou

Washington of FCS fame (who beat

group, Oregon State has only given
up an average of 19 points per game
in its last three contests: Beaver
wins against Colorado, Washington
State and Cal.

the teams put in front of them, be
sides Eastern Washington, so I can't
say with any type of certainty that
they are bad. However, I think that
people are overstating how good
this team actually is, based on what
