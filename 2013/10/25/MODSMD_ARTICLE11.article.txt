# Pass rush key against Mannion
## 
### MHO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
Let me preface this preview
with a caveat: No one, in
cluding myself, truly knows
how good this Oregon State
team is right now.

The Beavers, led by quarter
back Sean Mannion and wide re
ceiver Brandin Cooks, have put up
video-game numbers on offense all
year long. At the same time, the
Oregon State defense has had trou
ble stopping anyone, even Eastern
Washington of FCS fame (who beat
the Beavers 49-46) and San Diego
State (who put up fewer points at
Air Force than against OSU).
There are two very different
ways to interpret these Beavers.
The optimists say that Oregon State
has a great offense and a young de
fense that just wasn't ready for the
start of the season but is now play
ing good ball. To be fair to this
group, Oregon State has only given
up an average of 19 points per game
in its last three contests: Beaver
wins against Colorado, Washington
State and Cal.

But the skeptics, who include
myself, aren't buying these "suc
cesses" just yet. Yes, the Beavers
have taken care of business against
the teams put in front of them, be
sides Eastern Washington, so I can't
say with any type of certainty that
they are bad. However, I think that
people are overstating how good
this team actually is, based on what
we've seen so far.

If the Beavers are good enough
to take down the Card, it will al-

most certainly be because of their passing of
fense, so that is what I'm going to focus the rest
of this preview on.
Oregon State's offense is, at its core, the
highest-powered version of a cat-and-mouse
game that you can imagine. It has two main
strengths: deep passes to Cooks and screen
passes to keep defenses off-balance.

Stanford head coach David Shaw was effu
sive in his praise of Oregon State's deep-passing
game. Again, ignoring the weakness of the
Beavers' competition, OSU's deep passing has
been astoundingly efficient.
Mannion is completing 69 percent of his
passes and averaging 427 yards per game
through the air, both great numbers. And Cooks,
his top receiver, already has 76 catches for
1,176 yards (that's 168 yards per game!) and 12
touchdowns.

If there is any weakness on Stanford's de
fense, one-on-one coverage by the cornerbacks
especially the cornerbacks besides sopho
more Alex Carter might be it. Stanford does
not historically have its best cornerback follow
an opponent's top receiver around, and Shaw
told us earlier this week that every one of his
corners would cover Cooks. That could leave
some openings for Mannion to find Cooks on a
game-changing play.
Stanford's most effective tactic in stopping
this deep ball is probably its pass rush. Mannion
takes a lot of seven-step drops, which require
prolonged protection, and that will provide op
portunities for Stanford's best pass rushers to
get hits on Mannion. If Oregon State's line
somehow keeps Mannion clean, it could be a
long night for the Stanford defense.
Oregon State's best chance of keeping
Mannion off his back is going to come from mix
ing in the screen pass. The Beavers run pretty
much every type of screen that exists, and that
could make Stanford's rushers a little hesitant in
their pursuit of Mannion.
For all those reasons, expect the back-and
forth between screens and deep passes to some
times work and sometimes fail disastrously.
Whoever makes the most of these big-play op
portunities, whether by forcing turnovers or hit
ting deep touchdown passes, should have the
edge, and that's why it's the key to the game.

Let me preface this preview
with a caveat: No one, in
cluding myself, truly knows
how good this Oregon State
team is right now.

The Beavers, led by quarter
back Sean Mannion and wide re
ceiver Brandin Cooks, have put up
video-game numbers on offense all
year long. At the same time, the
Oregon State defense has had trou
ble stopping anyone, even Eastern
Washington of FCS fame (who beat
the Beavers 49-46) and San Diego
State (who put up fewer points at
Air Force than against OSU).
There are two very different
ways to interpret these Beavers.
The optimists say that Oregon State
has a great offense and a young de
fense that just wasn't ready for the
start of the season but is now play
ing good ball. To be fair to this
group, Oregon State has only given
up an average of 19 points per game
in its last three contests: Beaver
wins against Colorado, Washington
State and Cal.

But the skeptics, who include
myself, aren't buying these "suc
cesses" just yet. Yes, the Beavers
have taken care of business against
the teams put in front of them, be
sides Eastern Washington, so I can't
say with any type of certainty that
they are bad. However, I think that
people are overstating how good
this team actually is, based on what
we've seen so far.

If the Beavers are good enough
to take down the Card, it will al-

most certainly be because of their passing of
fense, so that is what I'm going to focus the rest
of this preview on.
Oregon State's offense is, at its core, the
highest-powered version of a cat-and-mouse
game that you can imagine. It has two main
strengths: deep passes to Cooks and screen
passes to keep defenses off-balance.

Stanford head coach David Shaw was effu
sive in his praise of Oregon State's deep-passing
game. Again, ignoring the weakness of the
Beavers' competition, OSU's deep passing has
been astoundingly efficient.
Mannion is completing 69 percent of his
passes and averaging 427 yards per game
through the air, both great numbers. And Cooks,
his top receiver, already has 76 catches for
1,176 yards (that's 168 yards per game!) and 12
touchdowns.

If there is any weakness on Stanford's de
fense, one-on-one coverage by the cornerbacks
especially the cornerbacks besides sopho
more Alex Carter might be it. Stanford does
not historically have its best cornerback follow
an opponent's top receiver around, and Shaw
told us earlier this week that every one of his
corners would cover Cooks. That could leave
some openings for Mannion to find Cooks on a
game-changing play.
Stanford's most effective tactic in stopping
this deep ball is probably its pass rush. Mannion
takes a lot of seven-step drops, which require
prolonged protection, and that will provide op
portunities for Stanford's best pass rushers to
get hits on Mannion. If Oregon State's line
somehow keeps Mannion clean, it could be a
long night for the Stanford defense.
Oregon State's best chance of keeping
Mannion off his back is going to come from mix
ing in the screen pass. The Beavers run pretty
much every type of screen that exists, and that
could make Stanford's rushers a little hesitant in
their pursuit of Mannion.
For all those reasons, expect the back-and
forth between screens and deep passes to some
times work and sometimes fail disastrously.
Whoever makes the most of these big-play op
portunities, whether by forcing turnovers or hit
ting deep touchdown passes, should have the
edge, and that's why it's the key to the game.
