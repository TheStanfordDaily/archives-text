# Students arrive late, leave early

Someone's in for a nasty surprise on
Nov. 7, but I'm afraid it's not the Ore
gon Ducks. It's Stanford Athletics Mar
keting. I can picture it now: Stanford
Stadium bursting into a deafening roar

as the Cardinal defends a
late fourth-quarter lead
against its Pac-12 North
nemesis. Meanwhile,
the Red Zone, only three
quarters full, collectively
stretches its arms and -
yawns, and in the time it
takes for the students to -

realize there's actually a football game going on,
the Ducks' quick-strike offense gets off eight
plays in a dominant, game-winning drive.
I hope I'm proven wrong in a couple of
weeks, but I can say with confidence that in my
three years standing in the Red Zone, students

Back in 2011, campus icon Andrew Luck's
senior year, the line outside Gate 3 two hours be

Stanford leads by more than a touchdown in the
fourth quarter, moreover, those end zone sec

Frankly, the students' football frenzy is gone,
and if anyone thinks that's going to change for a
chilly, Thursday-night game in the middle of
midterms, they're dead wrong.
We'll be able to see the letdown coming.
First, we'll get the email rewarding the most ded
icated fans by requiring each student have a cer
tain number of loyalty points to claim an Oregon
ticket. A few days later we'll get another email, all
but biting its fingernails, letting us know that the
requirement has been dropped. Stanford stu
dents can put two and two together.
In part, our student body is to blame for its
overall lack of interest in football â€”we're really
lucky to have free tickets in the first place but
that's a discussion for another place and another
time. What really worries me is that the market
