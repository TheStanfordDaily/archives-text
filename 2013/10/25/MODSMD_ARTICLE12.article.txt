# Students arrive late, leave early
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Someone's in for a nasty surprise on
Nov. 7, but I'm afraid it's not the Ore
gon Ducks. It's Stanford Athletics Mar
keting. I can picture it now: Stanford
Stadium bursting into a deafening roar

as the Cardinal defends a
late fourth-quarter lead
against its Pac-12 North
nemesis. Meanwhile,
the Red Zone, only three
quarters full, collectively
stretches its arms and -
yawns, and in the time it
takes for the students to -

realize there's actually a football game going on,
the Ducks' quick-strike offense gets off eight
plays in a dominant, game-winning drive.
I hope I'm proven wrong in a couple of
weeks, but I can say with confidence that in my
three years standing in the Red Zone, students
have never arrived later and left earlier than they
have so far this season.

Back in 2011, campus icon Andrew Luck's
senior year, the line outside Gate 3 two hours be
fore a game stretched hundreds (if not thou
sands) of students long, resulting in a mad dash
for the best seats when the gate opened; nowa
days, you can walk in an hour beforehand and on
ly a few dozen will have staked their claim. If
Stanford leads by more than a touchdown in the
fourth quarter, moreover, those end zone sec
tions start to empty out pretty darn quickly.
Frankly, the students' football frenzy is gone,
and if anyone thinks that's going to change for a
chilly, Thursday-night game in the middle of
midterms, they're dead wrong.
We'll be able to see the letdown coming.
First, we'll get the email rewarding the most ded
icated fans by requiring each student have a cer
tain number of loyalty points to claim an Oregon
ticket. A few days later we'll get another email, all
but biting its fingernails, letting us know that the
requirement has been dropped. Stanford stu
dents can put two and two together.
In part, our student body is to blame for its
overall lack of interest in football â€”we're really
lucky to have free tickets in the first place but
that's a discussion for another place and another
time. What really worries me is that the market

ing department's butts-in-seats mentality,
while great for the TV camera that periodically
pans over the Red Zone, does little to actually
engage students, which is why I'm as likely to
get a game-day text about an EE lab as I am to
get one about football.
Ever since the loyalty points program was
instituted, students have swiped in at qualify
ing non-football events and left 30 seconds
later through a different gate, loyalty point in
hand. Nobody says anything, of course; elevat
ed "attendance" figures are a plus for the ath
letic department. But is that really the sports
culture we want to build here? No wonder
students leave a four-hour football game early;
they've been taught that they should recog
nize the guy who takes tickets at women's soc
cer matches, but that learning the names
"Courtney Verloo" and "Taylor Uhl" isn't all
that important. (It is.)
What's more, this season the marketing
department botched the one form of student
outreach that has been particularly popular:
the free t-shirts that the entire Red Zone is
supposed to wear. Despite the promise on the
Red Zone's official web site that all students
receive a free shirt, there were no shirts being
distributed at Stanford's recent home con
tests against No. 15 Washington and No. 9
UCLA.

As Senior Associate Athletics Director of
External Relations Kevin Blue confirmed to
The Daily on Twitter this week, the depart
ment ran out of shirts due to "unprecedented
interest." Apparently, it's hard to figure out
how many students go to Stanford. Blue did
not reply to tweets asking whether more
shirts would be purchased for students, but
he did add that they would be sold during bas-

ketball season.
Stanford Athletics deserves a lot of credit
for keeping the Red Zone mostly full in the
year and a half since Luck's departure, and,
again, for making free student tickets a possi
bility. But the marketing department needs to
realize that if it wants students to stay into the
second half, remain interested in football for
all four years and maybe buy season tickets
someday, it has to build a more complete
game-day experience for students.
If The Axe and Palm is going to serve food
at games, let students use meal plan dollars
there and don't put its station all the way
across the stadium; if students show up early
to get the free shirt they've been promised,
give it to them. Marketing gimmicks, like
the basketball team throwing out sandwich
es against UCLA, are a good start, but
they're not a sustainable way to make foot
ball a priority for this truly unique student
body.

One day, that camera is going to pan
over the Red Zone after an opponent scores
a touchdown, and instead of shocked faces,
the world is going to see a bunch of oblivious
Stanford students jumping and waving, hop
ing to get on TV Stanford Athletics Market
ing: Don't let Nov. 7 be that day.

Joseph Beyda spends his nights reminiscing
about the good old days of "Marecic's Mane
iacs." Ask Joseph about his petition to make wigs
mandatory at football games at jbeyda@stan

Frankly, the
students' football
frenzy is gone.
