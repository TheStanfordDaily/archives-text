## TELEVISION THE 						TOP TV SHOWS TO RENT AT GREEN 
### MINNA XIAO 
Not sure how to fill the
"Breaking Bad"-induced void in
your life and desperately searching
for the next binge-watching fix?
Look no further: Here are five ex
cellent TV shows you can rent from
Green Library, just in time for
midterm-season procrastination.

"The IT Crowd"
The third British sitcom creat
ed by Graham linehan, "The IT
Crowd" is what "The Big Bang The
ory" could have been if "TBBT"
were any good. The half-hour com
edy follows the workplace shenani
gans of Roy and Maurice, the two
geeky technicians of the fictional
Reynholm Industries' IT depart
ment, and their technologically in
ept boss, Jen, as the three try to
navigate their personal and profes
sional lives often to hilariously
ill-fated results.

"Web Therapy"
This improvisational comedy
is shot in an innovative format

the viewer only sees the characters
interact through computer screens
(think: Skype chats). The show fol
lows the professional hijinks of
Fiona Wallace (Lisa Kudrow), a self
proclaimed web therapist who of

fers three-minute sessions over the
Internet. Kudrow, with her sharp,
deadpan humor, is perfect as the
gloriously narcissistic Fiona, who is
far more interested in her own life
than the troubles of her patients.
"Web Therapy" also boasts a partic
ularly impressive guest roster, in
cluding Meryl Streep as a "sexual
orientation therapist," Victor Gar
ber as Fiona's long-suffering and
possibly gay husband and a handful
of fellow Friends alumni.

"The Good Wife"
If you're a fan of USA Net
work's lawyer drama "Suits,"
check out "The Good Wife," CBS's
complexly layered and highly serial
ized legal and political drama. Dark
er and less sugar-coated, "The
Good Wife" centers around Alicia
Florrick (played by the mesmeriz
ing, Emmy-winning Julianna Mar
gulies), the wife of a disgraced
State Attorney who returns to a ca
reer as a litigator following her hus
band's sex scandal. There's sex,
crime, political intrigue and some
excellent courtroom scenes

what more could you ask for?

"Freaks and Geeks"
The 1999 teen dramedy
"Freaks and Geeks" was tragically
cancelled after only one season, but
the series has developed a devoted
cult following in years since. It re
mains some of producer Judd Apa
tow's best work. Set in 1980s Michi
gan suburbia, the coming-of-age sto
ry revolves around the lives of sib
lings Lindsay and Sam Weir as they
navigate the ups and downs of high
school. While subtle and poignant in
its portrayal of the trials and tribula
tions of adolescence, "Freaks and
Geeks" remains sharp and fully
fleshed in its humor. The show also
served as the first notable roles for
some of today's most well-known
stars: Jason Segel, James Franco and
Seth Rogen.

"Community"
One of the few dwindling gems
holding together NBC's rapidly wan
ing comedy lineup, "Community" tells
the tale of an eclectic group of stu
dents who form a study group at a
community college and become un
likely friends. Chockfull of meta-jokes
and blink-and-you'll-miss self-referen
tial humor, "Community" is not for
the casual viewer. Featuring exten
sive pop-culture homages, episodes
ranging from "Advanced Dungeons
and Dragons" to "The Politics of Hu
man Sexuality" and hard-to-top cast
chemistry, "Community" wields a
brand of brilliantly eccentric humor.
Stay tuned for the fifth season, which
airs in January, to witness the return of
series creator Dan Harmon at the
helm.
