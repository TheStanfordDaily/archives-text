# LENS FOCUSES ON BLACK
## IDENTITY 
### GILLIE COLLINS 
Carrie Mae Weems, a 2013
Mac Arthur Grantee, received her
first camera for her 21st birthday.
Since then, she has used photogra
phy in conversation with sculpture,
poetry and video to bravely interro
gate issues of race, class and gender
in contemporary society.

"Carrie Mae Weems: Three
Decades of Photography and Video,"
a new exhibition at the Cantor Arts
Center and the artist's first major
retrospective, is the kind of exhibit
that stays with its visitors, reawaken
ing them to the complexity of hu
man nature.

The exhibition is organized

around three themes underlying
Weems' work: the construction of
identity, the power of place and the
legacy of history. Trained as a folk
lorist, dancer and photographer,
Weems is best known for her repre
sentation of the African American
experience but considers her work
universal. In a lecture to the Stan
ford community on Oct. 16, Weems
said that "race is, in some ways, just
the easiest thing to get from my
work... [ln my photos,] people of
color stand for the human multi
tudes."

"Colored People" (1989) is a
collection of portraits of black chil
dren, tinted to "blue black," "golden
yella" and "red bone" colors that

correspond with reductive labels.
Weems puns on the sociopolitical
'lens' through which we see and
name people, highlighting the spec
trum of color contained in the word
"black." In the exhibit, "Colored
People" is on display next to "Unti
tled (Colored People Grid)," which
Weems made almost 20 years later,
intermingling solid color prints and
portraits in a grid. The juxtaposition
of these two works suggests the per
sistence of these labels and their im
plications in a purportedly 'post
racial' American society.
Next door, "The Kitchen Table
Series" (1990), perhaps Weems'

best-known work, exposes the vari
ous identities that converge at a
kitchen table. In this series, as in
many of her pieces, Weems performs
as the protagonist, using her own
kitchen to stage the struggles be
tween sexes and generations for do
mestic power. In the photos, a single
light source illuminates the drama of
family the pressures posed by
monogamy, parenting and communal
responsibility —while 14 text pan
els weave the scenes into narrative.

In one of these pictures, "Man
Smoking," Weems is seated in front
of a poster of Malcolm X, playing
cards and sipping whisky with her
husband. The stakes of the interac
tion are palpable, begging the ques
tion, "Who moves next?" At the
same time, the focal point of the pic
ture is clear: The woman's gaze
its venom, seduction, dignity and
mostly, ambiguity is where the

picture starts and stops.
Much of Weems' work is about
the history of photography and the
social politics of camerawork. In
"Not Manet's Type" (1997), Weems
explores (and blurs) the lines be
tween muse and artist, the way a
photo is "taken" but a subject stays
unseen. To this end, she combines
text with images of images pho
tos of herself, naked, in a mirror. Her
captions ask us what it means to
study and be studied: "STANDING
ON SHAKY GROUND / I POSED
MYSELF FOR CRITICAL STUDY /
BUT WAS NO LONGER CERTAIN /
OF THE QUESTIONS TO ASK."

En route to answering her own
questions about questions, Weems
has traveled widely to Senegal,
Ghana and the Sea Islands and in
the process, documented and
rewrote African American cultural
myths and stereotypes associated

with particular geographies. In a re
cent video, "Roaming (Italian
Dreams)" (2006), Weems walks the
historic grounds of Rome in a black
dress, projecting her dark silhouette
onto vistas associated with Western
cultural legacy.

Collectively, her work interprets
and advocates for a more inclusive
historical record. As a performer,
photographer, videographer and po
et, she illuminates the invisible and
complicates the visible, raising ques
tions about how to holistically repre
sent human relationships, past and
present. While it's challenging to dis
till each of Weems' pieces, let alone
her retrospective style, to a central
idea, this is, perhaps, part of her
point: "We" are many. "We" are mys
tery.

the history of photography and the
social politics of camerawork. In
"Not Manet's Type" (1997), Weems
explores (and blurs) the lines be
tween muse and artist, the way a
photo is "taken" but a subject stays
unseen. To this end, she combines
text with images of images pho
tos of herself, naked, in a mirror. Her
captions ask us what it means to
study and be studied: "STANDING
ON SHAKY GROUND / I POSED
MYSELF FOR CRITICAL STUDY /
BUT WAS NO LONGER CERTAIN /
OF THE QUESTIONS TO ASK."

En route to answering her own
questions about questions, Weems
has traveled widely to Senegal,
Ghana and the Sea Islands and in
the process, documented and
rewrote African American cultural
myths and stereotypes associated

with particular geographies. In a re
cent video, "Roaming (Italian
Dreams)" (2006), Weems walks the
historic grounds of Rome in a black
dress, projecting her dark silhouette
onto vistas associated with Western
cultural legacy.

Collectively, her work interprets
and advocates for a more inclusive
historical record. As a performer,
photographer, videographer and po
et, she illuminates the invisible and
complicates the visible, raising ques
tions about how to holistically repre
sent human relationships, past and
present. While it's challenging to dis
till each of Weems' pieces, let alone
her retrospective style, to a central
idea, this is, perhaps, part of her
point: "We" are many. "We" are mys
tery.

Carrie Mae Weems, a 2013
Mac Arthur Grantee, received her
first camera for her 21st birthday.
Since then, she has used photogra
phy in conversation with sculpture,
poetry and video to bravely interro
gate issues of race, class and gender
in contemporary society.

"Carrie Mae Weems: Three
Decades of Photography and Video,"
a new exhibition at the Cantor Arts
Center and the artist's first major
retrospective, is the kind of exhibit
that stays with its visitors, reawaken
ing them to the complexity of hu
man nature.

The exhibition is organized

around three themes underlying
Weems' work: the construction of
identity, the power of place and the
legacy of history. Trained as a folk
lorist, dancer and photographer,
Weems is best known for her repre
sentation of the African American
experience but considers her work
universal. In a lecture to the Stan
ford community on Oct. 16, Weems
said that "race is, in some ways, just
the easiest thing to get from my
work... [ln my photos,] people of
color stand for the human multi
tudes."

"Colored People" (1989) is a
collection of portraits of black chil
dren, tinted to "blue black," "golden
yella" and "red bone" colors that

correspond with reductive labels.
Weems puns on the sociopolitical
'lens' through which we see and
name people, highlighting the spec
trum of color contained in the word
"black." In the exhibit, "Colored
People" is on display next to "Unti
tled (Colored People Grid)," which
Weems made almost 20 years later,
intermingling solid color prints and
portraits in a grid. The juxtaposition
of these two works suggests the per
sistence of these labels and their im
plications in a purportedly 'post
racial' American society.
Next door, "The Kitchen Table
Series" (1990), perhaps Weems'

best-known work, exposes the vari
ous identities that converge at a
kitchen table. In this series, as in
many of her pieces, Weems performs
as the protagonist, using her own
kitchen to stage the struggles be
tween sexes and generations for do
mestic power. In the photos, a single
light source illuminates the drama of
family the pressures posed by
monogamy, parenting and communal
responsibility —while 14 text pan
els weave the scenes into narrative.

In one of these pictures, "Man
Smoking," Weems is seated in front
of a poster of Malcolm X, playing
cards and sipping whisky with her
husband. The stakes of the interac
tion are palpable, begging the ques
tion, "Who moves next?" At the
same time, the focal point of the pic
ture is clear: The woman's gaze
its venom, seduction, dignity and
mostly, ambiguity is where the

picture starts and stops.
