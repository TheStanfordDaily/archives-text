# LENS FOCUSES ON BLACK

Carrie Mae Weems, a 2013
Mac Arthur Grantee, received her
first camera for her 21st birthday.
Since then, she has used photogra
phy in conversation with sculpture,
poetry and video to bravely interro
gate issues of race, class and gender
in contemporary society.

"Carrie Mae Weems: Three
Decades of Photography and Video,"
a new exhibition at the Cantor Arts
Center and the artist's first major
retrospective, is the kind of exhibit
that stays with its visitors, reawaken
ing them to the complexity of hu
man nature.

The exhibition is organized

around three themes underlying
Weems' work: the construction of
identity, the power of place and the
legacy of history. Trained as a folk
lorist, dancer and photographer,
Weems is best known for her repre
sentation of the African American
experience but considers her work
universal. In a lecture to the Stan
ford community on Oct. 16, Weems
said that "race is, in some ways, just
the easiest thing to get from my
work... [ln my photos,] people of
color stand for the human multi
tudes."

"Colored People" (1989) is a
collection of portraits of black chil
dren, tinted to "blue black," "golden
yella" and "red bone" colors that

correspond with reductive labels.
Weems puns on the sociopolitical
'lens' through which we see and
name people, highlighting the spec
trum of color contained in the word
"black." In the exhibit, "Colored
People" is on display next to "Unti
tled (Colored People Grid)," which
Weems made almost 20 years later,
intermingling solid color prints and
portraits in a grid. The juxtaposition
of these two works suggests the per
sistence of these labels and their im
plications in a purportedly 'post
racial' American society.
Next door, "The Kitchen Table
Series" (1990), perhaps Weems'
