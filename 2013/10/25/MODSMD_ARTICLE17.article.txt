# FASHION ON THE FARM: How Being Broke Can Work in Your Favor
## 
### KEYA TEKLU FASHION COLUMNIST 
Greetings, fellow fashionistas! As
we all know, fashion can get pretty
pricey. That cute pair of shoes you see
on display at your local Nordstrom's
could easily go for hundreds, if not
thousands, of dollars. As I was casually
flipping through the pages of my most
recent edition of "Teen Vogue," I came
across a pair of super cute, bright-or
ange Furstenberg pants. The pattern
was funky, and the model looked
amazing in them (of course), so I
glanced towards the bottom of the
page to catch the price. That was
when I saw it. These super cute,
bright-orange Furstenberg pants were
being sold to the tune of $375.
That, to me, is a joke. No matter
how beautiful or high quality or trendy
or cool these pants are, they are liter
ally just pants. Now, I'm not one to tell
people what they can and can't spend
their money on, but these days, fash

ion, especially street-style fashion,
doesn't have to be so expensive. In
fact, thanks to stores like Goodwill,
Savers, Salvation Army and Plato's
Closet, it can be rather inexpensive.
Thrift stores aren't just for
squares anymore; Macklemore's
smash hit "Thrift Shop" made thrifting
THE thing to do. Hipsters and fashion

istas alike (even Taylor Swift does it!
That means it has to be cool) have
been foregoing the racks of Dillard's
and Macy's in search of killer finds and
designer brands for a fraction of the
price. In the wonderful world of thrift
shopping, it pays to be poor.

But be warned. The prices are so discounted
that it can be easy to overbuy and end up with use
less clothes and trinkets that you will never end up
using. Don't worry, there's a method to this mad
ness. Here are some rules to live by when you're
on the hunt in a thrift shop.

1 . Know what you want. If you don't have a gen
eral list of the clothing items you might need, the
racks and racks of super cheap clothes will surely
overwhelm you. Stores like Goodwill or Salvation
Army receive clothes by the boatload, so just
"browsing" in a thrift store is next to impossible;
there is just too much stuff. Go into stores like
these with blinders on. Have a list of items you
need before you enter the store, so that the cheap
prices don't influence you to spend money on
something you'll never use. This will help you have
a much more pleasant shopping experience. That
being said, don't expect to find what you're look
ing for instantly. This leads to my next point.

2. Be prepared to spend a significant amount
of time at the thrift store. In true thrift shop
fashion, most stores carry dozens and dozens of
racks of clothes, each organized by clothing type.
Most of that stuff, however, you don't want. The
gems take time to find. Those Jimmy Choos that
are 90 percent off retail price? That North Face
jacket that's so cheap it's basically free? They aren't
going to jump at you as soon as your foot steps

through the door. If you want the good stuff, you
have to work for it. It seems like more of a hassle
than it's worth, but think of it as a scavenger hunt.
3. Designers aren't everything. While I did say
that the gems are hard to find, don't equate gems
with name brands. Just because the tag says BCBG
or J. Crew doesn't mean you need it, or even want
it. The name does not make the clothing; you
make the clothing. If it looks good on you, who
cares what the brand is? If it doesn't, don't buy it
just because of what you read on the tag. I guaran
tee you that people on the street won't see, or
even care, what name you're wearing; they'll sim
ply see howyou look in it. Obviously look for good
quality material, but don't assume that name
brands are always high quality, because that is def
initely not always the case.

4. Take the time to understand the layout of
the store. Each thrift store is different, and they
all like to organize their stores in different ways.
Some like to organize by color, some by size. Gen
erally though, thrift shops will split the store into
different departments (i.e. women's clothing,
men's clothing, shoes, accessories, etc.). From
there, the different departments will have clothing
separated by types, including short-sleeved shirts,
long-sleeved shirts, jeans, shorts, etc. Definitely
take the time to figure this out.

The whole point of a thrift shopping is to save
money and find steals; what could be more fun
than that? Have fun "poppin' tags," fellow fashion
istas!
