# FASHION ON THE FARM: How Being Broke Can Work in Your Favor
## 
### KEYA TEKLU FASHION COLUMNIST 
Greetings, fellow fashionistas! As
we all know, fashion can get pretty
pricey. That cute pair of shoes you see
on display at your local Nordstrom's
could easily go for hundreds, if not
thousands, of dollars. As I was casually
flipping through the pages of my most
recent edition of "Teen Vogue," I came
across a pair of super cute, bright-or
ange Furstenberg pants. The pattern
was funky, and the model looked
amazing in them (of course), so I
glanced towards the bottom of the
page to catch the price. That was
when I saw it. These super cute,
bright-orange Furstenberg pants were
being sold to the tune of $375.
That, to me, is a joke. No matter
how beautiful or high quality or trendy
or cool these pants are, they are liter
ally just pants. Now, I'm not one to tell
people what they can and can't spend
their money on, but these days, fash

ion, especially street-style fashion,
doesn't have to be so expensive. In
fact, thanks to stores like Goodwill,
Savers, Salvation Army and Plato's
Closet, it can be rather inexpensive.
Thrift stores aren't just for
squares anymore; Macklemore's
smash hit "Thrift Shop" made thrifting
THE thing to do. Hipsters and fashion

istas alike (even Taylor Swift does it!
That means it has to be cool) have
been foregoing the racks of Dillard's
and Macy's in search of killer finds and
designer brands for a fraction of the
price. In the wonderful world of thrift
shopping, it pays to be poor.
