# Roxy Sass: Roxy's Nobel Prizes... in the bedroom
## 
### 
October is one of Roxy's
favorite months, and
not just because of the
naughty costume she
has planned for Hal
loween. It's also Nobel
Prize announcement season

and you know there are
few things Roxy appreciates
more than a bunch of tall,
blonde Scandinavians with
hearts (and pockets full) of
gold. This year, as you may
have heard, one of Stanford's
own professors won the prize
in chemistry. Well, Roxy
would like to take this oppor
tunity to give out some prizes
of her own... and reward a
different kind of chemistry.

Physics: Roxy got a bit ahead
of herself and awarded this
prize last month at Sig Chi's
Let's Get Physical Party to all
the frosh who rolled out hard
in 'Bos athletic gear. She could
never resist the mating call of
brightly colored spandex and
high socks...

Medicine: Roxy is a diehard
fan of the ancient tradition of
"hair of the dog," so her prize
for medicine has to go to the
GSB Coupa. Their bottomless
mimosas are Roxy's go-to rem
edy for Sunday morning hang
overs staking out a table in
the sunny courtyard with a
continually refilled carafe is a
great way to stave off that
headache ... and that p-set.
Literature: Roxy would like

to recognize all the people
who have written graffiti in
the back corner of the Green
stacks Roxy has spent
many an afternoon appreciat
ing the fine prose while en
gaged in other... scholarly...
pursuits. (Pro tip: Check out
the archaeology section
it's usually deserted ... and a
great place to get a little
dirty).

Chemistry: Roxy's gotta give
this one to all the hot-and-heavy
couples who took over the
quad earlier this week at Full
Moon. You guys proved the sci
entific laws of attraction and
made everyone around you un
comfortable â€”with your ag
gressive midnight make-outs.
Extra points to the body-paint
ed folk who contributed some
acrylic chemicals to the cele
bration.

Peace: Finally, Roxy would
like to award this last prize to
whoever got her next door
neighbor and her boyfriend to
stop fighting. Nothing is a
worse cockblock than a loud ar
gument Roxy's sex life (and
sleep schedule) appreciate the
cessation of late-night hostili
ties.

Roxy is already accepting nom
inations for next year's prizes,
and she's not above a little bit
of friendly persuasion (in fact,
she prefers to be be10w...).
