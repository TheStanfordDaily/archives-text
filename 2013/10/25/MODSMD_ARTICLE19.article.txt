# Winchester Hell House
## A
						look at the Bay's spookiest haunt 
### MARY CAROLE OVERHOLT 
When in search of ghouls, goblins and su
pernatural spirits, Bay Area residents
know where to go: the Winchester Mys
tery House.

In honor of Halloween, we're taking a look at
the architecture of this spooky dwelling. Built in
the late 1800s, the haunted house reflects the
restless premonitions of the Northeastern so
cialite Sarah Winchester, who, upon the death of
her daughter, took the advice of a Boston medium
to appease vengeful spirits by building an estate
in San Jose, Calif. The form and function of the
Victorian building play the most vital role in craft
ing a spine-chilling atmosphere.
The Winchester Mystery House is a window
into the disturbed psyche of Mrs. Winchester
herself. Surrounded by trees, the house seems
isolated from the public spaces nearby. It contains
an intricate labyrinth of hallways, and numerous
secret doors served as a means by which Mrs.
Winchester avoided being stalked by ghosts when
traveling from room to room.

Functionless architectural features dominate
the house as tools of deception for dangerous
spirits. There are stairs that lead to ceilings, doors
that open to solid walls and chimneys that do not
extend to the exterior of the house. Even though
the average viewer would consider these archi
tectural elements useless, they served a distinct,
protective purpose for Sarah Winchester.
Though large in scale with imposing tall tow
ers and high-pitched rooflines, Victorian buildings
are usually planned with many small rooms, hall
ways and chambers. In the Winchester Mystery
House, this combination creates a sense of en
trapment and overwhelms the individual living or
visiting inside. Unlike modern, open-plan archi

tecture, Victorian architecture has the ability to
tap into a basic human fear: not knowing what is
on the other side of the wall. Though the Win
chester Mystery House demands a considerable
amount of upkeep because of old age, its outmod
ed details have remained unchanged.
Today's haunted houses, from your local tem
porary structure to the more permanent Win
chester Mystery House, attempt to recreate the
isolation, old age and secret spaces that character
ized Victorian homes and made them exude a
frightening aura. Such architecture conjures up
the image of eerie fictional homes, like that of
