## BALANCING ACT Levitt juggles award-winning research with family and advising work 
### KIMBERLYTAN 
According to Michael Levitt, the last
prize he won was in 1986 the last
prize, that is, before he won the 2013 No
bel Prize in Chemistry "for the develop
ment of multiscale models for complex
chemical systems."
"My work is about developing models
that make it possible to do simulations of
the very large molecules that are responsi
ble for most brain processes," Levitt ex
plained. "You can do calculations if you
have a good model, which enables you to
see how the shape would change with
time, basically letting you understand the
fundamental building blocks of life."
Although Levitt is humble about his
award, to his colleagues, the award was no
surprise.
"Michael is a great scientist," said
Roger Kornberg Ph.D '72, professor of
structural biology at the Stanford School of
Medicine and recipient of the 2006 Nobel
Prize in Chemistry. "He won the prize for
founding the field of computational biolo
gy and leading it up to the present day. He
is also a wonderful person the prize
could not go to a nicer guy."
Balancing family and work
Levitt's Nobel Prize, which he shared
with two other researchers, was a culmina
tion of years of dedication to science.
"From a very early age he showed an
advanced ability to learn and understand
mathematics and an interest in investigat
ing and experimenting," stated Levitt's

mother, Gertrude, in an email to The Dai
ly. "He has excellent manual dexterity and
could visualize and build models out of
'scrap' he found. Science, investigation
and experimentation were just part of his
daily activities."

Even though she lives in London,
Levitt remains close to his mother, who is
now 98 years old.

"Michael phoned me as soon as he
heard that he had been jointly awarded the
Nobel Prize," Gertrude Levitt wrote. "I
was, and am, very delighted but not sur
prised. More surprised that it had taken so
long for his work to be recognized!"
This dedication, however, can at
times be all-consuming, and Michael
Levitt credited his wife of 45 years, Rina,
for her support.

"Balancing family and work is a difficult
thing," he said. "I think my family didn't
get as much as they deserved and Rina sort
of kept everyone together in a very posi
tive way there's no doubt that none of
this would've been possible without her."
Though his entire family moved from
Israel to Stanford with him in 1987, two of
Levitt's three sons have since returned to
Israel with their children. Rina, who is an
Israeli native, also spends large periods of
time in her home country. As a result,

Levitt has had to learn how to balance
keeping in touch with family with making
progress in research.
"One thing that I do is generally work
at home," he said. "The good thing about
this is that I'm actually there if someone
needs [me]. It's actually quite nice to be
able to do my work before everyone even
gets up."
Personal connection with students
In addition to his research, Levitt also
serves as a pre-major advisor (PMA) to
freshmen students.
"Initially, I was as confused as the in
coming freshmen were," he said, recalling
his first experience as a pre-major advisor
two years ago. "But we sort of got through
the first quarter together. And when they
all came back after the winter break, they
were like changed people, suddenly confi
dent and knowing what they wanted to do.
It was a great pleasure, so I agreed to take
on another six this year."

Working with students and post-doc
toral students is enjoyable to Levitt be
cause of the parallels between his students
and family. Levitt described the 30- to 40-
year-old post-doctorates in his lab as his

children's generation, and his pre-major ad
visees as his grandchildren's generation.
As a result, Levitt's interest in his stu
dents extends beyond academics to their per
sonal wellbeing. Peter Ruhm 'l7, one of
Levitt's advisees, said that when he met with
Levitt, they talked more about how to be hap
py at Stanford than about specific academic
classes and requirements.
"I get the feeling that he very much val
ues a balanced life," Ruhm said. "He dresses
very casually and hates dressing up. I barely
recognized him in a formal picture announc
ing the award."

Life since the prize
Winning the Nobel Prize has added com
plexities to Levitt's balanced life. He said he
answered almost 1500 emails in a day and
has received 60 invitations to visit places.
Levitt and his wife also had to push back a
hiking trip to Patagonia that was originally
planned for December.
"I somehow feel like I have to gone to a
banquet, and they keep bringing you one
course after another," he said. "After a
while, you wish you could just go back to sar
dines and toast. My main thing is to just try
and get through the next couple of months."
Levitt also said that he hasn't gotten
back to writing computer programs since
the award. While he said the attention can
be exhausting, he has been enjoying the
perks.

"I had lunch with [Stanford football
coach] David Shaw ['94] on Friday at Jimmy
V's," Levitt said. "It was nice because he was
super recognized and no one even paid any
attention to me, so that was wonderful."
Levitt followed up that event by attend
ing the Homecoming football game against
UCLA the next day the first football game
he's ever seen, either live or on television.
Before the fourth quarter, he and his family
were invited down to the field to be recog
nized.

"It was a very exciting game," he said.
"I'm sure I'm still very ignorant, but you
could certainly feel the excitement. When
we went onto the field me and Rina and
our oldest grandson, Barack the whole
stadium was screaming and cheering, 'Nobel
Prize! Nobel Prize!'"
