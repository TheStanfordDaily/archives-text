# Südhof wins Medicine Nobel
## Colleagues speak of passion and dedication to science

Thomas Siidhof was driving through the mid
dle of Spain when he received the phone call noti
fying him that he had been awarded one of the
most prestigious honors in his field, the Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
"I didn't expect it," said Siidhof, a professor of
molecular and cellular physiology at the Stanford
School of Medicine. "There are so many people
who deserve a Nobel Prize. There's no reason to
suspect that you're going to get it."
As unexpected as it was, Siidhof's wife Lu
Chen already knew about the award earlier that
morning, she had been the first to hear the news
from the committee.

"I was dying to tell him myself, but cell
phones display numbers. If he sees it's my number,
the surprise is already halfway gone," said Chen,
an associate professor of neurosurgery and of psy
chiatry and behavioral sciences, also at the School
of Medicine. "It's a historical moment in his life,
and no matter how much I'm tempted to [call him
myself], I don't have the right to deprive him of
that moment."
Siidhof received the award for his research on
how synapses affect communication between neu
rons within the brain.

"This [Nobel Prize] is about the work that we
performed over two and a half decades to discover
how a synapse speaks how, in a synapse, neuro
transmitters are released in response to a presy
naptic action potential," Siidhof explained.
Yet Siidhof did not always know he wanted to
go into science. He grew up the son of two physi
cians in Gottingen, Germany, and his father was al
so a professor of medicine.
"I had no particular interest in science when I
was a child or high school student," Siidhof said. "I
started to study medicine after high school be
cause I thought that would give me a lot of differ
ent possibilities... and because I liked the idea of
potentially doing something useful."
As a medical student, Siidhof became interest
ed in science and began working in a lab. In 1983,
he moved to the United States for post-doctoral
training and joined the laboratory of Michael
Brown and Joseph Goldstein at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Brown and
Goldstein were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physi
ology or Medicine in 1985, and a year later, Siidhof

started his own lab at UT Southwestern.
In 1993, Siidhof met Robert Malenka, a pro
fessor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at
Stanford and one of the main reasons why Siid
hof would eventually come to Palo Alto.
"I can tell you the exact date I first approached
him: June 1993, about 20 years ago," Malenka
said. "He had some genetically modified mice that
were lacking some proteins I was interested in."
Malenka was the chair of the search commit
tee for Stanford's Avram Goldstein endowed pro
fessorship and recruited Siidhof for the position in
2008.
"Tom was my number one draft choice be
cause I knew what a great scientist he was and I
knew what a good collaborator he was," Malenka
said.
Siidhof said that after being at Southwestern
for 25 years and serving as chair for the last 10
years of his tenure, he was ready for a new chal
lenge.
During his time at Stanford, Sudhof has re
ceived the 2010 Kavli Prize in neuroscience and
the 2013 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research
Award. Those who have worked with Siidhof attest
to his dedication and love of his research.

Thomas Südhof was taken by surprise when the
Nobel committee called to notify him of the honor.
His wife, Lu Chen, had already found out but
wanted to preserve the surprise for him.
