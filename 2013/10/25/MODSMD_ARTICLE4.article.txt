# Südhof wins Medicine Nobel
## Colleagues speak of passion and dedication to science 
### KYLIE JUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Thomas Siidhof was driving through the mid
dle of Spain when he received the phone call noti
fying him that he had been awarded one of the
most prestigious honors in his field, the Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
"I didn't expect it," said Siidhof, a professor of
molecular and cellular physiology at the Stanford
School of Medicine. "There are so many people
who deserve a Nobel Prize. There's no reason to
suspect that you're going to get it."
As unexpected as it was, Siidhof's wife Lu
Chen already knew about the award earlier that
morning, she had been the first to hear the news
from the committee.

"I was dying to tell him myself, but cell
phones display numbers. If he sees it's my number,
the surprise is already halfway gone," said Chen,
an associate professor of neurosurgery and of psy
chiatry and behavioral sciences, also at the School
of Medicine. "It's a historical moment in his life,
and no matter how much I'm tempted to [call him
myself], I don't have the right to deprive him of
that moment."
Siidhof received the award for his research on
how synapses affect communication between neu
rons within the brain.

"This [Nobel Prize] is about the work that we
performed over two and a half decades to discover
how a synapse speaks how, in a synapse, neuro
transmitters are released in response to a presy
naptic action potential," Siidhof explained.
Yet Siidhof did not always know he wanted to
go into science. He grew up the son of two physi
cians in Gottingen, Germany, and his father was al
so a professor of medicine.
"I had no particular interest in science when I
was a child or high school student," Siidhof said. "I
started to study medicine after high school be
cause I thought that would give me a lot of differ
ent possibilities... and because I liked the idea of
potentially doing something useful."
As a medical student, Siidhof became interest
ed in science and began working in a lab. In 1983,
he moved to the United States for post-doctoral
training and joined the laboratory of Michael
Brown and Joseph Goldstein at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Brown and
Goldstein were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physi
ology or Medicine in 1985, and a year later, Siidhof

started his own lab at UT Southwestern.
In 1993, Siidhof met Robert Malenka, a pro
fessor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at
Stanford and one of the main reasons why Siid
hof would eventually come to Palo Alto.
"I can tell you the exact date I first approached
him: June 1993, about 20 years ago," Malenka
said. "He had some genetically modified mice that
were lacking some proteins I was interested in."
Malenka was the chair of the search commit
tee for Stanford's Avram Goldstein endowed pro
fessorship and recruited Siidhof for the position in
2008.
"Tom was my number one draft choice be
cause I knew what a great scientist he was and I
knew what a good collaborator he was," Malenka
said.
Siidhof said that after being at Southwestern
for 25 years and serving as chair for the last 10
years of his tenure, he was ready for a new chal
lenge.
During his time at Stanford, Sudhof has re
ceived the 2010 Kavli Prize in neuroscience and
the 2013 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research
Award. Those who have worked with Siidhof attest
to his dedication and love of his research.

Thomas Südhof was taken by surprise when the
Nobel committee called to notify him of the honor.
His wife, Lu Chen, had already found out but
wanted to preserve the surprise for him.
"He is a force of nature,"
Malenka said. "He is driven in an
incredibly passionate and intense
way to understand how synapses
work. He will use every approach
and every method humanly possi
ble to attack the questions he's
interested in."

Although Sudhof's work has
uncovered specific proteins in
volved in synaptic transmission,
he encourages his lab to keep the
big, overarching questions in
mind. Garret Anderson, a post
doctoral research fellow who
works with both Malenka and
Sudhof, spoke about Sudhof's at
tention to detail while still focus
ing on the larger picture.
"Tom is a very detailed
man," Anderson said. "He's never
satisfied with easy, quick, dirty
experiments; he's more interest
ed in very broad questions, and
figuring out the true mechanisms
of what's going on."
Lulu Chen, another of Siid
hof's postdoctoral research fel
lows, described her first time
meeting Sudhof. After her inter
view with him, she knew on the
spot that she wanted to work in
his lab.

"I told him I want to play sci
ence. I want to enjoy research.
The only reason that I'm doing
postdoc [work] is because I love

it," Lulu Chen said. "Tom's an
swer was, 'Lulu, if I'm not having
fun, I don't know why I wake up
in the morning.'... That was the
reason I made the decision."
Remnants of Siidhof's sur
prise congratulatory party with all
three labs Siidhof's, Malen
ka's and Lu Chen's still deco
rated the area outside the labs 11
days after the Nobel Prize an
nouncement. Lulu Chen ex
plained that Siidhof's generosity
and fairness help create the posi
tive atmosphere in the lab.

"You would think that some
body like him would be so busy,
but you can see we don't have
that problem here," Lulu Chen
said. "Anytime we want to talk to
him, he's always there."
The labs' annual group activ
ities include a summer beach day,
Secret Santa and dumplings at
Sudhof's house. According to Lu
lu Chen, Sudhof also holds a
weekly journal club for all three
labs.

"He reads a paper; in proba
bly five minutes he gets every
thing, and he has all the historical
background," Lulu Chen said.
"But he'll sit there, spend one
whole hour with 50 of us, and
then go through it."

Given Siidhof's patience and
kindness, Lulu Chen said that she
has never heard him yell at any
body and explained that he en
courages lab members to explore
any ideas that interest them. An
derson also spoke about Siidhof's

openness to failure.
"What I think I've gained the
most from Tom is the freedom to
develop big stories," Anderson
said. "I enjoy that freedom to
think big and not be afraid of proj
ects failing."

And in addition to the time
he spends at the lab, Siidhof also
balances family time with Lu
Chen and their two young chil
dren, ages three and four.
"As it turned out, I have
small kids now, which at my age
is unusual," Siidhof said. "Right
now, my passion outside of my re
search is to spend as much time
with them as possible."
According to Lu Chen, her
husband has advice for the next
generation of scientists.
"He said, 'Read classical liter
ature; don't only read the trendy
publications,"' Lu Chen said. "I
think that's very important ad
vice. If you want to find an impor
tant topic in science, don't always
follow the trend."

Even with his many accom
plishments, Siidhof has not made
plans to retire any time soon.
"I find this really very exhila
rating: to be a professor and to do
science," Siidhof said. "The prob
lems and the questions that we
are facing as scientists are so in
teresting and so challenging that I
wouldn't think of not going after
them."
