# 2013 awards bring Stanford's Nobel tally to 31
## 
### SABELLE SMYTHE STAFF WRITER 
With the latest crop of Nobel prizes an
nounced this month, Stanford raised its num
ber of Nobel laureates by two, putting the
count at conservatively—3l.
While deciding what constitutes a strong
enough connection to Stanford to add a
prizewinner to the tally can be difficult, the
University has 22 laureates on the current
faculty, with another nine deceased.
This year alone, Michael Levitt, profes
sor of structural biology at the School of Med
icine, shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
with two other scientists, while Thomas Siid
hof, professor of molecular and cellular phys
iology at the School of Medicine, was one of
three researchers to earn the Nobel Prize for
Physiology or Medicine.
"I think the consistency of excellence
here is really quite unique," said Lloyd Minor,
dean of the School of Medicine. "I also think
that the drive to tackle the most difficult
problems to tackle the problems that oth
ers shy away from, because they are difficult,
and because we don't know where they're
going to go in terms of the solutions I
think that drive is unique to Stanford."
To what degree the sciences at Stanford
are unique in their success, however, is con
tentious.

"There are at least 25 great universities
and research institutes around the world, all
of comparable quality," said Roger Kornberg
Ph.D "72, professor of structural biology at
the Stanford School of Medicine and recipi
ent of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
"Stanford is certainly among the very fine
ones, but there are many others, and we
mustn't lose sight of that."
Harvard, for example, counts 48 Nobel
laureates as current or former faculty mem
bers; Princeton counts 22 and UC Berkeley
has eight current and 14 deceased faculty
members who won the prize.
Further, counting the number of affiliat
ed Nobel laureates can be difficult, as some
schools include Nobel laureates who have
studied or researched on their campuses,
even if they are not faculty.
According to Stanford's Nobel Prize
website, Stanford "lists but does not claim
laureates who are not on the faculty, even if

they have a significant Stanford connec
tion." Stanford also does not list winners
with more tenuous connections, such as
John Steinbeck, the 1962 literature winner
who dropped out of the University twice.
People on campus believe there are
certain factors that have contributed to the
culture of success at Stanford.

"I think that our spirit of interdiscipli
nary collaboration is unique to Stanford, at
least insofar as how extensively it's mani
fested," Minor said. "At Stanford, we're at
tracted to the problems that require the
most innovative approaches at solutions,
and our faculty are doing this every day.
They're making fundamental contributions
to scientific inquiry on so many different
fronts."

Brian Kobilka, professor and chair of
molecular and cellular physiology at the
School of Medicine, said that the physical
environment at Stanford is conducive to
promoting cutting-edge research.

"One important aspect is the relatively
small size of Stanford, in that we're in a ge
ographically very defined area," said Kobil
ka, who won the 2012 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry. "We can walk from the Medical
School to physics or chemistry on Main
Campus, and that creates opportunities for
cross-disciplinary collaboration."
The caliber of the people at Stanford
can also create a cycle of success. Kornberg
pointed out that Stanford is often able to re
cruit excellent students, post-doctoral fel
lows and faculty based on the strength of
the people already here.
"It's worth bearing in mind that many
of the prizes that have been awarded here
are based on work done at other universi
ties and then, on the basis of their fine
work, were recruited to join the faculty
here," Kornberg said.
Although community members are
proud of Stanford's Nobel recognition, they
do not consider it the universal measure of

success.
"Both those who view the process from
the outside and those who are recipients of
the awards should remember that there are
many really fine scientists, both at Stanford
and elsewhere, who never actually got this
prize," Kornberg said. "That doesn't dimin
ish the magnitude of their contributions."
With the latest batch of Nobel Prizes
added to a growing list, the idea that these
prizes ought to be considered with a degree
of humility was a recurring one.
"It's really humbling," Minor said, "be
cause these accomplishments of course are
wonderful, and these accolades are very well
earned and deserved by our faculty, but we
know that we have to live up to the reputa
tion established by these accolades. So it chal
lenges us every day to recommit ourselves to
excellence."

schools include Nobel laureates who have
studied or researched on their campuses,
even if they are not faculty.
According to Stanford's Nobel Prize
website, Stanford "lists but does not claim
laureates who are not on the faculty, even if

they have a significant Stanford connec
tion." Stanford also does not list winners
with more tenuous connections, such as
John Steinbeck, the 1962 literature winner
who dropped out of the University twice.
People on campus believe there are
certain factors that have contributed to the
culture of success at Stanford.

"I think that our spirit of interdiscipli
nary collaboration is unique to Stanford, at
least insofar as how extensively it's mani
fested," Minor said. "At Stanford, we're at
tracted to the problems that require the
most innovative approaches at solutions,
and our faculty are doing this every day.
They're making fundamental contributions
to scientific inquiry on so many different
fronts."

Brian Kobilka, professor and chair of
molecular and cellular physiology at the
School of Medicine, said that the physical
environment at Stanford is conducive to
promoting cutting-edge research.

"One important aspect is the relatively
small size of Stanford, in that we're in a ge
ographically very defined area," said Kobil
ka, who won the 2012 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry. "We can walk from the Medical
School to physics or chemistry on Main
Campus, and that creates opportunities for
cross-disciplinary collaboration."
The caliber of the people at Stanford
can also create a cycle of success. Kornberg
pointed out that Stanford is often able to re
cruit excellent students, post-doctoral fel
lows and faculty based on the strength of
the people already here.
"It's worth bearing in mind that many
of the prizes that have been awarded here
are based on work done at other universi
ties and then, on the basis of their fine
work, were recruited to join the faculty
here," Kornberg said.
Although community members are
proud of Stanford's Nobel recognition, they
do not consider it the universal measure of

success.
"Both those who view the process from
the outside and those who are recipients of
the awards should remember that there are
many really fine scientists, both at Stanford
and elsewhere, who never actually got this
prize," Kornberg said. "That doesn't dimin
ish the magnitude of their contributions."
With the latest batch of Nobel Prizes
added to a growing list, the idea that these
prizes ought to be considered with a degree
of humility was a recurring one.
"It's really humbling," Minor said, "be
cause these accomplishments of course are
wonderful, and these accolades are very well
earned and deserved by our faculty, but we
know that we have to live up to the reputa
tion established by these accolades. So it chal
lenges us every day to recommit ourselves to
excellence."

After Südhof was awarded the Nobel Prize, researchers from his lab, his wife Lu Chen's lab and his colleague Robert Malenka's lab
came together to celebrate. According to faculty, the collaborative environment at Stanford helps promote cutting-edge research.
With the latest crop of Nobel prizes an
nounced this month, Stanford raised its num
ber of Nobel laureates by two, putting the
count at conservatively—3l.
While deciding what constitutes a strong
enough connection to Stanford to add a
prizewinner to the tally can be difficult, the
University has 22 laureates on the current
faculty, with another nine deceased.
This year alone, Michael Levitt, profes
sor of structural biology at the School of Med
icine, shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
with two other scientists, while Thomas Siid
hof, professor of molecular and cellular phys
iology at the School of Medicine, was one of
three researchers to earn the Nobel Prize for
Physiology or Medicine.
"I think the consistency of excellence
here is really quite unique," said Lloyd Minor,
dean of the School of Medicine. "I also think
that the drive to tackle the most difficult
problems to tackle the problems that oth
ers shy away from, because they are difficult,
and because we don't know where they're
going to go in terms of the solutions I
think that drive is unique to Stanford."
To what degree the sciences at Stanford
are unique in their success, however, is con
tentious.

"There are at least 25 great universities
and research institutes around the world, all
of comparable quality," said Roger Kornberg
Ph.D "72, professor of structural biology at
the Stanford School of Medicine and recipi
ent of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
"Stanford is certainly among the very fine
ones, but there are many others, and we
mustn't lose sight of that."
Harvard, for example, counts 48 Nobel
laureates as current or former faculty mem
bers; Princeton counts 22 and UC Berkeley
has eight current and 14 deceased faculty
members who won the prize.
