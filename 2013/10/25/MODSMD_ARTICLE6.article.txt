## The Greeks, Co-ops and Gender
### Maddy Sides 
When people ask what I think of my
new living situation on campus,
words like "incredible," "lovely,"
and "surreal" quickly fly out of my mouth.
For the co-op curious, I often elaborate on
how cooking in our kitchen works, why we
have a jobs system and how enjoyable it is to
have five roommates.

Friends from earlier years at Stanford
are quick to point out that my housing
choice must be "pretty different" from
places I have lived before. Indeed, moving
into a co-op and out of my sorority house
has marked a meaningful transition in my ex
perience at Stanford and has changed the
way I look at other aspects of my life.

The visible differences between the
Greek and co-op communities at Stanford
range from house food options and the phys
ical layout of the house to resident's lifestyle
choices and the type of social events that
draw the communities together.
Yet, I have found that the most mean
ingful distinctions between these communi
ties are the ones you can't see. In making my
transition from a Greek house to a co-op, I
have been particularly struck by the differ
ence in how these two communities influ
ence their members' perception of gender
roles.

Unspoken rules dictate the interactions
between men and women in Greek social
settings on campus. There is a prepro
grammed set of behaviors and practices
based on a person's gender that Greek or
ganizations have slowly adopted over time.
These social norms about gender weaken
our Greek community and hinder the forma
tion of healthy friendships and romantic re
lationships.
I found the topic of sex to be rarely dis
cussed in an open, healthy way in Greek
communities, even though it is a strong so
cial undercurrent. Greek men and women
often appear in social settings primarily as
representatives of their gender and gen
dered house rather than unique individuals.
Not only is this trend stiflingly hetero
normative, but it also cements into place
somewhat traditional roles for men and
women in social contexts. Greek men live in

a certain region of campus and Greek
women in another. These groups are mixed
in large numbers only when women are in
vited over to fraternities to party.
This practice in itself is not concerning,
but the antiquated gender roles sustained by
some pockets of the Greek system make it
seemingly okay to have parties titled "CEOs
and Office Hoes." This type of event is sur
prising to find at a forward-thinking univer
sity like Stanford and is incredibly disre
spectful to its female students.
On the other end of the social spec
trum, co-ops facilitate a gender neutral
space that I have found cultivates healthy
friendships and relationships between its
community members of all genders. The
house environment feels safe and open to
individuals of any gender identity or sexual
orientation.

Gender feels somewhat irrelevant in a
co-op as residents, we all do the same
house jobs, live in the same rooms and have
the same responsibilities to the community.
A co-op house can host an event like body
painting for Full Moon, which invites a spec
trum of nudity, and the event vibe feels free
and playful, not sexualized and uncomfort
able.

This is not to say that the co-op commu
nity is perfect and the Greek system is en

tirely flawed. I have met remarkable young
women in Greek life that have pushed me to
believe more in myself and my abilities as a
female student.
I appreciate the strong community of
smart, successful women that my sorority
has created. However, Stanford social cul
ture, particularly in the Greek system, has a
long way to go to catch up to progress that
the University has made in other dimen
sions.

What can we, as students, do to foster
healthy, gender-neutral attitudes in our com
munities?

I encourage you to think critically about
who tells you how to view your own gender
and the role they say you should play be
cause of it. If certain communities make you
feel more aware or uncomfortable about
your gender identity, say something.
I encourage you to also think about your
future housing options while a co-op
may not be for everyone, I believe that hous
ing options that bring genders together in
safe, open spaces cultivates a stronger com
munity and a healthier view of self.
We are all students, we are all humans.
The challenges and joys of being human that
we all share transcend gender.
