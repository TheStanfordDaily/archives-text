SAM FISHER
STANFORD 38, OREGON STATE 23:
Stanford turned a corner against the Bruins. Had the
Cardinal faltered on Saturday, this season could've got
ten ugly. But based on what I saw Saturday, I can't see
Stanford falling to any team besides Oregon the rest of
the regular season. Oregon State has a high-powered
offense, but its strength drop-back passing plays
right into Stanford's #Partyinthebackfield plans. And on
the other side of the ball, I'm not sure the Beavers
could stop Palo Alto High School quarterback (and
Stanford commit) Keller Chryst from putting up 30
points right now. Stanford comes out with a vengeance
in front of a loud Oregon State Homecoming crowd,
taking a big lead early and forcing the Beavers to settle
for field goals in the red zone. The Card wins 38-23
and begins watching film of Oregon on the flight home.
GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 35, OREGON STATE 24:

Sean Mannion is a talented quarterback, but the amaz
ing numbers that he's put up so far this season have
come mostly against cupcake teams. He's good, but
he's not Marcus Mariota-good. Oregon State will be
able to find the end zone a few times in front of a row
dy crowd in Corvallis, but I expect the Cardinal de
fense to hold its ground for most of the game. It's been
a while since Stanford a faced a true drop-back quar
terback, so the front seven will relish the chance to
pass rush without having to worry too much about the
quarterback scrambling. I also think the Cardinal of
fense is finally hitting its stride by finding the right bal
ance between running and passing. The Beavers will
make it close early on, but Stanford will pull away in
the third quarter to set up the highly anticipated Nov. 7
showdown against mighty Oregon.
DO-HYOUNG PARK
STANFORD 41, OREGON STATE 21:
Mannion is one of the elite quarterbacks in the country,
and he has the talent around him to make a big splash
in the Pac-12. However, OSU's offense under the re
vamped Mannion is much too one-dimensional to gash
Stanford's defense. The Beavers are averaging 2.6
yards per rush this season and have passed the ball
almost twice as much as they have run it. When Stan
ford's defense isn't kept off-balance by a diverse at
tack, it has playmakers who can pin their ears back
and make big plays. Stanford beat another pass-happy
team in Washington State by almost 40 points. Expect
it to be closer in the more hostile environment of Cor
vallis, and don't be surprised if the Beavers move the
ball well, but Stanford should jump out to an early lead
against a weak Beaver defense and cruise to the end.
