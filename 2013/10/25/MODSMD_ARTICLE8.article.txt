## Pass-happy Beavers to test Card 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
This time last year, both the Oregon
State Beavers and Stanford Cardinal were
without established quarterbacks going into
their matchup at Stanford Stadium. For the
Cardinal, redshirt freshman quarterback
Kevin Hogan would make his first career
start against the Beavers, while Oregon State
would counter with Cody Vaz, half of the
quarterback tandem that led the Beavers' of
fense.

What a difference a year makes.
In Corvallis, Cody Vaz is no more and
Sean Mannion has emerged as one of the
premier quarterbacks in the country. Under

Mannion, the high-flying Beavers offense
currently leads the nation in passing with an
eye-popping 442 yards per game and is also
top-10 in the nation in scoring with 44
points per game.
In Stanford's corner, junior Kevin
Hogan now has a full season's worth of starts
under his belt and has weathered every chal
lenge ranked teams have thrown at him, to
the tune of a perfect 7-0 record against top
-25 teams, a Pac-12 championship and a Rose
Bowl victory.

and No. 25 Oregon State (6-1, 4-0) clash in
Corvallis on Saturday, Hogan and Mannion

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal hopes to stymie the
Beavers' nation-leading passing attack, which is
led by quarterback Sean Mannion and wide
receiver Brandon Cooks. Oregon State, mean
while, has the chance to pass Stanford as Ore
gon's top competitor in the Pac-12 North. The
Beavers are perfect since losing their season
opener to Eastern Washington, an FCS school.

Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan (center) bounced back from two poor performances with an efficient 18-for-25 passing clip against UCLA.
He will need to remain composed in the pocket once again as the Cardinal travels to the hostile Reser Stadium to face Oregon State.
will each be trying to firmly estab
lish their teams as the top chal
lenger to the No. 3 Oregon Ducks
in the Pac-12 North.

The game will be an opportuni
ty for the Beavers to prove them
selves on a national stage against a
true top-10 team and a stingy de
fense with the skill and talent of
Stanford's defense. Although the
Beavers have the same record as
the Cardinal at 6-1, Oregon State
has yet to face a top-25 team and
even dropped its first game of the
season to FCS foe Eastern Washing
ton.

Despite the struggles of the
team, Mannion has had a first half
of the season for the ages. Leading
a pass-oriented Oregon State of
fense, the junior has already passed
for 2,992 yards and 29 touchdowns
with just three interceptions and
ranks seventh in the nation in quar
terback rating. He has yet to throw
for fewer than 367 yards in any of
his games and has completed nearly
70 percent of his passes this season
in a varied passing game that looks to
challenge the Cardinal defense more
than a traditional scheme.

"They've got a great play-action
scheme and the offensive line is
playing really well," said Cardinal
head coach David Shaw. "They make
you play honest, though, because
they have so much... You have to ac
count for the screen game. You have
to account for the fly sweep. You
have to account for the draw, for the
spread draw, for the toss runs. So
there's so much you have to account
for so that you can't just pass rush."
Most of the Beavers' passes have
gone to junior wide receiver Brandin
Cooks, who has followed up a break
out sophomore season with an ab
solutely stellar first half of 2013.
Cooks has already reeled in 76 passes
for 1,176 yards and 12 touchdowns
over a third of the Beavers' pro
duction through the air.
"They've done some really im
pressive things this year," said fifth
year senior defensive end Ben Gard

ner. "Things that we haven't seen
from Oregon State in the past. Man
nion and Cooks have been, really,
the best combination in the country
so far... it's our job to make sure
they're not in the Heisman conversa
tion the week after we play them."
Disrupting the seamless chem
istry between Mannion and Cooks
will be essential for the Cardinal de
fense to put a stopper in the power
ful Oregon State offense. The Car
dinal has been trying to emulate
Cooks' on-field performance with a
revolving door of receivers on the
practice field, but the secondary
will be met with one of its toughest
challenges of the season when it
meets the real Cooks on the field on
Saturday.

While the secondary attempts
to put pressure on Cooks, Gardner
and the defensive line will look to
pressure Mannion one of the
few drop-back, pocket-passing quar
terbacks remaining in the Pac-12

to ensure that the ball never makes
it as far as Cooks.
"The back end and the front
end really have to work together,"

Gardner said. "It's got to be tight
coverage in the back end to allow us
to get home and put pressure on
[Mannion] and we've got to make
sure that we're getting there so that
those guys don't have to hold onto
their coverage for too 10ng... I think
it suits our defense well."

After a shutdown performance
against UCLA last weekend in which
the powerful Bruin offense was held
to less than half of its usual output,
the defense has reason to be confi
dent moving into a game against an
offense with a much more one-di
mensional offensive game plan.
Although the Beavers' lack of a
running game could impair them to
an extent on Saturday, an even more
significant weakness on the Oregon
State squad is its lackluster defen
sive play â€”a surprising flaw in a
team that was among the top defen
sive squads in the conference last
season.

With Hogan having recovered
his pocket presence last week
against UCLA and senior running
back Tyler Gaffney coming off a ca
reer day, Stanford should have no

trouble moving the ball all evening.
Without junior wide receiver Devon
Cajuste, who is out with a knee in
jury, the Cardinal will still need a re
ceiver to step up to complement jun
ior Ty Montgomery's explosive po
tential.

It was also announced that sen
ior placekicker Jordan Williamson
would miss Saturday's game after a
nagging injury that also sidelined
him last week against UCLA. Sopho
more Conrad Ukropina, who con
verted all three extra points and was
l-of-2 on field goals, will kick in his
place until Williamson's expected
return for the Oregon game.
As the final challenge on the
Cardinal's schedule before its colli
sion with No. 3 Oregon on Nov. 7,
Oregon State will be looking to play
spoiler against a Stanford team that
needs as much momentum as pos
sible heading into its game of the
year. Kickoff at Reser Stadium in
Corvallis is set for 7:30 p.m. with
television coverage on ESPN.

Junior Wayne Lyons (bottom) and his fellow corner, Alex Carter, will be tasked with shutting down the nation's
most productive passing attack. Beavers receiver Brandin Cooks has compiled 1,176 yards in just seven games.
