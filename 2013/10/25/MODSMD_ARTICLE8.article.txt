## Pass-happy Beavers to test Card 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
This time last year, both the Oregon
State Beavers and Stanford Cardinal were
without established quarterbacks going into
their matchup at Stanford Stadium. For the
Cardinal, redshirt freshman quarterback
Kevin Hogan would make his first career
start against the Beavers, while Oregon State
would counter with Cody Vaz, half of the
quarterback tandem that led the Beavers' of
fense.

What a difference a year makes.
In Corvallis, Cody Vaz is no more and
Sean Mannion has emerged as one of the
premier quarterbacks in the country. Under

Mannion, the high-flying Beavers offense
currently leads the nation in passing with an
eye-popping 442 yards per game and is also
top-10 in the nation in scoring with 44
points per game.
In Stanford's corner, junior Kevin
Hogan now has a full season's worth of starts
under his belt and has weathered every chal
lenge ranked teams have thrown at him, to
the tune of a perfect 7-0 record against top
-25 teams, a Pac-12 championship and a Rose
Bowl victory.

When No. 6 Stanford (6-1, 4-1 Pac-12)
and No. 25 Oregon State (6-1, 4-0) clash in
Corvallis on Saturday, Hogan and Mannion

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal hopes to stymie the
Beavers' nation-leading passing attack, which is
led by quarterback Sean Mannion and wide
receiver Brandon Cooks. Oregon State, mean
while, has the chance to pass Stanford as Ore
gon's top competitor in the Pac-12 North. The
Beavers are perfect since losing their season
opener to Eastern Washington, an FCS school.

Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan (center) bounced back from two poor performances with an efficient 18-for-25 passing clip against UCLA.
He will need to remain composed in the pocket once again as the Cardinal travels to the hostile Reser Stadium to face Oregon State.
