# BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DAILY BAROMETER

### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's football game be
tween Stanford and Oregon State, The Dai
ly's Winston Shi chatted with Andrew Kil
strom of The Daily Barometer, Oregon State's
student newspaper, to get perspective from
both camps. Below is a partial transcript of
their conversation. For a more complete tran
script of their back-andforth, go to www.stan

Winston Shi (WS): Oregon State has one loss.
What happened with Eastern Washington?
Andrew Kilstrom (AK): Last time Oregon State
lost to an FCS team was in 2011, when it dropped
its opener to Sacramento State. That OSU team
ended up finishing 3-9, so it was full-blown panic
mode in Corvallis. What it came down to was an
injured defense that wasn't ready for a live test.
OSU kept Eastern Washington off the scoreboard
on only one possession the entire game. Since
then the defense has been progressively better, is
as healthy as it's been and looks to be formidable
at this point. So what it really comes down to is
just experience and getting everything in sync, I'd
say. That's the word from defensive coordinator
Mike Banker and the defense, at least.
WS: Do you think that OSU's front seven has the
talent and the depth up front to match Stanford's
offensive line?
AK: Good question. I think the starters definitely
do. There's a ton of speed and even some NFL tal
ent there. Scott Chrichton is going to be drafted
in the first round, Dylan Wynn is a stud and D.J.
Alexander is one of the most talented players in
the conference. The depth is a huge area of con
cern, however. After the first unit, it's pretty thin.
OSU has managed good pressure all year, and is
defending the run well as of late, but can be vul
nerable. The Beavers can hang for a while, but
whether they can hold for four quarters is a differ
ent story. Stanford is by far OSU's best competi
tion it's faced all year.
WS: How are the Beavers doing in a post-Jordan
Poyer world? Can they match up with Stanford's
wideouts?
AK: Junior-college transfer Steven Nelson has
