# BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DAILY BAROMETER

### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's football game be
tween Stanford and Oregon State, The Dai
ly's Winston Shi chatted with Andrew Kil
strom of The Daily Barometer, Oregon State's
student newspaper, to get perspective from
both camps. Below is a partial transcript of
their conversation. For a more complete tran
script of their back-andforth, go to www.stan
forddaily. com/category/sports.
Winston Shi (WS): Oregon State has one loss.
What happened with Eastern Washington?
Andrew Kilstrom (AK): Last time Oregon State
lost to an FCS team was in 2011, when it dropped
its opener to Sacramento State. That OSU team
ended up finishing 3-9, so it was full-blown panic
mode in Corvallis. What it came down to was an
injured defense that wasn't ready for a live test.
OSU kept Eastern Washington off the scoreboard
on only one possession the entire game. Since
then the defense has been progressively better, is
as healthy as it's been and looks to be formidable
at this point. So what it really comes down to is
just experience and getting everything in sync, I'd
say. That's the word from defensive coordinator
Mike Banker and the defense, at least.
WS: Do you think that OSU's front seven has the
talent and the depth up front to match Stanford's
offensive line?
AK: Good question. I think the starters definitely
do. There's a ton of speed and even some NFL tal
ent there. Scott Chrichton is going to be drafted
in the first round, Dylan Wynn is a stud and D.J.
Alexander is one of the most talented players in
the conference. The depth is a huge area of con
cern, however. After the first unit, it's pretty thin.
OSU has managed good pressure all year, and is
defending the run well as of late, but can be vul
nerable. The Beavers can hang for a while, but
whether they can hold for four quarters is a differ
ent story. Stanford is by far OSU's best competi
tion it's faced all year.
WS: How are the Beavers doing in a post-Jordan
Poyer world? Can they match up with Stanford's
wideouts?
AK: Junior-college transfer Steven Nelson has
filled in for Poyer at corner, with senior Sean
Martin filling in at the nickel position Poyer
loved. Nelson has been great for the Beavers
all year. He was shaky at best in the first two
games, but Banker and Riley attributed it to
nerves and getting acclimated to D 1 football.
Since, he's intercepted five passes, tied for first
in the nation. He also had the game-winning
pick-six against SDSU a few weeks ago. Ryan
Murphy and Tyrequek Zimmerman were both
starters last season, so it's a talented and expe
rienced bunch. They give up yards, but are
fourth in the nation in interceptions as a unit
last time I checked. Stanford has some great
wideouts that highlight TD from Saturday
was absolutely incredible but I like the sec
ondary's chances in coverage overall.

Quarterback Sean Mannion and receiver
Brandin Cooks have been the talk of Corvallis
this season, leading the nation in every major
category. Does Stanford have an answer for
them?

WS: I have to respect the production that
Mannion and Cooks have racked up, and if the
Beaver defense can hold up —we'll see about
that on game day—then the focus is going to
be on the other side of the ball. Stanford's got
a great secondary. Safeties Jordan Richards and
Ed Reynolds might be the best in the country
they're absolutely lethal covering the deep
posts that passing coaches love, and they're
typically solid in run support as well. CB Alex
Carter won the starting job midway through
last season and ran with it he's tough and
physical. Opposite him, Wayne Lyons gets
picked on almost out of necessity, but if Lyons
is the one getting picked on Stanford's doing
pretty well.
You had a prediction for the game
what do you think is the score?
AK: 33-27 Stanford. I think it'll be pretty close
throughout, but Stanford's just the better
team.
WS: Best of luck, and thanks again for beating
Cal.

loved. Nelson has been great for the Beavers
all year. He was shaky at best in the first two
games, but Banker and Riley attributed it to
nerves and getting acclimated to D 1 football.
Since, he's intercepted five passes, tied for first
in the nation. He also had the game-winning
pick-six against SDSU a few weeks ago. Ryan
Murphy and Tyrequek Zimmerman were both
starters last season, so it's a talented and expe
rienced bunch. They give up yards, but are
fourth in the nation in interceptions as a unit
last time I checked. Stanford has some great
wideouts that highlight TD from Saturday
was absolutely incredible but I like the sec
ondary's chances in coverage overall.

Quarterback Sean Mannion and receiver
Brandin Cooks have been the talk of Corvallis
this season, leading the nation in every major
category. Does Stanford have an answer for
them?

WS: I have to respect the production that
Mannion and Cooks have racked up, and if the
Beaver defense can hold up —we'll see about
that on game day—then the focus is going to
be on the other side of the ball. Stanford's got
a great secondary. Safeties Jordan Richards and
Ed Reynolds might be the best in the country
they're absolutely lethal covering the deep
posts that passing coaches love, and they're
typically solid in run support as well. CB Alex
Carter won the starting job midway through
last season and ran with it he's tough and
physical. Opposite him, Wayne Lyons gets
picked on almost out of necessity, but if Lyons
is the one getting picked on Stanford's doing
pretty well.
You had a prediction for the game
what do you think is the score?
AK: 33-27 Stanford. I think it'll be pretty close
throughout, but Stanford's just the better
team.
WS: Best of luck, and thanks again for beating
Cal.

In advance of Saturday's football game be
tween Stanford and Oregon State, The Dai
ly's Winston Shi chatted with Andrew Kil
strom of The Daily Barometer, Oregon State's
student newspaper, to get perspective from
both camps. Below is a partial transcript of
their conversation. For a more complete tran
script of their back-andforth, go to www.stan
forddaily. com/category/sports.
Winston Shi (WS): Oregon State has one loss.
What happened with Eastern Washington?
Andrew Kilstrom (AK): Last time Oregon State
lost to an FCS team was in 2011, when it dropped
its opener to Sacramento State. That OSU team
ended up finishing 3-9, so it was full-blown panic
mode in Corvallis. What it came down to was an
injured defense that wasn't ready for a live test.
OSU kept Eastern Washington off the scoreboard
on only one possession the entire game. Since
then the defense has been progressively better, is
as healthy as it's been and looks to be formidable
at this point. So what it really comes down to is
just experience and getting everything in sync, I'd
say. That's the word from defensive coordinator
Mike Banker and the defense, at least.
WS: Do you think that OSU's front seven has the
talent and the depth up front to match Stanford's
offensive line?
AK: Good question. I think the starters definitely
do. There's a ton of speed and even some NFL tal
ent there. Scott Chrichton is going to be drafted
in the first round, Dylan Wynn is a stud and D.J.
Alexander is one of the most talented players in
the conference. The depth is a huge area of con
cern, however. After the first unit, it's pretty thin.
OSU has managed good pressure all year, and is
defending the run well as of late, but can be vul
nerable. The Beavers can hang for a while, but
whether they can hold for four quarters is a differ
ent story. Stanford is by far OSU's best competi
tion it's faced all year.
WS: How are the Beavers doing in a post-Jordan
Poyer world? Can they match up with Stanford's
wideouts?
AK: Junior-college transfer Steven Nelson has
filled in for Poyer at corner, with senior Sean
Martin filling in at the nickel position Poyer
loved. Nelson has been great for the Beavers
all year. He was shaky at best in the first two
games, but Banker and Riley attributed it to
nerves and getting acclimated to D 1 football.
Since, he's intercepted five passes, tied for first
in the nation. He also had the game-winning
