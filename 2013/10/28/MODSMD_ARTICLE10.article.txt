## OP-ED Who Needs Feminism? 
### 
College surveys indicate that
one in four women are vic
tims of rape or attempted
rape. This is a fact that many stu
dents are told before entering col
lege and hear many times through
out their college experience.
Everyone can agree that this is
a problem, and everyone can agree
that this is bad. But, if I were to en
ter into a discussion with the aver
age student about the gendered na
ture of sexual violence within the
context of feminism, I believe that I
would have a lot more difficulty
getting them to acknowledge or
agree with these facts and ideas.
I believe that there is still a stig
ma surrounding feminism and that
it stems from two connected issues:
the perpetuation of myths about
what types of individuals are femi
nists and what they believe and a
lack of education about the feminist
movement.
Even at this point in history and
even on a campus as liberal as Stan
ford, one of the most common rea
sons I hear about why a student
does not identify with the feminist
movement is because it is "too rad
ical."
The image that most people con
jure in their minds upon hearing
the word feminism is of a bra-burn
ing, man-hating, lesbian separatist
who doesn't shave her legs and
spends all of her time embracing
the term "Feminazi" at extreme po
litical rallies.
While you may think that my
description of feminist stereotypes
is an exaggeration (despite the fact
that some people really believe
those ideas), the underlying senti
ments of this extreme depiction still
hold true for many people.
Even if you take my stereotype
description to be a dramatized and
antiquated activist persona from
the 1960s and '7os, many individu
als still believe that identifying as a
feminist is "too radical" in some
way. But what does "too radical" re
ally mean in this situation?
Well, in some cases, I believe
those people do not feel that the
feminist movement is relevant at
this point in history. Why should
they take an active interest in the
fight for gender equality if it has al
ready been achieved?
In other cases, I believe those
individuals still fear that an associ
ation with feminism labels them
with some version of the stereotype
described earlier and means that
they automatically agree with any
and every idea of the women's
movement.
Finally, I think that some indi
viduals just feel that feminism has
no impact on their life.
It is these stereotypes, myths
and ideas that come from a lack of
education about what feminism is
and also create a barrier for those
who want to learn. If you take any
class with the Feminist, Gender and
Sexuality Studies department at
Stanford or many other depart
ments for that matter it be
comes apparent that many gen
dered issues still exist in our socie
ty today despite the progress that
has already been made.
It also becomes clear that femi
nism is a broad movement with uni
versal goals. Feminism is about the
intersection of various hierarchies
of power; it is concerned with not
only issues of gender, but also race,
class and sexual orientation and
how these issues interact to create
a unique experience for every hu-

man being.
Feminism is about building
coalitions between various activist
groups and promoting greater
equality for all individuals.
It is with these ideas in mind
that the Stanford Women's Coali
tion decided to launch a campaign
this quarter to increase campus
awareness about gender inequality
and demonstrate how feminism is
still relevant today. We want to dis
pel the stereotypes surrounding
feminism and show that the goals of
the movement are inclusive and
universal.
Our project will be an extension
of the "Who Needs Feminism?"
campaign that has become a phe
nomenon on blogs, tumblr and
Facebook.
Our campaign will build off this
model and also include an option for
individuals who are not comfortable
with identifying as a feminist but
support gender equality. People
who want to participate will hold a
statement of "I need feminism be
cause ... " or "I'm not a feminist, but
..." with their personal reason, and
we will take their picture. We want
everyone to feel comfortable partic
ipating in this campaign, and we
hope to show that feminists and
non-feminists alike have the same
underlying beliefs and goals. Pic
tures will be taken at the Women's
Community Center Tuesday, Oct.
29 from 6 to 8 p.m and in White
Plaza on Wednesday Oct. 30 and
Friday Nov. 1 from 12 to 2 p.m. The
photos will be uploaded to the
Women's Coalition Facebook page
and become a part of the larger
global discussion about what femi
nism means to each person.
If you believe that segregation
should exist... If you believe that
someone should be beaten or ha
rassed for his or her sexual orienta
tion ... If you believe that a woman
could ever be "asking for it" as vic
tim of rape ... If you believe that
racism, homophobia, sexism or any
other kind of discrimination funda
mentally improves humanity...
then no, you're not a feminist.
But, if you believe that greater
equality should be a goal of our so
ciety, then you should have no prob
lem identifying with the movement.
