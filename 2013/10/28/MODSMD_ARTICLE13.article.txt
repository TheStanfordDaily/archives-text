# TECHNOBABBLE
## The 						Engineer-Politician 
### Omar Diab 
The United States needs more
technically proficient mem
bers in Congress. The govern
ment has failed to make sound tech
nical legislation for the web and in
tellectual property law over the last
several years. Perhaps the answer
lies in entrusting the technical pop
ulation with civic duty, as well as the
public as a whole.
With the end of the government
closure, the Cyber Intelligence
Sharing and Protection Act (CIS
PA) appears to be returning to Sen
ate. The bill attempts to open legal
channels between the government
and private companies to share in
formation regarding cyberterror
ism. When the bill was introduced a
year ago, it met fierce resistance,
many claiming that it was worse
than the highly controversial Stop
Online Piracy Act (SOPA). It was
killed in Senate, and now campaign
ing to block CISPA has begun once
again.
According to a release by Con
gress, there were a grand total of

"three physicists, one chemist, six
engineers including a biomedical
engineer, and one microbiologist"
among the 541 members of the Con
gress in 2010, accounting for about
two percent of the United States'
legislature. In contrast, approxi
mately 36.4 percent of college-edu
cated citizens have science or engi
neering degrees. The last American
engineer-president was Herbert
Hoover (1929-1933), a mining engi
neer.
American engineers have no
compelling reasons to engage in
politics. Socioeconomically, lawyers
often benefit from the time they
spend in the political world, gaining
relevant practice and connections.
It is also viable for lawyers and po
litical scientists to enter govern
ment directly from school. Neither
rings true for engineers.
At the same time, as of 2009, en
gineering was the hardest job to fill
in America and unemployment rates
for engineers in general was below a
third of the national average.
The divide between politics and
the technical public highlights a
root cause of why lawyers dominate
Congress: Politics is a vocation. Pol
itics has a well-defined career path
that involves interning for politi
cians or institutions like think tanks
and lobbies. In contrast, Joseph
Schlesinger, political science profes
sor at Michigan State University,
claims that amateur politicians
those who join politics without for
mal political background are
driven by the policy goals they wish
to enact, whereas professional
politicians are motivated predomi
nantly by the pursuit of power and
political ambition.
Take SOPA. In late 2011, the is
sue of intellectual property rights in
the Internet age took the center
stage when Rep. Lamar Smith (R
-TX), a 64-year-old lawyer and for
mer ranch manager from Texas,
proposed SOPA. The bill attempted
to limit the potential for copyright
infringement by making it a crimi
nal offense to stream or otherwise
present copyrighted content online.
It forced payment and advertise
ment companies, search engines
and Internet service providers to
cut off services to sites accused of
copyright infringement, making of
fenders' sites inaccessible.
Many of the largest tech compa
nies in the world temporarily shut-

terecl their own websites in protest.
Seventy corporations and lobby
groups petitioned Congress to tem
porarily halt discussions of new in
tellectual property laws altogether.
Those bills were killed as well.
If the legislators behind SOPA
failed to understand the bills' tech
nological and cultural implications,
they should have had better techni
cal education. Providing expert
technical advice is not enough; as
lan Wright wrote for the Engineer
ing Management Journal, politi
cians often fail to request technical
advice since they do not always rec
ognize the complex implications of
technical policies.
On the other hand, if those legis
lators were cognizant of SOPA's
flaws, they do not deserve to guide
national policy. The RIAA (Record
ing Industry Association of Ameri
ca) & MPAA (Motion Picture Asso
ciation of America) are known to
have donated more than four times
more money to lobby for SOPA than
Silicon Valley did to oppose it.
Having engineers and scientists
act as politicians would not neces
sarily solve the underlying prob
lems that cause widespread corrup
tion in the U.S. government. But it
would at least encourage people
with less political ambition to par
ticipate in legislation, and it would
encourage better technical legisla
tion.
I believe that there must be a
more fundamental change to pro
mote a better government that isn't
specific to engineers: Politics should
be viewed as a public service rather
than a profession. Because of politi
cal ambition, the political sphere
has become as much of a business
as any other occupation, and with
that comes the potential for wide
spread corruption and occupational,
racial, sexual and political homo
geneity in government at all levels.
Ohio State University Political
Science Professor Samuel C. Pat
terson asserted that "one of the
firmest generalizations about the
social composition of legislatures is
that they do not mirror their popu
lations." Hoping for a technical
Congress may be ambitious, but I
think it can be an important part of
reforming the broken U.S. govern
ment.
