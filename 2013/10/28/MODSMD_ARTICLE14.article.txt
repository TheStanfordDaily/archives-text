## BEAVER STATE SWEEP STANFORD GETS BACK ON TRACK 
### FIONA NOONAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The skid is over and order has
been restored for No. 8 Stanford
women's soccer after two convincing
victories against Oregon and Oregon
State this weekend.

The Cardinal (12-3-1, 5-3-0 Pac
-12) beat the Ducks (3-9-3,1-5-1 Pac
-12) 2-1 in Eugene on Friday, followed
up by a rout of the Beavers (5-10-2,
3-4-1 Pac-12) 4-1 in Corvallis Sunday,
extending its winning streak to three
matches after a three-match home
losing streak.
"The team is feeling really good,"
said junior forward Chioma Übo
gagu after Sunday's match. "We
knew coming in that this weekend
was really big for us, and we wanted
to keep getting wins for the Pac-12
and restoring our confidence for
playoffs."
Übogagu was one of five players
to score for the Card this weekend as
the team showed better depth and
diversity of attack in its two games.
Friday's victory against a strug
gling Oregon squad came on two
goals by senior co-captain forward
Courtney Verloo, who converted on a
penalty kick in the 36th minute and
then netted the game winner in the
82nd minute on a sequence that be
gan with freshman defender Maddie
Bauer and ended with an assist off of
a header by Übogagu.

Verloo, an Oregon native, now
has nine goals on the season and is
one short of tying her career high.
'Against Oregon it was definitely
Courtney Verloo who was the hero,
scoring two goals," head coach Paul
Ratcliffe said. "She's a senior leader
for us she's had an amazing year - ."
Stanford continued the high in
tensity play against OSU, scoring
three goals in the first 23 minutes
and possessing the ball as dominant
ly as the team has all season.
Übogagu then capped the win

with a goal in the 90th minute, bury
ing a shot off an assist from fresh
man forward Ryan Walker-
Hartshorn. While Übogagu has been
a fury up top recently, Sunday's goal
was only her second of the season.
"It felt really, really nice," Übo
gagu said about scoring. "It was a
great pass from [Walker-
Hartshorn], so I'm glad I could get
the ball to go in."
The Beavers came into the match
with momentum from a stunning up
set victory against No. 12 Cal on Fri

day, but their lone goal by freshman
forward Helene Haavik in the 61st
minute wasn't enough to overcome
the Cardinal.
The two wins are the 24th and
25th consecutive conference road
victories for the Cardinal, which will
look to continue the streak when it
returns to the Northwest for match
es against Washington (7-6-4, 3-1-3
Pac-12) and Washington State (10-3-
3,3-3-1 Pac-12) later this week.

Junior forward Chioma Ubogagu (left) was one of five Stanford players to score against Oregon and
Oregon State over the weekend, netting the final goal in Sunday's 4-1 road trouncing of the Beavers.
The team's focus for the
upcoming Washington slate
will be to continue building on
the confidence and urgency
displayed in the past few
games.
"I think we've got to do
the same things we did here
against the Oregon schools,"
Ratcliffe said. "We've got to
start fast, play good, connect
ed soccer and create goals
and score goals."
Stanford kicks off against
the Huskies on Thursday at 7
p.m. in Seattle.
