### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In one of the most tightly con
tested games of the season, the No.
11 Stanford Cardinal field hockey
squad toppled the Michigan
Wolverines 2-1. It was the Cardi
nal's final match outside its league
as the team looks to finish the reg
ular season with two NorPac
games.
Michigan (10-7,2-2 Big Ten) got
out to an early lead, taking a 1-0 ad
vantage on Shannon Scavelli's goal
in the fourth minute. Playing

from behind, Stanford (12-4, 3-1
NorPac) kept a very high tempo.
The Cardinal mounted pressure
against the Wolverine defense, led
by goalie Haley Jones, tagging her
with six shots in the first half alone.
However, Michigan proved to be
very tenacious, and the game be
came a battle for possession as
each team struggled to gain offen
sive dominance.

The stalemate, interrupted by a
few shots for Stanford, was broken
by a goal in the 18th minute by dy
namic Stanford freshman Fran
Tew. Capitalizing on a penalty cor
ner, Tew knocked in the rebound to
draw the Cardinal even.
"It was a really big rush," Tew
exclaimed. "It was so exciting in the
moment."
The equalizer marked Tew's
fourth goal of the season her last
was the overtime winner against
Wake Forest. Though Stanford car
ried a 6-1 shot advantage, the teams
entered halftime knotted at 1-1.

Stanford came out of halftime in
vigorated. Taking a few quick shots,
the Cardinal appeared to have the
Wolverines on their heels. But
Michigan bounded back, reverting
the game to its first-half deadlock.
Though Stanford held a huge
penalty corner advantage in the sec
ond half (5-1), it was not until the
56th minute that senior Hope Burke
was able to convert one into a goal.
In a flawlessly executed play, Burke
netted the rebound off the initial
shot by Jessica Chisholm.
