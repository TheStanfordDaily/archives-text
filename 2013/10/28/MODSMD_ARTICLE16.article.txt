showing in its season-opening dual
meet schedule as the Cardinal (3-0,
2-0 Pac-12) cruised past Oregon

The Cardinal had no trouble at
all dispatching the Beavers as it
started the meet off with a bang
with a sweep of the top three in the
4x50-yard medley relay. It went on
to claim first place in 11 of the 14

events with a large chunk of the
team swimming exhibitions on the
final three events the 100-yard
butterfly, 200-yard individual med
ley (IM) and the 4xloo-yard
freestyle relay which prevent
ed the Cardinal from notching an
additional first-place finish and
several more top-three perform
ances.

Senior Felicia Lee led the
charge for the Cardinal with an
other stellar meet in which she dis
played her versatility by claiming
three individual first-place finish
es in the 200-yard butterfly
(1:58:89), the 100-yard freestyle
(49:95) and the 200-yard IM
(2:01:61) while also contributing to

Junior Katie Olsen also
had a fantastic meet, affirm
ing her place as one of the
team's breaststroke special
ists with her first-place fin
ishes in both the 100-yard
and 200-yard events and a
stellar breaststroke leg in
the 4x50 medley relay to
open the meet. In the 100-
yard event, she trailed fellow
Cardinal sophomore Sarah
Haase through the opening
50 yards before pulling
ahead convincingly in the
back 50, while in the 200-
yard event she took an early
lead that she would never re
linquish.
Along with Lee and
Olsen, senior Maya Dißado,
junior Annemarie Thayer,
sophomore Julia Ama, fresh
man Tara Halsted and junior
Mackenzie Stein also pocket
ed individual victories in the
meet. Other Stanford con
tributors added countless
other second-place and third
place finishes in the thor
oughly Cardinal-dominated
meet.
The only individual events
that the Cardinal dropped
were the long 500-yard
freestyle and 1,000-yard
freestyle events, for which
Stanford entered mainly un
derclassmen to evaluate their
long-distance potential be
fore heading into any invita
tional meets. Both of those
events were won by Oregon
State's Sammy Harrison,
who was the only individual
winner for the Beavers in the
meet.
The Cardinal will now re
turn to Avery Aquatic Cen

the fall against Wisconsin
(0-2, 0-1 Big Ten) before it
heads to College Station,
Tex., in late November for
its first invitational meet of
the season against teams
from all across the country
at the Art Adamson Invita

her races with a veiy com
fortable margin of victory.

Junior Katie Olsen also
had a fantastic meet, affirm
ing her place as one of the
team's breaststroke special
ists with her first-place fin
ishes in both the 100-yard
and 200-yard events and a
stellar breaststroke leg in
the 4x50 medley relay to
open the meet. In the 100-
yard event, she trailed fellow
Cardinal sophomore Sarah
Haase through the opening
50 yards before pulling
ahead convincingly in the
back 50, while in the 200-
yard event she took an early
lead that she would never re
linquish.
Along with Lee and
Olsen, senior Maya Dißado,
junior Annemarie Thayer,
sophomore Julia Ama, fresh
man Tara Halsted and junior
Mackenzie Stein also pocket
ed individual victories in the
meet. Other Stanford con
tributors added countless
other second-place and third
place finishes in the thor
oughly Cardinal-dominated
meet.
The only individual events
that the Cardinal dropped
were the long 500-yard
freestyle and 1,000-yard
freestyle events, for which
Stanford entered mainly un
derclassmen to evaluate their
long-distance potential be
fore heading into any invita
tional meets. Both of those
events were won by Oregon
State's Sammy Harrison,
who was the only individual
winner for the Beavers in the
meet.
The Cardinal will now re
turn to Avery Aquatic Cen
ter for its final dual meet of
the fall against Wisconsin
(0-2, 0-1 Big Ten) before it
heads to College Station,
Tex., in late November for
its first invitational meet of
the season against teams
from all across the country
at the Art Adamson Invita
tional.
