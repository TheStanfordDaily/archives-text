## Stanford finishes fourth 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Playing against one of the
toughest fields in recent collegiate
golf memory, Stanford's women's
golf grabbed fourth place, finishing
behind three conference opponents
ranked in the top five nationally.
Sophomore Mariah Stackhouse
who has historically performed well
on the fabled Stanford Golf Course
finished tied for fifth in the indi
vidual competition, trailing only
Pac-12 golfers.
The Cardinal was near the top
of the team leaderboard all week
end long after getting off to a solid
start in Friday's opening round.
Stackhouse was in a two-way tie for
second after firing a 3-under 68,
leading the team to a 1-under 283
cumulative score and a tie with
Oregon for third place. Fellow
sophomore Lauren Kim was the
next lowest for the Card after
shooting even-par 71, with fresh
man Quirine Eijkenboom, junior
Mariko Tumangan and senior
Marissa Mar who played as an
individual all at l-over.
Saturday's second round,
known as moving day in golf ver
nacular, was slightly less successful
for the hosts but saw two teams
have remarkable rounds. No. 1
UCLA and No. 2 USC put the field
and the NCAA on notice that they
will certainly be contenders come
May, easily distancing themselves
from the rest of the competition by
shooting a combined 28-under par
in Saturday's frame. Though con-
cerned first and foremost
with her own players and the
present, Stanford head
coach Anne Walker couldn't
help but reflect on what was
a great performance by her
opponents and look ahead
for what is to come.
,AuThe buzz around the
tournament was greatâ€žAii
Walker said. ,AuWe had the
No. 1 and [No.] 2 teams in
the country, both undefeated
coming into this event, fight
ing it out for the champi
onship with numbers that
you rarely see. UCLA post
ed a 16-under for 18 holes ...
the lowest round in the histo
ry of their program, and
then USC comes back with a
ton of birdies in the last nine
holes to post 12-under and
take a commanding eight
shot lead. Even as a compet
ing team, it,Aos exciting to
watch this level of golf at
your home course.,Au
Not only was the fight for
first fierce but so was the
battle for third between the
Cardinal, Washington and
Pepperdine. Ultimately, the
Huskies squeaked onto the
podium Sunday afternoon,
propelled by top-10 finishers
Charlotte Thomas and Jen
nifer Yang. Stanford finished
four strokes behind its con
ference foes, while besting
the Waves by five. Stack
house also did not have the
strong finish she was hoping
for: After three bogeys in
the first and second rounds
combined, she carded four
yesterday en route to a 1-
over 72 score.
While Stackhouse's final
round was somewhat out of
character, perhaps the most
surprising part of the tour
nament for Stanford was the
play of Marissa Mar. After
being left out of Walker's
traveling lineup for most of
last season and the early
part of the current cam
paign, the senior would've

figured in to Stanford's scor
ing with rounds of 72-71-75.
Had Mar been in the five
woman lineup, the Card
would've been only one
stroke behind Washington.
"Marissa works extreme
ly hard, and she has been
pushing the top five to get
better," Walker said before
the third round. "Her expe
rience as a senior is starting

to show through her pa
tience and present centered
attitude. Marissa is playing
great."

Stanford will conclude its
fall tournament schedule at
the Nanea Pac-12 Preview,
which starts next Monday in
Kailua Kona, Hawaii.
