Stanford football just refus
es to make things easy on
its fans. While I certainly
won't try to draw up nega
tive long-term implications
of Saturday's win against Oregon
State coming down to the final sec
onds (there are none), it did teach me
a valuable life lesson: My heart won't
be able to take being too emotionally
attached to Stanford football for 50
years.
Somehow the Cardinal turned an
11-point lead with a spectacular de
fense playing perhaps its best football
all season into a heart-attack-induc
ing last four plays. This time, it wasn't
due to play-calling errors; it was just
a lack of execution.
Senior running back Tyler
Gaffhey had a spectacular night, but
his fumble gave the Beavers new life.
Then, with 3,000 pounds of bulk in the
game, Stanford couldn't pick up a
yard against a defensive front that it
had been abusing all game. Fortu
nately for Gaffney, the Cardinal of
fense and any Stanford fan looking
forward to a potential BCS vacation
again this January, the defense
stepped up again to save the day.
So, now that we've all had some
time to bring our heart rate back to
normal, it's time to reflect on what we
learned from Saturday and what that
means for the matchup with Oregon
in 10 days.
To go back even earlier than the
start of Stanford's game at Oregon
State, Oregon's home win against
UCLA about an hour down the road
in Eugene had some interesting take
aways that could be very beneficial to
the Cardinal's chances.
Amazingly enough, the Ducks ac
tually looked beatable for 30 minutes
against the Bruins. UCLA dominated
play for much of the first half and
probably should have been winning
by seven or more points. Poor play by
UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley
and a great fake punt by Oregon were
the only things that kept the Ducks
close.
After halftime, however, Oregon
pulled away to win decisively. While
some may think that is a bad sign, I
think that actually is good for Stan
ford. Oregon still hasn't won a close
game in its last two seasons its on
ly close game came against Stanford
in 2012 and we all know how that end
ed so I'm not sure if the Ducks tru
ly believe they can pull out a tough
win. It's better for the Cardinal that
the Ducks couldn't overcome that
hurdle in advance.
In the hours following Oregon's
win against UCLA, Stanford's de
fense reminded me why I predicted
the Cardinal to go undefeated this
season in the first place. Ever since
the end of Stanford's loss to Utah, the
Cardinal defense has been spectacu
lar in pretty much every way. Stan
ford has shut down a UCLA dual
threat attack and an explosive Ore
gon State passing game, and that's
while battling a lot of injuries up
front.
If fifth-year senior defensive end
Ben Gardner can heal enough to be a
factor against Oregon, I really think
Stanford's defense can repeat what it
did in 2012. In Saturday's win against
Oregon State, Stanford showed
everything a great defense needs to
do to stop a great offense: tackle well,
get pressure on the quarterback with
or without the blitz and play good cov
erage in the secondary. If not for
Stanford's abysmal offensive per
formance, the Cardinal probably
would've kept OSU, one of the high
est-scoring teams in the country, un
der 10 points. That is impressive.
And while, on offense, Stanford
did not play well enough to beat Ore
gon, I'm not sure that is entirely a bad
thing. Sitting in the postgame press
conference with Gaffney, head coach
David Shaw and junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan, I was amazed at how
angry Stanford's offensive-minded
players and coaches were after
pulling out the win. Yes, they were
thrilled to beat Oregon State, but
Hogan and Gaffney were disgusted at
themselves, with Shaw not much
more positive.
Stanford didn't need a confidence
boost; I know for a fact that eveiyone in
the locker room thinks that Stanford
should beat Oregon. This sloppy offen
sive performance against Oregon State
looks like it will instead provide a tremen
dous amount of motivation to Hogan and
the offense to get better every single
play leading up to next Thursday, and
that certainly can't hurt.
So while Stanford squandered an

opportunity to let its fans fall
asleep without heartburn, it
did set itself up perfectly to
have its best chance of knock
ing off the Ducks. The buildup
is here. Let's enjoy these 10
days.

the only things that kept the Ducks
close.
After halftime, however, Oregon
pulled away to win decisively. While
some may think that is a bad sign, I
think that actually is good for Stan
ford. Oregon still hasn't won a close
game in its last two seasons its on
ly close game came against Stanford
in 2012 and we all know how that end
ed so I'm not sure if the Ducks tru
ly believe they can pull out a tough
win. It's better for the Cardinal that
the Ducks couldn't overcome that
hurdle in advance.
In the hours following Oregon's
win against UCLA, Stanford's de
fense reminded me why I predicted
the Cardinal to go undefeated this
season in the first place. Ever since
the end of Stanford's loss to Utah, the
Cardinal defense has been spectacu
lar in pretty much every way. Stan
ford has shut down a UCLA dual
threat attack and an explosive Ore
gon State passing game, and that's
while battling a lot of injuries up
front.
If fifth-year senior defensive end
Ben Gardner can heal enough to be a
factor against Oregon, I really think
Stanford's defense can repeat what it
did in 2012. In Saturday's win against
Oregon State, Stanford showed
everything a great defense needs to
do to stop a great offense: tackle well,
get pressure on the quarterback with
or without the blitz and play good cov
erage in the secondary. If not for
Stanford's abysmal offensive per
formance, the Cardinal probably
would've kept OSU, one of the high
est-scoring teams in the country, un
der 10 points. That is impressive.
And while, on offense, Stanford
did not play well enough to beat Ore
gon, I'm not sure that is entirely a bad
thing. Sitting in the postgame press
conference with Gaffney, head coach
David Shaw and junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan, I was amazed at how
angry Stanford's offensive-minded
players and coaches were after
pulling out the win. Yes, they were
thrilled to beat Oregon State, but
Hogan and Gaffney were disgusted at
themselves, with Shaw not much
more positive.
Stanford didn't need a confidence
boost; I know for a fact that eveiyone in
the locker room thinks that Stanford
should beat Oregon. This sloppy offen
sive performance against Oregon State
looks like it will instead provide a tremen
dous amount of motivation to Hogan and
the offense to get better every single
play leading up to next Thursday, and
that certainly can't hurt.
So while Stanford squandered an

opportunity to let its fans fall
asleep without heartburn, it
did set itself up perfectly to
have its best chance of knock
ing off the Ducks. The buildup
is here. Let's enjoy these 10
days.

Stanford football just refus
es to make things easy on
its fans. While I certainly
won't try to draw up nega
tive long-term implications
of Saturday's win against Oregon
State coming down to the final sec
onds (there are none), it did teach me
a valuable life lesson: My heart won't
be able to take being too emotionally
attached to Stanford football for 50
years.
Somehow the Cardinal turned an
11-point lead with a spectacular de
fense playing perhaps its best football
all season into a heart-attack-induc
ing last four plays. This time, it wasn't
due to play-calling errors; it was just
a lack of execution.
Senior running back Tyler
Gaffhey had a spectacular night, but
his fumble gave the Beavers new life.
Then, with 3,000 pounds of bulk in the
game, Stanford couldn't pick up a
yard against a defensive front that it
had been abusing all game. Fortu
nately for Gaffney, the Cardinal of
fense and any Stanford fan looking
forward to a potential BCS vacation
again this January, the defense
stepped up again to save the day.
So, now that we've all had some
time to bring our heart rate back to
normal, it's time to reflect on what we
learned from Saturday and what that
means for the matchup with Oregon
in 10 days.
To go back even earlier than the
start of Stanford's game at Oregon
State, Oregon's home win against
UCLA about an hour down the road
in Eugene had some interesting take
aways that could be very beneficial to
the Cardinal's chances.
Amazingly enough, the Ducks ac
tually looked beatable for 30 minutes
against the Bruins. UCLA dominated
play for much of the first half and
probably should have been winning
by seven or more points. Poor play by
UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley
and a great fake punt by Oregon were
the only things that kept the Ducks
close.
