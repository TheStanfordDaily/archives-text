# FIRST SCRIMMAGE SHOWS PROMISE
## 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Demonstrating an impres
sive blend of athleticism, ver
satility, depth and shooting,
the Stanford men's basket
ball team proved Thursday
evening in the annual Cardi
nal-White scrimmage why it
could be worthy of an NCAA
tournament appearance this
season.
The team played two 12-
minute intrasquad scrim
mages, with players switch
ing rosters for each half. Jun
iors Elliot Bullock and Jack
Ryan and all three sopho
mores on the team Chris
tian Sanders, Rosco Allen
and Grant Verhoeven were
kept inactive for the scrim
mage.
The biggest development
of the evening was the return
of junior guard/forward An
thony Brown, who missed
most of last season due to a hip
injury. Brown a Pac-10 All-
Freshman Team selection dur
ing the 2010-11 season
looked better than ever in his
21 minutes of action. With a to
tal of 14 points and a perfect 6-
of-6 shooting, Brown displayed
a variety of skills hitting
two threes and a step-back
jumper from the left baseline,
making a lay-up while drawing
contact and throwing down a
vicious one-handed dunk on a
fast break.
"It felt good," said Brown
about being back. "I've been
waiting almost a year for this
moment, just trying to come
back to do whatever I can to
help the team."
Although Brown displayed
his full offensive abilities during
the scrimmage, he sees himself
taking on a more defensive role
during the season.
'A big part of my role [this
year] would be defensive stop
per," Brown said. "Last year; at
times, there were a lot of
guards in the Pac-12 that had
career nights against us."
Brown will be crucial for the
Cardinal this upcoming season,
considering the Cardinal
lacked a natural small forward
following his injury and, as he
mentioned, struggled at times
to defend some of the more tal
ented guards in the conference.
Brown was not, however,
the only member of Stanford's
backcourt to impress on Thurs
day. Junior Chasson Randle
was one of just three Cardinal
players whose team won both
games last night—along with
senior Stefan Nastic and fresh
man Marcus Allen and it
was Randle's play that largely

secured the outcome of the sec
ond scrimmage.
Paired with a unit of re
serves that were defeated 30-7
in the first game by Randle's
White squad, the junior took
over halhvay through the sec
ond period, willing his Cardinal
squad to a 24-23 victory. Randle
finished the night as the lead
scorer, with 18 points on 7-of-13
shooting.
Senior forward Josh
Huestis also looked to be in
midseason form for the Cardi
nal, completing the night with
an efficient performance of
nine points, seven rebounds
and three loud blocks. Huestis,
along with fellow senior for
ward Dwight Powell, will look
to give Stanford an important
edge on the interior this season.
All four of Stanford's fresh
men made their public debuts
last night. Marcus Allen, twin
of fellow guard Malcolm, was
the most visible of the four, tal
lying six points, three rebounds
and three steals in 21 minutes.
If Allen can learn to rein in
his energy to avoid committing

careless fouls 30 feet from the
basket, he, along with Brown,
could be a large contributor to
improving Stanford's perime
ter defense this season.
Freshman center Schuyler
Rimmer also showed consider
able promise during the scrim
mage— with four rebounds
and two blocks and will look
to provide good depth for the
Cardinal off the bench this sea
son.
Malcolm Allen, twin of Mar
cus, collected two rebounds in
13 minutes, and walk-on Scott
Woods was also active on the
glass, registering four boards
in seven minutes.
Coach Johnny Dawkins
spoke to the fans after the
scrimmage, and he continued
to emphasize the need for self
lessness and a collective
mindset that he has men
tioned during the offseason.
"A journey by yourself is
pretty lonely," Dawkins said.
"These guys have been as
committed as any group I've
ever coached. This is going to
be a terrific season."
After five consecutive sea
sons without an NCAA tour
nament appearance, the Car
dinal hopes to return to the
table in the 2013-14 season. If
it doesn't, much bigger
changes could occur than just
Dawkins' coaching philoso
phy.

per," Brown said. "Last year; at
times, there were a lot of
guards in the Pac-12 that had
career nights against us."
Brown will be crucial for the
Cardinal this upcoming season,
considering the Cardinal
lacked a natural small forward
following his injury and, as he
mentioned, struggled at times
to defend some of the more tal
ented guards in the conference.
Brown was not, however,
the only member of Stanford's
backcourt to impress on Thurs
day. Junior Chasson Randle
was one of just three Cardinal
players whose team won both
games last night—along with
senior Stefan Nastic and fresh
man Marcus Allen and it
was Randle's play that largely

secured the outcome of the sec
ond scrimmage.
Paired with a unit of re
serves that were defeated 30-7
in the first game by Randle's
White squad, the junior took
over halhvay through the sec
ond period, willing his Cardinal
squad to a 24-23 victory. Randle
finished the night as the lead
scorer, with 18 points on 7-of-13
shooting.
Senior forward Josh
Huestis also looked to be in
midseason form for the Cardi
nal, completing the night with
an efficient performance of
nine points, seven rebounds
and three loud blocks. Huestis,
along with fellow senior for
ward Dwight Powell, will look
to give Stanford an important
edge on the interior this season.
All four of Stanford's fresh
men made their public debuts
last night. Marcus Allen, twin
of fellow guard Malcolm, was
the most visible of the four, tal
lying six points, three rebounds
and three steals in 21 minutes.
If Allen can learn to rein in
his energy to avoid committing

careless fouls 30 feet from the
basket, he, along with Brown,
could be a large contributor to
improving Stanford's perime
ter defense this season.
Freshman center Schuyler
Rimmer also showed consider
able promise during the scrim
mage— with four rebounds
and two blocks and will look
to provide good depth for the
Cardinal off the bench this sea
son.
Malcolm Allen, twin of Mar
cus, collected two rebounds in
13 minutes, and walk-on Scott
Woods was also active on the
glass, registering four boards
in seven minutes.
Coach Johnny Dawkins
spoke to the fans after the
scrimmage, and he continued
to emphasize the need for self
lessness and a collective
mindset that he has men
tioned during the offseason.
"A journey by yourself is
pretty lonely," Dawkins said.
"These guys have been as
committed as any group I've
ever coached. This is going to
be a terrific season."
After five consecutive sea
sons without an NCAA tour
nament appearance, the Car
dinal hopes to return to the
table in the 2013-14 season. If
it doesn't, much bigger
changes could occur than just
Dawkins' coaching philoso
phy.

Coming off of a hip injury that sidelined him for a
majority of the 2012-13 season, Stanford junior foward
Anthony Brown (above) will be counted on to play a key
role for the Cardinal in the upcoming Pac-12 campaign.
Demonstrating an impres
sive blend of athleticism, ver
satility, depth and shooting,
the Stanford men's basket
ball team proved Thursday
evening in the annual Cardi
nal-White scrimmage why it
could be worthy of an NCAA
tournament appearance this
season.
The team played two 12-
minute intrasquad scrim
mages, with players switch
ing rosters for each half. Jun
iors Elliot Bullock and Jack
Ryan and all three sopho
mores on the team Chris
tian Sanders, Rosco Allen
and Grant Verhoeven were
kept inactive for the scrim
mage.
The biggest development
of the evening was the return
of junior guard/forward An
thony Brown, who missed
most of last season due to a hip
injury. Brown a Pac-10 All-
Freshman Team selection dur
ing the 2010-11 season
looked better than ever in his
21 minutes of action. With a to
tal of 14 points and a perfect 6-
of-6 shooting, Brown displayed
a variety of skills hitting
two threes and a step-back
jumper from the left baseline,
making a lay-up while drawing
contact and throwing down a
vicious one-handed dunk on a
fast break.
"It felt good," said Brown
about being back. "I've been
waiting almost a year for this
moment, just trying to come
back to do whatever I can to
help the team."
Although Brown displayed
his full offensive abilities during
the scrimmage, he sees himself
taking on a more defensive role
during the season.
'A big part of my role [this
year] would be defensive stop
per," Brown said. "Last year; at
times, there were a lot of
guards in the Pac-12 that had
career nights against us."
