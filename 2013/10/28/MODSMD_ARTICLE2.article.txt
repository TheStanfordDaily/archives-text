# GSC overturns new judicial bylaws
## Members cite lack of student input in original adoption of charter additions 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) last Wednesday approved a
bill overturning eight new bylaws to
the Student Judicial Charter, in part
because members said they had not
been included in conversations before
the bylaws were adopted.
The decision came nearly five
months after the Board on Judicial
Affair's (BJA) first adopted the by
laws and a day after the Undergrad
uate Senate, in a split 7-7 vote, failed
to pass a counter-part bill that would
have overturned the same bylaws.
"I want to emphasize that this bill,

for me and for everyone I talked to,
isn't about sticking it to the BJA,"
said Trevor Martin, GSC co-chair and
a second-year graduate student in bi
ology, who voted in favor of overturn
ing the bylaws. "It really is about
starting a process of working with
the BJA to create a new set of by
laws, which can be more agreeable to
everyone. We really look forward to
working with them in the future."
The two student legislative bod
ies, the Undergraduate Senate and
GSC, will each take up a bill this week
to form a joint committee on Judicial
Affairs. Members from both bodies
said they hope this proposed commit
tee will ensure greater communica

tion between the BJA, the GSC and
the ASSU in the future.
GSC members who voted to over
turn the bylaws said then* decision
was motivated by two factors: first,
the lack of input from the greater
Stanford community before the
adoption of the bylaws and, second,
the content of the bylaws themselves.
The BJA is a 15-member Univer
sity committee composed of six stu
dents, six faculty members and three
administrators. The board meets
twice a month and is tasked with
overseeing, clarifying and regularly
reviewing the Student Judicial Char
ter of 1997. The Office of Community
Standards (OCS) is then responsible

for enforcing the charter and bylaws.
On May 21 and June 4, the board
voted to add eight new bylaws to the
charter the first such change in
more than eight years.
According to Miles Seiver 'l4, a
BJA member last year and BJA co
chair this year, the board collectively
spent hundreds of hours working on
the new bylaws before members vot
ed to adopt them.
"I can't quantify how much time
we spent last year in subcommittee
and at meetings thinking about these
issues and coming to the conclusions
that we did," Seiver said at the Un
dergraduate Senate meeting on Oct.
22, while arguing that the new bylaws

should be kept. "Wordsmithing it.
Making sure that it's tight and right.
Going back and forth. Agreeing and
disagreeing... these are not bylaws
that came out of nowhere."
But some student leaders, such as
GSC Parliamentarian Paul Harold
J.D. 'l4, who drafted the passed bill
to overturn the bylaws, argued the
BJA should have sought input from
students beyond those serving on
the board during the process.
In addition, Harold cited concerns
with how the BJA chose to notify stu
dents that it had adopted the bylaws.
According to Section 111.A.2 of
