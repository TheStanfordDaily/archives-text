# GSC overturns new judicial bylaws
## Members cite lack of student input in original adoption of charter additions 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) last Wednesday approved a
bill overturning eight new bylaws to
the Student Judicial Charter, in part
because members said they had not
been included in conversations before
the bylaws were adopted.
The decision came nearly five
months after the Board on Judicial
Affair's (BJA) first adopted the by
laws and a day after the Undergrad
uate Senate, in a split 7-7 vote, failed
to pass a counter-part bill that would
have overturned the same bylaws.
"I want to emphasize that this bill,

for me and for everyone I talked to,
isn't about sticking it to the BJA,"
said Trevor Martin, GSC co-chair and
a second-year graduate student in bi
ology, who voted in favor of overturn
ing the bylaws. "It really is about
starting a process of working with
the BJA to create a new set of by
laws, which can be more agreeable to
everyone. We really look forward to
working with them in the future."
The two student legislative bod
ies, the Undergraduate Senate and
GSC, will each take up a bill this week
to form a joint committee on Judicial
Affairs. Members from both bodies
said they hope this proposed commit
tee will ensure greater communica

tion between the BJA, the GSC and
the ASSU in the future.
GSC members who voted to over
turn the bylaws said then* decision
was motivated by two factors: first,
the lack of input from the greater
Stanford community before the
adoption of the bylaws and, second,
the content of the bylaws themselves.
The BJA is a 15-member Univer
sity committee composed of six stu
dents, six faculty members and three
administrators. The board meets
twice a month and is tasked with
overseeing, clarifying and regularly
reviewing the Student Judicial Char
ter of 1997. The Office of Community
Standards (OCS) is then responsible

for enforcing the charter and bylaws.
On May 21 and June 4, the board
voted to add eight new bylaws to the
charter the first such change in
more than eight years.
According to Miles Seiver 'l4, a
BJA member last year and BJA co
chair this year, the board collectively
spent hundreds of hours working on
the new bylaws before members vot
ed to adopt them.
"I can't quantify how much time
we spent last year in subcommittee
and at meetings thinking about these
issues and coming to the conclusions
that we did," Seiver said at the Un
dergraduate Senate meeting on Oct.
22, while arguing that the new bylaws

should be kept. "Wordsmithing it.
Making sure that it's tight and right.
Going back and forth. Agreeing and
disagreeing... these are not bylaws
that came out of nowhere."
But some student leaders, such as
GSC Parliamentarian Paul Harold
J.D. 'l4, who drafted the passed bill
to overturn the bylaws, argued the
BJA should have sought input from
students beyond those serving on
the board during the process.
In addition, Harold cited concerns
with how the BJA chose to notify stu
dents that it had adopted the bylaws.
According to Section 111.A.2 of
the Student Judicial Charter,
"Whenever the Board adopts
or modifies its bylaws, it shall
inform the community, and
shall forward the text of the
changes to the chair of the
Undergraduate Senate of the
Associated Students of Stan
ford University, the chair of
the Graduate Student Coun
cil of the Associated Students
of Stanford University, the
chair of the Senate of the Ac
ademic Council and the Pres
ident of the University"
Harold admitted the
board technically followed
this procedure. The board,
through OCS Director Koren
Bakkegard, sent an email on
June 11 to the four parties

specified in the charter.
However, Harold said this
email notification was not
clear that the B JA had actual
ly adopted the bylaws, espe
cially since the announcement
only came within the text of
two attachments that had the
word "proposed" in the title.
He added that the B JA al
so did not carry out the spirit
of the charter, which states
the board "shall inform the
community" about any
changes to the bylaws.
The Undergraduate Senate
and GSC first realized in the fall
that the bylaws had been adopt
ed when Bakkegard sent a sec
ond email. In the Sept. 25 mes
sage, Bakkegard reiterated
the adoption of bylaws and
stated that either student
legislative body had the pow
er to overturn them at any
time.
When the Undergraduate

Senate on Tuesday failed to
pass a bill overturning the
bylaws, the decision fell upon
the GSC.
"We didn't know there
would be that type of pres
sure on us," Martin said. "In
the end, I don't think it affect
ed the way people voted...
but it did raise the stakes,
since only one of the legisla
tive bodies needs to over
rule."
Reid Spitz 'l4, president
of the Student Justice Proj
ect, said the Senate's decision
not to veto the bylaws Tues
day also put increased pres
sure on him to attend and
speak at Wednesday's GSC
meeting. The Student Justice
Project, a new campus group,
alleges that Stanford's judicial
process remains implicitly
slanted towards finding re
spondents guilty.
Spitz said he believes the

bylaws do not merely define a
term in the charter or a proce
dure to enforce the charter
and, as a result, should have
been passed as amendments,
which must be approved by
the B JA, as well as the Under
graduate Senate, GSC, Aca
demic Council and University
President.
Besides this point, he said
the bylaws are not necessary.
"It's the Justice Project's
position that we don't need
the bylaws —we don't need a
change to the charter," Spitz
said. "The charter itself is re
ally g00d... the only problem
is that the charter's not en
forced. All you have to do is
refer to the charter, enforce
the charter, and we wouldn't
need to be passing the by
laws."

"I want to emphasize that this bill,

for me and for everyone I talked to,
isn't about sticking it to the BJA,"
said Trevor Martin, GSC co-chair and
a second-year graduate student in bi
ology, who voted in favor of overturn
ing the bylaws. "It really is about
starting a process of working with
the BJA to create a new set of by
laws, which can be more agreeable to
everyone. We really look forward to
working with them in the future."
The two student legislative bod
ies, the Undergraduate Senate and
GSC, will each take up a bill this week
to form a joint committee on Judicial
Affairs. Members from both bodies
said they hope this proposed commit
tee will ensure greater communica

tion between the BJA, the GSC and
the ASSU in the future.
GSC members who voted to over
turn the bylaws said then* decision
was motivated by two factors: first,
the lack of input from the greater
Stanford community before the
adoption of the bylaws and, second,
the content of the bylaws themselves.
The BJA is a 15-member Univer
sity committee composed of six stu
dents, six faculty members and three
administrators. The board meets
twice a month and is tasked with
overseeing, clarifying and regularly
reviewing the Student Judicial Char
ter of 1997. The Office of Community
Standards (OCS) is then responsible

for enforcing the charter and bylaws.
On May 21 and June 4, the board
voted to add eight new bylaws to the
charter the first such change in
more than eight years.
According to Miles Seiver 'l4, a
BJA member last year and BJA co
chair this year, the board collectively
spent hundreds of hours working on
the new bylaws before members vot
ed to adopt them.
"I can't quantify how much time
we spent last year in subcommittee
and at meetings thinking about these
issues and coming to the conclusions
that we did," Seiver said at the Un
dergraduate Senate meeting on Oct.
22, while arguing that the new bylaws

should be kept. "Wordsmithing it.
Making sure that it's tight and right.
Going back and forth. Agreeing and
disagreeing... these are not bylaws
that came out of nowhere."
But some student leaders, such as
GSC Parliamentarian Paul Harold
J.D. 'l4, who drafted the passed bill
to overturn the bylaws, argued the
BJA should have sought input from
students beyond those serving on
the board during the process.
In addition, Harold cited concerns
with how the BJA chose to notify stu
dents that it had adopted the bylaws.
According to Section 111.A.2 of
the Student Judicial Charter,
"Whenever the Board adopts
or modifies its bylaws, it shall
inform the community, and
shall forward the text of the
changes to the chair of the
Undergraduate Senate of the
Associated Students of Stan
ford University, the chair of
the Graduate Student Coun
cil of the Associated Students
of Stanford University, the
chair of the Senate of the Ac
ademic Council and the Pres
ident of the University"
Harold admitted the
board technically followed
this procedure. The board,
through OCS Director Koren
Bakkegard, sent an email on
June 11 to the four parties

specified in the charter.
However, Harold said this
email notification was not
clear that the B JA had actual
ly adopted the bylaws, espe
cially since the announcement
only came within the text of
two attachments that had the
word "proposed" in the title.
He added that the B JA al
so did not carry out the spirit
of the charter, which states
the board "shall inform the
community" about any
changes to the bylaws.
The Undergraduate Senate
and GSC first realized in the fall
that the bylaws had been adopt
ed when Bakkegard sent a sec
ond email. In the Sept. 25 mes
sage, Bakkegard reiterated
the adoption of bylaws and
stated that either student
legislative body had the pow
er to overturn them at any
time.
When the Undergraduate

Senate on Tuesday failed to
pass a bill overturning the
bylaws, the decision fell upon
the GSC.
"We didn't know there
would be that type of pres
sure on us," Martin said. "In
the end, I don't think it affect
ed the way people voted...
but it did raise the stakes,
since only one of the legisla
tive bodies needs to over
rule."
Reid Spitz 'l4, president
of the Student Justice Proj
ect, said the Senate's decision
not to veto the bylaws Tues
day also put increased pres
sure on him to attend and
speak at Wednesday's GSC
meeting. The Student Justice
Project, a new campus group,
alleges that Stanford's judicial
process remains implicitly
slanted towards finding re
spondents guilty.
Spitz said he believes the

bylaws do not merely define a
term in the charter or a proce
dure to enforce the charter
and, as a result, should have
been passed as amendments,
which must be approved by
the B JA, as well as the Under
graduate Senate, GSC, Aca
demic Council and University
President.
Besides this point, he said
the bylaws are not necessary.
"It's the Justice Project's
position that we don't need
the bylaws —we don't need a
change to the charter," Spitz
said. "The charter itself is re
ally g00d... the only problem
is that the charter's not en
forced. All you have to do is
refer to the charter, enforce
the charter, and we wouldn't
need to be passing the by
laws."

The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) last Wednesday approved a
bill overturning eight new bylaws to
the Student Judicial Charter, in part
because members said they had not
been included in conversations before
the bylaws were adopted.
The decision came nearly five
months after the Board on Judicial
Affair's (BJA) first adopted the by
laws and a day after the Undergrad
uate Senate, in a split 7-7 vote, failed
to pass a counter-part bill that would
have overturned the same bylaws.
