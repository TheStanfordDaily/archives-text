Zach Batteer knows the im
portance of scoring at the
right time.
The junior's two goals Fri
day night against the USF
Dons (5-7-2,2-2-1 West Coast
Conference), including the
game winner in the first peri
od of overtime, helped Stan
ford (7-4-2, 1-3-1 Pac-12) re
turn to winning ways with a
2-1 victory.

The Cardinal finishes
nonconference play with an
impressive 6-1-1 record,
something which will defi
nitely be looked upon kindly
when the selection committee
is poring over the books be
fore setting the field for the
NCAA Tournament.
The game was a very tight

ly contested affair from the
opening minutes, with some
crunching tackles being
thrown around and the teams
finding little to separate them.
A superb piece of skill by jun
ior forward Batteer was per
haps the highlight of the open
ing 20 minutes, as he tamed
two defenders inside out with
a flick and turn before seeing
his cross palmed by USF's
junior goalie Chase Hauser.
USF had a penalty appeal
turned down when junior for
ward Miguel Aguilar was
taken down by sophomore
defender Brandon Vincent,
leading to huge protestations
from USF coach Erik Visser.
However, near the end of the
first half, Stanford began to
dominate, with senior mid
fielder JJ Koval sending two
shots at Hauser and Batteer
nearly getting on the end of a
cross from sophomore
winger Aaron Kovar.
Stanford's dominance

continued after the break,
with Koval seeing his shot
tipped over by a diving
Hauser. The breakthrough fi
nally came in the 63rd
minute, when sophomore
midfielder iy Thompson laid
the ball off to freshman for
ward Jordan Morris, whose
cross was spilled by Hauser
into the path of Batteer, who
nodded home the rebound.
After the goal, however,
Stanford seemed to become
slightly complacent and USF
got back into the game, with
senior forward Liam Kelly
barely missing with a header.
This momentum led to the
equalizer: Sophomore mid
fielder Jesus del Toro scored
his third goal of the season
after a broken play that
stemmed from Aguilar's
header rolling short.
The Dons almost won the
game in regular time, as Kel
ly beat freshman defender
Brian Nana-Sinkam before
seeing his dipping shot beat
en away by senior goalie
Drew Hutchins, whose save
was equally as important as
Batteer's two goals.
The overtime period
flowed back and forth, with
both teams seeing good
chances saved by goalkeep
ers who seemed desperate to
prolong the tension that per
vaded Cagan Stadium. Bat
teer saw his shot by Hauser,
while Kelly saw a superb shot
saved by a diving Hutchins,
who flew to his left to push
the ball away. Batteer struck
again in the 97th minute for
his team-leading seventh
goal. From a iy Thompson
cross, Hauser failed to fully
clear with his punch and the
ball fell to Batteer, who
lashed a first-time volley into
the right-hand side of the
goal. Ripping off his shirt in
jubilance and mobbed by
teammates, Hauser made
sure his celebration showed
how important a victory this
was to Stanford after it had
been so close to slipping
through their fingers.
The Cardinal will wel
come the fourth-ranked
UCLA Bruins next Friday
night in a return to confer
ence play. The match is
scheduled to begin at Cagan
Stadium at 6 p.m.

Junior forward Zach Batteer (above) scored two goals to
lead the Cardinal past USF Friday night. Stanford had
been on the losing end of many close matches before
Friday's win. Stanford will now refocus on Pac-12 play.
Zach Batteer knows the im
portance of scoring at the
right time.
The junior's two goals Fri
day night against the USF
Dons (5-7-2,2-2-1 West Coast
Conference), including the
game winner in the first peri
od of overtime, helped Stan
ford (7-4-2, 1-3-1 Pac-12) re
turn to winning ways with a
2-1 victory.

The Cardinal finishes
nonconference play with an
impressive 6-1-1 record,
something which will defi
nitely be looked upon kindly
when the selection committee
is poring over the books be
fore setting the field for the
NCAA Tournament.
The game was a very tight

ly contested affair from the
opening minutes, with some
crunching tackles being
thrown around and the teams
finding little to separate them.
A superb piece of skill by jun
ior forward Batteer was per
haps the highlight of the open
ing 20 minutes, as he tamed
two defenders inside out with
a flick and turn before seeing
his cross palmed by USF's
junior goalie Chase Hauser.
USF had a penalty appeal
turned down when junior for
ward Miguel Aguilar was
taken down by sophomore
defender Brandon Vincent,
leading to huge protestations
from USF coach Erik Visser.
However, near the end of the
first half, Stanford began to
dominate, with senior mid
fielder JJ Koval sending two
shots at Hauser and Batteer
nearly getting on the end of a
cross from sophomore
winger Aaron Kovar.
Stanford's dominance

continued after the break,
with Koval seeing his shot
tipped over by a diving
Hauser. The breakthrough fi
nally came in the 63rd
minute, when sophomore
midfielder iy Thompson laid
the ball off to freshman for
ward Jordan Morris, whose
cross was spilled by Hauser
into the path of Batteer, who
nodded home the rebound.
After the goal, however,
Stanford seemed to become
slightly complacent and USF
got back into the game, with
senior forward Liam Kelly
barely missing with a header.
This momentum led to the
equalizer: Sophomore mid
fielder Jesus del Toro scored
his third goal of the season
after a broken play that
stemmed from Aguilar's
header rolling short.
The Dons almost won the
game in regular time, as Kel
ly beat freshman defender
Brian Nana-Sinkam before
seeing his dipping shot beat
en away by senior goalie
Drew Hutchins, whose save
was equally as important as
Batteer's two goals.
The overtime period
flowed back and forth, with
both teams seeing good
chances saved by goalkeep
ers who seemed desperate to
prolong the tension that per
vaded Cagan Stadium. Bat
teer saw his shot by Hauser,
while Kelly saw a superb shot
saved by a diving Hutchins,
who flew to his left to push
the ball away. Batteer struck
again in the 97th minute for
his team-leading seventh
goal. From a iy Thompson
cross, Hauser failed to fully
clear with his punch and the
ball fell to Batteer, who
lashed a first-time volley into
the right-hand side of the
goal. Ripping off his shirt in
jubilance and mobbed by
teammates, Hauser made
sure his celebration showed
how important a victory this
was to Stanford after it had
been so close to slipping
through their fingers.
The Cardinal will wel
come the fourth-ranked
UCLA Bruins next Friday
night in a return to confer
ence play. The match is
scheduled to begin at Cagan
Stadium at 6 p.m.
