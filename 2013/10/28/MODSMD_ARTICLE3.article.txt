## Minimum wage rise debated Stanford split on CA bill to raise minimum wage to $10 
### PETER MOON 
The Stanford community holds
mixed opinions on the potential ben
efits and harm from the California
state legislature's recent decision to
pass a bill that will elevate the
state's minimum wage from $8 an
hour to $9 by July 2014 and $lO by
January 2016.
The bill, signed into law by Gov
ernor Jerry Brown, will create the
highest minimum wage in any state
in the United States and cap Califor
nia's steady increase in its minimum
wage standard over the last two
decades.
"The minimum wage has not
kept pace with rising costs," Brown
said in a press release. "This legisla
tion is overdue and will help families
that are struggling in this harsh
economy."
Marcos Guen Lopez 'l7, a resi
dent of Upland, Calif., agrees with
Brown's intentions behind signing
the bill into law.
"You can't do much with the min
imum wage with such high costs,"
Lopez said. "A person with a family
cannot survive on the [current] min
imum wage."
David Grusky, director of Stan
ford's Center for Poverty and
Inequality who studied income
inequality and the labor market, al
so cited the measure's present ne
cessity.
"We have languished at a very
low minimum wage for way
too long," Grusky said. "Cali
fornia is the land of working
poverty."
Grusky added that, de
spite economic models pre
dicting negative repercus
sions, in reality there are no
substantial negative impacts
on California's current econ
omy. He hopes that the mini
mum wage will act as a stim
ulus to combat the increasing
poverty in California and in
vigorate the state's slow eco
nomic recovery.
However, other Stanford
experts believe that the new
legislation may actually be
detrimental to the Californ
ian economy.
Caroline Hoxby, profes
sor of economics and senior
fellow of the Hoover Institu
tion, explained that Califor
nia's economy went into re
cession quickly but will slow
ly recover. She argued that
the legislation is potentially
problematic during the cur
rent period of recession.
"People who lose their
jobs when minimum wage is
raised are usually people
who have difficulty finding
jobs," Hoxby said. "There
fore, during recession, the
economy is especially likely
to hurt the people who are
poorest."
Another potential danger
of elevating minimum wage

is the movement of jobs to
bordering states, such as
Oregon, Nevada and Ari
zona, which have lower mini
mum wages. Hoxby warns
that an employer who is lo
cated in California could re
locate his or her businesses
to other states nearby for
cheaper labor.
Brandon Camhi 'l6, edi
tor in chief of the Stanford
Economics Journal, also ar
gues against the measure.
"An increase in minimum

wage will adversely affect
economic growth of Califor
nia," Camhi said. "Employ
ment is still slow, so you are
going to dis-incentivize em
ployers from hiring most
people. Furthermore, this is
going to affect those who are
priced out of the market,
such as single moms or those
who are truly dependent on
the minimum wage."
Hoxby suggested other
alternatives to helping Cali
fornians.

"The most important
thing is introducing more
certainty on how regulations
are applied," Hoxby said.
"Furthermore, federal is
sues, health care law and re
ducing other regulations or
taxes can all be improved."
"California has a high tax
in the economy. We have to
take steps to reduce those,"
she added.
