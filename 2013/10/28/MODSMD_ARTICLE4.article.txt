# SHUT IT DOWN
## DOMINANT DEFENSE RETURNS TO RESCUE CARDINAL 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
For better or worse, the current
state of Stanford football is bring
ing back vivid memories of the 2012
season: a smothering defense bail
ing out an inconsistent offense over
and over... and over.

On a night when the Cardinal
offense suffered an identity crisis,
the defense put on one of its gritti
est performances of the season
capped by a thrilling goal line
stand, no less to help No. 6 Stan
ford outlast No. 25 Oregon State
20-12 within the hostile confines of
Reser Stadium and move into sole
possession of second place behind
Oregon in the Pac-12 North stand
ings.
Even the nation's most prolific
quarterback-wide receiver duo
could not unlock Stanford's de
fense, as the Cardinal sacked
Beavers passer Sean Mannion
eight times Mannion was sacked
just nine times in his last seven
games and limited wide receiver
Brandin Cooks to 80 receiving
yards and a touchdown. Though
the dominant defensive perform
ance was a collective effort, fifth
year senior outside linebacker
Trent Muiphy made his presence
known in the backfield with 3i/2
tackles for loss, including 2i/2 sacks,
and tipped passes even when he
could not get to Mannion.
"Defensively, I thought we
played extremely well against the
No. 1 quarterback and No. 1 wide
receiver in the nation," said head

coach David Shaw. "It was a great
game plan by [defensive coordina
tor] Derek Mason, an outstanding
game plan. We knew [Oregon State]
was going to make some plays, but
to hold down Cooks was phenome
nal."
Down by eight points, Mannion
and company had a chance to tie the

game when a 28-yard punt return
and two ensuing receptions by the
explosive Cooks gave the Beavers
the ball at the Cardinal 7-yard line
with 20 seconds remaining and no
timeouts left. But the Cardinal de
fense held its ground and forced
four straight incompletions sen
ior safety Ed Reynolds knocked the

ball out of receiver Kevin Cum
mings' hands in the end zone on the
last pass attempt to seal the road
victory.
Though senior running back
Tyler Gaffney rushed for 149 yards
and three touchdowns on 22 carries,

Cardinal's 20-12 victory Saturday night in Corvallis.The defense finished with eight sacks, a new season high.
the Cardinal offense did its defensive
counterpart no favors for most of the
game. Junior quarterback Kevin
Hogan had perhaps the shakiest per
formance of his career, going 8-of-18
passing for just 88 yards while com
pleting only three passes to Stanford's
most dangerous offensive weapon,
junior wideout Ty Montgomery.
"Offensively, we didn't play well
enough," Shaw said. "We missed too
many things in the passing game
our quarterback, receiver and coach.
We can do so much better. Ty Mont
gomery needs more opportunities
with the ball in his hands."
The first quarter proved to be a de
fensive battle with Stanford going
three-and-out twice and Oregon State
unable to jumpstart its passing game.
The Cardinal drove down to the
Beavers 17 on its second possession of
the game, but a botched handoff be
tween sophomore quarterback Dallas
Lloyd and senior running back Ricky
Seale in the read-option package re
sulted in the first of two inopportune
turnovers committed by Stanford.
Beavers kicker Trevor Romaine
nailed a 50-yard field goal at the start
of the second quarter to give his team
a 3-0 lead, but the Cardinal defense
shut down Oregon State's aerial at
tack for most of the first half. The
Beavers mustered just 99 yards of to
tal offense while Cooks was held to
two receptions for 2 yards through the
first two quarters. TMce in the second
quarter, the Beavers went for it on
fourth-and-short while in field goal
range, but were stopped both times.
"[We did] what we do best: stop
ping the run," said Reynolds, who
came up with four solo tackles in addi
tion to his game-sealing pass breakup.
"In the back end, play top down, put a
top on [Cook] where you limit his ex
plosive plays, because on film, that's
where he's been great at all year."
Just when it seemed as if the Car
dinal was in danger of facing a three
point deficit heading into halftime,
Hogan found Montgomery down the
sideline for 37 yards on third-and-12 to
put Stanford at the Beaver 31 with 27
seconds left in the first half. Two plays
later, Hogan made his best play of the
night with a 23-yard scramble down to
the Beavers' 4-yard line. Hogan then
handed the ball off to Gaffney, who
somehow stayed on his feet and pow
ered his way into the end zone after
initially running into a wall of linemen.
The Cardinal carried its momen
tum into the first play of the third

quarter, when junior cornerback
Wayne Lyons forced a fumble on the
kickoff that fell into the hands of sen
ior linebacker Joe Hemschoot. Two
plays later, Gaffney punched it in from
nine yards out for his second touch
down of the night to give Stanford a
13-3 lead sophomore Conrad
Ukropina's PAT attempt was no good.
Mannion and Cooks finally began
to establish a connection as the two
hooked up for an 8-yard touchdown in
the waning moments of the third quar
ter, but Stanford struck back when the

Cardinal offensive line opened up a
huge hole that allowed Gaffney to
burst free for a 32-yard touchdown
run and give Stanford a 20-9 lead.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal defense con
tinued to hold down the fort in the
fourth quarter, with senior inside line
backer A. J. Tarpley playing excellent
pass coverage and on his way to col
lecting a game-high 13 tackles, eight of
which were solo efforts.
But just when Stanford was on the
verge of putting the game away,
Gaffney uncharacteristically lost a

fumble at his own 25-yard line to give
the Beavers new life.
"It was unacceptable," Gaffney
said. "They put trust in me, and I lost
a little focus. I couldn't tell what hap
pened, but it was unacceptable."
Stanford's defense did not break
and forced Oregon State to settle for a
field goal, but the Cardinal offense
went three-and-out on its next posses
sion, setting up the Beavers' furious
last-minute drive and the Cardinal's
goal line stand.
"Offensively, we put our defense in
some tough spots," Shaw said. "I want
to give [Oregon State] credit, as mad
as I am with our effort on the offensive
side. Their pass rush was so phenome
nal. I know it was loud and we've
been to loud stadiums before but
they got after us on the pass rush. It
wasn't just [Beavers defensive end]
Scott Criehton and I've always re
spected that man but it was the
whole group up front."
With the victory against Oregon
State, Stanford remains in control of
its Rose Bowl destiny, and, though it
will need a lot of help, a national cham
pionship berth is still possible, even if
unlikely. The Cardinal now turns its
attention to undefeated No. 2 Oregon
following a bye week for both teams.
How would have Stanford's per
formance on Saturday fared against
Oregon?
"It wasn't good enough to beat
Oregon or good enough to be in the
game against Oregon," Shaw said.
Stanford and Oregon will battle for
Pac-12 North supremacy on Nov. 7.
