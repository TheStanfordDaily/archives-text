# SHUT IT DOWN
## DOMINANT DEFENSE RETURNS TO RESCUE CARDINAL 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
For better or worse, the current
state of Stanford football is bring
ing back vivid memories of the 2012
season: a smothering defense bail
ing out an inconsistent offense over
and over... and over.

On a night when the Cardinal
offense suffered an identity crisis,
the defense put on one of its gritti
est performances of the season
capped by a thrilling goal line
stand, no less to help No. 6 Stan
ford outlast No. 25 Oregon State
20-12 within the hostile confines of
Reser Stadium and move into sole
possession of second place behind
Oregon in the Pac-12 North stand
ings.
Even the nation's most prolific
quarterback-wide receiver duo
could not unlock Stanford's de
fense, as the Cardinal sacked
Beavers passer Sean Mannion
eight times Mannion was sacked
just nine times in his last seven
games and limited wide receiver
Brandin Cooks to 80 receiving
yards and a touchdown. Though
the dominant defensive perform
ance was a collective effort, fifth
year senior outside linebacker
Trent Muiphy made his presence
known in the backfield with 3i/2
tackles for loss, including 2i/2 sacks,
and tipped passes even when he
could not get to Mannion.
"Defensively, I thought we
played extremely well against the
No. 1 quarterback and No. 1 wide
receiver in the nation," said head

coach David Shaw. "It was a great
game plan by [defensive coordina
tor] Derek Mason, an outstanding
game plan. We knew [Oregon State]
was going to make some plays, but
to hold down Cooks was phenome
nal."
Down by eight points, Mannion
and company had a chance to tie the

game when a 28-yard punt return
and two ensuing receptions by the
explosive Cooks gave the Beavers
the ball at the Cardinal 7-yard line
with 20 seconds remaining and no
timeouts left. But the Cardinal de
fense held its ground and forced
four straight incompletions sen
ior safety Ed Reynolds knocked the

ball out of receiver Kevin Cum
mings' hands in the end zone on the
last pass attempt to seal the road
victory.
Though senior running back
Tyler Gaffney rushed for 149 yards
and three touchdowns on 22 carries,
