## PWR to launch Notation in Science Writing in winter 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
The Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) will launch its
new Notation in Science Writing
program this winter quarter in an
effort to help science and engi
neering majors develop their
communications skills.
According to Nicholas Jenk
ins, associate professor of English
and faculty director of PWR, the
Notation intended for sopho
mores and juniors follows the
national movement of universities
offering certificates and other
supplements to the traditional col
lege degree. Jenkins believes that
this trend is especially relevant to
science fields.
"Interdisciplinary communica
tion between scientists is itself a
challenge now because the fields
are so different," Jenkins said.

He explained that planning for
the science Notation program be
gan about two years ago. Coincid
ing with the values of the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) report, the No
tation emphasizes flexibility in its
requirements and curriculum.
"One of the things that we
were aware of is that a lot of ma
jors in the sciences and engineer
ing are very unit-heavy so the re
quirements are arduous," Jenkins
said. "There are classes that we
ask people to take for the Nota
tion, but we try to keep it to a min
imum."
Participants will create an
ePortfolio with the help of individ
ual advisors in PWR and in their
majors' departments. Incorporat
ing classwork and students' per
sonal reflections, the portfolio

Nicholas Jenkins, associate professor of English and faculty director of PWR, hopes that the new Notation in
Science Writing program will provide science and engineering majors an opportunity to improve communication.
