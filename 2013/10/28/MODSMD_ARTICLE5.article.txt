## PWR to launch Notation in Science Writing in winter 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
The Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) will launch its
new Notation in Science Writing
program this winter quarter in an
effort to help science and engi
neering majors develop their
communications skills.
According to Nicholas Jenk
ins, associate professor of English
and faculty director of PWR, the
Notation intended for sopho
mores and juniors follows the
national movement of universities
offering certificates and other
supplements to the traditional col
lege degree. Jenkins believes that
this trend is especially relevant to
science fields.
"Interdisciplinary communica
tion between scientists is itself a
challenge now because the fields
are so different," Jenkins said.

He explained that planning for
the science Notation program be
gan about two years ago. Coincid
ing with the values of the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) report, the No
tation emphasizes flexibility in its
requirements and curriculum.
"One of the things that we
were aware of is that a lot of ma
jors in the sciences and engineer
ing are very unit-heavy so the re
quirements are arduous," Jenkins
said. "There are classes that we
ask people to take for the Nota
tion, but we try to keep it to a min
imum."
Participants will create an
ePortfolio with the help of individ
ual advisors in PWR and in their
majors' departments. Incorporat

Nicholas Jenkins, associate professor of English and faculty director of PWR, hopes that the new Notation in
Science Writing program will provide science and engineering majors an opportunity to improve communication.
acts as the final capstone as
sessment and will remain in
the Stanford digital reposi
tory following completion of
the program. Except for two
required one- or two-unit
classes at the beginning and
end of the program, students
can choose the courses they
want to count toward the
Notation.
"We're not trying to mi
cromanage what students
take," Jenkins said. "If
you're a computer scientist,
for example, maybe there's a
course in electrical engineer
ing that looks like it might
have a good applicability to
the Notation ... as long as
your advisor approves, you
can count it for the Notation."
Advanced PWR courses
centered on science commu
nication and geared to qualify
for the Notation will also be
offered this winter quarter.
Jennifer Stonaker, a PWR
lecturer, will be teaching a
new class PWR 91JS: Inter
mediate Writing: Stanford
Science Podcast, in which
students will act as journal
ists and interview professors
and researchers around cam
pus.
"My goal is to talk a little
bit about audience. Scientists
have to speak not just to their
colleagues but also the gener
al public," Stonaker said. "We
can decide... how to target
our content to reach that type
of audience."
Stonaker, who said she en
joys listening to science pod
casts in her free time, earned

her Ph.D. in plant biology
and genetics and has first
hand experience in both sci
ence research and education.
She explained that the cur
riculum will focus on how to
produce and edit podcasts,
and the final products will be
available to the public.
"I don't really know how
many other podcasting class
es in general are being
taught, but it's definitely not
at Stanford or at other uni
versities," Stonaker said.
"It's fun to design from basi
cally the ground up and see
how it goes."
Although there is current
ly no cap on the number of
students PWR will accept in
to the Notation program,
Jenkins hopes the program
will start small to give stu
dents more individual atten
tion.
"We see this as being a
template for Notations that
could be in other fields in the
University as well," Jenkins
said. "We wanted to start
with the sciences and engi
neering because I think most
people would say that's
where the greatest gap usu
ally is between the amount of
writing you have to do in one
of those majors, and the
amount of writing that might
be helpful for you."
Jenkins explained that
once a student has completed
the Notation, the "Notation
in Science Writing" would
appear on the participant's
transcript.
"Companies look for peo
ple who have strong commu
nication skills, so I hope that
[the Notation] will make
Stanford students more mar
ketable," Jenkins said.
Jenkins also explained

that PWR wants the pro
gram to be accessible to stu
dents of all communication
skill levels.
"Our goal is to help you
become a better communica
tor," Jenkins said. "Whether
you're an unconfident scien
tist communicator or you're a
very confident one who'd like
to get better, our Notation
will apply and be relevant to
you, whoever you are."
While it is still too early to
gauge student interest, Asso
ciate Director of PWR Zach
Waggoner said he has been
receiving inquiries about the
program.
"I've fielded some emails,
students expressing interest,
wanting to know a little bit
more," Waggoner said. "We
have a few information ses
sions coming up, so I'm giv
ing them a little bit more in
formation but also then en
couraging them to attend our
Q&A sessions coming up in
Hume Center."
Interested students can
attend the open-house infor
mation session on Wednes
day, Oct. 30, at the Hume
Writing Center for Writing
and Speaking. Applications
for the Notation close at 5
p.m. on Nov. 1. Applicants
will be notified of the results
on Wednesday, Nov. 13.
"I believe in the power of
communication," Jenkins
said. "I strongly believe that
words and speech and visual
rhetoric are things every
body in the University has a
stake in, and this Notation is
designed to help people
claim ownership of those
powers."
