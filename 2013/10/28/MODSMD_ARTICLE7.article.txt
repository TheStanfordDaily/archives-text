## Mendicants perform 50th anniversary concert 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
On Saturday night, 131 alumni and cur
rent members of the Stanford Mendicants
performed at the group's 50th anniversary
concert at the Bing Concert Hall. They per
formed in groups divided by decades before
they all gathered to sing their classic song
"Delia" and the "Stanford Hymn" on stage.

The Stanford Mendicants were Stan
ford's first a capella group, founded in 1963
by Hank Adams '64, a Yale transfer student.
Founded with the express purpose of sere
nading and subsequently wooing Stanford
women, the Mendicants' first performance
was in Branner Hall, which at the time was
an all-female dormitory.

The a cappella group has changed quite
a bit since then, both in their performance
style and performance attire. The signature
red jacket, white dress-shirt and stone-col
ored pants that the Mendicants currently

wear have been around for only the past six
years.
"For a while we had baseball jerseys, for
10 years or so," said Nicholas Moores 'l5,
former president of the Mendicants. "There
was a year where we had jeans, a red shirt
and khaki jacket."
Ephraim Swanson-Dusenbury '92, who
sang with the Mendicants from 1990-92 and
whose name is hidden in the bass line of the
Mendicants' rearrangement of the song
"Runaround Sue," said that the current
Mendicants' incarnation is much more put
together than what he recalls.
"These guys are a lot more polished
even at an early stage, even more than we
were," Swanson-Dusenbury said. "The way
they choreograph, they really know about
having stage presence. For us it was always
an afterthought."
When Swanson-Dusenbury was a fresh
man, the Mendicants celebrated their 25th
year anniversary. He described this year's

reunion as "the circle of life" now that 25
more years has passed since.
"This is the kind of experience you don't
have a lot," Swanson-Dusenbury said.
"Your peers span a large age range. It's
kind of like having snapshots of yourself at
different ages. You see all these future
selves that you might grow into."
Ira Fischler M.A. '7O Ph.D. '73 was one
of the few singers who joined the Mendi
cants as a graduate student, travelling all
the way from Gainesville, Flaâ€ž to join Sat
urday's celebration.
"The singers still seem stronger and
younger and more talented, but the core of
the group and ideas and camaraderie is still
there," Fischler said.
Fischler recalled some of his favorite
memories with the Mendicants, including
concerts in Memorial Church and a very
successful Christmas concert.
"We didn't do any traveling back in those
days," Fischler said. "The singing was very

local, from here up to San Francisco. I re
member the rehearsals and recording ses
sions and playing golf at the Stanford
course with two of the other Mendicants I
was singing with.
"One of them also went to my wedding,"
he added.
Some of the songs that Fischler recalls
from the '7os includes "Coney Island Wash
board" and "Bye Bye Blues," in which Fis
chler had a solo and scat piece.
"[We sung] in stairwells or under arches,
late at night when we had no business being
awake and not studying," Swanson-Dusen
bery said. "Just singing with the guys like
me who didn't know when it was time to quit
and go home, and had almost an obsession
with singing."
The classic songs, such as "Brown-Eyed
Girl" and "Runaround Sue," were first sung
during the '9os. According to Swanson-

Current, former members of the Stanford Mendicants, the oldest a capella group on campus, gathered at the Bing Concert Hall to perform a medley of their timeless classics.
Dusenbery, many of the
arrangements sung by the
Mendicants those years
were written by former mu
sical director John Liv
ingston '93.
"With our group, what
I'm proud of was that we
brought back some arrange
ments from the past. We
honored the past traditions
and also contributed to the
future groups," Swanson-
Dusenbery said. "And com
ing back to see people you

actually sang with. That's
one of the deepest bonds
it's almost a kind of brother
hood. We would tend to call
ourselves like a fraternity."
The 15 members of the
current Mendicants also had
an inspiring experience see
ing the history of their group
right before them.
"Last year when I was a
freshman, I didn't feel much
of the alumni connection,"
said Ben Isaacs 'l6, current
president of the Mendicants.
"Just being here today
sort of made me realize how
cool it is to be part of this.
It's like talking to Stanford
alumni, but we all share a lot
more things in common. It's

really neat to be able to re
late to all these different
people," Issacs added.
Regardless of its various
incarnations over the years,
the Stanford Mendicants
has maintained its core
ideals.
"What has always been
our common thread and
what will continue to be our
common thread is that we
don't burn so hard on the
music that we defer to have
fun," Moores said. "The fact
that we have fun adds a di
mension to the perform
ance."
