# BOOK REVIEW
## "The Circle" depicts tech culture flaws 
### JENN SCHAFFER 
Start-up eyebrows. It's this tick I noticed when I ar
rived at Stanford, that thing when someone's hinting
about his idea for a new company and his eyebrows arch,
ever so slightly, before he launches into a practiced-casu
al pitch with this surreal earnestness, this untrustworthy
trust-me grin, convincing you how his idea will undeni
ably change the world for the better.
It is this rehearsed sincerity, this unironic belief in the
unquestionable capital-"g" Goodness of the tech-utopia
mission (hey, Do No Evil), which Bay Area literary giant
Dave Eggers most brilliantly captures in his latest novel,
"The Circle."
Eggers' fifth novel follows 24-year-old Carleton Col
lege graduate Mae Holland as she begins work at The
Company Where Everyone Wants To Work: the Circle.
And how precisely Mae's irritation at her first post-col
lege job and her subsequent, profound relief at finding
work at the Circle mirror the Stanford senior's anxi
ety surrounding job interviews and second rounds at
Facebook. How familiar is her clumsy setting-aside of
ethical qualms as we ourselves grasp for reassurance
that we will have a cushy campus to land on after we
leave our present pseudo-paradise.
Mae's gratitude for having found that trifecta of
meaningful work and full-coverage healthcare and the
envy of her peers renders her prone before the Circle's
commands. With Mae as his protagonist, Eggers shines a
brutal light on how the most liberal-artsy among us no
less than the minimum-humanities-requirement engi
neer can be swept up blind into the sturdy arms of sta
bility and prestige that Silicon Valley offers bright young
minds in abundance.
The grand seduction of the Circle, for Mae, is its

ever-arched eyebrows, its
convincing display of good
will for humanity. One Circler
is working to create a track
ing chip to embed into kids'
bones in order to elimi
nate child abductions world
wide. Mae's mind alights with
the possibility that Circlers
can solve millennia-long
problems through the power
of technology and sheer force
of will.
Other ideas motion
sensors in private homes to
prevent domestic violence;
facial recognition cameras on
city streets to eliminate
racial profiling embody
the type of let's-solve-every
human-problem-with-an-app
attitude that pervades the
Stanford bubble. At Eggers'
disappointingly obvious urg
ing, we realize the terrifying
implications of such benevo
lently conceived, beautifully
designed technology, but will
Mae? In an environment that
mocks or destroys all chal
lenges to the Circle ethos,
critical thinking is dimin
ished to the faintest ding.
The Circle masks worka
holism as community, a cul
ture that thrives on total par
ticipation. Mae receives re
peated slaps on the wrist
when she leaves the Circle
campus. "We never want you
to leave!" her bosses grin. As
Mae becomes assimilated in

to the Circle culture, Eggers'
narrative becomes increas
ingly locked in on the Circle
campus, with scant scenes
set in the world beyond. Eg
gers must intend the claus
trophobic effect this has on
his reader, but the novel's
"off-campus" moments be
come heavy-handed for their
rarity, as though they are
meant to stand for All Hu
man Experience.
While Mae is an empa
thetic character at the nov
el's opening, it becomes clear
early in the narrative that
Eggers will not be expending
much of his 491 pages to the
development of her or any
character. Mae's best friend,
Annie, is a brightly crafted
character for the screen but
something of a two-dimen
sional character on the page
the popular, ambitious,
blonde Stanford GSB gradu
ate may well be a real per
son, but she comes across ar
chetypal in "The Circle."
Eggers' powers of human
depiction are at their
strongest when describing
Francis, the exact replica of
so many guys (not quite
boys, certainly not men) one
meets in the Valley: witty,
sardonic, magnetic at one
moment, but over-the-line,
crude and socially unaware
the next. After an abbreviat
ed romp in the Circle dorm
rooms, Francis asks Mae to
rate his performance on a
scale of 1 to 100. She thinks
he's joking. He's not.
But beyond these sparse,
"too real" moments, Eggers

seems largely uninterested
in creating human charac
ters instead of parabolic
everymen. The price "The
Circle" pays to make Eg
ger's prescient point loud
and clear is the same thing
the Circle lacks as a compa
ny: human complexity.
"The Circle" until its
concluding pages, which rush
forward with the pace and
predictability of a Dan
Brown novel hovers be
tween excellent, dystopian
sci-fi and biting, light-of-day
realism. The week of the
book's release, Facebook an
nounced new features: ex
panded facial recognition
technology and reduced pri
vacy for teenage users. As al
ways, there was brief out
rage and then swift, silent ac
ceptance.
But the society Eggers
depicts either accepts the
Circle wholeheartedly or re
treats, literally, into the
woods. And while Eggers'
forefinger rests heavy on the
pulse of the Bay, his prose
and plot are far from the
electrifying, Adderall-heart
beat energy of his earlier
works. In an office outfitted
with "See Change" cameras,
the last private space is the
bathroom. The most convinc
ing moment of connection in
"The Circle" is a quickie in a
bathroom stall. What was the
last moment that felt real to
you? Was it something you
could Snap or save?
