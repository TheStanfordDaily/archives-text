# STUDENT LIFE
## Mausoleum sees high attendance 
### SKYLAR COHEN 
Miley Cyrus, Calvin and Hobbes, Walter
White, Spider Man and various Angry Birds all
made appearances at this year's Stanford Mau
soleum party.
The Saturday evening event was themed after
the electronic music artist deadmaus. Despite
overlapping with the Stanford football game
against Oregon State University, the event saw
high attendance.
The most prominent feature of this year's
party was the music, mixed by student DJs Dar
tis Willis 'l5 and Ricky Tran 'l5. The Junior Class
cabinet, which hosted the event, voted to feature
the DJs side by side, rather than choosing one
over the other.
"I was just so impressed by them," said
Daniel Knapp 'l5, junior class co-president. "I
think they both went well with the theme, just in
totally different ways."
In keeping with the rave theme, glow sticks
were distributed to the first 800 arrivals. The
photo booth was a consistent crowd pleaser, with
a steady line of more than 20 students at any giv
en time. The event organizers spent a large
amount of time and effort into setting up the
lighting system that led from the main road to
the event, designed to recall raves associated

Despite the coinciding Stanford vs. Oregon State football game, this year's attendance at the rave-themed Mausoleum party was
still high with students decking out in crazy costumes and dancing to the beats of DJs Dartis Willis '15 and Ricky Tran '15.

According to Jacob
Dalder 'l5, chair of the Mau
soleum event, equipment
known as Gobo rotators were
used in conjunction with col
ored gels to create a unique
light pattern projected into
the trees.
A large factor in planning
each year's event is the need
to find economical yet effec
tive thematic touches to stay
within the budget, which
Knapp said the coordinators
were able to achieve this
year.
"I think funding is always
a challenge," Knapp said.
"Pricing goes up and budgets
might not, so we have to
think creatively, which Jacob
by leading the team definite
ly did."
The party hit its stride af

ter Stanford wrapped up its
20-12 victory against Oregon
State. A Facebook post at 11
p.m. encouraged those who
had just finished watching
the game to celebrate at the
Mausoleum, and the atten
dance grew.
The event organizers
were aware of the potential
for students putting them
selves in danger due to exces
sive alcohol consumption. A
key part of this safety en
forcement occurred at the
entrance to the party, with
staffers manning the en
trance looking for warning
signs. Dalder noted that if a
student was deemed ineligi
ble to enter the party, the or
ganizers would guarantee the
student a safe way to get
home and have medics help
him or her if necessary.
The Cardinal Nights pro
gram, which held an alcohol
free screening of the horror
film "The Conjuring" earlier
in the evening, also helped to
reduce potential drinking is

sues.
Ideas for increasing at
tendance while also providing
a safe experience for next
year are already forming.
For instance, Knapp suggest
ed cooperating with other
University organizations to
add food to the event.
Future partiers may be
able to have the best of all
worlds by watching the foot
ball game while at the event
and then transitioning into
the party scene. Dalder and
Knapp acknowledged that
funding for these types of ad
justments would be a poten
tial concern.
"We get a lot of funding
for the event and it's awe
some but we have so many
ideas on where to take
Maus," Knapp said. "And I
think that these kinds of
partnerships could be really
helpful, and funding is the
way to go."

Miley Cyrus, Calvin and Hobbes, Walter
White, Spider Man and various Angry Birds all
made appearances at this year's Stanford Mau
soleum party.
The Saturday evening event was themed after
the electronic music artist deadmaus. Despite
overlapping with the Stanford football game
against Oregon State University, the event saw
high attendance.
The most prominent feature of this year's
party was the music, mixed by student DJs Dar
tis Willis 'l5 and Ricky Tran 'l5. The Junior Class
cabinet, which hosted the event, voted to feature
the DJs side by side, rather than choosing one
over the other.
"I was just so impressed by them," said
Daniel Knapp 'l5, junior class co-president. "I
think they both went well with the theme, just in
totally different ways."
In keeping with the rave theme, glow sticks
were distributed to the first 800 arrivals. The
photo booth was a consistent crowd pleaser, with
a steady line of more than 20 students at any giv
en time. The event organizers spent a large
amount of time and effort into setting up the
lighting system that led from the main road to
the event, designed to recall raves associated

Despite the coinciding Stanford vs. Oregon State football game, this year's attendance at the rave-themed Mausoleum party was
still high with students decking out in crazy costumes and dancing to the beats of DJs Dartis Willis '15 and Ricky Tran '15.

According to Jacob
Dalder 'l5, chair of the Mau
soleum event, equipment
known as Gobo rotators were
used in conjunction with col
ored gels to create a unique
light pattern projected into
the trees.
A large factor in planning
each year's event is the need
to find economical yet effec
tive thematic touches to stay
within the budget, which
Knapp said the coordinators
were able to achieve this
year.
"I think funding is always
a challenge," Knapp said.
"Pricing goes up and budgets
might not, so we have to
think creatively, which Jacob
by leading the team definite
ly did."
The party hit its stride af

ter Stanford wrapped up its
20-12 victory against Oregon
State. A Facebook post at 11
p.m. encouraged those who
had just finished watching
the game to celebrate at the
Mausoleum, and the atten
dance grew.
The event organizers
were aware of the potential
for students putting them
selves in danger due to exces
sive alcohol consumption. A
key part of this safety en
forcement occurred at the
entrance to the party, with
staffers manning the en
trance looking for warning
signs. Dalder noted that if a
student was deemed ineligi
ble to enter the party, the or
ganizers would guarantee the
student a safe way to get
home and have medics help
him or her if necessary.
The Cardinal Nights pro
gram, which held an alcohol
free screening of the horror
film "The Conjuring" earlier
in the evening, also helped to
reduce potential drinking is

sues.
Ideas for increasing at
tendance while also providing
a safe experience for next
year are already forming.
For instance, Knapp suggest
ed cooperating with other
University organizations to
add food to the event.
Future partiers may be
able to have the best of all
worlds by watching the foot
ball game while at the event
and then transitioning into
the party scene. Dalder and
Knapp acknowledged that
funding for these types of ad
justments would be a poten
tial concern.
"We get a lot of funding
for the event and it's awe
some but we have so many
ideas on where to take
Maus," Knapp said. "And I
think that these kinds of
partnerships could be really
helpful, and funding is the
way to go."
