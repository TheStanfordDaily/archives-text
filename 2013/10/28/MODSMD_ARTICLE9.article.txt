# STUDENT LIFE
## Mausoleum sees high attendance 
### SKYLAR COHEN 
Miley Cyrus, Calvin and Hobbes, Walter
White, Spider Man and various Angry Birds all
made appearances at this year's Stanford Mau
soleum party.
The Saturday evening event was themed after
the electronic music artist deadmaus. Despite
overlapping with the Stanford football game
against Oregon State University, the event saw
high attendance.
The most prominent feature of this year's
party was the music, mixed by student DJs Dar
tis Willis 'l5 and Ricky Tran 'l5. The Junior Class
cabinet, which hosted the event, voted to feature
the DJs side by side, rather than choosing one
over the other.
"I was just so impressed by them," said
Daniel Knapp 'l5, junior class co-president. "I
think they both went well with the theme, just in
totally different ways."
In keeping with the rave theme, glow sticks
were distributed to the first 800 arrivals. The
photo booth was a consistent crowd pleaser, with
a steady line of more than 20 students at any giv
en time. The event organizers spent a large
amount of time and effort into setting up the
lighting system that led from the main road to
the event, designed to recall raves associated

Despite the coinciding Stanford vs. Oregon State football game, this year's attendance at the rave-themed Mausoleum party was
still high with students decking out in crazy costumes and dancing to the beats of DJs Dartis Willis '15 and Ricky Tran '15.
