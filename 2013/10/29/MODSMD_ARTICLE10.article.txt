## Learning by living with athletes 
### Ashley Westhem 
One question that I al
ways get when giv
ing a tour to prospec
tive undergraduates
is what my favorite
part about Stanford is. The answer for
me is easy: the people.
We go to school with science, busi
ness, tech and musical geniuses and
we are taught by Nobel Prize win
ners. Most important—to me at least
—is that we go to school and are
friends with world-class athletes.
I live with countless athletes from
a wide variety of sports including
crew, swimming & diving, volleyball,
soccer, sailing and track. Hearing
their stories and personal recaps of
the most recent event or game is re
ally special. I get to be a part of the
team secondhand and hear about the
dynamics and highs and lows of be
ing a student-athlete in away that
can't be experienced just from watch
ing a game.
As a huge Stanford sports fan, it's
really fun for me to always have
women around me who love to talk
about their sport and share their sto
ry— and trust me they are all more
than willing to talk when given the
slightest nudge.
At lunch yesterday I heard about
the soccer team's trip to Oregon and
Oregon State (the Stanford women
beat both) from senior Kendall
Romine. She told me how the team
was bummed that they were stuck in
the same hotel as the UCLA football
team in Eugene while Stanford was
playing in Corvatlis —wanting noth
ing more than to be in two places at
once. And then came the story of a
flight scheduling snafu that forced the
team to find a last-minute flight for 30
people and made the group not get in
until 1:30 a.m. the following morning.
Later I walked into senior Tally
Buckstaff's room to hear about how
sailing went the previous weekend.
