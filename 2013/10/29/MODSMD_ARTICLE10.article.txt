## Learning by living with athletes 
### Ashley Westhem 
One question that I al
ways get when giv
ing a tour to prospec
tive undergraduates
is what my favorite
part about Stanford is. The answer for
me is easy: the people.
We go to school with science, busi
ness, tech and musical geniuses and
we are taught by Nobel Prize win
ners. Most important—to me at least
—is that we go to school and are
friends with world-class athletes.
I live with countless athletes from
a wide variety of sports including
crew, swimming & diving, volleyball,
soccer, sailing and track. Hearing
their stories and personal recaps of
the most recent event or game is re
ally special. I get to be a part of the
team secondhand and hear about the
dynamics and highs and lows of be
ing a student-athlete in away that
can't be experienced just from watch
ing a game.
As a huge Stanford sports fan, it's
really fun for me to always have
women around me who love to talk
about their sport and share their sto
ry— and trust me they are all more
than willing to talk when given the
slightest nudge.
At lunch yesterday I heard about
the soccer team's trip to Oregon and
Oregon State (the Stanford women
beat both) from senior Kendall
Romine. She told me how the team
was bummed that they were stuck in
the same hotel as the UCLA football
team in Eugene while Stanford was
playing in Corvatlis —wanting noth
ing more than to be in two places at
once. And then came the story of a
flight scheduling snafu that forced the
team to find a last-minute flight for 30
people and made the group not get in
until 1:30 a.m. the following morning.
Later I walked into senior Tally
Buckstaff's room to hear about how
sailing went the previous weekend.
The first thing I noticed was
the open suitcase on the floor
with clothes spilling out. She
shrugged and mentioned how
she has to travel so much for
sailing—almost every week
end —that she doesn't bother
unpacking. We talked about

the grueling race days on the
water for 10-12 hours at a time,
competing on Saturdays and
Sundays (not just an afternoon
or evening ordeal on the court
or field as in other sports she
pointed out).
While I was working on
this column, sophomore Emily
Grundman walked past, hav
ing just gotten back from
weights with the crew team. I
followed her to her room and
even though she was slightly

stressed and probably wanted
nothing more than to take a
shower, she got a burst of ex
citement when I asked her to
talk about the Head of the
American that took place on
Saturday. She guided me
through the whole day from
the sleepy 5:45 a.m. bus ride
there, to the energized and ac
complished, music-filled ride
home.
Crew doesn't get a lot of at
tention since it isn't a spectator
sport and there aren't big mo
ments of excitement like in
scoring a basket or a touch
down; it's an endurance sport
and the entirety of the race is
the big built-up moment. Fhr
thermore, not one individual
can make a difference; every
one in the boat is equally de
pendent on another. After cov
ering the men's trip to the
Head of Charles and hearing
Emily talk about the day, I
have a new found appreciation
for rowing.
Emily explained that crew
is a really small community, so
you're racing against friends.
There's a lot of prep that goes
into a regatta, like having to rig
the boats when you get to a lo
cation, but there's also time to
get work done or mentally pre
pare for your race as you wait
to cheer on one of the other
boats in its home stretch. Or, in
Emily's case, she had no wait
time and went straight from
rowing in the eights race to the
fours, back to back.
In taking time to talk to
Emily about her time with
crew I learned that she was ac
tually supposed to play basket
ball at University of Chicago,
before being offered the option
of crew at Stanford. There are
probably really cool stories like
this that many Stanford ath
letes have to share and all we
have to do is ask.

Ashley Westhem was com
mitted to play Super Smash
Bros, at Blue Mountain
State University before The
Stanford Daily swooped with
an offer she couldn't refuse.
Ask Ashley what her favorite
character was at awest

Emily about her time with
crew I learned that she was ac
tually supposed to play basket
ball at University of Chicago,
before being offered the option
of crew at Stanford. There are
probably really cool stories like
this that many Stanford ath
letes have to share and all we
have to do is ask.

Ashley Westhem was com
mitted to play Super Smash
Bros, at Blue Mountain
State University before The
Stanford Daily swooped with
an offer she couldn't refuse.
Ask Ashley what her favorite

One question that I al
ways get when giv
ing a tour to prospec
tive undergraduates
is what my favorite
part about Stanford is. The answer for
me is easy: the people.
We go to school with science, busi
ness, tech and musical geniuses and
we are taught by Nobel Prize win
ners. Most important—to me at least
—is that we go to school and are
friends with world-class athletes.
I live with countless athletes from
a wide variety of sports including
crew, swimming & diving, volleyball,
soccer, sailing and track. Hearing
their stories and personal recaps of
the most recent event or game is re
ally special. I get to be a part of the
team secondhand and hear about the
dynamics and highs and lows of be
ing a student-athlete in away that
can't be experienced just from watch
ing a game.
As a huge Stanford sports fan, it's
really fun for me to always have
women around me who love to talk
about their sport and share their sto
ry— and trust me they are all more
than willing to talk when given the
slightest nudge.
At lunch yesterday I heard about
the soccer team's trip to Oregon and
Oregon State (the Stanford women
beat both) from senior Kendall
Romine. She told me how the team
was bummed that they were stuck in
the same hotel as the UCLA football
team in Eugene while Stanford was
playing in Corvatlis —wanting noth
ing more than to be in two places at
once. And then came the story of a
flight scheduling snafu that forced the
team to find a last-minute flight for 30
people and made the group not get in
until 1:30 a.m. the following morning.
Later I walked into senior Tally
Buckstaff's room to hear about how
sailing went the previous weekend.
The first thing I noticed was
the open suitcase on the floor
with clothes spilling out. She
shrugged and mentioned how
she has to travel so much for
sailing—almost every week
end —that she doesn't bother
unpacking. We talked about

the grueling race days on the
water for 10-12 hours at a time,
competing on Saturdays and
Sundays (not just an afternoon
or evening ordeal on the court
or field as in other sports she
pointed out).
While I was working on
this column, sophomore Emily
Grundman walked past, hav
ing just gotten back from
weights with the crew team. I
followed her to her room and
even though she was slightly

stressed and probably wanted
nothing more than to take a
shower, she got a burst of ex
citement when I asked her to
talk about the Head of the
American that took place on
Saturday. She guided me
through the whole day from
the sleepy 5:45 a.m. bus ride
there, to the energized and ac
complished, music-filled ride
home.
Crew doesn't get a lot of at
tention since it isn't a spectator
sport and there aren't big mo
ments of excitement like in
scoring a basket or a touch
down; it's an endurance sport
and the entirety of the race is
the big built-up moment. Fhr
thermore, not one individual
can make a difference; every
one in the boat is equally de
pendent on another. After cov
ering the men's trip to the
Head of Charles and hearing
Emily talk about the day, I
have a new found appreciation
for rowing.
Emily explained that crew
is a really small community, so
you're racing against friends.
There's a lot of prep that goes
into a regatta, like having to rig
the boats when you get to a lo
cation, but there's also time to
get work done or mentally pre
pare for your race as you wait
to cheer on one of the other
boats in its home stretch. Or, in
Emily's case, she had no wait
time and went straight from
rowing in the eights race to the
fours, back to back.
In taking time to talk to
Emily about her time with
crew I learned that she was ac
tually supposed to play basket
ball at University of Chicago,
before being offered the option
of crew at Stanford. There are
