# INSTANT REPLAY: SMART BLITZING
## HOW CARD USED SACKS TO STOP OSU 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last Saturday night in Corvallis, Oregon
State fielded the nation's finest pitch-and-catch
duo, the explosive combination of junior quar
terback Sean Mannion and junior receiver
Brandin Cooks. The Cardinal promptly held the
Beavers passing attack to a decidedly anemic
3.25 yards per play (counting sacks).
The Cardinal defense triumphed because
Stanford absolutely annihilated Oregon State's
offensive line, recording eight sacks and five
other tackles for loss in an extravaganza of
Beaver pain and destruction. Mannion gained a
lot of respect in Stanford fans' eyes for his
tough performance, but unfortunately for the
Beavers, points are gained for scoring and not
for style.
Early in the game, Stanford used all sorts of
blitzes to crush the Beaver offensive line, and in
this play the Cardinal creatively brought the
house.
A long fumble return had given Oregon
State great field position, and the Cardinal
needed to generate a stop. Backed up at its own
17-yard line and with little to lose, the Cardinal
was able to play pure man coverage and blitz its
last safety. After Oregon State sent its tight end
(Y) into a pass pattern against fifth-year senior
linebacker Shayne Skov (M), Stanford had sev
en blitzers against the Beavers' six remaining
blockers. (The diagram omits the remaining
players for clarity.)
Before the snap, Stanford allowed its play
ers to move around, disguising its defensive
strategy. As Mannion went into his snap count,
senior free safety Ed Reynolds (F/S) posi
tioned himself at the line of scrimmage. Ideal
ly, Oregon State would have used its big senior
left tackle Michael Philipp to block Stanford's
fifth-year senior linebacker Trent Murphy (B)
and shifted junior running back Terron Ward
(R) to block Reynolds, but Reynolds' sudden
move to the line forced Philipp to make a snap
decision and cover Reynolds instead. The
numbers were still two-on-two, which nomi
nally favored the Beavers, but the 5-foot-7,
202-pound Ward was not going to hold up the
6-foot-6, 261-pound Murphy for long. (See the
blue circle.) Mannion would not get blindsided
immediately, but he would not have all day ei
ther.
"Not all day" was still likely too much time

against the Beavers' dangerous receivers, and
Stanford had to get a blitzer free with a full
head of steam before Mannion found an open
man. If Oregon State could direct Stanford's
free blitzer to the outside where he would have
a long path to the quarterback, Mannion would
have time to throw. However, the blitz Stanford
called actually opened up an interior gap in the
Beaver line for the crashing safety Jordan
Richards ($).
The Cardinal was lined up in the "Bear" de
fensive front (a front being an alignment of the
defensive line), which placed three defensive
players directly opposite Oregon State's three
interior offensive linemen. By forcing one-on
ones against interior linemen and especially the
center, typically not a pass protection specialist,
the Bear generated enormous pressure against
the quarterback.
Most importantly, by placing its biggest de
fensive player, senior defensive tackle David
Parry, to the left of the right guard, Stanford
ensured that said guard would have to turn his
hips and commit to blocking left, leaving him
unable to help to his right. Stanford also aligned
senior linebacker Joe Hemschoot (S) in a pure
pass-rushing "Wide Nine" technique, forcing
Oregon State's right tackle to take several steps

right to block him. The result was a hole be
tween the guard and tackle that you could quite
literally drive a car through, which left junior
Jordan Richards ($) free to take target practice
at Mannion.
Stanford got two schematic successes on this
play, although it was actually fifth-year senior
defensive end Ben Gardner (E) who superbly
beat the slide protection to sack the quarter
back. Mannion was hit in less than two seconds.
When Gardner sacked the beleaguered Man
nion, Richards was right there with him, and
Murphy not far behind. Defensive penetration
had the relatively immobile Mannion under con
stant pressure, and it's to Mannion's credit that
he managed to finish the game.
The Bear has its vulnerabilities, and very
few coaches will use it as their base defense, al
though New York Jets coach Rex Ryan is fa
mous for creatively blitzing from this front. But
the Bear front is effective against certain forms
of the run game as well, and this latter advan
tage is what makes it such a critical element of
Stanford's game plan against the Oregon Ducks
rushing attack the subject of this column's
upcoming bye-week edition.

The Bear has its vulnerabilities, and very
few coaches will use it as their base defense, al
though New York Jets coach Rex Ryan is fa

the Bear front is effective against certain forms
of the run game as well, and this latter advan

Last Saturday night in Corvallis, Oregon
State fielded the nation's finest pitch-and-catch
duo, the explosive combination of junior quar
terback Sean Mannion and junior receiver
Brandin Cooks. The Cardinal promptly held the
Beavers passing attack to a decidedly anemic
3.25 yards per play (counting sacks).
The Cardinal defense triumphed because
Stanford absolutely annihilated Oregon State's
offensive line, recording eight sacks and five
other tackles for loss in an extravaganza of
Beaver pain and destruction. Mannion gained a
lot of respect in Stanford fans' eyes for his
tough performance, but unfortunately for the
Beavers, points are gained for scoring and not
for style.
Early in the game, Stanford used all sorts of
blitzes to crush the Beaver offensive line, and in
this play the Cardinal creatively brought the
house.
A long fumble return had given Oregon
State great field position, and the Cardinal
needed to generate a stop. Backed up at its own
17-yard line and with little to lose, the Cardinal
was able to play pure man coverage and blitz its
last safety. After Oregon State sent its tight end
(Y) into a pass pattern against fifth-year senior
linebacker Shayne Skov (M), Stanford had sev
en blitzers against the Beavers' six remaining
blockers. (The diagram omits the remaining
players for clarity.)
Before the snap, Stanford allowed its play
ers to move around, disguising its defensive
strategy. As Mannion went into his snap count,
senior free safety Ed Reynolds (F/S) posi
tioned himself at the line of scrimmage. Ideal
ly, Oregon State would have used its big senior
left tackle Michael Philipp to block Stanford's
fifth-year senior linebacker Trent Murphy (B)
and shifted junior running back Terron Ward
(R) to block Reynolds, but Reynolds' sudden
move to the line forced Philipp to make a snap
decision and cover Reynolds instead. The
numbers were still two-on-two, which nomi
nally favored the Beavers, but the 5-foot-7,
202-pound Ward was not going to hold up the
6-foot-6, 261-pound Murphy for long. (See the
blue circle.) Mannion would not get blindsided
immediately, but he would not have all day ei
ther.
"Not all day" was still likely too much time

against the Beavers' dangerous receivers, and
Stanford had to get a blitzer free with a full
head of steam before Mannion found an open
man. If Oregon State could direct Stanford's
free blitzer to the outside where he would have
a long path to the quarterback, Mannion would
have time to throw. However, the blitz Stanford
called actually opened up an interior gap in the
Beaver line for the crashing safety Jordan
Richards ($).
The Cardinal was lined up in the "Bear" de
fensive front (a front being an alignment of the
defensive line), which placed three defensive
players directly opposite Oregon State's three
interior offensive linemen. By forcing one-on
ones against interior linemen and especially the
center, typically not a pass protection specialist,
the Bear generated enormous pressure against
the quarterback.
Most importantly, by placing its biggest de
fensive player, senior defensive tackle David
Parry, to the left of the right guard, Stanford
ensured that said guard would have to turn his
hips and commit to blocking left, leaving him
unable to help to his right. Stanford also aligned
senior linebacker Joe Hemschoot (S) in a pure
pass-rushing "Wide Nine" technique, forcing
Oregon State's right tackle to take several steps

right to block him. The result was a hole be
tween the guard and tackle that you could quite
literally drive a car through, which left junior
Jordan Richards ($) free to take target practice
at Mannion.
Stanford got two schematic successes on this
play, although it was actually fifth-year senior
defensive end Ben Gardner (E) who superbly
beat the slide protection to sack the quarter
back. Mannion was hit in less than two seconds.
When Gardner sacked the beleaguered Man
nion, Richards was right there with him, and
Murphy not far behind. Defensive penetration
had the relatively immobile Mannion under con
stant pressure, and it's to Mannion's credit that
he managed to finish the game.
