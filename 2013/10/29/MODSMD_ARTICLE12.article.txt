# STANFORD IN THE NFL
## CATCHING UP WITH SAFETY JOHN LYNCH 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Before his senior year on the Farm, John
Lynch '93 had a decision to make.
With a minor league baseball contract with
the Florida Marlins in hand, it seemed that
professional baseball was his inevitable fu
ture, especially given the fact that, on the
gridiron, he was benched midway through his
junior year 1 after transitioning from quarter
back to safety.
However, a meeting with legendary coach
Bill Walsh, who had just taken over the Stan
ford program, changed everything.
"IH never forget the day Coach Walsh
called me into his office," Lynch said. "Bill
saw something in me.... He called me in that
day and said, 'Look, I understand you got a
great opportunity with the Marlins, but I
think you can play in the NFL and not only
can you play, but you can be a Pro Bowl play
er [at safety].... He sold me on coming back,
and I did and the rest is history."
Walsh's prophetic words came true as
Lynch went on to be drafted in the third
round out of college, won Super Bowl
XXXVII with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
made nine Pro Bowls, and tallied 1,058 tackles
in his 15 seasons with Tampa and Denver.
Widely revered for his intimidating presence
and jarring hits, Lynch was named the 10th
most feared tackier of all time by the NFL

Network, and in 2011 he was inducted into the
Stanford Athletics Hall of Fame.
Although he is now busy spending time
with his four children and broadcasting NFL
games for Fox, Lynch maintains close ties
with the Stanford football program and, in
particular, his friend and former teammate
David Shaw '94.
"At one point, I was a quarterback at Stan
ford throwing passes to David Shaw," Lynch
said. "His dad, [former Stanford defensive co
ordinator Willie Shaw], coached me. I was
thrilled when David got the job.
"David was really quiet at Stanford when
he was a player, so you wondered would he be
able to go out and recruit and sell the pro
gram because you have to have this dynamic
personality, and he's really grown into that,"
Lynch continued. "He's exceeded a lot of peo
ple's expectations, including mine. We're real
ly fortunate to have him."
Lynch also noted that he has really en
joyed watching the resurgence of Stanford
football in recent years, with the team playing
a similar type of power football that was
prevalent on the Cardinal squads he played
on in the early '9os. He added that the similar
ity of Stanford's style to many SEC teams, as
well as the growing number of Stanford play
ers in the NFL, has rapidly changed the per
ception of the Cardinal in the media.
