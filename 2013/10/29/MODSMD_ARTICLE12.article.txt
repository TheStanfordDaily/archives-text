# STANFORD IN THE NFL
## CATCHING UP WITH SAFETY JOHN LYNCH 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Before his senior year on the Farm, John
Lynch '93 had a decision to make.
With a minor league baseball contract with
the Florida Marlins in hand, it seemed that
professional baseball was his inevitable fu
ture, especially given the fact that, on the
gridiron, he was benched midway through his
junior year 1 after transitioning from quarter
back to safety.
However, a meeting with legendary coach
Bill Walsh, who had just taken over the Stan
ford program, changed everything.
"IH never forget the day Coach Walsh
called me into his office," Lynch said. "Bill
saw something in me.... He called me in that
day and said, 'Look, I understand you got a
great opportunity with the Marlins, but I
think you can play in the NFL and not only
can you play, but you can be a Pro Bowl play
er [at safety].... He sold me on coming back,
and I did and the rest is history."
Walsh's prophetic words came true as
Lynch went on to be drafted in the third
round out of college, won Super Bowl
XXXVII with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
made nine Pro Bowls, and tallied 1,058 tackles
in his 15 seasons with Tampa and Denver.
Widely revered for his intimidating presence
and jarring hits, Lynch was named the 10th
most feared tackier of all time by the NFL

Network, and in 2011 he was inducted into the
Stanford Athletics Hall of Fame.
Although he is now busy spending time
with his four children and broadcasting NFL
games for Fox, Lynch maintains close ties
with the Stanford football program and, in
particular, his friend and former teammate
David Shaw '94.
"At one point, I was a quarterback at Stan
ford throwing passes to David Shaw," Lynch
said. "His dad, [former Stanford defensive co
ordinator Willie Shaw], coached me. I was
thrilled when David got the job.
"David was really quiet at Stanford when
he was a player, so you wondered would he be
able to go out and recruit and sell the pro
gram because you have to have this dynamic
personality, and he's really grown into that,"
Lynch continued. "He's exceeded a lot of peo
ple's expectations, including mine. We're real
ly fortunate to have him."
Lynch also noted that he has really en
joyed watching the resurgence of Stanford
football in recent years, with the team playing
a similar type of power football that was
prevalent on the Cardinal squads he played
on in the early '9os. He added that the similar
ity of Stanford's style to many SEC teams, as
well as the growing number of Stanford play
ers in the NFL, has rapidly changed the per
ception of the Cardinal in the media.

the Denver Broncos and is still an active supporter of the Stanford football program.
"I know that when I went
to Tampa they didn't really
think we could play football
out on the West Coast,"
Lynch said. "Now, I think
Stanford is starting to get
their due. They are playing
tough, old-school football...
and I think there is a respect
that wasn't there before."
Furthermore, Lynch be
lieves that Stanford should be
a perennial powerhouse for
years to come due to the solid
foundation Shaw has built.
Lynch also played a large
part in contributing to the
program's growth by making
a significant donation toward
the creation of the team's
new locker room. Lynch's
family is recognized on a
plaque in the locker room in
honor of the people who do
nated at least $lOO,OOO to the

renovation.
"I'm so proud of the Uni
versity and I've been looking
for away to do something
meaningful and lasting
there," Lynch said. "David
didn't have to sell it, but he
just told me what it was all
about and why he felt that it
was critical to the program,
so it was a no-brainer. I've
been so fortunate and I
wanted to give back, and I
can't wait to see it."
Due to his commitments
broadcasting NFL games
every Sunday, Lynch has not
had the opportunity to at
tend many Stanford home
games in recent years; how
ever, he will be in attendance
for Stanford's clash with
Oregon on Thursday, Nov. 7,
and is looking forward to
seeing his friend and fellow
former Bronco John Elway
'B3 have his jersey retired.
In anticipation of the
game, Lynch offered his own
solution for stopping the
Ducks' juggernaut offense. A

game plan that's just what
you would expect from the
All-Pro strong safety.
"I'd play some of that old
school football," Lynch re
sponded. "They're pretty
fast to me... but, when you
hit them hard, it slows them
down a little bit. You've got to
take the fight to them and
not be intimidated."

Sunday's contest in
Phoenix between the Cardi
nals and the Falcons saw sea
son-high performances for
two Stanford graduates and
current NFL rookies: Ari
zona running back Stepfan
Taylor 'l3 and Atlanta tight
end Levine Toilolo 'l3. Taylor
finished with 38 yards rush
ing on 14 carries while Toilolo
notched three receptions in
the Cardinals' 27-13 victory.
John Lynch was the analyst
for the Fox telecast on that
game.

tend many Stanford home
games in recent years; how
ever, he will be in attendance
for Stanford's clash with
Oregon on Thursday, Nov. 7,
and is looking forward to
seeing his friend and fellow
former Bronco John Elway
'B3 have his jersey retired.
In anticipation of the
game, Lynch offered his own
solution for stopping the
Ducks' juggernaut offense. A

game plan that's just what
you would expect from the
All-Pro strong safety.
"I'd play some of that old
school football," Lynch re
sponded. "They're pretty
fast to me... but, when you
hit them hard, it slows them
down a little bit. You've got to
take the fight to them and
not be intimidated."

Sunday's contest in
Phoenix between the Cardi
nals and the Falcons saw sea
son-high performances for
two Stanford graduates and
current NFL rookies: Ari
zona running back Stepfan
Taylor 'l3 and Atlanta tight
end Levine Toilolo 'l3. Taylor
finished with 38 yards rush
ing on 14 carries while Toilolo
notched three receptions in
the Cardinals' 27-13 victory.
John Lynch was the analyst
for the Fox telecast on that
game.

Before his senior year on the Farm, John
Lynch '93 had a decision to make.
With a minor league baseball contract with
the Florida Marlins in hand, it seemed that
professional baseball was his inevitable fu
ture, especially given the fact that, on the
gridiron, he was benched midway through his
junior year 1 after transitioning from quarter
back to safety.
However, a meeting with legendary coach
Bill Walsh, who had just taken over the Stan
ford program, changed everything.
"IH never forget the day Coach Walsh
called me into his office," Lynch said. "Bill
saw something in me.... He called me in that
day and said, 'Look, I understand you got a
great opportunity with the Marlins, but I
think you can play in the NFL and not only
can you play, but you can be a Pro Bowl play
er [at safety].... He sold me on coming back,
and I did and the rest is history."
Walsh's prophetic words came true as
Lynch went on to be drafted in the third
round out of college, won Super Bowl
XXXVII with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
made nine Pro Bowls, and tallied 1,058 tackles
in his 15 seasons with Tampa and Denver.
Widely revered for his intimidating presence
and jarring hits, Lynch was named the 10th
most feared tackier of all time by the NFL

Network, and in 2011 he was inducted into the
Stanford Athletics Hall of Fame.
Although he is now busy spending time
with his four children and broadcasting NFL
games for Fox, Lynch maintains close ties
with the Stanford football program and, in
particular, his friend and former teammate
David Shaw '94.
"At one point, I was a quarterback at Stan
ford throwing passes to David Shaw," Lynch
said. "His dad, [former Stanford defensive co
ordinator Willie Shaw], coached me. I was
thrilled when David got the job.
"David was really quiet at Stanford when
he was a player, so you wondered would he be
able to go out and recruit and sell the pro
gram because you have to have this dynamic
personality, and he's really grown into that,"
Lynch continued. "He's exceeded a lot of peo
ple's expectations, including mine. We're real
ly fortunate to have him."
Lynch also noted that he has really en
joyed watching the resurgence of Stanford
football in recent years, with the team playing
a similar type of power football that was
prevalent on the Cardinal squads he played
on in the early '9os. He added that the similar
ity of Stanford's style to many SEC teams, as
well as the growing number of Stanford play
ers in the NFL, has rapidly changed the per
ception of the Cardinal in the media.

John Lynch '93 (middle) enjoyed a successful career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and
the Denver Broncos and is still an active supporter of the Stanford football program.
"I know that when I went
to Tampa they didn't really
think we could play football
out on the West Coast,"
Lynch said. "Now, I think
Stanford is starting to get
their due. They are playing
tough, old-school football...
and I think there is a respect
that wasn't there before."
Furthermore, Lynch be
lieves that Stanford should be
a perennial powerhouse for
years to come due to the solid
foundation Shaw has built.
Lynch also played a large
part in contributing to the
program's growth by making
a significant donation toward
the creation of the team's
new locker room. Lynch's
family is recognized on a
plaque in the locker room in
honor of the people who do
nated at least $lOO,OOO to the

renovation.
"I'm so proud of the Uni
versity and I've been looking
for away to do something
meaningful and lasting
there," Lynch said. "David
didn't have to sell it, but he
just told me what it was all
about and why he felt that it
was critical to the program,
so it was a no-brainer. I've
been so fortunate and I
wanted to give back, and I
can't wait to see it."
