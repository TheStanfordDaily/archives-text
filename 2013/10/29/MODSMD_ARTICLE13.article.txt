## SUPER TUESDAY Reform the Tax Code 
### Marshal Watkins 
As recriminations and partisan
rancor continue to dominate
the aftermath of the recent
shutdown crisis, the narrow aver
sion of catastrophe has also meant
the start of work for a group of law
makers tasked with crafting a con
sensus on the long-term fiscal future
of the United States.
It seems credible and poten
tially even likely that the budget
conference will fail to reach an
agreement that would avert another
showdown in just a few months time.
It's clear, however, where they need
to start.
Totaling nearly 4 million words,
America's tax code is both bloated
and strikingly open to manipulation.
Businesses and individuals spend
more than 6 billion hours a year com
plying with filing requirements
the equivalent of nearly 3 million full
time jobs and the amount saved
by tax breaks, such as those granted
for mortgage interest payments,
nearly matches the federal govern
ment's income tax receipts.
The tax code's flaws extend be
yond complexity and omissions too.
While the current top marginal tax
rate of 39.6 percent is far below the
94 percent rate encountered in 1944,
America has one of the most "pro
gressive" tax systems in the devel
oped world, in terms of the propor
tion of the overall tax burden exacted
from the wealthiest 10 percent. Con
versely nearly half of Americans pay
no federal income taxes whatsoever.
Some tax reform proposals have
more merit than others, of course. A
White House proposal that would
raise corporate tax rates already
the highest among Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Develop
ment nations in order to fund in
frastructure investments would in
reality affect only a relatively minor
component of overall federal rev
enues while discouraging private sec
tor growth in a lethargic economy.
Similarly, Republican proposals
to scrap income taxes altogether and
rely on higher sales taxes are both
fiscally unsustainable and perilously
punitive to the poor.
There are some common-sense
measures that the budget conference
might identify as a solid starting

point. Closing tax loopholes such as
those granted to the owners of pri
vate jets, for example, offers political
appeal and an easily quantifiable im
pact. Such measures are however
generally insufficient in scale to have
notable effects on the government's
long-term revenue outlook.
More ambitious efforts remain
subject, however, to partisan intran
sigence, and not only that exempli
fied by GOP inflexibility over any
sort of reform that would raise rev
enue totals in any way.
The concept that contributing
more value to the economy and
that the government, rather than the
income earner himself, is the natural
recipient of income gained
equates to an ability to "patriotically"
pay more of one's "fair share" has
gained inexplicable traction.
Similarly, the call for higher capi
tal gains taxes levied, essentially,
on income already subjected to taxa
tion that has subsequently been ac
tively invested in furthering econom
ic growth may have a certain polit
ical appeal but little grounding in
concepts of equitable treatment.
The difficulty of addressing tax
reform in a nonpartisan manner is
perhaps demonstrated best by the
fate of the Bowles-Simpson Deficit
Reduction Plan. The plan put for
ward at President Obama's request
would simplify the tax codes while
slashing personal and corporate
rates and eliminating loopholes, all
while producing revenue gains that
could subsequently be used for
deficit reduction.
More than any other proposal,
Bowles-Simpson offers a clear step in
the right direction that irritates both
parties just the right amount and
has subsequently gone nowhere.
There's clearly a need for both
parties to break away from partisan
preferences in exploring tax reform,
and clearly room for progress to be
made. In the end, however, even suc
cessful tax reform would pale in sig
nificance and impact compared to
successful entitlement reform
and the latter makes the former
look easy.

sensus on the long-term fiscal future
of the United States.
It seems credible and poten
tially even likely that the budget
conference will fail to reach an
agreement that would avert another
showdown in just a few months time.
It's clear, however, where they need
to start.
Totaling nearly 4 million words,
America's tax code is both bloated
and strikingly open to manipulation.
Businesses and individuals spend
more than 6 billion hours a year com
plying with filing requirements
the equivalent of nearly 3 million full
time jobs and the amount saved
by tax breaks, such as those granted
for mortgage interest payments,
nearly matches the federal govern
ment's income tax receipts.
The tax code's flaws extend be
yond complexity and omissions too.
While the current top marginal tax
rate of 39.6 percent is far below the
94 percent rate encountered in 1944,
America has one of the most "pro
gressive" tax systems in the devel
oped world, in terms of the propor
tion of the overall tax burden exacted
from the wealthiest 10 percent. Con
versely nearly half of Americans pay
no federal income taxes whatsoever.
Some tax reform proposals have
more merit than others, of course. A
White House proposal that would
raise corporate tax rates already
the highest among Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Develop
ment nations in order to fund in
frastructure investments would in
reality affect only a relatively minor
component of overall federal rev
enues while discouraging private sec
tor growth in a lethargic economy.
Similarly, Republican proposals
to scrap income taxes altogether and
rely on higher sales taxes are both
fiscally unsustainable and perilously
punitive to the poor.
There are some common-sense
measures that the budget conference
might identify as a solid starting

point. Closing tax loopholes such as
those granted to the owners of pri
vate jets, for example, offers political
appeal and an easily quantifiable im
pact. Such measures are however
generally insufficient in scale to have
notable effects on the government's
long-term revenue outlook.
More ambitious efforts remain
subject, however, to partisan intran
sigence, and not only that exempli
fied by GOP inflexibility over any
sort of reform that would raise rev
enue totals in any way.
The concept that contributing
more value to the economy and
that the government, rather than the
income earner himself, is the natural
recipient of income gained
equates to an ability to "patriotically"
pay more of one's "fair share" has
gained inexplicable traction.
Similarly, the call for higher capi
tal gains taxes levied, essentially,
on income already subjected to taxa
tion that has subsequently been ac
tively invested in furthering econom
ic growth may have a certain polit
ical appeal but little grounding in
concepts of equitable treatment.
The difficulty of addressing tax
reform in a nonpartisan manner is
perhaps demonstrated best by the
fate of the Bowles-Simpson Deficit
Reduction Plan. The plan put for
ward at President Obama's request
would simplify the tax codes while
slashing personal and corporate
rates and eliminating loopholes, all
while producing revenue gains that
could subsequently be used for
deficit reduction.
More than any other proposal,
Bowles-Simpson offers a clear step in
the right direction that irritates both
parties just the right amount and
has subsequently gone nowhere.
There's clearly a need for both
parties to break away from partisan
preferences in exploring tax reform,
and clearly room for progress to be
made. In the end, however, even suc
cessful tax reform would pale in sig
nificance and impact compared to
successful entitlement reform
and the latter makes the former
look easy.
