# SUPER TUESDAY
## Becoming Robin Hood 
### Nick Ahamed 
Just a week after our country's
third-longest shutdown ended,
most Americans are already
preparing for the next. They fear that
Congress will not reach any agree
ment on a budget by the Dec. 13 dead
line a reasonable feeling given that
rank-and-file Republicans say they
will refuse any budget with revenue
increases.
Leading that gang, Paul Ryan's of
fice stated, "We should not take more
from hard-working families to spend
more in Washington." Yet, this claim is
an overly simplistic approach to our 3.8
million-word tax code.
Tax reform is needed, badly and
with enough nuance to make it mean
ingful and passable.
Our current income tax schedule is
labeled as progressive meaning that
the tax rate increases as income in
creases. These labels typically focus on
marginal tax rates, which climb from
10 percent for household incomes of $0
to $12,750, to 39.6 percent for incomes
of $425,000 or more.
But the schedule isn't as progres
sive as this gradation may seem; mar
ginal rates tell only part of the story.
Each marginal rate applies only to
one slice of income. For example,
everyone pays only 10 percent of their
first $12,750 in taxes, regardless of
their gross income level. In the same
way, high earners only pay 39.6 per
cent on the income they make in ex
cess of $425,000.
Effective tax rates capture this
variation in marginal brackets. Look
ing at these initially reveals a similarly
though less drasticly progressive sys
tem. The lowest quintile of earners has
an effective rate of just 2 percent, com
pared to 20.1 percent for the highest
quintile, according to The New York
Times.
However, those who bring home
the most bacon the top 400 earners
actually have a lower effective rate
than the average millionaire: 19.91 per
cent compared to 24.6 percent. Warren
Buffet puts this in strikingly human
terms: "I'll probably be the lowest pay
ing taxpayer in the office."
As a philosophical proponent of a
progressive tax system, this is prob
lematic. Lucidly, we know what causes

this difference: tax loopholes.
While there are many; the primary
reason Buffet and others pay less pro
portionally is the capital gains loop
hole. That adjustment lowers the tax
rate to 20 percent for the 39.6 percent
bracket on income made from selling
stocks, bonds or real estate. More than
$0.43 of every dollar the superrich
make is from selling these invest

ments, explaining their lower effective
rate.
A first step to reforming the tax
code would address this problem by
eliminating or at least curbing
most of these loopholes. Legislators of
all stripes should have ample reason
to back such reforms.
For Democrats, this reform is an
avenue to a more egalitarian society.
For a developed nation, the United
States is sadly unequal. Following the
Palma Ratio, we rank just below
Nigeria; ranking by Gini Coefficient,
even China is ahead of us.
There is no doubt that our loophole
system, which is largely used by the
rich, contributes to this. The Center
for American Progress finds that 85

percent of change in our Gini Coeffi
cient in the last 30 years can be ex
plained by changes in the top 1 per
cent's effective tax rate.
But Republicans, who have been
championing deficit reduction lately,
must recognize the benefits as well. A
Joint Committee on Taxation report
calculated that the wealthy save $ll4
billion in taxes annually because of the
capital gains rate.
That report also found that $ll6
rbillion in yearly revenue is lost from
the home mortgage interest deduc
tion, which is not to mention the sec
ond-home mortgage interest deduc
tion that costs $8 billion a year. Elimi
nating these three loopholes, which
largely benefit the wealthiest Ameri-

cans, could reduce our 10-year deficit
by $2.4 trillion.

But in the end, Americans will be
true winners. A more equitable tax
system can help spur economic
growth. Nobel Prize-winning econo
mist Joseph Stiglitz argues that these
reforms would also build not only a
bigger economy, but also a healthier
one one focused on business rather
than finance.
More pragmatic than that, com
promising on tax reform suggests
some promise for the budget process.
It just might save us from another
shutdown.
