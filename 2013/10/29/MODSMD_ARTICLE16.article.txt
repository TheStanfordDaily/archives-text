## 
### LUKE ASPERGER 
The Stanford men's water
polo team dominated in the
pool once again on Sunday,
cruising to an 11-3 victory
against No. 9 Pepperdine.
Riding on the momentum of
last weekend's huge sweep of
UCLA and UC-Davis, the
No. 4 Cardinal (13-4, 2-1
MPSF) continued its trend of
stellar defense in its resound
ing defeat of the Waves (8-9,
0-3).
After being recognized as
MPSF/KAP 7 Player of the
Week for his tremendous 11-
save performance in Stan
ford's defeat of the No. 2 Bru
ins last Saturday, standout
freshman goalie Drew Hol
land was at it again on Sun
day, notching eight saves
against Pepperdine. For the
second consecutive game, the
Card defense shut out its op
position for the entire first
half.
Junior Alex Bowen
opened the scoring midway
through the first period on a
Stanford six-on-five, drilling a
shot past Pepperdine goalie

Bence Valics. The Cardinal
extended the lead minutes
later when freshman Jackson
Kimbell sprinted past a de
fender on a counter and re
ceived the ball with no one
left to stop him.
The Cardinal continued to
dominate in the second peri
od, with Bowen scoring his
second goal in the very first
minute. Stanford added two
more thanks to senior 2-me
ter Conner Cleary, who
opened up opportunities for
the offense by drawing three
ejections in the period.
Sophomore Bret Bonanni
cashed in on the first power
play firing the ball in from
the wing, and Kimbell scored
on another to make the score
5-0 by halftime.
The Waves fought back in
the third period, mustering
their only offense of the
game. Pepperdine's Danny
White scored twice in the
first two minutes to cut Stan
ford's lead to three. However,
the Cardinal offense respond
ed in turn with goals senior
Paul Rudolph and sophomore
B.J. Churnside. Pepperdine's

Luke Hewko got the Waves
their final goal with 56 sec
onds left in the period.
The lights-out Cardinal
defense returned in the
fourth period to shut down
the Waves for good. Stanford
lit up the scoreboard with
goals from Churnside, Bo
nanni, Rudolph and Bowen to
put the game well out of
reach for Pepperdine.
With a hat trick during
Sunday's game, Bowen
raised his goal total on the
season to 44. Bonanni, who
led the conference entering
the game with 3.75 goals per
game, increased his total to
62 on the season.
Stanford will face off
against No. 6 UC-Santa Bar
bara next Sunday at Avery
Aquatic Center in the final
game of the homestand. The
Cardinal will look to continue
shutting down the opposition
with its tight defense as it
prepares for road trips to
Southern California the fol
lowing two weekends.
