145 rushing yards for senior running back
Tyler Gaffney
The senior from San Diego continues to build on his phenomenal season by again
breaking the century mark while adding all three offensive touchdowns for the Cardi
nal. On his first touchdown run, Gaffney's tenacity and ability to gain yards after con
tact allowed the Card to go into halftime with a 7-3 lead.
51 total plays run by Stanford
After thoroughly dominating the time of possession against UCLA,
Stanford's offense was unable to string together its standard time-consuming drives
against the Beavers. In fact, the Cardinal only held the ball for 21 minutes against Ore
gon State. Stanford needs to re-establish control over possession and the pace of the
game if it hopes to beat Oregon on Nov. 7.
8 sacks by the Cardinal defense
The offensive line for Oregon State looked completely lost on Saturday, as Stanford partied
in the backfield all night long. Fifth-year senior Trent Murphy continued his stellar campaign
with 21/2 sacks on quarterback Sean Mannion, while junior outside linebacker Kevin
Anderson had a breakout game with 11/2 sacks in preserving the 20-12 victory.
45-30-1 Stanford's all-time record
against Oregon
With Oregon State dispatched, duck hunting season has officially arrived on the Farm,
as both Stanford and Oregon prepare to face off with a Pac-12 North title and BCS Na
tional Championship Game hopes on the line for both teams. The Nov. 7 matchup will,
in all likelihood, be the second game this season to feature two top-five teams.
