# SPER hosts Palestinian justice conference
## Students from across the nation join discussion on campus 
### SAM KURLAND 
This past weekend, Stanford
Students for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER) hosted nearly 300
college students from more than 70
campuses across the country to ex
press solidarity with the Palestinian
liberation movement.
The third annual conference was
organized by the Students for Jus
tice in Palestine (SJP), a national
student organization founded in
2001 at UC-Berkeley, committed to
promoting human rights for people
living in Israel and Palestine.
Throughout the weekend, atten
dees participated in political devel
opment workshops and other
events intended to support their ad
vocacy for the Palestinian liberation
movement.
"The theme that we're working
with this year is 'Prom Margin to
Center: Connecting Struggles,
Forging a National Movement,"'
said Kristian Bailey 'l4, a leading
organizer of the conference. "The
idea behind that is, for a lot of time,
the issue of Palestine has been on
the periphery of campus discus
sions about justice and liberation."
According to Bailey, SPER

the local chapter of SJP had
been planning and organizing this
conference since June, when their
bid to host the conference at Stan
ford was accepted.
"Students for Justice in Pales
tine is one of the most coordinated
student movements we have right
now," Bailey said. "This is our time
to figure out what we will be doing
once we get to that stage of having
a national movement."
SPER has 10 to 20 active mem
bers and was originally founded in
2006 under the name Students Con
fronting Apartheid in Israel.
"Our work is centered around
making sure that universal rights
are respected in Israel and Pales
tine, because currently the situa
tion is that international human
rights laws are being violated in
that region," Bailey said.
Bailey added that members of
the group include Palestinian stu
dents who have lived under occupa
tion and students whose parents
are Palestinian refugees living in
the United States, Jordan and else
where.
While planning this conference,
SPER enlisted the help of SJP
chapters from Columbia University

and the University of Michigan,
both of which had hosted the SJP
conference in the past.
The conference opened on Fri
day, Oct. 25 with a screening of the
documentary, "Where the Birds
Should Fly," which recounts the ex
periences of two young Palestinian
women during the conflict in the

Gaza Strip in 2008 and 2009. The
screening was followed by a discus
sion led by advocates from West
Coast chapters of SJP of their ef
forts in California on behalf of the
Palestinian liberation movement.
Only a select number of events
were open to the public, including a
Saturday night performance at

Dinkelspiel Auditorium celebrating
Palestinian music, dance, poetry
and spoken word; a closing plenary
featuring speakers from the Pales
tinian Youth Movement, the Inter
national Jewish Anti-Zionist Net
work and the Malcolm X Grass-
