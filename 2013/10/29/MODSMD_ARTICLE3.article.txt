## Catholic Community launches mobile app 
### LINDSAY FUNK 
The Catholic Community at
Stanford (CC@S) recently
launched a mobile app for Android
and iPhone devices that includes a
variety of resources for Catholic
life at Stanford, including mass
times, upcoming events, prayer
materials, podcasts and videos.
The Catholic communities at
Stanford and Yale University were
the first to purchase the customiz
able app from the Newman Center
Service Company after the compa
ny reached out to campus centers
across the nation.
According to M'Lis Berry,
CC@S director of development,
the CC@S staff had long been con
sidering away to make its re
sources more accessible on mobile
devices.
"Certainly at Stanford, the fact
is that there are many more times
that you are going to be sitting in a
Starbucks line where you may
start surfing around on your phone
[rather than a laptop]," Berry said.
"It was a no-brainer, because
everybody is so geared towards
[technology], particularly here,"
she added.

Elisa Figueroa 'l5 praised the
app's abundance of prayer materi
als.
"It's awesome for college stu
dents, especially here, because
we're all so busy," Figueroa said.
"Having those readings on the
phone is really helpful because you
can just walk to class and read the
gospel for the day and meditate on
that as you're walking."
More than 250 people have
downloaded the app since its soft
launch on Oct. 3. Yale University's
Catholic community saw a compa
rable number of downloads in the
same time period, according to
Berry.
There are about 1,000 regis
tered members of the Catholic
Community at Stanford, 400 to 700
of whom regularly attend one of
three prayer services on Sundays.
"[The app] could be also helpful
if maybe someone who hasn't been
to mass in a while is there and kind
of forgot some of the prayers,"
Figueroa said. "They could just
look on the phone so they don't feel
left out or embarrassed that they
don't know it."
Campus Minister Lourdes
Alonso spoke about the role that

the app can play in facilitating indi
vidual Bible studies among stu
dents. One of the community's af
filiated groups, Esteem, encour
ages students to read a specific
Bible passage prior to mass every
Sunday.
"Instead of having to find out
what that reading is, look it up in
the Bible somewhere, they could

actually pull it up [on their phone]
and they know on this day, these
are going to be the readings and
they can pray with that on their
own," Alonso said.
The launch of the mobile app
complements the other technologi
cal offerings by CC@S, including

The Catholic Community at Stanford introduced a mobile app for
Android and iPhone devices, allowing students and other
community members to keep track of mass times and read gospels.
podcasts and You Tube videos
of weekly sermons and New
man Night lectures.

The CC@S staff has been
impressed by the app's posi
tive reception among not just
students but also other com
munity members, including
faculty and local residents.
Berry also noted that the app
has been very popular with
alumni.

"It's been remarkable
how many people in their 60s
and 70s in our community
are all over this," Berry said.
"For the alumni who aren't
local, they really like to see
what events are going on on
campus and have away of re
ally plugging in quickly and

easily into the lectures and
the sermons."
"It just makes them feel
like they're part of what's go
ing on here even though
they're far away" she added.
