# STUDENT LIFE
## OAPE's Cardinal Nights expands 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK 
Cardinal Nights, an organization run by the
Office of Alcohol Policy & Education (OAPE)
that offers alcohol-free events, has developed a
growing presence on campus in its third year,
with more events offered and a new student
staff.
So far this quarter, the organization has
sponsored several student activities on and off
campus, including a Silent Disco dance and the
midnight premiere of the horror film remake
"Carrie."
"I think from last year to this year we are
trying to have more of a presence and bigger
scale events," said Ralph Castro, OAPE Di
rector. "We're trying to focus more on things
that students really want to do."
Castro said that, according to a recent sur-
vey, OAPE is seeing 33 per
cent of nondrinking students
and 65 percent of drinking
students attending Cardinal
Nights events. The pro
gram's initial focus was on
nondrinkers and light
drinkers.
"There was a lot of skepti
cism of something like this
happening but over two years
now, we've been able to push
through that and now we
have solid data that shows
that this is a very effective
program at a place like Stan
ford and it is now being repli
cated at other peer institu
tions," Castro said.
According to Castro,
Cardinal Nights is becoming
a nationally respected pro
gram at private institutions,
and Stanford has been con
ducting consultations with
peer universities that are
trying to build similar pro
grams.
"We had a hypothesis
that if we professionally
planned these events that
people would still come,"
Castro said. "There was a lot
of skepticism, but I had a lot
of confidence and said if we
build this and we do it right
and we offer premium pro
grams, students still come."
The program's most sue

cessful event since the
group debuted two years
ago was the Welcome Back
Carnival.
"Our first event, the car
nival, drew out well over
1,000 people. And that in
cluded different games,"
said Trista Shideler, assis
tant director of OAPE. "We
had a DJ, we had tons of
food, gave away T-shirts and
had a photo booth."
Over the past two years,
Cardinal Nights has put on
140 events and collaborates
with other student groups to
host events that align with
the organization's goals, ac
cording to Castro.
In its first year, Cardinal
Nights initially planned to
put on one event per week
end, but instead put on two
every weekend. Last year,
the program planned to host
two events per weekend, but
instead put on three.
"If we can provide multi
ple things on a weekend,
then we are able to provide
alternatives because when
you have options to do
things then students are
more likely to engage," Cas
tro said.
According to Shideler,
Cardinal Nights hired a
group of students to assist
with event planning this
year, which she said has been
an effective strategy.
"I hired a small group of
student staff and that's real
ly going to add to what we

are providing for the campus
because then I'm having
people in the community
who can mention ideas from
their peers and generate
ideas as a group," Shideler
said.
Maddie Hawkinson 'l7 is
a member of the student
team and said she has en
joyed Cardinal Nights pro
gramming so far.
"One of my favorite
memories to this day was
cramming too many people
onto a small blanket and
curling up with a huge group
of my new friends," said
Hawkinson, of a Screen on
the Green event.
Melissa Gordon 'l5 at
tended her first Cardinal
Nights event, the Build-A-
Bear Workshop activity, this
year. The Build-A-Bear
event sold out its 500 teddy
bears in just a matter of a
few days, according to
Shideler.
"What I liked about the
event is that I was able to go
with a group of friends,"
Gordon said. "We all bonded
over making stuffed ani
mals."
Events being planned for
this year include gelato tast
ings, a trip to Sky High and
an opportunity to see
"Priscilla Queen of the
Desert" on Broadway in San
Jose this Friday.

"I think from last year to this year we are
trying to have more of a presence and bigger
scale events," said Ralph Castro, OAPE Di
rector. "We're trying to focus more on things
that students really want to do."
Castro said that, according to a recent sur-
vey, OAPE is seeing 33 per
cent of nondrinking students
and 65 percent of drinking
students attending Cardinal
Nights events. The pro
gram's initial focus was on
nondrinkers and light
drinkers.
"There was a lot of skepti
cism of something like this
happening but over two years
now, we've been able to push
through that and now we
have solid data that shows
that this is a very effective
program at a place like Stan
ford and it is now being repli
cated at other peer institu
tions," Castro said.
According to Castro,
Cardinal Nights is becoming
a nationally respected pro
gram at private institutions,
and Stanford has been con
ducting consultations with
peer universities that are
trying to build similar pro
grams.
"We had a hypothesis
that if we professionally
planned these events that
people would still come,"
Castro said. "There was a lot
of skepticism, but I had a lot
of confidence and said if we
build this and we do it right
and we offer premium pro
grams, students still come."
The program's most sue

cessful event since the
group debuted two years
ago was the Welcome Back
Carnival.
"Our first event, the car
nival, drew out well over
1,000 people. And that in
cluded different games,"
said Trista Shideler, assis
tant director of OAPE. "We
had a DJ, we had tons of
food, gave away T-shirts and
had a photo booth."
Over the past two years,
Cardinal Nights has put on
140 events and collaborates
with other student groups to
host events that align with
the organization's goals, ac
cording to Castro.
In its first year, Cardinal
Nights initially planned to
put on one event per week
end, but instead put on two
every weekend. Last year,
the program planned to host
two events per weekend, but
instead put on three.
"If we can provide multi
ple things on a weekend,
then we are able to provide
alternatives because when
you have options to do
things then students are
more likely to engage," Cas
tro said.
According to Shideler,
Cardinal Nights hired a
group of students to assist
with event planning this
year, which she said has been
an effective strategy.
"I hired a small group of
student staff and that's real
ly going to add to what we

are providing for the campus
because then I'm having
people in the community
who can mention ideas from
their peers and generate
ideas as a group," Shideler
said.
Maddie Hawkinson 'l7 is
a member of the student
team and said she has en
joyed Cardinal Nights pro
gramming so far.
"One of my favorite
memories to this day was
cramming too many people
onto a small blanket and
curling up with a huge group
of my new friends," said
Hawkinson, of a Screen on
the Green event.
Melissa Gordon 'l5 at
tended her first Cardinal
Nights event, the Build-A-
Bear Workshop activity, this
year. The Build-A-Bear
event sold out its 500 teddy
bears in just a matter of a
few days, according to
Shideler.
"What I liked about the
event is that I was able to go
with a group of friends,"
Gordon said. "We all bonded
over making stuffed ani
mals."
Events being planned for
this year include gelato tast
ings, a trip to Sky High and
an opportunity to see
"Priscilla Queen of the
Desert" on Broadway in San
Jose this Friday.

Cardinal Nights, an organization run by the
Office of Alcohol Policy & Education (OAPE)
that offers alcohol-free events, has developed a
growing presence on campus in its third year,
with more events offered and a new student
staff.
So far this quarter, the organization has
sponsored several student activities on and off
campus, including a Silent Disco dance and the
midnight premiere of the horror film remake
"Carrie."
"I think from last year to this year we are
trying to have more of a presence and bigger
scale events," said Ralph Castro, OAPE Di
