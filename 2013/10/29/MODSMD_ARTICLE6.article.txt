## TGB app numbers double Fifty students to attend the ASB Thanksgiving program 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC 
In its second year, the Thanks
giving Back (TGB) program, spon
sored by Alternative Spring Break
(ASB), received nearly twice as
many applicants as last year, filling
all trip slots and waitlists, according
to TGB Associate Director Thanh
Nguyen 'l4, M.A. 'l4.
This year more than 50 students
will participate in five service-learn
ing trips addressing topics that
range from mental health to entre
preneurship across the Bay Area
over Thanksgiving break.
In its pilot year, several TGB
trips were left unfilled. However,
one of the more popular trips this
year accepted two more students
than it had originally allotted for.
Nguyen attributes the increase in
interest to revamped advertising.
"Advertising was a lot more ag
gressive this year, targeting inter
national students and all frosh
dorms on campus," Nguyen said.
Nguyen also said the program
received more funding this year, al
lowing one additional trip and more
daily activities.
Both the ASB and TGB pro
grams focus on personal interac
tions with the communities they
serve. While TGB is shorter than
ASB, it still provides students with
an opportunity to travel exclusively
throughout the Bay Area and work
closely with various service and en
terprise organizations.
Applicants are not required to
have prior experience in a trip topic
and the program accepts students
from a variety of backgrounds and
interests. Nguyen noted, however,
that the only significant trend ap
parent in the applications was a
higher proportion of female appli
cants compared with last year.
In addition, all the trips this year
are new.
Nguyen hopes that continued
improvements to the program will
continue to attract students of vari-
ous backgrounds who want
to meaningfully spend their
Thanksgiving breaks.
"There are so many stu
dents on campus who don't
have much to do and often
waste their Thanksgivings,"
said Christina Zhou 'l4, who
led an environmental justice
trip last Thanksgiving focus
ing mostly on the East Bay.
The Haas Center receives
and reviews proposals and
itineraries on a variety of
topics from passionate stu

dents. Zhou said she had nev
er participated in a communi
ty service trip before last
year, but appreciated the op
portunity to explore a new
topic by forming her own
trip.
"Environmental justice
was new to me. I did some re
search on it for PWR," Zhou
said of her motivation to apply
as a trip leader. "I only knew
about it from a New York per
spective and wanted to learn
more about California."
Sustainability was some
thing that Zhou also thought
was lacking from ASB's fo
cus, so she wanted to bring
that element to a TGB trip.
"There are a solid set of

trips that catered to lots of
students interested in health,
in LGBT issues and cultural
issues, and not so much sus
tainability," Zhou said.
The trip component of the
program is a culmination of
academic study and reflec
tion, according to Nguyen.
TGB programs have a course
work component of short
workshops that place service
in the context of regional or
personal issues and establish
goals for the trip.

"The Haas Center is not
just public service but we re
ally push service learning, so
being very intentional and re
flective about how you do
service," Nguyen said. "We

want to give something to the
community. It should be a
partnership between the
community and the service
people."
Annie Phan 'l6, who went
on a social justice trip last
Thanksgiving, added that the
timing of the trips is particu
larly apt.
"Thanksgiving is about
giving thanks, so why would
n't you want to give back and
give service," Phan said. "It
seems like a very sincere and
genuine way to reflect on the
things you have and to foster
great relationships."
