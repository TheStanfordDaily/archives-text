# Board of Judicial Affairs bylaws explained
## 
### 
In June, the Board on Judicial Affairs
(BJA), a 15-member committee com
posed of students, faculty and adminis
trators, voted to adopt eight bylaws to the
Student Judicial Charter, aiming to clarify
the policies and procedures to be fol
lowed during Stanford's judicial process.
Student government leaders first real
ized this fall that the bylaws had been ap
proved, and have since argued the BJA
should have sought their input prior to
adoption.
The Graduate Student Council (GSC)

last Wednesday exercised its veto power
and overturned the eight bylaws, in part,
because they had no input in the creation
of the bylaws.
This week, the GSC and Undergradu
ate Senate will each vote on a bill to form
a joint committee on judicial affairs,
which would work with the BJA on creat
ing a revised set of bylaws. With the dis
cussion on bylaws still ongoing, BJA co
chair Miles Seiver 'l4 explained to The
Daily what each bylaw was intended to
accomplish.
