# Rationale for the Board of Judicial Affairs adopting each bylaw
## 
### 
Bylaw 1
To provide a clear, consistent standard for
filing charges. The charter currently states a
student can be charged if there is "sufficient
evidence." The new bylaw defined what this
phrase means: "Given the available
information, a reasonable person could find
the allegation(s) to be true."
Bylaw 3
To provide a consistent standard for evidence
considered by panels. The new bylaw
defined the four factors that panelists may
use when determining whether or not to
present evidence that is contested or
submitted after an established deadline:
reason for late submission, relevance,
credibility and prejudice.
Bylaw 5
To provide an updated and concise summary
of Honor Code interpretations. The existing
Honor Code interpretations were originally
written in 1977 and previously updated in
2004.
Bylaw 7
To provide a clear, consistent process for
handling cases in which more than one
student is named and charged.
Bylaw 8
To provide a consistent standard for the
factors that judicial panels take into account
when sanctioning. The bylaw was intended to
replace a 2003 document titled "Guidelines
for Final Appeals," which provided informal
guidance for determined sanctions.

Bylaw 2
To provide a clear, consistent process for
objecting to decisions made during hearings.
In a case study of a 2011 judicial proceeding
published by The Daily last May, a responding
student reported that he had no mechanism
for interrupting a judicial hearing when he
thought unfair evidence was being introduced
against him.
Bylaw 4
To recognize that information related to a
judicial matter may, on occasion, need to be
shared in away not currently allowed. The
charter currently requires a stricter level of
confidentiality than Family the Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a federal
law that protects the privacy of student's
educational records. The new bylaw modified
the charter's confidentiality clause to bring it
in accordance with FERPA.
Bylaw 6
To provide a clear, consistent standard for
the use of character evidence. The new
bylaw stated that character or reputation
evidence is not relevant during the
fact-finding portion of the hearing, in
accordance with the Alternative Review
Process (ARP), a revised judicial procedure
approved last year for cases involving sexual
assault, relationship violence, sexual
harassment and stalking.
