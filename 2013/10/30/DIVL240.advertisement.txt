KISS WANTED
I made a mistake at Full Moon. I deliberately
broke off a perfect kiss because I thought it
was too perfect. I didn't want to ruin it by ex
changing names. Now I see I was wrong. So if
you are a tall boy with a broad face, and I
think dark blonde hair - and if you kissed me
in the most tender way I've ever been kissed,
off the far right edge of the crowd, before the
music speakers and after the rainbow flag
area - then please text 409 422 6718.1 can't
spend this quarter looking for you around
every archway, but I'd like to kiss you again.
You really do have lovely lips. I am 57", have
green eyes and long brown hair. The sweater I
was wearing was black.
