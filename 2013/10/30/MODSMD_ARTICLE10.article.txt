# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE: HAS THE OFFENSE IMPROVED?
## COMPARING STANFORD OFFENSES A YEAR APART 
### THE DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Coming into the 2013 season, most people
figured that with Kevin Hogan's in
creased experience and the emergence of
young wide receivers, Stanford's offense
was going to improve dramatically. After

showing signs of improvement early in
the season, the Cardinal offense has sput
tered over its past few games. We asked
football writers Do-Hyoung Park, David
Cohn and Winston Shi: Is Stanford's of
fense better now than it was going into the
Oregon game last season?
Do: At the beginning of the season, I would
have said a wholehearted yes. The exhilaration
of finally seeing Stanford develop a consistent
deep passing game that could quickly put up
points was a huge facelift for the offense and

seemed like it could be the x-factor that would
finally push the team over the edge. And for
the first time since the Andrew Luck 'l2 days,
I was just as excited if not more so to see
Stanford's offense on the field as I was to see
the defense.
But as the saying goes, "be careful what you
wish for." As the weeks progressed, a distress
ing trend emerged: With the advent of Stan
ford's passing game, many felt that Stanford
was starting to drift away from its identity as a
primarily power-run team.
Instead of mercilessly plow
ing ahead on short-yardage
downs, we've been seeing
Shaw try and get more cre
ative with his play calling,
likely based at least in part to
his increased confidence in
the passing game.
Because of that loss of
identity, the offense has been
stagnating at inopportune
times, and was even unable to
move the ball consistently on
an Oregon State defense that
was gashed to the tune of 49
points by an FCS team. The
offense has been in a funk for
the last few games and is
limping into the Oregon
matchup on a severe down
note after a hot start to the
season. Meanwhile, last year,
the offense was coming into
the Oregon matchup on a
high after the revelation of
junior Kevin Hogan at quar
terback following the incon
sistency of Josh Nunes 'l3.
The offensive momentum is
going completely in the
wrong direction, and al
though this year's offense is
statistically better, its mojo
seems to be gone.

David: Stanford's offense is
better this year than it was at
this point last season, because
I believe Hogan is better this
season. While Hogan's com
pletion percentage is down
this year, he is being asked to
do a lot vertically in order to
open up running lanes for
Tyler Gaffney. While I have
heard a lot people say that
Stanford just needs to hand
the ball off to Gaffney on
seemingly every down, a pow
er running game's success is
contingent upon the threat of
the downfield pass. Other
wise, Oregon would employ
Notre Dame's strategy from
last season of stacking the
box to stifle Gaffney.
As such, if Stanford hopes
to beat the Ducks this season,
Hogan has to hit his wide re
ceivers consistently down the
field. Fortunately for Stan
ford, Hogan has shown that
he is more than capable of ris
ing to this challenge with the
help of playmakers in junior
wide receiver iy Mont

gomery, sophomore wideout
Kodi Whitfield and, when he
is healthy, junior wideout De
von Cajuste (see Arizona
State, Washington State and
UCLA, among other exam
ples).
However, since memories
appear to be so short-lived
sometimes, and struggles in
hostile road environments
and against quality defensive
coordinators are magnified
(see Justin Wilcox), the Car
dinal has regressed and has
"lost its mojo". Personally, I
don't understand how an of
fense can be statistically bet
ter in most offensive cate
gories, including points per
game (32.6 versus 27.9), rush
ing yards per game (196.4
versus 174.3) and yards per
play (6.2 versus 5.5), but
somehow be worse than last
year's unit.
In addition, each game is
its own entity, so we do not
know how the offense will
perform against Oregon. For
example, Stanford's 2011 of
fense seemingly destroyed
every opponent in its wake,
before playing a poor game
against the Ducks. In that
case, momentum did not mat
ter at all.

Winston: At the risk of hurt
ing David's feelings, I'm go
ing to step into the fray now
and call Mr. Cohn out for his
sarcasm. Do has a reasonable
point in that Stanford's of
fense has not been as effec
tive as we know it can be. The
downfield passing game is in
consistent, and especially so
since Cajuste's injury, while
the run game is consistent
but inconsistently used. More
than anything, Stanford
seems interested in playing to
the level of its opponent
and at times, it seems, by de
sign. Why open up the play
book if you don't need to?
David's use of yards per
play stats is wrong. Football
rewards consistency, not
yardage. Teams need to com
plete drives above anything
else. Let's imagine a scenario
in which Stanford only
throws 99-yard Hail Marys
and completes them 10 per
cent of the time. 9.9 yards per

play would be the "best" of
fense in the country, but the
offense would only score
about a quarter of the time, or
about 20 points per game
and that's if the offense never
turned the ball over or gave
up any sacks.
Consistency and long
drives keep the offense on the
field, which allows the de
fense to rest. The run game is
consistent; that is why it is
important. Even if it doesn't
run as much, Stanford is win
ning. That said, things are not
all well with the Stanford of
fense.
But I can understand why
Stanford is going to the pass
ing game. As Stanford faces
better defenses later in the

year, growing pains are to be
expected, but without Hogan
testing his limits and learning
to run the classic Cardinal
playbook, Stanford's offense
will never reach its full poten
tial. If Hogan can't make Ore
gon pay for stacking the box
against the run, the Ducks
will be kings of the West.

After that smackdown, suggest
some burn, ointment for David
Cohn at dmcohn@Stanford,
edu and help Winston Shi find
a lawyer for the inevitable law
suit from. David's family at
wshi9h@stanford.edu. Ok and
if conflict isn't your thing, con
tact the third party Do-Hyoung

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan (above) and his improved
passing game paid dividends for the Cardinal earlier this
season but has faltered as of late, raising many concerns.
