# RUNNER-UP FINISH FOR CARDINAL
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The No. 11 Stanford men's golf team experienced
firsthand the wild nature of the Lone Star State as it
pulled out a solid second place finish at the Royal
Oaks Intercollegiate, which concluded yesterday in
Dallas. Led by junior Patrick Rodgers, senior
Cameron Wilson and sophomore David Boote, the
Cardinal used a late third-round push to surge back
into second place behind No. 6 Oklahoma State, the
tournament champion.
The event at Royal Oaks was a play-six-count-five
event, meaning teams could play a maximum of six
golfers instead of the usual five, with the five lowest
scores summed instead of the standard four. This put
team depth at a premium, and the Card emphatical
ly showed off its stable of capable players. Rodgers
and Wilson represented Stanford in the top 10, while
Boote continued his solid fall play by placing in a tie
for 13th. Freshman Jim Liu finished tied for 29th at
even par, propelled by a team-low 3-under 68 open
ing round, while junior Patrick Grimes, playing in his
second fall tournament, was the team's No. 5 scorer
with a 1-over-par performance. Also making the trip
