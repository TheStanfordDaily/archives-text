# RUNNER-UP FINISH FOR CARDINAL
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The No. 11 Stanford men's golf team experienced
firsthand the wild nature of the Lone Star State as it
pulled out a solid second place finish at the Royal
Oaks Intercollegiate, which concluded yesterday in
Dallas. Led by junior Patrick Rodgers, senior
Cameron Wilson and sophomore David Boote, the
Cardinal used a late third-round push to surge back
into second place behind No. 6 Oklahoma State, the
tournament champion.
The event at Royal Oaks was a play-six-count-five
event, meaning teams could play a maximum of six
golfers instead of the usual five, with the five lowest
scores summed instead of the standard four. This put
team depth at a premium, and the Card emphatical
ly showed off its stable of capable players. Rodgers
and Wilson represented Stanford in the top 10, while
Boote continued his solid fall play by placing in a tie
for 13th. Freshman Jim Liu finished tied for 29th at
even par, propelled by a team-low 3-under 68 open
ing round, while junior Patrick Grimes, playing in his
second fall tournament, was the team's No. 5 scorer
with a 1-over-par performance. Also making the trip

Royal Oaks Intercollegiate to help the Cardinal fight back late and secure second place.
for the Cardinal was Aus
tralian freshman Viraat Bad
hwar, who played well in his
NCAA debut.
In addition to the five
score format, the golfers
played 54 holes over two days,
completing 36 holes Monday
the first such marathon
day for Stanford this fall.
Head coach Conrad Ray's
squad met the challenge very
well, however, getting pro
gressively better as the day
went on. With Stanford sit
ting in fourth after Monday's
morning frame, Wilson and
Boote took command in the
afternoon as both fired 4-un
der 67s to catapult the Card
over tournament co-hosts

Baylor and SMU into second
place. Things were still tight,
as Stanford trailed the Okla
homa State Cowboys by six
strokes, with only four shots
separating second place from
fifth.
After a disappointing clos
ing round at the U.S. Colle
giate Championships last
week, the Cardinal certainly
wanted to keep its foot on the
accelerator and conclude the
fall season with a bang. Nev
ertheless, the Cardinal did
not have an auspicious start
to yesterday's third round,
and after just nine holes, had
fallen behind Baylor and No.
9 New Mexico, with SMU
nipping at its heels. The
opening half of Tuesday's
round only saw one Stanford
golfer Rodgers score
under par, with a combined
13 bogeys or worse pulling
the team down the leader

board in a fall eerily similar
to the one in Georgia just a
week prior.
What a difference the
next nine would make. For
the second consecutive event,
Rodgers made a furious run
in the final holes, going 5-un
der on the back nine and
storming into the top 10 of
the individual standings. Wil
son, Boote and Grimes had
two birdies apiece over that
same stretch, and the other
squads in front of Stanford
particularly New Mexico,
which went 4-over in the last
nine fell apart. The quick
turnaround in the last half of
the round lifted the Card
back to where it was when the
day started: in second place of
a field with five top-25 teams.
"The fall that we had
with a very competitive
schedule â€”was solid," Ray
remarked. "I think we want-

Ed to have a few better finish
es but to earn a win at Erin
[Hills] and then second in this
field and a decent event in
Georgia Tech being just a few
shots out of third shows
everyone we can be very com
petitive."

The team will now take a
couple of months off from
competition before making its
spring debut February 6-8 at
the Amer Ari Invitational in
Kona, Hawaii.
"I think all the pieces are
in the right spot to make a
run at everyone when we
commence once again this
February," Ray said. "We
have a lot of work to do this
offseason; we have plenty to
think about and process and
learn from. So we're excited
to get to work."
