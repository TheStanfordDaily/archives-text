## TAKING PAUSE The
						Fifth Estate 
### Chi Ling Chan 
Bill Condon's "anti-WikiLeaks"
film, "The Fifth Estate," is a
long-anticipated movie based
on accounts by WikiLeaks insider
Daniel Domscheit-Berg. Even prior
to its showing, controversies over
the film abound.
Julian Assange himself gave the
film an unintended publicity push by
wiiting pre-production letters urg
ing Benedict Cumberbatch (who
plays Assange in the film) not to
take part in what he calls "a reac
tionary snoozefest that only the U.S.
government would love." Doing
what it does best (i.e., spilling the
beans), WikiLeaks leaked the movie
screenplay online and dubbed it "a
work of fiction masquerading as
fact."
Given the online buzz, the film
was expected to do decently well at
the box-office. After all, this is a
biopic of one of the most controver
sial figures of the 21st century. If it
couldn't win over the guys in Reddit
chat rooms, it would at least have the
support of more than 60,000 'Cum
berbitches' (his die-hard fans) who
would pay to see Cumberbatch play
the silver-haired, digital anarchist
that is Assange.
Alas, the $3O million dollar pro
duction raked in a paltry $1.7 million
in the U.S. box office, the worst
opening weekend yet for any 2013
film release. It appeal's that Inter
net fame simply did not translate in
to real-world popularity.
The same, I think, can be said
about WikiLeaks itself: just as In
ternet fandom doesn't necessarily
reap box office earnings, Internet
leaks don't always translate into real
world political change.
The Internet, it must be said, has
made information freer than it has
ever been, enabling access and dis
semination of a large scale. Whereas
in the past exposes involved physi
cally smuggling classified docu
ments, today it is only a matter of
dragging, dropping and clicking
"Send."
Seeing that technology has
sounded the death knell for old-fash
ioned secrecy and ushered in a new
age of radical transparency, Julian
Assange took it upon himself to lib
erate secrets from the guarded
wardrobes of the state. WikiLeaks,
in his view, was performing a public
service through the revelation of
truths that the powerful seek to con
ceal.
The logic behind WikiLeaks is a
simple one: give people information,
and they will change the world. It is
assumed that collecting and dissem
inating damning "state secrets" can
easily upend structures that legit
imize power.
"If we could find one moral man,
one whistle-blower, someone willing
to expose those secrets," the on
screen Assange says with a gravity
befitting a revolutionary at the cusp
of change, "that man can topple the
most powerful and most repressive
of regimes."
But, as it turns out, expecting po
litical change to follow naturally
from giving people access might be
as a naive as banking on Cumber
bitches to move the film up the box
office charts.
Truth be told, the disclosures of
classified cables was a massive pub
lic relations disaster that caused the
State Department much embarrass
ment. But the damages have been
limited, and they have not produced
significant changes in policy and pol
itics.
Even the most controversial

footage, like the infamous "Collater
al Murder", which brought home the
brutality of U.S.'s military actions in
Afghanistan, has inspired surpris
ingly little reaction against U.S. mil
itary engagements abroad. For all
its disclosures, a politically apathetic
public greeted WikiLeaks.
Worse yet, instead of gaining
broad support from the masses,
American public opinion has turned
its back on WikiLeaks. According to
a CNN poll, 77 percent of Americans
disapproved of WikiLeaks' release
of U.S. diplomatic and military docu
ments, believing that the disclosures
damaged U.S foreign relations.
Public sentiment continues to err
on the side of caution: Seventy-five
percent believe that there are "some
things the public does not have a
right to know if it might affect na
tional security". Despite having tak
en the media by storm, WikiLeaks
has had limited effects on public
opinion.
Neither has there been any sign
of a popular movement or youth re
bellion against the gross power im
balance between state and citizens
not even after Edward Snow
den's leaks on Big Brother in the
U.S. One would have expected
Snowden's PRISM and X
KEYSCORE exposes would make
Americans more concerned about
privacy, but that doesn't seem to
have happened.
The majority of Americans still
have few qualms about the NSA
spying on them. The most recent
poll by Pew Research reveals that 56
percent of Americans choose securi
ty over privacy, a proportion that has
surprisingly increased from the
2006 level of 51 percent.
Snowden's revelations about
NSA surveillance programs have
done little to alter public views about
the tradeoff between security and
liberty, or public safety and personal
privacy. This past summer, the US
House of Representatives took an
amendment to vote, which, if passed,
would have ended the NSA's mass
collection of phone records. The
amendment was defeated.
Like Cumberbatch's melodra
matic portrayal of Assange in "The
Fifth Estate," whistle-blowers like
WikiLeaks and Snowden might have
provided more drama than real po
litical change. This is not to say that
their exposes amounted to little.
They have gone some way to pro
moting better political accountabili
ty around the world, reminding us
that we cannot rely on anybody - not
even the government - to tell us the
truth.
But exposing secrets can only go
so far. Real change takes more than
freedom of information: information
alone does not speak for itself, nor is
it an agent of change â€”it is con
strained by people's willingness and
ability to make sense of it, and more
importantly, to act upon it online and
off.
There should be no delusion that
laptop-hogging hackers can change
the world with the mere blow of a
whistle. What comes after the
sounding of the whistle will deter
mine if the community of activists on
the Internet deserves to be called
"The Fifth Estate." Cumbei'bitches
didn't save the movie from its box
office flop, and it is unlikely Wik
iLeaks can change the world not
in the way Assange imagined it will,
and certainly not on its own.
