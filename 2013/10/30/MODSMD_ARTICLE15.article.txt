## Hybrid Vigor 
### Holly Moeller 
If there's one thing I love and
hate about biology, it's that it is
so very complicated. One of the
things that makes it so complicated
is sex.
Yes, those of us in the dating
world and, frankly, engaging in
any sort of interpersonal interac
tions â€” know all about how sex
complicates matters socially. But in
this case, I'm thinking of the fact
that sex likely evolved because,
sometimes, it's better when things
are complicated.
Sex allows organisms to re
arrange then' genes when making
the next generation. As anyone with
biological siblings knows, the chil
dren born to a set of parents share
a lot of traits, but each has a unique
subset of them inherited from each
parent.
Sex is risky: It leaves the assem
bly of these traits to chance. The
offspring born to a particular part
nership can run the gamut from
particularly "fit" (the technical
term that biologists use to say that
an organism is well-suited to its en

vironment and likely to survive and
leave a lot of offspring itself) to
weak and sickly.
One way that sex can make off
spring particularly fit is through the
phenomenon of "hybrid vigor".
Imagine two prospective parents,
each with their own set of positive
and negative attributes.
For example (familiar to many
plant breeders), a wheat plant that
is especially high yielding, and an
other wheat plant that is very short
in stature. Their hybrid offspring
(which formed the foundation of the
"Green Revolution" that supplies
much of our current food supply)
don't waste energy growing big,
tough stalks, but rather invest all
their efforts in producing big,
hearty wheat kernels for human
consumption.
Obviously, "vigor" can be meas
ured in various ways from the
strictly biological definition of fit
ness (reproductive success) to vari
ous measures specific to human
needs (like the production of those
ears of corn).
Another example of hybrid vigor
is sickle cell anemia. Humans with
two copies of the sickle cell trait are
very sick, humans with two copies
of the alternate trait are vulnerable
to malaria, and humans with one
copy of each are, as Goldilocks
would say, "just right".
And, hybrid vigor doesn't just
apply to the biology of sex.
I've spent the last few days sur
rounded by American and Canadian
scientists, at a workshop focused on
how we should manage the precious
resources contained in our freshwa
ter and marine ecosystems. The
main message that came across in
four days of lectures and discus
sions was that we're going to need a
lot of hybridization.
Indeed, all of the scientists at the
workshop including me were
hybrids ourselves, using mathemat
ical tools to solve biological prob
lems. Fisheries, which were a major
topic of interest, are particularly
amenable to such combined ap
proaches.
Their assessment requires biolo
gists (to count fish, calculate growth
rates, and determine habitat quality
and needs) as well as mathematical
modelers (who have been particu
larly successful at calculating things
like maximum sustainable yield and
appropriate harvest rates).

The more I work on mathemati
cal ecology problems, the more I'm
struck by the importance of hybrid
vigor in this field. Many of the most
prolific scientists trained in fields
like physics and applied mathemat
ics before turning their attention to
biological problems. By applying
the skills and techniques they'd
learned in their previous work,
they've often had great success at
understanding and modeling bio
logical problems.
When it comes to fisheries, of
course, the process doesn't stop
with the combination of math and
biology.
The scientific assessment is
merely the first step in the manage
ment process. Regardless of what
those in the ivory tower may have
to say, fisheries can't be regulated
without the participation of political
and social leaders. Which means
that scientists like me have to think
about other ways to hybridize.
For me, that often involves try
ing to bridge the gap with econom
ics. For others, it means developing
new monitoring and predictive
tools that are quick and easy for
busy managers to learn to use. And
if we reached one conclusion at our
workshop, it's that there's still
plenty of hybridization work to be
done.
While this knowledge is over
whelming (and, frankly, terrifying),
it's also very exciting. After all, this
is why I went into ecology the
study of how plants and animals in
teract with each other and their en
vironment is about as broad and
complicated a field as I can imag
ine.
It's a field full of tough problems
with global implications, and we
can't make scientific progress
working in isolation. Ecologists
have to be experts in their own fo
cal areas, and experts in knowing
how and when to turn to others for
expertise.
Frankly, I can't imagine any
thing better than this sort of hy
bridization: fixing the world, and
making friends while doing it.
