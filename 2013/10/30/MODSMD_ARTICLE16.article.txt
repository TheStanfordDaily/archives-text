# SLUMPING TROJANS VISIT MAPLES
## 
### JORDAN WALLACH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Going into its Oct. 4 matchup
against USC in Los Angeles, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
had not been swept in 55 consecutive
matches a streak dating back to
Oct. 29, 2011. But in a matter of 92
minutes, the Trojans ended the run
by defeating the Cardinal in three
sets.
Tonight, the No. 6 Cardinal (15-4,

8-2 Pac-12) will look to extend a dif
ferent streak against No. 4 USC (18-
3, 8-2) once again in a match with
Pac-12 Championship implications.
Stanford has not lost at Maples
Pavilion since Dec, 3, 2011, a run of
24 consecutive home wins.
"We are trying to get as many stu
dents there as possible," said junior
libero Kyle Gilbert. Being at home,
there's just a whole level of comfort
for us. It'll be a definite advantage."
In the first match between the

conference rivals, Stanford was out
hit for just the second time this sea
son, .358 to .245. The team's lack of
defense surprising considering it
leads the nation with 3.04 blocks per
set was a main factor in the loss.
The Card tallied just four blocks in
the entire match, with all four dur
ing a third set in which the team
held an eight-point lead, before
watching it slip away.
"The effort on defense wasn't as
strong as it could have been, and

that's something that we've been re
ally working on," Gilbert said. "Now
we're digging a lot of balls, touching
a lot of balls on the block, and it's re
ally changed our game in the past
few weeks."
Over the six matches since the
loss to USC, Stanford has averaged
16.7 digs per set, up from the team's
15.4 mark over the first 13 matches
of the season. Gilbert has led the de
fense with 4.75 digs per set this sea
son including a 5.20 average over

her last six matches good for sec
ond in the Pac-12.

A key player in turning those
digs into kills has been sophomore
Madi Bugg, whose 11.57 assists per
set this season ranks second in the
Pac-12 and 11th in the nation. She
has appeared in all 63 sets for the
Cardinal this season and has tallied
at least 30 assists in 15 of the team's
19 matches. The rock for the Cardi
nal offense all season has been senior
outside hitter Carly Wopat, whose
.484 hitting percentage is the best in
the Pac-12 and ranks third nationally.
The Trojans enter tonight's tus
sle having lost two of their last three
matches, sandwiching a win against
Washington State between losses
against Arizona and surprise confer
ence leader No. 3 Washington. Avis
it to Stanford as it looks to break its
slump is not an easy matchup for
USC, as the team has not won a set
at Maples since 2009 and has not
won a match there since 2006.
Defensively for the Trojans, the
player to watch is senior libero Na
talie Hagglund, who has tallied
2,059 digs over her four years and is
the Pac-12 leader with 4.90 digs per
set. With 13 digs in tonight's match,
Hagglund would surpass USC's
school record of 2,071.
Offensively, sophomore outside
hitter Samantha Bricio ranks sec
ond in the country with 0.76 service
aces per set, with a serve that has
been clocked at over 50 mph. Fresh
man outside hitter Ebony
Nwanebu, who ranks second on the
team with 3.09 kills per set, has
earned four Pac-12 Freshman of the
Week awards.
The Cardinal will look to extend
its home winning streak and move
up in the conference standings
tonight at 7 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
The match will be televised on Pac
-12 Networks.

Junior libera Kyle Gilbert (right) currently ranks second in the Pac-12 with a team-leading 4.75 digs per set this season. Gilbert and the Cardinal
will look to continue the Trojans' slump and build on a home winning streak against USC that stretches all the way back to the 2006 season.
Going into its Oct. 4 matchup
against USC in Los Angeles, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
had not been swept in 55 consecutive
matches a streak dating back to
Oct. 29, 2011. But in a matter of 92
minutes, the Trojans ended the run
by defeating the Cardinal in three
sets.
Tonight, the No. 6 Cardinal (15-4,

8-2 Pac-12) will look to extend a dif
ferent streak against No. 4 USC (18-
3, 8-2) once again in a match with
Pac-12 Championship implications.
Stanford has not lost at Maples
Pavilion since Dec, 3, 2011, a run of
24 consecutive home wins.
"We are trying to get as many stu
dents there as possible," said junior
libero Kyle Gilbert. Being at home,
there's just a whole level of comfort
for us. It'll be a definite advantage."
In the first match between the

conference rivals, Stanford was out
hit for just the second time this sea
son, .358 to .245. The team's lack of
defense surprising considering it
leads the nation with 3.04 blocks per
set was a main factor in the loss.
The Card tallied just four blocks in
the entire match, with all four dur
ing a third set in which the team
held an eight-point lead, before
watching it slip away.
"The effort on defense wasn't as
strong as it could have been, and

that's something that we've been re
ally working on," Gilbert said. "Now
we're digging a lot of balls, touching
a lot of balls on the block, and it's re
ally changed our game in the past
few weeks."
Over the six matches since the
loss to USC, Stanford has averaged
16.7 digs per set, up from the team's
15.4 mark over the first 13 matches
of the season. Gilbert has led the de
fense with 4.75 digs per set this sea
son including a 5.20 average over

her last six matches good for sec
ond in the Pac-12.

A key player in turning those
digs into kills has been sophomore
Madi Bugg, whose 11.57 assists per
set this season ranks second in the
Pac-12 and 11th in the nation. She
has appeared in all 63 sets for the
Cardinal this season and has tallied
at least 30 assists in 15 of the team's
19 matches. The rock for the Cardi
nal offense all season has been senior
outside hitter Carly Wopat, whose
.484 hitting percentage is the best in
the Pac-12 and ranks third nationally.
The Trojans enter tonight's tus
sle having lost two of their last three
matches, sandwiching a win against
Washington State between losses
against Arizona and surprise confer
ence leader No. 3 Washington. Avis
it to Stanford as it looks to break its
slump is not an easy matchup for
USC, as the team has not won a set
at Maples since 2009 and has not
won a match there since 2006.
Defensively for the Trojans, the
player to watch is senior libero Na
talie Hagglund, who has tallied
2,059 digs over her four years and is
the Pac-12 leader with 4.90 digs per
set. With 13 digs in tonight's match,
Hagglund would surpass USC's
school record of 2,071.
Offensively, sophomore outside
hitter Samantha Bricio ranks sec
ond in the country with 0.76 service
aces per set, with a serve that has
been clocked at over 50 mph. Fresh
man outside hitter Ebony
Nwanebu, who ranks second on the
team with 3.09 kills per set, has
earned four Pac-12 Freshman of the
Week awards.
The Cardinal will look to extend
its home winning streak and move
up in the conference standings
tonight at 7 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
The match will be televised on Pac
-12 Networks.
