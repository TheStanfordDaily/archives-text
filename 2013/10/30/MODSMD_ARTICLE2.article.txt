# Experts talk education
## Hennessy, GSE dean take part in SPREES panel 
### SARAH MOORE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Tuesday evening, the Stanford
Pre-Education Society (SPREES) held
its debut event, a panel discussion fea
turing President John Hennessy and
prominent education experts. They fo
cused on available careers in education
and attracting Stanford students to
ward a career in education.
The event was co-sponsored by The
Graduate School of Education (GSE)
and the Education and Society Theme
(EAST) House.
SPREES founder and president Ju
lia Quintero 'l5 anticipated the event
would generate a new discussion sur
rounding education reform.
"I want this event to create [a] real
ly important conversation that is not
being had about education reform,"
Quintero said.
On the topic of reform, Hennessy
spoke about the politics surrounding
education in the U.S. and the need to
better fund schools.
"We've got to spend more money on
young people in this country and move

from spending disproportionate
amounts of money on people over 65 to
those under 15," he said.
In addition to President Hennessy,
Claude Steele, dean of the Graduate
School of Education (GSE), Michael
Kirst, president of the California State

Board of Education and Rachel Lotan
M.A 'Bl M.A. 'B3 Ph.D. 'B5, director of
the Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram, spoke at the event. Quintero said
the selection of speakers was impor
tant for facilitating a serious conversa
tion.
"I also wanted to invite speakers
who have the gravitas to grant legiti
macy to the idea that Stanford stu
dents can and should become teachers
or go into education in general," Quin
tero said.
During the event, the four panelists
addressed the question of career path
ways for education as a field. Steele
said that like other professions, educa
tion should be rooted in research.
Kirst emphasized that a career in
education qualifies students for profes
sions that go beyond teaching. Last
year, he said, GSE graduates went on
to work for companies that included
Apple, UNESCO and the New York
City Department of Education.
Lotan shared similar ideas.
"Teaching is the profession that

makes all professions possi
ble," she said.
She also added that teach
ing as a career deserves more
status and monetary com
pensation than it currently
does in American society.
"Teaching is a political
and a moral act," Lotan said.
"When we decide why we
teach, we are making a politi
cal decision. We are express
ing our vision and our goal for
the future of society."
Although the conversa
tion focused on attracting
students to careers in educa
tion, some students are al
ready passionate about a fu
ture in teaching.
Nicole Kofman 'l5, who at
tended the event, said she has
wanted to be a teacher since
the fourth grade, and al
though she does not plan on
entering the field immediate
ly after graduation, she would

like to be a K-12 teacher at
some point in her life.
Kofman said her favorite
elementary and high school
teachers inspired her, and
she wishes more people
would have respect for the
teaching profession.
"One thing in particular
that struck me was hearing
Lotan talk about the passion
that guides some into teach
ing," Kofman said. "A lot of
these people are the ones
who end up being the best
teachers."
Although not personally
interested in pursuing a ca
reer in education, senior
Aaron Nagao B.S. 'l4 M.S.
'l5 said he valued the panel
discussion and supports the
expansion of programs like
the Stanford Teacher Educa
tion Program, which allows
graduate education students
who are interested in teach
ing to gain both academic and
practical experience in a
classroom setting.
"I'm glad the panel was
able to cover a variety of top
ics, especially the politics as

pect of education in Califor
nia and the current news
from the State Board," Na
gao said. "For an undergrad
uate group to put [the event]
on, it was impressive."
According to Quintero,
SPREES is currently plan
ning a number of other events
and programs for undergrad
uates interested in a career in

education, including an in
ternship program for shadow
ing teachers in the area, men
torship programing between
undergraduates and graduate
students in education and
weekly lunches for discussion
on issues in education.

Kirst emphasized that a career in
education qualifies students for profes

year, he said, GSE graduates went on
to work for companies that included
Apple, UNESCO and the New York
City Department of Education.
Lotan shared similar ideas.

makes all professions possi
ble," she said.
She also added that teach
ing as a career deserves more
status and monetary com
pensation than it currently
does in American society.
"Teaching is a political
and a moral act," Lotan said.
"When we decide why we
teach, we are making a politi
cal decision. We are express
ing our vision and our goal for
the future of society."
Although the conversa
tion focused on attracting
students to careers in educa
tion, some students are al
ready passionate about a fu
ture in teaching.
Nicole Kofman 'l5, who at
tended the event, said she has
wanted to be a teacher since
the fourth grade, and al
though she does not plan on
entering the field immediate
ly after graduation, she would

like to be a K-12 teacher at
some point in her life.
Kofman said her favorite
elementary and high school
teachers inspired her, and
she wishes more people
would have respect for the
teaching profession.
"One thing in particular
that struck me was hearing
Lotan talk about the passion
that guides some into teach
ing," Kofman said. "A lot of
these people are the ones
who end up being the best
teachers."
Although not personally
interested in pursuing a ca
reer in education, senior
Aaron Nagao B.S. 'l4 M.S.
'l5 said he valued the panel
discussion and supports the
expansion of programs like
the Stanford Teacher Educa
tion Program, which allows
graduate education students
who are interested in teach
ing to gain both academic and
practical experience in a
classroom setting.
"I'm glad the panel was
able to cover a variety of top
ics, especially the politics as

pect of education in Califor
nia and the current news
from the State Board," Na
gao said. "For an undergrad
uate group to put [the event]
on, it was impressive."
According to Quintero,
SPREES is currently plan
ning a number of other events
and programs for undergrad
uates interested in a career in

education, including an in
ternship program for shadow
ing teachers in the area, men
torship programing between
undergraduates and graduate
students in education and
weekly lunches for discussion
on issues in education.

Rachel Lotan, director of the Stanford Teacher Education
Program (right), and Michael Kirst, president of the California State Board of Education (left), joined the SPREES panel.
On Tuesday evening, the Stanford
Pre-Education Society (SPREES) held
its debut event, a panel discussion fea
turing President John Hennessy and
prominent education experts. They fo
cused on available careers in education
and attracting Stanford students to
ward a career in education.
The event was co-sponsored by The
Graduate School of Education (GSE)
and the Education and Society Theme
(EAST) House.
SPREES founder and president Ju
lia Quintero 'l5 anticipated the event
would generate a new discussion sur
rounding education reform.
"I want this event to create [a] real
ly important conversation that is not
being had about education reform,"
Quintero said.
On the topic of reform, Hennessy
spoke about the politics surrounding
education in the U.S. and the need to
better fund schools.
"We've got to spend more money on
young people in this country and move

from spending disproportionate
amounts of money on people over 65 to
those under 15," he said.
In addition to President Hennessy,
Claude Steele, dean of the Graduate
School of Education (GSE), Michael
Kirst, president of the California State

Board of Education and Rachel Lotan
M.A 'Bl M.A. 'B3 Ph.D. 'B5, director of
the Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram, spoke at the event. Quintero said
the selection of speakers was impor
tant for facilitating a serious conversa
tion.
"I also wanted to invite speakers
who have the gravitas to grant legiti
macy to the idea that Stanford stu
dents can and should become teachers
or go into education in general," Quin
tero said.
During the event, the four panelists
addressed the question of career path
ways for education as a field. Steele
said that like other professions, educa
tion should be rooted in research.
