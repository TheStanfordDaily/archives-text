### SARAH MOORE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Tuesday evening, the Stanford
Pre-Education Society (SPREES) held
its debut event, a panel discussion fea
turing President John Hennessy and
prominent education experts. They fo
cused on available careers in education
and attracting Stanford students to
ward a career in education.
The event was co-sponsored by The
Graduate School of Education (GSE)
and the Education and Society Theme
(EAST) House.
SPREES founder and president Ju
lia Quintero 'l5 anticipated the event
would generate a new discussion sur
rounding education reform.
"I want this event to create [a] real
ly important conversation that is not
being had about education reform,"
Quintero said.
On the topic of reform, Hennessy
spoke about the politics surrounding
education in the U.S. and the need to
better fund schools.
"We've got to spend more money on
young people in this country and move

from spending disproportionate
amounts of money on people over 65 to
those under 15," he said.
In addition to President Hennessy,
Claude Steele, dean of the Graduate
School of Education (GSE), Michael
Kirst, president of the California State

Board of Education and Rachel Lotan
M.A 'Bl M.A. 'B3 Ph.D. 'B5, director of
the Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram, spoke at the event. Quintero said
the selection of speakers was impor
tant for facilitating a serious conversa
tion.
"I also wanted to invite speakers
who have the gravitas to grant legiti
macy to the idea that Stanford stu
dents can and should become teachers
or go into education in general," Quin
tero said.
During the event, the four panelists
addressed the question of career path
ways for education as a field. Steele
said that like other professions, educa
tion should be rooted in research.
Kirst emphasized that a career in
education qualifies students for profes
sions that go beyond teaching. Last
year, he said, GSE graduates went on
to work for companies that included
Apple, UNESCO and the New York
City Department of Education.
Lotan shared similar ideas.
"Teaching is the profession that
