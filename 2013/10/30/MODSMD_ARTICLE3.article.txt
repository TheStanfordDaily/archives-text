## Med school creates new certification 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Prevention Research Center is
launching Health 4 America (H4A) a nine
month, post-baccalaureate professional certificate
program —in January that combines an evidence
based curriculum with a practical component.
H4A is currently accepting applications for 25
fellows who will complete three quarters of course
work and internship activities, with the first quar
ter front-loading the on-campus class experience
and the second and third quarter shifting toward
practical experience.
"Health 4 America will be taught by our faculty
and covers managing chronic disease, what is the ba
sic science behind changing human behavior, how to
engage communities to take ownership of their
health and how do you measure the impact of what
you're doing," said Sonoo Thadaney, director of pro
gram development at the Prevention Research Cen
ter.
According to Thadaney, H4A was developed
with the aim of providing students an opportunity
to experience learning through service, with the
idea that combining the experience of both working
and learning is much more powerful and practical
for its participants.
"One of the goals of the Health 4 America pro
gram is to provide an experience that is different
from what students would be receiving in public
health school or pre-professional school," said
Randy Stafford, one of H4As faculty members who
will be teaching the first class of the entire pro
gram, The Science of Prevention.
Stafford and other faculty members will act as
the fellows' professors during class and as mentors
during their internships.
Stafford, who also teaches undergraduates with
the Human Biology program, said that for a recent
ly graduated student, H4A is away of exploring a
number of topics that he or she might not be ex
posed to in professional schools, and it would serve
as a transition stage where the student would be
able to look at health care at a broader level.
'All the faculty members have an interest to
meet the needs of the students," Stafford said. "We
want to work individually with the fellows to help
them in that process to clarify career goals."
However, the fellows' learning will be not re
stricted to on-campus. Fellows will be matched with
various community centers in the local area for in
ternships. Stanford clinics, local public schools and

the Indian Health Center of
Santa Clara Valley have al
ready expressed interest in
partnering with H4A.
"We know that wellness
and health starts with clinics
and hospitals," said Thadaney,
explaining the rationale for re
quiring fellows to serve in the
community.
"But the health care sys
tem right now is monitored
on treatment, not on preven

tion. So not having one with
the other was insufficient,"
she added. "We felt we had to
have both to have the impact
we want to have to create a
wider and deeper impact."
In addition to being part
ners with off-campus commu
nity centers, the program is in
collaboration with other de
partments on campus to devel
op its interdisciplinary cur
riculum.
"We're in conversations
with the design school with
how to incoiporate their de
sign thinking strategies into
our curriculum, with the Grad
uate School of Education on

the fact that people learn dif
ferently —which can be used
in public health campaigns
and with other centers and de
partments," Thadaney said.
The interest for the H4A
program ranges from post
graduates to those retiring
and looking for another ca
reer, but Thadaney and
Stafford think a diverse
group with a shared mission
and goal is for the better.
This is because one of the
most important components
of the program, according to
Thadaney, is the peer men
torship through the three
quarters of the program. As

fellows will have different
backgrounds and experi
ences, the reflections that
they each make and share
with the group will be useful
and provide a breadth of
perspectives.
"It will absolutely be a
challenge, but we have to
take advantage of the bene
fits that the students will
come to us at different levels
and skills," Stafford said.
"Everyone will really get to
rethink their role in the
health care system."

"One of the goals of the Health 4 America pro
gram is to provide an experience that is different
from what students would be receiving in public
health school or pre-professional school," said
Randy Stafford, one of H4As faculty members who
will be teaching the first class of the entire pro
gram, The Science of Prevention.
Stafford and other faculty members will act as
the fellows' professors during class and as mentors
during their internships.
Stafford, who also teaches undergraduates with
the Human Biology program, said that for a recent
ly graduated student, H4A is away of exploring a
number of topics that he or she might not be ex
posed to in professional schools, and it would serve
as a transition stage where the student would be
able to look at health care at a broader level.
'All the faculty members have an interest to
meet the needs of the students," Stafford said. "We
want to work individually with the fellows to help
them in that process to clarify career goals."
However, the fellows' learning will be not re
stricted to on-campus. Fellows will be matched with
various community centers in the local area for in
ternships. Stanford clinics, local public schools and

the Indian Health Center of
Santa Clara Valley have al
ready expressed interest in
partnering with H4A.
"We know that wellness
and health starts with clinics
and hospitals," said Thadaney,
explaining the rationale for re
quiring fellows to serve in the
community.
"But the health care sys
tem right now is monitored
on treatment, not on preven

tion. So not having one with
the other was insufficient,"
she added. "We felt we had to
have both to have the impact
we want to have to create a
wider and deeper impact."
In addition to being part
ners with off-campus commu
nity centers, the program is in
collaboration with other de
partments on campus to devel
op its interdisciplinary cur
riculum.
"We're in conversations
with the design school with
how to incoiporate their de
sign thinking strategies into
our curriculum, with the Grad
uate School of Education on

the fact that people learn dif
ferently —which can be used
in public health campaigns
and with other centers and de
partments," Thadaney said.
The interest for the H4A
program ranges from post
graduates to those retiring
and looking for another ca
reer, but Thadaney and
Stafford think a diverse
group with a shared mission
and goal is for the better.
This is because one of the
most important components
of the program, according to
Thadaney, is the peer men
torship through the three
quarters of the program. As

fellows will have different
backgrounds and experi
ences, the reflections that
they each make and share
with the group will be useful
and provide a breadth of
perspectives.
"It will absolutely be a
challenge, but we have to
take advantage of the bene
fits that the students will
come to us at different levels
and skills," Stafford said.
"Everyone will really get to
rethink their role in the
health care system."

The Stanford Prevention Research Center is
launching Health 4 America (H4A) a nine
month, post-baccalaureate professional certificate
program —in January that combines an evidence
based curriculum with a practical component.
H4A is currently accepting applications for 25
fellows who will complete three quarters of course
work and internship activities, with the first quar
ter front-loading the on-campus class experience
and the second and third quarter shifting toward
practical experience.
"Health 4 America will be taught by our faculty
and covers managing chronic disease, what is the ba
sic science behind changing human behavior, how to
engage communities to take ownership of their
health and how do you measure the impact of what
you're doing," said Sonoo Thadaney, director of pro
gram development at the Prevention Research Cen
ter.
According to Thadaney, H4A was developed
with the aim of providing students an opportunity
to experience learning through service, with the
idea that combining the experience of both working
and learning is much more powerful and practical
for its participants.
"One of the goals of the Health 4 America pro
gram is to provide an experience that is different
from what students would be receiving in public
health school or pre-professional school," said
Randy Stafford, one of H4As faculty members who
