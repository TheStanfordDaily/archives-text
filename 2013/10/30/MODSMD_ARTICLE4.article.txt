## DEFENSIVE END GARDNER LOST FOR REST OF SEASON 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Fifth-year senior defensive end
Ben Gardner will miss the remainder
of the 2013 season with a torn pec
toral muscle suffered in the third
quarter against Oregon State Satur
day, head coach David Shaw an
nounced Tuesday.
Gardner had been dealing with an
arm injury since the Washington
game on Oct. 5, but up until Saturday,
he had not suffered structural dam
age that would have caused him to
miss extended time. Gardner suf
fered the injury while reaching his
left arm out in an attempt to sack
Oregon State quarterback Sean

Mannion. Gardner has recorded 19
tackles, 71/2 tackles for loss, 41/2 sacks
and a blocked punt this season, bring
ing his career totals to 106 tackles, 34
tackles for loss and 171/2 sacks.
"As a coach you're not supposed to
have favorites," Shaw said, "but I've
told Ben and told the team that Ben's
always been one of my favorites."
Gardner, one of four team cap
tains, has started 34 of Stanford's last
35 games dating back to the start of
the 2011 season. Gardner was named
second-team All-Pac-12 in both 2011
and 2012, and the fifth-year senior
was expected to gain at least that
honor in 2013.

Fifth-year senior defensive end Ben Gardner (above) will miss the rest of
his final season on the Farm after suffering a torn pectoral muscle at
OSU. His loss will test the abilities of an already depleted defensive line.
