## DEFENSIVE END GARDNER LOST FOR REST OF SEASON 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Fifth-year senior defensive end
Ben Gardner will miss the remainder
of the 2013 season with a torn pec
toral muscle suffered in the third
quarter against Oregon State Satur
day, head coach David Shaw an
nounced Tuesday.
Gardner had been dealing with an
arm injury since the Washington
game on Oct. 5, but up until Saturday,
he had not suffered structural dam
age that would have caused him to
miss extended time. Gardner suf
fered the injury while reaching his
left arm out in an attempt to sack
Oregon State quarterback Sean

Mannion. Gardner has recorded 19
tackles, 71/2 tackles for loss, 41/2 sacks
and a blocked punt this season, bring
ing his career totals to 106 tackles, 34
tackles for loss and 171/2 sacks.
"As a coach you're not supposed to
have favorites," Shaw said, "but I've
told Ben and told the team that Ben's
always been one of my favorites."
Gardner, one of four team cap
tains, has started 34 of Stanford's last
35 games dating back to the start of
the 2011 season. Gardner was named
second-team All-Pac-12 in both 2011
and 2012, and the fifth-year senior
was expected to gain at least that
honor in 2013.

Fifth-year senior defensive end Ben Gardner (above) will miss the rest of
his final season on the Farm after suffering a torn pectoral muscle at
OSU. His loss will test the abilities of an already depleted defensive line.
The injury is another
blow to Stanford's already
severely depleted defensive
line. Senior defensive end
Henry Anderson has been
out since suffering a knee in
jury against Army, sopho
more defensive tackle Iken
na Nwafor is out with a leg
injury and senior defensive
tackle David Parry is fight
ing through an abdominal in
jury. Anderson has a chance
to return against Oregon
next Thursday.
"It hurts us a lot as a
team," said senior inside
linebacker A. J. Tarpley, "but
it hurts more as a friend."
Even before Gardner's
season-ending injury, the in
juries on the defensive line
had caused position shifts for
the Cardinal. Sophomore
Luke Kaumatule moved
from tight end to defensive
end before Stanford's game
against UCLA, and senior
Blake Lueders moved from
outside linebacker to defen
sive end before Utah.
The injury to Gardner
could not have come at a
worse time, with the No. 2
Oregon Ducks coming to
Stanford Stadium on Nov. 7.
In the past few games be
tween Stanford and Oregon,
the Cardinal has tried to ro
tate its players on defense as
much as possible. Without
the emergence of a few
younger players and the re
turn of Henry Anderson,
Stanford may have to shift
more players to defensive
line or be forced to keep its
starters in for longer periods
of time. If that becomes nec
essary, Gardner will be
around to help the younger
players along.
"He's not going any

where," Shaw said. "He'll be
here. And the people that
take his place on the field
need to feel his presence."
Gardner's injury is a
somber end to a spectacular
collegiate career that began
with very humble expecta
tions. Thought by many to be
too undersized to play defen
sive end at a high level,
Gardner was not offered a
scholarship from any AQ
conference school besides
Stanford.

Gardner only earned the
scholarship offer from Stan
ford when, late in the re
cruiting process, then-Stan
ford head coach Jim Har
baugh heard about Gardner
through his dad, Jack Har
baugh, who ran across Gard
ner while working at Mar
quette. Gardner went to high
school in Mequon, Wis., a
suburb of Milwaukee where
Marquette is located.
After redshirting the
2009 season, Gardner began
to impress on special teams
as a sophomore in 2010. By
the time the 2011 season ar
rived, Gardner had earned
the starting role that he held
until today's announcement.
With the injury ending
his collegiate career, Gard
ner will now turn towards
trying to heal quickly in
preparation for the 2014
NFL Draft, held in May.
Gardner was projected by
many to be a mid-round pick
in the draft â€”CBS Sports
has him listed as the No. 9
defensive end and gives him
a third-round grade but
the injury could affect his
draft stock.

Stanford, down one of its
four captains, takes on Ore
gon in one of the most antici
pated matchups of the sea
son next Thursday. Kickoff is
scheduled for 6 p.m.
