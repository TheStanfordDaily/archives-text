## Dawkins, Senate aim to increase fan support Men's basketball head coach looks to senators to improve game attendance 
### ANDREW VOGELEY 
The 15th Undergraduate Senate held a two
hour meeting Tuesday night that included an ap
pearance from men's basketball head coach John
ny Dawkins, who was there to discuss ways to in
crease support for the basketball program.
The senators also discussed the recent deci
sion by the Graduate Student Council (GSC) to
veto the Board of Judicial Affairs (B JA) bylaws to
the Student Judicial Charter.
Dawkins accompanied by Kevin Aha, as
sistant director of marketing and event presenta
tion in the athletic department spoke of the
need to create a better student fan environment
in Maples Pavilion, and looked to the Senate for
help.
"We have five seniors and these five seniors
have the opportunity to do something special, but
it won't happen if everybody isn't on board,"
Dawkins said. "We need everybody to get en
gaged."
Senate Chair Ben Holston 'l5 came away
from the conversation impressed.
"Coach Dawkins was articulate and well-spo
ken, and I think he got his message across very
clearly," Holston said. "I hope that there are
some senators who can go back to their commu
nities and come up with ideas to get people who
haven't cared about basketball more involved."
Dawkins said that only 1,000 students were
needed to fill the lower bowl of Maples Pavilion,
which, according to Dawkins, would create a
great atmosphere.
Aha announced to the Senate that a contest
would be held over the first three games.
"Whichever dorm or house brings the most
students to the first three games will receive
guaranteed front row seating to the Big Game,"
Aha said.
The first three games will see the Cardinal
play Bucknell University, Brigham Young Uni
versity and Northwestern University.
In addition to meeting with Dawkins and Aha,
the Senate took the next step on the BJA issue af
ter the GSC voted to overturn the board's eight
bylaws last Wednesday, appointing three mem
bers of the Senate to serve on the Joint Legisla
tive Committee on Judicial Affairs: John-Lan
caster Finley 'l6, Hisham Al-Falih 'l6 and
Natasha Patel 'l6.
"We are going in [to the committee] to initiate
conversation and open up the discussion and
make something happen that benefits the stu
dents," Finley said. "The Board of Judicial Af
fairs and Office of Community Standards and
students who were involved in the process and
alumni who were concerned about it have the
same final goal, which is to make sure the stu
dents are served the best."
"Everybody is equally wanting to participate
in this conversation," Finley added.
