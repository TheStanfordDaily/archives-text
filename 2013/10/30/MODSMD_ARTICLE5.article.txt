### ANDREW VOGELEY 
The 15th Undergraduate Senate held a two
hour meeting Tuesday night that included an ap
pearance from men's basketball head coach John
ny Dawkins, who was there to discuss ways to in
crease support for the basketball program.
The senators also discussed the recent deci
sion by the Graduate Student Council (GSC) to
veto the Board of Judicial Affairs (B JA) bylaws to
the Student Judicial Charter.
Dawkins accompanied by Kevin Aha, as
sistant director of marketing and event presenta
tion in the athletic department spoke of the
need to create a better student fan environment
in Maples Pavilion, and looked to the Senate for
help.
"We have five seniors and these five seniors
have the opportunity to do something special, but
it won't happen if everybody isn't on board,"
Dawkins said. "We need everybody to get en
gaged."
Senate Chair Ben Holston 'l5 came away
from the conversation impressed.
"Coach Dawkins was articulate and well-spo
ken, and I think he got his message across very
clearly," Holston said. "I hope that there are
some senators who can go back to their commu
nities and come up with ideas to get people who
haven't cared about basketball more involved."
Dawkins said that only 1,000 students were
needed to fill the lower bowl of Maples Pavilion,
which, according to Dawkins, would create a
great atmosphere.
Aha announced to the Senate that a contest
would be held over the first three games.
"Whichever dorm or house brings the most
students to the first three games will receive
guaranteed front row seating to the Big Game,"
Aha said.
The first three games will see the Cardinal
play Bucknell University, Brigham Young Uni
versity and Northwestern University.
In addition to meeting with Dawkins and Aha,
the Senate took the next step on the BJA issue af
ter the GSC voted to overturn the board's eight
bylaws last Wednesday, appointing three mem
bers of the Senate to serve on the Joint Legisla
tive Committee on Judicial Affairs: John-Lan
caster Finley 'l6, Hisham Al-Falih 'l6 and
Natasha Patel 'l6.
"We are going in [to the committee] to initiate
conversation and open up the discussion and
make something happen that benefits the stu
dents," Finley said. "The Board of Judicial Af
fairs and Office of Community Standards and
students who were involved in the process and
alumni who were concerned about it have the
same final goal, which is to make sure the stu
dents are served the best."
"Everybody is equally wanting to participate
in this conversation," Finley added.
The Senate also appoint
ed three senators to the re
cently created Senate Inno
vation Rind ad-hoc commit
tee.
Senators Nikos Lio
dakis'l6, Ryan Matsumoto 'l6
and Ilya Mouzykantskii'l6
were chosen to serve on the

committee, which will moni
tor the reimbursement by a
senator requesting money
from the Senate Innovation
Rind.
"The Senate Innovation
Rind ad-hoc committee exists
to loosely oversee Senate in
novation funding requests,"
Mouzykantskii said. "If it has
an issue with anyone in par
ticular, it can bring it to the
attention of the committee or
to the attention of the Senate."
"As the bill's author, I think

it is reasonable I am on that
committee," he added.
The Senate passed two
other bills on Tuesday night.
One bill amended Senate rules
of order and the other allocat
ed discretionary funding for
food for Senate meetings.
In addition, the Senate's
Communication Committee
reported that it was in the
process of planning a rally for
the football team's Nov. 7
game against Oregon.
"We are trying to connect

students to what they want,"
said Senator Brianna Brown
'l6.
Liodakis also noted that
there was a possibility that
ESPN would be filming the
rally, which is tentatively
scheduled for 1:50 p.m. the
day of the game.
Additionally, the Senate
passed $24,736.56 in funding
bills.
