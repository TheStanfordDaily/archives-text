## Faculty awarded $2.2 million for innovative energy research 
### â€“ Helin Gao 
Stanford's Precourt Insti
tute for Energy, Precourt
Energy Efficiency Center
and the TomKat Center for
Sustainable Energy have an
nounced a new crop of seed
grants for innovative re
search in clean technology
and energy efficiency.
The 11 awarded projects
will receive a total of $2.2 mil
lion, with research topics
ranging from engineering to
education.
"There were lots of good
proposals, which induced a
lively debate in the selection
committee," said Lynn Orr,
director of the Precourt In
stitute, in an interview with
the Stanford Report.
The two judging commit
tees, consisting of faculty and

senior staff members, re
ceived a total of 42 proposals
from across the campus.
These proposals offered a va
riety of approaches to
achieve an affordable, effi
cient energy system.
Among the proposals re
ceiving a seed grant include
"Improving Predictions of
the Efficiency of Natural
Ventilation in Building",
which aims to advance the de
sign of buildings that capital
ize on natural ventilation for
temperature control without
compensating comfort. This
research was jointly pro
posed by Gianluca laccarino,
mechanical engineering asso
ciate professor, and Martin
Fischer M.S. 'B7 Ph.D. '9l,
civil and environmental engi
neering professor.
Apart from the three
Stanford institutions, Wendy
and Eric Schmidt and the
Stinehart/Reed Awards also
contributed to support the
2013 seed grants.
