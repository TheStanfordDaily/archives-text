## A
						history of entertaining injuries 
### Viggy Venkataraman 
Earlier this week, I read what
I felt to be one of the most
intriguing headlines in re
cent memory on ESPN:
"It's not delivery: Burleson
getting free pizza!"
Intrigued, I immediately followed
the link, revealing this sordid tale of
late-night munchies and Pyrrhic victo
ry: Nate Burleson, a receiver for the
Detroit Lions, broke his left forearm
while diving to save a falling pizza box,
for which he was rewarded with a
year's supply of DiGiorno Pizza
coupons to save him the trouble of
"carrying out," in the words of the
marketing-sawy company.
Pushing aside the fact that this ar
ticle instantly made me crave pizza, I
proceeded to do a double take, then
another double take (totaling a
quadruple take), before the two
stroke scooter motor that runs my
brain began purring. Sensing a col
umn in the works, I proceeded to look
up other patently absurd spoils in
juries. The results may leave you, the
reader, in stitches or at least in as
many stitches as were dispensed to
the poor victims of these injurious
tales.
From the theater of the absurd
comes the fantastic tale of Baltimore
Ravens receiver Jacoby Jones, who
was according to reputable source
TMZ involved in an altercation
with a stripper named "Sweet Pea"
that ended with said saccharine
spherule smashing a bottle of Ace of
Spades over his head. This nutty event
apparently occurred on a party bus
rented by teammate Biyant McKin
nie for his birthday celebration. It is
worth noting that at the time of this in
cident, Jones was already recovering
from a knee injury. Just a few weeks
after this incident, McKinnie was trad
ed away to the Miami Dolphins. Take
this how you will.
Not sad enough for you? Try this
tale of woe, courtesy of Joel Przybilla,
who last played for the Milwaukee
Bucks. In 2009, he was the backup
center for the Portland Trail Blazers
(which sports an injury history that
probably deserves its own column) be
hind the durable (hardy-har) Greg
Oden, who had gone down with knee
injuries of his own.
Przybilla proceeded to rapture a
patellar tendon in his knee, which
ruled him out for the rest of the sea
son. Tb quite literally add injury to in
jury, he later slipped in the shower and
reinjured that same knee, knocking
him out for the entire offseason, as
well as the next NBA regular season.
Przybilla went on to play limited min
utes for other teams, but never with
the same intensity that he once pos
sessed.
My boss is now telling me that this
column is taking an overly somber
tone; to rectify this, I will present the
funniest non-injury injury in history:
Tim Duncan's (in)famous DNP (did
not play) from last year.
Coming off of a long road trip that
culminated in a back-to-back-to-back
against the Philadelphia 76ers, noted
humorist Greg Popovich decided to
rest many of his starters in what was
essentially a meaningless regular sea
son game. However, no one could fault
the style with which Popovich pulled
this off: On the scorer's sheet, good old
Pop listed Duncan as a "DNP - OLD."
Having planted himself firmly on
the bench, Duncan proceeded to make
himself useful in other ways name
ly, berating the refs and earning a
technical foul on a Manu Ginobili
drive. Ginobili commented after the
game, "I appreciated it. I don't think
Pop did."
The more I searched, the more
crazy injuries I uncovered. Sammy
Sosa once sneezed himself onto the
disabled list (DL) with a back injury
for three weeks. Roger Craig cut his
hand while adjusting the strap of his
wife's bra. Chase Blackburn suffered
an inner ear injury when he jammed a
Q-tip too far into his head. Tony Allen
tore his ACL after casually dunking
the ball going into a TV timeout. Felix
Pie suffered a twisted testicle in spring
training (Lou Piniella, one of the most
direct managers in history could not
bring himself to name this injury call
ing it Pie's "situation" instead). Drew
Gooden contracted an infected hair
follicle that sidelined him for weeks,
requiring an IV drip and staph-Mlling
antibiotics. Lionel Simmons, the
reigning NBA Player of the Week
back in 1991, missed a few games due
to acute wrist tendonitis brought on by
excessive use of that addictive ma
chine known as a Game Boy Color.
There is simply no way to make these
