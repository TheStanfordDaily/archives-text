# BOUNCING BACK
## WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREPS FOR A TITLE RUN 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
"This is my senior year and I'm going to make
the most of it. We know what we're capable of and
we want something better than what we had last
year'."
That's the mentality that women's head bas
ketball coach Tara VanDerveer sees from her
three seniors Chiney Ogwumike, Mikaela
Ruef and Sara James heading into the 2013-14
season. As Stanford moves further and further
away from that last 1992 national championship,
the question creeps up: How long will this win
dow of opportunity remain open to stay on top of
the pack and win another title for the program?
Ail-American, Pac-12 Player and Defensive
Player of the Year Ogwumike insists that the win
dow of opportunity to get to the Final Four is al
ways open at Stanford, due to the constant influx
of talent and the rubric for success that Van-
Derveer provides.
"Nowadays, making it to a Final Four is not
our biggest goal," Ogwumike said. "We want to
win a national championship â€”so I think our
team is thinking, 'Forget Final Four, we want to
win it all' and that's going to change our culture
and get us to that national championship caliber."
After making it to the Final Four for the pre
vious five seasons and advancing to the finals in
two of those five years, the Card was stopped
short last season by Georgia in the Sweet 16 a
disappointing end for a team that had started the
season with a victory over defending NCAA
champion Baylor and had proceeded to hold on to
the No. 1 spot for six weeks.
Last year's team, as VanDerveer pointed out,
was anticipated to be in a rebuilding year. The Card
had lost four seniors from the previous season, in
cluding All-American Nneka Ogwumike 'l2, and
had only one senior on the roster.
"Last year's team, in my mind, really over
achieved to go 33-3.... We had some tremendous
highs, but then kind of reality set in," Van-
Derveer said. "The game against Connecticut
was very disappointing, and then the loss to Cal
was veiy disappointing too, but I credit the team
to have rallied to win the Pac-12 and win the Pac
-12 Tournament."
The main theme of last year's team was the
need for greater contributions from more play
ers. All season, much of the weight of the team
was placed on the shoulders of Ogwumike par
ticularly after All-Pac-12 guard Toni Kokenis 'l4
was kept out for much of the latter part of the
schedule due to a concussion.
In her sophomore season, Ogwumike aver
aged a double-double with 15 points and 10 re
bounds per game, so the pressure and expecta
tions were deserved. But VanDerveer continual
ly emphasized the need for Stanford to move
away from such dependency in order for it to be
successful in the long ran.

Pac-12 Player of the Year and Ail-American senior forward Chiney Ogwumike (above) will lead
the Card in 2013 as it hopes to use its talented, deep roster to claim an elusive NCAA title.
Orrange, who ended the sea
son averaging 10.8 points and
four assists per game, really
stepped up and became an in
tegral part of Stanford's. She
also scored a career-high 20
points in the Pac-12 Tourna
ment championship game
and scored the game-win
ning basket with eight sec
onds remaining.
With Ogwumike in her
senior year, Orrange's confi
dence and new leadership
role on the team, the experi
ence of fifth-year senior
Mikaela Ruef and the talent
of five new freshmen, Stan
ford appears to be in good
shape to be competitive for
another year. VanDerveer,
however, will still look for
more players to step up and
make a difference through
out the season. With Koke
nis' medical retirement and
the loss of sophomore Aly
Beebe to an ACL injury,
Stanford will need to make
use of its new depth.
Several other players,
such as juniors Bonnie
Samuelson and Erica Payne,
and senior Sara James, have
been "dinged up," as Van-
Derveer put it, and have been
limited in their practice time.
"It's challenging in prac
tice when we don't have
everyone available," Van-
Derveer said. "We're just
trying to get everyone

healthy. Everyone who's
practicing, though, is playing
really well."
For Ogwumike, a sense of
urgency has surfaced in
practice as the reality of sen
ior year has sunk in. Her
main goal at the end of last
season was to prove that she
was still working and hadn't
become complacent with her
skills.
"[Going into this season] I
just wanted to improve and
show people that I am devel
oping as a player," Ogwu
mike said. "I want to be com
fortable on the perimeter
and develop my outside shot.
I want to be able to be a pass
er and facilitate offense and
not just be a one-dimensional
type of player, so I just
worked on a lot of things in
side and out and getting bet
ter with my left hand: mak
ing better reads, finding the
open person, making the
right play."
Last year's theme
needing more players to step
up still resounds in the
back of the players' minds.
Everyone is working to con
tribute in any way possible,
creating a renewed atmos
phere of determination and
competitiveness at practices,
according to VanDerveer and
some of her older players.
"I know that I have to do a
lot for our team this year,"
Samuelson said. "I'm an up
perclassman. Once I get out
there again, I'm going to look
towards being a leader and
try to help on the offensive
end. I want to look to be more
aggressive."
VanDerveer attributes
this shift in attitude to the
greater depth and experience
of this year's team. With five
freshmen added to the mix of
four returning starters (Og
wumike, Ruef, James, Or
range) and other upperclass
men, the Card is expected to
answer VanDerveer's request
for more contributions.

"We have very talented
freshmen and they're all dif
ferent and bring something
unique to our team... I think
Erica McCall is very athletic
and talented, Kailee [John
son] is a great inside-out play
er; she's tall and moves well.
Bri[ana Roberson] is light
ning fast and has a motor that
will never stop. Lili [Thomp
son] is really strong," Ogwu
mike said. "And she has great
basketball knack. Then Kar
lie [Samuelson] has got that
Samuelson shot.... These five
freshman bring so many dif
ferent things and our depth
has really just gone off the
charts."
Because of this depth, cou
pled with the continued im
provement of the returning
players motivated by the bit
ter taste of last year's Sweet
16 loss, the Card is in a good
position to go far in the
NCAA tournament and win
the Pac-12 title for a 13th con
secutive season.
To do so, the team will
have to overcome lingering
injuries, let the freshmen gain
experience and rediscover its
identity before it can experi
ence great success. Van-
Derveer pointed out that
Stanford wouldn't be the con
sensus No. 1 right out of the
gate, but will be competitive
come February and March
when it matters most.
The Card opens preseason
play this Sunday against Van
guard. Its first test early on
will be playing at UConn just
two games later, for a chance
at avenging last year's home
loss.
"I like everything I've
seen so far," VanDerveer said.
"Everyone's working hard;
it's more competitive. Last
year, not going to the Final
Four, not going to the Elite
Eight, hopefully bothers some
people."
