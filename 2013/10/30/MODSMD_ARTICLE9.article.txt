## WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREPS FOR A TITLE RUN 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
"This is my senior year and I'm going to make
the most of it. We know what we're capable of and
we want something better than what we had last
year'."
That's the mentality that women's head bas
ketball coach Tara VanDerveer sees from her
three seniors Chiney Ogwumike, Mikaela
Ruef and Sara James heading into the 2013-14
season. As Stanford moves further and further
away from that last 1992 national championship,
the question creeps up: How long will this win
dow of opportunity remain open to stay on top of
the pack and win another title for the program?
Ail-American, Pac-12 Player and Defensive
Player of the Year Ogwumike insists that the win
dow of opportunity to get to the Final Four is al
ways open at Stanford, due to the constant influx
of talent and the rubric for success that Van-
Derveer provides.
"Nowadays, making it to a Final Four is not
our biggest goal," Ogwumike said. "We want to
win a national championship â€”so I think our
team is thinking, 'Forget Final Four, we want to
win it all' and that's going to change our culture
and get us to that national championship caliber."
After making it to the Final Four for the pre
vious five seasons and advancing to the finals in
two of those five years, the Card was stopped
short last season by Georgia in the Sweet 16 a
disappointing end for a team that had started the
season with a victory over defending NCAA
champion Baylor and had proceeded to hold on to
the No. 1 spot for six weeks.
Last year's team, as VanDerveer pointed out,
was anticipated to be in a rebuilding year. The Card
had lost four seniors from the previous season, in
cluding All-American Nneka Ogwumike 'l2, and
had only one senior on the roster.
"Last year's team, in my mind, really over
achieved to go 33-3.... We had some tremendous
highs, but then kind of reality set in," Van-
Derveer said. "The game against Connecticut
was very disappointing, and then the loss to Cal
was veiy disappointing too, but I credit the team
to have rallied to win the Pac-12 and win the Pac
-12 Tournament."
The main theme of last year's team was the
need for greater contributions from more play
ers. All season, much of the weight of the team
was placed on the shoulders of Ogwumike par
ticularly after All-Pac-12 guard Toni Kokenis 'l4
was kept out for much of the latter part of the
schedule due to a concussion.
In her sophomore season, Ogwumike aver
aged a double-double with 15 points and 10 re
bounds per game, so the pressure and expecta
tions were deserved. But VanDerveer continual
ly emphasized the need for Stanford to move
away from such dependency in order for it to be
successful in the long ran.
