Alon Tal is on the faculty of Ben Gurion University's
Blaustein Institutes of Desert Research.
In this insightful and provocative book, Alon Tal provides a detailed account of
Israeli forests, tracing their history from the Bible to the present, and outlines the
effort to transform drylands and degraded soils into prosperous parks, rangelands,
and ecosystems. Tal's description of Israel's trials and errors, and his exploration of
both the environmental history and the current policy dilemmas surrounding that
country's forests, will provide valuable lessons in the years to come for other parts
of the world seeking to reestablish timberlands.
