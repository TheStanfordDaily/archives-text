## Ambassador Dennis Ross talks Israel-Palestine peace, policy at Hillel event 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD DESK EDITOR 
"If we want there to be a
peace agreement we are going
to have to change the dynamic;
we are going to have to show
that something is different this
time," said Ambassador Den
nis Ross in regard to Israel-
Palestine relations.
Ross, who served in various
national security and diplo
matic roles during the Reagan,
H.W Bush, Clinton and Oba
ma administrations, spoke to
an audience of roughly 270 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on
Wednesday night, as part of an
event series hosted by Hillel at
Stanford.
Co-president of the Stan
ford Israel Alliance, Alon El
hanan 'l4 introduced Ross and
Larry Diamond '73 MA. '7B
Ph.D. 'BO, director of the Cen
ter on Democracy, Develop
ment and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL) at Stanford, who
moderated the question and
answer session on the topics of
foreign policy discussed.
While his talk was entitled
"A Wide Angle Perspective on
a Democratic Israel," Ross in
terspersed light humor and
personal anecdotes into a
range of foreign policy topics
and international issues.
"We have not seen a period
like this sort of upheaval,"
Ross said as he traced back
through history in demon
strating that between Egypt,
Syria, Iran and the Arab-Is
raeli issue, the world has never
seen more conflict at one time.
Ross spoke specifically
about the controversial relation
ship between the United States
and Saudi A-abia, stating that
neither the United States nor
Saudi A-abia want a failed

Egyptian state, yet the Saudis
are preoccupied with eliminat
ing Iran and the Muslim Broth
erhood while American influ
ence is ebbing in Egypt.
Ross also spent time dis
cussing the possibility of a deal
with Iran regarding the roll
back of its nuclear advance
ments.
"This is not the time to be
lifting sanctions," Ross said,
further elaborating on the
threat to Israel that Iran cur
rently poses.
The second half of his lec
ture was dedicated to the
Arab-Israeli conflict. Ross ar
gued that because there is so
much going on in the Middle
East, the lack of specific focus
on the Arab-Israeli conflict
opens up a space for political
dialogue.
Moreover, he brought up
the necessity for specific com
promises from both sides, ref
erencing his own 16-point plan
to get the Middle Eastern
peace process back on track.
While he did display opti
mism regarding progress in the
future, he also acknowledged
the deep mistrust between
sides that currently hinders the
negotiation process today.
"If you're looking at the
core issues... what they are
trying to negotiate borders,
security, refugees, Jerusalem
each side stakes out the
maximal position and has no
reason to begin to solve or
even to think about creative
ways to deal with it as a long as
they disbelieve," Ross said.
"The disbelief makes it veiy
difficult to take advantage of
the context that might create a
possibility."
