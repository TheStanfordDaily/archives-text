## A 						potentially rough road to the NFL 
### Winston Shi 
Ben Gardner and Rolando
McClain are two very
good football players. I
don't know if they know
each other and I won't
pretend that they do. One of them is
in his fifth year at Stanford, will have
a college degree when he leaves and
is out for the rest of the season and an
NFL combine with a torn pectoral
muscle. The other started day one as
a true freshman at Alabama, was a
unanimous Ail-American and left col
lege in his junior year for the NFL
Draft.
Both of them should be on an
NFL team; neither of them is right
now While Gardner has the draft
ahead of him, McClain spent three
years with the Raiders before leaving
the game, realizing that his life was
going off the rails.

Rolando McClain is a microcosm
of Faulkner: "The past isn't dead, it
isn't even past." A recent profile by
ESPN shows him running away from
the past entirely. Arrested repeatedly
in his hometown, he has vowed to
never set foot in Decatur, Ala., again.
He has cut off nearly all of his child
hood friends. He chooses to live in
Tuscaloosa, Ala., near his old college
stomping grounds, a pleasant town
where everybody knows his name.
I don't mean to hold up Rolando
McClain as a cautionary tale of when
"keeping it real goes wrong;" I have
never met him. I also will not argue
that Ben Gardner is perfect, and I
doubt Gardner would either. I can
and will say, however, that the circum
stances of the two could not be more
different.
Gardner wrote after his injury,
'Although this injury will undoubted
ly make my transition to professional
football more challenging, I have nev
er been one to back down from a chal
lenge, and I like my chances. People
have doubted me for my entire career
and they will continue to do so, but I
trust that my experiences at Stanford
have put me in a position where I can
not fail."
Watching Gardner play it's clear
that the high school recruiting servic
es that awarded him just two stars
out of five were wrong: physically and
mentally, he can bang it with the best
of them. For all the uncertainty that
overshadows Gardner's return to the
field, he at least gets to see the path
he must take harrowing and diffi
cult but clearly outlined. He knows
what he needs to do; the NFL is in
sight.
Conversely, nobody knows if or
when McClain will understand what
inside him derailed his shining prom
ise— and only with understanding
comes rebirth. That takes wisdom
and perspective. Both of these things
don't come easy. For the time being,
ignoring the past may be an accept
able solution. McClain is only 24
years old and entering his prime, but
he can't sit out forever.
McClain is not entirely without
perspective; he did leave the NFL,
after all, an unthinkable decision for
most. But, despite his sabbatical, he is
not put together in the same way that
Gardner is. ESPN's Seth Wicker
sham wasn't going to pillory McClain,
but the writer took care to put a jar
ring scene of McClain's recklessness
at the piece's very end.
Once envisioned by Baltimore as
the successor to Ray Lewis, the for
mer Oakland Raiders starter agreed
to an interview in order to pave the
way for his NFL comeback. But as
the linebacker careens his truck
through the Alabama roads, texting
while driving, shunning a seatbelt,
blithely stopping in intersections and
taking shortcuts over the sidewalk,
I'm not sure he's ready to re-enter
the real world. Dwelling on this point,
Wickersham seems to agree. At the
end of the day, you wonder whether
McClain has truly learned anything
at all.

The actions McClain has taken
show awareness of his symptoms but
ultimately offer no cure. After the Al
abama standout returned to
Tuscaloosa, his old coach Nick Saban
suggested a therapist, but McClain
refused; today, McClain regretfully
explains his mistakes by saying, "Be
cause I'm me." Some NFL team will
take a chance on him anyway. Some
team always does.
Not that it makes the injury
worthwhile, but Gardner's uphill bat
tle seems more perfect. McClain is
lost, and while being lost is par for the
course, it's too typical; it's not as good
of a story and there are no convenient
ways out. Hobbled, Gardner never-

theless takes his cues from the
great soldier Daniel Daly, sure
of who he is and what he
stands for, defiantly hopeful,
shouting, "For Christ's sake
men come on! Do you want
to live forever?"
Two men will be in the
NFL someday. One is able to
play but won't for his sanity,
and one wants to play but for
the time being can't. I sincere
ly hope both of them will play
on Sundays for a long, long
time. Considering what I've

seen from the two, however, it
certainly seems that physical
scars are much less crippling
than psychological ones. The
healthy player is by his own
admission stuck in the past,
trying to find something in his
old college days that he acci
dentally left behind. The in
jured player has a sense of
who he is and where he is go
ing, and from that has all the
hope in the world.

Winston Ski is betting on
Gardner's eventual success
in the NFL and that Mc-
Clain won't read this col
umn. Let him know if he's

way for his NFL comeback. But as
the linebacker careens his truck
through the Alabama roads, texting
while driving, shunning a seatbelt,
blithely stopping in intersections and
taking shortcuts over the sidewalk,
I'm not sure he's ready to re-enter
the real world. Dwelling on this point,
Wickersham seems to agree. At the
end of the day, you wonder whether
McClain has truly learned anything
at all.

The actions McClain has taken
show awareness of his symptoms but
ultimately offer no cure. After the Al
abama standout returned to
Tuscaloosa, his old coach Nick Saban
suggested a therapist, but McClain
refused; today, McClain regretfully
explains his mistakes by saying, "Be
cause I'm me." Some NFL team will
take a chance on him anyway. Some
team always does.
Not that it makes the injury
worthwhile, but Gardner's uphill bat
tle seems more perfect. McClain is
lost, and while being lost is par for the
course, it's too typical; it's not as good
of a story and there are no convenient
ways out. Hobbled, Gardner never-

theless takes his cues from the
great soldier Daniel Daly, sure
of who he is and what he
stands for, defiantly hopeful,
shouting, "For Christ's sake
men come on! Do you want
to live forever?"
Two men will be in the
NFL someday. One is able to
play but won't for his sanity,
and one wants to play but for
the time being can't. I sincere
ly hope both of them will play
on Sundays for a long, long
time. Considering what I've

seen from the two, however, it
certainly seems that physical
scars are much less crippling
than psychological ones. The
healthy player is by his own
admission stuck in the past,
trying to find something in his
old college days that he acci
dentally left behind. The in
jured player has a sense of
who he is and where he is go
ing, and from that has all the
hope in the world.

Ben Gardner and Rolando
McClain are two very
good football players. I
don't know if they know
each other and I won't
pretend that they do. One of them is
in his fifth year at Stanford, will have
a college degree when he leaves and
is out for the rest of the season and an
NFL combine with a torn pectoral
muscle. The other started day one as
a true freshman at Alabama, was a
unanimous Ail-American and left col
lege in his junior year for the NFL
Draft.
Both of them should be on an
NFL team; neither of them is right
now While Gardner has the draft
ahead of him, McClain spent three
years with the Raiders before leaving
the game, realizing that his life was
going off the rails.

Rolando McClain is a microcosm
of Faulkner: "The past isn't dead, it
isn't even past." A recent profile by
ESPN shows him running away from
the past entirely. Arrested repeatedly
in his hometown, he has vowed to
never set foot in Decatur, Ala., again.
He has cut off nearly all of his child
hood friends. He chooses to live in
Tuscaloosa, Ala., near his old college
stomping grounds, a pleasant town
where everybody knows his name.
I don't mean to hold up Rolando
McClain as a cautionary tale of when
"keeping it real goes wrong;" I have
never met him. I also will not argue
that Ben Gardner is perfect, and I
doubt Gardner would either. I can
and will say, however, that the circum
stances of the two could not be more
different.
Gardner wrote after his injury,
'Although this injury will undoubted
ly make my transition to professional
football more challenging, I have nev
er been one to back down from a chal
lenge, and I like my chances. People
have doubted me for my entire career
and they will continue to do so, but I
trust that my experiences at Stanford
have put me in a position where I can
not fail."
Watching Gardner play it's clear
that the high school recruiting servic
es that awarded him just two stars
out of five were wrong: physically and
mentally, he can bang it with the best
of them. For all the uncertainty that
overshadows Gardner's return to the
field, he at least gets to see the path
he must take harrowing and diffi
cult but clearly outlined. He knows
what he needs to do; the NFL is in
sight.
Conversely, nobody knows if or
when McClain will understand what
inside him derailed his shining prom
ise— and only with understanding
comes rebirth. That takes wisdom
and perspective. Both of these things
don't come easy. For the time being,
ignoring the past may be an accept
able solution. McClain is only 24
years old and entering his prime, but
he can't sit out forever.
McClain is not entirely without
perspective; he did leave the NFL,
after all, an unthinkable decision for
most. But, despite his sabbatical, he is
not put together in the same way that
Gardner is. ESPN's Seth Wicker
sham wasn't going to pillory McClain,
but the writer took care to put a jar
ring scene of McClain's recklessness
at the piece's very end.
Once envisioned by Baltimore as
the successor to Ray Lewis, the for
mer Oakland Raiders starter agreed
to an interview in order to pave the
way for his NFL comeback. But as
