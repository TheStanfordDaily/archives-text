## ADJUSTING TO THE ABSENCE OF BEN GARDNER 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
The tremors from fifth-year sen
ior and defensive captain Ben Gard
ner's season-ending injury reverber
ated around the practice field this
week as a banged-up team and defen
sive line attempted to move forward
without Gardner.
"Ben's going to be out at every
practice," said head coach David Shaw
"He's still a team captain and still
wants to be a leader, so he's going to be
around and helping the guys."
Gardner's presence and coaching
on the sideline could be a massive
boost for the guys who stand to earn
more playing time in his absence.
Senior defensive end Blake Lueders,
who recently converted from outside
linebacker, figures to be one of the
key contributors at the now-vacated
starting defensive end spot.
"It's definitely different; I'm still
not completely comfortable [at defen
sive end]," Lueders said. "Being head
up on a tackle and having the possi
bility of a tight end blocking you or
the tackle or the guard, it can be a lit
tle different from outside linebacker
... It's definitely been a transition, but
the more practices I've had, the more
comfortable I've been getting."
Although it will be difficult to
replicate Gardner's performance on
the field, the Card hopes that Lued
ers, along with sophomore defensive
end Luke Kaumatule, who was re
cently converted from tight end, and
several other players, can use the in
creased playing time to showcase
their own skills.
"Luke Kaumatule has a lot of po
tential. The sky's really the limit for
him," Lueders said. "It's a tough tran
sition for him, switching ft'om tight
end to defensive line, having to learn a
whole new playbook and different
techniques. He's really come a long
way and I think he will contribute
more and more this season."
Kaumatule is just one of the
younger players who has made an

impact in practice and could begin to
see more of the field. Other sopho
more standouts have included wide
receiver Kodi Whitfield, running
back Barry Sanders and defensive
end Jordan Watkins.
Shaw said Sanders had a very
good day at practice Tfiesday and
that Watkins was progressing very
well. Shaw did say, however, that he
wasn't sure if Watkins had quite
reached a point where he was ready
to contribute in a game yet.
Whitfield's emergence and the
possible return of injured junior wide
receiver Devon Cajuste would really
help an offense that straggled mov
ing and controlling possession of the

football last Saturday against Oregon
State. The Cardinal only had the ball
for around 22 minutes during the
game.
"[We need to] get first downs and
move the chains," said junior quar
terback Kevin Hogan. "We need to
be efficient on first and second downs
to stay out of third-and-long situa
tions."
One of the lasting memories from
last year's matchup with Oregon was
Hogan scrambling, diving and
stretching for the end zone for a
touchdown that put the Cardinal up
7-0 in the second quarter. This year
Hogan again plans to run, if given the
chance.

"If the opportunity is there 111
definitely use my legs," Hogan said.
"I think that is something that has
worked well the past couple weeks
getting an extra couple of yards on
scrambles. Oregon flies around [up
front] and covers well downfield, so if
the opportunity is there I'll use my
legs."
Stanford and Oregon will meet on
Thursday, Nov. 7, at 6 p.m. in a
matchup with major Pac-12 Champi
onship Game implications and even
possible BCS National Champi
onship Game implications.

senior captain Ben Gardner. Lueders was recently converted from outside linebacker to help add depth.
