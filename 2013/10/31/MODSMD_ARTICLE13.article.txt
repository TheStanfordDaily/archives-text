## Five-set loss ends reign over Troy 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The last time that Stanford
women's volleyball lost a home
match was in 2011, the last time
USC took a set from Stanford at
Maples was in 2009 and the last
time that USC took a match on
Stanford's home court was in 2006.

That all ended last night as the
No. 6 Cardinal (15-5, 8-3 Pac-12)
fell to No. 4 USC (19-3, 9-2) in a

five-set thriller (16-25, 25-23, 25-
18, 22-25,15-9).
"I'm angry because I didn't
think it had to end up this way," said
head coach John Dunning. "I have a
lot of belief and confidence in our
team. I'm going to have to get over
the anger part of it I guess."
Stanford was led by the sopho
more duo of outside hitters Brit
tany Howard and Jordan Burgess,
who each tallied double-doubles in
the loss. Burgess finished the
game with 17 kills and 25 digs,
while Howard finished with 17 kills
and 16 digs.
Stanford scored the first point
of the match and maintained the
lead and momentum throughout,

winning 25-16. The Card out hit
the Trojans .516 to .128 to make a
big statement in the opening set, in
contrast to the shutout it experi
enced at USC earlier in the season.
The second set was a more even
trade off in points. USC led the set
only once at 4-3 before Stanford
went on a run and stretched the
lead to as many as five points at 23-
18. However, USC gained momen
tum off of two Stanford mistakes
an attack error and a bad set
to go on a 7-0 run to seize the set
and all of the momentum heading
into the halftime break. This time
USC outhit the Card .222 to .164,
and the Trojans would continue to
have a higher attack percentage

throughout the rest of the match.
"[USC is] really good when it
gets down to it," Dunning said.
"We didn't handle the situation in
the end there and that's a tough
break for us. We worked really
hard in the [second set] and they
took it away from us there."
Stanford came out of the inter
mission and got the first point, but
USC maintained a one- to two
point lead for the majority of the
set. Both teams played aggressive
ly and with high intensity, but Stan
ford wasn't able to finish out as
many of the points and lost 25-18.
Down two sets to one, it was up

W. VOLLEYBALL
USC 3
STANFORD 2
10/30, Maples Pavilion
to Stanford to make the ad
justments, improve its block
ing and rely upon the consis
tency of senior middle block
er Carly Wopat.
USC took the first point
of the set and was quickly
answered with a block from
sophomore Inky Ajanaku.
USC managed to find suc
cess and pull ahead with
quick sets and quick hits,
forcing Stanford to keep
playing from behind and
having to inch back. The
Card kept the USC lead
small at four for the most
part and even closed the gap
to two points at 20-18 after a
kill from Howard and a USC
attack error. Stanford con
tinued the run to tie the
game at 20 before a kill from
Howard gave Stanford its
first lead of the game and
created a huge momentum
shift. Stanford battled to win
the set point and force the
fifth set, 25-22.
"They played better and
put us in a position where we
had to fight back. And we
did," Dunning said. "We
could've easily folded up in
game four. We've been there
before. We were there in
Washington. And we didn't.
It's just not in [the team] to do
that."
Stanford earned the first
two points of the fifth set but
USC answered right back
with four of its own. The

Card tried to fire down the
middle coming out of its
timeout, but the USC block
ers were ready. It became
very much the same situa
tion as past two sets with
Stanford starting to trail
early, 8-5. A kill from
Burgess and block from
Ajanaku reduced the lead to
one. However, the next two

USC kills went unblocked
and USC took the lead 11-8
en route to a 15-9 set victory.
"I think there's a lot of
different places where we
have to get better," Burgess
said. "We're kind of at a
point in the season where
you have to realize: We've
worked as hard as we can for
the past 10 months since last

season to get to this point,
and we only have a month
and a half left.... It's time to
kick it into high gear."
The Card will now try to
regroup before it hosts
UCLA at Maples Pavilion
Friday at 8 p.m.

Sophomore outside hitter Brittany Howard (right) picked up a double-double, but the
performance wasn't enough to rally the Cardinal to victory. The Trojans held off a late
Cardinal rally to beat Stanford at Maples Pavilion for the first time since 2006 in five sets.
