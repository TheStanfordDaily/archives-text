## Five-set loss ends reign over Troy 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The last time that Stanford
women's volleyball lost a home
match was in 2011, the last time
USC took a set from Stanford at
Maples was in 2009 and the last
time that USC took a match on
Stanford's home court was in 2006.

That all ended last night as the
No. 6 Cardinal (15-5, 8-3 Pac-12)
fell to No. 4 USC (19-3, 9-2) in a

five-set thriller (16-25, 25-23, 25-
18, 22-25,15-9).
"I'm angry because I didn't
think it had to end up this way," said
head coach John Dunning. "I have a
lot of belief and confidence in our
team. I'm going to have to get over
the anger part of it I guess."
Stanford was led by the sopho
more duo of outside hitters Brit
tany Howard and Jordan Burgess,
who each tallied double-doubles in
the loss. Burgess finished the
game with 17 kills and 25 digs,
while Howard finished with 17 kills
and 16 digs.
Stanford scored the first point
of the match and maintained the
lead and momentum throughout,

winning 25-16. The Card out hit
the Trojans .516 to .128 to make a
big statement in the opening set, in
contrast to the shutout it experi
enced at USC earlier in the season.
The second set was a more even
trade off in points. USC led the set
only once at 4-3 before Stanford
went on a run and stretched the
lead to as many as five points at 23-
18. However, USC gained momen
tum off of two Stanford mistakes
an attack error and a bad set
to go on a 7-0 run to seize the set
and all of the momentum heading
into the halftime break. This time
USC outhit the Card .222 to .164,
and the Trojans would continue to
have a higher attack percentage

throughout the rest of the match.
"[USC is] really good when it
gets down to it," Dunning said.
"We didn't handle the situation in
the end there and that's a tough
break for us. We worked really
hard in the [second set] and they
took it away from us there."
Stanford came out of the inter
mission and got the first point, but
USC maintained a one- to two
point lead for the majority of the
set. Both teams played aggressive
ly and with high intensity, but Stan
ford wasn't able to finish out as
many of the points and lost 25-18.
Down two sets to one, it was up
