# FINAL AWAY MATCHES AWAIT
## 
### FIONA NOONAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the regular season draws to
a close, the No. 7 Cardinal
women's soccer team (12-3-1,5-3-
0 Pac-12) heads back on the road
to play its final away matches
against Washington (7-6-4, 3-1-4
Pac-12) and Washington State
(11-3-3,4-3-1).
The two matches will be huge
for Stanford, as the women look
to extend their victorious streak
to five and clinch a spot in the
NCAA tournament.
First up are the Huskies, who
are coming off of two consecutive
road ties against Arizona and Ari
zona State. Washington is cur
rently tied for fourth place in the
Pac-12, placing them just two
points behind Stanford, who
launched back up to second place
after road wins against Oregon
and Oregon State last weekend.
Washington is also within
sight of an NCAA Tournament
berth; so the Cardinal, which
holds a 20-2-2 series advantage,
will certainly be in for a challenge.
The Huskies' defense, anchored
by former Pac-12 Defensive Play
er of the Week goalkeeper Megan
Kufeld, has allowed just five goals
against conference teams, so
Stanford will need to rely on

strong offensive play to find suc
cess.
Stanford's junior forward
Chioma Übogagu may once again
be the key to the top.
Übogagu's high-intensity at
tacking style has resulted in one
goal, two assists and one shot at
tempt that led to a goal in the last
three games. On Monday, she was
named Pac-12 Player of the Week
for her dominant performances in
the Card's last three victories.
The game against Washington
State may also prove difficult, as
the Cougars will be looking to se
cure their own spot in the post
season tournament. The Cougars,
who are also tied for fourth in the
Pac-12, will be in their second of
two tough consecutive matches.
They play Cal on Friday before
facing Stanford Sunday morning
to round out their home schedule.
Though Stanford has an all
time series advantage of 19-2-1
over Washington State, Pullman,
Wash., has often been a tough
place to play for the Cardinal.
Those problems may be magni
fied by what is sure to be a large
crowd drawn in by Senior Day.
Regardless of the conditions,
Stanford will continue to focus on
keeping up the high energy it dis-
