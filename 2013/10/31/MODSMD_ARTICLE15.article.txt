## OP-ED Radical to Constructive: A Vision for Pro-Palestinian Advocacy Reform 
### ARIELLA AXLER '15 
The notion that Palestine and
Israel are mutually exclusive
has become the norm in the
political spheres of many college
campuses. Once again, this past
weekend's National Students for
Justice in Palestine (SJP) confer
ence, hosted on the Stanford cam
pus, exhibited the hardline nature
of such groups.
The closed conference, with only
three sessions open to the public, is
in and of itself a sign of the move
ment's aversion to dialogue. I am an
avid supporter of Israel who enthu
siastically endorses the official es
tablishment and strengthening of a
Palestinian state.
It is disappointing that the advo
cacy messages of the National SJP
conference preach the opposite of
respect and tolerance by focusing
on blaming and delegitimizing Is
rael and the nation's support from
America, its strongest ally.
It is unfortunate how the confer
ence and the key messages of "pro-
Palestinian" campus groups, rather
than emphasizing topics of Palestin
ian state-building, position them
selves as hateful, anti-Israel cadres.
The theme of the National SJP
conference, from "Margin to Cen
ter," will have no concrete implica
tions without a systemic change of
pro-Palestinian advocacy. The
Palestinian issue has been margin
alized on this campus, and on cam
puses nationally, because the
groups position themselves as ex
tremist, anti-Israel and anti-Zionist
haters.
And, despite the Jewish mem
bers of SJP who hold themselves as
testimony that the movement is not
against Judaism, anti-Zionism is a
contemporary manifestation of an
ti-Semitism.
The radical nature of the Na
tional SJP conference is shaped by
the historical affiliations and ac
tions of the organization. Last year,
the Electronic Intifada endorsed
the National SJP conference on its
site, and the group has previously
placed eviction notices on the doors
of Jewish students.
Students for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER) is not an official
chapter of Students for Justice in
Palestine, but by sponsoring this
conference, SPER dug themselves
into a deeper hole of extremism.
The concentration of the Nation
al SJP conference on Boycott Di
vestment Sanctions (BDS) goals
epitomizes the hostile nature of the
Palestinian student groups on col
lege campuses. Masking itself as a
form of "non-violent" protest, the
fundamental idea of BDS that sup
porting one's community means
subverting another's is the opposite
of peaceful, conciliatory action.
It is important to highlight the
positive, constructive aspects of the
National SJP conference, such as
the cultural and educational activi
ties during the weekend. For exam
ple, "Raise the Keffiyeh: Celebrat
ing a Night of Palestinian Culture,"
was an arts event open to the pub
lic.
Promoting positive messages
about Palestinian culture motivates
more involvement in learning about
the vibrancy of the nation. As well,
an internal conference session con
ducted about combating Islamopho-

bia has relevant applications to ex
posing distorted rhetoric in the na
tional security sphere. Identifying
specific aspects for political reform
is much more effective than the
generalized campaign of SJP that
inevitably makes tangible accom
plishment more difficult.
In seeking to bridge together the
struggles of many communities,
SJP generates a polarized, victim
aggressor dialogue a strategy
that counter-productively dismisses
the accountability of a "victim."
Firstly, the horrifyingly erro
neousness parallels SJP draws be
tween the conditions in Palestine,
Apartheid in South Africa and seg
regation in the United States disre
gard the complexity of these
tragedies.
Yet, even for those who see utili
ty in bridging the struggles of the
underdog, the "f-k The Man" ap
proach is not effective for promot
ing progress in Palestine. Israel
ending the condemned "occupa
tion" will not solve the problem of
intense rift in the Palestinian gov
ernment between Hamas and the
PA, dysfunction of leadership due to
years of intense corruption under
Arafat, and the dire impoverish
ment of the Palestinian people who
have had no capable authority to
develop the economy or build socie
tal infrastructure.
Unfortunately, the past leaders
of the Palestinian nation, like the
SJP movement, have spent too
much of their energy finger-point
ing at Israel rather than focusing on
creating their own prosperity
The way in which the strength
ening of Palestine on college cam
puses hinges on the weakening of
Israel reflects a distorted message
about the reality of peace creation
between Israel and Palestine.
Development of a strong, flour
ishing Palestinian state, accepting
of and in peace with Israel, is one of
the greatest hopes of many contem
porary Israelis.
A pro-Palestinian movement
that redirects its efforts from fight
ing against Israel to focusing on
Palestinian leadership reform and
economic development would not
just move from the margins to the
center, but would actually have a
tangible impact.

The closed
conference... is in
and of itself a
sign of the
movement's
aversion to
dialogue
