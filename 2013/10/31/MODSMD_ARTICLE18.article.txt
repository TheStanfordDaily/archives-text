# CONTRARIAN
## Coming Out of the Conservative Closet 
### Alli Rath 
I distinctly remember when I
came out to my dormmate dur
ing freshman year. "I I sup
pose, really, I guess I'm conserva
tive," I stammered.
My friend's eyes widened, and
she looked quickly over both shoul
ders as if to make sure no one else
was around. She then promptly
launched herself into my arms
squealing, "ME TOO!!"
The instant camaraderie we felt
from having found a fellow conser
vative-minded student likely
stemmed from the staggering lack
of "out" conservatives at Stanford.
I choose the word conservative
quite deliberately, because I am
aware that connecting myself to the
word "Republican" could elicit a re
sponse akin to admitting that I skin
puppies on the weekend. Many peo
ple who self-identify as Democrats
actually have views that encompass
aspects of both parties, but as there

is no stigma against Democrats
here, one can safely self-identify as
such.
Since I cannot identify with the
party I voted for in the last election
without receiving instant judgment
from many of my peers, I am most
likely to call myself a libertarian,
despite the fact that a libertarian,
unfortunately, has little chance of
winning the presidency in the near
future.
Like many young conservatives
and more and more Americans (22
percent of the nation identifies as
Libertarian), I have socially liberal
views on issues such as gay mar
riage and abortion, but a candidate
whose beliefs align both socially and
fiscally with mine has yet to
emerge.
I know that I am not the only
conservative student at Stanford
who feels the same pressure to con
ceal, downplay or refuse to even

broach the topic of my personal po
litical beliefs. Tired of receiving the
same raised eyebrows, barely hid
den scoffs and general condescen
sion, we with the exception of a
few brave (sadistic?) souls have
just decided that it is in our best in
terests to shut up most of the time.
I have witnessed students I
know to be conservative do every
thing possible to avoid discussing
them political beliefs. If issues of
voting come up, it usually takes the
other student three or four passes
to weasel any concrete statements
that could be tied to the conserva
tive candidate, movement or the
Republican Party.
I hate feeling ashamed of my be
liefs here, but being the only dis
senting opinion in the room can be
deadening at times.
I am not ashamed of my beliefs;
I am genuinely convinced that the
worst possible political develop
ments in terms of both domestic
and international ramifications are
further increasing debt and deficit,
larger government and less empha
sis on state government and free
enterprise.
Just because I hold these beliefs
and have chosen to base my vote up
on them does not mean I am an an
ti-feminist bent on robbing women
of their rights; it does not mean I
have weekly beers with my best
friend Todd Aiken; and it certainly
does not mean that I support all of
the actions of the Republican Party.
It actually does not even mean
that I hold starkly different views
from a majority of the Stanford
community. In writing this article, I
hope to encourage some of my fel
low students to stop mentally link
ing the word "conservative" with
"out of touch," "ignorant," "sexist"
or "racist."
These associations can often be
presumptuous and hateful and only
serve to halt what could be lively
debates that have the potential to
inform students on both sides of the
political spectrum.
And don't worry; I'll continue
doing my best to not assume that
all liberals are idiots.

liefs here, but being the only dis
senting opinion in the room can be
deadening at times.
I am not ashamed of my beliefs;
I am genuinely convinced that the
worst possible political develop
ments in terms of both domestic
and international ramifications are
further increasing debt and deficit,
larger government and less empha
sis on state government and free
enterprise.
Just because I hold these beliefs
and have chosen to base my vote up
on them does not mean I am an an
ti-feminist bent on robbing women
of their rights; it does not mean I
have weekly beers with my best
friend Todd Aiken; and it certainly
does not mean that I support all of
the actions of the Republican Party.
It actually does not even mean
that I hold starkly different views
from a majority of the Stanford
community. In writing this article, I
hope to encourage some of my fel
low students to stop mentally link
ing the word "conservative" with
"out of touch," "ignorant," "sexist"
or "racist."
These associations can often be
presumptuous and hateful and only
serve to halt what could be lively
debates that have the potential to
inform students on both sides of the
political spectrum.
And don't worry; I'll continue
doing my best to not assume that
all liberals are idiots.
