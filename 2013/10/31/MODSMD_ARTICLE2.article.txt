# SPECIAL TEAM SHARKS
## HOW STANFORD ALWAYS FINDS THE "BEST 11" 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
It's fourth down. The Stanford de
fense has just forced another
punt; the Cardinal's opponent,
however, has no time to use the
brief special teams interlude to
catch its breath. The Sharks are coming,
and they always smell blood.
Just ask Arizona State.
In their Sept. 21 matchup with the
Sun Devils, the Sharks, Stanford's punt
return unit, got to Arizona State's Matt
Haack for a blocked punt that resulted
in a safety, capping off a near-perfect
first half for the Cardinal.
Ultimately, much of the tremendous
success of the Sharks, who have allowed
an average of just under four return
yards per punt, can be traced back to the
unit's front line, which features a host of
very recognizable names, including line
backers Shayne Skov and A. J. Tarpley.
While some successful college foot
ball programs, such as Alabama's, use
special teams primarily as a breeding
ground to cultivate the talents of young,
highly touted recruits, Stanford and
head coach David Shaw adhere to the
same guiding philosophy governing the
other two phases of the game; "We're
going to put the best 11 out there."

However, the exact special teams for
mula is not quite so simple. While Shaw
and special teams coordinator Pete Ala
mar utilize many offensive and defensive
stars on special teams units, they also
recognize that using special teams pro
vides a unique opportunity to give
younger players the chance to earn valu
able game experience early in their ca
reers.
While there may appear to be an in
herent conflict between putting the
"best 11" on the field versus giving
younger players an opportunity to shine,
Alamar notes that Stanford has devel
oped a system to balance the two goals.
In particular, the coaching staff uses a
core group of two or three veteran star
players as anchors on each special teams
unit; then the coaches fill in the remain
ing spots with younger players, who are
typically athletic enough to see the field,
but may not have a full grasp of the Car

dinal's complex offensive and defensive
schemes quite yet.
"The balance is to find the best 11
you possibly can knowing that you're go
ing to use your starters in moderation.
You're going to plug in the best players
at those spots that you can.... You know
you've got these two or three guys that
you're going to build around and who are
the best guys now that you can put in the
other spots."
Currently, freshman wide receiver
Francis Owusu perfectly fits Stanford's
special teams mold. Although Owusu has
only seen a handful of snaps on offense,
he has seen significant action on the kick
off coverage team, notching a couple cru
cial tackles against Washington. Owusu's
presence on kickoff coverage, a unit that
has featured many established stars this
season, including outside linebacker
