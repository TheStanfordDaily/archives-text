# SPECIAL TEAM SHARKS
## HOW STANFORD ALWAYS FINDS THE "BEST 11" 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
It's fourth down. The Stanford de
fense has just forced another
punt; the Cardinal's opponent,
however, has no time to use the
brief special teams interlude to
catch its breath. The Sharks are coming,
and they always smell blood.
Just ask Arizona State.
In their Sept. 21 matchup with the
Sun Devils, the Sharks, Stanford's punt
return unit, got to Arizona State's Matt
Haack for a blocked punt that resulted
in a safety, capping off a near-perfect
first half for the Cardinal.
Ultimately, much of the tremendous
success of the Sharks, who have allowed
an average of just under four return
yards per punt, can be traced back to the
unit's front line, which features a host of
very recognizable names, including line
backers Shayne Skov and A. J. Tarpley.
While some successful college foot
ball programs, such as Alabama's, use
special teams primarily as a breeding
ground to cultivate the talents of young,
highly touted recruits, Stanford and
head coach David Shaw adhere to the
same guiding philosophy governing the
other two phases of the game; "We're
going to put the best 11 out there."

However, the exact special teams for
mula is not quite so simple. While Shaw
and special teams coordinator Pete Ala
mar utilize many offensive and defensive
stars on special teams units, they also
recognize that using special teams pro
vides a unique opportunity to give
younger players the chance to earn valu
able game experience early in their ca
reers.
While there may appear to be an in
herent conflict between putting the
"best 11" on the field versus giving
younger players an opportunity to shine,
Alamar notes that Stanford has devel
oped a system to balance the two goals.
In particular, the coaching staff uses a
core group of two or three veteran star
players as anchors on each special teams
unit; then the coaches fill in the remain
ing spots with younger players, who are
typically athletic enough to see the field,
but may not have a full grasp of the Car

dinal's complex offensive and defensive
schemes quite yet.
"The balance is to find the best 11
you possibly can knowing that you're go
ing to use your starters in moderation.
You're going to plug in the best players
at those spots that you can.... You know
you've got these two or three guys that
you're going to build around and who are
the best guys now that you can put in the
other spots."
Currently, freshman wide receiver
Francis Owusu perfectly fits Stanford's
special teams mold. Although Owusu has
only seen a handful of snaps on offense,
he has seen significant action on the kick
off coverage team, notching a couple cru
cial tackles against Washington. Owusu's
presence on kickoff coverage, a unit that
has featured many established stars this
season, including outside linebacker

Junior nickelback and special teams standout Ronnie Harris (left) favors playing
with the punt coverage unit, which has only given up 6.7 yards per return.
Players say they love playing on special teams as much as offense or defense.
Trent Murphy, illustrates one of the
major outcomes of Stanford's spe
cial teams philosophy: the mixing of
younger players, older players and
everything in-between.
Furthermore, Shaw notes that
the presence of veteran stars on
special teams serves not only to an
chor the individual units, but also
to build players' NFL resumes.
"It helps them on the next level.
One of the questions the scouts ask
is, 'Has he played on special
teams?"' Shaw said. "Usually those
first couple years in the NFL,
that's where you start, too."
Shaw also added that he doesn't
maintain any concerns that putting
his best players on the field for an
additional number of plays will in
crease the chances of injury.
"Football is football," Shaw
said. "We put them out there and
let them play."
However, Shaw did note that he
would step in if he were to notice
that his players were fatigued. To
that end, he and Alamar decided to
take Skov off of the kickoff cover
age unit a few weeks ago to avoid
overextending the star linebacker.
Moreover, much of Stanford's
special teams' success this season
stems from the ability of Shaw and
his staff to instill a strong under
standing of the tremendous value
of special teams in them players.
"Special teams is just as big as
offense and defense," said junior
wide receiver and kickoff returner
Ty Montgomery. "As you see from
the Washington game, getting
points on special teams or big
changes in field position is huge
and it can really change the game."
Montgomery's performance re
turning kickoffs accounted for
much of the team's game-changing
special teams plays against the
Huskies. On the season, Mont
gomery, with the aid of a talented
cast of blockers on the kickoff re
turn contingent, has already tallied
a nation-leading 683 yards on kick
off returns with two touchdowns.
"We're a very passionate group.
We take special teams just as seri
ously as offense and defense," said
junior nickelback and special
teams star Ronnie Harris. "It's a
mentality. We love special teams
just as much as we love offense and
defense."
Above all, the success of the Stan
ford special teams units this season
ultimately boils down to the attitudes
of individual players who have em
braced the third phase of the game.

"We pride ourselves on [special
teams]," said fifth-year senior line
backer Jarek Lancaster. "If we're
called, we want to be the person
who makes the play or does the
sweet block that springs it."
This season, Lancaster has
used his passion for special teams
to emerge as the leader of a core
group of players who do not start
on offense and defense but regular
ly make game-altering plays as
members of various special teams
units. Other members of this crew
of special teams leaders include
Harris, senior linebacker Joe
Hemschoot and fifth-year senior
nickelback Usua Amanam.
Harris, who has dazzled this
season on the punt coverage unit,
echoed Lancaster's remarks on the
role of special teams.
"We're a very passionate group.
We take special teams just as seri
ously as offense and defense," Har
ris said. "It's a mentality. We love
special teams just as much as we
love offense and defense."
Harris also added that punt
coverage is his favorite unit to play
on because of the great chemistry
he has developed with his team
mates on the unit, particularly
punter Ben Rhyne. In fact, Harris,
Rhyne and several other players
often spend time after practice
perfecting their timing on punt
coverage.
Without a doubt, Stanford's
special teamers have made a cru
cial difference in every game this
season. From directly affecting the
final score, to providing the stars of
tomorrow with valuable playing
time, to instilling invaluable team
chemistry and passion, the word
"special" certainly fits the bill. If
the old sports cliche, "Offense sells
tickets, but defense wins champi
onships," bears any truth, then
special teams might be the key to
building dynasties. If this season is
any indication, the Stanford foot
ball program is well on its way.
