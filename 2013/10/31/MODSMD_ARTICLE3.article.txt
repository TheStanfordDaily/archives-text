## Senators get $3k each for new initiatives 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
The 15th Undergraduate Senate re
cently announced the launch of its new
Senate Innovation Fund that will allocate
$3,000 to each senator who will then decide
how he or she wishes to spend it through
out the year.
The budget for this fund is $52,000, said
the bill's author, Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6.
Mouzykantskii explained that in the
past, senators have felt a need for mone

tary funds to follow through on promises
or plans that they made during their cam
paigns.
"Once you get to the Senate you realize
there are a lot of checks and balances and
processes in place that restrict access to
cash," he said. "We feel as a Senate, we can
afford to allocate a really small amount of
the funds that we have sitting in reserves
to allow senators to effect change in the
way that they personally feel is appropri
ate."
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4, assis

tant financial manager for the ASSU,
shared similar thoughts.
"Sometimes in a collective body, an indi
vidual's idea or passion can get lost and
this program is one way of changing that,"
said Trusheim, who originally proposed the
idea in early October.
Mouzykantskii along with senators
Nikos Liodakis 'l6 and Ryan Matsumoto
'l6 sits on the ad-hoc Senate Innovation
Fund committee, which will monitor reim-
bursements by a senator re
questing money from the
fund.
Of the $52,000 fund,
Mouzykantskii said he ex
pects half to be spent this
year.
"I don't expect each sena
tor to take advantage of the
allocation," Mouzykantskii
said.
But, for those that do take
advantage of the fund, there
are some limits on how they
can spend their allocation.
"We want the money to be
spent in away that creates a
meaningful difference to the
undergraduate community,"
Mouzykantskii said. "Giving
it to yourself is not a mean

ingful difference to the com
munity."
Students are also encour
aged to approach the Senate
with ideas they may have for
using a senator's allocation,
Mouzykantskii said.
"Send an email to us, pitch
an idea at us and I bet you
one of the 14 senators will
pick it up and run with it," he
said. "We really want to en
courage innovation and cre
ativity on campus."
Mouzykantskii said this
could be in the form of web
services that would help stu
dent life, new publications or
events that students want to
host.
Some students have al
ready expressed ideas for
which they would like to use
the funding. Julia Quintero
'l5, president of the Stanford
Pre-Education Society
(SPREES), said she was hop

ing her student group could
utilize the funds to create a
resource center for students
interested in education or to
bring in speakers.
"I think it will be really ef
fective," she said. "We can
trust [the senators'] judg
ments to identify projects
that will be highly effective
and influential for Stanford
undergrads."
Natasha Patel 'l6, spon
sor for the bill, said that this
year the new fund would be a
trial run.
"We don't have plans to
make this something that
happens every year," she
said. "The idea is that if this
is a success ... the senators
next year should consider
forging a path similar to
what we've done."
