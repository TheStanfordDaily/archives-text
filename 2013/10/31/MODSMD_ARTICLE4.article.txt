### HAROON ZAIDI 
Stanford administrators and students are
looking to the new Schwarzman Scholars pro
gram as an opportunity for graduate students
to take part in fostering a stronger U.S.-Chi
na relationship.
The international scholarship, offered by
Blackstone Co-Founder Stephen Schwarz
man, will allow 200 students â€”45 percent
from the United States, 20 percent from Chi
na, and 35 percent from the rest of the world
to work towards a one-year master degree
at the Schwarzman College within China's Ts
inghua University in 2016.
Current courses of study proposed for the
program cover topics such as international re
lations, public policy and economics, and
there are future plans to incorporate engi
neering and other fields in later stage.
"My vision for Schwarzman Scholars is to
help educate a future class of leaders who will
advance relationships of mutual respect be
tween the West and China, reducing tensions
and leading to a new era of mutual prosperi
ty," Schwarzman said in a press release.
While the program is still at its inception,
