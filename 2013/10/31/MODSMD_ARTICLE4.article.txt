## Schwarzman grant draws campus interest 
### HAROON ZAIDI 
Stanford administrators and students are
looking to the new Schwarzman Scholars pro
gram as an opportunity for graduate students
to take part in fostering a stronger U.S.-Chi
na relationship.
The international scholarship, offered by
Blackstone Co-Founder Stephen Schwarz
man, will allow 200 students —45 percent
from the United States, 20 percent from Chi
na, and 35 percent from the rest of the world
to work towards a one-year master degree
at the Schwarzman College within China's Ts
inghua University in 2016.
Current courses of study proposed for the
program cover topics such as international re
lations, public policy and economics, and
there are future plans to incorporate engi
neering and other fields in later stage.
"My vision for Schwarzman Scholars is to
help educate a future class of leaders who will
advance relationships of mutual respect be
tween the West and China, reducing tensions
and leading to a new era of mutual prosperi
ty," Schwarzman said in a press release.

The Schwarzman Scholars program, offered by Blackstone co-founder Stephen
Schwarzman, will allow graduate students to pursue a one-year master's program
at Tsinghua University in China to improve U.S.-China relations through education.
it has garnered a great
amount of media and Stan
ford faculty attention.
Condoleezza Rice, former
secretary of state and cur
rent professor in the Gradu
ate School of Business and
senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, and Jean Oi, pro
fessor in Chinese politics, will
both serve on the program's
board of advisors.
Xueguang Zhou M.A.'B5
Ph.D. '9l, Stanford professor
in economic development and
senior fellow at the Freeman
Spogli Institute for Interna
tional Studies, said that the
choice of Tsinghua Universi
ty for the program campus
has several implications.
"Tsinghua University was
originally set up as a prep
school for Chinese students
to go abroad to study in the
U. 5.," Zhou said. "Now be
cause of the Schwarzman
grant, [it is also] for others to
come to China... That change
and rhythm is quite interest
ing."
According to Zhou, the in
creasing co-dependence be
tween China and the rest of
the world has set the stage
for such a program.
"China is becoming more
and more integrated with the
rest of the world," Zhou
added, hoping that the pro
gram will serve as a channel
for student scholars and fu
ture leaders to become more
familiar with China.
John Pearson, director of
the Bechtel International
Center, said that the pro
gram, even in its inception
stages, promises two levels of
benefits. On the one hand,
Pearson sees an opportunity
for a group to get to know
Chinese society, culture and
people.
"The other benefit is the
benefit to these individual

students' academic and pro
fessional goals by studying
their subjects in a very dif
ferent academic setting in a
different country, which will
give them perspectives from
a country which is increas
ingly important for the
world," Pearson said.
"I can't imagine Stanford
students in the next few
years will not be interested in
it," he added.
In fact, some students
have already expressed in
terest in the program.
"For me, I think I will def
initely look into the program
after I graduate," said An
drea Wang 'l6, who is also in
volved in the Forum for
American/Chinese Exchange
at Stanford (FACES).
"I think this program will
attract a lot of students with
a special interest in China,
and it will also attract a lot of
students who want to make
an impact in the future with
the fact in mind that China is,
indeed, one of the most im
portant economies in the
world," Wang added.
While construction on the
Schwarzman College site will
not be completed until spring
2016, applications we be ac
cepted stalling fall 2015.

fessor in Chinese politics, will
both serve on the program's
board of advisors.
Xueguang Zhou M.A.'B5
Ph.D. '9l, Stanford professor
in economic development and
senior fellow at the Freeman
Spogli Institute for Interna
tional Studies, said that the
choice of Tsinghua Universi
ty for the program campus
has several implications.
"Tsinghua University was
originally set up as a prep
school for Chinese students
to go abroad to study in the
U. 5.," Zhou said. "Now be
cause of the Schwarzman
grant, [it is also] for others to
come to China... That change
and rhythm is quite interest
ing."
According to Zhou, the in
creasing co-dependence be
tween China and the rest of
the world has set the stage
for such a program.
"China is becoming more
and more integrated with the
rest of the world," Zhou
added, hoping that the pro
gram will serve as a channel
for student scholars and fu
ture leaders to become more
familiar with China.
John Pearson, director of
the Bechtel International
Center, said that the pro
gram, even in its inception
stages, promises two levels of
benefits. On the one hand,
Pearson sees an opportunity
for a group to get to know
Chinese society, culture and
people.
"The other benefit is the
benefit to these individual

students' academic and pro
fessional goals by studying
their subjects in a very dif
ferent academic setting in a
different country, which will
give them perspectives from
a country which is increas
ingly important for the
world," Pearson said.
"I can't imagine Stanford
students in the next few
years will not be interested in
it," he added.
In fact, some students
have already expressed in
terest in the program.
"For me, I think I will def
initely look into the program
after I graduate," said An
drea Wang 'l6, who is also in
volved in the Forum for
American/Chinese Exchange
at Stanford (FACES).
"I think this program will
attract a lot of students with
a special interest in China,
and it will also attract a lot of
students who want to make
an impact in the future with
the fact in mind that China is,
indeed, one of the most im
portant economies in the
world," Wang added.
While construction on the
Schwarzman College site will
not be completed until spring
2016, applications we be ac
cepted stalling fall 2015.

Stanford administrators and students are
looking to the new Schwarzman Scholars pro
gram as an opportunity for graduate students
to take part in fostering a stronger U.S.-Chi
na relationship.
The international scholarship, offered by
Blackstone Co-Founder Stephen Schwarz
man, will allow 200 students —45 percent
from the United States, 20 percent from Chi
na, and 35 percent from the rest of the world
to work towards a one-year master degree
at the Schwarzman College within China's Ts
inghua University in 2016.
Current courses of study proposed for the
program cover topics such as international re
lations, public policy and economics, and
there are future plans to incorporate engi
neering and other fields in later stage.
"My vision for Schwarzman Scholars is to
help educate a future class of leaders who will
advance relationships of mutual respect be
tween the West and China, reducing tensions
and leading to a new era of mutual prosperi
ty," Schwarzman said in a press release.
While the program is still at its inception,
