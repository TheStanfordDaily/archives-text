## FGSS rebrands, offers new Ph.D. minor 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Celebrating a recent name change, the Pro
gram in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
(FGSS) has expanded its offerings to graduate
students with the introduction of an interdiscipli
nary Ph.D. minor.
Formally known as the Program in Feminist
Studies, the FGSS changed its name after three
years of deliberation to be more inclusive to stu
dents interested in pursuing fields at the inter
section of gender and sexuality while maintaining
the program's commitment to activism by keep
ing the word "feminist" in the title.
"We felt that the word feminist is a bit more
political and felt that is an important distinction
that we want to maintain, that it has an activist
stand to it... Not using the word feminist would
be a loss to the program," said Christine Min
Wotipka M.A. '99 Ph.D. 'Ol, program director of
FGSS.
Penelope Eckert, former program director,
said that there was always a pressure to replace
feminism studies with gender studies.
"Feminist studies really does involve a more
critical stance," Eckert said. "Gender studies can
accept the gender binary as given."
Development of the program's new interdisci
plinary Ph.D. minor also began a few years ago.
In 2011, Heather Hadlock, the program direc
tor of the time, administered an online survey to
gauge interest for the minor. Graduate students
from a variety of different disciplines responded
with interest.
"In history, we study so much about particular
places and particular time periods, but we don't
necessarily get a chance to focus thematically,"
said Mackenzie Cooley Ph.D. 'lB, a history de-

Ph.D. minor.
"You get to have a theo
retical background in the
breadth of women issues
while at the same time pur
suing a really directed aca
demic trajectory," Cooley
added. "So it's really a great
opportunity to study some
thing that's a second inter
est out of my degree study
and get credit for it."
Meredith Townsend, a
third-year student in the
Department of Geological &
Environmental Sciences, is
also working towards the
minor.
"I'm thinking of going in

to academia so if I were ever
to teach a class on that inter
section, it would be great to
have authority to teach
that," Townsend said.
According to Lily Lam

the programs, students in

the interdisciplinary Ph.D.
minor would be required to
take a workshop that the
FGSS will offer all three
quarters. They would pres
ent their own work on a top
ic of their own choice and re
ceive feedback from other
students and faculty.
Lamboy added that the
requirements for the minor
were not particularly time
intensive.
"You get to take classes
out of your field of study
I'm taking classes in anthro
pology and sociology that I
would have never taken,"

said Cooley, who estimated
that around 18 to 20 people
were in this quarter's work
shop.
"I also know of at least
four other people that want
to pursue the minor who
weren't able to fit the work
shop in their schedule," she
added. "To have that many
people is really exciting."
The program is looking
to expand and offer more
courses, said Wotipka. The
Ph.D. minor is the first step
in creating a larger gradu
ate program.
"We have the minimum
of what to offer," said Wotip
ka. "It's a minor but it's a
start. We're not stopping
with the minor, we can offer
Masters or Ph.D.'s in the fu
ture."

Ph.D. minor is the first step
in creating a larger gradu

"We have the minimum
of what to offer," said Wotip

start. We're not stopping
with the minor, we can offer
Masters or Ph.D.'s in the fu
ture."

Celebrating a recent name change, the Pro
gram in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
(FGSS) has expanded its offerings to graduate
students with the introduction of an interdiscipli
nary Ph.D. minor.
Formally known as the Program in Feminist
Studies, the FGSS changed its name after three
years of deliberation to be more inclusive to stu
dents interested in pursuing fields at the inter
section of gender and sexuality while maintaining
the program's commitment to activism by keep
ing the word "feminist" in the title.
"We felt that the word feminist is a bit more
political and felt that is an important distinction
that we want to maintain, that it has an activist
stand to it... Not using the word feminist would
be a loss to the program," said Christine Min
Wotipka M.A. '99 Ph.D. 'Ol, program director of
FGSS.
Penelope Eckert, former program director,
said that there was always a pressure to replace
feminism studies with gender studies.
"Feminist studies really does involve a more
critical stance," Eckert said. "Gender studies can
accept the gender binary as given."
Development of the program's new interdisci
plinary Ph.D. minor also began a few years ago.
In 2011, Heather Hadlock, the program direc
tor of the time, administered an online survey to
gauge interest for the minor. Graduate students
from a variety of different disciplines responded
with interest.
"In history, we study so much about particular
places and particular time periods, but we don't
necessarily get a chance to focus thematically,"
said Mackenzie Cooley Ph.D. 'lB, a history de-

working towards the new
Ph.D. minor.
"You get to have a theo
retical background in the
breadth of women issues
while at the same time pur
suing a really directed aca
demic trajectory," Cooley
added. "So it's really a great
opportunity to study some
thing that's a second inter
est out of my degree study
and get credit for it."
Meredith Townsend, a
third-year student in the
Department of Geological &
Environmental Sciences, is
also working towards the
minor.
"I'm thinking of going in

to academia so if I were ever
to teach a class on that inter
section, it would be great to
have authority to teach
that," Townsend said.
According to Lily Lam
boy, the graduate mentor for
the programs, students in
terested in working towards
the interdisciplinary Ph.D.
minor would be required to
take a workshop that the
FGSS will offer all three
quarters. They would pres
ent their own work on a top
ic of their own choice and re
ceive feedback from other
students and faculty.
Lamboy added that the
requirements for the minor
were not particularly time
intensive.
"You get to take classes
out of your field of study
I'm taking classes in anthro
pology and sociology that I
would have never taken,"

said Cooley, who estimated
that around 18 to 20 people
were in this quarter's work
shop.
"I also know of at least
four other people that want
to pursue the minor who
weren't able to fit the work
shop in their schedule," she
added. "To have that many
people is really exciting."
The program is looking
to expand and offer more
courses, said Wotipka. The
Ph.D. minor is the first step
in creating a larger gradu
ate program.
