## FGSS rebrands, offers new Ph.D. minor 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Celebrating a recent name change, the Pro
gram in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
(FGSS) has expanded its offerings to graduate
students with the introduction of an interdiscipli

Formally known as the Program in Feminist
Studies, the FGSS changed its name after three

the program's commitment to activism by keep

"We felt that the word feminist is a bit more
political and felt that is an important distinction
that we want to maintain, that it has an activist
stand to it... Not using the word feminist would
be a loss to the program," said Christine Min
Wotipka M.A. '99 Ph.D. 'Ol, program director of
FGSS.
Penelope Eckert, former program director,
said that there was always a pressure to replace
feminism studies with gender studies.
"Feminist studies really does involve a more
critical stance," Eckert said. "Gender studies can
accept the gender binary as given."
Development of the program's new interdisci
plinary Ph.D. minor also began a few years ago.
In 2011, Heather Hadlock, the program direc
tor of the time, administered an online survey to
gauge interest for the minor. Graduate students
from a variety of different disciplines responded
with interest.
"In history, we study so much about particular
places and particular time periods, but we don't
necessarily get a chance to focus thematically,"
said Mackenzie Cooley Ph.D. 'lB, a history de-
