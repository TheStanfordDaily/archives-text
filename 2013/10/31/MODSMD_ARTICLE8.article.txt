## Researchers convert fat to liver Medical School research offers faster way to produce liver cells 
### ISSA YOUSIF 
Researchers at the Stanford University School
of Medicine have developed away to quickly and
efficiently convert human fat stem cells into liver
cells.
Scientists at the Peltz lab obtained human fat
cells through liposuction, isolating the fat stem
cells known as adipocyte stem cells, and through
a method called spherical culture, induced these
cells to become liver cells, or spherical-culture
induced hepatocytes (SCi-Heps). They then ad
ministered these hepatocytes in a mouse model
organism and showed that these liver cells were
able to reconstitute functioning human liver.
"There is a lot of potential for [treating] differ
ent liver diseases," said Dan Xu, a postdoctoral fel
low at Stanford, and the lead author of the study
The Peltz lab's method solves the problems that
come with creating liver cells through previously
established procedures such as the use of induced
plmipotent stem (iPS) cells. In addition to having
only a 10 percent yield rate, iPS requires 30 or
more days to produce liver cells and can cause tu
mor formation.
This new technique, however, does not involve
any animal products or introduce any foreign
genes and shows no evidence of tumor formation.
"We're now up to 60-80 percent [yield] and the
timeframe is down to nine days," said Gary Peltz
M.D. 'B5 Ph.D. 'B5, professor of anesthesia and the
paper's senior author. 'And we're getting 15-20
fold more cells than we use to get. So all this puts
us within a scale that is appropriate for human
use."
Another advantage to this method is the wide
availability of fat.
"Unfortunately here in America fat is readi
ly available," Peltz said. "There's plenty of fat to
go around, and through liposuction, you have a
minimally invasive way to obtain a large num
ber of cells in order to [produce liver cells for
use in humans]."
Through this method, the Peltz lab hopes to
break ground in treating acute toxic insults like

drug overdoses and mushroom poisoning.
"We hope, by some time in 2015, to be able to
test whether this will work in humans," Peltz said.
"Our target right now is Tylenol induced liver
toxicity. People who take an overdose of Tylenol
basically destroy their liver and we hope to be
able to replace it using this method [using] the
same exact procedures we use in the mice."
People with acute toxic insults like Tylenol in
duced liver toxicity need a liver transplant within
two to three weeks, Peltz said. But there are ten
times more people needing a liver than there are
livers available. Even if a liver is found, recipients
must take immunosuppressants —a class of drugs
that reduces the strength of the body's immune
system—for the rest of their lives to cope with the
body's rejection of the new liver.
But if a patient's liver is regenerated through
the Peltz lab's technique, those side effects may be
avoided.
"With [our] procedure you do relatively minor
things," Peltz said. "You do a liposuction and then a
needle injection into the liver. There is no major
surgery and since it's your own cells you won't need
immunosuppression."
However, before the researchers can use these
cells in humans, they must assure that the liver
cells are safe.
The researchers performed caretul compar
isons to see how closely SCi-Heps resemble liver
cells. They looked at the functional properties of
liver cells, such as metabolizing drugs, making
the necessary proteins and taking in lipids or
LDL.
The researchers also did a detailed microar
ray analysis of gene expression that looked at
30,000 probes and compared the induced hepato
cytes they made to liver cells and fat cells. The
analysis suggested that the hepatocytes pro
duced through this technique have 80-90 percent
resemblance to human liver cells.
"We have to do a lot of tests based on the FDA
guidelines," Xu said. "They gave us 30 pages that
we have to follow"
"The next step is to make sure the cells we in
ject in human beings do not have any safety issues,
meaning there is no tumor formation, and [the liv
er cells] won't cause extra toxicity," Xu added.
