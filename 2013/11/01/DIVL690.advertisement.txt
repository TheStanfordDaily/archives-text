free events for students and educators. It presents windows
on the world that move students beyond the practice of learn

help them to begin to learn from within the Arab World through the
eyes and ears of cutting-edge contemporary filmmakers.

the Language Center, Stanford University, Detroit Public Television
and KQED will be sponsoring a special screening from Arab
