### â€“ Catherine Zaw 
Stanford is currently work
ing with the Santa Clara Coun
ty Public Health Department in
an ongoing investigation of 52
cases of students suffering
from nausea, vomiting and diar
rhea in Florence Moore Hall
(FloMo).

The earliest case was re
ported on Tuesday afternoon
and reports continued through
Wednesday until midnight
Thursday morning, according
to Ira Friedman, director of
Vaden Health Center.
Friedman added that four
students in that period of time
were treated and released at
the Stanford Hospital Emer
gency Room, all of whom quick
ly recovered after being treated
and stabilized. None were ad
mitted for overnight stays.
"It was a very rapid num
ber of cases all at once, within
24 hours," Friedman said.
The symptoms of the cases
are consistent with those asso
ciated with the norovirus a
rapid overwhelming onset,
nausea and vomiting, slight
fever in some cases, vomiting
and diarrhea and a rapid resolu
tion within 24 hours. Friedman
emphasizes that norovirus
should not be confused with
the flu, which manifests respi
ratory symptoms like runny
noses, colds, headaches,
coughs, swollen glands and si
nus-affecting symptoms.

Friedman said the investi
gation of the situation may take
several days, as Stanford and
the health county department
collect and analyze data by sur
veying students who became ill
