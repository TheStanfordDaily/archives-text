# NEWS BRIEF
## Stanford, county health department investigating possible norovirus outbreak 
### â€“ Catherine Zaw 
Stanford is currently work
ing with the Santa Clara Coun
ty Public Health Department in
an ongoing investigation of 52
cases of students suffering
from nausea, vomiting and diar
rhea in Florence Moore Hall
(FloMo).

The earliest case was re
ported on Tuesday afternoon
and reports continued through
Wednesday until midnight
Thursday morning, according
to Ira Friedman, director of
Vaden Health Center.
Friedman added that four
students in that period of time
were treated and released at
the Stanford Hospital Emer
gency Room, all of whom quick
ly recovered after being treated
and stabilized. None were ad
mitted for overnight stays.
"It was a very rapid num
ber of cases all at once, within
24 hours," Friedman said.
The symptoms of the cases
are consistent with those asso
ciated with the norovirus a
rapid overwhelming onset,
nausea and vomiting, slight
fever in some cases, vomiting
and diarrhea and a rapid resolu
tion within 24 hours. Friedman
emphasizes that norovirus
should not be confused with
the flu, which manifests respi
ratory symptoms like runny
noses, colds, headaches,
coughs, swollen glands and si
nus-affecting symptoms.

Friedman said the investi
gation of the situation may take
several days, as Stanford and
the health county department
collect and analyze data by sur
veying students who became ill
and examining their food intake histories.

The residential custodial staff has been
sanitizing common spaces in FloMo more
frequently since Wednesday morning, clean
ing in double shifts. Vaden Health Center is
also working with Peer Health Educators
(PHEs) and Residential Assistants (RA) in or
der to inform the rest of the student body on
how to best stay healthy.
Friedman emphasized the need for stu
dents to take extra precaution with personal
hygiene.
"Norovirus can be spread person to per
son, in contact with objects, with food, even
contact with air when someone is actively
retching," Friedman said. "One has to be
very careful in approaching infected materi
als and people."
Friedman emphasized that individuals
can continue to spread the virus even after
72 hours after recovery.
However, Friedman denied that the af-

fected individuals had to be isolated as long
as students are on guard against a "sec
ondary spread."
Though FloMo dining is still in opera
tion, it will undergo a complete sanitization
over the weekend, according to a press re
lease on Thursday.
Friedman stated that the last outbreak
of norovirus that was similar in numbers to
this one was six or seven years ago in Toyon
Hall. However, he also mentioned that few
small outbreaks on campus have occurred
since then.

Friedman denied
that the affected
individuals had to
be isolated.
