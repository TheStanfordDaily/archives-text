## FOOTBALL Bulcke talks startup 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Brian Bulcke 'lO M.S. 'll is having a
hard time feeling much different than he did
as a student-athlete at Stanford.

A defensive lineman for five years at
Stanford a stretch that culminated with
the Orange Bowl win in early 2011 Bul
cke now plays for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of
the Canadian Football League (CFL).
But while Bulcke is a professional foot
ball player, playing football is not his only job
by any means. Bulcke is a co-founder (with
best friend and former teammate Alex
Loukas 'lO M.A. '11) and partner of
Fan Travel, a company that organizes travel
and events for fans attending sporting
events. Life as a professional football player
and entrepreneur can get pretty busy.
"For perspective," Bulcke said, "I prob
ably got out of practice about an hour, hour
and a half ago [at 4 p.m.], raced back home,
cranked through some emails and I'll proba
bly make a good effort until 7:30."
Bulcke likens the balance to that he
learned to achieve while a student-athlete at
Stanford. It's not a phenomenon unique to
Bulcke either.
"We were always doing two things at
once," Bulcke said of his Stanford team
mates. "So you look at a lot of the guys that
have kept playing football [after Stanford],
and a lot of them are doing different things
[too]. Look at Richard Sherman working his
foundation right now. Having two things go
ing on at once can almost balance you more
and keep you more well-rounded."
The past year has been a big one for Bul
cke on and off the field. Just a few days ago,
Bulcke was nominated for CFL-wide awards
for the most outstanding defensive player
and the most outstanding Canadian-born
player in the league. A little under 12

months ago, Bulcke played in the Grey Cup,
Canada's Super Bowl. And this summer,
Fan Travel became the official travel partner
of Stanford football.

Fan Travel's partnership with Stanford
Athletics has gotten Fan Travel back to its
roots. Bulcke and Loukas had the idea for
Fan Travel during their senior year at Stan
ford, and their original mentor and current
trusted advisor is Director of Football Opera
tions Matt Doyle.
"The expectations for a position like

[Doyle's] is unbelievable," Bulcke said.
"Everything has to be flawless, perfect.
There's an old adage, 'lf you're five minutes
early, you're on time. If you're on time,
you're late. If you're late, you're forgotten.'
They're doing this bookkeeping and logistics
for 100-plus people week-in and week-out."
Doyle's biggest contribution to Fan Tra
vel went beyond just his good advice. Doyle
gave Bulcke and Loukas a "toolkit of his best
practices" that Bulcke says Fan Travel uses for
almost every trip it plans.
The first road trip planned by Bulcke and
Fan Travel after the company became Stan
ford football's official travel partner was this
September, when Stanford football played at
Army. Fan Travel set up a fan hotel in down
town Manhattan and held events the night
before the game, but the highlight came
surprisingly from the transportation.
The Fan Travel crew, numbering around
600 Stanford fans, ferried to West Point, tail
gating up the Hudson River. The logistics of
Manhattan, ferrying and ending up at an
Army base in West Point were a nightmare to
plan for, according to Bulcke, but everything
worked out as planned.
Bulcke, perhaps fittingly, wasn't in atten
dance for the big day. While the rest of his
partners in the company, along with the op
erational staff, went to New York to super
vise, Bulcke was busy with his other job. His
Tiger-Cats had a game in Winnipeg that day.
"I was bashing my face against other
300-pound men for the afternoon," Bulcke
said.

Fan Travel will be back in action at USC,
and Bulcke is expecting the same- sized
crowd in Los Angeles as Fan Travel got for the
trip to Army.
Stanford has one more game before the
trip to USC, and it's a big one. For that game,
Thursday against Oregon, Bulcke has per
haps even more at stake than he did at Army
One of Bulcke's teammates in Flamilton is
former Oregon quarterback Jeremiah Ma
soli, and Bulcke freely admitted that he has a
"gentlemen's agreement" with Masoli on the
outcome.

"We better darn well be [winning at the
end of the game]," Bulcke said. "Not only do
[Masoli and I] have the gentlemen's bet, but
we've got an entire full-body dunk in the ice
tank for about 25 seconds for the loser [on
the line]."

You can bet that Bulcke won't be too
happy with his former teammates if he has to
take the cold plunge after a Cardinal loss.
