## FOOTBALL Bulcke talks startup 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Brian Bulcke 'lO M.S. 'll is having a
hard time feeling much different than he did
as a student-athlete at Stanford.

A defensive lineman for five years at
Stanford a stretch that culminated with
the Orange Bowl win in early 2011 Bul
cke now plays for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of
the Canadian Football League (CFL).
But while Bulcke is a professional foot
ball player, playing football is not his only job
by any means. Bulcke is a co-founder (with
best friend and former teammate Alex
Loukas 'lO M.A. '11) and partner of
Fan Travel, a company that organizes travel
and events for fans attending sporting
events. Life as a professional football player
and entrepreneur can get pretty busy.
"For perspective," Bulcke said, "I prob
ably got out of practice about an hour, hour
and a half ago [at 4 p.m.], raced back home,
cranked through some emails and I'll proba
bly make a good effort until 7:30."
Bulcke likens the balance to that he
learned to achieve while a student-athlete at
Stanford. It's not a phenomenon unique to
Bulcke either.
"We were always doing two things at
once," Bulcke said of his Stanford team
mates. "So you look at a lot of the guys that
have kept playing football [after Stanford],
and a lot of them are doing different things
[too]. Look at Richard Sherman working his
foundation right now. Having two things go
ing on at once can almost balance you more
