# FACES OF THE FACELESS
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
If there's one position group on the
Stanford football team that prides itself on
accomplishing its task as a nameless, face
less unit, it's the Tunnel Workers Union.
But if you're looking for some of the
team's most distinct personalities, that
very same offensive line is a good place

to start.

You've got seniors Cameron Fleming
and Conor McFadden, for example, who
have been featured for their uncanny in
telligence in separate College Game Day
segments in the last month alone. McFad
den, the backup center, uses his photo
graphic memory to break down opposing
defenses; Fleming, the starting right tack
le and an Aeronautics & Astronautics ma

jor, is literally a rocket scientist.
On the other hand, there's fifth-year
senior Kevin Danser. A biomechanical en
gineering major, he's no slouch academi
cally, but the starting right guard is known
to blank out on the sideline every now
and then. One coach sometimes compares
Danser to his youngest child.
"He has some very freshman-like mo
ments on the bench sometimes when
we're making adjustments, and he can be
very forgetful," said senior left guard
David Yankey.
Another fifth-year senior who "em
braces his inner child," as McFadden put
it, is starting center Khalil Wilkes. As if the
terminology of the Cardinal's complex
playbook isn't enough for most linemen to
master, new players have to get used to
Wilkes' sayings as well.

"Khalil Wilkes has invented a new lan
guage that is used purely in the Stanford
football locker room," McFadden said. "I
think it's spreading across campus. It's
funny. I'll go home, and ask my buddies to
throw me 'daps,' and they'll just kind of
look at me funny, like, 'What's daps?' And
I'm just like, 'Oh, you know, high fives.
Don't you guys talk?"'
Just as confusing is "ya boy," a Wilkes
ian term that can refer to the speaker, a
friend of the speaker or a friend of a friend
McFadden, intellect and all, isn't really
sure.

A close second to Wilkes as the
team's funniest offensive lineman is an
other center, junior Kevin Reihner. His
jokes, however, take a slightly different
form.

"We were calling him 'The Gunman'
today," Yankey said last week, "because
he's just always cracking jokes about peo
ple and trash-talking."
"If you're in a back-and-forth with
[Reihner], you better be ready to roll,"
McFadden cautioned. "We don't really
trash talk that much out on the field;
we're not out there making spectacular
one-handed grabs or doing anything like
that, so we don't have that much material
to work with. But just within the room it
self and within the locker room, there's a
lot of back-and-forth between people, and
Kevin Reihner is just on top of his game."

Center Khalil Wilkes (front) is known as the Card's funniest offensive lineman. Not only
does he coordinate the line's pre-snap alignment, but he speaks his own language as well.
