## Blocking back the Bruins Card looks to begin new home winning streak 
### JORDAN WALLACH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After dropping an emotional five-set
match to No. 4 USC on Wednesday, the Stan
ford women's volleyball team will aim to start
a new home winning streak tonight at Maples
Pavilion, where it had previously won 24
straight matches.
The No. 6 Cardinal (15-5, 8-3 Pac-12),
now a game and a half behind conference
leader No. 3 Washington, takes on UCLA (12-
8,3-7) hoping to rebound. The team has been
particularly resilient after defeats, going 20-4
in matches after a loss over the last five sea
sons.

Stanford's match against USC was
marked by constant shifts in momentum, per
haps none more crucial than a seven-point
Trojan run at the end of the second set, which
saw USC overcome a 18-23 deficit to even up
the match. The letdown for the Card came af
ter a first set in which it outhit the Trojans,
.516 to .128, and cruised 25-16 in one of its
best-played all-around sets of the season.
Wednesday's match seemed to parallel the
team's five-set loss to Washington on Oct. 20,
when mental lapses manifested themselves
on the court.

"It takes rededicating yourself every play
to thinking about the tiniest little things,"
said sophomore setter Madi Bugg, who
recorded her fifth double-double of the sea
son with career highs in assists (61) and digs
(17). "After however-many... years I've
played volleyball, I still have to think about my
thumbs when I set.

"When you start to relax, the little things
are the first to go, cause they're the easiest to
forget to do."

Stanford did not have much trouble in its
first match against UCLA this season, sweep
ing the Bruins 25-17, 25-15, 25-16. The Car
dinal outhit the Bruins .390 to .123, with

both defense and offense coming together
for Stanford. Senior outside hitter Carly
Wopat was the team's top performer, hitting
.667 with a match-high 13 kills on 18 at
tempts to go with six blocks.
UCLA, ninth in the Pac-12 standings,
enters tonight's match coming off of a four
set victory against Washington State last Sun
day. Players to watch for the Bruins are jun
ior outside hitter Karsta Lowe and senior
middle blocker Mariana Aquino. Lowe is hit
ting .305 this season and her 4.20 kills per
set this season ranks fifth in the Pac-12.
Aquino's .388 hitting percentage is fourth
best in the conference, and she also averages
1.08 blocks per set.
The key for the Cardinal will be to use
its nation-leading blocking to limit the Bru
ins' offensive attack. UCLA has won 42 con
secutive matches, including four this season,
when it hits over .300. With a win tonight,
the Card hopes to get its title run back on
track.

"We have to stop setting a limit on how
good we can be and start thinking and ex
pecting that we can be a championship
team," said sophomore outside hitter Jordan
Burgess. "And if it's going to happen, each
one of us has to get better."
The Cardinal battles the Bruins tonight
at 8 p.m. at Maples Pavilion. The match will
be televised on Pac-12 Networks.
