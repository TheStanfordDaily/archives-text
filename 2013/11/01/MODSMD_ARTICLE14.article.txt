# Stacked Pac-12s await Card runners

### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
When Stanford's No. 13 men's and No.
20 women's cross country teams head to
Louisville, Colo., for the Pac-12 Champi
onships this weekend, they will be going up
against some of the stiffest competition in
the nation in a meet that features a field in
cluding four top-30 ranked men's teams and
six top-30 women's teams.

Both of the No. 1 teams in the country
the Colorado men's team and the Arizona
women's team will be competing at the
meet. Colorado's teams already figure to
have an advantage due to the thinner air at
the mile-high elevation, an environment they
have been training in all year but that other
teams will need to adjust to.
Both of Stanford's teams are coming off
of solid performances at the Pre-Nationals
meet in Terre Haute, Ind., two weeks ago, in
which the men surprised many with their

fourth-place finish while the women finished
in ninth in a stacked field.

A significant factor in the women's top
-10 finish at Pre-Nationals was the top-five
showing by both junior Aisling Cuffe
(20:10.70) and senior Jessica Tonn
(20:12.84) â€”with both finishing at a sub
-5:30 mile pace in the 6K women's race.
Neither of them has finished outside of the
top five in any of the meets that Stanford has
competed in so far this year.
Outside of the dynamic duo of Cuffe
and Tonn, sophomores Megan Lacy, Rebecca
Mehra and Cami Chapus, junior Molly Mc-
Namara and senior Tate Murray, among oth
ers, have all been consistently running solid
times and will be looked at to run impactful
races as the women look to improve upon
their third-place finish of last year without
defending Pac-12 individual champion Kathy
Kroeger 'l2.

sub-5:30 pace at Pre-Nationals two weeks ago. She'll need to continue her string of top-five
performances if the Cardinal wants to win big at the star-studded Pac-12 Championships.
