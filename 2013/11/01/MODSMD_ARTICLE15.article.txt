# Spooky 2013 leads up to Oregon bout
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
It's always hard to swallow the ups and
downs of a football season until it's
over. It took until after the 2011 Or
ange Bowl for us to understand just
how good Stanford was; it took until
after the 2012 Fiesta Bowl for us to realize
just how much we would miss Andrew
Luck and the rest of his class.
But something about this 2013 Cardi-

nal season feels
weirder spooki
er? â€”than normal,
and I'm having trou
ble imagining how
it's going to all make
sense in a few -
months' time.
On its face, -

Stanford is exactly where we expected it
to be at this point of the season: in control
of its own Pac-12 destiny and hurtling to
ward a likely top-five clash with Oregon
next Thursday. But in getting there, Stan
ford has almost never done what we ex
pected it to do.

The Cardinal escaped its road trip to
unheralded, undersized Army with just a
two-touchdown win. Seven days later,
Stanford took out Kevin Hogan after jump
ing out to a 39-7 lead against No. 23 Ari
zona State; minutes after that, it gave up
three touchdowns in quick succession and
had to put Hogan back in the game.
Just when the Cardinal looked at its
most disoriented, it traveled to the one of
the most hostile environments in Ameri
can sports and managed to steamroll Wash
ington State 55-17.

Could Stanford play a 60-minute
game again at home against No. 15 Wash
ington the next week? Nope; it played an
other nail-biting fourth quarter instead.
That fight, of course, was followed by the
head-scratching loss at Utah and the head
scratching 3-0 first half against UCLA.
It's not just game results. Consider
this:

In eight games, Stanford tight ends
