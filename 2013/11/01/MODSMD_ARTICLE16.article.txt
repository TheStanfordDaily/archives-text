# FIELD HOCKEY
## NorPacs up next 
### CARLIE TENENBAUM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With today concluding the regular sea
son for the Cardinal field hockey team, No.
12 Stanford's preparations will be targeted
on the upcoming NorPac Championships,
which begin Nov. 7 in Lynchberg, Va. The
lose-or-go-home tournament is hosted by
Liberty University, which is currently unde
feated in the Eastern Division, and will run
through Nov. 9.
Stanford is the only top-25 team in the
NorPac; however, the Cardinal will have to
be prepared for stiff competition.
Finishing first in the West Division, the
Cardinal (14-4, 5-1 NorPac), will be facing
Davidson (6-11, 2-6) in its first match.
Davidson may struggle against the high

powered Stanford offense; the Wildcats
have allowed an average of 2.83 goals
against this season, putting them in the bot
tom third of Division I.

Sophomore midfielder Melissa Funsten
is the biggest offensive threat for Davidson,
with seven goals thus far this season, and
senior Tyler McFayden is the Wildcats' best
distributor with seven assists.

Senior Carolyn Macek starts in goal for
the Wildcats, and has compiled two shutouts
and 62 saves on the season.
Stanford has had excellent NorPac suc
cess in the past, winning five of the last six
tournaments. Last year's final was a 3-0
shutout win for the Cardinal against Liberty
a possible rematch this year in which
Stanford punched its ticket to the NCAA
Play-In Game in 2012. That matchup pits the
NorPac champion against the MAC champi
on, with the winner of the one-game playoff
advancing to the NCAA Tournament.
Optimistically looking beyond the Nor-
Pac tournament, Stanford would have a
tough road to the NCAA Championship.
Poised to strike again, No. 1 Maryland has
captured five of the last eight titles.
After a victory against Pacific on Mon
day's Senior Night and a 1-0 overtime win in
a rivalry match against Cal Thursday after
noon, an emotionally charged Stanford
squad will be anxious to head to the East
Coast. The fact that the Cardinal has never
won the NCAA tournament and that the
NCAA title usually belongs to an East Coast
team only adds to the Cardinal's passion.
In addition to a phenomenal team effort
thus far, three Stanford players were recog
nized for excellence in Week 9 by NorPac.
Kelsey Harbin was recognized for outstand
ing defensive play in the team's win against
Michigan; Hope Burke was recognized for
her game-winning shot against Michigan as
well as her offensive potency against Duke;
and freshmen Fran Tew was recognized for
her tying goal against Michigan. This was the
third recognition for each of these players,
and the second in a row for Harbin and Tew.

Virginia-bound next week, the Cardinal
will be looking to secure another NorPac
championship and face the MAC champion
for a shot at an NCAA tournament berth.
