## MOVIE REVIEW "12 Years A Slave" cast disappoints 
### MARIA DEL CARMEN BARRIOS STAFF WRITER 
Steve McQueen's "12 Years A Slave" is different from his
other movies, the magnificent "Hunger" and stunning
"Shame." It tells the true story of Solomon Northup, a
New Yorker who in 1841 was deceived and sold into
slavery. He spent a dozen years working for several mas
ters in the South and was finally freed and reunited with
his family in 1853. Although his story is told with immense dig
nity, its epic adaptation into film doesn't quite capture what in
ner strength it took to endure the ordeal. The audience isn't
asked to comprehend Northup, but only to stand in awe of his
survival.

This isn't to say the film is completely lacking in depth: It
is a harrowing portrayal of slavery and the often banal villainy
through which it endured. Michael Fassbender gives the per
formance of a lifetime as Edwin Epps, the last of Northup's
(rechristened "Piatt" when first sold) masters. His acting is fear
less, transforming what could have been a two-dimensional an
tagonist into one of the most disturbing red-blooded bigots to
grace the big screen. Playing his rancorous wife is Sarah Paul
son, who, in one of the most startling scenes in the movie,
abruptly throws a heavy glass decanter at Patsey, the master's
favorite, hitting her square across the face and knocking her
out. Lupita Nyong'o, who plays Patsey with heartbreaking
fragility, is perhaps the best acting discovery of the year. Her
scenes with Fassbender are deeply unsettling, their chemistry
one of the high points of the film.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the dynamics of
the whole cast. A chain of actors who can't quite grasp the in
tonation and demeanor of the 19th century American English
vernacular hampers the first half of the movie; they bog down
the film with melodramatic deliveries that do little to move the
story along. With the movie clocking in at 130 minutes, it's
hard not to reproach the director for lingering so long on strug
gling dramatizations and the writer (John Ridley) for such
cliched characterization.
