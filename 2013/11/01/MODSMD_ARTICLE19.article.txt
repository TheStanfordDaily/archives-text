## MOVIE REVIEW "12 Years A Slave" cast disappoints 
### MARIA DEL CARMEN BARRIOS STAFF WRITER 
Steve McQueen's "12 Years A Slave" is different from his
other movies, the magnificent "Hunger" and stunning
"Shame." It tells the true story of Solomon Northup, a
New Yorker who in 1841 was deceived and sold into
slavery. He spent a dozen years working for several mas
ters in the South and was finally freed and reunited with
his family in 1853. Although his story is told with immense dig
nity, its epic adaptation into film doesn't quite capture what in
ner strength it took to endure the ordeal. The audience isn't
asked to comprehend Northup, but only to stand in awe of his
survival.

This isn't to say the film is completely lacking in depth: It
is a harrowing portrayal of slavery and the often banal villainy
through which it endured. Michael Fassbender gives the per
formance of a lifetime as Edwin Epps, the last of Northup's
(rechristened "Piatt" when first sold) masters. His acting is fear
less, transforming what could have been a two-dimensional an
tagonist into one of the most disturbing red-blooded bigots to
grace the big screen. Playing his rancorous wife is Sarah Paul
son, who, in one of the most startling scenes in the movie,
abruptly throws a heavy glass decanter at Patsey, the master's
favorite, hitting her square across the face and knocking her
out. Lupita Nyong'o, who plays Patsey with heartbreaking
fragility, is perhaps the best acting discovery of the year. Her
scenes with Fassbender are deeply unsettling, their chemistry
one of the high points of the film.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the dynamics of
the whole cast. A chain of actors who can't quite grasp the in
tonation and demeanor of the 19th century American English
vernacular hampers the first half of the movie; they bog down
the film with melodramatic deliveries that do little to move the
story along. With the movie clocking in at 130 minutes, it's
hard not to reproach the director for lingering so long on strug
gling dramatizations and the writer (John Ridley) for such
cliched characterization.
Whatever its narrative short
comings, the film is an undeniable vi
sual triumph. Cinematographer Sean
Bobbitt's camera frames Northup's
life with dynamism and polish, push
ing through sugar stalk and slipping
through pigpens to witness Piatt's
tale of abasement. In one particularly
striking scene, Bobbit frames a full
shot of Piatt (almost) hanging from a
tree after his lynching has been cut
short. As he struggles on tiptoes in
the muck, life on the plantation con
tinues in the background: Slaves en
ter and exit the shot as they go about
their work, and the mistress stares
out languidly from the porch. Silent
ly disquieting, it goes on for minutes,
a literal dance for survival punctuat
ed only by dry gagging.

The art direction is another of
the film's strengths, although some
of the costumes, and particularly the
urban scenes, lack the grit nowadays
expected in a period film: "12 Years
A Slave" is certainly no "Lincoln." Its
palette is much brighter, with most
scenes taking place in the sun
soaked outdoors. The score is equal
ly impressive: Master composer

Hans Zimmer uses steel drums and
other percussion to build unease,
but at times the music does seems
better suited for science fiction than
a period piece.
However, "12 Years A Slave" is
by no means a failure. It is a pleasing
film, and reasonably uplifting. It will
undoubtedly rake up the usual Acad
emy Award nominations that grand
epics periodically bag. But where
there was opportunity to probe into
how a man may lose his pride but re
tain his will to live, the filmmaker
chose instead to focus on worldly af
flictions. It's odd, because even
though I see Solomon naked, I see
him beaten, I see him shamed, I see
him whip a woman bloody and I see
him embrace his grandson, I never
understand precisely what it was
that kept him going. Early on in the
film he tells his fellow captives, "I
don't want to survive, I want to
live." How unfortunate that his sur
vival, and not his life, was the tale
Steve McQueen chose to tell.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the dynamics of
the whole cast. A chain of actors who can't quite grasp the in
tonation and demeanor of the 19th century American English
vernacular hampers the first half of the movie; they bog down
the film with melodramatic deliveries that do little to move the
story along. With the movie clocking in at 130 minutes, it's
hard not to reproach the director for lingering so long on strug
gling dramatizations and the writer (John Ridley) for such
cliched characterization.
Whatever its narrative short
comings, the film is an undeniable vi
sual triumph. Cinematographer Sean
Bobbitt's camera frames Northup's
life with dynamism and polish, push
ing through sugar stalk and slipping
through pigpens to witness Piatt's
tale of abasement. In one particularly
striking scene, Bobbit frames a full
shot of Piatt (almost) hanging from a
tree after his lynching has been cut
short. As he struggles on tiptoes in
the muck, life on the plantation con
tinues in the background: Slaves en
ter and exit the shot as they go about
their work, and the mistress stares
out languidly from the porch. Silent
ly disquieting, it goes on for minutes,
a literal dance for survival punctuat
ed only by dry gagging.

The art direction is another of
the film's strengths, although some
of the costumes, and particularly the
urban scenes, lack the grit nowadays
expected in a period film: "12 Years
A Slave" is certainly no "Lincoln." Its
palette is much brighter, with most
scenes taking place in the sun
soaked outdoors. The score is equal
ly impressive: Master composer

Hans Zimmer uses steel drums and
other percussion to build unease,
but at times the music does seems
better suited for science fiction than
a period piece.
However, "12 Years A Slave" is
by no means a failure. It is a pleasing
film, and reasonably uplifting. It will
undoubtedly rake up the usual Acad
emy Award nominations that grand
epics periodically bag. But where
there was opportunity to probe into
how a man may lose his pride but re
tain his will to live, the filmmaker
chose instead to focus on worldly af
flictions. It's odd, because even
though I see Solomon naked, I see
him beaten, I see him shamed, I see
him whip a woman bloody and I see
him embrace his grandson, I never
understand precisely what it was
that kept him going. Early on in the
film he tells his fellow captives, "I
don't want to survive, I want to
live." How unfortunate that his sur
vival, and not his life, was the tale
Steve McQueen chose to tell.
