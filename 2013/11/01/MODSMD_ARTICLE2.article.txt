## Looking to the future "Vision 2020" re-envisions career counseling services 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The director of Career Development
Center (CDC) has begun an ambitious plan
to rethink the way career counseling is done
in higher education.
"We are launching into a path of trans
forming our model from mainly career coun
seling ... to a model that's about building ca
reer connections through career communi
ties," said Farouk Dey, who assumed control
of the CDC last April.
Late last spring, Dey appointed a steer
ing committee of students, alumni, faculty,
parents, staff and recruiters to help guide the
redesign, which Dey dubbed "Vision 2020."
"The title 'Vision 2020' is a reference to

us envisioning the next generation of career
services in higher education and envisioning
the state of career services at Stanford in the
year 2020," Dey explained.
Traditionally, University career coun
selors have focused on helping students craft
their resumes and perfect their interview
skills. Dey said that while the CDC will con
tinue to offer these important services, the
realities of today's job market following the
2008 economic recession means that the
CDC has to expand its offerings.

The new model will emphasize building
connections between all stakeholders in
cluding students, parents, faculty and em
ployersâ€” beginning early in a student's
Stanford career and continuing beyond grad
uation.

"We're moving into a world where
things are hyperconnected... and in order to
get the next opportunity you need to be con
necting with other people in order to find

The Career Development Center staff has been reorganized so that each counselor is
assigned specific career communities centered around academic and career interests.
