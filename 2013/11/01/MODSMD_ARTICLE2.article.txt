## Looking to the future "Vision 2020" re-envisions career counseling services 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The director of Career Development
Center (CDC) has begun an ambitious plan
to rethink the way career counseling is done
in higher education.
"We are launching into a path of trans
forming our model from mainly career coun
seling ... to a model that's about building ca
reer connections through career communi
ties," said Farouk Dey, who assumed control
of the CDC last April.
Late last spring, Dey appointed a steer
ing committee of students, alumni, faculty,
parents, staff and recruiters to help guide the
redesign, which Dey dubbed "Vision 2020."
"The title 'Vision 2020' is a reference to

us envisioning the next generation of career
services in higher education and envisioning
the state of career services at Stanford in the
year 2020," Dey explained.
Traditionally, University career coun
selors have focused on helping students craft
their resumes and perfect their interview
skills. Dey said that while the CDC will con
tinue to offer these important services, the
realities of today's job market following the
2008 economic recession means that the
CDC has to expand its offerings.

The new model will emphasize building
connections between all stakeholders in
cluding students, parents, faculty and em
ployers— beginning early in a student's
Stanford career and continuing beyond grad
uation.

things are hyperconnected... and in order to
get the next opportunity you need to be con
necting with other people in order to find

that," said Subhan Ali M.S. 'O9 Ph.D.
'l4, a member of the steering com
mittee. "People who leverage their
network are the people who are go
ing to get ahead professionally in the
new world of career services."
In order to facilitate these con
nections, the CDC staff has been re
organized so that counselors are as
signed to specific academic depart
ments. Based on his or her educa
tional stage or declared major, each
student now has a certain counselor
prepared to provide guidance.
Dey said that he recognizes that
visiting career counseling services
can be overwhelming for undergrad
uates, so he has been encouraging
more regular interaction between
CDC staff and students.
"I don't want us to be someone
that you only schedule an appoint
ment with when you have a crisis or
when you really, really need help,"
Dey said. "Career development and
professional development must be

part of the fabric of the student ex
perience from day one until you
graduate and beyond."

This fall, counselors have been
holding regular meetups for stu
dents to discuss shared career inter
ests, strategies and questions. At
the beginning of the gathering, the
counselor will share information
about the designated topic

which can range from making the
most of winter break to negotiating
salaries but the rest of the
meetup is generally devoted to
open discussion. Dey said this is an
intentional structure designed to
encourage students to rely on each
other for support and build confi
dence in their job-preparation skills.
Chad Kamisugi 'l5, a member
of the Vision 2020 committee, said
that while he didn't expect change
to be immediate, he has already seen
positive signs from the CDC staff's
efforts to reach out.
"What has been beautiful about
this whole idea of meetups... has
been bringing a lot of this personal
connection and personal relation
ship-building to [the places] where

students are most comfortable,"
Kamisugi said. He added that even if
they don't immediately take advan
tage of it, more students seem to
have recognized that there is a CDC
counselor looking out for them and
providing a safety net.
"Ultimately, I think that will
have an immense impact especially
as some of these freshmen and soph
omores ... come to need these re
sources even more and these rela
tionships [between students and
CDC staff] really do come to
fruition," Kamisugi said.
According to Dey, the CDC does
not currently have the resources to
implement all of the programming
recommended under the Vision
2020 initiative. He said that he is in
the process of requesting more fund
ing from the University and hopes to
eventually hire more staff and ex
pand the CDC's offerings.
The next step will be to form
communities around career opportu
nities tied to employment sectors
and industries. If these frameworks
are established, which Dey hopes

will occur within the next year, stu
dents can begin networking with re
sources outside Stanford earlier in
their academic careers and gain bet
ter access to mentors, internships
and employment opportunities.
Ali pointed out that during their
times in dormitories, student clubs
and classes, students build great net
works, but those networks are com
posed almost entirely of peers.
"The reality is that once you
graduate from Stanford, you enter a
different world, which is the alumni
world," Ali said. 'And what you begin
to realize very quickly is that...
there's a whole real network of peo
ple out that are ready, willing and
able to help you achieve your profes
sional goals."
Dey said he eventually hopes to
offer CDC programming for Stan
ford graduates. For these partici
pants, the communities will be cen
tered on professional development
goals, such as improving leadership
skills or learning about entrepre
neurship.
Other future plans include en

hancing connections between poten
tial employers and Stanford, linking
students to experts in their fields and
engaging faculty in students' career
development.
"The idea is that we're helping
you explore your career options,

we're helping you connect with op
portunities [and] we're helping you

grow in your career," Dey said. "We
want the whole model of explo
ration, opportunities and profession
al development to be around this
idea of connections with the Stan
ford network."

their resumes and perfect their interview
skills. Dey said that while the CDC will con
tinue to offer these important services, the
realities of today's job market following the
2008 economic recession means that the
CDC has to expand its offerings.

The new model will emphasize building
connections between all stakeholders in
cluding students, parents, faculty and em
ployers— beginning early in a student's
Stanford career and continuing beyond grad
uation.

that," said Subhan Ali M.S. 'O9 Ph.D.
'l4, a member of the steering com
mittee. "People who leverage their
network are the people who are go
ing to get ahead professionally in the
new world of career services."
In order to facilitate these con
nections, the CDC staff has been re
organized so that counselors are as
signed to specific academic depart
ments. Based on his or her educa
tional stage or declared major, each
student now has a certain counselor
prepared to provide guidance.
Dey said that he recognizes that
visiting career counseling services
can be overwhelming for undergrad
uates, so he has been encouraging
more regular interaction between
CDC staff and students.
"I don't want us to be someone
that you only schedule an appoint
ment with when you have a crisis or
when you really, really need help,"
Dey said. "Career development and
professional development must be

part of the fabric of the student ex
perience from day one until you
graduate and beyond."

This fall, counselors have been
holding regular meetups for stu
dents to discuss shared career inter
ests, strategies and questions. At
the beginning of the gathering, the
counselor will share information
about the designated topic

which can range from making the
most of winter break to negotiating
salaries but the rest of the
meetup is generally devoted to
open discussion. Dey said this is an
intentional structure designed to
encourage students to rely on each
other for support and build confi
dence in their job-preparation skills.
Chad Kamisugi 'l5, a member
of the Vision 2020 committee, said
that while he didn't expect change
to be immediate, he has already seen
positive signs from the CDC staff's
efforts to reach out.
"What has been beautiful about
this whole idea of meetups... has
been bringing a lot of this personal
connection and personal relation
ship-building to [the places] where

students are most comfortable,"
Kamisugi said. He added that even if
they don't immediately take advan
tage of it, more students seem to
have recognized that there is a CDC
counselor looking out for them and
providing a safety net.
"Ultimately, I think that will
have an immense impact especially
as some of these freshmen and soph
omores ... come to need these re
sources even more and these rela
tionships [between students and
CDC staff] really do come to
fruition," Kamisugi said.
According to Dey, the CDC does
not currently have the resources to
implement all of the programming
recommended under the Vision
2020 initiative. He said that he is in
the process of requesting more fund
ing from the University and hopes to
eventually hire more staff and ex
pand the CDC's offerings.
The next step will be to form
communities around career opportu
nities tied to employment sectors
and industries. If these frameworks
are established, which Dey hopes

will occur within the next year, stu
dents can begin networking with re
sources outside Stanford earlier in
their academic careers and gain bet
ter access to mentors, internships
and employment opportunities.
Ali pointed out that during their
times in dormitories, student clubs
and classes, students build great net
works, but those networks are com
posed almost entirely of peers.
"The reality is that once you
graduate from Stanford, you enter a
different world, which is the alumni
world," Ali said. 'And what you begin
to realize very quickly is that...
there's a whole real network of peo
ple out that are ready, willing and
able to help you achieve your profes
sional goals."
Dey said he eventually hopes to
offer CDC programming for Stan
ford graduates. For these partici
pants, the communities will be cen
tered on professional development
goals, such as improving leadership
skills or learning about entrepre
neurship.
Other future plans include en

hancing connections between poten
tial employers and Stanford, linking
students to experts in their fields and
engaging faculty in students' career
development.
"The idea is that we're helping
you explore your career options,

we're helping you connect with op
portunities [and] we're helping you

grow in your career," Dey said. "We
want the whole model of explo
ration, opportunities and profession
al development to be around this
idea of connections with the Stan
ford network."

According to CDC Director Farouk Dey, the realities of the job market
mean that career counseling services must emphasize building
connections and networks to provide support and opportunities.

The director of Career Development
Center (CDC) has begun an ambitious plan
to rethink the way career counseling is done
in higher education.
"We are launching into a path of trans
forming our model from mainly career coun
seling ... to a model that's about building ca
reer connections through career communi
ties," said Farouk Dey, who assumed control
of the CDC last April.
Late last spring, Dey appointed a steer
ing committee of students, alumni, faculty,
parents, staff and recruiters to help guide the
redesign, which Dey dubbed "Vision 2020."
"The title 'Vision 2020' is a reference to

us envisioning the next generation of career
services in higher education and envisioning
the state of career services at Stanford in the
year 2020," Dey explained.
Traditionally, University career coun

their resumes and perfect their interview
