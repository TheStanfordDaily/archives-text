# BING HOSTS STUDENT CABARET
## Students shine in Bing Studio Session 
### KATIE STRAUB 
I hurried into Bing Concert Hall last Monday evening,
a characteristically college-student-esque four min
utes late. In the lobby, a staff of ushers guided kids
down a polished marble staircase. "Don't worry
folks, we're holding for 10. Programs can be found
downstairs outside the studio," one of them said as
I passed. "And be sure to check your skateboards in the
patron cloakroom."
The evening's event was the first-ever Bing Studio
Session, a self-proclaimed "student cabaret" presented
by Stanford Live. Held in an intimate rehearsal studio
space next to the main stage, it was a decidedly different
event for Bing, whose stage is usually frequented by
world-renowned musical and artistic acts, often from
outside the University.
Instead, this was a night dedicated to celebrating
that often unsung talent everyone at Stanford seems to
have: the talent that is heard rising from the piano in
your house lounge at 2 a.m. while everyone is asleep,
echoing in quiet shower singing or whispering behind
the modestly closed doors of the neighboring dorm
room.

The evening's program was ambitious, long and
wide-ranging, covering everything from classical string
duets to rap. Scattered throughout were several regular,
expected acts on the arts circuit, like Mixed Company,

Alliance Street Dance and the Stanford Improvisers
(Simps), that each delivered enjoyable versions of the
same material for which we know and love them.

But the most delightful aspects of the program
came from student artists who haven't been seen, or at
least haven't been highlighted, before.
Standouts in this category from the evening in
cluded freshman singer/songwriter Jackie Emerson
' 17, who sat at her piano to perform an original song,
"Glass Fire in a Jar" with the sultry jazz tones of an
Adele disciple; the acoustic guitar duet by Zach Saraf
'l5 and Kyler Blue 'l5 that demonstrated a spellbind
ing ability to ease between cheerful and eerie
chords, driving tempos and lilting backbeats; and Joel
Chapman 'l4 who sang (beautifully, I might add) an
original song about what he called "that thing when you
ask a girl or guy out, but it's only in your head," sending
the audience into hoots and hollers and reminding us
how electric and interactive the nature of cabaret can
be.

The atmosphere was filled with warmth, admiration
and excitement throughout the entire evening, and I ap
plaud Stanford Live and the Bing Studio Sessions for pro
viding us with another reminder that the pursuit of arts
in student life at Stanford matters. I'll be attending next
season's session, no doubt about that.
