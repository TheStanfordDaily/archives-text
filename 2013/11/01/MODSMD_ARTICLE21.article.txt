# CONVERSATION WITH THE DIRECTOR
## Roger Ross Williams talks about his latest film, "God Loves Uganda" 
### GILLIE COLLINS 
Roger Ross Williams' latest film, "God
Loves Uganda," outlines the role of
American evangelicals in Uganda's
anti-gay movement, especially the
2009 Anti-Homosexuality Bill. The
documentary follows missionaries
from the International House of Prayer, a
Kansas City-based mega-church, as they
travel to Uganda, proselytizing against "sex
ual immorality." Arts & Life spoke to
Williams about his important, if profoundly
disturbing, new film.

Arts & Life (AL): How were you first
drawn to this topic?
Roger Ross Williams (RW): Well, I grew

up in the African American Baptist church,
from a family of ministers. When I started
hearing about what was going on with the
Anti-Homosexuality Bill and that it was fu
eled by religion, I was naturally drawn to it.
I grew up in a church that was not accepting
of my sexuality as a gay man, so I was very
sensitive to this topic.

AL: In the film, the International House of
Prayer's spokespeople seem totally sure of
their mission and methods. Did you en
counter anyone who seemed ambivalent?

RW: I think that kids who are were young
and quite naive had been in a training
course at the International House of Prayer

IHOP U, they call it for many months,
preparing for this mission. For all of them,
their life goal is to be missionaries for the rest
of their lives. I think they really strongly be
lieve.

If there were any doubt, I wouldn't have
known becaus even though it's hard to see
this in the film, my access to them was re
stricted by IHOP, just for that reason. I always
had to have an IHOP representative around,
and I could only question certain handpicked
people because they were worried about the
message.

AL: How did you pick to focus on the Interna
tional House of Prayer? Were there other or
ganizations that have been similarly active in
Uganda?

RW: There are tons, I mean, hundreds of
churches like IHOP IHOP is just one of many,
and, I have to say, they're not the... most
egregious. I chose IHOP because of Jo Anna
Watson [a missionary who has traveled to
Uganda since 2002] and Lou Engel, a well
known figure in the evangelical world. He
does "The Call," these stadium-size youth
prayer rallies mostly college kids, like your
self. His message is to empower people to
fight against abortion, homosexuality and the

threat of Islam.

AL: The movie speaks to the relationship be
tween political corruption and economic
problems in Uganda and the use of homosex
uals as a distraction from policy issues. How
are economic and political development
linked to gay rights in Uganda?
RW: Well, Uganda is unique. Uganda was tar
geted very early on, after the fall of Idi Amin,
by American conservatives [who saw Uganda]
as a country that they could actually take over.
American conservatives rebuilt the schools
and helped rebuild that country, so Ugandans
are very grateful.
Most of the members of parliament
the President and especially the First Lady of
Uganda are conservative fundamentalist
Christians. All the politicians in Uganda play
to their fundamentalist benefactors in Ameri
ca because of the flow of money.
Uganda is one of the most corrupt coun
tries in the world. [Yoweri] Museveni [cur
rent President of Uganda] is the longest-run
ning ruling dictator. They bring out the [Anti-
Homosexuality] Bill out every time they want
to distract the international community and
the public from other issues... By creating a
monster out of the vulnerable homosexual
community, it allows people to focus their
anger elsewhere, instead of on the govern
ment. So the government politicians use this
they're like, "Don't worry about the cor
ruption going on in the government or jobs or

healthcare, worry about this moral force that's
coming in to recruit your children and destroy
your lives."

AL: In your documentary, you spend some
time on the Bush and Obama administra
tions' different approaches to combating
AIDS and addressing violence against homo
sexuals in Uganda. What have other actors,
such as the United Nations and international
NGOs, done or not done to promote
human rights for LGBTQ people in Uganda?
RW: U.S. government has done a lot of
great work, but it has been quietly behind
the scenes. You know, Obama did make a
pubic statement against Uganda, and the is
sue was really important to former Secre
tary of State Hillary Clinton, who made a
groundbreaking speech that gay rights are
human rights. The State Department [has
been] quietly helping the activists on the
ground... There are many human rights or
ganizations that are working hard to stop the
bill. I think that's one of the reasons why the
bill has not passed because of the work of
all these organizations.
I think, on the other hand, the Obama
administration has allowed certain policies
that had been put in place under the Bush
administration to remain. He hasn't disman
tled them. So a lot of the PEPFAR [Presi
dent's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief] aid

going into Uganda is administered by faith
based organizations, who refuse to recognize
the LGBTI community as an "at-risk" group,
so they don't receive treatment and funding
and testing and ARVs [antiretroviral drugs].
That's a problem.

AL: Moving forward, what do you see as the
best way to fight the "culture war" in Ugan
da? Where do you see hope for mitigating the
anti-gay movement?
RW: I think, as young college students, you
guys have a great opportunity to offer an al
ternative voice. Go to Uganda you know,
go to Uganda as students in exchange pro
grams. Actually, it's just about education and
a connection. Many Ugandans believe
they've never met a homosexual... We have
a campaign right now with allout.org about
people of faith, and it's about keeping hate
out of the collection plate. People in church
es across America [may not] realize that
some of the money they think is going to
fund good works in Uganda are going to
fund intolerance and hatred. We've got to
cut off the flow of money, so that they know
that American people of faith won't stand
for intolerance or harming anyone or, heav
en forbid, killing anyone in the name of the
Bible.
