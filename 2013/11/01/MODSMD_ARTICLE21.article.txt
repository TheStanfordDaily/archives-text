# CONVERSATION WITH THE DIRECTOR
## Roger Ross Williams talks about his latest film, "God Loves Uganda" 
### GILLIE COLLINS 
Roger Ross Williams' latest film, "God
Loves Uganda," outlines the role of
American evangelicals in Uganda's
anti-gay movement, especially the
2009 Anti-Homosexuality Bill. The
documentary follows missionaries
from the International House of Prayer, a
Kansas City-based mega-church, as they
travel to Uganda, proselytizing against "sex
ual immorality." Arts & Life spoke to
Williams about his important, if profoundly
disturbing, new film.

Arts & Life (AL): How were you first
drawn to this topic?
Roger Ross Williams (RW): Well, I grew

up in the African American Baptist church,
from a family of ministers. When I started
hearing about what was going on with the
Anti-Homosexuality Bill and that it was fu
eled by religion, I was naturally drawn to it.
I grew up in a church that was not accepting
of my sexuality as a gay man, so I was very
sensitive to this topic.

AL: In the film, the International House of
Prayer's spokespeople seem totally sure of
their mission and methods. Did you en
counter anyone who seemed ambivalent?

RW: I think that kids who are were young
and quite naive had been in a training
course at the International House of Prayer
