# BOOK REVIEW
## "Allegiant" brings Roth's trilogy to a disappointing end 
### SKYLAR COHEN 
Veronica Roth's increasingly popular "Di
vergent" trilogy has been garnering mas
sive attention, with favorable comparisons
to "The Hunger Games." One would ex
pect the last novel in the series, "Alle
giant," to capitalize on the plot elements
that made previous entries a success; however, it
might be the book that ends the franchise before
it can explode in popularity. Unfortunately, she
ends up doing a disservice to both her fans and to
her own work, abusing the endless plot revela
tions to negate much of her previous efforts.
The "Divergent" novels take place in a futur
istic Chicago closed off from the outside world.
Government, social life and commerce run
through five factions, each of which focuses on a
different trait such as honesty and friendship. Fail
ure to succeed in a faction sentences one to a life
of poverty and homelessness. Heroine Beatrice
Prior discovers that she has equal aptitude for
multiple traits a phenomenon known as "di
vergence" that the intelligent Erudite faction will
do anything to eliminate from the population.
Although she has been raised by the self-sac
rificing Abnegation, Beatrice chooses to join the
courageous Dauntless when she comes of age and
renames herself Tris. Dauntless initiation tests
Tris' physical strength and her emotional convic
tion, as she is forced to fight against her friends
and explore the darker elements of her personali
ty. As her initiation comes to an end, she learns
how to harness the power of her divergence in
spite of the danger it brings and begins an unlikely
relationship with the troubled trainer Tobias. Her
hopes of leading a happy life are dashed when the
Erudite launch a war to eliminate both the Abne
gation and Divergent. As one of the only citizens
who can escape Erudite mind-control, Tris finds

herself a leader in a war where no one is a civil
ian.

Roth is an expert plotter, and the chaos that
she orchestrates is a fascinating exploration of a
war in which no side has the tools needed to win.
Tris comes across as an interesting character be
cause she is the opposite of Katniss Everdeen
sheltered but moving towards a hardened state of
maturity. Although descriptions of individual char
acters are repetitive and quite weak, large-scale
set pieces are tremendously well constructed.
The second book ends with a massive twist: The
faction system is simply an experiment created by
a larger authority to escape a mysterious, more
ominous problem.

As a result, "Allegiant" bears a much greater
weight than most final books; much of the world
building that typically occurs in first novels has to
occur in "Allegiant," and indeed it does. Although
the broken nation Roth envisions leans towards
generic dystopian fiction more than one would
hope, she fleshes out the world in a comprehen
sive fashion it feels like more characters and
terms are introduced here than in the other books
combined.

Unfortunately, Roth becomes so revisionist as
to be maddening. Some of the plot twists intro
duced in previous novels are suddenly no longer
important. It is not hard to imagine Roth haphaz-
