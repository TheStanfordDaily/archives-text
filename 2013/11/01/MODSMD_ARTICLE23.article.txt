## Color, Texture and Shine 
### LAYNIE STEPHENS FASHION COLUMNIST 
It's time to talk about what
every single outfit needs. I'm
talking every outfit you ever
wear. Ever. Ready? All it
needs are three simple com
ponents: color, texture and
shine. Are you at a point in your
life where you find yourself ago
nizing over what to wear every
morning? Or have you simply giv
en up, deciding to look like a
mess every day? Not to worry, I
am here to help! Putting togeth
er a polished and fashionable
outfit will now be as easy as one,
two, three.

1. Color: Let me stress again:
every outfit needs it. Now I
know I just wrote an article last
week about how I'd wear all
black every day if I could, but
even an all black outfit needs
some color, such as those neon
pink nails I mentioned. Add
something catching to the eyes.
What color should you wear, you
may ask? Although cobalt blue is
the it-color of the season, I'd ar
gue it's becoming overrated.
Change things up with some
soothing yet stylish colors my
favorites this season are rose and
olive. They're sophisticated, sim
ple and classy. Pink and green?
Never. But rose and olive are
their perfected shades that add
just the right amount of style to
change up your daily look.

2. Texture: Another necessity.
Please don't wear outfits com
posed of all the same texture or
materials (I'm talking sweatpants
and a sweatshirt, denim and
chambray, and those horrific
velour track suits). Adding tex
ture is a great accent to an outfit
that makes it interesting it

makes people want to look at
what you're wearing, which in
effect makes them look at you.

Easiest textures for the sea
son: knits or lace. Bonus points if
you put them together in an out
fit. Feeling bold and want to have
a lot of texture in today's look? I
dare you to whip out that stud
ded shirt you wore once and
buried in your closet —we all
know we have one, and if you
don't you better get on it. Pair it
with a basic cardigan and colored
scarf, and it will bring just the
right amount of detail to your
look.

3. Shine: We all get distracted by
shiny objects, right? As long as
you're not walking around like a
disco ball, adding a bit of shine to
every outfit is a must if you want
to get noticed. My favorite is a
patent leather flat a simple ad
dition to any outfit that truly
makes all the difference. Want to
add a little something extra? Con
sider a killer gold statement neck
lace or some metallic bracelets.
Too much for you? Even some
shiny earrings will work!
Now that you have the nec
essary inspiration, go out and be
fashionable, my people. I will be
watching for that color, texture,
and shine in your everyday looks,
so don't disappoint!

Weekly challenge: Spend more
than 30 seconds getting dressed
in the morning, and think about
what you're putting together! I'd
recommend planning your outfit
the night before —you'll thank
me the next morning you're late
to class and don't have to spend
the time searching for your shirt
again in that pile of clothes.
