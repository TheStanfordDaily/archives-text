# Top Five
## Best Netflix and Hulu comedies 
### DYLAN FUGEL 
IThis is a list for those of you who always
wondered, "What can I do to get more
laughter in my life?" Well, power up that
laptop and get ready to for an attack of the
giggles with these five underrated come
dies:

1. "Party Down" I can guarantee you that, al
though you will recognize most of this dark sit
com's actors, who range from Adam Scott ("Parks
and Recreation") and Lizzy Caplan ("True Blood,"
"New Girl") to Jane Lynch ("Glee") and Megan
Mullally ("Will and Grace"), you probably haven't
watched the show. That is a mistake. This hilari
ous comedy, which focuses on a catering compa
ny made up of people looking for their big break
in Hollywood, examines what it means to be con
stantly on the very edge of being famous in away
that few shows ever have. The writing is top
notch, and the performances are even better.
Definitely something to seek out even though it's
not currently on Netflix or Hulu. Not that I'm ad
vocating Internet piracy... but I absolutely am.
2. "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" (Netflix)
I place this on the list purely because it has never
been nominated for an Emmy. Although popular,
this show doesn't seem to have a taste which sits
well with the normally conservative Emmy voters,
which makes sense for a show whose pilot is enti
tled "The Gang Gets Racist." An incredibly dark
look at humanity at its stupidest and worst, "It's
Always Sunny" is a sitcom of brilliant dialogue and
fabulous comic set pieces. For an example of the
latter, seek out their parody of "Lethal Weapon" on
You Tube.

3. "Newsßadio" (Hulu) "Newsßadio" seems
like a fairly boring show at first glance. Set in a
small-town radio station constantly on the verge of
getting shut down, the show focuses on the mot
ley crew of workers who populate the station. But
it does the basics right. Every episode is packed
with great jokes and well-written plotlines that
don't need a ridiculous premise to set them up.

4. "Saturday Night Live" (Hulu and Netflix) —Al
though SNL is an iconic cultural institution, you
cannot go more than two You Tube comment pages
without hearing about how SNL sucks and isn't as
good as it used to be. While it would be impossible
to live up to the counter-culture madness that per
vaded its earliest iterations, castigating the current
show does a disservice to the current performers
and ignores the brilliance of the sketches that they
churn out every week. They still book the most
relevant hosts and musical guests Christoph
Waltz with Alabama Shakes last season was incred
ible and they still produce interesting sketches
with hilarious twists. For reference, seek out "Sig
ma" on the NBC website.

5. "30 Rock" (Netflix) —As "30 Rock" debuted
in 2006 when most of us were between 11 and
15, it becomes self-explanatory why many of my
friends say, "Oh, I watched a few episodes when
it came out, and I didn't get the jokes." Set be
hind the scenes of a weekly sketch comedy show
see No. 4 "30 Rock" quickly branched out
into telling hilariously warped stories about its
central characters, head writer Liz Lemon and
network suit Jack Donaghy. Immensely quotable,
it is brilliantly clever and anchored by the stand
out performances of Alec Baldwin and Tina Fey.
Queue it up on Netflix, and watch the best com
edy of the last ten years.
