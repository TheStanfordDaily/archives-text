## working Girl: Career tips from Roxy 
### 
Everywhere you look this
time of the quarter, you'll
see seniors in suits scur
rying on their way to info
sessions and interviews.
Now, Roxy's never really
been one for graduating (who
would want to leave this college
paradise of palm trees, hot TAs
and dance floor makeouts?), but
she knows some of you will be
moving on come end of spring
quarter and she wants to
make sure, in the search for
that perfect job, you maximize
your action as well as your as
sets. Here are Roxy's sugges
tions for a new and spicy
career.

Tech Company: You've surely
heard about all the fancy ameni
ties these swanky tech startups
offer on their campuses... but
all Roxy wants to know is,
where's the steam room? Take a
quick break from coding the
next big app to sneak away with
your cute team member and
work on making something else
big.

Politics: Get yourself a job on
the campaign trail in the com
ing midterm elections, and
maybe you could score a role in
the next shocking political scan
dal. Or at least get it on with
some intern-on-intern action in
the campaign bus. Stump
speech? Roxy thinks it should
be more like a hump speech ...

Graduate School: For those
humanities-inclined students
considering another two to 10
years in academia, learn to love
the tweed. If a particularly
sexy bibliography makes your
panties drop faster than Eng
land's population during the
bubonic plague, then higher
education may be the place for
you but make sure to grab
another overworked Ph.D. stu
dent to help you keep your eye
on the ball(s) during those
long, lonely nights in the li
brary.

Journalism: Print media may
be dying, but the sex life of
journalists is still alive and well.
Nothing breeds romance like
countless nights spent together
in the newsroom bring an
editor a cup of coffee (or seven
Red Bulls) and you may get
something more ... special... in
return. To the courageous few
who venture out to cover break
ing news, stop by the Daily
building during your Stanford
reunion and tell Roxy about
your above-the-fold byline ...
nothing gets Roxy more excited
below the fold.

Looking for an on-campus job?
Roxy's got one for you it's got
full benefits and highly flexible
hours (how does 10-12 pm on
Friday and Saturday nights
sound?) Let Roxy know at
