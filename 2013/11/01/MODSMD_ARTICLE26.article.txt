In the grand taxonomy of Bay
Area sushi establishments,
there is no species that beats
the wholly traditional sushi
restaurant in the rat race for
diners' approval.
Well, almost no species. In
our books, one rare breed of
restaurants is more impressive: the
off-kilter sushi bar on crack.

Take, for instance, Jin Sho. A
sparkling jewel in the culinary
crown of California Avenue, it has,
since its establishment in 2007,
been serving up delightfully irrev
erent Japanese dishes to Bay Area
connoisseurs, marrying the most
unlikely of flavors on one gloriously
lacquered sushi plate.
But you would be sorely mis
taken to think that Jin Sho is any
thing like the myriad "fusion sushi"
joints that festoon the Bay Area
food scene. Far from just another
case of culinary Tourette's, its
brand of modern Japanese cuisine
is one firmly rooted in the singular
training of an itamae, or a tradi
tional sushi chef.

"Creativity is not about simply
taking two different ingredients
and mixing them," explains chef
Noriomi Kaneko pensively, "no, no.
Creativity is about understanding
all of the finest traditional tech
niques and using them in new
ways."

Indeed, this encyclopaedic

knowledge surely is a function of
his sterling pedigree. Having spent
his formative years in his father's
fish stall, Kaneko graduated from
the prestigious Hattori Cooking
School in Tokyo, before helming
famed New York institution Nobu
for six years as executive chef. It
was there, he tells me, that he
along with fellow Jin Sho propri
etor-chef Ichiro Takahashi was
inducted into the mystical cult of
experimental Japanese cuisine.
As I sit at the sushi bar, watch
ing Kaneko's hands meld into a
mesmerising blur of rice, fish and
wasabi, his impeccable skill be
comes immediately apparent. With
in moments an immaculate piece of
sushi is delicately laid on the plate
in front of me it is otoro, or fat
ty tuna. I would have been able to
appreciate its beauteous form for a
longer period of time had I not im
mediately inhaled it; the unctuous
creaminess of tuna belly spreads
across my tongue in a glorious
wave, elevating the perfectly al
dente beads of vinegared rice to
ambrosial heights.

The veritable cavalcade of
sushi that follows is an exercise in
indulgence nonpareil. Choosing
to depart from the commonplace
salmon nigiri, Kaneko and Taka
hashi have decided to use ocean
trout, which is a lot more flavorful
and much sweeter. With a dollop of
grated wasabi tucked under the
thick slice of fish, the sushi packs
an eye-widening punch, quickly

mellowing into a sea of briny good
ness. The bonito smoked mack
erel is a sushi rarely found out
side of Japan; its complex woody
flavors are complemented by a cu
rious combination of caramelized
garlic bits and scallions, making for
an intensely savoury mouthful.
After a palate-cleansing slice of
pickled ginger, I try the butterfish,
which (as its name suggests) im
parts an impossibly creamy touch;
zested yuzu, or Japanese citron,
lifts the heavy flavors and perfectly
perfumes the rice. To end off the
sushi course, Kaneko serves up a
special treat sanma, or Pacific
saury, which he proudly tells me is
at the peak of its season now. The
delicate pink meat, streaked with
creamy fat, is at once remarkably
sweet and flavorful; indeed, its
brininess would be overwhelming,
if not for the fact that it is cut by a
smidgen of freshly grated young
ginger.

The next course that Kaneko

prepares is Jin Sho's signature dish
yellowtail tuna with jalapeno
and a yuzu, -soy dressing. Think
ing of my food purist friends, who
would doubtless burn me at the
stake (hand-carved by an old Japan
ese craftsman and made with bam
boo from the gardens of a Japanese
monastery, no less) for my culinary
heresy, I cautiously pick up a slice
of fish and taste it. It is nothing
short of breathtaking; the floral
yuzu brings out the yellowtail's del
icate sweetness, and the leaf-thin
sliver of jalapeno leaves just
enough of a spicy tingle on the
tongue to make me sit up.

The final course is a clear nod
towards Kaneko and Takahashi's
former mentor; pan-seared black
cod with miso glaze is, after all,
Nobu Matsuhisa's brainchild. The
fish, Kaneko tells me, has been
marinated in a homemade miso re
duction for three full days. As I tap
the perfectly crisped skin with my
chopsticks, it crackles and gives

way to a flaky, ivory interior, glis
tening with juices. The combina
tion of the caramelized glaze with
the rich, toothsome meat prevents
it from being too heavy, as cod of
ten can be. Shibazuke , a Kyoto
specialty of cucumbers strips pick
led in plum vinegar, finishes the
meal on a light, refreshing touch.
Jin Sho is a delightfully unfussy
experience, presenting modern
Japanese cuisine with none of the
pretension of its East Coast coun
terparts. And lest you find yourself
asking the question, "Is that a wal
let in your pocket, or are you just
happy sushi me?," we should point
out that for such fine cuisine, the
prices are an incredible pittance.
Without a doubt, this off-kilter
sushi bar —with its alchemical dish
es, sake selection and larger-than-life
chefs truly is the place to go
when the sushi cravings strike.

lifts the heavy flavors and perfectly
perfumes the rice. To end off the
sushi course, Kaneko serves up a
special treat sanma, or Pacific
saury, which he proudly tells me is
at the peak of its season now. The
delicate pink meat, streaked with
creamy fat, is at once remarkably
sweet and flavorful; indeed, its
brininess would be overwhelming,
if not for the fact that it is cut by a
smidgen of freshly grated young
ginger.

The next course that Kaneko

prepares is Jin Sho's signature dish
yellowtail tuna with jalapeno
and a yuzu, -soy dressing. Think
ing of my food purist friends, who
would doubtless burn me at the
stake (hand-carved by an old Japan
ese craftsman and made with bam
boo from the gardens of a Japanese
monastery, no less) for my culinary
heresy, I cautiously pick up a slice
of fish and taste it. It is nothing
short of breathtaking; the floral
yuzu brings out the yellowtail's del
icate sweetness, and the leaf-thin
sliver of jalapeno leaves just
enough of a spicy tingle on the
tongue to make me sit up.

The final course is a clear nod
towards Kaneko and Takahashi's
former mentor; pan-seared black
cod with miso glaze is, after all,
Nobu Matsuhisa's brainchild. The
fish, Kaneko tells me, has been
marinated in a homemade miso re
duction for three full days. As I tap
the perfectly crisped skin with my
chopsticks, it crackles and gives

way to a flaky, ivory interior, glis
tening with juices. The combina
tion of the caramelized glaze with
the rich, toothsome meat prevents
it from being too heavy, as cod of
ten can be. Shibazuke , a Kyoto
specialty of cucumbers strips pick
led in plum vinegar, finishes the
meal on a light, refreshing touch.
Jin Sho is a delightfully unfussy
experience, presenting modern
Japanese cuisine with none of the
pretension of its East Coast coun
terparts. And lest you find yourself
asking the question, "Is that a wal
let in your pocket, or are you just
happy sushi me?," we should point
out that for such fine cuisine, the
prices are an incredible pittance.
Without a doubt, this off-kilter
sushi bar —with its alchemical dish
es, sake selection and larger-than-life
chefs truly is the place to go
when the sushi cravings strike.

In the grand taxonomy of Bay
Area sushi establishments,
there is no species that beats
the wholly traditional sushi
restaurant in the rat race for
diners' approval.
Well, almost no species. In
our books, one rare breed of
restaurants is more impressive: the
off-kilter sushi bar on crack.

Take, for instance, Jin Sho. A
sparkling jewel in the culinary
crown of California Avenue, it has,
since its establishment in 2007,
been serving up delightfully irrev
erent Japanese dishes to Bay Area
connoisseurs, marrying the most
unlikely of flavors on one gloriously
lacquered sushi plate.
But you would be sorely mis
taken to think that Jin Sho is any
thing like the myriad "fusion sushi"
joints that festoon the Bay Area
food scene. Far from just another
case of culinary Tourette's, its
brand of modern Japanese cuisine
is one firmly rooted in the singular
training of an itamae, or a tradi
tional sushi chef.

"Creativity is not about simply
taking two different ingredients
and mixing them," explains chef
Noriomi Kaneko pensively, "no, no.
Creativity is about understanding
all of the finest traditional tech
niques and using them in new
ways."

Indeed, this encyclopaedic

knowledge surely is a function of
his sterling pedigree. Having spent
his formative years in his father's
fish stall, Kaneko graduated from
the prestigious Hattori Cooking
School in Tokyo, before helming
famed New York institution Nobu
for six years as executive chef. It
was there, he tells me, that he
along with fellow Jin Sho propri
etor-chef Ichiro Takahashi was
inducted into the mystical cult of
experimental Japanese cuisine.
As I sit at the sushi bar, watch
ing Kaneko's hands meld into a
mesmerising blur of rice, fish and
wasabi, his impeccable skill be
comes immediately apparent. With
in moments an immaculate piece of
sushi is delicately laid on the plate
in front of me it is otoro, or fat
ty tuna. I would have been able to
appreciate its beauteous form for a
longer period of time had I not im
mediately inhaled it; the unctuous
creaminess of tuna belly spreads
across my tongue in a glorious
wave, elevating the perfectly al
dente beads of vinegared rice to
ambrosial heights.

The veritable cavalcade of
sushi that follows is an exercise in
indulgence nonpareil. Choosing
to depart from the commonplace
salmon nigiri, Kaneko and Taka
hashi have decided to use ocean
trout, which is a lot more flavorful
and much sweeter. With a dollop of
grated wasabi tucked under the
thick slice of fish, the sushi packs
an eye-widening punch, quickly

mellowing into a sea of briny good
ness. The bonito smoked mack
erel is a sushi rarely found out
side of Japan; its complex woody
flavors are complemented by a cu
rious combination of caramelized
garlic bits and scallions, making for
an intensely savoury mouthful.
After a palate-cleansing slice of
pickled ginger, I try the butterfish,
which (as its name suggests) im
parts an impossibly creamy touch;
zested yuzu, or Japanese citron,
lifts the heavy flavors and perfectly
perfumes the rice. To end off the
sushi course, Kaneko serves up a
special treat sanma, or Pacific
saury, which he proudly tells me is
