# Social impact careers need support
## ASSU, Haas Center and CDC collaborate 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU is teaming up with the
Haas Center for Public Service and the
Career Development Center (CDC) to im
prove the support for students looking for
careers in the fields of public service and
social impact.

"Most career paths are very well-de
fined, so if I say lawyer or banker... you
know that you have to go to a certain
school after college or you don't, and you
go to a certain recruiting mechanism that
really holds your hand and takes you
through the whole process," said Eliza
beth Woodson 'l5, the ASSU's social im
pact manager. "These pathways don't nec
essarily exist for [social impact careers]."

A member of the ASSU executive
cabinet, Woodson uses the term "social
impact" to encompass both traditional
public service work like non-profit jobs,

but also social entrepreneurship, for-profit
businesses and other work that has a pos
itive impact on the world.
"It does get into a little gray area,
which we want to embrace," Woodson ex
plained. "We'll kind of have to invent it as
we go along, but we want to be inclusive
of many different models."

Irregular cycles of recruitment
CDC Director Farouk Dey said that
there is significant interest in social im-
pact among students, but that
searching for a career in social im
pact fields can often pose unique
challenges. He pointed out that for
companies that hire hundreds of
graduates a year, the path to em
ployment is clear. For public service
organizations that hire only when
they need an employee, the cycle of
recruitment can be murkier.

According to Haas Center
postgraduate public service pro
gram director Jim Murray, even
though Stanford hosts approxi
mately 15 different career fairs a
year, for small organizations, send
ing a staff member to recruit can
be a significant investment.
For this reason, Murray said some
of the most successful events are
those that target specific popula
tions, such as the Year of Service
Fair, and attract students who are
proactively interested in one-to
two year public service opportuni
ties. Murray said that the fair re
ceived record attendance this year
after the ASSU publicized it on
their senior website.

Misconceptions about the field
Woodson said that her work at

the Impact Career Initiatives at the
Aspen Institute taught her that
across the country, students battle
misconceptions about the level of
prestige and pay associated with
working in non-profits.
In early October, Woodson
hosted three lunch discussions
about social impact careers that
were attended by a total of more
than 70 students. Woodson said
these meetings reaffirmed that
Stanford students feel many of the
same pressures and frustrations.

Connecting students to resources
Nora Jendoubi 'l4, who
worked closely with Woodson, de
scribed herself as "a living example
of someone who was really pas
sionate about [social impact] and
wanted to devote my life to it, but
was failing to find the resources to
connect me with that world."
While the Haas Center and
the CDC offer a multitude of op
portunities, they can often be diffi
cult for students to access when
the resources are widely dis
persed. Woodson and Jendoubi
said that they are pushing for the
CDC to include a social impact tab
on its website as well as informa
tion about potential ways to have
an impact within other fields.

"Part of the frustration is that
students don't know of all the differ

ent opportunities available," Murray
said. "We try to promote [them] on
our website and through email but
there's so many different resources
on campus."
Last summer, the Haas Center
upgraded its Fellowships, Intern
ships and Service Programs data
base. The database, which can be
accessed by anyone with an SUID,
allows students to browse through
over 500 opportunities and sub
scribe to receive updates from the
ones that interest them.

According to Murray, not only
will this database provide access to
opportunities for students, but it
will also allow the Haas Center to
track which organizations are most
appealing to students.

Finding solutions
As part of the overall organiza
tional redesign, Dey said the CDC
would be working with the Haas
Center to emphasize engaging with
non-profits and social impact organ
izations and encouraging them to
recruit on campus.

Woodson said that she also

wants to continue building connec
tions among students interested in
similar career paths.
"I hope that through... con
necting people to what they're in
terested, it will spread the conversa
tion and get that going more,"
Woodson said. "Going forward, [stu
dents] will hear stories of people
who they respected going into McK
inseys and finance, but they'll also
be able to hear success stories of
peers who were able to find careers
through Stanford CDC and Haas in
social impact, and that will hopefully
multiply as the years go on."
Murray said that the most im
portant idea was to focus on tangi
ble solutions that match the needs
and expectations of students, Stan
ford career staff and external or
ganizations.

"There's tremendous inter
est," Dey said. "We need to be better
about building connections and we
need to be better at increasing the re
sources for students in those areas."

will this database provide access to
opportunities for students, but it
will also allow the Haas Center to
track which organizations are most
appealing to students.

Finding solutions
As part of the overall organiza
tional redesign, Dey said the CDC
would be working with the Haas
Center to emphasize engaging with
non-profits and social impact organ
izations and encouraging them to
recruit on campus.

Woodson said that she also

wants to continue building connec
tions among students interested in
similar career paths.
"I hope that through... con
necting people to what they're in
terested, it will spread the conversa
tion and get that going more,"
Woodson said. "Going forward, [stu
dents] will hear stories of people
who they respected going into McK
inseys and finance, but they'll also
be able to hear success stories of
peers who were able to find careers
through Stanford CDC and Haas in
social impact, and that will hopefully
multiply as the years go on."
Murray said that the most im
portant idea was to focus on tangi
ble solutions that match the needs
and expectations of students, Stan
ford career staff and external or
ganizations.

"There's tremendous inter
est," Dey said. "We need to be better
about building connections and we
need to be better at increasing the re
sources for students in those areas."

In an effort to develop earlier connections with students, the Career
Development Center has been hosting regular meetups in dorms and
dining halls for students and counselors to discuss career preparation.

The ASSU is teaming up with the
Haas Center for Public Service and the
Career Development Center (CDC) to im
prove the support for students looking for
careers in the fields of public service and
social impact.

"Most career paths are very well-de
fined, so if I say lawyer or banker... you
know that you have to go to a certain
school after college or you don't, and you
go to a certain recruiting mechanism that
really holds your hand and takes you
through the whole process," said Eliza
beth Woodson 'l5, the ASSU's social im
pact manager. "These pathways don't nec
essarily exist for [social impact careers]."

A member of the ASSU executive
cabinet, Woodson uses the term "social
impact" to encompass both traditional
public service work like non-profit jobs,

but also social entrepreneurship, for-profit
businesses and other work that has a pos
itive impact on the world.
"It does get into a little gray area,
which we want to embrace," Woodson ex
plained. "We'll kind of have to invent it as
we go along, but we want to be inclusive
of many different models."

Irregular cycles of recruitment
CDC Director Farouk Dey said that
there is significant interest in social im-
pact among students, but that
searching for a career in social im
pact fields can often pose unique
challenges. He pointed out that for
companies that hire hundreds of
graduates a year, the path to em
ployment is clear. For public service
organizations that hire only when
they need an employee, the cycle of
recruitment can be murkier.

According to Haas Center
postgraduate public service pro
gram director Jim Murray, even
though Stanford hosts approxi
mately 15 different career fairs a
year, for small organizations, send
ing a staff member to recruit can
be a significant investment.
For this reason, Murray said some
of the most successful events are
those that target specific popula
tions, such as the Year of Service
Fair, and attract students who are
proactively interested in one-to
two year public service opportuni
ties. Murray said that the fair re
ceived record attendance this year
after the ASSU publicized it on
their senior website.

Misconceptions about the field
Woodson said that her work at

the Impact Career Initiatives at the
Aspen Institute taught her that
across the country, students battle
misconceptions about the level of
prestige and pay associated with
working in non-profits.
In early October, Woodson
hosted three lunch discussions
about social impact careers that
were attended by a total of more
than 70 students. Woodson said
these meetings reaffirmed that
Stanford students feel many of the
same pressures and frustrations.

Connecting students to resources
Nora Jendoubi 'l4, who
worked closely with Woodson, de
scribed herself as "a living example
of someone who was really pas
sionate about [social impact] and
wanted to devote my life to it, but
was failing to find the resources to
connect me with that world."
While the Haas Center and
the CDC offer a multitude of op
portunities, they can often be diffi
cult for students to access when
the resources are widely dis
persed. Woodson and Jendoubi
said that they are pushing for the
CDC to include a social impact tab
on its website as well as informa
tion about potential ways to have
an impact within other fields.

"Part of the frustration is that
students don't know of all the differ

ent opportunities available," Murray
said. "We try to promote [them] on
our website and through email but
there's so many different resources
on campus."
Last summer, the Haas Center
upgraded its Fellowships, Intern
ships and Service Programs data
base. The database, which can be
accessed by anyone with an SUID,
allows students to browse through
over 500 opportunities and sub
scribe to receive updates from the
ones that interest them.

According to Murray, not only
will this database provide access to
opportunities for students, but it
will also allow the Haas Center to
track which organizations are most
appealing to students.
