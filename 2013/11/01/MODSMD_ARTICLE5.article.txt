# Prep required for interviews
## Finance, consulting notorious for rigorous process 
### SAM KURLAND 
Finance and consulting are
among the most popular careers for
Stanford students after graduation,
but the interview process for posi
tions in these highly competitive
fields is notoriously challenging. The
Stanford Career Development Cen
ter (CDC) and student organizations
including Stanford Finance and Stan
ford Consulting provide a variety of

resources for Stanford students
preparing for these interviews.

The stress test

For many juniors and seniors,
applying for jobs in these industries
during fall quarter is akin to taking to
an additional class. With weekly in
terviews sometimes two or three
per companyâ€”involving case stud
ies and other mental tests, preparing
for the interview process can be
quite stressful.
"The interview process is very
challenging," said Julia Schottenstein
'l4, CEO of Stanford Finance. "They
are definitely trying to test you, to

put you in high pressure situations
because the job itself is pretty stress
ful. They are trying to gauge how
you think on your feet and how well
you know your finance technicals
before you even start the job."
In fact, taking a lighter course
load in order to maximize prepara
tion time is a serious consideration
for applicants.
"Before I went into my inter
views, I didn't realize how much you
actually need to know going into the
[interview] process," Schottenstein
said. "They expect that you are ready
and up to speed to start your job as
an analyst."
According to some students,
however, the actual test comes
when you receive a question you
didn't prepare for.
"The worst thing that can hap
pen in an interview is to have some
thing unexpected," said Publio Adri
anza' 15, Managing Director of Stan
ford Consulting.

Eric Feldman 'l4 has inter
viewed for positions in both finance
and consulting.
"There is a set of questions that
you can reasonably expect, and then
there are some off-the-wall ques
tions," he said. "In order to do well,
you have to be good at improvising,
which takes a certain degree of social
awareness."

According to Schottenstein, it is
not uncommon for interviewers to
try and trick applicants with difficult
or out-of-the-box questions.
"There have definitely been
times in interviews where they give
you trick questions or expect you to
do complicated mental math on the
spot," Schottenstein said. "Some
times they are seeing if you can do
the mental math, other times they
are seeing what your thought
process is when you're not fully
equipped to solve the problem quite
yet."

Feldman also described some of
the differences between finance and
consulting interviews.
