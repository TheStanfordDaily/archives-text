# Prep required for interviews
## Finance, consulting notorious for rigorous process 
### SAM KURLAND 
Finance and consulting are
among the most popular careers for
Stanford students after graduation,
but the interview process for posi
tions in these highly competitive
fields is notoriously challenging. The
Stanford Career Development Cen
ter (CDC) and student organizations
including Stanford Finance and Stan
ford Consulting provide a variety of

resources for Stanford students
preparing for these interviews.

The stress test

For many juniors and seniors,
applying for jobs in these industries
during fall quarter is akin to taking to
an additional class. With weekly in
terviews sometimes two or three
per company—involving case stud
ies and other mental tests, preparing
for the interview process can be
quite stressful.
"The interview process is very
challenging," said Julia Schottenstein
'l4, CEO of Stanford Finance. "They
are definitely trying to test you, to

put you in high pressure situations
because the job itself is pretty stress
ful. They are trying to gauge how
you think on your feet and how well
you know your finance technicals
before you even start the job."
In fact, taking a lighter course
load in order to maximize prepara
tion time is a serious consideration
for applicants.
"Before I went into my inter
views, I didn't realize how much you
actually need to know going into the
[interview] process," Schottenstein
said. "They expect that you are ready
and up to speed to start your job as
an analyst."
According to some students,
however, the actual test comes
when you receive a question you
didn't prepare for.
"The worst thing that can hap
pen in an interview is to have some
thing unexpected," said Publio Adri
anza' 15, Managing Director of Stan
ford Consulting.

Eric Feldman 'l4 has inter
viewed for positions in both finance
and consulting.
"There is a set of questions that
you can reasonably expect, and then
there are some off-the-wall ques
tions," he said. "In order to do well,
you have to be good at improvising,
which takes a certain degree of social
awareness."

According to Schottenstein, it is
not uncommon for interviewers to
try and trick applicants with difficult
or out-of-the-box questions.
"There have definitely been
times in interviews where they give
you trick questions or expect you to
do complicated mental math on the
spot," Schottenstein said. "Some
times they are seeing if you can do
the mental math, other times they
are seeing what your thought
process is when you're not fully
equipped to solve the problem quite
yet."

Feldman also described some of
the differences between finance and
consulting interviews.

"The interviews in the consult

ing process are more conducive to
testing your problem solving skills,"
he said. "In finance, if you get a
book, you can study the formulas
and get it. There is some critical
thinking involved, but less so [than
in consulting]."

The Career Development Center
To help students prepare for the
rigorous finance and consulting inter
view process, the Stanford Career
Development Center (CDC) offers a
variety of free interview preparation
services for students, including mock
interviews with CDC counselors, in
terview workshops and access to on
line tools, including Vault Career In
sider and Interview Stream. The CDC
also maintains a list of frequently
asked interview questions and other
resources on its website.

Vault Career Insider provides a
large collection of information for job
seekers in a variety of fields, including
finance and consulting. Access in
cludes free download of the popular
Vault Guides for job seekers, includ
ing the "Vault Guide to the Case In
terview" for consulting roles and the
"Vault Guide to Finance Interviews."

"The Vault Guide will tip you off
on common questions to prepare [for
finance interviews]," Schottenstein
said. "It's a pretty comprehensive
guide on the basic questions or topics
you need to know about walking into
a finance interview."
Interview Stream allows users to
practice pre-recorded mock inter
views, using their webcam to record
their performance for self-evaluation.
The tool also lets interviewees share
their recordings with friends and fam
ily for feedback.
Some of Stanford's peer institu
tions have developed programs to en
courage student-to-student mentor
ship and preparation. For example,
Yale Undergraduate Career Services'
website invites students to share in
ternship evaluations and reflections
on their interview experiences for
the benefit of other students, while
the Wharton School of Business pays

20 to 30 current MBA students to
lead mock interviews of students dur
ing an annual career readiness event.
Barbara Hewitt, senior associate
director of career Services for under
graduates of the Wharton School of
Business, explained that Wharton's
program was started to meet the high
demand for traditional mock inter
views with career advising staff.
'A lot of our recruiting is front
loaded in the fall for seniors and in
the spring for underclass students for
internships," she said, "so we have
found it really difficult to fit enough
[mock interviews] in, because there's
just not enough time once the semes
ter gets going."

Student organizations
Two student groups, Stanford Fi
nance and Stanford Consulting, pro
vide opportunities for students to
practice for interviews, network with
current industry members and gain
exposure to the work and topics typ
ically encountered at finance and con
sulting firms.

Stanford Finance holds events to
help members meet and get to know
people currently working in the fi
nance industry before they formally
begin the interview process.
"We have a really strong mentor
ship program," said Schottenstein.
"All of our analysts get paired with a
mentor on the board."

"[Networking] is really impor
tant in finance," Schottenstein added.
"Before I went through recruiting, I
thought that if I had good grades or if
I just checked off a few certain boxes,
I could just hand in my resume and
get through the interview process. In
finance, it's a lot more about who you
know in the industry."
Stanford Consulting, on the oth
er hand, aims to give its members
hands-on exposure to consulting
work long before they begin the inter
view process.

"Traditionally, we have focused a
lot on working with partner compa
nies to actually work with them on
business issues and help provide rec
ommendations to them and help with
problems that they have," said Vivian
Shen 'l4, CEO of Stanford Consulting
and former McKinsey & Company in
tern. "What I've found is that actually

mirrors the experience that you have
at a real firm pretty similarly."

Shen said that Stanford Consult
ing exposes its members to as many
business cases as possible. "The more
cases you look at, the more business
problems you have in your arsenal
that you think of when someone asks
you a question," she said, 'And if
you've seen something similar to it
before, it's not as frightening, and
you'll have an idea of how you'll at
tack the problem."

Landing the job
Most finance and consulting
firms have two independent inter
view processes: a process for summer
internships, targeted principally at
current juniors, and a separate
process for current seniors interested
in full-time positions after graduation.
Ordinarily, consulting firms in
terview juniors during the winter
quarter for summer internships and
seniors during the fall quarter for full
time positions.

Most finance firms interview
juniors during fall and winter quarters
for summer internships. After solicit
ing resumes, firms may conduct an
initial phone screening before inviting
applicants to a first-round interview.
According to Schottenstein, many
New York firms will fly applicants to
New York for a day to interview in
person. Successful candidates are of
ten invited back for a "super day" of
multiple second-round interviews.
The interview process can be
particularly rigorous for those who do
not follow the typical summer intern
ship track into a full time position
with the same firm. "I met with 30
plus bankers before I was offered a
position," Schottenstein said of her
experience applying at Qatalyst Part
ners following her summer intern
ship at Morgan Stanley.

And the final result full-time
finance positions are typically of
fered to selected interns in the mid
dle of fall quarter of senior year or at
the end of their junior summer.
"At the end of [the internship],
you either get an offer to return or
you don't," Schottenstein explained.

Landing the job
Most finance and consulting
firms have two independent inter
view processes: a process for summer
internships, targeted principally at
current juniors, and a separate
process for current seniors interested
in full-time positions after graduation.
Ordinarily, consulting firms in
terview juniors during the winter
quarter for summer internships and
seniors during the fall quarter for full
time positions.

Most finance firms interview
juniors during fall and winter quarters
for summer internships. After solicit
ing resumes, firms may conduct an
initial phone screening before inviting
applicants to a first-round interview.
According to Schottenstein, many
New York firms will fly applicants to
New York for a day to interview in
person. Successful candidates are of
ten invited back for a "super day" of
multiple second-round interviews.
The interview process can be
particularly rigorous for those who do
not follow the typical summer intern
ship track into a full time position
with the same firm. "I met with 30
plus bankers before I was offered a
position," Schottenstein said of her
experience applying at Qatalyst Part
ners following her summer intern
ship at Morgan Stanley.

And the final result full-time
finance positions are typically of
fered to selected interns in the mid

the end of their junior summer.
"At the end of [the internship],
you either get an offer to return or
you don't," Schottenstein explained.

Finance and consulting are
among the most popular careers for
Stanford students after graduation,
but the interview process for posi
tions in these highly competitive
fields is notoriously challenging. The
Stanford Career Development Cen
ter (CDC) and student organizations
including Stanford Finance and Stan
ford Consulting provide a variety of

resources for Stanford students
preparing for these interviews.

The stress test

For many juniors and seniors,
applying for jobs in these industries
during fall quarter is akin to taking to
an additional class. With weekly in
terviews sometimes two or three
per company—involving case stud
ies and other mental tests, preparing
for the interview process can be
quite stressful.
"The interview process is very
challenging," said Julia Schottenstein
'l4, CEO of Stanford Finance. "They
are definitely trying to test you, to

put you in high pressure situations
because the job itself is pretty stress
ful. They are trying to gauge how
you think on your feet and how well
you know your finance technicals
before you even start the job."
In fact, taking a lighter course
load in order to maximize prepara
tion time is a serious consideration
for applicants.
"Before I went into my inter
views, I didn't realize how much you
actually need to know going into the
[interview] process," Schottenstein
said. "They expect that you are ready
and up to speed to start your job as
an analyst."
According to some students,
however, the actual test comes
when you receive a question you
didn't prepare for.
"The worst thing that can hap
pen in an interview is to have some
thing unexpected," said Publio Adri
anza' 15, Managing Director of Stan
ford Consulting.

Eric Feldman 'l4 has inter
viewed for positions in both finance
and consulting.
"There is a set of questions that
you can reasonably expect, and then
there are some off-the-wall ques
tions," he said. "In order to do well,
you have to be good at improvising,
which takes a certain degree of social
awareness."

According to Schottenstein, it is
not uncommon for interviewers to
try and trick applicants with difficult
or out-of-the-box questions.
"There have definitely been
times in interviews where they give
you trick questions or expect you to
do complicated mental math on the
spot," Schottenstein said. "Some
times they are seeing if you can do
the mental math, other times they
are seeing what your thought
process is when you're not fully
equipped to solve the problem quite
yet."

Feldman also described some of
the differences between finance and
consulting interviews.

The Career Development Center
To help students prepare for the
rigorous finance and consulting inter
view process, the Stanford Career
Development Center (CDC) offers a
variety of free interview preparation
services for students, including mock
interviews with CDC counselors, in
terview workshops and access to on

also maintains a list of frequently

resources on its website.

Vault Career Insider provides a
large collection of information for job

Vault Guides for job seekers, includ
ing the "Vault Guide to the Case In

"Vault Guide to Finance Interviews."

"The Vault Guide will tip you off
on common questions to prepare [for
finance interviews]," Schottenstein
said. "It's a pretty comprehensive
guide on the basic questions or topics
you need to know about walking into
a finance interview."
Interview Stream allows users to
practice pre-recorded mock inter
views, using their webcam to record
their performance for self-evaluation.
The tool also lets interviewees share
their recordings with friends and fam
ily for feedback.
Some of Stanford's peer institu
tions have developed programs to en
courage student-to-student mentor
ship and preparation. For example,
Yale Undergraduate Career Services'
website invites students to share in
ternship evaluations and reflections
on their interview experiences for
the benefit of other students, while
the Wharton School of Business pays

20 to 30 current MBA students to
lead mock interviews of students dur
ing an annual career readiness event.
Barbara Hewitt, senior associate
director of career Services for under
graduates of the Wharton School of
Business, explained that Wharton's
program was started to meet the high
demand for traditional mock inter
views with career advising staff.
'A lot of our recruiting is front
loaded in the fall for seniors and in
the spring for underclass students for
internships," she said, "so we have
found it really difficult to fit enough
[mock interviews] in, because there's
just not enough time once the semes
ter gets going."

Student organizations
Two student groups, Stanford Fi
nance and Stanford Consulting, pro
vide opportunities for students to
practice for interviews, network with
current industry members and gain
exposure to the work and topics typ
ically encountered at finance and con
sulting firms.

Stanford Finance holds events to
help members meet and get to know
people currently working in the fi
nance industry before they formally
begin the interview process.
"We have a really strong mentor
ship program," said Schottenstein.
"All of our analysts get paired with a
mentor on the board."

"[Networking] is really impor
tant in finance," Schottenstein added.
"Before I went through recruiting, I
thought that if I had good grades or if
I just checked off a few certain boxes,
I could just hand in my resume and
get through the interview process. In
finance, it's a lot more about who you
know in the industry."
Stanford Consulting, on the oth
er hand, aims to give its members
hands-on exposure to consulting
work long before they begin the inter
view process.

"Traditionally, we have focused a
lot on working with partner compa
nies to actually work with them on

a finance interview."
Interview Stream allows users to
practice pre-recorded mock inter
views, using their webcam to record
their performance for self-evaluation.
The tool also lets interviewees share
their recordings with friends and fam
ily for feedback.
Some of Stanford's peer institu
tions have developed programs to en
courage student-to-student mentor
ship and preparation. For example,
Yale Undergraduate Career Services'
website invites students to share in
ternship evaluations and reflections
on their interview experiences for
the benefit of other students, while
the Wharton School of Business pays

20 to 30 current MBA students to
lead mock interviews of students dur
ing an annual career readiness event.
Barbara Hewitt, senior associate
director of career Services for under
graduates of the Wharton School of
Business, explained that Wharton's
program was started to meet the high
demand for traditional mock inter
views with career advising staff.
'A lot of our recruiting is front
loaded in the fall for seniors and in
the spring for underclass students for
internships," she said, "so we have
found it really difficult to fit enough
[mock interviews] in, because there's
just not enough time once the semes
ter gets going."

Student organizations
Two student groups, Stanford Fi
nance and Stanford Consulting, pro
vide opportunities for students to
practice for interviews, network with
current industry members and gain
exposure to the work and topics typ
ically encountered at finance and con
sulting firms.

Stanford Finance holds events to
help members meet and get to know
people currently working in the fi
nance industry before they formally
begin the interview process.
"We have a really strong mentor
ship program," said Schottenstein.
"All of our analysts get paired with a
mentor on the board."

"[Networking] is really impor
tant in finance," Schottenstein added.
"Before I went through recruiting, I
thought that if I had good grades or if
I just checked off a few certain boxes,
I could just hand in my resume and
get through the interview process. In
finance, it's a lot more about who you
know in the industry."
Stanford Consulting, on the oth
er hand, aims to give its members
hands-on exposure to consulting
work long before they begin the inter
view process.

"Traditionally, we have focused a
lot on working with partner compa
nies to actually work with them on
business issues and help provide rec
ommendations to them and help with
problems that they have," said Vivian
Shen 'l4, CEO of Stanford Consulting
and former McKinsey & Company in
tern. "What I've found is that actually

mirrors the experience that you have
at a real firm pretty similarly."

Shen said that Stanford Consult
ing exposes its members to as many
business cases as possible. "The more
cases you look at, the more business
problems you have in your arsenal
that you think of when someone asks
you a question," she said, 'And if
you've seen something similar to it
before, it's not as frightening, and
you'll have an idea of how you'll at
tack the problem."

Landing the job
Most finance and consulting
firms have two independent inter
view processes: a process for summer
internships, targeted principally at
current juniors, and a separate
process for current seniors interested
in full-time positions after graduation.
Ordinarily, consulting firms in
terview juniors during the winter
quarter for summer internships and
seniors during the fall quarter for full
time positions.

Most finance firms interview
juniors during fall and winter quarters
for summer internships. After solicit
ing resumes, firms may conduct an
initial phone screening before inviting
applicants to a first-round interview.
According to Schottenstein, many
New York firms will fly applicants to
New York for a day to interview in
person. Successful candidates are of
ten invited back for a "super day" of
multiple second-round interviews.
The interview process can be
particularly rigorous for those who do
not follow the typical summer intern
ship track into a full time position
with the same firm. "I met with 30
plus bankers before I was offered a
position," Schottenstein said of her
experience applying at Qatalyst Part
ners following her summer intern
ship at Morgan Stanley.

And the final result full-time
finance positions are typically of
fered to selected interns in the mid
dle of fall quarter of senior year or at
the end of their junior summer.
"At the end of [the internship],
you either get an offer to return or
you don't," Schottenstein explained.
