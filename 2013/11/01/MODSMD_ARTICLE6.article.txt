# Going pro in something other than sports

On Nov. 5, over 25 employers
will visit Stanford for a career fair
held exclusively for Cardinal stu
dent-athletes, one of the resources
Stanford provides to help student
athletes prepare for life after col
lege.

While the time constraints of
being on a varsity sport can make it

difficult for student-athletes to par
ticipate in extracurriculars or intern
ships, the skills athletes develop in
their sports can often be positively
marketed towards employers.
According to Kathy Campbell,
an associate director at the Career
Development Center (CDC) and
Stanford liaison to athletes, one of

Former Cardinal basketball player Morgan Clyburn '09 said that Stanford
prepared her well for her later career as a senior development engineer.
the highlights of her job is when
athletes come to the realization
that they have the skills to be com
petitive and successful in a work
environment.

In order to reach this point,
Stanford offers a variety of support
systems for student-athletes. The
hub of this support is the Athletic
Academic Resource Center
(AARC), which offers study tables,
tutoring and advising services for
varsity athletes at the Arrillaga
Center for Sports and Recreation.
In their freshman year, all ath
letes are required to participate in
a course called Partners for Aca
demic Excellence (PAE) that is of
fered through the AARC. PAE helps
students balance their academic
classes and their athletic commit
ments by teaching them how to ef
fectively manage their limited free
time. PAE creates groups of several
student-athletes with similar aca
demic interests and provides them
with mentors who are usually cur
rent or former student-athletes.

"It's really helpful to have a re
source who has been in the posi
tion I am in now," says Joey Star
ling 'l7, a member of the Stanford
baseball team. "The class is a good
way to meet athletes from other
teams and to be with people who
are going through the same transi
tion period I am."

Student-athletes are also
taught skills such as how to build a
resume, how to present oneself
through social media and how to
market themselves to employers.

While the time constraints can
be difficult, Campbell said that
there are aspects of the student
athlete experience that look very
attractive to employers if they are
packaged properly. Counselors
help athletes emphasize what they
learned from their experience in
sports in their applications, and
what skills are transferable to a
workplace environment.
"We highlight teamwork, the
ability to set individual and team

goals, the ability to handle high
pressure situations and the ability
to multitask and balance a variety
of commitments," Campbell said.
"These are all skills employers are
looking for, but it is up to the ath
lete to present their experience in
that light."
Morgan Clyburn 'O9, who
played on the women's varsity bas
ketball team and majored in biome
chanical engineering, is now a sen
ior development engineer for a
medical startup in the Bay Area.
Clyburn said that Stanford was ex
ceptionally helpful in making life as
a student-athlete as manageable as
possible and helping her transition
into her desired career.

"Stanford goes above and be
yond to make sure that the stu
dent-athlete has a rewarding expe
rience in both academics and ath
letics," Clyburn said. She added
that the women's basketball com
munity helped her start network
ing.

"In terms of finding a job, I
learned so many life lessons from
being a student athlete at Stan
ford," says Clyburn. "Being a com
petitor, understanding what it
means to be on a team and having
strong academics behind me

those are the things that helped
me build my resume."
