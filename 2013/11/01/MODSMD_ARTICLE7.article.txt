# letter From the Editor
## On our coverage of FloMo 
### 
Dear reader,

OOn Oct. 30, The Daily broke
news of widespread stomach
illness in Florence Moore Hall
(FloMo). In our coverage, we erro
neously attributed the illnesses to food
poisoning; over the course of the day
today, the University issued a press re
lease suggesting that norovirus, a virus
spread via food or surfaces, was the
culprit.

As editor of this newspaper, I
apologize for any inaccuracies that
were published in yesterday's publi
cation. However, I stand behind our
decision to publish the story on the
31 st without comment from Universi
ty officials.
The article was sourced by testi
mony from five students two Flo-
Mo student staff members, two Flo-
Mo residents and one non-resident
FloMo diner attributing the ill
nesses to food poisoning. Important
ly, they all reported that their illness
es were contracted much earlier in
the week, some as early as Monday,
Oct. 28. Worse still, they suggested
that FloMo residents did not feel ful

ly informed about the situation by the
University.

Unaware of how Stanford admin
istrators planned to handle the situa
tion, we felt it was the students' right
to know that they could get sick from
going to their regular lunch or dinner
spot. FloMo Dining remained open to
students between Oct. 29 and Oct.
31, despite over 50 students falling vi
olently ill.
As recently as Oct. 31, University
officials spurned interviews from our
reporters and refused even to answer
questions about what precautions were
being taken to keep students safe.
In short, we made mistakes in our
pursuit to publicize a story we felt was
vital to the student interest. More ef
fort, however, should have been made
to reach out to University officials on
the evening of Oct. 30, when the story
was being written. It should go with
out saying that these kinds of inaccura
cies will not occur again.

Thank you for reading,
