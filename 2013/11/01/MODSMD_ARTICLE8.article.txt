Last week in Stern dining, a fresh
man stated "I just don't think
people would respect me as
much if I majored in the humanities."
A few weeks into Stanford, he had al
ready picked up on the underlying dif
ference in respect we have for aca
demic disciplines. Sitting at a table
with a friend RAing in Zapata, I felt
my sophomore struggle: deciding a
major while being at peace with the
future repercussions.
After a wide-eyed freshman year,
sophomore year is here. An upper
classman once told me that the

biggest transition was the jump from
freshman to sophomore year: Greeks
have self-separated, athletes can room
with athletes, and freshman year
friends have solidified.

There's more work, a different so
cial scene, and for the other half of the
sophomore class California has lost its
newness. Walking around the activi
ties fair, my friends sat behind the
booths.

Sarai (a sophomore like me!) got
40 plus likes on her declaring Symbol
ic Systems status; by the end of the
year, we'll all make a decision. The
Class of 2016 is no longer the newest
banner in Old Union, and we've gone
and integrated into the larger Stanford
community.

Since coming back to school, I've
been trying to figure out what academic trajec
tory I want to be on and what major will also
lead to a happy, healthy life. Stanford has a
plethora of opportunities, but it sometimes
feels like the default career opinion is comput
er science and engineering and of the remain
ing majors, there aren't many humanities peo
ple that aren't trying to be a doctor or lawyer.
As an undecided major, it's hard trying to fig
ure out what is it that you want to study and
what options that leaves you with after gradua
tion.

When I came to Stanford, my name became
the source of good-natured jokes referencing
McKinsey; to be honest, I didn't know that con
sulting existed in high school.
At Stanford, one default option is consulting
or finance. I don't think many of us come to col
lege with the intention of dating PowerPoint and
Excel; however, for a chunk of us, these relation
ships happea
Rob Reich, a Stanford professor in Political
Science, and Ezra Klein, a blogger for the Wash
ington Post, have both written on how Stanford
and its peer institutions send its students rush
ing into finance and consulting.
The pay is high, there's a set precedent on
how to get there, and like Stanford, the accept
ance rates are low, and the club is exclusive.
Klein's opinion is the post-grad flee to Wall Street

is partly due to universities failing to teach stu
dents applicable skills in many undergrad classes.
Elite colleges produce intelligent liberal arts
students with terrifyingly disciplined work
ethics who have no idea what to do next. Ac
cording to these writers, the finance industry
profits from this confusion, attracting students
who didn't intend to work in finance but aren't
sure what they want, so it becomes the next
step.

My resident tutor from last year worked at
such an institution over the summer, and his
commentary was that this path is away for peo
ple who care a lot about money to make it given
they don't have a more creative way to do so.
A senior in my dorm talked about his invest
ment banking internship hours from 9 a.m. to 1
a.m. There was about one girl for every 20 male
interns, but fortunately, it didn't feel uneven, be
cause all the secretaries were women.

To be honest, I feel a little cheated right now.
Our generation has been told do what you love,
but as I grow up, it's become apparent that not
all academic disciplines are equally valued.
Everyone in our student body is amazing,
but the average graduating B.A. student from
Stanford has a starting salary of $33,251 while
the B.S. makes $76,785. For the humanities to
gain further respect at Stanford, more incen
tives need to be there, but for now, I'm not
surprised that the freshmen are scared of the
humanities. I am too.

ance rates are low, and the club is exclusive.
Klein's opinion is the post-grad flee to Wall Street

is partly due to universities failing to teach stu
dents applicable skills in many undergrad classes.
Elite colleges produce intelligent liberal arts
students with terrifyingly disciplined work
ethics who have no idea what to do next. Ac
cording to these writers, the finance industry
profits from this confusion, attracting students
who didn't intend to work in finance but aren't
sure what they want, so it becomes the next
step.

My resident tutor from last year worked at
such an institution over the summer, and his
commentary was that this path is away for peo
ple who care a lot about money to make it given
they don't have a more creative way to do so.
A senior in my dorm talked about his invest
ment banking internship hours from 9 a.m. to 1
a.m. There was about one girl for every 20 male
interns, but fortunately, it didn't feel uneven, be
cause all the secretaries were women.

To be honest, I feel a little cheated right now.
Our generation has been told do what you love,
but as I grow up, it's become apparent that not
all academic disciplines are equally valued.
Everyone in our student body is amazing,
but the average graduating B.A. student from
Stanford has a starting salary of $33,251 while
the B.S. makes $76,785. For the humanities to
gain further respect at Stanford, more incen
tives need to be there, but for now, I'm not
surprised that the freshmen are scared of the
humanities. I am too.
