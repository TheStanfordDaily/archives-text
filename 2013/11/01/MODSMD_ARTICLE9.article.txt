# OPINIONS
## Make More Bad Decisions 
### Alex Bayer 
Ah, the internet On the one hand, it's a great blessing
that we have access to infinite information. But it's also
a detriment The more information we have, the more
we have at our disposal to mate a good, informed opinion
—so we think But do we ever know what's right?
As Alfred Hirschman, the late economist, championed
all his life, it's the bad decisions that end up being the most
valuable sources of growth. For example, take my latest is
sue: My initial housing in Fhris didn't work out, so I was
forced to find an apartment on my own. All of a sudden I
was acting lite a real adult —emailing landlords, dealing
with Craigslist scammers, going to open houses.
I learned that i) the Ibris real estate market is insane ii)
there is an inverse relationship between location and crap
piness of any given flat But the biggest lesson, besides all the
knowledge, was that if called upon to do this in the future,
I actually could.

Who was this person making color-coded lists and at
tending open houses? And where was the gjii who procras
tinates on practically everything and shows up to class late?
In feeling a little more like an adult and less lite a teenage
shit-show, I felt a disproportionate amount of pride. And I
had the sudden housing crisis and the real possibility of
homelessness to thank for it; for had I not been pushed to
my extremes, I would not have discovered this more re
silient, creative alter ego.

Even just knowing you can take care of yourself and
more or less survive is empowering enough. It reminds me
of something George Orwell wrote about the period when
he was broke in Ihris: "It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleas
ure at knowingyourself at last genuinely down and out You
have talked so often of going to the dog?—and well, here
are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand
it. It takes off a lot of anxiety."

That's the beauty of really terrible decisions. For how
are we to learn —truly learn —if not through our own
mistakes? The right information may help us avoid making
the mistakes, but we miss out on the knowledge we might
have gained had we really screwed it up.
Yshoo Answers, though it has the answer to all of my ob
scure questions and existential crises, alas cannot shine a
light on who I am nor explain to me the roots of my fears
nor reveal what my heart really wants.
This is why I'm worried, or at least ponderous, about
how technology will deprive us of these opportunities to
make really bad decisions.

If stranded at an unknown corner, we can conjure a
cab in an instant with Über and get home safe and dry. What
would my dad have done? Would he wander around, get
soaked, and ask a man working at a laundromat for help?
Might he make a new friend, or at least learn about ask
ing help from strangers? Might all these random encoun

ters, tallied up, have shaped him into a more outgoing, open
minded person, the one I know him as? How many chance
encounters does our automated system of decisions deprive
us of? In being handed, again and again, the "right" path,
what do we forgo along the "wrong" one?
I'm reminded of playgrounds, and how tin slides, see
saws and speedy merry-go-rounds have been disappearing
in favor of puny plastic slides and lame padded forts. It's no
wonder, ilhds aside, I see less kids enthused about the jun
gle gyms in their yards. They're just not as fun.
And though our parents surely do this out of love and
concern for our well-being, how are we to learn? How can
we stretch our wings, know our strength? And if we break
an arm, do we not learn what it means to heal, and how
strength regenerates?

Though it's natural for parents to want the world for their
kids, just as it's natural for us to want a cab in the middle of
the night, sometimes the only real lesson is the hard lesson
How are we to know our strength if never called upon to
use it? How are we to grow antibodies that will make us re
silient to infection if never exposed to germs in small, occa
sional doses?

What do we never learn when we take the easy route?
About what we're capable of, about how to respond to
crises? When life inevitably hits us in unexpected, unfair
ways, how will we respond? If we lose someone we love,
where does one go from there? Wioo Answers is blank; de
spite what the self-help aisle has you believe, there are no
real manuals for this stuff. Only the words of those who've
lived it really get you.

Why does heartache mate the most beautiful sound?
And why do we turn to our parents, the older we get? life,
beneath its serene and beautiful surface, is rocky and enig
matic. The wise are not the ones who know information,
but the ones who have lived.

And to live, you've got to mess up and make mistakes
and hit a dozen rock bottoms and claw yourself up and up
again Nietzsche, via Kanye West, was right when he said,
"What doesn't kill you mates you stronger." I didn't get that
line for the longest time, because I never could understand
the formula.

Ateacherwho dislikes me? Afriendwho has abandoned
me? A school I was rejected from? Feeling as small as a
mouse, I couldn't possibly understand how any of these
were supposed to mate me feel stronger. Not until recently
did it finally click; It's not the problem itself, but what you
do in response to it, that mates you stronger.
It's all about the fight; that's what mates you use your
inner strength, and how would you know you've got it in
you otherwise? Crazily enough, the most wrong decision
may be the only right one.

And though our parents surely do this out of love and

Ateacherwho dislikes me? Afriendwho has abandoned
me? A school I was rejected from? Feeling as small as a
mouse, I couldn't possibly understand how any of these
were supposed to mate me feel stronger. Not until recently
did it finally click; It's not the problem itself, but what you
do in response to it, that mates you stronger.
It's all about the fight; that's what mates you use your
inner strength, and how would you know you've got it in
you otherwise? Crazily enough, the most wrong decision
may be the only right one.

Ah, the internet On the one hand, it's a great blessing
that we have access to infinite information. But it's also
a detriment The more information we have, the more
we have at our disposal to mate a good, informed opinion
—so we think But do we ever know what's right?
As Alfred Hirschman, the late economist, championed
all his life, it's the bad decisions that end up being the most
valuable sources of growth. For example, take my latest is
sue: My initial housing in Fhris didn't work out, so I was
forced to find an apartment on my own. All of a sudden I
was acting lite a real adult —emailing landlords, dealing
with Craigslist scammers, going to open houses.
I learned that i) the Ibris real estate market is insane ii)
there is an inverse relationship between location and crap
piness of any given flat But the biggest lesson, besides all the
knowledge, was that if called upon to do this in the future,
I actually could.

Who was this person making color-coded lists and at
tending open houses? And where was the gjii who procras
tinates on practically everything and shows up to class late?
In feeling a little more like an adult and less lite a teenage
shit-show, I felt a disproportionate amount of pride. And I
had the sudden housing crisis and the real possibility of
homelessness to thank for it; for had I not been pushed to
my extremes, I would not have discovered this more re
silient, creative alter ego.

Even just knowing you can take care of yourself and
more or less survive is empowering enough. It reminds me
of something George Orwell wrote about the period when
he was broke in Ihris: "It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleas
ure at knowingyourself at last genuinely down and out You
have talked so often of going to the dog?—and well, here
are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand
it. It takes off a lot of anxiety."

That's the beauty of really terrible decisions. For how
are we to learn —truly learn —if not through our own
mistakes? The right information may help us avoid making
the mistakes, but we miss out on the knowledge we might
have gained had we really screwed it up.
Yshoo Answers, though it has the answer to all of my ob
scure questions and existential crises, alas cannot shine a
light on who I am nor explain to me the roots of my fears
nor reveal what my heart really wants.
This is why I'm worried, or at least ponderous, about
how technology will deprive us of these opportunities to
make really bad decisions.

If stranded at an unknown corner, we can conjure a
cab in an instant with Über and get home safe and dry. What
would my dad have done? Would he wander around, get
soaked, and ask a man working at a laundromat for help?
Might he make a new friend, or at least learn about ask
ing help from strangers? Might all these random encoun

ters, tallied up, have shaped him into a more outgoing, open
minded person, the one I know him as? How many chance
encounters does our automated system of decisions deprive
us of? In being handed, again and again, the "right" path,
what do we forgo along the "wrong" one?
I'm reminded of playgrounds, and how tin slides, see
saws and speedy merry-go-rounds have been disappearing
in favor of puny plastic slides and lame padded forts. It's no
wonder, ilhds aside, I see less kids enthused about the jun
gle gyms in their yards. They're just not as fun.
