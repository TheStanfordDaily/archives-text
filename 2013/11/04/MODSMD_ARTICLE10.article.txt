## STANFORD DOWNS UCLA 3-1 AFTER LOSS TO USC 
### JORDAN WALLACH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Stanford women's volley
ball, Friday night's match against
UCLA could have been easily
overlooked it was just another
matchup against an unranked
team in front of a home crowd at
Maples Pavilion. Yet in the two
days after Wednesday's loss to
No. 4 USC (19-3, 9-2 Pac-12), the
coaching staff's focus on avoiding
another mental letdown paid off,
as the Cardinal pulled out a tight
four-set victory, 28-26, 25-19, 22-

Pac-12) faced an uphill battle
against the Bruins (12-9, 3-8)
from the start in a first set that
saw 15 tie scores and eight lead
changes. A combination of 11 un
forced Bruin errors eight at
tack and three service and
four Stanford team blocks kept
the Card close, yet it still faced a
20-23 deficit down the stretch.
In a complete swing of mo
mentum after a Stanford time
out, the Cardinal went on a four
point run to go up 24-23, spurred
by two kills from sophomore out
side hitter Brittany Howard, who
had a team-high 12 kills and a ca
