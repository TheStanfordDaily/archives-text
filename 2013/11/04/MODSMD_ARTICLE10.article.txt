## STANFORD DOWNS UCLA 3-1 AFTER LOSS TO USC 
### JORDAN WALLACH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Stanford women's volley
ball, Friday night's match against
UCLA could have been easily
overlooked it was just another
matchup against an unranked
team in front of a home crowd at
Maples Pavilion. Yet in the two
days after Wednesday's loss to
No. 4 USC (19-3, 9-2 Pac-12), the
coaching staff's focus on avoiding
another mental letdown paid off,
as the Cardinal pulled out a tight
four-set victory, 28-26, 25-19, 22-
25, 25-11.
"When you play a hard match
in an important situation like we
did on Wednesday, you can fold,"

said head coach John Dunning.
"It's possible to not rebound
from it, and you're just going to
hurt yourself. One of our goals as
a team is to never walk into a
match and be unprepared to play
for any reason. We were worried
about it.

"This was a big match and I
liked our reaction. Especially be
fore the last game, we lost a
game and had to say, 'Hey, we're
not doing this again.' Then we
played really well."

The No. 6 Cardinal (16-5, 9-3
Pac-12) faced an uphill battle
against the Bruins (12-9, 3-8)
from the start in a first set that
saw 15 tie scores and eight lead
changes. A combination of 11 un
forced Bruin errors eight at
tack and three service and
four Stanford team blocks kept
the Card close, yet it still faced a
20-23 deficit down the stretch.
In a complete swing of mo
mentum after a Stanford time
out, the Cardinal went on a four
point run to go up 24-23, spurred
by two kills from sophomore out
side hitter Brittany Howard, who
had a team-high 12 kills and a ca

reer-high seven blocks in the
match. But UCLA battled back,
earning two set points, both saved
by the Card. With the score tied
at 26, sophomore outside hitter
Jordan Burgess first dug a tough
Bruin spike and later found open
court with a kill on a tip shot. On
set point, Burgess slammed an
other kill, her third of the set, to
give Stanford the 28-26 set win.
"Our core attitude was impor
tant," Burgess said. "We managed
to stay positive all the time it
felt good on the court even when
we weren't getting as many points
as we usually do."
The Cardinal then took a 2-0
lead in the match with a 25-19 sec
ond-set victory, as the team won
11 of 13 points in a rally to earn a
set point at 24-16. Though UCLA
saved three set points, a kill by
sophomore middle blocker Inky
Ajanaku closed it out one of
her 10 kills in the match. Ajanaku
has been particularly strong over
the last couple of weeks, hitting
.421 with 2.68 kills per set over
her last six matches. She had hit
.365 and had 2.47 kills per set
over her previous six matches.
"[Ajanaku's] improvement
over the last couple of weeks is be
cause she had a couple of weeks
when she wasn't as good as she
wanted to be," Dunning said. "She
got put in a position where she
was learning that she didn't know
enough, and she's been working
really hard on understanding
things about her position. It's
hard in the middle of the season to
change things, but she's doing it
and it's really helping her."
The Bruins pulled out a third
set win, as they hit .302, their
highest mark for a set in the
match. Yet Stanford battled back
with a dominant fourth set victory,
outhitting UCLA .400 to .023. The
set and match were essentially
sealed by a seven-point Cardinal
run on Burgess's short serves,
which pushed the team's lead to
14-6.
The Cardinal will look to carry
its momentum into a difficult road
trip, which begins at Colorado on
Friday at 6 p.m. and then heads to
Utah on Sunday at 11 a.m. Sun
day's match will be televised on
Pac-12 Networks.
