## Randle paces Card past SPU 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
With the beginning of the
regular season just six days
away, Stanford men's basketball
team looked rather inconsistent
in its first live action of the sea
son on Saturday. The Cardinal
was still able to defeat Division
II opponent Seattle Pacific 89-61
behind the spectacular play of
junior guard Chasson Randle,
who finished with 37 points.
Stanford raced out to an ear
ly 19-4 lead, getting eight quick
points from Randle and some

nice interior scoring from senior
center Stefan Nastic, who had six
points in the early going. The Car
dinal opened the game with full
court pressure and zone defense,
capitalizing on its athletic advan
tage over the smaller, slower Fal
cons by forcing turnovers and get
ting out into transition.
Despite the strong start, Stan
ford let Seattle Pacific back into

the game with a lapse all too famil
iar to Stanford basketball over the
past few seasons. The Falcons,
who are the top-ranked team in
Division 11, showed their mettle by
slowly chipping away at the Cardi
nal's lead. With AU-Pac-12 forward
Dwight Powell on the bench due to
foul trouble for the final 12 min
utes of the first half, the Falcons
were able to narrow Stanford's ad
vantage to five by halftime. Seattle
Pacific's run was greatly aided by
particularly sloppy play from the
Cardinal on the offensive end,
