## Randle paces Card past SPU 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
With the beginning of the
regular season just six days
away, Stanford men's basketball
team looked rather inconsistent
in its first live action of the sea
son on Saturday. The Cardinal
was still able to defeat Division
II opponent Seattle Pacific 89-61
behind the spectacular play of
junior guard Chasson Randle,
who finished with 37 points.
Stanford raced out to an ear
ly 19-4 lead, getting eight quick
points from Randle and some

nice interior scoring from senior
center Stefan Nastic, who had six
points in the early going. The Car
dinal opened the game with full
court pressure and zone defense,
capitalizing on its athletic advan
tage over the smaller, slower Fal
cons by forcing turnovers and get
ting out into transition.
Despite the strong start, Stan
ford let Seattle Pacific back into

the game with a lapse all too famil
iar to Stanford basketball over the
past few seasons. The Falcons,
who are the top-ranked team in
Division 11, showed their mettle by
slowly chipping away at the Cardi
nal's lead. With AU-Pac-12 forward
Dwight Powell on the bench due to
foul trouble for the final 12 min
utes of the first half, the Falcons
were able to narrow Stanford's ad
vantage to five by halftime. Seattle
Pacific's run was greatly aided by
particularly sloppy play from the
Cardinal on the offensive end,

where a sequence of Stanford
turnovers and offensive fouls
allowed the Falcons to narrow
the gap.
For a team that has strug
gled with consistency in re
cent years, this lapse was not
a welcome sign. This Stanford
squad hopes to make some se
rious noise in the conference
race this season, and a more
talented team than Seattle Pa
cific could have taken greater
advantage of Stanford's poor
play in the first half. Luckily
for the Cardinal, it held a
large talent edge over the Fal
cons. Randle proved to be the
difference, scoring 22 of Stan
ford's 38 points in the first
half.
"My teammates found me
in good spots," Randle said.
"Also our transition game was
working for us today."
Stanford's effort was much
more consistent in the second
half, as Powell and senior
guard Anthony Brown started
to contribute in their usual
fashion. Powell scored six
straight points early in the
second half on a series of driv
ing layups, and Brown added
10 of his 14 points in the sec
ond frame to help the Cardi
nal finally pull away from the
Falcons. Stanford outscored

Seattle Pacific 40-15 over the
final 15:30 of the game, wear
ing down the undersized and
outmanned Falcons. Powell
finished with eight points on
4-of-5 shooting, while Nastic
had 12 and senior Josh
Huestis added eight points
and 10 rebounds.
Moving forward, however,
the Cardinal has to get better.
Randle knows it.
"We just can't have lapses
defensively," Randle said.
"When things aren't going
well, we just have to pick it up
quicker."
Head coach Johnny
Dawkins spoke to the team af
ter the game about handling
adversity, a theme that has
been a main focus for the Car
dinal in the offseason.
"I thought that we've got
to clean up some of our defens
es," Dawkins said. "We've got
to clean up some of our zone
defense, and we also have to
improve upon valuing the bas
ketball more too."
Stanford will have six days
to make those improvements
before Bueknell, an NCAA
Tournament team last year,
comes to town for the season
opener. It appears as though
the Cardinal will open the
season with a starting lineup
of Randle, Brown, Huestis,
Powell and Nastic, with expe
rienced senior contributors
Aaron Bright, John Gage and
Robbie Lemons coming off
the bench.

Nastic's start Saturday
was a surprise to some, given
Nastic's limited playing time
in the past. Although Nastic
was an effective low-post
scorer against the Falcons, it
remains to be seen whether
his success will translate

against better and taller op
position. Having him on the
floor hurts Stanford's spacing
on offense due to the presence
of another big man instead of
the smaller guard Bright, so
Nastic will have to continue to
contribute to see more play

ing time.
The Cardinal opens the
regular season at home on
Nov. 8 at 7 p.m. against Buck
nell.

SEATTLE PACIFIC6I
STANFORD 89
11 /2, Maples Pavilion
where a sequence of Stanford
turnovers and offensive fouls
allowed the Falcons to narrow
the gap.
For a team that has strug
gled with consistency in re
cent years, this lapse was not
a welcome sign. This Stanford
squad hopes to make some se
rious noise in the conference
race this season, and a more
talented team than Seattle Pa
cific could have taken greater
advantage of Stanford's poor
play in the first half. Luckily
for the Cardinal, it held a
large talent edge over the Fal
cons. Randle proved to be the
difference, scoring 22 of Stan
ford's 38 points in the first
half.
"My teammates found me
in good spots," Randle said.
"Also our transition game was
working for us today."
Stanford's effort was much
more consistent in the second
half, as Powell and senior
guard Anthony Brown started
to contribute in their usual
fashion. Powell scored six
straight points early in the
second half on a series of driv
ing layups, and Brown added
10 of his 14 points in the sec
ond frame to help the Cardi
nal finally pull away from the
Falcons. Stanford outscored

Seattle Pacific 40-15 over the
final 15:30 of the game, wear
ing down the undersized and
outmanned Falcons. Powell
finished with eight points on
4-of-5 shooting, while Nastic
had 12 and senior Josh
Huestis added eight points
and 10 rebounds.
Moving forward, however,
the Cardinal has to get better.
Randle knows it.
"We just can't have lapses
defensively," Randle said.
"When things aren't going
well, we just have to pick it up
quicker."
Head coach Johnny
Dawkins spoke to the team af
ter the game about handling
adversity, a theme that has
been a main focus for the Car
dinal in the offseason.
"I thought that we've got
to clean up some of our defens
es," Dawkins said. "We've got
to clean up some of our zone
defense, and we also have to
improve upon valuing the bas
ketball more too."
Stanford will have six days
to make those improvements
before Bueknell, an NCAA
Tournament team last year,
comes to town for the season
opener. It appears as though
the Cardinal will open the
season with a starting lineup
of Randle, Brown, Huestis,
Powell and Nastic, with expe
rienced senior contributors
Aaron Bright, John Gage and
Robbie Lemons coming off
the bench.

Nastic's start Saturday
was a surprise to some, given
Nastic's limited playing time
in the past. Although Nastic
was an effective low-post
scorer against the Falcons, it
remains to be seen whether
his success will translate

against better and taller op
position. Having him on the
floor hurts Stanford's spacing
on offense due to the presence
of another big man instead of
the smaller guard Bright, so
Nastic will have to continue to
contribute to see more play

ing time.
The Cardinal opens the
regular season at home on
Nov. 8 at 7 p.m. against Buck
nell.
