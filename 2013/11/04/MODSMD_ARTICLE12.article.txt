## Freshmen shine in exhibition Ogwumike still carries torch 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 Stanford women's
basketball team opened its 2013-14
season with a definitive 70-47 win
Sunday against Vanguard in its on
ly exhibition game.
Vanguard, ranked No. 1 in the
NAIA preseason poll, had already
played fellow Pac-12 schools UCLA
and Berkeley tightly earlier last
week. The Cardinal thus had an op
portunity going into this game to
gauge how the other Pac-12 leaders
measure up to it, at least early in
the season.

Whereas the Bruins and Golden
Bears allowed Vanguard to stay in
the game through the first half,
Stanford pulled away early and
went into the break leading by 20,
never allowing the Lions to assert
themselves even early on.
Senior forward Chiney Ogwu
mike led all scorers with 27 points
and 15 rebounds in only 21 minutes
of play. Ogwumike's dominant play
was representative of the amount
of work she put into improving
during the offseason. Not just a
strong force under the basket in
rebounding and put-backs, she
proved her well-roundedness in
stepping out to take jumpers
shooting 13-of-19 and also in
passing and moving the ball around
the court effectively.
In the absence of senior Sara
James and juniors Taylor Green
field, Erica Payne and Bonnie
Samuelson due to various injuries,
the freshman class was able to step
up and make an impact in the
Card's first game.
In particular, freshman Kailee
Johnson made a dent in Sunday's
exhibition, scoring 13 points and
grabbing nine rebounds in her first
collegiate start. She also had the
most playing time of any other
players on the team and was able to
assert herself early on, getting a
block only two minutes in and scor
ing her first points after less than
five minutes of play.
Ogwumike mentioned last week
how the five freshmen bring differ
ent things to the table and that the
team's depth is "off the charts," and
this game effectively reiterated
that. Missing so many upperclass
men to injury would have been a
major issue for last year's team.
However, the newly added depth in
the Card's lineup will be a huge fac
tor in its success this season.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
subbed early and often in the game
in order to get a lot of players expe
rience and confidence moving for
ward— which will be of particular
importance for next Monday's
game at No. 1 Connecticut. Van-
Derveer expressed her happiness
with the win and that a lot of play-

ers were able to not only
play but also contribute in
big ways.
Freshmen Lili Thompson,
Erica McCall and Karlie
Samuelson also made their
collegiate debut. Thompson
split time at point guard with
junior Amber Orrange, while
McCall was a huge force in

side, scoring 14 points.
Samuelson had seven points
and knocked down her first
three-pointer, making up for
her sharp-shooting older sis
ter's absence.
The Card started off with
great intensity, employing a
full-court press and not re
lenting defensively for the
rest of the game. Stanford
capitalized on the new 10-sec
ond backcourt regulation by
forcing Vanguard to make a
couple violations.
"We want to play hard and

hustle but not foul," Van-
Derveer said. "We're a quick
er team and playing at a
faster pace."
Stanford struggled in
shooting and finishing at the
basket in some stretches of
the game, especially in the
first half, and only shot 40.5
percent in the game. Tight
defense and lopsided re
bounding, however, allowed
the Cardinal to keep its lead
in double digits for the major
ity of the game.
Despite the pestering
Stanford defense, NAIA2OI3
All-American senior guard
Nicole Ballestero scored 25
points in Vanguard's loss.
The Card embarks on its
first road trip this weekend,
opening the regular season
this Saturday against Boston
College and then moving on
to perhaps its toughest game
before Pac-12 play at Con
necticut on Monday.
"We are looking forward

to a fabulous season, Van-
Derveer said. "We're just go
ing to continue to work hard
er so that we can get better

and better each game."

STANFORD 79

1 1/3, Maples Pavilion
ers were able to not only
play but also contribute in
big ways.
Freshmen Lili Thompson,
Erica McCall and Karlie
Samuelson also made their
collegiate debut. Thompson
split time at point guard with
junior Amber Orrange, while
McCall was a huge force in

side, scoring 14 points.
Samuelson had seven points
and knocked down her first
three-pointer, making up for
her sharp-shooting older sis
ter's absence.
The Card started off with
great intensity, employing a
full-court press and not re
lenting defensively for the
rest of the game. Stanford
capitalized on the new 10-sec
ond backcourt regulation by
forcing Vanguard to make a
couple violations.
"We want to play hard and

hustle but not foul," Van-
Derveer said. "We're a quick
er team and playing at a
faster pace."
Stanford struggled in
shooting and finishing at the
basket in some stretches of
the game, especially in the
first half, and only shot 40.5
percent in the game. Tight
defense and lopsided re
bounding, however, allowed
the Cardinal to keep its lead
in double digits for the major
ity of the game.
Despite the pestering
Stanford defense, NAIA2OI3
All-American senior guard
Nicole Ballestero scored 25
points in Vanguard's loss.
The Card embarks on its
first road trip this weekend,
opening the regular season
this Saturday against Boston
College and then moving on
to perhaps its toughest game
before Pac-12 play at Con
necticut on Monday.
"We are looking forward

to a fabulous season, Van-
Derveer said. "We're just go
ing to continue to work hard
er so that we can get better

and better each game."
