## OP-ED Opt In to the Political Process 
### 
It is especially popular in these
parts to revel in, or at least
shrug off, the dysfunction that
has grinded the gears of self-gov
ernment to a halt. When the federal
government manufactures fiscal
crises, constructs metadata drag
nets and infiltrates private informa
tion networks, bright and well-in
tentioned people could be forgiven
for electing to opt-out of democrat
ic politics. They could be forgiven,
but they would be misguided.
Bright and concerned citizens at
Stanford and elsewhere cannot
hope to withdraw from the political
process and escape state regulation
to some Valhalla in the cloud. Stan
ford's own Balaji Srinivasan's "exit"
to an "opt-in society, based on tech
nology, outside of the United
States" is not an option. Power fills
a vacuum. Abdication from
the democratic process does not im
munize these would-be decampers
from the state and its laws. Their
withdrawal merely exposes them to
the regulatory whimsy of the re
maining electoral majority a ma
jority dominated by rent-seekers
and private interest groups.
To take just one example, con
sider the future of the NSA's re
cently revealed metadata collection
program. Under the program, fed
eral anti-terror agencies like the
NSA and FBI order telecommuni
cations providers to produce and
deliver "metadata" from any tele
phone call they handle with a Unit
ed States nexus. This includes
recording and delivering lists of
telephone numbers, call times, du
rations and origin points. Ruefully,
the Obama administration has de
fended the program.
The President's Department of
Justice has argued that the pro
gram is both constitutioyial under
the Fourth Amendment (meaning
that it is categorically something
Congress is allowed to authorize the
NSA to do) and legal under an up
dated provision of the PATRIOT
Act (meaning that Congress did in
fact authorize it). Civil libertarians
and pending federal lawsuits dis
pute both parts of the administra
tion's argument.
But in analysis for a forthcoming
publication, I find that while the
program is illegal it is objectively
impossible for the NSA to have
meet the PATRIOT Act's reason
able grounds and relevancy require
ments it is, nonetheless, constitu
tional by various accounts.
The three arguments break
down like this. First, black-letter
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence
permits the government to collect
this kind of information without a
warrant. The Supreme Court has
interpreted the Fourth Amendment
to mean that the government cannot
listen in on private phone conversa
tions without a warrant since people
have a reasonable expectation of
privacy in those conversations.
However, the Court has ruled
that people do not have a reasonable
expectation of privacy in the infor
mation they voluntarily convey to a
third-party, such as the telephone
number one dials and relays to a
phone company when placing a call.
Courts have extended this ruling to
exclude constitutional protection for
any metadata (like call time, dura
tion, location) similarly conveyed to
the phone company.
Second, a novel theory based on
concurring opinions in a recent
Supreme Court decision that sug
gests a more stringent Fourth
Amendment standard wouldn't ap
ply to the facts in the metadata col
lection case, even if it were formally
adopted.

Third, even the Fourth Amend
ment rights of telecommunication
providers are not implicated by
NSA production orders.
If correct, this means that, even
though Congress has not passed a
law authorizing the NSA to conduct
this type of dragnet surveillance,
they could still pass such a law in the
future. In fact, though some in Con
gress are mobilizing to terminate
the program against the President's
wishes, others with considerable in
fluence are defending it.
With recent polls showing that
the country is evenly split in its sup
port for the program, senior Califor
nia Democratic Senator Dianne Fe
instein, who chairs the powerful
Senate Select Committee on Intelli
gence, is already planning to codify
the program by introducing an
amendment to the PATRIOT Act.
Politics will thus determine the
future of the program and the in
tegrity of your privacy, and citizens
will have substantial influence over
the outcome. Not only will the na
tion elect a new Congress who will
make that determination next year,
but the issue of NSA surveillance
splits party lines and Congress it
self: In July, a split party vote in the
House to limit the NSA failed by
just seven votes.
With an issue like this, individual
Congresspersons face less institu
tional pressure from leadership and
pay more attention to constituents
and polling. Under these conditions,
informing and organizing friends
and family to contact their repre
sentatives and vote can actually
make a difference and halt the NSA
in its tracks by electing or persuad
ing just a few representatives to de
authorize the program.
Now if you believe in Sri
navasan's secessionist Internet
Utopia, then you shouldn't bother to
get involved. If you believe
Chamath Palihapitiya, the promi
nent venture capitalist who pro
claimed that technology companies
"are becoming the eminent vehicles
for change and influence" and that
"stasis in the government is actual
ly good for all of us," then you
shouldn't bother to get involved, ei
ther.
But if you believe that the peo
ple of a republic are sovereign, and
that engaging, persuading and or
ganizing peers to exert influence is
the substance of a free and demo
cratic people, then you should get
active right now.
You should find out who your
representatives are, and you should
ask them where they stand on the
NSA and the other issues you care
about. You should join issue organi
zations like the Electronic Fron
tier Foundation, Electronic Privacy
Information Center, ACLU and
FWD.us that are already advo
cating for these and other issues
and see how you can help them. You
must, if nothing else, find and elect
representatives who will fight for
you in Washington.
You should do these things be
cause there is no escaping politics
or the legal regulatory apparatus it
produces. One-liners about disrup
tion and changing centers of power
make for good sound bites at devel
oper conferences and TED talks,
but those who wield them misun
derstand both the nature of power,
as well as their own possession of it.
Power isn't in a valuation, and it is
n't in the cloud. Power is lying in the
street pick it up.

ask them where they stand on the
NSA and the other issues you care
about. You should join issue organi
zations like the Electronic Fron
tier Foundation, Electronic Privacy
Information Center, ACLU and
FWD.us that are already advo
cating for these and other issues
and see how you can help them. You
must, if nothing else, find and elect
representatives who will fight for
you in Washington.
You should do these things be
cause there is no escaping politics
or the legal regulatory apparatus it
produces. One-liners about disrup
tion and changing centers of power
make for good sound bites at devel
oper conferences and TED talks,

as well as their own possession of it.
Power isn't in a valuation, and it is

It is especially popular in these
parts to revel in, or at least
shrug off, the dysfunction that
has grinded the gears of self-gov
ernment to a halt. When the federal
government manufactures fiscal
crises, constructs metadata drag
nets and infiltrates private informa
tion networks, bright and well-in
tentioned people could be forgiven
for electing to opt-out of democrat
ic politics. They could be forgiven,
but they would be misguided.
Bright and concerned citizens at
Stanford and elsewhere cannot
hope to withdraw from the political
process and escape state regulation
to some Valhalla in the cloud. Stan
ford's own Balaji Srinivasan's "exit"
to an "opt-in society, based on tech
nology, outside of the United
States" is not an option. Power fills
a vacuum. Abdication from
the democratic process does not im
munize these would-be decampers
from the state and its laws. Their
withdrawal merely exposes them to
the regulatory whimsy of the re
maining electoral majority a ma
jority dominated by rent-seekers
and private interest groups.
To take just one example, con
sider the future of the NSA's re
cently revealed metadata collection
program. Under the program, fed
eral anti-terror agencies like the
NSA and FBI order telecommuni
cations providers to produce and
deliver "metadata" from any tele
phone call they handle with a Unit
ed States nexus. This includes
recording and delivering lists of
telephone numbers, call times, du
rations and origin points. Ruefully,
the Obama administration has de
fended the program.
The President's Department of
Justice has argued that the pro
gram is both constitutioyial under
the Fourth Amendment (meaning
that it is categorically something
Congress is allowed to authorize the
NSA to do) and legal under an up
dated provision of the PATRIOT
Act (meaning that Congress did in
fact authorize it). Civil libertarians
and pending federal lawsuits dis
pute both parts of the administra
tion's argument.
But in analysis for a forthcoming
publication, I find that while the
program is illegal it is objectively
impossible for the NSA to have
meet the PATRIOT Act's reason
able grounds and relevancy require
ments it is, nonetheless, constitu
tional by various accounts.
The three arguments break
down like this. First, black-letter
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence
permits the government to collect
this kind of information without a
warrant. The Supreme Court has
interpreted the Fourth Amendment
to mean that the government cannot
listen in on private phone conversa
tions without a warrant since people
have a reasonable expectation of
privacy in those conversations.
However, the Court has ruled
that people do not have a reasonable
expectation of privacy in the infor
mation they voluntarily convey to a
third-party, such as the telephone
number one dials and relays to a
phone company when placing a call.
Courts have extended this ruling to
exclude constitutional protection for
any metadata (like call time, dura
tion, location) similarly conveyed to
the phone company.
Second, a novel theory based on
concurring opinions in a recent
Supreme Court decision that sug
gests a more stringent Fourth
Amendment standard wouldn't ap
ply to the facts in the metadata col
lection case, even if it were formally
adopted.

Third, even the Fourth Amend
ment rights of telecommunication
providers are not implicated by
NSA production orders.
If correct, this means that, even
though Congress has not passed a
law authorizing the NSA to conduct
this type of dragnet surveillance,
they could still pass such a law in the
future. In fact, though some in Con
gress are mobilizing to terminate
the program against the President's
wishes, others with considerable in
fluence are defending it.
With recent polls showing that
the country is evenly split in its sup
port for the program, senior Califor
nia Democratic Senator Dianne Fe
instein, who chairs the powerful
Senate Select Committee on Intelli
gence, is already planning to codify
the program by introducing an
amendment to the PATRIOT Act.
Politics will thus determine the
future of the program and the in
tegrity of your privacy, and citizens
will have substantial influence over
the outcome. Not only will the na
tion elect a new Congress who will
make that determination next year,
but the issue of NSA surveillance
splits party lines and Congress it
self: In July, a split party vote in the
House to limit the NSA failed by
just seven votes.
With an issue like this, individual
Congresspersons face less institu
tional pressure from leadership and
pay more attention to constituents
and polling. Under these conditions,
informing and organizing friends
and family to contact their repre
sentatives and vote can actually
make a difference and halt the NSA
in its tracks by electing or persuad
ing just a few representatives to de
authorize the program.
Now if you believe in Sri
navasan's secessionist Internet
Utopia, then you shouldn't bother to
get involved. If you believe
Chamath Palihapitiya, the promi
nent venture capitalist who pro
claimed that technology companies
"are becoming the eminent vehicles
for change and influence" and that
"stasis in the government is actual
ly good for all of us," then you
shouldn't bother to get involved, ei
ther.
But if you believe that the peo
ple of a republic are sovereign, and
that engaging, persuading and or
ganizing peers to exert influence is
the substance of a free and demo
cratic people, then you should get
active right now.
You should find out who your
representatives are, and you should
ask them where they stand on the
NSA and the other issues you care
about. You should join issue organi
zations like the Electronic Fron
tier Foundation, Electronic Privacy
Information Center, ACLU and
