## BOSP, Not For Everyone 
### Kevin Rouff 
While abroad with Stanford,
I found myself often dis
contented with program.
The course list I was initially given
to choose panned out to be much
smaller than what I had initially
hoped for, and the living experience
felt decaffeinated and unnatural.
I had chosen the wrong program.
Let me be clear the country I
was in had nothing to do with it. The
standard of living was not the issue,
nor was the culture, the people I en
countered or the city itself.
Rather, the issue was the BOSP
style of studying abroad.
Without any doubt, Stanford,
through BOSI? offers an impressive
ly diverse choice of countries in
which we can study, and this was a
crucial factor in choosing this school.
I knew where I wanted to study
abroad even before coming to Stan
ford and was very excited when be
ginning my studies knowing I could
fulfill this desire.
And yet I messed up. How could
that be?
It seems that studying abroad is
largely a "must-do" at Stanford, as it
is, of course, a valuable experience
that we can and should take advan
tage of. This leads to many students

scanning BOSP's list of countries like
the choices on a menu, weighing the
requirements, the prices, the expect
ed "fun," the courses (sometimes)
and the expected difficulty of studies
and of adapting to the culture.
However, BOSP is not always
the best choice for many.
The listed courses before applying
are often not the actuality of course of
ferings, as I had to learn. None of the
courses I had wanted were, in the end,
offered, nor were they with many for
eign students, and I was left with little
choice besides alternatives such as ac
ademic internships, courses offered at
other institutions and an independent
study.
After arriving in the program, I
felt duped and regretted my deci
sion.
BOSP is a great option of study
ing abroad briefly and securely. By
this I mean that it is a great way of
transferring the feel of Stanford
across the ocean in order to taste a
new culture.
But it is strictly that a transfer
of the Stanford bubble, if you will, to
another setting. BOSP does every
thing it can to facilitate the process
and make students "comfortable,"
or, in other words, isolate you from a
fuller cultural immersion, choosing
instead to baby-feed it in small incre
ments or excursions.
In fact, BOSP rarely actually in
volves full collaboration with local
universities, other than the new Is
tanbul's Kog University pairing now
offered, and instead places students
in isolated studying, living and so
cializing environments.
Describing the new Istanbul pro
gram, BOSP stated that despite (as
if to correct a fault) being at a Turk
ish university, Stanford students
could expect 90 percent of the pro
fessors receiving the Ph.D.s from
the States.
The idea is that they will get you
abroad, but fear not, for it will be just
like America.
This is not cultural immersion.
Even in homestays, the living expe
rience is propagated through fami
lies who are being paid and who are
quite accustomed to foreign students
on a quarterly basis such that what
one is experiencing is actual a
bizarre form of a bed and breakfast.
Sure, this can be enriching in it-

self, and largely suited to many who
wish to learn a language. Yet, as
many have discovered, this method
of living also isolated them from
meeting other locals.
BOSP compensates by providing
young students/guides throughout
the program who accompany you,
but again, these students are being
paid to do so and the experience is
far from local.
What many students, myself in
cluded, fail to realize is that BOSP is
not necessarily the desired abroad
experience.
When asked how their time
abroad was, students often reply
"Amazing!" and yet often admit they
didn't make many friends there or
that they merely made new Stan
ford friends.
Take a look at Facebook al
most all the photos are just of other
Stanford students at bars, muse
ums or monuments.
And yet you want to go abroad?
Then by all means, go!
But know that there are many
other options available besides
BOSP; the magic word is "non-
Stanford" study abroad. Many
prestigious schools, both from the
United States and the local univer
sities, offer programs for students
that are more immersive, housing
you in university dorms and offer
ing local courses, while many also
maintain the excursions and cultur
al activities.
Choose your experience like you
would choose your meal without
looking at the menu in a restaurant.
What do you want? If BOSP does
n't have it, look elsewhere; don't
just satisfice.
Sure, BOSP is often the only op
tion when considering unit require
ments or financial issues. But other
programs offer a multitude of
scholarships, even in full, and you
can have these units transferred
back to Stanford.
Think carefully if BOSP is right
for you (which it really is for many,
especially those who can't spare
much deviation from their studies
and those with little time or prior
language knowledge).
If it isn't, look elsewhere.

While abroad with Stanford,
I found myself often dis
contented with program.
The course list I was initially given
to choose panned out to be much
smaller than what I had initially
hoped for, and the living experience
felt decaffeinated and unnatural.
I had chosen the wrong program.
Let me be clear the country I
was in had nothing to do with it. The
standard of living was not the issue,
nor was the culture, the people I en
countered or the city itself.
Rather, the issue was the BOSP
style of studying abroad.
Without any doubt, Stanford,
through BOSI? offers an impressive
ly diverse choice of countries in
which we can study, and this was a
crucial factor in choosing this school.
I knew where I wanted to study
abroad even before coming to Stan
ford and was very excited when be
ginning my studies knowing I could
fulfill this desire.
And yet I messed up. How could
that be?
It seems that studying abroad is
largely a "must-do" at Stanford, as it
is, of course, a valuable experience
that we can and should take advan
tage of. This leads to many students

scanning BOSP's list of countries like
the choices on a menu, weighing the
requirements, the prices, the expect
ed "fun," the courses (sometimes)
and the expected difficulty of studies
and of adapting to the culture.
However, BOSP is not always
the best choice for many.
The listed courses before applying
are often not the actuality of course of
ferings, as I had to learn. None of the
courses I had wanted were, in the end,
offered, nor were they with many for
eign students, and I was left with little
choice besides alternatives such as ac
ademic internships, courses offered at
other institutions and an independent
study.
After arriving in the program, I
felt duped and regretted my deci
sion.
BOSP is a great option of study
ing abroad briefly and securely. By
this I mean that it is a great way of
transferring the feel of Stanford
across the ocean in order to taste a
new culture.
But it is strictly that a transfer
of the Stanford bubble, if you will, to
another setting. BOSP does every
thing it can to facilitate the process
and make students "comfortable,"
or, in other words, isolate you from a
fuller cultural immersion, choosing
instead to baby-feed it in small incre
ments or excursions.
In fact, BOSP rarely actually in
volves full collaboration with local
universities, other than the new Is
tanbul's Kog University pairing now
offered, and instead places students
in isolated studying, living and so
cializing environments.
Describing the new Istanbul pro
gram, BOSP stated that despite (as
if to correct a fault) being at a Turk
ish university, Stanford students
could expect 90 percent of the pro
fessors receiving the Ph.D.s from
the States.
The idea is that they will get you
abroad, but fear not, for it will be just
like America.
This is not cultural immersion.
Even in homestays, the living expe
rience is propagated through fami
lies who are being paid and who are
quite accustomed to foreign students
on a quarterly basis such that what
one is experiencing is actual a
bizarre form of a bed and breakfast.
Sure, this can be enriching in it-

self, and largely suited to many who
wish to learn a language. Yet, as
many have discovered, this method
of living also isolated them from
meeting other locals.
BOSP compensates by providing
young students/guides throughout
the program who accompany you,
but again, these students are being
paid to do so and the experience is
far from local.
What many students, myself in
cluded, fail to realize is that BOSP is
not necessarily the desired abroad
experience.
When asked how their time
abroad was, students often reply
"Amazing!" and yet often admit they
didn't make many friends there or
that they merely made new Stan
ford friends.
Take a look at Facebook al
most all the photos are just of other
Stanford students at bars, muse
ums or monuments.
And yet you want to go abroad?
Then by all means, go!
But know that there are many
other options available besides
BOSP; the magic word is "non-
Stanford" study abroad. Many
prestigious schools, both from the
United States and the local univer
sities, offer programs for students
that are more immersive, housing
you in university dorms and offer
ing local courses, while many also
maintain the excursions and cultur
al activities.
Choose your experience like you
would choose your meal without
looking at the menu in a restaurant.
What do you want? If BOSP does
n't have it, look elsewhere; don't
just satisfice.
Sure, BOSP is often the only op
tion when considering unit require
ments or financial issues. But other
programs offer a multitude of
scholarships, even in full, and you
can have these units transferred
back to Stanford.
Think carefully if BOSP is right
for you (which it really is for many,
especially those who can't spare
much deviation from their studies
and those with little time or prior
language knowledge).
If it isn't, look elsewhere.
