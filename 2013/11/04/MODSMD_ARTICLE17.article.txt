# ROAD STREAK SNAPPED
## 
### FIONA NOONAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a rough day for the
No. 7 Cardinal (13-4-1, 6-4-1
Pac-12) in Pullman, Wash., on
Sunday as the women's soc
cer team lost 1-0 to Washing
ton State (13-3-3, 6-3-1), clos
ing out their regular season
road schedule in front of a
crowd of 936.

The loss, which
took place on the Cougars'
Senior Day, snapped Stan
ford's 42-game road winning
streak and eliminated any
chance of winning the Pac-12.
The Cardinal has been the
Pac-12 champion for the past
four years.
The game remained tied
at zero through the first 58
minutes, when WSU junior
Jocelyn Jeffers scored on a
shot from the edge of the box
that went just inside the
right post.
Coming off a Friday night
upset victory over No. 21 Cal,
this is the first time since
2004 that WSU has beaten
two nationally ranked teams
in a row. It is also the first
time that Stanford has fallen
to the Cougars since 2003.
"It was a tough game,"
said head coach Paul Rat
cliffe after the game. "I give
a lot of credit to Washington
State. They fought really
hard and scored a nice goal."
With the loss, Stanford
fell to third in the Pac-12,
while Washington State took
sole possession of second
place. No. 2 UCLA, ranked

first in the Pac-12, clinched
the conference title Sunday
with a 2-0 victory against
Oregon.
The match against WSU
was Stanford's second road
match in a row and followed
a Thursday victory against
University of Washington.
WSU's Lower Soccer Field
has given the Cardinal trou
ble recently, resulting in
close wins in overtime and
the 86th minute in the Cardi
nal's past two matches there.
Sunday, despite outshooting
the Cougars 13-12, Stanford
could not convert.
Ratcliffe, however, does
n't think the end of the
team's championship reign
will have much effect on the
women's mindset going for
ward.
"I think we're disappoint
ed— we obviously always
want to win the champi
onship — but it's not easy,
it's difficult to do, and we had
a great run," Ratcliffe said.
"We've still got to keep get
ting better as a team, and
hopefully we'll have good
luck in the playoffs."
For now, Stanford will
have to look ahead to its final
regular season match
against Cal on Wednesday,
which will be Senior Night
for the Card.
"I think we've got to play
for the seniors it's their
last regular season home
game," Radcliffe added. "So
we've got to play for the sen
iors, and hopefully we can get
them off with a victory."
The match against Cal on
Wednesday begins at 7:30
p.m. at Cagan Stadium.
