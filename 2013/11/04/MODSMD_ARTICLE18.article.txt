# CUFFE WINS PAC-12 MEET
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
For the second year in a row, a
member of Stanford's women's
cross-country team claimed the in
dividual Pac-12 title. Junior Aisling
Cuffe continued her stellar season
with a victory in the women's 6-kilo
meter competition. Despite Cuffe's
standout race and junior Jim Rosa's
second-place finish in the men's 8-
kilometer race, however, both the
men's and women's teams left Col
orado without team victories as the
No. 13 men's team finished third
and the No. 20 women's team fin
ished a disappointing fifth at the
Pac-12 Championships.
Cuffe ensured that there was
very little drop-off in talent at the
top of the women's squad after the
departure of reigning individual
champion Kathy Kroeger 'l2 with
her victory in 21:04. Cuffe pulled
away from the pack during a power
ful final two kilometers, outpacing
all of her competitors by over 10
seconds.

Joining Cuffe in the top 10 of the
women's race was senior Jessica
Tonn (21:37), who finished in ninth
place after starting strong but fal
tering slightly in the last leg of the
race in the high-altitude environ
ment of Louisville, Colo.
"A lot of kids are scared of the al
titude," Cuffe told GoStanford.com.
"We went out pretty slow, and I
don't mind if the race goes out slow.
My plan is to run the first part of
my race in my comfort zone and
slowly build up and pick people off
who go out too fast too early."
After Cuffe and Tonn, however,
none of Stanford's other runners
finished in the top 30 individually.
The victorious Arizona women's
team finished three runners in the
top 10 and runner-up Colorado end
ed up with five runners in the top
30.
In the men's competition, Rosa
(24:42) finished just six seconds be
hind Edward Cheserek (24:36) of
Oregon after going neck and neck
with him for the first six kilometers.
The runner-up finish served as

Rosa's third individual top-three
finish of the season, with the only
exception being his 13th place
showing at Pre-Nationals last
month.
Behind Rosa, the remainder of
Stanford's contingent also ran sev
eral strong races to propel the Car
dinal into third place at 79 points
behind No. 1 Colorado (28 points)
and No. 4 Oregon (54 points), who
finished first and second, respec
tively.
Four Cardinal runners finished
in the top 20, with Rosa being
trailed by seniors Erik Olson (11th
place in 25:23), Michael Atchoo
(12th place in 25:30) and Tyler
Stutzman (20th place in 25:50).
However, nobody could outrun the
top-ranked Colorado team that
placed five runners in the top ten
and cruised to a second consecutive
conference meet victory.
Highly-touted freshman Sean
McGorty, who kept pace with the
top 10 through the first six kilome
ters, was forced to drop out of the
race late due to an illness and was

unable to follow up his fifth-place
finish at Pre-Nationals with what
would presumably have been anoth
er top-20 finish for the Cardinal.
Despite the solid performances
for the men and the largely disap
pointing showing for the women,
both teams know that the most im
portant challenges still lie ahead in
the NCAA West Regionals and
NCAA Championships later this
month.
"We were really happy with how
we ran," Rosa told GoStanford.com.
"But we also know this isn't the race
we're trying to do our best. We
don't want to get too high or too low
at this point."
The teams will rest their top
runners at the Doc Adams Invita
tional in Davis, Calif., this coming
Saturday before putting their sea
sons on the line at the NCAA Re
gionals a week later, at which they
will hope to qualify for the NCAA
Championships.

for the men and the largely disap
pointing showing for the women,
both teams know that the most im
portant challenges still lie ahead in
the NCAA West Regionals and
NCAA Championships later this
month.
"We were really happy with how
we ran," Rosa told GoStanford.com.
"But we also know this isn't the race
we're trying to do our best. We
don't want to get too high or too low
at this point."
The teams will rest their top
runners at the Doc Adams Invita
tional in Davis, Calif., this coming
Saturday before putting their sea
sons on the line at the NCAA Re
gionals a week later, at which they
will hope to qualify for the NCAA
Championships.
