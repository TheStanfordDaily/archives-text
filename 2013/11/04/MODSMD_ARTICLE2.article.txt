# Double The Run
## Second Arrillaga-funded recreation center focuses on outdoor education 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
John Arrillaga '6O made a sur
prise visit at the grand opening of the
new Arrillaga Outdoor Education
and Recreation Center (AOERC) on
Nov. 1.
The 75,000-square-foot center, lo
cated just west of Roble Field on San
ta Teresa Street, features a well-lit
rock climbing room designed for rope

climbing and bouldering, multipur
pose fitness studios and a 50-meter
swimming pool complete with a hand
icap ramp.
The project, which was originally
slated for completion in January
2014, was mainly funded by the Arril
laga family and Avery family.
"This is for the students and the
faculty and all the staff and all those
that work at Stanford," Arrillaga said
during his grand opening speech.

"We love doing it, and I hope to con
tinue to do it."
Ray Purpur, deputy athletic di
rector, explained that compared to
other gyms on campus, where varsity
teams may book space for practices,
the new center is geared towards
campus recreation for students, staff
and faculty.
According to Marion Avery, who
together with Arrillaga cut the rib
bon during the opening ceremony,

meeting students' need was a driving
force behind the project.
"I like the fact that John [Arrilla
ga] said when he was planning this
that, as far as the activities inside, he
wanted to wait and see what the stu
dents wanted, and that was one big
priority," Avery said.
The 50-meter Avery Recreational
Pool for instructional and recreation
al use the only one on campus with
a handicap ramp according to Purpur

is an example of how the new facil
ity attends to student demand.
"The Avery Aquatic Center pool
is so crowded all day long and into the
evening," Avery said. "This will be an
opportunity for this west side of cam
pus to have a place for both a gym
and for swimming."
Another such example is the rock
climbing room.
