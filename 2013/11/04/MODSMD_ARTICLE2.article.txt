# Double The Run
## Second Arrillaga-funded recreation center focuses on outdoor education 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
John Arrillaga '6O made a sur
prise visit at the grand opening of the
new Arrillaga Outdoor Education
and Recreation Center (AOERC) on
Nov. 1.
The 75,000-square-foot center, lo
cated just west of Roble Field on San
ta Teresa Street, features a well-lit
rock climbing room designed for rope

climbing and bouldering, multipur
pose fitness studios and a 50-meter
swimming pool complete with a hand
icap ramp.
The project, which was originally
slated for completion in January
2014, was mainly funded by the Arril
laga family and Avery family.
"This is for the students and the
faculty and all the staff and all those
that work at Stanford," Arrillaga said
during his grand opening speech.

"We love doing it, and I hope to con
tinue to do it."
Ray Purpur, deputy athletic di
rector, explained that compared to
other gyms on campus, where varsity
teams may book space for practices,
the new center is geared towards
campus recreation for students, staff
and faculty.
According to Marion Avery, who
together with Arrillaga cut the rib
bon during the opening ceremony,

meeting students' need was a driving
force behind the project.
"I like the fact that John [Arrilla
ga] said when he was planning this
that, as far as the activities inside, he
wanted to wait and see what the stu
dents wanted, and that was one big
priority," Avery said.
The 50-meter Avery Recreational
Pool for instructional and recreation
al use the only one on campus with
a handicap ramp according to Purpur

is an example of how the new facil
ity attends to student demand.
"The Avery Aquatic Center pool
is so crowded all day long and into the
evening," Avery said. "This will be an
opportunity for this west side of cam
pus to have a place for both a gym
and for swimming."
Another such example is the rock
climbing room.


ROGER CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Kevin Hopper, coordina
tor for indoor climbing events
and facilities, said that he has
extra staffers on hand for the
climbing room for the first
few weeks as he anticipates a
big crowd.
"We have a large climbing
community to begin with, but
I'm sure there's going to be a
lot of energy around the new
building," Hopper said.
Ellie Redding 'l6, who
was a Stanford Pre-Orienta
tion Trip (SPOT) leader this
year and is still involved in
the SPOT community, was
impressed with the new
climbing room.
"I love how much space
there is, especially with the
climbing wall," Redding said.
"After coming from the last
one, it was nice but it was
very cramped, and now we
have tons of space. It's a lot

taller everything is much
more open." Beatrice
Garrard 'l6, who is also in
volved in SPOT and the gen
eral outdoor education com
munity, said she was im
pressed with the center's fa
cilities.
"It's wonderful to see
more attention paid to the
outdoor education program,"
Garrard added.
Advertising for the grand
opening was kept limited due
to final touch-ups such as
making sure all the ID scan
ning systems were in order,
Purpur said.
"We wanted kind of a
gradual grand opening but
we think we will be busy
soon," he added.
While the center is now of
ficially open to all, details
such as setting up volleyball
and badminton nets will hap
pen over time depending on
student demand, Purpur
added.
