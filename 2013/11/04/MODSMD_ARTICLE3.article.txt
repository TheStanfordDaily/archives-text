### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
Clifford Nass, professor of communica
tion and director of the Communication
Between Humans & Interactive Media
(CHIMe) Lab, died of a heart attack this
weekend at age 55.
James Fishkin, chair of the Communi
cation Department, said Nass was attend
ing the Stanford Faculty and Staff Pro
gram of the Stanford Sierra Camp when
the fatal heart attack occurred.
Fishkin added that the news came as a
shock.
"He was a force of nature," Fishkin
said. "He was young and vibrant and real
ly at the peak of his career."
Colleagues and students alike will re
member Nass for his lasting contributions
to his academic field and to campus life.

A leader in his field
In academia, Nass has been well re
garded for his research on the socio-psy
chological aspects of human-computer in
teraction namely his revolutionary dis
covery of how people treat computers as
though they were human, as discussed in
the co-published book "The Media Equa
tion" with Communication Professor By
ron Reeves.
Jeremy Bailenson, director of the Vir
tual Human Interaction Lab and associate
professor of Communication, explained
that the impact of Nass' findings is seen
pervasively today in how people take so
cial relationships with media for granted.
"Nass has transformed not only the
field of communication, but the larger ar-

eas of social science and engi
neering as well," Bailenson
said in an email.
Fred Turner, associate
professor of communication,
also regards Nass as a major
contributor to the field, espe
cially through his work on
how placement of media tech
nologies in space helps shape
the way people think about
themselves and the world.
Nass was the first in his
family to attend college,
Turner said.

A mentor and a friend
While both Bailenson and

Turner recognize Nass' lega
cy in the field, they also cher
ish the lasting impact Nass
had on them as them faculty
mentor.
"I likely would not be a
professor if it were not for
Cliff," Bailenson said. "He
not only gave me a shot to be
a professor by taking a
chance on bringing me out
for an interview but spent
hundreds of hours over the
past decade mentoring me on
every academic skill imagina
ble."
Turner recalled that in
gratitude for Nass' support in
their pursuit of tenure, he
and Bailenson gave Nass a
Bailenson-Hirner award for
senior faculty mentorship.
Lorin Dole Ph. D. 'l5, who
worked with Nass for three

and-a-half years in the
CHIMe Lab, spoke highly of
Nass' support for those he
worked with.
"He's always been the
biggest advocate for his col
leagues and for his students'
work, even if it wasn't some
thing that he himself came
up, which is something that is
really humbling," Dole said.
"It didn't matter if you were a
skeptic or had experience in
the field, he had away of
bringing things to life and
helping you see them in ways
that you hadn't before."
Outside of the communi
cation field, Nass continued
his mentorship role with the
residents of the freshman
dorm Otero, where he served
as a Residential Fellow (RF)
for many years a role

which Turner said Nass
spoke about with a lot of af
fection.
"When I first got to Stan
ford and saw everyone
around, I questioned whether
or not I should be here. And
Cliff gave me the confidence
and idea that I didn't have to
prove [anything] to anyone
but myself," said Abhilasha
Belani 'l5, who lived in Otero
when Nass was an RF.
"He influenced my life by
giving support, and a lot of
my close friends are pro
foundly influenced by him,"
she added. "He never im
posed he was just there as
much as you needed."
Nass is survived by his son.
