## Solar Decathlon offers designers' dream job 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC 
Students often come to Stanford hoping to learn skills
for their future dream job, but for the students participat
ing in Solar Decathlon, the dream job came to them.
Hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy, Solar De
cathlon is a competition that brings together 19 teams
from around the world, each tasked with creating a sus
tainable home and presenting the work in Orange County,
which took place this past October. This year, Stanford
participated in the competition for the first time.
"It's a fantasy project for a product designer," said Max
Cougar Oswald 'l2 M.S. 'l4, a master's student who
worked on the Stanford design team in this year's compe-

tition. "They basically told
us there was an infinite
budget, we had full creative
freedom we could basical
ly make whatever we want."
Oswald and the other
Stanford designers named
their project Start.Home,
aiming to design a flexible
working and living space by
integrating modern technol
ogy with green initiatives.
Although the competition
has already ended the
Stanford team won first
place in Affordability and
third place in Market Appeal
the home is still in one
piece and is soon to be inhab
ited.
"It is actually going to
Jasper Ridge, a biological
preserve," said Lilly Shi 'l4,
communications lead for the
Stanford team. "The resi
dent ranger there lives on
the preserve with his wife
and daughter, and we're giv
ing them the house."
While the competition
was only a week long, prepa
rations and independent
study classes for this year's
project began immediately
after the Stanford team was
selected by the Department
of Energy in January 2012,
said Derek Ouyang 'l3, M.S.
'l4, the project manager for
the team.
To compete, schools must
submit proposals to the De
partment of Energy. Since
this was Stanford's first en
try in the competition,
Ouyang and five other stu
dents worked on finding fac
ulty advisors and University
support at the end of 2011.
The project timeline
roughly split into two halves,
with the planning and vision
being laid out in the first
year and implementation
taking place in the months
immediately preceding the
competition.
"The first part is all of
the design and the network
ing and getting sponsorship
and raising money," Shi said
of the timeline. "The second
part of it is actually using the
funds and using the ideas we
had."
The main design vision
that the group agreed on
features a device called the
core, a 12-by-15-foot box
that serves as the engine for
the home. Shi sees this core
as a mass-producible, funda
mental unit around which

any construction could be
created.
In June of 2013, the prod
uct design team was assem
bled to create tangible itera
tions of its outlined vision.
Most of the product design
team came from mechanical
engineering background or
the joint program in design.
"The classes worked on
concepts, but none of the
ideas made it past a white
board," Oswald said.
The job of the small de
sign team was to select the
ultimate design of the house
from several possible routes.
In the midst of this sum
mer's construction, Stanford
Solar Decathlon sent Oswald
to speak at TedX Orange
Coast about theories of de
sign as part of the project's
marketing campaign.
Oswald believes that a
good tool is an extension of
self, something he thinks he
created in his new sink de
sign for the Start.Home,
which is turned on and off
using one's legs, not hands.
"You use exactly as much
as you need every time by
default," Oswald said in his
talk. The results spoke for
themselves. Water usage in
his apartment went down by
two percent after he in
stalled the prototype in his
bathroom.
Over 200 people worked
on some part of the project
throughout the past two
years, with multiple people
joining and staying for only
a quarter. At any one time,
between 20 and 50 people
were working on the project.
Many team members
hope to continue in design or
architecture after gradua
tion. Part of the success of
the team, Oswald believes,
lies in this enthusiasm.
"The team was so into it
that we never had problems
with people shirking their
duties and just not following
through," Oswald said of the
team dynamic.
Looking into the future,
Shi said that the team will
check in periodically to in
terview the residents and
obtain data from the sensors
for future projects.
Oswald felt lucky to have
participated in this project
and encouraged students to
get involved.
"There should be more
projects like this," Oswald
said. "You have to solve real
world problems and on Stan
ford's budget."

Students often come to Stanford hoping to learn skills
for their future dream job, but for the students participat
ing in Solar Decathlon, the dream job came to them.
Hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy, Solar De
cathlon is a competition that brings together 19 teams
from around the world, each tasked with creating a sus
tainable home and presenting the work in Orange County,
which took place this past October. This year, Stanford
participated in the competition for the first time.
"It's a fantasy project for a product designer," said Max
Cougar Oswald 'l2 M.S. 'l4, a master's student who
worked on the Stanford design team in this year's compe-

The Stanford Solar Decatholon team competed against 19 other teams
from around the world to create an energy-sustainable home. Judged by
the U.S. Department of Energy, Stanford won awards in two categories.
tition. "They basically told
us there was an infinite
budget, we had full creative
freedom we could basical
ly make whatever we want."
Oswald and the other
Stanford designers named
their project Start.Home,
aiming to design a flexible
working and living space by
integrating modern technol
ogy with green initiatives.
Although the competition
has already ended the
Stanford team won first
place in Affordability and
third place in Market Appeal
the home is still in one
piece and is soon to be inhab
ited.
"It is actually going to
Jasper Ridge, a biological
preserve," said Lilly Shi 'l4,
communications lead for the
Stanford team. "The resi
dent ranger there lives on
the preserve with his wife
and daughter, and we're giv
ing them the house."
While the competition
was only a week long, prepa
rations and independent
study classes for this year's
project began immediately
after the Stanford team was
selected by the Department
of Energy in January 2012,
said Derek Ouyang 'l3, M.S.
'l4, the project manager for
the team.
To compete, schools must
submit proposals to the De
partment of Energy. Since
this was Stanford's first en
try in the competition,
Ouyang and five other stu
dents worked on finding fac
ulty advisors and University
support at the end of 2011.
The project timeline
roughly split into two halves,
with the planning and vision
being laid out in the first
year and implementation
taking place in the months
immediately preceding the
competition.
"The first part is all of
the design and the network
ing and getting sponsorship
and raising money," Shi said
of the timeline. "The second
part of it is actually using the
funds and using the ideas we
had."
The main design vision
that the group agreed on
features a device called the
core, a 12-by-15-foot box
that serves as the engine for
the home. Shi sees this core
as a mass-producible, funda
mental unit around which

any construction could be
created.
In June of 2013, the prod
uct design team was assem
bled to create tangible itera
tions of its outlined vision.
Most of the product design
team came from mechanical
engineering background or
the joint program in design.
"The classes worked on
concepts, but none of the
ideas made it past a white
board," Oswald said.
The job of the small de
sign team was to select the
ultimate design of the house
from several possible routes.
In the midst of this sum
mer's construction, Stanford
Solar Decathlon sent Oswald
to speak at TedX Orange
Coast about theories of de
sign as part of the project's
marketing campaign.
Oswald believes that a
good tool is an extension of
self, something he thinks he
created in his new sink de
sign for the Start.Home,
which is turned on and off
using one's legs, not hands.
"You use exactly as much
as you need every time by
default," Oswald said in his
talk. The results spoke for
themselves. Water usage in
his apartment went down by
two percent after he in
stalled the prototype in his
bathroom.
Over 200 people worked
on some part of the project
throughout the past two
years, with multiple people
joining and staying for only
a quarter. At any one time,
between 20 and 50 people
were working on the project.
