## SWIB shifts focus to cast wider net Stanford Women in Business adds evemts and recruits beyond women 
### ELIZABETH DAVIS 
Stanford Women in Business (SWIB) a
student group dedicated to providing opportu
nities for women interested in pursuing ca
reers in business underwent fundamental
changes this year from event scheduling to ex
panding its audience beyond women.
Co-Presidents Lindsey Wilder 'l4 and
Lauryn Isford 'l5 said the changes reflect the
group's commitment to evolving its focus.
In the past, SWIB's most prominent event
was the annual spring conference typically
a day filled with workshops and panelists in
cluding professors from the d.school, finance
experts, local entrepreneurs and corporate-re
lated speakers like last year's keynote speak
ers Evan Spiegel 'l2, CEO and co-founder of
Snapchat, and Drew Houston, CEO and co
founder of Dropbox.
This year, the conference will be split into
three quarterly speaker events and renamed
the Executive Leadership Series, inviting
high-caliber business speakers to lecture in
front of Stanford's pre-business student audi
ence.
The change was intended to allow more
students to attend SWIB's events since they
require shorter time commitments. Both
Wilder and Isford spearheaded the spring
conference last year and understood the value
in shortening the event to make it more com
pact.
"This is a decision process that has lasted
for a few years," Isford said. "Every year, past,
present and future presi
dents think about how to
make things better.
"The entire SWIB group
agrees that the new speaker
series would make it easier
for everyone in SWIB and
make it easier for people out
side of SWIB," Isford added.
SWIB was founded nine
years ago by undergraduates
who wanted to learn more
about business and educate
women about pursuing ca
reers in the business world.
Since its establishment, it has
developed into a 30-member
leadership core team that
reaches out to a general
group of over 1,000 students

who attend conferences and
engage in organized events.
Throughout the year, SWIB
board members provide edu
cational opportunities for
these pre-business students
by organizing speaker series
and facilitating workshops.
"Our mission is to provide
business education to all
Stanford students, especially
women, to help them foster
the skills they need to grow in
their career," Wilder said.
"We're also focused on mak
ing sure that we are a re
source to these students."
In recent years, the or
ganization has begun to edu
cate the entirety of Stan
ford's pre-business popula
tion rather than focusing
them resources on women. A
specific focus for this year,
the presidents have worked
on making SWIB events

equally popular for both gen
ders.
"We want to emphasize
that we want everyone in the
Stanford community to bene
fit from our events," Isford
said. "It's more than just
about getting our 30 girls ed
ucated we want all of Stan
ford's men and women to be
educated the best we can."
Along with changes to
SWIB's target audience and
annual conference, SWIB has
also rearranged the leader
ship team to include younger
members. Isford is the
youngest president appoint
ed by SWIB.
"One thing that's differ
ent, that's also kind of cool, is
that our board for this year is
very young something
very exciting for SWIB,"
Wilder said. "There's a new
energy that comes with hav

ing a young board."
The co-presidents hope
that the board's youth will
bring consistency to the orga
nization's leadership as they
continue to transform the
structure and branding of the
organization. Yet their main
mission remains clear: to ex
pose as many Stanford stu
dents as possible to careers in
business.
"Over time, and since we
became presidents, we've re
ally pushed forward with the
evolution of SWIB," Wilder
said. "It was a gradual
process but once we became
presidents we tried to put in
place the evolution and re
finement of team and the
things that we need to focus
on our core mission."
