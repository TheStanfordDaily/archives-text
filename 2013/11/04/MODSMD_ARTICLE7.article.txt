# Q&A
## MICHAEL KIRST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 
### SRI MUPPIDI 
Michael Kirst, professor emeritus of
education and business administration
at Stanford, currently serves as the
President of the California State Board
of Education. As president, Kirst has
played an influential role in California
public schools' transition to the Com
mon Core State Standards (CCSS),
which was implemented at the begin
ning of this school year.
The CCSS aims to align diverse state
curricula to a consistent, clear set of
standards nationwide that students are
expected to learn. Forty-five states, the
District of Columbia, four territories
and the Department of Defense Educa
tion Activity have already independent
ly adopted the standards. Kirst sat
down with The Daily to reflect on the
CCSS implementation process in Cali
fornia so far.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why were
the [state] standards changed to the
Common Core State Standards?
Michael Kirst (MK): Our feeling was
that the standards in the past had im
proved education. They helped improve
the system, but we needed two things.
One was that, with very different stan
dards in each state and a lot of movement
across states, there was a need for some
thing common. The second thing was
that the standards needed to be fewer,
deeper and higher.
TSD: What do you mean by fewer, deep
er and higher?
MK: Fewer means that there needs to be
fewer focused topics. Take math for an
example. Before the Common Core,
math had too many topics. There was not
enough focus on them because there
were a lot of repeated topics and bad se
quencing. But Common Core focuses on
important topics relevant to the real
world.
Deeper means that students need to
evaluate, interpret and estimate. Too
much of what we did was read something
and recall it. Students gave opinions but
did not refer to sources. There was noth-

ing to get a student to go deeper. Com
mon Core assessments now encourage
students to go further.
And higher. Prior standards for K-12
weren't aligned or endorsed by post-sec
ondary education. We had a disconnect
there. Common Core standards now pro
vide assessments to see whether stu
dents are ready for post-secondary edu
cation without remediation. This has nev
er happened before. For K-12, we were
on our own, but now we are working with
higher education.
TSD: What will the broader impacts of
these new standards be?
MK: The first major impact is that the
number of students who are judged pro
ficient or college ready will be smaller
than those deemed ready from the cur
rent tests. Proficiency percentages will
drop because we are raising the bar.
Another effect will be that students
will know whether they're ready for a

post-secondary technical program or a
four-year college program. Many stu
dents come into community colleges and
realize that they're not ready for college.
Then, they have to go through remedial
education. But with Common Core, stu
dents will get much clearer signals on
what path to take.
TSD: Describe the implementation
process so far.
MK: It's going to take a long time. It
won't be over in a year or two because
we've made an enormous amount of state
policy in California and changed our as
sessments. We have adopted new text
books, digital materials and lesson units.
We have better teacher preparation pro
grams and will be providing more profes
sional development.
Assessments will now include com
puter-adaptive assessment, not bubble
testing or multiple choice. We are moving
to testing with extended responses and
performance exams to evaluate various
responses from students. We also built
better partnerships with post-secondary
education institutes. This changes almost
everything.

TSD: What are some of the challenges in
the implementation process?
MK: There are 310,000 teachers in Cali
fornia, and the biggest challenge is to get
all those teachers to teach deeper, higher
and more focused than in the past. Get
ting the teachers ready will be the
largest task.
TSD: How will CCSS better prepare stu
dents for the real world?
MK: We believe most people growing up
in the 21st century need some education
beyond high school, at least some form of
post-secondary education. This current
economy is different than in the past.
Students need to think to solve prob
lems and put together evidence to come
to conclusions. They need to apply what
they learn, which is why Common Core
is important.
