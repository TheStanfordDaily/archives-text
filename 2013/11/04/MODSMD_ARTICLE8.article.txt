## Postseason fate hangs in the balance 
### Sam Fisher 
With all of the pre
season rhetoric
about Stanford
having potentially
its best chance in
history at a BCS National Champi
onship, I can't help but pause and
chuckle at the irony heading into a
date with Oregon. Stanford is a huge
underdog, but the Cardinal is guar
anteed to capture the Pac-12 Title if it
wins out and could easily make the
Rose Bowl with a win or a loss to the
Ducks.
Sound familiar? It's exactly the
same outlook besides a slightly
smaller double-digit point spread
and a small back-door shot at a na
tional title that Stanford had
heading into Autzen Stadium just un
der a year ago.
Heading into both seasons, not
many people would have expected
that scenario to be the case. This sea
son, the loss to Utah shocked most
around the program and seems
more shocking with each Utah per
formance since; last season, few ex
pected that then-sophomore quar
terback Kevin Hogan could save the
season the way he did.
But those offseason storylines
have now disappeared for the new
reality. On Thursday night around 9
p.m., another storyline will disap
pear. Whether it's the one that has
Stanford beating the Ducks or Ore
gon stomping the Cardinal on the
way to a date with Alabama in Janu
ary remains to be seen, and each sce
nario has veiy different long-term ef
fects.
If Stanford can beat Oregon
which has to be at least as likely as
Nick Foles throwing seven touch
downs against Oakland yesterday
the Cardinal will be in prime position
for a great postseason. USC is look
ing like a tougher game every week,
but if Stanford can take care of busi
ness in Los Angeles then home con
tests against Cal and Notre Dame
shouldn't be too tough at all.
A sweep of those three games
would make Stanford the host of the
Pac-12 Championship Game for the
second year in a row, most likely
against Arizona State or UCLA.
Stanford looked great against both of
those teams, abusing the Sun Devils
for 45 minutes and shutting down the
Bruins for 60, so it would be reason
able to feel very confident in a victory.
At that point, Stanford's worst
case destination with a victory would
be the Rose Bowl. It would probably
take losses from both Florida State
and Ohio State to put the Cardinal in
the national championship, and I
don't see that happening. It's worth
noting that a loss in the Pac-12 title
game would be the worst possible
outcome for Stanford, as the winner
of the game would go the Rose Bowl
and Oregon would most likely grab
the second BCS at-large spot, send
ing the Cardinal to the Alamo Bowl.
If Stanford loses to Oregon, the
Cardinal will still have a good chance
at playing in the Rose Bowl but will
cede control of that destiny. If the
Cardinal can avoid the Trojan trap
and win out after Thursday, it would
probably replace an undefeated Ore
gon in the Rose Bowl, assuming the
Ducks go to the national champi
onship game.
If for some reason Oregon does
n't go to the championship game and
ends up in the Rose Bowl, Stanford
might actually end up in the Sugar
Bowl, which would be an intriguing
prospect. Stanford has played at all
three of the other BCS sites, so a
Sugar Bowl berth in New Orleans
would be a fun consolation prize for a
two-loss Stanford team.
11l give a full breakdown of what
to watch for in Thursday's paper, but
in my brief opinion, the deciding fac
tor in which of these paths Stanford
will be heading down when it goes to
bed Thursday night is the Cardinal of
fense. Heading into Autzen last year, a
resurgent offense led by a spark plug
named Kevin Hogan did just enough
to allow Stanford to capitalize on an
epic defensive performance.
It would be unfair to expect Stan
ford's defense to be quite so spectac
ular for a second consecutive year, es
pecially with injuries on the defensive
line, so it'll be up to the offense to buy
them a few mulligans. We'll see if that
happens come Thursday night.
