# STOPPING OREGON'S ZONE READ
## CARD WILL TRY TO REPEAT 2012 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford football has played
four ranked opponents in its last
six games, but it will face by far
its biggest test yet on Thursday
against the third-ranked Oregon
Ducks. Stanford is 2-2 in its last
four games against Oregon, but
what most people seem to be
talking about is Stanford's 17-14
upset victory in Eugene last
year. Even though the great
Chip Kelly left Oregon for the
Philadelphia Eagles after last
season, Oregon has hardly
missed a beat under new head
coach Mark Helfrich, and the
Ducks' offense is extremely diffi
cult to stop.

excellent safety play, conser
vative pass defense and de
fensive penetration along the
offensive line. With its speed,
Oregon thrives on oppo
nents' mistakes, and last
year, Stanford simply didn't
make them. Indeed, by tak
ing a page from the playbook
of the legendary 1985 Chica
go Bears defense, Stanford
actually forced a few mis
takes of Oregon's own.
This graphic depicts Ore
gon's most übiquitous run
ning play, the outside zone: a
play that presents opportu
nities to attack both downhill
and to the outside (outlined
in yellow). The offensive
linemen step in unison to
ward the right (or the left),
blocking the first men they
see to their right, double
teaming when they have the
opportunity and driving to
ward the linebackers. The
running back patiently waits
for a hole in the defense and
hits whatever running lane
he finds. Additionally, Ore
gon's quarterback Marcus
Mariota will almost invari
ably option off a player (the
blue triangle), neutralizing
him by threatening to run in
his direction. The real dan
ger of the option, however, is
not Mariota's speed but the
fact that it frees up an offen
sive lineman to block a dif
ferent defensive player.
By spreading out its of
fensive line, Oregon also
stretches the Stanford de
fense, so that if Stanford's
players get out of position,
the Ducks will have ex
tremely wide running lanes.
(Offensive line splits are ex
aggerated for clarity.)
Spreading the field to mini
mize the defense's margin of
error has been a boon for the
Ducks, who have routinely
been among the nation's top
offenses since adopting the
spread option attack. After
Stanford aligned its defen
sive linemen in its guard
center-guard Bear front (a
highly aggressive tactic pop
ularized by the aforemen
tioned Bears) last year, how
ever, the Ducks' spread actu
ally allowed Stanford to
break up the Oregon line.
Here, Stanford knew that
by zone-blocking rules, Ore
gon's linemen would block
only players to their right.
The Cardinal lined up three
players over Oregon's
guards and center, forcing
one-on-ones for these play
ers, and aligned its players
to take advantage of the
zone rules. Here, the back
side defensive end (E, red
arrow) was shaded just out
side the left guard, head-up
with the guard's left shoul
der. Because the end is tech
nically to the left of the
guard, the guard will block
the defensive tackle (T) and
pass off the end to the left
tackle.
Because of Oregon's wide
line splits, the tackle had a
very difficult block to make:
Stanford's end was nearly a
yard away and slanted away
from him as well. Notice that
Oregon's outside zone re
sembled Oregon State's
slide protection from last
game: With the Bear front,
the geometry of the play was
the same. Just as fifth-year
senior defensive end Ben
Gardner knifed through the
Oregon State line to sack
Sean Mannion last week, so
Stanford's line had a free
shot at Mariota (see the red
arrow) as he prepared to
hand the ball off to one of
Oregon's dangerous running
backs.
This alignment stretched
Stanford's front six more
than I'd like, and last year
the Ducks had some success
when they attacked up the
middle where Stanford

only had one second-level
defender instead of tak
ing the ball to the outside.
However, when the Oregon
run game was pushed to
wards the middle, Stanford's
safeties ($ and F/S) were
free to clean up anything
that came through, allowing
some gains but preventing
long touchdowns.
With the outside runs
held in check, the only big
play threat Oregon had left
was its downfield passing
game, and Stanford's con
servative Cover 4 coverage
kept a lid on Oregon's re
ceivers as well Oregon
quarterback Marcus Mario
ta had an uncharacteristical
ly shaky night, with only two
completions of 20 yards or
longer the entire game.
Overall, Stanford allowed
only two Oregon scores on
fifteen drives.
The success of Stanford's
defensive front was undeni
able: By generating penetra
tion on the line of scrim
mage, Stanford shut down
Oregon's best running play,
and the Ducks were hobbled
all night. How Oregon re
sponds to the Bear front on
Thursday will hugely influ
ence Oregon's national
championship hopes and
perhaps keep Stanford's
alive.
Watch out for an extend
ed preview of the Oregon
offense later in the week.

By spreading out its of
fensive line, Oregon also
stretches the Stanford de
fense, so that if Stanford's
players get out of position,
the Ducks will have ex
tremely wide running lanes.
(Offensive line splits are ex
aggerated for clarity.)
Spreading the field to mini
mize the defense's margin of
error has been a boon for the
Ducks, who have routinely
been among the nation's top
offenses since adopting the
spread option attack. After
Stanford aligned its defen
sive linemen in its guard
center-guard Bear front (a
highly aggressive tactic pop
ularized by the aforemen
tioned Bears) last year, how
ever, the Ducks' spread actu
ally allowed Stanford to
break up the Oregon line.
Here, Stanford knew that
by zone-blocking rules, Ore
gon's linemen would block
only players to their right.
The Cardinal lined up three
players over Oregon's
guards and center, forcing
one-on-ones for these play
ers, and aligned its players
to take advantage of the
zone rules. Here, the back
side defensive end (E, red
arrow) was shaded just out
side the left guard, head-up
with the guard's left shoul
der. Because the end is tech
nically to the left of the
guard, the guard will block
the defensive tackle (T) and
pass off the end to the left
tackle.
Because of Oregon's wide
line splits, the tackle had a
very difficult block to make:
Stanford's end was nearly a
yard away and slanted away
from him as well. Notice that
Oregon's outside zone re
sembled Oregon State's
slide protection from last
game: With the Bear front,
the geometry of the play was
the same. Just as fifth-year
senior defensive end Ben
Gardner knifed through the
Oregon State line to sack
Sean Mannion last week, so
Stanford's line had a free
shot at Mariota (see the red
arrow) as he prepared to
hand the ball off to one of
Oregon's dangerous running
backs.
This alignment stretched
Stanford's front six more
than I'd like, and last year
the Ducks had some success
when they attacked up the
middle where Stanford

only had one second-level
defender instead of tak
ing the ball to the outside.
However, when the Oregon
run game was pushed to
wards the middle, Stanford's
safeties ($ and F/S) were
free to clean up anything
that came through, allowing
some gains but preventing
long touchdowns.
With the outside runs
held in check, the only big
play threat Oregon had left
was its downfield passing
game, and Stanford's con
servative Cover 4 coverage
kept a lid on Oregon's re
ceivers as well Oregon
quarterback Marcus Mario
ta had an uncharacteristical
ly shaky night, with only two
completions of 20 yards or
longer the entire game.
Overall, Stanford allowed
only two Oregon scores on
fifteen drives.
The success of Stanford's
defensive front was undeni
able: By generating penetra
tion on the line of scrim
mage, Stanford shut down
Oregon's best running play,
and the Ducks were hobbled
all night. How Oregon re
sponds to the Bear front on
Thursday will hugely influ
ence Oregon's national
championship hopes and
perhaps keep Stanford's
alive.
Watch out for an extend
ed preview of the Oregon
offense later in the week.

Stanford football has played
four ranked opponents in its last
six games, but it will face by far
its biggest test yet on Thursday
against the third-ranked Oregon
Ducks. Stanford is 2-2 in its last
four games against Oregon, but
what most people seem to be
talking about is Stanford's 17-14
upset victory in Eugene last
year. Even though the great
Chip Kelly left Oregon for the
Philadelphia Eagles after last
season, Oregon has hardly
missed a beat under new head
coach Mark Helfrich, and the
Ducks' offense is extremely diffi
cult to stop.
The principles underlying
Stanford's defeat of the Ducks
were discipline in the run game,

excellent safety play, conser
vative pass defense and de
fensive penetration along the
offensive line. With its speed,
Oregon thrives on oppo
nents' mistakes, and last
year, Stanford simply didn't
make them. Indeed, by tak
ing a page from the playbook
of the legendary 1985 Chica
go Bears defense, Stanford
actually forced a few mis
takes of Oregon's own.
This graphic depicts Ore
gon's most übiquitous run
ning play, the outside zone: a
play that presents opportu
nities to attack both downhill
and to the outside (outlined
in yellow). The offensive
linemen step in unison to
ward the right (or the left),
blocking the first men they
see to their right, double
teaming when they have the
opportunity and driving to
ward the linebackers. The
running back patiently waits
for a hole in the defense and
hits whatever running lane
he finds. Additionally, Ore
gon's quarterback Marcus
Mariota will almost invari
ably option off a player (the
blue triangle), neutralizing
him by threatening to run in
his direction. The real dan
ger of the option, however, is
not Mariota's speed but the
fact that it frees up an offen
sive lineman to block a dif
ferent defensive player.
By spreading out its of
fensive line, Oregon also
stretches the Stanford de
fense, so that if Stanford's
players get out of position,
the Ducks will have ex
tremely wide running lanes.
