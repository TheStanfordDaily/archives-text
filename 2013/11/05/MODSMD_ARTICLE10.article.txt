Junior David Nolan (above) secured victories in the 200-yard freestyle and 200-yard backstroke on
Saturday, contributing to the Cardinal's dominant 175-116 defeat of Wisconsin. The men will look to
continue their success at their yearly triple-distance meet at rival Cal this Wednesday in Berkeley.
final two events the 400-
yard individual medley (IM)
and the 200-yard freestyle

relay.
Unsurprisingly, Stan
ford's leading swimmer for
the meet was junior David
Nolan, who swam the open
ing 50-yard butterfly leg of
the 200-yard medley relay
almost 0.7 seconds faster
than his closest competition,

securing a Cardinal victory
for the event. Nolan went on
to claim individual victories
in the 200-yard freestyle in
1:37:60 more than a full
second faster than the sec
ond place swimmer and in
the 200-yard backstroke, in
which he swam a strong final
50 yards to snatch a come
back victory from Wisconsin
junior Drew Teduits.
Senior Mason Shaw,
along with freshman Max
Williamson and sophomores
Tom Kremer, Gray Umbach
and Ben Lovell also con
tributed first-place finishes
in other individual events.
The divers had a successful
showing, with junior Krist
ian Ipsen handily claiming
first place in the 1-meter
event by a margin of 50
points and the Cardinal
claiming a sweep of the top
three in the 3-meter event,
as freshman Bradley Chris
tensen impressed with his
first-place finish and junior
Connor Kuremsky and sen
ior Noah Garcia rounded out
the top three.
Meanwhile, the women
continued their strong start
to the season with an utterly
dominant performance. The
Cardinal emerged victorious
in every event and crushed
the Badger women by a mar
gin of more than 100 points.
Senior Felicia Lee, fresh

man Lia Neal, senior Maya
Dißado and sophomore
Sarah Haase all contributed
standout performances with
two individual victories
apiece. Lee also swam the
opening legs of both of Stan
ford's victories in the relay
events the 200-yard
freestyle relay and 200-yard
medley relay.
Junior Maddy Schaefer
also contributed a standout
sprinting performance in the
50-yard freestyle. Her time
of 22.37 in the event marks
the fastest time in the nation
this season—just one-hun
dredth of a second faster
than Ivy Martin of Wiscon
sin, who finished as the run
ner-up in the event.
The meet also marked the
first competitive diving meet
of the fall for the women's
diving team, which im
pressed by sweeping the top
two spots in the 3-meter
event and the top three spots
in the 1-meter event, which
were won by senior
Stephanie Phipps and fresh
man Kassidy Cook, respec
tively.
The women will next trav
el to College Station, Texas,
to compete in the Art Adam
son Invitational hosted by
Texas A&M University to
wrap up the fall portion of
their schedule. The invita
tional will offer them a

chance to compete in a non
dual-meet setting for the
first time this year and will
allow them to measure where
they stand with respect to
other established programs
around the nation.
The men will also head to
an invitational at the end of
the month the UNLV In
vitational in Las Vegas af
ter its final meet of the fall on
Wednesday against tradi
tional powerhouse and third
ranked Cal (3-0). The meet
promises to be a tough draw
for the Cardinal, as the Gold
en Bears have not lost a dual
meet in their last 10 contests
and are the defending NCAA
runners-up.
The Cal meet will not be a
traditional, scored dual meet
between the two squads, and
instead will offer each squad
a chance to size up the oth
er's talent in a triple-distance
meet format. Both teams will
divide into specialty groups
sprinting freestyle, dis
tance freestyle, butterfly,
backstroke, breaststroke and
IM and individuals in each
group will swim three races
to determine a champion
from each grouping.
The cross-Bay rivals will
square off on Wednesday at
2 p.m. in Berkeley
