## Weekend ends with one point 
### DYLAN FUGEL 
Despite top-notch game play,
the men's soccer team faced disap
pointing end results this weekend
as the Cardinal fell to No. 3 UCLA
2-1 on Friday evening making it
the third straight one-goal loss for
the team and then went on to tie
San Diego State 1-1 on Sunday.

Stanford came out fighting on
Friday, outshooting the Bruins 15-8
overall, but was unable to put the
game away at the end of the match.
The match opened with very few
chances except for a run by fresh
man forward Jordan Morris that
tested UCLA goalie Earl Edwards
Jr., who made seven saves through
out the game.

Stanford got rewarded for its
dominance in the 31st minute of
play when sophomore midfielder
iy Thompson dispossessed UCLA
midfielder Jordan Vale before lay
ing the ball off to junior Zach Bat
teer, whose setup allowed Morris to
blast the ball left-footed past a div
ing Edwards for his fifth goal of the
season.
Batteer, Morris and junior wing
back Jimmy Callinan would have
chances to extend the lead, but
Stanford was punished when
UCLA's senior midfielder Victor
Munoz slipped a through ball to
freshman forward Gage Zerboni,
who put away the equalizer in the
40th minute.
UCLA came out firing after
halftime, with Nathan Smith scor
ing the eventual winner just two
minutes after the restart. Stanford
dominated the rest of the game,
however, with Morris having two
shots cleared off the line and junior
midfielder Bobby Edwards having
multiple shots saved by Edwards.
The match finished 2-1 in favor of
the Bruins, but Stanford's perform
ance was encouraging.
"We know we're right there
against the best teams in the coun
try and we'll be there at the end of
the season," said head coach Jere
my Gunn.
The Cardinal went on to face
SDSU on Sunday in a testy match
that featured 38 shots and five
bookings, including two red cards.
Stanford dominated the game, but
could not convert for a victory. The
Cardinal threw away a late 1-0 lead
with a man advantage in the 85th
minute to allow the match to go to
overtime.
Batteer, Morris, Edwards and
midfielders Aaron Kovar and J J
Koval saw several chances through
out the match, but the first goal

didn't come until the 77th
minute, when Morris scored
a solo goal by beating two
defenders and unleashing a
rocket into the top corner of
the goal. However, the Car
dinal goal and the Aztec red
card only seemed to galva
nize SDSU, which suddenly
came back into the match to
earn a late equalizer.
The Cardinal continued
to be plagued by missed
chances in overtime, with a
bicycle kick by Koval tipped
onto the bar by SDSU's
goalie John Marcuzzo, a
Batteer header saved and a
Koval header missed before
Callinan was sent off for a
second yellow card, evening
up the numbers. The second
overtime favored SDSU,
however, with several
missed chances by the
Aztecs offense. Still, neither
team could break the tie be
fore time expired.
The men's soccer team
will now look to regroup
from this weekend's short
coming when it goes on a
two-match road trip to the
Pacific Northwest. The
Card plays at the No. 4
Washington Huskies and
the Oregon State Beavers.
Friday's match in Seattle
kicks off at 7 p.m.
