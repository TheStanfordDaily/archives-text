## SUPER TUESDAY Reform The Vote 
### Marshall Watkins 
Voter ID laws consumed much
of the media's attention in the
run-up to last year's presiden
tial election, and with good reason.
Changing the rules governing who
can vote where and when has the
potential to reshape the fundamen
tal dynamics of American politics.
The potential for electoral fraud
is just the tip of the iceberg when it
comes to exercising the right to
vote in the United States, and it is
almost certainly not even the most
concerning part.
In a vacuum, recent Republican
efforts to mandate that voters pres
ent government-issued photo iden
tification at the polls before being
allowed to vote has merit. A demo
cratic system's most inviolable
right is the right to vote; failing to
take all reasonable steps to ensure
that only those entitled to that right
can exercise it could reasonably be
depicted as negligent at best, and
requiring the presentation of a ba
sic form of ID would seem to pose
little inconvenience to most citizens.
Of course, such voter ID laws
as currently encountered in state
legislatures across the United
States address a problem that
doesn't actually exist. Electoral
fraud in the United States is negli
gible, almost to the point of irrele
vancyâ€” while successful electoral
fraud would of course evade detec
tion, allegations of the practice are
also practically unknown.
On the other hand, however, vot
er ID laws would have a very real
and a very pernicious effect
on the 3.2 million Americans who
don't currently possess a govern
ment-issued photo ID.
Those Americans tend to be dis
proportionately poor, elderly or
members of minority groups
groups that tend, in other words, to
lean Democratic come election
time, to the extent that the passage
of a voter ID law in Pennsylvania
prompted the state legislature's
Republican leader to declare a (pre
mature) victory for Mitt Romney in
the 2012 presidential election.
Such partisan intent risks fram
ing voting as a privilege rather than
a right, to the distinct detriment of

the American political process as a
whole, and has been fairly criticized
as such.
Nevertheless, the American vot
er registration system remains rid
dled with errors that both impose
an additional cost on citizens and
presents the potential for the dis
tortion of elections from the local
level to the federal one.
One in four eligible American
voters around 51 million people
aren't registered to vote, while
1.8 million dead people are. One in
eight active registrations, in all, is
invalid or inaccurate including
12 million registrations with suffi
cient errors to preclude voters be
ing reached by important mailings
and 2.8 million people have reg
istrations in more than one state.
The current system, which relies
on voters bearing the burden of
registration rather than the central
government assuming responsibili
ty, differs from most other modern
democracies, and visibly so. While
Oregon, for example, spent $4.11
per active voter to process registra
tions, Canada which has regis
tered 93% of its eligible voter
has done the same task at less than
$0.35 per voter.
More critically, in 2008, more
than 2.2 million votes were lost
across the United States because of
registration problems, a sum that
even without any clear partisan
bias has the potential to shape
notoriously close elections like the
presidential race in 2000.
Thankfully, most of the proposed
reforms under consideration are
largely reflections of common
sense. From centralizing voter
records and matching them to other
information like Social Security
data that voters may actually re
member to keep up to date to mov
ing the entire process away from
cumbersome manual entries to an
online database, the issue should be
relatively easy to resolve. Far more
so than voter ID laws, doing so
would offer a fairer and more repre
sentative process for all.
