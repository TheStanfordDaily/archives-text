# SUPER TUESDAY
## Reflections on Suffrage 
### Nick Ahamed 
Today is Election Day. It was
one year ago that Barack
Obama was re-elected and
165 years ago that the first presi
dential election took place on "the
day after the first Monday of No
vember." In many ways we've come
far since then, namely through the
expansion of voting rights in
amendments 14, 15, 17, 19, 23, 24
and 26. Yet, we've seen a troubling
reversal of these trends as of late.
1965 saw significant progress as
Congress enacted the Voting
Rights Act of 1965. Section 4 of that
law established a formula for iden
tifying states and counties where
voting rights were not equal. The
states and counties singled out by
Section 4 were then subject to vari
ous regulations that sought to im
prove voting equality.
Sadly, in June of this year, the
Supreme Court struck down Sec
tion 4 in Shelby County, Alabama v.
Holder, Attorney General, et al. In
so doing, they invalidated much of

the rest of the law. A majority of the
court felt that the need for the law
is outdated: "While any racial dis
crimination in voting is too much,
Congress must ensure that the leg
islation it passes to remedy that
problem speaks to current condi
tions."
While perhaps the Court was
right that the 1975 formula could be
updated, the need for strong voter
protection laws is needed now as
much as ever.
Fully 34 states have now passed
voter ID legislation. While mandat
ing an ID to vote sounds reason
able, it is entirely problematic for
our democracy. The Wall Street
Journal reports that 11 percent of
Americans do not have the re
quired identification.
This broad trend is even more
frightening when you look at specif
ic demographics. South Carolina's
law makes minorities 20 percent
more likely to be disenfranchised
than white registered voters. Na
tionwide, about 25 percent of
African-Americans lack the requi
site photo ID of many states' laws.
Mother Jones reports that nine
states have enacted legislation that
is tougher on women. These laws,
most recently passed in Texas,
mandate that an individual's voting
records and photo identification
match. For women who change
names after they marry, but do not
immediately change their names
for all documents about 34 per
cent of voting-age female citizens
voting will be harder.
Young people too will face new
barriers. Just over 60 percent of 18-
year-olds had a driver's license in
2008. This is especially troublesome
given the young people's historical
ly low turnout in elections. In 2012,
only 41.2 percent of people aged 18
to 24 voted, compared to 66.3 per
cent of citizens over the age of 30.
Stopping voter fraud is a noble
task. But, is it mere coincidence

that it is largely Democratic sup
porters who are affected? After all,
Obama won the African-American
vote by 87 percentage points,
women by 11 points and 18- to 29-
year-olds by 23 points.
The Pennsylvania state House
Republican leader, Mike Tuzai, put
it more bluntly: Voter ID "is going
to allow Governor Romney to win
the state of Pennsylvania."
Pennsylvania's law ended up be
ing blocked by a judge in Apple
white, et al. v. Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, et al in October 2012.
Even still, 35,000 citizens were de
terred from voting by the mere
possibility of voter identification
checks. Nevertheless, President
Obama carried the state by 5
points.
These statistics are deeply
sobering and are difficult to recon
cile with our principles of govern
ment. Indeed, Thomas Paine wrote
in 1795, "The true and only true ba
sis of representative government is
equality of rights. Every man has a
right to one vote, and no more in
the choice of representatives."
We should be expanding access
to voting, not restricting it, espe
cially not for partisan gain.
That being said, states' power to
regulate voting rights is a double
edged sword. We have seen, on the
one side, their willingness to revoke
them. However, with little hope of
Congressional action on the matter,
it enables us to make more of a dif
ference.
State legislators are more acces
sible than congressmen. They also
hold smaller districts and are more
accountable to you. As you reflect
on your suffrage this Election Day,
I encourage you to reach out to
your state representative and see
where he or she stands on voting
rights.
