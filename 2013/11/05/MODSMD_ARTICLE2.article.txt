# Stanford delays EA deadline
## Common Application glitches push back early app due dates nationwide 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford undergraduate ad
mission closed Restrictive Early
Action submissions at 11:59 p.m.
Monday night, after extending
the original deadline by three
days due to technical difficulties
with the Common Application.
Stanford joined several other
schools around the country in
postponing the early deadline.
"We realized that the techni
cal challenges are real and we re
ally felt [giving] an opportunity
to the applicants would really
help their process as much as

possible," said Associate Dean
and Director of Admission
Colleen Lim M.A. 'BO. "We ap
preciate the process and the
frustration that [students] have
gone through, and that's one of
the reasons that we chose to ex
tend the deadline."
The Common Application, the
online college admission plat
form that is used by more than
500 schools, has had widely docu
mented glitches since a new ver
sion was rolled out last summer.
"This new application system
was intended to be a more robust
system able to effectively guide
applicants and schools through

the complex college application
process and to efficiently handle
the growth of student applica
tions and related forms," wrote
Scott Anderson, senior director
of policy for the Common Appli
cation, in a statement to The Dai
ly. "As with any new technological
launch, some difficulties arose af
ter launch and as more users in

teracted with the system."
Jake Cook, a high school sen
ior from Georgia, said that he
didn't have major issues with his
Stanford application because he
had turned it early, but that he
has had problems working on his
application for other schools.
