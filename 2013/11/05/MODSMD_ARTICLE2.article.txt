# Stanford delays EA deadline
## Common Application glitches push back early app due dates nationwide 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford undergraduate ad
mission closed Restrictive Early
Action submissions at 11:59 p.m.
Monday night, after extending
the original deadline by three
days due to technical difficulties
with the Common Application.
Stanford joined several other
schools around the country in
postponing the early deadline.
"We realized that the techni
cal challenges are real and we re
ally felt [giving] an opportunity
to the applicants would really
help their process as much as

possible," said Associate Dean
and Director of Admission
Colleen Lim M.A. 'BO. "We ap
preciate the process and the
frustration that [students] have
gone through, and that's one of
the reasons that we chose to ex
tend the deadline."
The Common Application, the
online college admission plat
form that is used by more than
500 schools, has had widely docu
mented glitches since a new ver
sion was rolled out last summer.
"This new application system
was intended to be a more robust
system able to effectively guide
applicants and schools through

the complex college application
process and to efficiently handle
the growth of student applica
tions and related forms," wrote
Scott Anderson, senior director
of policy for the Common Appli
cation, in a statement to The Dai
ly. "As with any new technological
launch, some difficulties arose af
ter launch and as more users in

teracted with the system."
Jake Cook, a high school sen
ior from Georgia, said that he
didn't have major issues with his
Stanford application because he
had turned it early, but that he
has had problems working on his
application for other schools.

"Sometimes I would submit
sections of my application and get
no results," Cook said. "The web
site would completely freeze and I
had no way of knowing if my infor
mation went through or not.
"For something as important as
college admittance, this uncertain
ty causes a lot of stress on prospec
tive students," he added.
According to the Washington
Post, more than 40 schools an
nounced extended deadlines, in
cluding Columbia, Dartmouth,
Duke and the University of Chica
go-
Stanford's extension was an
nounced on Oct. 28 on the admis

sion office's website and social me
dia sites.
"The deadline was Nov. 1, which
is Friday, so we were concerned
with the students who were going
to have difficulties and would not
be able to reach us over the week
end," Lim explained. "We extended
it to Monday so that we would actu
ally be here and be able to provide
the best service possible."
Lim said it was hard to assess
the effect the Common Applica
tion's technical challenges had on
Stanford applicants. She said that
the admission received more than
700 emails last weekend, but most
of them were typical admission
questions and a few were related to
technical concerns.
She said that the admission of
fice would post an update the
morning of Nov. 5 addressing stu
dents who still hadn't been able to

submit their application.
"As we messaged on Friday,
we'll be as flexible as possible if a
student truly had technical difficul
ties that precluded them from sub
mitting their application," Lim
said. "So we've asked people to be
in touch with us on our website and
follow those steps."
Stanford's current Regular De
cision application deadline is Jan. 1,
and Lim said it was too soon to
know if that deadline would be af
fected at all.
"[The Common Application] is
working pretty much 24/7 to rectify
the issues and challenges and so we
are seeing progress," Lim said.
"We're trying to recognize all the
issues and trying to be as flexible
as we possibly can."
