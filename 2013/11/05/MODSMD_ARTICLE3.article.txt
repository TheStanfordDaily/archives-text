## Bing creates music series for children 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
The Bing Nursery School has
launched a three-part perform
ance series in collaboration with
the Department of Music to en
courage an appreciation of the arts
among young children.
The series which began in
October with a sold-out show for a
performance of "Peter and the
Wolf" narrated by Helen Bing
was created through a longstand

Nursery School and Jindong Cai,
director of Orchestral Studies and
associate professor of music.

"I think early exposure to the
arts is key in young children's
lives," Wise said. "We want to en
courage audience goers in the fu
ture. Hopefully they'll attend
when they're older, with their chil

However, to Cai, this means
more than simply introducing
them to music.
"My idea at the nursery school
is to find programs that will more
open their minds, open their think

They not only explore music but
also explore different cultures or
different disciplines."
Cai said there were many pos

bring instrumental players, we
