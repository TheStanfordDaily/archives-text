## Bing creates music series for children 
### BRITTANY TORREZ DESK EDITOR 
The Bing Nursery School has
launched a three-part perform
ance series in collaboration with
the Department of Music to en
courage an appreciation of the arts
among young children.
The series which began in
October with a sold-out show for a
performance of "Peter and the
Wolf" narrated by Helen Bing
was created through a longstand
ing partnership between the Bing
Nursery School and Jindong Cai,
director of Orchestral Studies and
associate professor of music.
"It was really sort of a collabo
rative effort between him and us,
and he was always very generous
bringing musicians to the school,"
said Jennifer Winters, director of
the nursery school. She added that
the program has been funded thus
far by donations.
Cai, whose two young children
attended Bing Nursery School,
has worked with the school to offer
a variety of live performances
since 2007, but this year marks the
first formal performance series.
"After the kids left, I continued
to help to do this project," Cai
said. "This time we wanted to put
it into a series so people will have
a program to look for it."
Cai emphasized the important
of exposing children to arts educa
tion at a young age.
"Arts are the most important
part of education for kids to have,"
he said. "We have this responsibil
ity to explore arts for the stu
dents."
Beth Wise, the assistant direc
tor of Bing Nursery School,
shared similar feelings.
"I think early exposure to the
arts is key in young children's
lives," Wise said. "We want to en
courage audience goers in the fu
ture. Hopefully they'll attend
when they're older, with their chil
dren."
However, to Cai, this means
more than simply introducing
them to music.
"My idea at the nursery school
is to find programs that will more
open their minds, open their think
ing," he said. "It's more diverse.
They not only explore music but
also explore different cultures or
different disciplines."
Cai said there were many pos
sibilities available for this per
formance series.
"We can bring dancers, we can
bring instrumental players, we
can bring different ethnic per-
forming art forms from all over
the world," he said. "Whenever we
have those groups come on cam
pus, if we just take some initiative
to connect them with the series,
more people will benefit from it.
Stanford has the advantage to con
nect with that and that's what I'm
here to do."
Next quarter, the children and
their families will be given the op

portunity to see music and dance
from Tibet. In the spring, Oran
Etkin, a jazz/world musician, will
perform for the children.
Cai works to make sure these
performances engage his young
audience.
"Different age groups have dif
ferent needs," he said. "You have
to find the right art form, the right
performance that they will like."
Winters said that Cai's under
standing of the children helps him
select the appropriate performances.
"He's a gifted musician and
conductor, but he also is really
gifted in understanding children

of that age," she said. "He can re
late to young children and that's
really special."
Arid it seems to have paid off.
Wise said that the students are ex
cellent audience members and en
joy the performances they have
been given the chance to attend.
"We really recognized that
they had not only a love of this, but
also a thirst for it," Winters said,
who said she hopes the perform
ance series continues to grow in
the future.
