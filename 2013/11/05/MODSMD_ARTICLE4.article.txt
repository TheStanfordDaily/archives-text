## Startup Weekend pushes the limit 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
In an atmosphere fueled by caffeine and late
night pancakes, participants of this year's Stan
ford Startup Weekend were challenged to push
their limits.
"Your job is to make yourselves a little bit un
comfortable all weekend," said Startup Weekend
coordinator Annette Zinky.
From Nov. 1 to 3, more than 100 students gath
ered in the Stanford Stadium Skybox to partici
pate in the second annual Startup Weekend. Stu

dent entrepreneurs with a wide variety of skill
sets worked for 54 hours in small teams to create
business plans and projects to pitch to a panel of
judges on Sunday night.
Organizers agreed that, compared to last year,
this year's companies were both more viable and
more diverse.
This year's winning team was Dispatcher, a
company whose slogan was "Über for long-haul
trucking," referring to the startup Über that uses
an app to connect riders and drivers. Dispatcher

Planning for the event be
gan three months in advance,
Scheuermann added.
The weekend kicked off
with keynote speaker Keith
Rabois '9l, an entrepreneur
and angel investor at Khosla
Ventures with a colorful his
tory at Stanford. Partici
pants then had the chance to
pitch potential products or
problems to solve, and stu
dents self-assembled into
teams around the ideas that
appealed to them.
By Saturday afternoon,
18 projects were in full swing.
Mentors met with teams in
the morning as they contin
ued to develop their products
and services. Many of the
mentors came from high
powered sponsors spanning a
range of entrepreneurial
fields, like Microsoft in tech
nology and Silicon Valley
Bank in financial services.
Alice Wu, a third-year
Stanford doctoral student in
mechanical engineering, ex
plained how her idea for
BackTrack, a mobile app that
allowed parents to locate
their children through track
ing devices at busy locations
like amusement parks, took
off unexpectedly.
"I came here with not re
ally any expectations and not
even expecting to pitch, but I
pitched my idea yesterday,
and we got a team together,"
Wu said. "Our goal is to put
together a functional proto
type to test at the football
game next weekend."
Late on Saturday night,
another company, Hedwig,
was working on creating a
campus delivery service for
food and other goods using
flying drones.
"If you need food or some
thing on campus, you can call
a quadcopter, a small drone,
and it will fly the food or
whatever you need to your lo

shippers, therefore cutting
out unreliable brokers.
"Everybody worked ex
tremely hard," said A.J. Bal
ance 'O9 MBA 'l5, one of Dis
patcher's 11 team members.
"We had multiple groups do
ing multiple things at one
time all weekend: talking to
customers, hacking out a de
sign and a brand, building
products."
The six judges evaluated
teams based on their busi
ness model, customer valida
tion and execution. Final
pitches were limited to one
minute, and judges then visit
ed teams' tables to learn
more about their companies.
"I have to put my VC hat
on and think of the presenta
tions the same way I would
think of any company that
comes and pitches to us," said
judge John Lee 'B9, a vice
president at Silicon Valley
Bank's Entrepreneur Servic
es Group. "It's all about the
idea, the product, the team
and the market that they're
addressing."
Andrew Scheuermann, a
third-year Stanford doctoral
student in materials sciences
and engineering and a Start
up Weekend organizer,
stressed how forming a com
pany, especially over a week
end, is an ambitious task by
design.
"The chance that you get
all the pieces together in a
single weekend is relatively
low," Scheuermann said. "We
want [Startup Weekend par
ticipants] to have an incredi
ble educational experience
to learn what it's like to walk
through the lean startup

cation," Kotynek said.
Team member and Knight
Fellow Martin Kotynek
spoke about the long hours
that have become the norm
for entrepreneurs in these in
tense environments. Partici
pants were acutely aware of
the role startups played in
their everyday lives with Do
or Dash and Xumma Cola
both Stanford-affiliated com
panies catering the event.
With an emphasis on net
working, Startup Weekend
brought together many stu
dents with different back
grounds and experiences.
Startup Weekend organiz
er and President of Stanford
Women in Business Lauryn
Isford 'l5 explained that the
younger demographic of un
dergraduates brings excite
ment and energy to the
event, while graduate stu
dents often have the experi
ence and fieldwork to move
the startups forward.
Scheuermann explained
that the graduate students
made up the majority of par
ticipants. The entire under
graduate population at the
event was about the same
size as the number of gradu
ate students in each of the
different skillset fields
hardware, software, design,
legal, marketing and busi
ness.
Mario Chris 'l7 spoke
about being on the only all
undergraduate team, consist
ing of five freshmen and one
senior. Although they did not
receive an award this year,
Chris explained that learning
was the most important part
of his experience, not win
ning.
"I learned a lot of new

things, and I think that was
the best part of it all," Chris
said. "[Being] a team of just
undergraduates compared to
all the graduate teams...
made us want to work harder
because it felt really encour
aging to know that we were
working on the level of sever
al graduate teams that were
years ahead of us in experi
ence."
