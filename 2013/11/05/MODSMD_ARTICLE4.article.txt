### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
In an atmosphere fueled by caffeine and late
night pancakes, participants of this year's Stan
ford Startup Weekend were challenged to push
their limits.
"Your job is to make yourselves a little bit un
comfortable all weekend," said Startup Weekend
coordinator Annette Zinky.
From Nov. 1 to 3, more than 100 students gath
ered in the Stanford Stadium Skybox to partici
pate in the second annual Startup Weekend. Stu

dent entrepreneurs with a wide variety of skill
sets worked for 54 hours in small teams to create
business plans and projects to pitch to a panel of
judges on Sunday night.
Organizers agreed that, compared to last year,
this year's companies were both more viable and
more diverse.
This year's winning team was Dispatcher, a
company whose slogan was "Über for long-haul
trucking," referring to the startup Über that uses
an app to connect riders and drivers. Dispatcher
