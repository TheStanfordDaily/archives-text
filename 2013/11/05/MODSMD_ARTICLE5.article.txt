### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Rev. Scotty McLennan, who has been
the dean for religious life at Stanford
since 2000, recently announced his retire
ment from the position (effective summer
2014) to take a sabbatical before he re
turns to Stanford to teach. Aside from be
ing a community minister at the Unitari
an Universalist Church of Palo Alto, he is
also a published author and lawyer. While
serving as dean at Stanford, McLennan
hosted the Dalai Lama both in 2005
and in 2010. The Daily sat down with
McLennan to talk about his experiences
at the Farm.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is one
of your most memorable experiences at
Stanford?
Scotty McLennan (SM): To open the
CIRCLE, which is the Center for Inter-
Religious Learning and Experiences, was
a very memorable day. We had a dedica
tion for it... We had people from all the
different Stanford associated religion
groups there. To get this incredible facili
ty dedicated and up and running was real
ly exciting.
Some of the other most memorable
times have been major events in the world
and in the University. So when we had,
just after 9/11 of 2001, a major gathering
out in the Main Quad of thousands of peo
ple responding to what happened in 9/11
from people with various perspectives
[and] sounds of different traditions. We
had Buddhist bells, a Muslim call to
prayer and a number of other things.
TSD: What will you miss most about this
university and the position you held as
Dean for Religious Life?
SM: Luckily for me, I'm not going to miss
