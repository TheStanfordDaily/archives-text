## REV. SCOTTY MCLENNAN DEAN FOR RELIGIOUS LIFE AT STANFORD 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Rev. Scotty McLennan, who has been
the dean for religious life at Stanford
since 2000, recently announced his retire
ment from the position (effective summer
2014) to take a sabbatical before he re
turns to Stanford to teach. Aside from be
ing a community minister at the Unitari
an Universalist Church of Palo Alto, he is
also a published author and lawyer. While
serving as dean at Stanford, McLennan
hosted the Dalai Lama both in 2005
and in 2010. The Daily sat down with
McLennan to talk about his experiences
at the Farm.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is one
of your most memorable experiences at
Stanford?
Scotty McLennan (SM): To open the
CIRCLE, which is the Center for Inter-
Religious Learning and Experiences, was
a very memorable day. We had a dedica
tion for it... We had people from all the
different Stanford associated religion
groups there. To get this incredible facili
ty dedicated and up and running was real
ly exciting.
Some of the other most memorable
times have been major events in the world
and in the University. So when we had,
just after 9/11 of 2001, a major gathering
out in the Main Quad of thousands of peo
ple responding to what happened in 9/11
from people with various perspectives
[and] sounds of different traditions. We
had Buddhist bells, a Muslim call to
prayer and a number of other things.
TSD: What will you miss most about this
university and the position you held as
Dean for Religious Life?
SM: Luckily for me, I'm not going to miss

the University because I'm
going to continue teaching
here. I'll be back teaching
ethics, primarily business
ethics in the future.
I'll miss the wonderful
and privileged opportunity
to oversee all of the religious
life on campus and help nur
ture and encourage religious
life, to work with the amaz
ing colleagues that I have
here in the Office for Reli
gious Life and all of the peo
ple associated with those 35
religious groups.
This office serves not just
students, but faculty and
staff and alumni and people
from the local community. To
provide a sense of family and
a sense of interconnection
for everyone no matter
where they may be situated
in the University that's
something I'll miss very
much.
TSD: What would you want
your legacy at Stanford to
include and what would you
like to be remembered for?
SM: The most important
thing for me is training our
students for global leader
ship in the 21st century. I
feel that this leadership crit
ically includes inter-reli
gious literacy and relational
agility to get to know people
from different traditions be
cause of the amount of big
otry and discrimination and
violence done in the name of
religion. I really feel like all
of our graduates need to go
out into the world and be
part of the solution, not part
of the problem.
So, all of the programs
that we've started like the
Center for Inter-Religious
Community and Experi
ences, the Rathbun program
for exploring what leads to a
meaningful life and setting
up programs like the Fellow
ship for Religious Encounter
are what I feel is the center
piece of what I've done and
what I would like to be re
membered for.

Creating the Rathbun
Fund, funded by the Founda
tion for Global Community,
has given us the opportunity
to bring speakers like San-

dra Day O'Connor, George
Shultz, Marian Edelman,
the Dalai Lama.
TSD: What are your joys
and sadnesses? How are you
feeling as the time for your
retirement approaches?
SM: I have a lot of joy when
I think about getting to
spend more time with my
two grandchildren and hope
fully more in the future, with
my friends, with a concen
tration on teaching and so
on.
On the other hand, there
is certainly a level of sadness
in leaving a context in which
I've really thrived and loved
the people that I've been
able to work with and the op
portunities to look at the big
picture between religion and
spirituality in people's lives,
and the opportunities to be
with people at these very
poignant times.
I've been pleased with
what I've been able to do,
but I am excited to see
where this may go in the fu
ture because literally at
Stanford, the sky is the lim
it. This is the Silicon Valley,
we had a gold rush, it's Cali
fornia, it's the frontier still in
many ways.
As someone who grew up
in the Midwest and spent
most of my life on the East
Coast, being out here and
seeing the energy and the vi
sion, the sky is the limit here
for the Office for Religious
life in the future. I really
wish my successor all the
best in new envisioning and
new action.

I've been pleased with
what I've been able to do,

we had a gold rush, it's Cali

As someone who grew up

wish my successor all the

REV. SCOTTY
MCLENNAN
Rev. Scotty McLennan, who has been
the dean for religious life at Stanford
since 2000, recently announced his retire
ment from the position (effective summer
2014) to take a sabbatical before he re
turns to Stanford to teach. Aside from be
ing a community minister at the Unitari
an Universalist Church of Palo Alto, he is
also a published author and lawyer. While
serving as dean at Stanford, McLennan
hosted the Dalai Lama both in 2005
and in 2010. The Daily sat down with
McLennan to talk about his experiences
at the Farm.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is one
of your most memorable experiences at
Stanford?
Scotty McLennan (SM): To open the
CIRCLE, which is the Center for Inter-
Religious Learning and Experiences, was
a very memorable day. We had a dedica
tion for it... We had people from all the
different Stanford associated religion
groups there. To get this incredible facili
ty dedicated and up and running was real
ly exciting.
Some of the other most memorable
times have been major events in the world
and in the University. So when we had,
just after 9/11 of 2001, a major gathering
out in the Main Quad of thousands of peo
ple responding to what happened in 9/11
from people with various perspectives
[and] sounds of different traditions. We
had Buddhist bells, a Muslim call to
prayer and a number of other things.
TSD: What will you miss most about this
university and the position you held as
Dean for Religious Life?
SM: Luckily for me, I'm not going to miss

the University because I'm
going to continue teaching
here. I'll be back teaching
ethics, primarily business
ethics in the future.
I'll miss the wonderful
and privileged opportunity
to oversee all of the religious
life on campus and help nur
ture and encourage religious
life, to work with the amaz
ing colleagues that I have
here in the Office for Reli
gious Life and all of the peo
ple associated with those 35
religious groups.
This office serves not just
students, but faculty and
staff and alumni and people
from the local community. To
provide a sense of family and
a sense of interconnection
for everyone no matter
where they may be situated
in the University that's
something I'll miss very
much.
TSD: What would you want
your legacy at Stanford to
include and what would you
like to be remembered for?
SM: The most important
thing for me is training our
students for global leader
ship in the 21st century. I
feel that this leadership crit
ically includes inter-reli
gious literacy and relational
agility to get to know people
from different traditions be
cause of the amount of big
otry and discrimination and
violence done in the name of
religion. I really feel like all
of our graduates need to go
out into the world and be
part of the solution, not part
of the problem.
So, all of the programs
that we've started like the
Center for Inter-Religious
Community and Experi
ences, the Rathbun program
for exploring what leads to a
meaningful life and setting
up programs like the Fellow
ship for Religious Encounter
are what I feel is the center
piece of what I've done and
what I would like to be re
membered for.

Creating the Rathbun
Fund, funded by the Founda
tion for Global Community,
has given us the opportunity
to bring speakers like San-

dra Day O'Connor, George
Shultz, Marian Edelman,
the Dalai Lama.
TSD: What are your joys
and sadnesses? How are you
feeling as the time for your
retirement approaches?
SM: I have a lot of joy when
I think about getting to
spend more time with my
two grandchildren and hope
fully more in the future, with
my friends, with a concen
tration on teaching and so
on.
On the other hand, there
is certainly a level of sadness
in leaving a context in which
I've really thrived and loved
the people that I've been
able to work with and the op
portunities to look at the big
picture between religion and
spirituality in people's lives,
and the opportunities to be
with people at these very
poignant times.
I've been pleased with
what I've been able to do,
but I am excited to see
where this may go in the fu
ture because literally at
Stanford, the sky is the lim
it. This is the Silicon Valley,
we had a gold rush, it's Cali
fornia, it's the frontier still in
