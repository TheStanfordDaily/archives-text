## Flu Crew vaccination clinics expand to Stern 
### JOSIE HODSON DESK EDITOR 
Hundreds of students are stay
ing healthy this season thanks to
the efforts of the Stanford Flu
Crew, which expanded its offering
of flu vaccination clinics in dining
halls this year to include Stern
Dining.
The program is made up of un
dergraduate coordinators and
medical students who administer
free and low-cost flu shots to stu
dents, faculty and staff at Stanford
and others in the local community.
Every fall since the program
began in 2001, the Flu Crew sets
up shop in a number of locations
that are student hubs, including

campus dining halls. Lisa Ly 'l5, an
undergraduate coordinator for the
Flu Crew, stressed the importance
of convenience.
"I guess you could get [your
shot] at Vaden, but their times are
a little more limited," Ly said.
"We're going to the dining halls, so
most of the time [students] are al
ready going there to eat."
Stern Dining was a major addi
tion to the clinic locations this year
with 229 vaccinations administered
there, beating out two other re
turning locations.
Meelim Lee 'l6, another Flu
Crew coordinator, explained that
the locations come down to sched
uling and that the group will con
tinue to expand.

"We definitely try to have a vac
cination clinic at all the undergrad
uate dorms, especially the fresh
man dorms," Lee said. "I guess
this year we were just lucky to be
able to work out a day with [Stern
Dining]."
"In the future we definitely
want to vaccinate at all the dining

halls, so Stern is definitely one that
we'll try to include in the upcoming
years," she added.
Part of the Flu Crew's mission
is to help vaccinate communities
outside of Stanford as well. To that
end, they often hold events at
