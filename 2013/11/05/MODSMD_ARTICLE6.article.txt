## Flu Crew vaccination clinics expand to Stern 
### JOSIE HODSON DESK EDITOR 
Hundreds of students are stay
ing healthy this season thanks to
the efforts of the Stanford Flu
Crew, which expanded its offering
of flu vaccination clinics in dining
halls this year to include Stern
Dining.
The program is made up of un
dergraduate coordinators and
medical students who administer
free and low-cost flu shots to stu
dents, faculty and staff at Stanford
and others in the local community.
Every fall since the program
began in 2001, the Flu Crew sets
up shop in a number of locations
that are student hubs, including

campus dining halls. Lisa Ly 'l5, an
undergraduate coordinator for the
Flu Crew, stressed the importance
of convenience.
"I guess you could get [your
shot] at Vaden, but their times are
a little more limited," Ly said.
"We're going to the dining halls, so
most of the time [students] are al
ready going there to eat."
Stern Dining was a major addi
tion to the clinic locations this year
with 229 vaccinations administered
there, beating out two other re
turning locations.
Meelim Lee 'l6, another Flu
Crew coordinator, explained that
the locations come down to sched
uling and that the group will con
tinue to expand.

"We definitely try to have a vac
cination clinic at all the undergrad
uate dorms, especially the fresh
man dorms," Lee said. "I guess
this year we were just lucky to be
able to work out a day with [Stern
Dining]."
"In the future we definitely
want to vaccinate at all the dining

halls, so Stern is definitely one that
we'll try to include in the upcoming
years," she added.
Part of the Flu Crew's mission
is to help vaccinate communities
outside of Stanford as well. To that
end, they often hold events at

churches, homeless shelters
and other venues, such as the
Monterey Mushroom Farm.
According to Yu-Jin Lee 'll
M.D. 'l7, a medical student
director of the Flu Crew, the
program's vaccination efforts
now reach as many people
outside of the Stanford com
munity as Stanford affiliates.
Surya Nagaraja M.D.
Ph.D. 'l7, another medical
student director of the Flu
Crew, reported positive re
sponses to this volunteer
work in the local community.
"We had an event last
week where we went to a
church in Santa Clara Coun
ty to vaccinate families and
children," Nagaraja said.
"There were four masses
throughout the day. We took
500 vaccines and we used
them all up in the first two
masses."
Events at locations like
the City Team homeless shel
ter in San Jose have the po
tential to save lives, accord
ing to Nagaraja.
"You can have impact on
an entire community," Na
garaja said. "By doing this
you can significantly reduce
the occurrence of flu in these
communities that are in high
contact with each other.
You're reducing the mortali
ty rate and serious illness in
children and elderly people."
Flu Crew volunteers take

a number of precautions be
fore administering the shot
to anyone. This is especially
important in the events off
campus, where residents
might not have experience
with vaccination.
"Because a lot of the local
community members we go
to [are] in the underserved
community, a lot of them are
wary of vaccinations and flu
shots in general," Yu-Jin Lee
said. "So we do a lot of educa

tion of what it means to get
the vaccine, how it works and
why they should get it."
The group wants to con
tinue expanding the educa
tional aspect of the program
in future years.
"Our ideal goal would be
to educate people one on one
when we vaccinate them,"
Nagaraja said. "It's quite a
process to be able to dissem
inate information like that, so
we haven't been able to do it

this year. Hopefully we can
get to it next year."
The program has a goal of
administering 6,000 vaccina
tions this year, which is 2,000
more than were given last
year. They have not yet tal
lied the total number of vac
cinations administered be
cause vaccination events are
still occurring.
