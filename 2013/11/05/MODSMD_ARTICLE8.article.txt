## FOOTBALL PRESS CONFERENCE ANDERSON TO RETURN 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
With the announcement last week
that fifth-year senior defensive end Ben
Gardner would be out for the remainder
of the season with a shoulder injury,
Stanford's already depleted defensive
line appeared to be in dire straits as it
began to prepare for the high-octane
Oregon offense; however, head coach
David Shaw announced during his press
conference Monday morning that his de
fense will receive a much needed boost
when it takes on the Ducks with the re
turn of senior defensive end Henry An
derson.
"It looks like Henry's going to play,"
Shaw said. "I'm not sure whether or not
he's going to start, but he and [senior de
fensive end] Blake [Lueders] will play a
significant amount assuming there're no
setbacks."
Shaw added that Anderson has
looked very strong in practice and is cur
rently squatting the same weight that he
did prior to injuring his leg during the
Cardinal's second game of the season
against Army. While Shaw expects An
derson to contribute on Thursday, he
does not expect the 6-foot-6, 290-pound
senior to be able to play more than 60
snaps against the Ducks. Consequently,
Lueders is expected to continue taking
on a significant role on the defensive line.
Listed as an outside linebacker,
Lueders has taken several snaps at de
fensive end in the past few games as the

Cardinal was forced to MacGyver its
way out of a lack of depth on the defen
sive line. Ultimately, Shaw said that he
would ideally like to have a six-person
rotation on the defensive line to stay
fresh enough to keep up with the Oregon
offense. In addition to Lueders, Shaw
said that sophomore defensive ends
Luke Kaumatule and Aziz Shittu might
receive significant playing time while the
Card will lean heavily on starters Josh
Mauro and David Parry to play the ma
jority of the snaps.
"Guys like Josh Mauro and David
Parry have to give us everything they
got," Shaw said. "We'll give them rest,
but they need to get right back up and
get in there."
In other injury news, Shaw an
nounced that junior wide receiver Devon
Cajuste, who injured his knee against
UCLA, is questionable to play on Thurs
day. Cajuste looked strong in his limited
practice time on Sunday, and will contin
ue to take on more as the week progress
es.
Williamson has also been limited in
practice, kicking on Sunday but held out
on Monday as he continues to recover
from a leg injury of his own. Shaw said
he hopes to have Williamson available
for at least field goals in the event that he
is not ready to handle kickoffs.
While Monday's press conference
provided positive news on the injury
front, the overall mood remained calm as
Shaw took several minutes to praise the
Ducks effusively, particularly quarter

back Marcus Mariota and defensive co
ordinator Nick Aliotti.
Regarding Mariota, Shaw commend
ed the quarterback's composure and the
fact that he has yet to throw an intercep
tion this season.
"The ball hardly ever goes into cov
erage. You can't go through seven on
seven and not throw an interception.
He's gone through [eight] games... and
not thrown an interception," Shaw not
ed. "He has such a calm about him even
when he's getting pressured.... He has
such a great composure about him. He's
just a more mature version of the really
good quarterback from last year."
Shaw also added that it is impossible
to replicate Oregon's dynamic quarter
back in practice, quipping that, "If you
had a guy like him on the scout team, he
would be starting."
Moreover, Shaw called Aliotti the
most underrated component of Oregon's
success in recent years.
"Nobody ever talks about Nick Aliot
ti," Shaw said. "They talk about the of
fense and the points, but they can't do
what they do if the defense doesn't play
the way they d 0.... While [former Ore
gon head coach] Chip [Kelly] was the
biggest change in Oregon football, I
think the second biggest has been Nick's
adjustment to playing defense with this
type of offense."
However, Shaw's most notable point
of praise for Oregon came when he stat-

ed that he believed that the
spread listing his team as 10
point underdogs was, in fact,
too generous to the Card.
"I thought [the point
spread] was going to be high
er," Shaw said. "They've

played as well as anyone in
the nation, and we haven't."
While Shaw did not shy
away from heaping praise on
the Ducks, senior safety Ed
Reynolds said that the Car
dinal players are still bring
ing a lot of confidence into
their monumental show
down on Thursday. In partic
ular, Reynolds echoed defen
sive coordinator Derek Ma
son's message on the impor

tance of taking the Ducks in
to "deep water."
"You're not going to be
able to beat this team if you
don't take them into the
fourth quarter." Reynolds
said. "For us as a defense it's
about giving the offense as
many possessions as we
can."

fourth quarter." Reynolds

With the announcement last week
that fifth-year senior defensive end Ben
Gardner would be out for the remainder
of the season with a shoulder injury,
Stanford's already depleted defensive
line appeared to be in dire straits as it
began to prepare for the high-octane
Oregon offense; however, head coach
David Shaw announced during his press
conference Monday morning that his de
fense will receive a much needed boost
when it takes on the Ducks with the re
turn of senior defensive end Henry An
derson.
"It looks like Henry's going to play,"
Shaw said. "I'm not sure whether or not
he's going to start, but he and [senior de
fensive end] Blake [Lueders] will play a
significant amount assuming there're no
setbacks."
Shaw added that Anderson has
looked very strong in practice and is cur
rently squatting the same weight that he
did prior to injuring his leg during the
Cardinal's second game of the season
against Army. While Shaw expects An
derson to contribute on Thursday, he
does not expect the 6-foot-6, 290-pound
senior to be able to play more than 60
snaps against the Ducks. Consequently,
Lueders is expected to continue taking
on a significant role on the defensive line.
Listed as an outside linebacker,
Lueders has taken several snaps at de
fensive end in the past few games as the

Cardinal was forced to MacGyver its
way out of a lack of depth on the defen
sive line. Ultimately, Shaw said that he
would ideally like to have a six-person
rotation on the defensive line to stay
fresh enough to keep up with the Oregon
offense. In addition to Lueders, Shaw
said that sophomore defensive ends
Luke Kaumatule and Aziz Shittu might
receive significant playing time while the
Card will lean heavily on starters Josh
Mauro and David Parry to play the ma
jority of the snaps.
"Guys like Josh Mauro and David
Parry have to give us everything they
got," Shaw said. "We'll give them rest,
but they need to get right back up and
get in there."
In other injury news, Shaw an
nounced that junior wide receiver Devon
Cajuste, who injured his knee against
UCLA, is questionable to play on Thurs
day. Cajuste looked strong in his limited
practice time on Sunday, and will contin
ue to take on more as the week progress
es.
Williamson has also been limited in
practice, kicking on Sunday but held out
on Monday as he continues to recover
from a leg injury of his own. Shaw said
he hopes to have Williamson available
for at least field goals in the event that he
is not ready to handle kickoffs.
While Monday's press conference
provided positive news on the injury
front, the overall mood remained calm as
Shaw took several minutes to praise the
Ducks effusively, particularly quarter

back Marcus Mariota and defensive co
ordinator Nick Aliotti.
Regarding Mariota, Shaw commend
ed the quarterback's composure and the
fact that he has yet to throw an intercep
tion this season.
"The ball hardly ever goes into cov
erage. You can't go through seven on
seven and not throw an interception.
He's gone through [eight] games... and
not thrown an interception," Shaw not
ed. "He has such a calm about him even
when he's getting pressured.... He has
such a great composure about him. He's
just a more mature version of the really
good quarterback from last year."
Shaw also added that it is impossible
to replicate Oregon's dynamic quarter
back in practice, quipping that, "If you
had a guy like him on the scout team, he
would be starting."
Moreover, Shaw called Aliotti the
most underrated component of Oregon's
success in recent years.
"Nobody ever talks about Nick Aliot
ti," Shaw said. "They talk about the of
fense and the points, but they can't do
what they do if the defense doesn't play
the way they d 0.... While [former Ore
gon head coach] Chip [Kelly] was the
biggest change in Oregon football, I
think the second biggest has been Nick's
adjustment to playing defense with this
type of offense."
However, Shaw's most notable point
of praise for Oregon came when he stat-

ed that he believed that the
spread listing his team as 10
point underdogs was, in fact,
too generous to the Card.
"I thought [the point

played as well as anyone in
