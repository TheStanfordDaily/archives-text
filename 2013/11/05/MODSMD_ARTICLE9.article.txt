# STANFORD IN THE NFL
## ZACH ERTZ TALKS NFL, OREGON 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Few people outside of the Stanford locker
room thought that the Cardinal would be victo
rious when the team traveled to Autzen Stadi
um last year to face off against the undefeated
Oregon Ducks. The doubt still remained with
the Cardinal in possession of the ball at its own
22-yard line with just six minutes remaining in
the fourth quarter and trailing by a touchdown.
That all changed on one spectacular drive,
capped off by a touchdown catch that every Car
dinal fan around the nation remembers fondly.
Tight end Zach Ertz 'l3, who caught 11 pass
es for 106 yards in that game, ran a fade and
out-jumped Ducks cornerback Ifo Ekpre-Olo
mu to snatch the ball out of the air before
falling with his shoulder just in bounds at the
back of the end zone to record the game-tying
touchdown catch. Ertz caught four passes for
53 yards on that drive alone, leading Stanford
to a touchdown and ultimately to a victory. This
time around, Stanford will have to take on the
Ducks without last year's leading receiver,
Ertz, who was drafted in the second round by
the Philadelphia Eagles.
"The most rewarding part is seeing all your
dreams come true," said Ertz about his experi
ence in the NFL thus far. "Obviously, I've put in
a lot of hard work to get to where I am today
and fortunately I've had the opportunity to play
eight games this year. But at the end of the day,
am I really satisfied at just being in the NFL?
I want to succeed in the NFL as well."
Despite joining a team with two established
tight ends on its roster already Brent Celek
and James Casey Ertz has made a big im
pact and currently leads the Eagles' tight ends
in receiving this season with 243 yards in Chip
Kelly's high-powered offense. Kelly, Oregon's
coach last year, left the Ducks to become the

coach of the Eagles in the offseason.
"It's been great. Coach Kelly and I have a
lot of respect for each other obviously," Ertz
said. "In college, we had a lot of games against
Oregon which we had to battle through and
now that we're on the same team it's been a lot
of fun."
Of course, the most recent battle between
the two occurred last year when Ertz hauled in
the game-tying touchdown reception to force

overtime in a game that the Cardinal eventual
ly won. Chip Kelly has his own opinions about
Ertz's catch, which was initially called incom
plete before being overturned by the referees.
"He still doesn't think it's a catch, but I keep
reminding him that it was a catch," Ertz said
jokingly. "It's not really up for debate. I mean
the refs overturned the call on the field so at

the end of the day, it was a
catch."
Stanford will certainly
miss Ertz in the upcoming
contest against Oregon.
However, Ertz doesn't think
that there are very many
differences between last
year's squad that beat Ore
gon and this year's team.
"[They're] pretty similar
to be honest," said Ertz when
asked to compare the two
Stanford squads. "The de
fense was one of the best in
the country and is playing at
an even higher level this year
than they did last year. They
have a go-to receiver in Ty
while last year it was more of
the tight ends, this year it's
more of the receivers."
Even though Ertz can't
compete in this year's con
test, he still has faith that the
Cardinal will emerge victori
ous when the two teams
meet this upcoming Thurs
day. Ertz predicts a 28-24
Stanford victory.
Ertz caught five passes
for 42 yards and recorded his
first career touchdown in the
NFL as the Eagles beat the
Raiders 49-20 on Sunday in
Oakland, just a 30 minute
drive from Ertz's hometown
of Danville, Calif.

Miami Dolphins tackle
Jonathan Martin 'l2 left the
team early last week after al

legedly experiencing bully
ing and harassment from
other members of the Dol
phins offensive line for some
time before an incident in the
lunch room on Monday, Oct.
28, sparked his departure.
Fox Sports reported that
Martin had been subjected
to consistent bullying within
the locker room from team
mates and is now receiving
professional treatment for
emotional issues.
The Miami Dolphins and
its players spoke up in sup
port of Martin's decision this
past week. The Dolphins re
quested the NFEs help in
looking into these issues. On
Sunday, the Dolphins sus
pended starting guard
Richie Incognito indefinitely
for conduct detrimental to
the team, speculated to be
related to his treatment of
Martin.
In other news, Andrew
Luck 'l2 led yet another
Colts' comeback victory as
the Colts rallied from a 24-6
deficit on the road to win 27-
24 against the Texans. Luck
completed 18 of his 40 passes
for 271 yards and three
touchdowns in guiding the
Colts to another impressive
victory and improving their
record to 6-2.
In addition, Doug Bald
win 'll had six catches for 75
yards and a touchdown in the
Seattle Seahawks' 27-24
overtime victory over the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Few people outside of the Stanford locker
room thought that the Cardinal would be victo
rious when the team traveled to Autzen Stadi
um last year to face off against the undefeated
Oregon Ducks. The doubt still remained with
the Cardinal in possession of the ball at its own
22-yard line with just six minutes remaining in
the fourth quarter and trailing by a touchdown.
That all changed on one spectacular drive,
capped off by a touchdown catch that every Car
dinal fan around the nation remembers fondly.
Tight end Zach Ertz 'l3, who caught 11 pass
es for 106 yards in that game, ran a fade and
out-jumped Ducks cornerback Ifo Ekpre-Olo
mu to snatch the ball out of the air before
falling with his shoulder just in bounds at the
back of the end zone to record the game-tying
touchdown catch. Ertz caught four passes for
53 yards on that drive alone, leading Stanford
to a touchdown and ultimately to a victory. This
time around, Stanford will have to take on the
Ducks without last year's leading receiver,
Ertz, who was drafted in the second round by
the Philadelphia Eagles.
"The most rewarding part is seeing all your
dreams come true," said Ertz about his experi
ence in the NFL thus far. "Obviously, I've put in
a lot of hard work to get to where I am today
and fortunately I've had the opportunity to play
eight games this year. But at the end of the day,
am I really satisfied at just being in the NFL?
I want to succeed in the NFL as well."
Despite joining a team with two established
tight ends on its roster already Brent Celek
and James Casey Ertz has made a big im
pact and currently leads the Eagles' tight ends
in receiving this season with 243 yards in Chip
Kelly's high-powered offense. Kelly, Oregon's
coach last year, left the Ducks to become the

coach of the Eagles in the offseason.
"It's been great. Coach Kelly and I have a
lot of respect for each other obviously," Ertz
said. "In college, we had a lot of games against
Oregon which we had to battle through and
now that we're on the same team it's been a lot
of fun."
Of course, the most recent battle between
the two occurred last year when Ertz hauled in
the game-tying touchdown reception to force

overtime in a game that the Cardinal eventual
ly won. Chip Kelly has his own opinions about
Ertz's catch, which was initially called incom
plete before being overturned by the referees.
"He still doesn't think it's a catch, but I keep
reminding him that it was a catch," Ertz said
jokingly. "It's not really up for debate. I mean
the refs overturned the call on the field so at

the end of the day, it was a
catch."
Stanford will certainly
miss Ertz in the upcoming
contest against Oregon.
However, Ertz doesn't think
that there are very many
differences between last
year's squad that beat Ore
gon and this year's team.
"[They're] pretty similar
to be honest," said Ertz when
asked to compare the two
Stanford squads. "The de
fense was one of the best in
the country and is playing at
an even higher level this year
than they did last year. They
have a go-to receiver in Ty
while last year it was more of
the tight ends, this year it's
