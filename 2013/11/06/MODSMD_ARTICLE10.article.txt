## EXAMINING OREGON'S STRENGTHS 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Most of Oregon's opponents are con
cerned primarily with stopping the
Ducks' quick-strike offensive attack,
which ranks second in the nation in
points (55.6) and yards (632.1) per
game. But Oregon also fields one of
the nation's best defenses, including
an elite secondary that could give
junior quarterback Kevin Hogan,
who has looked, shaky at times this
season, a. lot of trouble. We asked foot
ball writers Winston Shi, Do-Hyoung
Park and David Cohn: Which element,
of the Ducks' game is most likely to
doom the Cardinal on Thursday ?

Winston: I think the question says it all
Stanford's offense is going to have to do its
part to win the game on Saturday.
Quite frankly, Stanford should never be
expected to totally shut down the Oregon
offense. But with 80-90 yards of field be
tween the Ducks and the end zone at the
start of each and every drive, Stanford can
definitely slow Oregon down. Considering
nothing else, holding the Ducks to 20 points
(28 at the absolute most) should be enough
for Stanford to have a chance to win. Last
game, UCLA held Oregon to 14 points
through three quarters.
That begs the question: Can Stanford's
suddenly sputtering offense score 20 points

of its own? Outside of garbage time, the
Ducks have only given up more than 20
points in one game Washington. Of
course, Stanford head coach David Shaw
said after 2012 Oregon that the Cardinal
should have beaten Oregon by more, and I
agree. Reviewing that game, Oregon gave
Stanford a lot of chances that the Cardinal
did not convert. Receivers got open and the
Oregon run defense wasn't brilliant, yet
Stanford nearly killed itself with turnovers.
Last year, Stanford actually had more
yards than Oregon, and excluding Oregon
quarterback Marcus Mariota's big scram
ble, yardage wasn't even a contest.
The sky is not falling on Stanford's of
fense, and X's and O's wise, it looks like
Stanford is getting ready to throw the
kitchen sink at Oregon. But among three
solid units, the Stanford offense has pro
duced by far the most evidence that it will
be the one to fail. I hope it proves me
wrong.
Do: I'd just like to say that "doom" is a very


AVI BAGLA/The Stanford Daily
Junior wideout Ty Montgomery (7) and
Stanford's young but talented receiving
corps will need to beat a tough Oregon
secondary if Kevin Hogan and the Card
want to match the Ducks' scoring output.
