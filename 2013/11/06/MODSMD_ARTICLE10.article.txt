# TAKE THREE
## EXAMINING OREGON'S STRENGTHS 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Most of Oregon's opponents are con
cerned primarily with stopping the
Ducks' quick-strike offensive attack,
which ranks second in the nation in
points (55.6) and yards (632.1) per
game. But Oregon also fields one of
the nation's best defenses, including
an elite secondary that could give
junior quarterback Kevin Hogan,
who has looked, shaky at times this
season, a. lot of trouble. We asked foot
ball writers Winston Shi, Do-Hyoung
Park and David Cohn: Which element,
of the Ducks' game is most likely to
doom the Cardinal on Thursday ?

Winston: I think the question says it all
Stanford's offense is going to have to do its
part to win the game on Saturday.
Quite frankly, Stanford should never be
expected to totally shut down the Oregon
offense. But with 80-90 yards of field be
tween the Ducks and the end zone at the
start of each and every drive, Stanford can
definitely slow Oregon down. Considering
nothing else, holding the Ducks to 20 points
(28 at the absolute most) should be enough
for Stanford to have a chance to win. Last
game, UCLA held Oregon to 14 points
through three quarters.
That begs the question: Can Stanford's
suddenly sputtering offense score 20 points

of its own? Outside of garbage time, the
Ducks have only given up more than 20
points in one game Washington. Of
course, Stanford head coach David Shaw
said after 2012 Oregon that the Cardinal
should have beaten Oregon by more, and I
agree. Reviewing that game, Oregon gave
Stanford a lot of chances that the Cardinal
did not convert. Receivers got open and the
Oregon run defense wasn't brilliant, yet
Stanford nearly killed itself with turnovers.
Last year, Stanford actually had more
yards than Oregon, and excluding Oregon
quarterback Marcus Mariota's big scram
ble, yardage wasn't even a contest.
The sky is not falling on Stanford's of
fense, and X's and O's wise, it looks like
Stanford is getting ready to throw the
kitchen sink at Oregon. But among three
solid units, the Stanford offense has pro
duced by far the most evidence that it will
be the one to fail. I hope it proves me
wrong.
Do: I'd just like to say that "doom" is a very

strong word. If the Ducks
are going to beat the Cardi
nal on Thursday, it will cer
tainly not be because of a
specific element of their
game. It will take a solid all
around element from the en
tire Ducks team, from Mari
ota to the defense to maybe
even oft-beleaguered kicker
Alejandro Maldonado (we
love you, Alejandro!) to sink
Stanford's ship.
That being said, I'm go
ing to build off the prompt
and say that the Ducks' sec
ondary led by the always
threatening cornerback Ifo
Ekpre-Olomu —is going to
be a significant factor in
how this game goes. Stan
ford's passing attack, espe
cially given its recent strug
gles, is definitely not the
best that Oregon's second
ary will have faced this year.
Looking at the numbers,
however, it seems at first
glance that Oregon's pass
defense has been above av
erage but not excellent, hav
ing allowed 228 yards per
game through the air.
However, looking closer,
Oregon's pass defense
seems dominant. For one,
teams love to pass against
the Oregon defense. Oppo
nents have attempted 344
passes against the Ducks
good for third in the nation
behind just Missouri and

Stanford. The big difference
is that the Ducks' secondary
has only allowed 56 percent
of passes to be completed
and is second in the nation to
Michigan State by allowing
just 5.31 yards per attempt.
It has also intercepted 13
passes, contributing to an
eye-popping plus-12
turnover differential.
This pass defense is bat
tle-tested and ready for
much bigger challenges than
a recently mediocre Stan
ford passing offense, whose
success is contingent on the
effectiveness of the Cardi
nal's rush offense as well. If
Hogan can't crack the sec
ondary, Oregon will be able
to stack the box against
Gaffney, and the Cardinal
will be in for a rough night.
David: I agree with Do on
this one. I am certainly not
prepared to say the Cardinal
is going to be doomed by an
aspect of the Ducks.
However, I will say that
Mariota's short and interme
diate level passing game is
most likely to present prob
lems for the Cardinal. Mari
ota is having another stand
out season as the Ducks
starting quarterback and is,
by most estimates, the fa
vorite to win the Heisman

Trophy simply because his
game really has no signifi
cant flaws. Mariota is fabu
lous at moving through his
progressions in an efficient
and timely manner, while his
accuracy and incredible
speed when running the
football make him an ab
solute nightmare to contain
for most defenses.
Stanford, unlike most of
Mariota's opponents, has an
extremely talented defense
that is more than capable of
preventing Mariota —or
just about any quarterback
in the country, for that mat
ter— from lighting up the
scoreboard with big plays.
However, the Cardinal has
struggled this year defend
ing the short-passing game
and bubble screens of its op
ponents, a flaw that Mariota
and Oregon will look to ex
ploit.
In Oregon's most recent
game against UCLA, Mario
ta completed just one pass
for more than 25 yards; in
stead, he dissected the Bruin
defense with nine comple
tions between 10 and 20
yards and seven additional
passes going for seven to 10
yards. Coupling that success
with the frenetic pace of the
Quack Attack was enough to
wear down the Bruin de
fense by the fourth quarter.
If the Cardinal defense is
unable to fight through
blocks on the bubble screens
or get off the field early in
the contest, Stanford will
suffer a similar fate to
UCLA as well as the 2011
Cardinal counterpart.
