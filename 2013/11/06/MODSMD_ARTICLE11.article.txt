## Card hosts Cal in finale 
### FIONA NOONAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In what is sure to be a heated finale to an
up-and-down regular season, No. 10 Stan
ford (13-4-1, 6-4-0 Pac-12) will face un
ranked rival Cal (10-4-5, 3-4-3 Pac-12) at
home tonight.
The game will be Senior Night for the
Cardinal in honor of the seven women in
their senior seasons on the team. It will al
so be a critical match in determining the
Cardinal's confidence and placement going
into the postseason.
Coming off of Sunday's 1-0 loss to Wash
ington State, which ended Stanford's quest
for a fifth consecutive Pac-12 Championship
and dropped its ranking from No. 7 to No.
10, the Cardinal is looking to finish the sea
son strong with a victory.
"It's a little bit different of a situation
than we're used to because we have a cou

pie of losses under our belt, but I think it's
good to get all that stuff out kind of before
playoffs," said senior defender Natalie Grif
fen. Griffen, who was just named as a Pac
-12 All-Academic selection, will be one of the
seniors honored tonight.
While the Cardinal has experienced an
uncharacteristically disappointing season,
the Bears have also had a rough patch over
their last seven games. Cal was winless in
its last six matches before finally getting a
win against Washington this past Sunday.
Stanford should be able to capitalize on this
if the team comes out strong and scores
early, as Cal is winless in two contests this
season when scored on in the first half.
Of course, the focus of the match will be
not only to win, but also to send the team's
seniors off on a high note after their final
regular season game. Goalkeepers Aly
