## Card hosts Cal in finale 
### FIONA NOONAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In what is sure to be a heated finale to an
up-and-down regular season, No. 10 Stan
ford (13-4-1, 6-4-0 Pac-12) will face un
ranked rival Cal (10-4-5, 3-4-3 Pac-12) at
home tonight.
The game will be Senior Night for the
Cardinal in honor of the seven women in
their senior seasons on the team. It will al
so be a critical match in determining the
Cardinal's confidence and placement going
into the postseason.
Coming off of Sunday's 1-0 loss to Wash
ington State, which ended Stanford's quest
for a fifth consecutive Pac-12 Championship
and dropped its ranking from No. 7 to No.
10, the Cardinal is looking to finish the sea
son strong with a victory.
"It's a little bit different of a situation
than we're used to because we have a cou

pie of losses under our belt, but I think it's
good to get all that stuff out kind of before
playoffs," said senior defender Natalie Grif
fen. Griffen, who was just named as a Pac
-12 All-Academic selection, will be one of the
seniors honored tonight.
While the Cardinal has experienced an
uncharacteristically disappointing season,
the Bears have also had a rough patch over
their last seven games. Cal was winless in
its last six matches before finally getting a
win against Washington this past Sunday.
Stanford should be able to capitalize on this
if the team comes out strong and scores
early, as Cal is winless in two contests this
season when scored on in the first half.
Of course, the focus of the match will be
not only to win, but also to send the team's
seniors off on a high note after their final
regular season game. Goalkeepers Aly
Gleason and Emily Oliver,
defender Natalie Griffen,
midfielder Taylor McCann
and forwards Shelby Payne,
Sydney Payne and Courtney
Verloo will all be honored
during a pregame ceremony.
For the seniors, the mood
is both reflective and happy.
"I feel like I've grown so
much as a person over the
last four years at Stanford

and this team has been my
life for the last four years,"
said Sydney Paine. "It's sad
that it's over, but I'm so
thankful for the opportunity,
and I'm so excited to play to
morrow night and beat the
Bears on Senior Night."
Although this will be the
first time any of the senior
women will have finished a
season at Stanford without
being named conference
champions, the team has its
sights set on a larger goal
right now.
"It's nice to have, you
know, the little trophy or the

certificate or whatever,"
Griffen said, "but at the end
of the year it's pretty trivial
and all that really matters is:
'Do you have the [national
championship] ring?' Before,
we've had the Pac-12 trophy,
but we still [didn't] have the
ring, and so I don't think [not
winning the conference]
makes any difference."
After finishing the regu
lar season tonight, the team
will begin preparing for the
playoffs, as the postseason
tournament selection takes
place on Nov. 11. Stanford
should host a first round

match if the selection goes as
expected, and hopes are high
for the next chapter of the
season.
"I think that the best is in
front of the team this sea
son," said Sydney Payne. "I
think that we're getting bet
ter every game, and that's
what's important at this
point."
The Cardinal kicks off its
Senior Night match against
the Cal Golden Bears at 7:30
p.m. at Cagan Stadium.
