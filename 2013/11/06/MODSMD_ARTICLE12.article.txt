## SEEING GREEN For Everything, A Season 
### Holly Moeller 
Daniel Boisclair, calm, alert,
and with a subtle French ac
cent, took the floor promptly
at 9 a.m. to open the second day of
talks at the Aquatic Reserve Net
works meeting.
Like most of us at the workshop,
his research at the intersection of
mathematics and biology had to do
with fish. As he put it, the biological
questions are simple: "How many
fish are there? Where are they?
What are they doing?"
But when it comes to under
standing the policy implications,
things quickly get more complicated.
Professor Boisclair, in particu
lar, wants to know what happens to
river-dwelling fish that share their
foraging and breeding habitat with
other human uses, like hydroelec
tric power.
Canada, his home country, cur
rently gets 60 percent of its elec
tricity from 500 hydropower facili
ties installed across its broad
Northern expanse. This renewable
energy source is a terrific boon for
people concerned with greenhouse
gas emissions, as well as those who
want to avoid further exploitation
of limited and dirty fossil fuel sup
plies.
But each new set of dams and
turbines adds an additional obstacle
for migratory fish stocks, many of
whose numbers are already deplet
ed by fishing and other forms of
habitat loss, like pollution, or diver
sion for irrigation and other water
use.
One way to compensate for the
competing interests between fish
eries and conservation, and energy
and water, is to use temporally vari
able management. For example,
power plants can shut down some of
their turbines during spawning runs
to allow safe passage of adult fish.
Seasonal management strate
gies aren't new to fishery manage
ment, though they typically focus
on the time of the year when reere-

ational and commercial fishermen
can legally harvest a species. (For
example, the California recreation
al Dungeness crabbing season just
opened this weekend.)
Limiting the fishing season of a
particular species helps to conserve
it in several ways. First, it cuts
down on the amount of fishing ef
fort that the species is exposed to,
meaning that an individual fish has
a reduced chance of being hooked
and eaten.
Second, seasons are typically
timed to protect a species at its
most vulnerable time of the year.
For example, ideally you'd want to
hold off on harvesting fish until af
ter they'd completed that year's
spawning cycle, to maximize the
number of new offspring that would
make it into the next year's breed
ing pool.
Perhaps most importantly, set
ting fishing seasons helps regula
tors walk a fine and enforceable line
between the needs of the fish stocks
they try to manage sustainably, and
the economic and social politics of
the communities that have harvest
ed these fish for years, if not gener
ations. Fishing seasons allow some
harvest to occur sustaining at
least a portion of the economic base
of the industry, but theoretically
prevent the overfishing - and even
tual collapse - of the species.
Of course, restricting someone's
access to his or her livelihood or fa
vorite weekend activity is hardly
going to make you good friends.
While hunters and fishermen are
often among the most vocal advo
cates for regulations (Of course
they don't want to see the game
they love driven to the brink of ex

tinction!), sometimes the strict
management required can be a
tough pill to swallow.
The social side of the dynamic
becomes much more complicated
once multiple regulatory agencies
become involved. For example,
many fish stocks span international
boundaries, which means that sev
eral governments must agree on a
common policy goal and, more im
portantly, its implementation.
The difficulty of achieving such
international accord was highlight
ed last week, when the United
States and New Zealand tried to
establish a half-million square mile
marine reserve off the coast of
Antarctica. The reserve would have
been the largest in the world, creat
ing a safe haven for many marine
species that call the Southern
Ocean home, including several
species of whales and penguins, the
charismatic heroes of many a chil
dren's story.
But the reserve would be closed
to fishing. So China, Russia, and
the Ukraine balked at its establish
ment, and the conservation effort
fell short.
The Antarctic negotiation rep

resents a single example in an on
going series that will only become
more complicated as our demands
on the planet's natural resources
increase and diversify.
Even as we get better at moni
toring and stabilizing our fishery
stocks, we'll subject them to addi
tional pressures from offshore
drilling, cross-river hydroelectric

plants, and habitats shifted by
ocean acidification and sea level
rise.
And there will hardly be enough
time in a year to manage it all.

sinker? Holly welcomes reader

Perhaps most importantly, set
ting fishing seasons helps regula
tors walk a fine and enforceable line
between the needs of the fish stocks
they try to manage sustainably, and
the economic and social politics of
the communities that have harvest
ed these fish for years, if not gener
ations. Fishing seasons allow some
harvest to occur sustaining at
least a portion of the economic base
of the industry, but theoretically
prevent the overfishing - and even
tual collapse - of the species.
Of course, restricting someone's
access to his or her livelihood or fa
vorite weekend activity is hardly
going to make you good friends.
While hunters and fishermen are
often among the most vocal advo
cates for regulations (Of course
they don't want to see the game
they love driven to the brink of ex

tinction!), sometimes the strict
management required can be a
tough pill to swallow.
The social side of the dynamic
becomes much more complicated
once multiple regulatory agencies
become involved. For example,
many fish stocks span international
boundaries, which means that sev
eral governments must agree on a
common policy goal and, more im
portantly, its implementation.
The difficulty of achieving such
international accord was highlight
ed last week, when the United
States and New Zealand tried to
establish a half-million square mile
marine reserve off the coast of
Antarctica. The reserve would have
been the largest in the world, creat
ing a safe haven for many marine
species that call the Southern
Ocean home, including several
species of whales and penguins, the
charismatic heroes of many a chil
dren's story.
But the reserve would be closed
to fishing. So China, Russia, and
the Ukraine balked at its establish
ment, and the conservation effort
fell short.
The Antarctic negotiation rep

resents a single example in an on
going series that will only become
more complicated as our demands
on the planet's natural resources
increase and diversify.
Even as we get better at moni
toring and stabilizing our fishery
stocks, we'll subject them to addi
tional pressures from offshore
drilling, cross-river hydroelectric

plants, and habitats shifted by
ocean acidification and sea level
rise.
And there will hardly be enough
time in a year to manage it all.
