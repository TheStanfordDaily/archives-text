## SLAC, IBM aim for faster supercomputers 
### ELIZABETH DAVIS 
Researchers from the SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory and IBM published
groundbreaking research on electronic ma
terial that has the potential to revolutionize
modern technology.
Lead researcher Stuart Parkin an
IBM fellow and a Stanford consulting pro
fessor— and lead author, Nagaphani Ae
tukuri M.S. 'OB Ph.D. '13 —whose work on
the project was advised by Electrical Engi
neering Professor James Harris '64 M.S.
'65 Ph.D '69 —worked with scientists to
study the behavior of vanadium oxide, an
electronic material uniquely useful for re

search since it is a member of a certain class
of strongly correlated electron systems.
These materials are able to transition
from being conductors to insulators at cer
tain temperatures. Research focused on un
derstanding why the transition occurs, how
to control the temperature at which the
transition happens and how to apply the re
search to new technology in devices.
Through experimental observations, the
IBM/SLAC team first proposed a theoiy as
to why vanadium oxide transitioned into an
insulating material. They determined that
the transition was occurring due to a change
in the subatomic structure of the compound.
"In the vanadium oxide we are differen

tiating the electron orbitals," Aetukuri said.
"There were two orbitals we could differen
tiate in our experiment. Usually the elec
trons occupy one set of orbitals. And when
electrons occupy another set of orbitals they
take on an insulating state."
"So we can deterministically control the
state of the material by putting the elec
trons in specific orbitals and that is some
thing we inferred in our experiment," he
added.
Once the research team had a fundamen
tal understanding of the material's strong
electronic properties, they were able to con-

tool and manipulate it.
Most of the paper the
team published in "Nature
Physics" centered on chang
ing and engineering the con
ditions at which the material
undergoes its transition.
To do this, the scientists
grew thin films of vanadium
dioxide, one subatomic level
at a time, and changed the
strain imposed on the materi
al. This procedure allowed
them to influence the materi

al's electronic properties and
control its temperature to
better understand how to
take the insulating material
and change it into metallic
material almost instantly.
The team's research has
many impactful applications,
notably the development of
ultra-fast and more energy
efficient switches that can
quickly turn on and off elec
tronic devices. It would also
be helpful in building devices
with higher-level cognitive
capabilities.
Though the computing
power of supercomputers has
increased over time, these
computers are still nowhere

as powerful as a human
brain. The controlled use of
the vanadium oxide material
could be used in engineering
three-dimensional supercom
puters that are able to rewire
their configurations as they
are utilized in order to per
form computations more effi
ciently.
The IBM/SLAC team will
now move on to analyzing
why the material switches so
quickly, using SLAC's Linac
Coherent Light Source.
"I think this research is ex
tremely fundamental," Parkin
said. "We're going where no
one's been before, therefore
there are no limitations."

"It's exploratory, so we
have a direction we want to
focus on and a question we
want to answer, but it's not
limited at all," he added.
"However, the fundamental
goal is basically the same:
to build more efficient com
puting devices that can ac
tually think, thinking sys
tems."
