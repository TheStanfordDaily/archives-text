Researchers from the SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory and IBM published
groundbreaking research on electronic ma
terial that has the potential to revolutionize
modern technology.
Lead researcher Stuart Parkin an
IBM fellow and a Stanford consulting pro
fessor— and lead author, Nagaphani Ae
tukuri M.S. 'OB Ph.D. '13 —whose work on
the project was advised by Electrical Engi
neering Professor James Harris '64 M.S.
'65 Ph.D '69 —worked with scientists to
study the behavior of vanadium oxide, an
electronic material uniquely useful for re

search since it is a member of a certain class
of strongly correlated electron systems.
These materials are able to transition
from being conductors to insulators at cer
tain temperatures. Research focused on un
derstanding why the transition occurs, how
to control the temperature at which the
transition happens and how to apply the re
search to new technology in devices.
Through experimental observations, the
IBM/SLAC team first proposed a theoiy as
to why vanadium oxide transitioned into an
insulating material. They determined that
the transition was occurring due to a change
in the subatomic structure of the compound.
"In the vanadium oxide we are differen

tiating the electron orbitals," Aetukuri said.
"There were two orbitals we could differen
tiate in our experiment. Usually the elec
trons occupy one set of orbitals. And when
electrons occupy another set of orbitals they
take on an insulating state."
"So we can deterministically control the
state of the material by putting the elec
trons in specific orbitals and that is some
thing we inferred in our experiment," he
added.
Once the research team had a fundamen
tal understanding of the material's strong
electronic properties, they were able to con-
