## D-CEL takes off with new directors 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The Office of the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education (VPUE) has recently hired
two new directors, Luke Terra M.A. 'OB Ph.D.
'l5 and Suzanne Gaulocher, for its three-year
Directors of Community-Engaged Learning
(D-CEL) pilot program.
The D-CEL program came out of an effort
to address the suggestions made by the Study
of Undergraduate Education at Stanford
(SUES) report last academic year and will focus
on expanding community-based learning oppor
tunities and internships for both faculty and
students.
According to Thomas Schnaubelt, assistant
vice provost and executive director of the Haas

Center for Public Service, Terra was hired in
mid-September and later joined by Gaulocher
in the beginning of October. Despite only being
on the job for a short time, both directors are
making full use of their time here.
At the moment, Gaulocher is holding meet
ings with various offices and departments in
the University, including the Office of Com
munity Health and the Haas Center.
Gaulocher, who has a background in public
health, also added that she was beginning to
work closely with faculty and students in the
Program in Human Biology.
"It's really an important time for making
connections," Gaulocher said. "Much of commu
nity-engaged learning and what happens in

communities is about rela
tionships and building good
trusting relationships."
"I'm trying to build a
presence on campus, being
known so that the faculty
identifies this as a resource
for them and really building
communities and sustaining
equitable community part
nerships," she added.
Terra, who is finishing his
doctoral program at the Grad
uate School of Education, also
said that part of his position
includes getting to know the
resources that Stanford al
ready offers, what he termed
as the "ecology" of the people
and the programs here.
"Part of what we need to
make sure is that we know all
the ways students engage in
the community already, so
that we can fill gaps and that
we're not duplicating efforts,"
Terra said. "[D-CEL] may
seem like a new program, but
it is really just building upon a
really good foundation that
others have already con
tributed to building."
Terra added he is cur
rently working with faculty
interested in integrating
their coursework with com
munity-based learning op
portunities and is holding of
fice hours with students to
hear what kind of courses
they are looking for and what
kinds of organizations they
want to have internships
with.
In particular, the D-CEL
program will focus on in
creasing these opportunities
in education, health and the
environment.
"These three themes are
priorities within the commu
nity," Schnaubelt said. "We
also know there's particular
talent in these areas in our
faculty, as well as interest in
our students."
With the various people
the directors will need to
work with, Gaulocher hopes
to spend her time evenly be
tween working with faculty,
guiding students and work
ing with the community.
"A lot of the times I feel
[the community] is an after
thought," Gaufocher said.
"It's important to consider
what communities think be
cause this will determine what
resources are allocated to
them if this isn't done, the
efforts done in the community
may not be meaningful to the
people who are living there."
Schnaubelt hopes that D
CEL will create more oppor
tunities for students to take
courses that will give them
community experience and
allow the university to assess
what is being done well in
community-engaged learn
ing and what improvements
need to be made.
"In the long run, we want
to increase the number of
seniors that leave Stanford
saying that they had some
sort of experience working in
the community or in an in
ternship," Schnaubelt said.
Terra and Gaulocher will
be working as a team with
another director, who will be
hired by the beginning of
January.
