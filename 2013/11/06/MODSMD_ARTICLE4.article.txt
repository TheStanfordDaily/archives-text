## UAR hopes for more Senior Synthesis grant applications 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
After receiving lower than expected interest from
seniors last year, Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR) is continuing to encourage seniors and
juniors to work on a Senior Synthesis grant.
Project applications are received monthly beginning
in October and according to Brian Thomas, associate
dean of UAR, no students applied last month.
The grant program was first launched in January of

last year and Thomas
said that he expected
more interest last
year from seniors.
However, after being
given a chance to
speak with an adviso
ry group of students
later that year, he re
alized there was a dif
ferent class year at
tracted to the pro
gram.
"They all started
thinking earlier than
expected, as juniors,"
Thomas said. "They
saw the end and they
had their plans cast."
However, Thomas
said he believes that
the outreach and
publicity done last
year will generate
more proposals this
year because stu-

dents have had more time to think about incorporating
these projects into their time at Stanford.
Some students have already begun working on their
projects, which are meant to allow time to reflect on a
substantial amount of academic work and personal ex
periences at Stanford.
"The kinds of projects we're supporting are really
varied, by nature of the grant itself," Thomas said.
He explained how one student combined her inter
est in cosmology with a study of cultural dances.
"We had an STS major who was interested in as
tronomy and cosmology and ... she had a serious side
interest in dance, and had taken a lot of courses in
dance at Stanford, and wanted to cross those two in
terests," he said. "The way she did that was to go and
study with some dance troupes that were working on
a body of work originating in West Africa, that was
expressing the origin stories of West African cul
ture."
For her project, Elizabeth Matus 'l4 brought to
gether her academic interests in culture, media and so
ciety with her personal experiences living in Synergy.
"I started thinking about the structure of [Synergy]
and the activities we do, and how we structure the
space that we reside in and how those things have de
veloped and maintained the culture we are living in,"
she said.
Matus looked at two different co-ops and two differ
ent "eco-villages" this summer, places that are de
scribed as intentional communities.
"I was studying at these different sites how the cul
ture of the sites and the social order that's decided up
on and agreed upon is maintained," Matus said. "I
