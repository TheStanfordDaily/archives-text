# Senior grant underused
## UAR hopes for more Senior Synthesis grant applications 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
After receiving lower than expected interest from
seniors last year, Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR) is continuing to encourage seniors and
juniors to work on a Senior Synthesis grant.
Project applications are received monthly beginning
in October and according to Brian Thomas, associate
dean of UAR, no students applied last month.
The grant program was first launched in January of

last year and Thomas
said that he expected
more interest last
year from seniors.
However, after being
given a chance to
speak with an adviso
ry group of students
later that year, he re
alized there was a dif
ferent class year at
tracted to the pro
gram.
"They all started
thinking earlier than
expected, as juniors,"
Thomas said. "They
saw the end and they
had their plans cast."
However, Thomas
said he believes that
the outreach and
publicity done last
year will generate
more proposals this
year because stu-

dents have had more time to think about incorporating
these projects into their time at Stanford.
Some students have already begun working on their
projects, which are meant to allow time to reflect on a
substantial amount of academic work and personal ex
periences at Stanford.
"The kinds of projects we're supporting are really
varied, by nature of the grant itself," Thomas said.
He explained how one student combined her inter
est in cosmology with a study of cultural dances.
"We had an STS major who was interested in as
tronomy and cosmology and ... she had a serious side
interest in dance, and had taken a lot of courses in
dance at Stanford, and wanted to cross those two in
terests," he said. "The way she did that was to go and
study with some dance troupes that were working on
a body of work originating in West Africa, that was
expressing the origin stories of West African cul
ture."
For her project, Elizabeth Matus 'l4 brought to
gether her academic interests in culture, media and so
ciety with her personal experiences living in Synergy.
"I started thinking about the structure of [Synergy]
and the activities we do, and how we structure the
space that we reside in and how those things have de
veloped and maintained the culture we are living in,"
she said.
Matus looked at two different co-ops and two differ
ent "eco-villages" this summer, places that are de
scribed as intentional communities.
"I was studying at these different sites how the cul
ture of the sites and the social order that's decided up
on and agreed upon is maintained," Matus said. "I

wanted to see how the cul
ture is manifested across dif
ferent worlds, within older
communities and younger
communities ... basically a
comparison across these in
tentional living spaces."
For Matus' final project,
she is putting together a
print publication that will
capture her experiences and
observations from her sum
mer interactions with these
intentional communities.
"I want to be able to de
scribe to someone who does
n't have the ability to go to
these places about the experi
ences there... with stories,
pictures, and interviews," she
added.
Matus said she saw the
synthesis project as a chance
to bring together her life and
academics at Stanford.
According to Thomas,
every student who receives a
synthesis grant is asked to
work with a faculty member,
but sometimes it can be hard
for students to identify who
would be best to work with.
"In the research world,
it's clear who your mentor
should be: someone who's
working on similar projects
and can help you with tech
niques," he said. "In a syn
thesis project, sometimes
that's the best match, but
there are other mentors that

make sense too. That might
include your academic advi
sor or maybe your pre-major
advisor as a freshman
maybe you've stayed in
touch with (them) and
they've seen you develop
over the four years."
Matus enlisted Fred
Turner, an associate profes
sor of communication, to
help with her project.
"I worked with Professor
Turner on my project and
met with him during the year
before my summer doing re
search," she said. "He told
me what places to look at
and what literature to read.
He was very encouraging
and helped me feel like I was
capable of doing what I was
doing."
However, one issue Ma
tus had with her synthesis
project was, because she re
ceived the grant during its
pilot year, she didn't have
anything to compare her
progress with.
"I felt like I had a lot of
independence and creative li
cense with my project, to
come at it organically with
out worrying too much about
the structure of my final
piece," she said. "It's a bless
ing and a curse to have the
creative license and so many
possibilities to take the proj
ect and make it something
that's my voice ... but it's dif
ficult to gauge whether or not
I'm doing a good job."
