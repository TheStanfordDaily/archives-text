### ANDREW VOGELEY 
The 15th Undergraduate Senate
met Tuesday night to finalize plans
for the football rally, nominate sena
tors to several University commit
tees, increase the cap for honoraria
funding and receive an update on ju
dicial affairs.
An idea for a new peer mentor
ship program for students from mi
nority communities was also dis
cussed.
The football rally for tomorrow's
game against Oregon, scheduled for
Thursday at 12 p.m. in White Plaza,
will be filmed by ESPN, which will
incorporate the footage into seg
ments on that evening's football
game.
Senator Nikos Liodakis 'l6 noted

that there will be face paint and
posters.
"We want students to be able to
get decked out for ESPN," Liodakis
said. The event will also include a
surprise guest speaker, as well as an
appearance from several members
of the men's basketball team both
features organized by the ASSU.
There will also be food and music,
Senator Brianna Brown'l6 added.
Senate Chair Ben Holston 'l5 ex
pressed excitement for the event, as
well as praise for the work of his fel
low senators.
"Briana and Nikos have done a
fantastic job [organizing the
event],"Holston said. "I hope we get
a ton of people there. I think having

ESPN there is really excit
ing,"
Other festivities leading up
to the game will include the
second tailgate of the year,
starting at 3 p.m. at Ueland
Field.
In addition to finalizing the
football rally, the Senate also
passed three bills, including a
bill that increased the amount
of money available to fund hon
oraria up to $1,500 as long as
the event met attendance re
quirement of over 100 people.
Honoraria will also now have a
soft cap of $l,OOO with an esti
mate of $lO/person.
"The previous [policy] was

that all groups could get $l,OOO
for honoraria and we found
that [it] was problematic be
cause some groups wanted to
get some really cool speakers
who cost over $1,000," Senator
Angela Zhang 'l6 said. "We
just wanted to make it easier
for [the student groups] to get
that extra money."
The other two bills passed
dealt with the Nominations
Commission. The first bill,
passed unanimously, con
firmed the nominees to vari
ous University committees,
such as the Judicial Panel
Pool and the Committee on
Undergraduate Standards
and Policy, among others.
The second bill, which also
passed unanimously, shifted
the timeline of terms for the
Nomination's Commission
from beginning in spring

quarter and ending in winter
quarter to beginning in win
ter quarter and ending in fall
quarter.

The Senate also received
an update from Senator John-
Lancaster Finley'l6 on the
first meeting of the Joint Leg
islative Committee on Judi
cial Affairs, which was creat
ed to address concerns over
the Board on Judicial Affair
bylaws.
"We are anticipating, par
ticularly in the conversation
about the bylaws, heavy out
side input," Finley said. "We
are hoping by the end of the
fall quarter to have our re
sponse to the bylaws."
Near the end of the meet
ing, Senator Hisham Al-Fal
ih'l6 introduced ideas for a
new peer mentoring program
to be housed within the Ca

reer Development Center.
"I feel like minority stu
dents feel pressured to get
jobs and internships and sta
tistically speaking, minority
students don't necessarily get
as good of jobs or intern
ships," Al-Falih said, "I feel
like more support should be
given to minority students."
Falih's initial idea called
for a peer mentorship pro
gram that would take stu
dents from the different mi
nority communities on cam
pus and train them to become
mentors to students who
might feel more comfortable
speaking to a mentor from a
similar background. This idea
is still in the development
phase.
