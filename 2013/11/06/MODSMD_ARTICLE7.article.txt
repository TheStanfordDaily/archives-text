## Martin bullying not okay 
### Viggy Venkataraman 
The sad stories coming out of
Miami seem to be escalat
ing in their intensity with
each passing minute. At
first, the only news we had
was that offensive tackle (and Stan
ford product) Jonathan Martin 'l2
had angrily stormed out of the Dol
phins facility in response to some un
known catalyst. We then found out
that he had allegedly been the subject
of targeted hazing—the brainchild of
specific members of the team. We
then learned that the biggest culprit
behind the hazing was offensive guard
Richie Incognito, who was (in an al
most oxymoronic pairing), as recently
as last year, voted the dirtiest player
in the entire NFL whilst also winning
the Miami Dolphins' team-wide "Good
Guy" award.
Incognito then took to Twitter to
voice his outrage, ironically threaten
ing violence on anyone who dared to
question his good conduct. The final
revelation was the virulence of Incog
nito's assault against Martin. The ma
terial is not fit for print in any publica
tion, but suffice it to say that Incogni
to's attacks on Martin involved racist
overtones and threats of actual vio
lence.
The saddest thing of all has been
the overall reaction across the NFL
and the blogosphere that we live in to
day Though many have spoken in
support of Martin, who has left the
team indefinitely, there seem to be an
equal nmnber of people standing by
Incognito, saying that "this is how
football works" and that Martin, by
ratting out his teammate, had crossed
some sort of line.
In my opinion, the only person
who has crossed any sort of line is In
cognito. His actions are simply inde
fensible.
It is one thing to give a rookie a
hard time; for whatever reason, that
sort of abuse has become the "norm"
in all sports and that is a debate for
another time. But what Incognito has
evidently put Martin through far out
paces any reasonable limit on what is
fair in hazing.
If you've ever watched "Hard
Knocks," the standard rookie punish
ment is getting tied to the goalposts,
being doused in Gatorade or being
forced to pick up the tab at a team din
ner with the rest of the rookies. Nev
er have I seen or even heard of play
ers being forced to pony up $15,000
for a trip to Las Vegas that they didn't
even go on, or suffering from months
upon months upon months of persist
ent abuse and harassment.
Somewhere, hazing crossed the
line into the full-scale bullying that
Martin could no longer handle. More
over, Martin is now in his second year
with the Dolphins, having "paid his
dues" by already having been on the
receiving end of the hazing for an en
tire year. Yet, all indications are that
Incognito continued his assault on
Martin's psyche until Martin finally
decided that enough was enough last
week.
It is quite clear that football cul
ture in America is seriously warped, if
in fact people think that this is the
norm or at all defensible. Many are
saying that Martin should have set
tled this mano-a-mano with Incognito.
Others are claiming that he, as a re
portedly quiet and introspective per
son, was an easy target for someone of
Incognito's ilk. Still others insist that
whatever Incognito's actions were,
Martin, as an athlete paid by the Dol
phins to play football, shouldn't have
walked out on his team.
To each of these viewpoints: I offer
my sympathies, but you are so totally
wrong. To me, Martin walking away
showed that he was the better person.
He was willing to make a stand in a
nonviolent way as opposed to justify
ing the stereotype that we often un
fairly peg offensive linemen with.
His soft-spoken and quiet nature
might just have made him a bigger
target, but that still misses the point.
What he went through was far be
yond what is both socially and mental
ly acceptable. Finally, although we
tend to overinflate its importance in
our society, football is just a game. Yes,
it is an organized sport that millions
pay to watch, but at its core, it is a
game. Many things are more impor
tant in life than football, and mental
well-being is one of them.
Bullying is a problem at almost
every institutional level, from schools
to summer camps to spoils teams to

God knows what else, and its
consequences are consistently
dire, both for the individuals in
volved and for the people sur
rounding them. It is sad but
true that even adults can fall in
to this vicious trap, as this
whole situation clearly evinces.

As facts continue to filter
through the proper channels, I
certainly hope that this whole
sordid saga can come to a
quick and clean ending.

Jonathan Martin has exposed
the noxious underbelly of haz
ing by standing up for what is
right or by simply showing
that even a giant millionaire
athlete can struggle to deal
with a bully —it is now up to
us to give him our support and
to deal with the abusers firmly.
There is no place in society for
such jarring fundamental dis
respect. We must strive to get
rid of it as much as we can.

The sad stories coming out of
Miami seem to be escalat
ing in their intensity with
each passing minute. At
first, the only news we had
was that offensive tackle (and Stan
ford product) Jonathan Martin 'l2
had angrily stormed out of the Dol
phins facility in response to some un
known catalyst. We then found out
that he had allegedly been the subject
of targeted hazing—the brainchild of
specific members of the team. We
then learned that the biggest culprit
behind the hazing was offensive guard
Richie Incognito, who was (in an al
most oxymoronic pairing), as recently
as last year, voted the dirtiest player
in the entire NFL whilst also winning
the Miami Dolphins' team-wide "Good
Guy" award.
Incognito then took to Twitter to
voice his outrage, ironically threaten
ing violence on anyone who dared to
question his good conduct. The final
revelation was the virulence of Incog
nito's assault against Martin. The ma
terial is not fit for print in any publica
tion, but suffice it to say that Incogni
to's attacks on Martin involved racist
overtones and threats of actual vio
lence.
The saddest thing of all has been
the overall reaction across the NFL
and the blogosphere that we live in to
day Though many have spoken in
support of Martin, who has left the
team indefinitely, there seem to be an
equal nmnber of people standing by
Incognito, saying that "this is how
football works" and that Martin, by
ratting out his teammate, had crossed
some sort of line.
In my opinion, the only person
who has crossed any sort of line is In
cognito. His actions are simply inde
fensible.
It is one thing to give a rookie a
hard time; for whatever reason, that
sort of abuse has become the "norm"
in all sports and that is a debate for
another time. But what Incognito has
evidently put Martin through far out
paces any reasonable limit on what is
fair in hazing.
If you've ever watched "Hard
Knocks," the standard rookie punish
ment is getting tied to the goalposts,
being doused in Gatorade or being
forced to pick up the tab at a team din
ner with the rest of the rookies. Nev
er have I seen or even heard of play
ers being forced to pony up $15,000
for a trip to Las Vegas that they didn't
even go on, or suffering from months
upon months upon months of persist
ent abuse and harassment.
Somewhere, hazing crossed the
line into the full-scale bullying that
Martin could no longer handle. More
over, Martin is now in his second year
with the Dolphins, having "paid his
dues" by already having been on the
receiving end of the hazing for an en
tire year. Yet, all indications are that
Incognito continued his assault on
Martin's psyche until Martin finally
decided that enough was enough last
week.
It is quite clear that football cul
ture in America is seriously warped, if
in fact people think that this is the
norm or at all defensible. Many are
saying that Martin should have set
tled this mano-a-mano with Incognito.
Others are claiming that he, as a re
portedly quiet and introspective per
son, was an easy target for someone of
Incognito's ilk. Still others insist that
whatever Incognito's actions were,
Martin, as an athlete paid by the Dol
phins to play football, shouldn't have
walked out on his team.
To each of these viewpoints: I offer
my sympathies, but you are so totally
wrong. To me, Martin walking away
showed that he was the better person.
He was willing to make a stand in a
nonviolent way as opposed to justify
ing the stereotype that we often un
fairly peg offensive linemen with.
His soft-spoken and quiet nature
might just have made him a bigger
target, but that still misses the point.
What he went through was far be
yond what is both socially and mental
ly acceptable. Finally, although we
tend to overinflate its importance in
our society, football is just a game. Yes,
it is an organized sport that millions
pay to watch, but at its core, it is a
game. Many things are more impor
tant in life than football, and mental
well-being is one of them.
Bullying is a problem at almost
every institutional level, from schools
to summer camps to spoils teams to

God knows what else, and its
consequences are consistently
dire, both for the individuals in
volved and for the people sur
rounding them. It is sad but
true that even adults can fall in
to this vicious trap, as this
whole situation clearly evinces.

As facts continue to filter
through the proper channels, I
certainly hope that this whole
sordid saga can come to a
quick and clean ending.

Jonathan Martin has exposed
the noxious underbelly of haz
ing by standing up for what is
right or by simply showing
that even a giant millionaire
athlete can struggle to deal
with a bully —it is now up to
us to give him our support and
to deal with the abusers firmly.
There is no place in society for
such jarring fundamental dis
respect. We must strive to get
rid of it as much as we can.
