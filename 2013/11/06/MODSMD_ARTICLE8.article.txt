# BACK AND FORTH WITH OREGON, PART 1
## WHY THE DUCKS WILL WIN 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Thursday's
football game between Stan
ford arid Oregon, The Daily's
David Cohn chatted with
Preston Hiefield, sports di
rector of DuckTV, the Uni
versity of Oregon's student
television station, to get per
spectives from both camps on
how Oregon coidd beat Stan
ford. Below is a. partial tran
script of their conversation.

script of their back-and
forth, go to www.stanforddai
ly. com/category/sports.
Check back for pari two in to
morrow's Game Day issue of
The Daily for a conversation
focusing on how Stanford
could, beat Oregon.

David Cohn (DC): We certainly
have a great matchup on our
hands this week, with Oregon and
Stanford once again demonstrat
ing themselves to be the class of
the Pac-12. Both teams have had
their moments at home and on
the road in this series over the
last four years, so in theory, either
team could win on Thursday.
However, I want to focus on a top
ic that I know you (Preston) will
probably appreciate: why and
how Oregon can win this
matchup.
I am going to have to swallow
my strong sense of Stanford foot
ball pride for this conversation. I
guess I will manage.... Let me
first, however, get your assess
ment of Oregon's season so far.

Preston Hiefield (PH): I would
say that Oregon's season has
gone as expected for the most
part. [Quarterback] Marcus Mar
iota has looked (mostly) spectacu

lar, although I will say that [Flori
da State quarterback] Jameis
Winston looks like the more de
serving Heisman candidate
through this point of the season.
Now that both [former Oregon
running backs] Kenjon Barner
and LaMichael James are gone, it
looks like Byron Marshall is capa
ble of being a quality featured
back for a team that prides itself
on running the football to set up
the pass.
The biggest question mark up
to this point of the season is the
[team's] health and, in turn, the
playmaking ability of [running
back] De' Anthony Thomas. Most
of the country knows what a fan

tastic athlete he is, but he has car
ried the ball just 10 times since
the Sept. 14 game against Ten
nessee due to a high ankle sprain.

DC: I believe that any conversa
tion regarding Oregon's offense,
in contrast with prior years, be
gins with Marcus Mariota. Mario
ta had a fabulous debut last sea
son for Oregon; however, he has
been even better this season, a
fact that is reflected in the in
crease in his adjusted QBR from
87.8 to 94.9 on a 0-100 scale. That
is absolutely remarkable. If Mar
iota plays at this near-perfect lev
el, Oregon will win this football
game.

PH: Definitely. A 94.9, as you
know, is ludicrous. So ridiculous,
in fact, that it would be a big sur
prise to me if he reaches that
mark this Thursday. Recall that
the Stanford defense, which Ore
gon has tremendous respect for,
held Mariota to a 44.9 QBR in last
year's game at Autzen Stadium.
He completed 21-of-37 for 207
yards with one touchdown and
one interception.
But stats don't tell the whole
story. Aside from one breakaway
run, Stanford really limited his
ability to stretch the field verti
cally. When Oregon is unable to

complete passes of 15-plus
yards on a consistent basis
against good teams, their
running game can become
slightly predictable. Playing
against Stanford's front
seven, undoubtedly one of
the best in the country, it
will be imperative for Mari
ota and this offense to get
the ball down field vertically
and loosen up the Cardinal's
linebackers.

DC: Let's now turn to the
defense for Oregon. I would
say that a stereotype that
may exist in college football
conversations, namely be
cause the Ducks are so tal
ented and successful on of
fense, is that Oregon doesn't
play defense. I know a lot of
SEC fans love to bring up
this point when they try to
discredit Oregon's merit in
the national championship
conversation. Who is the
player on defense that is
most likely to elevate the
play of the entire unit?

PH: Oregon's secondary has
produced some awesome
players in recent years, and
junior corner Ifo Ekpre-Olo
mu is the next in line. He saw
significant time as a true
freshman in 2011, including
the Rose Bowl against Wis
consin where he gave up two
touchdowns to Jared Ab
brederis. Since that game,
though, he has played like
a potential first- or sec
ond-round NFL Draft
pick. He reminds me a lit
tle bit of former LSU star
Tyrann Mathieu in that he
is just always around the
football. His cover skills are
elite, but more than that he
just makes plays. He's the
type of corner who, due to
his lack of size, always plays
with a chip on his shoulder
no matter who the competi
tion is. His tenacity as a
player and as a leader for
this Oregon defense will be a
big key for the Ducks
against Stanford.

DC: If Oregon wins this
game, what do you expect
the makeup of the game and
the general trends of the
game to be? Secondly, what
is your actual prediction for

the score and why?
PH: Should Oregon win, I
would expect the game to be
much more like the Ducks'
2011 victory over Stanford
than their 2010 win. In 2010,
they had to come from be
hind down 21-3. In 2011,
however, they jumped out of
the gates quickly and it felt
like Stanford was trying to
play catch-up the rest of the
way. The Cardinal seemed
uncomfortable trying to go
score for score with Oregon,
and who could blame it?
This is a game that could
go either way, but the Ducks
played so poorly in 2012
against the Cardinal that I
think they will come out with
a razor-sharp focus and a re
lentless attitude. Also keep
in mind that Oregon has ac
tually been better on the
road than at home during
the last four years. Stan
ford's defense and rushing
attack keeps them in it, but
I'll say Oregon scores on a
few explosive plays and
hangs on. Oregon 34, Stan
ford 20.
