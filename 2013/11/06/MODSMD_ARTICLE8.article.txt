# BACK AND FORTH WITH OREGON, PART 1
## WHY THE DUCKS WILL WIN 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Thursday's
football game between Stan
ford arid Oregon, The Daily's
David Cohn chatted with
Preston Hiefield, sports di
rector of DuckTV, the Uni
versity of Oregon's student
television station, to get per
spectives from both camps on
how Oregon coidd beat Stan
ford. Below is a. partial tran
script of their conversation.
For a more complete tran
script of their back-and
forth, go to www.stanforddai

Check back for pari two in to
morrow's Game Day issue of
The Daily for a conversation
focusing on how Stanford
could, beat Oregon.

David Cohn (DC): We certainly
have a great matchup on our
hands this week, with Oregon and
Stanford once again demonstrat
ing themselves to be the class of
the Pac-12. Both teams have had
their moments at home and on
the road in this series over the
last four years, so in theory, either
team could win on Thursday.
However, I want to focus on a top
ic that I know you (Preston) will
probably appreciate: why and
how Oregon can win this
matchup.
I am going to have to swallow
my strong sense of Stanford foot
ball pride for this conversation. I
guess I will manage.... Let me
first, however, get your assess
ment of Oregon's season so far.

Preston Hiefield (PH): I would
say that Oregon's season has
gone as expected for the most
part. [Quarterback] Marcus Mar
iota has looked (mostly) spectacu

lar, although I will say that [Flori
da State quarterback] Jameis
Winston looks like the more de
serving Heisman candidate
through this point of the season.
Now that both [former Oregon
running backs] Kenjon Barner
and LaMichael James are gone, it
looks like Byron Marshall is capa
ble of being a quality featured
back for a team that prides itself
on running the football to set up
the pass.
The biggest question mark up
to this point of the season is the
[team's] health and, in turn, the
playmaking ability of [running
back] De' Anthony Thomas. Most
of the country knows what a fan

tastic athlete he is, but he has car
ried the ball just 10 times since
the Sept. 14 game against Ten
nessee due to a high ankle sprain.

DC: I believe that any conversa
tion regarding Oregon's offense,
in contrast with prior years, be
gins with Marcus Mariota. Mario
ta had a fabulous debut last sea
son for Oregon; however, he has
been even better this season, a
fact that is reflected in the in
crease in his adjusted QBR from
87.8 to 94.9 on a 0-100 scale. That
is absolutely remarkable. If Mar
iota plays at this near-perfect lev
el, Oregon will win this football
game.

PH: Definitely. A 94.9, as you
know, is ludicrous. So ridiculous,
in fact, that it would be a big sur
prise to me if he reaches that
mark this Thursday. Recall that
the Stanford defense, which Ore
gon has tremendous respect for,
held Mariota to a 44.9 QBR in last
year's game at Autzen Stadium.
He completed 21-of-37 for 207
yards with one touchdown and
one interception.
But stats don't tell the whole
story. Aside from one breakaway
run, Stanford really limited his
ability to stretch the field verti
cally. When Oregon is unable to


AVI BAGLA/The Stanford Daily
Senior linebacker Trent Murphy (center) and the rest of Stanford's defense will face their stiffest task of
the season in finding away to stop Heisman hopeful Marcus Mariota and the Ducks' powerful offense.
