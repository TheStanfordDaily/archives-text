# DISAPPOINTING PAC-12 PREVIEW
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Golf tournaments in Hawaii sometimes aren't always
all they are cracked up to be. First, there's the long flight
and the subsequent jet lag. Then, there's the issue of ac
tually focusing on the event. The latter can be quite a task,
as picturesque ocean views and beautiful beaches can be
just a little bit distracting.
Sophomore Mariah Stackhouse and the rest of her
Stanford women's golf teammates learned that lesson the
hard way at the Pac-12 Preview held at the Nanea Golf
Course in Kailua Kona, Hawaii, which concluded yester
day. The Cardinal, which entered the tournament ranked
fifth in the nation only good enough for fourth in the ul
tra-competitive Pac-12 finished a disappointing sixth at
Nanea, 22 strokes back of second-ranked USC.
The 54-hole event spanned only two days, meaning
players had to complete in two full rounds on Monday.
Junior Mariko Thmangan, who has shown flashes of
greatness throughout the fall, paced the Card in the open
ing frame, shooting 5-under on the front nine en route to
a 4-under 69 on the extremely exclusive, par-73 course.
Stackhouse also had a solid first round, notching a 2-
under 71 to put Stanford in a tie for seventh with Cal.

the afternoon, improving its
cumulative team score by
three shots and jumping up to
fifth in the team standings.
Despite the resurgence, the
Cardinal was already 13
strokes out of first and falling

out of striking distance.
Monday's second round
saw freshman Casey Daniel
son lead the way for her team,
carding a 3-under 70 despite a
double-bogey at the par-4
sixth hole. Stackhouse repeat
ed her 2-under morning per
formance, birdieing three out
of her last four holes to move
into a tie for sixth in the indi
vidual race. Thmangan, who
followed up her first round of

69 with a less impressive sec
ond-round score of 74, was still
in the top 10 after 36 holes.
Yesterday's final round
was not kind to most teams,
with only one squad the
Trojans coming in under
par. Stanford recorded its
worst single round of the tour
nament, shooting 10-over as a
team without a single golfer
breaking par. The Card was
leapfrogged by another top-10
team, Arizona State, and by
Oregon to ultimately finish in
sixth place.
Even in a stacked Pac-12,
Walker had hoped for a top
five placing at the tourna
ment. Although the final
tournament of its fall sched
ule will likely leave a bad
taste in her players' mouths,
the past five events revealed
several key aspects of this
particular team that will cer
tainly aid it as it moves into
the spring.
Most importantly, the
Cardinal realized that its
squad possesses true depth.
Though Staekhouse was the
low-scorer in three of the five
tournaments, Himangan and
fellow sophomore Lauren
Kim proved that they could
step up and lead the team
as well. Stanford's team
depth was clear in the ac
tion at Nanea, where the
team had three different low
scorers in each of the three
rounds.
Furthermore, senior
Marissa Mar's play at the
Stanford Intercollegiate
showed the Card that it would
still have a very capable golfer
to call upon, should an injury
or any inconsistent play arise.
The fall also was an opportuni
ty for the freshmen, Danielson
and Quirine Eijkenboom, to
show their mettle, with both
performing admirably in their
NCAA debuts.
Finally, the team's per
formances at the Edean Ih
lanfeldt and Windy City Clas
sic in particular indicate that
this team is capable of being an
NCAA contender if everybody
is clicking at the right time.
Stanford will open its
spring schedule back at home,
as it plays host to the Peg
Barnard Invitational on Feb.
15-16.
