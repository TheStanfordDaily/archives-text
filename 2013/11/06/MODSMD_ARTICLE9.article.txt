# DISAPPOINTING PAC-12 PREVIEW
## 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Golf tournaments in Hawaii sometimes aren't always
all they are cracked up to be. First, there's the long flight
and the subsequent jet lag. Then, there's the issue of ac
tually focusing on the event. The latter can be quite a task,
as picturesque ocean views and beautiful beaches can be
just a little bit distracting.
Sophomore Mariah Stackhouse and the rest of her
Stanford women's golf teammates learned that lesson the
hard way at the Pac-12 Preview held at the Nanea Golf
Course in Kailua Kona, Hawaii, which concluded yester
day. The Cardinal, which entered the tournament ranked
fifth in the nation only good enough for fourth in the ul
tra-competitive Pac-12 finished a disappointing sixth at
Nanea, 22 strokes back of second-ranked USC.
The 54-hole event spanned only two days, meaning
players had to complete in two full rounds on Monday.
Junior Mariko Thmangan, who has shown flashes of
greatness throughout the fall, paced the Card in the open
ing frame, shooting 5-under on the front nine en route to
a 4-under 69 on the extremely exclusive, par-73 course.
Stackhouse also had a solid first round, notching a 2-
under 71 to put Stanford in a tie for seventh with Cal.
Head coach Anne Walker's squad fared slightly better in
