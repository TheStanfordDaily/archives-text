WHAT STANFORD NEEDS TO DO TO SLOW DOWN THE OREGON DUCKS
BY WINSTON SHI • GRAPHIC BY VICTOR XU
Make the Ducks go the distance
Oregon points scored vs. UCLA offense time of possession
Stop the Ducks with a 6-man box
If you give an offense enough time it
will eventually make mistakes and
grind to a halt —turnovers, penalties,
incompletions, and failed runs. Stan
ford needs to force Oregon to string
together ten good plays in order to
score.
The Cardinal offense is going to have
to hold the ball and give the defense
time to rest. In Oregon's last game
against UCLA, the Bruin defense held
the line for three quarters, but UCLA's
offense crashed to a halt, and,
constantly on the field, the defense
collapsed out of exhaustion. To sustain
the defense, Stanford needs to get 1-2
first downs each drive.
Oregon will be happy to run for 5 yards a pop all the way to the
end zone. Stanford needs to stop the run and it needs to
stop the run while leaving enough players in coverage to de
fend the pass. The Cardinal need to play with two high safeties.
Cover 4 (quarters) coverage will be a little weaker against short
passes but will free Stanford's safeties to play the run.

Scouting report
One key to the
game is that, in the
red zone, Oregon
will almost always
run to the boundary
(toward the nearest
sideline) against
UCLA, 11 out of 11
times
Keep contain
Prevent QB scrambling
Defend the seam routes
Stanford limits big plays by containing runs to the middle and removing Marcus Mariota's options in the passing game. Diagram 1: Stanford's defensive ends and outside linebackers need to
make sure Oregon's fast running backs cannot get to the outside, where there are fewer defenders and more space —this chokes the run game. Diagram 2: By dropping back a player (M)
to spy on Mariota, Stanford prevents QB scrambles. Diagram 3: Stanford also needs to stop Mariota from exploiting open spaces (seams) in zone coverage, especially when Stanford blitzes.

Blow up the Ducks' offensive line

Outside Zone
Power
By placing players opposite Oregon's guards and center (the Bear front), Stanford forces
one-on-one matchups instead of Oregon's favored double-teams. This immediate interior
pressure makes it very difficult for Oregon to use its core running plays: outside zone and
power. Both plays against the Bear give Stanford players easy paths into the Oregon back
field. A key point to remember is that, in the red zone, Oregon runs to the near side of the
field (the boundary) instead of the open side nearly 100 percent of the time.
Stanford needs to win the field position game. This means limiting Oregon's dangerous return
game: getting touchbacks on kickoffs and forcing fair catches on punts. Pinning Oregon within
its own 20 makes it incredibly difficult for Oregon to score. Turnovers do the exact opposite
Stanford nearly killed itself against Oregon last year with ill-timed fumbles.
The odds of scoring rise exponentially with success in the return game, as this chart by
Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer shows. If Stanford can force Oregon to go 80 yards
every drive, even the Ducks will have trouble getting to the end zone. But once Oregon crosses
the 50-yard line, Stanford needs to make big plays because the Ducks can use all four of their
downs instead of three.

Bash Read Option
RB Screen
If Oregon's running back lines up to the left, the play will typically go to the right. But in
Oregon's last game, UCLA overcommitted to the playside, and Oregon punished them by
running backside plays—the reversed Bash zone read and the RB flare screen.
Make Marcus Mariota beat you with his arm
Marcus Mariota thrives on overaggressive run defense and soft pass defense. He is an
accurate quarterback, but he is only mortal. When Oregon is in third and long and Mariota
needs to make plays in the dropback passing game, his efficiency sharply declines.
Forcing Mariota to face the full brunt of the Stanford pass rush is the best way to victory.
