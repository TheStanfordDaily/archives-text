Stanford Daily's recent book, "Rags to
Roses: The Rise of Stanford Football,"
on Stanford's win at Oregon in 2012.

One thing was clear: The road to the
Pac-12 Championship went through Ore
gon.

No team understood that fact better
than Stanford. For two consecutive sea
sons, the Ducks had denied the Cardinal
the conference title and a national champi
onship bid; Andrew Luck 'l2, who only
beat the Ducks once in his three-year play
ing career, had even admitted that Stanford
was suffering from an "Oregon problem."
With Luck gone, the Cardinal arrived at
Autzen as a 21-point underdog.
"Everyone had always talked about us
having an Oregon problem," said senior
free safety Ed Reynolds. "In my three years
here, the only [Pac-12] team that my class
hadn't beat was Oregon."
"It's really that environment, that
team, that offense —it poses kind of a
unique danger," said fifth-year senior inside
linebacker Shayne Skov.
Even so, the Cardinal players and
coaches didn't view their recent failures
against their nemesis as a deterrent. If any
thing, those two heartbreaking losses fu
eled the team's resolve to redeem itself.

"The motivation for us as players that
week was unmatched from any other game
that we've played in, just because of the
fact that we had been embarrassed by
those guys for two years in a row," said
fifth-year senior defensive end Ben Gard
ner. "They had really been the one thorn in


NATALIE CHENG/The Stanford Daily
our side, the one thing we couldn't
overcome in the regular season.
And the fact that nobody gave us a
chance that's one of those things
that helped build this program, that
no one ever gave us a chance. So we
were perfectly comfortable in that
niche."

"We went into that Oregon
game knowing that if we could drag
them into deep water, we've got a
chance," added defensive coordina
tor Derek Mason. "We knew that
we could win that ballgame. There
was no doubt in anybody's mind.
Everybody knew going into that
game that all we needed to do was
get these dudes into the fourth
quarter. Nobody had taken Oregon
into the fourth quarter."
Interestingly, there was a
chance that Stanford wouldn't
need to beat Oregon to earn a Rose
Bowl bid. If the Ducks ran the
table, they would land squarely in
the national championship game.
In that scenario, the Cardinal prob
ably could make it to the Rose Bowl
Game by losing to the Ducks
but keeping the game close and
then beating UCLA the following
week. Those two game outcomes
would give the Cardinal the sec
ond-best record in the conference,
so as long as Stanford finished in
the top 14 of the BCS standings, it
would be eligible to fill in for Ore
gon as the Pac-12's representative
in the Rose Bowl Game. But that
path was not an option in the
minds of the Cardinal players. They
didn't just want to sneak into the
Rose Bowl; they wanted to beat

Oregon on the road and win the
Pac-12 North.
"We wanted to make a state
ment that game," said senior inside
linebacker A.J. Tarpley. "We didn't
have the season we had wanted to
up to that point, but we knew we
still had our destination. We could
go wherever we wanted. If we won
out we were going to go to the Pac
-12 Championship, and that was
what we had our eyes set on."
ESPN's College Game Day
crew, a crowd of 58,792 at Autzen
and nearly 6.5 million TV viewers
turned their attention toward the
showdown between the two Pac
-12 heavyweights. A bleak day filled
with pockets of rain turned into a
cold, wet night as kickoff drew clos
er. Minutes before the game began,
the rain relented and Oregon's pub
lic address announcer proclaimed,
"It never rains at Autzen Stadium."
Seconds later, the downpour re
sumed.
