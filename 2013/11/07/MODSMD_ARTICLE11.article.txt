### â€“ Michael Peterson 
2010
STANFORD 31, OREGON 52: in the
first ever matchup where both sides were ranked,
No. 9 Stanford traveled to Autzen Stadium to face
No. 4 Oregon in a battle of 4-0 teams. After jump
ing to an early 21-3 lead in the first quarter thanks
to touchdown runs by quarterback Andrew Luck
'l2 and running back Stepfan Taylor 'l3, Stanford
was outscored 49-10 the rest of the way, scoring
zero second-half points, en route to a 52-31 Ore
gon victory. The Ducks rushed for 388 yards, be
hind 257 from running back LaMichael James
alone, and put up 626 yards of total offense.
Stanford finished with 518 yards of total offense,
but turnovers and trouble stopping the Ducks
qave the Cardinal its first loss.
2011
STANFORD 30, DREGON 53: It was all
Oregon in 2011 as the No. 7 Ducks trounced the
previously unbeaten No. 4 Cardinal in Stanford
Stadium, leading from wire-to-wire in a 53-30 vic
tory. With College Game Day making its first visit
to the Farm, a wet field resulted in players on
both sides slipping and sliding, but Oregon main
tained its footing the best and capitalized on
Stanford's inability to move on the wet field with
three offensive touchdowns of 40-plus yards. Al
though Stanford matched Oregon with 385 yards
of total offense to the Ducks' 387 yards, five
turnovers (three fumbles and two Luck intercep
tions) doomed the Cardinal. Stanford only trailed
22-16 at halftime but again was dramatically
outscored in the second half.
2012
STANFORD 17, OREGON 14 (OT):
Despite being a 21-point underdog, No. 13 Stanford
shocked No. 2 Oregon 17-14 in overtime at Autzen,
knocking the Ducks out of the BCS title picture.
While the previous two years' contests were charac
terized by potent offenses, Stanford's defense domi
nated this day, holding Oregon to 198 rushing yards
and 14 points. It was the only game in which Ore
gon would score fewer than 35 points all season.
Then-sophomore quarterback Kevin Hogan threw a
game-tying touchdown to tight end Zach Ertz 'l3
with just over a minute left in the fourth quarter to
cap a 78-yard drive and force overtime. Then-junior
kicker Jordan Williamson was the hero, delivering a
game-winning 37-yard field goal.
