### WHAT TO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
The game of the year has fi
nally arrived. Unfortunate
ly, only one of the two
teams held up its end of
the bargain in going unde
feated up to this point, and that has
pretty seriously detracted from the
hype around this matchup.
There is still plenty to play for
tonight, obviously, but one can only
wonder what today would have
been like if Stanford could have tak
en care of business in Salt Lake City
a month ago. Alas, we move on
now, to the keys of tonight's game.
The way to beat Oregon is sim
ply to not make mistakes. This goes
from fundamentals like tackling and
pursuit defense to more Oregon
specific duties like making sure you
are lined up in time to defend the
hurry-up offense.

I believe that there is some fi
nite number of mistakes that a team
can endure and still beat the Ducks.
These can be distributed between
offense, defense and special teams,
but they can't be very high in num
ber. Last year, Stanford tested that
limit with turnovers, a bad incom
pletion on fourth down, a missed
short field goal and one missed tack
le that led to the long run by Oregon
quarterback Marcus Mariota. Only
because it played almost perfectly in
every other way was the Cardinal
able to prevail â€”in overtime, no
less.

That brings me to the first key
of the game: limiting offensive mis
takes. Last year, Stanford's defense
and special teams were so good that
Stanford survived ridiculous offen-

sive inefficiency. There was
one stretch where the Cardi
nal went scoreless on 10 con
secutive possessions, yet Stan
ford somehow still prevailed.
With the injuries on
Stanford's defensive line, the
Cardinal defense probably
won't be able to hold off the
Ducks for that long of a
stretch this time around. Jun
ior quarterback Kevin Hogan
is going to have to orches
trate long drives on a consis
tent basis and put up points
at a solid rate. Otherwise, the
defense will have to be flaw
less again, and I think that is
just too much to ask two
years in a row against such an
explosive offense.
The key on the defensive
side of the ball for the Cardi
nal is going to be finding the

perfect balance between
playing the best players and
keeping starters healthy on
the defensive line.

As I mentioned earlier,
Stanford's defensive line is
banged up. Head coach David
Shaw said earlier this week
that, ideally, he would like to
rotate six to seven guys on
the defensive line when go
ing against the Ducks. With
fifth-year senior defensive
end Ben Gardner out for the
season, sophomore nose
tackle Ikenna Nwafor out for
the foreseeable future and
sophomore defensive end Az
iz Shittu seemingly falling out
of favor more and more each
week, the Cardinal needs to
replace three of its preseason
top-six linemen.

It sounds like senior de
fensive end Henry Anderson
will play, which is a much
needed boost, but how many
snaps he can play for is still to
be seen. New converts to the

defensive line in senior Blake
Lueders and sophomore Luke
Kaumatule will have to play a
significant amount of time. If
they slip up, even on just a
few plays, Oregon could
strike for a lot of points and
never look back. If Shaw
plays the starters too long,
they might be too fatigued to
be effective in crunch time,
and Oregon could pull away.
Beating one of the best
teams in the country takes
near perfection. We're hours
away from seeing if Stanford
can pull it off for a second
consecutive year, and those
keys may be the difference.

Sam Fisher is ready to jump in
on the Cardinal defensive line
if Coach Shaw makes the call
up to the press box. Remind
Sam how to play his old high
school position at
