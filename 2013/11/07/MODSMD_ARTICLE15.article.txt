# The
						Cardinal has come a long way from the bottom

Last year's seniors were the first in Stan
ford history to go to four straight bowl
games. In a day and age where bowl
games are almost a formality, it's hard to
imagine how this achievement would
have taken so long.

Palo Alto is no football wasteland: Talent has
always been here four number-one draft
picks, 13 conference titles, and 30 consensus All-

Americans to Oregon's
five. But for the longest
time it seemed that
Stanford oscillated be
tween the gates of his
tory and the gates of
hell.
In regards to Stan
ford's rise, little more

needs to be said. The Cardinal is in its fourth
straight season of national championship con
tention, and yet every year pundits insist that
Stanford needs to win and win big in order to
maintain its relevance in the college football
sphere as though the Cardinal cannot possi
bly sustain greatness. But while success can nev
er be taken for granted, at this point excellence
can be reasonably expected. This excellence

not greatness but consistency â€”is what Stan
ford fans are getting used to. This is what Oregon
is getting used to as well.
I don't resent great programs such as Notre
Dame or Alabama that retain their auras of
grandeur even in their darkest moments. They
are expected to be great, year after year; as the
saying goes, bluebloods should never rebuild but
simply reload. These programs have set the stan
dard, and Stanford will always aim to better it, to
continually raise the bar. The Cardinal is well on
its way.

Tonight's game is in no way, shape or form a
reckoning for the Stanford football program. In
the long run, nothing Stanford can do tonight,
win or lose, can undo what so many players and
coaches have taken years to build. Its achieve
ment is clear. I feel confident that Stanford foot
ball will still be great even if the Cardinal lose to
Oregon tonight.
But that's not enough, is it? Stanford "bows
to no program." Head coach David Shaw has
