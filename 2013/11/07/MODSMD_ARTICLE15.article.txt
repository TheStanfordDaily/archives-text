# The 						Cardinal has come a long way from the bottom
## 
### Winston Shi 
Last year's seniors were the first in Stan
ford history to go to four straight bowl
games. In a day and age where bowl
games are almost a formality, it's hard to
imagine how this achievement would
have taken so long.

Palo Alto is no football wasteland: Talent has
always been here four number-one draft
picks, 13 conference titles, and 30 consensus All-

Americans to Oregon's
five. But for the longest
time it seemed that
Stanford oscillated be
tween the gates of his
tory and the gates of
hell.
In regards to Stan
ford's rise, little more

needs to be said. The Cardinal is in its fourth
straight season of national championship con
tention, and yet every year pundits insist that
Stanford needs to win and win big in order to
maintain its relevance in the college football
sphere as though the Cardinal cannot possi
bly sustain greatness. But while success can nev
er be taken for granted, at this point excellence
can be reasonably expected. This excellence

not greatness but consistency —is what Stan
ford fans are getting used to. This is what Oregon
is getting used to as well.
I don't resent great programs such as Notre
Dame or Alabama that retain their auras of
grandeur even in their darkest moments. They
are expected to be great, year after year; as the
saying goes, bluebloods should never rebuild but
simply reload. These programs have set the stan
dard, and Stanford will always aim to better it, to
continually raise the bar. The Cardinal is well on
its way.

Tonight's game is in no way, shape or form a
reckoning for the Stanford football program. In
the long run, nothing Stanford can do tonight,
win or lose, can undo what so many players and
coaches have taken years to build. Its achieve
ment is clear. I feel confident that Stanford foot
ball will still be great even if the Cardinal lose to
Oregon tonight.
But that's not enough, is it? Stanford "bows
to no program." Head coach David Shaw has

done plenty to establish himself as an
elite coach at this point, but in his
third season, the Cardinal has a
chance to add yet another paragraph
to its already accomplished resume.
This year's incarnation of Oregon is
perhaps the finest squad that Stan
ford has seen since its return to
prominence, and in order to win,

nothing short of perfection will be re
quired.

It's not a coincidence that Stan
ford scheduled the jersey-retirement
ceremony of John Elway 'B3 for the
Oregon game. The presence of El
way, who started for four legendary
years at Stanford yet never made a
bowl game, reminds Stanford of how
far it has come. But Elway's enshrine
ment will also remind Stanford that
every once in a while a player has a
chance to reach immortality.
The shadows of greatness past
will not save Stanford tonight. An-

drew Luck 'l2 is not walking
through that door; Stepfan Taylor' 13
is not walking through that door;
Zach Ertz 'l3 is not walking through
that door; David DeCastro 'l2 is not
walking through that door. Some
body among the Cardinal 105 will
have to step up. The spotlight of the
nation is shining on Palo Alto.
Tonight, Stanford Stadium will be
once again be consecrated as a the
ater of dreams, and tonight, once
again, the gates of history are open
wide.

to Stanford football in his room for
good luck. If you want in on bringing
some luck to the Cardinal, set up a
