## CARDINAL KEEPS UP WITH CAL 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
The No. 5 Stanford men's swimming
team showed a promising ability to hang
with No. 3 Cal, the defending NCAA run
ners-up, as it claimed victories in two of the
six tri-events in the unofficial triple-distance
meet —its final non-invitational meet of
the fall. Although the results of the meet
did not count towards either team's record,
it gave each team a chance to evaluate the
other's 2013-14 talent before the end of
the fall season.

Sophomore Tom Kremer and junior
David Nolan respectively claimed victories
in the butterfly and backstroke tri-events,
while sophomore Ryan Arata, senior Mason
Shaw and freshmen Max Williamson and
Justin Buck all contributed second-place fin-

ishes.

In the triple-distance meet format,
each of the swimmers was assigned to one
of six tri-events —butterfly, backstroke,
breaststroke, sprint freestyle, distance
freestyle and individual medley (IM) and
swam three different distances; these times
were summed to give the swimmer's total
for the tri-event. In this way, each of the
swimmers was tested in his ability to not
only swim quickly over shorter distances,
but also in his ability to maintain endurance
through longer races.
Although Kremer was only the third
fastest sprinter in the 50-yard butterfly
(22.45) and finished second in the 100-yard
event (49.55), his strong first-place per
formance in the 200-yard butterfly, with a
time of 1:47.64, was enough to carry him
over Cal freshman Long Gutierrez with a
cumulative time of 2:59.64.

Nolan, meanwhile, was dominant

throughout the backstroke tri-event in
which he competed, coming in first in both
the 50-yard (22.60) and 200-yard (1:49.29)
events while being out-touched by only
four-hundredths of a second in the 100-
yard event (50.26) for a total time of
3:02.15 and a 1.3-second victory over Ara
ta, the second-place finisher in the tri
event. Senior Will Gunderson also swam a
solid time as the Cardinal swept the top
three spots in the event.
The Cardinal's one more significant
weakness was shown to be in the sprint
freestyle tri-event, in which none of its
swimmers finished in the top three. Junior
Thomas Stephens was top among Stan
ford's swimmers with his cumulative time
of 2:46.60, but that time was ultimately
more than three seconds off of the lead.
