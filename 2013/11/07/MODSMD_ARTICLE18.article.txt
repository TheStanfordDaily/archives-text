# Women's soccer drops last regular season game to Cal
## 
### â€“ Ashley Westhem 
For the first time since 2006, the Stanford
women's soccer team lost to Cal at home, falling 1-0 in
overtime on senior night last night. After not losing a
home game since 2007, the Card has come up short
four times on Cagan this season.
In its regular-season finale, the Card (13-5-1, 6-5-
0 Pac-12) lost to the Golden Bears (11-4-5, 4-4-3) after
Rachel Mercik scored in the 98th minute of play on a
header when freshman goalie Jane Campbell was
caught out of position.
It was a physical game as two Cal players were yel
low-carded, and the Card dominated the Golden Bears
with 27 shots to Cal's 11, but it couldn't outlast its op
ponent in the end.
