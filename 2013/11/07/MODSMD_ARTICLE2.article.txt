## Phil Knight talks Stanford-Oregon game PREDICTS DUCKS TO WIN BY ONE 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The man credited with the renais
sance of Oregon football is Nike co
founder and chairman Phil Knight M.B.A
'62, who has contributed $3OO million to
the University of Oregon and its athletic
programs over the past 20 years and
helped the school develop its "University
of Nike" image. He even has his own lock
er in the Ducks' new Football Perform
ance Center, which Knight paid an esti
mated $6B million to construct.
But Knight, who was once named
"the most powerful man in sports" by
"The Sporting News," also shares a strong
connection to Stanford, who will be bat

tling the Ducks in a top-five college foot
ball matchup tonight.

According to Knight, the inspiration
for Nike came from running track at the
University of Oregon and its business plan
came out of his time at the Stanford Grad
uate School of Business (GSB).
"I've always felt that I owe a lot to
both, and when I got in a position to be
able to make ... contributions, a lot of it
has gone to Oregon athletics and a lot of
it has gone to the Graduate School of Busi
ness at Stanford," Knight said. "I have
huge affection for both schools."
Despite Knight's affinity for the both
universities, there is no question which
football team is his number one: the
Ducks.

"I wore the Oregon jersey in track for
four years and that's become my favorite
athletic team," Knight said.

Despite being the major benefactor of Oregon Ducks football, Phil Knight M.B.A. '62,
pictured above speaking at a GSB event, has maintained his connection to Stanford.
While Knight's financial sup
port for Oregon football is well doc
umented, his donations to Stanford
have been most notable on the aca
demic side. In 2006, Knight gave an
unprecedented $lO5 million for
the construction of the Knight
Management Center at the Stan
ford GSB, where the dean is titled
the Philip H. Knight professor.
However, he has also made
contributions to the Stanford De
partment of Athletics.

"Our sports medicine center,
located within the athletic depart
ment, is named for Phil and Pene
lope Knight and the support they
have shown for our student-ath
letes is outstanding," said Stanford
associate athletic director and foot
ball director of operations Matt
Doyle in a statement to The Daily.
Knight confirmed that he hasn't
given any personal money directly to
the Stanford football program, but
he noted that the team bears the
Nike brand, an association of which
Knight said he was "very proud."
Knight added that he was hap
py to see the success of both teams
over the past few years, even as

Oregon and Stanford have become
each other's biggest competition
and biggest hurdles on the path
to a national championship.
"It's always been a big game
and an emotional game [between
the teams]," Knight said. "It's nice
to see them both at the top of the
Pac-12 Conference and right now
both [are one of] the top six teams
in the nation."

Knight is particularly effusive
in his praise of Stanford football
head coach David Shaw.

"Nike has a relationship with
the Stanford football program and
we know David and Kori Shaw and
think they're two of the best people

on Earth," Knight said. "Stanford
has a really good football coach."
Knight said he tries to attend as
many college football games as pos
sible each year, even if the Ducks
aren't playing. He attended the
Stanford-Washington game on Oct.
5, and he said that he would be go
ing down to Tuscaloosa, Ala., for the
matchup between Louisiana State
and Alabama on Saturday, Nov. 9.

Given the stakes of the
matchup and his connections to
both teams, Knight will certainly be
at the stadium tonight, although he
is circumspect about where he will
be sitting.
"I'm going to kind of hide,"

Knight joked, but he added that
Stanford is one of the friendlier sta
diums he visits.

"It's funny, because ... I go into
Corvallis for Oregon State, I get spit
on, and I get a lot of catcalls at
Washington State and Washington
as well, but Stanford has always
been okay," Knight said.
And his prediction for the out
come?

"I think it could probably go ei
ther way," he said, "but since I'm
rooting for Oregon, I'll predict Ore
gon a one-point win."
