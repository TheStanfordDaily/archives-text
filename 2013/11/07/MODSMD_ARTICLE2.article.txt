## Phil Knight talks Stanford-Oregon game PREDICTS DUCKS TO WIN BY ONE 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The man credited with the renais
sance of Oregon football is Nike co
founder and chairman Phil Knight M.B.A
'62, who has contributed $3OO million to
the University of Oregon and its athletic
programs over the past 20 years and
helped the school develop its "University
of Nike" image. He even has his own lock
er in the Ducks' new Football Perform
ance Center, which Knight paid an esti
mated $6B million to construct.
But Knight, who was once named
"the most powerful man in sports" by
"The Sporting News," also shares a strong
connection to Stanford, who will be bat

tling the Ducks in a top-five college foot
ball matchup tonight.

According to Knight, the inspiration
for Nike came from running track at the
University of Oregon and its business plan
came out of his time at the Stanford Grad
uate School of Business (GSB).
"I've always felt that I owe a lot to
both, and when I got in a position to be
able to make ... contributions, a lot of it
has gone to Oregon athletics and a lot of
it has gone to the Graduate School of Busi
ness at Stanford," Knight said. "I have
huge affection for both schools."
Despite Knight's affinity for the both
universities, there is no question which
football team is his number one: the
Ducks.

"I wore the Oregon jersey in track for
four years and that's become my favorite
athletic team," Knight said.
