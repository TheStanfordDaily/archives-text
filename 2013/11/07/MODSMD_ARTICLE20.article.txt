## "Ender's Game" fails to live up to namesake 
### CALEB SMITH 
Director Gavin Hood's "Ender's
Game," inspired by the novel of the
same name by Orson Scott Card, is a
stunning reaffirmation of the old
adage that movie adaptations are
worse than the literature on which
they are based. Although the movie
has some definite strengths, "Ender's
Game" is at best a so-so film likely to
disappoint anyone with more than
anemic expectations.
For those unfamiliar with Card's
plot, "Ender's Game" is a post-apoca
lyptic military drama set in the future.
Following an almost-victorious inva
sion of Earth by insect-like aliens, the
humans' International Fleet starts
training children to protect Earth

from the alien threat. Ender Wiggins
(Asa Butterfield) is selected to join the
elite training program called the Bat
tle School. Under the supervision of
Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford), Ender
and a group of other children learn
about military strategy and practice
fighting each other in a series of zero
gravity war games. As the time for a
decisive battle against the aliens
draws near, Ender must prepare him
self for both military and personal bat
tles if he wants to succeed.

Sadly, Hood is unable to prove vic
torious in his own battle: making a good
movie. For instance, a lot of the nu
ances (and one huge subplot) in the
book get cut out of the film; the main
plot points in the book are included,
but the audience is often left with in
comprehensible distractions; and, even
worse, the anti-war messages of the
movie come off weak or convoluted.

The acting in "Ender's Game" is
erratic, as only a few main characters
are given much opportunity to be
come more than one-dimensional.
Butterfield gives a solid performance
as the inwardly tortured Ender, but he
does not display the charisma or ener
gy that would elevate his perform
ance to exceptionality. A well-casted
Ford delivers his reliably gritty portray
al of a by-any-means-necessary Battle
School commander, but his perform

ance is disappointing for an actor of
his ability. Fortunately, Ben Kingsley
succeeds as military genius Mazer
Rackham, and Hailee Steinfeld plays
Ender's friend Petra with notable skill.
Most of the supporting actors, how
ever, are reduced to pleasant scenery.
Two mild exceptions are Abigail Bres
lin, who plays Ender's sister Valen
tine, and Viola Davis, who capably
portrays Graff's empathetic deputy
Major Anderson.
Although the adaptation of
Card's book is rather mediocre, the
special effects and combat sequences
add a level of entertainment value
that prevents this film from being a
total dud. The fight sequences, espe
cially in the zero gravity war games,
are visually exciting. The larger battle
sequences near the end provide a
thrilling spectacular, and the movie
features good computer animation.
Donald McAlpine's cinematography
is both creative and invigorating.
On the whole, Ender's Game is
a mildly entertaining sci-fi film that
fails its source material. Although it
may be worth seeing if no worthier
options exist, potential viewers would
probably be better off looking for fun
on campus.

Ben Kingsley, Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield star in Gavin Hood's adaptation of "Ender's Game," Orson Scott
Card's wildly popular novel. Although Ford and others try, good acting is unable to save the poor script.
