## A 						list of common questions posed by freshmen new to the Farm 
### ANDREW VOGELEY 
Like all freshmen everywhere,
the Class of 2017 and I came
in believing we had all the
answers, but soon found out
that we knew next to noth
ing about college. A month
and a half later, I think most of us
still have questions about Stanford.
What follows are some that came
up frequently when I conducted a
brief poll of some of my peers
(apologies for the Wilbur-centric
worldview):

1) Where is FroSoCo?

Admittedly, this is not a question
every freshman has, because I've
been told that some freshmen do
indeed live in FroSoCo. But I can't
be positive because I've never
been. Stanford needs to introduce
a cross-campus exchange program.
I felt like I had been to the other
side of the world when I had break
fast at Lakeside.

2) Why is there no water in
Lake Lag?

While I must admit that Stanford
was upfront about the fact that
Lake Lag has no water, that doesn't
change the fact that I'm deeply dis
appointed it remains empty. Just
think of the possibilities of having a
lake on campus. We need to make
this happen. I'm sure we can get
some rich alum to pay for the lake
to be refilled I even have a par
ticular one in mind. Which leads
me to my next question ...

3) Who is John Arrillaga, and

how does he have so much
money?

I don't even know how many build
ings have his name on them, but it
seems it's, like, every other one.
It's actually quite impressive how
generous he has been to the Uni
versity. I'm also grateful that the
food in his dining hall is better than
the food in Wilbur (in my humble
opinion).

4) How do professors expect us
to take midterms on tiny pull
out desks or lapboards?

I should have realized this was go
ing to be issue on day one of a class
held in an auditorium. But it wasn't
until I walked into my first-ever
Stanford midterm that I realized I
was not going to be able to take the
exam on an actual desk. Writing es
says on a 12-square-inch, awkward
ly angled piece of wood is bad
enough. Writing essays hunched
over a lapboard is even worse.

5) Where is the best food on
campus?

This is the most important ques
tion, in my opinion, because it is
the one that has the biggest impact
on me on a daily basis. I actually
care what the answer to this ques
tion is. So, wise upperclassmen,
please enlighten me as to where I
can find the best food on campus.

Give Andrew directions to Ricker
Dining in the mythical FroSoCo, or
shoot him the answers to any of this
other questions at avogelegy@stan
