# Fashion Spotlight Interview Attire

### LAYNIE STEPHENS FASHION COLUMNIST 
I ave an important interview coming up
but no idea what to wear? We've all
LJ been there before. Interviews are all
about making a good impression, and,
whether you like it or not, you will be
I judged based on what you're wearing.
Don't want to spend the hour before your inter
view agonizing over what to wear? Have no fear:
Laynie is here!

1. The "I-swear-it's-casual" interview:

Ladies, consider wearing dark-wash or black
skinny or straight-fit denim, and make sure those
jeans fit properly (a.k.a. not too tight, not too
baggy). For tops, I would recommend a cardigan
and a sleeveless top made from a material that's
not cotton. Add some flats or nice-looking boots,
and you're good to go.
Guys, consider dark-wash or black denim as
well. For your shirt, I'd recommend a polo shirt
or ironed, casual button-down. For shoes, loafers
would be best, but at least make sure the shoes
you ultimately decide to wear are not dirty.
2. The business casual interview:

Ladies, if you insist on wearing black denim
and a nice top, at least add a blazer and some
statement jewelry or a scarf. Flats or heeled
booties would complete this look best. However,
I recommend throwing on a dress over pants.
Wear a solid color dress that is not too short or
too revealing with a blazer and some jewelry,
and you'll look great! Also consider lace it's
feminine and unique. The best shoes are flats or
wedges; just stay away from sandals.
Guys, I'd recommend khaki, navy or black
chinos with a button down that is, once again,
ironed. Tuck your shirt in, wear a belt and defi
nitely wear loafers or casual dress shoes. Stay
away from jeans.
3. The formal interview: This one seems pret
ty self-explanatory: dresses or suits for women,
