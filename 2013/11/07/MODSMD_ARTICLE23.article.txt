# Fashion Spotlight Interview Attire
## 
### LAYNIE STEPHENS FASHION COLUMNIST 
I ave an important interview coming up
but no idea what to wear? We've all
LJ been there before. Interviews are all
about making a good impression, and,
whether you like it or not, you will be
I judged based on what you're wearing.
Don't want to spend the hour before your inter
view agonizing over what to wear? Have no fear:
Laynie is here!

1. The "I-swear-it's-casual" interview:

Ladies, consider wearing dark-wash or black
skinny or straight-fit denim, and make sure those
jeans fit properly (a.k.a. not too tight, not too
baggy). For tops, I would recommend a cardigan
and a sleeveless top made from a material that's
not cotton. Add some flats or nice-looking boots,
and you're good to go.
Guys, consider dark-wash or black denim as
well. For your shirt, I'd recommend a polo shirt
or ironed, casual button-down. For shoes, loafers
would be best, but at least make sure the shoes
you ultimately decide to wear are not dirty.
2. The business casual interview:

Ladies, if you insist on wearing black denim
and a nice top, at least add a blazer and some
statement jewelry or a scarf. Flats or heeled
booties would complete this look best. However,
I recommend throwing on a dress over pants.
Wear a solid color dress that is not too short or
too revealing with a blazer and some jewelry,
and you'll look great! Also consider lace it's
feminine and unique. The best shoes are flats or
wedges; just stay away from sandals.
Guys, I'd recommend khaki, navy or black
chinos with a button down that is, once again,
ironed. Tuck your shirt in, wear a belt and defi
nitely wear loafers or casual dress shoes. Stay
away from jeans.
3. The formal interview: This one seems pret
ty self-explanatory: dresses or suits for women,
suits and ties for men. But the
biggest problem seems to always be
fit, especially for women.
Ladies, let's take a minute to
talk about dress pants. Your black
dress pants should NOT look like
lounge or yoga pants. This effect is
often created when the pants are
too loose or too tight. It may take
trying on 20 pairs of dress pants be
fore you find the right one, but trust

me, they're out there. Do not settle
when it comes to dress pants
and if you just can't seem to find the
right pair, you should definitely get a
pair custom altered. Make sure they
fit in the thigh and are streamlined
in a straight line down to the toe,
with an ironed crease in the front.
And please make sure the top with
those pants is dressy as well ei
ther a button-down blouse or a top
made from a very nice material.
Dresses are definitely my favorite
option for formal wear. Just please
make sure they're not too short
try to keep it at two inches above

the knee, maximum.
Guys, this one's pretty self-ex
planatory: Suit, tie and dress shoes.
And now is not the time to show off
that random crazy-patterned tie
you've kept around.
Follow these steps for inter
view attire, and you're on your way
to getting the job! In summary,
dressing too formal is always better
than not dressing formally enough,
and make sure that whatever you're
wearing is appropriate.
