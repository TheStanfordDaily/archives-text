# 11th Annual San Francisco International South Asian Film Festival
## Films showcase South Asian experience 
### ISHA SALIAN 
There is more to Indian films than
Bollywood drama and dance num
bers, as evidenced by the 11 th An
nual San Francisco International
South Asian Film Festival. A med
ley of documentaries, independ
ent films and art films will be showcased
both in San Francisco and locally in Palo
Alto. Four films three documentaries
and one drama will play in Palo Alto on
Nov. 16 at the Aquarius Theatre. Arts &
Life presents capsule reviews of three of
them.

"Gulabi Gang"
The documentary "Gulabi Gang," di
rected by Nishtha Jain, follows a group of
Indian women, the self-named Gulabi
Gang, who fight against social injustice,
particularly the oppression of women, in

rural India. The documentary explores
extreme violence against women, politi
cal corruption and poverty in order to in
crease awareness of the issues faced by
the community and convey a strong mes
sage of empowerment.

"Without Shepherds"
This documentary provides a snapshot
into the political and social world of Pak
istan through the lives of a cricketer-turned
politician, a journalist, a supermodel, a
truck driver, a musician and a former Tal
iban soldier. Though this film provides a
new insight into the intricate social balance
of Pakistan and the various lifestyles of its
citizens, it is overly ambitious: The six sto
ries have little in common with each other
besides the common backdrop of Pakistan,
which makes it difficult to jump from one
to the other in each scene. Those with a
keen interest in the political scene of Pak

istan will enjoy this film, but it will not leave
a strong impression on the casual viewer.

"Beyond Boundaries"
My personal favorite of the three
documentaries, "Beyond Boundaries"
weaves together four stories about a cen
tral aspect of South Asian culture: the
game of cricket. The film, directed by
Sushrut Jain, truly captures the way crick
et unites South Asians from all walks of
life. From a young cricket prodigy to a dis
advantaged teenage girl, and from the In
dian national team to its biggest fan, this
sport is an integral part of daily life.
The film festival is showing in Palo Al
to on Nov. 16 at Aquarius Theater. Tickets
are $lO online at thirdi.org and $l2 at the
door.
