# FARM-GROWN ART
## Anderson Collection will honor the Stanford Arts Initiative 
### MARY CAROLE OVERHOLT 
As I bike down Palm Drive, away from the classical, Spanish
buildings of campus, I can't help but feel a sense of passing
time as I am drawn into the Anderson Collection at Stanford's
world of modernity. This building will stand as an emblem of
the Stanford Arts Initiative, described by Director of the Ander
son Collection at Stanford Jason Linetzky as a movement to
"heighten everybody's awareness of the arts on campus." Its location
next to the Cantor Art Center is crucial to this initiative. In the words of
the David Lenox, the University architect and director of campus plan
ning and design, it all comes down to one thing: "creating synergies in
unique areas of campus."
