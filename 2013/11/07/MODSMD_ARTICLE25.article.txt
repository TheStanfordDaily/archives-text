# FARM-GROWN ART
## Anderson Collection will honor the Stanford Arts Initiative 
### MARY CAROLE OVERHOLT 
As I bike down Palm Drive, away from the classical, Spanish
buildings of campus, I can't help but feel a sense of passing
time as I am drawn into the Anderson Collection at Stanford's
world of modernity. This building will stand as an emblem of
the Stanford Arts Initiative, described by Director of the Ander
son Collection at Stanford Jason Linetzky as a movement to
"heighten everybody's awareness of the arts on campus." Its location
next to the Cantor Art Center is crucial to this initiative. In the words of
the David Lenox, the University architect and director of campus plan
ning and design, it all comes down to one thing: "creating synergies in
unique areas of campus."

In approaching the task of cre
ating the Anderson Collection build
ing, New York City-based firm En
nead Architects took extensive care
to create a building that honored
both Stanford University's vision of
an art district on campus and the in
tegrity of the collection itself. Accord
ing to Timothy Hartung, founding
partner and managing principal in En
nead Architects, the firm immediate
ly established that the Anderson Col
lection "deserved a building that rep
resented its own time and current or
future time, not a building that was
anchored into the past."
At a sizable 13,000 square feet,
the new building has an open plan,
inspired by the home of the collec
tion donors, a ranch-style, mid-cen
tury structure, which served as a
temporary museum for the collec
tion prior to the donation. In mov
ing the pieces from the intimate set
ting of a home to a commercial set
ting of a museum, Hartung com
ments on the firm's central desire to
properly interpret how the Ander
sons "hung and related to the art."
Upon entering the building, vis
itors will immediately understand
the building's commitment to the
academic ideals of Stanford Univer
sity. The first floor will house a li
brary, a resource center and lecture
halls. Then, a short, one-story climb
up the grand staircase takes the vis

itor to the gallery space for the An
derson Collection. With undulating
ceilings, the top floor creates wall
spaces short, tall, narrow, and
wide that correspond with the
dimensions of pieces by artists like
Jackson Pollock and William de
Kooning. "Moving through the
space you would see hints, kind of
like a tease, of what was around the
other corner," Hartung explained.
Along with innovative planning,
Ennead Architects made use of in
novative lighting technology. A
clerestory serves as a dominant
source of natural light, but it is the
control of this light that sets the
building apart, a technology that, ac
cording to Hartung, "senses when
it's cloudy, when it's dark, when it's
bright." These sensors, positioned
on different walls, maintain a prede
termined influx of light into the
gallery, regardless the time of day.
These sensors can even be manually

controlled to create varied light set
tings.

From the open plan to the inno
vative manipulation of light, the An
derson Collection at Stanford builds
upon the spirit of modernity set by
the neighboring Bing Concert Hall
and McMurty Building for Art and Art
History. In this developing home for
arts on campus, modern architecture
serves as a unique lens through
which students and visitors can bet
ter understand both the pieces be
fore them and the rapidly evolving
domain of the arts.

Though still covered in red
tape, the Anderson Collection at
Stanford exudes a composite energy
of art and architecture that has the
power to beguile both the Stanford
community and communities be
yond the Farm.
