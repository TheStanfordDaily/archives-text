## NEXT FALL at San Jose Rep 
### NOEMI BERKOWITZ 
I ow do we reconcile our sexuality with our faith?
I That is the question at the heart of "Next Fall,"
LJ a play by Geoffrey Nauffts that opened its Bay
I Area premiere run Wednesday at San Jose
I Repertory Theatre. The play begins in a hospital
I room, with Holly (Lindsey Gates) chatting nerv
ously with Brandon (Ryan Tasker). Soon, Arlene (Rachel
Harker) enters, jabbering away about her chihuahua. We
meet Butch (James Carpenter), Arlene's ex-husband, a
quiet man by contrast to Arlene's ongoing chatter. As an
audience, we spend about the next 20 minutes trying
to figure out who these people are and why they're all
together here. It's confusing for a little while, and Gates
portrays Holly's quirks through a too over-the-top per
formance that doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the
cast, especially Tasker's and Carpenter's more subtly af
fecting performances. Still, we don't know why we
should relate to these characters, or even how they re
late to each other.

It isn't until Adam (Dannie Scheie) enters that the
plot really begins to pick up. We learn that Arlene and
Butch's son Luke (Adam Shonkwiler) are in the hospital,
although we don't really know exactly what happened,
and that he and Adam have been dating for about five
years but his parents don't know that. Oh, and by
the way: Luke is also a devout Christian.
This is where the play's big questions lie. The first
act's strengths lie in its flashback scenes between Luke
and Adam. After the play's slow start, the audience is
eager to learn more details about all of these characters
and see this Luke that everyone has been talking about.
In a post-one-night-stand breakfast scene, in which a
scantily clad Luke gives thanks for his meal before eat
ing, we learn that he is a Christian who believes having
sex with men is a sin, despite the fact that he himself
does it.

As Luke and Adam progress from one-night stand
to dating, we see this issue constantly cause arguments
and tension in their relationship. Shonkwiler does a
stellar job portraying this complex character whose
lifestyle and beliefs are seemingly at odds, and Scheie
elicits huge laughs from the audience as the older, neu

rotic Adam. Their age difference seems wider than the
1 Oish years the play claims it is, but this is easily over
looked due to their great chemistry, from playful back
and-forth bantering to tension-filled arguments.
The second act is really where the play hits hard
emotionally. Harker does an incredible job with Arlene's
monologue about her comatose son, dropping her
fagade of cheery chatter to reveal the guilt and heart
break underneath. Carpenter's Butch gives a solid, stoic
performance throughout, never wavering from his be
liefs. Scheie shows us that he can not only play funny
but can truthfully reveal the utter sorrow that Adam
feels. It is a relentless and powerful act, with one
poignant and distressing scene after another. By the end,
the audience can fully relate to these characters, despite
their flaws, and our hearts break for them.
By raising intellectual questions and creating gut
wrenching emotional moments, this play is sure to make
a memorable night at the theater. Tickets can be pur
chased at http://www.sjrep.com/ and 50-percent-off dis
counts are available for all fulltime students and people
30 years old and younger.
