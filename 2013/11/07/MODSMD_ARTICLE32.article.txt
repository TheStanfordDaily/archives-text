# Roxy Sass: Roxy's Pigskin Playbook
## 
### ROXY SASS 
With campus all hyped up about the Oregon
game tonight, most writers are currently focused
on strategy and statistics. But Roxy would like to
take this opportunity to highlight some of her fa
vorite things about football.

1) Number one, and most importantly: the
tailgating. Roxy is very thankful that Stanford got
it together this year and is throwing some awe
some student tailgates, complete with burgers
and beer games. But bear in mind: Just because
the kick-off isn't for another two hours doesn't
mean you can't sneak away from the dance party
to start scoring.

2) Sculpted glutes. Though Roxy's preferred
football position has always been wide receiver,
she knows how to appreciate a tight end. But the
party's not only in the backfield ... boys, feel free
to take off your jockstrap after the game. Roxy will
support you.

3) Dancing to "All Right Now." After a Stanford
touchdown, the free hugs and high fives are the
perfect chance to get up close and personal with
the cute boy standing next to you in the stands.
Too bad there isn't any space under the bleachers
... no one says you can't score your own touch
down while everyone else is trying (and failing) to
figure out LSJMB's halftime show.

4) Shayne Skov. Don't think we haven't noticed
you hanging out at the Daily office recently...
Roxy thought 2012 was her last chance to get
Luck-y, but if you want to practice your tackles,
she promises she won't fumble. Go long Roxy
will follow.

5) After parties at KA. Go get laid. Roxy's out of
football puns.

Just kidding, Roxy's never out of puns. Hit her up at
life@stanforddaily.com and give her some pointers
on how to handle the ball.
