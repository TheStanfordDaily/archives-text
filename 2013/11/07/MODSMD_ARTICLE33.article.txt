# Film Review
## Thor flick barely satisfies 
### MELISSA GORDON 
"Thor: The Dark World,"
the highly anticipated sequel to
"Thor" (2011) and the latest in
stallment in Marvel's "The
Avengers" (2012) franchise,
brings some of our favorite com
ic book characters back to the
big screen but does it hold up
to standards as a stand-alone su
perhero film? While the film is
certainly an action-packed visual
feast, this sequel threatens to
disappoint dedicated Marvel
fans due to the critical setback of
a subpar screenplay.
The plot is standard fare: an
ancient source of malevolent
power reenters the world,
reawakening a Dark Elf named
Malekith (Christopher Eccleston)
who threatens to cast the Nine
Realms, including Asgard and
Earth, into eternal darkness. As
this power source coincidentally
enters Jane Foster (Natalie Port
man), Thor (Chris Hemsworth)
must join forces with his maniacal
brother, Loki, (Tom Hiddleston) so
that Thor can save Earth... and
Asgard... and his love interest.
Unfortunately, "Thor: The
Dark World" fails to live up to the
imaginative quality for which the
Marvel film franchise is known.
It resorts to yawn-worthy cliches,
plot holes that are a mile wide
and dialogue so bland that the
characters lose their agency.
Why is the villain a two-dimen
sional character that wants to
take over the world for no partic
ular reason with a power source
that is given no context whatso
ever? Are we really supposed to
believe that Jane would find the
one wormhole that leads to a
possessive evil power by coinci
dence? And how do Dark Elves
possess guns after being asleep

for thousands of years?
Oddly enough, the script
eventually comes back with a val
or that makes it easy for the audi
ence to forget the terrible blight
of the first hour. The characters
become more engaging and the
plot is saved by richer dialogue,
well-timed jokes, and unpre
dictable action. It is almost as if
the first half was written by
someone who had no idea what
they were doing —which may in
fact be the case. It was reported
that the screenplay was so bad at
one point that director Alan Tay
lor requested to have Joss Whe
don (of "The Avengers" fame and
co-director of the original
"Thor") to be flown in "like a
SWAT team" to help rewrite se
lect scenes in the screenplay. Too
bad he didn't rewrite the entire
screenplay.
Ultimately, "Thor: The Dark
World" is a film with both a dark
and a light side. Does the film
succeed as a stand-alone piece of
cinema? No, not really. Should
fans of "Thor" and "The
Avengers" still go to see this
film? Yes, probably. It is wonder
ful to see these characters on the
big screen again, but my sugges
tion is to wait out the first hour
and hope that the Marvel fran
chise learns from these rookie
mistakes. Dedicated Marvel
fans will also be pleased by the
surprise ending, and, as always,
do not forget to stay for the af
ter-credits scenes that hint at an
incredible storyline for the al
ready confirmed "Thor 3."

"Thor: The Dark World"
opens in theaters on Nov. 8,
2013.
