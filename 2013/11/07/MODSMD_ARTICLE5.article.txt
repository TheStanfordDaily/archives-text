## Nov. 7,2009: The day Stanford football arrived 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
The nascent Stanford-Oregon rivalry
has been marked primarily by its
last three installments, each of
them between a pair of top-15
teams that would both eventually
end up playing in BCS bowls. But there's an
other recent Cardinal-Ducks showdown that
foreshadowed the two programs' rise, and
like tonight's game, it was played at Stanford
Stadium on a Nov. 7.

That 51-42 Stanford win in 2009, which
clinched the team's first bowl berth in eight
years, resonates deeply with recent Cardinal
football alums; tailback Toby Gerhart 'lO has
referred to it as the moment when Stanford
football truly "arrived," while quarterback An
drew Luck 'l2 has called it "as close to a per

Several current Cardinal players and
coaches including then-freshmen running
back Tyler Gaffney and linebacker Shayne
Skov were also on hand for the upset,
which marked Stanford's last home win
against its perennial Pac-12 rival.

victory," remembered head coach David
Shaw, Stanford's offensive coordinator in
2009, "but that was a fun one."

Fond memories aren't all the Cardinal

held Oregon to just 14 points last season,
there's a good chance that the always-improv
ing Ducks offense will have more success this
time around, leaving a bit more of the burden
to the Cardinal's own offensive attack.
And when unranked Stanford won its
shootout against No. 7 Oregon in 2009, it did
so with a physical running game, an oppor
tunistic passing attack and a solid special
teams performance exactly the offensive
formula the Cardinal will have to follow
tonight.

Stanford came into the 2009 game feel
ing that it had to score on every possession to
keep up with the quick-strike Ducks, and
though the Cardinal's offense has often
lacked that consistency this season, it still
feels the same pressure.
"That's the feeling when you play a good
