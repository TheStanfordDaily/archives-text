# NO ROOM FOR ERROR
## Nov. 7,2009: The day Stanford football arrived 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
The nascent Stanford-Oregon rivalry
has been marked primarily by its
last three installments, each of
them between a pair of top-15
teams that would both eventually
end up playing in BCS bowls. But there's an
other recent Cardinal-Ducks showdown that
foreshadowed the two programs' rise, and
like tonight's game, it was played at Stanford
Stadium on a Nov. 7.

That 51-42 Stanford win in 2009, which
clinched the team's first bowl berth in eight
years, resonates deeply with recent Cardinal
football alums; tailback Toby Gerhart 'lO has
referred to it as the moment when Stanford
football truly "arrived," while quarterback An
drew Luck 'l2 has called it "as close to a per
fect game as we played offensively in my ca
reer."

Several current Cardinal players and
coaches including then-freshmen running
back Tyler Gaffney and linebacker Shayne
Skov were also on hand for the upset,
which marked Stanford's last home win
against its perennial Pac-12 rival.
"I have the same euphoria after every
victory," remembered head coach David
Shaw, Stanford's offensive coordinator in
2009, "but that was a fun one."

Fond memories aren't all the Cardinal
can take from the 2009 win. Though Stanford

held Oregon to just 14 points last season,
there's a good chance that the always-improv
ing Ducks offense will have more success this
time around, leaving a bit more of the burden
to the Cardinal's own offensive attack.
And when unranked Stanford won its
shootout against No. 7 Oregon in 2009, it did
so with a physical running game, an oppor
tunistic passing attack and a solid special
teams performance exactly the offensive
formula the Cardinal will have to follow
tonight.

Stanford came into the 2009 game feel
ing that it had to score on every possession to
keep up with the quick-strike Ducks, and
though the Cardinal's offense has often
lacked that consistency this season, it still
feels the same pressure.
"That's the feeling when you play a good

team, especially a team with an offense like
theirs," said running backs coach Tavita
Pritchard, who was Luck's backup as a fifth
year senior in 2009. "You have to execute.
You have to make plays when they're there to
be made."

"There's no room for error against Ore
gon," Gaffney noted.
Stanford nearly found that out the hard
way in 2009. After the Cardinal jumped out
to a 24-7 first-half lead, cornerback Kris Evans
'O9 forced a red-zone fumble to halt a prom
ising Ducks drive, but on the very next play,
Gerhart fumbled it right back to Oregon. One
snap later, the Ducks made it 24-14, setting

the tone for a back-and-forth game.
Oregon kept on scoring, but Stanford
matched every Ducks blow, with Gerhart pil
ing up 223 yards and Luck throwing for 251
on just 20 attempts.

Stanford was able to extend its lead to
48-28 early in the fourth quarter, but the
Ducks still battled back, sandwiching a Cardi
nal missed field goal with two long touch
down drives that narrowed the Stanford ad
vantage to just six in the final minutes. The
Cardinal recovered the ensuing onside kick,
however, and sealed the win with a late field
goal.

"I think just to see two fast-paced offen
sive teams take advantage and never give up;
it was a good opening to college football my
freshman year," Gaffney said. "It makes you
excited for the rest of your career... I was a
freshman, just watching a Heisman candi-

date, Toby Gerhart, run his ass off."
The Cardinal might need Gaffney to do
the same thing tonight if it wants to beat Ore
gon, but in four fateful years, the matchup's
flavor has changed somewhat. Stanford's of
fense probably doesn't need to put up 51
points its defense has improved by leaps
and bounds since 2009; but more important
ly, a win wouldn't put the Cardinal on the col
lege football landscape. It would reassert

Stanford's place among the elite.
"It feels different because we've won
around here and we've made that a habit, you
know, and now it's about maintaining that,"
Pritchard said. "I think back [in 2009] ... we
were both trying to find our own ways as a
program, and trying to find our character, our
themes. And I think we're pretty well in
grained. We're always trying to evolve and get
better, but I think we are somewhat set, and
I think it is a matchup of two really good pro
grams and two differing styles in one way.
"But it's two similar styles in that they're
two programs that want to do everything at a
high, high level, all the time. And I think
that's why it's going to be a great football
game."

That 51-42 Stanford win in 2009, which
clinched the team's first bowl berth in eight
years, resonates deeply with recent Cardinal
football alums; tailback Toby Gerhart 'lO has
referred to it as the moment when Stanford
football truly "arrived," while quarterback An
drew Luck 'l2 has called it "as close to a per
fect game as we played offensively in my ca
reer."

Several current Cardinal players and
coaches including then-freshmen running
back Tyler Gaffney and linebacker Shayne
Skov were also on hand for the upset,
which marked Stanford's last home win
against its perennial Pac-12 rival.
"I have the same euphoria after every
victory," remembered head coach David
Shaw, Stanford's offensive coordinator in
2009, "but that was a fun one."

Fond memories aren't all the Cardinal
can take from the 2009 win. Though Stanford

held Oregon to just 14 points last season,
there's a good chance that the always-improv
ing Ducks offense will have more success this
time around, leaving a bit more of the burden
to the Cardinal's own offensive attack.
And when unranked Stanford won its
shootout against No. 7 Oregon in 2009, it did
so with a physical running game, an oppor
tunistic passing attack and a solid special
teams performance exactly the offensive
formula the Cardinal will have to follow
tonight.

Stanford came into the 2009 game feel
ing that it had to score on every possession to
keep up with the quick-strike Ducks, and
though the Cardinal's offense has often
lacked that consistency this season, it still
feels the same pressure.
"That's the feeling when you play a good

team, especially a team with an offense like
theirs," said running backs coach Tavita
Pritchard, who was Luck's backup as a fifth
year senior in 2009. "You have to execute.
You have to make plays when they're there to
be made."

"There's no room for error against Ore
gon," Gaffney noted.
Stanford nearly found that out the hard
way in 2009. After the Cardinal jumped out
to a 24-7 first-half lead, cornerback Kris Evans
'O9 forced a red-zone fumble to halt a prom
ising Ducks drive, but on the very next play,
Gerhart fumbled it right back to Oregon. One
snap later, the Ducks made it 24-14, setting

the tone for a back-and-forth game.
Oregon kept on scoring, but Stanford
matched every Ducks blow, with Gerhart pil
ing up 223 yards and Luck throwing for 251
on just 20 attempts.

Stanford was able to extend its lead to
48-28 early in the fourth quarter, but the
Ducks still battled back, sandwiching a Cardi
nal missed field goal with two long touch
down drives that narrowed the Stanford ad
vantage to just six in the final minutes. The
Cardinal recovered the ensuing onside kick,
however, and sealed the win with a late field
goal.

"I think just to see two fast-paced offen
sive teams take advantage and never give up;
it was a good opening to college football my
freshman year," Gaffney said. "It makes you
excited for the rest of your career... I was a
freshman, just watching a Heisman candi-

date, Toby Gerhart, run his ass off."
The Cardinal might need Gaffney to do
the same thing tonight if it wants to beat Ore
gon, but in four fateful years, the matchup's
flavor has changed somewhat. Stanford's of
fense probably doesn't need to put up 51
points its defense has improved by leaps
and bounds since 2009; but more important
ly, a win wouldn't put the Cardinal on the col
lege football landscape. It would reassert

Stanford's place among the elite.
"It feels different because we've won
around here and we've made that a habit, you
know, and now it's about maintaining that,"
Pritchard said. "I think back [in 2009] ... we
were both trying to find our own ways as a
program, and trying to find our character, our
themes. And I think we're pretty well in
grained. We're always trying to evolve and get
better, but I think we are somewhat set, and
I think it is a matchup of two really good pro
grams and two differing styles in one way.
"But it's two similar styles in that they're
two programs that want to do everything at a
high, high level, all the time. And I think
that's why it's going to be a great football
game."
