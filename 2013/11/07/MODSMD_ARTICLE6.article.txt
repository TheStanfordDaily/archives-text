## FOOTBALL FIGHT FOR THE PAC- 12 Oregon looks for revenge 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
The wait is over. Nov. 7 has finally ar
rived.
Tonight, the No. 5 Cardinal (7-1, 5-1
Pac-12) will once again be an underdog
against the high-flying No. 3 Ducks (8-0, 5-
0) on its own turf, but this time, the stakes
are higher, the lights brighter. The two Pac
-12 heavyweights will look to keep their con
ference and national title hopes alive as they
collide at Stanford Stadium, tonight's epi
center of college football nation.
"The campus is excited," said senior
safety Ed Reynolds. "They realize what this
game means to the program and school."
The BCS implications surrounding the
game are obvious, but plenty of storylines
fuel the hype. The loser of the last three
contests between the two teams would
have most likely gone to the national cham
pionship had it not lost. And while the
Ducks have won nine of the last 11 meet
ings they've scored at least 50 points in
four of the last six meetings it was Stan
ford who used one of the best defensive
performances in college football history to
derail Oregon's national title aspirations last
season.

"I wouldn't say that we found the key
to unlock [Oregon's] offense," said head
coach David Shaw. "We played really well.
It's not just scheme. You got tremendous effort
from really good players, guys who played hard
and well together. That's what it takes."
If the Cardinal wants to repeat its epic defen
sive performance and disprove running back
De' Anthony Thomas' assertion that Oregon
should score at least 40 points it will have to
contain quarterback Marcus Mariota for the sec
ond year in a row. The Heisman Trophy frontrun
ner, Mariota has completed 64 percent of his pass
es for 2,281 yards and 20 touchdowns and boasts
an adjusted quarterback rating of 94.9. The junior
star has yet to throw an interception in his eight
games this season, something that sophomore
cornerback Alex Carter said the Cardinal defense
needs to change.
"[Mariota] has such a calm about him, even
when he's getting pressured. He's just a more ma
ture version of the really good quarterback [he
was] last year," Shaw said. "The closest guy to him
I've seen is [49ers quarterback] Colin Kaepernick:
so big, so fast, so athletic, so in command."
The warp-speed Ducks offense as a whole
hasn't skipped a beat either. Under first-year head
coach Mark Helfrich, Oregon is ranked second in

the nation in scoring offense (55.6 points per
game), total offense (632.1 yards per game) and
rushing offense (331.50 yards per game). Running
backs Byron Marshall and Thomas have picked up
right where Kenjon Barner left off last year, while
the speedy wide receiver tandem of Josh Huff and
Bralon Addison has allowed Oregon to have a
greater downfield passing threat this year.
On the heels of two dominant showings
against explosive UCLA and Oregon State offens
es, the Cardinal defense understands the tall or
der it faces against the lightening-paced Ducks.
But the unit enters tonight's game with a similar
mentality that it took into Autzen Stadium last
year: Take Oregon into the fourth quarter.
"[Defensive coordinator Derek] Mason put
great emphasis on taking [Oregon] into deep wa
ter," Reynolds said. "You're not going to be able to
beat this team if you don't take them into the
fourth quarter. For us, it's about making sure we
play sound defensive football to where we can
help the [Stanford] offense out, give them as
many possessions as we can and put them in short
fields."

The Cardinal offense will need plenty of help
tonight if it plays the way it did in the month of
October. Against Oregon State two weekends
ago, the inconsistent offense was unable to sus
tain drives and was out-possessed by the Beavers
by nearly 17 minutes in spite of the fact that the
Cardinal prides itself on controlling the clock.

The best unit that Stanford's offense has
faced all season, the Ducks defense leads the
Pac-12 in points per game (16.9) and yards per
play (3.31). Senior running back Tyler Gaffney
will be looking for his sixth 100-yard rushing
game of the year, but it won't be easy against a
physical Ducks front that features the 6-foot-8,
296-pound defensive tackle Arik Armstead.
Meanwhile, junior quarterback Kevin Hogan will
have to play much better than his 88-yard per
formance in his last game to give his team a
chance at pulling off the upset, against one of the
best secondary units in the nation led by corner
back Ifo Ikpre-Olomu.
"The one guy that, in my opinion, stands out
is the defensive coordinator," Shaw said. "Nobody
talks about Nick Aliotti. You talk about [Oregon's]
offense and the points, but they can't do what
they do if the defense doesn't play the way the de
fense plays."
On the injury front, senior defensive end
Henry Anderson, senior kicker Jordan Williamson
and junior wide receiver Devon Cajuste are all ex
pected to play in some capacity.
Stanford and Oregon battle for Pac-12 North
supremacy tonight, with kickoff slated for 6 p.m.
and national television coverage on ESPN.

by nearly 17 minutes in spite of the fact that the
Cardinal prides itself on controlling the clock.

The best unit that Stanford's offense has
faced all season, the Ducks defense leads the
Pac-12 in points per game (16.9) and yards per
play (3.31). Senior running back Tyler Gaffney
will be looking for his sixth 100-yard rushing
game of the year, but it won't be easy against a
physical Ducks front that features the 6-foot-8,
296-pound defensive tackle Arik Armstead.
Meanwhile, junior quarterback Kevin Hogan will
have to play much better than his 88-yard per
formance in his last game to give his team a
chance at pulling off the upset, against one of the
best secondary units in the nation led by corner
back Ifo Ikpre-Olomu.
"The one guy that, in my opinion, stands out
is the defensive coordinator," Shaw said. "Nobody
talks about Nick Aliotti. You talk about [Oregon's]
offense and the points, but they can't do what
they do if the defense doesn't play the way the de
fense plays."
On the injury front, senior defensive end
Henry Anderson, senior kicker Jordan Williamson
and junior wide receiver Devon Cajuste are all ex
pected to play in some capacity.
Stanford and Oregon battle for Pac-12 North
supremacy tonight, with kickoff slated for 6 p.m.
and national television coverage on ESPN.

The wait is over. Nov. 7 has finally ar
rived.
Tonight, the No. 5 Cardinal (7-1, 5-1
Pac-12) will once again be an underdog
against the high-flying No. 3 Ducks (8-0, 5-
0) on its own turf, but this time, the stakes
are higher, the lights brighter. The two Pac
-12 heavyweights will look to keep their con
ference and national title hopes alive as they
collide at Stanford Stadium, tonight's epi
center of college football nation.
"The campus is excited," said senior
safety Ed Reynolds. "They realize what this
game means to the program and school."
The BCS implications surrounding the
game are obvious, but plenty of storylines
fuel the hype. The loser of the last three
contests between the two teams would
have most likely gone to the national cham
pionship had it not lost. And while the
Ducks have won nine of the last 11 meet
ings they've scored at least 50 points in
four of the last six meetings it was Stan
ford who used one of the best defensive
performances in college football history to
derail Oregon's national title aspirations last
season.

"I wouldn't say that we found the key
to unlock [Oregon's] offense," said head
coach David Shaw. "We played really well.
It's not just scheme. You got tremendous effort
from really good players, guys who played hard
and well together. That's what it takes."
If the Cardinal wants to repeat its epic defen
sive performance and disprove running back
De' Anthony Thomas' assertion that Oregon
should score at least 40 points it will have to
contain quarterback Marcus Mariota for the sec
ond year in a row. The Heisman Trophy frontrun
ner, Mariota has completed 64 percent of his pass
es for 2,281 yards and 20 touchdowns and boasts
an adjusted quarterback rating of 94.9. The junior
star has yet to throw an interception in his eight
games this season, something that sophomore
cornerback Alex Carter said the Cardinal defense
needs to change.
"[Mariota] has such a calm about him, even
when he's getting pressured. He's just a more ma
ture version of the really good quarterback [he
was] last year," Shaw said. "The closest guy to him
I've seen is [49ers quarterback] Colin Kaepernick:
so big, so fast, so athletic, so in command."
The warp-speed Ducks offense as a whole
hasn't skipped a beat either. Under first-year head
coach Mark Helfrich, Oregon is ranked second in

the nation in scoring offense (55.6 points per
game), total offense (632.1 yards per game) and
rushing offense (331.50 yards per game). Running
backs Byron Marshall and Thomas have picked up
right where Kenjon Barner left off last year, while
the speedy wide receiver tandem of Josh Huff and
Bralon Addison has allowed Oregon to have a
greater downfield passing threat this year.
On the heels of two dominant showings
against explosive UCLA and Oregon State offens
es, the Cardinal defense understands the tall or
der it faces against the lightening-paced Ducks.
But the unit enters tonight's game with a similar
mentality that it took into Autzen Stadium last
year: Take Oregon into the fourth quarter.
"[Defensive coordinator Derek] Mason put
great emphasis on taking [Oregon] into deep wa
ter," Reynolds said. "You're not going to be able to
beat this team if you don't take them into the
fourth quarter. For us, it's about making sure we
play sound defensive football to where we can
help the [Stanford] offense out, give them as
many possessions as we can and put them in short
fields."

The Cardinal offense will need plenty of help
tonight if it plays the way it did in the month of
October. Against Oregon State two weekends
ago, the inconsistent offense was unable to sus
tain drives and was out-possessed by the Beavers
by nearly 17 minutes in spite of the fact that the
Cardinal prides itself on controlling the clock.

The best unit that Stanford's offense has
faced all season, the Ducks defense leads the
