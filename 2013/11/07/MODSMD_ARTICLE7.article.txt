## OPINIONS The 						Disenchanted Russia 
### Chi Ling Chan 
Two months into my study abroad here
in Moscow, I have this to say: Russia is
a depressing place, even if there is
and I admit there is beauty in its melan
choly. On rainy days, when gloom and
doom is the order of the day, I can almost
taste the dolefulness that hangs in the air.
The further one goes from its capital
Moscow, the more depressing it gets a
point made with great poignancy by a re
cent New York Times feature titled "The
Russia Left Behind." Signs of physical decay
all around seem too eager to remind one of
the profound political and social decay that
Russia is going through. It is as if the sun
has left for another planet.

And if Russians are one of the most
pessimistic and disenchanted people in the
world, they have reasons to be. Few peo
ples in the world can be said to have expe
rienced a history as dramatic and traumatic
as the Russians'. For every generation since
1917, the only constant has been change:
not incremental, gradual changes, but sea
changes that continually sent the country
down topsy-turvy vortexes.

First there was the October Revolution
in 1917, which promised colossal changes

meant to shift Russia's autocratic paradigm
to a liberal parliamentary system. Alas, that
was hijacked by another form of autocracy
in the shape of communist despotism.
When the myth of the communists'
messianic mission evaporated, tectonic pol
icy shifts through Gorbachev's Glasnost
and Perestroika sought to put Russia on a
new path to modernization. But then came
1991: the Soviet Union collapsed like a
house of cards, and the Communist project
was pronounced dead.

Boris Yeltsin staged a coup shortly af
ter, and this time an anti-communist revo
lution took Russia by storm, promising
democratic and economic reforms. For a
moment Russia looked primed to set off on
its own path to modernity, democracy and
free markets, but instead of prosperity and
freedom the Russians got economic melt
down, crime and ethnic strife.
The pendulum swung between autoc
racy and liberal reforms as revolutions upon
revolutions put the Russians on a seesaw of
hope and disillusionment. Reforms gave

tion of autocracy.

All that seems to be left now is a sense
of disenchantment, summed up disgruntled
ly by ex-Prime Minister Viktor Cher
nomyrdin: "We tried better, but it went the
usual way." Everything has changed, but
nothing has changed.
Except, perhaps, the people's appetite
for change. "Don't talk to Russians about
change or revolution," a Russian friend told
me. "They are sick and tired of it. People
want evolution, not revolution." But the
"evolution" that the Russians so desire is not
going to happen on its own. As with any so
cial and political changes, incremental im
provements can only be realized with
painstaking persistence and a healthy dose of
idealism. But judging from the political apa
thy manifest in low turnout rates in the re
cent Moscow mayor election and the sore

lack of new political contesters, the younger
generation has almost neither.
The general attitude of the populous is
to "wait and see," which, unfortunately, is
probably the only smart thing to do. "There
is no way you can get to any political position
of importance without playing dirty," my
friend reminded me. "Every level of the sys
tem reeks with rank corruption, and it is so
hard to break in because it is an absolutely
closed system."
In Russia, it is almost impossible to en
ter into the political game unless you are al
ready part of the existing power structure.
Attempting to challenge the system from the
outside is like running up to a concrete wall
and bashing your head against it a point
less and dangerous venture. Change, it ap
pears, has to wait.
But for how long? Four attempts to save
Russia from decay have failed, and a lot of
time has been lost. The rich are leaving for
better places, and the less well-off stay put be
cause they can't afford to leave.
Social mobility continues to decline and
is on its way to proving a point about post-so
cialist societies that initial accumulation
of capital is also final. Seeing little incentives
to change the status quo, the Russian oli
garchs continue to sit comfortably on Russia's
oil wealth, overlooking a glamorous decay.
Each morning, on my commute, I come
across this portrait I now consider to be dis
tinctively Russian: potholes on the roads, slabs
of concrete lying about on unkempt earth,
open construction sites from which clouds of
dust rises up with each passing of an old rick
ety Lada, chipped tessellations on the exteri
ors of apartments worn off by a combination
of age and negligence.
At the academy where I study, an entire
skyscraper stands despondently upon a waste
land with no past glory to speak of, for it had
been abandoned before it was even com
pleted. Yet despite all the profound decay
and general gloominess, there are days
when the sun peers through the thick cloud
cover to cast a silver lining, bestowing upon
Moscow a gorgeous radiance.
Perhaps Russia's silver lining, too, lies in
wait beneath the depressing cover of rank
corruption. One thing, however, is quite
certain: If Russia were to succeed in lifting
itself out its slow road to ruin, it would have
done that in spite of its government, and
not because of it.

Two months into my study abroad here
in Moscow, I have this to say: Russia is
a depressing place, even if there is
and I admit there is beauty in its melan
choly. On rainy days, when gloom and
doom is the order of the day, I can almost
taste the dolefulness that hangs in the air.
The further one goes from its capital
Moscow, the more depressing it gets a
point made with great poignancy by a re
cent New York Times feature titled "The
Russia Left Behind." Signs of physical decay
all around seem too eager to remind one of
the profound political and social decay that
Russia is going through. It is as if the sun
has left for another planet.

And if Russians are one of the most
pessimistic and disenchanted people in the
world, they have reasons to be. Few peo
ples in the world can be said to have expe
rienced a history as dramatic and traumatic
as the Russians'. For every generation since
1917, the only constant has been change:
not incremental, gradual changes, but sea
changes that continually sent the country
down topsy-turvy vortexes.

First there was the October Revolution
in 1917, which promised colossal changes

meant to shift Russia's autocratic paradigm
to a liberal parliamentary system. Alas, that
was hijacked by another form of autocracy
in the shape of communist despotism.
When the myth of the communists'
messianic mission evaporated, tectonic pol
icy shifts through Gorbachev's Glasnost
and Perestroika sought to put Russia on a
new path to modernization. But then came
1991: the Soviet Union collapsed like a
house of cards, and the Communist project
was pronounced dead.

Boris Yeltsin staged a coup shortly af
ter, and this time an anti-communist revo
lution took Russia by storm, promising
democratic and economic reforms. For a
moment Russia looked primed to set off on
its own path to modernity, democracy and
free markets, but instead of prosperity and
freedom the Russians got economic melt
down, crime and ethnic strife.
The pendulum swung between autoc
racy and liberal reforms as revolutions upon
revolutions put the Russians on a seesaw of
hope and disillusionment. Reforms gave
way, time and again, to the resurgent tradi

tion of autocracy.

All that seems to be left now is a sense
of disenchantment, summed up disgruntled
ly by ex-Prime Minister Viktor Cher
nomyrdin: "We tried better, but it went the
usual way." Everything has changed, but
nothing has changed.
Except, perhaps, the people's appetite
for change. "Don't talk to Russians about
change or revolution," a Russian friend told
me. "They are sick and tired of it. People
want evolution, not revolution." But the
"evolution" that the Russians so desire is not
going to happen on its own. As with any so
cial and political changes, incremental im
provements can only be realized with
painstaking persistence and a healthy dose of
idealism. But judging from the political apa
thy manifest in low turnout rates in the re
cent Moscow mayor election and the sore

lack of new political contesters, the younger
generation has almost neither.
The general attitude of the populous is
to "wait and see," which, unfortunately, is
probably the only smart thing to do. "There
is no way you can get to any political position
of importance without playing dirty," my
friend reminded me. "Every level of the sys
tem reeks with rank corruption, and it is so
hard to break in because it is an absolutely
closed system."
