Two months into my study abroad here
in Moscow, I have this to say: Russia is
a depressing place, even if there is
and I admit there is beauty in its melan
choly. On rainy days, when gloom and
doom is the order of the day, I can almost
taste the dolefulness that hangs in the air.
The further one goes from its capital
Moscow, the more depressing it gets a
point made with great poignancy by a re
cent New York Times feature titled "The
Russia Left Behind." Signs of physical decay
all around seem too eager to remind one of
the profound political and social decay that
Russia is going through. It is as if the sun

And if Russians are one of the most
pessimistic and disenchanted people in the

1991: the Soviet Union collapsed like a
house of cards, and the Communist project
was pronounced dead.

Boris Yeltsin staged a coup shortly af
ter, and this time an anti-communist revo

democratic and economic reforms. For a
moment Russia looked primed to set off on
its own path to modernity, democracy and
free markets, but instead of prosperity and
freedom the Russians got economic melt
down, crime and ethnic strife.
The pendulum swung between autoc
racy and liberal reforms as revolutions upon
revolutions put the Russians on a seesaw of
hope and disillusionment. Reforms gave
