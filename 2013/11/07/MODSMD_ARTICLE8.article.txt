# BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DAILY EMERALD
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Thursday's football
game between Stanford and Ore
gon, The Daily's David Cohn chat
ted with Hayden Kim, senior
sports reporter for The Daily
Emerald, Oregon's student news
paper, to get perspective from both
camps on how the Cardinal could
beat the Ducks. Below is a partial
transcript of their conversation.
For a more complete transcript of
their back-and-forth, or yester
day's piece on how Oregon could
beat Stanford, go to www.stanford
daily.com!category/sports.

David Cohn (DC): What is your first
impression of the Cardinal's season so
far?

Hayden Kim (HK): The Cardinal has

looked impressive this year. I buy that
Stanford is a top-10 team, but in my
view, it isn't as good as it was last year.
After losing Zach Ertz 'l2 and other
key players, Kevin Hogan's numbers
are down, and I believe that is largely
due to losing those players.

DC: I am wondering how Oregon, as a
program, as well as its fans, view last
year's contest in the context of Thurs
day's game. Was last year an anomaly
in their eyes, or is Stanford seen as a
legitimate threat to the Ducks?

HK: Oregon as a team is fully confi
dent that it will be improve upon its
performance from last year. While
Stanford poses threats on the defen
sive end with a good front along with
linebacker Shayne Skov, the Ducks feel
like they will play much better on both
sides of the ball.

In regards to the fans, I still be

lieve that they are fully aware of what
kind of threat the Cardinal poses, and
in that context they will be skeptical of
the outcome until the game is over.

DC: What are your feelings on the
Oregon offensive line this season, and
its ability to contain the defensive pres
sure that will undoubtedly come from
Stanford?

HK: I think the line has done surpris
ingly well this season. There has to be
some credit given to the offensive line
for Mariota's success this year. Hroniss
Grasu is currently the top-rated center
in the country and in addition, players
like Tyler Johnstone and Hamani
Stevens have held their own against
some of the better defensive lines in
the country in Tennessee (which has
multiple NFL prospects) and UCLA.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Fifth-year senior inside linebacker Shayne Skov (second from left) poses a threat for Oregon's talented backs on the
Cardinal's defensive side. Skov will play against Oregon with a clean bill of health for the first time since the 2010 season.
So, in regards to how the Ducks will react to
the Cardinal defensive line, I think it will be
the biggest test of the year for the offensive
line specifically. While the aforementioned
teams have helped strengthen the offensive
line as a unit, the Cardinal and Skov will un
doubtedly pose a physically defense that
could well force Mariota's first interception
of the season.

DC: Let's turn to Stanford's offense and Ore
gon's defense. The Stanford offensive line
has imposed its will on pretty much every op
ponent so far, and coaches in the Pac-12 have
said that the Ducks defensive line is a con
cern. What are your thoughts?

HK: While the Cardinal offensive line has
been on point this season, the Oregon defen

sive line has been one of the more underrat
ed portions of the Oregon defense. Wade Ke
liikipi and Ricky Havili-Heimuli have been
solid throughout the season. Having said
that, I can't necessarily defend against the ar
gument that the Ducks defense has been its
most subject area as a whole. That will be the
biggest key for the game and at this moment
in time, it will remain as a question mark un
til proven otherwise.

DC: The third area in which Stanford may
have a significant advantage is special teams.
As Stanford fans already saw against a solid
team in Washington, the Cardinal can over
come an inconsistent offensive performance
by Kevin Hogan and still win. Ty Mont
gomery is a threat for a touchdown return
every time he touches the ball. In addition,

Stanford is hoping Jordan Williamson will re
turn for Thursday's game, and Williamson is
significantly better than either Alejandro
Maldonado or Matt Wogan.

HK: In regards to special teams, I definitely
feel Stanford has the advantage. As you well
know, the game down to a couple kicks
down the stretch last season. If anything,
that is the biggest concern heading into the
game for Ducks fans: If the game comes
down to a kick, will the Ducks prevail or not?

DC: Do you have a prediction for the game?

HK: Oregon wins 35-24.
