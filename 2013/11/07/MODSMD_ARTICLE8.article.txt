# BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DAILY EMERALD
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Thursday's football
game between Stanford and Ore
gon, The Daily's David Cohn chat
ted with Hayden Kim, senior
sports reporter for The Daily
Emerald, Oregon's student news
paper, to get perspective from both
camps on how the Cardinal could
beat the Ducks. Below is a partial
transcript of their conversation.
For a more complete transcript of
their back-and-forth, or yester
day's piece on how Oregon could
beat Stanford, go to www.stanford
daily.com!category/sports.

David Cohn (DC): What is your first
impression of the Cardinal's season so
far?

Hayden Kim (HK): The Cardinal has

looked impressive this year. I buy that
Stanford is a top-10 team, but in my
view, it isn't as good as it was last year.
After losing Zach Ertz 'l2 and other
key players, Kevin Hogan's numbers
are down, and I believe that is largely
due to losing those players.

DC: I am wondering how Oregon, as a
program, as well as its fans, view last
year's contest in the context of Thurs
day's game. Was last year an anomaly
in their eyes, or is Stanford seen as a
legitimate threat to the Ducks?

HK: Oregon as a team is fully confi
dent that it will be improve upon its
performance from last year. While
Stanford poses threats on the defen
sive end with a good front along with
linebacker Shayne Skov, the Ducks feel
like they will play much better on both
sides of the ball.

In regards to the fans, I still be

lieve that they are fully aware of what
kind of threat the Cardinal poses, and
in that context they will be skeptical of
the outcome until the game is over.

DC: What are your feelings on the
Oregon offensive line this season, and
its ability to contain the defensive pres
sure that will undoubtedly come from
Stanford?

HK: I think the line has done surpris
ingly well this season. There has to be
some credit given to the offensive line
for Mariota's success this year. Hroniss
Grasu is currently the top-rated center
in the country and in addition, players
like Tyler Johnstone and Hamani
Stevens have held their own against
some of the better defensive lines in
the country in Tennessee (which has
multiple NFL prospects) and UCLA.

Fifth-year senior inside linebacker Shayne Skov (second from left) poses a threat for Oregon's talented backs on the
Cardinal's defensive side. Skov will play against Oregon with a clean bill of health for the first time since the 2010 season.
