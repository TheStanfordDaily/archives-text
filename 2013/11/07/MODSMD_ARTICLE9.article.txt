GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 17, OREGON 35: I just don't see
Stanford beating Oregon today. Yes, the Cardinal defense
took big steps by returning to its dominant 2012 form in its
last two games, but the offense has taken just as many
steps backwards. Ty Montgomery should prove to be a
good challenge for the elite Ducks secondary, but name
one other player that provides matchup problems for the
Ducks defense. Montgomery alone won't be enough to pre
vent the Ducks from keying on stopping the Cardinal's run
ning game. Expect Stanford's defense to hold Oregon to 14
points in the first half, but a couple Cardinal turnovers after
halftime will allow the Ducks to pull away. Marcus Mariota is
too good, and I just have this feeling that this is Oregon's
year. After being thwarted by the Cardinal last season, the
Ducks won't let their national title hopes slip away again.
SAM FISHER
STANFORD 31, OREGON 28: When I first sat
down to write this pick, I took the Ducks by 11. Stanford's
offense just hasn't looked good enough to beat the Ducks
over the past few weeks, and fifth-year senior defensive
end Ben Gardner's injury is going to be very hard to over
come. But then I watched highlights from Stanford's win at
Autzen last season. So many of the key players from that
victory will be on the field tonight, including Shayne Skov,
A.J. Tarpley, Henry Anderson, Trent Murphy and Kevin
Hogan. It's going to be extremely difficult to replace the pro
duction Zach Ertz '13 provided in last year's win, but I have
a funny feeling someone is going to step up. In a game
eerily reminiscent of 2012, but with a little more scoring,
Stanford wins on a late field goal and shocks the nation
again.
VLHAN LAKSHMAN
STANFORD 24, OREGON 28: My heart says
Stanford, but my gut says to go with the Ducks. Despite the
defense playing a nearly perfect game last year in Autzen
Stadium, the Cardinal still needed a few huge strokes of
good fortune to pull out the win. This time around, I don't
expect the football gods to grant the Card as many fortu
itous bounces. While I believe the Stanford offense will start
off with a bang and take an early lead as it opens up the
full playbook, this game will come down to Kevin Hogan be
ing able to convert on third-and-long to keep Mariota and
company off the field; Ifo Ekpre-Olomu and the rest of the
Ducks' secondary, however, will not allow that to happen.
Stanford will lose on a late Oregon touchdown in a game
that will live up to its billing as one of the best of the year.
