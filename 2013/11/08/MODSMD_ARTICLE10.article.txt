## OP-ED Why Care About Veterans Day? 
### 
I entertained an interesting
thought experiment the other
day: If I had been 22 years old
on 9/11, a recent graduate of Stan
ford University, would I have raised
my hand and volunteered to enlist
in the U.S. military in defense of a
nation that had just been attacked?
Abandoned my comfortable
lifestyle at a decent entry-level job?
I imagine not. And I imagine
many of us still wouldn't today. But
there were those who did and there
are those who still do. And so, for
me, next Monday carries a special
personal significance as I progress
through my senior year and reach a
point where some of my peers con
tinue to raise their hands and elect
to pursue a career defined by per
sonal sacrifice.
Monday is Veterans Day, an op
portunity to thank those men and
women who have served in the U.S.
military. It would seem, however,
that Americans, and young people
in particular, have a hard time re
lating to veterans, let alone cele
brating them, and for good reason.
Our culture today increasingly
portrays veterans as a group of
mostly conservative, uneducated,
ornery white men afflicted by a va
riety of mental illnesses and unem
ployment. While problems such as
mental illness and veteran unem
ployment are real, the stereotypes
they perpetuate do not present an
accurate illustration of the veteran
population as a whole, which is
made up of countless groups that
together are representative of the
United States; students and profes
sionals, gays and straights, immi
grants and 10th generation Ameri
cans, liberals and conservatives.
Only through meeting veterans,
both at Stanford and off campus,
can the existing misperceptions of
veteran identity be changed.
Beyond the cultural stereo
types, domestic politics have made
it even more difficult to relate to
the veteran population. The politi
cization of war has had unfortunate
spillovers into our civilian views of
veterans, as people increasingly
and erroneously place the responsi
bility for war on servicemembers

themselves, failing to dissociate the
policy maker from the public ser
vant whose only commitment is to
the defense of a country, not to a
particular figure.
As I've come to realize in the
past few years, you don't have to be
pro-war to be pro-military. And you
need not endorse a war's mission to
honor those who made sacrifices in
the course of it. Indeed, no one can
provide greater cautions about the
dangers of war than those who have
borne its personal costs. Again, on
ly through meeting members of the
veteran community can we begin to
understand their role in society and
see them not as subjects of a politi
cal debate but rather as paragons
of service.
For these reasons and more, as
civilians we must make a concerted
effort to engage our peers who are
veterans. And so, on behalf of the
Haas Center's Military Service as
Public Service Program, I would
like to invite all readers to our an
nual Veterans Day Event on Mon
day, Nov. 11 at 7 p.m. at the Clark
Center Lounge, immediately fol
lowing a talk by Prof. David
Kennedy on Stanford's colored his
tory with Reserve Officer's Train
ing Corps (ROTC), also located at
the Clark Center.
Whether this is the first time
you are cognizant of Veterans
Day's existence or you come from a
military background, I urge you to
come discover why Veterans Day is
for us all, particularly civilians.
On Memorial Day this May we
will mourn the loss of those service
members who are no longer with us
to share their stories of service.
And so on Veterans Day let us be
grateful for the ones we still have
around us, young and old, and join
in thanking them for the thankless
commitment they made however
many years ago to serve a nation,
humbly and with no ambition of
their own.
