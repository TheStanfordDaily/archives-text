# ANDREWS ASSESSMENT
## A 						Fistful of Dollars 
### McKenzie Andrews 
If you're reading this article and you went
to Stanford last year, there's a 50 percent
chance you didn't vote last year. Half of
our student body doesn't.
For those who don't follow Stanford stu
dent politics, Stanford's undergraduate Sen
ate is composed of 15 elected senators. Each
undergraduate voter has 15 votes to cast and
election winners are simply the 15 candi
dates that receive the most votes.
In recent memory, this body elected to
represent the Stanford student body is over
whelmingly composed of sophomores. Last
year, no one who was a senator ran for re
election and only one non-freshman candi
date was elected.
Each spring, there's a campaign season
where candidates run via an intense cam
paign of canvasing, endorsements and dining
hall and dorm-to-dorm conversations. The
endorsement process consists of various
Stanford student groups interviewing poten
tial candidates and giving a subset of this
group their stamp of approval. Then, said en
dorsing group will spam their email list ask
ing their community members to vote for
their endorsees.
Last year, one of the biggest endorsement
groups, the Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), endorsed 12 students, and every
one of their endorsees won a seat in the Sen
ate. Though personal campaigning gets your
name out, one of the most effective ways to
get elected is to get endorsed.
Last year, 3,420 undergraduates voted out
of a 6,678 undergraduate potential voter
pool: that's a 51.2-percent turnout. Fresh
men vote the most and election turnout gets
progressively worse as students grow older.
At the end of the spring election season, 15
students become officially elected senators.
The Senate's power comes from the
purse: They approve funding for students
groups and events on campus. The ASSU
provides funding for over 500 volunteer stu
dent organizations (aka student groups). The
secret about ASSU funding is that there's
more money available than actually gets dis
tributed to Stanford student groups just
about every year.
Because Stanford is excessively wealthy,
our student government can liberally finance
student groups. The Senate can dole out up
to $6,000 dollars per student group through
general fees, and we gave out close to $2.5
million dollars in last year's special fees.
This quarter, our current Senate is look
ing to give $50,000 dollars away in the Win
ter Grant Program, money they hope will
create new events for Stanford students dur
ing the somewhat dreary winter quarter.

Last month, the Senate passed the Senate
Innovation Fund, which allocates "$3,000 to
each elected Senator." According to the Sen
ate's Spartan Word Press website, "Senators
are 'hereby charged to spend their Innova
tion Fund to make a meaningful difference in
the undergraduate community,' meaning
that they are able to sponsor events, projects
and initiatives of individuals and groups at
their own volition." The Fund was created
last month and has an annual budget of
$52,000 dollars.
As stated on their website, "each Senator
has $3,000 in their pocket to give you, the
Student body." The Senate Innovation
Fund's page also states, "There is no funding
process each Senator is free to fund what
ever they deem is appropriate to their per
sonal or the campus' collective goals."
In effect, the Senate Innovation Fund
sounds like the Senate passed legislation to
give themselves $3,000 dollars of personal
discretionary spending. Dear senators, just
because your face stared at me whenever I
went to the bathroom in my freshman dorm
doesn't mean I consented to this amount of
money being arbitrarily allocated.
I know several of the current senators
and like them, but they certainly aren't rep
resentative of Stanford's student body:
Nearly all of them are in the Class of 2016. If
freshmen are the only students who vote, the
Senate next year will, again, consist of most
ly sophomores.
Engage in your political process, people.
Last month, the Senate essentially created a
committee to give themselves (and hopefully
us) more money. If you're interested in huge
amounts of free cash, you should meet your
representatives, figure out the bureaucracy
and apply for the funding. Involving yourself
in the process as a whole will help enforce
proper standards of accountability and make
sure that the ASSU doesn't serve as sena
tors' personal piggy banks.
