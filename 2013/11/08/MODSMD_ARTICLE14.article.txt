## TIP-OFF AT MAPLES CARD BEGINS QUEST FOR FIRST TOURNEY SINCE 2008 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball
team will open its season tonight at
home against the Bucknell Bison of
the Patriot League, as the Cardinal
looks for its fourth consecutive win in
season openers.
Stanford, which is seeking to re
turn to the NCAA tournament for
the first time since the 2007-08 sea
son, hopes to commence its noncon
ference slate with a strong showing
against a quality opponent. The Car
dinal features a roster that returns
84 percent of its minutes played from
last season and used 88 percent of
the team's offensive possessions,
most in the conference and amongst
the highest in all of Division I.
As a result, this year's team is ex
perienced, talented and deep. The
Cardinal roster includes eight sen
iors, four of them starters. The group
of veterans is led by all-Pac-12 for
ward Dwight Powell, who led the
team in scoring a season ago with
14.9 points per game and should
spend much of the season impressing
NBA scouts this year. He's long, ath
letic and skilled, and can shoot it out
to the 3-point line.
Powell will be joined in Stanford's
frontcourt by fellow seniors 6-foot-7
Josh Huestis, a preseason frontrun
ner for Pac-12 Defensive Player of
the Year, and 6-foot-ll Stefan Nastic.
Huestis, who averaged 10.5 points,
9.0 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game
last year, led the team in total re
bounding and blocked shots a season
ago and finished fourth and third in
those categories, respectively, in the
Pac-12. Nastic, who averaged 2.0
points and 1.9 rebounds in more lim
ited playing time last season, im
pressed the coaching staff enough to
earn the stalling job going into the

2013-14.
"[Nastic] has done a really good
job of being big for us, finishing well
around the basket and rebounding
the basketball," said head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "Those are some of
things he's been doing well for us
here in the fall, really finishing plays
and providing a big lift to our team."
The last of Stanford's starting
seniors is guard Anthony Brown,
who returns after missing most of
last season with a hip injury. Aver
aging better than eight points per
game for his career, Brown has
looked ready to become a big-time
contributor in the preseason, as he
scored 14 points in the team's exhi
bition win against Seattle Pacific on
Saturday. He should bring an added
scoring punch and improved
perimeter defense this season for
the Cardinal.
Rounding out the Cardinal's
starting lineup is junior guard Chas
son Randle, who was recently pro
filed by ESPN's Andy Katz as a
"man on a mission" this season. The
last player cut from this summer's
USA World University Games roster,
Randle has been phenomenal in the
preseason, including a 37-point out
burst against Seattle Pacific. He was
Stanford's leading scorer two years
ago as a freshman, and finished sec
ond behind Powell last year with an
average of 13.6 points per game. An
other step forward by Randle this
year could have big ramifications for
Stanford's prospects this season.
Stanford's bench is also full of
seniors who are ready to contribute,
particularly guard Aaron Bright and
forward John Gage.
If the names sound familial* they
should. Bright was the 2011-12 Na
tional Invitational Tournament MVP
for Stanford, led the team in assists
each of the past two seasons and has

made 54 starts in his Stanford career.
Gage, a 6-foot-10 shooter, should con
tinue to get open looks from the
perimeter this season with defenses
again concentrating on stopping
Powell and Randle.
Two other players to watch com
ing off the bench this season for the
Cardinal are freshmen: 6-foot-10
center Schuyler Rimmer and 6-foot-3
guard Marcus Allen, whose twin
brother, Malcolm, also joined the

squad this season. The freshmen will
have to step up in the absence of
Stanford's more experienced sopho
mores, Christian Sanders and Rosco
Allen. Sanders will miss the season
after undergoing hip surgery this
week, while Allen is out for four to six
weeks with a stress fracture.
Against Bucknell, the Cardinal
should focus its attention on senior
guard Cameron Ayers, who is one of
only two returning starters from last

year's 28-win team. The Bison will be
looking to replace the production of
the recently graduated Mike Mus
cala, who was last year's Patriot
League Player of the Year.
Tip-off is tonight at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion, where free t-shirts
will be given to the first 1,500 stu
dents.

against a quality opponent. The Car
dinal features a roster that returns
84 percent of its minutes played from
last season and used 88 percent of
the team's offensive possessions,
most in the conference and amongst
the highest in all of Division I.
As a result, this year's team is ex
perienced, talented and deep. The
Cardinal roster includes eight sen
iors, four of them starters. The group
of veterans is led by all-Pac-12 for
ward Dwight Powell, who led the
team in scoring a season ago with
14.9 points per game and should
spend much of the season impressing
NBA scouts this year. He's long, ath
letic and skilled, and can shoot it out
to the 3-point line.
Powell will be joined in Stanford's
frontcourt by fellow seniors 6-foot-7
Josh Huestis, a preseason frontrun
ner for Pac-12 Defensive Player of
the Year, and 6-foot-ll Stefan Nastic.
Huestis, who averaged 10.5 points,
9.0 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game
last year, led the team in total re
bounding and blocked shots a season
ago and finished fourth and third in
those categories, respectively, in the
Pac-12. Nastic, who averaged 2.0
points and 1.9 rebounds in more lim
ited playing time last season, im
pressed the coaching staff enough to
earn the stalling job going into the

2013-14.
"[Nastic] has done a really good
job of being big for us, finishing well
around the basket and rebounding
the basketball," said head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "Those are some of
things he's been doing well for us
here in the fall, really finishing plays
and providing a big lift to our team."
The last of Stanford's starting
seniors is guard Anthony Brown,
who returns after missing most of
last season with a hip injury. Aver
aging better than eight points per
game for his career, Brown has
looked ready to become a big-time
contributor in the preseason, as he
scored 14 points in the team's exhi
bition win against Seattle Pacific on
Saturday. He should bring an added
scoring punch and improved
perimeter defense this season for
the Cardinal.
Rounding out the Cardinal's
starting lineup is junior guard Chas
son Randle, who was recently pro
filed by ESPN's Andy Katz as a
"man on a mission" this season. The
last player cut from this summer's
USA World University Games roster,
Randle has been phenomenal in the
preseason, including a 37-point out
burst against Seattle Pacific. He was
Stanford's leading scorer two years
ago as a freshman, and finished sec
ond behind Powell last year with an
average of 13.6 points per game. An
other step forward by Randle this
year could have big ramifications for
Stanford's prospects this season.
Stanford's bench is also full of
seniors who are ready to contribute,
particularly guard Aaron Bright and
forward John Gage.
If the names sound familial* they
should. Bright was the 2011-12 Na
tional Invitational Tournament MVP
for Stanford, led the team in assists
each of the past two seasons and has

made 54 starts in his Stanford career.
Gage, a 6-foot-10 shooter, should con
tinue to get open looks from the
perimeter this season with defenses
again concentrating on stopping
Powell and Randle.
Two other players to watch com
ing off the bench this season for the
Cardinal are freshmen: 6-foot-10
center Schuyler Rimmer and 6-foot-3
guard Marcus Allen, whose twin
brother, Malcolm, also joined the

squad this season. The freshmen will
have to step up in the absence of
Stanford's more experienced sopho
mores, Christian Sanders and Rosco
Allen. Sanders will miss the season
after undergoing hip surgery this
week, while Allen is out for four to six
weeks with a stress fracture.
Against Bucknell, the Cardinal
should focus its attention on senior
guard Cameron Ayers, who is one of
only two returning starters from last

year's 28-win team. The Bison will be
looking to replace the production of
the recently graduated Mike Mus
cala, who was last year's Patriot
League Player of the Year.
Tip-off is tonight at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion, where free t-shirts
will be given to the first 1,500 stu
dents.

Senior forward Dwight Powell (right) is coming off an electric junior season in which he led the Cardinal in
scoring with 14.9 points per game. His class only has one more chance to take Stanford to the Big Dance.
