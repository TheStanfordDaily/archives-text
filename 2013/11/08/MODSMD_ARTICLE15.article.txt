# BUFFS THINKING UPSET
## 
### JORDAN WALLACH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Having just grinded out a four-set victory
over UCLA after a five-set marathon defeat to
No. 4 USC, the Stanford's women's volleyball
team will not get a break this weekend. The
Cardinal begins a four-match road trip tonight
against the Colorado Buffaloes in Boulder, Co
lo., where the Buffs are undefeated in five con
ference matches this season with three of
those wins coming against ranked opponents.
The No. 6 Cardinal (16-5,9-3 Pac-12), coming
off a signature win last Friday against the Bru
ins, hopes to carry its momentum into tonight's
tussle with Colorado (15-7, 7-5). A point of em
phasis for the Card over the past week has been
avoiding mental letdowns, which partially led to
the team's defeat against USC, so battling back
after losing the third set in the match against
UCLA was a point of pride for Stanford head
coach John Dunning.
Sophomore outside hitter Brittany Howard
has been one of the Cardinal standouts over re
cent weeks, as she's improved both her offen
sive and defensive performance of late. She's
averaging 3.05 kills per set and 0.95 blocks per
set over her last six matches, an improvement
over 2.85 kills per set and 0.69 blocks per set in
her 15 prior matches. Not to mention, Howard
had a team-high 12 kills and a career-high sev
en blocks in last Friday's match against UCLA.
"We did a good job of starting well, being re
ally aggressive and getting good streaks of
points," Howard said. "We know that Colorado
is a really good team on [its] home court.
There's a difference with the altitude, but we
can't focus on that. We have to know the system
that we want to play against their offense.
"We know they're very pin-dominant in their
setting game, so the key is not letting them get
streaks of points or kills early, and we want to
win the serve-and-pass game."
The last time these two teams met on Oct.
12 at Maples Pavilion Stanford dominated in
a three-set sweep, outhitting the Buffaloes .340
to .240. The Cardinal trailed just twice in the
match and was consistently able to stop Col
orado's momentum with strong defensive per
formances, particularly by junior libero Kyle
Gilbert, who had 16 digs in the match.
It was a complete team victory, as five Stan
ford players had nine or more kills. Sophomore
middle blocker Inky Ajanaku hit a match-high
.615 with nine kills and three blocks in the
match, while senior outside hitter Carly Wopat
