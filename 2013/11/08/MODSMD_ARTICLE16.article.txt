## Cardinal travels injured 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 3 Stanford women's basketball will
open regular season play this Saturday on
the road at Boston College before it
moves on to Storrs, Conn., to take on No.
1 Connecticut on Monday.
Stanford played its only exhibition
game last Sunday at Maples against Van
guard and dismantled the Lions 79-47 to
stai*t its 2013-14 campaign. Stanford is ex
pected to finish atop the Pac-12 for the
14th consecutive season in a conference
that boasts four teams in the top 25, ac
cording to ESPN's preseason poll.
In the midst of numerous injuries, the
Card will have to look to new players for
contributions in order to be successful in
its first road trip of the season. Consider
ing the sharing of the wealth in the scor
ing against Vanguard (every player to get
on the court scored), it does not look to be
as big of an issue this year.
Four Stanford upperclassmen sat out
of Sunday's game, including senior Sara
James, who started at guard last year, and
sophomores Taylor Greenfield, Bonnie
Samuelson and Erica Payne. Greenfield
and Samuelson are expected to return
soon, but Payne probably will not be
ready until Pac-12 play.
With the absence of James as a return
ing starter and the power forward posi
tion left open with the loss of Joslyn Tin
kle 'l3 to graduation, there were two open
spots in the starting lineup for the Cardi
nal to fill to compliment senior Chiney Og
wumike, redshirt senior Mikaela Ruef and
sophomore Amber Orrange. Those two
starting spots ended up being taken in the
exhibition by freshman Kailee Johnson
and redshirt sophomore Alex Green.
Ogwumike led the team in scoring with
27 points and 15 rebounds in just 21 min
utes of play and went into the halftime
break already having a double-double un
der her belt. Ogwumike was recently
named one of five players to the 2013-14
preseason Associated Press All-America
Team for the second straight season, join
ing Maryland's Alyssa Thomas, Baylor's
Odyssey Sims and Connecticut's Breanna
Stewart and Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis.
