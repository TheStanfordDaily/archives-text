## Cardinal travels injured 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 3 Stanford women's basketball will
open regular season play this Saturday on
the road at Boston College before it
moves on to Storrs, Conn., to take on No.
1 Connecticut on Monday.
Stanford played its only exhibition
game last Sunday at Maples against Van
guard and dismantled the Lions 79-47 to
stai*t its 2013-14 campaign. Stanford is ex
pected to finish atop the Pac-12 for the
14th consecutive season in a conference
that boasts four teams in the top 25, ac
cording to ESPN's preseason poll.
In the midst of numerous injuries, the
Card will have to look to new players for
contributions in order to be successful in
its first road trip of the season. Consider
ing the sharing of the wealth in the scor
ing against Vanguard (every player to get
on the court scored), it does not look to be
as big of an issue this year.
Four Stanford upperclassmen sat out
of Sunday's game, including senior Sara
James, who started at guard last year, and
sophomores Taylor Greenfield, Bonnie
Samuelson and Erica Payne. Greenfield
and Samuelson are expected to return
soon, but Payne probably will not be
ready until Pac-12 play.
With the absence of James as a return
ing starter and the power forward posi
tion left open with the loss of Joslyn Tin
kle 'l3 to graduation, there were two open
spots in the starting lineup for the Cardi
nal to fill to compliment senior Chiney Og
wumike, redshirt senior Mikaela Ruef and
sophomore Amber Orrange. Those two
starting spots ended up being taken in the
exhibition by freshman Kailee Johnson
and redshirt sophomore Alex Green.
Ogwumike led the team in scoring with
27 points and 15 rebounds in just 21 min
utes of play and went into the halftime
break already having a double-double un
der her belt. Ogwumike was recently
named one of five players to the 2013-14
preseason Associated Press All-America
Team for the second straight season, join
ing Maryland's Alyssa Thomas, Baylor's
Odyssey Sims and Connecticut's Breanna
Stewart and Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis.
Other preseason accolades
included a candidacy for the
Wade Trophy Player of the
Year honor and the John R.
Wooden Award.
Coming off of the bench
in Sunday's win, freshman
Erica McCall was the sec
ond-leading scorer with 14
points, while Johnson was a
huge offensive force
throughout the game, net

ting 13 points to go with nine
rebounds. Freshman Lili
Thompson also saw a lot of
playing time as she split time
at point guard with Orrange,
a member of last year's All-
Pac-12 team. From there,
scoring was equally spread
among the remaining three
starters and three bench
players.
Although it was just an ex
hibition game, the Vanguard
game gave the Card great
confidence to work off of de
spite its limited roster head
ing into this week's road trip.
Boston College is project-

Ed to finish 11th in the At
lantic Coast Conference
(ACC), which is led this year
by No. 2 Duke. This will be
the Eagles' first regular-sea
son game of the season as
well. They return last year's
two leading scorers: seniors
Kristen Doherty (12.3 points
per game) and Katie
Zenevitch (12.1 points per
game).
Tip-off for Saturday's
game at Boston College is set
for 10 a.m.
