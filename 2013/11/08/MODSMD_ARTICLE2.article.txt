# BEST IN THE WEST
## THE 						DUCK STOPS HERE

There are a few jaw-dropping defensive performances in
the history of college football that aren't meant to be
emulated, much less topped. On Thursday night, it became
clear that Stanford's 17-14 overtime victory against Oregon last
year just wasn't one of them.

In one of the most electric at
mospheres at Stanford Stadium in
recent memory, No. 5 Stanford (8-
1, 6-1 Pac-12) shocked the college
football world for the second year
in a row by upending mighty No. 3
Oregon (8-1,5-1) 26-20. The deceiv
ingly close score didn't do justice to
the fact that the Cardinal utterly
dominated in all three phases of
the game for over three-and-half
quarters, before the Ducks
stormed back in the last five min
utes of the game thanks to a
blocked field goal returned for a
touchdown and a quick score fol
lowing an onside kick recovery
to cap the night off in dramatic
fashion.
The victory marked Stanford's
fourth consecutive home victory
over a ranked opponent, the first
time that's happened in school his
tory.
"It's November," said head
coach David Shaw. "We talked as a
team about, 'lt's time to play our
best football.' No one has seen our
best football, and that's including
us. Tonight was about three-and
three-quarters of it."
Led by fifth-year senior line
backer Shayne Skov's nine-tackle
performance, the Cardinal defense
held the Ducks scoreless for over
three quarters while holding their
potent rushing attack which av
eraged 331.5 yards per game com
ing into Thursday night to just
62 yards. At the end of the third
quarter, a baffled Ducks offense
had only mustered 185 total yards
and was further plagued by two
turnovers.
Sharing a fate also suffered by

fellow Pac-12 signal-callers Brett
Hundley and Sean Mannion, Ore
gon star quarterback Marcus Mar
iota saw his once-promising Heis
man campaign derailed by a Cardi
nal defense that somehow played
even more dominantly than it did
in the 2012 game against the
Ducks.
"We don't concede points,"
Skov said. "People can write what
they want and say what they want,
but what counts are the guys who
take that field.... What happens
between the lines is dictated by
us."
But while Stanford's defense
stifled Oregon drive after drive, it
was senior running back lyier
Gaffney who pounded out 157
yards on 45 carries a single
game school record behind a
bulldozing offensive line that
played by far its best game of the
season.
"Tyler Gaffney ran the ball
tonight the way running backs are
supposed to run the ball in this
game of football," Shaw said.
"When you walk into our new [foot
ball] facility the players-only
entrance to the left is the offen
sive line, to the right is the picture
of the defensive line. That is what
football is about."
The Cardinal defense first
brought back memories of 2012
when it made a big goal-line stand
during Oregon's second possession
of the game. The front seven
stuffed running back Byron Mar
shall at the line of scrimmage two
consecutive times before great cov
erage by the Cardinal secondary
thwarted Mariota's third- and

fourth-down pass attempts.
Despite being pinned in its own
territory, the Cardinal offense im
mediately went on a 96-yard touch
down drive catalyzed by a 47-yard
hookup between junior quarter
back Kevin Hogan and sophomore
wideout Michael Rector. In a start
that was eerily similar to that of
the 2012 Stanford-Oregon game,
the Cardinal led the Ducks 7-0 ear
ly on.
"We knew going into this game,
[it] was going to be a test of wills,"
Skov said. "Two different ap
proaches, two very different tem
pos. One team was going to decide
the way it was going to go."
"We go into every game with
the same mentality that we are go
ing to shut people down," said sen
ior inside linebacker A. J. Tarpley.
Unlike in the 2012 game, Stan
ford took control of the game offen
sively in the second quarter.
Though Hogan's overall passing
numbers seven-of-13 for 103
yards—weren't impressive, the
junior signal-caller made big runs
at critical times. One of the biggest
plays came early in the second
quarter, when Hogan tucked the
ball on a zone read to score an 11-
yard touchdown and give Stanford
a 14-0 lead.
Perhaps most importantly, Ore
gon's offense was only on the field
for one drive the entire second
quarter and it resulted in no
points, thanks to a tremendous ef
fort by Skov to wrestle the ball out
of running back De' Anthony
Thomas' hands and then recover
the fumble.
The Cardinal offense used the
momentum to fuel a 20-play, 96-
yard field-goal-scoring drive that
ate up 8:26 off the clock. Though
the Cardinal failed to find the end
zone, it asserted its running game
against an overmatched Ducks
front that could not stop Gaffney
even when it loaded the box.
Gaffney carried the ball 24 times
nine times on that 20-play drive
in the first half as Stanford
jumped out to a shocking 17-0 lead
at halftime.
"We made the holes," Gaffney
said. "[The offensive linemen did]
their job. They're moving guys
back yards and yards. I'm taking
some credit, I guess, but this is for
them."
The Cardinal offense didn't find

the end zone again for the rest of
the game, but it managed to tack
on two field goals in the third quar
ter. Meanwhile, the Ducks offense
kept on unraveling with its first
two second-half possessions ending
in a turnover a fumble by Mari
ota, this time and a three-and
out.
While Skov had the best stat
line defensively, sophomore cor
nerback Alex Carter sealed the
edges time after time to stifle Ore
gon's running game, and senior de
fensive end Henry Anderson
looked sharp despite being side
lined for almost two months by a
knee injury.
"We weren't nervous about
[Anderson's] conditioning," Shaw
said. "That was the one thing we
felt really good about, but you nev
er know until they start playing
football, and he played a lot."
But just when it appeared that
the Cardinal was about to run
away with a blowout victory, the
Ducks mounted a furious fourth
quarter rally. A 23-yard touchdown
pass from Mariota to wide receiver
Daryle Hawkins pulled the Ducks
with 19, but the Cardinal had no
reason to worry at least, not un
til Williamson's 40-yard field goal
attempt was blocked and returned
for a touchdown with 5:08 left in the
game.
The Cardinal held its ground on
the Ducks' two-point conversion at
tempt to keep its lead at 13, but
Oregon managed to recover the on
side kick after the ball bounced out
of senior Jeff Trojan's hands when
he was hit.
The Ducks moved downfield in a
hurry, but as the game came down
to the wire, the Cardinal slowed
down the Oregon offense just
enough near the goal line to take
valuable time off the clock. Eventu
ally, though, Mariota connected
with tight end Pharaoh Brown for a
touchdown pass on fourth-and-goal
at the Cardinal 12-yard line to bring
the Ducks within six points.
But after giving up 20 unan
swered points in just under eight
minutes, the Cardinal stopped the
bleeding.
Trojan came through by secur
ing Oregon's third and final onside
kick, and with the Ducks out of
timeouts, Stanford ran out the clock
with three straight run plays.
"The fact that we've won two in
a row against [Oregon], credit
[goes] to our players, the coaches
and preparation," Shaw said.
"[Oregon] didn't give it to us. We
had to play our game and finish the
game at the end, and we did."
Next up for Stanford is a trip to
the Coliseum, where the Cardinal
will try to defeat USC for the fifth
straight year and fourth consecu
tive time on the road.

There are a few jaw-dropping defensive performances in

football world for the second year
in a row by upending mighty No. 3
Oregon (8-1,5-1) 26-20. The deceiv

the fact that the Cardinal utterly
dominated in all three phases of
the game for over three-and-half
quarters, before the Ducks
stormed back in the last five min

blocked field goal returned for a
touchdown and a quick score fol
lowing an onside kick recovery
to cap the night off in dramatic
fashion.
The victory marked Stanford's
fourth consecutive home victory
over a ranked opponent, the first
time that's happened in school his

"It's November," said head
coach David Shaw. "We talked as a
team about, 'lt's time to play our
best football.' No one has seen our
best football, and that's including
us. Tonight was about three-and
three-quarters of it."
Led by fifth-year senior line
backer Shayne Skov's nine-tackle
performance, the Cardinal defense
held the Ducks scoreless for over
three quarters while holding their
potent rushing attack which av
eraged 331.5 yards per game com
ing into Thursday night to just
62 yards. At the end of the third
quarter, a baffled Ducks offense
had only mustered 185 total yards
and was further plagued by two
turnovers.
Sharing a fate also suffered by

fellow Pac-12 signal-callers Brett
Hundley and Sean Mannion, Ore
gon star quarterback Marcus Mar
iota saw his once-promising Heis

even more dominantly than it did
in the 2012 game against the
Ducks.
"We don't concede points,"
Skov said. "People can write what
they want and say what they want,
but what counts are the guys who
take that field.... What happens
between the lines is dictated by
us."
But while Stanford's defense
stifled Oregon drive after drive, it
was senior running back lyier
Gaffney who pounded out 157
yards on 45 carries a single
game school record behind a
bulldozing offensive line that
played by far its best game of the

The Cardinal defense first
brought back memories of 2012
when it made a big goal-line stand
during Oregon's second possession
of the game. The front seven
stuffed running back Byron Mar
shall at the line of scrimmage two
consecutive times before great cov

thwarted Mariota's third- and

fourth-down pass attempts.
Despite being pinned in its own

hookup between junior quarter
back Kevin Hogan and sophomore
wideout Michael Rector. In a start
that was eerily similar to that of
the 2012 Stanford-Oregon game,
the Cardinal led the Ducks 7-0 ear
ly on.
"We knew going into this game,
[it] was going to be a test of wills,"
Skov said. "Two different ap
proaches, two very different tem
pos. One team was going to decide
the way it was going to go."
"We go into every game with
the same mentality that we are go
ing to shut people down," said sen
ior inside linebacker A. J. Tarpley.
Unlike in the 2012 game, Stan
ford took control of the game offen
sively in the second quarter.
Though Hogan's overall passing
numbers seven-of-13 for 103
yards—weren't impressive, the
junior signal-caller made big runs
at critical times. One of the biggest
plays came early in the second
quarter, when Hogan tucked the
ball on a zone read to score an 11-
yard touchdown and give Stanford
a 14-0 lead.
Perhaps most importantly, Ore
gon's offense was only on the field
for one drive the entire second
quarter and it resulted in no
points, thanks to a tremendous ef
fort by Skov to wrestle the ball out
of running back De' Anthony
Thomas' hands and then recover
the fumble.
The Cardinal offense used the
momentum to fuel a 20-play, 96-
yard field-goal-scoring drive that
ate up 8:26 off the clock. Though
the Cardinal failed to find the end
zone, it asserted its running game
against an overmatched Ducks
front that could not stop Gaffney
even when it loaded the box.
Gaffney carried the ball 24 times
nine times on that 20-play drive
in the first half as Stanford
jumped out to a shocking 17-0 lead
at halftime.
"We made the holes," Gaffney
said. "[The offensive linemen did]
their job. They're moving guys
back yards and yards. I'm taking
some credit, I guess, but this is for
them."
The Cardinal offense didn't find

the end zone again for the rest of
the game, but it managed to tack
on two field goals in the third quar
ter. Meanwhile, the Ducks offense
kept on unraveling with its first
two second-half possessions ending
in a turnover a fumble by Mari
ota, this time and a three-and
out.
While Skov had the best stat
line defensively, sophomore cor
nerback Alex Carter sealed the
edges time after time to stifle Ore
gon's running game, and senior de
fensive end Henry Anderson
looked sharp despite being side
lined for almost two months by a
knee injury.
"We weren't nervous about
[Anderson's] conditioning," Shaw
said. "That was the one thing we
felt really good about, but you nev
er know until they start playing
football, and he played a lot."
But just when it appeared that
the Cardinal was about to run
away with a blowout victory, the
Ducks mounted a furious fourth
quarter rally. A 23-yard touchdown
pass from Mariota to wide receiver
Daryle Hawkins pulled the Ducks
with 19, but the Cardinal had no
reason to worry at least, not un
til Williamson's 40-yard field goal
attempt was blocked and returned
for a touchdown with 5:08 left in the
game.
The Cardinal held its ground on
the Ducks' two-point conversion at
tempt to keep its lead at 13, but
Oregon managed to recover the on
side kick after the ball bounced out
of senior Jeff Trojan's hands when
he was hit.
The Ducks moved downfield in a
hurry, but as the game came down
to the wire, the Cardinal slowed
down the Oregon offense just
enough near the goal line to take
valuable time off the clock. Eventu
ally, though, Mariota connected
with tight end Pharaoh Brown for a
touchdown pass on fourth-and-goal
at the Cardinal 12-yard line to bring
the Ducks within six points.
But after giving up 20 unan
swered points in just under eight
minutes, the Cardinal stopped the
bleeding.
Trojan came through by secur
ing Oregon's third and final onside
kick, and with the Ducks out of
timeouts, Stanford ran out the clock
with three straight run plays.
"The fact that we've won two in
a row against [Oregon], credit
[goes] to our players, the coaches
and preparation," Shaw said.
"[Oregon] didn't give it to us. We
had to play our game and finish the
game at the end, and we did."
Next up for Stanford is a trip to
the Coliseum, where the Cardinal
will try to defeat USC for the fifth
straight year and fourth consecu
tive time on the road.

There are a few jaw-dropping defensive performances in
the history of college football that aren't meant to be
emulated, much less topped. On Thursday night, it became
clear that Stanford's 17-14 overtime victory against Oregon last
year just wasn't one of them.

In one of the most electric at
mospheres at Stanford Stadium in
recent memory, No. 5 Stanford (8-
1, 6-1 Pac-12) shocked the college
football world for the second year
in a row by upending mighty No. 3
Oregon (8-1,5-1) 26-20. The deceiv
ingly close score didn't do justice to
the fact that the Cardinal utterly
dominated in all three phases of
the game for over three-and-half
quarters, before the Ducks
stormed back in the last five min
utes of the game thanks to a
blocked field goal returned for a
touchdown and a quick score fol
lowing an onside kick recovery
to cap the night off in dramatic
fashion.
The victory marked Stanford's
fourth consecutive home victory
over a ranked opponent, the first
time that's happened in school his
tory.
"It's November," said head
coach David Shaw. "We talked as a
team about, 'lt's time to play our
best football.' No one has seen our
best football, and that's including
us. Tonight was about three-and
three-quarters of it."
Led by fifth-year senior line
backer Shayne Skov's nine-tackle
performance, the Cardinal defense
held the Ducks scoreless for over
three quarters while holding their
potent rushing attack which av
eraged 331.5 yards per game com
ing into Thursday night to just
62 yards. At the end of the third
quarter, a baffled Ducks offense
had only mustered 185 total yards
and was further plagued by two
turnovers.
Sharing a fate also suffered by

fellow Pac-12 signal-callers Brett
Hundley and Sean Mannion, Ore
gon star quarterback Marcus Mar
iota saw his once-promising Heis
man campaign derailed by a Cardi
nal defense that somehow played
even more dominantly than it did
in the 2012 game against the
Ducks.
"We don't concede points,"
Skov said. "People can write what
they want and say what they want,
but what counts are the guys who
take that field.... What happens
between the lines is dictated by
us."
But while Stanford's defense
stifled Oregon drive after drive, it
was senior running back lyier
Gaffney who pounded out 157
yards on 45 carries a single
game school record behind a
bulldozing offensive line that
played by far its best game of the
season.
"Tyler Gaffney ran the ball
tonight the way running backs are
supposed to run the ball in this
game of football," Shaw said.
"When you walk into our new [foot
ball] facility the players-only
entrance to the left is the offen
sive line, to the right is the picture
of the defensive line. That is what
football is about."
The Cardinal defense first
brought back memories of 2012
when it made a big goal-line stand
during Oregon's second possession
of the game. The front seven
stuffed running back Byron Mar
shall at the line of scrimmage two
consecutive times before great cov
erage by the Cardinal secondary
thwarted Mariota's third- and

fourth-down pass attempts.
Despite being pinned in its own
territory, the Cardinal offense im
mediately went on a 96-yard touch
down drive catalyzed by a 47-yard
hookup between junior quarter
back Kevin Hogan and sophomore
wideout Michael Rector. In a start
that was eerily similar to that of

of senior Jeff Trojan's hands when
he was hit.
The Ducks moved downfield in a
hurry, but as the game came down
to the wire, the Cardinal slowed
down the Oregon offense just
enough near the goal line to take
valuable time off the clock. Eventu
ally, though, Mariota connected
with tight end Pharaoh Brown for a
touchdown pass on fourth-and-goal
at the Cardinal 12-yard line to bring
the Ducks within six points.
But after giving up 20 unan
swered points in just under eight
minutes, the Cardinal stopped the
bleeding.
Trojan came through by secur
ing Oregon's third and final onside
kick, and with the Ducks out of
timeouts, Stanford ran out the clock
with three straight run plays.
"The fact that we've won two in
a row against [Oregon], credit
[goes] to our players, the coaches
and preparation," Shaw said.
"[Oregon] didn't give it to us. We
had to play our game and finish the
game at the end, and we did."
Next up for Stanford is a trip to
the Coliseum, where the Cardinal
will try to defeat USC for the fifth
straight year and fourth consecu
tive time on the road.

"It's
November.
We talked as a
team about,
'lt's time to
play our
best."'

Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan (above) used his legs to make plays
in key spots to lead the Cardinal to a victory eerily reminiscent of the
win at Autzen in 2012, when Hogan led the charge in his second start.

Fifth-year senior inside linebacker Shayne Skov (above) led another
stellar performance by the Cardinal defense. Stanford shocked the
Ducks by holding their potent offense scoreless for three quarters.
