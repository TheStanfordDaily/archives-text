## ILEs receive mixed reviews SIMILE, ITALIC programs weave science and art together 
### GWYNN LYONS 
Science in the Making: Integrated
Learning Environment (SIMILE) and
Immersion in the Arts: Living in Culture
(ITALIC), two pilot integrated learning
environment (ILE) programs for fresh
men, are nearing the end of their fust
quarter with mixed reviews from stu
dents and faculty.
The new programs which are
modeled closely on Structured Liberal
Education (SLE) but scaled back in
terms of units have some students
wanting more from the programs' short
lectures.
Despite this, Janice Ross M.A. '75
Ph.D. '9B, professor of theatre and per
formance studies and faculty director of
ITALIC, said students are excited with
their experiences thus far.
"We've never had such a great group
of students who are so enthusiastic and
open," she said.
But, they aren't the only ones who are
enthusiastic. Professors are also excited
to teach the material.
"We'll say, 'Hey, why don't you go
watch this film before lecture next
week?"' Ross said. "We're calibrating
that, not to let our enthusiasm drown the
students."
Ross is eager to reach freshman in
particular because they are at the begin
ning of their Stanford journey.
"We've got students on the cusp of
beginning at Stanford, and it's a moment
where freshman aren't cynical about
their requirements," Ross said, citing
her experience teaching an Introduction
to the Humanities course.
"It used to be this sense that if it was
a requirement, you couldn't enjoy the
class," she added. "There's none of that
going on ITALIC."
ITALIC offers arts community, oppor
tunities
Despite her overall enjoyment of
ITALIC, Reagan Ross 'l7 identified lack
of class time a limitation of the program.
"I don't like that our sections are on
ly 50 minutes," she said. "Everyone's so
opinionated in ITALIC that we don't
have time to get through all of that. I
think if we had more time, we could go
deeper in lecture."
However, Ross said she enjoyed the
program, and has found it to be a close
knit community of students who are

open and willing to share their art.
In line with the program's central
goal, Ross said that ITALIC introduced
her to the arts at Stanford.
"ITALIC provides me with a lot of
opportunities I don't think I would have
had otherwise," she said.
Ross added that representatives of
student art groups actively recruited
people from Burbank. She found out
about The Chocolate Heads, an art col
lective at Stanford, through ITALIC and
plans to compose music for the group.
SIMILE met with mixed reactions
SIMILE offers a different immersive
experience, one based in the history of
science.
Gabriella Godines 'l7, a SIMILE stu
dent, said she enjoys learning about the
evolution of science and reconstructing
ancient experiments.
"We have a Science Salon every Tues
day," Godines said. "We even created an
astrolabe, so we got to be able to tell time
with just the sun's shadow."
Godines said she is excited for the
rest of the year, especially when the cur
riculum progresses towards more con
temporary science during winter quar
ter.
"I'm looking forward to the end of
spring, being able to look back at what
I've done up to that point and see if I've
really changed that much in terms of my
views of science," Godines said.
Unlike Godines, one SIMILE stu

dent —who wished to remain anony
mous is considering dropping the pro
gram, citing the discrepancy between
student expectations of the program and
what it's actually been.
"We expected it to be more weighted
on the science and engineering paid, but
this quarter we're focusing more on the
origin of science and its relation to reli
gion and historical context," she said.
'lAssignments are actually fun, but it's
the lectures that make me feel not as in
terested. The reading can get pretty
dry."
Reviel Netz, a professor of classics
and SIMILE lecturer, said he hopes to
introduce a long-term hands-on project
next year.
"I'm not sure it is practical, but I
would like to try to build a catapult and
have the students come up with the mod
el," he said.
Stephanie Eberle, Burbank resident
fellow, observed that first-quarter fresh
men can sometimes be overwhelmed by
the novelty of their experiences. She is
encouraged, however, by how the Bur
bank community has bonded.
"The conversation continues among a
unique group of students, faculty, aca
demic and ResEd staff members, each
providing their own perspectives," she
said in a statement. "The newness and
diversity of the community has made us
very strong because there is a feeling
that we are all in this together."

Classrooms were created in the basement of Burbank House for students in
the new Science in the Making: Integrated Learning Environment (SIMILE) and
Immersion in the Arts: Living in Culture (ITALIC) residential programs.
Interaction between the
programs
Although the students' ed
ucational experience differs
in these two programs, they
spend time together in a so
cial setting in Burbank
House.
"We definitely hang out a
lot," Ross said. "We have

some events that [SIMILE
students] can go to but we
don't do lectures or anything
like that together."
Justin Brown 'l5, a Bur
bank resident assistant, says
that SIMILE and ITALIC
students overlap in many
ways both in an out of the
classroom.
"Several of our SIMILE
students play in the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra while
many of our ITALIC stu
dents are contemplating ma
jors in engineering and the

sciences," he said in a state
ment. "Their desire to ex
plore their* many different in
terests is what unites them."
Netz believes that SIMI
LE and ITALIC have the po
tential to become models for
residential learning pro
grams at other universities.
"What I hope is that we
become a template," he said.
"It's so supremely important
to teach science in this way."

Despite this, Janice Ross M.A. '75
Ph.D. '9B, professor of theatre and per
formance studies and faculty director of
ITALIC, said students are excited with
their experiences thus far.
"We've never had such a great group
of students who are so enthusiastic and
open," she said.
But, they aren't the only ones who are
enthusiastic. Professors are also excited
to teach the material.
"We'll say, 'Hey, why don't you go
watch this film before lecture next
week?"' Ross said. "We're calibrating
that, not to let our enthusiasm drown the
students."
Ross is eager to reach freshman in
particular because they are at the begin
ning of their Stanford journey.
"We've got students on the cusp of
beginning at Stanford, and it's a moment
where freshman aren't cynical about
their requirements," Ross said, citing
her experience teaching an Introduction
to the Humanities course.
"It used to be this sense that if it was
a requirement, you couldn't enjoy the
class," she added. "There's none of that
going on ITALIC."
ITALIC offers arts community, oppor
tunities
Despite her overall enjoyment of
ITALIC, Reagan Ross 'l7 identified lack
of class time a limitation of the program.
"I don't like that our sections are on
ly 50 minutes," she said. "Everyone's so
opinionated in ITALIC that we don't
have time to get through all of that. I
think if we had more time, we could go
deeper in lecture."
However, Ross said she enjoyed the
program, and has found it to be a close
knit community of students who are

open and willing to share their art.
In line with the program's central
goal, Ross said that ITALIC introduced
her to the arts at Stanford.
"ITALIC provides me with a lot of
opportunities I don't think I would have
had otherwise," she said.
Ross added that representatives of
student art groups actively recruited
people from Burbank. She found out
about The Chocolate Heads, an art col
lective at Stanford, through ITALIC and
plans to compose music for the group.
SIMILE met with mixed reactions
SIMILE offers a different immersive
experience, one based in the history of
science.
Gabriella Godines 'l7, a SIMILE stu
dent, said she enjoys learning about the
evolution of science and reconstructing
ancient experiments.
"We have a Science Salon every Tues
day," Godines said. "We even created an
astrolabe, so we got to be able to tell time
with just the sun's shadow."
Godines said she is excited for the
rest of the year, especially when the cur
riculum progresses towards more con
temporary science during winter quar
ter.
"I'm looking forward to the end of
spring, being able to look back at what
I've done up to that point and see if I've
really changed that much in terms of my
views of science," Godines said.
Unlike Godines, one SIMILE stu

dent —who wished to remain anony
mous is considering dropping the pro
gram, citing the discrepancy between
student expectations of the program and
what it's actually been.
"We expected it to be more weighted
on the science and engineering paid, but
this quarter we're focusing more on the
origin of science and its relation to reli
gion and historical context," she said.
'lAssignments are actually fun, but it's
the lectures that make me feel not as in
terested. The reading can get pretty
dry."
Reviel Netz, a professor of classics
and SIMILE lecturer, said he hopes to
introduce a long-term hands-on project
next year.
"I'm not sure it is practical, but I
would like to try to build a catapult and
have the students come up with the mod
el," he said.
Stephanie Eberle, Burbank resident
fellow, observed that first-quarter fresh
men can sometimes be overwhelmed by
the novelty of their experiences. She is
encouraged, however, by how the Bur
bank community has bonded.
"The conversation continues among a
unique group of students, faculty, aca
demic and ResEd staff members, each
providing their own perspectives," she
said in a statement. "The newness and
diversity of the community has made us
very strong because there is a feeling
that we are all in this together."

Classrooms were created in the basement of Burbank House for students in
the new Science in the Making: Integrated Learning Environment (SIMILE) and
Immersion in the Arts: Living in Culture (ITALIC) residential programs.
Interaction between the
programs
Although the students' ed
ucational experience differs
in these two programs, they
spend time together in a so
cial setting in Burbank
House.
"We definitely hang out a
lot," Ross said. "We have

some events that [SIMILE
students] can go to but we
don't do lectures or anything
like that together."
Justin Brown 'l5, a Bur
bank resident assistant, says
that SIMILE and ITALIC
students overlap in many
ways both in an out of the
classroom.
"Several of our SIMILE
students play in the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra while
many of our ITALIC stu
dents are contemplating ma
jors in engineering and the

sciences," he said in a state
ment. "Their desire to ex
plore their* many different in
terests is what unites them."
Netz believes that SIMI
LE and ITALIC have the po
tential to become models for
residential learning pro
grams at other universities.
"What I hope is that we
become a template," he said.
"It's so supremely important
to teach science in this way."

Science in the Making: Integrated
Learning Environment (SIMILE) and
Immersion in the Arts: Living in Culture
(ITALIC), two pilot integrated learning
environment (ILE) programs for fresh
men, are nearing the end of their fust
quarter with mixed reviews from stu
dents and faculty.
The new programs which are
modeled closely on Structured Liberal
Education (SLE) but scaled back in
terms of units have some students
wanting more from the programs' short
lectures.
