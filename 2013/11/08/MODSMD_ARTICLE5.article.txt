## Ambady leaves lasting legacy 
### SKYLAR COHEN 
Nalini Ambady, professor of psy
chology, passed away last week on Oct.
28 at the age of 54.
Ambady's well-publicized search
for a compatible bone marrow donor in
the last year of her life prompted by
a recurrence of leukemia reflected
the solidarity that she inspired among
those she knew as well as her unfailing
concern for others.
Ambady was a pioneer in exploring
how extremely short impressions, or
"thin slices," can often lead to highly
accurate assessments. In one of her
most well-known studies, subjects who

watched silent 30-second video clips of
lectures gave similar teacher evalua
tions to those given by students who
had been in a class for months.
"She was really innovative and not
afraid to move into new territories, and
let the work and ideas carry her into
new places," said Jennifer Ebei'hardt,
associate professor of psychology.
Born in Calcutta, India, Ambady
came to America to obtain an M.A. in
psychology from the College of
William and Mary, and a Ph.D. in social
psychology from Harvard. Since that
time, she held associate professorships
at College of the Holy Cross and Har
vard, followed by professorships at

Tufts and finally
Stanford in 2011.
According to
Brent Hughes, a
post-doctorate
fellow in her lab,

Ambady created communities wherev
er she went, including her lab at Tufts
and her time at other universities. In
the first six months of her time at Stan
ford, she purchased a bike and a text
book for financially challenged stu
dents.
According to Aneeta Rattan, who
worked with Ambady in one of her


Nalini Ambady
classes while a post-doctoral fellow,
Ambady's main focus was to en
gage her students on their own
terms, respecting each individual.
Rather than being blindly as
signed to groups for projects, for
example, students engaged in "re
search speed dating" to get a good
sense of the other students' inter
ests.
When Ambady moved to Stan
ford, a lab space was built for her
where those who worked with her
could communicate freely and de
velop friendships. According to
Hughes, Ambady continued to
show a deep interest in her stu
dents and their projects, even as
she went to Boston for treatment.
While at Stanford, Ambady
founded the Social Psychological
Answers for Real-World Questions
(SPARQ) foundation. According to
Alana Conner A.M. 'Ol Ph.D. 'O2,
executive director of SPARQ, the
program focuses on creating and

sharing social psychology innova
tions for people working to im
prove society.
Ambady is survived by her hus
band, Raj Marphatia, and daugh
ters Leena and Maya. According
to Eberhardt, she thought about
her work as a part of her personal
life, eliminating barriers between
her research and her family.
Her daughters knew her stu
dents, and witnessed how much
joy her work brought her even
when she was sick, Eberhardt
said. According to Hughes, she in
vited students who couldn't go
home for Thanksgiving to eat din
ner at her house.
"And in those really short inter
actions she got to know us, and I
feel like I have a personal connec
tion with her," said Advika Gupta
'l6, who attended Thanksgiving
dinner at Ambady's house last
year. "She had away of empathiz
ing with the situation."
Late last year, Ambady learned
that her leukemia that first ap
peared in 2004 had come back, ac
cording to Taylor Phillips, a third
year graduate student who worked
with Ambady in psychology de

partment and played a large role in
coordinating the bone marrow
campaign.
According to Hughes, The fol
lowing months witnessed Am
bady's extended academic family
coming together to conduct bone
marrow registry drives, with
drives eventually occurring in In
dia.
Hughes and Phillips said many
minorities, including South Asians,
are severely underrepresented in
donor registries. The drives were
held with the goal of recruiting a di
verse group of donors. Ambady
was reluctant to accept donations
and was pleased that others in a
similar situation could be helped,
Hughes said.
Unfortunately, she did not find
success. Some of the identified
matches were ruled out after more
detailed investigation, and the rest
of the matches backed out for vari
ous reasons, according to Phillips.
However, the campaign laid the
groundwork for long-term change.
SPARQ has begun an initiative
called Be the Donor to improve re
cruitment and increase retention of
bone marrow donors.

Ambady will remain an inspira
tion for those who knew her.
"She was a tremendous person
especially in academia, where
it's difficult, I think, to find a role
model that captures not only who
you want to be as a person in the

field, but who you want to be as a
person in the world," Hughes said.
"I think she captured both of those
things, and it's very rare."
