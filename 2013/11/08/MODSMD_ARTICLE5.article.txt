## Ambady leaves lasting legacy 
### SKYLAR COHEN 
Nalini Ambady, professor of psy
chology, passed away last week on Oct.
28 at the age of 54.
Ambady's well-publicized search
for a compatible bone marrow donor in
the last year of her life prompted by
a recurrence of leukemia reflected
the solidarity that she inspired among
those she knew as well as her unfailing
concern for others.
Ambady was a pioneer in exploring
how extremely short impressions, or
"thin slices," can often lead to highly
accurate assessments. In one of her
most well-known studies, subjects who

watched silent 30-second video clips of
lectures gave similar teacher evalua
tions to those given by students who
had been in a class for months.
"She was really innovative and not
afraid to move into new territories, and
let the work and ideas carry her into
new places," said Jennifer Ebei'hardt,
associate professor of psychology.
Born in Calcutta, India, Ambady
came to America to obtain an M.A. in
psychology from the College of
William and Mary, and a Ph.D. in social
psychology from Harvard. Since that
time, she held associate professorships
at College of the Holy Cross and Har
vard, followed by professorships at

Tufts and finally
Stanford in 2011.
According to
Brent Hughes, a
post-doctorate
fellow in her lab,

Ambady created communities wherev
er she went, including her lab at Tufts
and her time at other universities. In
the first six months of her time at Stan
ford, she purchased a bike and a text
book for financially challenged stu
dents.
