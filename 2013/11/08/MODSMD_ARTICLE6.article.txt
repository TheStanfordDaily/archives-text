# Q&A QUYNH-THU LE
## CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY 
### JAMIE HELYAR 
Quynh-Thu Le, chair of
the Department of Radiation
Oncology and the Mc-
Cormick Memorial professor
at the Stanford School of
Medicine was recently elect
ed to the Institute of Medi
cine. Le has received national
attention for her research
which focuses on strengthen
ing the use of radiation treat
ment for head and neck can
cers.
The Daily sat down to talk
to Le about her research, her
patients and plans for her
new position in the Institute.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):
What is your research and
the goals of your research?
Quynh-Thu Le (QL): The
focus of my research is
around the areas of cancer I
treat, using radiation. There
are some tumors that re
spond very well to radia
tion, and some that blast
back at us. The question is:
Are there gene and protein
abnormalities that we
can we identify to deter
mine which tumors will re
spond to radiation and
which won't? One thing I've
been doing is looking at
biomarkers from tumors
and blood that might indi
cate how patients will re
spond to radiation.
TSD: What qualities do you
think distinguished you as
an attractive candidate to
the Institute?
QL: I chair a group of
physicians medical on

cologists, radiation oncolo
gists, surgeons and we
work for the National Can
cer Institute (NCI) to de
sign clinical trials that tack
le head and neck cancer.
These are big studies that
will hopefully change de
generative care. I also work
a lot with Asian countries
China, Hong Kong, Tai
wan, Singapore so
maybe my international
connection helped. Also, I
think I help to bring diversi
ty to the Institute, as a Viet
namese woman. I think this
is a great opportunity for
me to represent Asian-
American women.
TSD: You mentioned med
ical interest in Asia. Can you
elaborate on that?
QL: I grew up in Vietnam,
and I trained here. But my
interest has been in a type of
head and neck cancer that's
very heavily focused in Asia:
nasopharynx cancer. I
would love to be able to
learn how to develop radia
tion technologies right
now they're very expensive
that introduce new treat
ment options to Southeast
Asia in away that's afford
able for patients.
TSD: What do you hope to
contribute to the Institute?
QL: I would love to push to
the forefront the collabora
tions I have in developing
countries. I think that's a
strong interest: health out
side the United States. And

of course, I would like to learn
about the roles of gender and eth
nicity differences in medicine.
TSD: What excites you most
about your involvement in the In
stitute?
QL: The Institute has done
tremendous work with clinical
trials and cooperative groups. The
Institute has also been assessing
how we are using genomics, and
interpreting lots of big data that
we are now using in the care of
patients. One goal of the Institute
is working to curb the cost of
healthcare for patients, and then
expand this effort into developing
areas of the world.
TSD: Of your many jobs, which
one drives you the most?
QL: Of the two things that drive
me the most and I think
they're probably equal at this
point one is taking care of my
patients. I love the satisfaction I
get when I go through treatment

with a patient and watch his or
her cancer disappear. My second
goal is to push forward research
and care on behalf of my patients.
TSD: Were there moments in
your medical career when you've
experienced setbacks? What have
been some of your greatest chal
lenges?
QL: When I first started practic
ing, I didn't know my identity as a
physician. Then I got into the lab,
and really learned how to do basic
research and create a career for
myself. But that was one of the
biggest struggles â€”to find my
career path.
TSD: What message do you want
your students to take away from
your achievements? Most recent
ly, your election?
QL: They need to persevere.
Sometimes there are ups and
downs in this career path. Good
support and good mentorship
will get you far. You have to love
it. Otherwise, it's more of a chore
than anything else. But if you love
to do something, stick with it.
