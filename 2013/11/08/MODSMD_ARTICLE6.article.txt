# Q&A QUYNH-THU LE
## CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY 
### JAMIE HELYAR 
Quynh-Thu Le, chair of
the Department of Radiation
Oncology and the Mc-
Cormick Memorial professor
at the Stanford School of
Medicine was recently elect
ed to the Institute of Medi
cine. Le has received national
attention for her research
which focuses on strengthen
ing the use of radiation treat
ment for head and neck can
cers.
The Daily sat down to talk
to Le about her research, her
patients and plans for her
new position in the Institute.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):
What is your research and
the goals of your research?
Quynh-Thu Le (QL): The
focus of my research is
around the areas of cancer I
treat, using radiation. There
are some tumors that re
spond very well to radia
tion, and some that blast
back at us. The question is:
Are there gene and protein
abnormalities that we
can we identify to deter
mine which tumors will re
spond to radiation and
which won't? One thing I've
been doing is looking at
biomarkers from tumors
and blood that might indi
cate how patients will re
spond to radiation.
TSD: What qualities do you
think distinguished you as
an attractive candidate to
the Institute?
QL: I chair a group of
physicians medical on

cologists, radiation oncolo
gists, surgeons and we
work for the National Can
cer Institute (NCI) to de
sign clinical trials that tack
le head and neck cancer.
These are big studies that
will hopefully change de
generative care. I also work
a lot with Asian countries
China, Hong Kong, Tai
wan, Singapore so
maybe my international
connection helped. Also, I
think I help to bring diversi
ty to the Institute, as a Viet
namese woman. I think this
is a great opportunity for
me to represent Asian-
American women.
TSD: You mentioned med
ical interest in Asia. Can you
elaborate on that?
QL: I grew up in Vietnam,
and I trained here. But my
interest has been in a type of
head and neck cancer that's
very heavily focused in Asia:
nasopharynx cancer. I
would love to be able to
learn how to develop radia
tion technologies right
now they're very expensive
that introduce new treat
ment options to Southeast
Asia in away that's afford
able for patients.
TSD: What do you hope to
contribute to the Institute?
QL: I would love to push to
the forefront the collabora
tions I have in developing
countries. I think that's a
strong interest: health out
side the United States. And
