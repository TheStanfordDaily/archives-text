## NPR to broadcast Stanford Symphony Orchestra show 
### ANDIE WATERMAN 
For the first time, National
Public Radio's "From the Top" pro
gram will record the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra. The show
will also feature several student
performers and young classical

musicians from around California.
The Nov. 10 performance sold
out to the general public this sum
mer, but some tickets are still
available for Stanford students to
purchase. Students and members
of the community can also hear the
broadcast on Dec. 2 on Classical

KDFC (104.9 FM in Palo Alto).
Although "From the Top" has
aired from Stanford before, this
will be the show's first collabora
tion with the orchestra.
The show airs on 250 stations
across the United States and is
heard by an estimated 700,000 lis

teners. The national scale of the
recording also fulfills the educa
tional mantra of Conductor Jin
dong Cai, noted Assistant Conduc
tor Anna Wittstruck, Ph.D. 'l5.
"He's brought people from all
over the world to us," Wittstruck
said. "And now it's our chance to
really sort of extend beyond the
Stanford Cardinal bubble, and be a
musical ensemble that is recog
nized."
Wittstruck noted that the na
tional exposure accompanies an
upward trend in the orchestra's
reputation after the opening of the
$111.9 million Bing Concert Hall
last January.
Cai observed this trend as well,
adding that before Bing opened
not that many people knew of the
orchestra's talent.
"Now we have this platform
[Bing] and people start noticing
we're good," Cai said.
The music director for "From
the Top," Tom Vignieri, said that
he worked hard to build a diverse
program that maximizes the new
hall's potential.
The Nov. 10 recording will fea
ture several performances by
young musicians before the finale
with the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra: the San Francisco Girls
Chorus; Chase Onodera, a 12-year
old guitarist from Sacramento;
David Yu, an 18-year-old pianist
from Los Angeles county; Youjin
Lee, an 18-year-old violinist from
Los Angeles; and a trio comprised
of two Stanford students and Lee.
As the show usually focuses on
performances from younger musi

cians, the college orchestra's in
volvement came as a last-minute
surprise.
"From the Top" first invited
Wittstruck who appeared on
the show when she was 13 years
old to appear again.
Wittstruck, a cellist, told the
show's agent that Cai had offered
to have the orchestra back up any
soloists on the show.
A few weeks later, "From the
Top" told Cai that the program's
host —pianist Christopher O'Ri
ley could perform a piece with
the orchestra.
O'Riley will play the "Presto"
from Ravel's "Piano Concerto in G
Major" a work he will perform
in its entirety with the Boston Phil
harmonic Youth Orchestra less
than a week after his appearance
at Stanford and again at Carnegie
Hall on Dec. 9.
"It's a fantastic virtuoso piece,"
Cai said.
But the orchestra won't be the
only ambassador of the Stanford
community on the radio pianist
Hugo Kitano 'l7 and Wittstruck,
both past performers on "From the
Top," along with Lee, will play the
energetic "Scherzo" from
Mendelssohn's first piano trio.
Added to the challenge of the
hall, whose resonance makes each
instrument in a small group espe
cially exposed, the group has never
met before. They will practice to
gether only once before the show,
at the Nov. 9 rehearsal.

looked forward to coming
up with a shared interpreta
tion of the music.
Wittstruck called it "a
perfect 'From the Top'
piece" which "really show
cases all three instruments,
particularly the piano, the
devilishly difficult piano
part."
Despite the piece's tech
nical demands, Kitano

looked forward to playing it,
praising the piece's witti
ness.
"A lot of times I feel like
classical musicians forget
about having a sense of hu
mor," he said.
Working with Stanford
Live the performing
arts organization which
presents shows at Bing and
around campus the
show has reached out to oth
er "From the Top" alumni at
Stanford, many of whom
play in the orchestra.
The program's alumni
may participate in activities

the day before the concert
including workshops on ap
plying musical leadership
skills in the world beyond
the concert hall, said tour
producer David Balsom.
He added that most mu
sicians on the show have
multiple interests.
"The idea was to show
case the fact that at a place
like Stanford you could be a
musician but you could also
be a student of something
else," Balsom said.

out to the general public this sum
mer, but some tickets are still
available for Stanford students to
purchase. Students and members
of the community can also hear the
broadcast on Dec. 2 on Classical

KDFC (104.9 FM in Palo Alto).
Although "From the Top" has
aired from Stanford before, this
will be the show's first collabora
tion with the orchestra.
The show airs on 250 stations
across the United States and is
heard by an estimated 700,000 lis

teners. The national scale of the
recording also fulfills the educa
tional mantra of Conductor Jin
dong Cai, noted Assistant Conduc
tor Anna Wittstruck, Ph.D. 'l5.
"He's brought people from all
over the world to us," Wittstruck
said. "And now it's our chance to
really sort of extend beyond the
Stanford Cardinal bubble, and be a
musical ensemble that is recog
nized."
Wittstruck noted that the na
tional exposure accompanies an
upward trend in the orchestra's
reputation after the opening of the
$111.9 million Bing Concert Hall
last January.
Cai observed this trend as well,
adding that before Bing opened
not that many people knew of the
orchestra's talent.
"Now we have this platform
[Bing] and people start noticing
we're good," Cai said.
The music director for "From
the Top," Tom Vignieri, said that
he worked hard to build a diverse
program that maximizes the new
hall's potential.
The Nov. 10 recording will fea
ture several performances by
young musicians before the finale
with the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra: the San Francisco Girls
Chorus; Chase Onodera, a 12-year
old guitarist from Sacramento;
David Yu, an 18-year-old pianist
from Los Angeles county; Youjin
Lee, an 18-year-old violinist from
Los Angeles; and a trio comprised
of two Stanford students and Lee.
As the show usually focuses on
performances from younger musi

cians, the college orchestra's in
volvement came as a last-minute
surprise.
"From the Top" first invited
Wittstruck who appeared on
the show when she was 13 years
old to appear again.
Wittstruck, a cellist, told the
show's agent that Cai had offered
to have the orchestra back up any
soloists on the show.
A few weeks later, "From the
Top" told Cai that the program's
host —pianist Christopher O'Ri
ley could perform a piece with
the orchestra.
O'Riley will play the "Presto"
from Ravel's "Piano Concerto in G
Major" a work he will perform
in its entirety with the Boston Phil
harmonic Youth Orchestra less
than a week after his appearance
at Stanford and again at Carnegie
Hall on Dec. 9.
"It's a fantastic virtuoso piece,"
Cai said.
But the orchestra won't be the
only ambassador of the Stanford
community on the radio pianist
Hugo Kitano 'l7 and Wittstruck,
both past performers on "From the
Top," along with Lee, will play the
energetic "Scherzo" from
Mendelssohn's first piano trio.
Added to the challenge of the
hall, whose resonance makes each
instrument in a small group espe
cially exposed, the group has never
met before. They will practice to
gether only once before the show,
at the Nov. 9 rehearsal.

The Stanford Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jindong Cai, rehearsed for a Nov. 10 performance which
will be recorded by National Public Radio's "From the Top," also featuring young California musicians.
looked forward to coming
up with a shared interpreta
tion of the music.
Wittstruck called it "a
perfect 'From the Top'
piece" which "really show
cases all three instruments,
particularly the piano, the
devilishly difficult piano
part."
Despite the piece's tech
nical demands, Kitano

looked forward to playing it,
praising the piece's witti
ness.
"A lot of times I feel like
classical musicians forget
about having a sense of hu
mor," he said.
Working with Stanford
Live the performing
arts organization which
presents shows at Bing and
around campus the
show has reached out to oth
er "From the Top" alumni at
Stanford, many of whom
play in the orchestra.
The program's alumni
may participate in activities

the day before the concert
including workshops on ap
plying musical leadership
skills in the world beyond
the concert hall, said tour
producer David Balsom.
He added that most mu
sicians on the show have
multiple interests.
"The idea was to show
case the fact that at a place
like Stanford you could be a
musician but you could also
be a student of something
else," Balsom said.
