45 carries for running back Tyler Gaffney
The senior sealed his place in Stanford lore with another Herculean effort in the biggest game this sea
son, setting the school record for carries in a game. Although Gaffney only averaged 3.5 yards per car
ry, he fought through contact and a stacked box of Oregon defenders to help the Cardinal celebrate
another victory over the Ducks. Gaffney only had one rush for negative yardage the entire night.
42:34 Time of possession by Stanford
Stanford knew coming into this contest with the Ducks that it would have to control the time of possession
in order to win. That strategy worked wonders on Thursday night, as the Ducks defense simply collapsed,
yielding 274 total rushing yards in the process.
punt by Stanford senior Ben Rhyne
After Stanford went three and out on its first possession, Rhyne's services would no longer be needed on
punts, due to superior offensive execution. Rhyne, however, played a big role in placing four great holds
on field goal attempts by senior kicker Jordan Williamson, corraling erratic snaps from sophomore Reed
Miller.
Number of teams Stanford needs to lose
Stanford emphatically established its hold on the Pac-12 North division lead. However, in order to have
a shot at a national championship, Stanford needs Ohio State, Baylor and Florida State losses. Ohio State
has a potential stumbling block on its schedule in the form of archrival Michigan, as well as the possibli
ty of facing a stout, defensive-oriented Michigan State squad in the Big Ten Championship Game. Flori
da State has a rivalry game on the road at Florida to end its season. Baylor still must head to Stillwater,
Okla., to face Oklahoma State.
