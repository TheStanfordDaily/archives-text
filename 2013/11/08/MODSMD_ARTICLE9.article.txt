# Cardiac Card can do the job
## 
### Sam Fisher 
For 50 minutes, the No. 5
Stanford Cardinal was the
best football team in the
country, and there really
wasn't anyone who could
come close.
And then, in classic Cardiac Car
dinal fashion, Stanford almost let
Oregon steal the game away. Thank
fully, senior wide receiver Jeff Trojan
didn't allow that to happen by recov
ering the last onside kick attempt.
I don't know how to fully describe
the range of emotions I felt through
out this game. For 50 minutes I was
stunned; nobody does to Oregon
what Stanford did. Then, for the final
10 minutes I lingered on the verge of
heart attack.
Only now, with a little bit of time
between the end of the game and sit
ting down to write, can I begin to ful
ly appreciate what we saw: near per
fection against one of the best teams
in all of college football. And the key
to the game was the Stanford of
fense I have to say I told you so.
It starts with the coaching staff.
We've complained about the offen
sive play calling for weeks now, and
then head coach David Shaw put
together a game plan that is literal
ly exactly what we asked for. Shaw
leaned on the run lyier Gaffney
set a Stanford single-game record
with 45 carries and wasn't
afraid to get creative in the run
ning game either.
We asked for junior quarter
back Kevin Hogan to take back the
read-option "Lloyd Package" with
senior running back Ricky Seale,
and that's exactly what we got.
Seale can be a game-changer, yet
he has been one of the most under
utilized players on the Cardinal
roster. Today those read-option
plays with Seale and the powerful
running of Hogan were huge on
third down.
We asked for Stanford to run
the ball on third-and-short and
that includes third-and-3 and
Shaw agreed. Stanford bullied the
Ducks all game long on the offen
sive line, and it was beautiful to
watch. I've never been more confi
dent in anything in my life than I
was in Stanford's ability to convert
on third-and-1 all night long.
And most of all, we asked for
Hogan to use his feet more, and he
came through in a performance
reminiscent of last year's win at
Autzen Stadium. Hogan wasn't per
fect throwing the ball, but that's not
entirely in his control. What is in
Hogan's control is his decision mak
ing, and Hogan was about as good
as we could ask for. He made great
reads, and most importantly he
knew when to bail and run.
While we're talking about
Hogan's decisions to run the foot
ball, how awesome was his tough
ness on those running plays? The
play where Hogan, while stum
bling, beat three defenders for a
first down was nothing short of
epic. He may have struggled for
the past few weeks, but Hogan re
deemed himself in the biggest way
Thursday night.
While today is for celebrating,
I'd be remiss to leave out what
comes next. Stanford football has a
24-hour rule you have 24 hours
to enjoy a win or wallow in sorrow
after a loss before you need to
move on. I have a two-hour rule, so
I'm already thinking about the
USC Trojans.
I must admit, I'm a bit nervous
about that game in the Coliseum,
because I know how much a loss
would hurt. Also, USC looks a lot
better since the unfortunate depar
ture of Stanford hero Lane Kiffin.
But what I will say is, for the first
time in a really long time, I whole
heartedly believe in Stanford foot
ball, and that is a great thing to
feel.
So as I get ready to sleep, I
can't help but think back to Bill
Plaschke's post-Rose Bowl column
and a quote from my interview
with Alex Fletcher 'OB for "Rags to
Roses." Though Fletcher was de
scribing a full movement and not a
specific game, this quote rings
true for last night's win: "Those
Stanford kids f***ing kicked the
shit out of the Pae-12. On tough
ness."
And now, after working until 3
a.m. or later every night this week
in the lead-up to the game, I can go
to bed with a smile on my face.

Sam Fisher can only smile when
he remembers telling his dad four
years ago that he hoped to go to one
BCS game in his four years at
Stanford. Share your joys with

I must admit, I'm a bit nervous
about that game in the Coliseum,
because I know how much a loss
would hurt. Also, USC looks a lot
better since the unfortunate depar
ture of Stanford hero Lane Kiffin.
But what I will say is, for the first
time in a really long time, I whole
heartedly believe in Stanford foot
ball, and that is a great thing to
feel.
So as I get ready to sleep, I
can't help but think back to Bill
Plaschke's post-Rose Bowl column
and a quote from my interview
with Alex Fletcher 'OB for "Rags to
Roses." Though Fletcher was de
scribing a full movement and not a
specific game, this quote rings
true for last night's win: "Those
Stanford kids f***ing kicked the
shit out of the Pae-12. On tough
ness."
And now, after working until 3
a.m. or later every night this week
in the lead-up to the game, I can go
to bed with a smile on my face.

Sam Fisher can only smile when
he remembers telling his dad four
years ago that he hoped to go to one
BCS game in his four years at
Stanford. Share your joys with
