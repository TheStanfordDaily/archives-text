We live in and through stories, and the
best ones can ground us and provide
abiding navigational tools throughout
our lives. How, though, do we identify
and live by these stories amid the clamor
of the news and the abundant chaos that
surrounds us? And how do we then
weave together the stories that guide us
with the stories that surround us?
Join us for a special evening with
, award-winning poet,
writer, and educator, to explore these
questions and to experience stories that
can invite us to live fuller lives.
