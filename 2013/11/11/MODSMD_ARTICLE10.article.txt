# STRONG START
## CARD HANGS ON TO WIN FIRST GAME 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team
opened its season with a 72-68 victory
over the Bucknell Bison on Friday
night, in front of a raucous Sixth Man
student section that was undoubtedly
still riding high from Thursday night's
football victory against Oregon. The
students also left this game content, as
the Cardinal (1-0) was able to hold off
the Bison (0-1) with some clutch three
point shooting down the stretch.

In a game that was close through
out, it was the timely shooting of senior
guards Aaron Bright and Anthony
Brown that proved to be the difference.
With the Cardinal leading by five with
7:03 remaining, Bright hit a three on a
kick-out from junior guard Chasson
Randle to give the Cardinal an eight
point advantage.
Bucknell a 28-win NCAA Tour
nament team from last season
showed its resilience and continued to
fight its way back into the game, nar
rowing the deficit to one with 4:24 re
maining after a three by guard Ryan
Frazier. After the two teams traded
points, Brown made the biggest shot of
the game on an inside-out pass from
senior center Stefan Nastic to give
Stanford a four-point advantage with
2:37 remaining. A layup by senior
Dwight Powell with 39 seconds left was
enough to seal the deal for the Cardinal,
which played good enough defense
down the stretch to preserve the victo
ry and offset some shaky free-throw
shooting in the final moments.
Stanford was led in the game by
Powell, who finished with 17 points, 12
rebounds and five assists on eight-of-17
shooting, and Randle, who contributed
