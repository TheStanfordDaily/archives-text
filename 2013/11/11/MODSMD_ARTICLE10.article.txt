# STRONG START
## CARD HANGS ON TO WIN FIRST GAME 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team
opened its season with a 72-68 victory
over the Bucknell Bison on Friday
night, in front of a raucous Sixth Man
student section that was undoubtedly
still riding high from Thursday night's
football victory against Oregon. The
students also left this game content, as
the Cardinal (1-0) was able to hold off
the Bison (0-1) with some clutch three
point shooting down the stretch.

In a game that was close through
out, it was the timely shooting of senior
guards Aaron Bright and Anthony
Brown that proved to be the difference.
With the Cardinal leading by five with
7:03 remaining, Bright hit a three on a
kick-out from junior guard Chasson
Randle to give the Cardinal an eight
point advantage.
Bucknell a 28-win NCAA Tour
nament team from last season
showed its resilience and continued to
fight its way back into the game, nar
rowing the deficit to one with 4:24 re
maining after a three by guard Ryan
Frazier. After the two teams traded
points, Brown made the biggest shot of
the game on an inside-out pass from
senior center Stefan Nastic to give
Stanford a four-point advantage with
2:37 remaining. A layup by senior
Dwight Powell with 39 seconds left was
enough to seal the deal for the Cardinal,
which played good enough defense
down the stretch to preserve the victo
ry and offset some shaky free-throw
shooting in the final moments.
Stanford was led in the game by
Powell, who finished with 17 points, 12
rebounds and five assists on eight-of-17
shooting, and Randle, who contributed

Senior foward Anthony Brown (left) made his presence felt in his return from last season's hip injury,
as the Cardinal held off several second-half rallies by Bucknell to win its 2013-14 season opener.
18 points on five-of-nine
shooting to go with four re
bounds and two assists. In
addition, Brown contributed
14 points, five rebounds and
some excellent perimeter de
fense in his first official game
since injuring his hip early last
season. He held Bucknell star
guard Cameron Ayers to 11
points on five-of-16 shooting.
"It felt great," Brown
said, "just going out there
and competing with my
teammates."
Coach Johnny Dawkins
was impressed with Brown's
effort. "He did what we want
ed him to do," Dawkins said,
"[which] is to be our stopper
on the perimeter."
Although Brown played
well individually, it was the
defensive end of the floor
that gave the Cardinal the
most trouble. The team par
ticularly struggled while
playing zone, a switch the
coaching staff made to com
bat the new hand-check rules
in place for this season
Regardless, it was ineffec
tive at times, a particularly
worrisome trend considering
the Cardinal was both bigger
and more athletic than the
Bison. Stanford registered
just one steal for the game
and turned Bucknell over a
paltry seven times. Bucknell
point guard Steven Kaspar
was extremely effective in his
role solving the zone, as he
tallied 12 points, nine assists
and seven rebounds. Indu
bitably, defensive awareness
will be a point of emphasis in
practice moving forward.
"[We've] got to study our
personnel better and be
ready to attack them on de
fense and take away what
they like to do from the
start," Powell said. "We have

to] be more active in our zone,
be more active in the full
court press."
Despite the uncomfort
ably close result, Stanford
fans can take heart in the fact
that the Cardinal was able to
pull out the close game, some
thing the team did not do well
a year ago. Last season, Stan
ford was just 6-12 in games
decided by single digits.
"We were in those situa
tions a number of times last
year, and we came up empty
a number of times," Dawkins
said. "So here's a night where
we're in the same situation,
and it's a four-point game for
us. So, to me, that shows im
provement. That shows our
guys are learning how to
close games."
The Cardinal will face an
other close game on Monday
night, when the BYU
Cougars (1-0) come to town
in the opening game of ESP-
N's Tip-Off Marathon. Stan
ford will look to shore up its
defense before it takes on the
Cougars, because sharp
shooter Tyler Haws and com
pany averaged 77.1 points
per game last season during
a 24-win season.

There was excitement
around the Stanford's men's
basketball program yester
day even before the team reg
istered the victory, as the
Cardinal received word that
five-star power forward re
cruit Reid Travis of Min
neapolis had committed to
the team. Travis who is
ranked by ESPN as the fifth
best power forward and the
23rd-best overall recruit in
next year's class —joins two
other Top-100 recruits, for
ward/center Michael Humphrey
of Phoenix and point guard
Robert Cartwright of La Cana
da, Calif., to form an exciting
core for the team's future.
