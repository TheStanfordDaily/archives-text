# ORRANGE YOU GLAD
## GUARD STARS IN OPENING WIN 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 Stanford women's
basketball team dominated on the
road this Saturday, defeating
Boston College 83-71 in the Cardi
nal's season opener.
Senior Chiney Ogwumike had
her third career 30-point game and
59th career double-double, while
junior point guard Amber Orrange
came alive after an average exhibi
tion game to score 19 points, dish
out 10 assists and grab a career
high nine rebounds to narrowly
miss out on a triple-double.

In addition, junior Bonnie
Samuelson returned to play action
after missing the Vanguard game
due to injury. She scored 15 points
in only 21 minutes of play. This
was the first collegiate game in
which the Samuelson sisters took
the court together; freshman Kar
lie Samuelson hit a three-point
shot in her collegiate debut.
Also kicking off their college
basketball careers were freshmen
Kailee Johnson, Erica McCall and
Lili Thompson. After standout
performances against Vanguard,
the newcomers didn't contribute
quite as much in this win, as they
did not receive nearly the same
amount of playing time as in the
exhibition. Sophomore Alex Green
had her first career start and
scored her first basket after miss
ing most of two seasons to injury.

With the return of Bonnie
Samuelson and returning starter
junior Sara James to the lineup af
ter being out with an injury, head
coach Tara VanDerveer didn't
need to sub as much as last Sun
day. As the freshmen gain confi
dence and more experience in
practice, their roles on the team
will likely increase they'll have
to if Stanford is to avoid depend
ency on Ogwumike and Orrange
as it did last year.
"Obviously, Chiney is a great
player and we need what she does,

but we need other people to do
more," VanDerveer told GoStan
ford. "Our returners really kind of
led the way, and they did a good
job."
The Card came out strong in
the first half, heading into half
time with a 44-24 lead. Boston Col
lege was able to make adjust
ments at halftime and ended up

outscoring the Card by eight in
the second half, but the 20-point
deficit was too much to overcome.
The Eagles' increase in shooting
percentage was what kept them in
the game, improving from .294 to
.520 between halves. The Card
dominated on the boards, though,
