## Road trip kind to Cardinal 
### JORDAN WALLACH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In what could have been two
trap matches for the No. 6 Stan
ford's women's volleyball team,
the Cardinal didn't blink follow
ing its grind-it-out win over
UCLA last Friday. It swept both
Colorado and Utah to start a
stretch of four consecutive road
matches, its longest such streak
of the conference season.

Friday's match saw the Car
dinal (18-5, 11-3 Pac-12) travel
to the Coors Events Center in
Boulder, Colo., where the Col
orado Buffaloes (15-9, 7-7) had
previously won all five of their
home conference matches
three of which came against
ranked opponents. The Buffs
had also won four of their last
five matches overall. Yet the
Card became the first team this
season to defeat Colorado on its
own court, winning 25-19,25-15,
25-20.
Stanford held the Buffs to a
season-low .085 hitting percent
age in the match. Junior outside
hitter Taylor Simpson, who en
tered the match ranked eighth
in the Pac-12 with 3.38 kills per
set, tallied 12 kills on Friday, but
she hit just .024 in the match
due to 11 attack errors on 41 to
tal attempts.
For the Card, sophomore
middle blocker Inky Ajanaku
had 10 kills and a team-high .667
hitting percentage. Senior mid
dle blocker Carly Wopat also
had 10 kills to go with a team
high five blocks, and senior out
side hitter Rachel Williams tal
lied eight kills and four blocks.
Though the Cardinal and
Buffaloes traded points early in
the first set up to a 9-9 score, a
four-point run on sophomore
