## Road trip kind to Cardinal 
### JORDAN WALLACH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In what could have been two
trap matches for the No. 6 Stan
ford's women's volleyball team,
the Cardinal didn't blink follow
ing its grind-it-out win over
UCLA last Friday. It swept both
Colorado and Utah to start a
stretch of four consecutive road
matches, its longest such streak
of the conference season.

Friday's match saw the Car
dinal (18-5, 11-3 Pac-12) travel
to the Coors Events Center in
Boulder, Colo., where the Col
orado Buffaloes (15-9, 7-7) had
previously won all five of their
home conference matches
three of which came against
ranked opponents. The Buffs
had also won four of their last
five matches overall. Yet the
Card became the first team this
season to defeat Colorado on its
own court, winning 25-19,25-15,
25-20.
Stanford held the Buffs to a
season-low .085 hitting percent
age in the match. Junior outside
hitter Taylor Simpson, who en
tered the match ranked eighth
in the Pac-12 with 3.38 kills per
set, tallied 12 kills on Friday, but
she hit just .024 in the match
due to 11 attack errors on 41 to
tal attempts.
For the Card, sophomore
middle blocker Inky Ajanaku
had 10 kills and a team-high .667
hitting percentage. Senior mid
dle blocker Carly Wopat also
had 10 kills to go with a team
high five blocks, and senior out
side hitter Rachel Williams tal
lied eight kills and four blocks.
Though the Cardinal and
Buffaloes traded points early in
the first set up to a 9-9 score, a
four-point run on sophomore

setter Madi Bugg's serve put Stan
ford up for good. The second set
wasn't much of a challenge either
for the Cardinal, as it outhit Col
orado .458 to .031, never surren
dering a lead in the set after 1-1.
The Buffs came out strong after
the intermission with a 10-3 run to
open the third set. After a Stanford
timeout, however, the Card won 11
of the next 15 points to tie the set at
14 six of the 11 points coming
from Colorado attack errors. Col
orado never regained momentum,
giving the Cardinal its 14th sweep
of the season.
Two days later, Stanford carried
its momentum into Salt Lake City
and swept the Utah Utes (17-9,6-8)
as well, 25-17, 25-15, 25-17.
In a battle between the top two
Pac-12 teams in blocking, it was
clear that the Cardinal game plan
was to keep the ball away from the
Utes' best blocker, senior middle
blocker Erin Redd-Brandon. She
entered Sunday's match leading
Utah with 1.43 blocks per set, the
best mark in the conference, just
ahead of Wopat (1.40).
Stanford, with a combination of
audible calling in transition, cross
court hitting and strong outside
play, was able to limit Redd-Bran

don to just three blocks total
with just one through the first two
sets.

The Cardinal defense, spurred
by a strong blocking performance
(nine total team blocks), continued
to dominate on Sunday, holding the
Utes to season-lows in kills (32)
and hitting percentage (.088).
Wopat led the team with six blocks,
and three other players tallied
three each. Offensively, Bugg set
up the Stanford attack with 33 as
sists, and Ajanaku hit a match-high
.643.
"Our passes have been awe
some," Ajanaku told Pac-12 Net
works after the match. "It's really
great to run an offense off passing
that's focused and driven the entire
time."
Ajanaku continues to improve
her offense over recent weeks, as
she's hitting .584 and averaging
3.00 kills per set over her last five
matches. In the 17 matches prior,
she hit .398 and averaged 2.36 kills
per set.
The Cardinal has just a few
days back in California before tak
ing on Oregon in Eugene at 6 p.m.
on Thursday and Oregon State in
Corvallis at 7 p.m. on Saturday
both rematches of Stanford sweeps
earlier this season. Thursday's
match will be televised on Pac-12
Networks.
