# OPINIONS
## Love Inc. 
### Alex Bayer 
As I was riding the London
tube last weekend, a sign
caught my eye. The caption
said, "From everyday essentials to
future spouse potentials," and
there were pictures of a bag of gro
ceries and a young couple in love. It
was an advertisement for a website
that combines all your favorite
shopping sites into one place, any
thing from a grocery shopping site
to Match.com.
It shouldn't be too surprising
that a dating site be grouped into
online shopping, but isn't a bit
weird, and fascinating, that love in
the 21st century is a commodified
process that works much the same
way as picking up some new clothes
or browsing through hotels? In all
these scenarios, we're consumers
browsing through a catalogue of
options, selecting what we like.
But just for a minute, back to
this idea of online dating, which I
find so intriguing. Because along
with giving us an aisle of options, it
also declaws relationship hunting of
the potential for rejection which
has been, up until now, par for the
course when it comes to love. If
someone isn't interested in us, we
simply don't hear back. But more
likely, we won't even have to experi
ence a despondent paramour; dat
ing sites are already engineered to
align people who are mathematical
ly likely to be attracted to each oth
er. Potential unrequited lovers sim
ply fall by the wayside.
As idyllic as it sounds, the more
I consider this paradigm, the more
I wonder: As we become more con
ditioned to being handed what we
like, what will happen to us when
life gives us a bad deck? If the lat
est wave of me-eentrie technology
primes us to think of ourselves as
consumers and all of life's offerings,
even love itself, as commodities we
can accrue with enough cash for an
eHarmony subscription, are we not
like the mortals, skewered by many
a Greek tragedy, who foolishly be
lieve they're in control of all the el
ements?
The 20-something sitting at the
helm of his iPhone (ordering take
out, summoning cabs, making
plans, all without a moving a mus
cle) exerts his power with effortless
ease; how could you not, when the
world rushes to your feet, think of
yourself as master of the universe?
Will we experience a similar fate
as our unfortunate Greek and
Shakespearian forerunners? Will
the gods (no doubt having a laugh
at our hubris) swoop in to remind
us who's really in control? For
whether if you believe in gods or a
universe governed solely by chance
and evolution, the conclusion they
lead us to is the same, though we
will always go to great lengths to

deny it: The workings of the uni
verse are out of our hands, unintel
ligible and, for all we know, indiffer
ent to us.
The more we think of ourselves
as consumers, the more blinded we
become to the truth: that we are
"merely players" upon the world's
stage who do a jig and then take
our exit so others can have their 15
minutes to dance in the limelight.
Alas, we're no more in control of
the desires of those we secretly
pine for than we are of the weather
but is it really "alas?"
If you had access to Cupid's bow
or a love potion, would you use it on
the one you wish would love you
back? As kids we may have said
yes, but, now that we've lived a bit,
I think we might hesitate. For
wouldn't that take out the friction,
the back and forth that makes its
reward all the more intensely intox
icating?
What would romantic comedies
be without misunderstandings,
foiled plans and missed signals?
Who would want to watch a film in
which Renee Zellweger and Hugh
Grant decide to become a couple in
the first five minutes? That isn't a
story, we would say. Love, in its raw
form, is a story. It is two uncertain
souls tepidly dancing around each
other, given to moments of courage
and lapses into fear, until one's
bravery to act aligns with the oth
er's bravery to fall in love, and the
rest is history. The road is rocky,
but in the end it is rechristened as
beautiful, and isn't that life too?
As I see it, there are two ways
we can live: with a false illusion of
power or with deep humility.
Though our sense of power may be
bolstered by the ease with we can
call up a taxi or have a half-baked
question answered in a heartbeat
by Yahoo! Answers, life at some
point or another will throw us a
monkey wrench and momentarily
make us feel as small and as power
less as Napoleon must have felt
when he was exiled from the king
dom that once seemed so unques
tionably, eternally his.
There is nothing wrong with en
joying the fruits of technology, but
as many a dethroned king has
learned the hard way, it's in our
best interest to keep our power in
perspective. Not just because we
may someday lose it, but because,
as with matters like love, there is
something to be said about leaving
it to the mysterious whims of the
gods. And just imagine: If we re
place a desire to have everything go
as we want it to with deep and sim
ple gratitude, the lows will look
beautiful even in real time.

rest is history. The road is rocky,
but in the end it is rechristened as
beautiful, and isn't that life too?
As I see it, there are two ways
we can live: with a false illusion of
power or with deep humility.
Though our sense of power may be
bolstered by the ease with we can
call up a taxi or have a half-baked
question answered in a heartbeat
by Yahoo! Answers, life at some
point or another will throw us a
monkey wrench and momentarily
make us feel as small and as power
less as Napoleon must have felt
when he was exiled from the king
dom that once seemed so unques
tionably, eternally his.
There is nothing wrong with en
joying the fruits of technology, but
as many a dethroned king has
learned the hard way, it's in our
best interest to keep our power in
perspective. Not just because we
may someday lose it, but because,
as with matters like love, there is
something to be said about leaving
it to the mysterious whims of the
gods. And just imagine: If we re
place a desire to have everything go
as we want it to with deep and sim
ple gratitude, the lows will look
beautiful even in real time.

As I was riding the London
tube last weekend, a sign
caught my eye. The caption
said, "From everyday essentials to
future spouse potentials," and
there were pictures of a bag of gro
ceries and a young couple in love. It
was an advertisement for a website
that combines all your favorite
shopping sites into one place, any
thing from a grocery shopping site
to Match.com.
It shouldn't be too surprising
that a dating site be grouped into
online shopping, but isn't a bit
weird, and fascinating, that love in
the 21st century is a commodified
process that works much the same
way as picking up some new clothes
or browsing through hotels? In all
these scenarios, we're consumers
browsing through a catalogue of
options, selecting what we like.
But just for a minute, back to
this idea of online dating, which I
find so intriguing. Because along
with giving us an aisle of options, it
also declaws relationship hunting of
the potential for rejection which
has been, up until now, par for the
course when it comes to love. If
someone isn't interested in us, we
simply don't hear back. But more
likely, we won't even have to experi
ence a despondent paramour; dat
ing sites are already engineered to
align people who are mathematical
ly likely to be attracted to each oth
er. Potential unrequited lovers sim
ply fall by the wayside.
As idyllic as it sounds, the more
I consider this paradigm, the more
I wonder: As we become more con
ditioned to being handed what we
like, what will happen to us when
life gives us a bad deck? If the lat
est wave of me-eentrie technology
primes us to think of ourselves as
consumers and all of life's offerings,
even love itself, as commodities we
can accrue with enough cash for an
eHarmony subscription, are we not
like the mortals, skewered by many
a Greek tragedy, who foolishly be
lieve they're in control of all the el
ements?
The 20-something sitting at the
helm of his iPhone (ordering take
out, summoning cabs, making
plans, all without a moving a mus
cle) exerts his power with effortless
ease; how could you not, when the
world rushes to your feet, think of
yourself as master of the universe?
Will we experience a similar fate
as our unfortunate Greek and
Shakespearian forerunners? Will
the gods (no doubt having a laugh
at our hubris) swoop in to remind
us who's really in control? For
whether if you believe in gods or a
universe governed solely by chance
and evolution, the conclusion they
lead us to is the same, though we
will always go to great lengths to

deny it: The workings of the uni
verse are out of our hands, unintel
ligible and, for all we know, indiffer
ent to us.
The more we think of ourselves
as consumers, the more blinded we
become to the truth: that we are
"merely players" upon the world's
stage who do a jig and then take
our exit so others can have their 15
minutes to dance in the limelight.
Alas, we're no more in control of
the desires of those we secretly
pine for than we are of the weather
but is it really "alas?"
If you had access to Cupid's bow
or a love potion, would you use it on
the one you wish would love you
back? As kids we may have said
yes, but, now that we've lived a bit,
I think we might hesitate. For
wouldn't that take out the friction,
the back and forth that makes its
reward all the more intensely intox
icating?
What would romantic comedies
be without misunderstandings,
foiled plans and missed signals?
Who would want to watch a film in
which Renee Zellweger and Hugh
Grant decide to become a couple in
the first five minutes? That isn't a
story, we would say. Love, in its raw
form, is a story. It is two uncertain
souls tepidly dancing around each
other, given to moments of courage
and lapses into fear, until one's
bravery to act aligns with the oth
er's bravery to fall in love, and the
rest is history. The road is rocky,
but in the end it is rechristened as
beautiful, and isn't that life too?
