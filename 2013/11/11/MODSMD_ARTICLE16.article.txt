## Not So Absent 
### Kevin Rouff 
You've all heard the line that
these university years will be
"the best of your lives." If this
is so, then we have a sadly short
amount of time to enjoy ourselves. Is
this what you'd imagined for your
"best"?

Deciding what the university expe
rience should and could be is a long,
convoluted track that requires a lot of
stumbling, and the drunkard's walk is
sometimes more beneficial than a
whey-fueled sprint forward.

What I mean is, if you are unsure
of what you want to gain from your
time here, then take your damn time.
Rushing through these years will
only stress, strain and strip your en
thusiasm and morale. If you need
time to choose, to breathe, to mull
things over, take it.
Over and over again, I listen to re
cent graduates telling me they wish
they had taken their time with a
"leave of absence" to pursue a pas
sion, try out life in a new city or sim
ply to work from home and take a
breather. They advise me to enjoy
my time, but the truth of the matter
is that the time does not necessarily
have to be spent here.
Rather, it is this specific period in
our lives that we should take advan
tage of, one that is youthful and de
tached from the weight of daily com
muting, endless bills, household man
agement, work tensions and so on.
There are countless opportunities
to take advantage with some time
away, and the leave can be beneficial
to your academic/social life upon re
turn. We are presented on a quarter
ly basis (at the least) with decisions
that demand a goal (the "major"), a
specific interest (the "minor") or sim
ple curiosity, and it is difficult to be
fully assured in our decisions even
with these. Why shoot into the dark
hesitantly with your classes and with
your self identity when you can actu
ally try out your area of interest for
some time?
Leave of absence is daunting to
some due to the word "absence."
Some students say that you'll lose
your social circles, you'll fall behind
in classes or you'll lose the drive, but

none of these are actually true. I'll
avoid being grim with the thought
that this may be beneficial as a filter
ing process but rather assure you
that these suspicions are all false.
You will not "fall behind" or subli
mate from Stanford's mind you
will not be very absent at all. Young
fresh minds don't forget faces that
quickly, nor will you lose your aca
demic groove.
If anything, your experiences
away will complement your studies,
less directly than indirectly by virtue
of a revamped drive and renewed cu
riosity.
And your friends? Think of it this
way: after being tested by absence,
you and your Mends might value each
other's presence more than before
(and the filter idea holds here —you'll
lose some, but... well, you get it).
Clearly not everybody needs a
leave, but in no way should students
be intimidated by the leave as a sign
of resignation or because it could re
sult in irrevocable absence.
Some truly have no desire or see
no point to interrupting the four-year
flow, and they can easily justify why
they are marching through their
prime time. Though I still think they
could benefit from a step away from
the always green and always
trimmed lawns we wallow around in,
to taste some other flavors beyond
those of Coupa, I cannot say
"should".
But others may not quite under
stand where they stand within these
four years, and they may feel swept
beneath the torrent of the time mov
ing over them.
These students should take a mo
ment to get away holding lights on
a film set, shuffling among the cubi
cles of a large corporation or among
the tables of cafes, lugging a rack
sack around the world or a briefcase
on the daily commute, writing on
chalkboards for a classroom of eager
eyes or on the keyboards of some
newsroom, working with an NGO or
GO, digging in the fields of a
WWOOF farm or in the pages of a li
brary, mixing liquids in a lab or bar,
hootin' and hollerin' in some band or
at some activist demonstration or
simply being with one's family or
alone with oneself—to experience
something other than the life that
has been neatly presented to them,
something that could all ameliorate
these "best years."
Besides all of this, well, you could
take a breather and let these years
last just a moment longer.

newsroom, working with an NGO or
GO, digging in the fields of a
WWOOF farm or in the pages of a li
brary, mixing liquids in a lab or bar,
hootin' and hollerin' in some band or
at some activist demonstration or
simply being with one's family or
alone with oneself—to experience
something other than the life that
has been neatly presented to them,
something that could all ameliorate
these "best years."
Besides all of this, well, you could
take a breather and let these years
last just a moment longer.

You've all heard the line that
these university years will be
"the best of your lives." If this
is so, then we have a sadly short
amount of time to enjoy ourselves. Is
this what you'd imagined for your
"best"?

Deciding what the university expe
rience should and could be is a long,
convoluted track that requires a lot of
stumbling, and the drunkard's walk is
sometimes more beneficial than a
whey-fueled sprint forward.

What I mean is, if you are unsure
of what you want to gain from your
time here, then take your damn time.
Rushing through these years will
only stress, strain and strip your en
thusiasm and morale. If you need
time to choose, to breathe, to mull
things over, take it.
Over and over again, I listen to re
cent graduates telling me they wish
they had taken their time with a
"leave of absence" to pursue a pas
sion, try out life in a new city or sim
ply to work from home and take a
breather. They advise me to enjoy
my time, but the truth of the matter
is that the time does not necessarily
have to be spent here.
Rather, it is this specific period in
our lives that we should take advan
tage of, one that is youthful and de
tached from the weight of daily com
muting, endless bills, household man
agement, work tensions and so on.
There are countless opportunities
to take advantage with some time
away, and the leave can be beneficial
to your academic/social life upon re
turn. We are presented on a quarter
ly basis (at the least) with decisions
that demand a goal (the "major"), a
specific interest (the "minor") or sim
ple curiosity, and it is difficult to be
fully assured in our decisions even
with these. Why shoot into the dark
hesitantly with your classes and with
your self identity when you can actu
ally try out your area of interest for
some time?
Leave of absence is daunting to
some due to the word "absence."
Some students say that you'll lose
your social circles, you'll fall behind
in classes or you'll lose the drive, but

none of these are actually true. I'll
avoid being grim with the thought
that this may be beneficial as a filter
ing process but rather assure you
that these suspicions are all false.
You will not "fall behind" or subli
mate from Stanford's mind you
will not be very absent at all. Young
fresh minds don't forget faces that
quickly, nor will you lose your aca
demic groove.
If anything, your experiences
away will complement your studies,
less directly than indirectly by virtue
of a revamped drive and renewed cu
riosity.
And your friends? Think of it this
way: after being tested by absence,
you and your Mends might value each
other's presence more than before
(and the filter idea holds here —you'll
lose some, but... well, you get it).
Clearly not everybody needs a
leave, but in no way should students
be intimidated by the leave as a sign
of resignation or because it could re
sult in irrevocable absence.
Some truly have no desire or see
no point to interrupting the four-year
flow, and they can easily justify why
they are marching through their
prime time. Though I still think they
could benefit from a step away from
the always green and always
trimmed lawns we wallow around in,
to taste some other flavors beyond
those of Coupa, I cannot say
"should".
But others may not quite under
stand where they stand within these
four years, and they may feel swept
beneath the torrent of the time mov
ing over them.
These students should take a mo
ment to get away holding lights on
a film set, shuffling among the cubi
cles of a large corporation or among
the tables of cafes, lugging a rack
sack around the world or a briefcase
on the daily commute, writing on
chalkboards for a classroom of eager
eyes or on the keyboards of some
newsroom, working with an NGO or
GO, digging in the fields of a
WWOOF farm or in the pages of a li
brary, mixing liquids in a lab or bar,
