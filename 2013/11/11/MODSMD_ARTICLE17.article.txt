Stanford men's soccer (8-6-3, 2-
5-2 Pac-12) continued its efforts to
secure a berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment over the past weekend on its
trip through the Pacific Northwest.
Though the Cardinal fell to the No.
3 Washington Huskies (13-1-4, 6-1-
2), it rebounded with a victory over
conference cellar-dweller Oregon
State (7-9-2,0-7-2).
The three points secured from
the weekend's fixture keep the Car
dinal in the hunt for an at-large bid,
and the rebound victory will certain
ly help the team's confidence ahead
of its final game against Bay Area
rival No. 4 Cal (12-3-2, 6-2-1).

The road trip opened with anoth
er tough loss for the Card, all of
whose losses have come at the hands
of top-five teams. In what was a
very testy and physical game fea
turing 28 fouls, Washington ended
up coming away with a comfortable
2-0 victory, keyed by freshman for
ward Mason Robertson's header
goal in the 30th minute and sopho
more defender lan Lange's goal late
in the game.
Overall, the game had few shots
end up on target for either side, but
Washington made the most of the
limited chances. Stanford continued
its trend of near misses, with senior
midfielder JJ Koval driving one
wide and freshman forward Jordan
Morris heading just over the bar af
ter a Stanford cross. The loss once
again showed that Stanford is able
to compete with the best teams in
the country but has not been able to
finish on key chances.
Only two days after the loss,
Stanford traveled down to Corvallis,
Ore., to play the Beavers in a game
that approached must-win status for
