## Streak grows in SoCal 
### LUKE ASPERGER 
Ever since taking down
No. 2 UCLA three weeks
ago, the Stanford men's wa
ter polo team has not looked
back, riding its stellar defense
and powerful offense to a sev
en-game winning streak. This
weekend the success contin
ued for the No. 4 Cardinal
(17-4, 5-1 MPSF) as it
cruised through its road trip
to Southern California with
wins against UC-Irvine,
Chapman University and
Long Beach State.

Stanford opened the
weekend on Friday night by
rolling over No. 8 UC-Irvine
18-6. The Anteaters (12-10,0-
5 MPSF) jumped onto the
scoreboard early when Lar
son Pfeil scored after a Stan
ford ejection. However, the
Card bounced right back
with a goal of its own when

freshman Jackson Kimbell
scored two minutes later af
ter a UCI ejection.
Freshman Charlie Wiser
put Stanford temporarily
ahead with a goal a minute
later, but a goal from Kyle
Trush helped the Anteaters
pull even for the last time.
The Stanford exploded with a
barrage of goals, and, a
minute into the second peri
od, the Card held a 7-2 lead.
UCI did not give in, scor
ing three more goals before
the end of the half, but the
Anteater defense could not
hold off the Stanford offense,
which opened the second half
with a 7-0 run to ensure the
victory.
Sophomore Bret Bonanni,
who entered the weekend as
the MPSF scoring leader, led
the Cardinal offense with
four goals. Sophomore BJ
Churnside scored a hat trick,
while four of his teammates
added two goals apiece.
Freshman goalie Drew Hol
land racked up 10 saves as
the defense continued to
shine.

On Saturday afternoon,
Stanford tore apart Chap
man University (7-9,4-3 SCI
AC) to cruise to a 24-7 win.
The Cardinal scored early
and often, and, by the time
the final whistle was blown,
12 different Cardinal players
had racked up at least one
goal.
Stanford got an early 3-0
lead in the first quarter with
goals from Kimbell, junior
Alex Bowen and junior Con
ner Cleary. The Panthers
managed to claw their way
back into the game with a
pair of goals that cut the lead
to 4-2, but sophomore Adam
Abdulhamid and senior Nick
Hoversten scored to finish
the first period with a 6-2
Cardinal lead.
Brett Carter opened the
second quarter by netting his
second goal of the game for
Chapman, but Kimbell and
Rudolph answered with two
goals each to extend the lead
to 10-3. By halftime, Stanford
led 14-5.
The Cardinal defense
shut down the Panther of
fense in the second half, hold
ing Chapman to only two
goals while the Stanford of
fense ran up the score with
10 more goals.
Kimbell paced the offense
with four goals, while Abdul
hamid and Rudolph each
added hat tricks.
After its two resounding
victories on Friday and Sat
urday, the Cardinal faced a
more difficult test in a nail
biter against No. 8 Long
Beach State. After four quar
ters of nearly even play, the
