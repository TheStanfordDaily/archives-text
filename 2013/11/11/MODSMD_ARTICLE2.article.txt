## VPUE adds leadership program Seminar for juniors will augment summer offerings 
### ELENA WADDEN 
Starting next September, the
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education (VPUE) will launch a
new three-week leadership pro
gram for students entering their
junior year.
The program which will add
to the September Studies program
offerings that already include
Sophomore College and Arts Inten
siveâ€” aims to develop leadership
skills among rising juniors through
a tailored curriculum, residential
component and a faculty leader to
facilitate mentoring relationships
with students in the course.
"The goals are to really help
juniors think proactively about
what it means to be a leader and
why that's important," said Vice
Provost Harry Elam.
Elam added the program was
part of a larger goal to create a
September Studies program in
tended for juniors.
"We didn't really have anything
targeted at juniors," Elam said. He
said he hopes the program will "re
ally be something that students
look forward to in their junior year
before they come back to school."
Lisa Bilgen, associate director
of the new program, said that pop
ular demand for a program cater
ing to juniors with a focus on lead
ership also contributed to the ra
tionale behind launching the new
offering.
