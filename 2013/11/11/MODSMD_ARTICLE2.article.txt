## VPUE adds leadership program Seminar for juniors will augment summer offerings 
### ELENA WADDEN 
Starting next September, the
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education (VPUE) will launch a
new three-week leadership pro
gram for students entering their
junior year.
The program which will add
to the September Studies program
offerings that already include
Sophomore College and Arts Inten
siveâ€” aims to develop leadership
skills among rising juniors through
a tailored curriculum, residential
component and a faculty leader to
facilitate mentoring relationships
with students in the course.
"The goals are to really help
juniors think proactively about
what it means to be a leader and
why that's important," said Vice
Provost Harry Elam.
Elam added the program was
part of a larger goal to create a
September Studies program in
tended for juniors.
"We didn't really have anything
targeted at juniors," Elam said. He
said he hopes the program will "re
ally be something that students
look forward to in their junior year
before they come back to school."
Lisa Bilgen, associate director
of the new program, said that pop
ular demand for a program cater
ing to juniors with a focus on lead
ership also contributed to the ra
tionale behind launching the new
offering.

pressed interest in the new pro

focusing on leadership skills
prompted its launch.
unteachable things like design
thinking," Gulati said. "So I would
definitely be interested to see how
they construct a program that fo
cuses on leadership."
According to Bilgen, the pro
gram focuses on general leadership
and "digging really deep into your
self around your own leadership
skills."
"It's going to require some
bravery," Bilgen said. "Students
are going to have to be open and
willing to look at their own leader
ship style, their own skills and abil
ities and kind of examine them and
work on them in front of others."
Al Camarillo, professor of histo
ry, will collaborate with VPUE as
faculty director of the program and
help implement the leadership pro
gram for the first year.
"My vision for it is to provide an
intensive seminar exchange, en
gaging intellectual environments
where students are going to be in
fused with the curriculum about
leadership," Camarillo said. "In a
nutshell, it is to give juniors a
springboard to both understanding

the nature of leadership and the
practice of leadership."
Bilgen added that faculty from a
wide array of programs, including
the Haas Center for Public Serv
ice, the Woods Institute for the En
vironment and the Stanford Tech
nology Ventures Program, among
others, have expressed significant
interest in the new program.
Faculty from these institutions
will be involved by giving guest lec
tures to demonstrate what leader
ship looks like in their diverse
fields.
The program will also involve
faculty representing all three un
dergraduate schools as well as the

graduate schools of law, education,
business and medicine.
Another attractive feature of
the program is its continuation be
yond its three-week length in Sep
tember.
Students have the option of con
tinuing the three-week program
through weekly seminars during
the academic school year for which
they can get course credit, in addi
tion to monthly events. Further
more, the program will even offer
10 students grants if they have a
project that they are committed to
pursuing based on their experi
ences in the program.
Following the program, Bilgen
will continue working with stu
dents throughout the year to help
them craft their leadership path.
"My goal is to be a resource to
the student as they decide on their
pathways," Bilgen said.
Camarillo said the program was
a long time in the making.
"This is an idea Fve wanted to
develop for the undergraduate cur
riculum for a long time," he said. "I
have a vision of it being one of the
most dynamic experiences a stu
dent can engage in here at Stan
ford."
