# FoCUS tackles security policy
## U.S.- Mexico student group draws dignitaries to campus summit 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD DESK EDITOR 
"To me immigration is a sign of change, and
what we are experiencing in this country right
now if you are observing what is going in the
civic life of the United States is what I be
lieve, dramatic change," said Congressman
Xavier Becerra 'BO J.D. 'B4 to 30 student dele
gates in the closing summit of the U.S.- Mexico
Forum for Cooperation, Understanding and

Solidarity (FoCUS) conference.
The U.S.-Mexico FoCUS conference con
cluded Saturday afternoon as part of a four-day
event featuring speakers such as George
Shultz, the 60th U.S. Secretary of State, and
Eduardo Medina Mora, Mexico Ambassador to
the United States.
Delegates engaged in group project work
shops, speaker panels and dialogue sessions
surrounding the theme of improving bilateral
relations between the United States and

Mexico.
FoCUS was founded last year by Jorge
Olarte 'l3 and Alejandro Navarro, a student
from the Institute Tecnologico Autonomo de
Mexico (ITAM) university. The cross-national
group held a primary conference in April in
Mexico City and the closing summit this past
weekend at Stanford. Student delegates from
various U.S. and Mexican universities were
able to attend the closing summit.
"We began with the idea sum
mer of last year when we wanted to
make a little conference for people
to talk about issues of Mexico and
the drug trade and issues like that
because there was almost no con
versation at all about U.S. and
Mexico at Stanford," Olarte said.
"We thought at the beginning
that it was a really small idea, but
then we began talking to faculty at
Stanford, and they really pushed
us to think big and go beyond a
one-day conference," he added.
The FoCUS conference was
loosely modeled on the Forum for
American/Chinese Exchange at
Stanford (FACES) and the Ameri
can Middle Eastern Network for
Dialogue at Stanford (AMENDS)
both multi-cultural conference
models dedicated to promoting
awareness of international, politi
cal and cultural issues and global
relations.
Yet what's unique about FoCUS
is its partnership with one of the
top universities in Mexico, ITAM,
where the Mexico delegation is

based.
Delegates were split into collab
orative teams in January and
worked on themed policy-con
structing projects between the
April conference and the Stanford
summit. On Nov. 9, they presented
their work to a panel of experts and
audience.
Mexican delegate Andrea
Conde hopes that her team uses
the work they produced to affect
real-life international policy.
"My team was a security team,
and we want to get our working pa
per published," Conde said. "We
are probably going to talk to aca
demics and send our working draft.
We also have emails of politicans to
get feedback on practical things."
Anna Hillary, a U.S. delegate
studying as a grad student at New
York University, also had similar
ambitions for what she wanted to
take away from the conference.
"We're really just hoping to in
fluence policy," Hillary said. "It's a
really nice forum for us to be heard
and to put forth our ideas on how
the security strategy should look
between the U.S. and Mexico and
how different aspects of the rela
tionship should look."
Hillary, Conde and Olarte all
emphasized the importance of the
close relationships that they
formed throughout the program.
"It's like seeing old friends, but
we also have a really nice profes
sional relationship," Hillary said.
With regards to the future,
Olarte expressed his enthusiasm
regarding the fast growth of the
FoCUS program in such a short
amount of time and hopes the net
work will continue.
"It's really creating this bridge
between students from both coun
tries and this group of students
with the people who are changing
our countries right now," Olarte
said.
"We want to be part of the dia
logue, and we're starting to," he
added.
This year, the main themes of
the conference included security is
sues, immigration and other broad
er aspects of the relationship be
tween the United States and Mexi
co.
For next year's conference,
Olarte and Navarro hope to hold
the same events, including the con
ference in Mexico City in April, but
with a focus on business, trade and
economics.
