## Quidditch conjures up more interest Team recruits atheletes, strives to qualify for World Cup 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC 
Though the sport's origins lie in a
fantasy world, Stanford's Quidditch
team draws its success from athletic
commitment, not magic.
Hailey Clonts 'l6, team captain,
said that the team has grown in size
and intensity over the last two years.
"Not last year, but the year before,
the team was pretty small and didn't
have people coming regularly," she
said. "Last year we had a bigger team,
but mostly freshmen. Now we have re
turning players plus new freshmen."
One freshman, Zebediah Martin
'l7, joined the team at his cousin's urg
ing.
"I read all of the books, watched all
of the movies, and I really like Harry
Potter, but I originally wasn't going to
join," he said. But he soon fell in love
with the game.
As a contact sport, Quidditch is
more physical than most people ex
pect, said Martin, who plays the posi
tion of chaser.
It's also more competitive than
some might expect.
This year, the team hopes to qualify
for the Quidditch World Cup again af
ter a successful run last year at tour
naments in Los Angeles, Sacramento,
Berkeley and Florida.
To accomplish this goal, the team
practices every Saturday, Sunday and
Thursday on Wilbur Field, performing
drills and running through plays.
"We start off throwing while every
one gets here and then, when most
people are here, we run around the
field," Clonts said. "Then we'll do dy
namics where we do high knees, butt
kicks, those kind of things."
Every first practice gives new play
ers a chance to test their skills on the
field.
"We throw them into a game situa
tion for the very first practice," Clonts
added. "It's chaotic, but they get the
hang of it."
