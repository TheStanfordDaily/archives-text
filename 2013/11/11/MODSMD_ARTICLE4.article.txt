## Quidditch conjures up more interest Team recruits atheletes, strives to qualify for World Cup 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC 
Though the sport's origins lie in a
fantasy world, Stanford's Quidditch
team draws its success from athletic
commitment, not magic.
Hailey Clonts 'l6, team captain,
said that the team has grown in size
and intensity over the last two years.
"Not last year, but the year before,
the team was pretty small and didn't
have people coming regularly," she
said. "Last year we had a bigger team,
but mostly freshmen. Now we have re
turning players plus new freshmen."
One freshman, Zebediah Martin
'l7, joined the team at his cousin's urg
ing.
"I read all of the books, watched all
of the movies, and I really like Harry
Potter, but I originally wasn't going to
join," he said. But he soon fell in love
with the game.
As a contact sport, Quidditch is
more physical than most people ex
pect, said Martin, who plays the posi
tion of chaser.
It's also more competitive than
some might expect.
This year, the team hopes to qualify
for the Quidditch World Cup again af
ter a successful run last year at tour
naments in Los Angeles, Sacramento,
Berkeley and Florida.
To accomplish this goal, the team
practices every Saturday, Sunday and
Thursday on Wilbur Field, performing
drills and running through plays.
"We start off throwing while every
one gets here and then, when most
people are here, we run around the
field," Clonts said. "Then we'll do dy
namics where we do high knees, butt
kicks, those kind of things."
Every first practice gives new play
ers a chance to test their skills on the
field.
"We throw them into a game situa
tion for the very first practice," Clonts
added. "It's chaotic, but they get the
hang of it."

Stanford Quidditch players practice on Saturday at Wilbur Field. The team, which hopes to qualify for
the Quidditch World Cup this year, practices drills and plays every Sunday, Thursday and Sunday.
Many team members played
multiple sports in the past. Martin
played soccer, track and tennis in
high school, while Clonts played
netball and gymnastics.
"A variety of sports lend them
selves to different positions and dif
ferent skill sets," said Coach Natal
ie Stottler 'l4 of players' athletic
backgrounds.
During gameplay there are
three chasers, two beaters, one
keeper and one seeker. Players

with experience in sports like soc
cer and basketball are well-suited
for the position of chaser, as it en
tails running up and down the field
and scoring with the quaffle a
volleyball.
On defense, beaters throw dodge
balls at players to prevent them from
scoring. Given that one hand must be
on the broom at any one point, one
handed throwing skills from water po
lo are also useful.
Keepers, though involved in de
fense like goalies, are similar to quar
terbacks in that they dictate offen
sive quaffle play as well, said David
Saltzman M.S. 'l4, who played keep
er last year.
Given how unique the sport is,

Stottler said that the team is mostly
looking for students with a willing
ness to learn.
"We've taken people who don't
really have an athletic background,
and our goal is to help people become
confident athletically," Stottler said.
The sport isn't all work though,
with tournaments providing an es
cape from the academic rigor of
Stanford.
"It's a lot of fun going some
where, and it takes you out of the
regular academic environment,"
Saltzman said. "Even if it's just a
weekend tournament, still when you
come back it feels like you were just
on a vacation."
Stottler said her favorite moment

as a player happened last year when
the Stanford team beat USC in Los
Angeles, ending the Trojans' 10-
month winning streak. The snitch, a
tennis ball in a sock trailing from a
gold-painted cross-country runner
or wrestler, was caught outside of the
Quidditch pitch boundaries, a rare
occurrence that ended the game in
Stanford's favor.
"We were beyond the underdog,
and somehow won that game and
ended [USC's] undefeated streak,"
Stottler said.
She still has the match score
board on her wall.

the team was pretty small and didn't
have people coming regularly," she
said. "Last year we had a bigger team,
but mostly freshmen. Now we have re
turning players plus new freshmen."
One freshman, Zebediah Martin
'l7, joined the team at his cousin's urg
ing.
"I read all of the books, watched all
of the movies, and I really like Harry
Potter, but I originally wasn't going to
join," he said. But he soon fell in love
with the game.
As a contact sport, Quidditch is
more physical than most people ex
pect, said Martin, who plays the posi
tion of chaser.
It's also more competitive than
some might expect.
This year, the team hopes to qualify
for the Quidditch World Cup again af
ter a successful run last year at tour
naments in Los Angeles, Sacramento,
Berkeley and Florida.
To accomplish this goal, the team
practices every Saturday, Sunday and
Thursday on Wilbur Field, performing
drills and running through plays.
"We start off throwing while every
one gets here and then, when most
people are here, we run around the
field," Clonts said. "Then we'll do dy
namics where we do high knees, butt
kicks, those kind of things."
Every first practice gives new play
ers a chance to test their skills on the
field.
"We throw them into a game situa
tion for the very first practice," Clonts
added. "It's chaotic, but they get the
hang of it."

Stanford Quidditch players practice on Saturday at Wilbur Field. The team, which hopes to qualify for
the Quidditch World Cup this year, practices drills and plays every Sunday, Thursday and Sunday.
Many team members played
multiple sports in the past. Martin
played soccer, track and tennis in
high school, while Clonts played
netball and gymnastics.
"A variety of sports lend them
selves to different positions and dif
ferent skill sets," said Coach Natal
ie Stottler 'l4 of players' athletic
backgrounds.
During gameplay there are
three chasers, two beaters, one
keeper and one seeker. Players

with experience in sports like soc
cer and basketball are well-suited
for the position of chaser, as it en
tails running up and down the field
and scoring with the quaffle a
volleyball.
On defense, beaters throw dodge
balls at players to prevent them from
scoring. Given that one hand must be
on the broom at any one point, one
handed throwing skills from water po
lo are also useful.
Keepers, though involved in de
fense like goalies, are similar to quar
terbacks in that they dictate offen
sive quaffle play as well, said David
Saltzman M.S. 'l4, who played keep
er last year.
Given how unique the sport is,

Stottler said that the team is mostly
looking for students with a willing
ness to learn.
"We've taken people who don't
really have an athletic background,
and our goal is to help people become
confident athletically," Stottler said.
The sport isn't all work though,
with tournaments providing an es
cape from the academic rigor of
Stanford.
"It's a lot of fun going some
where, and it takes you out of the
regular academic environment,"
Saltzman said. "Even if it's just a
weekend tournament, still when you
come back it feels like you were just
on a vacation."
Stottler said her favorite moment

as a player happened last year when
the Stanford team beat USC in Los
Angeles, ending the Trojans' 10-
month winning streak. The snitch, a
tennis ball in a sock trailing from a
gold-painted cross-country runner
or wrestler, was caught outside of the
Quidditch pitch boundaries, a rare
occurrence that ended the game in
Stanford's favor.
"We were beyond the underdog,
and somehow won that game and
ended [USC's] undefeated streak,"
Stottler said.
She still has the match score
board on her wall.

Though the sport's origins lie in a
fantasy world, Stanford's Quidditch
team draws its success from athletic
commitment, not magic.
Hailey Clonts 'l6, team captain,
said that the team has grown in size
and intensity over the last two years.
"Not last year, but the year before,
the team was pretty small and didn't
have people coming regularly," she
said. "Last year we had a bigger team,
but mostly freshmen. Now we have re
turning players plus new freshmen."
