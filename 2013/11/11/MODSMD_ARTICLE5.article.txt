## PAULINA BORSOOK ARTIST-IN-RESIDENCE 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the past month, writer and jour
nalist Paulina Borsook has been working
as an artist-in-residenee at Stanford on
her new art installation project, "My
Life as a Ghost," which integrates video,
performance, sound and other media in
to a built environment. The project is
based on the traumatic brain injury
(TBI) she suffered after being shot in
the head at the age of 14.
Borsook is the first to join the Stan
ford Arts Institute's new Research Res
idency program and will be on campus
working on her project until Nov. 15.
She recently sat down with The Daily to
discuss her personal history and how
this, among other factors, has inspired
and shaped her project.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is a
traumatic brain injury ghost, in your
own words? How did your personal ex
periences help in defining that term?
Paulina Borsook (PB): There just hap
pened to be a notice in [a] Santa Cruz
newspaper about this group of people
for TBI, and the group reporter had
TBI, and she had this whole list of symp
toms, and I gasped as I thought, "That
looks really familiar."
So, I went to this group, and every
body told their story. This guy stood up
and talked about his TBI, and every
thing about it was different than mine.
Then he turned and looked at the group
and said, "I don't know why I'm still
here." I gasped because that's what I
had felt ever since I was shot in the
head. I saw two or three other people in

this group of 20 nodding their heads.
So I had this flash. I had thought,
ever since I was 14, that the fact that I
always go to that place was one more
thing that was wrong with me. Now, I
find out that that's neurological, and
that it's a neurological artifact for some
people with traumatic brain injury.
Something gets dislocated in the sense
of knowing that you belong to yourself
and your life, and it's an artifact of the
injury.
So you can ask yourself, "I don't
know why I'm still here." You feel partly
elsewhere, and where are you in that
partly elsewhere and what is it to
have that fundamental union between
self and body is a little bit disjunctive.
To me, that's what I mean by a ghost.
