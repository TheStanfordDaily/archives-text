## PAULINA BORSOOK ARTIST-IN-RESIDENCE 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the past month, writer and jour
nalist Paulina Borsook has been working
as an artist-in-residenee at Stanford on
her new art installation project, "My
Life as a Ghost," which integrates video,
performance, sound and other media in
to a built environment. The project is
based on the traumatic brain injury
(TBI) she suffered after being shot in
the head at the age of 14.
Borsook is the first to join the Stan
ford Arts Institute's new Research Res
idency program and will be on campus
working on her project until Nov. 15.
She recently sat down with The Daily to
discuss her personal history and how
this, among other factors, has inspired
and shaped her project.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is a
traumatic brain injury ghost, in your
own words? How did your personal ex
periences help in defining that term?
Paulina Borsook (PB): There just hap
pened to be a notice in [a] Santa Cruz
newspaper about this group of people
for TBI, and the group reporter had
TBI, and she had this whole list of symp
toms, and I gasped as I thought, "That
looks really familiar."
So, I went to this group, and every
body told their story. This guy stood up
and talked about his TBI, and every
thing about it was different than mine.
Then he turned and looked at the group
and said, "I don't know why I'm still
here." I gasped because that's what I
had felt ever since I was shot in the
head. I saw two or three other people in

this group of 20 nodding their heads.
So I had this flash. I had thought,
ever since I was 14, that the fact that I
always go to that place was one more
thing that was wrong with me. Now, I
find out that that's neurological, and
that it's a neurological artifact for some
people with traumatic brain injury.
Something gets dislocated in the sense
of knowing that you belong to yourself
and your life, and it's an artifact of the
injury.
So you can ask yourself, "I don't
know why I'm still here." You feel partly
elsewhere, and where are you in that
partly elsewhere and what is it to
have that fundamental union between
self and body is a little bit disjunctive.
To me, that's what I mean by a ghost.


Cour-
TSD: When and how did you be
come inspired to begin this project,
and what motivations did you have
that helped you through the
process?
PB: It kind of came to me in a flash.
Simultaneous with that part of me
that thought, "Are you insane?"
I knew that this project would
be incredibly resource demanding,
and I also knew that it was intrinsi
cally collaborative. I'm a writer
I'm not a set designer, I'm not a
soundscape designer. I don't have
any of the skills to make this hap
pen, but the vision presented itself
and said this is what it has to be.

If you walk through a cathedral
and I don't care if you're an ob
servant Christian or not you get
this feeling. It's just there. So I'm
feeling that to evoke a sense of
what I call being a ghost, we have
to do something that people walk
through and they experience it.
The main way that me being
good at language comes into this is
that I can articulate what I want
the project to be. I can give other
people directions, and I've been
able to advocate my project well
enough to end up at Stanford in the
fall.

TSD: Where do you want to see
this project go from here?
PB: The next step is that I have to
do a ton of fundraising. Then, I
need to find the right cinematogra
pher because what I want to do is
find the other TBI ghosts. What I

want to do is film them and have
them talk about their experience of
ghostliness.
Once I have that, then what I
would do ideally is find my sound
scape designer and find my built
environment person — I guess

that's my sculptor or visual artist
or something like that. That would
be my ideal sequence of things.
TSD: What do you want people to
get from this?
PB: What I hope is that it will
evoke what this very strange "what
happens when the soul is blasted
out of the body and is incompletely
returned" is.
I'm trying to focus on that
which has been lost in all of these
discussions which is the inter
life, the subjective, the sense of self
and I'm trying to evoke that for
others, which is a tricky deal. I
hope it will be a little spooky, a little
disturbing, a little bit beautiful. If
it's those three things, then the
project will have succeeded.

toms, and I gasped as I thought, "That
looks really familiar."
So, I went to this group, and every
body told their story. This guy stood up
and talked about his TBI, and every
thing about it was different than mine.
Then he turned and looked at the group
and said, "I don't know why I'm still
here." I gasped because that's what I
had felt ever since I was shot in the
head. I saw two or three other people in

this group of 20 nodding their heads.
So I had this flash. I had thought,
ever since I was 14, that the fact that I
always go to that place was one more
thing that was wrong with me. Now, I
find out that that's neurological, and
that it's a neurological artifact for some
people with traumatic brain injury.
Something gets dislocated in the sense
of knowing that you belong to yourself
and your life, and it's an artifact of the
injury.
So you can ask yourself, "I don't
know why I'm still here." You feel partly
elsewhere, and where are you in that
partly elsewhere and what is it to
have that fundamental union between
self and body is a little bit disjunctive.
To me, that's what I mean by a ghost.


Cour-
TSD: When and how did you be
come inspired to begin this project,
and what motivations did you have
that helped you through the
process?
PB: It kind of came to me in a flash.
Simultaneous with that part of me
that thought, "Are you insane?"
I knew that this project would
be incredibly resource demanding,
and I also knew that it was intrinsi
cally collaborative. I'm a writer
I'm not a set designer, I'm not a
soundscape designer. I don't have
any of the skills to make this hap
pen, but the vision presented itself
and said this is what it has to be.

If you walk through a cathedral
and I don't care if you're an ob
servant Christian or not you get
this feeling. It's just there. So I'm
feeling that to evoke a sense of
what I call being a ghost, we have
to do something that people walk
through and they experience it.
The main way that me being
good at language comes into this is
that I can articulate what I want
the project to be. I can give other
people directions, and I've been
able to advocate my project well
enough to end up at Stanford in the
fall.

TSD: Where do you want to see
this project go from here?
PB: The next step is that I have to
do a ton of fundraising. Then, I
need to find the right cinematogra
pher because what I want to do is
find the other TBI ghosts. What I

want to do is film them and have
them talk about their experience of
ghostliness.
Once I have that, then what I
would do ideally is find my sound
scape designer and find my built
environment person — I guess

that's my sculptor or visual artist
or something like that. That would
be my ideal sequence of things.
TSD: What do you want people to
get from this?
PB: What I hope is that it will
evoke what this very strange "what
happens when the soul is blasted
out of the body and is incompletely
returned" is.
I'm trying to focus on that
which has been lost in all of these
discussions which is the inter
life, the subjective, the sense of self
and I'm trying to evoke that for
others, which is a tricky deal. I
hope it will be a little spooky, a little
disturbing, a little bit beautiful. If
it's those three things, then the
project will have succeeded.

For the past month, writer and jour
nalist Paulina Borsook has been working
as an artist-in-residenee at Stanford on
her new art installation project, "My
Life as a Ghost," which integrates video,
performance, sound and other media in
to a built environment. The project is
based on the traumatic brain injury
(TBI) she suffered after being shot in
the head at the age of 14.
Borsook is the first to join the Stan
ford Arts Institute's new Research Res
idency program and will be on campus
working on her project until Nov. 15.
She recently sat down with The Daily to
discuss her personal history and how
this, among other factors, has inspired
and shaped her project.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is a
traumatic brain injury ghost, in your
own words? How did your personal ex
periences help in defining that term?
Paulina Borsook (PB): There just hap
pened to be a notice in [a] Santa Cruz
newspaper about this group of people
for TBI, and the group reporter had
TBI, and she had this whole list of symp
toms, and I gasped as I thought, "That
looks really familiar."
