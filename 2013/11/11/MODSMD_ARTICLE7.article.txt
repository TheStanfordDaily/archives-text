## Bel blurs dancing's definition 
### KATIE STRAUB 
Jerome Bel, renowned French choreogra
pher, is perhaps best described as a provoca
teur of dance. In exploring the idea of dance
over the past two decades, Bel is often referred
to as a "conceptual choreographer." The New
York Times has called him "one of the most
charismatic and galvanizing choreographers
working today."
Stanford welcomes Bel to campus this
quarter to exhibit three of his acclaimed dance
pieces in Bing Concert Hall in an event called
"Festival: Jerome Bel."
Bel's three showcased pieces include: "The
Show Must Go On," a piece based on jamming
to pop music; "Cedric Andrieux," in which
dancer Andrieux performs solo while speaking
aloud details about his life and career; and fi
nally, the film "Pichet Klunchun and Myself" in
which Bel and Thai dancer Klunchun explore
movement.
The Daily spoke to Bel about his work, his
career and his artistic process.
Arts & Life (AL): Much of your work
comes from quotations from the lives and ca
reers of famous dancers. What is your artistic
approach to this kind of choreography?
Jerome Bel (JB): My work is not really

dance, but it is about dance. So, my work is
probably more about "what is dance" than the
action of dancing. I am a kind of investigator of
dance, and dancers are the perfect witnesses
for this.
I have noticed that dancers don't speak
much. They dance, but most of them are afraid
of speaking about dance. I had an intuition that
dancers are the ones who are experiencing
things about dance that nobody else can not
choreographers, critics or spectators. That is
how I got the idea to ask them to speak about
their work, in order to know more about dance.
AL: Your work has challenged the definition
of dance. How do you define dance?
JB: I don't define dance. I try on the con
trary, to blur its definition, to go to its limits. As
soon as I have found a definition, I try to find
how to change it, to make this definition obso
lete.
AL: What can dance teach us about the
world that other art forms cannot?
JB: Dance offers bodies in a specific action
to be watched. Those bodies reveal, for me, a
relation to the world. I don't think dance can do
something other art forms cannot; dance tries
to question and express the same things that
other art forms do. I think that it is an experi
ence that can be eloquent to one [person] and

totally obscure to [another]. It is simply away
of expression that a person can either "under
stand" or not.
AL: You have studied both Dance History
and Philosophy. How has your study of philos
ophy informed your creative work?
JB: Philosophy gave me tools to study
dance, to understand it, to conceptualize the
practice [of dance] in order to present other as
pects of [it].
AL: What about Stanford University in
spired you to show your works here?
JB: Well, I have been invited by Stanford,
and I am just excited to be invited by a Univer
sity. I think that arts and knowledge have the
same mission: to emancipate people.
Events within "Festival: Jerome Bel"
will be shown in Bing Concert Hall on
Nov. 13, Nov. 18, Dec. 2 arid Dec. 3. "Fes
tival: Jerome Bel" is presented by the
Stanford Dance Division and Stanford
Arts Institute together with Stanford's
new residential freshman program., Im
mersion in the Arts: Living in Culture
(ITALIC).
