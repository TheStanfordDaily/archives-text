## USC saves best shot for Card 
### Sam Fisher 
When I came to Stan
ford just over three
years ago, I didn't
know much about
the Cardinal's foot
ball rivalries.
Of course I'd heard of Big Game
and Stanford's overall rivalry with
Cal, I knew Oregon was really good
and I was aware of the yearly date
with Notre Dame. It still took me a
few years on campus, however, to be
gin to truly understand what those
games mean.
But when it came to USC, I knew
what I was in for the moment the Tro
jan Marching Band walked out of the
tunnel at Stanford Stadium on Oct. 9,
2010, just a few weeks into my fresh
man year.
I won't ever forget that moment.
Sitting with one of my best friends in
the front of the Red Zone right after
the gates opened, waiting impatiently
for the game to begin, I sat in disbe
lief as I heard "Tribute to Troy" in
person for the first time. I don't like
USC though, to be honest, I did
root for the Trojans over Vince
Young's Texas Longhorns back in
middle school but that moment
was truly surreal. So I turned to my
friend Jordan and said, to try to justi
fy the emotions flowing through me
at the time, "We are at a big-time col
lege football game."
It sounds silly in retrospect, but at
the time the feeling was profound.
Hate them or love them, but the USC
Trojans were college football for a
lot of the 2000s, which was exactly
when I grew into the football fan I
am today. So to be a part of a prime
time college football matchup be
tween my Stanford Cardinal and
USC... well, that was cooler than I
ever could have imagined almost a
decade earlier.
At the time, I didn't know how
crazy that night would be. Andrew
Luck 'l2 was spectacular, but so
was USC quarterback Matt
Barkley. To watch two great quar
terbacks go blow for blow pun
intended on Luck's hit of corner
back Shareece Wright was awe
inspiring. The emotional roller
coaster, finally ending with a field
storming after a walk-off field goal
from Nate Whitaker 'lO, was a
great introduction to the rivalry
with USC and a perfect preview for
what was to come.
I'll spare you all the details of
my experience in 2011, at the nail
biter in Los Angeles, or in 2012,
broadcasting my first big football
victory, but as you all know, my sen
ior class enters this week having
never witnessed a loss against the
Trojans, which is a pretty good feel
ing to have.
Yet this "domination," unlike so
many of the other active winning
streaks the Cardinal has right now
(three-plus years against every Cali
fornia school, for one) has been any
thing but dominant. For some rea
son, no matter the state of USC foot
ball, Stanford seems to get the Tro
jans' best shot.
So when USC fired head coach
Lane Kiffin back at the end of Sep
tember, I couldn't help but think,
"Here we go again." In classic USC
form of the past few years, turmoil is
wreaking havoc on the program; yet,
just in time for its date with Stan
ford, USC seems to have turned a
corner and is playing its best football
of the season by far.
So, if I've learned anything in my
four years of watching Stanford foot
ball up close, it's to never overlook a
Stanford-USC matchup. All three
have been decided by a single pos
session, and all three have been on
my list of the most exciting football
games I've had the pleasure of
watching.
Now the only thing left to wonder
is what is going to make this year's
game special. I've got a funny feel
ing that Stanford fans are going to
have to sweat out another "Cardiac
Cardinal" moment in the Coliseum.
I'm not sure it will get as stressful
as the stretch between Luck's pick
six and Stanford's eventual victory
in 2011, but it could come close.
And I have to admit that,
against USC, I wouldn't want it any
other way.
