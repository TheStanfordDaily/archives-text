# DEFENSE ABSENT AS CARD ROUTED
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
In a scene all too reminiscent
of recent seasons for the Stan
ford men's basketball team,
dumb fouls, costly turnovers
and even worse defense proved
to be too much for the Cardinal
to overcome against a talented
BYU team, as the men of
Maples fell to the visitors 112-
103.

Despite another virtuoso of
fensive performance by junior
guard Chasson Randle, who fin
ished with a career-high 33
points on 12-of-23 shooting, and
a strong outing from senior for
ward Dwight Powell, who added
28 on 10 of 15 from the floor,
Stanford's porous defense failed
it again and again.
"I'm not looking at the num
bers, I'm just looking at the L at
the end of the day," said Randle
of his career-high night. "We
have to figure out what we have
to do to get the win on Thurs
day."
The Cardinal failed to get

any closer than a halftime deficit
of 8 points in the second half.
Stanford was never able to come
up with the stops necessary to
get itself back into the game.
"Give them a lot of credit,"
said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "They shot the ball
well. They played with a lot of
confidence."
For a team that had strong
NCAA tournament hopes com
ing into the season, the lack of
defensive focus and effort was
an extremely discouraging sign.
BYU shot 53.5 percent from the
floor for the game, including
53.3 percent from 3-point range.
If things don't change quickly,
Dawkins' tenure at Stanford
could come to a close sooner
rather than later.
BYU's offense was humming
from the outset, as the Cougars
shot 53.7 percent from the floor
in the first half, including 55.6
percent from 3-point range.
Stanford's 2-3 zone failed to pre
vent off-the-dribble penetration
and second-chance opportuni
ties for the Cougars, while the
Cardinal's man-to-man defense
was slow in its rotation and
weak-side help.
Stanford was able to keep it

Chasson Randle (above) scored a career-high 33 points in what proved
to be a futile Cardinal effort. BYU roared past Stanford 112-103 and
handed the Cardinal its first disappointing loss of the 2013-14 season.
close in the first half byway
of its 18 free throw attempts,
of which it converted 14.
BYU's low post players
posed the biggest problem
for the Cardinal in the first
half, as forwards Eric Mika
and Kyle Collinsworth com
bined for 21 points and seven
rebounds on 8-of-15 shoot
ing.
In the second half, it was
BYU guards Matt Carlino
and Tyler Haws who took
over. After scoring a rela
tively ho-hum 15 points be
tween them in the first half,
BYU's two leading scorers
from last season exploded in
the second half. The two

guards combined for 42
points in the second frame,
helping stretch the Cougars'
lead out to 20 points. Haws
finished with 31, while Carli
no added 26 in the victory.
The two combined to shoot
18 of 34 from the field for the
game.
As a result, Stanford's fu
rious late comeback attempt
was too little too late. Credit
must be given where credit
is due, and it was clear that
Stanford never quit on this
night, despite being repeat
edly thwarted by the hot
handed Cougars.
"I thought our kids kept
fighting," Dawkins said.
"Our kids showed no quit. It
was just a matter of getting
stops."
Senior forward John
Gage had three 3-pointers
off the bench in the second
half, spurring a comeback at
tempt that got the Stanford
faithful excited but was nev
er really enough to worry
BYU. Stanford was never
able to draw closer than 9
points, which was the final

deficit.
The difference in efficien
cy between the two teams
can best be understood in
the final assist and turnover
statistics for the game.
While Stanford turned it
over 16 times and registered
just 14 assists on 34 field
goals, BYU had more than
twice as many assists than
turnovers, with 23 and 11 re
spectively. BYU scored 28
points off of Stanford
turnovers, an astonishingly
efficient total.
This was the first time an
opposing team had scored
more than 100 points in a
regulation game at Maples
Pavilion since 1985, and the
first time a team had scored
at least 112 points since
UCLA did it in February
1977, another Stanford loss.
The Cardinal will look to
right the ship on Thursday
night against Northwestern,
a team Stanford beat a sea
son ago.

son ago.

In a scene all too reminiscent
of recent seasons for the Stan
ford men's basketball team,
dumb fouls, costly turnovers
and even worse defense proved
to be too much for the Cardinal
to overcome against a talented
BYU team, as the men of
Maples fell to the visitors 112-
103.

Despite another virtuoso of
fensive performance by junior
guard Chasson Randle, who fin
ished with a career-high 33
points on 12-of-23 shooting, and
a strong outing from senior for
ward Dwight Powell, who added
28 on 10 of 15 from the floor,
Stanford's porous defense failed
it again and again.
"I'm not looking at the num
bers, I'm just looking at the L at
the end of the day," said Randle
of his career-high night. "We
have to figure out what we have
to do to get the win on Thurs
day."
The Cardinal failed to get

any closer than a halftime deficit
of 8 points in the second half.
Stanford was never able to come
up with the stops necessary to
get itself back into the game.
"Give them a lot of credit,"
said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "They shot the ball
well. They played with a lot of
confidence."
For a team that had strong
NCAA tournament hopes com
ing into the season, the lack of
defensive focus and effort was
an extremely discouraging sign.
BYU shot 53.5 percent from the
floor for the game, including
53.3 percent from 3-point range.
If things don't change quickly,
Dawkins' tenure at Stanford
could come to a close sooner
rather than later.
BYU's offense was humming
from the outset, as the Cougars
shot 53.7 percent from the floor
in the first half, including 55.6
percent from 3-point range.
Stanford's 2-3 zone failed to pre
vent off-the-dribble penetration
and second-chance opportuni
ties for the Cougars, while the
Cardinal's man-to-man defense
was slow in its rotation and
weak-side help.
Stanford was able to keep it

Chasson Randle (above) scored a career-high 33 points in what proved
to be a futile Cardinal effort. BYU roared past Stanford 112-103 and
handed the Cardinal its first disappointing loss of the 2013-14 season.
close in the first half byway
of its 18 free throw attempts,
of which it converted 14.
BYU's low post players
posed the biggest problem
for the Cardinal in the first
half, as forwards Eric Mika
and Kyle Collinsworth com
bined for 21 points and seven
rebounds on 8-of-15 shoot
ing.
In the second half, it was
BYU guards Matt Carlino
and Tyler Haws who took
over. After scoring a rela
tively ho-hum 15 points be
tween them in the first half,
BYU's two leading scorers
from last season exploded in
the second half. The two

guards combined for 42
points in the second frame,
helping stretch the Cougars'
lead out to 20 points. Haws
finished with 31, while Carli
no added 26 in the victory.
The two combined to shoot
18 of 34 from the field for the
game.
As a result, Stanford's fu
rious late comeback attempt
was too little too late. Credit
must be given where credit
is due, and it was clear that
Stanford never quit on this
night, despite being repeat
edly thwarted by the hot
handed Cougars.
"I thought our kids kept
fighting," Dawkins said.
"Our kids showed no quit. It
was just a matter of getting
stops."
Senior forward John
Gage had three 3-pointers
off the bench in the second
half, spurring a comeback at
tempt that got the Stanford
faithful excited but was nev
er really enough to worry
BYU. Stanford was never
able to draw closer than 9
points, which was the final

deficit.
The difference in efficien
cy between the two teams
can best be understood in
the final assist and turnover
statistics for the game.
While Stanford turned it
over 16 times and registered
just 14 assists on 34 field
goals, BYU had more than
twice as many assists than
turnovers, with 23 and 11 re
spectively. BYU scored 28
points off of Stanford
turnovers, an astonishingly
efficient total.
This was the first time an
opposing team had scored
more than 100 points in a
regulation game at Maples
Pavilion since 1985, and the
first time a team had scored
at least 112 points since
UCLA did it in February
1977, another Stanford loss.
