# DEFENSE ABSENT AS CARD ROUTED
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
In a scene all too reminiscent
of recent seasons for the Stan
ford men's basketball team,
dumb fouls, costly turnovers
and even worse defense proved
to be too much for the Cardinal
to overcome against a talented
BYU team, as the men of
Maples fell to the visitors 112-
103.

Despite another virtuoso of
fensive performance by junior
guard Chasson Randle, who fin
ished with a career-high 33
points on 12-of-23 shooting, and
a strong outing from senior for
ward Dwight Powell, who added
28 on 10 of 15 from the floor,
Stanford's porous defense failed
it again and again.
"I'm not looking at the num
bers, I'm just looking at the L at
the end of the day," said Randle
of his career-high night. "We
have to figure out what we have
to do to get the win on Thurs
day."
The Cardinal failed to get

any closer than a halftime deficit
of 8 points in the second half.
Stanford was never able to come
up with the stops necessary to
get itself back into the game.
"Give them a lot of credit,"
said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "They shot the ball
well. They played with a lot of
confidence."
For a team that had strong
NCAA tournament hopes com
ing into the season, the lack of
defensive focus and effort was
an extremely discouraging sign.
BYU shot 53.5 percent from the
floor for the game, including
53.3 percent from 3-point range.
If things don't change quickly,
Dawkins' tenure at Stanford
could come to a close sooner
rather than later.
BYU's offense was humming
from the outset, as the Cougars
shot 53.7 percent from the floor
in the first half, including 55.6
percent from 3-point range.
Stanford's 2-3 zone failed to pre
vent off-the-dribble penetration
and second-chance opportuni
ties for the Cougars, while the
Cardinal's man-to-man defense
was slow in its rotation and
weak-side help.
Stanford was able to keep it

Chasson Randle (above) scored a career-high 33 points in what proved
to be a futile Cardinal effort. BYU roared past Stanford 112-103 and
handed the Cardinal its first disappointing loss of the 2013-14 season.
