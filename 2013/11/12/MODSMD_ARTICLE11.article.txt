# INSTANT REPLAY: READ OPTION
## 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Head coach David Shaw and company
silenced the critics by calling an excellent
game; while Stanford's yards per play
was really nothing to write home about,
its outrageous consistency 3 yards
and a cloud of dust more than made up
the difference. Everything flowed from
Stanford's continual victories on the line
of scrimmage. The fact of the matter is
that Oregon's defense is significantly un
dersized: Against Stanford, the starting
Duck front seven weighed 1,781 pounds
across the board whereas a more opti
mal number would be 1,850 pounds
and Stanford's front seven weighed in at
1,878 pounds.
Stanford's big offensive line pushed
Oregon around all game. The Ducks had
no choice but to gamble for sacks and

tackles for loss. Desperately
trying to penetrate into the
backfield, defensive coordi
nator Nick Aliotti fielded
various exotic defensive
alignments that football
teams rarely see. Aliotti,
typically very good at in
game adjustments, came up
empty on Thursday Ore
gon didn't sack Kevin Hogan
all night, hit him only once,
and recorded just three
tackles for loss. But even
worse, Oregon's defensive
alignments often left the
Ducks vulnerable to the
Stanford power-running
game. Kevin Hogan burned
one such defensive front on
his 11-yard touchdown run
in the second quarter.
Here, Oregon lined up six
defenders in the box against
six potential Stanford block
ers. That's fine, but notice
where the players were posi
tioned. Three Ducks (M, W,
and E) were lined up against
Stanford left tackle Andrus
Peat. Meanwhile, Oregon's
strong side defensive end (E
in blue triangle) was lined up
inside right tackle Cameron
Fleming, which would make

it child's play for Fleming to
seal him to the inside on an
outside run, and the Ducks
had nobody to pressure tight
end Charlie Hopkins (Y) on
the line of scrimmage in case
Hopkins were to block in the
run game. Oregon was gam
bling everything on being
able to blow by Peat and
tackle running back Ricky
Seale in the backfield.
Shaw knew that if he
could trust Peat to hold the
line for just one second, the
question would be not what
Stanford could do in the run
game, but what it couldn't
do. Here he went for the
jugular. Shaw called a read
option play, and that phrase
certainly has shades of Ore
gon football to it, but Stan
ford's read option here was
not like the Oregon read op
tion.
What Stanford ran was
actually an extension of
Stanford's bread-and-butter
play, 97 Power, where
Yankey pulls right and lead
blocks for the tailback. Stan
ford optioned the strong side
defensive end (blue trian
gle): if the end sat back and
waited for a direct run,
Hogan (Q) would hand the
ball off to Seale (R), while if
the end tried to penetrate
and attack the handoff,

Hogan would punish his ag
gressiveness by running the
ball himself on Power. There
are various names for this
play Veer Power and In
verted Veer for example
but I prefer the most obvi
ous: the Power Read.
As it turned out, Peat
survived on the backside,
Oregon tried to penetrate on
the strong side and Hogan
took off. Now that he no
longer had to block the de
fensive end, Cameron Flem
ing hit the second level of the
defense immediately and
crushed Oregon's strong
side linebacker (S). After
Hopkins attacked the strong
safety ($) and receiver De
von Cajuste blocked the free
safety (F/S), Yankey was
free to crush anything in his
path, and Hogan could waltz
into the end zone.
Stanford's blocking actu
ally wasn't very good on this
play. You could even say that
it was terrible. Yankey and
especially Hopkins and Ca
juste all failed to control
their defenders. But Flem
ing decisively neutralized
the key threat, and with
numbers still on his side,
Hogan scored a touchdown
that signaled to the world
that Stanford's offense had
come to play.
As remarkable as Stan
ford going 10 for 12 on third
and fourth-and-short was
the fact that it even had 12
such chances at all. Stan
ford's offensive line dominat
ed and constantly put the of
fense in position to succeed
on third down. Nick Aliotti's
defensive alignments cer
tainly helped, but Aliotti
would not have had to try
these tactics if Oregon's at
tempts at conventional de
fense hadn't been over
whelmed time and time
again. Oregon's defense on
this play was a cry of the
damned, and Stanford was
its Grim Reaper.
