# NOT THERE YET
## NO. 3 STANFORD FALLS TO NO. 1 UCONN 76-57 
### LAUREN CHRISTINE LOCKETT 
In a highly anticipated early
season trip to Storrs, Conn., to
play the defending champion Con
necticut Huskies (2-0), the No. 3
Stanford women's basketball

team (1-1) took a tough loss Mon
day night. With a 76-57 win over
the Cardinal, No. 1 Connecticut
showed why it is the early favorite
to repeat as champion.
However, the Huskies' victory
came with a real scare as their Ail-
American junior Kaleena

Mosqueda-Lewis went down with
an arm injury early in the second
half.
Though both teams began the
game in an early scoring drought,
the Huskies' pressure defense
caused Stanford to commit 16
turnovers, which led to easy tran
sition baskets for Connecticut.
Senior point guard Bria Hartley
led Connecticut's charge with 20
points, eight rebounds and six as
sists.

"I think that this game can be a
real positive for our team," Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "Positive from successes that
people had and [it can] get their
attention. This is what the best
team plays like. We need to really
understand it and internalize it
and come out and work on it."
The Cardinal was led by junior
guard Amber Orrange who scored
a career-high 22 points. With 12 of
those points coming in the first
half, Orrange provided the initial
spark for Stanford as she beat her
defenders off the dribble multiple
times and got into the lane seem
ingly at will.
Ail-American senior Chiney
Ogwumike quietly notched her
60th career double-double as she
finished with 16 points and 13 re
bounds for the Cardinal. Orrange
and Ogwumike combined for 22 of
Stanford's 26 points in the first
half. But after their two leading
scorers, Stanford had little other
offense.
Connecticut displayed great
depth as their bench outscored
Stanford's 27-12. Connecticut's
backup center Kiah Stokes played

well, adding 10 points, 13 re
bounds and six blocks. Mean
while, Stanford's young bench
couldn't keep up, with nearly
as many personal fouls (10) as
points (12).
However, the most notable
action of the night was Con
necticut's star sharpshooter
Mosqueda-Lewis going down
at the beginning of the second
half. The Connecticut crowd of
nearly 10,000 went silent as
she rolled and screamed in
pain.
But instead of being
slowed down, the Huskies
played more inspired basket
ball after their star was hurt.
Following the injury in the

early second half, Connecticut
pulled away with a 20-point
lead that it maintained for
most of the rest of the game.
"We play Connecticut with
no illusions. This is a tough
place to play and a tough
team," VanDerveer said. "We
got better and better as the
game went on and a game like
this right now is helpful for
us."
Seemingly searching for
the right offensive combina
tion to spark her squad, Van-
Derveer played all 13 of her
available players Monday
night. However, nothing was
working. If the Cardinal
wants to live up to its lofty
preseason predictions, the
team must find offensive pro
duction from sources other
than Orrange and Ogwumike,
who scored 38 of Stanford's 57
points.

Though not much was at
stake Monday night, the Car
dinal and Huskies have a his
tory of big games, including
Connecticut's win last season
that ended Stanford's streak
of 82 consecutive home-court
victories.
Despite the loss, Van-
Derveer remains only five
wins away from becoming the
fifth women's basketball
coach in history to win 900
games. Stanford's all-time
record against the Huskies
fell to 9-6, with the Cardinal
losing nine of the last 12
matchups.
The Cardinal has the rest
of the week to regroup before
hosting Cal Poly for its home
opener this Friday, Nov. 15.
