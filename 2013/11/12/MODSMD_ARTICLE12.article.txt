### LAUREN CHRISTINE LOCKETT 
In a highly anticipated early
season trip to Storrs, Conn., to
play the defending champion Con
necticut Huskies (2-0), the No. 3
Stanford women's basketball

team (1-1) took a tough loss Mon
day night. With a 76-57 win over
the Cardinal, No. 1 Connecticut
showed why it is the early favorite
to repeat as champion.
However, the Huskies' victory
came with a real scare as their Ail-
American junior Kaleena

Mosqueda-Lewis went down with
an arm injury early in the second
half.
Though both teams began the
game in an early scoring drought,
the Huskies' pressure defense
caused Stanford to commit 16
turnovers, which led to easy tran
sition baskets for Connecticut.
Senior point guard Bria Hartley
led Connecticut's charge with 20
points, eight rebounds and six as
sists.

"I think that this game can be a
real positive for our team," Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "Positive from successes that
people had and [it can] get their
attention. This is what the best
team plays like. We need to really
understand it and internalize it
and come out and work on it."
The Cardinal was led by junior
guard Amber Orrange who scored
a career-high 22 points. With 12 of
those points coming in the first
half, Orrange provided the initial
spark for Stanford as she beat her
defenders off the dribble multiple
times and got into the lane seem
ingly at will.
Ail-American senior Chiney
Ogwumike quietly notched her
60th career double-double as she
finished with 16 points and 13 re
bounds for the Cardinal. Orrange
and Ogwumike combined for 22 of
Stanford's 26 points in the first
half. But after their two leading
scorers, Stanford had little other
offense.
Connecticut displayed great
depth as their bench outscored
Stanford's 27-12. Connecticut's
backup center Kiah Stokes played
