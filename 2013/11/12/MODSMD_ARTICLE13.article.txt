# STANFORD IN THE NFL
## DOUG BALDWIN MAKING MOST OF OPPORTUNITY 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
Adversity. For most, the word
carries a negative connotation
something best avoided or at least
forgotten. For former Stanford and
current Seattle Seahawks wide re
ceiver Doug Baldwin 'll, however,
overcoming adversity has been as
integral to his development as
learning how to run routes, a lesson
he credits in large part to his alma
mater.
"Being a Stanford student-ath
lete, you have to be able to manage
your time right and you have to
deal with a lot of adversity on and
off the field," Baldwin said. "It def
initely prepares you in a different
way for the NFL, where there're so
many distractions off the field. It's
reminiscent of the distractions you
have [at Stanford]."
Baldwin's journey to becoming
a top receiver on one of the NFEs
best teams (the Seahawks current
ly own a 9-1 record) has certainly
seen its fair share of obstacles.
Coming out of Gulf Breeze, Fla., as
an unheralded recruit, he dealt
with injuries and struggled to earn
playing time during his first three
years at Stanford. Baldwin's strug
gles, however, allowed him to devel
op an appreciation for overcoming
adversity that shapes much of his
mentality today. In his breakout
senior season, Baldwin recorded
857 yards and nine touchdowns to
lead all Cardinal receivers.
Despite a tremendous senior
year, Baldwin went undrafted in
the 2011 NFL draft yet emerged as
the Seahawks' top receiver in the
2011 season, finishing with 51 re
ceptions for 788 yards and four
touchdowns. After being limited to
29 catches in 2012, the 5-foot-10,
189-pound Baldwin has cemented
his status as one of the league's
most dangerous slot receivers in
2013, amassing 523 yards and two
touchdowns on 34 receptions.
While he has found success in
the NFL, Baldwin says that he
misses his days on the Farm quite a
bit, especially the camaraderie with
his teammates.
"I miss the camaraderie [the
most]," Baldwin shared. "In the
NFL, with the high turnover ratio,
you can get close to guys, but...
anything can happen. I definitely
miss the camaraderie with the
guys, knowing that you're building
something with them for four
years, and that part of it is special.
[ln the NFL] you never know
where you're going to be next
year."
Baldwin's love for his former
teammates still plays a big role in
his life today. In fact, Baldwin men
tioned that one of the biggest fac
tors in his decision to sign with the
Seahawks as an undrafted free
agent was the chance to reunite
with cornerback Richard Sherman
'll and maintain some of that Stan
ford locker room camaraderie.
Baldwin also stays in touch with
his former Stanford teammates
who are now in the NFL, a group
that formed the core of the Cardi
nal squad that won the Orange
Bowl in 2011, a team that Baldwin
calls "one of the most special teams
in Stanford history" for sending the
Cardinal to its first BCS Bowl
game since 1998.
Although the 2010-11 Stanford
team holds a special place in Bald
win's heart, he noted that he has
