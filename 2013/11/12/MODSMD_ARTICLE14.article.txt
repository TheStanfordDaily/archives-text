## Information Overflow and Social Media 
### Omar Diab 
Social media has overrun the
world. Facebook connects
your friends, Linkedln net
works your jobs and Twitter em
bodies your insightful and mun
dane thoughts (for better or
worse). Slashdot, Digg and Reddit
have made news social, while tradi
tional news sites have embraced
services like Disqus to bring dis
cussion to their articles. Quora and
Stack Exchange crowdsouree an
swers for your deepest questions
and Amazon has made a commerce
community through product re
views.
But there's a massive elephant
in the room. Facebook, in its at
tempt "to make the world more
open and connected," seems to in
stead make people more unhappy
and less satisfied. Twitter is a light
ning rod for criticism, a land of vap
id and meaningless tweets. Even
marketers question if social media
is just a huge waste of time in the
face of enormous valuations of so
cial media behemoths.
Most social media outlets do not
promote meaningful, timely discus
sion. They focus myopically on the
information of the moment the
news and in turn inundate their
users with irrelevant information
while sacrificing the time needed to
contemplate and form meaningful,
nuanced opinions.
Most news comes in the form of
chronological feeds. Newspapers,
magazines and journals release
current news on a regular basis.
Television and radio broadcast the
news live as it occurs. Online serv
ices like Reddit and Twitter list
trending topics, and Facebook
feeds display your friends' news in
real time.
But the 24-hour news cycle
guarantees that no topic, no matter
how important, survives any of
these institutions beyond a few
weeks.
We need to compartmentalize
information through feeds because
there is just too much information
to process at any given time. As the
pace of news has accelerated, so
has the rate at which people con
sume news. News feeds filter out
the noise, consolidating informa
tion the world considers important.
Yet, according to a Pew poll, not a
single news audience is well-in
formed about current events.
Feeds do not prevent informa
tion overflow; in many cases, they
exacerbate it. We need new para
digms of consuming and discussing
the news, not because we need to
understand everything that's going
on, but because accepting that we
can't comprehend everything al
lows us to focus on what we do
know.
Reddit is the closest I've seen to
producing quality discussion online.
Its algorithm assigns a score to
every post. A post's score priori
tizes whatever has the most "up
votes" and the fewest "downvotes."
That simple notion produces curat
ed, timely and meaningful informa
tion that, coupled with a strong
commenting system, creates a
wealth of discussion.
However, the algorithm also de
creases a post's score exponentially
as time passes, meaning that no
post can remain at the top of the
Reddit news feed for more than a
couple of days. This is a great algo
rithm for the news, as it directly
tracks what people consider inter
esting in the moment. But it fails to
preserve information long enough
for reflection.
"Redditors" commonly com
plain about "karma whores" who
game Reddit's system to fill up the
front page with uninteresting driv
el. Ironically, people often "repost"
old content on Reddit. Despite crit
ics who complain that they've al
ready seen those posts before, re
posts nonetheless always find
themselves at the top of the feed,
reflecting people's desires to return
to good content.
Some services are approaching
the concept of time and how it im
pacts communication in interesting
ways. Snapchat embraces the
ephemerality of information, de
stroying messages mere seconds
after they've been read. On the oth
er hand Medium aims to display
long-form text in deliberate and
compelling ways, incentivizing
quality of writing and thought in
stead of the time it takes for a jour
nalist to react to an event.
This is not to say persistent in
formation doesn't exist on the web.
Online encyclopedias like
Wikipedia, journal databases like
JStor and Lexis Nexis, and the
Way√üack Machine serve important
roles in data archiving. And search

engines like Google allow people to
not only view the latest information
but to search for information on a
topical, rather than chronological
basis. Yet none of these are social in
nature; they serve as research
tools, not as forums for discussion.
Understanding and working
with the ephemerality of news has
real consequences. The Gulf of
Mexico oil spill is still corroding
beaches in Louisiana, but I haven't
even heard it mentioned in months.
And Edward Snowden, in an at
tempt to overcome the ephemerali
ty of news in the national conscious
ness, is leaking sensitive NSA in
formation over time to remain
"news." The fact he needed to do
what he did to spark a national dis
cussion represents a fundamental
flaw in the way information flows
through modern society It threat
ens the maintenance of justice and
a working democracy.
So, the next time you hear that
social media is worthless, think
again it's a reflection of society
itself, and there's a lot of work to be
done in making discussion count.
