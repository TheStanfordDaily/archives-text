## Technology and Unemployment 
### Rahul Gupta-Iwasaki 
Farming is the quintessential
human profession. Before
the Industrial Revolution
swept the West, the vast majority
of the world's population worked as
farmers, and even today one in
three people, around 2.3 billion, is
employed in agriculture.
Bountiful farms provide the sus
tenance for life at the efficiency and
scale needed to support once
unimaginable populations; before
people learned to tend and cultivate
the earth, the total global human
population likely had never exceed
ed 15 million people, less than the
number of people living in Beijing
today. Now, this oldest and most
perfectly human occupation
farming, not prostitution is go
ing to the robots.
That is, if the planners of the
Japanese Dream Project have their
way. The Dream Project is an initia
tive focused on innovative ways to re
claim land ravaged by the March
2011 tsunami in the Miyagi Prefec
ture.
On the Dream Project's experi
mental farm, rather than farmers
wading knee-deep in rice paddies, a
cohort of robots will trundle across
the terrain, performing every op
eration. From seed to fruit, ro
bots will prepare, plant, tend and
harvest land polluted by oil, salt
and radioactive fallout that no hu
man would want to work in. The
robots will even infuse it with a
little bit of themselves, as they
cycle their carbon emissions back
into the earth to negate the need
for fertilizer.
As with most experiments in ad
vanced technology, the potential for
swift and substantial economic and
social return on the Dream Project
is rather dubious. While an agricul
ture ministry spokesman stated,
"We hope the project will help not
only support farmers in the disaster
hit regions but also revive the entire
nation's agriculture," Japan's agri
culture ministry and various private
partners expect to invest around 10
billion yen, or $l3O million, to make
this a reality on a mere 600-acre
parcel of land, an unsustainable lev
el of investment for any serious
commercial operation.
It will make little immediate dif
ference to Miyagi Prefecture farm
ers in the context of the "24,000
hectares of once-fertile farmland
damaged by the tsunami." Yet even
if the project fails, the concept of
the Dream Project seems an un

avoidable future.
It is the inevitable next step in
the journey launched when a hu
man first used a stick to dig a hole
in the ground, propelled when peo
ple first harnessed a plow to a mule,
and given wings when the first trac
tor rumbled to life following the in
vention of the steam engine. It is
the herald of the transformation of
farming into a profession ruled by
the mechanized.
Of course, farming is hardly the
only human industry being trans
formed by advancing technology. As
The New York Times exclaims, 'Ameri
can industries... have achieved a pace of
innovation nearly unmatched in
modern history." Breakthroughs in
computing power, connectivity, arti
ficial intelligence, robotics, manufac
turing, medicine and more are re
shaping industries daily.
Here in the heart of Silicon Val
ley, confidence abounds that these
advances can lead only to the bet
terment of the human condition. In
a time of stubbornly high unem
ployment, few question the notion

that advancing technology spurs
job creation.
This is the introductory piece in
a multi-part series in The Daily on
why that notion is dangerously
false. The evolution of farming as
evinced by the Dream Project is
but one demonstration of the arc
that professions take as technology
transforms them.
Pointing to examples primarily
from the U.S. economy, we will dis
cover how we are approaching a
time during which most workers
will just no longer be needed. Ad
vancing technology is eliminating
and exporting jobs faster than it
is creating them, as well as push
ing those that do exist out of the
reach of the average citizen, which

will lead to an unprecedented sus
tained rapid decline in job opportu
nities that will strain social and eco
nomic institutions.

Our current pace of technologi
cal change is one that today's eco
nomic, regulatory and societal
structures are ill equipped to han
dle. Technology-related unemploy
ment cannot continue to be ig
nored. As one commenter sardon
ically lamented in a since-deleted
comment on a You Tube video
demonstrating industrial robotics,
"And now the most spoken sen
tence in the 21st century will [be]: 'I
lost my job.'"

Technology-related unemployment
cannot continue to be ignored.
Farming is the quintessential
human profession. Before
the Industrial Revolution
swept the West, the vast majority
of the world's population worked as
farmers, and even today one in
three people, around 2.3 billion, is
employed in agriculture.
Bountiful farms provide the sus
tenance for life at the efficiency and
scale needed to support once
unimaginable populations; before
people learned to tend and cultivate
the earth, the total global human
population likely had never exceed
ed 15 million people, less than the
number of people living in Beijing
today. Now, this oldest and most
perfectly human occupation
farming, not prostitution is go
ing to the robots.
That is, if the planners of the
Japanese Dream Project have their
way. The Dream Project is an initia
tive focused on innovative ways to re
claim land ravaged by the March
2011 tsunami in the Miyagi Prefec
ture.
On the Dream Project's experi
mental farm, rather than farmers
wading knee-deep in rice paddies, a
cohort of robots will trundle across
the terrain, performing every op
eration. From seed to fruit, ro
bots will prepare, plant, tend and
harvest land polluted by oil, salt
and radioactive fallout that no hu
man would want to work in. The
robots will even infuse it with a
little bit of themselves, as they
cycle their carbon emissions back
into the earth to negate the need
for fertilizer.
As with most experiments in ad
vanced technology, the potential for
swift and substantial economic and
social return on the Dream Project
is rather dubious. While an agricul
ture ministry spokesman stated,
"We hope the project will help not
only support farmers in the disaster
hit regions but also revive the entire
nation's agriculture," Japan's agri
culture ministry and various private
partners expect to invest around 10
billion yen, or $l3O million, to make
this a reality on a mere 600-acre
parcel of land, an unsustainable lev
el of investment for any serious
commercial operation.
It will make little immediate dif
ference to Miyagi Prefecture farm
ers in the context of the "24,000
hectares of once-fertile farmland
damaged by the tsunami." Yet even
if the project fails, the concept of
the Dream Project seems an un

avoidable future.
It is the inevitable next step in
the journey launched when a hu
man first used a stick to dig a hole
in the ground, propelled when peo
ple first harnessed a plow to a mule,
and given wings when the first trac
tor rumbled to life following the in
vention of the steam engine. It is
the herald of the transformation of
farming into a profession ruled by
the mechanized.
Of course, farming is hardly the
only human industry being trans
formed by advancing technology. As
The New York Times exclaims, 'Ameri
can industries... have achieved a pace of
innovation nearly unmatched in
modern history." Breakthroughs in
computing power, connectivity, arti
ficial intelligence, robotics, manufac
turing, medicine and more are re
shaping industries daily.
Here in the heart of Silicon Val
ley, confidence abounds that these
advances can lead only to the bet
terment of the human condition. In
a time of stubbornly high unem
ployment, few question the notion

that advancing technology spurs
job creation.
This is the introductory piece in
a multi-part series in The Daily on
why that notion is dangerously
false. The evolution of farming as
evinced by the Dream Project is
but one demonstration of the arc
that professions take as technology
transforms them.
Pointing to examples primarily
from the U.S. economy, we will dis
cover how we are approaching a
time during which most workers
will just no longer be needed. Ad
vancing technology is eliminating
and exporting jobs faster than it
is creating them, as well as push
ing those that do exist out of the
reach of the average citizen, which

will lead to an unprecedented sus
tained rapid decline in job opportu
nities that will strain social and eco
nomic institutions.

Our current pace of technologi
cal change is one that today's eco
nomic, regulatory and societal
structures are ill equipped to han
dle. Technology-related unemploy
ment cannot continue to be ig
nored. As one commenter sardon
