## Cardinal field hockey misses NCAA tournament 
### â€“ Carlie Tenenbaum 
After a heartbreaking 2-1 loss to Lib
erty on Saturday in the NorPac Champi
onship Game, the No. 10 Stanford field
hockey team waited anxiously to hear if
it had been selected to the NCAA tour
nament, featuring teams from all across
the country. Disappointing news came
that evening, however, as the Cardinal
was not selected to participate in the
tournament.
Despite the bitter end, the team had
a very successful season. Finishing with
a strong 16-5 season record, the Cardi
nal brought home the NorPac West
championship for the fifth straight year
and appeared in its eighth consecutive
NorPac title game.
Battling top-20 teams seven times
this season, Stanford was an impressive
4-3, never slipping below No. 13 in the
nation. It was a tough blow for the team
to miss the tournament 2013 marks
the first time in eight years that the
team will not be competing in the tour
nament.
Perhaps most notable this season
was the stingy Stanford defense. Led by
junior defender Kelsey Harbin and
sophomore goalkeeper Dulcie Davies,
the defense played a huge role in keep
ing the Card in the top five in goal dif
ferential rankings.
