# Shayne Skov named Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week
## 
### Michael Peterson 
Fifth-year senior linebacker Shayne
Skov earned this week's Pac-12 Defen

sive Player of the Week honor after an
outstanding performance against the
Ducks' potent offense in the Cardinal's
26-20 win against Oregon this past
Thursday.
Skov finished with a team-leading
nine tackles, including two tackles for
loss, to go along with two forced fumbles,
a fumble recovery, two quarterback hur
ries and one pass breakup. Skov was an
essential part of a Stanford defense that
shut out the nation's No. 2 offense for
three quarters and held them to only 62
rushing yards on the day.
Both forced fumbles came on Oregon
drives in Stanford territory, including
one that Skov forced and recovered in
side the Stanford 5-yard line as Oregon
sought to cut the lead to only 7.
