## US-China summit returns Logistical reasons cancel last year's FACES conference 
### MINKEE SOHN 
The annual Forum for Ameri
can-Chinese Exchange at Stanford
(FACES) summit returned this
past weekend after a year of inac
tivity due to many group members
graduating.
The On Common Ground
(OCG) summit held on campus
from Nov. 7 to 10 brought to
gether 50 students from the Unit
ed States and Chinese universities
to promote trust and understand
ing between the two countries.
Isabella Fu 'l5, co-president of
FACES, discussed the value of
person-to-person interaction in hu
man relationships, and described
the summit as a dynamic environ
ment to facilitate this interaction.

"We are aiming to cultivate fu
ture leaders in the U.S. and Chi

na," Fu said. "[OCG is] inspiring
young people and helping them un
derstand different perspectives
from the other side of the ocean."
Fu went on to describe the im
portance of mutual understanding
in the bilateral relations between
the U.S. and China.
"The people of these countries
have a very disheartening misun
derstanding of each other," Fu
said. "I think most people would
agree that it's very important for
these countries to come together."
Hao Yi Ong 'l4, co-president of

FACES, described the summit as a
way to form long-term cooperative
networks between future U.S. and
Chinese leaders, and emphasized
that the responsibility to create
and maintain those relationships
lay in the hands of conference del
egates.
"Whatever they get out of [the
conference] is really how much
they want to put it in terms of net
working," Ong said. "Networking
at the level where they're at and

where they're likely to be
come future leaders... that's
where the real added value is
going to take place."
Henness Leung, a student
from the University of Hong
Kong attending the confer
ence, also saw the importance
of the face-to-face communi
cation facilitated by the con
ference.
"The media may be bi
ased, especially in the case of
China," Leung said. "Com
munication between dele
gates is the most direct chan
nel to clarify misconceptions."
This year's summit speak
ers included keynote speaker
John L. Holden, former pres
ident of the National Commit
tee on U.S.-China Relations,
and Hans Ring, a Chinese
venture capitalist ranked No.
100 on the 2013 Forbes Midas
list.
After attending OCG, del
egates shared then- confer
ence experiences.
Will Yale, a graduate stu
dent from the Johns Hopkins
University School of Ad
vanced International Studies,
described networking as the
most important part of the
conference.
"[I enjoyed] the socializing
getting to know a lot of
well-informed and committed
people," Yale said. "The peo
ple and the interaction be
tween students was the most
important part of the confer
ence."
Yi Tao Zhang 'l4 M.S. 'l4

also shared what he learned
in the conference.
"My biggest takeaway...
was the role of innovation in
elevating China into a First
World country," Zhang said.
Ong described several
changes to this year's OCG
conference, the most visible
being scheduling.
In order to accommodate
schedule conflicts with
events like graduations, the
Stanford portion of the con
ference took place during fall
instead of spring. The closing
summit will be in China in
April 2014.
Another major change to
OCG this year was an in
creased involvement of
FACES student officers in
the conference.
"We're trying to get our
officers to do a lot more,"
Ong said. "For example, we
have a liaison officer pro
gram where we personally
attach one officer to one
speaker, so they have that
personal connection."
Fu said that the summit
did not take place last year
due to logistical reasons,
since a significant portion of
FACES graduated in the
Class of 2012.
"We didn't have a confer
ence last year because all
our officers happened to be
very young they were
freshmen, sophomores," Fu
said. "It would be hard for
us to start a conference only
with people who have not
gone through it."
However, Ong said that
the yearlong gap between
conferences helped FACES
to regroup and rethink its
strategy, eventually hosting

a one-day symposium event
last year instead of a confer
ence.

"[The gap year] gave us
time to think, look at certain
priorities and boost our
campus programming," Ong
said. "Having a stronger on
campus presence, partly
through our symposium,
should continue this year."
Moving forward, Fu and
Ong said that they expect
the summit to continue reg
ularly on an annual basis.
"This year we really
placed an emphasis on re
cruiting ... Now we have a lot
of freshmen," Fu said.
"When we graduate, there
will be people who can keep
running the conference."
Fu and Ong said goals for
future summits include
strengthening the accessibil
ity of the event on campus.
Ong discussed efforts to in
crease the number of Stan
ford delegates participating
in the conference and to
reach out to a broader audi
ence.
"My idea is that under
graduates need to know
about this [experience] from
the very start," Ong said.
"It's important for under
grads to get on board."
Ong added that he is con
fident in the ability of future
summits to create greater
understanding between the
U.S. and China.
"It's basically the mile
stone effort of FACES every
year," Ong said. "It may
change a little in character,
but not in its mission."
