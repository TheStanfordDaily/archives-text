# Wilbur launches concert receptions
## Dorm RFs whip up interest for the performing arts 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to a suggestion
from the Residential Arts Pro
gram to offer more arts program
ming in the dorms, Wilbur Hall
residences have begun a new se
ries of concert receptions to intro
duce freshmen to the performing
arts scene on campus.
The resident fellows (RF) at
Wilbur are planning informal re
ceptions in the residences before
Friday night concerts at Bing
Concert Hall and Memorial
Church as part of an effort to fa
cilitate access to these events for
new students, according to David
Davidson, the RF in Trancos.
Since most of these concerts
are free, the receptions provide
early access to tickets and allow
students to socialize before the
events.
The first reception was held on

Nov. 8 in the Cedro lounge before
the Stanford Wind Ensemble per
formance in Bing Concert Hall.
"I like that everyone who is in
terested in the music can get to
gether and talk before, instead of
going and not really getting to
talk about it and just watching,"
said Alyssa Rudelis 'l7, a Cedro
resident. "It's nice to have the
community."
The choice to make these
events open to all Wilbur resi
dents was partially made to pro
vide an outlet for students from
different dorms to meet each oth
er and also for logistical purposes,
said Cedro RF Marcelo Cleriei-
Arias.
"This is one of the events that
perhaps if each dorm independ
ently in Wilbur organizes it, only
a handful of people would go,"
Clerici-Arias said.
