# Wilbur launches concert receptions
## Dorm RFs whip up interest for the performing arts 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to a suggestion
from the Residential Arts Pro
gram to offer more arts program
ming in the dorms, Wilbur Hall
residences have begun a new se
ries of concert receptions to intro
duce freshmen to the performing
arts scene on campus.
The resident fellows (RF) at
Wilbur are planning informal re
ceptions in the residences before
Friday night concerts at Bing
Concert Hall and Memorial
Church as part of an effort to fa
cilitate access to these events for
new students, according to David
Davidson, the RF in Trancos.
Since most of these concerts
are free, the receptions provide
early access to tickets and allow
students to socialize before the
events.
The first reception was held on

Nov. 8 in the Cedro lounge before
the Stanford Wind Ensemble per
formance in Bing Concert Hall.
"I like that everyone who is in
terested in the music can get to
gether and talk before, instead of
going and not really getting to
talk about it and just watching,"
said Alyssa Rudelis 'l7, a Cedro
resident. "It's nice to have the
community."
The choice to make these
events open to all Wilbur resi
dents was partially made to pro
vide an outlet for students from
different dorms to meet each oth
er and also for logistical purposes,
said Cedro RF Marcelo Cleriei-
Arias.
"This is one of the events that
perhaps if each dorm independ
ently in Wilbur organizes it, only
a handful of people would go,"
Clerici-Arias said.
For the pilot event last
week, half of the 40 stu
dents who signed up for the
reception and concert came
from Cedro, but four other
dorms sent handfuls of peo
ple as well, Clerici-Arias
added.
About an hour before the
concert, students most
arriving in suits and cocktail
dresses were provided
with deserts and drinks in
the Cedro lounge.
Although many of the
freshmen at the event said
that they had a previous in
terest in music, few had ever
attended a musical event on
campus.
"I've always been really
interested in going to see
cultural, musical events,"
Rudelis said. "And the recep
tion was just a plus."

Organizers said the bulk
of the planning work was fig
uring out a system for order
ing and distributing tickets.
Purchasing the food and
beverages was a small, cru
cial task they did right be
fore the event.
"College students will
never turn down food, so it
never hurts to have a little
motivation," said Rosie La
Puma 'l7.
Students participating in
the reception must physical
ly claim tickets at the Wilbur
Housing Front Desk the af
ternoon before the concert
in addition to submitting an
RSVP Remaining tickets
will be returned to will call.
"I would definitely go to
receptions around Wilbur if
they keep having them for
concerts that I'll be going
to," said Christopher Kimes
'l7.
The RFs intended this
program to bring freshmen
to the arts on campus, but
the program also provides

an easy way for upperclass
man staff or students from
the four-class residence
Okada to continue or begin
to attend these events with
their dorms.
"Actually this is my first
event going to Bing," said
Ben Rosellini 'l5, a Cedro
resident assistant.
While Wilbur residents
have already had the chance
to go to the Monterey Bay
Aquarium in the past and
may attend a Cirque de
Soleil performance this year,
the new on-campus recep
tion program will allow
freshmen to take advantage
of Stanford events, David
son said.
He added that Wilbur
RFs hope to host recep
tions every two to three
weeks on FYiday nights and
the organizers are open to
expanding the receptions
for other types of events.
"The goal of other RFs
is to have us going to the
ater, to improv sessions, to
dance, to comedy," David
son said. "All of those
things will probably hap
pen, we just need to have a
simple way to actually start
it."

attended a musical event on
campus.
"I've always been really
interested in going to see
cultural, musical events,"
Rudelis said. "And the recep
tion was just a plus."

Organizers said the bulk
of the planning work was fig
uring out a system for order
ing and distributing tickets.
Purchasing the food and
beverages was a small, cru
cial task they did right be
fore the event.
"College students will
never turn down food, so it
never hurts to have a little
motivation," said Rosie La
Puma 'l7.
Students participating in
the reception must physical
ly claim tickets at the Wilbur
Housing Front Desk the af
ternoon before the concert
in addition to submitting an
RSVP Remaining tickets
will be returned to will call.
"I would definitely go to
receptions around Wilbur if
they keep having them for
concerts that I'll be going
to," said Christopher Kimes
'l7.
The RFs intended this
program to bring freshmen
to the arts on campus, but
the program also provides

an easy way for upperclass
man staff or students from
the four-class residence
Okada to continue or begin
to attend these events with
their dorms.
"Actually this is my first
event going to Bing," said
Ben Rosellini 'l5, a Cedro
resident assistant.
While Wilbur residents
have already had the chance
to go to the Monterey Bay
Aquarium in the past and
may attend a Cirque de
Soleil performance this year,
the new on-campus recep
tion program will allow
freshmen to take advantage
of Stanford events, David
son said.
He added that Wilbur
RFs hope to host recep
tions every two to three
weeks on FYiday nights and
the organizers are open to
expanding the receptions
for other types of events.
"The goal of other RFs
is to have us going to the
ater, to improv sessions, to
dance, to comedy," David
son said. "All of those
things will probably hap
pen, we just need to have a
simple way to actually start
it."

In response to a suggestion
from the Residential Arts Pro
gram to offer more arts program
ming in the dorms, Wilbur Hall
residences have begun a new se
ries of concert receptions to intro
duce freshmen to the performing
arts scene on campus.
The resident fellows (RF) at
Wilbur are planning informal re
ceptions in the residences before
Friday night concerts at Bing
Concert Hall and Memorial
Church as part of an effort to fa
cilitate access to these events for
new students, according to David
Davidson, the RF in Trancos.
Since most of these concerts
are free, the receptions provide
early access to tickets and allow
students to socialize before the
events.
The first reception was held on

Nov. 8 in the Cedro lounge before
the Stanford Wind Ensemble per
formance in Bing Concert Hall.
"I like that everyone who is in
terested in the music can get to
gether and talk before, instead of
going and not really getting to
talk about it and just watching,"
said Alyssa Rudelis 'l7, a Cedro
resident. "It's nice to have the
community."
The choice to make these
events open to all Wilbur resi
dents was partially made to pro
vide an outlet for students from
different dorms to meet each oth
er and also for logistical purposes,
said Cedro RF Marcelo Cleriei-
Arias.
"This is one of the events that
perhaps if each dorm independ
ently in Wilbur organizes it, only
a handful of people would go,"
Clerici-Arias said.
For the pilot event last
week, half of the 40 stu
dents who signed up for the
reception and concert came
from Cedro, but four other
dorms sent handfuls of peo
ple as well, Clerici-Arias
added.
About an hour before the
concert, students most
arriving in suits and cocktail
dresses were provided
with deserts and drinks in
the Cedro lounge.
Although many of the
freshmen at the event said
that they had a previous in
terest in music, few had ever
attended a musical event on
campus.
"I've always been really
interested in going to see
cultural, musical events,"
Rudelis said. "And the recep
tion was just a plus."

of the planning work was fig
