## GSB renews Bangalore program GSB continues its Ignite educational program in India 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
After a successful pilot program
last year, Stanford's Graduate
School of Business (GSB) will once
again launch its nine-week certifi
cate program in innovation and en
trepreneurship in Bangalore, India,
this April.
The Bangalore program is an
extension of the GSB Ignite educa
tional program that occurs on cam
pus twice a year in January and in
June, giving innovators from a vari
ety of different disciplines an inten
sive core business education and
enabling them to work in teams to
pursue and develop their own ven
tures.
"It's not enough to have an
amazing idea you really have to
understand what is the core value
of what you are creating, what will
it take to execute, and what's the
optimal way of making it success
ful," said Yossi Feinberg, faculty di
rector for the program.
The inaugural Bangalore pro
gram graduated 41 students, who
joined a broader network of more
than 900 participants from which
more than 80 new companies have
been created. Because one of the
qualifications for eligibility to the
program is that the applicant does
not have any previous graduate
business training, these alumni
range from a variety of academic
and professional fields. Over the
course of the nine weeks, students
engage in 100 hours of teaching and
up to 150 hours of out-of-classroom
work.
"This is an intensive academic
experience," said Bethany Coates
MBA 'O4, assistant dean for Global
Innovation Programs at the GSB.
"It's not for someone who wants to
sail through and get a certificate at
the end."
As a testament to the success of
the program, Coates said that of
the eight teams that worked to
gether in Bangalore, four went on
to develope their projects into real
life startups.
Fahad Azad, a participant in the
2013 Ignite Bangalore program,
went on to a start a company
called Robosoft Systems and
invented an unmanned aerial
robot that takes high-resolu
tion photographs of crop
fields with the purpose of
helping farmers in India be
come more efficient with
their produce.
According to Coates, oth
er alumni have gone on to
work in larger, existing corpo
rations such as Oracle,
Google, Apple and Microsoft;
a smaller but still substantial
minority have gone into aca
demia.
Besides the rigorous aca
demic program combined
with teamwork and local
mentorship, a crucial compo
nent of last year's Bangalore
success was the partnership
with Infosys, which enabled
GSB professors who were
scheduled to lecture only once
or twice in India â€”to be
screened in via high-resolu
tion video and microphones
rather than incurring the cost
of round-trip flights.
"This was one of the
things that we worried a lot
about before we launched in
Bangalore because it was a
proof point for us," Coates
said. "If this did not work we
didn't have a program."
"But now we know it
works.... It's an incredibly ef
ficient use of our faculty's

time.... It's a fabulous experi
ence for our students because
rather than only have access
to four of our faculty they
have access to 12," she added.
With regard to the initial
rationale for expanding Ig
nite internationally last
April, Coates commented on
the need for the GSB to gain
global business exposure, to
better relate to the increas
ing numbers of international
Stanford students and to

more broadly pursue the
GSB's mission of providing
business education opportu
nities to those who otherwise
would not have access.
In line with this effort,
the Ignite program will also
be offered in Paris and Bei
jing in 2014.
