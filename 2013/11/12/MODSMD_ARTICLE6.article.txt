## Stanford Challah for Hunger rises to new heights 
### JENNA SHAPIRO 
With a taste for quality challah
and an appetite for social impact,
Stanford's Challah for Hunger
group meets every Thursday to
bake for charitable work.
The student group, sponsored
by the Jewish Student Association,
is a chapter of the national Challah
for Hunger campaign to bake and
sell challah for charity. Stanford's
chapter, which began in 2009, has
quickly gained a notable reputation
as one of the biggest chapters in
the country.
While many other chapters
bake about 30 loaves per week,
Stanford's output has reached
around 200 or more per week this
quarter, according to Rachel Walt
man 'l5, Challah for Hunger volun
teer manager.
Lauren Sweet 'l5, a co-director
of the group who has been involved
since her freshman year, notes that
the group's presence on campus
has grown in the last three years,
something that fellow co-director
Sarah Beller 'l5 said has con
tributed to a greater sense of com
munity.
"There's a wonderful campus

community here," Beller said. "It
comes together to make a really
strong, vibrant program."
The growing demand for chal
lah mirrors a growing desire to
bake. The Hillel kitchen fills up
with volunteers from across the
University from returning vol
unteers and their friends to stu
dents simply drawn in by the
sweet-smelling aroma that sur
rounds the Koret Pavilion at Hillel
each week.
Each week an organization co
sponsors Challah for Hunger and
brings in its own set of new faces as
well.
While 50 percent of Challah for
Hunger profits go to the American
Jewish World Service an organ
ization that provides humanitarian
aid to countries in need such as
Darfur the remaining 50 per
cent of funds are donated to an or
ganization of the co-sponsor's
choice.
In the past quarter, AEPhi do
nated its funds to Sharsheret to
support women with breast cancer;
the Bridge Peer Counseling Center
contributed its share towards brain
