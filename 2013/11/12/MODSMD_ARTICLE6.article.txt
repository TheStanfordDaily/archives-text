## Stanford Challah for Hunger rises to new heights 
### JENNA SHAPIRO 
With a taste for quality challah
and an appetite for social impact,
Stanford's Challah for Hunger
group meets every Thursday to
bake for charitable work.
The student group, sponsored
by the Jewish Student Association,
is a chapter of the national Challah
for Hunger campaign to bake and
sell challah for charity. Stanford's
chapter, which began in 2009, has
quickly gained a notable reputation
as one of the biggest chapters in
the country.
While many other chapters
bake about 30 loaves per week,
Stanford's output has reached
around 200 or more per week this
quarter, according to Rachel Walt
man 'l5, Challah for Hunger volun
teer manager.
Lauren Sweet 'l5, a co-director
of the group who has been involved
since her freshman year, notes that
the group's presence on campus
has grown in the last three years,
something that fellow co-director
Sarah Beller 'l5 said has con
tributed to a greater sense of com
munity.
"There's a wonderful campus

community here," Beller said. "It
comes together to make a really
strong, vibrant program."
The growing demand for chal
lah mirrors a growing desire to
bake. The Hillel kitchen fills up
with volunteers from across the
University from returning vol
unteers and their friends to stu
dents simply drawn in by the
sweet-smelling aroma that sur
rounds the Koret Pavilion at Hillel
each week.
Each week an organization co
sponsors Challah for Hunger and
brings in its own set of new faces as
well.
While 50 percent of Challah for
Hunger profits go to the American
Jewish World Service an organ
ization that provides humanitarian
aid to countries in need such as
Darfur the remaining 50 per
cent of funds are donated to an or
ganization of the co-sponsor's
choice.
In the past quarter, AEPhi do
nated its funds to Sharsheret to
support women with breast cancer;
the Bridge Peer Counseling Center
contributed its share towards brain

and behavior research; and
Camp Kesem gave its funds
to the national Camp Kesem
organization that helps kids
who have been affected by a
parent's cancer, Waltman
said.
Waltman added that mak
ing the bread is "a pretty
time-intensive process, but
it's always worth it."
The two-hour dough-mak
ing shift begins at 4 p.m.,
marking what Waltman de
scribes as a cathartic time to
release stress by manually
mixing the ingredients (ap
proximately 162 pounds of
dough for the 200 loaves each
week) while chatting with
friends.
After another two hours
during which the dough rises,

a new batch of volunteers be
gins the braiding and baking
shift. Finally, around 9:30
p.m., the selling begins.
The whole process is both
social and philanthropic.
"I really enjoy watching
volunteers having a good
time," Sweet said. "When you
have music and you get a re
ally enthusiastic group of vol
unteers who are dancing and
singing and throwing flour
around, it makes a mess but it
makes the experience really
enjoyable."
In order to make the ex
perience as pleasant as possi
ble for volunteers, the Chal
lah for Hunger board contin
ually reflects on the process.
After each baking session,
they meet to discuss what
went well and what didn't, so
that they may continue to im
prove the experience for
everyone.

Weekly flavors include
chocolate chip, garlic rose-

Mary, cinnamon raisin and
classic plain. Rather than us
ing the national Challah for
Hunger recipe, the student
group sticks to "Malkie's
Challah Recipe," offered by
Malkie Kamin, the wife of
Stanford Rabbi Ephraim
Kamin.
Moreover, a special flavor
of the bread is added each
week. These flavors are the
result of an experimental
bake that the Challah for
Hunger board carries out
each quarter.
The board meets to brain
storm a list of potential fla
vors, buys the ingredients for
the most popular ideas, cre
ates a batch of the base dough
and then adds the flavors in
experimental proportions. Af
terward, the group sits
around and tastes the differ
ent flavors, sharing opinions
at will about both the flavor's
taste and its ability to scale.
"It's all very pretentious

sounding, like wine tasting
but with challah," Sweet said
about the discussions.
Although some ideas fail,
such as a Valentine's Day
themed strawberry jam with
chocolate experiment that
was too sticky to scale well,
others have become very pop
ular, Beller said. For example,
the pumpkin challah, when
available, outsells every other
flavor.
Additionally, the board al
ways remains open to flavor
suggestions from the greater
community.
With passionate leaders, a
strong community of volun
teers and a goal of giving to a
variety of social causes, Chal
lah for Hunger has the ingre
dients to continue to grow as
an influential group.
"For me, it's absolutely
chaotic during the baking pe
riod," Waltman said, "but
when you see people finally
walk away with their loaf of

challah and they're just so
happy, you can tell it's the
highlight of their week. It's all
worth it."

"I really enjoy watching
volunteers having a good
time," Sweet said. "When you
have music and you get a re
ally enthusiastic group of vol
unteers who are dancing and
singing and throwing flour
around, it makes a mess but it
makes the experience really
enjoyable."
In order to make the ex
perience as pleasant as possi
ble for volunteers, the Chal
lah for Hunger board contin
ually reflects on the process.
After each baking session,
they meet to discuss what
went well and what didn't, so
that they may continue to im
prove the experience for
everyone.

Weekly flavors include
chocolate chip, garlic rose-

Mary, cinnamon raisin and
classic plain. Rather than us
ing the national Challah for
Hunger recipe, the student
group sticks to "Malkie's
Challah Recipe," offered by
Malkie Kamin, the wife of
Stanford Rabbi Ephraim
Kamin.
Moreover, a special flavor
of the bread is added each
week. These flavors are the
result of an experimental
bake that the Challah for
Hunger board carries out
each quarter.
The board meets to brain
storm a list of potential fla
vors, buys the ingredients for
the most popular ideas, cre
ates a batch of the base dough
and then adds the flavors in
experimental proportions. Af
terward, the group sits
around and tastes the differ
ent flavors, sharing opinions
at will about both the flavor's
taste and its ability to scale.
"It's all very pretentious

sounding, like wine tasting
but with challah," Sweet said
about the discussions.
Although some ideas fail,
such as a Valentine's Day
themed strawberry jam with
chocolate experiment that
was too sticky to scale well,
others have become very pop
ular, Beller said. For example,
the pumpkin challah, when
available, outsells every other
flavor.
Additionally, the board al
ways remains open to flavor
suggestions from the greater
community.
With passionate leaders, a
strong community of volun
teers and a goal of giving to a
variety of social causes, Chal
lah for Hunger has the ingre
dients to continue to grow as
an influential group.
"For me, it's absolutely
chaotic during the baking pe
riod," Waltman said, "but
when you see people finally
walk away with their loaf of

challah and they're just so
happy, you can tell it's the
highlight of their week. It's all
worth it."

With a taste for quality challah
and an appetite for social impact,
Stanford's Challah for Hunger
group meets every Thursday to
bake for charitable work.
The student group, sponsored
by the Jewish Student Association,
is a chapter of the national Challah
for Hunger campaign to bake and
sell challah for charity. Stanford's
chapter, which began in 2009, has
quickly gained a notable reputation
as one of the biggest chapters in
the country.
While many other chapters
bake about 30 loaves per week,
Stanford's output has reached
around 200 or more per week this
quarter, according to Rachel Walt
man 'l5, Challah for Hunger volun
teer manager.
Lauren Sweet 'l5, a co-director
of the group who has been involved
since her freshman year, notes that
the group's presence on campus
has grown in the last three years,
something that fellow co-director
Sarah Beller 'l5 said has con
tributed to a greater sense of com
munity.
"There's a wonderful campus

community here," Beller said. "It
comes together to make a really
strong, vibrant program."
The growing demand for chal
lah mirrors a growing desire to
bake. The Hillel kitchen fills up
with volunteers from across the
University from returning vol
unteers and their friends to stu
dents simply drawn in by the
sweet-smelling aroma that sur
rounds the Koret Pavilion at Hillel
each week.
Each week an organization co
sponsors Challah for Hunger and
brings in its own set of new faces as
well.
While 50 percent of Challah for
Hunger profits go to the American
Jewish World Service an organ
ization that provides humanitarian
aid to countries in need such as
Darfur the remaining 50 per
cent of funds are donated to an or
ganization of the co-sponsor's
choice.
In the past quarter, AEPhi do
nated its funds to Sharsheret to
support women with breast cancer;
the Bridge Peer Counseling Center
contributed its share towards brain

organization that helps kids

Waltman added that mak

time-intensive process, but
it's always worth it."
The two-hour dough-mak
ing shift begins at 4 p.m.,
