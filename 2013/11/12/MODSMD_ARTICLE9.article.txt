## Stanford fans rise to the occasion 
### Ashley Westhem 
Although it's not one of
the big marquee
matchups of the year
by any means (USC
isn't even ranked),
ESPN College Game Day is travel
ling to the Coliseum for the Stan
ford-USC game this Saturday.
I'm excited because this is the
first away football game that I will
be going to as a Stanford student.
While I've been to many of these ri
valry matchups, this will be the first
Cardinal-versus-Trojans game that
I'll be attending as a Stanford fan
please don't hold it against me,
I'm a Tree for life now.
I vaguely remember the game
back in 2007. For a time I blocked it
out as a bad memory... until I got to
Stanford and started reliving that
24-23 win and saying with pride that
I was there. Yes, it may seem that I
was being wishy-washy with my
teams, but in the end I follow the
advice of the Beach Boys and will al
ways remember to "Be True to Your
School." So next Saturday I will be
cheering from the USC alumni sec
tion for the Card, decked out in
Stanford gear.
Speaking of being true to your
school, I'd like to point out the
amazing display of support that the
Red Zone and Stanford community
showed last Thursday. Honestly, I
still can't even believe that that win
played out as it did. As sophomores,
my friends and I have only ever ex
perienced a winning Stanford sea
son, so when the Card sprinted out
to an early lead, it felt like nothing
new except that we were beating
Oregon. A team that we were sup
posed to lose to last year, and yet
pulled ahead of at the last second
and a team that we were certainly
supposed to lose to this year. But we
didn't.
I had to keep reminding the
friends around me to appreciate the
fact that we held the Ducks score
less for three quarters. We definite
ly stopped and basked in the touch
downs and field goals that were be
ing racked up by our boys as an
Oregon player sat on the sideline
with his head in his hands and cried
with plenty of time left in the
game, I might add since the
Ducks just weren't used to losing
like that.
Oregon fans took advantage of
the fact that their team was so good
and gloated and bragged up until
the game. A writer for the Daily
Emerald was quoted in his game
prediction saying, "This is a tough
one, not in the matter of who wins
but what's the score." Whereas
Stanford fans were just happy to be
considered a big-time program that
could compete with Oregon. And
then when the Card came through it
was surreal.
But really the amount of
support on Thursday was
awesome. When I biked
through White Plaza during
the ESPN rally at lunchtime,
it was filled with students,
alumni and fans from near
and far.
Students started lining up
outside the Red Zone hours
before kickoff. My friends got
in line at 2:30 p.m. and didn't
even get first row seats. It's
amazing that this culture of

fandom and hype surround
ing athletic events is happen
ing on campus. Football is
definitely the traceable cause
of this and I'm not saying this
will rub off on support for
other teams, but it's a start.
Athletics at Stanford are
just as exciting as the academ
ics here, and there's nothing
wrong with being true to your
school and taking a break
from that problem set to
cheer on friends and class
mates. Athletes should be rec
ognized for the hard work
that they put in.
The football team put in
the work on Thursday, espe
cially the defense, and I'm

sure the fan support and en
ergy in Stanford Stadium
helped them to achieve that
epic win. Just read the post
game tweet from Shayne
Skov and you can feel the
love and appreciation that
Stanford athletes share when
they get the support they de
serve: "On behalf of our
team, last night was incredi
ble. The crowd noise and at
mosphere was the greatest in
my 5 years. TY nerdnation."
