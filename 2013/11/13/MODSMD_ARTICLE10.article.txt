SF: A lot of people know you not

for your swimming, but for your
outfit at football games. They've
seen you on Sports Illustrated's
website. Talk about your football
game day tradition.

BO: So there was this guy
Michael Zoldos 'l2 who was a jun
ior when I was a freshman. And
his senior year, he had this or
ange prison jumpsuit that had
been handed down from some
older guy... who graduated in the
early 2000s. And we were out at a
tailgate over at Suites where we

live, and he was just wearing it
for no reason. And I was like,
"Dude, that's kind of funny. I
should go put on my orange tuxe
do so we're both wearing orange.'
We went right from there to the
game in our bright orange stuff
and we were like, 'Dude, we'll to
tally get on TV It's the Red
Zone, so everyone's wearing red
and sometimes white, but then
there's going to be us in bright
orange.' So I got so many com
ments on it that I started wearing
it all the time.

I bought it for my junior year
prom in high school, and that did
not go over well. What happened
was I started dating this girl in
November, and right when we
started dating I was like, "If we
go to prom, can I get an orange
tuxedo?" Because that was too
early in the relationship for her to
say no. So she was like, "Yeah,
sure," not thinking that I would
actually do it. But then I did it
and she was not pleased at all.


Senior distance swimmer Bryan Offutt (above) is in his final year on the Farm as he continues to balance a grueling computer science
courseload with his obligations to the swim team. Offutt is locally famous for wearing an orange tuxedo in the stands at football games.
