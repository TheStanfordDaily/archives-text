## A 						CHAT WITH BRYAN OFFUTT 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
In the third 2013-11 edi

The Daily's Sam Fisher
chatted with men's swim
ming senior Bryan Offutt.
The following is a condensed
version of their conversation.

SF: A lot of people know you not

for your swimming, but for your
outfit at football games. They've
seen you on Sports Illustrated's
website. Talk about your football
game day tradition.

BO: So there was this guy
Michael Zoldos 'l2 who was a jun
ior when I was a freshman. And
his senior year, he had this or
ange prison jumpsuit that had
been handed down from some
older guy... who graduated in the
early 2000s. And we were out at a
tailgate over at Suites where we

live, and he was just wearing it
for no reason. And I was like,
"Dude, that's kind of funny. I
should go put on my orange tuxe
do so we're both wearing orange.'
We went right from there to the
game in our bright orange stuff
and we were like, 'Dude, we'll to
tally get on TV It's the Red
Zone, so everyone's wearing red
and sometimes white, but then
there's going to be us in bright
orange.' So I got so many com
ments on it that I started wearing
it all the time.

I bought it for my junior year
prom in high school, and that did
not go over well. What happened
was I started dating this girl in
November, and right when we
started dating I was like, "If we
go to prom, can I get an orange
tuxedo?" Because that was too
early in the relationship for her to
say no. So she was like, "Yeah,
sure," not thinking that I would
actually do it. But then I did it
and she was not pleased at all.


Senior distance swimmer Bryan Offutt (above) is in his final year on the Farm as he continues to balance a grueling computer science
courseload with his obligations to the swim team. Offutt is locally famous for wearing an orange tuxedo in the stands at football games.
SF: So as a senior, you're also
getting close to finishing the
academic side of things. Can
you give us an update on what
you've been doing academi
cally?
BO: I'm a computer science
major. It's getting pretty bru
tal. Usually I try to not take
three CS classes at a time.
This quarter I am. I'm taking
CS 221, CS 229 and CS 145.
SF: How did you get into
computer science? Was it a
single class that did it?
BO: It was CS 106A. It's
where they get you. I think a
lot of people have that. I actu
ally section lead too. CS 106A
is so wonderfully designed
because you go in and they
trick you. You just make
games and stuff. And you're
like, "Dude, that's so cool. I
made Hangman! This is awe
some!" And then as you go
along you take 107, and you're
like, "This is nerd cool, but
I'm not going to show my

friends my heap allocator."

SF: Talk about being a section
leader. I'm guessing there
aren't that many people who
have time to be a Stanford
student, a Stanford athlete
and section lead as well.
BO: I did it last spring. It was
something that I really want
ed to do. The spring is our
"offseason."... I knew I was
going to have a little extra
time so I decided to do it. And
it was awesome. It definitely
was time consuming. I got
fortunate though... I had a
section of like 10 people, but
before the first section I had
four people drop. So I had the
world's tiniest section, which
made it a little more manage
able to go to practice, grade
the stuff, get everything done.
I think I was probably one
of the stranger section lead
ers. I'd be up there in like a
tie-dye shirt with no shoes on.
SF: What are you better at
teaching: swimming or com
puter science?
BO: Probably computer sci
ence, honestly. I'm a distance
swimmer. The sprinters are
more of the guys who think
about everything because
they're doing a 50. The dive
has to be perfect, the wall has
to be perfect, the turn has to
be perfect, the finish has to
be perfect. It's quite nerve
racking. That and the mar
gin of error at NCAAs if
you go a tenth of a second
slower in the 50, you're not
in the final. Whereas dis
tance swimming, you kind of

train hard and when it hurts
you just go, "Oh well," and
keep plugging along. I'm not
technically the best swim
mer, so I'm definitely better
at teaching computer sci
ence.
SF: I know we're still early in
the year, but have you given
any thought at all to what role
swimming will play in your
life after this season ends?
BO: I'm definitely going to
take time off. We joke around.
Despite how much I swim, I'm
not the six-pack kind of
ripped-up guy like a lot of my
teammates. So the big joke is,
"Bryan's not going to exer
cise for six months and is just
going to get huge." They say
that one of two things is go
ing to happen: I'm not going
to exercise at all and just sit
around and eat a bunch of
candy and gain a lot of weight
or, slightly less likely, I'm go
ing to have some sort of divine
inspiration... and just get
massive [from lifting weights].

SF: What about the computer
science side? Are you looking
for jobs?

BO: I'm looking for jobs. I in
terned at Palantir over the
summer. I have a standing
offer from them. I'm think

ing about that, but I'm also
interviewing around. I'm
mostly trying to figure out if
I want to do something tech
nical or slightly less techni
cal. It's that classic thing
where I like to code a lot, but
I also like to work with peo
ple. And so it's trying to find
either something that's kind
of in between or pick one or
the other.
SF: So a distance swimmer
that likes to work with peo
ple? That doesn't seem to gel.
The distance swimming and
the computer science, now
that seems to go together.
BO: (Laughs.) I like people.
SF: Who is going to replace
your bubbly personality on
the team?
BO: Freshman Jimmy Yoder.
Actually, the orange tuxedo is
getting passed down. And I
don't want to reveal who it's
definitely going to go to, but
right now Yoder is the front
runner. Kind of a goofball,
very excitable, kind of wide
eyed type of freshman I
think he has a good shot of be
ing the next me. [He's] kind of
the goofball of the group.

tuxedo?" Because that was too
early in the relationship for her to
say no. So she was like, "Yeah,
sure," not thinking that I would
actually do it. But then I did it
and she was not pleased at all.


Senior distance swimmer Bryan Offutt (above) is in his final year on the Farm as he continues to balance a grueling computer science
courseload with his obligations to the swim team. Offutt is locally famous for wearing an orange tuxedo in the stands at football games.
SF: So as a senior, you're also
getting close to finishing the
academic side of things. Can
you give us an update on what
you've been doing academi
cally?
BO: I'm a computer science
major. It's getting pretty bru
tal. Usually I try to not take
three CS classes at a time.
This quarter I am. I'm taking
CS 221, CS 229 and CS 145.
SF: How did you get into
computer science? Was it a
single class that did it?
BO: It was CS 106A. It's
where they get you. I think a
lot of people have that. I actu
ally section lead too. CS 106A
is so wonderfully designed
because you go in and they
trick you. You just make
games and stuff. And you're
like, "Dude, that's so cool. I
made Hangman! This is awe
some!" And then as you go
along you take 107, and you're
like, "This is nerd cool, but
I'm not going to show my

friends my heap allocator."

SF: Talk about being a section
leader. I'm guessing there
aren't that many people who
have time to be a Stanford
student, a Stanford athlete
and section lead as well.
BO: I did it last spring. It was
something that I really want
ed to do. The spring is our
"offseason."... I knew I was
going to have a little extra
time so I decided to do it. And
it was awesome. It definitely
was time consuming. I got
fortunate though... I had a
section of like 10 people, but
before the first section I had
four people drop. So I had the
world's tiniest section, which
made it a little more manage
able to go to practice, grade
the stuff, get everything done.
I think I was probably one
of the stranger section lead
ers. I'd be up there in like a
tie-dye shirt with no shoes on.
SF: What are you better at
teaching: swimming or com
puter science?
BO: Probably computer sci
ence, honestly. I'm a distance
swimmer. The sprinters are
more of the guys who think
about everything because
they're doing a 50. The dive
has to be perfect, the wall has
to be perfect, the turn has to
be perfect, the finish has to
be perfect. It's quite nerve
racking. That and the mar
gin of error at NCAAs if
you go a tenth of a second
slower in the 50, you're not
in the final. Whereas dis
tance swimming, you kind of

train hard and when it hurts
you just go, "Oh well," and
keep plugging along. I'm not
technically the best swim
mer, so I'm definitely better
at teaching computer sci
ence.
SF: I know we're still early in
the year, but have you given
any thought at all to what role
swimming will play in your
life after this season ends?
BO: I'm definitely going to
take time off. We joke around.
Despite how much I swim, I'm
not the six-pack kind of
ripped-up guy like a lot of my
teammates. So the big joke is,
"Bryan's not going to exer
cise for six months and is just
going to get huge." They say
that one of two things is go
ing to happen: I'm not going
to exercise at all and just sit
around and eat a bunch of
candy and gain a lot of weight
or, slightly less likely, I'm go
ing to have some sort of divine
inspiration... and just get
massive [from lifting weights].

SF: What about the computer
science side? Are you looking
for jobs?

BO: I'm looking for jobs. I in
terned at Palantir over the
summer. I have a standing
offer from them. I'm think

ing about that, but I'm also
interviewing around. I'm
mostly trying to figure out if
I want to do something tech
nical or slightly less techni
cal. It's that classic thing
where I like to code a lot, but
I also like to work with peo
ple. And so it's trying to find
either something that's kind
of in between or pick one or
the other.
SF: So a distance swimmer
that likes to work with peo
ple? That doesn't seem to gel.
The distance swimming and
the computer science, now
that seems to go together.
BO: (Laughs.) I like people.
SF: Who is going to replace
your bubbly personality on
the team?
BO: Freshman Jimmy Yoder.
Actually, the orange tuxedo is
getting passed down. And I
don't want to reveal who it's
definitely going to go to, but
right now Yoder is the front
runner. Kind of a goofball,
very excitable, kind of wide
eyed type of freshman I
think he has a good shot of be
ing the next me. [He's] kind of
the goofball of the group.

In the third 2013-11 edi

The Daily's Sam Fisher
chatted with men's swim
ming senior Bryan Offutt.
The following is a condensed
version of their conversation.
For the full transcript, go to
www. Stanford Daily. com/cat
egory/sports.

SF: A lot of people know you not

for your swimming, but for your
outfit at football games. They've
seen you on Sports Illustrated's
website. Talk about your football
game day tradition.

BO: So there was this guy
Michael Zoldos 'l2 who was a jun
ior when I was a freshman. And
his senior year, he had this or
ange prison jumpsuit that had
been handed down from some
older guy... who graduated in the
early 2000s. And we were out at a
tailgate over at Suites where we

live, and he was just wearing it
for no reason. And I was like,
"Dude, that's kind of funny. I
should go put on my orange tuxe
do so we're both wearing orange.'
We went right from there to the
game in our bright orange stuff
and we were like, 'Dude, we'll to
tally get on TV It's the Red
Zone, so everyone's wearing red
and sometimes white, but then
there's going to be us in bright
orange.' So I got so many com
ments on it that I started wearing
it all the time.

I bought it for my junior year
prom in high school, and that did
not go over well. What happened
was I started dating this girl in
November, and right when we
started dating I was like, "If we
go to prom, can I get an orange
tuxedo?" Because that was too
early in the relationship for her to
say no. So she was like, "Yeah,
