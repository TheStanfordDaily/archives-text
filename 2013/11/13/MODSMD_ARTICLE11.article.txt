## WILL THE WIN STREAK SURVIVE? Roundtable talks Trojan revenge 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Stanford is riding a four-game
winning streak against USC as it
enters this 'weekend's matchup
with its SoCal rival, marking
the most consecutive games the
Cardinal has ever won against
the Trojans. Each of Stanford's
last three wins, however, has
been decided by a very close
margin. USC has been play ing
much better football since the
firing of head coach Lane Kif

this a trap_ game for the No. j
Card, as it opened as just a
three-point favorite. We asked
football writers Winston Shi,
David Cohn and Do-Hyoung
Park: Could this be the year that
the Trojans get revenge ?
Winston: No. On the contrary, since
Stanford has won every single foot

Southern California since I started
following Stanford football, my em
pirical findings show that Stanford
will beat USC every year until the
end of time.
In all seriousness, let's not think
that the possibility of losing means
that Stanford will lose at least not
this year. You have to lose occasional
ly for a rivalry to be meaningful,
much as I hate to admit it. But I can
say that I hope that Stanford will nev
er lose to USC because I know they
will eventually. 2013, however, doesn't
look to be the Trojans' year.
During USC's recent run of good
form, its once-putrid, now-passable
offense has allowed defensive coordi
nator Clancy Pendergast to flash the
aggressiveness that made him fa
mousâ€” something that he couldn't
do at Cal. If Stanford can stop the
USC offense, Pendergast's defense
will suffer in turn.
Conversely, if Stanford doesn't
come out with guns blazing, the de
fense is still good enough to win the
