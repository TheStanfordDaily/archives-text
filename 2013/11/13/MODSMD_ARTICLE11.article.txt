## WILL THE WIN STREAK SURVIVE? Roundtable talks Trojan revenge 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Stanford is riding a four-game
winning streak against USC as it
enters this 'weekend's matchup
with its SoCal rival, marking
the most consecutive games the
Cardinal has ever won against
the Trojans. Each of Stanford's
last three wins, however, has
been decided by a very close
margin. USC has been play ing
much better football since the
firing of head coach Lane Kif
fin, and with College Game Day
on hand, many are dubbing
this a trap_ game for the No. j
Card, as it opened as just a
three-point favorite. We asked
football writers Winston Shi,
David Cohn and Do-Hyoung
Park: Could this be the year that
the Trojans get revenge ?
Winston: No. On the contrary, since
Stanford has won every single foot
ball game against the University of
Southern California since I started
following Stanford football, my em
pirical findings show that Stanford
will beat USC every year until the
end of time.
In all seriousness, let's not think
that the possibility of losing means
that Stanford will lose at least not
this year. You have to lose occasional
ly for a rivalry to be meaningful,
much as I hate to admit it. But I can
say that I hope that Stanford will nev
er lose to USC because I know they
will eventually. 2013, however, doesn't
look to be the Trojans' year.
During USC's recent run of good
form, its once-putrid, now-passable
offense has allowed defensive coordi
nator Clancy Pendergast to flash the
aggressiveness that made him fa
mous— something that he couldn't
do at Cal. If Stanford can stop the
USC offense, Pendergast's defense
will suffer in turn.
Conversely, if Stanford doesn't
come out with guns blazing, the de
fense is still good enough to win the
game, but Marqise Lee is one of the
precious few wideouts in the coun
try that can trash the Stanford sec
ondary on his day. Neither USC's
track record nor its depth suggests
that it can reliably take on the Car
dinal, but can it get lucky on a few
deep routes? Definitely. Do I think
it will happen? No. Southern Cal is
not at Stanford's level yet. The Tro
jans got stomped by ASU and also
lost to WSU and Notre Dame. Hire
Kiffin.

David: I do not believe Stanford is
due for a loss, at least not after the
complete annihilation of the Ore
gon Ducks that I witnessed last
Thursday night. If Stanford plays
at a level even remotely close to
that of its showing against the
Ducks, USC does not stand a
chance, regardless of any poten
tial home-field advantage.
However, if the Cardinal is off
its game, particularly on offense,
Saturday's matchup could turn in
to a defensive slugfest that would
ironically benefit the Trojans. I
say ironically because Stanford

has built a perennial BCS-con
tending program by winning low
scoring, defensive contests. How
ever, SC's one-dimensional of
fense will struggle mightily to
score on one of the best defensive

units in the country, so the Tro
jans will have to rely on their own
talented defense in order to win.
Another factor that could
cause the Card problems on Sat
urday is the atmosphere at the

Coliseum. The Coliseum is by far
the largest stadium in the Pac-12,
and as such, can be extremely
loud when a marquee team like
Stanford visits Los Angeles. As
the Cardinal saw in 2011, the
crowd will be hostile and engaged
from the opening kickoff, so it is
imperative that Stanford takes
the Trojan fans out of the game
with an early touchdown or
turnover.
Ultimately, if the Card puts up
a solid performance in all three
facets of the game, Stanford will
win comfortably without much
angst. However, if the Cardinal
struggles, USC will be competi
tive throughout and have a chance
to win.

Do: If there's one thing that I've
learned in my time on the Farm,
it's the sentiment that Sam insinu
ated in his Monday column that
when facing the Men of Troy, the
game is always somehow closer
than everybody expects it to be.
That being said, Stanford has
had more consistent play on both
sides of the ball all year, and al
though the Trojans are currently
on the rise, is there any better
boost to a team's confidence than
not just beating, but thoroughly
crushing a seemingly invincible
Oregon team? I have no doubt
that Stanford's players will storm
the Coliseum with extra swagger
in their steps and look to finish the
meat of their Pac-12 journey with
a flourish, especially against the
hated Trojans.

USC's offense has been noth
ing more than mediocre all year
and has also been woefully incon
sistent. Although wideouts Mar
qise Lee and Nelson Agholor are
capable of burning secondaries
and making explosive plays, quar
terback Cody Kessler is inexperi
enced. After seeing how the Car
dinal defense shut down the con
nection between the more experi
enced Sean Mannion and Brandin
Cooks in Corvallis, I don't think
either Lee or Agholor are due for
big games.
In addition, we've all seen what
Stanford's rush defense is capable
of. It held Oregon Oregon!
to just 62 yards on the ground and
is again top 10 in the nation with
98.7 rush yards allowed per game.
Although USC is bigger up front
than Oregon and has a more
physical stable of backs, I just
don't see the Trojan offense gash
ing the Stanford defense. Al
though it might not be a blowout,
I think that Stanford should com
fortably win its final Pac-12 chal
lenge (sorry, Cal) on the back of its
defense.

Winston Shi David Cohn and Do-
Hyoung Park are co-founders of
the "Lane Kiffin for President"
club on Stanford's campus and are
hoping to establish an outreach hub
in Los Angeles when they head to
the Coliseum this weekend for the
game. Tell them why that might be
a bad idea at wshm@stanford.

Fifth-year senior linebacker Shayne Skov (11) has never lost to the Trojans in his time playing for the Cardinal. He and the rest of the team will
look to make it five straight victories against a resurgent USC team on Saturday.
