# EYES ON TROY
## CARD REMAINS FOCUSED AFTER OREGON WIN 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
November 7 has come and
gone, and so has the euphoria of
Stanford's monumental win
against Oregon on that Thurs
day night. In its place at Tues
day's weekly press conference
was an overwhelming sense of
mental fatigue from the long
grind of Pac-12 conference play.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal re
mains focused on preparing for
its clash at the Coliseum with
USC this Saturday.
"In practice, it's about mak
ing sure you're locked in on
every single rep," said fifth-year
senior linebacker Shayne Skov.
"Increasing your level of play
mentally can be very difficult
this time of year, but that's what
the great ones do."
While Skov and his team
mates will continue to work to

stay mentally sharp before Sat
urday, he noted that the Cardinal
continues to thrive off of the en
ergy of big games. Against Ore
gon, the emotion of senior defen
sive end Henry Anderson, who
returned from a knee injury,
caught Skov's eye in particular.
"[Anderson] celebrating after
that sack against Oregon was
the first time I've seen him
demonstrate any sort of flair or
substance [after a play] in my
entire career," Skov said. "I'd
say he was as bland as a saltine
cracker. We'd been waiting for
something from him and he de
livered."
Anderson's return to the line
up against the Ducks provided a
huge spark for an ailing Stan
ford defensive line. "The Goose,"
as he is called by his teammates,
recorded five tackles with one
half-sack and showed no dis
cernible signs of rust from his

six-game layoff. However, An
derson did mention that he had
some jitters before taking the
field on Thursday.
"I was a little nervous going
out there full speed, having to
tackle guys," Anderson admit
ted. "After the first drive or two,
it felt pretty normal."
Anderson also mentioned
that his knee held up very well
following the Oregon game and
can now devote his energy to
preparing for USC, a matchup
that he anticipates will be
tough based on the history of
the rivalry.
"I don't know what it is about
USC, but they always seem to
play a good game against us,"
Anderson said. "I feel like we've
always caught them at a point in
the season where they're playing
really well. They're always a

good team. It's not like
they're going to roll over and
just let us blow them out."
Stanford head coach
David Shaw echoed Ander
son's sentiment that the
resurgence of the Trojans in
recent weeks following the
dismissal of head coach
Lane Kiffin will provide a
tough test for his squad
come Saturday.
"This is a big game for
both teams in respect to
where we are in the confer
ence," Shaw said. "You go
down there expecting every
thing. I expect it to be wild
and crazy, and I expect it to
come down to the end of the
game."
Furthermore, Shaw
praised Anderson, Skov and
fifth-year senior defensive
end Josh Mauro for their
stellar play against the
Ducks, a performance that
held one of the nation's most
potent offenses scoreless
through three quarters.
Shaw also noted that his cor
nerbacks, who played excep
tionally well against Oregon,
have continued to remain
under the radar.
"The guys that nobody
talks about are our corners,"
Shaw said. "[Oregon] want
ed to take a couple of shots,
but our guys didn't let that
happen and made them hold
the ball."
Shaw also revealed that
he shared several messages
of motivation with his team
prior to the game, including
a note from Tiger Woods '9B,
who was competing overseas
in Turkey at the time.
"Everything with Tiger
is about mentality and ap
proaching something that's
difficult [by] coming right at
it as opposed to creeping up
on it," Shaw said. "I think

that's a great mentality to
have, and I shared that with
our guys."
On the injury front, Shaw
reported that senior kicker
Jordan Williamson is contin
uing to recover from his leg
injury and will kick field
goals but likely not kickoffs
against Southern Cal. Shaw
also noted that senior run
ning back Tyler Gaffney
needed 48 hours to recuper
ate from the bruising he
took after carrying the ball a
school-record 45 times
against Oregon.
Regarding Gaffney, fifth
year senior offensive guard
Kevin Danser stated that
the entire offensive line
maintains a good relation
ship with the workhorse
running back.
"One day [in training
camp] he brought us Krispy
Kreme [doughnuts],"
Danser said. "I've been try
ing to get him to take us out
to dinner, and I'm sure he
will. If he wants to keep
bringing us Krispy Kremes
though, we'll gladly accept."
If Danser and the Stan
ford offensive line can con
tinue to open holes for
Gaffney against the strong
USC rush defense that is
ranked second in the Pac
-12, perhaps that dinner will
come sooner rather than
later.

down there expecting every
thing. I expect it to be wild
and crazy, and I expect it to
come down to the end of the
game."
Furthermore, Shaw
praised Anderson, Skov and
fifth-year senior defensive
end Josh Mauro for their
stellar play against the
Ducks, a performance that
held one of the nation's most
potent offenses scoreless
through three quarters.
Shaw also noted that his cor
nerbacks, who played excep
tionally well against Oregon,
have continued to remain
under the radar.
"The guys that nobody
talks about are our corners,"
Shaw said. "[Oregon] want
ed to take a couple of shots,
but our guys didn't let that
happen and made them hold
the ball."
Shaw also revealed that
he shared several messages
of motivation with his team
prior to the game, including
a note from Tiger Woods '9B,
who was competing overseas
in Turkey at the time.
"Everything with Tiger
is about mentality and ap
proaching something that's
difficult [by] coming right at
it as opposed to creeping up
on it," Shaw said. "I think

that's a great mentality to
have, and I shared that with
our guys."
On the injury front, Shaw
reported that senior kicker
Jordan Williamson is contin
uing to recover from his leg
injury and will kick field
goals but likely not kickoffs
against Southern Cal. Shaw
also noted that senior run
ning back Tyler Gaffney
needed 48 hours to recuper
ate from the bruising he
took after carrying the ball a
school-record 45 times
against Oregon.
Regarding Gaffney, fifth
year senior offensive guard
Kevin Danser stated that
the entire offensive line
maintains a good relation
ship with the workhorse
running back.
"One day [in training
camp] he brought us Krispy
Kreme [doughnuts],"
Danser said. "I've been try
ing to get him to take us out
to dinner, and I'm sure he
will. If he wants to keep
bringing us Krispy Kremes
though, we'll gladly accept."
If Danser and the Stan
ford offensive line can con
tinue to open holes for
Gaffney against the strong
USC rush defense that is
ranked second in the Pac
-12, perhaps that dinner will
come sooner rather than
later.

DAVID SHAW,
HEAD COACH
November 7 has come and
gone, and so has the euphoria of
Stanford's monumental win
against Oregon on that Thurs
day night. In its place at Tues
day's weekly press conference
was an overwhelming sense of
mental fatigue from the long
grind of Pac-12 conference play.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal re
mains focused on preparing for
its clash at the Coliseum with
USC this Saturday.
"In practice, it's about mak
ing sure you're locked in on
every single rep," said fifth-year
senior linebacker Shayne Skov.
"Increasing your level of play
mentally can be very difficult
this time of year, but that's what
the great ones do."
While Skov and his team
mates will continue to work to

stay mentally sharp before Sat
urday, he noted that the Cardinal
continues to thrive off of the en
ergy of big games. Against Ore
gon, the emotion of senior defen
sive end Henry Anderson, who
returned from a knee injury,
caught Skov's eye in particular.
"[Anderson] celebrating after
that sack against Oregon was
the first time I've seen him
demonstrate any sort of flair or
substance [after a play] in my
entire career," Skov said. "I'd
say he was as bland as a saltine
cracker. We'd been waiting for
something from him and he de
livered."
Anderson's return to the line
up against the Ducks provided a
huge spark for an ailing Stan
ford defensive line. "The Goose,"
as he is called by his teammates,
recorded five tackles with one
half-sack and showed no dis
cernible signs of rust from his

six-game layoff. However, An
derson did mention that he had
some jitters before taking the
field on Thursday.
"I was a little nervous going
out there full speed, having to
tackle guys," Anderson admit
ted. "After the first drive or two,
it felt pretty normal."
Anderson also mentioned
that his knee held up very well
following the Oregon game and
can now devote his energy to
preparing for USC, a matchup
that he anticipates will be
tough based on the history of
the rivalry.
"I don't know what it is about
USC, but they always seem to
play a good game against us,"
Anderson said. "I feel like we've
always caught them at a point in
the season where they're playing
really well. They're always a

good team. It's not like
they're going to roll over and
just let us blow them out."
Stanford head coach
David Shaw echoed Ander
son's sentiment that the
resurgence of the Trojans in
recent weeks following the
dismissal of head coach
Lane Kiffin will provide a
tough test for his squad
come Saturday.
"This is a big game for
