# EYES ON TROY
## CARD REMAINS FOCUSED AFTER OREGON WIN 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
November 7 has come and
gone, and so has the euphoria of
Stanford's monumental win
against Oregon on that Thurs
day night. In its place at Tues
day's weekly press conference
was an overwhelming sense of
mental fatigue from the long
grind of Pac-12 conference play.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal re
mains focused on preparing for
its clash at the Coliseum with
USC this Saturday.
"In practice, it's about mak
ing sure you're locked in on
every single rep," said fifth-year
senior linebacker Shayne Skov.
"Increasing your level of play
mentally can be very difficult
this time of year, but that's what
the great ones do."
While Skov and his team
mates will continue to work to

stay mentally sharp before Sat
urday, he noted that the Cardinal
continues to thrive off of the en
ergy of big games. Against Ore
gon, the emotion of senior defen
sive end Henry Anderson, who
returned from a knee injury,
caught Skov's eye in particular.
"[Anderson] celebrating after
that sack against Oregon was
the first time I've seen him
demonstrate any sort of flair or
substance [after a play] in my
entire career," Skov said. "I'd
say he was as bland as a saltine
cracker. We'd been waiting for
something from him and he de
livered."
Anderson's return to the line
up against the Ducks provided a
huge spark for an ailing Stan
ford defensive line. "The Goose,"
as he is called by his teammates,
recorded five tackles with one
half-sack and showed no dis
cernible signs of rust from his

six-game layoff. However, An
derson did mention that he had
some jitters before taking the
field on Thursday.
"I was a little nervous going
out there full speed, having to
tackle guys," Anderson admit
ted. "After the first drive or two,
it felt pretty normal."
Anderson also mentioned
that his knee held up very well
following the Oregon game and
can now devote his energy to
preparing for USC, a matchup
that he anticipates will be
tough based on the history of
the rivalry.
"I don't know what it is about
USC, but they always seem to
play a good game against us,"
Anderson said. "I feel like we've
always caught them at a point in
the season where they're playing
really well. They're always a

in his return from injury against Oregon and will look to continue to make up for lost time at USC.
