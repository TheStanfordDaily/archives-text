## SEEING GREEN The 						Redwood Climatic Distillery 
### Holly Moeller 
As a gray ceiling closed over
Main Beach mid-Saturday af
ternoon, those of us waiting on
volleyball games scrambled for our
sweaters.
Anyone accustomed to spending
long hours playing volleyball, surf
ing, hiking or just lounging about on
the Northern California coast quick
ly learns that packing layers is de
riguer: The offshore marine layer
and attendant coastal fog can sweep
in at any time, turning a sunny day
suddenly chilly.
The coastal fog is formed by a
combination of atmospheric and
oceanic phenomena. The cold Pacific
waters incubate chilly, moist air just
next to the coastline. When the sun
heats up further inland (Think
triple-degree temperatures in the
Central Valley, and you'll understand
why San Francisco's always foggy in
Summer.), that hot air rises, creating
a vacuum that sucks the cool air in
land from the coast, condensing its
moisture into fog as it goes.
Fortunately for me, I love fog and
clouds for their own sake. But for
those of you who prefer a sunny sky,
it's useful to remember that the un
comfortable weather also waters
some of the most beautiful trees on
the planet.
California's coastal redwoods, the
tallest organisms on the planet, re
ly on fog to meet their water needs
during the long and otherwise-dry
summer season. Fog condenses on
the giant trees' branches, seeps di
rectly into the photosynthetically
active needles, and drips down onto
the forest floor below. This mois
ture source is so important that it
accounts for up to 40% of the water
in the ecosystem annually.
In addition to being giants, red
woods are also extraordinarily
long-lived. Some will live for 2,000
years; many survive into their 500's
and beyond. This turns out to be
both impressive, and scientifically
useful.
Trees grow outwards, putting
down a new layer of tissue just under
their bark each year, so they form
annual rings that record information
about the environment. For exam
ple, we've known for a long time that
a thick annual ring indicates a good
year for growth. You can also look
through tree rings to find evidence
of fire scars, and the signature of nu
clear testing, which produced a spike
in radioactive carbon-14 in the 1950s
and 60s.
Because redwood trees are so old,
their tree rings read like a centuries
old book rich with information dating
back long before our human scientific
studies. For example, scientists at the
University of Washington and UC-
Berkeley just published a method to
tell how much fog and rain a redwood
experienced in a given year.
Their study relies upon some
thing called isotopic fractionation.
Each atom - in this case, of oxygen -
has a particular weight that's deter
mined by the number of protons and
neutrons in its nucleus. Different iso
topes are atoms of the same element,
but with different weights (because
they have different numbers of neu
trons).
Heavier atoms behave differently
than lighter ones. For example, just
like at the gym, where it's tougher to
hold up a heavier weight than a
lighter one, heavier atoms tend to
"fall" (e.g., be left out of various
physical and biological processes)
more frequently than lighter ones.
Compared to fog, rainwater is rela
tively "light": that is, a rain droplet's
cluster of water molecules has more
oxygen-16 compared to oxygen-18 (a
heavier isotope) than a droplet con
densed from fog. Both fog and rain
are formed in the same way from
water that's evaporated off the
ocean.
So they start out with the same
isotopic signature. But while fog of
ten forms, moves inland, and con
denses in the same day, rain clouds
can spend a long time hovering over
the ocean. During this time, some of
the water in them condenses and
falls out as rain. And those heavy
oxygen-18 isotopes, of course, fall
out first and fastest, a phenomenon
called Rayleigh distillation.
Scientists use these differing
oxygen isotopic signatures to figure
out where a tree's water came from
in a given year. After double-check
ing to make sure that their numbers
line up with independently collected
measurements of rainfall and fog
days, they can then use this method
to study the climate over a tree's life
time.

Unfortunately, these woody cli
mate experts might not be available
to help us track climate for much
longer. The fog that sustains them
has declined by 30% over the past
century, and this trend is likely to

continue as greenhouse gas emis
sions shift our climate. And while
this might be great news for beach
volleyball and San Francisco sum
mer tourism, it will mean fewer awe
inspiring giants monitoring our
coastline.
