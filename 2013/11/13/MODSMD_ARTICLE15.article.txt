## Not So Disenchanted About Russia 
### Carolyn Wheatley 
Two months into my study
abroad here in Moscow, I
have this to say: Russia can
be a depressing place, but much
more so if you fail to look past the
political flaws, lack of social mobili
ty, and general gloominess.
Moscow is neither Eastern nor
Western —it's just Russia. The me
dia often portrays Russia as a dark
place, devoid of human rights and
ravaged by revolution. While Rus
sia is far from a Western liberal
democracy, this doesn't mean it is
innately depressing or that it has
nothing to offer.
There is so much more to Russia
than its corrupt government and
failed social reforms. Negative
stereotypes exist for a reason, but
they don't come close to telling the
whole story about an incredibly
complex and multilayered country.
I recently sat down with an ex
pat who has been living in Moscow
for almost two years, and she
shared with me what I think is a
spot-on analogy. She said that

Americans are like mangos - it's
easy to get past the peel to the juicy
fruit and talk to them about all of
their opinions and experiences, but
at a certain point you hit the pit, as
many Americans seem to exhibit a
lack of curiosity for truly under
standing other countries. Russians
are like coconuts. The shell is im
possible to break, but, once you
break it, they have an unimaginable
amount to offer.
On a daily basis during our
study abroad, we see nothing but
the shell of Muscovites. We see
them as they ride up the escalator
out of the metro station or smoke
their cigarettes on the side of the
road. Does the average Muscovite
look happy? I would say no. But
send a foreigner to New York City,
and I wouldn't be surprised if they
came back with a similar story.
In Moscow, we study at the
Russian Presidential Academy of
National Economy and Public Ad
ministration. But we don't really
study there. All of our classes but

one are only for Stanford students.
We pass Russian students in the
hallways, make small talk with
them occasionally, but we aren't in
tegrated. We don't know them well
enough to make sweeping state
ments about the political and social
directions that their generation will
take this country, a country that we
are guests in for only twelve weeks.
Clearly, Russian students are
aware of the political situation in
their country, and not every stu
dent has the desire to be the Russ
ian John Adams. But that doesn't
mean that they are all politically
apathetic. Time and time again I
have heard about students at uni

versifies around Moscow who have
a desire for change. It's only a mat
ter of time until the shell of the co
conut breaks.
A study abroad is an exercise in
contrast between what you know
and what you didn't realize you did
n't know. Every night, I drink tea
with my host family for an hour,
and we just talk. I learn more in my
two-bedroom Soviet apartment
than in any class. Tea in Russia is a
ritual, and, if you think about it,
that's pretty amazing.
While Russia is a few years be
hind in technological advance
ments, smart phones are becoming
abundant, and people are becoming
more connected with a variety of
social networking sites. Regard
less, they still find time for their
tea, for their daily face-to-face con
tact. In that way, they are far ahead
of the West, because they put a
tremendous value on personal con
tact. It's something I love about
Russia.
Studying abroad in Moscow has
not been easy, and something hap
pens every day that disappoints me
a little bit about Russia. But, every
day, something also always happens
to make me smile. It is no secret
that Russia is fraught with corrup
tion and has a long way to go to be
come a "modern" nation.
This is a country that, with its
natural resources, its people, its lo
cation and its sheer amount of
space, can become a global political
and social powerhouse. It just may
not get there by conventional
means, and it probably won't be a
transition in the manner of the
West. Tomorrow, the skies will not
part, and Russia will not lift itself
out of its general social and political
backwardness. But it might happen
sooner than you think.

have this to say: Russia can
be a depressing place, but much
more so if you fail to look past the
political flaws, lack of social mobili
ty, and general gloominess.
Moscow is neither Eastern nor
Western —it's just Russia. The me
dia often portrays Russia as a dark
place, devoid of human rights and
ravaged by revolution. While Rus
sia is far from a Western liberal
democracy, this doesn't mean it is
innately depressing or that it has
nothing to offer.
There is so much more to Russia
than its corrupt government and
failed social reforms. Negative
stereotypes exist for a reason, but
they don't come close to telling the
whole story about an incredibly
complex and multilayered country.
I recently sat down with an ex
pat who has been living in Moscow
for almost two years, and she
shared with me what I think is a
spot-on analogy. She said that

Americans are like mangos - it's
easy to get past the peel to the juicy
fruit and talk to them about all of
their opinions and experiences, but
at a certain point you hit the pit, as
many Americans seem to exhibit a
lack of curiosity for truly under
standing other countries. Russians
are like coconuts. The shell is im
possible to break, but, once you
break it, they have an unimaginable
amount to offer.
On a daily basis during our
study abroad, we see nothing but
the shell of Muscovites. We see
them as they ride up the escalator
out of the metro station or smoke
their cigarettes on the side of the
road. Does the average Muscovite
look happy? I would say no. But
send a foreigner to New York City,
and I wouldn't be surprised if they
came back with a similar story.
In Moscow, we study at the
Russian Presidential Academy of
National Economy and Public Ad
ministration. But we don't really
study there. All of our classes but

one are only for Stanford students.
We pass Russian students in the
hallways, make small talk with
them occasionally, but we aren't in
tegrated. We don't know them well
enough to make sweeping state
ments about the political and social
directions that their generation will
take this country, a country that we
are guests in for only twelve weeks.
Clearly, Russian students are
aware of the political situation in
their country, and not every stu
dent has the desire to be the Russ
ian John Adams. But that doesn't
mean that they are all politically
apathetic. Time and time again I
have heard about students at uni

versifies around Moscow who have
a desire for change. It's only a mat
ter of time until the shell of the co
conut breaks.
A study abroad is an exercise in
contrast between what you know
and what you didn't realize you did
n't know. Every night, I drink tea
with my host family for an hour,
and we just talk. I learn more in my
two-bedroom Soviet apartment
than in any class. Tea in Russia is a
ritual, and, if you think about it,
that's pretty amazing.
While Russia is a few years be
hind in technological advance
ments, smart phones are becoming
abundant, and people are becoming
more connected with a variety of
social networking sites. Regard
less, they still find time for their
tea, for their daily face-to-face con
tact. In that way, they are far ahead
of the West, because they put a
tremendous value on personal con
tact. It's something I love about
Russia.
Studying abroad in Moscow has
not been easy, and something hap
pens every day that disappoints me
a little bit about Russia. But, every
day, something also always happens
to make me smile. It is no secret
that Russia is fraught with corrup
tion and has a long way to go to be
come a "modern" nation.
This is a country that, with its
natural resources, its people, its lo
cation and its sheer amount of
space, can become a global political
and social powerhouse. It just may
not get there by conventional
means, and it probably won't be a
transition in the manner of the
West. Tomorrow, the skies will not
part, and Russia will not lift itself
out of its general social and political
backwardness. But it might happen
sooner than you think.
