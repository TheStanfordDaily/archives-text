# HIGH-STAKES DERBY
## CARDINAL SEEKS AT-LARGE NCAA BERTH 
### DYLAN FUGEL 
The Bay Area Derby will come to
town this Wednesday night at Cagan
Stadium and luckily for spectators, both
sides will have a lot to play for. Stanford
(8-6-3, 2-5-2 Pac-12) will welcome the
No. 4 California Golden Bears (12-3-2,6-
2-1 Pac-12) to its home turf and will look
to grab a result that will secure its place
in the NCAA tournament.
As of now, the Cardinal is the very
definition of a bubble team, with its
strong nonconference record of 6-1-1
being mitigated by a tough season in the
stacked Pac-12 conference. Although
Cardinal supporters will point out that
all of Stanford's losses this year have
come to teams that were ranked in the
top five of the NSCAA Coaches Poll at
the time, it would still shore up Stan
ford's resume if it can come away with
the three points against Cal. The Bears
will be looking to complete a season
sweep of the Cardinal after defeating
Stanford 1-0 in Berkeley on a hotly dis
puted penalty.
That is not to say that Cal has noth
ing to play for. Cal will be looking to se
cure the Pac-12 title for the first time
since 2010 but does not control its own
destiny after a loss to No. 2 Washington
on Sunday. With a win over Stanford,
Cal would move to a total of 22 Pac-12
points, which would force Washington to
top Oregon State on Saturday to secure
the title.
Among the danger men for Cal are
senior centerback Steve Birnbaum, who
leads the team with nine goals, and sen
ior midfielder Alec Sundly, who has five
goals, three of which were of the game
winning variety. However, Cal's founda
tion is based upon its solid defense, which
has conceded only 0.83 goals per game
thanks to the sterling work of Birnbaum,
junior centerback Christian Dean and
junior goalkeeper Justin Taillole.
The Golden Bears will have to con
tend with the dangerous talents of the
Cardinal's attack, paced by junior Zach
Batteer and freshman Jordan Morris,
who have combined for 13 goals and
nine assists. Stanford's sophomore mid
fielders Ty Thompson and Aaron Kovar
each have four assists on the year and
will be looking to play those dangerous
through balls that can break down Cal's
often obdurate defense.
Usually, it would be enough just to
make mention of the fact that this is a
game between Cal and Stanford. How
ever, considering the stakes that are in
play and the talent level on both sides, a

fantastic game can be expected on
Wednesday night, which also happens to
be Stanford's Senior Night, in which the
Cardinal's seniors playing in their final
home game will be honored.

The match is scheduled to start at 7
p.m. at Cagan Stadium.
