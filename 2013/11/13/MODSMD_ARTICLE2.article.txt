# Network security amped up
## IT Services introduces new measures, two-step authentication criticized 
### IRENE HSU 
Stanford IT Services is currently
working on several new online secu
rity measures, partially in response
to this past summer's cyber attack
on Stanford information systems in
frastructure. This comes after its
current security upgrade, two-step
authentication, drew some student
discontent for being too inconven
ient.
The new measures include re
structuring the internal system to
implement a fault-tolerant architec
ture, application whitelisting
which keeps track of applications al
lowed to run on a server to prevent
installation of rogue applications
and penetration testing which
identifies vulnerabilities in websites
and servers that could be exploited
by hackers, according to Randy Liv
ingston '75 MBA '79, vice president
for business affairs and chief finan
cial officer.
IT Services has also been in
creasing the amount of logging and
monitoring with the goal of identify
ing hacking episodes earlier and stop
hackers before they intrude into fur

ther layers of the network.
Livingston cites updating the
older operating systems and securi
ty patches on devices as one of the
more challenging updates thus far.
Older operating systems are not
only more vulnerable, but they also
cannot make use of security patches
and upgrades that could delay or
prevent cyber attacks. For instance,
computers running on Microsoft's
Windows XP will no longer be
patched after April 2014.
Feedback on two-step authentica
tion
In the meantime, complaints
about the two-step authentication
system have been submitted to
HelpSU, some about the need to car
ry around a cellphone, smartphone
or list, Livingston said.
The two-step authentication sys
tem, which has been mandated for
over a month, requires users to en
ter a unique authentication code at
least once every 28 days when log
ging into sites that require higher
levels of securities. Users can re
ceive the authentication codes
through printed lists, authenticator

applications or text messaging.
Some students have found trouble
using the authentication codes.

Ashwin Sreenivas 'l7 receives
the codes through text message and
said that though two-step authenti
cation is necessary, the process is
"really annoying and inefficient."
"The one place we never get cell
phone reception is the computer
cluster," Sreenivas said.

As a result, he must enter the
cluster to send the code, leave to re
ceive the code and return to log in, a
process he goes through every week.
Though it hasn't severely dis
couraged him from using Stanford
websites, Sreenivas said that if there
were a petition to change two-step
authentication, he would sign it.
Elizabeth Sigalla 'l5 used a print
ed list but switched to using an au

thenticator application after forget
ting to bring the list with her multi
ple times.
She lives in Tanzania and goes
home during long breaks, prevent
ing her from using the text-message
system. She also doesn't have a
printer at home and would not be
able to print out the list of codes
