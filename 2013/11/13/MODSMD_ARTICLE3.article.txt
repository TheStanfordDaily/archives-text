### ELIZABETH DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Co-founders of Instagram, Kevin
Systrom 'O6 and Mike Krieger 'OB
M.S. 'O9, discussed how life at Stan
ford prepared them for entrepre
neurship and their work at Insta
gram to an audience of 250 at CE
MEX Auditorium Thesday evening.
The event was co-sponsored by
Facebook and Jay Borenstein '93
M.S. '94, lecturer of CS2IO: Soft
ware Project Experience with Cor
porate Partners.
Systrom and Krieger began the
night's question-and-answer session
by discussing their academic experi
ences at Stanford.
"The moment I got here, I heard

about this thing called Symbolic
Systems (SymSys) and realized that
it was a really good mix of comput
ers and design and cognitive sci
ence," Krieger said. "So I ended up
doing SymSys, took basically every
human-interaction class designed
here, then I stayed on for Mayfield
Fellows."
It was through Stanford's May
field Fellows program that Krieger
met Systrom, a Management Sci
ence and Engineering major. The
two came together after going
through the entrepreneurship-fo

cused program and wanted to start
a company.
Krieger noticed through his
work on a check-in app that people
enjoyed sharing photos. The idea for
Instagram's illustrious filters gener
ated from Systrom's vacation in
Mexico during which his girlfriend
suggested including filters to allow
user's photos to look as unique as
those taken by professional photog
raphers.
The two entrepreneurs com
bined their ideas and began to work
on a photo-sharing application,

which they later founded as Insta
gram.
Since then, Instagram has grown
into an application that has over 100
million users and about 16 billion
photos across two mobile application
platforms. Facebook acquired Insta
gram in 2012 for $1 billion.
When asked about hindsight ad
vice for Stanford students, Systrom
said that people matter more than
academics.
"People are the connections that
