## Book club takes 'another look' at obscure works 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Formed last year, the Another Look
book club is already drawing members
from outside the Stanford community with
its discussion of obscure works of litera
ture.
Directed by English professor Tobias
Wolff MA '7B, the club seeks to recreate
the excitement of reading that many feel at
a young age for works that are less recog
nized.
"There's so much great work out there
that inevitably, some of it falls under a kind
of shadow of obscurity even though it
should be in the light," Wolff said. "Part of
our mission is to bring these kinds of works
into light again. Put people's attention on
them and encourage conversation about
them."
Another Look has been a fulfilling expe
rience for Cynthia Haven, a visiting scholar
at the Division of Literatures, Cultures and
Languages, who said the mailing list for
Another Look has grown to more than 600
people in the past year.
