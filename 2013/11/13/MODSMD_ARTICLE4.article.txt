## Book club takes 'another look' at obscure works 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Formed last year, the Another Look
book club is already drawing members
from outside the Stanford community with
its discussion of obscure works of litera
ture.
Directed by English professor Tobias
Wolff MA '7B, the club seeks to recreate
the excitement of reading that many feel at
a young age for works that are less recog
nized.
"There's so much great work out there
that inevitably, some of it falls under a kind
of shadow of obscurity even though it
should be in the light," Wolff said. "Part of
our mission is to bring these kinds of works
into light again. Put people's attention on
them and encourage conversation about
them."
Another Look has been a fulfilling expe
rience for Cynthia Haven, a visiting scholar
at the Division of Literatures, Cultures and
Languages, who said the mailing list for
Another Look has grown to more than 600
people in the past year.

Tobias Wolff M.A. '78, a professor of English, speaks at an Another Look event on Oct. 29. The
club, which was founded last year, seeks to generate discussion on obscure works of literature.
"When we started Another
Look, I knew the idea of finding
short, overlooked books would be a
powerful one," Haven said. "What I
didn't expect is how much I would
personally gain from the series."
"I have had a chance to explore
short masterpieces that I may not
have read on my own and I have al
so had a chance to discuss them
with cutting-edge writers and
scholars," she added.
One of the writers who has
served as a panelist is Yendela Vida,
a Bay Area novelist, journalist and
editor.
In the past year, the club has put
on four events, one per quarter. The
works discussed so far have been
"So Long, See You Tomorrow" by
William Maxwell, "The Wife of

Martin Guerre" by Janet Lewis,
"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" by
Anita Loos and "My Father and
Myself," a memoir by J.R. Ackerley.
This coming winter, Wolff will be
leading a discussion on "The Ghost
Writer" by Philip Roth.
The club's discussion incorpo
rates both panelist's opinions and
audience participation.
"It's like a good dinner-table
conversation among really smart
people who have all read the same
book," Wolff said. "Then they open
it up to the audience who can then
pitch in and join the conversation."
Another Look has been drawing
participants from outside the Stan
ford community including Bryndie
Beach, landscape planner and ar
chitect in Carmel, Calif., and moth
er of a Stanford student, who
makes the drive to Stanford for the
book club's quarterly meetings.
"It's worth it to me to make that
drive up to the book forum," Beach
said. "I think that one of the things

that intrigued me the most was this
idea that Tobias Wolff talked about
when the group first started: there
were all of these wonderful pieces
of literature that are just over
looked or forgotten."
Another Look is open to the en
tire Stanford community, including
undergraduates and graduate stu
dents.
"Part of that community cer
tainly includes Stanford students,
who offer a new generation of per
spectives to these overlooked clas
sics," Wolff said. "We publicize the
event heavily on campus, and hope
to reach out in more ways in the fu
ture to ensure a strong student
presence at events."
Elena Danielson M.A. '7O Ph.D.
'75, former director of the Hoover
Archives, said she first read about
the Another Look book club on
Haven's blog.
"These were real Stanford fac
ulty sitting in front of real people in
an audience that would respond to

your comments and answer your
questions," she said.
The club has proven to be a
learning experience for Danielson.
"["So Long, See You Tomor
row"] was so enjoyable and
Maxwell had a great writing style,
but I had missed the whole point,"
she said. "One of the characters
was totally imaginary. If I hadn't
gone to the book club, I would have
never learned that."
Now, Danielson has pioneered
the discussion of "So Long, See You
Tomorrow" with her personal book
club.
"This friend said that she loved
the book and without my explana
tion, she wouldn't have gotten that
the character was imaginary ei
ther," she said. "My explanation
came from the Stanford faculty,
from people like Toby Wolff, who
brought out the meaning for me."
