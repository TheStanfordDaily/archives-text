# STUDENT GROUPS
## she++ to launch new fellowship Summit to promote tech skills among high schoolers 
### MADELEINE HAN 
Next April, 30 high school stu
dents from across the nation who are
aspiring to enter the technology field
will come to Stanford for the first
she++ #include summit.
The summit is part of a new fel
lowship initiative under she++, a
Stanford-based organization that
aims to deconstruct gender stereo
types surrounding the tech industry
and provide equal opportunities for
involvement in computer science.
Although she++ focuses on pro
moting women in tech, applications
for the #include summit are open to
all high school students.
"We want all sorts of people to fall
in love with technology and computer
science and feel comfortable in that
space," said Rachel Mellon'l6, co-di
rector of the new program.
The fellowship consists of an edu
cational program and summit to en
courage high school students to raise
awareness about tech in their com
munities.
"The main goal of the #include
fellowship is to encourage students
who might not otherwise be exposed
to computer science or other tech
fields," Mellon said.
"#include is a directive used in C
and C+ + when you want to include a
library," Mellon said. "The name
comes from the idea that we want to
make tech be a safe space."
Students who sign up online by
Dec. 11 will receive a Launch Kit
with fellowship materials about how
to initiate conversations about tech.
Those accepted to the program get
an all-expenses paid trip to the #in
clude summit.
Each student will also be as
signed a college mentor (a separate
application process in itself) to help
implement tech-related projects in
the participants' communities.
Methods of raising awareness for
students range from starting a robot
ics club to implementing plans to add
a computer science class to their high
school curriculum.
"High schoolers might not have
as much experience as college stu
dents," said Lucy Wang'l6, co-direc
tor of the #include fellowship. "This
will be an immersive learning experi
ence for them."
Participants are chosen based on
community involvement and a sub
mitted tech sample. Once accepted
into the program, they will tour tech
companies like Facebook, listen to
speakers working in tech and take
classes taught by industry profes
sionals.
#include adds to past she+ + ini
tiatives, which include an annual on
campus tech conference for college
students and a documentary about
women in tech.
"I think computer science is miss
ing from the high school curricu
lum," Wang said. "Many students
will consider subjects taught in their
high schools like economics or engi
neering.

"Not a lot of high schools offer
computer science, so students won't
consider it until they get to high
school, or they may never consider
it," she added.
Nathalia Scrimshaw 'l7, director
of operations for the #include Fel
lowship, spoke about the importance
of keeping conversations about tech
in the participants' communities
alive.
"If one student does something to
help empower students interested in
computer science at their school,
then other students will hopefully
get excited and it will create a chain
effect," Scrimshaw said.
Mellon elaborated on the viability
of #include's community impact
goals.
"That fact that something like
the summit can exist is proof that
tech companies really want to see
more people excited about this
space," Mellon said. "There is a com
munity waiting for students, encour
aging them to explore and not give
up."
