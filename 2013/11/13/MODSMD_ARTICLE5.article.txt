# STUDENT GROUPS
## she++ to launch new fellowship Summit to promote tech skills among high schoolers 
### MADELEINE HAN 
Next April, 30 high school stu
dents from across the nation who are
aspiring to enter the technology field
will come to Stanford for the first
she++ #include summit.
The summit is part of a new fel
lowship initiative under she++, a
Stanford-based organization that
aims to deconstruct gender stereo
types surrounding the tech industry
and provide equal opportunities for
involvement in computer science.
Although she++ focuses on pro
moting women in tech, applications
for the #include summit are open to
all high school students.
"We want all sorts of people to fall
in love with technology and computer
science and feel comfortable in that
space," said Rachel Mellon'l6, co-di
rector of the new program.
The fellowship consists of an edu
cational program and summit to en
courage high school students to raise
awareness about tech in their com
munities.
"The main goal of the #include
fellowship is to encourage students
who might not otherwise be exposed
to computer science or other tech
fields," Mellon said.
"#include is a directive used in C
and C+ + when you want to include a
library," Mellon said. "The name
comes from the idea that we want to
make tech be a safe space."
Students who sign up online by
Dec. 11 will receive a Launch Kit
with fellowship materials about how
to initiate conversations about tech.
Those accepted to the program get
an all-expenses paid trip to the #in
clude summit.
Each student will also be as
signed a college mentor (a separate
application process in itself) to help
implement tech-related projects in
the participants' communities.
Methods of raising awareness for
students range from starting a robot
ics club to implementing plans to add
a computer science class to their high
school curriculum.
