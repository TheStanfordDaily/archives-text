## Senate seeks more upperclassmen in body 
### ANDREW VOGELEY 
The 15th Undergraduate Senate
debated how to best implement a
constitutional amendment, passed
last election, that mandates top-vot
ed upperdassmen candidates to be
automatically elected to the Senate,
no matter their finish among the
rest of the candidate pool.
The amendment, which passed
with strong student support, also
gives the Senate the power to deter
mine the number of upperdassmen
candidates elected under this provi
sion.
While there was no bill up for
discussion pertaining to this issue,
Senator John-Lancaster Finley'l6
noted that the Administration and
Rules Committee had preliminary
discussions in their previous meet
ings.
"I think it is important [to get up
perdassmen to run]," Senate Chair
Ben Holston 'l5 said. "[The Under
graduate Senate] is supposed to be a
body that represents the entire stu
dent body and having 14 sopho
mores and one junior doesn't neces
sarily do that."
The Senate tossed around many
ideas as to how to best implement
the amendment, including having
the upperdassmen candidates re
ceive a minimum percentage of
votes in order to be eligible for the
Senate election.
Several senators noted that it
could be difficult to recruit upper
classmen to run, citing the Senate's
restriction on travelling abroad and

lack of course credit available.
Holston said the Senate hopes to
have a bill passed that deals with the
constitutional amendment by the
end of January at the latest.
In addition to the debate about
the amendment, Senator Ilya
Mouzykantskii'l6 reported on the
establishment of his new project,
the Stanford Connections Program
that uses money recently allocated
to senators by the newly created
Senate Innovation Fund.
Mouzykantskii did not clarify what
the project's goals would be.
"I want to incentivize and en
courage students to spend time

improving the lives of people
around them," Mouzykantskii said.
"I want to optimize how students
connect on campus."
Senator Hisham Al-Falih 'l6 also
followed up on the plans he outlined
last week for a new peer-mentoring
program.
"We don't want to overstep any
current student groups' efforts ... so
we are trying to see if there are any
relevant student groups that are do
ing things very similar to this and
try to collaborate with them," Falih
said.

While the initial plan for the
peer-mentoring program empha-

sized minority students as the main
recipients of this mentoring, Falih
has decided to potentially expand
the program.
"We are not only going to try to
make this community based, but al
so major based, dorm based, ethnic
ity based so it is going to be a lot of
diversity within the program," Falih
said.
The Senate also passed a bill
amending its internal rules of order,
in addition to $21,922.65 of funding
bills.
