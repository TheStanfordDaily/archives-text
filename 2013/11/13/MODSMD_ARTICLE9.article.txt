## One-and-done rule is no good 
### Viggy Venkataraman 
Last night was one for the
ages in men's college bas
ketball. No. 1 Kentucky
squared off against No. 2
Michigan State, the earli
est one-versus-two pairing in the his
tory of college basketball, while
fourth-ranked Duke played fifth
ranked Kansas. Fans like me salivat
ed over the matchup that served as
the big-stage unveiling of the much
hyped Jabari Parker. My ears are still
ringing with the melodious sound of
Dick Vitale's raspy voice. For many,
this would have been a fine showcase
of the game of men's college basket
ball being played at its highest level.
For me, however, it served as an
indication of how drastically the col
lege basketball landscape changes
from year to year. Despite having fol
lowed the sport pretty closely until
Louisville triumphed over Michigan
in last season's national championship
game, I have to admit that I couldn't
recognize more than three quarters
of the players on the floor at any giv
en moment in last night's proceed
ings. The culprit? The infamous "one
and-done" rule, which allows (or re
quires, depending on your mood)
players to jump to the NB A after one
year of play at the collegiate level.
Now, before I go any further, I
want to be very clear that this column
is not an opinion piece on the relative
benefits and drawbacks of going to
college versus jumping into profes
sional sports. That argument, having
already spawned reams and reams of
literature, is not going to be conclu
sively resolved one way or another in
our lifetimes. However, regardless of
your views on the subject, if one looks
at the situation objectively, there is no
debate: The one-and-done rule stinks.
I am all for compromise, but in
this case, the agreed-upon compro
mise between the NCAA and the
NBA somehow manages to be the
perfect compromise by the letter of
the law that manages to wreck the
spirit of the law in every possible
way. If you are a proponent of play
ers getting a good education before
making the leap, then good for you!
That is a very noble position to take.
But just how much is a player going
to get out of one abbreviated year of
a college education? Bearing in mind
that athletes have absurd practice
and game schedules that eat into
their student lives, it just seems farci
cal to assume that one year of educa
tion is enough to provide even hp
service to the "education" that propo
nents of the rule tout.
On the flip side, if you support ath
letes' rights to make their own deci
sions without being drowned in a sea
of red tape and NCAA regulations,
how exactly is the one-and-done rule
fair to you? The MLB has no such
rule in its encyclopedically large
rulebook; players can be drafted
straight out of high school, from
abroad, after college, after three
years of college and pretty much any
time after they are legally allowed to
work for a living.
The NFL, on the other hand, has
a three-year rule, in which a player
must be out of high school for three
years before being eligible in the
draft. Many athletes are cognizant of
the fact that they will be using their
prodigious athletic talents to make
their way in the world from a very
young age; as such, is it fair to bind
them into a collegiate contract of
sorts, forcing them to go to school
when they could be making money
and supporting their families in the
big leagues?
Proponents of the rule argue that
some education is better than none,
and that the time players spend in
college under their coaches only helps
develop their game. My counter is
that in education, you only get out
what you put in, and if a player knows
fully well that he is leaving for the
NBA and will be drafted highly, what
exactly is his incentive to put any ef
fort into school?
If you just let players do what
they want, a state of equilibrium will
be reached. Those players who desire
the college basketball experience will
jump into it, those who are either tal
ented enough or desired enough will
go to the NBA and, hopefully, there
will be fewer players declaring for the
draft and regretting their decisions
later on. As an added bonus, the con
tinuity of college basketball will im
prove tenfold. There will be fewer in
stances of a full roster rebuild after a

summer of graduation and
NBA attrition.
The NCAA prides itself on
(supposedly) being a bastion
of both education and athlet
ics, but in the case of men's
college basketball this is ab
solutely not true. Both educa
tion and athletics suffer as a
result of the one-and-done
rule, and as such, it should be
torpedoed.
My suggestion? Let play

ers do what they want. It is al
ways a bad idea to try to force
young folk to do what you
want them to do. Let them
make their own decisions and
live by the consequences that
follow.

ford to become a professional
mridangam player, but he

ence of working at The Daily

Last night was one for the
ages in men's college bas
ketball. No. 1 Kentucky
squared off against No. 2
Michigan State, the earli
est one-versus-two pairing in the his
tory of college basketball, while
fourth-ranked Duke played fifth
ranked Kansas. Fans like me salivat
ed over the matchup that served as
the big-stage unveiling of the much
hyped Jabari Parker. My ears are still
ringing with the melodious sound of
Dick Vitale's raspy voice. For many,
this would have been a fine showcase
of the game of men's college basket
ball being played at its highest level.
For me, however, it served as an
indication of how drastically the col
lege basketball landscape changes
from year to year. Despite having fol
lowed the sport pretty closely until
Louisville triumphed over Michigan
in last season's national championship
game, I have to admit that I couldn't
recognize more than three quarters
of the players on the floor at any giv
en moment in last night's proceed
ings. The culprit? The infamous "one
and-done" rule, which allows (or re
quires, depending on your mood)
players to jump to the NB A after one
year of play at the collegiate level.
Now, before I go any further, I
want to be very clear that this column
is not an opinion piece on the relative
benefits and drawbacks of going to
college versus jumping into profes
sional sports. That argument, having
already spawned reams and reams of
literature, is not going to be conclu
sively resolved one way or another in
our lifetimes. However, regardless of
your views on the subject, if one looks
at the situation objectively, there is no
debate: The one-and-done rule stinks.
I am all for compromise, but in
this case, the agreed-upon compro
mise between the NCAA and the
NBA somehow manages to be the
perfect compromise by the letter of
the law that manages to wreck the
spirit of the law in every possible
way. If you are a proponent of play
ers getting a good education before
making the leap, then good for you!
That is a very noble position to take.
But just how much is a player going
to get out of one abbreviated year of
a college education? Bearing in mind
that athletes have absurd practice
and game schedules that eat into
their student lives, it just seems farci
cal to assume that one year of educa
tion is enough to provide even hp
service to the "education" that propo
nents of the rule tout.
On the flip side, if you support ath
letes' rights to make their own deci
sions without being drowned in a sea
of red tape and NCAA regulations,
how exactly is the one-and-done rule
fair to you? The MLB has no such
rule in its encyclopedically large
rulebook; players can be drafted
straight out of high school, from
abroad, after college, after three
years of college and pretty much any
time after they are legally allowed to
work for a living.
The NFL, on the other hand, has
a three-year rule, in which a player
must be out of high school for three
years before being eligible in the
draft. Many athletes are cognizant of
the fact that they will be using their
prodigious athletic talents to make
their way in the world from a very
young age; as such, is it fair to bind
them into a collegiate contract of
sorts, forcing them to go to school
when they could be making money
and supporting their families in the
big leagues?
Proponents of the rule argue that
some education is better than none,
and that the time players spend in
college under their coaches only helps
develop their game. My counter is
that in education, you only get out
what you put in, and if a player knows
fully well that he is leaving for the
NBA and will be drafted highly, what
exactly is his incentive to put any ef
fort into school?
If you just let players do what
they want, a state of equilibrium will
be reached. Those players who desire
the college basketball experience will
jump into it, those who are either tal
ented enough or desired enough will
go to the NBA and, hopefully, there
will be fewer players declaring for the
draft and regretting their decisions
later on. As an added bonus, the con
tinuity of college basketball will im
prove tenfold. There will be fewer in
stances of a full roster rebuild after a

summer of graduation and
NBA attrition.
The NCAA prides itself on
(supposedly) being a bastion
of both education and athlet
ics, but in the case of men's
college basketball this is ab
solutely not true. Both educa
tion and athletics suffer as a
result of the one-and-done
rule, and as such, it should be
torpedoed.
My suggestion? Let play

ers do what they want. It is al
ways a bad idea to try to force
young folk to do what you
want them to do. Let them
make their own decisions and
live by the consequences that
follow.
