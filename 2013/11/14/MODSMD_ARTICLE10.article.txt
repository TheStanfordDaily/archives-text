# ROLES REVERSED
## STANFORD WITH MORE AT STAKE THAN USC THIS TIME AROUND 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Last year, USC waltzed into
Stanford Stadium as the favored
team with national championship
hopes and a top-five ranking. This
year, the roles have been re
versed, as Stanford travels to the
Coliseum as the favorite with a
top-five ranking and rekindled
national championship dreams.

In order to avoid suffering the
same fate as the Trojans did last
year, Stanford enters recognizing
that the rest of the nation es
pecially USC, given the results of
the last four years is out to get
them.
"We just try and go into it with
a target on our back, knowing
that teams are gunning for us,"
said sophomore offensive lineman
Johnny Caspers. "It's USC this
week so we definitely need to
keep our guard up because it's a
huge game."
Caspers is a part of an offen
sive line coming off of one of its

most dominant performances in
recent memory, pounding Oregon
on the line of scrimmage all night
long. The Cardinal finished with
274 rushing yards on an astound
ing 66 carries, including a school
record 45 carries from senior run
ning back Tyler Gaffney.
"It's pretty exciting," shared
Caspers about running the ball as
often as Stanford did. "Just get
ting to beat up other teams; it's a
lot of fun. You start seeing teams
wear down so it's pretty cool."
USC enters the contest with a
top-20 rushing defense nation
wide that ranks second best in the
Pac-12 behind Stanford. On aver
age, the Trojans only surrender
113.5 yards per game on the
ground. However, Oregon's de
fense was similarly hyped before
being bulldozed at the line of
scrimmage by Stanford.
"I think we need to keep doing
what we're doing and definitely
finish the game off," Caspers said.
"Get our blocks, sustain our
blocks, strain against those guys,
