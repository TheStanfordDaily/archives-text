# ROLES REVERSED
## STANFORD WITH MORE AT STAKE THAN USC THIS TIME AROUND 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Last year, USC waltzed into
Stanford Stadium as the favored
team with national championship
hopes and a top-five ranking. This
year, the roles have been re
versed, as Stanford travels to the
Coliseum as the favorite with a
top-five ranking and rekindled
national championship dreams.

In order to avoid suffering the
same fate as the Trojans did last
year, Stanford enters recognizing
that the rest of the nation es
pecially USC, given the results of
the last four years is out to get
them.
"We just try and go into it with
a target on our back, knowing
that teams are gunning for us,"
said sophomore offensive lineman
Johnny Caspers. "It's USC this
week so we definitely need to
keep our guard up because it's a
huge game."
Caspers is a part of an offen
sive line coming off of one of its

most dominant performances in
recent memory, pounding Oregon
on the line of scrimmage all night
long. The Cardinal finished with
274 rushing yards on an astound
ing 66 carries, including a school
record 45 carries from senior run
ning back Tyler Gaffney.
"It's pretty exciting," shared
Caspers about running the ball as
often as Stanford did. "Just get
ting to beat up other teams; it's a
lot of fun. You start seeing teams
wear down so it's pretty cool."
USC enters the contest with a
top-20 rushing defense nation
wide that ranks second best in the
Pac-12 behind Stanford. On aver
age, the Trojans only surrender
113.5 yards per game on the
ground. However, Oregon's de
fense was similarly hyped before
being bulldozed at the line of
scrimmage by Stanford.
"I think we need to keep doing
what we're doing and definitely
finish the game off," Caspers said.
"Get our blocks, sustain our
blocks, strain against those guys,

because they're great ath
letes just really punish
them on the offensive line."
Stanford showed an abili
ty to consistently gain
yardage on the ground
against the Ducks, even in
tough third-down situations.
The Cardinal finished 14 for
21 on third-down thanks in
large part to an offensive
line that moved the Ducks
defensive line yards back on
each and every play. Nine of
the 12 plays on Stanford's
first quarter touchdown
drive were runs, including
three third-down conver
sions on the ground, and sev
en of the eight plays on Stan
ford's second quarter touch
down drive were runs as
well. The Cardinal also
moved the chains on third or
fourth down by running the
ball a remarkable 13 times
on the night (nine times with
1-3 yards to go and four
times with 4 yards or
greater to go).
"When we get into the
right situation, when we have
the right play, when we have
the right calls going, when
we're communicating, that's
when I think we're at our
best," Caspers elaborated.
Stanford hopes to receive
an offensive boost against
the Trojans as junior wide
receiver Devon Cajuste
stands to return to normal
action after dealing with a
knee injury the past several
weeks and playing only lim
ited time against the Ducks.
"[He's doing] much bet
ter this week," said head

coach David Shaw regard
ing Cajuste. "[He] just
looks more comfortable,
more fluid. Earlier in the
week he practiced for half
the practice, [Tuesday] he
went the whole practice with
no issues."
The Cardinal is sure to
face a raucous crowd as the
Trojans ride a three-game
winning streak into Satur
day night's contest, hoping
to reestablish themselves as
a national power in front of
ESPN's College Game Day
and a national television au
dience. In order to prepare
for the hostile environment,
Shaw has adopted his usual
strategy of playing the USC
fight song during practice.
"We're trying to get to
the point where we [hear] it
so much that we get used it,"
Shaw said. "They play it
more than anybody... When
we play at Oregon we play
their fight songs and crowd
noise as well. So when we
play USC we play their fight
song over and over and

Stanford faces off against
USC Saturday night at 5
p.m. in the Coliseum.
