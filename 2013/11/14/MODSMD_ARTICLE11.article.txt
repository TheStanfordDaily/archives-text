## HONING IN ON HOME OPENER 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 3 Stanford women's basketball (1-1) re
turns to the Farm this week after a two-game
road trip to the East Coast last weekend.
After taking care of business at Boston Col
lege on Saturday, the Card was tripped up by No.
1 Connecticut on Monday, losing 76-57. The early
season game was meant to be a starting point in
gauging the team's potential and areas of growth
for head coach Tara VanDerveer. With multiple
upperclassmen coming back from preseason in
juries and a bevy of new players on the court this
year, taking on Connecticut so early in the season
was a test for the Cardinal women and despite

the double-digit loss the team learned a lot to go
forward with.
"I think this [Connecticut loss] kind of let our
team know we're 20 points away," VanDerveer
said. "How do you make that up? We gave up too
many [offensive rebounds] for baskets. We sent
them to the free-throw line for no reason. We
need to do little things correctly and focus on that
for the rest of the season."
The biggest lesson to be taken away is that
Stanford â€”just like last year cannot rely on
only two players to produce the majority of its
scoring. In the loss, junior point guard Amber Or
range tied her career high in scoring with 22
points, and senior forward Chiney Ogwumike
had 16 points and 13 rebounds a modest dou

ble-double for the national player of the year can
didate.
Although all 13 available players on the roster
saw court action, no other Cardinal player scored
in double digits or asserted herself offensively
an eerily familial* issue that the Card suffered
from last season.
Stanford will try to make adjustments for its
upcoming games this weekend in hopes of get
ting more players to score and grabbing offen
sive boards and being more aggressive under
the basket.
The Card will first take on Cal Poly in its reg
ular-season home opener this Friday. In Cal Poly's
opening two losses, senior
Jonae Irvin averaged 21
points, four rebounds and four
steals. In addition, Molly
Schlemer averaged 15 points
and 11 rebounds in the losses.
Schlemer was last year's Big
West Conference player of
the year.
On Sunday, UC-Davis will
travel to Maples Pavilion for
a second matchup in as many
years with the Card. Last
year, Stanford held the Ag
gies to just 38 points in the
game. Ogwumike tied her
then-career-high in scoring
with 27 points and grabbed
13 rebounds. Davis's leading
scorer in that game, Sydnee
Fipps (14 points), returns as
a junior this year.
The Aggies are coming off
losses to Pacific and USC.
Fipps has led the way with
16.5 points per game to go
with six rebounds per game.
She will need a lot more help
on the offensive end, howev
er, if the Aggies wish to score
more than the 38 points they
scraped together in last
year's meeting.
In other women's basket
ball news, VanDerveer an
nounced yesterday the
signing of Brittany McPhee,
Kaylee Johnson and Taylor
Rooks to National Letters of

Intent for the 2014-15 season.
"This is a very talented,
very exciting group of young
women that will be coming to
Stanford next year," Van-
Derveer said. "Brittany,
Kaylee and Taylor bring a

variety of talents as well as a
lot of energy that will fit
right into our program. I am
very pleased to have them
join the Stanford family."
The Card will return fo
cus to this season on Friday

at Maples Pavilion against
Cal Poly at 7 p.m. and Sun
day against UC-Davis at 2
p.m.
