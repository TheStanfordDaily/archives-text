## HONING IN ON HOME OPENER 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 3 Stanford women's basketball (1-1) re
turns to the Farm this week after a two-game
road trip to the East Coast last weekend.
After taking care of business at Boston Col
lege on Saturday, the Card was tripped up by No.
1 Connecticut on Monday, losing 76-57. The early
season game was meant to be a starting point in
gauging the team's potential and areas of growth
for head coach Tara VanDerveer. With multiple
upperclassmen coming back from preseason in
juries and a bevy of new players on the court this
year, taking on Connecticut so early in the season
was a test for the Cardinal women and despite

the double-digit loss the team learned a lot to go
forward with.
"I think this [Connecticut loss] kind of let our
team know we're 20 points away," VanDerveer
said. "How do you make that up? We gave up too
many [offensive rebounds] for baskets. We sent
them to the free-throw line for no reason. We
need to do little things correctly and focus on that
for the rest of the season."
The biggest lesson to be taken away is that
Stanford â€”just like last year cannot rely on
only two players to produce the majority of its
scoring. In the loss, junior point guard Amber Or
range tied her career high in scoring with 22
points, and senior forward Chiney Ogwumike
had 16 points and 13 rebounds a modest dou

ble-double for the national player of the year can
didate.
Although all 13 available players on the roster
saw court action, no other Cardinal player scored
in double digits or asserted herself offensively
an eerily familial* issue that the Card suffered
from last season.
Stanford will try to make adjustments for its
upcoming games this weekend in hopes of get
ting more players to score and grabbing offen
sive boards and being more aggressive under
the basket.
The Card will first take on Cal Poly in its reg
ular-season home opener this Friday. In Cal Poly's
