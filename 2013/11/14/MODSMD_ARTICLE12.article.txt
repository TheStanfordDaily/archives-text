# READY FOR THE TOURNEY
## Women's soccer draws CSU Fullerton 
### FIONA NOONAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Silence filled the women's locker room
at Cagan Stadium Monday afternoon as the
women's soccer team watched No. 10 Stan
ford (13-5-1, 6-5-0 Pac-12) draw a match
against CSU Fullerton (8-6-7), the Big West
tournament champions, in the first round of
the NCAA Division I postseason tourna
ment to be played Friday at home.
"It was pretty intense everyone was
super focused, no one was really talking,"
said freshman goalkeeper Jane Campbell.
"Once our name got drawn, it was just kind
of exciting to know... our game against
Fhllerton, that's all we have to focus on, and
we don't have to worry about anyone else
except ourselves."
The selection to the 64-team tourna
ment â€” Stanford's 16th in a row came
as no surprise, but it did come under a dif
ferent set of circumstances than the Cardi
nal has become used to over the past sever
al seasons. The team is entering the tourna
ment unseeded after finishing fourth in the
Pac-12 during the regular season, and Fri
day's match will almost certainly be the
team's last home game of the year.
History favors the Cardinal against the
Titans on Friday. Stanford has won its last
20 postseason home matches and holds a 1-
0 series record against Rillerton. Stanford
also beat Fbllerton in an offseason match
this spring.
A clean slate might be just what Stan
ford needs after an imperfect regular sea
son that ended with a loss to Cal in the final
match. Stalling out what the team often
refers to as its "second season" at home will
also be an advantage for this experienced
Cardinal squad.
"I think playing at home just allows us
to get into the rhythm quicker," said junior
forward Haley Rosen. "We're used to the
environment. It's our locker room, our field,
our facilities, and I think that helps a lot."
A victory Friday would mean traveling,
most likely to UCLA's stadium, for the next
round. Stanford has not played a non-Col
lege Cup road game since 2006. Right now,
though, the team is more focused on the

where they're played.
"It's different, but this
year we've done well on the
road," said senior defender
and co-captain Kendall
Romine, who was a starter on
the team when Stanford won
the national title in 2011. "It

allows us to be focused and
just oriented towards the
goal of playing soccer in the
moment."
Though the team and its
playing style will remain the
same in the postseason, the
playoffs necessitate a differ
ent, more intense mindset.
"I think it's got to be busi

more on the line," said head
coach Paul Ratcliffe. "If you
win you move on, if you don't

your season is over. So I think
everyone just puts things up a
notch and gets after it."
The winner of Friday's
game will face the winner of
the Furman-South Carolina
match in the second round.
Including the first round
match, Stanford has to win six
games to reach the goal of be
coming College Cup champi
ons.
"It's a time where you see
a lot of excitement," Romine
said. "It's a whole new arena,

and it's extremely competi
tive, and I think it brings a lot
out of everyone. I'm excited.
As a senior I want to make
this year count."
The first-round playoff
match will kick off at 7 p.m.
