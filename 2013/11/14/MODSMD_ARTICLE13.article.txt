## BELTWAY PERSPECTIVES The 						Overblown NSA 'Scandal' 
### Marshall Watkins 
Five months after Edward
Snowden came forward as the
source of extensive leaks about
National Security Agency (NSA) sig
nals intelligence programs, the
repercussions are still being felt,
both at home and abroad. The revela
tion that the NSA— apparently op
erating without direct presidential
oversight and with only the supervi
sion of a secret court system ac
cessed the personal communications
of millions of Americans and non-
Americans is certainly disconcerting.
To blindly critique such policies
as a uniquely American practice
or as a fundamental breach of inter
national decorum with long-lasting
repercussions is, however, both
naive and shortsighted.
Amidst the outcry in Europe and
elsewhere in response to the revela
tion that Angela Meckel's cellphone
had been tapped, the list of nations
that expressed no significant con
cern and voiced no substantial criti
cism is telling. Russia, China and the
United Kingdom were largely or
completely silent on the subject, in a
tacit recognition that such practices
are simply the international norm
among great or previously or as
piringly great powers.

To be caught in the act is embar
rassing, but hardly a deviation from
what could fairly be considered stan
dard practice for countries that have
the means. Even peripheral nations
like Brazil —whose president had
previously spoken out forcefully
against the NSA programs have
acknowledged conducting similar ac
tivities against diplomatic targets
from other nations.
That such surveillance is simply
the norm is reinforced by the reac
tion of policymakers. Public anger in
Europe and elsewhere has been pro
nounced, certainly, but remains
largely superficial, the result of con
trived attempts at nationalism and
equally shallow concerns about gov
ernmental impotence. Even in the
case of American relations with Ger
many, supposedly riven asunder by
Angela Meckel's anger over the in
vasion of her privacy, more impor
tant aspects of the relationship will
continue to dominate its current con
duct and future path.
Those policymakers are equally
well aware of their own role in fur
thering such programs through do
mestic intelligence agencies. Some of
the most "egregious" from a cer
tain perspective practices under
taken by the NSA, such as mass in
tercepts of foreign communications,
were actually conducted by partner
intelligence agencies who then
passed the information onto their
American counterparts. Excessive
protesting may jeopardize the future
of such mutually beneficial collabora
tion, an outcome desirable to no one.
In any case, the extent to which
the various NSA programs actually
constitute any credible breach of pri
vacy is equally overblown. While 39
percent of Americans believe that
the NSA data surveillance program
features intercepts of the content of
calls and other communications, in
fact it merely compiles minimal data
about the timing and location of calls.
That information hardly intru
sive to anyone but the most paranoid
can subsequently be used to de
velop a firmer understanding of ter
rorist and communications and net
works, but only upon meeting legally
upheld standards of reasonable sus
picion. In other words, intelligence
services are hardly running amok.
The constraints under which the
American intelligence community al
ready operates make recent moves
to impose further limitations pro
foundly concerning, however. Given
the critical nature of the threat
posed by terrorism, developing ef
fective partnerships with foreign in
telligence services and continuing to
prosecute a more aggressive cam
paign abroad makes sense. Arbitrar
ily surrendering the ability to target
foreign leaders many of them
representing nations whose inter
ests frequently clash directly with
those of the United States is a
step in the wrong direction.
There are certainly aspects of

the surveillance program that merit
further scrutiny and debate, of
course. That the Foreign Intelli
gence Surveillance Court has essen
tially usurped the role of the
Supreme Court on matters relating
to national security is a remarkable
step that has largely eluded the in
terest of the American public,
wrongly so. Overall, however, the
furor over NSA data surveillance
programs is both naive and misguid
ed, and may still yet generate a self
imposed backlash detrimental to the
United States in the long run.

the various NSA programs actually
constitute any credible breach of pri
vacy is equally overblown. While 39
percent of Americans believe that
the NSA data surveillance program
features intercepts of the content of
calls and other communications, in
fact it merely compiles minimal data
about the timing and location of calls.
That information hardly intru
sive to anyone but the most paranoid
can subsequently be used to de
velop a firmer understanding of ter
rorist and communications and net
works, but only upon meeting legally
upheld standards of reasonable sus
picion. In other words, intelligence
services are hardly running amok.
The constraints under which the
American intelligence community al
ready operates make recent moves
to impose further limitations pro
foundly concerning, however. Given
the critical nature of the threat
posed by terrorism, developing ef
fective partnerships with foreign in
telligence services and continuing to
prosecute a more aggressive cam
paign abroad makes sense. Arbitrar
ily surrendering the ability to target
foreign leaders many of them
representing nations whose inter
ests frequently clash directly with
those of the United States is a
step in the wrong direction.
There are certainly aspects of

the surveillance program that merit
further scrutiny and debate, of
course. That the Foreign Intelli
gence Surveillance Court has essen
tially usurped the role of the
Supreme Court on matters relating
to national security is a remarkable
step that has largely eluded the in
terest of the American public,
wrongly so. Overall, however, the
furor over NSA data surveillance
programs is both naive and misguid
ed, and may still yet generate a self
imposed backlash detrimental to the
United States in the long run.
