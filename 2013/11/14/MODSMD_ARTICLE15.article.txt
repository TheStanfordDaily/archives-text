# BELTWAY PERSPECTIVES
## A 						Failure of Transparency and the Perils of Ignorance 
### Nick Ahamed 
Recent allegations of National
Security Agency oversteps
have put Democrats be
tween a rock and a hard place. On
one hand, we should be upset that
the USA PATRIOT Act is being
invoked again for national securi
ty; on the other, we should stand
by President Obama as he is be
rated day after day by Republi
cans.
On the face, no one should be
too concerned about the NSA data
surveillance program. Authorized
under Section 215 Patriot Act, the
program collects metadata or,
data about data. The media has
focused on the collection of tele
phone records. These "records"
are limited to information like the
dialed number and the length of
call called Communications In
telligence (COMINT), a subset of
Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), by
our intelligence community (IC).
Thirty-nine percent of Ameri
cans, in a recent poll conducted by
the Center for International Secu
rity and Cooperation (CISAC)'s
Amy Zegart, believe that this pro
gram includes listening to the con
tent of the calls surveilled. That 39
percent are wrong. While SIGINT
can include data on location of the
dialer and other identifiable char
acteristics, the Section 215 neither
analyzes the content, or this more
personal data.
You may, then, be confused
about the purpose of this program.
What good does it do with such lim
ited information?
It simply forms a reference
database. As our IC combats terror
plots, it gives them the ability to see
which suspected terrorists are
communicating with allies inside
the United States. This database
can be seared after presenting rea
sonable suspicion that the subject is
connected to a terrorist organiza
tion.
In 2012, fewer than 300 queries
were approved.
While the vast majority of this
information is discarded, it is nev
ertheless valuable. A 2009 report
from the Director of National Intel
ligence (DNI) illustrates one exam
ple where the lack of domestic SIG

INT prior to the 9/11 attacks led us
to believe hijacker Khalid al-Mihd
nar was in Yemen. In reality, he was
living in San Diego.
This is not to say that Ameri
cans should unequivocally support
this program. Rather, it's to demon
strate a total ignorance of what our
IC really does. Laughably, Zegart's
poll shows that many Americans
relate their view of the NSA to spy
oriented movies and television
shows.
Similarly, 71 percent of Ameri
cans are okay with losing civil liber
ties to prevent terrorism, but sig
nificantly fewer people find the
NSA program acceptable.
What we need is a real discus
sion about the importance of securi
ty and liberty in this country.
Americans constantly see these at
odds. Indeed, they often (mis)quote
Ben Franklin to that end (myself in

cluded). But, it's hard to say how
liberty and security are related
when we don't know much about
the program.
So, before we can have an edu
cated discussion about security and
liberty, we need transparency.
Because of their secret nature,
many of the details will never pub
lieally surface. While Snowden ap
pears to be providing these, he also
has his own agenda. The Obama ad
ministration should realize its so
far unfulfilled 2008 promise of
transparency.
While actions speak louder than
words, words wouldn't hurt either.
It is up to the president to defend
or admonish the program, to frame
the debate for us and offer guid
ance. So far, he has only washed his
hands of it.
Frustratingly, this is becoming a
trend in the administration. Time

and time again, President Obama
has initially shrunk from taking re
sponsibility. President Truman
proudly commanded, "The buck
stops here." In a lately misman
aged administration, it's not clear
where the buck stops.
The president has just over
three years left. Until he gets his
White House in order, others will
continue to treat him as a lame
duck. He can't just sit and watch
the 2014 midterms sail by, hoping
the Republicans self-destruct.
More than anything right now,
the Democratic Party needs a
strong leader with a vision for the
country. 2008 showed that Barack
Obama has one; it's about time he
acknowledged that blueprint and
acted on it.

by President Obama as he is be
rated day after day by Republi
cans.
On the face, no one should be
too concerned about the NSA data
surveillance program. Authorized
under Section 215 Patriot Act, the
program collects metadata or,
data about data. The media has
focused on the collection of tele
phone records. These "records"
are limited to information like the
dialed number and the length of
call called Communications In
telligence (COMINT), a subset of
Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), by
our intelligence community (IC).
Thirty-nine percent of Ameri
cans, in a recent poll conducted by
the Center for International Secu
rity and Cooperation (CISAC)'s
Amy Zegart, believe that this pro
gram includes listening to the con
tent of the calls surveilled. That 39
percent are wrong. While SIGINT
can include data on location of the
dialer and other identifiable char
acteristics, the Section 215 neither
analyzes the content, or this more
personal data.
You may, then, be confused
about the purpose of this program.
What good does it do with such lim
ited information?
It simply forms a reference
database. As our IC combats terror
plots, it gives them the ability to see
which suspected terrorists are
communicating with allies inside
the United States. This database
can be seared after presenting rea
sonable suspicion that the subject is
connected to a terrorist organiza
tion.
In 2012, fewer than 300 queries
were approved.
While the vast majority of this
information is discarded, it is nev
ertheless valuable. A 2009 report
from the Director of National Intel
ligence (DNI) illustrates one exam
ple where the lack of domestic SIG

INT prior to the 9/11 attacks led us
to believe hijacker Khalid al-Mihd
nar was in Yemen. In reality, he was
living in San Diego.
This is not to say that Ameri
cans should unequivocally support
this program. Rather, it's to demon
strate a total ignorance of what our
IC really does. Laughably, Zegart's
poll shows that many Americans
relate their view of the NSA to spy
oriented movies and television
shows.
Similarly, 71 percent of Ameri
cans are okay with losing civil liber
ties to prevent terrorism, but sig
nificantly fewer people find the
NSA program acceptable.
What we need is a real discus
sion about the importance of securi
ty and liberty in this country.
Americans constantly see these at
odds. Indeed, they often (mis)quote
Ben Franklin to that end (myself in

cluded). But, it's hard to say how
liberty and security are related
when we don't know much about
the program.
So, before we can have an edu
cated discussion about security and
liberty, we need transparency.
Because of their secret nature,
many of the details will never pub
lieally surface. While Snowden ap
pears to be providing these, he also
has his own agenda. The Obama ad
ministration should realize its so
far unfulfilled 2008 promise of
transparency.
While actions speak louder than
words, words wouldn't hurt either.
It is up to the president to defend
or admonish the program, to frame
the debate for us and offer guid
ance. So far, he has only washed his
hands of it.
Frustratingly, this is becoming a
trend in the administration. Time

and time again, President Obama
has initially shrunk from taking re
sponsibility. President Truman
proudly commanded, "The buck
stops here." In a lately misman
aged administration, it's not clear
where the buck stops.
The president has just over
three years left. Until he gets his
White House in order, others will
continue to treat him as a lame
duck. He can't just sit and watch
the 2014 midterms sail by, hoping
the Republicans self-destruct.
More than anything right now,
the Democratic Party needs a
strong leader with a vision for the
country. 2008 showed that Barack
Obama has one; it's about time he
acknowledged that blueprint and
acted on it.
