### Men's soccer ends season with win over rival No. 5 Cal â€” Ashley Westhem 
Stanford men's soccer (9-
6-3) may not make it into the
NCAA tournament with last
night's win, but at least the
seniors can be satisfied that
they beat No. 5 ranked Cal in
overtime on their Senior
Night.
Going into halftime Stan
ford led 1-0 due to a goal by
junior forward Zach Batteer
in the 19th minute of the
first half. Stanford had out
shot the Golden Bears 11-1,
with five shots on goal to
Cal's zero.
Cal then came alive in the
second half, scoring in the
57th minute. Cal's senior
Alec Sundley tied the game
at 1-1 on a penalty kick.
With 10:40 left Stanford

came through with a huge
save after Cal had two oppor
tunities to score. Cal was on
the attack, keeping the Card
on its heels a sharp com
parison to the first half,
which was dominated by
Stanford.
Stanford finally had the
opportunity to score with a
minute left, controlling pos
session of the ball for the re
mainder of regulation time,
but couldn't come through
and sent the game into over
time.
Just 1:14 into overtime,
sophomore midfielder Aaron
Kovar scored the game-win
ning goal.
Stanford now has a slight
chance to make into postsea
son play and will now just
have to wait to hear its fate.
