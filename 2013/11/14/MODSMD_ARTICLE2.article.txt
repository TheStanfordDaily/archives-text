# Palo Alto votes down affordable senior housing
## 
### SAM KURLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week Palo Alto residents
voted to overturn a city council
ruling that would have re-zoned
property on Maybell Avenue to al
low construction of an affordable
senior housing project on the va
cant lot.
The Palo Alto Housing Corpora
tion (PAHC) a private non-profit
provider of affordable housing
originally acquired the parcel of
land at an auction for nearly $l6
million and planned to construct 60
housing units for low-income sen
iors on Maybell Avenue under the
modified zoning. The group now in
tends to discontinue work on the

project and sell the property.
Measure D, as the rezoning ref
erendum was designated, was op
posed by Palo Altans to Preserve
Neighborhood Zoning, a group that
was organized after the City Coun
cil voted in August to allow the af
fordable housing development to
proceed.
Cheryl Lilienstein, spokesper
son for Palo Altans to Preserve
Neighborhood Zoning, said resi
dents felt the City Council was not
receptive to their input during its
deliberations on the re-zoning issue
in August.
"The campaign started because
the City Council seemed unwilling
to hear the neighborhood's com
plaints and concerns about the

safety of children on the streets,
and about high density develop
ment in our neighborhoods that's
just never happened before,"
Lilienstein said.
The Santa Clara County Regis
trar of Voters reported 6,538 voters
in favor of rezoning the property
and 8,476 votes against.
Lilienstein was enthusiastic
about the win.
"We went into election day feel
ing hopeful and knowing that we
were in the ballpark, but having no
idea that the outcome was going to
be such a wide spread," she said.
Candice Gonzalez, executive di
rector of PAHC, expressed shock
and disappointment over the out
come.

Property to be Sold
According to Gonzalez, the re
sult leaves PAHC with no alterna
tive to selling the property.
"As we said all along, if this
measure failed, our only choice
would be to sell [the property],"
Gonzalez said. "There's no revised
viable project. We proposed what
was viable and feasible."
She explained that the project
would not have been possible under
existing zoning, since in order to
compete for funding, costs would
have to be contained.
Because land values are higher
in Palo Alto than in many other
communities where other housing
authorities are competing for the
same funding sources, PAHC need-

Ed a higher density of units than ex
isting zoning would allow, Gonzalez
added.
"You need more units to spread
out the fixed costs of the land," she
said. "We proposed the density that
was required to make an affordable
housing project work here in Palo
Alto."
The need for a larger number of
units was intensified by PAHC's
commitment to providing at least 20
units with rents of $5OO per month in
the proposed development.
"We committed to a minimum of
20 units in the extremely low in
come level," Gonzalez said. "We
need the balance of the 40 [higher
