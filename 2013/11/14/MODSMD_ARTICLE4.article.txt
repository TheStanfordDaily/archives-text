# New task force to evaluate lab safety culture
## 
### â€“ Catherine Zaw 
Stanford has created a new 12-member task
force to review and evaluate the state and per
ception of the safety culture in campus re
search laboratories while assessing how Stan
ford's research labs align with the seven key
characteristics of a strong safety culture as
identified by the American Chemical Society in
2012.
Dubbed the Task Force for Advancing the
Culture of Laboratory Safety at Stanford Uni
versity, the team whose members represent
a variety of the University's laboratory academ
ic leadership and laboratory research communi
ty held its first meeting in October and has
scheduled two additional town hall meetings lat
er in the year.
The meetings will be held primarily to gather
feedback from laboratory bench researchers,
including postdoctoral scholars, graduate stu
dents, research associates and research assis
tants.
In an interview with the Stanford Report,
Robert Waymouth, co-chair of the task force,
said the team was not created in response to a
crisis in lab safety but in guidance of the broad
consensus in the United States that all univer
sities should be paying closer attention to lab
safety practices and habits.
The task force will compile a re
port identifying the best practices
of a sound and proactive laborato
ry safety culture within the re
search labs, management systems
and programs in the University.
Using this information, the task
force will recommend ways to pro
mote and advance a robust and
positive safety culture among re
searchers.
