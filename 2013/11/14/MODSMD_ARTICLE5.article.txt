A jobs report released last Friday by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed
data that may seem optimistic for the econ
omy.
In the month of October, 204,000 jobs
were created despite the 16-day long gov
ernment shutdown. This is a higher number
than from the past three months, in which
job growth has averaged at 202,000 per
month, and over the past 12 months, in
which job growth has averaged at around
190,000 per month.
To make light of these facts, The Stan
ford Daily sat down with Michael Boskin, a
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and
professor of economics.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): First of all,
what's your take on the big figure in the
BLS report?
Michael Boskin (MB): It was only a
month and it was the month the government
shut down and there was some confusion
around it, so we should never make a lot out
of one month's data. But there's something
in it for both optimists and pessimists. So
I'm remaining hopeful that the economy will

continue to improve and hopefully that
growth will accelerate. But I think we have
a lot of head winds to that.
Right now unemployment rate is a little
over 7.3 percent. But it's been in the low sev
ens for a few months. So that's generally
bad. In the economy, we'll be doing fairly
well if we have unemployment in the fives.
Today, a large part of the reason the unem
ployment rate has come down from the peak
of 10 percent at the end of the recession, is
that large numbers of people many more
than usual have left the labor force, so
they're not included as employed or unem
ployed. They've retired early, gone back to
school, have been discouraged from and
stopped looking for work and of course
there are others who are working part time,
especially with the new healthcare law.
So glass half-full, glass half-empty is the
good way to describe [it]. It's better than it
was but it's improving very slowly. And the
headline numbers don't quite convey quite
how weak the labor market is.
TSD: Job growth has been increasing
when we look from the past 12 months to
the past three months to this past month.
Is that not an accurate sign of the econom

ic recovery?
MB: You need something like 125,000 or
150,000 just to keep up with population
growth. So with the pace that we're going, it
would take a long time to get the economy
back to what is normal or what is [consid
ered] high employment rates.
So if you're creating 200,000 jobs, it's
