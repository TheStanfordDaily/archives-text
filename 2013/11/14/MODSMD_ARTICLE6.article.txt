# ONLY A TROJAN BY NAME
## STANFORD'S ONSIDE RETURNER COMES THROUGH 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford football
team has watched a whole
lot of Trojans on film this
week, but one of them
doesn't go to USC.
The exception is Cardinal senior

Jeff Trojan, a walk-on wide receiver
whose face was plastered across over
four million television screens last
Thursday night against then-No. 3
Oregon as he successfully recovered
two of the Ducks' three onside kicks in
the fourth quarter.
There's a saying in football that

backup quarterback is the
least important position on a
team's roster until it becomes
the most important position.
Trojan's job as Stanford's
designated onside kick man
might compete for that title.
"You've got to be coura
geous to stand in there with
everybody coming at you,"
said special teams coach Pete
Alamar. "It's one of those

things that might never come
up in a season; it might come
up five times in a season. You
just don't know when it's go
ing to happen."
Trojan's road into the col
lege football spotlight was not
an easy one. He was recruited
primarily by Ivy League
schools out of high school
no, USC was not among the
interested teams and
walked on at Stanford, which
didn't sign a single scholar
ship receiver in his class.
Trojan didn't see the field
in his first three seasons, but
he earned the Greg Piers
Service Team Award after his
junior year for his special
teams contributions. This off
season, however, he took the
next step.
"It started in fall camp,
and not in the team setting,
but just having him stay af
ter and our kickers hit balls
to him," Alamar said. "In fall
camp, he probably fielded
200 onside kicks, just after
practice, taking 10, 15 balls

after almost every practice,
and just getting comfortable
with it."
Trojan eventually broke
through as the Cardinal's go
to guy on onside kicks. Ala
mar said he earned the job
due to his good hands, his
tenacity and most important
ly, his decision-making.
Onside kick recovery is de
ceptively complex; there's
more to it than just pouncing
on the football. The four
blockers on Trojan's side of
the field have to hold off six
defenders charging in from
just 10 yards away, while Tro
jan studies the bouncing ball
as if it was one of his Humßio
midterms.
"Generally there's going to
be a big hop; it just depends
on when," Trojan said. "If it's
early, then you're going to
have some little ones, or if it's
a bunch of little ones, then
you're going to have a big one.
So then you just have to do a
bunch of reps in practice,
reading them and getting a
feel for when the big hop is go
ing to be. And then once that
big hop happens, you've just
got to go attack the football."
If all goes well as it did
on the Ducks' first onside at
tempt on Thursday Trojan
has just enough time to leap
up (if the hop is late), corral
the ball, turn his back to the
defenders and fall to the
ground.
But it doesn't always work
that way. With the Ducks
trailing just 26-13 with 5:08
left in the game, Oregon kick
er Alejandro Maldenado's
second onside kick of the
night took an early hop. In
stead of picking the ball out of
the air, Trojan hesitated, let
ting the kick bounce again be
fore it hit him awkwardly in

the chest. Trojan took a big
hit, the ball squirted loose and
the Ducks recovered.
"I read it incorrectly," he
said. "It took an earlier hop
that I should've went and at
tacked right away."
Trojan got the chance to
make up for his mistake on
Oregon's third onside kick.
With 2:12 left in the game, a
successful recovery by the
Ducks would have given
them more than enough time
to erase Stanford's 26-20
lead. The balance of power in
the Pac-12 North — and the
BCS — rested on the shoul
ders of the walk-on who had
first played in a college foot
ball game just two months
earlier.
This time, Maldonado's
kick took a late hop, and Tro
jan stretched out to grab it
just moments before an Ore
gon defender flew in. With
the game secured, Trojan
raced back to the Cardinal
sideline — football in hand.
"To be honest with you, I
don't know if he kept [the
ball]," Alamar said. "You
could see how important it
was to him and how excited
he was."
Though the Cardinal will
probably be happy if it never
is in a close enough game to
require Trojan's recovery
skills again this season, the
senior still has to prepare for
USC like the rest of his
teammates do. Believe it or
not, the one thing that isn't a
huge conversation topic in
the locker room this week is
Trojan's name.
"I've never gotten any
flak for it," he claimed. "Hon
estly."

reading them and getting a
feel for when the big hop is go
ing to be. And then once that
big hop happens, you've just
got to go attack the football."
If all goes well as it did
on the Ducks' first onside at
tempt on Thursday Trojan
has just enough time to leap
up (if the hop is late), corral
the ball, turn his back to the
defenders and fall to the
ground.
But it doesn't always work
that way. With the Ducks
trailing just 26-13 with 5:08
left in the game, Oregon kick
er Alejandro Maldenado's
second onside kick of the
night took an early hop. In
stead of picking the ball out of
the air, Trojan hesitated, let
ting the kick bounce again be
fore it hit him awkwardly in

the chest. Trojan took a big
hit, the ball squirted loose and
the Ducks recovered.
"I read it incorrectly," he
said. "It took an earlier hop
that I should've went and at
tacked right away."
Trojan got the chance to
make up for his mistake on
Oregon's third onside kick.
With 2:12 left in the game, a
successful recovery by the
Ducks would have given
them more than enough time
to erase Stanford's 26-20
lead. The balance of power in
the Pac-12 North — and the
BCS — rested on the shoul
ders of the walk-on who had
first played in a college foot
ball game just two months
earlier.
This time, Maldonado's
kick took a late hop, and Tro
jan stretched out to grab it
just moments before an Ore
gon defender flew in. With
the game secured, Trojan
raced back to the Cardinal
sideline — football in hand.
"To be honest with you, I
don't know if he kept [the
ball]," Alamar said. "You
could see how important it
was to him and how excited
he was."
Though the Cardinal will
probably be happy if it never
is in a close enough game to
require Trojan's recovery
skills again this season, the
senior still has to prepare for
USC like the rest of his
teammates do. Believe it or
not, the one thing that isn't a
huge conversation topic in
the locker room this week is
Trojan's name.
"I've never gotten any
flak for it," he claimed. "Hon
estly."

The No. 4 Stanford football
team has watched a whole
lot of Trojans on film this
week, but one of them
doesn't go to USC.
The exception is Cardinal senior

Jeff Trojan, a walk-on wide receiver
whose face was plastered across over
four million television screens last
Thursday night against then-No. 3
Oregon as he successfully recovered
two of the Ducks' three onside kicks in
the fourth quarter.
There's a saying in football that

backup quarterback is the
least important position on a
team's roster until it becomes
the most important position.
Trojan's job as Stanford's
designated onside kick man
might compete for that title.
"You've got to be coura
geous to stand in there with
everybody coming at you,"
said special teams coach Pete
Alamar. "It's one of those

things that might never come
up in a season; it might come
up five times in a season. You
just don't know when it's go
ing to happen."
Trojan's road into the col
lege football spotlight was not
an easy one. He was recruited
primarily by Ivy League
schools out of high school
no, USC was not among the
interested teams and
walked on at Stanford, which
didn't sign a single scholar
ship receiver in his class.
Trojan didn't see the field
in his first three seasons, but
he earned the Greg Piers
Service Team Award after his
junior year for his special
teams contributions. This off
season, however, he took the
next step.
"It started in fall camp,
and not in the team setting,
but just having him stay af
ter and our kickers hit balls
to him," Alamar said. "In fall
camp, he probably fielded
200 onside kicks, just after
practice, taking 10, 15 balls

after almost every practice,
and just getting comfortable
with it."
Trojan eventually broke
through as the Cardinal's go
to guy on onside kicks. Ala
mar said he earned the job
due to his good hands, his
tenacity and most important
ly, his decision-making.
Onside kick recovery is de
ceptively complex; there's
more to it than just pouncing
on the football. The four
blockers on Trojan's side of
the field have to hold off six
defenders charging in from
just 10 yards away, while Tro
jan studies the bouncing ball
as if it was one of his Humßio
midterms.
"Generally there's going to
be a big hop; it just depends
on when," Trojan said. "If it's
early, then you're going to
have some little ones, or if it's
a bunch of little ones, then
you're going to have a big one.
So then you just have to do a
bunch of reps in practice,
reading them and getting a
feel for when the big hop is go
ing to be. And then once that
big hop happens, you've just
