## Oregon's system is still fine

About Oregon football:
What can we really
say? As Sports Illus
trated pointed out, the
two teams would hard
ly consider themselves rivals Stan
ford cares more about Cal and USC,
while Oregon saves its loathing for
Oregon State and Washington. Yet, as
last Thursday's game against the
Ducks proved once again, it is Stan
ford and Oregon that have singlehand
edly done more to cannibalize the Pac
12's national championship hopes
than anyone else in the conference.
For four consecutive years now,
one of the two has derailed the other's
national championship dreams. Ore
gon is technically still in the hunt, but
with the Ducks no longer in control of
their destiny, the national champi
onship game must seem far away.
Having lost multiple title shots at the
hands of the Ducks in recent years,
Stanford's sympathy must be rather
limited.
Let's look at how the Cardinal
pounded the Ducks, with reference to
my "Keys to the Game" preview last
week. Put simply, Stanford exceeded
even my wildest expectations. Stan
ford's defense held the Ducks to just
312 yards of offense and Oregon
needed a spectacularly fluky run of
special teams luck just to make the
score respectable. Here is my mea
culpa to the Stanford offense: The
Cardinal punted only once all night.
I've heard a lot of snark since the
game about how Oregon's offense
can't play with the big boys, and I
think that's profoundly untrue. Stan
ford stomped a good team. Now,
there are certainly elements of Ore
gon's scheme that I'm not comfort
able with. The Ducks space their of
fensive line to widen running lanes,
which also makes it easier for defend
ers to get into the backfield. Marcus
Mariota can throw the ball, but his ef
ficiency is built upon run game misdi
rection and play-action passing; as
the numbers showed, he's not close to
being an effective drop-back passer,
and his performance on Thursday
may have cost him eight figures in
next year's NFL Draft. Against
teams that can stop the run like Stan
ford, Mariota doesn't totally wilt, but
he's no Heisman contender.
But just because Oregon has is
sues throwing the ball, it doesn't
mean that it doesn't have good plays.
Elements of its passing game can be
found in any pro-style offense. Would
Oregon be better if Mariota could
throw the ball like Andrew Luck?
Sure, but what team wouldn't?
Schematically a few quibbles
aside Oregon plays pretty darn
sound football. The option offense it
practices is often denounced as gim
micky and the last resort of a talent
less team (a la Navy and Georgia
Tech), but Tom Osborne's late-'9os
option teams at Nebraska are univer
sally revered. Oregon offensive coor
dinator Scott Frost won a national
championship running the option at
Nebraska. He knows that the option
is no barrier to success.
There is no special "Oregon blue
print," just as there was no special
"Stanford blueprint" when Oregon
knocked Stanford out of the national
title hunt twice in a row. Stanford got
the benefit of the doubt because it
played pro-style ball; distrust, more
than anything else, is the price Ore
gon pays for running the spread.
My keys to stopping Oregon
would work just as well against Ala
bama or Texas A&M or Ohio State.
Can you stop the run without putting
a safety in the box? Great, you always
want to do that. Can you contain in
the run game, prevent quarterback
scrambles and defend seams in zone
coverage? Super! Win field position?
Of course. Blow up the offensive line?
I'll take that any day of the week.
Covering its own bases, Oregon
famously tight-lipped about in
juries said after the game that
Mariota had been playing on a
banged-up knee. The vaunted Hawai
ian didn't look elite, but it wasn't as
though he couldn't run; he flashed se
rious wheels on a fourth-and-8 first
down scramble late in the third quar
ter, and Stanford never dared to
crash down on the zone read to force
Mariota to run.
Stanford outplayed Oregon.
That's the story. Stanford didn't beat
Oregon because it solved Oregon's
scheme. Stanford didn't beat Oregon
because Mariota was hobbled. Stan-
