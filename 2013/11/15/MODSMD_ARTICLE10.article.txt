SAM FISHER
STANFORD 27, USC 17; Justin time for this
matchup, USC has pulled itself together and is in position to
give the Cardinal a scare. Coming off a huge win against
Oregon, Stanford needs to be wary of a letdown. There is
too much senior leadership on this Stanford team, however,
for the Cardinal to let that happen. While USC has big-play
threats in wide receivers Marqise Lee and Nelson Agholor, I
don't think Cody Kessler can be accurate enough under
pressure to take advantage. Look for Stanford to dominate
on the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball to take
command of the game, slowly squeeze the life out of the
Trojans and effectively clinch the Pac-12 North.

STANFORD 24, USC 1 0; We'll see if the Car
dinal offense can carry over its masterful performance
against Oregon last Thursday to the Coliseum tomorrow,
but either way, the Cardinal defense is too good to let an
upset happen. As crazy as it may seem, Stanford has yet
to play a complete game this year. What better time than
to do it in front of a sellout crowd of 93,000 at the Colise
um? I think Stanford builds an early lead and wears down
the Trojans like the Cardinal did against UCLA. Tyler
Gaffney should see a lighter load after his ridiculous 45
carries last week, and Ty Montgomery should be more in
volved, whether it's in the passing game or on the end
arounds. I just think Trent Murphy and Shayne Skov will
be too much for Cody Kessler and the Trojans offensive
line to handle, propelling Stanford past USC for the fifth
consecutive season.
MICHAEL PETERSON
STANFORD 23, USC 16: USC rides a three
game winning streak into this matchup and should get off
to a fast start thanks to a pumped-up team and an ener
getic atmosphere at the Coliseum. However, this Stanford
team looked too good last week against Oregon to falter
here. Expect a close game, and maybe an early USC
lead, but also for Shayne Skov, Trent Murphy and the
Card front seven to shut down the USC offense by elimi
nating the run game and pressuring Kessler into bad
throws. The Card made Matt Barkley look mediocre at
best last year, and I don't expect Kessler to have any
more success than Barkley did. That being said, USC
won't go away easily and does stop the run well, so Stan
ford will have to grind this one out. Tyler Gaffney and the
dominant offensive line will eventually break the Trojans
down, and the defense will shut down any last-gasp USC
rally attempts.
