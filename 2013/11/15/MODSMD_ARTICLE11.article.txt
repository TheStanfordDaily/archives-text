### WHAT TO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
Another year, another
game against USC; it's
time to get your heart
medication ready! For
some reason, Stanford
hasn't been able to pull away from
the Trojans in any of their last three
matchups. That may be a big reason
why Las Vegas has Stanford as only a
31/2-point favorite against the un
ranked Trojans.

I hate to sound like a broken
record, but the keys to this game
are remarkably similar to the keys
over the past few weeks, and the
first key is the most important
and redundant of all: Stanford
has to control the line of scrim
mage on both sides of the ball.
Historically, USC has given
Stanford trouble in large part due
to its strong core of defensive line
men. As Winston Shi noted in his
column earlier this week, penetra
tion from the defensive line is
great against any team, and that is
especially true against Stanford.
In Stanford's last visit to the
Coliseum back in 2011, USC's de
fensive line got pressure on quar
terback Andrew Luck 'l2 all night
long. Only through spectacular
poise and accuracy was Luck able
to lead scoring drives; he seemed
to get flushed from the pocket on
every play.

While junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan looked good against
the Ducks, he does not have those
same tools that Luck had to put up

points while being harassed. Stan
ford will have to keep USC's pass
rushers notably defensive line
man Leonard Williams and outside
linebacker Devon Kennard

from getting to Hogan or Stan
ford's running backs. If the Cardi
nal can't do that, then frequent
third-and-long situations could
stall Stanford drives repeatedly,
putting its defense in a tough
spot.

Speaking of the Stanford de
fense, pressure is key on that side
of the ball as well. In 2012, Stan
ford stopped USC's playmaking
wide receivers by not giving quar
terback Matt Barkley time to
throw the ball. USC's offensive
line looks to be improved but is
still a relative weakness. Stan
ford's defensive front should be
able to get to quarterback Cody
Kessler early and often, and that
will be key in keeping USC off the
scoreboard.

The secondary key to the
game is keeping Hogan involved in
the running game. Against the
Ducks, Stanford head coach David
Shaw had Hogan run the read-op

tion game with senior running
back Ricky Seale for the first time
all season, replacing sophomore
quarterback Dallas Lloyd and his
fumble problems.
Not only did Hogan succeed
in those packages Hogan's
touchdown run came on one of
those plays but I really feel that
those runs allowed Hogan to get
into a better rhythm. Hogan was
fast through his progressions and
not afraid to run all night long.
Stanford had missed the mobile
aspect of Hogan's game for so
long; that added dimension is
huge to the Cardinal offense.
Hogan also didn't seem to have
"happy feet" problems at all, mov
ing his feet only in a productive
manner to buy time or yardage.
If Stanford can use Hogan for
a few important runs, not only will
the Cardinal have a higher success
rate on third downs but it will also
get better overall production from
its quarterback, and that could be
the difference in the game.

Sam Fisher is going to request the
USC press box be stocked with ex
tra beta-blockers on Saturday
evening. Check in on him after the
