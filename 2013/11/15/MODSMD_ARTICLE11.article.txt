### WHAT TO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
Another year, another
game against USC; it's
time to get your heart
medication ready! For
some reason, Stanford
hasn't been able to pull away from
the Trojans in any of their last three
matchups. That may be a big reason
why Las Vegas has Stanford as only a
31/2-point favorite against the un
ranked Trojans.

I hate to sound like a broken
record, but the keys to this game
are remarkably similar to the keys
over the past few weeks, and the
first key is the most important
and redundant of all: Stanford
has to control the line of scrim
mage on both sides of the ball.
Historically, USC has given
Stanford trouble in large part due
to its strong core of defensive line
men. As Winston Shi noted in his
column earlier this week, penetra
tion from the defensive line is
great against any team, and that is
especially true against Stanford.
In Stanford's last visit to the
Coliseum back in 2011, USC's de
fensive line got pressure on quar
terback Andrew Luck 'l2 all night
long. Only through spectacular
poise and accuracy was Luck able
to lead scoring drives; he seemed
to get flushed from the pocket on
every play.

While junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan looked good against
the Ducks, he does not have those
same tools that Luck had to put up
