# BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DAILY TROJAN
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's football
game between Stanford and USC, The
Daily's Do-Hyoung Park chatted with
Will Laws, one of the sports editors at
The Daily Trojan, to get perspective from
both camps. Below is a partial transcript
of their conversation. For thefull conversa
tion, go to wwwstanforddaily.com/categ
ory/sports.

Do-Hyoung Park (DP): So, first of all, I
wanted to ask more of a big-picture ques
tion: Ever since Kiffin got the sack, the Tro
jans are 4-1 with convincing victories over
Oregon State and Arizona. How has the
team changed since Orgeron took over, and
what's been different?

Will Laws (WL): Well, the most obvious
difference has been the loose atmosphere
Orgeron has instituted since taking over the
team. Before Kiffin was fired, the players
were essentially playing for Kiffin's coaching
career at USC, and they knew it. Now,
there's no pressure on them.
Even if USC finishes 1 -2 by beating Col-

performance against Oregon, will face another talented front seven when Stanford clashes with USC.
orado and losing to Stanford and
UCLA, Orgeron will, in all likeli
hood, stay on the staff as recruiting
coordinator. And if they somehow
win out or make the Pac-12 Cham
pionship, Athletic Director Pat
Haden will have to take a hard look
at Orgeron as the permanent head
coach, which the players would
love. And the offensive play calling
has reflected that loose mentality
since taking the play calling
reins from Kiffin, offensive coordi
nator Clay Helton has been more
willing to take shots downfield
with Marqise Lee and Nelson
Agholor, and it has helped all as
pects of the offense.
I really thought that the Stan
ford offense would take a dip with
the graduation of Stepfan Taylor,
but the Cardinal hasn't missed a
beat, and has unearthed another
gem in Tyler Gaffney. Taylor ab
solutely ripped USC last year for
213 total yards and two touch
downs how does Gaffney com
pare to his predecessor?
DP: Most of us at Stanford thought

that the running game (and by ex
tension, the offense) would take a
big hit with the graduation of Tay
lor, too. Shaw promised all offsea
son that he'd be using a rotating
stable of running backs to supplant
Taylor's production, but Gaffney
emerged early as the primary pow
er back that had the vision and raw
physical drive that could give the
Card that production again and
forced Shaw's hand to make him
the clear number one after a
year off for baseball, no less.
Speaking of Stanford's run
ning game, the Trojan rush defense
is ranked second in the Pac-12, be
hind only Stanford. USC's defen
sive front is bigger and more phys
ically capable of matching the Car
dinal's offensive line than that of
the Ducks. Do you think the Tro
jans can stuff Stanford's power
running game? If so, with the pow
er run being the Cardinal offense's
bread and butter, what do you
think that means for Stanford's of
fense this Saturday?

WL: USC's starting defensive front

is certainly capable of shutting
down Stanford's running game,
but there are a lot of "ifs" involved
here. Sophomore defensive tackle
Leonard Williams, arguably the
most talented player on USC's ros
ter, missed last week's game
against Cal with a shoulder injury.
He's probable for this Saturday. If
he's healthy, USC stands a much
better chance of shutting down
Gaffney. If not, USC's depth will
be tested, and that might not turn
out so well for a squad that is still
reeling from scholarship reduc
tions.

It'll be tough for the Trojans to
hold Stanford's running game at
bay for four quarters, even with
Williams. And if USC can't get
past Stanford's formidable offen
sive line, Kevin Hogan might have
the best game of his career if he
can capitalize on passes to the
edge of the field against USC's
maligned cornerbacks.

DP: What's the mood on the USC
campus like right now in the face
of this big rivalry matchup?

WL: There hasn't been this much
optimism in the fan base since Au
gust 2012, before the downfall of
Lane Kiffin began. It's amazing
how the Trojan faithful has been
seemingly reinvigorated by the
termination of Kiffin and USC's
subsequent inspiring play. As a
senior who's never witnessed a
USC win over Stanford, I would
take much more delight in a win
over the Cardinal than a win over
UCLA this year and I know I'm
not alone.

How do you see this matchup
playing out?
DP: I think it'll be relatively close,
but I'll take Stanford 21-10. How
about you?

WL: I see a pretty low-scoring af
fair, with both teams struggling to
move the ball consistently. Vegas
is currently favoring Stanford by
31/2 points, and I think that's
spot on. In the end, I see Stan
ford eking out a 19-16 victory.
