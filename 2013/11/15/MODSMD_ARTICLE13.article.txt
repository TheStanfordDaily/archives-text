# DOMINATING A RIVALRY

### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
"Give me the statistic that makes a guy take
an extra rep in the offseason because he is sick
of being on a losing team, or makes him work
that one bit harder to make the game-saving
tackle as the backside safety."
Football Editor Joey Beyda gave me that
challenge earlier this week while we were debat
ing whether or not the Cardinal is due for a loss
against USC after winning each of the last four
matchups.

The question, in its entirety, boils down to
whether teams become more likely to beat their
rival after losing to that rival for a few years in a
row. Joseph thought they were; I thought they

weren't.

For the analysis, I looked at the last 30 meet
ings of each of the top-25 college football rival
ries, according to Yahoo! Sports. I replaced LSU-
Arkansas, which is the only rivalry of the 25 that
hasn't been played continuously over the past 30
years, with Stanford-USC in honor of tomor
row's big game. By looking at every winning
streak in each of the rivalry, I calculated proba
bilities of a team winning a rivalry game given
how may consecutive losses it had suffered go
ing into that edition of a game.
Due to data constraints, I counted streaks of
five or more losses as just five losses in the prob
abilities. This intuitively gels with the question,
as there are very few college football players
who have six years of eligibility, so any player on

a team with at least five consecutive losses to its
rival has only been a part of the team while it is
on a losing streak, so a streak of more than five
games is equivalent to streak of exactly five
games in any of the players' minds.
The results of this data are intriguing. At
first, it seems that poor Joey Beyda is very
wrong. As the chart shows, there is a negative
correlation between length of a losing streak and
winning percentage for that team. In simpler
terms, the longer a losing streak that a team is
on to its rival, the lower the chance that the "un
derdog" will win the next game.
Looking further into the data, it is worth
noting that at no point does the winning per-
