2009
STANFORD 55, USC 21: THE 2009
matchup between the Cardinal and Trojans
will be forever known as the "What's your
deal?" game. No. 25 Stanford strolled into the
Coliseum and proceeded to embarrass the then
ninth-ranked Trojans 55-21. Toby Gerhart 'lO
had an outstanding day on the ground with 178
yards rushing and three scores. The most fa
mous moment from that game, however, was
when Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh drew
the ire of Trojans head coach Pete Carroll for
his decision to attempt a two-point conversion in
order to drop 50 points on SC. At the postgame
handshake, Harbaugh responded to Carroll's
rhetorical question of "What's your deal?" with a
now-immortal response, What's your deal?"
2010
STANFORD 37, USC 35: THE RE
match at Stanford Stadium proved to be a far

closer affair than the 2009 game. USC's Matt
Barkley and Stanford's Andrew Luck 'l2
matched each other score for score all night
long, with both quarterbacks finishing with
three touchdown passes and no interceptions.
A failed PAT by Stanford with 9:27 left loomed
large until Luck led the Cardinal on a seven
play, 62-yard drive that began with only 1:08
left on the clock. A 30-yard field goal from
Nate Whitaker 'lO as time expired gave the
Cardinal a 37-35 win over the unranked Tro
jans, and Stanford's fans stormed the field in
celebration.
2011
STANFORD 56, USC 48 (30T):
Until this past Thursday, the 2011 matchup be
tween No. 4 Stanford and No. 20 USC was
perhaps the most memorable game for Cardi
nal fans in recent memory. Andrew Luck led a
game-tying drive late in the fourth quarter after
a pick-six from USC cornerback Nickell Robey
gave USC a seven-point lead with three min
utes remaining. After Stanford tied the game
with 38 seconds, Stanford and USC went to
overtime. In the third overtime, Stanford
scored a touchdown and two-point conversion.

Afterwards, with the Trojans inside the Cardi
nal 5-yard line, USC running back Curtis Mc-
Neil fumbled the football, then-junior line
backer A.J. Tarpley recovered it in the end
zone and Stanford remained unbeaten.
2012
STANFORD 21, USC 14: The 2012
contest between No. 2 USC and No. 21 Stan
ford was supposed to be the year, at least in
USC fans' eyes, that the Trojans would break
the Card's winning streak in the series. Stan
ford had other ideas, as the Cardinal defense
wreaked havoc on a depleted Trojan offensive
line; while injured USC senior center Khaled
Holmes watched on the sidelines, Stanford's
defense targeted his replacement Cyrus Hob
bi, leading to four sacks on Matt Barkley. The
Cardinal defense pitched a shutout in the sec
ond half, and Stanford fans stormed the field
again in a wild celebration. Barkley would
graduate without beating Stanford, and the
Cardinal would have its first four-game win
ning streak against USC in school history.
