# Football's home stretch to remember
## 
### Joey Beyda 
Oregon. USC. Cal. Notre
Dame. It has a bit of a ring to
it. Oregon. USC. Cal. Notre
Dame. Four games (with a
possible fifth) to determine
which plane Stanford football will board
this bowl season; four names that elicit a
visceral reaction from any Stanford fan.
There's the showdown against the

Cardinal's former
kryptonite, the
recently rejuve
nated rivalry in
SoCal, the his
toric contest
with an archene
my and the meet
up with a storied

program that out-Stanforded Stanford
last season. No four teams have been
more heated rivals of the Cardinal dur
ing the last decade and a half, and no
four regular-season games could bring
the BCS era to a more fitting close for
Stanford.

If everything goes well.
Maybe that's why people are so
scared of the Cardinal's trip to USC this
weekend. Full disclosure: I haven't
watched a USC game, start to finish,
since Lane Kiffin was fired as head coach
earlier this season. But just 10 days ago,
it seemed like everyone expected Stan
ford to dominate the Trojans. After the
Cardinal knocked off the No. 3 Ducks,
that confidence gave way to wariness.
Does a fairytale finish to 2013 just
seem too good to be true?
Oregon. USC. Cal. Notre Dame.
We've actually seen this script before,
back in 2009, when Stanford finished its
regular season with these exact same op
ponents in the exact same order. Af
ter upsetting the No. 7 Ducks at home
sound familiar? the Cardinal trav
eled to the Coliseum and put an infa
mous 55-21 beating on No. 11 USC.
That was two Trojans head coaches

ago, which is important for a cou
ple of reasons. First of all, we
probably won't be hearing
"What's your deal?" at midfield
this Saturday, but more impor
tantly, USC's program is in a very
different place this time around.
Stanford was the straw that broke
the Trojan camel's back in 2009;
it could be the cornerstone of a
new USC dynasty's palace in
2013.

2009 also taught us some
thing else: Don't sleep on Cal.
The Bears were the only Stanford
rival to beat the Card in that sea
son-ending stretch four years ago,
and a Big Game win is pretty
much the only thing that could
salvage their dismal 2013 season.
As a friend pointed out to me
recently, in seven conference
games, Stanford has handed six
teams their first Pac-12 losses and
given the seventh (Utah) its first
and only Pac-12 win. The strange
streak will end against the 4-2
Trojans, but if Cal can't take care
of the Colorado team it replaced
as the Pac-12's doormat, the Bears
will enter Stanford Stadium at 0-8
in conference play. Just saying.
And you can't ignore an Irish
team that (with an exception in
2010) has always played the Car
dinal close and has won 10 of
the teams' 15 matchups since
1998. Though Stanford still has a
bad taste in its mouth from last
year's loss, Notre Dame will be
carrying a chip on its shoulder
from the rest of its bumpy 2013
season.

Oregon. USC. Cal. Notre
Dame. In a few weeks, we'll ei
ther want to remember these four
games for the rest of our lives or
pretend they never happened.
I have no idea which.

Joseph Beyda is still holding out
hope for a Shaw-Orgeron postgame
verbal spat. Give him your predicted
dialogue between the head coaches
