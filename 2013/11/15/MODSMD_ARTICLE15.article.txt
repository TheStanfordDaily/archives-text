# Football's home stretch to remember
## 
### Joey Beyda 
Oregon. USC. Cal. Notre
Dame. It has a bit of a ring to
it. Oregon. USC. Cal. Notre
Dame. Four games (with a
possible fifth) to determine
which plane Stanford football will board
this bowl season; four names that elicit a
visceral reaction from any Stanford fan.
There's the showdown against the

Cardinal's former
kryptonite, the
recently rejuve
nated rivalry in
SoCal, the his
toric contest
with an archene
my and the meet
up with a storied

program that out-Stanforded Stanford
last season. No four teams have been
more heated rivals of the Cardinal dur
ing the last decade and a half, and no
four regular-season games could bring
the BCS era to a more fitting close for
Stanford.

If everything goes well.
Maybe that's why people are so
scared of the Cardinal's trip to USC this
weekend. Full disclosure: I haven't
watched a USC game, start to finish,
since Lane Kiffin was fired as head coach
earlier this season. But just 10 days ago,
it seemed like everyone expected Stan
ford to dominate the Trojans. After the
Cardinal knocked off the No. 3 Ducks,
that confidence gave way to wariness.
Does a fairytale finish to 2013 just
seem too good to be true?
Oregon. USC. Cal. Notre Dame.
We've actually seen this script before,
back in 2009, when Stanford finished its
regular season with these exact same op
ponents in the exact same order. Af
ter upsetting the No. 7 Ducks at home
sound familiar? the Cardinal trav
eled to the Coliseum and put an infa
mous 55-21 beating on No. 11 USC.
That was two Trojans head coaches
