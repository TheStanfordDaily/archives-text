# DEFENSE KEY TO WIN
## 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball
team bounced back from its first de
feat of the season with a 71-58 home
victory over the Northwestern Wild
cats, earning its sixth win in eight
meetings against the Big-Ten school.

The Cardinal was boosted by the play
of seniors Josh Huestis and Anthony
Brown, both of whom were especially
effective crashing the glass. Huestis fin
ished with 18 points and seven re
bounds, while Brown added 12 points
and eight boards.
Despite strong play by guards
Drew Crawford and JerShon Cobb,
who combined for 34 points, it was
clear from the outset that the Wild
cats posed very few of the same prob
lems BYU had created for Stanford on
Monday night. Sloppy play by the Car
dinal was largely the reason the game
was close at halftime, as Stanford sur
rendered eight turnovers and gave up
many open looks.
Solid offensive play by Stefan
Nastic anchored the Stanford attack
in the first half, as the senior center
led the Cardinal with eight. Craw
ford tallied 13 points for Northwest
ern in the first half.
The second half went more ac
cording to plan for Stanford. North
western struggled to the tune of 33
percent shooting on 11-of-33 from
the floor in the second frame. To give
the Cardinal credit, the defensive fo
cus was dramatically better in the
second half. Crawford was held to
just two points in the second frame.
The game was still tight with
15:07 to play after a layup by North
western center Alex Olah put the
score at 35-32 Stanford. The Cardi
nal then embarked on a 13-1 run
over a five-minute span to effectively
put away the Wildcats. Stanford's
dominance on the glass was crucial
during the run. Sophomore center

Grant Verhoeven came off the bench
to provide a career-high eight re
bounds in just 16 minutes of action,
as Stanford at one point was able to
collect eight consecutive rebounds
en route to its 11 second-chance
points in the second half. The Wild
cats would never again get closer
than nine points.
After the 112-point debacle

against BYU, it was clear the empha
sis on this night for Stanford would
be defense, and the Cardinal deliv
ered on that promise.
"We just made it a point to come
out and play defense," said Huestis.
"I know all of us were really disap
pointed in ourselves about how we
