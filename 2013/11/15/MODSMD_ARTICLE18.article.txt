# Card holds off fiesty Ducks
## HOWARD, WOPAT LEAD THE ATTACK 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 6 Stanford women's vol
leyball (19-5) defeated Oregon last
night on the road for the second
time this season.

Last time, the Cardinal took
care of the Ducks in a three-set
sweep. This time around, the
Ducks managed to take the Card to
one more set on their home court.
Stanford pulled it together to pre
vent a fifth set and took the match,
25-15, 20-25, 25-23,25-15.

Sophomore outside hitter Brit
tany Howard led the Cardinal on
the offensive end with a game-high
tying 15 kills to go with six digs.
Senior Carly Wopat trailed with 10
kills, and many other Cardinal play
ers contributed as well. Sophomore
Jordan Burgess had nine kills and 14
digs, while senior Rachel Williams
recorded nine kills and 17 digs.

Both teams had the same num
ber of total kills at 53; however,
whereas the Card only had 15 at
tack errors, the Ducks tallied 32.
The Ducks came alive after a 10-
point loss in the first set and rallied
for a second-set win. The Card
came close to losing the third set,
narrowly pulling ahead at the end.
The Ducks weren't able to pull it
together in the end, and the Card
came up with another decisive set
win.

Stanford takes on Oregon State
tomorrow at 7 p.m. in Corvallis. The
Card is 57-0 against the Beavers all
time, and in their first meeting of
the season, the Card blew out the
Beavers in a three-set sweep.
In that win, Burgess led the
Card with 10 kills and seven digs,
hitting .364. Sophomore middle
blocker Inky Ajanaku hit an impres
sive .800 with eight kills on 10 er
rorless swings. If that match is any
indication, along with the match
last night, the sophomores will con
tinue to play a big role as the Cardi
nal looks to dominate against the
Beavers.

First serve against the Beavers
is set for Saturday at 7 p.m.
