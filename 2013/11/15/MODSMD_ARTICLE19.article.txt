### CALEB SMITH 
Military movies can be some of the best movies, as
they can make their audiences gasp, cheer, cling
to their seats and sometimes even change their
worldview. Here's a rundown of five of the best of

5 "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the
World": Set during the Napoleonic Wars between
France and Great Britain, this boisterous adventure fol
lows the efforts of a British warship to find and destroy its
French enemy. Although outgunned, the plucky British crew
refuses to concede defeat as it takes on a wily French priva
teer. Featuring realistic action and scenes shot in the majes
tic Galapagos Islands, this is a must-see for any fan of high
seas adventure and deception. Russell Crowe stars as the in
trepid Captain "Lucky Jack" Aubrey, and Peter Weir directed
the film, which was nominated for 10 Academy Awards.

J| "The Longest Day": The archetypal military epic about
j\ the Second World War, this film recounts the D-Day in-
T vasion of France in astounding detail. Featuring a daz
zling array of stars such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Sean
Connery, Rod Steiger and Robert Mitchum, this film used a
variety of important real D-day participants to help stay true
to actual events.

3 "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worry
ing and Love the Bomb": An insane American general
(General Jack D. Ripper) orders a nuclear first strike on
the Soviet Union in this stirring military satire. As forces
from both nations scramble to avert nuclear mutually as
sured destruction, this movie challenges its audience's opin
ions about nuclear weapons. This film appeals to a wide va
riety of tastes and features both comic and tragic elements.
