### CALEB SMITH 
Military movies can be some of the best movies, as
they can make their audiences gasp, cheer, cling
to their seats and sometimes even change their
worldview. Here's a rundown of five of the best of

5 "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the
World": Set during the Napoleonic Wars between
France and Great Britain, this boisterous adventure fol
lows the efforts of a British warship to find and destroy its
French enemy. Although outgunned, the plucky British crew
refuses to concede defeat as it takes on a wily French priva
teer. Featuring realistic action and scenes shot in the majes
tic Galapagos Islands, this is a must-see for any fan of high
seas adventure and deception. Russell Crowe stars as the in
trepid Captain "Lucky Jack" Aubrey, and Peter Weir directed
the film, which was nominated for 10 Academy Awards.

J| "The Longest Day": The archetypal military epic about
j\ the Second World War, this film recounts the D-Day in-
T vasion of France in astounding detail. Featuring a daz
zling array of stars such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Sean
Connery, Rod Steiger and Robert Mitchum, this film used a
variety of important real D-day participants to help stay true
to actual events.

3 "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worry
ing and Love the Bomb": An insane American general
(General Jack D. Ripper) orders a nuclear first strike on
the Soviet Union in this stirring military satire. As forces
from both nations scramble to avert nuclear mutually as
sured destruction, this movie challenges its audience's opin
ions about nuclear weapons. This film appeals to a wide va
riety of tastes and features both comic and tragic elements.
The film stars Peter Sellers and was directed
by Stanley Kubrick.

2 "The Hunt for Red October": Soviet
nuclear submarine Captain Marko
Ramius (Sean Connery) leads both Soviet
and American forces on a wild chase in this
searing thriller based on a Tom Clancy nov

to figure out if Captain Ramius is trying to
defect to the United States or if he is
trying to launch a nuclear war. Plot twists
abound as both nations threaten to destroy
Ramius' submarine but is Ramius' biggest
threat already on board? John McTiernan di

rected this naval thriller.

I"The Great Escape": In the best escape
movie ever made, a group of Allied pris
oners of war attempt to escape from a spe
cially built German camp. These prisoners, all
of whom are previous escapees, attempt to
overcome the formidable German defenses by
digging a long tunnel to launch a mass break
out attempt. Featuring Steve McQueen, James
Garner and Richard Attenborough, one of the
best scores of any military movie (written by
Elmer Bernstein), and some truly exceptional
stunt scenes, this movie will leave audiences
entranced and astounded. John Sturges direct
ed this heart-pounding thriller, which, remark
ably enough, is based on true events.
