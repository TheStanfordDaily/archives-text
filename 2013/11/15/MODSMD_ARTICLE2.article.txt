## ROTC stays the course Few changes since controversial return 
### DANIA MARINSHAW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two and a half years after the Faculty
Senate invited the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps (ROTC) back to campus
in a contentious vote, not much has
changed in the daily lives of ROTC stu
dents at Stanford. Cadets still have to
travel to surrounding campuses for the
majority of their training, but they are
now able to receive activity and academic
credits for their ROTC coursework.

For ROTC cadet Isabel Lopez 'l4,
the recognition from the University has
helped her feel more supported on cam
pus.

"Having the units is nice, but given
that there's a lot of ignorance on campus
about the military and ROTC, it's nice to
feel that someone is genuinely interest
ed and cares to help us out," Lopez said.
"Not that there's anything bad that hap
pens, but it's just nice to be recognized
like that."

The ROTC was formally invited back
to campus in April 2011 after more than
a year of contentious discussion during
which competing petitions circulated,
Condoleezza Rice and George Shultz
weighed in and an ad hoc committee was
formed to explore the issue.
Much of the controversy involved
the ban against transgender people serv
ing in the military as well as the limits
that the ROTC can put on academic ex
ploration. In a statement released follow
ing the Faculty Senate's vote, President
John Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 wrote that they
understood the concerns of discrimina
tion, "but if the leadership of the military
is drawn from communities that teach
and practice true tolerance, change is

more likely to occur."

Even before the vote, however, Stan
ford had a relationship with the ROTC
branches as students participated in the
program through other schools either
Santa Clara University, San Jose State
University or Berkeley, depending on the
service branch.

Because a full ROTC branch has still
not been established at Stanford, the
nine current ROTC cadets have to com
mute for much of their training.
Scott Calvert, senior administrator
in the Office of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education and retired Navy
officer, said that because of budget cuts,
the Department of Defense is not cur
rently looking to expand its capacity and
add ROTC branches.

"So, we kind of went to a plan B,"
Calvert explained, "and here's the thing
that changed: The other part was to rec
ognize the work that ROTC students
were doing and to give credit."
As of the 2012-13 school year,

cadets are able to receive one unit of ac
tivity credit each quarter and two units
of academic credit for each ROTC course
taken during their sophomore, junior and
senior years, but only with a grade of
Credit/No Credit. Cadets can apply these
units towards graduation under the same
guidelines as the general undergraduate
population.

"I wish I got academic credit it
would boost my GPA," Lopez said. "It's
not like they're joke classes. There are
comparable classes at Stanford."
The Army branch ROTC has also es
tablished an office in Sweet Hall, which
acts as home base for a handful of cadre
affiliated with the Stanford military com
munity. These captains teach a first-year
military science course on campus, and
more broadly serve as the point persons
for any ROTC-related student questions
or concerns. The office is useful, but "a
very underutilized resource," according

Day feature. Although the ROTC was invited back in 2011, it has yet to establish a full
branch on Stanford's campus, so cadets continue to commute to other schools.
to Lopez. The other ROTC
branches do not have offices on
campus.

"Even for the Army ROTC
program, we are trying to rebuild
the program back at Stanford, and
we are actually providing more
army cadre there just to cover in
the office hours during the week,"
said Army ROTC enrollment offi
cer Mario Morales. "But it's still
kind of a work in progress."
Despite the controversy sur
rounding the vote, ROTC students
said that the University has been
supportive as they work to rebuild
the program, which included ap
proximately half the male student
population in its World War II hey
day.

According to Lopez, the Haas
Center pays for the ROTC cadets'
commute as part of the Military
Service as Public Service project.
Started in 2010, the initiative
takes care of Zip Car costs for the
group's trips to and from their
training locations, as well as other
activities for the military students,
including community-building
events and featured speaker ses
sions.

ROTC students are still hop
ing to improve several policies.
While the units have helped
cadets stay on track to graduate,
Stanford's unit cap can make
scheduling difficult.
"We have three mandatory
ROTC units, and the maximum
[for one quarter] at Stanford is on
ly 22 units," explained ROTC
cadet Lauren McCune 'l5. "That
makes it impossible for us to take
four five-unit classes. I tried for
about a year to change that, but
kept getting a flat-out no."
ROTC students also don't get
access to the benefits available to
student-athletes, despite the phys
ical nature of their training.
"We are like athletes, but we
don't get massage therapists, or
extra help and tutoring," said Kait
lyn Benitez-Strine 'l5, another

Army cadet. "I wish we got that. I
might push for that."
According to Joshua Schott
'l4, however, that is how it
should be.

"I think the military should
provide the proper physical thera
py resources to cadets," said
Schott, former president of Stan
ford Says No to War, one of cam
pus' prominent voices against the
ROTC's return. "That shouldn't
be the University's responsibility
and considering that the military
budget comprises half of the fed
eral budget... the military should
be able to care for the physical
health of its cadets."
Morales said that as the
ROTC works to rebuild its pres
ence at Stanford, it hopes to add
more on-campus programming.

"You know, there will always
be people that don't care for the
military, don't want to have any
thing to do with the military be
cause of what it represents, and
that's fine," Morales said. "But
there are definitely other students
who are interested in the military
and do want to understand what
the program is about, and that's
what we're there for."
