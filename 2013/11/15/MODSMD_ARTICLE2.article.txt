## ROTC stays the course Few changes since controversial return 
### DANIA MARINSHAW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two and a half years after the Faculty
Senate invited the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps (ROTC) back to campus
in a contentious vote, not much has
changed in the daily lives of ROTC stu
dents at Stanford. Cadets still have to
travel to surrounding campuses for the
majority of their training, but they are
now able to receive activity and academic
credits for their ROTC coursework.

For ROTC cadet Isabel Lopez 'l4,
the recognition from the University has
helped her feel more supported on cam
pus.

"Having the units is nice, but given
that there's a lot of ignorance on campus
about the military and ROTC, it's nice to
feel that someone is genuinely interest
ed and cares to help us out," Lopez said.
"Not that there's anything bad that hap
pens, but it's just nice to be recognized
like that."

The ROTC was formally invited back
to campus in April 2011 after more than
a year of contentious discussion during
which competing petitions circulated,
Condoleezza Rice and George Shultz
weighed in and an ad hoc committee was
formed to explore the issue.
Much of the controversy involved
the ban against transgender people serv
ing in the military as well as the limits
that the ROTC can put on academic ex
ploration. In a statement released follow
ing the Faculty Senate's vote, President
John Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 wrote that they
understood the concerns of discrimina
tion, "but if the leadership of the military
is drawn from communities that teach
and practice true tolerance, change is

more likely to occur."

Even before the vote, however, Stan
ford had a relationship with the ROTC
branches as students participated in the
program through other schools either
Santa Clara University, San Jose State
University or Berkeley, depending on the
service branch.

Because a full ROTC branch has still
not been established at Stanford, the
nine current ROTC cadets have to com
mute for much of their training.
Scott Calvert, senior administrator
in the Office of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education and retired Navy
officer, said that because of budget cuts,
the Department of Defense is not cur
rently looking to expand its capacity and
add ROTC branches.

"So, we kind of went to a plan B,"
Calvert explained, "and here's the thing
that changed: The other part was to rec
ognize the work that ROTC students
were doing and to give credit."
As of the 2012-13 school year,

cadets are able to receive one unit of ac
tivity credit each quarter and two units
of academic credit for each ROTC course
taken during their sophomore, junior and
senior years, but only with a grade of
Credit/No Credit. Cadets can apply these
units towards graduation under the same
guidelines as the general undergraduate
population.

"I wish I got academic credit it
would boost my GPA," Lopez said. "It's
not like they're joke classes. There are
comparable classes at Stanford."
The Army branch ROTC has also es
tablished an office in Sweet Hall, which
acts as home base for a handful of cadre
affiliated with the Stanford military com
munity. These captains teach a first-year
military science course on campus, and
more broadly serve as the point persons
for any ROTC-related student questions
or concerns. The office is useful, but "a
very underutilized resource," according

Day feature. Although the ROTC was invited back in 2011, it has yet to establish a full
branch on Stanford's campus, so cadets continue to commute to other schools.
