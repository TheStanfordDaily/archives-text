## "VIOLET" BUSES TO GLORY 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
Take a journey from North
Carolina to Tulsa, Okla.,
and wrestle with the com
plexity of human relation
ships, our obsession with
physical appearance and
the power of religion all while
on a Marguerite shuttle. For this
weekend only, At the Fountain
Theatricals presents the Stanford
community with "Violet: The
Musical," "the travel musical
that actually travels."
Set in the South in 1964,
"Violet" tells the story of a
woman whose face was scarred
by an axe wound when she was
just a child. Despising her ap
pearance and treated as an out
cast in her town, Violet (Arianna
Claire Vogel 'l4) travels cross
country to see a televangelist
preacher who she believes will
heal her. Along the way, she
meets two military men: the
sweet-talking Monty (Louis La
galante 'l5) and Flick (Robert
Poole 'l5), an African American
soldier. The trio's relationships
with one another develop
throughout the show, and the is
sues of beauty and identity that
Violet encounter remain
poignant and relevant even in to
day's world.
The show begins with the
boarding of Bus 322 in front of
Memorial Auditorium. But once
the shuttle takes off, it is easy to
forget the unconventional loca
tion of the performance and be
come enraptured in Violet's sto
ry. Moving seamlessly between
musical numbers and scenes, the
actors tell a story that pulls view
ers into the world of the South in
1964. Sitting side-by-side with
cast members places the audi-

ence directly into the show and, as a result,
watching "Violet" becomes an active, full
body experience of traveling, partying and
interacting with the characters them
selves.

Around the halfway point, the entire
show relocates to Toyon Hall, and, with
the exception of the final scene, the rest
of the musical moves between different ar
eas within the main hall. Even without
professional lighting or sound, the transi
tions between scenes worked nicely as the
audience follows the characters from room
to room, literally participating in a party or
sitting in a church service. Director Sammi
Cannold 'l6 has succeeded in her goal of
"communicatjing] to theatergoers that
they matter and are part of a greater social
fabric when they experience perform

ance."

The actors not only manage props and
perform choreography on a moving bus
but also maintain tremendous vocal bal
ance throughout the entire musical. In a
small space with many people and busy
streets as background noise, projection be
comes vital, and each singer can always be
heard. Songs involving the entire chorus
have immense power and impressive
blends for a small cast, and noteworthy
performances include duets between Vio
let and young Violet (Cayla Pettinato 'l6),
Poole's resounding rendition of "Let It
Sing" and Vogel's hauntingly beautiful "Lay
Down Your Head."

Overall, key choices regarding scene
elimination, stage direction and audience
interaction have allowed At Fountain The

atricals to transform "Violet: The Musical"
into an unparalleled theatrical perform
ance. Poole's and Vogel's standout perform
ances as Flick and Violet make the charac
ters even more relatable, and, with the in
timate environment formed among the au
dience and the characters, it is no surprise
that several scenes evoked tangible emo
tional responses from viewers. The hour
and-45-minute musical keeps the audience
on the edge of their seats or, in many cases,
on their toes.

"Violet: The Musical" explores impor
tant questions not only about our societal
values but also about the way we approach
theater. Audience members do not simply
watch "Violet"; they experience it.
