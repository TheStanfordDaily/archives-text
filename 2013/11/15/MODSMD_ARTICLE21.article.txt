## "Flesh" explores tech, humanity 
### GILLIE COLLINS 
Cantor's newest exhibit, "Flesh and Met
al: Body and Machine in Early 20th-cen
tury Art," explores the power of visual
art to examine, reveal and dissolve the
line between technology and humanity.
Organized jointly by SFMOMA and the
Cantor Art Center, the show features photos,
paintings, sculpture and video by a wide range
European and North American artists, includ
ing Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Giorgio de

industry, communication technology and urban
landscapes. Charles Sheeler, for instance, pro

ny's plant in River Rouge Michigan. In "Blast
Furnace and Dust Catcher" (1927), Sheeler fo
cuses his lens on the disorienting geometry of
factory. Rather than depicting familiar images
of Ford cars or assembly lines, Sheeler's work
captures the mystery and abstraction of the fac
tory's inner world.

While Sheeler's work explores the process
of manufacturing, the works of other photogra
phers, like Margaret Bourke-White, aestheticize
commercial products themselves. Bourke-
White's "Untitled (RCA Speakers)" (1935) com
plicates boundaries between fine arts and in
dustrial arts. Radio speakers look like seashells,
gleaming with precision. In directing viewers'
attentions to the distinct aesthetics of radio
