# Art Exhibit
## "Flesh" explores tech, humanity 
### GILLIE COLLINS 
Cantor's newest exhibit, "Flesh and Met
al: Body and Machine in Early 20th-cen
tury Art," explores the power of visual
art to examine, reveal and dissolve the
line between technology and humanity.
Organized jointly by SFMOMA and the
Cantor Art Center, the show features photos,
paintings, sculpture and video by a wide range
European and North American artists, includ
ing Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Giorgio de
Chirico, Man Ray and Alexander Rodchenko,
working between 1910 and 1950.

Though visual artists of the 20th century
are known for imagining clear-cut lines be
tween the dispassionate outer world of manu
facturing and humanity's internal emotional
turmoil, "Flesh and Metal" showcases artists
committed to more sophisticated analyses of in
dustrial society. The show raises more ques
tions than it answers, challenging viewers to re
think definitions of modernity and progress.
Many of the artists in "Flesh and Metal"
turn to the mechanical process of photography
to reflect and represent the new efficiency of
industry, communication technology and urban
landscapes. Charles Sheeler, for instance, pro
duced a 32-photo study of Ford Motor Compa
ny's plant in River Rouge Michigan. In "Blast
Furnace and Dust Catcher" (1927), Sheeler fo
cuses his lens on the disorienting geometry of
factory. Rather than depicting familiar images
of Ford cars or assembly lines, Sheeler's work
captures the mystery and abstraction of the fac
tory's inner world.

While Sheeler's work explores the process
of manufacturing, the works of other photogra
phers, like Margaret Bourke-White, aestheticize
commercial products themselves. Bourke-
White's "Untitled (RCA Speakers)" (1935) com
plicates boundaries between fine arts and in
dustrial arts. Radio speakers look like seashells,
gleaming with precision. In directing viewers'
attentions to the distinct aesthetics of radio
an audio experience Bourke-White helps us
visualize the supply chain behind household
commodities.

While some artists embrace and elaborate
the geometry of machine and capitalism, others
call attention to costs and complications. Marcel
Duchamp's "Box in a Suitcase" (1935-1941) is
a sample suitcase that doubles as mobile muse
um, showcasing small-scale replicas of Ducham
p's "readymades." Here, Duchamp calls on
viewers to consider the meaning of "authentic"
art objects in a world shaped by manufacturing
and consumerism.
The exhibit's second room showcases art
works responding to advances in architecture
and urban planning. An oil painting by Louis
Guiglielimi called "The Street" (1939) re
minds us that urban environments do not re
solve loneliness. Guiglielimi's cityscape is both
dizzying and unspeakably empty.

"Flesh and Metal" also includes several
metal-as-flesh sculptures, such as Jean (Hans)
Arp's mesmerizing "Human Concretion with
out Oval Bowl" (1933). It's hard to look away
from the sculpture's round, bronze surfaces.
On the one hand, the figures evoke a certain
coldness and industrial perfection; at the same
time, they feel corporeal. They want to be

touched.

"Flesh and Met
al" reflects past (and
present) cultural am
bivalence about the
impact of machinery
on the human psy
che. Whether cynical
or optimistic about
man-machine rela
tions, the show's
artists seem to agree
in their fundamental
observation that
technology does not
supplant human na
ture. Instead, their
work illuminates the
ways in which ma-

chines interact with our bodies, minds and
communities: There is no clear dichotomy be
tween "us" and the tools we use.

"Flesh and Metal" will be on display at
Stanford's Cantor Arts Center from Nov. 13,
2013-March 16, 2014.

of manufacturing, the works of other photogra
phers, like Margaret Bourke-White, aestheticize
commercial products themselves. Bourke-
White's "Untitled (RCA Speakers)" (1935) com
plicates boundaries between fine arts and in
dustrial arts. Radio speakers look like seashells,
gleaming with precision. In directing viewers'
attentions to the distinct aesthetics of radio
an audio experience Bourke-White helps us
visualize the supply chain behind household
commodities.

While some artists embrace and elaborate
the geometry of machine and capitalism, others
call attention to costs and complications. Marcel
Duchamp's "Box in a Suitcase" (1935-1941) is
a sample suitcase that doubles as mobile muse
um, showcasing small-scale replicas of Ducham
p's "readymades." Here, Duchamp calls on
viewers to consider the meaning of "authentic"
art objects in a world shaped by manufacturing
and consumerism.
The exhibit's second room showcases art
works responding to advances in architecture
and urban planning. An oil painting by Louis
Guiglielimi called "The Street" (1939) re
minds us that urban environments do not re
solve loneliness. Guiglielimi's cityscape is both
dizzying and unspeakably empty.

"Flesh and Metal" also includes several
metal-as-flesh sculptures, such as Jean (Hans)
Arp's mesmerizing "Human Concretion with
out Oval Bowl" (1933). It's hard to look away
from the sculpture's round, bronze surfaces.
On the one hand, the figures evoke a certain
coldness and industrial perfection; at the same
time, they feel corporeal. They want to be

touched.

"Flesh and Met
al" reflects past (and
present) cultural am
bivalence about the
impact of machinery
on the human psy
che. Whether cynical
or optimistic about
man-machine rela
tions, the show's
artists seem to agree
in their fundamental
observation that
technology does not
supplant human na
ture. Instead, their
work illuminates the
ways in which ma-

chines interact with our bodies, minds and
communities: There is no clear dichotomy be
tween "us" and the tools we use.

"Flesh and Metal" will be on display at
Stanford's Cantor Arts Center from Nov. 13,
2013-March 16, 2014.
