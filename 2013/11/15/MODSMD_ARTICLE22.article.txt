# FASHION ON THE FARM
## Top YouTube Beauty Vlogs 
### KEYA TEKLU FASHION COLUMNIST 
Columns and blogs are great
resources to utilize in the beauty
and fashion world. However, text
on a page can only go so far. The
beauty behind You Tube fashion
vlogs is that the vloggers can not

Beauty gurus like Michelle

interview or a more formal meet

is very useful if you're looking to

get me started on her personality.
She is the happiest, bubbliest and
most amusing guru in the business,
and that speaks a lot to the quality
of her videos. Who wants to view a
video, no matter how informative or
