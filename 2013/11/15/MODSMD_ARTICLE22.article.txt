# FASHION ON THE FARM
## Top YouTube Beauty Vlogs 
### KEYA TEKLU FASHION COLUMNIST 
Columns and blogs are great
resources to utilize in the beauty
and fashion world. However, text
on a page can only go so far. The
beauty behind You Tube fashion
vlogs is that the vloggers can not
just tell, but show their viewers
what they're trying to explain.
Beauty gurus like Michelle
Phan and Dulce Candy have been
around for ages. However, some
newer gurus have started using
You Tube as a platform to discuss
beauty and fashion, and they defi
nitely don't disappoint. You can
learn how to do just about any

thing from these lovely ladies, in
cluding how to do a fishtail braid
and how to pull off a monochro
matic look.

Because of the overwhelming
ly large number of beauty gurus
that post videos on You Tube, it
can be hard to find quality chan
nels. The following list will help
you figure out who the most
helpful digital gurus are:

1. Wendy's Lookbook (Sub
scribers: 479,307): This girl is
hands down the best fashion guru
on You Tube. That is not even my
opinion that is straight-up fact.
Her videos are a perfect storm of
high-quality video production value,

an extremely sophisticated fashion
sense and a wonderfully electric
personality. Wendy's style is super
relevant to the 20-something crowd
because most of her outfits are tai
lored to be business-professional/busi
ness-casual. If you are having trou
ble figuring out what to wear to an
interview or a more formal meet
ing, Wendy's Lookbook is the per
fect channel to check out. Also, she
is very useful if you're looking to
mature your closet. And don't even
get me started on her personality.
She is the happiest, bubbliest and
most amusing guru in the business,
and that speaks a lot to the quality
of her videos. Who wants to view a
video, no matter how informative or
useful, if the vlogger is boring? You tune in to
Wendy's channel for the content, but you
stay for the personality.

2. Zoella (Subscribers: 2,624,959) : This
guru has a massive online following, and for
good reason. Her fashion sense is super girly,
and her personality is even girlier. Her channel
is a combination of makeup, hair and fashion
videos, which makes her extremely versatile,
especially when compared to other You Tube
gurus. Gurus typically tend to stick to their
niches (either makeup, hair or fashion) and
rarely ever branch out into the other aspects of
beauty, but Zoella does it all, and she does it
well. Did I mention she's British? What's not to
love about this guru? Also, her British guy
friends tend to guest on her channel quite of
ten, so, if nothing else, you can subscribe to
Zoella to see (and, more importantly, hear)

beautiful men speaking in British accents.

3. Sprinkle of Glitter (Subscribers:
813,731): Sprinkle of Glitter, aka Louise, is
Zoella's best friend, but their styles could not
be more different. While Zoella tends to gravi
tate towards the girlier and younger-looking
outfits, Louise gravitates towards outfits that
are simple and sophisticated. She is also a great
channel for curvy girls, because many of her
videos focus specifically on curvy fashion
trends and lookbooks. In addition, she is ridicu
lously hilarious. I'm confident that if she had
not become a You Tube beauty guru, her back
up career would have been a comedian. She is
genuinely unlike any guru I've ever seen, be
cause her videos, even without fashion advice,
are still entertaining. If she created a channel
that had nothing to do with fashion, I would
still watch it, and it would be amazing. I can't
really say that about many other beauty gurus.

4. Patricia Bright (Subscribers: 318,349):
It can be hard to find a woman of color who
has a successful channel on You Tube, but look

no further than Patricia Bright. Her videos fo
cus on makeup and fashion, and while her
fashion videos are great for inspiration, her
makeup videos are what really set her apart.
Because she is darker skinned, she uses her
channel to recommend makeup products that
work well for women of color (and there are
surprisingly very few brands that cater to the
makeup needs of darker women). In fact, I per
sonally found it so difficult to shop for beauty
products until I stumbled upon her channel,
and it has totally changed which products I will
purchase. She is also really entertaining to
watch. Some of her videos are longer than 15
minutes, but its easy to stay fully engaged the
entire time.

5. Mimi Ikonn (Subscribers: 75,897): You
may know Mimi from her much more popular
channel, LuxyHair, which has over one million
subscribers, but her second channel, Mimi
Ikonn, is every bit as inspirational and useful.
This channel focuses on fashion (while Luxy-
Hair is more for hairstyle tutorials), and Mimi's
fashion is stunning, always on point. She also

likes to explain why a certain fashion trend or
piece looks good rather than just showing the
finished product. She really works with her au
dience to develop a more fine-tuned fashion
sense, and her video entitled "What Colors
Work for You" is a perfect example of this. In
this bit, she breaks down the process of dress
ing well step by step, starting with something
as simple as color choice, and working her way
up. This makes her ideal for beginners to the
fashion world. I cannot think of a better tour
guide into the fashion industry than Ikonn.

There are many more gurus who deserve
honorable mention, including Andrea's Choice
(great for DlY's), ItsJudyTime, MissGlamorazzi
and more. You Tube is an expansive place filled
with thousands and thousands of beauty gurus
with different styles and personalities, but the
ladies that I've listed embody, in my opinion,
the ideal beauty guru, in both fashion sense
and personality. Happy You Tube watching,
fellow fashionistas!
