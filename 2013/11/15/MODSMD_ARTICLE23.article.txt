# FASHION SPOTLIGHT
## No Pants November? 
### LAYNIE STEPHENS FASHION COLUMNIST 
Story time this week I'll
tell you what my fashion has
been up to. Based off the ti
tle, you might have guessed:
I'm in the middle of a pants
protest. Now, I do remem
ber wearing pants about a week
ago, so maybe it's not entirely No
Pants November, but wearing pants
has definitely been a rarity lately.
Why, you might ask? Although

I could go on about this for hours,
I'll keep it concise. They're uncom
fortable, restricting and frankly, just
plain boring. I got to a point where
I felt like every day I was wearing
some style of black, slim-leg pants,
with a different shirt and maybe
different shoes. That is when I real
ized my style was becoming static.
The solution? Eliminate the prob
lem: pants!

I'll make it clear that I have
nothing against pants. However,
there are so many more options out

there, and we're going to explore
those now.

First, I'll state the obvious: If
you're not wearing pants, you're
probably wearing shorts, a skirt or
a dress. "But it's almost winter!
How can I wear those and survive

the oh-so-cold California nights?"
I'm only partially kidding here; I
do think it gets cold in the morn
ings and nights, and the usual Cal
ifornia attire isn't warm enough.
The single most important article
of clothing you need to solve this

problem: tights.
I currently couldn't be more in
love with tights. They're comfort
able and basically leg hugs for the
entire day whenever you wear

them. Could it get any better? Yes,
it could. Besides the functionality
of wearing them to stay warm, they
have the added bonus of instantly
making your outfit look more put


KEYA TEKLU/The Stanford Daily
together. They're just that little extra some
thing that shows you put a little effort into
your look of the day.
The options are endless when it comes
to tights there are sheer ones, opaque
ones, patterned ones and even colored ones.
My current favorites are opaque black ones,
but maybe that's just because I'm in a black
clothing phase. Regardless, I definitely rec
ommend investing in colored tights as well,
because they're a fun way to accentuate any
outfit. Not sure where to find your desired
color of tights? Go to Target I've seen al
most any color imaginable there.
Complete your winter-styled outfit with
a bulky cardigan and scarf and talk about
being fashionable. Just remember, ladies:
The fact that you put on a scarf doesn't mag
ically make your outfit fashionable in the
same way that just putting on any one article
of clothing doesn't make an outfit. The act of

putting together an outfit by combining dif
ferent articles and elements of clothing is
what makes you in the running for the most
stylish of us all.
Let's review: Pants are great, but they
get old fast. Basically, it's much harder to
have a diverse style when you're wearing
some form of jeans with those same old
sneakers and same old t-shirt every day (look
ing at you, stereotypical Stanford student).
On the other hand, think about wearing a
dress one day, shorts another and a skirt yet
another all with a different pair of tights,
scarf and outerwear. The potential outfits
hiding in your closet just quadrupled
thank me later once people stop calling you
an outfit repeater, arguably the harshest in
sult of them all.

Weekly challenge: Does anyone want to
join me in No Pants November? Alternative
ly, just take this as a challenge to think about
what you're wearing every day, and try to di
versify your wardrobe!
