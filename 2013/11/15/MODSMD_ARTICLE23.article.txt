# FASHION SPOTLIGHT
## No Pants November? 
### LAYNIE STEPHENS FASHION COLUMNIST 
Story time this week I'll
tell you what my fashion has
been up to. Based off the ti
tle, you might have guessed:
I'm in the middle of a pants
protest. Now, I do remem
ber wearing pants about a week
ago, so maybe it's not entirely No
Pants November, but wearing pants
has definitely been a rarity lately.
Why, you might ask? Although

I could go on about this for hours,
I'll keep it concise. They're uncom
fortable, restricting and frankly, just
plain boring. I got to a point where
I felt like every day I was wearing
some style of black, slim-leg pants,
with a different shirt and maybe
different shoes. That is when I real
ized my style was becoming static.
The solution? Eliminate the prob
lem: pants!

I'll make it clear that I have
nothing against pants. However,
there are so many more options out

there, and we're going to explore
those now.

First, I'll state the obvious: If
you're not wearing pants, you're
probably wearing shorts, a skirt or
a dress. "But it's almost winter!
How can I wear those and survive

the oh-so-cold California nights?"
I'm only partially kidding here; I
do think it gets cold in the morn
ings and nights, and the usual Cal
ifornia attire isn't warm enough.
The single most important article
of clothing you need to solve this

problem: tights.
I currently couldn't be more in
love with tights. They're comfort
able and basically leg hugs for the
entire day whenever you wear

them. Could it get any better? Yes,
it could. Besides the functionality
of wearing them to stay warm, they
have the added bonus of instantly
making your outfit look more put
