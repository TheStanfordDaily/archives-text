## Class assesses art of body 
### YVETTE DICKSON-TETTEH 
I have often wondered why more
artists don't use their own body in the
transmission of their ideas, their thoughts
and, indeed, of themselves. The body
strikes me as an important medium for
moving from and beyond the individual
experience to a realm of complex art that
can engage other people meaningfully.
Perhaps, I thought, there has to be some
native (yet often elusive) intimacy with
the body to see it in its many identities as
the hand, the paintbrush and the paint
ing. All artists of course must use their
body in some way dancers particularly
are renowned for their mastery of the
body and of movement. But to take the
body outside of the recognizable classic
art forms in the performance of life and
ideas has long been considered a peripher
al activity.
In this quarter's class, Dance 67: Be
ing S(c)ene: Dance, Fashion and Art as Ex
hibition, we have brought the periphery
to the center. We have in fact decorated
the center with many elements of the pe
riphery. We have centralized the body as
its own piece of art situated among
and in productive dialogue with other
famous and familiar art works. We have
centralized ourselves as present and ac
tive. We have set ourselves in the space
of the museum to see and be seen. And
how wonderful it has been to establish
ourselves at home in the museum and at
home in the self!

We have not been practicing an op
positional art; indeed, the desire has
been to be comfortable in an imposing
space. The process has been hugely im
portant in and of itself and has happily
drawn upon dance and theatre and liter
ature. The artist Carrie Mae Weems, a
retrospective of whose work is currently
on display at the Cantor Arts Center,
specifically has been a fantastic inspira
tion for our process and our work, too.
The striking and informative presence of
herself in her work, and her ability to dis
course beyond and yet incorporate mi
nority experience, has been a guiding ex-

ample.

We have been in dialogue, and the
overwhelming attendance to our installa
tion showed that other people are inter
ested in the conversation. To have people
present finally â€”in what had be
come a home, after so much work within
our group, was an arresting and affirming
experience. Their presence helped me
realize that our art hadn't been complete
until they arrived. By walking into the
museum space we had claimed as our
creative space, they immediately became
a part of the picture as was our hope.
And I hope that the art in place was im
bued by our presence in the museum as
performers/spectators, that the art came
alive to everyone as dynamic, rather than
static, objects of our seeing.
And, in the words of a friend, "Per
haps it's possible too that the audience
felt themselves as performers, on a stage,
in a dialogue with themselves, the art and
others who have walked through the
space, rather than just as people sliding
through empty space with things on the
wall." I hope so. In an unsurprising way, I
realized I had been waiting for their spec
tatorship: The audience participants look
ing meant that there was something there
to be seen. That was great. I really felt it:
what it is to perform in oneself, to others,
in a complicated but essential way.
For me, it was and is about commu
nicating with others and with myself. I
come away from the process and the per
formance knowing that you can commu
nicate intelligently using yourself in per
formance art. That you can learn from
embodied art an assuredness of the self
that informs positively your communica
tions in the world. That you can be in
volved with the self in away that is not
self-involved. (Not like Jay Z.) The body is
already such a complicated and much un
defined site; how irresistible I find the en
deavor of delving into it, working it and
projecting with intention and agency what
I find and create there.
