# Banquet highlights Veterans Day events
## Founder of non-profit for vets speaks at Clark Center 
### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford commemorated Veterans Day
with a series of small events highlighted by
the 2013 Veterans Day Dinner at the Clark
Center on Monday night.
"[Veterans Day] is not typically a day that
[veterans] have big events on usually peo
ple who are not military, but have a family
member in the military, are the ones that typ
ically organize events," explained Zachary
Scheel MBA 'l3 M.S. 'l4, who participated
in the ROTC at Duke University and was a
Navy Ensign. "It's kind of a weird day for us,
because every day is Veterans Day for us, es
sentially. You never really stop being a veter
an of the Armed Services."

Matthew Colford 'l4, who helps lead
campus veteran outreach through the Haas
Center, said that like in previous years, a ban
quet was organized for Veterans Day. The
event was open to all members of the Stan
ford community.
"By virtue of the fact that we don't have
an on-campus ROTC program," Colford said,
"we sent out an announcement about a Vet
erans Day banquet, inviting everyone from
the community to come to meet veterans."
The speaker at this year's dinner was
Mary Cortani, the founder of Operation
Freedom Paws, a non-profit that trains veter
ans and others with disabilities to train their
own service dogs, and certifies the pair as a
"service dog team." Cortani is a veteran her
self.

Colford said that he would like to see a
higher attendance than the approximately 45
people who came to the event.
"Oftentimes it is preaching to the choir

the people who come to these events are
those that are a priori supportive of the vet
erans," Colford said. "I think that the main
area for improvement would just be increas
ing awareness of the significance of Veterans
Day on campus. I think that a lot of students
assume that if they are not veterans, there is
no reason for them to celebrate."

The University's commemoration of Vet

erans Day also included events by individual
veterans organizations, such as that of the
Stanford Law School and the Graduate
School of Business. The Stanford Historical
Society hosted a talk by David Kennedy,
emeritus professor of history, about Stan
ford's tangled past with the ROTC.
The University continued to hold classes
and activities throughout the day, similar to

senice dogs and veterans.
other private institutions such as
Princeton and Yale. Harvard holds
classes but closes administrative
buildings but Berkeley a public
school considers the day an aca
demic and administrative holiday.

Scheel said that since he has
never worked in the private sector,
he has usually had the day off, but
added that Stanford didn't need to
take the day off to recognize veter
ans.

"It's less about the one day,
and more about integration of the
military community with the Stan
ford community as a whole,"
Scheel said.

He added that he thought that
efforts could be focused on inte

grating the military with the rest of
the community rather than having
it stand out more one day of the
year.

"At the Business School, for
example, we have done a good job
of holding events jointly with other
affinity groups," Scheel said. "For
example, we brought in to speak
the only openly gay sailor who was
allowed to stay on active duty after
coming out during 'don't-ask-don't
tell.'"

Scheel said that last week, he
attended a Marine Corps birthday
cake-cutting ceremony at the
Hoover Institution.
"It's events like that that I
wish the broader community was
more involved in and had more vis
ibility of, to share that kind of tradi
tion, what we hold dear as veter
ans," he said.

Colford said that awareness

was important to building mutual
understanding between the cam
pus community and the military.
"I think that there are people
in the activist community who
wrongly associate the policies of
the military with individual veter
ans or service members them
selves," Colford said. "There is a
failure to dissociate in their minds
the difference between the policy
makers and the veterans them
selves. "

"There were a lot of questions
about veterans I had coming to
Stanford, which I hope other stu
dents had, and one of the goals of
the program is to expose students
to the military as a form of public
service."

added that Stanford didn't need to
take the day off to recognize veter
ans.

"It's less about the one day,
and more about integration of the
military community with the Stan
ford community as a whole,"
Scheel said.

He added that he thought that
efforts could be focused on inte

grating the military with the rest of
the community rather than having
it stand out more one day of the
year.

"At the Business School, for
example, we have done a good job
of holding events jointly with other
affinity groups," Scheel said. "For
example, we brought in to speak
the only openly gay sailor who was
allowed to stay on active duty after
coming out during 'don't-ask-don't
tell.'"

Scheel said that last week, he
attended a Marine Corps birthday
cake-cutting ceremony at the
Hoover Institution.
"It's events like that that I
wish the broader community was
more involved in and had more vis
ibility of, to share that kind of tradi
tion, what we hold dear as veter
ans," he said.

Colford said that awareness

was important to building mutual
understanding between the cam
pus community and the military.
"I think that there are people
in the activist community who
wrongly associate the policies of
the military with individual veter
ans or service members them
selves," Colford said. "There is a
failure to dissociate in their minds
the difference between the policy
makers and the veterans them
selves. "

"There were a lot of questions
about veterans I had coming to
Stanford, which I hope other stu
dents had, and one of the goals of
the program is to expose students
to the military as a form of public
service."

Approximately 45 people attended a dinner to commemorate Veterans Day on Monday at the Clark Center. The
event was hosted by the veterans organizations of the Stanford law and business schools and the Haas Center.
Stanford commemorated Veterans Day
with a series of small events highlighted by
the 2013 Veterans Day Dinner at the Clark
Center on Monday night.
"[Veterans Day] is not typically a day that
[veterans] have big events on usually peo
ple who are not military, but have a family
member in the military, are the ones that typ
ically organize events," explained Zachary
Scheel MBA 'l3 M.S. 'l4, who participated
in the ROTC at Duke University and was a
Navy Ensign. "It's kind of a weird day for us,
because every day is Veterans Day for us, es
sentially. You never really stop being a veter
an of the Armed Services."

Matthew Colford 'l4, who helps lead
campus veteran outreach through the Haas
Center, said that like in previous years, a ban
quet was organized for Veterans Day. The
event was open to all members of the Stan
ford community.
"By virtue of the fact that we don't have
an on-campus ROTC program," Colford said,
"we sent out an announcement about a Vet
erans Day banquet, inviting everyone from
the community to come to meet veterans."
The speaker at this year's dinner was
Mary Cortani, the founder of Operation
Freedom Paws, a non-profit that trains veter
ans and others with disabilities to train their
own service dogs, and certifies the pair as a
"service dog team." Cortani is a veteran her
self.

Colford said that he would like to see a
higher attendance than the approximately 45
people who came to the event.
"Oftentimes it is preaching to the choir

the people who come to these events are
those that are a priori supportive of the vet
erans," Colford said. "I think that the main
area for improvement would just be increas
ing awareness of the significance of Veterans
Day on campus. I think that a lot of students
assume that if they are not veterans, there is
no reason for them to celebrate."

The University's commemoration of Vet

erans Day also included events by individual
veterans organizations, such as that of the
Stanford Law School and the Graduate
School of Business. The Stanford Historical
Society hosted a talk by David Kennedy,
emeritus professor of history, about Stan
ford's tangled past with the ROTC.
The University continued to hold classes
and activities throughout the day, similar to

other private institutions such as
Princeton and Yale. Harvard holds
classes but closes administrative
buildings but Berkeley a public
school considers the day an aca
demic and administrative holiday.

Scheel said that since he has
never worked in the private sector,
he has usually had the day off, but
added that Stanford didn't need to
take the day off to recognize veter
ans.
