### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford commemorated Veterans Day
with a series of small events highlighted by
the 2013 Veterans Day Dinner at the Clark
Center on Monday night.
"[Veterans Day] is not typically a day that
[veterans] have big events on usually peo
ple who are not military, but have a family
member in the military, are the ones that typ
ically organize events," explained Zachary
Scheel MBA 'l3 M.S. 'l4, who participated
in the ROTC at Duke University and was a
Navy Ensign. "It's kind of a weird day for us,
because every day is Veterans Day for us, es
sentially. You never really stop being a veter
an of the Armed Services."

Matthew Colford 'l4, who helps lead
campus veteran outreach through the Haas
Center, said that like in previous years, a ban
quet was organized for Veterans Day. The
event was open to all members of the Stan
ford community.
"By virtue of the fact that we don't have
an on-campus ROTC program," Colford said,
"we sent out an announcement about a Vet
erans Day banquet, inviting everyone from
the community to come to meet veterans."
The speaker at this year's dinner was
Mary Cortani, the founder of Operation
Freedom Paws, a non-profit that trains veter
ans and others with disabilities to train their
own service dogs, and certifies the pair as a
"service dog team." Cortani is a veteran her
self.

Colford said that he would like to see a
higher attendance than the approximately 45
people who came to the event.
"Oftentimes it is preaching to the choir

the people who come to these events are
those that are a priori supportive of the vet
erans," Colford said. "I think that the main
area for improvement would just be increas
ing awareness of the significance of Veterans
Day on campus. I think that a lot of students
assume that if they are not veterans, there is
no reason for them to celebrate."

The University's commemoration of Vet

erans Day also included events by individual
veterans organizations, such as that of the
Stanford Law School and the Graduate
School of Business. The Stanford Historical
Society hosted a talk by David Kennedy,
emeritus professor of history, about Stan
ford's tangled past with the ROTC.
The University continued to hold classes
and activities throughout the day, similar to
