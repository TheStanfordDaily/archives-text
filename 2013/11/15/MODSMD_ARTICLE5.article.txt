# Bridging the divide
## Vets talk about the civil-military gap 
### LINDSAY FUNK 
In honor of Veterans Day,
Pulitzer Prize-winning historian
and Stanford professor David
Kennedy '63 spoke on Monday
about the danger posed by the
widening gap between civilians and
the military in the United States.
At the event, which was held
at the Clark Center and sponsored
by the Stanford Historical Society,
Kennedy identified the 1970s cre
ation of an all-volunteer military
force as a turning point in civilian
military relations.
"This is not your daddy's or
your granddaddy's army," he said.
"We are in a very, very different sit
uation [today] with regard to who
serves, with regard to the missions
they are asked to take."
According to Kennedy, a report
commissioned by President Nixon
in the 1970s presciently identified
several of the challenges that
would be faced by an all-volunteer
military force, including alienation
of the military from society, over
representation of low-income
Americans in the military and a de
cline in American concern about
foreign policy.
"All of [the report's] criticisms,
it seems, have substantially come
to pass," he said, noting that the
amount of overseas deployments
has more than quadrupled since
the transition to an all-volunteer
force.

In contrast to Kennedy's re
marks, interviews with three
Hoover National Security Affairs
Fellows senior military officers
doing a yearlong research fellow
ship at Stanford painted a more
positive picture of the all-volunteer

military force and civilian-military
relations.

"Pretty much all of us who
were in the all-volunteer force are
absolutely committed to it and
completely against any mention of
the word 'draft,'" said current
Hoover Fellow Lieutenant Colonel
Matthew Atkins of the United
States Air Force. "From a military
discipline and motivation side, hav
ing an all-volunteer force is just fan
tastic."

Lieutenant Colonel Brant Eg
gers of the United States Marine
Corps, also a Fellow, echoed
Atkins' comments, adding that in
an all-volunteer force, "we have
people who want to be there; we
have people who serve there be
cause they've made a decision."
At the same time, the Hoover
Fellows shared several of
Kennedy's concerns about the
growing civilian-military divide.

"I think the all-volunteer force
is a great thing. Do I have concerns
behind the makeup of the all-volun
teer force? I do, a little bit," Eggers
said. "I think we have to do a better
job educating the civilian world
that... we're no different than the
civilian world; we just wear this
camouflage uniform and we go to
war if the country calls on us."
Another Fellow, Lieutenant
Colonel Roy Collins of the United
States Air Force often shares his
military experiences with the stu
dents in his classes here at Stan
ford. Fellows are permitted to audit
courses, giving them an opportuni

ty to interact directly with students
and professors in an academic envi
ronment.

"The students in both of [the
classes I am auditing] have no mili
tary affiliations, none whatsoever.
They don't know anyone in the mil
itary [and] they don't know any
thing about the military," said
Collins. "It's been a very good ex
change ... just talking to them
about what we do [and] why we do
it."

While these academic ex
changes are a valuable opportunity
to bridge the civilian-military di
vide, their necessity highlights the
size of the gap between the civilian
and military communities.
Kennedy noted that in meet
ings with ROTC cadets, he was re
peatedly asked, "Professor
Kennedy, can you explain to us
how it is that the army is at war and
the country is not?"
Atkins recalled Kennedy's re
marks in his interview, stating that "on
one level, of course, you agree with
that because you come home from
Kabul and you go to Best Buy and it's
like there's no war happening."

"The other side of the coin is
that it's probably OK on a very
deep level that our country is not
in a state of wartime footing, that
the terrorists did not achieve their
objectives and that people are get
ting on with their lives," Atkins
added.

Kennedy theorized that a

growing civilian-military gap actually
increases public respect and grati
tude for the military.
"The military institution is the
only institution in our society that
commands more popular respect to
day than it did, for example, in the
Vietnam era," he said.
All three Fellows agreed that
they've been treated with respect
here at Stanford, describing over
whelmingly positive experiences on
the Farm and praising the culture of
open academic discussion.

Atkins described his time here

as "a tremendous opportunity," say
ing that the fellowship "allows you
to explore disruptive thinking, so
you're not completely channeled in
the very linear military method of
approaching problem solving."

Collins shared anecdotes of sim
ply walking into the offices of other
Hoover affiliates and having lengthy
conversations about topics from eco
nomics to international relations.

"We're not even through one
quarter of our time here and I feel I've
gained so much just by being on this
campus and walking these hallways [at
Hoover]," he said. "I think it's making
me an even better officer."
