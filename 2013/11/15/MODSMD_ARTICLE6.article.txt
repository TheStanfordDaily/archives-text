# VA office provides services for vets
## Weekly office hours held at Tresidder 
### SOFIA FILIPPA 
Stanford's Student Servic
es Center opened the Student
Veteran Affairs (VA) Office last
spring to better provide Univer
sity resources for students affil
iated with the military.
The VA office, which was
created in collaboration with
the Office of the University
Registrar and the Financial Aid
Office, helps students obtain
their veteran and chapter bene
fits, and also provides guidance
regarding tuition and certifica
tion procedures. Following the
principles of excellence estab
lished in an executive order
signed last April, the office's
trained staff also provides face
to-face assistance, which has
shown promising results.
According to Lori Gager, as
sociate director of the Student
Services Center, the office pro
vides assistance to around 89
students throughout the quarter.
Many students find out
about the VA office through
word of mouth, but Jeanette
Hoggatt, a student services spe
cialist, emphasized the office's
online presence on its own
website and that of the Finan
cial Aid Office and the Regis
trar.

Steve Skentzos Ph.D. 'l7,
who served in the Navy as a
submarine nuclear reactor oper
ator, said that the office has
been helpful in solving issues
that have persisted for student
veterans in the past.
"It's been good that the of
fice has been formed within
Student Services because be
fore, it was pretty unorganized
[and] nobody ever seemed to

know what was going on," said
Skentzos, a second-year psy
chology graduate student.
Despite the improvement,
Skentzos said there is still room
for improvement.

"There were a couple
forms that I needed to fill out
that nobody really told me
about until months later,"
Skentzos said. "I ended up get
ting my money like a quarter
late."

Currently, office hours
specifically for veterans are
available every Tuesday from 10
a.m. to 12 p.m., and the SSE of
fers general office hours
throughout the week.
"We don't exclude seeing
veterans anytime they come to
the SSE," Gager said. "We just
happen to have the office open
for their specific questions on
Tuesdays."
Plans for improvement and
expanding of the program are
underway. Gager explained that
the VA staff is currently collabo
rating with a group of people
appointed by the Vice Provost
of Student Affairs.

"The hope is that the office
would be expanded to include a
permanent staffing to do the
certification and all of the bene
fits of coordination and admin
istration with the Department
of Veterans Affairs," Gager said.
Other objectives include
adding staff involved in coordi
nating the program's outreach
and connections and expanding
office hours specific to student
veterans. Gager also explained
that not all students receiving
benefits are student veterans

some are active military,
ROTC or dependents. There
fore, creating a sense of belong
ing in the military-affiliated com
munity is a paramount goal of VA.
However, funding is still a
challenge that VA office faces in or
der to be able to pursue all of its
developmental changes. The office
has recently been issued a grant by
the Stanford Affiliation Group, a
promising start in its pursuit for
development.
"The most important thing is
that we need the resources and
the staffing to be able to coordi
nate the services and programs
that we want to do for this very
special audience," Gager said.
