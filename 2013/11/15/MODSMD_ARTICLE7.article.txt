# Vouchers for Veterans

Today more veterans than ever
return home facing physical and
psychological challenges. Ac
cording to a recent study, nearly one
in five veterans suffers from stress
or depression-related disorders. Psy
chiatrists also project that as many as
a third of U.S. soldiers will suffer
from PTSD after serving in Iraq or
Afghanistan, and this rate doubles
for those who have served two tours.

Approximately 20 percent of
veterans are estimated to turn to sig
nificant drug or alcohol use upon
their return home, and even more
troubling, an average of 22 veterans
commit suicide every day.
According to the 2012 Federal
Budget, of the $683.7 billion spent
on the military, roughly 20 percent
of this, or $129 billion, is spent on
veteran affairs. This is not an insignif
icant amount, especially considering
that this is significantly more (read:
double) than the Department of
Flomeland Security received, and on
ly slightly less than the Department
of Agriculture received.
Why, then, do so many claim
that our veterans are being neglect
ed? It is because, as is usually the
case, the government fails to allocate

resources effectively. And instead of
relying on the free market to in
crease the quality of care given to
veterans, it insists on using funds to
run government programs and VA
hospitals, both of which are less ef
fective than other private charities
and organizations.
Despite the fact that VA hospi
tals are sometimes more cost effec
tive than private hospitals, they often
lack sufficient standards for cleanli
ness, and there are far too many in
stances of lack of protocol exposing
patients to undue risk.
For example, over the course of
the past decade, there have been nu

Psychiatrists project
that as many as a
third of U.S. soldiers
will suffer from
PTSD after serving.
