# Vouchers for Veterans

Today more veterans than ever
return home facing physical and
psychological challenges. Ac
cording to a recent study, nearly one
in five veterans suffers from stress
or depression-related disorders. Psy
chiatrists also project that as many as
a third of U.S. soldiers will suffer
from PTSD after serving in Iraq or
Afghanistan, and this rate doubles
for those who have served two tours.

Approximately 20 percent of
veterans are estimated to turn to sig
nificant drug or alcohol use upon
their return home, and even more
troubling, an average of 22 veterans
commit suicide every day.
According to the 2012 Federal
Budget, of the $683.7 billion spent
on the military, roughly 20 percent
of this, or $129 billion, is spent on
veteran affairs. This is not an insignif
icant amount, especially considering
that this is significantly more (read:
double) than the Department of
Flomeland Security received, and on
ly slightly less than the Department
of Agriculture received.
Why, then, do so many claim
that our veterans are being neglect
ed? It is because, as is usually the
case, the government fails to allocate

resources effectively. And instead of
relying on the free market to in
crease the quality of care given to
veterans, it insists on using funds to
run government programs and VA
hospitals, both of which are less ef
fective than other private charities
and organizations.
Despite the fact that VA hospi
tals are sometimes more cost effec
tive than private hospitals, they often
lack sufficient standards for cleanli
ness, and there are far too many in
stances of lack of protocol exposing
patients to undue risk.
For example, over the course of
the past decade, there have been nu

merous HIV and hepatitis scares
due to improper sterilization. Over
10,000 patients have been notified
of potential exposure to these dis
eases, and of those tested, six were
infected with HIY and another 40
with varying forms of hepatitis.
Most troubling, not one per
son lost his or her job over these
scandals. Thus, there is little incen
tive to quickly resolve these en
demic issues. Dissolving the VA

hospital system in favor of vouch
ers for private care is definitely a vi
able option and one heavily consid
ered in the 1990s when VA care
was at its most abysmal.
While this option is economi
cally attractive due to the added
stimulus it would provide to the pri
vate health care system, this is likely
to be met with near-fatal levels of re
sistance. At the very least the gov
ernment must enforce far stricter
standards on its VA hospitals in or
der to provide optimal care.
An even more important issue
to consider is the allocation of fund
ing to ancillary programs. The oper

ating costs for running programs to
help veterans reintegrate into socie
ty are undeniably high, and I believe
the government could better ad
dress veterans' needs by partially
shifting its focus towards compre
hensive programs that address long
term well-being.
The best way to invest in veter
ans' futures in America would be by
dissolving existing non-medical pro
grams that have marginal rates of
success in favor of private organiza
tions that have high rates of satisfac
tion. One such program is The
Wounded Warrior Project, a founda
tion that seeks to help injured veter

ans rehabilitate physically, adapt to
an often greatly changed lifestyle
and find roles within their commu
nities.

Community service has proven
to be an extremely effective way to
help minimize the problems veter
ans often experience upon return
ing home. One service program,
called The Mission Continues, gives
fellowships to veterans to pursue
six-month service projects in Amer
ican communities. The program has
been met with enormous success;
among participants polled before
and after their fellowships, depres
sion rates dropped, job performance

and family life improved, and 78
percent of veterans felt stronger at
tachment to their communities.

In order to address the long
term needs of veterans rather than
merely addressing the symptoms of
mental illness, the federal govern
ment needs to either support or de
velop programs like these and con
tinue to reform the VA system. In
the words of Albert Einstein, "Insan
ity is doing the same thing over and
over and expecting different re
sults."
