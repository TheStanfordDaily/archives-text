## Conversational Jerks 
### Chi Ling Chan 
A friend called me up one evening, barely conceal
ing Ms exasperation. "I screwed up my presenta
tion in class," he confided disappointedly. "No one
was even listening." He had stayed up all night to prepare
for Ms presentation, and went into that morning eager to
test Ms ideas.

When he finally got to the speaker's stand, he found
himself before a dozen students whose faces were hid
den behind laptops, and whose thumbs were too busy
skating on the black mirrors of smartphones.
It is a disconcerting time to be standing before
any audience. Today's speakers from the most es
teemed lecturers to students nervously delivering
their maiden speeches can no longer expect at
tention from the audience as a given. We live in a
technological universe in which we are always con
nected, always communicating, shifting between
conversations offline and a dozen conversations si
multaneously happening online. For better or for
worse, it has never been easier to tune out of a con
versation.

A deafening silence hangs over classrooms as
the virtual space clutters with chatter. We are sitting
in the audience, our minds wandering about like busy
bees taking technological sips in the virtual flowerbed as
the speaker's voice eases into a comfortable white noise
in the background. Occasionally we look up and afford
him a moment of attention, judging within that few sec
onds if he is worthy of continued attention, and at the
slightest pause or stutter we switch our focus else
where.

Technology has made it possible to customize our
lives: In between pauses we send emails, run online er
rands and browse Reddit. Life is too short to waste a mo
ment on a boring conversation technology is liber
ating; it gives us the control we want over our every sec
ond of our lives.

Well, yes, except that might also have made you a
conversational jerk. There are times when tuning out
behind gadgets can be rude. Ever been to a party where
you're talking to somebody who's looking over your
shoulder, or just when you're about deliver your
punch line lets a third person jump in on the con
versation? Essentially you are doing the same thing, ex
cept from behind your device.

You could be hurting your friend, who expects no
more than basic courtesy or a nod of affirmation from
you at some point in his delivery. The laptop screen can
feel like Harry Potter's invisible cloak, but it isn't: Your
uninterested face is in full view, signaling your ab
sence.

Then again, should we kid ourselves that we have

someone's attention just because they are looking in
our direction, and their thumbs are still? I will admit that
I am not the best listener in the world: There are times
when I accidentally space out, when I am too sleep-de
prived to pay full attention, as much as I want to.
And, on some occasions, an overt sign of inatten
tiveness can be a protest against power, a deliberate sig
nal to a speaker to please just stop talking. Maybe tech
nology just offered us a more polite way to tell some
body "you're boring" than ostentatiously reading a
book or stomping out of the classroom. Not to mention
the fact that it is quite an effective remedy against the
Zzz monster on a sleep-deprived morning.
Which is why, for all my frustration with technolo
gy, I couldn't quite make up my mind. If respect must
be earned, then perhaps attention should be too. Can
we blame people for tuning out if the speaker didn't put
in any effort to engage? When does that become disre
spectful and make us conversation jerks?
Some teachers have resorted to phone stacks, or
imposed a no-laptop rule because studies have found in
class multitasking to be distracting for other students. I
am not a fan of overly restrictive rules, simply because I
think there is too much diversity in circumstances for
general dos and don'ts to be useful.
But here's an experiment I did over the past few
months: I have gone back to the old-school way of taking
notes in class with pen and paper, resisting the tempta
tion to pull out my laptop or phone, even during mo
ments of boredom. It has worked out great so far,
though, as with anything, you lose some and you win
some.

The downside is that I can't Google questions I
have on the spot and have to leave them until after class.
The upside? I am talcing better notes, drawing more con
nections in lectures, and learning what makes a presen
tation boring so I know to avoid those pitfalls. Above all
1 have become more patient, to learn to appreciate the
unedited moments moments in which a speaker
stutters or goes silent, and reveals himself in away that
would have gone unnoticed had I shifted my attention
elsewhere.

There is no cut-and-dry rule one can rely on it
is something that requires constant experimenting, good
judgment and sensitivity to expectations in different sit
uations. My only hope is that we figure out what works
best for ourselves, making conscious, deliberate choices
that also consider how it affects people around us. In oth
er words, think before you toggle and switch. Some con
versations are worth your undivided attention.
