# TROJAN WAR
## Card looks to win fourth straight at SC

The Bradford lob. The Luck pick-six. The
Nunes scramble.

Few rivalries in the last six years of college
football have been as thrilling as the rivalry be
tween Stanford and USC. From a historic upset
to a triple-overtime thriller to a memorable
postgame exchange at midfield, Stanford-USC
has seen it all.

Though No. 4 Stanford (8-1, 6-1 Pac-12) has
dominated the series lately by taking five out of
the last six contests and winning three in a row
at the Coliseum, the last three games between
the two teams have been decided by eight points
or fewer.

So it only seems fitting that after beating
Oregon in one of the biggest wins in school his
tory, the Cardinal's biggest roadblock to its sec
ond straight Pac-12 North title is a battle with
the Trojans (7-3, 4-2) a battle that will be
played out tomorrow night in front of a sold-out
Coliseum crowd and attended by ESPN's Col
lege Game Day crew. The storyline has complete
ly flipped from what it was just six years ago: A
Stanford team with everything to lose hopes to
avoid a letdown against a USC team with noth
ing to lose.

Even amidst the pressure, the Cardinal
wouldn't have it any other way.
"It's going to be exciting," said head coach
David Shaw. "The crowd will be into it. This is a
big game for both teams in respect to where we
are in the conference. You go down there and
expect everything. You expect it to be wild and
crazy, and you expect it to come down to the
end of the game."
"[USC] always just seems to play a really
good game against us," added senior defensive
end Henry Anderson.
Earlier in the season, the Men of Troy under
Lane Kiffin seemed to be headed toward disaster
after losing to Washington State at home and
getting pummeled by Arizona State in the
desert. But after USC athletic director Pat Haden

Fifth-year senior offensive guard Kevin Danser (above) and the Cardinal offensive line
have pounded opposing defenses as of late. Their presence in the power run game
has played a big part in Stanford's offensive resurgence over the past few weeks.
