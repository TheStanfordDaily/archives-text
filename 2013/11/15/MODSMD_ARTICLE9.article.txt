# TROJAN WAR
## Card looks to win fourth straight at SC 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
The Bradford lob. The Luck pick-six. The
Nunes scramble.

Few rivalries in the last six years of college
football have been as thrilling as the rivalry be
tween Stanford and USC. From a historic upset
to a triple-overtime thriller to a memorable
postgame exchange at midfield, Stanford-USC
has seen it all.

Though No. 4 Stanford (8-1, 6-1 Pac-12) has
dominated the series lately by taking five out of
the last six contests and winning three in a row
at the Coliseum, the last three games between
the two teams have been decided by eight points
or fewer.

So it only seems fitting that after beating
Oregon in one of the biggest wins in school his
tory, the Cardinal's biggest roadblock to its sec
ond straight Pac-12 North title is a battle with
the Trojans (7-3, 4-2) a battle that will be
played out tomorrow night in front of a sold-out
Coliseum crowd and attended by ESPN's Col
lege Game Day crew. The storyline has complete
ly flipped from what it was just six years ago: A
Stanford team with everything to lose hopes to
avoid a letdown against a USC team with noth
ing to lose.

Even amidst the pressure, the Cardinal
wouldn't have it any other way.
"It's going to be exciting," said head coach
David Shaw. "The crowd will be into it. This is a
big game for both teams in respect to where we
are in the conference. You go down there and
expect everything. You expect it to be wild and
crazy, and you expect it to come down to the
end of the game."
"[USC] always just seems to play a really
good game against us," added senior defensive
end Henry Anderson.
Earlier in the season, the Men of Troy under
Lane Kiffin seemed to be headed toward disaster
after losing to Washington State at home and
getting pummeled by Arizona State in the
desert. But after USC athletic director Pat Haden

has played a big part in Stanford's offensive resurgence over the past few weeks.
gave Kiffin the red slip and appointed the fiery
Ed Orgeron to interim head coach, the Trojans
have come back from the dead with four victo
ries in five games and become one of the best
if not the best unranked teams in the coun
try.

The Trojans defense has been at the heart of
the team's resurgence.
Headlined by outside linebacker Devon Ken
nard and defensive end Leonard Williams,
USC's front seven has given up just six rush
ing touchdowns all season. The Trojans run
defense (112.5 yards per game) is the second
stingiest in the Pac-12, behind only Stanford's
unit (98.4 yards per game). While inside line
backer Hayes Pullard leads the team in tackles,
it's been Williams and Kennard who have con
sistently ended plays in the backfield by combin
ing for 13.0 sacks and 21.0 tackles for loss.
"[USC's] defense is very good," said fifth
year senior right guard Kevin Danser. "Their de
fensive line is outstanding. They've got a bunch
of great athletes there. Their linebackers are also
very impressive."
Danser and the Cardinal offense rediscov
ered their identity last week against the Ducks in
a season-best performance that allowed senior
running back Tyler Gaffney to bruise his way to
157 yards on a school-record 45 carries and gave
junior quarterback Kevin Hogan enough time to
make plays with his feet at the most critical
times. In what should be an interesting subplot,
Gaffney will try to accomplish the rare feat of
scoring in three different road games at the Col
iseum.

On the other side of the ball, the Trojans of
fense has made considerable strides after its em
barrassing futility at the start of the season.
USC boasts two of the nation's most dangerous
players, wide receivers Marqise Lee and Nelson
Agholor, on the perimeter. Lee remains a dan
gerous big-play threat even with new quarter
back Cody Kessler under center, while Agholor
is coming off two punt-return touchdowns
against Cal and putting up some staggering
numbers, including his 18.0 yards per recep
tion. And while Kessler is still inexperienced,
his efficiency has improved drastically since Org
eron took over.

"[Kessler] is a good game manager," Henry
Anderson said. "They've got some really good tal
ented running backs. They've kind of shoveled
around the offensive line a bit from last year."
The Trojans will have to make do without
their three-headed rushing attack, as Tre Mad

den is expected to miss tomorrow's game and
Silas Redd is also questionable. However, half
back Javorius Allen has proved to be more than
capable so far this season by averaging nearly
eight yards per carry.
"We always take [USC] very seriously,"
Danser said. "We always want to be as we call
it the kings of California. That's something

we take pride in."
Stanford looks to take another step towards
defending its Pac-12 title when it squares off
against USC at the Coliseum tomorrow. Kickoff
is slated for 5 p.m., with national television cov
erage on ABC.
