# M. WATER POLO
## CARD WINS OT THRILLER 
### LUKE ASPERGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the second time this season,
the matchup between the No. 4
Stanford men's water polo team
and No. 2 USC was dead even at
the end of regulation play. This
time, however, it was the Cardinal
who came out on top 17-16 after two
overtime periods that saw not just
one but two buzzer beaters from
fifth-year senior Paul Rudolph.

Stanford (18-4,6-1 MPSF) en
tered the match riding the mo
mentum of a seven-game winning
streak after a successful three
game road trip to Southern Cali
fornia the previous weekend. With
both teams vying for high seeds in

the approaching MPSF tourna
ment, all sides came out firing in
an offensively charged game.
Neither team was willing to
budge in the first half of the dra
ma-filled game. USC (22-3, 4-2
MPSF) jumped ahead three times
at the outset, but the Cardinal an
swered right back every time with
goals of its own. Stanford pulled
ahead with a 4-3 lead, but the Tro-

score twice. The first half
ended with Stanford clinging
to a 6-5 lead.
Stanford managed to ex

tend its advantage to 8-5 in
the third quarter with goals
from sophomore Bret Bonan
ni and junior Alex Bowen.
USC refused to give in, tight
ening the game with goals
from Nikola Vavic and Rex
Butler. At the end of the third
quarter, Stanford led 10-8.
Stanford came out looking
to attack in the fourth quar

ter, quickly increasing the
lead to 11-8, but USC dug in
once again and brought the
game back within one with
goals from Connor Virjee and
Vavic. Bowen scored again for
the Cardinal, but the Trojans
squeezed two more in before
the final whistle blew to put
the score at 12-12 at the end
of regulation.

The Trojans carried their
momentum into the first
overtime period and put
themselves in the driver's
seat with two unanswered
goals. With 55 seconds left in
the period, junior Connor
Cleary cashed in on the 6-on
-5 after a USC ejection. Trail
ing by just one with the sec
onds ticking down on the
clock, Rudolph came through
in the clutch to send the game
into another overtime period
with a goal just before the
buzzer sounded.
USC jumped ahead again
in the second overtime period
on a goal from Mace Rapsey.
However, Bowen evened the
score at 16-16 for the ninth
deadlock of the game with just
33 seconds left. Then Rudolph
came up huge one final time,
taking a long shot just as the
buzzer sounded that skipped
past the Trojan defense and
Tkojan goalie James Clark to
find its way into the goal and
secure the victory for Stan
ford.
With its first win against
USC since Oct. 2, 2011, the
Cardinal increased its win
ning streak to eight and ap
pears poised to take at least a
top-three seed into the up
coming MPSF tournament.
This Saturday, Stanford will
host Cal in the Cardinal's fi
nal game of the regular sea
son, dubbed the Big Splash.
