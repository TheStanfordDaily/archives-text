No. 3 Stanford women's basket
ball (3-1) beat UC-Davis for the
eighth consecutive time Sunday af
ternoon. Since losing to Connecti
cut in the second game of the sea
son, the Card has handily beaten its
two opponents, rolling Cal Poly on
Friday and then taking care of busi
ness against the Aggies with a 66-
48 victory.

Leading all scorers was senior
forward and National Player of the
Year candidate Chiney Ogwumike.
She had 28 points and 15 rebounds,
recording her fourth double-double
in as many games. In addition, the
Cardinal's offensive leader shot 13-
for-22 from the field and did it all
on the court: picking off two Aggie
passes one for a coast-to-coast
layup dishing out two assists
and blocking three shots.
"We've been spoiled with
Chiney," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "We need more help and
more people doing it. We need to
see what we can do to help her...
We have a lot of young players on a
steep learning curve who, frankly,
don't know what they are doing.
Those are the players who, in five
months, will help us more."
Those young players, five fresh
men (four of whom are available to
play), have been granted plenty of
playing time in the past two games
in order to gain the experience nec
essary for the team to continue to
improve and advance through the
season.
Freshmen Lili Thompson and
Erica McCall started the game,
with freshmen Karlie Samuelson
and Kailee Johnson coming off the
bench shortly after. Samuelson had
