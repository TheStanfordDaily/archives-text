No. 3 Stanford women's basket
ball (3-1) beat UC-Davis for the
eighth consecutive time Sunday af
ternoon. Since losing to Connecti
cut in the second game of the sea
son, the Card has handily beaten its
two opponents, rolling Cal Poly on
Friday and then taking care of busi
ness against the Aggies with a 66-
48 victory.

Leading all scorers was senior
forward and National Player of the
Year candidate Chiney Ogwumike.
She had 28 points and 15 rebounds,
recording her fourth double-double
in as many games. In addition, the
Cardinal's offensive leader shot 13-
for-22 from the field and did it all
on the court: picking off two Aggie
passes one for a coast-to-coast
layup dishing out two assists
and blocking three shots.
"We've been spoiled with
Chiney," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "We need more help and
more people doing it. We need to
see what we can do to help her...
We have a lot of young players on a
steep learning curve who, frankly,
don't know what they are doing.
Those are the players who, in five
months, will help us more."
Those young players, five fresh
men (four of whom are available to
play), have been granted plenty of
playing time in the past two games
in order to gain the experience nec
essary for the team to continue to
improve and advance through the
season.
Freshmen Lili Thompson and
Erica McCall started the game,
with freshmen Karlie Samuelson
and Kailee Johnson coming off the
bench shortly after. Samuelson had

a game of career highs as
she put up eight points to go
with six assists, four re
bounds and 33 minutes of
play.
"[Samuelson] did a great
job defensively [against Ag
gies' top scorer Sydee
Fipps], and we can play her
at the 2 or 3," said Van-
Derveer. "Whoever gets the
job done, I don't know who it
is we need more help."
"I was trying to take
away [Fipps's] shot and
drive," Samuelson said.
"When she drove, I had a lot
of help from my team. When
she drove to the basket,
Chiney was always there to
help."
To start the game, Davis
kept the game competitive,
tying the Card at 6-6. But an
11-0 run put the Cardinal up
for good, as it was able to
capitalize on all 11 Aggie
turnovers in the first half.
Stanford led 34-20 going into
halftime.
The Card dominated the
second half as it continued to
dominate the boards and beat

Davis in the paint (34-12).
Stanford grabbed 49 re
bounds, the fourth consecu
tive game in which the team
has had more than 40. In addi
tion, over the past four games,
the Card has held all of its op
ponents to under 40-percent
shooting from the field.
In addition to the stellar
performance by Ogwumike,
junior point guard Amber
Orrange had 10 points, four
assists and four rebounds.
Fifth-year senior Mikaela
Ruef finished with eight
points and eight rebounds.
Although 11 players saw
court action, only two scored
in double digits, and the
drop off from there was
marked. This lack of even
scoring across the roster
worries VanDerveer for
when the Card gets further
into preseason play and
eventually enters its Pac-12
schedule.
The Card has a week to
try to incorporate players
into the offense and work on
more balanced scoring be
fore it travels to Austin,
Texas, to take on the Texas
Longhorns Saturday at
10:30 a.m.
