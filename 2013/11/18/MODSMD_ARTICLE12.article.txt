## Randle comes through JUNIOR SCORES 29 IN VICTORY 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Despite a slow start in hos
tile territory, the Stanford
men's basketball team pulled
out a victory in its first road
game of the season on Sunday
afternoon, defeating the Denver
Pioneers 66-57. Thanks in large
part to junior guard Chasson
Randle, who finished with a
game-high 29 points on 10-of-14
shooting, the Cardinal was able
to keep it close early despite
dreadful shooting and then pull
away late.

Perhaps it was due to the al
titude or the relatively early
start time, but the Cardinal (3-
1) started painfully slow against
a very capable Denver (0-2)
team that retained 10 players
from last season's 22-win squad.
Were it not for the stellar per
formance of Randle, who has
been nothing short of phenome
nal for Stanford in the early
part of this season, the Cardinal
could have found itself in a big
hole early.
Randle scored 15 of Stan
ford's 24 first-half points, in
cluding 10 straight over the final
6:09 of the half, to keep the Car
dinal within one at the midway
point. Stanford shot just 36.4
percent from the field in the
first half, its worst shooting per
centage in any half so far this
season.
The second half proved to be
a different story, as senior for
ward Josh Huestis' free throws
with 13:10 left gave Stanford a
lead it would never again relin
quish. Randle was fantastic
again, scoring his final 14 points
on 5-of-6 shooting, but the dif
ference this time around was
that he finally received some
support from his teammates,
particularly seniors Anthony
Brown and Huestis. Each
scored all of his points during
the second half, as Brown con
tributed 12 and Huestis added
