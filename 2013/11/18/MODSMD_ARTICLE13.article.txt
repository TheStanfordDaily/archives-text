## OP-ED Stanford Should Phish its Employees and Students 
### 
Who remembers Stanford's
most recent attempt at
training all of us to be
more conscious about Internet se
curity? Yeah, me neither. All I re
member is that they made me
watch some videos, but I don't re
member liking it and I have no idea
at this point what I learned. I also
haven't heard of a single person
who is happy with the new two-step
authentication system, despite
Stanford's promises that it will
make us all safer.
As much as I think the Universi
ty's recent attempts to force us to
be more security aware have been
misguided, it's important that we
all recognize the threat that Stan
ford is trying to prepare us for: cy
ber crime.

Cyber crime has been a huge
problem in the last decade, and by
now I'm sure all of us are starting
to become desensitized to the news
that big companies like Adobe are
being hacked and are losing private
information about their consumers,
which I'm sure even includes some
of us here at Stanford. Don't be
come desensitized. All of us can do
our part to stop this trend.
The fact is that 91 percent of all
targeted attacks involve a specific
kind of social engineering called
"spear phishing," which is just a
more targeted, believable form of
phishing. That means that yes, be
lieve it or not, the vast majority of
hacking attempts on large compa
nies or organizations like Stanford
start with a single, believable phish
ing attempt and even just a few
people compromising their own
computers or accidentally giving up
their credentials.
If you're a computer science ma
jor like me, you know what I'm talk
ing about the CS Department at
Stanford has been the target of sev
eral spear phishing attempts in just
the last few months. I'll even admit
to almost clicking on a few of them.
Stanford could have the most
foolproof security systems in the
world, but, at the end of the day, the
weakest links are people like you
and me. A thief doesn't climb in
through the window on the 50th sto
ry of a building if he can find some
body to leave the front door un
locked.
I'm here to offer an alternative
to what Stanford is doing now
one that's been shown to work by at
least one Fortune 500 company:
Let's spend more time phishing
ourselves. Much like fire drills give
us a vague idea of what to do if
somebody burns their popcorn in
the microwave at 2 a.m. the day be
fore an exam (*sigh*), if Stanford
sent us regular emails that were in
tended to trick us and train us to

properly identify elaborate phish
ing attacks, we would become more
prepared and less gullible.
The beauty of it, though, is that
those of us who are already pretty
good at differentiating between the
elaborate scams and the real deal
(it's getting harder and harder
these days) don't have to be target
ed for additional training. At the
same time, those of us who do fall
for a "phishing drill," particularly if
the attempt is put together really
well, will be much more receptive to
learning how we can make sure we
aren't deceived in the future.

When this same training scheme
was used at an anonymous Fortune
500 company in an experiment by
Wombat Security Technologies, the
first time a fake phishing email was
sent out, 34 percent of employees
fell for it. After training those who
fell for the scam, less than 6 per
cent of employees fell for the
phishing email the next time.
That's an 84-percent improvement.
I'm no math major, but that is a big
deal.

Even if all we're doing is re
minding people that these threats
exist and we should all stay vigi
lant, phishing ourselves will make
people less likely to fall for elabo
rate traps. Maybe this makes us all
a little bit safer the next time an at
tack targets us personally instead of
Stanford. And maybe, just maybe,
this can make the University a safer
place for everyone without intrud
ing too much on each of our person
al lives. Just food for thought.

training all of us to be
more conscious about Internet se
curity? Yeah, me neither. All I re
member is that they made me
watch some videos, but I don't re
member liking it and I have no idea
at this point what I learned. I also
haven't heard of a single person
who is happy with the new two-step
authentication system, despite
Stanford's promises that it will
make us all safer.
As much as I think the Universi
ty's recent attempts to force us to
be more security aware have been
misguided, it's important that we
all recognize the threat that Stan
ford is trying to prepare us for: cy
ber crime.

Cyber crime has been a huge
problem in the last decade, and by
now I'm sure all of us are starting
to become desensitized to the news
that big companies like Adobe are
being hacked and are losing private
information about their consumers,
which I'm sure even includes some
of us here at Stanford. Don't be
come desensitized. All of us can do
our part to stop this trend.
The fact is that 91 percent of all
targeted attacks involve a specific
kind of social engineering called
"spear phishing," which is just a
more targeted, believable form of
phishing. That means that yes, be
lieve it or not, the vast majority of
hacking attempts on large compa
nies or organizations like Stanford
start with a single, believable phish
ing attempt and even just a few
people compromising their own
computers or accidentally giving up
their credentials.
If you're a computer science ma
jor like me, you know what I'm talk
ing about the CS Department at
Stanford has been the target of sev
eral spear phishing attempts in just
the last few months. I'll even admit
to almost clicking on a few of them.
Stanford could have the most
foolproof security systems in the
world, but, at the end of the day, the
weakest links are people like you
and me. A thief doesn't climb in
through the window on the 50th sto
ry of a building if he can find some
body to leave the front door un
locked.
I'm here to offer an alternative
to what Stanford is doing now
one that's been shown to work by at
least one Fortune 500 company:
Let's spend more time phishing
ourselves. Much like fire drills give
us a vague idea of what to do if
somebody burns their popcorn in
the microwave at 2 a.m. the day be
fore an exam (*sigh*), if Stanford
sent us regular emails that were in
tended to trick us and train us to

properly identify elaborate phish
ing attacks, we would become more
prepared and less gullible.
The beauty of it, though, is that
those of us who are already pretty
good at differentiating between the
elaborate scams and the real deal
(it's getting harder and harder
these days) don't have to be target
ed for additional training. At the
same time, those of us who do fall
for a "phishing drill," particularly if
the attempt is put together really
well, will be much more receptive to
learning how we can make sure we
aren't deceived in the future.

When this same training scheme
was used at an anonymous Fortune
500 company in an experiment by
Wombat Security Technologies, the
first time a fake phishing email was
sent out, 34 percent of employees
fell for it. After training those who
fell for the scam, less than 6 per
cent of employees fell for the
phishing email the next time.
That's an 84-percent improvement.
I'm no math major, but that is a big
deal.

Even if all we're doing is re
minding people that these threats
exist and we should all stay vigi
lant, phishing ourselves will make
people less likely to fall for elabo
rate traps. Maybe this makes us all
a little bit safer the next time an at
tack targets us personally instead of
Stanford. And maybe, just maybe,
this can make the University a safer
place for everyone without intrud
ing too much on each of our person
al lives. Just food for thought.

If Stanford sent
us emails
intended to train
us, we would
become more
prepared and less
gullible.
