## Decaf World 
### Kevin Rouff 
When Slavoj Zizek visited
Stanford two years ago, he
opened his talk by noting,
with his usual twitch and sniff,
"Wow, we really live in a decaf
feinated world!"
I did not take this as merely a
comment about the type of food or
beverages we serve here. Rather,
his remark was directed towards a
certain mentality we share that pri
oritizes work, efficiency and devo
tion to professionalism, to the slow
sculpting of young brains into adult
noggins.
Sweating profusely, he then pro
ceeded for several hours on wild
tangents leading nowhere and yet
everywhere, touching on subjects
that seemed fresh in his mind after
having glimpsed the lawns and din
ing halls, moving from subjects of
love to even the "meaning of life."
He gleefully revealed that he man
aged to do his entire lecture with
out ever making it past his intro
duction.
Why would the decaf world of
Stanford excite him to emphatically
rant about these sentimental sub
jects?
His remark points to a style of
life we, as do many students within
a college system, adopt due to a so
cial evaluative structure beginning
in adolescence and past our college
years. We are given an isolated uni
versity microcosm to work, use and
excel in for the purpose of learning
more about our own potential
through a preexisting evaluative
system; we receive information

about ourselves in the form of a sin
gle letter.
And, to be fair, it works fairly
well at the university level.
We work and work and work
and do well, and generally find jobs,
make a difference and/or raise fam
ilies in the real world. Yet there is
one crucial part that is overlooked,
and using Zizek's analogy, it's cof
fee.
Mmm, Coffee (capitalized to
give it some oomph).
Ignoring all health concerns
here, Coffee is representative of a
larger part of adult lives. An in
trosem in the same year of Zizek's

visit, taught by Dan Edelstein, ti
tled French 120: Coffee and Ciga
rettes, underlined the symbolic na
ture of Coffee as part of an intellec
tual and simultaneously social
culture. Though this was primarily
demonstrated in French literature
due to the nature of the course, it is
not limited as such.
As children, we are not sup
posed to drink coffee, and, as Kin
nucan points out, we interact solely
with other small humans of our own
age, remaining within our pre
scribed world, much as we do here.
Coffee, or adulthood, is largely de
pendent on the social and intimate
interactions we can have that are
beyond and independent from the
evaluative system to which to are
bound. In Coffee there is the unex
pected; in the decaf world, it is pre
conceived, extracted.
Richard Brautigan wrote,
"Sometimes life is merely a matter

of coffee and whatever intimacy a
cup of coffee affords," and at Stan
ford, we often forget the latter. We
use coffee to keep us awake, to
work, to be productive, and by do
ing so, our "matter of coffee" is
solely utilitarian.
Without the latter, unbridled by
the campus frame, we are fully re
moved from adulthood, despite the
notion that being an adult should
carry the notion of workworkwork.
Obviously, I am not arguing that
we all need to drink coffee, but I
believe it can been understood in
the sense that it represents a part
of the unconstrained and unre
strained external world meeting
new faces, conversing over black
liquid with familiar ones, going off
campus (woah!) to stand in line
somewhere, a breath of dusty
leafed autumn air alone to mull
things over, whatever you'd like

that should not be seen as a mere

break or pause in the work sched
ule.
It is immeasurably stressful to
see another suddenly snap out of a
thought in the midst of lunch or a
brief social encounter and state,
"Well I should work," as if speak
ing with others is counterproduc
tive or harmful to their upcoming
adulthood. How could interaction
with other real humans, especially
if of another social world than your
own, be less real or beneficial to
you than yet another reaffirmation
of your ability to get a certain
grade?
This isn't homework you do
not need to "make time" but rather
use it. Chug your coffee, stay up
late working, but don't decaf on
whatever intimacy a coffee can af
ford.
