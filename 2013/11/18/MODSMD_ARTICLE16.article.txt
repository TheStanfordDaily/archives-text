164 rushing yards for running back Tyler Gaffney
The senior had a solid game on the ground for Stanford in spite of inconsistent offensive line play through
out Saturday's 20-1 7 loss to USC. In particular, Gaffney's continued ability to fight through contact al
lowed him to turn a short run that was seemingly stopped for forward progress into a 35-yard touchdown
carry.
93,607 fans at the Coliseum
The crowd noise from 90,000 Trojan fans made it very difficult at times for Stanford to operate on offense.
On Stanford's first drive, an illegal snap and two forced timeout calls were by-products of Southern Califor
nia's energized fans.
10 points on four Stanford trips to the red zone
In four chances in the red zone, Stanford managed a measly 10 points. A blocked field goal and an inter
ception made the Cardinal come up empty twice, and those mistakes proved to be devastating. USC, on the
other hand, scored 1 7 points on only three trips to the red zone.
2 interceptions by Kevin Hogan
After playing a very steady first half for the Cardinal, junior quarterback Kevin Hogan had a rough second
half, throwing two interceptions. In particular, Hogan's second pick was disastrous, as USC was able to re
gain possession at its own 44. The Trojans would drive a mere 27 yards for the game-winning field goal.
second-half points allowed by the Cardinal defense
After struggling to adjust to USC's offensive wrinkles in the first half, Stanford's defense reasserted itself. Cody
Kessler and USC struggled mightily to consistently move the ball in the second frame, with five punts and a
lost fumble by Kessler before the game-winning kick. Fifth-year senior Trent Murphy turned in a standout per
formance for the defensive unit, with eight tackles, four tackles for loss and two sacks.
