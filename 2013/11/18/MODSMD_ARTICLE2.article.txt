## Engineering enrollment skyrockets Undergraduate majors double over last five years 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
Over the last five years, the per
centage of undergraduate engi
neering majors at Stanford has
risen from 20 percent to 38 percent
thanks to a change in curriculum
and an increased focus on interdis
ciplinary studies.
The growth has been increasing
every year, with computer science
(CS) which

tripled in size
and product de
sign seeing the
largest increases
and bioengineer
ing which was
only offered as
an undergradu
ate major start-

ing five years ago also growing,
said Dean of the School of Engi
neering Jim Plummer M.S. '67
Ph.D. '7l in an email statement.
President John Hennessy, who
has also served as the dean of the
School of Engineering and chair of
Computer Science, explained that
other areas of growth include man
agement science and engineering
and the environmental track in civ
il and environmental engineering.
"Over 15 years ago, engineering
majors were less than a quarter of
the class, just under 25 percent of
the graduating class, maybe 24 per
cent," Hennessy said. "I think in
this year's graduating class, [engi
neering majors] will probably be
just about a third or maybe even a
tiny bit over a third of the graduat
ing class."
With the recent changes in cur
riculum, Plummer believes that the
growth stems partly from empha
sizing engineering early in an un
dergraduate's career and providing
a broad engineering education.

Flexibility is key
The Computer Science Depart
ment in particular has made flexi
bility one of its recent priorities.
Hennessy explained that the cur
riculum shifted from requiring stu
dents to take a course in every sub
field to allowing them to focus on
one particular subfield instead.

"In the early days of the
major, it was a very high
unit major partly because of
this breadth with not much
flexibility," Hennessy said.
"The department felt and
I think students felt that
there was not enough oppor
tunity for students to ex
plore either interests out
side of computer science or
outside of engineering."
Eric Roberts, a professor
of computer science, also
spoke about the departmen
t's focus on outcomes in a
student's curriculum. In tra
ditional engineering curricu
la, he said, the end goal is of
ten lost through the numer
ous preparatory courses.
"The excitement that
comes from seeing what you
can do is so empowering
that people just take that
energy and run with it,"
Roberts said. "That idea,
which I think was pioneered
in computer science, has
percolated into other majors
as we 11... Product design
has that same 'keep your
eyes on the prize' ap
proach."

Interdisciplinary focus
Computer science has
come to encompass the
broader theme of interdisci
plinary studies that has
emerged within the School
of Engineering.
Roberts, who has taught
courses listed in 14 differ
ent departments and pro
grams including some in
the humanities, emphasized
the importance of computa
tional tools in all areas of

engineering.
Several of the recently
popular engineering majors,
such as product design and
management science and
engineering, have spanned
multiple disciplines, Hen
nessy said.
"We created the Depart
ment of Management Sci
ence and Engineering and
built a very vibrant under
graduate program with
tracks and different empha
sis focus areas that have be
come really vibrant and ex
citing for students," Hen
nessy said.
Robert Dutton, a profes
sor of electrical engineering,
spoke about the recent re
structuring of the electrical
engineering program to em
brace cross-disciplinary fo
cuses like sustainability, bio
logical applications and even
music.
"We have learned a lot
from how CS did its restruc
turing," Dutton said. "One
of the biggest things is we
have changed our unit re
quirement. The University
is trying to do that across
the board to get people to do
more interdisciplinary,
cross-disciplinary stuff."

Looking ahead
In general, Plummer said
the engineering curriculum
must be frequently adjusted
with the accumulation of
new information in the
fields.
"Engineering disciplines
are constantly changing,"
Plummer said. "It's been es
timated that the half life of
engineering knowledge is
only three to five years, so
our curricula have to be con
stantly updated to reflect
changing knowledge."
Over the years, the

School of Engineering has
also developed several facili
ties and programs to incor
porate more hands-on and
project-based learning.
Plummer listed resources
such as the d.school, estab
lished in 2003, and the Stan
ford Technology Ventures
Program, founded in the
mid 1990s as examples.
"We're looking at ways to
expand the d.school to un
dergraduates," Plummer
said. "We're considering
dual majors between CS and
some humanities depart
ments."
Plummer also spoke of
the school's efforts to ex
pand its infrastructure.
"Beginning about 25
years ago, the Engineering
School embarked on a
strategic plan to house all
nine of its departments in
21st-century facilities,"
Plummer said. "The Packard
Electrical Engineering
Building and the Gates CS
building were among the
first buildings constructed
as part of that plan."
In general, Plummer
wants to encourage not only
non-engineering students to
have more exposure to the
engineering school but also
engineering students to take
advantage of the breadth of
Stanford as a liberal arts
university.
"I think of engineers as
people who take discoveries
from the sciences and turn
those discoveries into things
that are useful for people,"
Plummer said. "We like to
think our graduates are peo
ple who will aim to change
the world, and we want to
equip them to do just that."
