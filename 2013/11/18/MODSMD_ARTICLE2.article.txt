## Engineering enrollment skyrockets Undergraduate majors double over last five years 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
Over the last five years, the per
centage of undergraduate engi
neering majors at Stanford has
risen from 20 percent to 38 percent
thanks to a change in curriculum
and an increased focus on interdis
ciplinary studies.
The growth has been increasing
every year, with computer science
(CS) which

tripled in size
and product de
sign seeing the
largest increases
and bioengineer
ing which was
only offered as
an undergradu
ate major start-

ing five years ago also growing,
said Dean of the School of Engi
neering Jim Plummer M.S. '67
Ph.D. '7l in an email statement.
President John Hennessy, who
has also served as the dean of the
School of Engineering and chair of
Computer Science, explained that
other areas of growth include man
agement science and engineering
and the environmental track in civ
il and environmental engineering.
"Over 15 years ago, engineering
majors were less than a quarter of
the class, just under 25 percent of
the graduating class, maybe 24 per
cent," Hennessy said. "I think in
this year's graduating class, [engi
neering majors] will probably be
just about a third or maybe even a
tiny bit over a third of the graduat
ing class."
With the recent changes in cur
riculum, Plummer believes that the
growth stems partly from empha
sizing engineering early in an un
dergraduate's career and providing
a broad engineering education.

Flexibility is key
The Computer Science Depart
ment in particular has made flexi
bility one of its recent priorities.
Hennessy explained that the cur
riculum shifted from requiring stu
dents to take a course in every sub
field to allowing them to focus on
one particular subfield instead.
