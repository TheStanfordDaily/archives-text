## UPSET AT SC GIVES PAC- 12 CONTROL BACK TO DUCKS 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Avoiding a letdown after one of the
biggest wins in school history was the
focus all week. Finding away to finish
games better was the goal all year.
On Saturday night, Stanford foot
ball failed to do either.

In front of an electric crowd of 93,607
at the Coliseum, it was USC (8-3, 5-2
Pac-12) who took No. 4 Stanford (8-2, 6-
2) into deep water and then used a late
field goal to stun the Cardinal in a 20-17
upset that ended with USC fans storm
ing the field. The revitalized Trojans
toppled the Cardinal's reign as king of
California, snapping its 14-game win
ning streak in contests played against
in-state teams. Suffering its first defeat
at the Coliseum since 2005, Stanford
saw its four-game winning streak
against the Trojans come to an end
no Cardinal player on the roster had
ever lost to USC before Saturday night.
As for the postseason picture,
Stanford is officially knocked out of
the national championship hunt and no
