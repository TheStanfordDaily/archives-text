# PASADENA LOST
## UPSET AT SC GIVES PAC- 12 CONTROL BACK TO DUCKS 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Avoiding a letdown after one of the
biggest wins in school history was the
focus all week. Finding away to finish
games better was the goal all year.
On Saturday night, Stanford foot
ball failed to do either.

In front of an electric crowd of 93,607
at the Coliseum, it was USC (8-3, 5-2
Pac-12) who took No. 4 Stanford (8-2, 6-
2) into deep water and then used a late
field goal to stun the Cardinal in a 20-17
upset that ended with USC fans storm
ing the field. The revitalized Trojans
toppled the Cardinal's reign as king of
California, snapping its 14-game win
ning streak in contests played against
in-state teams. Suffering its first defeat
at the Coliseum since 2005, Stanford
saw its four-game winning streak
against the Trojans come to an end
no Cardinal player on the roster had
ever lost to USC before Saturday night.
As for the postseason picture,
Stanford is officially knocked out of
the national championship hunt and no

Fifth-year senior Usua Amanam (bottom) attempts to tackle USC wide receiver Nelson Agholor (top)
during Stanford's 20-17 loss to the Trojans at the Coliseum Saturday evening. Amanam missed a key
tackle on USC's final drive, which ended in a game-winning 47-yard field goal by Andre Heidari.
longer controls its own Rose
Bowl destiny, although a
BCS berth is still possible.
Haunted by a shaky start,
questionable play-calling and
fatal mistakes in the red
zone, the Cardinal looked far
from the top-five team that
dominated Oregon just over
week ago.
"We didn't make enough
plays on offense," said head
coach David Shaw. "And
when we did make plays,
they didn't result in points.
Against a good team like this,
playing at the [Coliseum]
with all the energy and the
crowd, you got to get points."
In an ominous start, the
Cardinal's first drive of the
game a three-and-out
was plagued by a false-start
penalty sandwiched between
two timeouts taken by the of
fense due to communication
issues and the crowd noise,
and a costly third-down drop
by junior wide receiver Ty
Montgomery on a deep ball
that would have resulted in a
huge gain, if not a touch
down. Junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan looked down
right rattled.
Then the Trojans offense
came out and punched the
Cardinal right in the mouth.
Quarterback Cody
Kessler hit his two dangerous
targets, wide receivers Nel
son Agholor and Marqise
Lee, to convert a pair of third
downs before Kessler found
his wide-open fullback in the
end zone for a 1-yard touch
down pass.
Even though Andre Hei
dari missed the extra-point
attempt, it became clear that
the offensive futility associat
ed with USC's offense early
in the season was long gone.
Early on, Kessler bore more

resemblance to the 2011 ver
sion of former Trojans quar
terback Matt Barkley than a
first-year starter, and he
would finish the game 25-of
-37 for 288 yards and a touch
down.
The Cardinal offense re
grouped on its next posses
sion, when senior running
back Tyler Gaffney broke
loose for a 35-yard touch
down. It appeared as if he
was going to be easily
wrapped up in the backfield,
but the senior somehow es
caped a swarm of USC de
fenders and bounced to the
right before making a cut
back to find the end zone and
put the Cardinal up by a
point.
"You don't ever assume
you're stopped as a ball carri
er," Gaffney said. "You keep
going until the whistle blows
sometimes even shortly af
ter, you're still going."
A week after a record
breaking 45-carry perform
ance against Oregon, the
senior showed no signs of
wear and tear as he wound
up carrying the ball 24 times
for 164 yards and two touch
downs behind an offensive
line that opened up large
running lanes.
Still, the Trojans contin
ued to move the ball at will in
the first half. The Cardinal
could not get a consistent
pass rush on Kessler, and,
despite not being known for
his mobility, Kessler consis
tently moved out of the pock
et and made great throws on
the run. Halfback Javorius
Allen punched it in from one
yard out Kessler found
Lee in the back of the end
zone for the two-point con
version and Heidari hit a
23-yard field goal to put the
Trojans up by 10.
Following three-and-outs
by both teams, the Cardinal
offense drove down the field
with a balanced mix of runs
and passes. But on third

and-goal at the USC 10,
Hogan threw behind Mont
gomery on a slant, and Stan
ford settled for a field goal to
make it a seven-point game
at the half.
"[USC] played great in
the first half, which we knew
would happen," Shaw said.
"We talked about it all week:
These guys were going to
come out like gangbusters...
and we withstood it."
The Cardinal defense
locked down in the second
half as it shut down the Tro
jans' rushing game USC
had just 23 yards on the
ground and finally applied
constant pressure on Kessler.

"The biggest thing that
changed was... our [de
fense's mentality]," said fifth
year senior outside line
backer Trent Murphy, who
was the Cardinal's best de
fensive player on the night
with eight tackles, four of
which were tackles for loss.
Gaffney tied the score up
early in the third quarter
with an 18-yard run on third
and-8, but a defensive battle
ensued from there on out.
Just like it failed to do so
against Arizona State, Ore
gon State and Oregon, the
Cardinal could not close out
the game well. And on Satur
day night, the inability to fin
ish finally cost the team a vic
tory.
The collapse started with
the Trojans blocking a 30-
yard field goal attempt by
sophomore kicker Conrad
Ukropina, who was filling in
for an injured Jordan
Williamson.
"That was the story of the

game missed opportuni
ties," Shaw said.
Stanford threatened to
take the lead early in the
fourth quarter when it had a
first-and-goal at the USC 6.
In perhaps the most contro
versial call of the game, Shaw
elected to dial up a Wildcat
play with Hogan out of the
game and no pre-snap move
ment. The result was a 4-
yard loss by Gaffney. Bad
turned to worse when Shaw
called the same exact play
that led to the Montgomery
incompletion right before the
half, and, this time, safety
Dion Bailey made Stanford
pay by jumping the route and
coming up with an intercep
tion.
"I take full responsibili
ty," Shaw said. "It was a bad
call by me."
Even as the Cardinal de
fense held its ground, Hogan
made a fatal mistake with
three minutes left in the
game when he heaved the

ball in desperation as he was
getting dragged down. Just
two passes after getting
picked off by Bailey, Hogan
was intercepted once more
at the Trojan 44.
After shutting down the
USC offense for the entire
second half, the Cardinal de
fense couldn't quite make the
final big play. Playing with a
short field after the Hogan
interception, Kessler con
nected with Lee on fourth
and-2 to move the chains,
and, a few plays later, Hei
dari hit the game-winning
47-yard field goal with 19
seconds left to pull of the
stunning upset.
"It's not a good feeling,"
Gaffney said. "It's a tough
pill to swallow."
Stanford looks to regroup
for Big Game, as Cal pays the
Farm a visit next Saturday.
Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.

Fifth-year senior outside linebacker Trent Murphy (second from right) had two sacks and four tackles for loss to lead a
dominant second-half performance by the Stanford defense, but 17 quick points by the Trojans and two late turnovers
by Stanford gave USC an upset victory. Murphy leads the nation in sacks (1.2) and tackles for loss (1.8) per game.
