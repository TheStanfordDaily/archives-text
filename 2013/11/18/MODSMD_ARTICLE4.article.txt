## Treehouse expands seating area, creates "The Cardinal Zone" 
### SKYLAR COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Treehouse has been improving its din
ing experience with a new seating area
dubbed "The Cardinal Zone" and a more
streamlined digital ordering system.
Ray Klein, owner and operator of the
Treehouse, the Coffee House (CoHo) and
Stanford Student Enterprises, said that
months ago he expressed interest in taking
over the vacant space next to the Treehouse
that had most recently housed a Verizon
store.
Although the expansion took over a month
to complete, Klein said that it went smoothly,
with costs reaching around $7,000. Klein man
aged to minimized expenditures by hiring

people who have worked with him before.
"The main cost was to take down the glass
partition, and the rest was furniture and fix
tures, the tables, chairs, particularly the bar
we put in," Klein said. "I've built 40 restau
rants, so I had a depth of experience of what
was needed."
The addition, which features a 65-inch
Samsung HDTV and electronic charging
ports, seems to be a success. Klein reports
that the new area has been heavily used and
has helped relieve traffic congestion.
Diners seem pleased as well, using the
seating area to watch games and as a general
dining space.
"There are less people waiting around the
food area," Stu Melton 'l5 said.
"People seem to hang out [in
The Cardinal Zone] a lot more."
Klein said the new seating
area reflects a simple philoso
phy.
"I tried to make it comfort
able, I tried to make it simple
I didn't want to get carried
away with decor," Klein said. "I
made sure that we had an
inviting space [that was]
clean."

The Treehouse has also
successfully implemented Or
der Ahead, a digital system
that allows customer to order
and pay for take-out through
via computer or phone. Al
though Order Ahead has dealt
with restaurants using a fax
system, the Treehouse uses a
more modern setup involving
a special merchant tablet ap
plication.
According to Conway
Teng, a member of OrderA
head's Growth Team, the sys
tem is designed to allow poten
tial patrons to bypass the
more discouraging elements
of take-out, such as poor call

quality or disclosing sensitive
information over the phone.
Patrons can instead select
then* items and pay using the
program.
The app provides a specific
time for when an order will be
ready if a patron wants it im
mediately but also allows cus
tom ready times to be set if a
patron wants to pick up an or
der at a later time.
"Given how popular Tree
house is, customers are partic
ularly happy because they
don't have to wait around,"
Teng said. "Because kids these
days always have their phone
around and because our app

provides all the information
you would want from a place
like Treehouse, it's become ex
tremely convenient for stu
dents."
According to Klein, the sys
tem at Stanford is a success
and that students also seem to
enjoy it.
"Order Ahead is great,"
said Marco Juarez 'l6. "I mean
it's really nice to be able to text
in, use the app and be like, 'Oh
hey I need to order and go,'
and whenever I want to come
in, I'm good."
