## Former FBI director talks national security 
### ELIZABETH DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Robert Mueller 111, retired
sixth director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI),
visited Stanford last week to
give a talk on the FBl's role in
safeguarding national security
and technology's impact on the
future.
The event was sponsored by
the Freeman Spogli Institute
for International Studies and
held in the Stanford Institute
for Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR) Koret-Taube Confer
ence Center.
Mueller was selected as the
2013-14 Payne Distinguished
Lecturer in honor of his global
ly acclaimed leadership, vision
ary thinking and unique per
spective on dealing with world
wide challenges in the future.
Mueller discussed how in
creasingly destructive threats
to national security such as 9/11
have forced the FBI to move in
a more preemptive direction.
The FBI is no longer simply
concerned with retroactive
punitive actions, he said, but is

also now focused on anticipating
and preventing attacks before
they happen.
"We all knew that, with 9/11,
we faced extreme pressure to
identify individuals and disrupt
them at any cost," Mueller said.
"We have to identify a par
ticular threat, determine what
we know about that threat, but,
just as important, what are the
gaps of our knowledge, and uti
lize our resources such as hu
man intelligence, forensics and
surveillance, to fill those gaps,"
he added.
The new approach led the
FBI to triple their cadre of ana
lysts and change their direction
of resources.
According to Mueller, in the
years since 9/11, the FBI has
had relative success in identify
ing and destroying threats.
Though a few events such as the
Boston bombings last April
have gotten through, Mueller
said the FBI continues to im
prove and adapt to new chal
lenges.
He also went on to discuss
