# Q&A NADEEM HUSSAIN
## DEAN OF FRESHMAN-SOPHOMORE COLLEGE (FROSOCO) 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
Nadeem Hussain '9O, dean of Freshman-Sopho
more College (FroSoCo) and associate professor of
philosophy, was recently appointed the senior associ
ate vice provost of residential affairs where he will co
ordinate programming in undergraduate residences.
The Daily sat down with Hussain to discuss future
plans and goals for Stanford's residential program.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How would you describe
Stanford's residential experience?
Nadeem Hussain (NH): There are two essential
roles that [the undergraduate residential experience]
plays. First is that if you, as a student, feel comforf
able and safe and happy and supported by your
Mends and your residence, then you're going to be
able to make the most out of the rest of your life at
Stanford.
And the second thing is the inevitably many life
lessons you learn in interactions in the residential
communities. You're learning how to interact in fruit
ful ways with others on an individual level, you're
learning how to work collaboratively and effectively in
teams, you're learning what it means to be responsi
ble and what happens if people aren't responsible and
you're acquiring various kinds of relationships.
TSD: How is the experience different for students of
different class years?
NH: I think we've done a great job making sure that
when the students arrive as freshmen, they feel ex
cited and welcomed at Stanford. When you come in
as a freshman, the crucial thing is helping you devel
op relationships with other students, building com
munity, feeling as though you belong.
Sophomore year is this interesting transition year*
where I think we need to do a lot more to make soph
omores feel supported as they go through that tran
sition. And part of it is convincing sophomores that
not as much hangs on that decision [of choosing their
majors] as they think it does.
The junior year experience is very interesting be
cause a lot of students do go abroad or at least leave
campus. We need to think about how to encourage
them to do that.
Then in senior year, students are of course look
ing ahead to what they're going to do after they leave
Stanford. And then residences are a delivery point...
to really giving them the resources to think about
what kind of careers they want to have, what kind of
people they want to be. One of the questions I always
get from seniors is this difficult question of whether
to spend the rest of your life, in a sense, primarily fo
cusing on doing well for yourself or your* family or
whether you want to really change the world.
