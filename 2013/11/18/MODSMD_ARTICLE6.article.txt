# Q&A NADEEM HUSSAIN
## DEAN OF FRESHMAN-SOPHOMORE COLLEGE (FROSOCO) 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
Nadeem Hussain '9O, dean of Freshman-Sopho
more College (FroSoCo) and associate professor of
philosophy, was recently appointed the senior associ
ate vice provost of residential affairs where he will co
ordinate programming in undergraduate residences.
The Daily sat down with Hussain to discuss future
plans and goals for Stanford's residential program.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How would you describe
Stanford's residential experience?
Nadeem Hussain (NH): There are two essential
roles that [the undergraduate residential experience]
plays. First is that if you, as a student, feel comforf
able and safe and happy and supported by your
Mends and your residence, then you're going to be
able to make the most out of the rest of your life at
Stanford.
And the second thing is the inevitably many life
lessons you learn in interactions in the residential
communities. You're learning how to interact in fruit
ful ways with others on an individual level, you're
learning how to work collaboratively and effectively in
teams, you're learning what it means to be responsi
ble and what happens if people aren't responsible and
you're acquiring various kinds of relationships.
TSD: How is the experience different for students of
different class years?
NH: I think we've done a great job making sure that
when the students arrive as freshmen, they feel ex
cited and welcomed at Stanford. When you come in
as a freshman, the crucial thing is helping you devel
op relationships with other students, building com
munity, feeling as though you belong.
Sophomore year is this interesting transition year*
where I think we need to do a lot more to make soph
omores feel supported as they go through that tran
sition. And part of it is convincing sophomores that
not as much hangs on that decision [of choosing their
majors] as they think it does.
The junior year experience is very interesting be
cause a lot of students do go abroad or at least leave
campus. We need to think about how to encourage
them to do that.
Then in senior year, students are of course look
ing ahead to what they're going to do after they leave
Stanford. And then residences are a delivery point...
to really giving them the resources to think about
what kind of careers they want to have, what kind of
people they want to be. One of the questions I always
get from seniors is this difficult question of whether
to spend the rest of your life, in a sense, primarily fo
cusing on doing well for yourself or your* family or
whether you want to really change the world.
TSD: What are your short
term and long-term goals for
the residential program?
NH: In the short run, [there
is] a new dorm in Manzanita
Park that's guaranteed to hap
pen. We're looking into build
ing new dorms elsewhere,
and, hopefully, we'll actually
be able to do that soon.
We need to think in a much
more comprehensive way
about what it is we can do in
order to make the residences
the kinds of places where stu
dents do feel supported, hap
py, comfortable and safe.
There needs to be a chan
nel with a much higher band
width of communication and
interaction â€”where students
know exactly where to go to be
able to share their views about
how things are working... it's
a bi-directional thing.
TSD: What are the biggest
challenges you're facing in
your work?
NH: The biggest challenge is
trying to get all the facilities
on campus up to a point that
we can really be proud of
them. We, right now, just do
not have enough beds on cam
pus for undergraduates. And
there are lots of places on
campus where we've, in the
past, had to convert common
spaces of various kinds into
dorm rooms.
It's hard because you don't
want to disrupt the campus
during the school year, so ide
ally you'd want to do construc-

tion and modification of places
only during the summer, but
you don't have a lot of time
during the summer.
TSD: Do you have any advice
for undergraduates who
might be going through the
same residential experiences
that you went through during
your time at Stanford?
NH: My advice would be that
life is incredibly unpre
dictable. People should relax,
do what they find interesting,
think about the future, plan,
worry about it to some degree
but, fundamentally, just take
the opportunity to think about
what they're learning here
and really enjoy and develop
the relationships with other
people here.
This faculty they are
world-class people. They have
amazing research projects of
their own, usually fascinating
life stories, and they can bring
you into that whole world of
theirs and other worlds that
they're connecting to. So go
out there and meet people.
