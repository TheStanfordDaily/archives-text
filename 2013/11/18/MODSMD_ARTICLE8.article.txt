## Painful loss was avoidable 
### Sam Fisher 
This one hurt a lot. To me, it
hurt a lot more than any
other loss I've witnessed
in my four years watching
Stanford football. I have
to go back to my Philadelphia Eagles'
Super Bowl loss in 2005 to remember
feeling so badly after a football game.
I can't help but be reminded of a
quote from Stanford women's volley
ball coach John Dunning's postgame
press conference after a loss to
ironically— USC earlier this year.
"I'm angry because I didn't think it
had to end up this way," Dunning said.
"I have a lot of belief and confidence in
our team. I'm going to have to get over
the anger part of it, I guess."
Doesn't that sum it up well? It cer
tainly didn't have to end up the way it
did Saturday night. Stanford played
badly—and give the Trojans credit
for showing up— but there were so
many opportunities for the Cardinal
to score enough points to survive.
The statistic that best describes
what happened is red-zone efficiency:
Stanford managed only 10 points in
four red-zone trips while USC put up
17 points in three chances. That was
the game right there.
Breaking down Stanford's four
red-zone opportunities is borderline
infuriating. Besides the one touch
down, nothing went well. Even Stan
ford's field goal came in perplexing
fashion. Who throws a slant short of
the goal line without a timeout and 20
seconds left in the half? Had junior
wide receiver Ty Montgomery caught
the pass, Stanford may have run out
of time before getting a field goal off.
The two empty possessions were
even worse. I'll never understand
why head coach David Shaw decided
to go to the Wildcat on first-and-goal
at the 6. Then, he chose the only Wild
cat play Stanford has without putting
Montgomery or junior wide receiver
Kelsey Young in motion, and Gaffney
was dead in the water.
Somehow it got even worse on
third down. Shaw thought he could
run the exact same slant play (only
flipped) that didn't work right before
halftime, and USC free safety Dion
Bailey made him pay. Bailey said in
the postgame press conference that
as soon as he saw the formation he
knew exactly which play was coming.
That has to give you confidence in the
play calling...
Of course the players deserve some
of the blame for such a bad loss, but I
err on the side of placing too much
blame on the staff. With the exception
of Montgomery's drops and Hogan's
interception at the end of the game,
there weren't that many mistakes by
the players. And after its disappoint
ingly slow start, you can't ask for a
much better performance than what
the Stanford defense came up with.
Leaving the details of the loss
aside, what makes the game even
tougher to handle is the postseason
fallout fiom the loss. Stanford now has
two Pac-12 losses, so Oregon will al
most certainly win the Pac-12 North
and host the Pac-12 Championship
Game. Barring anything crazy that'll
put Oregon in the Rose Bowl. So as
tough as its loss to Stanford may have
seemed just over a week ago, Oregon
won't end up in too bad of a spot.
Stanford, however, now needs a
lot of help to avoid ending up at the
Alamo Bowl. There are 10 spots avail
able in the BCS, but there isn't much
room for at-large bids. There are six
conferences that automatically send
their winner to the BCS, so that
leaves only four spots. Then, if the
rankings finish the way they are right
now, either Northern Illinois or Fres
no State will be an automatic qualifier
for winning its conference and finish
ing ahead of another automatic quali
fier (Central Florida in all likelihood).
With only three spots left, Stan
ford would have to compete against
teams like Clemson, whoever finishes
second in the SEC and a secondary
team from the Big 12 or Big Ten for a
chance to play in a BCS game.
With some bad luck, Stanford
could get the short end of the stick and
end up in San Antonio at the Alamo
Bowl. After starting the season with so
much promise and beating Oregon,
that would be a disastrous ending
that never should have come into
play. But that's what happens when
you lose twice in college football.

This one hurt a lot. To me, it
hurt a lot more than any
other loss I've witnessed
in my four years watching
Stanford football. I have
to go back to my Philadelphia Eagles'
Super Bowl loss in 2005 to remember
feeling so badly after a football game.
I can't help but be reminded of a
quote from Stanford women's volley
ball coach John Dunning's postgame
press conference after a loss to
ironically— USC earlier this year.
"I'm angry because I didn't think it
had to end up this way," Dunning said.
"I have a lot of belief and confidence in
our team. I'm going to have to get over
the anger part of it, I guess."
Doesn't that sum it up well? It cer
tainly didn't have to end up the way it
did Saturday night. Stanford played
badly—and give the Trojans credit
for showing up— but there were so
many opportunities for the Cardinal
to score enough points to survive.
The statistic that best describes
what happened is red-zone efficiency:
Stanford managed only 10 points in
four red-zone trips while USC put up
17 points in three chances. That was
the game right there.
Breaking down Stanford's four
red-zone opportunities is borderline
infuriating. Besides the one touch
down, nothing went well. Even Stan
ford's field goal came in perplexing
fashion. Who throws a slant short of
the goal line without a timeout and 20
seconds left in the half? Had junior
wide receiver Ty Montgomery caught
the pass, Stanford may have run out
of time before getting a field goal off.
The two empty possessions were
even worse. I'll never understand
why head coach David Shaw decided
to go to the Wildcat on first-and-goal
at the 6. Then, he chose the only Wild
cat play Stanford has without putting
Montgomery or junior wide receiver
Kelsey Young in motion, and Gaffney
was dead in the water.
Somehow it got even worse on
third down. Shaw thought he could
run the exact same slant play (only
flipped) that didn't work right before
halftime, and USC free safety Dion
Bailey made him pay. Bailey said in
the postgame press conference that
as soon as he saw the formation he
knew exactly which play was coming.
That has to give you confidence in the
play calling...
Of course the players deserve some
of the blame for such a bad loss, but I
err on the side of placing too much
blame on the staff. With the exception
of Montgomery's drops and Hogan's
interception at the end of the game,
there weren't that many mistakes by
the players. And after its disappoint
ingly slow start, you can't ask for a
much better performance than what
the Stanford defense came up with.
Leaving the details of the loss
aside, what makes the game even
tougher to handle is the postseason
fallout fiom the loss. Stanford now has
two Pac-12 losses, so Oregon will al
most certainly win the Pac-12 North
and host the Pac-12 Championship
Game. Barring anything crazy that'll
put Oregon in the Rose Bowl. So as
tough as its loss to Stanford may have
seemed just over a week ago, Oregon
won't end up in too bad of a spot.
Stanford, however, now needs a
lot of help to avoid ending up at the
Alamo Bowl. There are 10 spots avail
able in the BCS, but there isn't much
room for at-large bids. There are six
conferences that automatically send
their winner to the BCS, so that
leaves only four spots. Then, if the
rankings finish the way they are right
now, either Northern Illinois or Fres
no State will be an automatic qualifier
for winning its conference and finish
ing ahead of another automatic quali
fier (Central Florida in all likelihood).
With only three spots left, Stan
ford would have to compete against
teams like Clemson, whoever finishes
second in the SEC and a secondary
team from the Big 12 or Big Ten for a
chance to play in a BCS game.
With some bad luck, Stanford
could get the short end of the stick and
end up in San Antonio at the Alamo
Bowl. After starting the season with so
much promise and beating Oregon,
that would be a disastrous ending
that never should have come into
play. But that's what happens when
you lose twice in college football.
