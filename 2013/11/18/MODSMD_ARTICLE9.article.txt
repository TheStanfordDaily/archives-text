# BEAVER BEATDOWN
## STANFORD SWEEPS OREGON STATE DESPITE SUB-PAR ATTACK EFFICIENCY 
### JORDAN WALLACH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Usually a three-set victory
suggests a dominant perform
ance by the team coming out on
top. Yet Stanford's women's vol
leyball team played one of its
worst statistical offensive
games this season while still
recording its 17th sweep of the
season.

Whether the Card pulled it
off with a strong defensive per
formance or due to poor play by
an Oregon State team that is
winless in conference play, the
mantra "a win is a win" is most
appropriate.
The No. 6 Cardinal (20-5,13-
3 Pac-12) held off the Beavers
(9-18, 0-16) in three sets 25-22,
25-23, 25-20 on Saturday to ex
tend its winning streak to five
matches since a five-set home
loss to No. 4 USC. Stanford was
held to just a .211 attack per
centage, its second-lowest total
of the season after a .190 mark
against then-No. 6 Texas in Sep
tember.

Defoe was a key to limiting the
Cardinal offense. The Beavers'
lone senior, Defoe recorded 20
digs on Senior Night in Corval

lis, Ore. Defoe entered the
weekend ranked fifth in the Pac
-12 with 4.45 digs per set and
continued her pursuit to become
just the 10th player in confer
ence history to reach 2,000 ca
reer digs she is currently at
1,967.
Yet the Cardinal was able to
avoid Defoe in key spots, as it
tied a season high with nine
service aces in the match five
of which came in the third set.
Sophomore outside hitter Jor
dan Burgess led the team with a
season-high three aces to go
with seven kills and 11 digs.
Senior middle blocker Carly
Wopat had a team-high 13 kills
and .667 hitting percentage,
while sophomore outside hitter
Inky Ajanaku had eight kills
and six blocks.
The match was close from
the start, as the first set saw
eight tied scores and two lead
changes. Stanford never led by
more than three points, held
back by six attack errors and a
.171 hitting percentage. After
an Oregon State timeout with
the score even at 22, the Cardi
nal went on a three-point run
tying its longest of the set to
take the first game.
The Beavers were poised to
tie the match in the second set,
jumping to a 6-4 lead early on.
But Stanford won nine of the
next 11 points, going up 13-8
