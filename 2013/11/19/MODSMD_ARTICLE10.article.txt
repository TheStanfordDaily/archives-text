## The
						perils of storming the field 
### Ashley Westhem 
Despite the fact that it's
the beginning of week
nine and the smell of
roses is quickly disap
pearing from campus,
today started out pretty wellâ€”until I
heard the Trojans fight song blaring
out of someone's head phones on my
way to class. Who even does that?
Needless to say the wounds are re
opened, and I need to vent.
In 2007,1 stood dumbfounded next
to the student section in the Coliseum,
clutching a miniature Traveler, the
Trojan horse, as the Stanford band
and fans ecstatically cheered after The
Biggest Upset Ever on the opposite
side of the stadium.
This year, I stood dumbfounded
opposite the student section, clutching
my little stuffed tree, as the game-win
ning field goal sailed through the posts
and USC students stormed the field.
It's not exactly fun ending up on the
losing side both times. It hurt just as
bad this time, but my 20-year-old self
is able to grasp the consequences of
the loss a lot better than my 13-year
old self.
I am a college football fan through
and through, and I can appreciate the
closeness and excitement of the game
even though I wish the Card had
done a couple things more effectively
to pull off a win. USC played a good
game and that can't be taken away
from them.
