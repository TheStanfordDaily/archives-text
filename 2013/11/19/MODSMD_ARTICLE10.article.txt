## The 						perils of storming the field 
### Ashley Westhem 
Despite the fact that it's
the beginning of week
nine and the smell of
roses is quickly disap
pearing from campus,
today started out pretty well—until I
heard the Trojans fight song blaring
out of someone's head phones on my
way to class. Who even does that?
Needless to say the wounds are re
opened, and I need to vent.
In 2007,1 stood dumbfounded next
to the student section in the Coliseum,
clutching a miniature Traveler, the
Trojan horse, as the Stanford band
and fans ecstatically cheered after The
Biggest Upset Ever on the opposite
side of the stadium.
This year, I stood dumbfounded
opposite the student section, clutching
my little stuffed tree, as the game-win
ning field goal sailed through the posts
and USC students stormed the field.
It's not exactly fun ending up on the
losing side both times. It hurt just as
bad this time, but my 20-year-old self
is able to grasp the consequences of
the loss a lot better than my 13-year
old self.
I am a college football fan through
and through, and I can appreciate the
closeness and excitement of the game
even though I wish the Card had
done a couple things more effectively
to pull off a win. USC played a good
game and that can't be taken away
from them.
Every student deserves to
have that epic moment of
storming the field after a huge
win. Nerd Nation had its
chance after the Oregon win,
and USC got its chance Satur
day night.
I have to say though that I
prefer not having to pay al
most $2OO as a student each
season to watch Stanford foot
ball and I appreciated the fact
that Stanford has a student
population a quarter of that of
USC, which made storming
the field a lot more fun than
frenzied.
This brings me to the next
topic of this weekend for which
the wounds will literally not
heal for a while: the extent of
the injuries sustained during
USC's storming of the field.
The media has very much
been downplaying the injuries,
and we should be thankful that
this was not a topic of discus
sion relevant to Stanford after
the Oregon win. One report
claimed that the worst injury

sustained was an injured ankle
and all claimed that none of the
10 reported injuries was life
threatening. This is where the
reporters should have fact
checked or withheld informa
tion they were uncertain about.
One of my best Mends from
high school was among those
trampled in the chaos. She and
her Mends had anticipated
storming the field if the Tro
jans were finally able to pull off
a win against the Cardinal
just as every other USC stu
dent envisioned their night
ending. Who can fault them
that wish?
My Mend is in the ICU
with two broken ribs and a col
lapsed lung and is with us to
day due to some divine inter
vention. So don't always be
lieve that what is reported is
entirely accurate. But also,
don't blame the students for
getting rowdy and wanting to
celebrate a great win. I was dis
gusted by the comments left on
a Bleacher Report brief criticiz
ing the students for acting in
such a manner and claiming
that if you rush the field you
are responsible for what hap
pens.
First of all, that is disre

spectful to those injured and to
people like me who know of
someone injured. And second,
did you not go to college? Life
is short and you have to seize
the exciting moments in life
like tailgating with your friends
at another school or storming
the field after your team comes
through with a win.
I don't fault my friend for
doing the same thing I did two
weeks ago at Stanford Stadi
um. It's just sad that reporters
and others don't respect what
actually happened and why the
students did it.

By hosting me last week
end, my friend taught me that
game day isn't about rivalries
and hate —it's about having
fun and supporting your
school. And so as I pray for her,
I'll remember her leading me
through the tailgates, bom
barding me with names and
yelling in my defense at anyone
who tried to disrespect the
Trees. Win or lose, that's the
true spirit of college football.

roses is quickly disap
pearing from campus,
today started out pretty well—until I
heard the Trojans fight song blaring
out of someone's head phones on my
way to class. Who even does that?
Needless to say the wounds are re
opened, and I need to vent.
In 2007,1 stood dumbfounded next
to the student section in the Coliseum,
clutching a miniature Traveler, the
Trojan horse, as the Stanford band
and fans ecstatically cheered after The
Biggest Upset Ever on the opposite
side of the stadium.
This year, I stood dumbfounded
opposite the student section, clutching
my little stuffed tree, as the game-win
ning field goal sailed through the posts
and USC students stormed the field.
It's not exactly fun ending up on the
losing side both times. It hurt just as
bad this time, but my 20-year-old self
is able to grasp the consequences of
the loss a lot better than my 13-year
old self.
I am a college football fan through
and through, and I can appreciate the
closeness and excitement of the game
even though I wish the Card had
done a couple things more effectively
to pull off a win. USC played a good
game and that can't be taken away
from them.
Every student deserves to
have that epic moment of
storming the field after a huge
win. Nerd Nation had its
chance after the Oregon win,
and USC got its chance Satur
day night.
I have to say though that I
prefer not having to pay al
most $2OO as a student each
season to watch Stanford foot
ball and I appreciated the fact
that Stanford has a student
population a quarter of that of
USC, which made storming
the field a lot more fun than
frenzied.
This brings me to the next
topic of this weekend for which
the wounds will literally not
heal for a while: the extent of
the injuries sustained during
USC's storming of the field.
The media has very much
been downplaying the injuries,
and we should be thankful that
this was not a topic of discus
sion relevant to Stanford after
the Oregon win. One report
claimed that the worst injury

sustained was an injured ankle
and all claimed that none of the
10 reported injuries was life
threatening. This is where the
reporters should have fact
checked or withheld informa
tion they were uncertain about.
One of my best Mends from
high school was among those
trampled in the chaos. She and
her Mends had anticipated
storming the field if the Tro
jans were finally able to pull off
a win against the Cardinal
just as every other USC stu
dent envisioned their night
ending. Who can fault them
that wish?
My Mend is in the ICU
with two broken ribs and a col
lapsed lung and is with us to
day due to some divine inter
vention. So don't always be
lieve that what is reported is
entirely accurate. But also,
don't blame the students for
getting rowdy and wanting to
celebrate a great win. I was dis
gusted by the comments left on
a Bleacher Report brief criticiz
ing the students for acting in
such a manner and claiming
that if you rush the field you
are responsible for what hap
pens.
First of all, that is disre

spectful to those injured and to
people like me who know of
someone injured. And second,
did you not go to college? Life
is short and you have to seize
the exciting moments in life
like tailgating with your friends
at another school or storming
the field after your team comes
through with a win.
I don't fault my friend for
doing the same thing I did two
weeks ago at Stanford Stadi
um. It's just sad that reporters
and others don't respect what
actually happened and why the
students did it.

By hosting me last week
end, my friend taught me that
game day isn't about rivalries
and hate —it's about having
fun and supporting your
school. And so as I pray for her,
I'll remember her leading me
through the tailgates, bom
barding me with names and
yelling in my defense at anyone
who tried to disrespect the
Trees. Win or lose, that's the
true spirit of college football.
