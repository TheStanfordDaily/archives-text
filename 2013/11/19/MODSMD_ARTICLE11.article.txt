# STANFORD IN THE NFL
## LUCK, FLEENER LEAD COLTS COMEBACK 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
At this point, do we hon
estly expect anything other
than a second-half comeback
from the Colts?
Andrew Luck 'l2 led yet
another Indianapolis Colts'
comeback victory on Thurs
day evening as the Colts ral
lied from an early 14-0 deficit
to defeat the Titans 30-27 and
improve to 7-3 on the season.
"At the end of the day, win
ning is what matters," Luck
told ESPN. "We were fortu
nate in this game to survive
our mistakes and have a
chance to win... But we know
that's got to be fixed."
Luck finished 23 for 36
with 232 yards passing on the
night, but his most important
contribution to the game came
way of his feet. In the third
quarter, Luck scrambled and
ran in a touchdown from 11

yards out to give the Colts
their first lead at 17-14 a
lead that they would not sur
render on their way to victory.
This season, Luck has
shown improvement in nearly
every facet of his game. He
has thrown for 2,430 yards
with a 59.4 percent comple
tion rate, 14 touchdowns, and
six interceptions. He has al
most equaled last year's
rushing totals already this
year as well, with 231 yards
rushing and four rushing
touchdowns Luck posted
255 yards rushing and five
rushing touchdowns last year.
Luck's most important
stat, however, is his seven
wins, including victories over
Denver (one-loss team), Seat
tle (one-loss team) and San
Francisco (defending NFC
champion).
In addition, tight end Co
by Fleener 'll played one of
the best games of his young

career, finishing with a ca
reer-high eight catches to go
along with 107 yards receiv
ing for the Colts.

Miami Dolphins tackle
Jonathan Martin 'l2 contin
ues to take a leave of absence
from the team after allegedly
suffering bullying and harass
ment at the hands of fellow of
fensive lineman and teammate
Richie Incognito. Martin re
portedly no longer wants to be
a part of the Dolphins organi
zation after the poor treat
ment he received from both
the team and the players.
Countless former team
mates and coaches at Stanford
have publicly stated their sup
port for Martin, including cur
rent Stanford head coach
David Shaw, former Stanford
head coach Jim Harbaugh,
former Stanford wide receiver
Doug Baldwin 'll and many
current Stanford players.
Martin was on the Stanford
sideline for the game against
USC at the Coliseum and was
seen in the locker room after
wards.
Martin's situation has
raised questions about the
state of hazing and bullying
not only in the NFL, but in all
professional sports. The Dol
phins continue to meet with
NFL investigators about the
situation and have indefinitely
suspended Richie Incognito.

In other news, Pittsburgh
Steelers guard David DeCas
tro 'l2 played a major role in
the Steelers 37-27 upset of the
Detroit Lions this past Sun
day. DeCastro matched up
against All-Pro defensive
tackle Ndamukong Suh and
prevented him from putting
anything on the stat sheet, as
Suh finished without a tackle
and without a sack in the
game.
San Diego Chargers line
backer Thomas Keiser 'll
continues to play a role for the
team that signed him off of the
practice squad in the middle of
the season. Keiser recorded
two tackles, including a sack,
in the Chargers' 20-16 loss
against the Dolphins. Keiser
now has 15 tackles and three
sacks on the year since being
activated by the Chargers be
fore week five of the NFL sea
son.
