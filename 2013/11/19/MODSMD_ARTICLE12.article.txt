# UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY
## CARD FACES CHALLENGING PATH

Hisarts racing, surrounded
by deafening noise and
pumped up with adrena
line, 11 players step onto
the field for what could be
the last time of the season. There are
five wins standing between them and a
national championship, and everything
else ceases to matter.
"You feel like this... entire little sta
dium that they've set up for this partic
ular tournament is suddenly just the
whole world," said senior defender Na
talie Griffen. "That's it, and all that ex
ists is that field."
When the No. 17 Cardinal (14-5-1)
takes the field against No. 14 South
Carolina (17-3-2) this Friday in its sec
ond-round match of the NCAA tourna
ment, Griffen along with six of her
fellow seniors will experience this
feeling for one of the last times of her
college career, as the team continues its
16th consecutive playoffs campaign.
Stanford is in a unique position for
this year's playoffs.
After losing five regular season con
ference games the worst record dur
ing head coach Paul Ratcliffe's tenure
the Cardinal entered the tournament
unseeded. This is a major change for a
team that has been awarded the No. 1
overall seed in the tournament for the

past six years. For the first time in a
long time, Stanford is statistically the
underdog.
Of course, the legacy of the Stanford
women's team is immense; the team
regularly produces Olympic and nation
al team players and has gone to the Col
lege Cup in each of the last five years.
Until this year, every member of the
squad had only experienced a Stanford
team that steamrolled its way over
every opponent in the regular season
and throughout the tournament. That
legacy weighs on every single player on
the team, serving as a constant re
minder of what the women can and have
achieved.
Given the different circumstances of
this season, though, everyone on the
team, from the freshmen to the seniors,
will have to learn and adapt in new ways
as they go through the postseason in an
entirely new position. On the one hand,
a single loss finishes not only the sea
son, but ends the seniors' college ca
reers as well. On the other hand, there's
a new sense of freedom from coming in
with an imperfect record.
"It's exciting," said senior forward
and co-captain Courtney Verloo about
experiencing her final postseason. "I
feel like this year is an opportunity un
like any other year based on our season
thus far, and it's kind of a cool feeling to
go in as an underdog with nothing to
