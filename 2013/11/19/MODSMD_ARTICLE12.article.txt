# UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY
## CARD FACES CHALLENGING PATH 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
Hisarts racing, surrounded
by deafening noise and
pumped up with adrena
line, 11 players step onto
the field for what could be
the last time of the season. There are
five wins standing between them and a
national championship, and everything
else ceases to matter.
"You feel like this... entire little sta
dium that they've set up for this partic
ular tournament is suddenly just the
whole world," said senior defender Na
talie Griffen. "That's it, and all that ex
ists is that field."
When the No. 17 Cardinal (14-5-1)
takes the field against No. 14 South
Carolina (17-3-2) this Friday in its sec
ond-round match of the NCAA tourna
ment, Griffen along with six of her
fellow seniors will experience this
feeling for one of the last times of her
college career, as the team continues its
16th consecutive playoffs campaign.
Stanford is in a unique position for
this year's playoffs.
After losing five regular season con
ference games the worst record dur
ing head coach Paul Ratcliffe's tenure
the Cardinal entered the tournament
unseeded. This is a major change for a
team that has been awarded the No. 1
overall seed in the tournament for the

past six years. For the first time in a
long time, Stanford is statistically the
underdog.
Of course, the legacy of the Stanford
women's team is immense; the team
regularly produces Olympic and nation
al team players and has gone to the Col
lege Cup in each of the last five years.
Until this year, every member of the
squad had only experienced a Stanford
team that steamrolled its way over
every opponent in the regular season
and throughout the tournament. That
legacy weighs on every single player on
the team, serving as a constant re
minder of what the women can and have
achieved.
Given the different circumstances of
this season, though, everyone on the
team, from the freshmen to the seniors,
will have to learn and adapt in new ways
as they go through the postseason in an
entirely new position. On the one hand,
a single loss finishes not only the sea
son, but ends the seniors' college ca
reers as well. On the other hand, there's
a new sense of freedom from coming in
with an imperfect record.
"It's exciting," said senior forward
and co-captain Courtney Verloo about
experiencing her final postseason. "I
feel like this year is an opportunity un
like any other year based on our season
thus far, and it's kind of a cool feeling to
go in as an underdog with nothing to

SDERlose."
That said, the mentality
on the team going into the
second chapter of the season
is extremely intense; it's do
or die, and making sure that
everyone on the team feels
that sense of urgency is criti
cal to the Cardinal's postsea
son success.
So as the seniors wrap up
their playoff careers and the
freshmen begin theirs, a
sense of postseason mentor
ship has emerged between
the upperclassmen and the
new players.
"I think they just have to
understand and I think
they do now how impor
tant this is, and how different
it is from the regular sea
son," said junior midfielder
and co-captain Alex Doll.
"Everyone's in this together
and we all have one goal, and
that's winning the national
championship ... It's just all
about the team from this
point forward."
The freshman class a
group of eight extremely sol
id players who have seen
quality time on the field this
season clearly recognizes
how different the playoffs
are, and has been learning in
large part through the exam
ple set by the seniors.
"They push us really hard
in practice," said freshman
forward Ryan Walker-
Hartshorn. "They set a real
ly competitive atmosphere."
"It's just a new vibe to
practice and kind of like the
regular season's over now,
and it's all about postsea
son," echoed freshman goal
keeper Jane Campbell, who
has played a critical role this
season after replacing now
retired senior co-captain
Emily Oliver in goal. "The
level is just crazy intense
now, and it's really exciting."
Off the field, the seniors
have also played a big role in
preparing the freshmen for
what lies ahead.
"They help us put it in
perspective," said freshman
midfielder Stephanie Amack,
who was recently named to
the Pac-12 All-Freshman
team. "They definitely re
mind us to enjoy it."
The seniors' most difficult
task is to impress upon the
freshmen just how high the
stakes are in the postseason,
and to convey the exhilara
tion that comes with a na
tional championship. For the
new players, understanding
exactly how different and
potentially euphoric the
playoffs can be is difficult
without having experienced
it. With one game under

their belts, however, the
freshmen are on their way to
finding their rhythm in the
postseason.
For Doll, however, the un
derlying feelings of excite
ment and fire as a senior are
exactly the same as those she
experienced as a freshman.
"[As a freshman,] I be
lieved that we could do it.
Every game I felt like we
could dominate and there
was just no way anyone could
beat us," said Doll. "Just that
sense of belief, I think, is
kind of again what I feel this
year, like we can do this."
Though many unknowns
lie ahead in the playoffs and
further in their careers, this
year's freshman class shares
Doll's sense of absolute be
lief, and is ready to reach the
College Cup.

"It's a new slate and we're
just ready to win them out
win all the games out until
the national championship,"
said freshman defender
Maddie Bauer, who also
earned a place on the Pac-12
All-Freshman team and Sec
ond Team All-Conference.
As far as the seniors are
concerned, the eight fresh
men are well prepared for
the postseason and the many
challenges that come with it.
The group has proved itself
poised and talented all sea
son, and with three of them
starting regularly, they will

certainly continue to play a
big role in the postseason.
Friday, the Cardinal will
travel to Los Angeles for the
second round of the playoffs.
When the freshmen enter
the stadium at UCLA
when their whole world is re
duced to that single game
they'll be ready.
"I think that they'll be
able to handle the pressure
and the excitement just
fine," Oliver said.
