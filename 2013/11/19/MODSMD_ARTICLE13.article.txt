# INSTANT REPLAY
## KILLER INTERCEPTION 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's national championship hopes
disappeared on Saturday night in the Colise
um as Southern California defeated Stan
ford 20-17. USC played well, but even after a
flood of miscues inopportune penalties,
turnovers and poor decisions the Cardi
nal was still in position to drive down the
field for the winning score. However, junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan then threw a de
flected interception to Trojan safety Su'a
Cravens with just 3:03 remaining in the

fourth quarter, and the Trojans took advan
tage of a short field yet again to set up Andre
Heidari's game-winning 47-yard field goal.
Before the interception, Stanford had
plenty of time to set up a game-winning field
goal of its own. The Trojans' run defense had
been ground to bits in the third quarter. Af
ter a solid 8-yard pass to junior wide receiv
er Jordan Pratt had given Stanford a see
ond-and-2 situation at the Stanford 40-yard
line, the Cardinal knew that it could proba
bly run for a first on third down if needed. So


IRENE HSU/The Stanford Daily
Stanford took the opportunity
to throw.
Stanford called two pass
ing concepts, a drive on the
left side and a smash on the
right. The routes in the drive
set a pick downfield, allowing
a Stanford receiver to spring
free, and the short cross was
an outlet for Hogan in case he
had to throw. The smash was
designed to put a bind on the
Trojan cornerback by attack
ing his area with two players,
forcing him to leave a player
open.
I don't normally talk about
pass protection because I
have only so many words in
this column. But here it was
especially critical. Stanford
called a 2-Jet/Frisco protec
tion, a common line call in
David Shaw's West Coast of
fense. This meant that the
center and the left side of
Stanford's line slid left, cover
ing gaps instead of men.
Meanwhile, the right side of
the line did the opposite. This
allowed Stanford to bring help
to the left, where Stanford
was expecting a blitz to Kevin
Hogan's blind side.
The play started inauspi
ciously. USC defensive coordi
nator Clancy Pendergast is a
daring risk-taker with his
blitzes, and Stanford got over
whelmed. Sophomore left
tackle Andrus Peat made a
mistake with his footwork,
ended up in an extremely
wide stance and didn't have
the physical leverage to han
dle USC's weak side defen
sive end. Peat has been very
good this year, so when senior
left guard David Yankey slid
left with him without a threat
in sight, Yankey helped center
Khalil Wilkes with the weak
side tackle instead of Peat,
and by the time he realized
Peat was in trouble, it was too
late.
On the right side of the
line, instead of blitzing the
strong-side end and line
backer (E and S), USC actual
ly jammed senior tight end

David Dudchock (Y), pre
venting him from getting a
clean release and acting as a
safety valve for Hogan. It
didn't matter on paper as
Dudchock was running a cor
ner route to the sideline, but
the jamming delayed Dud
chock and he couldn't get the
necessary depth downfield to
isolate his defender, Cravens
($). This will become more
important later. By taking
senior right tackle Cameron
Fleming's man assignment
out of the blitz, USC also
froze Fleming for a second as
he figured out what was go
ing on, giving the blitzing
middle linebacker (M) a win
dow to get into the backfield.
The key to this play was
the weak side linebacker's
(W) read blitz, the Check-
Rain. If the center pass
blocked to the right, he would
attack the left, in the gap be
tween the occupied left tackle
and guard. If the center pass

blocked to the left, as hap
pened on this play, he would
attack the right, between the
occupied center and right
guard. Either way, W would
be free to rush. Stanford had
anticipated this blitz by using
senior running back Tyler
Gaffney (R) in pass protec
tion, but although Gaffney
read the blitz correctly he
failed in his execution; his
poor footwork and leverage
allowed the W into the back
field anyway.
With three simultaneous
failures, the pocket collapsed
almost immediately and
Kevin Hogan (Q) panicked.
Jordan Pratt (A), Hogan's
safety valve, was wide open on
the crosser for an easy first
down, but Hogan wasn't look
ing at him. Junior wide receiv
er Ty Montgomery (Z) looked
wide open but was ineligible
after being pushed out of
bounds on the comeback.
Hogan, already going down,

desperately chucked a
grenade in Montgomery's
general direction.
Montgomery tried to
reach back for the ball when
he didn't really have a chance
and deflected the ball to
wards Dudchock. And the
ball still would have fallen
harmlessly to the ground if
Dudchock had not been
jammed and taken a more di
rect route to the sideline to
compensate for his poor tim
ing. His route drew Cravens
close to Montgomery and
thus in position to make the
biggest interception of his life.
I don't mean to demean
USC's performance, because
the Trojans still had to exe
cute, and they did. But for
Stanford, this play was a per
fect example of Murphy's
Law: "If it can go wrong, it
will."

chock and he couldn't get the
necessary depth downfield to
isolate his defender, Cravens
($). This will become more
important later. By taking
senior right tackle Cameron
Fleming's man assignment
out of the blitz, USC also
froze Fleming for a second as
he figured out what was go
ing on, giving the blitzing
middle linebacker (M) a win
dow to get into the backfield.
The key to this play was
the weak side linebacker's
(W) read blitz, the Check-
Rain. If the center pass
blocked to the right, he would
attack the left, in the gap be
tween the occupied left tackle
and guard. If the center pass

blocked to the left, as hap
pened on this play, he would
attack the right, between the
occupied center and right
guard. Either way, W would
be free to rush. Stanford had
anticipated this blitz by using
senior running back Tyler
Gaffney (R) in pass protec
tion, but although Gaffney
read the blitz correctly he
failed in his execution; his
poor footwork and leverage
allowed the W into the back
field anyway.
With three simultaneous
failures, the pocket collapsed
almost immediately and
Kevin Hogan (Q) panicked.
Jordan Pratt (A), Hogan's
safety valve, was wide open on
the crosser for an easy first
down, but Hogan wasn't look
ing at him. Junior wide receiv
er Ty Montgomery (Z) looked
wide open but was ineligible
after being pushed out of
bounds on the comeback.
Hogan, already going down,

desperately chucked a
grenade in Montgomery's
general direction.
Montgomery tried to
reach back for the ball when
he didn't really have a chance
and deflected the ball to
wards Dudchock. And the
ball still would have fallen
harmlessly to the ground if
Dudchock had not been
jammed and taken a more di
rect route to the sideline to
compensate for his poor tim
ing. His route drew Cravens
close to Montgomery and
thus in position to make the
biggest interception of his life.
I don't mean to demean
USC's performance, because
the Trojans still had to exe
cute, and they did. But for
Stanford, this play was a per
fect example of Murphy's
Law: "If it can go wrong, it
will."

Stanford's national championship hopes
disappeared on Saturday night in the Colise
um as Southern California defeated Stan
ford 20-17. USC played well, but even after a
flood of miscues inopportune penalties,
turnovers and poor decisions the Cardi
nal was still in position to drive down the
field for the winning score. However, junior
quarterback Kevin Hogan then threw a de
flected interception to Trojan safety Su'a
Cravens with just 3:03 remaining in the

fourth quarter, and the Trojans took advan
tage of a short field yet again to set up Andre
Heidari's game-winning 47-yard field goal.
Before the interception, Stanford had
plenty of time to set up a game-winning field
goal of its own. The Trojans' run defense had
been ground to bits in the third quarter. Af
ter a solid 8-yard pass to junior wide receiv
er Jordan Pratt had given Stanford a see
ond-and-2 situation at the Stanford 40-yard
line, the Cardinal knew that it could proba
bly run for a first on third down if needed. So


IRENE HSU/The Stanford Daily
Stanford took the opportunity
to throw.
Stanford called two pass
ing concepts, a drive on the
left side and a smash on the
right. The routes in the drive
set a pick downfield, allowing
a Stanford receiver to spring
free, and the short cross was
an outlet for Hogan in case he
had to throw. The smash was
designed to put a bind on the
Trojan cornerback by attack
ing his area with two players,
forcing him to leave a player
open.
I don't normally talk about
pass protection because I
have only so many words in
this column. But here it was
especially critical. Stanford
called a 2-Jet/Frisco protec
tion, a common line call in
David Shaw's West Coast of
fense. This meant that the
center and the left side of
Stanford's line slid left, cover
ing gaps instead of men.
Meanwhile, the right side of
the line did the opposite. This
allowed Stanford to bring help
to the left, where Stanford
was expecting a blitz to Kevin
Hogan's blind side.
The play started inauspi
ciously. USC defensive coordi
nator Clancy Pendergast is a
daring risk-taker with his
blitzes, and Stanford got over
whelmed. Sophomore left
tackle Andrus Peat made a
mistake with his footwork,
ended up in an extremely
wide stance and didn't have
the physical leverage to han
dle USC's weak side defen
sive end. Peat has been very
good this year, so when senior
left guard David Yankey slid
left with him without a threat
in sight, Yankey helped center
Khalil Wilkes with the weak
side tackle instead of Peat,
and by the time he realized
Peat was in trouble, it was too
late.
On the right side of the
line, instead of blitzing the
strong-side end and line
backer (E and S), USC actual
ly jammed senior tight end

David Dudchock (Y), pre
venting him from getting a
clean release and acting as a
safety valve for Hogan. It
didn't matter on paper as
Dudchock was running a cor
ner route to the sideline, but
the jamming delayed Dud
chock and he couldn't get the
necessary depth downfield to
isolate his defender, Cravens
($). This will become more
important later. By taking
