## SUPER TUESDAY Securing Social Security 
### Marshal Watkins 
The "third rail" of American
politics is certainly well
known. Social Security—
along with Medicare and Medicaid,
the other major entitlement pro
grams has served as the "essen
tial" government program for more
than 70 years. It serves as a lifeline
for Americans older than 65, rais
ing an estimated 14 million of them
above the poverty line. And be
cause it's essential to so many, but
also so woefully expensive and inef
ficient — it's in desperate need of
reform.
From the very start, Social Se
curity was intended to be a more
limited program than the one we
have today. Back in 1937, the aver
age life expectancy was just 58
years the entitlement program
as first conceived was catering to a
small subset of the population who,
even if they had reached 65, likely
wouldn't live much past it. Today,
the average American can expect to
live almost 79 years, and those who
reach age 65 can expect to live an
other 19 years for men and another
21 for women. While there were 4.9
workers per Social Security benefi
ciary in 1960, that ratio was 2.8:1 as
of 2010 and is projected to further
deteriorate to 1.9:1 in 2035.
The impact of those demograph
ic trends on the viability of Social
Security going forward is both sub
stantial and concerning. Spending
on Social Security and Medicare
currently totals around $1.34 tril
lion, or 38 percent of federal expen
ditures. The Social Security pro
gram has operated at a loss since
2010, and will continue to do so
producing ever larger deficits
into the foreseeable future. By
2038, the program will have ex
hausted its trust funds altogether.
Commonsense reforms are a
good place to start. Raising the re
tirement age from 65 to 70 in a
staggered manner until 2040, for
example, would reduce total Social
Security outlays by 6 percent over
current projections by that year.
Reducing cost-of-living adjust
ments by 0.5 percentage points per
annum would reduce total outlays
by 7 percent by 2040, and employ
ing the chained consumer price in

dex measurement of inflation could
attain a similar effect.
Being smarter about who re
ceives benefits is equally valuable.
Social Security was originally in
tended as a means of lifting the eld
erly out of poverty during the De
pression era. That objective still
has exceptional merit for those 14
million Americans who rely on So
cial Security to lift them out of
poverty, but means-testing the pro
gram reducing benefits to those
who, quite frankly, don't need them
could extend the life of the trust
for years, according to the Con
gressional Budget Office.
Of course, such reforms are at
best marginal in impact, postpon
ing rather than averting altogether
the fiscal reckoning. Hiking taxes
to pay for projected entitlement
spending increases including
those expected for Medicare and
Medicaid would likely impose a
burden on affluent Americans be
yond that already exacted by the
OECD's most progressive tax sys
tem. Instead, it makes more sense
to fundamentally reassess what
Americans receive from a funda
mentally unsustainable program.
That reassessment should start
with transitioning from seeking to
replicate income levels unsus
tainable given rising personal in
comes and additionally damaging
by discouraging savings to pro
viding a basic supplement that
averts poverty throughout retire
ment, and with supporting initia
tives that promote independent fis
cal responsibility and savings by
workers today by incentivizing
them to keep tomorrow in mind too.
Social Security, by most ac
counts, will not be accountable for
most of the projected growth in en
titlements spending. From the Af
fordable Care Act to Medicare and
Medicaid, America has become ac
customed to programs that simply
aren't sustainable over the long
run. Touching the third rail of
American politics and living to
tell the tale is, however, a good
place to start.
