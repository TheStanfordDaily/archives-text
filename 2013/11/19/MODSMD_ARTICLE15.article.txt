## Securing Social Security

TTTe fumbled the rollout
l/l / of this health care
V V law," President Obama
admitted last week. He added, "I
am not a perfect man and I will not
be a perfect president." As critics
on the right and on the left attack
the Affordable Care Act, it's impor
tant to examine our more success
ful entitlement programs: Social
Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
Enacted in 1935 and implement
ed in 1937, the Social Security Act
came at a time of hardship for eld
erly Americans. Far more than 50
percent of people over the age of 65
were in poverty during the 19305.
When the benefits began being dis
tributed after five years of legisla

tive rollout, life expectancy at 65
was about 12 years for men and
about 13 for women. That's if you
made it to 65.
The first checked was issued on
Jan. 31, 1940, to Ida May Fuller in
the amount of $22.54, or about $375
in today's currency. However, Ida
was a rarity; when Social Security
was launched, barely half of the la
bor force participated. Only $35
million ($583 million in 2013) was
paid out in 1940. That's chump
change for today's budget of $1.3
trillion. Some said the rollout was
fumbled.
Today, we can boast that 14 mil
lion Americans aged 65 or older are
raised above the federal poverty

line by Social Security. And for 24
percent of elderly citizens, Social
Security checks serve as their only
source of income.
Between Social Security and
Medicare, we spent $1.34 trillion, or
about 38 percent of federal expen
ditures, in 2012.
Yet, 12 percent of people over 65
are still in poverty. And nearly 20
percent of the country at large
earns less than those at the poverty
line. If that doesn't make you un
comfortable, consider that 27 per
cent of children are in poverty.
We can do better and we should
do better: We're no longer in 1935
or 1965; Social Security and
Medicare need to be updated.
Our entitlement programs
should fit the times we live in. Life
expectancy at 65 now is 17 years for
men and more than 19 for women.

Those figures are expected to rise
to 19 and 21 by 2035. Thirty-eight
percent of men and 28.1 percent of
women aged 62-74 are employed, as
of 2009. Those figures were 27.3
percent and 16.9 percent just 20
years ago.
That's why our first action
should be to raise the retirement
age. The Congressional Budget Of
fice lays out a number of policy op
tions to improve the longevity of
the Social Security trust, including
options for raising the full retire
ment age (FRA). Setting the FRA
to 70 could proceed over 18 years,
finishing in 2040. Not only would an
FRA of 70 in 2040 correspond to
the change in life expectancy since
1940, it would also decrease pro
jected Social Security spending by
6 percent, saving $5B billion over
the next 10 years alone.

Our largely service economy
does not take the same physical toll
that manufacturing and agriculture
did when these programs were de
signed. Yet, 39 percent of workers
ages 50 to 61 are in physically de
manding jobs. That's why I propose
a tiered Social Security program.
Workers in blue-collar jobs can ap
ply for benefits at an earlier age,
such as at 60. White-collar employ
ees, who don't bear the same phys
ical hardship, can work until the
FRA at 70.
Another much-needed update is
to add a means-tested aspect, mak
ing the program progressive. Un
like in 1935, many people can now
afford to plan for retirement. We
should not be obligated to support
them when they can support them
selves. Under the CBO's plan, low
ering benefits for the top 50 per
cent of income earners would ex
tend the life of the trust by four
years.
Lastly, Social Security benefits
should fulfill the roll they were de
signed for. Currently, benefits are
tied to wages, which have increased
faster than prices. Social Security
was not intended to account for
promotions and bonuses one would
receive in the workforce; it was de
signed to make sure seniors could
buy food and shelter. Linking bene
fits to price inflation would still al
low them to do that, but would also
save, over the next 10 years, $57.5
billion if done progressively and
$93.4 billion if implemented "pure
ly."
Perhaps ironically, Ida May
Fuller lived to be 100 and collected
$22,888.92 from the Social Security
Administration, despite contribut
ing only $24.75. As more and more
people like Ida retire, the need to
take concrete steps becomes more
urgent.
As we take these steps, however,
let us pay homage to the great good
they've done for seniors and for the
country. Let us also note that it
took decades to recognize them as
successes. Obamacare is no differ
ent; all large programs need time to
grow.
