# DANCING AGAIN
## 
### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the words of the Arctic
Monkeys, get on your danc
ing shoes. Early Monday
morning, Stanford men's soc
cer (9-6-3, 3-5-2 Pac-12)
clinched an at-large berth to
the NCAA tournament, secur
ing a home match against West
Coast Conference (WCC)
champion Loyola Marymount
(13-4-2,9-2-1 WCC).
The berth marks the Car
dinal's 10th appearance in the
tournament and its first since
2009. The at-large invite was
most likely secured though a
thrilling 2-1 overtime victory
against California last
Wednesday, which shored up
the Cardinal's profile and gave

the selection committee no
other option but to extend the
invitation.
Loyola Marymount, how
ever, will look to build upon
what has been a very success
ful season. The Lions cap
tured the WCC crown and fin
ished with an impressive 13-4-
2 record. They are paced by
the stellar play of freshman
midfielder Adrien Perez, who
notched a conference leading
eight goals, and junior mid
fielder John McFarlin, who
has 10 assists on the season.
The Lions lead the WCC in
all relevant statistical cate
gories, including goals, assists,
goals against average and
shutouts, which would seem to
indicate a complete domination
of league play. The matchup

will also be a return home for
LMU's sophomore goalkeeper
Peter Blanchette, who hails
from Palo Alto and attended
Gunn High School, just down
the road from the Farm.
However, the Cardinal has
some danger men of its own
who will be looking to secure
the Cardinal's passage to the
next round. Forwards Zach
Batteer and Jordan Morris, a
junior and freshman respec
tively, have combined for a to
tal of 14 goals and 10 assists on
the year. Sophomore winger
Aaron Kovar, who scored the
crucial winner against Cal, has
two goals and five assists to
his name and will hope to
cause the Lions' right back
problems on Thursday and
build on his recent success.
While the Cardinal may
not have been an automatic
qualifier, it played in what was
unanimously considered to be
the toughest conference in the
country. The Pac-12 contains
three of the top four seeds in
the tournament, and Stanford
will look to use its experience
playing against the best teams
in Division I to good use as it
prepares to take its first step
toward the College Cup.
While it is always difficult
to predict the outcome of a
knockout competition, one
thing is for certain. Both
teams, having returned to the
tournament after three-year
absences, will do everything in
them power to secure just one
more match.
The Cardinal now looks
forward to Thursday at 7 p.m.
at Cagan Stadium, where it
will hope to win and advance
to the round of 32, booking a
date with 15th-seeded Cal
State Northridge.
