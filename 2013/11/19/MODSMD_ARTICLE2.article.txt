## Santa Clara County health officials determine norovirus is likely cause 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The Santa Clara County Public
Health Department has officially
completed its investigation on the
cause of the gastrointestinal ill
ness that afflicted students in Flo
rence Moore Hall (FloMo) late Oc
tober. No conclusions were drawn
on the original source of the out
break, but health officials state
norovirus was likely the cause.
"We know the county did an ex
haustive investigation, but some
times it's not possible to get an ex
act source," said Lisa Lapin, Uni
versity spokeswoman.
Between the afternoon of Oct.
29 and Nov. 5, a total of 62 resi
dents from FloMo two of whom
were faculty reported stomach
flu-like symptoms, including vom
iting and in some cases, diarrhea,
Lapin said. Seven students were
eventually treated at Stanford
Hospital for dehydration and re
leased.
These numbers do not include
the cases of the same symptoms of
illness in Wilbur Hall. However, it
cannot be assumed these cases
were spread from the FloMo cas
es, said Ira Friedman, director of
Vaden Health Center, who empha
sized that norovirus is extremely
common at this time of year.
Shortly after the outbreak, the
county public health department
began a weeklong investigation to

determine the cause and detail an
exposure history of the gastroin
testinal illness. This investigation
included a remotely-run exposure
history survey, an attempt at ac
quiring stool samples and an in
person survey of the FloMo resi
dences, said Cornell.
More than 200 residents par
ticipated in the survey, which col
lected information from both
healthy and sick students. Admin
istered by the county public health
department, the survey included
questions that asked about recent
food exposures as well as the
symptoms and time of onset of ill
ness. The survey did not produce
conclusive results that could iden
tify the source of the norovirus
like illness, and the county could
acquire any positive specimen.
"We were hoping to get sam
ples from some of the students but
were not able to get any," said
Sarah Cody, Santa Clara County
health official. "After everyone got
ill, we made plans early to collect
stool samples but after that, no
one came in and we did not end up
getting a specimen."
However, the symptoms associ
ated with the gastrointestinal ill
ness matched very well with
norovirus, and the county closed
its investigation concluding that
the illness was likely due to
norovirus.
During the outbreak, the coun
ty also focused on preventative

measures to stop a secondary
spread of the suspected virus;
however, according to Cody, the
illness was already well contained.
"It was remarkable, the lack of
secondary spread made me really
wonder whether it was actually
norovirus," Cody said.
Friedman attributes this con

tainment to the "early warning
reporting system" that was al
ready in place in all the dorms
through the peer health educators
(PHEs) in the dormitories. Dur
ing training, all PHEs are taught
to report illnesses and the symp
toms associated with them as soon
as possible.

"What was unique about Stan
ford was the early warning system
in place and that the control meas
ures that were implemented right
away," Cody said. "It was a luxury
to come into the situation where
everyone was already on top of


NATALIE CHENG/The Stanford Daily
things. And I'm assuming
that's what got it under con
trol so fast."
To date, there are no
more reported cases of gas
trointestinal illness, Fried
man said. Additionally, jani
torial cleaning at FloMo has
returned to normal, back
from the two-shift cleaning
periods implemented to san
itize the dorm facilities.
