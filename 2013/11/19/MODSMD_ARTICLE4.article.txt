Professor Franklin "Lynn" Orr is the director

discuss his nomination by President Obama to
serve as the under secretary for science at the U.S.

Franklin "Lynn" Orr (FO): The official notifi

TSD: You've been nominated as the under sec

FO: Within the Department of Energy, there's
an office of science, and what it does is to provide
support for scientific research.... They are also in

provide user facilities for scientists around the
country, so SLAC is one of those for example...

United States. But remember that each of these
programs has their own assistant secretary who
really has a lot to deal with as well, so this kind of
