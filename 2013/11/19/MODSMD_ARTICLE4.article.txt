# Q&A FRANKLIN "LYNN" ORR
## DIRECTOR OF THE PRECOURT INSTITUTE FOR ENERGY 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD DESK EDITOR 
Professor Franklin "Lynn" Orr is the director
of the Precourt Institute for Energy and previous
ly served as the director of Stanford's Global Cli
mate and Energy Project from 2002 to 2008, as
well as the Chester Naramore dean of earth sci
ences from 1994 to 2002. He is currently a senior
fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment.
The Stanford Daily recently sat down with Orr to
discuss his nomination by President Obama to
serve as the under secretary for science at the U.S.
Department of Energy.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Congratulations
on your nomination. When were you notified?
Franklin "Lynn" Orr (FO): The official notifi
cation was with the press release from the White
House on Thursday afternoon, but I had a little
warning that that was going to happen.
TSD: You've been nominated as the under sec

retary for science at the U.S. Department of Ener
gy. What exactly does that position entail?
FO: Within the Department of Energy, there's
an office of science, and what it does is to provide
support for scientific research.... They are also in
volved with many of the national laboratories that
provide user facilities for scientists around the
country, so SLAC is one of those for example...
You can think of it as the under secretary who
looks after the energy research program for the
United States. But remember that each of these
programs has their own assistant secretary who
really has a lot to deal with as well, so this kind of

a position that works with all
of the assistant secretaries.
TSD: What do you see as
the main challenges that the
Department of Energy faces
today?
FO: The challenge we
have to face is that we need
to supply the energy that
people need to live comfort
able and productive lives.
Energy is woven completely
through the fabric of modern
societies. We live in a place
like this where we are so for
tunate to really have all the
energy we need and at a rea
sonable price, but that's not
true for everybody in the
world, so working on ways to
supply energy in a secure
and reliable way, to supply
energy in way that is better
balanced with the planetary
systems.... At the same
time, doing it in way that we
can afford so the econom
ic side of things as well.

TSD: Assuming that you
are confirmed into the role
as under secretary, how
would you hope to accom
plish these goals? How
would that play out?
FO: The Department of
Energy has a whole lot of re
ally talented people there,
and the national laboratories
around the country. Part of
the job is figuring out how to
use all those assets as effec
tively as we can, and part of
it is supporting the research
that is done in lots of aca
demic institutions around
the country. Both of those
functions are very impor
tant.
TSD: In the past, you
were dean of the School of
Earth Sciences, founding di
rector of the Global Climate
and Energy Project, and
you currently lead the Pre
court Institute for Energy.
Where did your passion for
environment and energy
come from?
FO: At the very begin
ning of my career I worked
for the Environmental Pro
tection Agency, and I

worked on the implementa
tion of the Clean Air Act,
which had just passed in
1970. That was largely about
air pollution and those kinds
of things, but it stuck with
me over the years and I've
spent my whole career
working on energy in some
ways.
Part of it was oil recovery
getting oil out of the
ground; part of it was push
ing high pressure [carbon
dioxide] back into the
ground, and then in the last
decade or thereabouts, it's
very much been about how
do we supply the energy
that the world needs but at
the same time, reduce im
pacts like carbon emissions
and other air pollution. So in
one way or another, I've re
ally spent my whole career
working in related areas.
TSD: Assuming again
that you are accepted in to
the under secretary posi
tion, you will have to step
down from your role at
Stanford. What do you think
you'll miss most about Stan
ford?

FO: I think what I'll miss
the most is teaching my
classes. I'm actually teach
ing an energy class with a
couple of colleagues this
quarter as part of Thinking
Matters it's just such fun.
And then I teach my other
classes for graduate stu
dents as well. I just know for
a fact that I'm going to miss
that part a whole lot. They'll
be plenty of chances in
Washington to think about
energy matters but I don't
think I'll be teaching any
Stanford students there.

true for everybody in the
world, so working on ways to
supply energy in a secure
and reliable way, to supply
energy in way that is better
balanced with the planetary
systems.... At the same
time, doing it in way that we
can afford so the econom
ic side of things as well.

TSD: Assuming that you
are confirmed into the role
as under secretary, how
would you hope to accom
plish these goals? How
would that play out?
FO: The Department of
Energy has a whole lot of re
ally talented people there,
and the national laboratories
around the country. Part of
the job is figuring out how to
use all those assets as effec
tively as we can, and part of
it is supporting the research
that is done in lots of aca
demic institutions around
the country. Both of those
functions are very impor
tant.
TSD: In the past, you
were dean of the School of
Earth Sciences, founding di
rector of the Global Climate
and Energy Project, and
you currently lead the Pre
court Institute for Energy.
Where did your passion for
environment and energy
come from?
FO: At the very begin
ning of my career I worked
for the Environmental Pro
tection Agency, and I

worked on the implementa
tion of the Clean Air Act,
which had just passed in
1970. That was largely about
air pollution and those kinds
of things, but it stuck with
me over the years and I've
spent my whole career
working on energy in some
ways.
Part of it was oil recovery
getting oil out of the
ground; part of it was push
ing high pressure [carbon
dioxide] back into the
ground, and then in the last
decade or thereabouts, it's
very much been about how
do we supply the energy
that the world needs but at
the same time, reduce im
pacts like carbon emissions
and other air pollution. So in
one way or another, I've re
ally spent my whole career
working in related areas.
TSD: Assuming again
that you are accepted in to
the under secretary posi
tion, you will have to step
down from your role at
Stanford. What do you think
you'll miss most about Stan
ford?

FO: I think what I'll miss
the most is teaching my
classes. I'm actually teach
ing an energy class with a
couple of colleagues this
quarter as part of Thinking
Matters it's just such fun.
And then I teach my other
classes for graduate stu
dents as well. I just know for
a fact that I'm going to miss
that part a whole lot. They'll
be plenty of chances in
Washington to think about
energy matters but I don't
think I'll be teaching any
Stanford students there.

Professor Franklin "Lynn" Orr is the director
of the Precourt Institute for Energy and previous
ly served as the director of Stanford's Global Cli
mate and Energy Project from 2002 to 2008, as
well as the Chester Naramore dean of earth sci
ences from 1994 to 2002. He is currently a senior
fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment.
The Stanford Daily recently sat down with Orr to
discuss his nomination by President Obama to
serve as the under secretary for science at the U.S.
Department of Energy.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Congratulations
on your nomination. When were you notified?
Franklin "Lynn" Orr (FO): The official notifi
cation was with the press release from the White
House on Thursday afternoon, but I had a little
warning that that was going to happen.
TSD: You've been nominated as the under sec

retary for science at the U.S. Department of Ener
gy. What exactly does that position entail?
FO: Within the Department of Energy, there's
an office of science, and what it does is to provide
support for scientific research.... They are also in
volved with many of the national laboratories that
provide user facilities for scientists around the
country, so SLAC is one of those for example...
You can think of it as the under secretary who
looks after the energy research program for the
United States. But remember that each of these
programs has their own assistant secretary who
really has a lot to deal with as well, so this kind of

a position that works with all
of the assistant secretaries.
TSD: What do you see as
the main challenges that the
Department of Energy faces
today?
FO: The challenge we
have to face is that we need
to supply the energy that
people need to live comfort
able and productive lives.
Energy is woven completely
through the fabric of modern
societies. We live in a place
like this where we are so for
tunate to really have all the
energy we need and at a rea
sonable price, but that's not
true for everybody in the
world, so working on ways to
supply energy in a secure
and reliable way, to supply
energy in way that is better
balanced with the planetary
systems.... At the same
