# Cal bear 'bearied,' impaled again
##

Dressed in black, the Leland
Stanford Junior University March
ing Band (LSJUMB) walked slowly
toward the Claw, holding a wooden
casket containing a lifeless stuffed
bear. The band members were on
their way to the Bearial, a funeral
for the Cal bear mascot, Oski.
After a eulogy filled with laughs
and a recitation of a satirical tale of
the origins of the Cal and Stanford
rivalry and how Stanford is obvi
ously better the bear was im
paled on the highest peak of the
fountain, warm red dye spluttering
out of its defeated heart.

In a Big Game Week tradition, the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band held a funeral service for Cal's bear
mascot, Oski, at the Claw. Oski will remain impaled this week.
