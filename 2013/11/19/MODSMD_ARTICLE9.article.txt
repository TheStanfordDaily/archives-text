# Stanford researchers invent self-healing battery

### – Catherine Zaw 
A team of researchers from Stanford
University and the Department of Ener
gy's SLAC National Accelerator Labo
ratory has developed a self-healing bat
tery electrode, the first of its kind for
lithium ion batteries.
The self-renewing battery contains a
silicon electrode that is protected by a
stretchy polymer, which not only holds
the battery together but also fills in the
tiny cracks that may develop during bat
tery operation, essentially allowing the
battery to heal itself.
A flexible battery coating is particu
larly important for batteries with silicon
electrodes —which have a high capacity
for capturing and storing energy from
lithium battery fluid because silicon
electrodes expand and shrink each time
the battery charges and discharges. The
brittle material that coats these high-ca
pacity batteries therefore cracks and
falls apart with use. With a self-healing
coating, these batteries can last longer
and lose performance less quickly.
The self-healing material original
ly developed by third-year postdoctoral
researcher Chao Wang in the lab of
Zhenan Bao, a professor of chemical en
gineering at Stanford breaks easily to
accommodate for a growing electrode.
Its broken ends quickly bond together
again, in a manner similar to the process
that allows biological molecules such as
DNA to reassemble.
