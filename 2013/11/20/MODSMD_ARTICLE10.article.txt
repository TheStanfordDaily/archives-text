## Huskies seek a sweep Card hopes for key upset 
### JORDAN WALLACH STAFF WRITER 
With pride and possibly the
Pac-12 Championship hanging
in the balance, Stanford women's
volleyball will host Washington
tonight and, in doing so, hopes
to avoid dropping both regular
season games to the Huskies for
the first time since 2005.
The No. 5 Cardinal (20-5,13-
3 Pac-12) will enter this revenge
match on a five-match winning
streak with its highest ranking
in the AYCA Coaches' Poll since
Sept. 2. Though Stanford has
been adding to the win column
over its recent stretch, the team
has hit just .272 over its last five
matches, compared to a .317
mark over its first 20 matches of
the season. While this certainly
is not cause for panic as the
team still leads the Pac-12 in hit
ting, the Cardinal has been
working on improving its offen
sive efficiency in recent prac
tices.
"When you see a problem
with hitting percentage, it can
be a lot of things, from a lack of
focus to not being able to dis
tribute our offense as well," said
sophomore outside hitter Jor
dan Burgess. "To improve on
that, we've been working a lot of
different types of sets in prac
tice. It comes down to passing."
Meanwhile, No. 3 Washing
ton (23-1,15-1) is coming off of a
win against then-No. 4 USC at
home and is currently riding a
13-match win streak, having
dropped just eight sets during
that stretch. The Huskies, de
spite not having received any
first-place votes in the presea
son Pac-12 Coaches Poll, lead
the conference by two games
over the Cardinal and are hav
ing arguably their best season
since their 2005 National Cham
pionship run.
The match will feature
both the Pac-12's reigning
offensive and defensive play
ers of the week. For the
Huskies, junior outside hit
ter Krista Vansant earned
the offensive honor her
third such honor of the year

after hitting .382 and av
eraging 5.00 kills per set in
Washington's two matches
this past weekend. The
Southern California native
ranks sixth and fourth in the
conference with 4.14 kills per
set and 4.83 points per set
this season, respectively. She
will be a key to the match for
the Huskies, as her season
highs in both kills (23) and
digs (20) came in the
Huskies' Oct. 20 match

against Stanford.
Meanwhile, Cardinal sen
ior middle blocker Carly
Wopat earned the defensive
award, as she recorded her
first double-double of the
season against Oregon with
10 kills and a season-high 12
blocks. She added 13 kills
and two blocks against Ore
gon State on Sunday.
The five-set match be
tween these two teams in Oc
tober was a back-and-forth

thriller with 23 tie scores and
nine lead changes. Unforced
errors including 11 serv
ice errors plagued the
Cardinal throughout. One
reason why the team is confi
dent heading into tonight's
tussle is that it knows it will
be better from behind the
service line.
"As a team, we've been
working a ton on serving
about 30 minutes of every
practice is devoted just to
serving," said Burgess, who
recorded three of the Card's
season-high nine service
aces on Sunday against Ore
gon State.
While the Cardinal would
still need help to have a
chance at the conference ti
tle even with a victory over
Washington, a win could cer
tainly make things interest
ing down the stretch. First
serve is set for 7:30 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion, and the
match will be televised on
Pae-12 Networks.
