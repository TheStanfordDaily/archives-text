## Huskies seek a sweep Card hopes for key upset 
### JORDAN WALLACH STAFF WRITER 
With pride and possibly the
Pac-12 Championship hanging
in the balance, Stanford women's
volleyball will host Washington
tonight and, in doing so, hopes
to avoid dropping both regular
season games to the Huskies for
the first time since 2005.
The No. 5 Cardinal (20-5,13-
3 Pac-12) will enter this revenge
match on a five-match winning
streak with its highest ranking
in the AYCA Coaches' Poll since
Sept. 2. Though Stanford has
been adding to the win column
over its recent stretch, the team
has hit just .272 over its last five
matches, compared to a .317
mark over its first 20 matches of
the season. While this certainly
is not cause for panic as the
team still leads the Pac-12 in hit
ting, the Cardinal has been
working on improving its offen
sive efficiency in recent prac
tices.
"When you see a problem
with hitting percentage, it can
be a lot of things, from a lack of
focus to not being able to dis
tribute our offense as well," said
sophomore outside hitter Jor
dan Burgess. "To improve on
that, we've been working a lot of
different types of sets in prac
tice. It comes down to passing."
Meanwhile, No. 3 Washing
ton (23-1,15-1) is coming off of a
win against then-No. 4 USC at
home and is currently riding a
13-match win streak, having
dropped just eight sets during
that stretch. The Huskies, de
spite not having received any
first-place votes in the presea
son Pac-12 Coaches Poll, lead
the conference by two games
over the Cardinal and are hav
ing arguably their best season
since their 2005 National Cham
pionship run.
