## SEEING GREEN Who's Serving Whom? 
### Holly Moeller 
More than thirty years after
its namesake's eruption,
the Mount St. Helens Na
tional Volcanic Monument is still a
striking landscape. When the vol
cano erupted in 1980, its blast
knocked down trees 19 miles away,
spreading ash for hundreds of
miles. Its flows were, in places, up
to 130 feet thick - deep enough to
bury Stanford's Memorial Church
with 50 feet to spare. The sound of
the explosion was heard as far away
as Canada.
As Dad and I stood at the edge
of the Monument surveying the
damage, I was struck by just how
far away the volcano seemed. At
my feet lay a segment of the 143-
square-mile "blow-down zone",
with all its fallen tree trunks per
fectly arrayed in lines pointing
away from the mountain toward
me, just as they had fallen three
decades before. Interspersed with
the slowly decaying logs, a new
generation of trees was slowly
staking its claim.
But if I turned to my left, where
Monument lands met National
Forest ones, I saw a forest that, at
first glance, looked almost intact,
albeit young, and altogether un
cluttered by the fallen logs of an
eruption 30 years past.
A nearby sign explained the dif
ference. Or rather, explained the
monumental efforts undertaken
by the United States Forest Serv
ice to restore the damaged area, a
feat they accomplished mostly
within five years of the initial
eruption, before Mount St. Helens
had fully quieted from the blast.
The signage was full of statistics
about the value of the extracted
timber, and the next generation of
trees, to the local economy, point
ing to "the slower pace of recov
ery" on National Monument lands
as a counterpoint to its argument
for human intervention.
Of course, that "slower pace"
represents Nature taking its
course. Under the hands-off policy
of the National Park Service,
Mount St. Helens' recovery has
been the subject of numerous im
portant scientific studies that have
helped us to understand life's re
silience and inherent ability to re
bound from disturbance.
Side-by-side though they are
geographically, the two neighbor
ing management perspectives rep
resent fundamentally differing
views on the interaction between
humankind and nature: those who
view nature as being in the service
of mankind, versus those who be
lieve mankind should operate in
the service of nature.
The former is a valid and ap-

plied opinion, perfectly in line with
the Forest Service's commitment
to "serving people." It's both evo
lutionarily and logically reason
able for humanity to look out for
its own best interests. And we've
performed remarkable feats and
built mighty civilizations using our
ability to manipulate and harness
nature.
The latter, however, is the opin
ion I share. And that's because,
when I stood before Mount St. He
lens, I felt small and insignificant,
sure that I had no right to com
mand control over any aspect of
this landscape. And because I'm
curious about how nature gets
things done: how all the parts fit
themselves together and how long
they can stay that way.
Regardless of ethical beliefs
about the value of one's own
species compared to others,
though, there is one clear bottom
line.
Humanity has existed as a part
of nature for millennia.
The influence this existence has
had on nature has varied across
space and time, from feather-light
touches at the edges of human
habitation, to landscape revolu
tions transforming forests into
croplands and meadows into
schoolyards.
While we understand a great
deal about this influence today
thanks to satellite imagery and
global monitoring programs, we
know surprisingly little about the
extent of human activity prior to
the last few hundred years.
What is clear, though, is that

we're currently straining the plan
et to its breaking point. While ar
guments in favor of conservation
for nature's sake may be a luxury
of the well-off, it's also true that
humanity cannot exist in isolation.
We require our planetary life
support systems: the hydrologic
cycle that replenishes our drinking

water, the microbial activity that
processes our waste, the plants that
recycle our carbon dioxide into
breathable oxygen. We have only a
limited ability to replace these
processes with technological solu
tions, and even these have relied on
nature for their inspiration.
We must learn the meaning of

moderation if we plan to survive as
a species. Understanding the de
gree to which our activities can be
sustained - and then sticking to
these limits - will be the true meas
ure of our humanity.
