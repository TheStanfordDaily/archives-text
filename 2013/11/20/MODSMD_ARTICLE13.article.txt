## What is the Point of Dwelling in the Humanities? 
### â€“ Quyen Nguyen '16 
A professor at Stanford recent
ly advised me to stay away
from majoring in Comparative
Literature because it would not lead
to any lucrative jobs outside of acade
mia. Being the pro-humanities advo
cate that I am, I was not only shocked
and infuriated by this inane remark
but also even more disillusioned
about elite higher education today.
In this technology- and cash-driv
en modern age, I understand why a
lot of my peers are aspiring comput
er scientists, engineers or econo
mists. Getting a tangible, "technical"
major seems like the "sensible"
thing to do, and yet I have struggled
to deal with this reality.
I love literature. Wresting with
great texts, getting my heart broken
by a Dostoevsky line or sighing my
afternoon away with Du Fu are a few
things I would like to do on a daily
basis.
The problem is that those activi
ties neither translate directly into a
six-figure occupation nor spell out
'success' the way most people like to
define it. I am terrified of being that
Stanford graduate who spends years
crafting some lofty novel just to real
ize that maybe getting a job as an ac
countant is more realistic.
So I recently went to my meeting
with my so-called "pre-major advi
sor" (PMA), this emotional baggage
sagging on my back, hoping he
would at least have wise things to
say to alleviate my stress about find
ing a major.
To leave his name undisclosed, I
will start calling this person Mr.
PMA. Sitting in his chair with a mag
nanimous smile, Mr. PMA told me
first thing that Comparative Litera
ture would sound too academic on
my CV

Defending my hurt ego, I mum
bled something about how, despite
being a theoretical field, CompLit
could connect me with other disci
plines. Life is really about being sen
sitive to those myriad perspectives
anyway, isn't it? Well no, Mr. PMA
asserted. He had been "a hirer" be
fore, and CompLit definitely did not
sound great on resumes.
He then went on to tell me that
he was an English major in college,
but soon realized that writing novels
was not a financially sound idea. In
stead, he stalled to train for journal
ism. Today, he writes for foreign af
fairs magazines and actually has
managed to fulfill his college dream
by publishing on the side.
This professional journalist and
writer basically told me that I should
not major in something that I love
because it was not job-friendly.
Needless to say, I walked out of
Mr. PMAs office with a heart heavier
and more burdened than the mo
ment I walked in. Were my parents
right after all? Should I major in
something simply because it is in
strumental in getting a good job?
The point, as Adam Gopnik said
in his recent talk at Stanford, is that
we choose the humanities because
ultimately we are human. Human
beings will never stop making and
discussing art, whether it is an exhil
arating Games of Thrones episode or
a dense Proust volume in FYench. It
is an urge, a fervent calling.
Therefore, if some people decide
to brand themselves with a humani
ties major badge just to get an edge
in the job recruitment process later,
I would argue that they would soon
regret this inauthentic attitude.
The same goes for engineering.
The number of undergraduate ma

jors in engineering is said to have
tripled in the last five years. The
naive, hopeful part of me would like
to believe that all Stanford graduat
ing engineers majored in Computer
Science, Management Science & En
gineering and other great engineer
ing disciplines because they enjoyed
studying it and want to change the
world with their expertise. The real
ity is that a lot of my friends feel
pressured to major in engineering
because of external influences.
Of course, I am only speaking
from my limited conversations with
friends on campus, but I know for a
fact that a few of my anguished
friends who actually are secret po
ets, painters, beatboxers, musicians
and multimedia artists end up giving
up on the "useless" humanities and
enrolling in large engineering lec
tures where they fall asleep or skip
altogether.
As for myself, a firmly undecided
major who loves art and literature, I
still have no answer on what I want
to do. I know one thing for sure: I
cannot blindly follow my PMA's
highly pragmatic and spiritually
empty advice to compete for presti
gious internships in the hope of at
taining some well-paid job, even
when it contains little meaning or in
trinsic value.
I guess it all boils down to the fact
that, at some moment fifty years
from now, when I am old, wise, and
about to die, I do not want to tell my
grandchildren to check out my super
resume. I want to leave behind
something meaningful.
