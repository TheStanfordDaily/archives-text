# Q&A WITH LOYOLA MARYMOUNT
## PREVIEWING FIRST-ROUND MATCHUP AGAINST LMU 
### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With Stanford's men's soccer team
ready to take on Loyola Marymount
(LMU) in its first NCAA tournament
appearance since 2009, The Daily's Dy
lan Fugel chatted with Kevin Cacabe
los, the Sports Editor of the Los Ange
les Loyolan, to get perspectives from
both sides heading into Thursday's
first-round matchup.
Dylan Fugel (DF): How impressed have you
been by what has seemed to be a pretty com
fortable trek through the West Coast Confer
ence this season? It seems that LMU was
easily the cream of the conference. Did you
expect such a season?
Kevin Cacabelos (KC): Though LMU ended
its season winning eight of its final nine
games, a handful of these games did not come
easy, with all eight wins coming down to one
goal differentials. LMU's ability to play from
behind and depend on its defense to stay in
matches has been key to this team's success.
In the preseason, the team was picked to fin
ish third by the conference's coaches in a
wide-open race. The coaches and players
were both confident at the start of the season
because of the strength of the defense, so I'd
definitely say the team expected and envi
sioned the success this year.
DF: What kind of style does LMU play?
What type of game favors the Lions?
KC: LMU is a defensive-minded team that
usually doesn't try to force the issue on of
fense. The team's two center backs, junior
Ryan Felix and redshirt junior Craig Nitti,
stand at 6-foot-3 and 6-foot-5, respectively.
Not many teams want to serve the ball direct
ly in the box to challenge the Lions, forcing op
posing offenses to attack from the perimeter.
On offense, the team wants to use junior mid
fielder John McFarlin and freshman forward
Adrien Perez to pick its spots. If the team is at
tacking an opposing defense directly, it will
look to get the ball to strikers like junior Dy
lan Seedman and junior Juan De Rada.
DF: Who are the Lions' key players?
KC: As for key players, Nitti and Perez were

All-WCC first team selections, while Felix
and junior defender Jack McCracken were
named to the All-WCC second team. On of
fense, the team's best players are McFarlin
and Perez. As a freshman, Perez has proved
to be the team's most potent scorer. The for
ward has collected 25 points on 10 goals and
five assists this season. He has an incredible
ability to dribble through defenses and keep
the ball "sticky" to him.
DF: What are LMU's weaknesses? Is there
anything in particular that has given the
team problems this season?
KC: As for weaknesses, as weird as it sounds,
this team hasn't developed a true killer in
stinct. It hasn't beaten a team by more than
one goal since its 4-0 shutout against Santa
Clara in early October. At times, when the
team's offense has come out strong, its de
fense didn't play up to its potential. On the
other hand, the team's latest 1-0 loss to Gon
zaga showed how its offense could stall when
its defense plays superbly.
DF: How do you think LMU will adjust to the
level of play in the postseason, considering
that it comes from a conference in which on
ly it qualified for the tournament? Does it
have experience playing teams at a compara
ble level to that of Stanford?
KC: The team faced No. 15 seed Cal State
N orthridge in an exhibition in August, losing 2-
0, while also dropping a 1-0 result to UC-Santa
Barbara during the nonconference season. I
don't think it will have a problem traveling and
playing on the road it has a 6-3-1 road record
but it definitely hasn't faced the same level
of competition that Stanford has. It'll be inter
esting to see if it can elevate its level of play
against a battle-tested Stanford team.

fortable trek through the West Coast Confer
ence this season? It seems that LMU was
easily the cream of the conference. Did you
expect such a season?
Kevin Cacabelos (KC): Though LMU ended
its season winning eight of its final nine
games, a handful of these games did not come
easy, with all eight wins coming down to one
goal differentials. LMU's ability to play from
behind and depend on its defense to stay in
matches has been key to this team's success.
In the preseason, the team was picked to fin
ish third by the conference's coaches in a
wide-open race. The coaches and players
were both confident at the start of the season
because of the strength of the defense, so I'd
definitely say the team expected and envi
sioned the success this year.
DF: What kind of style does LMU play?
What type of game favors the Lions?
KC: LMU is a defensive-minded team that
usually doesn't try to force the issue on of
fense. The team's two center backs, junior
Ryan Felix and redshirt junior Craig Nitti,
stand at 6-foot-3 and 6-foot-5, respectively.
Not many teams want to serve the ball direct
ly in the box to challenge the Lions, forcing op
posing offenses to attack from the perimeter.
On offense, the team wants to use junior mid
fielder John McFarlin and freshman forward
Adrien Perez to pick its spots. If the team is at
tacking an opposing defense directly, it will
look to get the ball to strikers like junior Dy
lan Seedman and junior Juan De Rada.
DF: Who are the Lions' key players?
KC: As for key players, Nitti and Perez were

All-WCC first team selections, while Felix
and junior defender Jack McCracken were
named to the All-WCC second team. On of
fense, the team's best players are McFarlin
and Perez. As a freshman, Perez has proved
to be the team's most potent scorer. The for
ward has collected 25 points on 10 goals and
five assists this season. He has an incredible
ability to dribble through defenses and keep
the ball "sticky" to him.
DF: What are LMU's weaknesses? Is there
anything in particular that has given the
team problems this season?
KC: As for weaknesses, as weird as it sounds,
this team hasn't developed a true killer in
stinct. It hasn't beaten a team by more than
one goal since its 4-0 shutout against Santa
Clara in early October. At times, when the
team's offense has come out strong, its de
fense didn't play up to its potential. On the
other hand, the team's latest 1-0 loss to Gon
zaga showed how its offense could stall when
its defense plays superbly.
DF: How do you think LMU will adjust to the
level of play in the postseason, considering
that it comes from a conference in which on
ly it qualified for the tournament? Does it
have experience playing teams at a compara
ble level to that of Stanford?
KC: The team faced No. 15 seed Cal State
N orthridge in an exhibition in August, losing 2-
0, while also dropping a 1-0 result to UC-Santa
Barbara during the nonconference season. I
don't think it will have a problem traveling and
playing on the road it has a 6-3-1 road record
but it definitely hasn't faced the same level
of competition that Stanford has. It'll be inter
esting to see if it can elevate its level of play
against a battle-tested Stanford team.
