### JOSIE HODSON DESK EDITOR 
New York Times fashion journalist
and critic Cathy Horyn will moderate
a series of talks on the fashion indus
try held by the Stanford Arts Insti
tute, with the first talk to be held on
Dec. 2. The series will tap into Stan
ford students' growing interest in the
fashion industry seen on campus in
the form of new fashion magazine
startups and course offerings.
Horyn, with the help of Executive
Director of Arts Programs Matthew
Tiews '99 Ph.D. 'O4, has organized the
speaker series in order to bring in big
names from all areas of the fashion in
dustry.
"Fashion presents a lot of ways for
people to enter into the conversation,"
Horyn said.
Prom December through April,
there will be four talks. The first will
be with the former CEO of J.C. Pen
ney, Ron Johnson 'BO. The second talk
of the series will feature Annie Lei
bovitz, a portrait and fashion photog-

rapher, and Pascal Dangin of Box
Studios. The third talk will be with
Antoine Arnault, the chief execu
tive officer of Berluti and a mem
ber of the Board of Directors at
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
(LVMH). World-renowned design
er Alexander Wang will close the
series in April.
Horyn plans to have a general
outline for the focus of each talk,
noting that each speaker will have
a different understanding of the
fashion industry.

While Johnson's talk will focus
on the business of fashion, Lei
bovitz and Pascal's talk the only
of the four dialogues to feature two
speakers at once will be about
image-making and branding. Ar
nault's talk will discuss luxury fash
ion, both as a business and a craft,
and the final talk with Alexander
Wang will center on design.
This is not the first time the
New York-based Horyn has inter
acted with Stanford. In 2010, she
came to campus as a critic-in-resi
dence and she taught workshops
on fashion writing.
"There was a great response,"
Horyn said. "A lot of students,
mostly women, came up to me and
they wanted to know a lot about

different parts of the fashion in
dustry."
She said that because of the
wide variety of interests and the
general entrepreneurial spirit at
Stanford, she received interesting
questions at the workshops and is
expecting the same of this new
speaker series.
"They were thinking about
jobs, business and the marketing
side of fashion the branding,"
Horyn said. "I thought that was
kind of interesting. It kind of re
flects a shift in fashion right now.
Fashion is a lot about marketing
and branding."
Tiews said Horyn helped spark
interest in the fashion industry on
campus.

"She really inspired a lot of peo
ple and also galvanized a certain
interest in fashion," he said.
Because of that program's suc
cess, Tiews knew that he wanted to
design another program related to
fashion.
"We'd had that in the back of
our minds that there was this real
kind of interest in fashion and...
we were trying to think about what
we could do to kind of revive that
interest for the coming year," he
said.
Because the series attempts to
showcase individuals from all sides
of the fashion industry busi
ness, marketing, design Tiews
hopes that the series will appeal to
many different members of the
Stanford community.
"You'll get a sense of what goes
into the fashion world," he said.
"It's not just someone sitting and
designing clothes, but it's really a
very rapidly changing world and
all of those pieces have to come to
gether and be understood to really
get a handle on what's happening."
Tapping into growing interest
Stanford students and faculty
are already demonstrating interest
in engaging with the fashion indus
try from various angles.
Two different campus fashion
magazine startups have begun just
this fall: Mint magazine, which was
founded by freshman Ashley Over
beek 'l7 and will debut on Dec. 7,
and Pulse magazine, which is still
waiting for approval as a new stu
dent organization from the ASSU
before it begins production.
Overbeek, who wrote a fashion
column for her high school newspa
per, said that she posted a proto
type of the magazine on the Class
of 2017 Facebook page, hoping to
get at least 10 interested students
to reply. The post ended up having
over 150 responses.
"Brown, U Penn, Columbia,
even U Michigan they all have
fashion magazines on campus," she
said. "The fact that Stanford didn't
already have one is a red flag that
we're a little behind."
Sade Stevens 'l7 and Ameeqa
Ali 'l7, co-founders of Pulse maga
zine, were surprised when their in
terest survey received over 70 re
sponses within a week.
"Fashion is not essential to
Stanford's culture, but it still ex
ists," Ali said.
Elon Cornelius 'l5, the campus
promoter for the company Rent
the Runway which allows shop
pers to rent designer dresses at a
low cost for a night shared simi
lar thoughts.
"When we think about Stan

ford, we think about this really ca
sual environment where everyone
is wearing a sweatshirt, jeans and
a startup t-shirt, but there is a
strong population of girls who like
to dress up, who like to look nice,"
he said.
Professors have noted this
trend as well.
"[Fashion] is coming into focus
at Stanford. That's a very exciting
development," said Nancy Troy,
chair of the Art and Ait History
Department and author of "Cou
ture Culture: A Study in Modern
Art and Fashion."
Just this year, there are three
courses that focus at least part of
their attention on fashion: DANCE
67: Being S(c)ene: Dance, Fashion
and Art as Exhibition,
ARTHISTI6SA: Fashion Shows:
From Lady Godiva to Lady Gaga
and TAPS32F: History of Costume
and Fashion.
Fashion Shows: From Lady Go
diva to Lady Gaga drew over 60
students last year.
"In a period where Stanford,
like other schools, is trying to think
in interdisciplinary ways and make
connections across conventionally
separate disciplines or [the] whole
school... fashion actually can find a
legitimate place," Troy said. "It's
not simply about something super
ficial. It's too pervasive."
Horyn attributes the growing
interest in the field to the accessi
bility of the Internet and also a
breaking down of barriers within
the industry.
"You don't have rules that peo
ple have to worry about. You don't
have to be in the know to under
stand anything about fashion," she
said. She explained that the indus
try is now more welcoming to peo
ple outside the realm of fashion ex
pertise, and that this accessibility is
appealing to many.
"When people see other people
that look like them being involved
in fashion rather than stick thin
models, I think that that con
tributes to the way in which fashion
is now an industry where everyone
can have access and create their
own style," Overbeek said.
If the speaker series is received
well, Tiews wants to expand the di
alogue about fashion at Stanford.
"I'd love to do more there
are clearly lots of other people in
this world who would be interest
ing to have come to campus," he
said. "I think we'd be interested in
hearing from students about peo
ple they would particularly like to
see."
