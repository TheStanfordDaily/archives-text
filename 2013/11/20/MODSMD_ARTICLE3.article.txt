## CDC networking week eases concerns 
### SAM KURLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Career Devel
opment Center (CDC)'s Net
working Opportunities Week re
turned for its second run last
week after almost not being of
fered.
Marlene Stern, associate di
rector for mentoring and net
working, said that given other
priorities and recent restructur
ing at the CDC, the event might
not have been held this year if
not for an article that she read on
the Vice Provost for Graduate
Education's site written by Shan
non Birk Jibaja M.A. 'l3, prais
ing last year's program.
The weeklong series of events
connected students in the Hu
manities and Sciences with alum
ni from various fields for brief in
formational interviews as away

to let students practice inter
viewing strategies in a controlled
setting.
While Stern said that approx
imately 60 percent of Stanford
students find jobs through net
working, she notes that many
people are not eager to take ad
vantage of networking opportu
nities because they have a nega
tive view of networking itself.
"For many, it's the connota
tion that [networking] is
schmoozy, it's sleazy," Stern said.
"That you're a used car salesman
nothing against car salespeo
ple and you're just asking for
something and you're being a
sponge."
Skye Free 'l4, a co-terminal
masters candidate in Sociology
who attended the interviewing
practices, agreed with this per
ception.
"Sometimes networking is

very artificial because you obvi
ously have to do a lot of network
ing and do it purposefully to reap
a lot of benefits," Free said.
Pearle Lun 'l4 expressed sim
ilar hesitancy over the career
strategy.
"I feel weird about approach
ing people and making that con
nection for the sole purpose of
getting a job in the future or get
ting a recommendation," Lun
said.
The program's workshops
aimed to defeat this negative im
pression by teaching students
how to effectively network and
feel comfortable doing so.
"I think the core of that [neg
ative association] comes from the
perception that people are not
authentic," Stern said. "If you
are authentic in your request for
the conversation and the kind of
dialogue you have, then I think

it's really hard for someone to
perceive that as negative."
"One of the main goals of the
program is to get students com
fortable with informational inter
viewing so that they will be more
likely to utilize the numerous dif
ferent networks on campus to
reach out on their own," Stern
added.
Throughout the week, regis
tration priority was given to stu
dents from the School of Human
ities and Sciences.
Rebecca Bjorklund, career
counselor and Humanities and
Sciences liaison for the CDC,
said the center is working to pro
vide more resources for these
students, who may feel under
served by existing programs.
"We tend to hear from stu
dents that they feel like we serve
