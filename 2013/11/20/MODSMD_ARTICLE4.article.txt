## ASSU talks new budget reforms 
### ANDREW VOGELEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 15th Undergraduate Senate offi
cially began the process of substantive
funding reform and also voted to formal
ly institutionalize the Leadership Devel
opment Program in its meeting on Tues
day night.
The Senate listened to a presentation
from representatives from the Student
Activities Fee (SAFE) Reform group,
spearheaded by Olivia Moore'l6 and Jus
tine Moore'l6.
SAFE Reform proposed a complete
overhaul of the funding system for the
ASSU, including a restructuring of how
money is distributed and a lowering of the
student activities fee.
"Stanford currently has the highest
student activities fee in the country, pay
ing more in one year than our peers at
Harvard do over their entire four years,"
Olivia Moore said.
In addition to a much higher student
activities fee Stanford's fee is current
ly little over $420 a year the group also
highlighted the general complexity of the
current funding system, noting the sever
al different types of fee groups.
"I think they have come up with, in
general, a really great proposal," Senate
Chair Ben Holston'ls said.
The group also called for the creation
of a funding board that will ensure finan-

cially experienced members
of the student community
have a say in the distribution
of funds, noting that close to
25 percent of funds collected
from the students are not
spent during the year.
"I support the reform be
cause I think it helps resolve
some of the major issues we
have," Appropriations Chair
Angela Zhang 'l6 said. "It is
infeasible for Special Fees
groups to have such huge re
serves and have all that
money sitting around doing
nothing. It is not benefitting
the students it is meant to
help."
The SAFE Reform group
plans to continue to refine its
proposal through conversa
tions with community lead
ers. Any reform would most
likely occur in the form of a
constitutional amendment,
which would require a stu
dent vote.
The Senate also formal
ized the Leadership Devel
opment Program (LDP),
which has existed in some

form for several years. The
LDIf headed by Deputy
Chair Anna Breed 'l6, acts
as an internship program for
the Senate.
"We will have [associates]
go through meetings with
different administrators or
help us on specific projects,"
Breed said.
After being accepted into
the program, each associate
is assigned to a different
Senate committee.
"Not only are the associ
ates helping us with our
projects, they are also learn
ing the ins and outs of Sen
ate and learning more about
the University as a whole,"
Breed said.
The LDP has also acted
as a feeder for the Senate,
with four of this year's sena
tors having served as an as
sociate in the LDP last year.
The Senate also received
an update from Senator
John-Lancaster Finley 'l6
about the progress made by
the Joint Committee on Ju
dicial Affairs regarding the
Board of Judicial Affairs by
laws that were recently
overturned by the Graduate
Student Council. According
to Finley, the Committee will
compile a list of recommen

dations regarding the over
turned bylaws by the end of
the quarter.
The Senate also heard
from the students who have
been nominated for the
Nominations Committee,
which is the body that is re
sponsible for interviewing
and nominating students to
various University commit
tees.
"We really need great
students to be representa
tives on the boards of the
Nominations Committee is
appointing," Holston said. "I
really like the people the se
lection committee picked
and it was great to have
them at the meeting and get
to talk to them."
The Senate will vote next
week on the bill to appoint
the nominees.
In addition, the Senate
passed three other bills. Two
bills authorized senators to
receive half of their yearly
stipend at once, and the
third appropriated funds to
pay for Senate flyering ex
penses.
The Senate also passed
$31,690.27 in funding bills.

from the students are not
spent during the year.
"I support the reform be
cause I think it helps resolve
some of the major issues we
have," Appropriations Chair
Angela Zhang 'l6 said. "It is
infeasible for Special Fees
groups to have such huge re
serves and have all that
money sitting around doing
nothing. It is not benefitting
the students it is meant to
help."
The SAFE Reform group
plans to continue to refine its
proposal through conversa
tions with community lead
ers. Any reform would most
likely occur in the form of a
constitutional amendment,
which would require a stu
dent vote.
The Senate also formal
ized the Leadership Devel
opment Program (LDP),
which has existed in some

form for several years. The
LDIf headed by Deputy
Chair Anna Breed 'l6, acts
as an internship program for
the Senate.
"We will have [associates]
go through meetings with
different administrators or
help us on specific projects,"
Breed said.
After being accepted into
the program, each associate
is assigned to a different
Senate committee.
"Not only are the associ
ates helping us with our
projects, they are also learn
ing the ins and outs of Sen
ate and learning more about
the University as a whole,"
Breed said.
The LDP has also acted
as a feeder for the Senate,
with four of this year's sena
tors having served as an as
sociate in the LDP last year.
The Senate also received
an update from Senator
John-Lancaster Finley 'l6
about the progress made by
the Joint Committee on Ju
dicial Affairs regarding the
Board of Judicial Affairs by
laws that were recently
overturned by the Graduate
Student Council. According
to Finley, the Committee will
compile a list of recommen

dations regarding the over
turned bylaws by the end of
the quarter.
The Senate also heard
from the students who have
been nominated for the
Nominations Committee,
which is the body that is re
sponsible for interviewing
and nominating students to
various University commit
tees.
"We really need great
students to be representa
tives on the boards of the
Nominations Committee is
appointing," Holston said. "I
really like the people the se
lection committee picked
and it was great to have
them at the meeting and get
to talk to them."
The Senate will vote next
week on the bill to appoint
the nominees.
In addition, the Senate
passed three other bills. Two
bills authorized senators to
receive half of their yearly
stipend at once, and the
third appropriated funds to
pay for Senate flyering ex
penses.
The Senate also passed
$31,690.27 in funding bills.
