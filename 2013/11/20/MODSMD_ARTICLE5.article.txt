# Q&A NORA TJOSSEM
## PRODUCER OF RAM'S HEAD THEATRICAL SOCIETY'S GAIETIES 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Nora Tjossem, 'l5, is the producer of
Ram's Head Theatrical Society's Gaieties
show this year. The show is one of the
many Big Game Week traditions at Stan
ford and will run today, Thursday and Fri
day.
The Daily recently sat down with
Tjossem to talk about her direction for
this year's show and how she took on this
Stanford tradition.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did
you get involved in Gaieties?
Nora Tjossem:(NT)( I've acted the
past two years in the show and then this
year I guess I was ready to take on a big
ger role, and it has been a bigger role.
It was about a year ago, week six of fall
quarter, when I joined on as the producer,
and we started hiring all of the writers.
It's crazy because you start from nothing:
It was just me and this name, Gaieties
2013.
It's been a long process and we're right
at the end. Every single rehearsal I go to,
I'm like "they're so good" and it's so excit
ing to see it come together.
TSD: What theme does Gaieties have
this year?
NT: "Gaietiesburg: A Campus Divid
ed." We don't like to disclose too much
about the plot. We like to keep it some
what hidden, but it centers on the fuzzy
techy divide civil war between the factions
and much drama is had.
A former Disney star appears as a vil
lain and Harry Elam is the heroic narra
tor. There's good stuff in store.
TSD: How was this theme decided on?
NT: The first people I hired were the
head writers, Safiya Nygaard 'l4 and
Katie Kirsch 'l6, and together we hired
the rest of the writers I think for a to
tal of ten writers.

The first thing they did when
they were hired was to start gen
erating plot ideas; specifically
what Gaieties should be about.
They brought their ideas to me
and to Ram's Head and we
thought about what had the most
potential. I think this theme has
become even more appropriate be
cause it seems like every week
there's another article about the
crisis in the humanities, or some
thing like that. It's a division I've
felt very acutely these past two
years and it's pervasive.
I came into Stanford not seeing
a distinction, thinking I could be
an English major or a Biology ma
jor, and since then it's become
more apparent. Even just the ter
minology speaks a lot to that kind
of divide, techy vs. fuzzy. We're
trying to tackle that division.
TSD: Can you give us a sneak
preview of the show this year?
NT: I can't tell you much, but
we got express permission to cre
ate characters based on three pop
ular professors at Stanford, in
cluding Harry Elam.
We've also got a lot of great
songs because we had a really tal
ented composer help us out. We
try to give as many shout-outs and
fun things as possible, so there are
a lot of smaller references.
Gaieties has always hinged on
cameos and one-liners, so there's a
lot of those, some really golden
things. I think there's something
for everyone, which is what makes
Gaieties really awesome. Even if
you don't find all of it funny,
there's usually something you can
laugh at.

TSD: How are you putting
your own flare on this Big Game
Week tradition?

NT: I did [Structured Liberal
Education] SLE my freshmen
year and the past two years in the
show, SLE hasn't come off too
well, so I think we do pretty okay
with that this year.
It's a lot of time and it asks a
lot of you, but because of every
thing done by all the people
around you, you're not getting a
script that you're paying royalties
for. You're completely organically
creating one. You're implementing
the script, you're making the mu
sic, the lyrics, you're doing every
thing. It's so cool to be able to talk
to all of these people who are cre
ating everything and the people
who are going to be implementing
it.
TSD: How has Gaieties
changed over the years?
NT: A lot of the long-time Gai
eties people graduated last year
also, so we're seeing a lot of new
b100d... There are a lot of fresh
men in this cast, and they bring
this new energy and curiosity
about this tradition that's been re
ally great. So the few of us who
have returned to Gaieties this
year are making sure to keep the
tradition strong.

TSD: What do you hope stu
dents get out of this year's per
formance?
NT: There's two sides to the
coin, because on the one hand
we're a Big Game rally. That's a
big part of Gaieties, getting people
excited. But on the other hand, it's
also a culmination of a lot of stu
dent work. I really like seeing how
people can be really creative while
also doing academics. The show is
all about energy and bringing that
on stage in away that lets us see
how talented all these people are.
Plus, the humor always helps, es
pecially this late in the quarter.
It's a really great release.

with that this year.
It's a lot of time and it asks a
lot of you, but because of every
thing done by all the people
around you, you're not getting a
script that you're paying royalties
for. You're completely organically
creating one. You're implementing
the script, you're making the mu
sic, the lyrics, you're doing every
thing. It's so cool to be able to talk
to all of these people who are cre
ating everything and the people
who are going to be implementing
it.
TSD: How has Gaieties
changed over the years?
NT: A lot of the long-time Gai
eties people graduated last year
also, so we're seeing a lot of new
b100d... There are a lot of fresh
men in this cast, and they bring
this new energy and curiosity
about this tradition that's been re
ally great. So the few of us who
have returned to Gaieties this
year are making sure to keep the
tradition strong.

TSD: What do you hope stu
dents get out of this year's per
formance?
NT: There's two sides to the
coin, because on the one hand
we're a Big Game rally. That's a
big part of Gaieties, getting people
excited. But on the other hand, it's
also a culmination of a lot of stu
dent work. I really like seeing how
people can be really creative while
also doing academics. The show is
all about energy and bringing that
on stage in away that lets us see
how talented all these people are.
Plus, the humor always helps, es
pecially this late in the quarter.
It's a really great release.

Nora Tjossem, 'l5, is the producer of
Ram's Head Theatrical Society's Gaieties
show this year. The show is one of the
many Big Game Week traditions at Stan
ford and will run today, Thursday and Fri
day.
The Daily recently sat down with
Tjossem to talk about her direction for
this year's show and how she took on this
Stanford tradition.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did
you get involved in Gaieties?
Nora Tjossem:(NT)( I've acted the
past two years in the show and then this
year I guess I was ready to take on a big
ger role, and it has been a bigger role.
It was about a year ago, week six of fall
quarter, when I joined on as the producer,
and we started hiring all of the writers.
It's crazy because you start from nothing:
It was just me and this name, Gaieties
2013.
It's been a long process and we're right
at the end. Every single rehearsal I go to,
I'm like "they're so good" and it's so excit
ing to see it come together.
TSD: What theme does Gaieties have
this year?
NT: "Gaietiesburg: A Campus Divid
ed." We don't like to disclose too much
about the plot. We like to keep it some
what hidden, but it centers on the fuzzy
techy divide civil war between the factions
and much drama is had.
A former Disney star appears as a vil
lain and Harry Elam is the heroic narra
tor. There's good stuff in store.
TSD: How was this theme decided on?
NT: The first people I hired were the
head writers, Safiya Nygaard 'l4 and
Katie Kirsch 'l6, and together we hired
the rest of the writers I think for a to
tal of ten writers.

The first thing they did when
they were hired was to start gen
erating plot ideas; specifically
what Gaieties should be about.
They brought their ideas to me
and to Ram's Head and we
thought about what had the most
potential. I think this theme has
become even more appropriate be
cause it seems like every week
there's another article about the
crisis in the humanities, or some
thing like that. It's a division I've
felt very acutely these past two
years and it's pervasive.
I came into Stanford not seeing
a distinction, thinking I could be
an English major or a Biology ma
jor, and since then it's become
more apparent. Even just the ter
minology speaks a lot to that kind
of divide, techy vs. fuzzy. We're
trying to tackle that division.
TSD: Can you give us a sneak
preview of the show this year?
NT: I can't tell you much, but
we got express permission to cre
ate characters based on three pop
ular professors at Stanford, in
cluding Harry Elam.
We've also got a lot of great
songs because we had a really tal
ented composer help us out. We
try to give as many shout-outs and
fun things as possible, so there are
a lot of smaller references.
Gaieties has always hinged on
cameos and one-liners, so there's a
lot of those, some really golden
things. I think there's something
for everyone, which is what makes
Gaieties really awesome. Even if
you don't find all of it funny,
there's usually something you can
laugh at.

TSD: How are you putting
your own flare on this Big Game
Week tradition?

NT: I did [Structured Liberal
Education] SLE my freshmen
year and the past two years in the
show, SLE hasn't come off too
well, so I think we do pretty okay
with that this year.
