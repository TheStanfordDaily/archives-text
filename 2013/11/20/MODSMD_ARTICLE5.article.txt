# Q&A NORA TJOSSEM
## PRODUCER OF RAM'S HEAD THEATRICAL SOCIETY'S GAIETIES 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Nora Tjossem, 'l5, is the producer of
Ram's Head Theatrical Society's Gaieties
show this year. The show is one of the
many Big Game Week traditions at Stan
ford and will run today, Thursday and Fri
day.
The Daily recently sat down with
Tjossem to talk about her direction for
this year's show and how she took on this
Stanford tradition.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did
you get involved in Gaieties?
Nora Tjossem:(NT)( I've acted the
past two years in the show and then this
year I guess I was ready to take on a big
ger role, and it has been a bigger role.
It was about a year ago, week six of fall
quarter, when I joined on as the producer,
and we started hiring all of the writers.
It's crazy because you start from nothing:
It was just me and this name, Gaieties
2013.
It's been a long process and we're right
at the end. Every single rehearsal I go to,
I'm like "they're so good" and it's so excit
ing to see it come together.
TSD: What theme does Gaieties have
this year?
NT: "Gaietiesburg: A Campus Divid
ed." We don't like to disclose too much
about the plot. We like to keep it some
what hidden, but it centers on the fuzzy
techy divide civil war between the factions
and much drama is had.
A former Disney star appears as a vil
lain and Harry Elam is the heroic narra
tor. There's good stuff in store.
TSD: How was this theme decided on?
NT: The first people I hired were the
head writers, Safiya Nygaard 'l4 and
Katie Kirsch 'l6, and together we hired
the rest of the writers I think for a to
tal of ten writers.
