## NFL refs rear their ugly heads 
### Viggy Venkataraman 
As far as football goes, the
past few days have been
some of the worst in his
tory for me. My high
school got matched up
against a powerhouse in the CCS play
offs, Stanford suffered a horrific loss to
the Men of Troy the 49ers couldn't put
away the Saints and oh yes, my Patri
ots lost on Monday Night Football.
About the Stanford loss I shall not
speak one word, for that wound is still
far too raw.
However, I have no such qualms re
garding the 49ers and Patriots. I have
a lot to say about both cases, but for the
sake of decorum, I am going to limit
this column to the 49ers. That example
is all you need to realize that the state
of refereeing in the NFL is atrocious.
Let us begin with the much-hyped
San Francisco-New Orleans matchup
that took place Sunday afternoon.
Due to the huge playoff implications,
many across the country, including
yours truly closely watched the out
come. With the game on the line and a
bit of free time on my hands, I
watched as 49ers linebacker Ahmad
Brooks sacked Saints quarterback
Drew Brees with the 49ers clinging to
a 20-17 lead and the Saints threaten
ing to score. I gasped as the ball came
loose, and I cheered as the Niners os
tensibly came up with the game-seal
ing turnover. However, joy tarred to
disbelief as that ever-feared yellow
piece of fabric came out of the refer
ee's pocket and landed on the turf.
The call was a personal foul on Brooks
for a "blow to the head and neck area"
of the quarterback.
I sat and watched the replays in
slow motion, fast motion, and stop mo
tion for about 20 minutes. I am watching
a GIF of the sack replay over and over
even as I type these words, and the call
still sickens me.
What do you want Brooks to do in
this case? He is running M-sprint to
ward Brees, having used his speed to
get around right tackle Zach Strief. If
you watch the replay closely you can see
that there was no physical way for
Brooks' arm, bent as it is, to have made
contact with Brees' neck. Moreover, in
the instant before the sack, Brees ducks
his head ever so slightly, such that what
would have been a perfect form tackle
around the upper shoulder pads shifted
towards the dreaded neck area.
By the letter of the la\y the call was
(maybe) made correctly but my biggest
frustration is with the spirit of the law it
self Football shouldn't have to be a com
plicated game, but with all the years of
rule changes adding up and a newer
emphasis on "player* safety" what used
to be simple calls are now anything but.
Brooks himself had a fair point
when he alluded to the star treatment
meted out to famous quarterbacks. I
can personally attest to similarly vicious
hits received by Terrefle Pryor, Case
Keenum and the like —rookies who
have yet to establish themselves as in
ternational superstars like Brees. But
by far the more salient point is the fact
that the league claims to be mindful of
"player safety" when in reality it mostly
cares about offensive player safety.
High-scoring games make for good tel
evision, and high-scoring games require
high-scoring quarterbacks. Thus, we
have a slew of defenseless-receiver and
quarterback redes that make it virtually
impossible to defend a passing attack.
Meanwhile, crack-back blocks, chop
blocks and facemask pushing remain
legal weapons for offensive players to
exploit. The double standard is palpa
ble. So palpable, in fact, that both Ray
Lewis and Tedy Bruschi offered to
pay parts of Brooks' fine out of sym
pathy for his plight.
Put simply the rules of football are
starting to get unwieldy. Some rales
conflict with each other, some rules
are getting too verbose or complicat
ed, and there is just a lack of parity
when it comes to the rules for offens
es and defenses. As a result, it is be
coming nigh impossible to ref a game
properly whilst upholding the letter
and spirit of the law as well as the let
ter and spirit of the game itself.
For now I will keep watching foot
ball. But my disillusionment with the
sport is very high a few more calls
like these and I may have to take my
viewership elsewhere.

You know that this problem is seri
ous when Vignesh Venkataraman,
himself a former quarterback, is
getting angry about the rules re
garding quarterback and receiver
protection. If you're looking for
somebody to commiserate with, di
rect all of your refereeing com
plaints to viggy@stanford.edu,

As far as football goes, the
past few days have been
some of the worst in his
tory for me. My high
school got matched up
against a powerhouse in the CCS play
offs, Stanford suffered a horrific loss to
the Men of Troy the 49ers couldn't put
away the Saints and oh yes, my Patri
ots lost on Monday Night Football.
About the Stanford loss I shall not
speak one word, for that wound is still
far too raw.
However, I have no such qualms re
garding the 49ers and Patriots. I have
a lot to say about both cases, but for the
sake of decorum, I am going to limit
this column to the 49ers. That example
is all you need to realize that the state
of refereeing in the NFL is atrocious.
Let us begin with the much-hyped
San Francisco-New Orleans matchup
that took place Sunday afternoon.
Due to the huge playoff implications,
many across the country, including
yours truly closely watched the out
come. With the game on the line and a
bit of free time on my hands, I
watched as 49ers linebacker Ahmad
Brooks sacked Saints quarterback
Drew Brees with the 49ers clinging to
a 20-17 lead and the Saints threaten
ing to score. I gasped as the ball came
loose, and I cheered as the Niners os
tensibly came up with the game-seal
ing turnover. However, joy tarred to
disbelief as that ever-feared yellow
piece of fabric came out of the refer
ee's pocket and landed on the turf.
The call was a personal foul on Brooks
for a "blow to the head and neck area"
of the quarterback.
I sat and watched the replays in
slow motion, fast motion, and stop mo
tion for about 20 minutes. I am watching
a GIF of the sack replay over and over
even as I type these words, and the call
still sickens me.
What do you want Brooks to do in
this case? He is running M-sprint to
ward Brees, having used his speed to
get around right tackle Zach Strief. If
you watch the replay closely you can see
that there was no physical way for
Brooks' arm, bent as it is, to have made
contact with Brees' neck. Moreover, in
the instant before the sack, Brees ducks
his head ever so slightly, such that what
would have been a perfect form tackle
around the upper shoulder pads shifted
towards the dreaded neck area.
By the letter of the la\y the call was
(maybe) made correctly but my biggest
frustration is with the spirit of the law it
self Football shouldn't have to be a com
plicated game, but with all the years of
rule changes adding up and a newer
emphasis on "player* safety" what used
to be simple calls are now anything but.
Brooks himself had a fair point
when he alluded to the star treatment
meted out to famous quarterbacks. I
can personally attest to similarly vicious
hits received by Terrefle Pryor, Case
Keenum and the like —rookies who
have yet to establish themselves as in
ternational superstars like Brees. But
by far the more salient point is the fact
that the league claims to be mindful of
"player safety" when in reality it mostly
cares about offensive player safety.
High-scoring games make for good tel
evision, and high-scoring games require
high-scoring quarterbacks. Thus, we
have a slew of defenseless-receiver and
quarterback redes that make it virtually
impossible to defend a passing attack.
Meanwhile, crack-back blocks, chop
blocks and facemask pushing remain
legal weapons for offensive players to
exploit. The double standard is palpa
ble. So palpable, in fact, that both Ray
Lewis and Tedy Bruschi offered to
pay parts of Brooks' fine out of sym
pathy for his plight.
