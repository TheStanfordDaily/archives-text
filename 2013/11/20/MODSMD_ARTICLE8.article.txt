# SHAW FACES HIS CRITICS
## STANFORD'S HEAD COACH ADDRESSES CRITICISM REGARDING PLAY CALLING 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Head coach David Shaw opened
up Tuesday's press luncheon by re
sponding to criticism about Stan
ford's play calling in last Satur
day's 20-17 loss against USC.
"We did not deviate from our
game plan," Shaw said. "We never
have and we will not. Nobody com
plained when we threw the ball 25
times against UCLA and Washing
ton State in victories, but I know
how it is when you lose. Every
thing's the head coach's fault, and
everything goes to play calling."
Some critics blame the loss on
Shaw and his red-zone play calling,
especially after Stanford's final
two trips to the red zone came up
empty. In the third quarter, Shaw
elected to throw the ball on first
down at the USC 19-yard line. A
loss of four yards on the throw
pushed the Card back, and after an
11-yard run by Anthony Wilker
son, Shaw again chose to throw the
ball on third-and-3 instead of stick
ing to the run. The pass was incom
plete and the subsequent field goal
was blocked.
On Stanford's next trip to the
red zone, Shaw went with the Wild
cat formation on first-and-goal
from the 6-yard line and the play
again lost 4 yards. After an incom
pletion, Stanford was forced to
throw on third-and-goal from the
10-yard line and Hogan's attempt
ed slant pass to Montgomery was
intercepted.
"You can say what you want,
that it's all on Coach Shaw," Shaw
said. "That's fine... But to think
that the game goes down to red
zone play calling when we've been
close to the top of the nation for
years and been very good, that we

can't throw a slant on third down
so every incompletion or intercep
tion turns into 'We should just run
the ball,' that makes no sense. I'm
comfortable with what we do.
We've got to execute better. We
can't get a field goal blocked and
we can't throw an interception in
the red zone. That's the difference
in the game."
After the game, Shaw was seen
waiting outside the USC locker
room and shaking hands with some
of the players. Shaw clarified that
he only went to the locker room in
order to seek out USC head coach
Ed Orgeron. Shaw was unable to
find Orgeron on the field after the
game as the fans rushed onto the
field.
"I believe in the postgame
handshake," Shaw said. "I think
it's right, I think it's a great thing
about sports, and I wanted to make
sure that I got a chance to shake
his hand after the game."
Despite having limited USC to
only 20 points including just
three in the second half—Stan
ford's defense still feels that it
could have done better, especially
on the game's final drive; USC con
verted a fourth-and-2 on its final
drive on its way to the game-win
ning 47-yard field goal by kicker
Andre Heidari.
"We come out trying to play a
perfect game, trying to be great
every game," said senior defensive
tackle David Parry. "Against USC,
every member of the defense prob
ably has a play or two that they
want back. Letting up or making a
mistake that one time and having
those pay so costly in the grand
scheme of the game is frustrating."
Despite the frustration and dis
appointment, the Card will need to
quickly regroup from the loss be

fore facing Cal this Saturday.
Even though Cal limps into the
matchup with just a 1-10 record on
the season, the Bears seem to al
ways give Stanford problems when
the Cardinal least expects them,
especially at Stanford Stadium. In

2009, Stanford lost to the Bears af
ter big wins against Oregon and
USC in consecutive weeks, and in
2011, Stanford had to eke out a
three-point win after a deflating

"There's going to be energy

Head coach David Shaw opened
up Tuesday's press luncheon by re
sponding to criticism about Stan
ford's play calling in last Satur
day's 20-17 loss against USC.
"We did not deviate from our
game plan," Shaw said. "We never
have and we will not. Nobody com
plained when we threw the ball 25
times against UCLA and Washing
ton State in victories, but I know
how it is when you lose. Every
thing's the head coach's fault, and
everything goes to play calling."
Some critics blame the loss on
Shaw and his red-zone play calling,
especially after Stanford's final
two trips to the red zone came up
empty. In the third quarter, Shaw
elected to throw the ball on first
down at the USC 19-yard line. A
loss of four yards on the throw
pushed the Card back, and after an
11-yard run by Anthony Wilker
son, Shaw again chose to throw the
ball on third-and-3 instead of stick
ing to the run. The pass was incom
plete and the subsequent field goal
was blocked.
On Stanford's next trip to the
red zone, Shaw went with the Wild
cat formation on first-and-goal
from the 6-yard line and the play
again lost 4 yards. After an incom
pletion, Stanford was forced to
throw on third-and-goal from the
10-yard line and Hogan's attempt
ed slant pass to Montgomery was
intercepted.
"You can say what you want,
that it's all on Coach Shaw," Shaw
said. "That's fine... But to think
that the game goes down to red
zone play calling when we've been
close to the top of the nation for
years and been very good, that we

can't throw a slant on third down
so every incompletion or intercep
tion turns into 'We should just run
the ball,' that makes no sense. I'm
comfortable with what we do.
We've got to execute better. We
can't get a field goal blocked and
we can't throw an interception in
the red zone. That's the difference
in the game."
After the game, Shaw was seen
waiting outside the USC locker
room and shaking hands with some
of the players. Shaw clarified that
he only went to the locker room in
order to seek out USC head coach
Ed Orgeron. Shaw was unable to
find Orgeron on the field after the
game as the fans rushed onto the
field.
"I believe in the postgame
handshake," Shaw said. "I think
it's right, I think it's a great thing
about sports, and I wanted to make
sure that I got a chance to shake
his hand after the game."
