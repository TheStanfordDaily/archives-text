# WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL ROUNDTABLE
## ON TO THE BEARS Debating what Stanford needs to do against Cal 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
After falling to USC on Sat
urday, Stanford is preparing
to face Cal after a loss for a
third consecutive season,
Though the Cardinal won't
have trouble finding inspira
tion for Big Game, the end of
team's season has lost some of
its intrigue now that Stanford
doesn't control its own BCS
bowl destiny. We asked football
writers Winston Shi, Do-Hy
oung Park and David Cohn:
What steps should the Cardi
nal be looking to take as a 31-
point favorite against the
Bears?

Winston: Stanford's most impor

tant goal now is to improve its BCS
bowl chances as much as possible.
The chaos of 2007 that propelled
two-loss LSU to the national cham
pionship is not happening again,
and even if it did, Stanford would
likely not be the beneficiary.
There are things Stanford can
control and there are things it can't
control. Today, the latter is far
more imposing than the former.
Assuming that Fresno State, Clem
son and the SEC No. 2 make the
BCS, only one BCS slot will be
open. The choices are two-loss
Stanford, two-loss Wisconsin, one
loss Michigan State and one-loss
Oklahoma State. Of these teams,
only Stanford, MSU and OSU are
in the BCS top 14 and thus eligible
for BCS bowls. Michigan State will
take on a resurgent Minnesota
team before it likely faces Ohio
State. Oklahoma State plays Bay
lor and Oklahoma. It's a little
strange to think that Stanford has
the easiest remaining schedule of
the four, but in this regard Stan
ford is quite lucky. But it is still not
in the driver's seat.

With this in mind, and likely
with no more ranked teams left on
the schedule, Stanford needs to re
mind the world that it is a great
program. What Stanford can do is
beat the stuffing out of what is pos
sibly the worst team in the FBS.
Just beating Cal this season
won't raise many eyebrows. Cal is
so bad that letting it hang around
would actually be a negative out
come. Therefore, Stanford needs to
get attention in whatever way it
can. Even 4-6 Colorado beat Cal by
three scores. Stanford is a 31-point
favorite playing at home and the
Cardiac Cardinal needs to cover.
Distasteful as it sounds, the only
option Stanford has left is to run up
the score.
Do: I don't really harbor any hostil
ity or distaste towards Cal. I'm
probably one of the people on cam
pus that is the most ambivalent
about the Stanford-Cal rivalry. I
have a lot of respect for Cal as a
school and have been pretty disap-

Junior quarterback Kevin Hogan (above) and the Cardinal offense may need to put up big numbers in the
final two games of the season in order for the two-loss Cardinal to receive an at-large bid to a BCS bowl.
