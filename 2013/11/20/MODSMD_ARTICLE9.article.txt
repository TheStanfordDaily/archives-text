# WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL ROUNDTABLE
## ON TO THE BEARS Debating what Stanford needs to do against Cal 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
After falling to USC on Sat
urday, Stanford is preparing
to face Cal after a loss for a
third consecutive season,
Though the Cardinal won't
have trouble finding inspira
tion for Big Game, the end of
team's season has lost some of
its intrigue now that Stanford
doesn't control its own BCS
bowl destiny. We asked football
writers Winston Shi, Do-Hy
oung Park and David Cohn:
What steps should the Cardi
nal be looking to take as a 31-
point favorite against the
Bears?

Winston: Stanford's most impor

tant goal now is to improve its BCS
bowl chances as much as possible.
The chaos of 2007 that propelled
two-loss LSU to the national cham
pionship is not happening again,
and even if it did, Stanford would
likely not be the beneficiary.
There are things Stanford can
control and there are things it can't
control. Today, the latter is far
more imposing than the former.
Assuming that Fresno State, Clem
son and the SEC No. 2 make the
BCS, only one BCS slot will be
open. The choices are two-loss
Stanford, two-loss Wisconsin, one
loss Michigan State and one-loss
Oklahoma State. Of these teams,
only Stanford, MSU and OSU are
in the BCS top 14 and thus eligible
for BCS bowls. Michigan State will
take on a resurgent Minnesota
team before it likely faces Ohio
State. Oklahoma State plays Bay
lor and Oklahoma. It's a little
strange to think that Stanford has
the easiest remaining schedule of
the four, but in this regard Stan
ford is quite lucky. But it is still not
in the driver's seat.

With this in mind, and likely
with no more ranked teams left on
the schedule, Stanford needs to re
mind the world that it is a great
program. What Stanford can do is
beat the stuffing out of what is pos
sibly the worst team in the FBS.
Just beating Cal this season
won't raise many eyebrows. Cal is
so bad that letting it hang around
would actually be a negative out
come. Therefore, Stanford needs to
get attention in whatever way it
can. Even 4-6 Colorado beat Cal by
three scores. Stanford is a 31-point
favorite playing at home and the
Cardiac Cardinal needs to cover.
Distasteful as it sounds, the only
option Stanford has left is to run up
the score.
Do: I don't really harbor any hostil
ity or distaste towards Cal. I'm
probably one of the people on cam
pus that is the most ambivalent
about the Stanford-Cal rivalry. I
have a lot of respect for Cal as a
school and have been pretty disap-

pointed to see a once-proud
football program sink to the
level that it is at right now.
With that being said, if
there was ever a time for
Stanford to take advantage
of the talent gap, run up the
score on Cal and exorcise all
of its frustrations, now is
that time. The Golden Bears
are catching the Cardinal at
exactly the wrong time.
Big Game is an opportu
nity for Stanford to regain
its footing at home in a rival
ry game against an oppo
nent that nobody is expect
ing to be competitive. After
coming out flat and making
so many mistakes in a very
sloppy loss, the Cardinal
needs to take this opportuni
ty to recover and show itself
(and the nation) that it still
deserves a BCS at-large bid.
Realistically, this is the best
thing the Cardinal can hope
for at this point.
The Card needs to run
the ball down Cal's throats
and not let its foot off the
gas pedal. Portland State al
most beat Cal, meaning that
Stanford has to demolish it.
Facing one of the worst de
fenses in the FBS, Kevin
Hogan needs to re-establish

rapport with his receivers
he has only completed 55
percent of his passes in the
last three games and
more importantly, needs to
rediscover the poise and
confidence in the pocket that
he had at the beginning of
the season.

David: In my opinion, the
game plan for the Cardinal
against Cal is very simple:
Play your style of football
and you will win easily. I
feel bad for Cal, as its pro
gram is going through the
growing pains of starting a
true freshman at quarter
back with a first-year head
coach and a brand new of
fensive system.
That being said, it would
be a waste of everyone's
time to break down this
matchup from a personnel
perspective, as Stanford's
talent and experience in all
three phases of the game
far exceeds that of Cal. Cal
fans know it. Stanford fans
know it. As such, there is no
need to dwell on this fact.
Let's move on.
The one way that Stan
ford can run into trouble is
if the Cardinal has not put
last week's loss to USC in
the rearview mirror. In par
ticular, it must ignore the
BCS bowl chatter, because
even at this point in the sea
son, the BCS talk is simply

talk. A lot can happen over
the course of the final three
weeks of the regular season.
Despite what you may
hear or read on ESPN.com,
Sports Illustrated or any
other sports publication, at
large BCS bowl berths are
handed out on December 8
and not in BCS bowl projec
tions during the third week
of November. Stanford's
fabulous turnouts at the
Rose Bowl last season, the
Fiesta Bowl in 2012 and the
Orange Bowl in 2011 mean
that the Cardinal will be a
very appealing candidate
for an at-large bid if Stan
ford finishes the year at 10-
2.
Stanford must state its
case by taking care of busi
ness against California and
Notre Dame. At the mo
ment, the focus for the team
must be on the short-term
goals rather than the long
term ones.

Winston Shi, Do-Hyoung

USC toss and have spent the.
last few days swimming in
their own tears, self-doubt and

The one way that Stan
ford can run into trouble is
if the Cardinal has not put
last week's loss to USC in
the rearview mirror. In par
ticular, it must ignore the
BCS bowl chatter, because
even at this point in the sea
son, the BCS talk is simply

talk. A lot can happen over
the course of the final three
weeks of the regular season.

large BCS bowl berths are
handed out on December 8
and not in BCS bowl projec
tions during the third week
of November. Stanford's
fabulous turnouts at the
Rose Bowl last season, the
Fiesta Bowl in 2012 and the
Orange Bowl in 2011 mean
that the Cardinal will be a
very appealing candidate
for an at-large bid if Stan
ford finishes the year at 10-
2.
Stanford must state its
case by taking care of busi
ness against California and
Notre Dame. At the mo

must be on the short-term
goals rather than the long
term ones.

After falling to USC on Sat
urday, Stanford is preparing
to face Cal after a loss for a
third consecutive season,
Though the Cardinal won't
have trouble finding inspira
tion for Big Game, the end of
team's season has lost some of
its intrigue now that Stanford
doesn't control its own BCS
bowl destiny. We asked football
writers Winston Shi, Do-Hy
oung Park and David Cohn:
What steps should the Cardi
nal be looking to take as a 31-
point favorite against the
Bears?

Winston: Stanford's most impor

tant goal now is to improve its BCS
bowl chances as much as possible.
The chaos of 2007 that propelled
two-loss LSU to the national cham
pionship is not happening again,
and even if it did, Stanford would
likely not be the beneficiary.
There are things Stanford can
control and there are things it can't
control. Today, the latter is far
more imposing than the former.
Assuming that Fresno State, Clem
son and the SEC No. 2 make the
BCS, only one BCS slot will be
open. The choices are two-loss
Stanford, two-loss Wisconsin, one
loss Michigan State and one-loss
Oklahoma State. Of these teams,
only Stanford, MSU and OSU are
in the BCS top 14 and thus eligible
for BCS bowls. Michigan State will
take on a resurgent Minnesota
team before it likely faces Ohio
State. Oklahoma State plays Bay
lor and Oklahoma. It's a little
strange to think that Stanford has
the easiest remaining schedule of
the four, but in this regard Stan
ford is quite lucky. But it is still not
in the driver's seat.

With this in mind, and likely
with no more ranked teams left on
the schedule, Stanford needs to re
mind the world that it is a great
program. What Stanford can do is
beat the stuffing out of what is pos
sibly the worst team in the FBS.
Just beating Cal this season
won't raise many eyebrows. Cal is
so bad that letting it hang around
would actually be a negative out
come. Therefore, Stanford needs to
get attention in whatever way it
can. Even 4-6 Colorado beat Cal by
three scores. Stanford is a 31-point
favorite playing at home and the
Cardiac Cardinal needs to cover.
Distasteful as it sounds, the only
option Stanford has left is to run up
the score.
Do: I don't really harbor any hostil
ity or distaste towards Cal. I'm
probably one of the people on cam
pus that is the most ambivalent
about the Stanford-Cal rivalry. I
have a lot of respect for Cal as a
school and have been pretty disap-

pointed to see a once-proud
football program sink to the
level that it is at right now.
With that being said, if
there was ever a time for
Stanford to take advantage
of the talent gap, run up the
score on Cal and exorcise all
of its frustrations, now is
that time. The Golden Bears
are catching the Cardinal at
exactly the wrong time.
Big Game is an opportu
nity for Stanford to regain
its footing at home in a rival
ry game against an oppo
nent that nobody is expect
ing to be competitive. After
coming out flat and making
so many mistakes in a very
sloppy loss, the Cardinal
needs to take this opportuni
ty to recover and show itself
(and the nation) that it still
deserves a BCS at-large bid.
Realistically, this is the best
thing the Cardinal can hope
for at this point.
The Card needs to run
the ball down Cal's throats
and not let its foot off the
gas pedal. Portland State al
most beat Cal, meaning that
Stanford has to demolish it.
Facing one of the worst de
fenses in the FBS, Kevin
Hogan needs to re-establish

rapport with his receivers
he has only completed 55
percent of his passes in the
last three games and
more importantly, needs to
rediscover the poise and
confidence in the pocket that
he had at the beginning of
the season.

David: In my opinion, the
game plan for the Cardinal
against Cal is very simple:
Play your style of football
and you will win easily. I
feel bad for Cal, as its pro
gram is going through the
growing pains of starting a
true freshman at quarter
back with a first-year head
coach and a brand new of
fensive system.
That being said, it would
be a waste of everyone's
time to break down this
matchup from a personnel
perspective, as Stanford's
talent and experience in all
three phases of the game
far exceeds that of Cal. Cal
fans know it. Stanford fans
know it. As such, there is no
need to dwell on this fact.
