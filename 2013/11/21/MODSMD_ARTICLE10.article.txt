## Passwords and Your Digital Identity 
### Omar Diab 
Once again, another tech behe
moth has fallen prey to a
massive security breach.
Adobe just experienced one of the
largest password attacks ever, leak
ing sensitive information of over
152 million Adobe customers. That
data includes encrypted passwords
that security researchers found
easy to compromise in fact, so
easy, that someone made a cross
word puzzle out of the compromised
passwords.
Passwords are broken. The only
way to fix them is to replace them
outright; but don't be fooled: the
password problem isn't just an im
plementation issue. It raises a fun
damental question on the nature of
the web: what does identity online
even mean?
Passwords have so many issues
that it is difficult to justify their
continued use. When developers
create their own password systems,
they tend to mess up. Adobe them
selves did although they en
crypted the passwords, they stored
users' password hints in plain text,
allowing intruders to crack a huge
number of passwords.
Software developers often fail to
even obfuscate passwords properly.
Sometimes they choose weak algo
rithms like MDS; often they fail to
"salt" passwords properly. Even
worse, systems should destroy
passwords so they can't ever be re
vealed, but some don't do that at all
(I'm looking at you, http://gostan
ford.com/. Your "Forgotten Pass
word" dialog shouldn't email me
nor be able to find my password!
Shame on you, Stanford Athletics.).
Users also play a part in com
promising password systems. Peo
ple tend to choose horribly insecure
passwords, as evidenced by the top
20 passwords from the Adobe leak.
And that's not even getting into
phishing and social engineering.
Additionally, every website has a
separate password system, and be
cause they are unwilling to work to
gether with other websites for a
common identity solution, they ask
you to come up with a different
password for every site, advice that
most people ignore (people, just use
one password service already!).
On top of that, either because
software developers want to force
users to use secure passwords, or
because they lack the technical
competence to sanitize data before
storing it, websites set stringent
and inconsistent rules for what
characters are allowed in pass
words and how long they have to be,
frustrating users to no end.
In business terms, many users
refuse to even try services because
of annoying and disparate pass
word systems. The madness has
gone too far.
But fundamentally, what do
username-password systems im
ply? Since a username and pass
word have no direct relationship to
one's "real life" identity, it suggests
that people "own" identities online.
Digital identity is nothing more
than property. It can be traded, and
users are responsible for protecting
their identity online.
This loose relationship makes
the need for users to come up with
and remember confusing and di
verse passwords both obvious and
necessary if someone else knows
your credentials, then they literally
are you in the eyes of most web

services. Because some services,
like social networks and e-com
merce, straddle the interface be
tween the virtual identities you own
and your real identity, a system like
this produces difficult security is
sues to solve.
It's not all bad news, though. By
making identity an object that one
owns rather than a piece of one's ac
tual identity, users can protect their
privacy by dissociating their online
activities from their reputations.
That disparity encourages people to
speak and act freely on the web.
Many large Silicon Valley com
panies like Google, Facebook and
Yahoo push "federated identity" as
a replacement for passwords. The
term refers to single sign-on solu
tions like Facebook Connect or
OpenlD-eompliant systems like the
Google, Yahoo and Stack Exchange
login systems. Indeed, these sys
tems offer convenience, speed and
security by allowing users to sign
on without creating and keeping
track of many passwords, and de
velopers can use the heavily tested
and scrutinized login systems that
Google and Facebook provide.
But there's a problem: compa
nies like Google and Facebook want
to know who you really are. Both
companies instated policies years
ago requiring that users disclose
their real names, and they also re
quest personal information like
your phone numbers and bank ac
counts.
Using federated login with ac
counts that are tied to your real
identity fundamentally breaks the
separation of your virtual and phys
ical identities. It allows increased
surveillance of your behaviors
throughout the web, threatening
the protection of free speech and
the process of innovation online.
Free Software Foundation
Chairman Richard Stallman ex
plains that in the modern era, the
maintenance of democracy depends
deeply on anonymity. If whistle
blowers cannot remain anonymous,
it becomes difficult to hold govern
ments accountable for their trans
gressions.
So what's the solution? Federat
ed login isn't necessarily the prob
lem; it's the fact that Facebook and
Google connections are so Ã¼biqui
tous, those companies are deter
mined to mind your real identity,
and users are generally uneducated
or passive about the security issues
at hand. Developers ought to offer
logins through OpenlD providers
that don't try to identify you when
ever they can, and users need to be
more cognizant of the information
they disclose when they click the
Facebook Connect button.
Even better, though, would be a
fully peer-to-peer identity network.
If no central authority owns your
identity, then ideally nobody could
snoop on it. Following the trend of
distributed systems like Bitcoin and
Bit Torrent, maybe the concept of
identity online can be decentralized
as well.
The next time you make an ac
count online, or build a website with
an account system, don't use pass
words. More importantly think
deeply about the choices you make;
the future of our society depends
on it.
