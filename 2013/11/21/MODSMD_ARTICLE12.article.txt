# Technology and Unemployment The Rising Tide
## 
### Rahul Gupta-Iwasaki 
With every period of radical
technological change has
come an equally significant
shift in the landscape of where peo
ple work. Driving these evolving la
bor patterns has been advancing
technology. This second part in my
series for the Daily on technological
unemployment examines why we
will see technology eat the job mar
ket from the middle out.
In just the 1900s, a century in
cluding revolutions in computing,
communications and transportation
as well as the invention of "the x
ray, wind tunnel, arc welder, circuit
breaker, transistor, Geiger counter,
laser,... fiber optics, [and] stainless
steel," the U.S. labor force "shifted
from industries dominated by pri
mary production occupations, such
as farmers and foresters, to those
dominated by professional, techni
cal, and service workers." By 1999,
farming employed less than three
percent of workers, down from 38
percent in 1900, while "goods-pro
ducing industries, such as mining,
manufacturing, and construction,"
employed only 19 percent, down
from 31 percent. On the other

hand, the services sector employed
a full 78 percent of the work force
at the end of the century, up from
only 31 percent at its start.
As the New York Times put it in
a piece on the assembly of the iPad,
"modernization has always caused
some kinds of jobs to change or dis
appear ... farmers became steel
workers, and then salesmen and
middle managers." Indeed, they
add, "these shifts have carried
many economic benefits, and in
general, with each progression,
even unskilled workers received
better wages and greater chances
at upward mobility."
Alas, this trend cannot continue
forever. In developed economies
we have reached a point where
each innovative cycle destroys
more mid-level jobs than it creates,
pushing the remaining jobs further
out of reach for many of those left
unemployed and increasing wealth
and opportunity disparity.
Mid-level or middle-skill posi
tions give the 73 percent of work
ing-age Americans without a bach
elor's degree a chance to make a
decent wage without advanced ed
ucation. But it is the very factors
that make mid-level jobs so attrac
tive to workers a decent wage
coupled with lower education and
skill requirements that also ren
der them so vulnerable to replace
ment by technology.
The way companies see them,
mid-level jobs represent a sweet
spot of savings they have the
perfect combination of higher la
bor costs and relative ease of au
tomation. As Adam Davidson de
scribes in the Atlantic, "common in
factories" is the practice of invest
ing "only in machinery that will
earn back its cost within two
years."
While a worker "makes less in
two years than [a] machine would
cost... her job is safe," but "if the
robotic machines become a little
cheaper" or demand goes up, "in
vesting in those robots might make
sense." In our profit-driven econo
my, the only jobs that survive are
those for which labor costs stay
smaller than the decreasing costs
of replacement technology.
At the same time as mid-level
jobs are eliminated, technology of
ten spurs job creation and wage in
creases for higher skilled positions,
leading some to herald increased
education as the solution to high
technology induced job displace

ment. Trumpets the New York
Times' Thomas Friedman, "there
are many things we need to do to
buttress unemployment, but noth
ing would be more important than
... [ensuring] that every American
has access to post-high school edu
cation."
While I can hardly say that I
don't believe in the power of educa
tion, this mindset fails to truly ap
preciate how far automating tech
nology will reach.
In 1978 computer scientist Mar
garet Boden noted how a very ba
sic program "for the diagnosis of
peptic ulcers" was rated by pa
tients as "more friendly, polite, re
laxing, and comprehensible than
the average physician." She ex
trapolated, musing, "These chas
tening observations about the su
periority of the personal habits of
programs over those of human doc
tors can doubtless be expected also
with regard to automatic lawyers,
bureaucrats, and teachers."
While we may not yet have au
tomatic lawyers or teachers, today,
companies like Blackstone Discov
ery are developing software that
has brought the price of legal
analysis of documents down by
over 500 percent since just 30
years ago.
Startups like Narrative Science
have programs that produce arti
cles for actual publications, with
quality improving so quickly that
founder Kris Hammond expects a
computer will win the Pulitzer
Prize within the next five years.
Advancing technology is knock
ing more and more job-based rungs
off the ladder to socioeconomic
achievement, making it ever more
unlikely that the already disadvan
taged will be able to cross the skill
gap to success.
And, none of us is immune. In
the words of Carnegie Mellon ro
botics researcher Hans Moravec,
"advancing computer performance
is like water slowly flooding the
landscape. A half-century ago it be
gan to drown the lowlands, driving
out human calculators and record
clerks, but leaving most of us dry.
Now the flood has reached the
foothills, and our outposts there are
contemplating retreat. We feel safe
on our peaks, but at the present
rate, those too will be submerged
within another half-century."
