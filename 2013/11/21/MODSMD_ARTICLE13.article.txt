## THROWBACK THURSDAY OT THRILLER IN BERKELEY Reliving Stanford's 36-30 win in the 2000 Big Game 
### STANFORD DAILY SPORTS STAFF 
The following is apostgame
analysis piece of the 103 rd Big
Game between Stanford and
Berkeley, originally published
in The Stanford Daily on
Monday, Nov. 20, 2000. Stan
ford beat Cat 36-30 in the first
Big Game to go to overtime, ex
tending Stanford's winning
streak over Cal to six games.
Cardinal fans, celebrate.
Pass the security guards and
their video cameras in Memorial
Stadium with pride, smirk at the
obnoxious Weenies along Cal's Fra
ternity Row with silent egoism and
celebrate.
And while you're celebrating yet
another Stanford Big Game victory,
take time to celebrate the number
six.
Sure, it might be numerology
nonsense, but the number six was
everywhere in this year's Big Game
festivities. Appropriately, here are
the top six examples:
1) The streaks. Stanford in
creased its winning streak against
Cal to six games, tying the longest
streak in the series' history. The
previous six-game winning streak
by the Cardinal ended in, of course,
1966.
Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham also extended his un
blemished record as head coach in
Big Games to 6-0. Willingham's sol
id decision-making over the past
few years helped allow this year's
group of seniors, including "Trench
Dogs" Willie Howard and Riall
Johnson, to finish their Stanford ca
reers without ever having to give
up the cherished axe.
"I'll always be able to say I nev
er lost to Cal," said Howard.

2) The MVP Sporting his num
ber six jersey, sophomore wide re
ceiver Luke Powell took home play
er of the game honors and for
good reason. Powell's 75-yard
touchdown reception from Randy
Fasani with 4:17 to play in the game
broke a 23-23 tie, giving the Cardi
nal a much-needed cushion.
Powell, a player whom Stanford
fans should get used to watching
over the next two seasons, created
all 75 yards on the reception. First,
he showed his speed by turning the

corner to beat Cal cornerback
Harold Pearson. Then, after ex
tending his arms toward the first
down marker, he easily passed Cal
safety Dewey Hale, who thought
Powell had run out of bounds.
3) The opponent. Also wearing a
number six jersey was Cal's run
ning back, Joe Igber. After being
held to only three yards in the first
half, Igber scored two touchdowns
in the second half, wreaking havoc
on the Cardinal defense.
Igber's first touchdown run for

27 yards gave Cal its only lead of
the game. His second touchdown
run, a 9-yard scamper through the
defensive line, tied the game at 30
and sent it to overtime.
4) The difference in the game's
score. Six points, 36-30, was all that
separated the two rivals. A crucial
six points they were. Fasani's 25-
yard touchdown pass to a wide
open Casey Moore came on a play
that had not been called all-season
long.
"We've been preparing all this
year for the right place and time to
run this play," said Willingham.
Good call, coach. Overtime of
the Big Game? Certainly the right
place, right time.
Moore, who wears number 33
(do the addition), has now played
key roles in the past two Big
Games, scoring two touchdowns
last year and two more this year, in
cluding the game-winning recep
tion from Fasani.
"[The pass] felt like it was sit
ting up there all day," Moore said.
"I was just trying to look it into my
hands, because I knew I was all
alone out there."
5) Turnovers. There were six
turnovers in all Stanford with
one and Cal with five. Cornerback
Brian Taylor, who wears the num
ber 15 (again, do the math), was an
unlikely hero in the first half with
two interceptions. His first inter
ception off Cal quarterback Kyle
Boiler in the second quarter set up
a scoring driving that extended the
Cardinal lead to 16-7.
6) Total points scored: 66. Be
lieve it or not, the 66 combined
points put up by Stanford and Cal
was the highest total in the 103-
year history of Big Game.
So, six was the magic number
for the Cardinal in the 103 rd Big
Game. Quite ironic, considering this
year's squad barely missed reach
ing the six-win minimum needed to
go to a postseason bowl game.
But to the fans, coaches and
players on Saturday, Big Game was
the postseason, and Stanford was

victorious.
So celebrate the win, Car
dinal fans, until next year
when the squad attempts to

extend its streak to lucky
number seven.
Too bad Willie Howard
won't be around.

was the highest total in the 103-
year history of Big Game.
So, six was the magic number
for the Cardinal in the 103 rd Big
Game. Quite ironic, considering this
year's squad barely missed reach
ing the six-win minimum needed to
go to a postseason bowl game.
But to the fans, coaches and
players on Saturday, Big Game was
the postseason, and Stanford was

number seven.

The following is apostgame
analysis piece of the 103 rd Big
Game between Stanford and
Berkeley, originally published
in The Stanford Daily on
Monday, Nov. 20, 2000. Stan
ford beat Cat 36-30 in the first
Big Game to go to overtime, ex
tending Stanford's winning
streak over Cal to six games.
Cardinal fans, celebrate.
Pass the security guards and
their video cameras in Memorial
Stadium with pride, smirk at the
obnoxious Weenies along Cal's Fra
ternity Row with silent egoism and
celebrate.
And while you're celebrating yet
another Stanford Big Game victory,
take time to celebrate the number
six.
Sure, it might be numerology
nonsense, but the number six was
everywhere in this year's Big Game
festivities. Appropriately, here are
the top six examples:
1) The streaks. Stanford in
creased its winning streak against
Cal to six games, tying the longest
streak in the series' history. The
previous six-game winning streak
by the Cardinal ended in, of course,
1966.
Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham also extended his un
blemished record as head coach in
Big Games to 6-0. Willingham's sol
id decision-making over the past
few years helped allow this year's
group of seniors, including "Trench
Dogs" Willie Howard and Riall
Johnson, to finish their Stanford ca
reers without ever having to give
up the cherished axe.
"I'll always be able to say I nev
er lost to Cal," said Howard.

2) The MVP Sporting his num
ber six jersey, sophomore wide re
ceiver Luke Powell took home play
er of the game honors and for
good reason. Powell's 75-yard
touchdown reception from Randy
Fasani with 4:17 to play in the game
broke a 23-23 tie, giving the Cardi
nal a much-needed cushion.
Powell, a player whom Stanford
fans should get used to watching
over the next two seasons, created
all 75 yards on the reception. First,
he showed his speed by turning the

corner to beat Cal cornerback
Harold Pearson. Then, after ex
tending his arms toward the first
down marker, he easily passed Cal
safety Dewey Hale, who thought
Powell had run out of bounds.
3) The opponent. Also wearing a
number six jersey was Cal's run
ning back, Joe Igber. After being
held to only three yards in the first
half, Igber scored two touchdowns
in the second half, wreaking havoc
on the Cardinal defense.
Igber's first touchdown run for

27 yards gave Cal its only lead of
the game. His second touchdown
run, a 9-yard scamper through the
defensive line, tied the game at 30
and sent it to overtime.
4) The difference in the game's
score. Six points, 36-30, was all that
separated the two rivals. A crucial
six points they were. Fasani's 25-
yard touchdown pass to a wide
open Casey Moore came on a play
that had not been called all-season
long.
"We've been preparing all this
year for the right place and time to
run this play," said Willingham.
Good call, coach. Overtime of
the Big Game? Certainly the right
place, right time.
Moore, who wears number 33
(do the addition), has now played
key roles in the past two Big
Games, scoring two touchdowns
last year and two more this year, in
cluding the game-winning recep
tion from Fasani.
"[The pass] felt like it was sit
ting up there all day," Moore said.
"I was just trying to look it into my
hands, because I knew I was all
alone out there."
5) Turnovers. There were six
turnovers in all Stanford with
one and Cal with five. Cornerback
Brian Taylor, who wears the num
ber 15 (again, do the math), was an
unlikely hero in the first half with
two interceptions. His first inter
ception off Cal quarterback Kyle
Boiler in the second quarter set up
a scoring driving that extended the
Cardinal lead to 16-7.
6) Total points scored: 66. Be
lieve it or not, the 66 combined
points put up by Stanford and Cal
was the highest total in the 103-
year history of Big Game.
So, six was the magic number
for the Cardinal in the 103 rd Big
Game. Quite ironic, considering this
