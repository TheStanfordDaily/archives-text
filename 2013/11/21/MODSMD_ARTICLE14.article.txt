# CARD FOCUSED FOR RIVALRY
## 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
A loss to a bitter rival, cou
pled with the gloomy, wet
weather at Tuesday's practice,
could easily put a damper on a
team's overall spirit. For the
Stanford Cardinal, however, in
tensity at practice remains as
high as ever due in large part to
the example set by the team's
senior leadership.
Head coach David Shaw pro
vided a few positive updates as

he looks to get his squad ready
to take on archrival Cal in the
116 th Big Game on Saturday.

For one, it has become ap
parent that no one has the abil
ity to stop senior running back
Tyler Gaffney from imposing
his will this season not even
his own head coach.
"We were going to hold
Tyler Gaffney out [of practice],
but he just said, 'No,'" said
head coach David Shaw, who

was planning on resting his star
running back. Shaw also went
on to praise Gaffney for his out
standing performance in prac
tice.
On the injury front, senior
kicker Jordan Williamson, who
was scratched from the lineup
at the last minute before the
USC game, saw a specialist to
examine his lingering leg issue.
Williamson was held out of
practice Tuesday, but he will be-

gin kicking again on
Wednesday. His status re

urday.
Alex Carter is out for Big
Game with a concussion.
Shaw had said Carter was
"banged up" against USC
before officially ruling him
out Wednesday evening. The
sophomore cornerback has
been held out of practice this
week.
While Carter's injury will

prior to its showdown with
Cal head coach Sonny
Dykes' pass-happy "Bear-
Raid" offense, Shaw an
nounced that the unit re
ceived a boost on Tuesday
with the return of sopho
more safety Zach Hoffpauir.
"[Hoffpauir] was all over
the place," Shaw said. "He
was running around and be
ing Zach, so we'll have him
back."

One of the positive offen
sive developments during
Stanford's last two games
has been the emergence of
wide receiver Michael Rec
tor, who led the team in re
ceiving yardage against Ore
gon and USC. Known prima
rily as a deep-ball threat, the
speedy sophomore found
success in the intermediate
passing game against the
Trojans.
"When you really estab
lish a deep presence," Rector
said, "you get other teams to
really respect that speed...
which opens up the under
neath routes."
Rector added that the
Stanford passing attack is
rapidly improving this sea
son as more receivers, in
cluding junior Jordan Pratt
and sophomore Kodi Whit
field, are becoming incorpo
rated into the offense.
Rector also noted that
Stanford receivers, who play
in a run-first offense, are cut
from a slightly different
cloth; they take pride in more
than just catching balls.

"We're really used to run
ning the ball a lot here so we
like blocking," Rector said.
"When we do call pass plays,
we get really excited so we
have extra adrenaline for
that... but we pride our
selves on blocking first."

This season, the Stanford
offense is ranked just 100 th
in the nation in red-zone
touchdown efficiency, reach
ing the end zone on just 54
percent of its trips inside the
20-yard line. At no time was
this statistic more glaring
than in the second half of
Stanford's game against
USC, when the Cardinal
failed to score on two red
zone possessions.
While many have criticized
Shaw for his play calling,
sophomore offensive lineman
Joshua Garnett insists that
success in the red zone de
pends on the men up front.
"On the offensive line, we
have to take it upon ourselves
when we get in the red zone,"
Garnett said. "It really
shouldn't matter what the
coach calls; the O-line has to

take it upon ourselves to do it
as best as we can and score in
the red zone to help our entire
team."
Garnett also said that the
mood in practice has been
heightened this week because
of the upcoming Big Game.
Garnett is excited to have so
many Stanford football alumni
on the sideline for the show
down with Cal, including
Richard Sherman 'lO, Zach
Ertz 'l3 and Levine Toilolo 'l3.
"We really want to estab
lish ourselves in this Big
Game," Garnett said, "and do
it for the guys that came be
fore us."
