## Stanford eyes Tigers at Maples 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
With the commencement of
the Progressive Legends Clas
sic tonight, it's safe to say that
the meat of Stanford men's bas
ketball's nonconference sched
ule has arrived. The Cardinal
(3-1) will host Texas Southern
(2-3) tonight at Maples Pavilion
before traveling to Brooklyn,
N.Y., next week for the final

two games of the event. There,
Stanford will play Houston and
then either Pittsburgh or Texas
Tech, depending on the results
of semifinal games.
The Cardinal has had a
bumpy start to begin the sea
son, with solid victories over
Bucknell, Northwestern and
Denver offset by a disappoint
ing home loss to BYU. After
surrendering 112 points
against BYU in the second

game of the season marking
the most the team had surren
dered at home since 1977 the
Cardinal has buckled down de
fensively, holding both North
western and Denver to under
60 points in a pair of victories.
While Stanford's play has at
times been inconsistent during
the young season, the Cardinal
has played second halves in
each of its most recent wins
that have showcased the
team's high potential. If
Stanford can start to turn
those good halves into full
40-minute performances, the
team should be a tough out
for anyone on the schedule.
At this stage in the sea
son, it would be impossible to
talk about Stanford basket
ball without mentioning jun
ior guard Chasson Randle,
who is off to a prodigious
start in his third season on
the Farm. The Illinois native
is averaging 23.5 points per
game on 57.1 percent shoot
ing, both best on the team.
His efficiency has been noth
ing short of spectacular, giv
en that he leads the team in
field goal percentage despite
shooting three more shots
per game on average than
the next Stanford player. His
scoring prowess has already
kept the Cardinal in several
games this season, and he
should continue to be a dif
ference-maker as the compe
tition ramps up.
The other player that has
Stanford basketball buzzing
thus far is senior guard An
thony Brown. Despite miss
ing most of last year with a
hip injury, Brown has been
in midseason form from the
get-go. Brown is averaging
13.5 points and 5.3 rebounds

per game while shooting 46.7
percent from three for Stan
ford, in addition to drawing
the toughest defensive as
signment on the perimeter
each night.
Against Texas Southern,
Randle, Brown and company
will have to contend with a
trio of talented offensive
scorers led by senior Aaric
Murray, a gifted player who
has already transferred
twice in his collegiate career
due to off-the-court trouble.
Murray has been taking ad
vantage of his final collegiate
campaign thus far, averaging
20.6 points and 6.8 rebounds
per game in the early part of
the season.
Complementing Murray
is senior guard Ray Penn, a
transfer from Oklahoma
State, and junior forward
Jose Rodriguez. Penn has
averages of better than 15
points and six assists per
game, while Rodriguez is
second on the team in scor
ing at 19.4 points per game
and leads the team in re
bounding with 8.4 boards
per game.
The Tigers, who won
their final 12 regular season
games a year ago, are the
heavy favorites to win the
Southwestern Athletic Con
ference this season, and
should be a good test for
Stanford heading into
Thanksgiving week. Tip-off
tonight is at 7 p.m.
