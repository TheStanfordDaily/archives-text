## Card takes down No. 3 Washington 
### JORDAN WALLACH STAFF WRITER 
What a difference a few weeks have
made for Stanford's women's volleyball
team and head coach John Dunning.
After the Cardinal's loss to then-No. 4
USC on Oct. 30, Dunning's postgame re
frain, "I'm angry because I didn't think it
had to end up this way," signified rock
bottom for a team that some had favored
to win the national title. Last night, Dun
ning, who rarely if ever shows emo
tion on the court, let loose an emphatic
fist pump and an ear-to-ear grin as Stan
ford upset the No. 3 Washington Huskies
in a straight-set victory, 25-19, 25-21, 25-
22, for Dunning's 799 th career win.

The No. 5 Cardinal (21-5,14-3 Pac-12)
played arguably its most dominant match
of the season in handling the Huskies (23-
2,15-2).
"After we lost [to USC], we made some
changes. We've been working really hard
on some things, but then you have to win
some," Dunning said. "We were all tired
coming into this week, but we did a good
job on the road and coming into this one,
we knew it would catapult us forward."
Stanford executed its game plan on
both the offensive and defensive sides of
the ball last night, and in doing so, avoid
ed ever falling too far behind the Huskies.
In an Oct. 20 match between the two
teams earlier this season, Washington
dominated with it serve, tallying 10 aces.
Last night, however, the Cardinal limited
the Huskies to just one ace and was able
to control the dig, setting up a strong of
fensive attack.
"When three of your primary passers
are hitters, the other team is going to
serve them when they have to hit," Dun
ning said. "After a while, even though
they're really good passers, they start to
think about hitting before they finish
passing. And so that's been a focus for
three weeks now focusing on making
sure they pass before they go to hit."
That focus worked for sophomore set
ter Madi Bugg, who tallied 38 assists in
the match.
