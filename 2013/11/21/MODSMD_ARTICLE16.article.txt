## Card takes down No. 3 Washington 
### JORDAN WALLACH STAFF WRITER 
What a difference a few weeks have
made for Stanford's women's volleyball
team and head coach John Dunning.
After the Cardinal's loss to then-No. 4
USC on Oct. 30, Dunning's postgame re
frain, "I'm angry because I didn't think it
had to end up this way," signified rock
bottom for a team that some had favored
to win the national title. Last night, Dun
ning, who rarely if ever shows emo
tion on the court, let loose an emphatic
fist pump and an ear-to-ear grin as Stan
ford upset the No. 3 Washington Huskies
in a straight-set victory, 25-19, 25-21, 25-
22, for Dunning's 799 th career win.

The No. 5 Cardinal (21-5,14-3 Pac-12)
played arguably its most dominant match
of the season in handling the Huskies (23-
2,15-2).
"After we lost [to USC], we made some
changes. We've been working really hard
on some things, but then you have to win
some," Dunning said. "We were all tired
coming into this week, but we did a good
job on the road and coming into this one,
we knew it would catapult us forward."
Stanford executed its game plan on
both the offensive and defensive sides of
the ball last night, and in doing so, avoid
ed ever falling too far behind the Huskies.
In an Oct. 20 match between the two
teams earlier this season, Washington
dominated with it serve, tallying 10 aces.
Last night, however, the Cardinal limited
the Huskies to just one ace and was able
to control the dig, setting up a strong of
fensive attack.
"When three of your primary passers
are hitters, the other team is going to
serve them when they have to hit," Dun
ning said. "After a while, even though
they're really good passers, they start to
think about hitting before they finish
passing. And so that's been a focus for
three weeks now focusing on making
sure they pass before they go to hit."
That focus worked for sophomore set
ter Madi Bugg, who tallied 38 assists in
the match.

The Cardinal came out
slow to start the first set,
falling behind 5-1 before
Dunning called a timeout.
Huskies outside hitter
Krista Vansant, the reigning
Pac-12 offensive player of
the week, made her presence
known early, recording
Washington's first three
kills. Yet the timeout proved
to be key for the Card, as
Stanford won four of the
next six points to keep the
set from getting out of hand.
Though it had a hard time
receiving Huskies' serve
early on, as it did in the first
match between the two
teams, Stanford ran away
with the set later on with
strong outside play from
senior Rachel Williams, who
tallied a team-high 11 kills in
the match. The Cardinal out
hit the Huskies .433 to .211
in the opening frame, and
Stanford's mark was its
highest in a set since its Nov.
8 match at Colorado.
The second set was a
thriller in which Stanford
found itself behind early and
often. Yet the turning point,
once again, came shortly af
ter a Dunning timeout.
Down 20-21, sophomore out
side hitter Jordan Burgess

evened the score with a solo
block and kill. The next
point, Burgess found anoth
er hole in the Husky defense
to give the Cardinal its first
lead in the set since an earli
er 9-8 advantage. Stanford
didn't drop another point in
the set to take a two-game

i v_y i i i i v_> i v i i i i i v_s •
lead.
Washington was held to
just a .100 hitting percent
age in that second set, re
flecting the strong play of a
Cardinal defense that en
tered Wednesday's match
ranked fourth in the nation
in blocking. Stanford record-

Ed seven of its 10 team
blocks in that set.
The Cardinal never sur
rendered the lead in the
third set after going up 4-3
early on, earning its 17th
sweep of the season. And
during the match, junior
libero Kyle Gilbert passed
Kerri Walsh 'OO for fifth on
Stanford's all-time digs list
with 1,295.
While the Cardinal still
needs help from at least one
of the Huskies' remaining
three opponents to have a
shot at winning its seventh
Pac-12 title in the last eight
years, the significance of this
victory lies beyond the con
ference standings.
"Our team is finally com
ing together and playing like
we knew...we could at the
beginning of the season,"
said sophomore outside hit
ter Inky Ajanaku. "It's final
ly happening for us right
now, and it's great because
it's right before the tourna
ment exactly when any
team would want that to hap
pen."
Stanford continues what
it hopes to be a champi
onship run on Friday against
Washington State. The
match is set for 6 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion and will be

Krista Vansant, the reigning
Pac-12 offensive player of
the week, made her presence
known early, recording
Washington's first three
kills. Yet the timeout proved
to be key for the Card, as
Stanford won four of the
next six points to keep the
set from getting out of hand.
Though it had a hard time
receiving Huskies' serve
early on, as it did in the first
match between the two
teams, Stanford ran away
with the set later on with
strong outside play from
senior Rachel Williams, who
tallied a team-high 11 kills in
the match. The Cardinal out
hit the Huskies .433 to .211
in the opening frame, and
Stanford's mark was its
highest in a set since its Nov.
8 match at Colorado.
The second set was a
thriller in which Stanford
found itself behind early and
often. Yet the turning point,
once again, came shortly af
ter a Dunning timeout.
Down 20-21, sophomore out
side hitter Jordan Burgess

evened the score with a solo
block and kill. The next
point, Burgess found anoth
er hole in the Husky defense
to give the Cardinal its first
lead in the set since an earli
er 9-8 advantage. Stanford
didn't drop another point in
the set to take a two-game

lead.
Washington was held to
just a .100 hitting percent
age in that second set, re
flecting the strong play of a
Cardinal defense that en
tered Wednesday's match
ranked fourth in the nation
in blocking. Stanford record-

Ed seven of its 10 team
blocks in that set.
The Cardinal never sur
rendered the lead in the
third set after going up 4-3
early on, earning its 17th
sweep of the season. And
during the match, junior
libero Kyle Gilbert passed
Kerri Walsh 'OO for fifth on
Stanford's all-time digs list
with 1,295.
While the Cardinal still
needs help from at least one
of the Huskies' remaining
three opponents to have a
shot at winning its seventh
Pac-12 title in the last eight
years, the significance of this
victory lies beyond the con
ference standings.
"Our team is finally com
ing together and playing like
we knew...we could at the
beginning of the season,"
said sophomore outside hit

it's right before the tourna

Stanford continues what
it hopes to be a champi

Senior Rachel Williams (above) led the Card with 11 kills
in its straight-set upset of No. 3 Washington Wednesday.
The win kept Stanford in contention for the Pac-12 title.
What a difference a few weeks have
made for Stanford's women's volleyball
team and head coach John Dunning.
After the Cardinal's loss to then-No. 4
USC on Oct. 30, Dunning's postgame re
frain, "I'm angry because I didn't think it
had to end up this way," signified rock
bottom for a team that some had favored
to win the national title. Last night, Dun
ning, who rarely if ever shows emo
tion on the court, let loose an emphatic
fist pump and an ear-to-ear grin as Stan
ford upset the No. 3 Washington Huskies
in a straight-set victory, 25-19, 25-21, 25-
22, for Dunning's 799 th career win.

The No. 5 Cardinal (21-5,14-3 Pac-12)
played arguably its most dominant match
of the season in handling the Huskies (23-
2,15-2).
"After we lost [to USC], we made some
changes. We've been working really hard
on some things, but then you have to win
some," Dunning said. "We were all tired
coming into this week, but we did a good
job on the road and coming into this one,
we knew it would catapult us forward."
Stanford executed its game plan on
both the offensive and defensive sides of
the ball last night, and in doing so, avoid
ed ever falling too far behind the Huskies.
In an Oct. 20 match between the two
teams earlier this season, Washington
dominated with it serve, tallying 10 aces.
Last night, however, the Cardinal limited
the Huskies to just one ace and was able
to control the dig, setting up a strong of
fensive attack.
"When three of your primary passers
are hitters, the other team is going to
serve them when they have to hit," Dun
ning said. "After a while, even though
they're really good passers, they start to
think about hitting before they finish
passing. And so that's been a focus for
three weeks now focusing on making
sure they pass before they go to hit."
That focus worked for sophomore set
ter Madi Bugg, who tallied 38 assists in
the match.
