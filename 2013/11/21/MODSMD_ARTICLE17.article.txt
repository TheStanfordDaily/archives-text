# Cal hatred a level above USC rivalry
## 
### Winston Shi 
The Stanford University Ath
letic Department claims to
have three rivals: Cal, USC
and Notre Dame. Cardinal
football has played these
three teams a combined 233 times, and
it would not be the same program with
out these opponents. That much we can
say for sure.
Part of this sentiment, however, is
window dressing. First off, Notre
Dame is not really Stanford's rival.
Both fan bases recognize that Notre
Dame is a mutually beneficial schedul
ing agreement. Stanford wants to play
the Irish because it's a legendary pro
gram. Notre Dame wants to play Stan
ford because of California recruiting,
and because Stanford is academically
Notre Dame's self-described "aspira
tional peer." But the series was visceral
ly irrelevant to Notre Dame when
Stanford was bad, and now that Stan
ford can go punch-for-punch with the
Irish, it's still just a big game for both
sides —the Irish's field rush last year
notwithstanding.
Like those at Notre Dame, most
Stanford fans would much rather beat
USC. USC is a program on Notre
Dame's level, but far worse than that, it
is in Stanford's backyard. I had the
pleasure of interviewing the popular
USC blogger Zack Jerome via email
shortly after Saturday's game, and he
had a few points about how far Stan
ford still needs to go if it will call itself
the Thojans' equal.
♦ ♦♦
The Trojan football program
which Jerome cheerfully likens to
Darth Vader doesn't throw the
term "rivalry" around lightly.
"The USC-Stanford game has
only been a game to circle in recent
years, mostly because winning five of
six will do that," Jerome said. "In the
end, there [are] teams that rise up
and offer periods of competition that
heighten the experience for Trojan
fans, but rivalries are limited to
UCLA and Notre Dame."
I should probably disagree: Even
on the Coliseum video board, USC
was calling Stanford its "oldest rival."
But, distasteful as it sounds, Jerome
is right. Some games are only inter
mittently significant; Washington un
der Don James comes to mind, and if
Oregon crashes back to Earth per
haps we'll view the Ducks in a similar
light.
But what about Stanford? Crystal
footballs aside, there is no greater
symbol of significance in college foot
ball than the field rush. When Stan
ford rashes, it implies that it doesn't
expect victory to happen very often,
and when USC and Notre Dame rush
for Stanford much as Jerome
would like to argue otherwise —it
implies that beating Stanford means
something.
Sitting in the suddenly empty
USC student section last Saturday in
disbelief, my first feeling was, natu
rally, sadness. But my second feeling
was something more along the lines
of, Wow now that's respect. Stan
ford hadn't just taken advantage of
USC during its sanctions; Stanford
had thrashed USC with Pete Carroll
at the helm. Two generations of USC
students had passed through Univer
sity Park without seeing the Trojans
beat the Cardinal at the Coliseum.
Alabama does not rush the field.
Florida State does not rash the field.
These programs expect not just
greatness but glory. But for Stan
ford, Southern Cal rushed the field.
Jerome explained the USC field
rash last Saturday not as a sign of re
spect but as a milestone for the well
sanctioned football program.
"I am wildly against us rushing
the field, as were many of my read
ers," Jerome wrote. "That said, if you
are going to rash a field, that's the
time. You fire your coach and go on
an improbable run. You play injured.
You play with walk-ons. You do this
because the NCAA gave you a penal
ty that is inexplicable, especially
when compared to every other hear
ing and ruling since."
"Saturday is a reminder that once
the hands get untied, it will eventual
ly return to a long period of domi
nance ... I don't think a team has
done enough in USC's 'down' era to
cement [itself] when USC actually
can recruit and travel a full football
team."
I don't think Jerome's claims of a
"Pac-1" are true, and I also think it's
clear that beating Stanford had
something to do with USC's jubila
tion. But until Stanford can prove

that it can hang with the Tro
jans for a couple more
decades, there's no reason to
believe Jerome is wrong
about USC itself. Southern
Cal has earned the benefit of
the doubt.
"USC is the only team in
the conference that has re
turned to great heights each
time they fell," Jerome said.
Even though everything
signals that Stanford is here
to stay, the Cardinal hasn't
earned that tradition. Not yet.
Saturday was the first Stan
ford loss I've witnessed in
person, but more than that, it
was a reminder after four
years of victories that beating
the University of Southern
California is not a birthright.

The breaks of the game
are fickle, and only sustained
excellence can build a history
a tradition —of winning.
Some things you cannot buy
with money. Greatness comes
at a more painful price; if you
raise your expectations, losing
hurts all the more. The chief
requirement of greatness is
being relevant long enough to
play a lot of big games. Some
games you win, some games
you lose, and if you play
enough important games
you'll have a lot of wins.
You'll also lose a lot of
them, some by achingly close
scores. Oregon was a play
away from winning a national
championship in 2011. Last
Saturday, Stanford was a play
away from beating USC. It
doesn't matter that USC
kicked a 47-yard field goal, a
50-50 shot at best, in order to
pull ahead. It doesn't matter
that USC only got into posi
tion for that field goal by com
pleting a difficult pass to a
gimpy receiver, also a 50-50
shot at best. It doesn't matter
that USC was rated by Vegas

as just a three-point under
dog, and that advanced com
puter systems like the ones
Vegas uses considered the
Trojans a top-10 team. There
are no moral victories.
As Stanford readies to wel
come the Golden Bears the
Beat Cal banner on Meyer Li
brary, the Bearial at the Claw,
the fountains bathed in red
I want Stanford to deny Cal
even a moral victory. I want
the Cardinal to trounce the
Bears in ways they can't even
imagine. Here is my predic
tion ahead of time: Stanford
by 50. The Cardinal runs over
the Bears' front seven to the
point that David Shaw orders
Stanford's backups to chuck
the ball in the fomth quarter
out of pity. A day later Memo
rial Stadium collapses into the
Hayward Fault.
We may hate USC because
of a century of matchups and
because the Trojans are tradi
tionally good, but we hate Cal
because destiny saw it fit to
place two great universities on
opposite sides of San Francis
co Bay. As time goes on, beat
ing USC may become less sig
nificant, or even more signifi
cant— who knows? I don't
have a crystal ball. But no
matter who wins or who loses
Saturday's Big Game, the 115
Big Games before that or all
the Big Games to come, Cal
will always be here.
It doesn't matter whether
Cal is losing to Colorado or on
top of the world, and it's equal
ly irrelevant whether Stan
ford is beating USC four times
on the bounce or losing to UC-
Davis. It's Hate Week, and the
Bears are going down. See
you then.

The Stanford University Ath
letic Department claims to
have three rivals: Cal, USC
and Notre Dame. Cardinal
football has played these
three teams a combined 233 times, and
it would not be the same program with
out these opponents. That much we can
say for sure.
Part of this sentiment, however, is
window dressing. First off, Notre
Dame is not really Stanford's rival.
Both fan bases recognize that Notre
Dame is a mutually beneficial schedul
ing agreement. Stanford wants to play
the Irish because it's a legendary pro
gram. Notre Dame wants to play Stan
ford because of California recruiting,
and because Stanford is academically
Notre Dame's self-described "aspira
tional peer." But the series was visceral
ly irrelevant to Notre Dame when
Stanford was bad, and now that Stan
ford can go punch-for-punch with the
Irish, it's still just a big game for both
sides —the Irish's field rush last year
notwithstanding.
Like those at Notre Dame, most
Stanford fans would much rather beat
USC. USC is a program on Notre
Dame's level, but far worse than that, it
is in Stanford's backyard. I had the
pleasure of interviewing the popular
USC blogger Zack Jerome via email
shortly after Saturday's game, and he
had a few points about how far Stan
ford still needs to go if it will call itself
the Thojans' equal.
♦ ♦♦
The Trojan football program
which Jerome cheerfully likens to
Darth Vader doesn't throw the
term "rivalry" around lightly.
"The USC-Stanford game has
only been a game to circle in recent
years, mostly because winning five of
six will do that," Jerome said. "In the
end, there [are] teams that rise up
and offer periods of competition that
heighten the experience for Trojan
fans, but rivalries are limited to
UCLA and Notre Dame."
I should probably disagree: Even
on the Coliseum video board, USC
was calling Stanford its "oldest rival."
But, distasteful as it sounds, Jerome
is right. Some games are only inter
mittently significant; Washington un
der Don James comes to mind, and if
Oregon crashes back to Earth per
haps we'll view the Ducks in a similar
light.
But what about Stanford? Crystal
footballs aside, there is no greater
symbol of significance in college foot
ball than the field rush. When Stan
ford rashes, it implies that it doesn't
expect victory to happen very often,
and when USC and Notre Dame rush
for Stanford much as Jerome
would like to argue otherwise —it
implies that beating Stanford means
something.
Sitting in the suddenly empty
USC student section last Saturday in
disbelief, my first feeling was, natu
rally, sadness. But my second feeling
was something more along the lines
of, Wow now that's respect. Stan
ford hadn't just taken advantage of
USC during its sanctions; Stanford
had thrashed USC with Pete Carroll
at the helm. Two generations of USC
students had passed through Univer
sity Park without seeing the Trojans
beat the Cardinal at the Coliseum.
Alabama does not rush the field.
Florida State does not rash the field.
These programs expect not just
greatness but glory. But for Stan
ford, Southern Cal rushed the field.
Jerome explained the USC field
rash last Saturday not as a sign of re
spect but as a milestone for the well
sanctioned football program.
"I am wildly against us rushing
the field, as were many of my read
ers," Jerome wrote. "That said, if you
are going to rash a field, that's the
time. You fire your coach and go on
an improbable run. You play injured.
You play with walk-ons. You do this
because the NCAA gave you a penal
ty that is inexplicable, especially
when compared to every other hear
ing and ruling since."
"Saturday is a reminder that once
the hands get untied, it will eventual
ly return to a long period of domi
nance ... I don't think a team has
done enough in USC's 'down' era to
cement [itself] when USC actually
can recruit and travel a full football
team."
I don't think Jerome's claims of a
"Pac-1" are true, and I also think it's
clear that beating Stanford had
something to do with USC's jubila
tion. But until Stanford can prove

that it can hang with the Tro
jans for a couple more
decades, there's no reason to
believe Jerome is wrong
about USC itself. Southern
Cal has earned the benefit of
the doubt.
"USC is the only team in
the conference that has re
turned to great heights each
time they fell," Jerome said.
Even though everything
signals that Stanford is here
to stay, the Cardinal hasn't
earned that tradition. Not yet.
Saturday was the first Stan
ford loss I've witnessed in
person, but more than that, it
was a reminder after four
years of victories that beating
the University of Southern
California is not a birthright.

The breaks of the game

Some things you cannot buy
with money. Greatness comes
at a more painful price; if you
raise your expectations, losing
hurts all the more. The chief
requirement of greatness is
being relevant long enough to
play a lot of big games. Some
games you win, some games
you lose, and if you play
enough important games
you'll have a lot of wins.
You'll also lose a lot of
them, some by achingly close
scores. Oregon was a play
away from winning a national
championship in 2011. Last
Saturday, Stanford was a play
away from beating USC. It
doesn't matter that USC
kicked a 47-yard field goal, a
50-50 shot at best, in order to
pull ahead. It doesn't matter
that USC only got into posi
tion for that field goal by com
pleting a difficult pass to a
gimpy receiver, also a 50-50
shot at best. It doesn't matter
that USC was rated by Vegas

as just a three-point under
dog, and that advanced com
puter systems like the ones
Vegas uses considered the
Trojans a top-10 team. There
are no moral victories.
As Stanford readies to wel

the Cardinal to trounce the

the Bears' front seven to the
point that David Shaw orders
Stanford's backups to chuck
the ball in the fomth quarter
out of pity. A day later Memo
rial Stadium collapses into the
Hayward Fault.
We may hate USC because
of a century of matchups and
because the Trojans are tradi

because destiny saw it fit to

Vegas uses considered the
Trojans a top-10 team. There
are no moral victories.
As Stanford readies to wel
come the Golden Bears the
Beat Cal banner on Meyer Li
brary, the Bearial at the Claw,
the fountains bathed in red
I want Stanford to deny Cal
even a moral victory. I want
the Cardinal to trounce the
Bears in ways they can't even
imagine. Here is my predic
tion ahead of time: Stanford
by 50. The Cardinal runs over
the Bears' front seven to the
point that David Shaw orders
Stanford's backups to chuck
the ball in the fomth quarter
out of pity. A day later Memo
rial Stadium collapses into the
Hayward Fault.
We may hate USC because
of a century of matchups and
because the Trojans are tradi
tionally good, but we hate Cal
because destiny saw it fit to
place two great universities on
opposite sides of San Francis
co Bay. As time goes on, beat
ing USC may become less sig
nificant, or even more signifi
cant— who knows? I don't
have a crystal ball. But no
matter who wins or who loses
Saturday's Big Game, the 115
Big Games before that or all
the Big Games to come, Cal
will always be here.
It doesn't matter whether
Cal is losing to Colorado or on
top of the world, and it's equal
ly irrelevant whether Stan
ford is beating USC four times
on the bounce or losing to UC-
Davis. It's Hate Week, and the
Bears are going down. See
you then.

Even during Hate Week, Big
Brother is always watching
Winston, If you're mad that
Shi forgot to mention Stan
ford's 27-10 win in the 1981
Big Game, remind him. that
Stanford is at war with Cat
and has always been at war
