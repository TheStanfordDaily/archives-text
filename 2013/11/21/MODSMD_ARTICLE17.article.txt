# Cal hatred a level above USC rivalry
## 
### Winston Shi 
The Stanford University Ath
letic Department claims to
have three rivals: Cal, USC
and Notre Dame. Cardinal
football has played these
three teams a combined 233 times, and
it would not be the same program with
out these opponents. That much we can
say for sure.
Part of this sentiment, however, is
window dressing. First off, Notre
Dame is not really Stanford's rival.
Both fan bases recognize that Notre
Dame is a mutually beneficial schedul
ing agreement. Stanford wants to play
the Irish because it's a legendary pro
gram. Notre Dame wants to play Stan
ford because of California recruiting,
and because Stanford is academically
Notre Dame's self-described "aspira
tional peer." But the series was visceral
ly irrelevant to Notre Dame when
Stanford was bad, and now that Stan
ford can go punch-for-punch with the
Irish, it's still just a big game for both
sides —the Irish's field rush last year
notwithstanding.
Like those at Notre Dame, most
Stanford fans would much rather beat
USC. USC is a program on Notre
Dame's level, but far worse than that, it
is in Stanford's backyard. I had the
pleasure of interviewing the popular
USC blogger Zack Jerome via email
shortly after Saturday's game, and he
had a few points about how far Stan
ford still needs to go if it will call itself
the Thojans' equal.

The Trojan football program
which Jerome cheerfully likens to
Darth Vader doesn't throw the
term "rivalry" around lightly.
"The USC-Stanford game has
only been a game to circle in recent
years, mostly because winning five of
six will do that," Jerome said. "In the
end, there [are] teams that rise up
and offer periods of competition that
heighten the experience for Trojan
fans, but rivalries are limited to
UCLA and Notre Dame."
I should probably disagree: Even
on the Coliseum video board, USC
was calling Stanford its "oldest rival."
But, distasteful as it sounds, Jerome
is right. Some games are only inter
mittently significant; Washington un
der Don James comes to mind, and if
Oregon crashes back to Earth per
haps we'll view the Ducks in a similar
light.
But what about Stanford? Crystal
footballs aside, there is no greater
symbol of significance in college foot
ball than the field rush. When Stan
ford rashes, it implies that it doesn't
expect victory to happen very often,
and when USC and Notre Dame rush
for Stanford much as Jerome
would like to argue otherwise —it
implies that beating Stanford means
something.
Sitting in the suddenly empty
USC student section last Saturday in
disbelief, my first feeling was, natu
rally, sadness. But my second feeling
was something more along the lines
of, Wow now that's respect. Stan
ford hadn't just taken advantage of
USC during its sanctions; Stanford
had thrashed USC with Pete Carroll
at the helm. Two generations of USC
students had passed through Univer
sity Park without seeing the Trojans
beat the Cardinal at the Coliseum.
Alabama does not rush the field.
Florida State does not rash the field.
These programs expect not just
greatness but glory. But for Stan
ford, Southern Cal rushed the field.
Jerome explained the USC field
rash last Saturday not as a sign of re
spect but as a milestone for the well
sanctioned football program.
"I am wildly against us rushing
the field, as were many of my read
ers," Jerome wrote. "That said, if you
are going to rash a field, that's the
time. You fire your coach and go on
an improbable run. You play injured.
You play with walk-ons. You do this
because the NCAA gave you a penal
ty that is inexplicable, especially
when compared to every other hear
ing and ruling since."
"Saturday is a reminder that once
the hands get untied, it will eventual
ly return to a long period of domi
nance ... I don't think a team has
done enough in USC's 'down' era to
cement [itself] when USC actually
can recruit and travel a full football
team."
I don't think Jerome's claims of a
"Pac-1" are true, and I also think it's
clear that beating Stanford had
something to do with USC's jubila
tion. But until Stanford can prove
