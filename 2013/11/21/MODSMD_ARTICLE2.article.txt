# STUDENT LIFE
## Typhoon relief efforts continue 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
Geraldine "Dindin" Baniqued 'l4 was shocked
when she heard that Typhoon Haiyan struck the
Philippines, her home country, on Nov. 8.
The International Relief and Development non
profit humanitarian group estimates over 10,000 dead
and around 10 million affected by what is being called
one of the most powerful storms in history.
Amid international and national relief efforts, the
Stanford community and the city of Palo Alto are doing
their part to help those in need.
For immediate relief, Stanford's Pilipino American

Student Union (PASU) —which Baniqued co-chairs
is directing the Stanford community to donate to
the nonprofit National Alliance for Filipino Concerns
(NAFCON).
Last week PASU held a three-day tabling event in
White Plaza where they encouraged students to make
online monetary donations to NAFCON.
At first PASU members collected cash donations,
but upon realizing University policy that prohibits
cash solicitations in White Plaza they subsequently re
sorted to sharing information on how to make online
donations.

The Pilipino American Student Union tabled at White Plaza last week to collect online donations for the
National Alliance for Filipino Concerns (NAFCON) to support typhoon relief in the Philippines.
PASU co-chair Jomar
Sevilla 'l4 said that while the
group ultimately did manage
to get several students to do
nate online and continues to
encourage students to digital
ly contribute to NAFCON, it
was disappointing to have to
turn away any cash donations
after the first day of tabling.
"It was an obstacle and I
think it kind of prevented us
from really reaching as much
funding as we could for White
Plaza," Sevilla said.
Beyond fundraising ef
forts, various groups and indi
viduals eager to help spread
the word of how to lend a
hand overseas have also ap
proached PASU.
The National Association
for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP)
reached out to PASU to host a
community gathering this
past Monday consisting of an
information session on Ty
phoon Haiyan's impact, a re
flection of the tragedy and a
vigil for those affected.
Baniqued explained that
the NAACP provided the
space and logistical equip
ment and also helped with the
setup and takedown of the
event.
"We don't do too many
events with [the NAACP] and
them reaching out to us just
kind of showed us that this
tragedy that happened in the
Philippines was indeed some
thing that united all the com
munities at Stanford," Ban
iqued said.
Baniqued described other
examples of community out
reach, including staff mem
bers in the department of

Electrical Engineering set
ting up a donation box for re
lief efforts and asking PASU
to provide informational
handouts on the storm's im
pact, and the Graduate Stu
dent Council asking PASU to
attend a Thanksgiving dinner
to inform guests and collect
donations.
PASU is also currently in
the process of forming a task
force dedicated to cultivating
discussions on how local com
munities can best meet the
on-going needs of those af
fected by the storm. Such
needs include addressing so
cio-political issues in the
Philippines.
While PASU is leading the
charge, Baniqued and Sevilla
explained how membership
for the new task force is open
to everyone on and off cam
pus who is willing to help out.
Baniqued added that
though the task force's explic
it goals are yet to be deter
mined, one of the biggest
things it will handle is to keep
track of vaiious fundraising
and information events
across communities.
Just next door to PASU's
on campus efforts, the Palo
Alto City Council has agreed
to donate $lO,OOO out of its
contingency fund towards its
Pilipino sister city Palo in
Leyte Island that was hit by
the typhoon, according to
Claudia Keith, chief commu
nications officer of Palo Alto.
Through coordination with
the nonprofit Neighbors
Abroad, Palo Alto has sister
cities around the world, with
Palo in the Philippines being
the first. Ruth Carleton,
Neighbors Abroad Vice Pres
ident in charge of Palo, ex
plained that the organization
sponsors a children's library
in Palo and provides the
salaries of two Pilipina librar

ians there.
As Neighbors Abroad
continues to collect funds to
send over to Palo, Carleton is
worried about how little di
rect communication the or
ganization has with the region
and the sparse knowledge of
the librarians' whereabouts.
"We know nothing about
what has happened with
them, dear wonderful amaz
ing ladies, and we don't know
if they're okay," Carleton
said.
While Baniqued's rela
tives are unaffected by the
storm, she and Sevilla recog
nize the devastation sur
vivors are facing and amidst
the tragedy, they see an op
portunity to more openly dis
cuss how much of an impact
PASU can have from the
states.
"Often at Stanford all the
different organizations and
[Voluntary Student Organi
zations] live in their own bub
ble but we need to start look
ing out and seeing and know
that these people are our
people and that they're also
affected by this and that we
should look out for them,"
Sevilla said.
Be it through monetary
donations to organizations
like NAFCON and Neigh
bors Abroad or simply offer
ing a prayer of Thanksgiving
to the numerous victims and
survivors, Sevilla said he is
touched by how the local com
munity has come together to
attend to those in need.
"This is just the Stanford
community, but if the Stan
ford community can bring
this to all their outside com
munity, I'm sure we are a re
ally far reaching network,"
Sevilla said.

Philippines was indeed some
thing that united all the com
munities at Stanford," Ban
iqued said.
Baniqued described other
examples of community out
reach, including staff mem
bers in the department of

Electrical Engineering set
ting up a donation box for re
lief efforts and asking PASU
to provide informational
handouts on the storm's im
pact, and the Graduate Stu
dent Council asking PASU to
attend a Thanksgiving dinner
to inform guests and collect
donations.
PASU is also currently in
the process of forming a task
force dedicated to cultivating
discussions on how local com
munities can best meet the
on-going needs of those af
fected by the storm. Such
needs include addressing so
cio-political issues in the
Philippines.
While PASU is leading the
charge, Baniqued and Sevilla
explained how membership
for the new task force is open
to everyone on and off cam
pus who is willing to help out.
Baniqued added that
though the task force's explic
it goals are yet to be deter
mined, one of the biggest
things it will handle is to keep
track of vaiious fundraising
and information events
across communities.
Just next door to PASU's
on campus efforts, the Palo
Alto City Council has agreed
to donate $lO,OOO out of its
contingency fund towards its
Pilipino sister city Palo in
Leyte Island that was hit by
the typhoon, according to
Claudia Keith, chief commu
nications officer of Palo Alto.
Through coordination with
the nonprofit Neighbors
Abroad, Palo Alto has sister
cities around the world, with
Palo in the Philippines being
the first. Ruth Carleton,
Neighbors Abroad Vice Pres
ident in charge of Palo, ex
plained that the organization
sponsors a children's library
in Palo and provides the
salaries of two Pilipina librar

ians there.
As Neighbors Abroad
continues to collect funds to
send over to Palo, Carleton is
worried about how little di
rect communication the or
ganization has with the region
and the sparse knowledge of
the librarians' whereabouts.
"We know nothing about
what has happened with
them, dear wonderful amaz
ing ladies, and we don't know
if they're okay," Carleton
said.
While Baniqued's rela
tives are unaffected by the
storm, she and Sevilla recog
nize the devastation sur
vivors are facing and amidst
the tragedy, they see an op
portunity to more openly dis
cuss how much of an impact
PASU can have from the
states.
"Often at Stanford all the
different organizations and
[Voluntary Student Organi
zations] live in their own bub
ble but we need to start look
ing out and seeing and know
that these people are our
people and that they're also
affected by this and that we
should look out for them,"
Sevilla said.
Be it through monetary
donations to organizations
like NAFCON and Neigh
bors Abroad or simply offer
ing a prayer of Thanksgiving
to the numerous victims and
survivors, Sevilla said he is
touched by how the local com
munity has come together to
attend to those in need.
"This is just the Stanford
community, but if the Stan
ford community can bring
this to all their outside com
munity, I'm sure we are a re
ally far reaching network,"
Sevilla said.

Geraldine "Dindin" Baniqued 'l4 was shocked
when she heard that Typhoon Haiyan struck the
Philippines, her home country, on Nov. 8.
The International Relief and Development non
profit humanitarian group estimates over 10,000 dead
and around 10 million affected by what is being called
one of the most powerful storms in history.
Amid international and national relief efforts, the
Stanford community and the city of Palo Alto are doing
their part to help those in need.
For immediate relief, Stanford's Pilipino American

Student Union (PASU) —which Baniqued co-chairs
is directing the Stanford community to donate to
the nonprofit National Alliance for Filipino Concerns
(NAFCON).
Last week PASU held a three-day tabling event in
White Plaza where they encouraged students to make
online monetary donations to NAFCON.
At first PASU members collected cash donations,
but upon realizing University policy that prohibits
cash solicitations in White Plaza they subsequently re
sorted to sharing information on how to make online
donations.

The Pilipino American Student Union tabled at White Plaza last week to collect online donations for the
National Alliance for Filipino Concerns (NAFCON) to support typhoon relief in the Philippines.
PASU co-chair Jomar
Sevilla 'l4 said that while the
group ultimately did manage
to get several students to do
nate online and continues to
encourage students to digital
ly contribute to NAFCON, it
was disappointing to have to
turn away any cash donations
after the first day of tabling.
"It was an obstacle and I
think it kind of prevented us
from really reaching as much
funding as we could for White
Plaza," Sevilla said.
Beyond fundraising ef
forts, various groups and indi
viduals eager to help spread
the word of how to lend a
hand overseas have also ap
proached PASU.
The National Association
for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP)
reached out to PASU to host a
community gathering this
past Monday consisting of an
information session on Ty
phoon Haiyan's impact, a re
flection of the tragedy and a
vigil for those affected.
Baniqued explained that
the NAACP provided the
space and logistical equip
ment and also helped with the
setup and takedown of the
event.
"We don't do too many
events with [the NAACP] and
them reaching out to us just
kind of showed us that this
tragedy that happened in the
Philippines was indeed some
thing that united all the com

iqued said.
