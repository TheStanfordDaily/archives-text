## Typhoon relief efforts continue 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
Geraldine "Dindin" Baniqued 'l4 was shocked
when she heard that Typhoon Haiyan struck the
Philippines, her home country, on Nov. 8.
The International Relief and Development non
profit humanitarian group estimates over 10,000 dead
and around 10 million affected by what is being called
one of the most powerful storms in history.
Amid international and national relief efforts, the
Stanford community and the city of Palo Alto are doing
their part to help those in need.
For immediate relief, Stanford's Pilipino American

Student Union (PASU) â€”which Baniqued co-chairs
is directing the Stanford community to donate to
the nonprofit National Alliance for Filipino Concerns
(NAFCON).
Last week PASU held a three-day tabling event in
White Plaza where they encouraged students to make
online monetary donations to NAFCON.
At first PASU members collected cash donations,
but upon realizing University policy that prohibits
cash solicitations in White Plaza they subsequently re
sorted to sharing information on how to make online
donations.
