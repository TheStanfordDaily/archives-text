# Undeclared junior number declines
## UAR hold encourages freshmen, sophomores to declare major early 
### SARAH MOORE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The number of undeclared juniors
at the start of the academic school
year has steadily decreased over the
last five years.
In September 2009, 545 juniors
remained undeclared. In 2010, this
number decreased to 471, and in
2011, 2012 and 2013, there were 474,
390 and 368 undeclared juniors, re
spectively.
Kirsti Copeland, associate dean of
residentially based advising and pre
major advising, said the decline was
due in part to the Undergraduate
Advising and Research (UAR) advi
sor hold (ADV2O) that prevents
freshmen and sophomores from sign
ing up for their next quarter classes
before meeting with their pre-major
advisors.
In an email to The Daily,
Copeland stated that the advisor hold
was established with the intention of
driving down the number of unde
clared students. The hold led to de
creasing numbers because students
would see their pre-major advisors
and have a designated time in which
to think through their academic deci
sions such as a declaring.

According to UAR Academic Di
rector Dayo Mitchell, some students
enter junior year undeclared though
they know what they want to study;
yet, they are unsure how to navigate
the declaring process, have not yet
fulfilled the course prerequisites for
their major or have not found their
major advisor.
Dina Hassan 'l5 declared in histo
ry two weeks ago after her own
struggle to declare.
"It was really hard for me to de
cide because I really wanted to ex
plore," Hassan said. "When it came
to spring sophomore year, I met with
my academic director. I knew I want
ed to declare history, but I didn't
know who to pick for my advisor."
Hassan said that another quarter
helped her get to know faculty in the
department better and be confident
in her choice. Hassan added that her
declaring was later than some of her
peers because she had been strongly
considering both history and comput
er science before making a final deci
sion.
"It takes a while to know what CS
actually is, so I took those classes to
find out if it was for me or not," Has-
san said. "I wanted to be re
ally sure I picked the best fit
for me, and I am."
Aside from ADV2O, the
UAR also places a hold on
student records and the abil
ity to enroll in classes for jun
iors that are still undeclared.
UAR Associate Dean
Randall Williams stressed
that this relatively new poli
cy instated five years ago
is not intended to force
students into declaring if
they really are unsure about
what they want to study. In
stead, the policy aims to
prompt those who have de
cided on their majors but
have not gone through the
formal declaring process yet
and to help those who are
still uncertain about their
majors.
"All we want is contact
from the [undecided] student
to give us an update on where
they are in them process. All
we want to know is that
they're thinking about it and
working on it," Williams said.
"And we're happy to move a
hold to give them the time to
engage with the department
and figure things out."
Some undeclared students,
however, harbor frustration
towards this hold policy.
Breanna Hampton 'l5 de
cided in spring quarter that
she would declare in psychol
ogy, but has been having
trouble finding an advisor
and therefore has not been
able to declare.
"It's making me really
stressed out because I have
to get classes for next quar
ter," Hampton said. "It's not
cutthroat to take classes like
in other schools but at the
same time it's a hassle to
email teachers to ask them to
put you on them waiting list,
especially when it's so late in
the game."
Hampton cited that the
academic directors she
talked to were helpful to
some extent, sitting down
with her to discuss a plan that
would allow her to graduate
on time, but she is worried
about not being able to take
the classes she needs because
of the hold.
"I understand [the policy],

I really do, but it's really
frustrating," Hampton said.
"It's aggravating. I don't care
if you hold my grades. I don't
care if you hold anything else.
I need to get classes. I under
stand they want to get you to
declare; I'll do all the talking
and paperwork, but I just re
ally want to make sure I'm in
the class I want to be in."
Williams stressed that
choosing a major is typically
an extended process that be
gins with one's interests com
ing into Stanford and match
ing each freshman with a pre
major advisor. Sophomore
year is an appropriate time for
Majors Night, an annual event
designed to help students ex
plore over 45 departments.
"It's really about informa
tion gathering, referrals, ex
periences and taking cours
es," Williams said. "You can
figure it out by talking with
peers and talking with de
partments to help you narrow
it down."
For those students still

deciding between multiple
majors, Mitchell recom
mends talking to faculty and
peer advisors, researching
what majors are wanted by
careers of interest and outlin
ing potential four-year plans,
all to get a better sense of
what completing a major
would look like.
"One of the things I en
courage is to not wait for a
light bulb but to go out and
gather information about the
major," Mitchell said. "If you
get all this information and it
doesn't put you off then I
think you can safely decide
you're ready, as opposed to
just expecting that enlight
enment will come."
As of Monday earlier this
week, 178 juniors remain un
declared.

In an email to The Daily,
Copeland stated that the advisor hold
was established with the intention of
driving down the number of unde
clared students. The hold led to de
creasing numbers because students
would see their pre-major advisors
and have a designated time in which
to think through their academic deci
sions such as a declaring.

According to UAR Academic Di
rector Dayo Mitchell, some students
enter junior year undeclared though
they know what they want to study;
yet, they are unsure how to navigate
the declaring process, have not yet
fulfilled the course prerequisites for
their major or have not found their
major advisor.
Dina Hassan 'l5 declared in histo
ry two weeks ago after her own
struggle to declare.
"It was really hard for me to de
cide because I really wanted to ex
plore," Hassan said. "When it came
to spring sophomore year, I met with
my academic director. I knew I want
ed to declare history, but I didn't
know who to pick for my advisor."
Hassan said that another quarter
helped her get to know faculty in the
department better and be confident
in her choice. Hassan added that her
declaring was later than some of her
peers because she had been strongly
considering both history and comput
er science before making a final deci
sion.
"It takes a while to know what CS
actually is, so I took those classes to
find out if it was for me or not," Has-
san said. "I wanted to be re
ally sure I picked the best fit
for me, and I am."
Aside from ADV2O, the
UAR also places a hold on
student records and the abil
ity to enroll in classes for jun
iors that are still undeclared.
UAR Associate Dean
Randall Williams stressed
that this relatively new poli
cy instated five years ago
is not intended to force
students into declaring if
they really are unsure about
what they want to study. In
stead, the policy aims to
prompt those who have de
cided on their majors but
have not gone through the
formal declaring process yet
and to help those who are
still uncertain about their
majors.
"All we want is contact
from the [undecided] student
to give us an update on where
they are in them process. All
we want to know is that
they're thinking about it and
working on it," Williams said.
"And we're happy to move a
hold to give them the time to
engage with the department
and figure things out."
Some undeclared students,
however, harbor frustration
towards this hold policy.
Breanna Hampton 'l5 de
cided in spring quarter that
she would declare in psychol
ogy, but has been having
trouble finding an advisor
and therefore has not been
able to declare.
"It's making me really
stressed out because I have
to get classes for next quar
ter," Hampton said. "It's not
cutthroat to take classes like
in other schools but at the
same time it's a hassle to
email teachers to ask them to
put you on them waiting list,
especially when it's so late in
the game."
Hampton cited that the
academic directors she
talked to were helpful to
some extent, sitting down
with her to discuss a plan that
would allow her to graduate
on time, but she is worried
about not being able to take
the classes she needs because
of the hold.
"I understand [the policy],

I really do, but it's really
frustrating," Hampton said.
"It's aggravating. I don't care
if you hold my grades. I don't
care if you hold anything else.
I need to get classes. I under
stand they want to get you to
declare; I'll do all the talking
and paperwork, but I just re
ally want to make sure I'm in
the class I want to be in."
Williams stressed that
choosing a major is typically
an extended process that be
gins with one's interests com
ing into Stanford and match
ing each freshman with a pre
major advisor. Sophomore
year is an appropriate time for
Majors Night, an annual event
designed to help students ex
plore over 45 departments.
"It's really about informa
tion gathering, referrals, ex
periences and taking cours
es," Williams said. "You can
figure it out by talking with
peers and talking with de
partments to help you narrow
it down."
For those students still

deciding between multiple
majors, Mitchell recom
mends talking to faculty and
peer advisors, researching
what majors are wanted by
careers of interest and outlin
ing potential four-year plans,
all to get a better sense of
what completing a major
would look like.
"One of the things I en
courage is to not wait for a
light bulb but to go out and
gather information about the
major," Mitchell said. "If you
get all this information and it
doesn't put you off then I
think you can safely decide
you're ready, as opposed to
just expecting that enlight
enment will come."
As of Monday earlier this
week, 178 juniors remain un
declared.

The number of undeclared juniors
at the start of the academic school
year has steadily decreased over the
last five years.
In September 2009, 545 juniors
remained undeclared. In 2010, this
number decreased to 471, and in
2011, 2012 and 2013, there were 474,
390 and 368 undeclared juniors, re

Kirsti Copeland, associate dean of
residentially based advising and pre
