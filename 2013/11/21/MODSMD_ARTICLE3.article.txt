# Undeclared junior number declines
## UAR hold encourages freshmen, sophomores to declare major early 
### SARAH MOORE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The number of undeclared juniors
at the start of the academic school
year has steadily decreased over the
last five years.
In September 2009, 545 juniors
remained undeclared. In 2010, this
number decreased to 471, and in
2011, 2012 and 2013, there were 474,
390 and 368 undeclared juniors, re
spectively.
Kirsti Copeland, associate dean of
residentially based advising and pre
major advising, said the decline was
due in part to the Undergraduate
Advising and Research (UAR) advi
sor hold (ADV2O) that prevents
freshmen and sophomores from sign
ing up for their next quarter classes
before meeting with their pre-major
advisors.
In an email to The Daily,
Copeland stated that the advisor hold
was established with the intention of
driving down the number of unde
clared students. The hold led to de
creasing numbers because students
would see their pre-major advisors
and have a designated time in which
to think through their academic deci
sions such as a declaring.

According to UAR Academic Di
rector Dayo Mitchell, some students
enter junior year undeclared though
they know what they want to study;
yet, they are unsure how to navigate
the declaring process, have not yet
fulfilled the course prerequisites for
their major or have not found their
major advisor.
Dina Hassan 'l5 declared in histo

struggle to declare.
"It was really hard for me to de
cide because I really wanted to ex
plore," Hassan said. "When it came
to spring sophomore year, I met with
my academic director. I knew I want
ed to declare history, but I didn't
know who to pick for my advisor."
Hassan said that another quarter
helped her get to know faculty in the
department better and be confident
in her choice. Hassan added that her
declaring was later than some of her
peers because she had been strongly
considering both history and comput
er science before making a final deci
sion.
"It takes a while to know what CS
actually is, so I took those classes to
find out if it was for me or not," Has-
