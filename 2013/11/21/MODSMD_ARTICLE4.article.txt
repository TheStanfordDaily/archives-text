## IUC plans events, trips over break 
### SAM KURLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the first time, the Stanford
International Undergraduate
Community (lUC) will offer special
excursions for students staying on
campus over Thanksgiving Recess.
Planned outings, which are open
to both international and American
students, include a trip to Six Flags
Discovery Kingdom on Monday,
Nov. 25 and a Thanksgiving dinner
at Thaiphoon, a Thai restaurant on
University Avenue, on Wednesday,
Nov. 27. Both events have garnered
broad interest.
Sebastian Wigstrom 'l5, presi
dent of the lUC, said he hopes that
offering these events will allow the
organization to carry a larger pres
ence on campus.
"We're really trying to ramp it
up, and to make a statement that
the International Undergraduate
Community is really going to be
there for people and create these
cool events that students can go
to," Wigstrom said.
Jichan Park 'l5, chief marketing
director of the lUC, said that the
Bechtel International Center has
tried to host excursions over
Thanksgiving break in the past, but
has not had high turnout. The lUC
hopes to be more successful.
"The lUC leverages its relation
ship with Stanford students and
can reach a wider audience," Park
said. "I think that's why we got
more interest."
Wigstrom said Thanksgiving is
an especially important time to
reach out to the international stu
dent community.
"We were determined to do
something during Thanksgiving
because we know that students
who stay [on campus] are kind of
bored and don't have a lot of stuff
to do," Wigstrom said. "We're not
with our families or anything, so it
seemed like a good idea."
The lUC's upcoming events are
