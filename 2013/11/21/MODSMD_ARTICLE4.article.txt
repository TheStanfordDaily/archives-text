## IUC plans events, trips over break 
### SAM KURLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the first time, the Stanford
International Undergraduate
Community (lUC) will offer special
excursions for students staying on
campus over Thanksgiving Recess.
Planned outings, which are open
to both international and American
students, include a trip to Six Flags
Discovery Kingdom on Monday,
Nov. 25 and a Thanksgiving dinner
at Thaiphoon, a Thai restaurant on
University Avenue, on Wednesday,
Nov. 27. Both events have garnered
broad interest.
Sebastian Wigstrom 'l5, presi
dent of the lUC, said he hopes that
offering these events will allow the
organization to carry a larger pres
ence on campus.
"We're really trying to ramp it
up, and to make a statement that
the International Undergraduate
Community is really going to be
there for people and create these
cool events that students can go
to," Wigstrom said.
Jichan Park 'l5, chief marketing
director of the lUC, said that the
Bechtel International Center has
tried to host excursions over
Thanksgiving break in the past, but
has not had high turnout. The lUC
hopes to be more successful.
"The lUC leverages its relation
ship with Stanford students and
can reach a wider audience," Park
said. "I think that's why we got
more interest."
Wigstrom said Thanksgiving is
an especially important time to
reach out to the international stu
dent community.
"We were determined to do
something during Thanksgiving
because we know that students
who stay [on campus] are kind of
bored and don't have a lot of stuff
to do," Wigstrom said. "We're not
with our families or anything, so it
seemed like a good idea."
The lUC's upcoming events are
open to both international
and American students be
cause the organization want
ed its Thanksgiving offer
ings to be as inclusive as
possible and to bridge the
gap between the groups,
Wigstrom explained.
The trip to Six Flags is
subsidized by the Bechtel
International Center and
the Associated Students of
Stanford University (AS
SU). Participating stu
dents will pay $l5 for
transportation and admis
sion. Without the subsidy,
general admission alone
without transportation
would have cost $62.
As of Wednesday after
noon, 48 out of a total of 55
available seats had been
claimed.
Many students have also
signed up for Thanksgiving
Dinner at Thaiphoon. Park
explained the organiza
tion's choice of restaurant.
"[Thaiphoon] was our
personal favorite, among

the board members," Park
said with a laugh. "It's
good to get off campus, and
I think Thanksgiving
should be a little more fan
cy ... [Thaiphoon] has a
nice ambience, and we're
always aiming for interna
tional food."
As of Wednesday after
noon, 55 students had
signed up for 30 available
seats for the dinner.
"I'm actually a bit sur
prised that that many peo
ple signed up," Wigstrom
said. Students who signed
up since the event filled to
capacity will be placed on a
waiting list.
Support from the Rid
dle Family Fund through
the Bechtel International
Center will allow the lUC
to cover the cost of the
Thaiphoon dinner, which is
free to students.
The Riddle Family Fund
is intended to promote in
teraction between Ameri
can and international stu
dents, and so Wigstrom
was particularly eager to
encourage American stu
dents to attend the dinner.
"I think one of the main
problems we have is that
Americans see that there's
an email from the Interna
tional Undergraduate
Community for an event,
and they immediately dis
regard it because they as
sume it's just for interna
tionals, but we're really
trying to reach out every
body," Wigstrom said.
"We are not trying to be
exclusive in any way, shape
or form, and all of our
events are going to be open
to Americans," he added.
The lUC decided to or
ganize the Six Flags outing
based on the results of a
survey of student interest.
Other destinations that
were popular among sur
vey respondents included
California's Great America
amusement park, Napa
and Sonoma Valleys, San
Francisco and Yosemite
National Park. Yosemite
was nearly as popular as
Six Flags among survey
respondents, but Wigstrom
explained that organizing
the trip would have been a
challenge.

For the first time, the Stanford
International Undergraduate
Community (lUC) will offer special
excursions for students staying on
campus over Thanksgiving Recess.
Planned outings, which are open
to both international and American
students, include a trip to Six Flags
Discovery Kingdom on Monday,
Nov. 25 and a Thanksgiving dinner
at Thaiphoon, a Thai restaurant on
University Avenue, on Wednesday,
Nov. 27. Both events have garnered
broad interest.
Sebastian Wigstrom 'l5, presi
dent of the lUC, said he hopes that
offering these events will allow the
organization to carry a larger pres
ence on campus.
"We're really trying to ramp it
up, and to make a statement that
the International Undergraduate
Community is really going to be
there for people and create these
cool events that students can go
to," Wigstrom said.
Jichan Park 'l5, chief marketing
director of the lUC, said that the
Bechtel International Center has
tried to host excursions over
Thanksgiving break in the past, but
has not had high turnout. The lUC
hopes to be more successful.
"The lUC leverages its relation
ship with Stanford students and
can reach a wider audience," Park
said. "I think that's why we got
more interest."
Wigstrom said Thanksgiving is
an especially important time to
reach out to the international stu
dent community.
"We were determined to do
something during Thanksgiving
because we know that students
who stay [on campus] are kind of
bored and don't have a lot of stuff
to do," Wigstrom said. "We're not
with our families or anything, so it
seemed like a good idea."
The lUC's upcoming events are
open to both international
and American students be
cause the organization want
ed its Thanksgiving offer
ings to be as inclusive as
possible and to bridge the
gap between the groups,
Wigstrom explained.
The trip to Six Flags is
subsidized by the Bechtel
International Center and
the Associated Students of
Stanford University (AS
SU). Participating stu
dents will pay $l5 for
transportation and admis
sion. Without the subsidy,
general admission alone
without transportation
would have cost $62.
As of Wednesday after
noon, 48 out of a total of 55
available seats had been
claimed.
Many students have also
signed up for Thanksgiving
Dinner at Thaiphoon. Park
explained the organiza
tion's choice of restaurant.
"[Thaiphoon] was our
personal favorite, among

the board members," Park
said with a laugh. "It's
good to get off campus, and
I think Thanksgiving
should be a little more fan
cy ... [Thaiphoon] has a
nice ambience, and we're
always aiming for interna
tional food."
As of Wednesday after
noon, 55 students had
signed up for 30 available
seats for the dinner.
"I'm actually a bit sur
prised that that many peo
ple signed up," Wigstrom
said. Students who signed
up since the event filled to
capacity will be placed on a
waiting list.
Support from the Rid
dle Family Fund through
the Bechtel International
Center will allow the lUC
to cover the cost of the
Thaiphoon dinner, which is
free to students.
The Riddle Family Fund
is intended to promote in
teraction between Ameri
can and international stu
dents, and so Wigstrom
was particularly eager to
encourage American stu
dents to attend the dinner.
"I think one of the main
problems we have is that
Americans see that there's
an email from the Interna
tional Undergraduate
Community for an event,
and they immediately dis
regard it because they as
sume it's just for interna
tionals, but we're really
trying to reach out every
body," Wigstrom said.
"We are not trying to be
exclusive in any way, shape
or form, and all of our
events are going to be open
to Americans," he added.
The lUC decided to or
ganize the Six Flags outing
based on the results of a
survey of student interest.
Other destinations that
were popular among sur
vey respondents included
California's Great America
amusement park, Napa
and Sonoma Valleys, San
Francisco and Yosemite
National Park. Yosemite
was nearly as popular as
Six Flags among survey
respondents, but Wigstrom
explained that organizing
the trip would have been a
challenge.
