# Q&A
## ANN ARVIN VICE PROVOST AND DEAN OF RESEARCH 
### SAM KURLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ann Ai'vin, vice provost and dean of re
search, addressed the problem of re
search integrity in last month's faculty
senate meeting following a report titled
"How Science Goes Wrong" published in
The Economist.
The Daily sat down with Arvin to talk
about her opinion on the research integri
ty at Stanford.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):What are the
leading problems associated with re

search integrity here at Stanford?
Ann Arvin (AA):Well, everybody wants
to protect the integrity of research, be
cause it is the public record of research.
50... I don't think we have any leading
problems. It's just, what are our goals?
And how do we accomplish them? We
don't have a particular set of problems at
Stanford. This is just the general effort of
anyone who is engaged in research and
scholarship to make sure to the extent
possible that the work is not biased,
and is done according to the standards of

the disciplines.
TSD:The Economist recent
ly published an article enti
tled "How Science Goes
Wrong." In that article, the
authors suggested that the
pressure to publish cutting
edge research is undermin
ing the integrity of academic
research in general world
wide. What are your
thoughts about it?
AA:In my view, The Econo
mist stated what should be a
hypothesis as a conclusion.
But that is certainly one of
the challenges, that re
searchers are expected to
have major new findings in
order to get published and to
get grant funding. That
might cause someone not to
pay attention to the full data
set, or not to use their best
judgment. Doing science is
always about judgment. But
there is no evidence indicat
ing that research misconduct
has increased. Still, you
could say that we have con
cerns that these pressures
are real, and perhaps there
are ways we can mitigate
those pressures, which might
lead to problems with re
search integrity.
TSD:Is research misconduct
a problem at Stanford today,
in your opinion?
AA:Maintaining research in
tegrity is always an issue. We
do not have a particular
problem with research mis
conduct. We are, as we hope,
vigilant, and by that I mean
people who are engaged in
research need to be ques
tioning each other: "Are you

sure that result is right?"
That's not a confrontation of
your colleague it's trying
to promote the best quality
research. So we want to
maintain that idea of careful
scrutiny within lab groups
and across lab groups to ask
questions of colleagues.
And we also want to make
sure that when somebody re
ally feels that there is some
thing inappropriate going on,
that they will in fact have a
way to come forward, and
that there aren't barriers to
doing that. So our policy ex
plains that people should go
to their school deans, but if
they're not comfortable with
doing that which you can
easily imagine someone
would not be then there
are the approaches through
the ombudsperson and ways
to come forward confidential
ly. But it's also really impor
tant to understand that mak
ing an allegation of research
misconduct â€”as you can
read about in the research
policy handbook is a very
serious allegation, and it has
to do with alleging that you
have observed fabrication,
falsification or plagiarism.
TSD:What are the conse
quences for those found to
have engaged in research
misconduct at Stanford?
AA:Well, there have been
vanishingly few. And so, the
fact is the consequences de
pend on the circumstance. In
the faculty handbook, there
is a section on faculty disci
pline. And so, it is more a
process. It is not, "If you do
such and such, we will do
such and such." It is a
process of evaluation and de
cision about these particular
circumstances and what's ap
propriate. We do not have a
sort of criminal proceeding

where "this is a misde
meanor or this is a felony" or
whatever. That's not how it
works.
TSD:What recommenda
tions do you have for the
University to promote re
search integrity going for
ward?
AA:What we're doing is what
we need to be doing, which is
maintaining making sure
people are aware, not only of
the definition, but also how to
proceed if there are con
cerns. I think we would like
our faculty to be engaged in
their own disciplines. There
are usually associations or
societies that are doing [na
tional work] like the
American Physical Society,
for example. Most of those
organizations have some ac
tivities that are talking about
how to really define the stan
dards of best practices with
in their fields. You can easily
imagine they're not exactly
parallel. It depends on what
your tools are and what your
discipline is. So we would like
faculty to participate in those
discussions.
TSD:What role can students
play in ensuring that aca
demic integrity is preserved
here at Stanford?
AAfWell, I think they need to
be as aware as other people
about what the definition is
and what the process is if
they have a concern. It's a
community effort to make
sure that the conversations
happen. And it's important to
have students engaged in
that too. Students are active
ly involved in research here.
It's part of what I hope they
will be learning.
