## Gaietiesburg: A Campus Divided debuts 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 102 nd production of Gai
eties Gaietiesberg: A Campus
Divided made its debut last
night and will continue to run
tonight and tomorrow.

On the night of their very first
dress rehearsal in Memorial Audi
torium, a space they had only
started tailoring the performance
to four days before, the Gaieties
cast and crew put on a seemingly
effortless production: the choreog
raphy was fluid, the songs were

well-rehearsed, the facial expres
sions and body language were
charming and engaging, and the
support and collaboration between
cast members was essential to the
comedy on stage and the audi
ence's connection with each of the
characters.

While the actors got ready
while the actors got ready for, in
my humble opinion, the very best
Gaieties show yet, attendees could
already get a sense of the kind of
show they would be seeing based

highlighted the debate between "techies" and "fuzzies" on campus and will continue to run through Friday.

Miley's Cyrus's "We
Can't Stop" was the first to
play and was closely fol
lowed by one of Pitbull's
newer songs "Timber" (ft.
Kesha). Although there was

tains rose and I was intro
duced to a slightly different
Harry Elam (Annabah
Glasser 'l5), Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education.
This Elam impostor
thrust audience members in
to the show. More specifically,
she wielded a black rod with
a crystal figure at its point
and her opening dance in
cluded thrusting her hips to
the rhythm of a song,
dressed in a chic black suit
and sparkly black hat.
One of the best parts of
this Gaieties performance is
how much of its bold and wit
ty scenes can only be under
stood by Stanford students.
For example, at the begin
ning of the musical, Elam
takes on the role of a pre-ma
jor advisor counseling a
freshman who is completely
lost in the major declaration
process as so many of us
are or once were. She is
screaming her worries and
problems at Elam, and in re
turn, he pours her some wine
and tries and fails to make
cool young college student
conversation.
It only gets more eccen
tric and hilarious from there.
Suddenly, we have Raven
Symone (Megan Gage 'l6),
the former Cheetah Girl and
psychic from "That's So
Raven," strut onto the stage
with ex-Notre Dame football
player and henchman Manti
Te'o (Dan Ashton 'l4), a guy
named Oski (Luke deWilde
'l6) in an awfully tacky Cal
bear costume and a lunatic
drug addict named Bubbles
(Katherine Bick 'l6) who has
an obsession for saving the
planet, one blunt handle of
hard liquor at a time.
This band of "intimidat
ing" villains has one goal and
one goal only: destroy Stan
ford so that Raven can be

come ruler in revenge for her
admission being rescinded
during Admit Weekend.
Without giving too much
away, Raven's strategy is
simple: initiate a war between
the techies and the fuzzies
that will bring such chaos to
the student body that all will
bow down to her. Raven or
ganizes a kidnapping of two
of the most revered profes
sors at Stanford, one who is a
prolific author and the other
who is well loved in the com
puter science world. I'll leave
it to you to guess who these
professors could be.
Although Gaieties is
known for being outrageous
and at times crude, there is a
deeper meaning underneath
all of the rally gear and hu
mor. Gaietiesburg: A Campus
Divided does a good job of ad
dressing one of the questions
that Stanford and many other
students are facing —what is
the value of the humanities in
a culture dominated by sci
ence and technology?
When the war between the
techies and the fuzzies does fi
nally ends, we see the two
parties come together, agree
ing on the importance of col
laboration. This shows that
Stanford can and does place
importance on a liberal arts
and interdisciplinary educa
tion.
With Gaieties, there is
much more than meets the
eye.
"For some reason Gai
eties has this reputation. For
some reason, everyone I talk
to asks if the actors are going
to be super trashed. No, no;
this is very serious," said No
ra Tjossem 'l5, producer of
the show, in response to how
much work she has put into
this production.
One of the quintessential
aspects of Gaieties is the
community that forms over
time, Assistant Stage Man
ager and Costume Designer
Carly Lave 'l5 said.
"I think people are just
willing to take a leap of faith
and not fear judgment," Lave
said. "The other cast mem
bers will be really receptive
and say, 'Yeah that worked,'
or, 'No that flat out was not
funny, don't do it.' No one is
offended by it, and it's just
honest and helpful."

"For some reason Gai

some reason, everyone I talk
to asks if the actors are going
to be super trashed. No, no;
this is very serious," said No
ra Tjossem 'l5, producer of
the show, in response to how
much work she has put into
this production.
One of the quintessential
aspects of Gaieties is the
community that forms over

Carly Lave 'l5 said.
"I think people are just
willing to take a leap of faith
and not fear judgment," Lave
said. "The other cast mem
bers will be really receptive
and say, 'Yeah that worked,'
or, 'No that flat out was not
funny, don't do it.' No one is
offended by it, and it's just
honest and helpful."

The 102 nd production of Gai
eties Gaietiesberg: A Campus
Divided made its debut last
night and will continue to run
tonight and tomorrow.

On the night of their very first
dress rehearsal in Memorial Audi
torium, a space they had only
started tailoring the performance
to four days before, the Gaieties
cast and crew put on a seemingly
effortless production: the choreog
raphy was fluid, the songs were

well-rehearsed, the facial expres
sions and body language were
charming and engaging, and the
support and collaboration between
cast members was essential to the
comedy on stage and the audi
ence's connection with each of the
characters.

While the actors got ready
while the actors got ready for, in
my humble opinion, the very best
Gaieties show yet, attendees could
already get a sense of the kind of
show they would be seeing based

The 102 nd production of Gaieties, Gaietiesburg: A Campus Divided, made its debut in Memorial Auditorium on Wednesday night. The production
highlighted the debate between "techies" and "fuzzies" on campus and will continue to run through Friday.

Miley's Cyrus's "We
Can't Stop" was the first to
play and was closely fol

newer songs "Timber" (ft.
Kesha). Although there was

tains rose and I was intro
duced to a slightly different
Harry Elam (Annabah
Glasser 'l5), Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education.
This Elam impostor
thrust audience members in
to the show. More specifically,
she wielded a black rod with
a crystal figure at its point
and her opening dance in
cluded thrusting her hips to
the rhythm of a song,
dressed in a chic black suit
and sparkly black hat.
One of the best parts of
this Gaieties performance is
how much of its bold and wit
ty scenes can only be under
stood by Stanford students.
For example, at the begin
ning of the musical, Elam
takes on the role of a pre-ma
jor advisor counseling a
freshman who is completely
lost in the major declaration
process as so many of us
are or once were. She is
screaming her worries and
problems at Elam, and in re
turn, he pours her some wine
and tries and fails to make
cool young college student
conversation.
It only gets more eccen
tric and hilarious from there.
Suddenly, we have Raven
Symone (Megan Gage 'l6),
the former Cheetah Girl and
psychic from "That's So
Raven," strut onto the stage
with ex-Notre Dame football
player and henchman Manti
Te'o (Dan Ashton 'l4), a guy
named Oski (Luke deWilde
'l6) in an awfully tacky Cal
bear costume and a lunatic
drug addict named Bubbles
(Katherine Bick 'l6) who has
an obsession for saving the
planet, one blunt handle of
hard liquor at a time.
This band of "intimidat
ing" villains has one goal and
one goal only: destroy Stan
ford so that Raven can be

come ruler in revenge for her
admission being rescinded
during Admit Weekend.
Without giving too much
away, Raven's strategy is
simple: initiate a war between
the techies and the fuzzies
that will bring such chaos to
the student body that all will
bow down to her. Raven or
ganizes a kidnapping of two
of the most revered profes
sors at Stanford, one who is a
prolific author and the other
who is well loved in the com
puter science world. I'll leave
it to you to guess who these
professors could be.
Although Gaieties is
known for being outrageous
and at times crude, there is a
deeper meaning underneath
all of the rally gear and hu
mor. Gaietiesburg: A Campus
Divided does a good job of ad
dressing one of the questions
that Stanford and many other
students are facing —what is
the value of the humanities in
a culture dominated by sci
ence and technology?
When the war between the
techies and the fuzzies does fi
nally ends, we see the two
parties come together, agree
ing on the importance of col
laboration. This shows that
Stanford can and does place
importance on a liberal arts
