## Gaietiesburg: A Campus Divided debuts 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 102 nd production of Gai
eties Gaietiesberg: A Campus
Divided made its debut last
night and will continue to run
tonight and tomorrow.

On the night of their very first
dress rehearsal in Memorial Audi
torium, a space they had only
started tailoring the performance
to four days before, the Gaieties
cast and crew put on a seemingly
effortless production: the choreog
raphy was fluid, the songs were

well-rehearsed, the facial expres
sions and body language were
charming and engaging, and the
support and collaboration between
cast members was essential to the
comedy on stage and the audi
ence's connection with each of the
characters.

While the actors got ready
while the actors got ready for, in
my humble opinion, the very best
Gaieties show yet, attendees could
already get a sense of the kind of
show they would be seeing based
