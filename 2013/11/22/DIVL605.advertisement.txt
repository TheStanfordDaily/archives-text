Fire and Ice: Robert Frost's Dark Woods

Monday, December 2

Cubberley Auditorium

Stanford University
Free and open to the public
f This year is the 50th anniversary of Robert Frost's death, and
the passing years have not displaced him from his standing as
one of America's favorite poets. His poems invest commonplace
realities with eerie significance, give voice to bittersweet ironies
in crisp vernacular language, and cultivate a sense of wonder
(and often elegiac loss) in a mythic New England landscape.
Frost's poems are often little dramas, quirky soliloquies and
darkly comic monologues, plain spoken, deceptively simple
yet complex and ambiguous—perfect for the stage.
In Fire and Ice, Frost's poems will be performed as dramatic
readings in a unique production assembled and produced
by Hilton Obenzinger and directed and performed by
Kay Kostopoulos with acclaimed actor James Carpenter.
The performance will be followed by a discussion with Professor
of English Emeritus Albert Gelpi on Frost's reputation and
the understanding of his work in the 21st century.
