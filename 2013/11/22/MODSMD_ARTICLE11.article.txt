# Improbable path to a BCS bowl
## 
### WHAT TO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
I'm sorry, but I can't in good faith
give an in-depth breakdown of Big
Game. I just don't believe that Cal
can beat Stanford, and more im
portantly, I don't think there are
any interesting matchups to go
through.

Barring an upset of literally epic
proportions, Stanford will beat the
Bears, likely by three touchdowns or
more. I'm not saying an upset can't
happen, but I can't possibly predict
how that upset would take place.
For those reasons, I'm going to go
off the regular path of this column to
go through this weekend's football
games taking place outside of Stanford
Stadium that could have significant im
pacts on the Cardinal's bowl destina
tion.

The big game of the weekend in
college football is one of those that
could impact Stanford: the Big-12
matchup between No. 10 Oklahoma
State and No. 4 Baylor. The Baylor
Bears are likely to play in a BCS bowl
no matter what happens on Saturday,
but Oklahoma State is on the bubble.
Teams need to be ranked in the top 14
of the BCS to be eligible for at-large se
lections to a BCS game, so a blowout
loss to Baylor could potentially move
the Cowboys out of contentioa If
Oklahoma State can play Baylor close
or upset the Bears, both of those teams
could end up in BCS bowls, sending
Stanford to the Alamo Bowl or worse.

If the Big-12 doesn't send two
teams, Stanford could still be undone
by the No. 2 team out of the Big Ten.
