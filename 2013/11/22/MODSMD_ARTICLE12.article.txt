# BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DAILY CALIFORNIAN

### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's Big Game be
tween Stanford and Cat, The Daily's Win
ston Shi chatted with Connor Byrne, a
columnist for The Daily Californian, to get
perspective from both camps. Below is a
partial transcript of their conversation. For
the full conversation, go to www.stanford
daUy.com/category/sports.

Winston Shi (WS): Obviously Cal's record
has been disappointing, but has Cal improved
over the course of the season?

Connor Byrne (CB): There hasn't been any
tangible improvement. The offense still hasn't
found away to consistently score in the red
zone, the offensive line has continued to strug
gle providing any sort of pocket and the de
fense hasn't been able to stop anybody. A lot of
that can be attributed to just an absurd amount
of injuries. At one point in the season wide re
ceivers Bryce Treggs and Chris Harper started
working out with the defensive backs, as there
were almost a few situations where there were
just no other available cornerbacks to play.
However, there have been a handful of players
who have played the whole year without get
ting hurt, and they haven't shown any real im
provement. Cal's most impressive game contin
ues to be its opener against Northwestern,
which is looking less and less impressive given
that the Wildcats have imploded in recent
weeks.

WS: Cal played probably the hardest schedule
in the country to open the season: Northwest
ern, Ohio State and Oregon. I guess you could
say that the nail-biter against an FCS team was
a harbinger of bad things to come, but if Cal
had played a less brutal schedule do you think
the team would be playing better now?

CB: It's definitely possible, but given how it
struggled against Portland State, I'm not sure
that an easier schedule would have made much
difference in terms of how the team would be
playing right now. More so than anything else,
injuries have been the No. 1 reason for the
Bears' struggles. At this point they currently
have two of the 11 projected defensive starters
back in spring playing. They could have played
one of the easiest schedules in the country and

defense. Gaffney rushed for 158 yards and two touchdowns in Stanford's loss at USC last week.
continued to struggle given how
many players they've had miss signif
icant time on both sides of the ball.

WS: So is there hope? The story
goes that Stanford only started im
proving after Tedford built a winner
in Strawberry Canyon it lit a fire
under the Stanford fan base. This
season may be difficult, but do you
at least believe that Stanford's resur
gence has ignited the Cal fan base?
Even if this season is lost, what hope
do you see coming?

CB: I think Stanford's success prob
ably irks much of the Cal fan base,
but I wouldn't go as far to say it has
"ignited" it. The Cal fan base started
to get pretty upset with the direction
of the football team in late 2007, and
has continued to demand a return to
relevancy. As far as the future, I think
most people are taking a wait-and
see approach with the Sonny Dykes
regime.

WS: Can Cal win? If so, how would
it happen?

CB: If the Bears can find away to
stop the run consistently while es
tablishing their own running game,
they could have a chance. But they
haven't shown any ability on de
fense to stop anybody, and I don't
see that changing this weekend.
They just don't have the personnel
healthy right now. Their ground
game has shown a little more im
provement in the past few weeks,
but that has also coincided with
playing against some softer defens
es. I don't see them being able to
control the ball and keep their de
fense off the field against Stanford.

WS: How do you see the game un
folding then? Do you have a score
prediction?

CB: I think Stanford gets an early
lead in the first quarter and then just
runs the ball straight over Cal the
rest of the way. 45-20 Stanford.

that an easier schedule would have made much
difference in terms of how the team would be
playing right now. More so than anything else,
injuries have been the No. 1 reason for the
Bears' struggles. At this point they currently
have two of the 11 projected defensive starters
back in spring playing. They could have played
one of the easiest schedules in the country and

continued to struggle given how
many players they've had miss signif
icant time on both sides of the ball.

WS: So is there hope? The story
goes that Stanford only started im
proving after Tedford built a winner
in Strawberry Canyon it lit a fire
under the Stanford fan base. This
season may be difficult, but do you
at least believe that Stanford's resur
gence has ignited the Cal fan base?
Even if this season is lost, what hope
do you see coming?

CB: I think Stanford's success prob
ably irks much of the Cal fan base,
but I wouldn't go as far to say it has
"ignited" it. The Cal fan base started
to get pretty upset with the direction
of the football team in late 2007, and
has continued to demand a return to
relevancy. As far as the future, I think
most people are taking a wait-and
see approach with the Sonny Dykes
regime.

WS: Can Cal win? If so, how would
it happen?

CB: If the Bears can find away to
stop the run consistently while es
tablishing their own running game,
they could have a chance. But they
haven't shown any ability on de
fense to stop anybody, and I don't
see that changing this weekend.
They just don't have the personnel
healthy right now. Their ground
game has shown a little more im
provement in the past few weeks,
but that has also coincided with
playing against some softer defens
es. I don't see them being able to
control the ball and keep their de
fense off the field against Stanford.

WS: How do you see the game un
folding then? Do you have a score
prediction?

CB: I think Stanford gets an early
lead in the first quarter and then just
runs the ball straight over Cal the
rest of the way. 45-20 Stanford.
