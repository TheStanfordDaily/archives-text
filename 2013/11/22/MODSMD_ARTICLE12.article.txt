# BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DAILY CALIFORNIAN

### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's Big Game be
tween Stanford and Cat, The Daily's Win
ston Shi chatted with Connor Byrne, a
columnist for The Daily Californian, to get
perspective from both camps. Below is a
partial transcript of their conversation. For
the full conversation, go to www.stanford

Winston Shi (WS): Obviously Cal's record
has been disappointing, but has Cal improved
over the course of the season?

Connor Byrne (CB): There hasn't been any
tangible improvement. The offense still hasn't
found away to consistently score in the red
zone, the offensive line has continued to strug
gle providing any sort of pocket and the de
fense hasn't been able to stop anybody. A lot of
that can be attributed to just an absurd amount
of injuries. At one point in the season wide re
ceivers Bryce Treggs and Chris Harper started
working out with the defensive backs, as there
were almost a few situations where there were
just no other available cornerbacks to play.
However, there have been a handful of players
who have played the whole year without get
ting hurt, and they haven't shown any real im
provement. Cal's most impressive game contin
ues to be its opener against Northwestern,
which is looking less and less impressive given
that the Wildcats have imploded in recent
weeks.

WS: Cal played probably the hardest schedule
in the country to open the season: Northwest
ern, Ohio State and Oregon. I guess you could
say that the nail-biter against an FCS team was
a harbinger of bad things to come, but if Cal
had played a less brutal schedule do you think
the team would be playing better now?

CB: It's definitely possible, but given how it
struggled against Portland State, I'm not sure
that an easier schedule would have made much
difference in terms of how the team would be
playing right now. More so than anything else,
injuries have been the No. 1 reason for the
Bears' struggles. At this point they currently
have two of the 11 projected defensive starters
back in spring playing. They could have played
one of the easiest schedules in the country and

Senior tailback Tyler Gaffney (right) should have no problem finding some open holes in Cal's
defense. Gaffney rushed for 158 yards and two touchdowns in Stanford's loss at USC last week.
