# SECOND-HALF SURGE KEYS WIN
## Anthony Brown's 23 points lead Card to victory 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basket
ball team cruised to a 97-71 vic
tory over the Texas Southern
Tigers on Thursday night in its fi
nal game before heading east
next week, where it will play in
the semifinals of the Progressive
Legends Classic. Stanford's
strong string of second halves
continued as the Cardinal (4-1)
blew out the Tigers (2-4) in the
final frame.

The first half was a high-scor
ing affair as Stanford went into the
break leading 51-44. The Tigers
hung tough for most of the open
ing half thanks to strong offensive
performances by their leading
scorers Aaric Murray and Jose Ro
driguez, who each contributed 14
points. Stanford was led by the
sweet shooting of senior guard
Anthony Brown, who had 15
points in the period to go with
four rebounds, in addition to nine
points and three assists from fel
low senior guard Aaron Bright.
Bright gave the Cardinal a huge lift
off the bench, bringing the spark
and infectious energy that he has
been known for throughout his
career at Stanford.

"In shoot-around today, I was
just lights out," Bright said. "I just
felt really good tonight, and 1 just
wanted to come in and be aggres
sive."

Most of the first half was a
close contest, as neither team was
able to gain much separation.
Texas Southern actually led the

Cardinal 42-41 after a three-point
er by Rodriguez with 3:03 left to
play in the first half. That lead
would be the high-water mark of
the game for the Tigers, as Stan
ford would never trail again.
Brown's three-pointer at the
buzzer gave the Cardinal a seven
point lead going into halftime, and
it was the first sign of the rout to
come. Stanford outscored TSU
58-29 over the final 22:57 of the
game.

The Cardinal wasted no time
in blitzing the Tigers right out of
the gates in the second half, as it
opened with an authoritative 33-
11 run. Everybody chipped in for
Stanford on this night, as five play
ers finished in double figures.
Brown led the team with a career
high 23 points and 10 rebounds

on 9-of-13 shooting, including 3-
of-5 from three-point range. The
other major contributors for Stan
ford were senior forwards Josh
Huestis and Dwight Powell, who
combined for 29 points, 14 re
bounds, six assists and four mon
strous blocks that had the few
fans in attendance "oohing" and
"aahing."
Junior Chasson Randle had his
fifth-straight double-digit scoring
performance despite suffering his
worse shooting performance of
the young season. He finished
with 15 points, six assists and four
rebounds.

For Texas Southern, Murray
finished with 28 points but was
just 9-of-25 from the field, while

Senior guard Anthony Brown (above) scored a career-high 23 points
to go along with 10 rebounds, shooting 3-for-5 from three including
a buzzer beater going into the halftime break in the Card's 97-71 win.
Rodriguez totaled 24 points on 7-of
-17 shooting for the Tigers.
After the game, Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins was compli
mentary of his team's effort, which
even saw freshmen Schuyler Rim
mer, Malcolm Allen and Marcus
Allen all make their first collegiate
field goals.
"I thought it was one of our
best team efforts of the year,"
Dawkins said. "I thought our guys
really did an excellent job of sharing
the basketball, [with] 21 assists. We
had 21 offensive rebounds. It was
good to see our guys do that tonight
against a very good basketball
team."

Despite struggling defensively
during a first half in which it allowed
44 points and seven three-pointers
to a team from arguably the worst
conference in college basketball,
Stanford made the necessary defen
sive adjustments at halftime to pro
duce the expected result. The Car

dinal held the Tigers to just 30-per
cent shooting in the second half
while converting nine points off five
TSU turnovers.

"I think defensively, we did a
much better job of getting back and
making them a half-court team,"
Dawkins said. "I thought our activity
level picked up. I thought with our
physicality, we were able to wear
them down some. I thought we did
a much better job in the second half
of identifying their shooters and tak
ing some of their strengths away."
The victory on the court was
the cap to an exciting day for Stan
ford basketball, as the Cardinal had
earlier announced the signing of
four top-100 recruits for next sea
son's class. The class includes
guards Robert Cartwright and Dori
an Pickens, in addition to forwards
Michael Humphrey and Reid Travis.
This year's team will be in action
next on Monday night at 6:30 p.m.,
when it faces the Houston Cougars
in Brooklyn, N.Y, for the semifinals
of the Progressive Legends Classic.

The Stanford men's basket
ball team cruised to a 97-71 vic
tory over the Texas Southern
Tigers on Thursday night in its fi
nal game before heading east
next week, where it will play in
the semifinals of the Progressive
Legends Classic. Stanford's
strong string of second halves
continued as the Cardinal (4-1)
blew out the Tigers (2-4) in the
final frame.

The first half was a high-scor
ing affair as Stanford went into the
break leading 51-44. The Tigers
hung tough for most of the open
ing half thanks to strong offensive
performances by their leading
scorers Aaric Murray and Jose Ro
driguez, who each contributed 14
points. Stanford was led by the
sweet shooting of senior guard
Anthony Brown, who had 15
points in the period to go with
four rebounds, in addition to nine
points and three assists from fel
low senior guard Aaron Bright.
Bright gave the Cardinal a huge lift
off the bench, bringing the spark
and infectious energy that he has
been known for throughout his
career at Stanford.

"In shoot-around today, I was
just lights out," Bright said. "I just
felt really good tonight, and 1 just
wanted to come in and be aggres
sive."

Most of the first half was a
close contest, as neither team was
able to gain much separation.
Texas Southern actually led the

Cardinal 42-41 after a three-point
er by Rodriguez with 3:03 left to
play in the first half. That lead
would be the high-water mark of
the game for the Tigers, as Stan
ford would never trail again.
Brown's three-pointer at the
buzzer gave the Cardinal a seven
point lead going into halftime, and
it was the first sign of the rout to
come. Stanford outscored TSU
58-29 over the final 22:57 of the
game.

The Cardinal wasted no time
in blitzing the Tigers right out of
the gates in the second half, as it
opened with an authoritative 33-
11 run. Everybody chipped in for
Stanford on this night, as five play
ers finished in double figures.
Brown led the team with a career
high 23 points and 10 rebounds

on 9-of-13 shooting, including 3-
of-5 from three-point range. The
other major contributors for Stan
ford were senior forwards Josh
Huestis and Dwight Powell, who
combined for 29 points, 14 re
bounds, six assists and four mon
strous blocks that had the few
fans in attendance "oohing" and
"aahing."
Junior Chasson Randle had his
fifth-straight double-digit scoring
performance despite suffering his
worse shooting performance of
the young season. He finished
with 15 points, six assists and four
rebounds.

For Texas Southern, Murray
finished with 28 points but was
just 9-of-25 from the field, while

Senior guard Anthony Brown (above) scored a career-high 23 points
to go along with 10 rebounds, shooting 3-for-5 from three including
a buzzer beater going into the halftime break in the Card's 97-71 win.
Rodriguez totaled 24 points on 7-of
-17 shooting for the Tigers.
After the game, Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins was compli
mentary of his team's effort, which
even saw freshmen Schuyler Rim
mer, Malcolm Allen and Marcus
Allen all make their first collegiate
field goals.
"I thought it was one of our
best team efforts of the year,"
Dawkins said. "I thought our guys
really did an excellent job of sharing
the basketball, [with] 21 assists. We
had 21 offensive rebounds. It was
good to see our guys do that tonight
against a very good basketball
team."

Despite struggling defensively
during a first half in which it allowed
44 points and seven three-pointers
to a team from arguably the worst
conference in college basketball,
Stanford made the necessary defen
sive adjustments at halftime to pro
duce the expected result. The Car

dinal held the Tigers to just 30-per
cent shooting in the second half
while converting nine points off five
TSU turnovers.

"I think defensively, we did a
much better job of getting back and
making them a half-court team,"
Dawkins said. "I thought our activity
level picked up. I thought with our
physicality, we were able to wear
them down some. I thought we did
a much better job in the second half
of identifying their shooters and tak
ing some of their strengths away."
