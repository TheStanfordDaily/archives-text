# Appreciate the greatest of Stanford

### Joseph Beyda 
My freshman dorm had a bit
of a klepto thing. On the
last day of NSO, as the en
tire Class of 2015 congre
gated on the lawn in front
of President Hennessy's house, one of my
dormmates snatched a rope that was lying
on the ground and coiled it up. It turns out
that the rope was supposed to tell all

1,700 freshmen
where to stand for
the ensuing class
photo. A belated
apology if you got
cut out.
As the year
went on, our col
lection of contra-

band grew. An old Persian rug found be
hind the Roble Package Center became
one guy's welcome mat; a soccer ball
kicked over the fence in a night game at
Cagan Stadium was taped up as a hall dec
oration; a Monster banner hanging over a
table at Mausoleum was tied over one of
Loro's third-floor balconies.
But we never stole anything nearly as
cool as the Stanford Axe.
That's why it's hard not to be in awe
of Tim Conway '74 and David Suliteanu
'75, the two surviving members of the In
famous Three that engineered the last
theft of the Axe back in 1973. As a Daily
photographer and I set up for a photo
shoot with Tim and David before our inter
view earlier this week, it became clear that
the duo were legends, at least in the eyes
of the AxeComm members who had gra
ciously taken time out of their morning to
supervise.
The last two times Stanford students
stole the Axe (in 1930 and 1973), they
brought the trophy out into the open by
claiming that the press needed it for a pho
to. Accordingly and I confirmed this
with an AxeComm member my every
move was being watched.

But David and Tim were afforded a

different level of trust, the kind that
our society usually leaves for world
leaders, dignitaries and football
coaches.

It was a great reminder of the
history that we so often ignore at
Stanford: the beautifully built (and
rebuilt) Main Quad we bike past
every day, the Rodin bronzes sprin
kled around campus that few of us
(other than David Shaw) have time
to contemplate and the 104 NCAA
championship trophies that line
the walls of Arrillaga Family Sports
Center.

Every year Hal Mickelson '7l,
in his booming voice, emotionally
recounts the story of the Stanford
Axe at the Big Game Rally; every
year, just in time for Big Game, peo
ple like Tim and David help us re
connect with Cardinal history. The

question is: How do we sustain that
awe year-round?
It's really not that hard. Next
time you see one of the many
plaques hung on the perimeter of
the Outer Quad, look at its year and
contemplate what it means. Next
time you pass the Burghers of
Calais, make a funny face and take a
few selfies with the statues.

And next time you pass by the
athletics buildings, stop, go inside
and press your face up against the
display case that holds the Axe.
Think about the dates, the scores,
the memories.

Do it all before it's too late;
who knows when the Axe will be
stolen next?

Joseph Beyda is currently under
scrutiny for trying to steal the axe
during the photo shoot in keeping
with his freshman dorm's "klepto
thing." if you would like to provide a
defense for him email Joey at jbey
