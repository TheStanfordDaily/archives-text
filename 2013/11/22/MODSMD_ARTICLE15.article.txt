# AN UNFAMILIAR UNDERDOG
## Second round of NCAAs awaits Cardinal women 
### FIONA NOONAN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 17 Cardinal (14-5-
1) will experience deja vu
tonight as the team kicks off
against No. 14 South Carolina
(17-3-2) at UCLA's Drake Stadi
um for its second-round NCAA
tournament match.

The teams have played
each other only once before,
but the last time was a second
round NCAA tournament
match two years ago, when
Stanford beat the Gamecocks 2-
0 and went on to win the na
tional championship. This time,
however, Stanford goes in as
the underdog. Though the Card
won't have home field advan
tage this time around, playing at

UCLA is familiar territory, and
the seasoned women's team
knows how to succeed on the
road, having lost only one road
match during the entire regular
season.

"We know that environ
ment, and it's a good field that
we're playing on," said head
coach Paul Ratcliffe. "We've got
to go down there hungry, and
we've got to give our best effort
and see what we can do."

Stanford's biggest chal
lenge will undoubtedly be scor
ing against a solid South Caroli
na defense, which has allowed
only 13 goals all season.
Despite an absolute bar
rage of shots on goal against Cal
State Fullerton in the first
round, the Cardinal managed to
convert just once, on a goal by
junior Taylor Uhl.

"I think we need to do a
better job of finishing our op
portunities," Ratcliffe said after
the Fullerton match. "But that
comes with time, and hopefully

we're saving the goals for later
rounds."
Uhl, who leads Stanford for
goals scored with 11 this sea
son, could be the go-to player
again tonight, especially if she is
given quality minutes on the
field for the second consecutive
match. Senior forward and co
captain Courtney Verloo, who
was named to the All-Pac-12
First Team last week, may be
critical on the offensive end as
well. The Cardinal will look to
take advantage of her ability to
score on set pieces.

Junior forward Chioma
Übogagu, who received an All-
Pac-12 Honorable Mention, has
also been an offensive presence
all season. She had four shots
on goal against Fullerton, and
she could certainly have an im
pact again during tonight's
match.

On the South Carolina
side, players to watch will be

round match last Friday.
Though third-seeded South Carolina
has huge momentum coming off of a 5-0
blowout against Furman in the first round,
the Cardinal has the advantage in terms of
playoff experience coming into this match.
The second round is a chance for Stan
ford to prove that it is still a contender, de
spite a rocky regular season, and the team is
looking forward to that challenge.
"It's a huge honor to still be playing at
this point in the season," Uhl said. "We're
just very happy that we're still playing."
Stanford kicks off its second-round
match tonight against South Carolina at 5
p.m. in Los Angeles.
