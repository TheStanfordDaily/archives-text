# STANFORD PREVAILS IN PENALTIES
## 
### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Generally, if you score a goal and an assist,
you're having a great game. If that goal hap
pens to be the winning penalty kick, then
you're having a fantastic game. If you're a
goalie, and you save a penalty kick, you're hav
ing a stunning game. If you happen to be Stan
ford's senior goalkeeper Drew Hutchins and
have done all three of these things, you're hav
ing a once-in-a-lifetime performance.
Drew Hutchins didn't want to go home to
Morrisville, Pennsylvania, just yet. In order to
prolong his and Stanford's tournament
life, all he needed was one of the finest individ
ual displays this year.

For a long time, it appeared that this game
would be a fitting end to Stanford's season.
Having dominated from the outset and estab
lishing a 16-5 lead in shots, Stanford (9-6-3)
outplayed the Loyola Marymount Lions (13-
4-2) from start to finish, yet had no goal to
reward it for its troubles. Just as in many of
the games this season, the Card was pun
ished for its inability to finish in front of the
goal, with LMU taking what seemed to be an
insurmountable lead in the 83rd minute.
LMU midfielder John McFarlin, already pos
sessing 10 assists for the season, added an
other to his tally when he squared the ball
for forward Adrien Perez, who unleashed a
20-yard shot into the top-right corner of the
goal. There was nothing Hutchins could do.
Not yet.

Among the Stanford chances it would
have rued were senior Bobby Edwards' vol
ley, pushed away by LMU's sophomore
goalie Paul Blechette, and sophomore mid
fielder Ty Thompson's header, also saved by
Blechette. Senior midfielder and captain JJ
Koval missed two headers just wide of the
post, while freshman forward Jordan Morris
blazed a volley just over the bar. None of
that would matter anymore, it seemed, as

Stanford appeared to have succumbed once
again to a worrying trend of allowing a late
goal to doom its chances.
The Card fought on, and in that fight
came a moment that could only be described
as magical: 90th minute, 20 seconds left in
regulation. Junior wingback Jimmy Callinan
sent in one last hopeful cross and Hutchins
swooped in, in a penalty box that seemed so
foreign to him, and got a headed flick-on.
The ball fell to junior forward Zach Batteer's
feet, and he lashed a left-footed volley into
the bottom corner. At first he was shocked,
and then an expression of pure joy creased
his face. 1-1. Pandemonium.

Obviously, the game was not over. Both
sides had their chances in extra time, with a
Perez shot being deflected just past the post
and junior Connor Hunsicker's volley saved
by Hutchins. For Stanford, Batteer had an
other volley pushed away, while Koval
flashed wide a volley that seemed destined
for the bottom corner. Unfortunately for the
blood pressures of the crowd in attendance
at Cagan Stadium, the deadlock could not be
broken so the game went to penalties.
To say penalties started badly for Stan

ford would be an understatement. Both Ko
val and sophomore winger Aaron Kovar saw
their penalties saved by Blechette, meaning
LMU took a 1-0 lead after two rounds of
penalties, thanks to junior defender Craig
Nitti slotting his penalty past Hutchins.
Stanford, however, would not give in.
Sophomore centreback Brandon Vincent
and Morris converted the next two penal
ties, while LMU's Perez saw his cannon back
off the post.
That made it 2-2 after four rounds. Up
stepped Hutchins. Of course, he slotted his
penalty into the bottom left corner: 3-2.
Then, he turned around and saved Hunsick
er's penalty, diving low to his left to give
Stanford a 3-2 victory on penalties.
There was pandemonium again, and in
the center of it all was an amazed Drew
Hutchins, trying desperately to savor this
moment. Stanford lived to fight another day.

The Cardinal will travel to 15th-seeded
Cal State Northridge (15-6-1) on Sunday and
hopes to continue its charmed tournament
life.
