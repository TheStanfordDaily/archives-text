## TELEVISON REVIEW "The Walking Dead" 
### CALEB SMITH 
When "The Walking
Dead" first burst
onto the scene, it
was an instant hit,
to say the least. The
first season was fan
tastic, breathing new life into
the dying zombie genre. How
ever, both seasons two and
three had their problems, and
even though they were good,
they never quite lived up to

their potential. Season four
from the start has addressed
the series' main issues and is
shaping up to be the best yet.
Introducing a new threat
to the protagonists in the form
of a lethal flu virus was a great
change of pace for the show.
Seeing how the group dealt
with an intangible threat as
well as regular zombies was
riveting. By doing this, the

writers were able to slow down the
story and develop the characters.
This was used most effectively with
Carol's character. From the begin
ning of the show, she was written as
a weak and helpless, but as the
show continued, she adapted, be
coming stronger with each passing
season. They have also rectified
their earlier mistakes with Mi
chonne, making her much more en
gaging and shedding a little light on
her backstory. It was still disappoint
ing to see characters such as Karen
die so quickly because it is hard to
feel emotional about their deaths
when you barely knew them.
Hershel also gets some much
needed screen time, as he is por
trayed as more than just the wise
old man. Having him care for the
sick people in the jail was a great
way to bring out his inner conflict
with why all this was happening.

He began questioning his beliefs
but, in the end, stuck to his faith. It
will be interesting to see how
Tyrese and Daryl react to Carol's
departure especially the latter,
as they had formed a strong bond
over the course of the show.

Rick's struggle with his multi
ple roles as farmer, leader and fa
ther also comes to the forefront as
he is faced with hard decisions. His
emotions are expertly conveyed to
make the viewer understand what
he's going through as he is torn be
tween trying to live a normal life
and taking up the mantle of leading
the group. He also feels as though
he has to try and preserve Carl's in
nocence by shielding him from the
events unfurling around them.
Some might complain that this
season has not been as fast-paced
and action-packed as previous sea
sons, but it's amazing how the

show keeps finding new ways for
the group to fight zombies. The
scene with the zombies falling
through the ceiling was downright
terrifying. Kudos to the special ef
fects and makeup teams as well, as

their work continues to excel.
Now that the threat of the
virus will soon be over, it will be in
teresting to see where the story
goes from here after the little tease
at the end of the last episode. If the

writers can successfully bring the
Governor back into the fold, we are
in for an explosive season.
