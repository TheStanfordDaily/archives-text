# "Evita": A fresh take on a CLASSIC MUSICAL
## 
### NOEMI BERKOWITZ 
She was a legend in her time, a
figure adored, envied and hat
ed all at once. Eva Peron, the
subject of Andrew Lloyd Web
ber and Tim Rice's musical
"Evita," was revived on Broad
way in 2012 and has now begun its
national tour. This week, that tour
brings its powerful production to the
San Jose Center for Performing Arts.
There have been a few changes

from the original 1978 production:
The narrator character of Che is por
trayed more as an "everyman" reflect
ing the voice of the people (and not as
the revolutionary Che Guevara), and
the Oscar-winning song "You Must
Love Me" —written for the 1996
film has been added to the produc
tion. These changes are welcome, but
the musical comes across as slightly
outdated in spite of them.
Eva herself is, after all, por
trayed very harshly. Criticism has

been leveled at the musical for inaccu
racy in portraying her as a woman who
only succeeded because she slept her
way to the top. The audience must
constantly remind themselves that the
sexism and lack of female independ
ence is indicative of the time, but it's
not always easy to do.
That being said, director
Michael Grandage has done a won
derful job with this production, and

the Performing Arts this week. This incarnation of the classic musical provides a fresh take on Evita's character.
its only shortcomings are from the script,
because the execution is nearly flawless.
The show's design is breathtaking, with ab
solutely gorgeous lighting design by Neil
Austin and equally stunning set and cos
tume design by Christopher Oram. The at
tention to detail creates a fully realized and
accurate backdrop for the standout per
formances.

Caroline Bowman is a tour de force as
she transforms believably from a young and
flighty Eva, to a calculated social climber, to
the adored Spiritual Leader of the Nation of
Argentina, and finally to an ailing and physi
cally declining woman. She tackles each of
these aspects of Eva with ease, and her com
manding and beautiful voice carries most of
the show's musical numbers.

She is complemented by Josh Young, a
phenomenal Che, and Sean MacLaughlin,
who plays an admirable Juan Peron. Young
has an incredible voice and holds the audi
ence's attention anytime he comes on
stage. Another standout voice and per
formance was Krystina Alabado as the Mis
tress; her musical number, "Another Suit
case in Another Hall," was one of my fa
vorites of the show.

The ensemble is dynamic and engag
ing, with beautiful choreography that could
be just a little more in sync. Their vocals
and presence, however, never waver, and

they believably create the landscape of Ar
gentina onstage.

All in all, this production brings a new
energy and flair to "Evita," and its most fa
mous numbers, such as "Don't Cry for Me,
Argentina," live up to their hype. It

brought the San Jose audience to its feet in
a long-lasting standing ovation. It may not

be able to conceal the difficulties inherent
in staging this play in our modern world,
but it certainly will provide a memorable
night at the theater with performances and
design sure to leave a lasting impact.
