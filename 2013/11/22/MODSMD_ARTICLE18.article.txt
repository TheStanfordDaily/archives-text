# "Evita": A fresh take on a CLASSIC MUSICAL
## 
### NOEMI BERKOWITZ 
She was a legend in her time, a
figure adored, envied and hat
ed all at once. Eva Peron, the
subject of Andrew Lloyd Web
ber and Tim Rice's musical
"Evita," was revived on Broad
way in 2012 and has now begun its
national tour. This week, that tour
brings its powerful production to the
San Jose Center for Performing Arts.
There have been a few changes

from the original 1978 production:
The narrator character of Che is por
trayed more as an "everyman" reflect
ing the voice of the people (and not as
the revolutionary Che Guevara), and
the Oscar-winning song "You Must
Love Me" â€”written for the 1996
film has been added to the produc
tion. These changes are welcome, but
the musical comes across as slightly
outdated in spite of them.
Eva herself is, after all, por
trayed very harshly. Criticism has

been leveled at the musical for inaccu
racy in portraying her as a woman who
only succeeded because she slept her
way to the top. The audience must
constantly remind themselves that the
sexism and lack of female independ
ence is indicative of the time, but it's
not always easy to do.
That being said, director
Michael Grandage has done a won
derful job with this production, and
