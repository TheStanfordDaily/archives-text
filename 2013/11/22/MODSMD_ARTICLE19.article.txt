## Holiday Fashion Tips 
### LAYNIE STEPHENS FASHION COLUMNIST 
As Thanksgiving approaches and many of
us prepare to return home for family
gatherings, some may fear that they
have nothing to wear for holiday events.
But don't fret quite yet after this ar
ticle you'll know exactly how to trick
your family into thinking that your style has
improved since you last saw them.
1. For starters, let's talk about fit arguably
the most important thing when it comes to
planning your outfit. Honestly, I don't care
what you wear to your holiday events, so long
as your clothes fit you properly. (Except
I probably would mind if you showed
up in sweatpants. Or a body suit.) Fit
sounds like it should be pretty simple,
right? Not too tight, not to baggy. Simple
enough, yet I still see fit disasters on a
daily basis. Think about it this way: If the
clothes don't make you feel absolutely
fabulous, they probably aren't the best
fit. Good-fitting clothes are always flatter
ing. Choose your best for the holidays!

2. Next item of business: appropriate
ness another very important item to
consider. There is (usually) a difference
between family events and clubbing,
right? So be sure to tailor your outfit ap
propriately. Now is not the time to wear
that short new dress you just got, or that
controversial T-shirt you wear for fun.

Add some tights to that dress, and
change your T-shirt! It is time to be classy,
at least for a few hours.

3. Finally, be sure to create an outfit. An
outfit is what turns clothes into fashion.
Add some jewelry, put on a scarf or have
those cute, detailed knee-high socks
peek out from your boots. Need some
accessorizing inspiration?

I am absolutely loving Banana Re
public's Regalia Statement Necklace this
season. It's military-inspired, with just
the right amount of sparkle and glam. It
also features a ribbon tie behind your
neck. Could it get any more perfect?

Not into necklaces? Try a watch! An
eye-catching one not only helps you keep
track of how much longer you'll have to
wait for pumpkin pie but also completes
an outfit quite perfectly. I know it might
seem hard to find a nice-looking watch
that is not too expensive, but try Nord

strom's BP Juniors' department a lot of
their watches are surprisingly around $2O,
and there are plenty of different styles to
choose from. My favorite is their rose
gold-colored Titanium Bracelet Watch.

Who said lip lacquer wasn't an ac
cessory? I'm currently obsessed with the
Rimmel London Show Off Lip Lacquer
(available at Walgreens) in the shade Au
rora, a lighter and brighter red. I prefer
wearing it as a lip stain, by dabbing the
product off with a tissue after applying.
Wear this lip with an all-black outfit and a
few accessories, and you'll be perfectly
ready for the holidays.
Now that you have these tips, go
home and impress your family with your
new fashion knowledge! If you create a
unique enough outfit, they might even
start thinking you always dress that nice
