## The
						Infamous Three Looking back on the last successful Axe heist 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Tim Conway '74 and David Suliteanu
'75 were caught off guard at the Big Game ral
ly on Monday night. It wasn't star linebacker
Shayne Skov's "Macho Man" Randy Savage
accent as emcee, or the fireworks that were
periodically launched from Angell Field dur
ing the show.
The biggest surprise was the Stanford
Axe. It felt heavy.
A lot can change in 40 years.
On Nov. 20, 1973, Stanford students
Conway and Suliteanu stole the Axe in the
lead-up to Big Game, earning the nickname
"The Infamous Three" for themselves and
Conway's brother Matt, their fellow conspir
ator. But after the Axe was returned to Cal
moments before kickoff, Conway and
Suliteanu never picked it up again.
Not until they hoisted it at this week's
rally, that is.
"The highlight was getting our hands on
that Axe again," Suliteanu said. "Being able to
carry it out on stage and show it, it was per
fect ... Think about that. Forty years, almost
to the day."
Though the Axe still changes hands on
the playing field regularly—Stanford won
the trophy back just hours after The Infamous
Three gave it up Conway and Suliteanu
are the last people to successfully engineer its
heist. Maybe that's why that Thanksgiving
Week back in 1973 is still such a high point.
"After 40 years of being out there in the
working world doing whatever you do,
there's a lot of neat things that come along,"
Conway said. "But when you look at the
whole big picture it definitely stands out as a
really big part of our lives."
With Conway and Suliteanu, that's saying
something. Besides his day job working in con
struction labor relations, Conway has operated

a wilderness camp in Alaska for 30 years;
Suliteanu, meanwhile, served for 13 years as
the president and CEO of cosmetics retailer
Sephora. They've stayed in touch the entire
time, and this year they've taken trips to Alaska
and wine country to celebrate Suliteanu's 60th
birthday.
Suliteanu claims he's told the story of
the heist 100 times. Once, he was interview
ing with a job recruiter from Home Depot
who had a policy against asking candidates
questions—instead, he just wanted to hear
their life stories. Suliteanu obliged, and when
he got to his college years, he mentioned that
he had stolen the Stanford Axe.
That's when the recruiter the one
who usually refuses to ask questions
broke in. He had gone to Cal, and he wanted
to hear everything. Thirty minutes later,
Suliteanu had the job.

The tale of the heist is as dramatic as it
is legendary. Conway hatched the plan only
a couple of weeks before Big Game. Matt,
then a student at San Francisco School of
Law, would impersonate Cal head coach
Mike White over the phone and ask the Cal

student union manager to hand over the
Axe to two of his "players" Conway and
Suliteanu —who needed it for a press
luncheon at Ming's Restaurant in Palo Alto.
Conway completed the disguise by telling a
friend on the Golden Bears baseball team
that he needed two Cal letterman jackets for
a costume party.

But when Conway and Suliteanu ar
rived at the student union on that fateful
Tuesday, the Axe wasn't there it was be
ing safeguarded at the Berkeley police sta
tion for Big Game week. With a policeman
stationed right outside the manager's office,
the impostors could only sit and wait for
Matt to call again.

"I felt a little bit trapped," Conway said.
"When we were sitting there in that office, I
remember thinking, 'What are we doing
here? This is not a good place to be.'"
Finally, the phone rang; it was Matt.
The manager explained the predicament,
but "Coach White" was insistent —he
needed the Axe, and he didn't want his
"players" to be late.

that the trophy was needed for a press conference at a restaurant in Palo Alto.
