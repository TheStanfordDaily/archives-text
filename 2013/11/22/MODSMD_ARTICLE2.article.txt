## The 						Infamous Three Looking back on the last successful Axe heist 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Tim Conway '74 and David Suliteanu
'75 were caught off guard at the Big Game ral
ly on Monday night. It wasn't star linebacker
Shayne Skov's "Macho Man" Randy Savage
accent as emcee, or the fireworks that were
periodically launched from Angell Field dur
ing the show.
The biggest surprise was the Stanford
Axe. It felt heavy.
A lot can change in 40 years.
On Nov. 20, 1973, Stanford students
Conway and Suliteanu stole the Axe in the
lead-up to Big Game, earning the nickname
"The Infamous Three" for themselves and
Conway's brother Matt, their fellow conspir
ator. But after the Axe was returned to Cal
moments before kickoff, Conway and
Suliteanu never picked it up again.
Not until they hoisted it at this week's
rally, that is.
"The highlight was getting our hands on
that Axe again," Suliteanu said. "Being able to
carry it out on stage and show it, it was per
fect ... Think about that. Forty years, almost
to the day."
Though the Axe still changes hands on
the playing field regularly—Stanford won
the trophy back just hours after The Infamous
Three gave it up Conway and Suliteanu
are the last people to successfully engineer its
heist. Maybe that's why that Thanksgiving
Week back in 1973 is still such a high point.
"After 40 years of being out there in the
working world doing whatever you do,
there's a lot of neat things that come along,"
Conway said. "But when you look at the
whole big picture it definitely stands out as a
really big part of our lives."
With Conway and Suliteanu, that's saying
something. Besides his day job working in con
struction labor relations, Conway has operated

a wilderness camp in Alaska for 30 years;
Suliteanu, meanwhile, served for 13 years as
the president and CEO of cosmetics retailer
Sephora. They've stayed in touch the entire
time, and this year they've taken trips to Alaska
and wine country to celebrate Suliteanu's 60th
birthday.
Suliteanu claims he's told the story of
the heist 100 times. Once, he was interview
ing with a job recruiter from Home Depot
who had a policy against asking candidates
questions—instead, he just wanted to hear
their life stories. Suliteanu obliged, and when
he got to his college years, he mentioned that
he had stolen the Stanford Axe.
That's when the recruiter the one
who usually refuses to ask questions
broke in. He had gone to Cal, and he wanted
to hear everything. Thirty minutes later,
Suliteanu had the job.

The tale of the heist is as dramatic as it
is legendary. Conway hatched the plan only
a couple of weeks before Big Game. Matt,
then a student at San Francisco School of
Law, would impersonate Cal head coach
Mike White over the phone and ask the Cal

student union manager to hand over the
Axe to two of his "players" Conway and
Suliteanu —who needed it for a press
luncheon at Ming's Restaurant in Palo Alto.
Conway completed the disguise by telling a
friend on the Golden Bears baseball team
that he needed two Cal letterman jackets for
a costume party.

But when Conway and Suliteanu ar
rived at the student union on that fateful
Tuesday, the Axe wasn't there it was be
ing safeguarded at the Berkeley police sta
tion for Big Game week. With a policeman
stationed right outside the manager's office,
the impostors could only sit and wait for
Matt to call again.

"I felt a little bit trapped," Conway said.
"When we were sitting there in that office, I
remember thinking, 'What are we doing
here? This is not a good place to be.'"
Finally, the phone rang; it was Matt.
The manager explained the predicament,
but "Coach White" was insistent —he
needed the Axe, and he didn't want his
"players" to be late.

football players during their theft of the Axe in 1973. They then convinced Cal students
that the trophy was needed for a press conference at a restaurant in Palo Alto.
The Cal Rally Committee re
trieved the Axe, but they wouldn't
just hand it over. Instead, four mem
bers agreed to take the Axe in a sepa
rate car and follow Conway and
Suliteanu all the way to Ming's.
"We had to drive from Berkeley
to Palo Alto, with the Axe in a car be
hind us," Suliteanu remembered.
"Two of us, four of them. We had one
hour, approximately, to think about
what we were going to do, and how.
And basically, we just looked at each
other and said, 'You know what? We
came this far. No matter what, we're
going for it. Whatever happens, we're
going to try to get our hands on it.'"

When Suliteanu and Conway
pulled into Ming's, they saw some of
their Theta Delta Chi fraternity broth
ers tossing a football in the parking
lot. Matt had run out of toll money
for the trip back, but he had called for
backup.

As two of the Rally Committee
members helped him cover the Axe
from the rain, Conway grabbed the
trophy, yelled out and took off run
ning. Suliteanu instinctually bear
hugged one of the Cal students, leav
ing Conway to fend off the other
three. But the bulk slowed him down,
and they eventually tackled Conway
onto a pink Cadillac that was sitting in
the parking lot.

The Axe slid out of his hands and
onto the top of the wet car, where
one of the Rally Committee members
grabbed it. Just moments later, how

ever, a swarm of Conway's fraternity
brothers arrived to snatch it for good.
After some group photos at
Theta Delta Chi, the Axe was quickly
spirited away to Suliteanu's grand
mother's house. The conspirators had
no choice; they had been spotted by
the media at Ming's. But even though
Conway and Suliteanu were soon
contacted by the police chief and Uni
versity officials, the Axe remained
safe.

"Think about the temptation,"
Suliteanu said. "You've got this thing,
and what you really wanted to do was
go grab it and go run around with it...
Our thinking was, 'Let's stay away
from it.'"

The Infamous Three submitted a
list of creative demands among
them, $6,000, admission to the Stan
ford graduate school of their choice
and Thanksgiving dinner with Univer
sity president Richard Lyman be
fore eventually exchanging the Axe
for Big Game field passes. They drove
into Stanford Stadium on Saturday
morning and handed the trophy over
to the police chief, Sports Informa
tion Director Bob Murphy and Cardi
nal head coach Jack Christiansen, and
Stanford's captains returned it to Cal
during the pregame coin toss.

Besides the scuffle at Ming's, a
couple of brief photo sessions and the
pregame exchange, the Axe remained
safely under Suliteanu's grandmoth
er's bed for the entire week leading
up to the 1973 Big Game. That's part
of the reason why Monday's rally was
so special to Conway and Suliteanu.
They hadn't just waited 40 years to
hold the Axe again; they had waited
40 years to truly celebrate with it.
But the two surviving members
of The Infamous Three aren't cele
brating alone this week. On Thursday
night, over Conway's barbequing and
tri-tips, their tale was told one more
time at Theta Delta Chi to fraternity
brothers young and old.
"What a great excuse to recon
nect with them and get them togeth
er," Suliteanu said. "You've got these
guys who are in the fraternity now,
and truthfully, they don't know much
about us, they don't know much
about [the heist]. And so you can put
[this] huge, giant generation gap to

gether for one evening, in the house
where we lived."

About 50 fraternity members
from the '7os are in town to celebrate
the heist's 40th anniversary with the
barbeque, a private dinner Friday
night and a tailgate Saturday morning.
They're not the only ones for whom
the memory of November 1973 still
holds meaning; the story is a sense of
pride for the Stanford community as
a whole. Jim Cost, one of the Palo Al
to police officers who investigated the
theft, even lists the case on his

linkedln page.
But to call the tale of The Infa
mous Three just a great memory is, it
self, minimizing. That's because of
the trio's outlandish demands, one
their request that Stanford create
a display case for the Axe —was ac
tually implemented by the University
soon after the heist.
The Axe hasn't been stolen
since.
