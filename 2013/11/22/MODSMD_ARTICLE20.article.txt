## NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts bring musical intimacy 
### LINDSAY MEWES 
I am here to tell you about my
latest obsession: Tiny Desk
Concerts. These concerts are
exactly what the name sug
gests mini sets literally
played from behind the desks
residing in National Public Ra
dio's (NPR) music office in Wash
ington D.C.
Since 2008, NPR has hosted
hundreds of musical artists at its
office with the intention of shar
ing genuinely awesome music
with the world. I love Tiny Desk
Concerts because they include

both big acts as well as unknown
and up-and-coming artists from a
variety of genres indie rock,
pop, country, classical... you
name it to ensure that the se
ries appeals to all music lovers by
providing them with old favorites
as well as opportunities to discov
er new ones. Past guests include
Alt-J, Yo-Yo Ma and The Lone Bel
low, to name a few.

Here is how it works: The
artists perform two to four songs
in front of a small audience of
NPR employees in an intimate
and unique setting. The result is
performances that are raw and

emotional. I know this not be
cause I have been to the NPR of
fice for a concert, but because
each one is filmed and uploaded
to the NPR Music website and
Youtube channel so that the pub
lic can also enjoy the incredible
experience. You can even down
load the audio of each perform
ance courtesy of NPR or sub
scribe to the free podcast on
iTunes.

Yet aside from the concerts'
unusual concept, what sets the
series apart is the high-definition

video and sound quality. Witnessing an
artist's facial expressions and body
movements in extreme detail while lis
tening to crystal-clear vocals as he or
she pours heart and soul into a per
formance infuses the songs with
greater meaning. It also exposes an
artist's emotional vulnerability, which
adds to the performance's intensity.
Let me put it this way: The only thing
better than watching John Legend go
nuts on the piano as he melts your
heart with his ballad "Made to Love" is
gazing into his beautiful, brown eyes

as he does so. (And yes, I know the col
or of his eyes because I have gazed in
to them while watching his Tiny Desk
performance over and over again since
its release —which was today. I might
have a problem.)
Plus, each video typically lasts be
tween 12 and 16 minutes, making it
easy to squeeze one in as the perfect
study break or two, or three ... or
10. So next time you are bummed
about missing a concert in the city, ex
hausted from working on psets or sim
ply looking for a nice way to spend your

evening without emerging from the
cave that is your room, give Tiny Desk
a shot. I recommend checking out
Daughter's set first whether you
are familiar with the London-based in
die rock band or not followed by
Night Beds, a band with an incredible
21st-century folk/alternative sound.
Then turn down the lights, turn up the
volume, put that baby in full-screen
mode and prepare to be amazed.
