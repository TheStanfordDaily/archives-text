# Roxy Sass: Roxy has many thanks to give
## 
### 
Tis the season to give thanks, and Roxy's always
been a fan of vocalizing her appreciation. She
might not be able to share these around the family
dinner table, but here are a few things Roxy is
thankful for this year:

Yoga pants The tail-end of fall quarter brings with it
not only obnoxiously early Christmas tunes but also the
advent of Lululemon season. Although, in Roxy's opinion,
these wonders of female fashion can be worn all year
round, a quick look around Tresidder on a crisp autumn
day reveals a higher-than-usual tally of collegiettes in cute
flannels, boots and stretchy pants that caress every curve.
Roxy might not have paid too much attention in econ (she
facilitates a different kind of inflation), but she does un
derstand the importance of highlighting your ass-ets.

Hometown hookups Going home for the holidays has
perks other than turkey and family: It's the perfect time
to reconnect with that old high school flame. Roxy likes
to get things off to a good start during Thanksgiv
ing break so she can count on a snuggle buddy for the
long, cold winter holidays away from the studs of Stan
ford.

New Arrillaga gym Roxy's most sincere thanks go to
Mr. Arrillaga himself for supplying the students of Stan
ford with yet another place to meet athletic hotties...
and chat up swimmers at the pool. Roxy will help you
practice your breaststroke anytime.

Senior nights As a perpetual senior, Roxy is what you
might call an "old pro" at pub nights. Somehow it's more
exciting to hook up at a bar in PA than KA... especially
when it's with that random guy you haven't seen since
freshman year IHUM section. And those bus rides can
provide the perfect opportunity to snuggle up on the way
there and get down on the way back.

Cookie dough in open kitchens Enough said.

Gobble, gobble, wink, wink. Let Roxy know how thankful
you are for her at life@stanforddaily.com.
