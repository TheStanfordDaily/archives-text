# Scene at Stanford

### 
Students on the Farm this
quarter aren't the only ones
with school spirit. From the
snow-capped mountains of
Chile to the depths of the Aus
tralian coral reefs, students
studying abroad (or in D.C.)
show off their Cardinal loyalties
during the Big Game weeks
2012 and 2013. So yell it with
them: Beat Call
