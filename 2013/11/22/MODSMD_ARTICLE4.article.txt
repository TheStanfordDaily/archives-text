# Axe Committee prepares campus for Big Game
## Rally; "Beat Cal" banners, train whistle build spirit 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
In the week leading up to the annual foot
ball rivalry game between Stanford and Cal,
campus takes on a spirited atmosphere with red
fountains, "Beat Cal" banners decorating the
sides of Meyer Library and the train whistle in
White Plaza providing an hourly reminder that
Big Game is coming.
The organization responsible for carrying
out these traditions is the Stanford Axe Commit
tee, a group of approximately 30 students that
describes itself as the "custodians of Stanford
spirit, tradition and revelry." While the Axe
Committee promotes school spirit at events
throughout the year, Big Game week represents
the group's most significant effort.

"It is a lot of coordination but since most of
the things we do during Big Game week are tra
ditions, we kind of know what we're doing," ex
plained Jenni Allison' 16, the director of campus
outreach for the Axe Committee.
The Axe Committee kicked off the week
leading up to the 116 th Big Game with a rally
held at Cobb Track and Angell Field that includ
ed fireworks, appearances by the football team
and performances by student groups.

Axe Committee Chairman Daniel Kozlows
ki 'l4 said that the Axe Committee decided to
move the rally from Old Union to the track sta
dium for the 2012 rally and saw a marked in
crease in attendance. This year, Kozlowski said
that while attendance was still strong, it was
lower than expected, which he attributed to the
colder temperature and the football team's de
flating loss to USC last weekend.
Many of the other components of Big Game
week, such as the dyed fountains and collection
of Beat Cal banners, are traditions with decades
of history behind them. Though the look is sim
ilar, the banners hanging from Meyer Library
this year are of higher quality than years past.
"We used to make them by hand, but this
year we ordered them so it's a little more fancy,"
Allison said. "But essentially we keep most of
our traditions the same; we just tweak things."
Kozlowski noted that with Meyer Library
tentatively scheduled to be demolished next

year, the Axe Committee will have to find a new
location to hang their banners.
"That's going to be an interesting challenge
going forward —we have a few ideas but I
think it's largely dependent on the facility," Ko-

Beginning in 2012, the Axe Committee moved
the annual Big Game rally from Old Union to
Cobb Track and Angell Field, where the event
could incorporate a pyrotechnics display.
zlowski said. "The only option I would
say that is really as visible is Hoover Tow
er, but I don't know how feasible putting
[a banner] on Hoover Tower would be."

The Axe Committee's namesake re
sponsibility— protecting the Axe

takes on additional importance during Big
Game week.
Kozlowski said that the Axe is re
moved from its usual home in the Arrilla
ga Family Sports Center and taken to a
secret location for safekeeping. He would
not disclose where it was kept or how
many people knew the current location.
Allison said that when the Axe is

brought to various Big Game week events
such as the rally or Gaieties, the Axe
Committee takes special precautions to
protect it.
"When we have it, we have to be
physically chained to the Axe they'll
wrap like a tie around your waist, so that
if somebody wants to take the Axe they
literally have to take like three Axe
Comm members with them," Allison ex
plained.
Kozlowski said that this type of secu
rity is why no one has been able to steal
the Axe since the Axe Committee in its
current form was founded in 1983. Be
fore that, the Axe was protected by a va
riety of organizations, which led to a se
ries of thefts.

"We have not had anyone try to steal
it from us in a very long time but Cal

does come every year and we must as
sume that they are coming to attempt to
steal it and thus we must protect it," Al
lison said. "Even though they've never
managed to get anywhere near the Axe
because that's Cal and they can't fig
ure things out. "
As the week wraps to a close, the
Axe Committee turns its focus to the ac
tual Big Game, where the Axe can be
won and lost in earnest.

"It's a relationship between Cal and
Stanford that has been going strong for
the last 120 years," Kozlowski said.
"Even if we are rivals on the field, I think
we really want to celebrate both our
schools and each other."

In the week leading up to the annual foot
ball rivalry game between Stanford and Cal,
campus takes on a spirited atmosphere with red
fountains, "Beat Cal" banners decorating the
sides of Meyer Library and the train whistle in
White Plaza providing an hourly reminder that
Big Game is coming.
The organization responsible for carrying
out these traditions is the Stanford Axe Commit
tee, a group of approximately 30 students that
describes itself as the "custodians of Stanford
spirit, tradition and revelry." While the Axe
Committee promotes school spirit at events
throughout the year, Big Game week represents
the group's most significant effort.

"It is a lot of coordination but since most of
the things we do during Big Game week are tra
ditions, we kind of know what we're doing," ex
plained Jenni Allison' 16, the director of campus
outreach for the Axe Committee.
The Axe Committee kicked off the week
leading up to the 116 th Big Game with a rally
held at Cobb Track and Angell Field that includ
ed fireworks, appearances by the football team
and performances by student groups.

Axe Committee Chairman Daniel Kozlows
ki 'l4 said that the Axe Committee decided to
move the rally from Old Union to the track sta
dium for the 2012 rally and saw a marked in
crease in attendance. This year, Kozlowski said
that while attendance was still strong, it was
lower than expected, which he attributed to the
colder temperature and the football team's de
flating loss to USC last weekend.
Many of the other components of Big Game
week, such as the dyed fountains and collection
of Beat Cal banners, are traditions with decades
of history behind them. Though the look is sim
ilar, the banners hanging from Meyer Library
this year are of higher quality than years past.
"We used to make them by hand, but this
year we ordered them so it's a little more fancy,"
Allison said. "But essentially we keep most of
our traditions the same; we just tweak things."
Kozlowski noted that with Meyer Library
tentatively scheduled to be demolished next

year, the Axe Committee will have to find a new
location to hang their banners.
"That's going to be an interesting challenge
going forward —we have a few ideas but I
think it's largely dependent on the facility," Ko-

Beginning in 2012, the Axe Committee moved
the annual Big Game rally from Old Union to
Cobb Track and Angell Field, where the event
could incorporate a pyrotechnics display.
zlowski said. "The only option I would
say that is really as visible is Hoover Tow
er, but I don't know how feasible putting
[a banner] on Hoover Tower would be."

The Axe Committee's namesake re
sponsibility— protecting the Axe

takes on additional importance during Big
Game week.
Kozlowski said that the Axe is re
moved from its usual home in the Arrilla
ga Family Sports Center and taken to a
secret location for safekeeping. He would
not disclose where it was kept or how
many people knew the current location.
Allison said that when the Axe is

brought to various Big Game week events
such as the rally or Gaieties, the Axe
Committee takes special precautions to
protect it.
"When we have it, we have to be
physically chained to the Axe they'll
wrap like a tie around your waist, so that
if somebody wants to take the Axe they
literally have to take like three Axe
Comm members with them," Allison ex
plained.
Kozlowski said that this type of secu
rity is why no one has been able to steal
the Axe since the Axe Committee in its
current form was founded in 1983. Be
fore that, the Axe was protected by a va
riety of organizations, which led to a se
ries of thefts.

"We have not had anyone try to steal
it from us in a very long time but Cal

does come every year and we must as
sume that they are coming to attempt to
steal it and thus we must protect it," Al
lison said. "Even though they've never
managed to get anywhere near the Axe
because that's Cal and they can't fig
ure things out. "
As the week wraps to a close, the
Axe Committee turns its focus to the ac
tual Big Game, where the Axe can be
won and lost in earnest.

"It's a relationship between Cal and
Stanford that has been going strong for
the last 120 years," Kozlowski said.
"Even if we are rivals on the field, I think
we really want to celebrate both our
schools and each other."
