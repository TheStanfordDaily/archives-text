# Give 'em the Axe, then take it away
## The 						history of successful thefts of the rivalry icon 
### MOLLY VORWERCK MANAGING EDITOR 
Although the Axe is supposed to reside
with the winner of the most recent Big
Game, the prized weapon has changed
hands illegally eight times in the storied his
tory of the Stanford-Cal rivalry.
The Axe, the physical representation
of Stanford's collegiate rivalry with UC-
Berkeley, was first stolen by Cal students
on April 15, 1899, only a few days after the
emblem was introduced by Stanford yell
leaders during a baseball game between
the two schools.

Stanford students didn't attempt to
steal the Axe until 21 years later. In its April
5, 1930 issue, The Stanford Daily reported
that "while the Blue and Gold horde literal
ly slumbered on its feet last night, a band of
20 intrepid wearers of the Cardinal
whisked the precious implement from un
der the nose of the Berkleyans in whose
possession it had rested since that fatal day
in 1899."

Stanford students posing as photogra
phers at Berkeley's annual Axe Rally shot
tear gas into the eyes of unsuspecting Cal
students while other conspirators snatched
the Axe away from its carrier. That morning,
2,000 students rallied outside of Stanford's
main library in celebration of the deed and
the "Immortal 21," the group of 21 young
men who valiantly recaptured the Axe.
At 4 a.m. on Nov. 16, 1945, just 15
years after the Immortal 21 claimed glory,
two Cal students attempted to steal the
Axe from its comfortable location in the
Cellar, a popular diner on campus, sparking
a decade-long series of swipes. On that
same day, The Daily reported that "the two
... students, Hugh Wallace, 20, and Edwin
Burrell, 18, were caught by Officer Dan
Hickey after they forced their way into the
Cellar to get the Axe," and were immedi
ately arrested. After their attempt was

thwarted, the two troublemakers spent the
rest of Wednesday night and all Thursday in
the Palo Alto jail.
However, on April 29, 1946, embit
tered Cal students returned to the Cellar in
the hopes of snagging the coveted emblem
once and for all. According to an April 29,
1946 Daily article, "the thieves came into
the Cellar just before closing time. Only
student-worker Bill Steif was there, forced
into submission by threats of violence. Steif
described the husky robbers as "definitely
of college age." Two years later, the Axe
was mysteriously found on the Stanford
Golf Course, only to be detained by Stan
ford police and then returned to the East
Bay.

In a special summer issue published
on June 30, 1948, The Daily wrote that
"ASSU Summer President Don Davies and
[Police] Chief Davis returned the Axe to Cal
yesterday after negotiations for a peaceful
exchange were made by Dean of Students
Lawrence A. Kimpton. Director of Activi
ties Ed Welch, former ASUC student body
president, received the trophy for the East
bay peasants."
In 1953, the Axe went missing from
its case on Berkeley's campus for five
months until Big Game of that year. Cal re
cruited a team of its students to investigate
the missing axe, but their search into
Stanford fraternities, dormitories and other
institutions —warranted no results.

But on Nov. 24, 1953, the day of the
56th Big Game, the trophy was found. That

day's edition of The Daily reported that
"The old blade ... was discovered in the au
tomobile of Stanford football team captain
Norm Manoogian Saturday a few hours be
fore the Big Game began. Manoogian...
said he found the package containing the
Axe and an anonymous note."
Over 10 years passed before the Axe
changed hands illegally for the 7th time
when it was removed from its display case
in Stanford's student union on May 16,
1967. While many students initially did not
think Cal was responsible for the theft, by
game time the following academic year, Cal
confessed and returned the Axe if only
until it won the game a few hours later.
The eighth and final underhand swipe
occurred on Nov. 20, 1973, when the "In
famous Three," a group of two Stanford
Theta Delta Chi fraternity members and
one law student, concocted a masterful
plan to uproot the Axe from its spot in the
Cal Student Union by convincing the gen
eral manager of the Cal Student Union that
the Axe was needed for a press conference.
Since that time, there have been no
successful thefts and the Axe has ex
changed hands only when won on the foot
ball field. When Stanford has possession of
the Axe, it resides in a case in the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center, to be taken out only
under the careful protection of the Stan
ford Axe Committee.

tear gas into the eyes of unsuspecting Cal
students while other conspirators snatched
the Axe away from its carrier. That morning,
2,000 students rallied outside of Stanford's
main library in celebration of the deed and
the "Immortal 21," the group of 21 young
men who valiantly recaptured the Axe.
At 4 a.m. on Nov. 16, 1945, just 15
years after the Immortal 21 claimed glory,
two Cal students attempted to steal the
Axe from its comfortable location in the
Cellar, a popular diner on campus, sparking
a decade-long series of swipes. On that
same day, The Daily reported that "the two
... students, Hugh Wallace, 20, and Edwin
Burrell, 18, were caught by Officer Dan
Hickey after they forced their way into the
Cellar to get the Axe," and were immedi
ately arrested. After their attempt was

thwarted, the two troublemakers spent the
rest of Wednesday night and all Thursday in
the Palo Alto jail.
However, on April 29, 1946, embit
tered Cal students returned to the Cellar in
the hopes of snagging the coveted emblem
once and for all. According to an April 29,
1946 Daily article, "the thieves came into
the Cellar just before closing time. Only
student-worker Bill Steif was there, forced
into submission by threats of violence. Steif
described the husky robbers as "definitely
of college age." Two years later, the Axe
was mysteriously found on the Stanford
Golf Course, only to be detained by Stan
ford police and then returned to the East
Bay.

In a special summer issue published
on June 30, 1948, The Daily wrote that
"ASSU Summer President Don Davies and
[Police] Chief Davis returned the Axe to Cal
yesterday after negotiations for a peaceful
exchange were made by Dean of Students
Lawrence A. Kimpton. Director of Activi
ties Ed Welch, former ASUC student body
president, received the trophy for the East
bay peasants."
In 1953, the Axe went missing from
its case on Berkeley's campus for five
months until Big Game of that year. Cal re
cruited a team of its students to investigate
the missing axe, but their search into
Stanford fraternities, dormitories and other
institutions —warranted no results.

But on Nov. 24, 1953, the day of the
56th Big Game, the trophy was found. That

day's edition of The Daily reported that
"The old blade ... was discovered in the au
tomobile of Stanford football team captain
Norm Manoogian Saturday a few hours be
fore the Big Game began. Manoogian...
said he found the package containing the
Axe and an anonymous note."
Over 10 years passed before the Axe
changed hands illegally for the 7th time
when it was removed from its display case
in Stanford's student union on May 16,
1967. While many students initially did not
think Cal was responsible for the theft, by
game time the following academic year, Cal
confessed and returned the Axe if only
until it won the game a few hours later.
The eighth and final underhand swipe
occurred on Nov. 20, 1973, when the "In
famous Three," a group of two Stanford
Theta Delta Chi fraternity members and
one law student, concocted a masterful
plan to uproot the Axe from its spot in the
Cal Student Union by convincing the gen
eral manager of the Cal Student Union that
the Axe was needed for a press conference.
Since that time, there have been no
successful thefts and the Axe has ex
changed hands only when won on the foot
ball field. When Stanford has possession of
the Axe, it resides in a case in the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center, to be taken out only
under the careful protection of the Stan
ford Axe Committee.

Although the Axe is supposed to reside
with the winner of the most recent Big
Game, the prized weapon has changed
hands illegally eight times in the storied his
tory of the Stanford-Cal rivalry.
The Axe, the physical representation
of Stanford's collegiate rivalry with UC-
Berkeley, was first stolen by Cal students
on April 15, 1899, only a few days after the
emblem was introduced by Stanford yell
leaders during a baseball game between
the two schools.

Stanford students didn't attempt to
steal the Axe until 21 years later. In its April
5, 1930 issue, The Stanford Daily reported
that "while the Blue and Gold horde literal
ly slumbered on its feet last night, a band of
20 intrepid wearers of the Cardinal
whisked the precious implement from un
der the nose of the Berkleyans in whose
possession it had rested since that fatal day
in 1899."
