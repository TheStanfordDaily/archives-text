# Rivalry for a cause
## Stanford, Cal compete in Big Game week blood drive 
### CALEB SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No lives have been lost on account of the
historic Stanford-Cal rivalry, but with a Big Game
week blood drive, this traditional showdown may
save a few.

On Nov. 19, the Stanford Blood Center held
the seventh annual "Rivals for Life" blood drive as
part of a contest with Cal's blood bank to see
which university can get the larger amount of
blood donation this drive. Stanford has collected
more blood than Cal in each of the past five
years.

The "Rivals for Life" blood drive is one of the
largest annual drives at Stanford, according to
Stanford Blood Center communications special
ist Deanna Bolio. This year, it was held at the Ar
rillaga Center for Sports and Recreation between
11 a.m. and 7 p.m. and was expected to gather
between 200 and 300 units of blood. Last year's
drive at Stanford raised 266 pints of blood, and
between 2008 and 2012, the "Rivals for Life"
blood drive has raised 1,264 units of blood. A
unit is approximately the same as a pint.

Bolio said the Stanford Blood Center did not
have a specific target for this year's blood drive
but that its "goal is just to beat Cal."
For comparison purposes, the average Amer
ican can hold 10-12 pints of blood. Bolio said that
for an operation like a lung transplant, approxi
mately 60 or 70 units of blood would be needed.
According to the American Red Cross, 30 million
blood components are transfused in the United
States every year.
The Stanford Blood Center provides blood
to seven different hospitals in the Bay Area, but
the main recipient is Stanford Hospital.
For the "Rivals for Life" drive, the Stanford
Blood Center solicited donations from students,
faculty, staff and members of the local communi
ty. Donors had to meet certain health eligibility
conditions required for all blood drives.
