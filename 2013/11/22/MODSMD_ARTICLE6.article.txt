# Rivalry for a cause
## Stanford, Cal compete in Big Game week blood drive 
### CALEB SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No lives have been lost on account of the
historic Stanford-Cal rivalry, but with a Big Game
week blood drive, this traditional showdown may
save a few.

On Nov. 19, the Stanford Blood Center held
the seventh annual "Rivals for Life" blood drive as
part of a contest with Cal's blood bank to see
which university can get the larger amount of
blood donation this drive. Stanford has collected
more blood than Cal in each of the past five
years.

The "Rivals for Life" blood drive is one of the
largest annual drives at Stanford, according to
Stanford Blood Center communications special
ist Deanna Bolio. This year, it was held at the Ar
rillaga Center for Sports and Recreation between
11 a.m. and 7 p.m. and was expected to gather
between 200 and 300 units of blood. Last year's
drive at Stanford raised 266 pints of blood, and
between 2008 and 2012, the "Rivals for Life"
blood drive has raised 1,264 units of blood. A
unit is approximately the same as a pint.

Bolio said the Stanford Blood Center did not
have a specific target for this year's blood drive
but that its "goal is just to beat Cal."
For comparison purposes, the average Amer
ican can hold 10-12 pints of blood. Bolio said that
for an operation like a lung transplant, approxi
mately 60 or 70 units of blood would be needed.
According to the American Red Cross, 30 million
blood components are transfused in the United
States every year.
The Stanford Blood Center provides blood
to seven different hospitals in the Bay Area, but
the main recipient is Stanford Hospital.
For the "Rivals for Life" drive, the Stanford
Blood Center solicited donations from students,
faculty, staff and members of the local communi
ty. Donors had to meet certain health eligibility
conditions required for all blood drives.
At least 236 people made pre
appointments to donate blood at
the event, but the blood center also
accepted walk-in donors. Donors re
ceived free T-shirts and were en
tered into a raffle.

Donors with all blood types
were welcome, though there was a
particular need for type 0 negative
blood donors, as people with this
type are considered universal red
blood cell donors their blood can
be transfused into anyone. There
are four different major blood
groups: A, B, AB and 0, each of
which can be either negative or pos
itive based on protein markers on
blood cells. It is important for doc
tors to give patients the right type of
blood to avoid rejection.

The "Rivals for Life" drive was
set up in the basketball courts of the
Arrillaga Center for Sports and
Recreation, and the blood donation
process involved four phases: a
medical history, a mini-physical to
ensure that donors were healthy
enough to give blood, the donation
itself and snacks. While waiting,
blood donors could watch a mon
tage of Stanford football highlights
on a large television.
Holly Dayton 'l7 said she likes
helping people out by donating
blood.

"It makes me feel like I'm mak
ing a difference with something
I've got plenty of and somebody
else doesn't have enough of," said

Dayton.
"I think it's spectacular to see
young people donating blood," said
Stanford football's director of player
development Ron Lynn, who also
made a blood donation. Lynn
praised how young people were
aware of the need for people to do
nate blood.

For people interested in giving
blood who missed this blood
drive, the Stanford Blood Center
accepts donations throughout the
year. More information about up
coming drives can be found on its
website.
