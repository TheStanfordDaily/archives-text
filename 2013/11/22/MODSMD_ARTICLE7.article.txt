## Time for David Shaw to Adapt 
### AARON LEVINE '04 is the sports director for Q13 Fox in Seattle 
Let me be clear: I'm a David Shaw fan.
I believe in his leadership and his
ability to recruit. I love his quiet con
fidence and cerebral approach to the game
of football.

As a Stanford alum who endured
years of football irrelevance, I'm ecstatic
the Cardinal is now a perennial force. I'm
grateful for Shaw's contributions during
Stanford's rise to prominence and its cur
rent stability as a top-notch team.
But with national championships and
conference titles on the line, the margin
for error is now incredibly slim. And when
a game is in crunch time, I believe Shaw
needs to be a better coach.

While some fans say Shaw needs to
call different plays down the stretch, I'll be
more specific: Shaw needs to call the high
er percentage plays.
Twice this season, Shaw deprived the
Cardinal of its best opportunity to win

by abandoning its true identity. In game
defining drives at Utah and USC, Shaw
needed to run the football... and failed.
Shaw defended his calls: "Sometimes
things work, sometimes they don't. If you
want to win games, they've gotta work
more often than they don't."
But if Shaw wants to win, he has to
call the plays that work most often. In

short-yardage situations, power and varia
tions of power have been Stanford's best
and most effective options.
We know it. Our opponents know it
and they've consistently failed to stop
it. Just ask Oregon.
And yet, in Stanford's losses, Shaw
the cerebral coach has failed to play the
percentages.

Against Utah, facing a 3rd-and-2 at
the Utes 6-yard line with a timeout left,
Stanford abandoned the run the higher
percentage play passing up an easier
opportunity at a first down, which would
have earned four more chances at a game
winning touchdown.
Against USC, facing a 2nd-and-2 on a
potential game-winning drive, Stanford
abandoned the run the higher percent
age play to keep the drive alive and in
stead, Kevin Hogan threw an interception.

I was relieved when Shaw finally took
the blame for a play call in the redzone at
USC. But I was incredulous when I heard
him say this week that play calling is often
left up to chance. If that were true, we'd
be flipping coins before every down.
There's obviously a reason Shaw
wants to call plays when a game is on the
line. But before he continues to do so, he
must take a look in the mirror and im
prove: He must have the ability to recog
nize the highest percentage play, given the
time and situation of a game. He must
have a keener recognition of the flow of a
game.

Listen, David Shaw is going to be at
Stanford for a long time. I wholeheartedly
support his tenure there and look forward
to watching the Cardinal win future Rose
Bowls and maybe even a national title.
But like his players, Shaw needs to
continue to strive to be better. He cannot
forget to embrace the Stanford football
identity down the stretch and be sure
to call the plays with the absolute highest
rate of success.

David Shaw has the power. Now he
just has to run it too.

He must have the ability to
