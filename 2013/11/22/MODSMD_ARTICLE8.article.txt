## Letter to the Editor Keep Big Game Respectful 
### 
On Nov. 23, Stanford and Cal will square
off in the 116 th annual Big Game at Stan
ford Stadium, an event that has been a
Bay Area tradition. Our two universities share a
strong football and academic heritage, as well as
a spirited and storied rivalry.

It is important that the traditional goal of the
Big Game be reinforced this year: a spirited com
petition on the field and an enjoyable experience
for those in the stands. Unfortunately, in past
years, the spirit of Big Game has been dampened
by the irresponsible behavior of some that result
ed in fracas and property damage.
We again ask this year that you refrain from
engaging in "pranks" and other activities that
may draw law enforcement and security person
nel and resources away from responding to more
pressing matters.

We feel that those attending the Big Game
should not have to fear for their safety; there
fore, we must emphasize that fans who engage
in incidents of field trespass, physical assault
and/or property damage will be ejected from the
stadium.

Students found responsible for these types
of activities will face disciplinary action at their
respective institutions; such action may include
suspension or dismissal.

Please respect more than a century of Big
Game tradition and celebrate your school spirit,
pride and sportsmanship in a safe, positive and
friendly manner. Enjoy the game!

With warm regards,

NICHOLAS B. DIRKS
Chancellor of the University of California,
Berkeley
JOHN L. HENNESSY
President of Stanford University
