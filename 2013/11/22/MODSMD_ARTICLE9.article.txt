## CARD HEAVY FAVORITE FOR 116TH BIG GAME 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
It's that time of year again.
Three blasts from the train whistle
pierce the chilly Stanford air at the top of
every hour. The water in the school's nor
mally picturesque fountains is replaced by
a sinister cardinal red brew. At the apex of
The Claw sits a lone teddy bear, brutally im
paled by the topmost spike in full view of
students sporting "Beat Cal" shirts in in
creasing numbers.

That can only mean one thing: It's
time for Big Game.
When the 116 th installment of the
cross-Bay rivalry takes place on Saturday at
Stanford Stadium between the No. 9 Stan
ford Cardinal (8-2, 6-2 Pac-12) and the Cal
ifornia Golden Bears (1-10, 0-8), all of the
animosity between the two archrival
schools will come to a head on the field as
the Cardinal will look to keep its strangle
hold on the Stanford Axe for the fourth
consecutive year.
"You show up here, and you're not

supposed to like [Cal]," said senior wide re
ceiver Jeff Trojan. "Seeing the environment
and seeing the interaction of our players
and their players throughout the years and
seeing how everything goes they don't
act kindly to you, you don't act kindly to
them, and then once you're a senior you
don't like them because of that."

Stanford will be looking to rebound
from one of its toughest losses in recent
memory to a resurgent USC team at the

Coliseum that was marred by poor execution
and missed opportunities on offense. The na
tion's 120th-ranked defense allowing an
eye-popping 523 yards per game due in large
part to the statistically worst secondary in
the FBS is likely just what junior quarter
back Kevin Flogan needs to get back on track
and reestablish his command of the passing
game.

Senior defensive tackle David Parry insist
ed that the Cardinal would still enter Satur
day's game hungry and motivated against a
Cal team that many of Stanford's players be
lieve is better than its record indicates.

"I think that last Saturday against USC is
just enough motivation on its own," Parry
said. "[The Bears are] a much better team than
their record shows. We have no room to let off
and take it easy on anyone."
"They've got really good skill positions,"
added head coach David Shaw. "Say whatever
you want about their record, but they've got
good receivers, they've got good backs,
they've got speed and athleticism, they've got
an outstanding young quarterback, so they
can put points up if you're not ready for
them."

For Cal, Big Game is the final stop in one
of the most forgettable seasons in the storied
program's history. The necessity to adjust to a
new system with a true freshman quarterback
under first-year head coach Sonny Dykes has
proved overwhelming to the Golden Bears,
whose lone victory came against Portland
State a middling FCS team that led as late
as the third quarter before Cal pushed back
late to eke out a one-score victory.
Since then, everything has gone downhill
for the Bears. Cal will skid into Saturday's
matchup on a nine-game tailspin, with its fu
tility emphasized last week by a demoralizing
17-point loss to lowly Colorado.
Although true freshman quarterback
Jared Goff has put up solid numbers through
the air in his first collegiate season, his weak
offensive line has crippled his ability to take
control of games. The Bears rank near the bot
tom of the country in both rushing offense
and sacks allowed. Because of this, Goff has
been forced to attack through the air early and
often in a fast-paced offense with limited suc
cess due to the one-dimensionality of the of
fense's capabilities.
"[Defensive coordinator Derek] Mason
warned [the defense] that they're going to
have a lot of plays this game," said junior cor
nerback Wayne Lyons. "We thought that
we're going to have a good rotation going with
all of the defensive backs getting a lot of reps

in. Everyone is going to get an opportunity to
cover."

If Lyons and the Cardinal secondary can
play tight coverage throughout the game and
limit Goff's opportunities to do damage
through the air, Stanford's defense should eas
ily win the battle against the Cal offense.
Coming off of a tough matchup against one of
the most skilled receiving duos in the country
in USC's Marqise Lee and Nelson Agholor,
Stanford's secondary should be battle-tested
and ready to take on the Golden Bear re
ceivers.

Meanwhile, Cal's inability to match up
with Stanford on both lines will mean that
both the Cardinal's front seven and run game
should be expected to put up big numbers.
Fifth-year senior outside linebacker Trent
Murphy leads the nation in sacks and has
been lethal coming from the outside for Stan
ford's defense. He and fifth-year senior inside
linebacker Shayne Skov will be looking to put
pressure on Goff all afternoon against a bat
tered offensive line that has failed in keeping
Goff's jersey clean all season. On the other

side of the ball, the Cardinal offensive line
should have little trouble opening holes for

senior tailback Tyler Gaffney and the remain
der of Stanford's running back corps.
While experts, fans and odds-makers alike
around the country expect Stanford to run all
over the Bears the Cardinal opened as 31-
point favorites Stanford doesn't expect the
Bears to roll over.

"We know they're going to give us their
best shot; they always do," Trojan said. "It's a
rivalry game; anything can happen."
But all of the animosity that Cal will carry
onto the field on Saturday in its quest to re
claim the Stanford Axe will be matched by the
Cardinal, which will be fueled by the presence
of one of its hated rivals and a desire to exor
cise the demons from a tough loss to another.
"They stole our Axe [in the past]," Trojan
said. "It's our Axe. They come in and try to
take our Axe, so I don't like them for that. If
you try to take something that's mine, I'm not
going to like you."

Kickoff at Stanford Stadium is set for 1
p.m. on Saturday, with television coverage on
Fox Sports 1.
