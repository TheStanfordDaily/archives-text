# TALE of the TAPE
## Providing an answer to why the Bear Raid has failed to live up to the hype 
### Sean Wagner-McGough Senior Staff swagnermcgough@dailycal. org 
Sitting in a restaurant 25
minutes south of Boulder,
Colo the location of Cal's
most recent Pac-12 debacle the
waiter took notice of my California
license. Upon discovering I was
in town to cover Cal's impend
ing matchup with Colorado, the
northern California native asked
what I thought of Cal's one-win
season. After I tried my best to ex
plain Cal's ineptitude, the waiter
offered his assessment: At least
quarterback Jared Goff is good.
Using total passing yards, the
waiter was arguing that Goff was
in the midst of a great season. Not
wanting to disagree, I nodded my
head, then preceded to order.
It wasn't really difficult to fol
low the waiter's reasoning. Good
quarterbacks usually throw for
a lot of yards. And by looking at
some of GofF's season statistics, it's
not out of the realm of possibility
to be tricked into thinking he's had
a great year. He ranks eighth in to
tal passing yards and fifth in com
pletions. Not too shabby, right?
The truth is, Goff hasn't been
good this season. His completions
and passing yards are inflated
simply due to the fact that he's
thrown the second-most passes in
the country. Looking at the stats
that matter, Goff is tied for 57th in
completion percentage and 83rd
in yards per attempt. Yikes.

But the blame for Cal's offense
should not be cast solely on Goff.
He's been bad, but at the same
time, so has the rest of the offense.
Remember how giddy all of
Berkeley was feeling after the de
but of coach Sonny Dykes' Bear

Raid against Northwestern? It's
hard to believe, but that was only
three months ago. By now, that
giddiness has been replaced by
a feeling of doom every time the
olfense takes the field. Today,
fans left and right arc calling for
Dykes' head. They're pining for
Zach Kline's rifle to replace GofF's
noodle.
So where should the blame for
Cal's offensive ineptitude rest?
It's a question lacking a clear-cut
answer. So many facets of the of
fense have been atrocious. Dykes
and offensive coordinator Tony
Franklin deserve blame for their
suspect play-calling, Goff for his
decision-making and his lacklus
ter downfield passing, and, lastly,
the offensive line for its inability to
open up running lanes or provide
a clean pocket for Goff.
It's with the offensive line that
I'll start my assessment. With that,
let's go to the tape.
Trailing 41-17 with about three
minutes left in the game
against the Buffs last Saturday, Cal
comes out in the shotgun forma
tion with two receivers on the right
and two receivers on the left. Cal's
receivers' routes are irrelevant be
cause Goff is given no time in the
pocket to find an open receiver.
Brendan Bigelow is lined up to
GofF's left, and the ball is placed at
Colorado's 37-yard line.
The ball is snapped to Goff,
which is pretty much the only as
pect of the play Cal's offensive line
manages to get right. After faking
a handoff to Bigelow, Goff is im
mediately under pressure from de
fensive lineman Tyler Henington.
Goff manages to elude Henington's
pass rush, but after giving his best
Johnny Football impression zig
ging to the left, zagging to the right,
then dancing back to the left he

is inevitably brought down by de
fensive lineman Samson Kafovalu.

Although Kafovalu is credited
with the sack, it is Henington who
blows up the play. Still, it's hard to
even give praise to Henington, be
cause all he does on the play is run
straight, overpower an undersized
Bigelow and then chase after Golf.
The sack occurs strictly be
cause Cal's right guard, Alejandro
Crosthwaite the man directly
responsible for blocking Hening
ton decides to pull on the play
for reasons unknown. Instead of
staying in to pass-protect, he jet
tisons out of his stance and sprints
with authority to the left side of the
line. When he reaches the left side
of the line, he realizes something is
wrong: He has no one to block. His
head swivels around back toward
Gotf, who is now in full escape
mode. From there, Crosthwaite can
only stop and stare as Goff is even
tually crushed by Kafovalu.
And although left tackle Chris
tian Okafor's man is responsible
for flushing Gotf out to the left for
the second time, his poor body po
sitioning is only an issue after five
seconds of pass protecting.
It's play that accurately sums up
Cal's offensive line play this season
inexperience blended with poor
execution.
But Cal's offensive line can't be
blamed for all of the offense's
struggles. Against the Buffs, the
offensive line played one of its
best games as far as running the
ball goes. Despite Cal's success
running the ball its running
backs averaged more than seven
yards per carry Dykes and
Franklin still called for 61 pass
ing plays (factoring in Goff and
Kline's sacks and scrambles) and
only 25 designed runs. Suspect
play-calling? Check.
Meanwhile, Goff's limita
tions were evident pretty much
on every deep ball he attempted.
Granted, the wind was howling,

but even Dykes said after the
game that he felt Goff had receiv
ers open all night. Long gone are
the beautiful throws that would
make their way into the waiting
arms of Chris Harper 40 yards
down the field.

It can be argued that Goff's
accuracy has declined because
of the weather. As the frequency
of inclement weather increased,
Goff's play worsened. He had to
be pulled against Oregon because
he couldn't hold on to the football
in the torrential downpour. That
problem reared its ugly head
again against Oregon State, when
he flat-out dropped the ball as he
cocked his arm.
An argument can also be made
that Goff's accuracy has declined
because of his offensive line's play.
With just one game remaining,
Cal surrenders about three sacks
per game. Typically, as a quarter
back continues to get hit more
and more over the course of a sea
son, his eye level shifts. Instead of
looking downfield at the coverage
and his receivers, a quarterback is
looking at 300-pound defensive
linemen intent on annihilating

the man with the football.
I don't know why Golf hasn't
played as well as he did at the
onset of the season. Maybe his
first couple of games were a fluke
a false signal in a sea of noise.
Maybe it's his offensive line. Or
maybe it's his coaches calling for
pass play after pass play, putting
all the pressure on the arm of a
true freshman. Just as with the
Bear Raid as a whole, there are
multiple factors that have played
into Goff's subpar play.
It's hard to play quarterback
well when the offensive line re
sembles the Titanic. And it's hard
to have a good offense when the
quarterback is playing poorly.
It's hard on both the line and the
quarterback when coaches stop
calling run plays despite averag
ing more than seven yards per
carry.

My point being Cal's offense
doesn't stink just because of Goff
or because of the offensive line
or the coaches. An offense is de
pendent on the coaches and all 11
players doing their jobs. The Bear
Raid stinks because that hasn't
happened this season. â–

in the midst of a great season. Not
wanting to disagree, I nodded my
head, then preceded to order.
It wasn't really difficult to fol
low the waiter's reasoning. Good
quarterbacks usually throw for
a lot of yards. And by looking at
some of GofF's season statistics, it's
not out of the realm of possibility
to be tricked into thinking he's had
a great year. He ranks eighth in to
tal passing yards and fifth in com
pletions. Not too shabby, right?
The truth is, Goff hasn't been
good this season. His completions
and passing yards are inflated
simply due to the fact that he's
thrown the second-most passes in
the country. Looking at the stats
that matter, Goff is tied for 57th in
completion percentage and 83rd
in yards per attempt. Yikes.

But the blame for Cal's offense
should not be cast solely on Goff.
He's been bad, but at the same
time, so has the rest of the offense.
Remember how giddy all of
Berkeley was feeling after the de
but of coach Sonny Dykes' Bear

Raid against Northwestern? It's
hard to believe, but that was only
three months ago. By now, that
giddiness has been replaced by
a feeling of doom every time the
olfense takes the field. Today,
fans left and right arc calling for
Dykes' head. They're pining for
Zach Kline's rifle to replace GofF's
noodle.
So where should the blame for
Cal's offensive ineptitude rest?
It's a question lacking a clear-cut
answer. So many facets of the of
fense have been atrocious. Dykes
and offensive coordinator Tony
Franklin deserve blame for their
suspect play-calling, Goff for his
decision-making and his lacklus
ter downfield passing, and, lastly,
the offensive line for its inability to
open up running lanes or provide
a clean pocket for Goff.
It's with the offensive line that
I'll start my assessment. With that,
let's go to the tape.
Trailing 41-17 with about three
minutes left in the game
against the Buffs last Saturday, Cal
comes out in the shotgun forma
tion with two receivers on the right
and two receivers on the left. Cal's
receivers' routes are irrelevant be
cause Goff is given no time in the
pocket to find an open receiver.
Brendan Bigelow is lined up to
GofF's left, and the ball is placed at
Colorado's 37-yard line.
The ball is snapped to Goff,
which is pretty much the only as
pect of the play Cal's offensive line
manages to get right. After faking
a handoff to Bigelow, Goff is im
mediately under pressure from de
fensive lineman Tyler Henington.
Goff manages to elude Henington's
pass rush, but after giving his best
Johnny Football impression zig
ging to the left, zagging to the right,
then dancing back to the left he

is inevitably brought down by de
fensive lineman Samson Kafovalu.

Although Kafovalu is credited
with the sack, it is Henington who
blows up the play. Still, it's hard to
even give praise to Henington, be
cause all he does on the play is run
straight, overpower an undersized
Bigelow and then chase after Golf.
The sack occurs strictly be
cause Cal's right guard, Alejandro
Crosthwaite the man directly
responsible for blocking Hening
ton decides to pull on the play
for reasons unknown. Instead of
staying in to pass-protect, he jet
tisons out of his stance and sprints
with authority to the left side of the
line. When he reaches the left side
of the line, he realizes something is
wrong: He has no one to block. His
head swivels around back toward
Gotf, who is now in full escape
mode. From there, Crosthwaite can
only stop and stare as Goff is even
tually crushed by Kafovalu.
And although left tackle Chris
tian Okafor's man is responsible
for flushing Gotf out to the left for
the second time, his poor body po
sitioning is only an issue after five
seconds of pass protecting.
It's play that accurately sums up
Cal's offensive line play this season
inexperience blended with poor
execution.
But Cal's offensive line can't be
blamed for all of the offense's
struggles. Against the Buffs, the
offensive line played one of its
best games as far as running the
ball goes. Despite Cal's success
running the ball its running
backs averaged more than seven
yards per carry Dykes and
Franklin still called for 61 pass
ing plays (factoring in Goff and
Kline's sacks and scrambles) and
only 25 designed runs. Suspect
play-calling? Check.
Meanwhile, Goff's limita
tions were evident pretty much
on every deep ball he attempted.
Granted, the wind was howling,

but even Dykes said after the
game that he felt Goff had receiv
ers open all night. Long gone are
the beautiful throws that would
make their way into the waiting
arms of Chris Harper 40 yards
down the field.

It can be argued that Goff's
accuracy has declined because
of the weather. As the frequency
of inclement weather increased,
Goff's play worsened. He had to
be pulled against Oregon because
he couldn't hold on to the football
in the torrential downpour. That
problem reared its ugly head
again against Oregon State, when
he flat-out dropped the ball as he
cocked his arm.
An argument can also be made
that Goff's accuracy has declined
because of his offensive line's play.
With just one game remaining,
Cal surrenders about three sacks
per game. Typically, as a quarter
back continues to get hit more
and more over the course of a sea
son, his eye level shifts. Instead of
looking downfield at the coverage
and his receivers, a quarterback is
looking at 300-pound defensive
linemen intent on annihilating

the man with the football.
I don't know why Golf hasn't
played as well as he did at the
onset of the season. Maybe his
first couple of games were a fluke
a false signal in a sea of noise.
Maybe it's his offensive line. Or
maybe it's his coaches calling for
pass play after pass play, putting
all the pressure on the arm of a
true freshman. Just as with the
Bear Raid as a whole, there are
multiple factors that have played
into Goff's subpar play.
It's hard to play quarterback
well when the offensive line re
sembles the Titanic. And it's hard
to have a good offense when the
quarterback is playing poorly.
It's hard on both the line and the
quarterback when coaches stop
calling run plays despite averag
ing more than seven yards per
carry.

My point being Cal's offense
doesn't stink just because of Goff
or because of the offensive line
or the coaches. An offense is de
pendent on the coaches and all 11
players doing their jobs. The Bear
Raid stinks because that hasn't
happened this season. â–
