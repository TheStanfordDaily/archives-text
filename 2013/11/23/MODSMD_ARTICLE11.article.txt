# Monsters await Bears
## No. 9 Stanford hosts Bears in 116th edition of the Big Game 
### Michael Rosen Senior Staff mrosen@dailycal. org 
Stanford, that hulk
ing monstrosity of a
football team capable of
ripping people's heads
off in a single bite, lurks
at the final stop of Cal
football's long road to
ward misery.
It's the 116 th Big
Game, but nobody ex
pects anything "big"
besides the final scoring
margin.
"We need a little bit
of magic," said line
backer Michael Bar
ton. "In games like this,
something spectacular
always happens. If the
ball rolls our way a few
times, we'll be all right
as long as we play sound
football."
Magic aside, the
Bears stand no chance
in their 1 p.m. Satur
day contest at Stanford
Stadium. The Cardinal
front seven are not ge
netically engineered,
per se, to prey on woe
ful offensive lines, but
they might as well be.
While their flurry of
ferociously athletic wil
debeests eviscerates the
young Bear cubs on the
offensive line, Cal quar
terback Jared Goff will
run for his life, striv
ing in vain to identify
his receivers. He will
fail, and he will fail of
ten. Stanford cannot be
stopped, only tempo
rarily satiated. In the
end, the beast always

gets what it wants.
Its two outside line
backers lead the as
sault. Trent Murphy, in
particular, inflicts his
physical dominance on
opposing lines, leading
the FBS in sacks with
12 and tackles for loss
with 18.5. Cal's tack
les, in particular, have
struggled with keep
ing the edge rushers
out of the backfield. At
this point in the season,
Goff is doing his utmost
to avoid collapsing like
a piece of papier-mache
at midfield. Over the
past two weeks, the of
fensive linemen haven't
helped his cause much.
After a blistering
start to the season,
Goff has fallen like the
protagonist in a Shake
spearean tragedy. His
performance bounces
erratically from game
to game. Against a stel
lar USC front, he posted
a sparkling 71.4 percent

completion rate; one
week later, against a po
rous Colorado defense,
his stats nosedived,
compiling an anemic
3.8 yards per comple
tion. Considering the
context, such a perfor
mance ranks among the
worst turned in by an
FBS quarterback on the
year one almost wor
thy of a benching.
"No one really thinks
we have a chance. That's
not what we think in
side our team," Goff
said. "We have nothing
to lose. We're just going
to go in there and fight
our (butt) off."
A quality running
game might relieve
some pressure from the
embattled freshman
signal-caller. Light
ning-quick sophomore
back Brendan Bigelow
finally found a reason
to pick up some confi
dence after a 15-carry,
107-yard performance

against the Buffaloes.
Replicating that per
formance however
unlikely will finally
open up the play-action
section of the playbook
that has been conspicu
ously absent from the
offensive attack.

But like throwing
pebbles into a tidal
wave, an emphasis on
the run game will have,
at best, a minor effect.
Stanford is angry and
riled up after dropping
out of national title
contention with a loss
to USC. It's foolish to
assume the Cardinal
will do anything but
feast on some easy Bear
prey.

"It's kinda been the
perfect storm, where we
haven't got any breaks,"
said head coach Sonny
Dykes. "Good football
teams always make
their breaks. Right now,
we're not a really good
football team." â– 


MICHAEL TAO/FILE
The Big Game offers little hope for Sonny Dykes' squad. Cal is coming off a loss to Colorado
that cemented its status as the worst team in the Pac- 12, while Stanford is a dominant force.
