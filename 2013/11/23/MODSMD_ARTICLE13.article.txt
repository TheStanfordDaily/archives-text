# NOT YOUR AVERAGE JOE
## Joey Mahalic is both a freshman and the oldest player on the Bears

Joey Mahalic knew
there was no way his
parents would go for
it, but he at least had to try.
After signing with the
Cleveland Indians for a six
figure signing bonus, Ma
halic had money to blow.
His friend — Boston Red
Sox centerfielder and fel
low Oregon native Jacoby
IEllsbury — offered the re
cent high school graduate
his used $70,000 Cadil
lac Escalade.
"He said, 'Hey, I don't
want this car, I shouldn't
have gotten it,' " Mahalic
says. "I remember going
home and telling my par
ents. They said, 'You're 18
years old. You're not driv
ing a Cadillac.'"
"I thought it was a little
bit over the top," says his
father, Drew.
The Cadillac repre
sented the whirlwind 12
months for the young
pitcher. Thanks to a break
out performance at a na
tional baseball camp in the
summer before his senior
year, Mahalic — also re
ceiving attention from Pac
12 programs as a college
quarterback — rose
above the milieu of
high-school pros
pects to become

a top player in the 2007
draft.
At 18, Mahalic opted for
a professional career over
the allure of college life.
Too tantalizing were those
big-league bright lights
lurking so certainly on the
horizon.
"It was an agonizing de
cision," Drew Mahalic says.
"It wasn't a fun choice."
Six years later, 24-year
old redshirt freshman
quarterback Joey Ma
halic finds himself on the
Cal football sidelines, still
contemplating just how
he went from Cadillacs
to dining commons. He's
humbled, his father says.
But it allows him to under
stand the nuances of being
an athlete in ways unique
to those fortunate enough
to play two sports at a high
level.
"I'll talk them through
(bad plays) and tell (the
other quarterbacks) how
to respond to failure," Ma
halic says. "You come in as
an 18-year old with a full
scholarship. They've been
so good that they've never
dealt with failure before. I
had to deal with failure at
18 years old, by myself, in
the middle of nowhere. I
just try to help as much as
I can."
It feels like an eternity
ago, but his own experi
ences as an impressionable
teenager are as vivid as yes-

terday.
He joined the rookie
ball team in Winter Haven,
Fla., shortly after signing
in 2007. There, he met his
best friend, current Tampa
Bay Ray Chris Archer.
In those small southern
towns, there really wasn't
much for them to do except
pick up girls.
"We'd be sitting in the
bullpen, and we'd just look
around and try to see a girl
that looked good," Mahalic
says. "We'd go say hi and
ask them if they could show
us around and give us the
tour. There's a lot of towns
where you could do that.
Nothing wrong with mak
ing friends with people."
The Indians organiza
tion took a liking to the
young right-hander as he
compiled further atten
tion and accolades after a
stellar 2008 campaign in
low-A ball. Archer recalls
Mahalic's commitment to
excellence.
"I was floating around,"
Archer says. "We trained
together, and Joey really
taught me a lot about how
to train and prepare for a
baseball season. I followed
it up with the best season
of my career; it was partly
because of the things he in
stilled in me."
In spring training the
next year, Mahalic would
head to the clubs with Los
Angeles Angels outfielder
Torii Hunter and Philadel
phia Eagles quarterback
Donovan McNabb.
"It was crazy to be ex

posed to that lifestyle at
such a young age," Mahalic
says. "They'd take me to
dinner, be spending thou
sand of bucks a night like
it was nothing. They'd say,
'OK, we're gonna try to
keep it under a couple G's
tonight.'"
The good times didn't
last. An elbow injury de
railed a promising 2009
campaign that saw Mahalic
move his way up to high-A.
He pitched through the
pain, fearful that manage
ment would knock him off
his rapid path toward the
big leagues.
Eventually, the in
jury became too much to
handle. The team shipped
Mahalic to its rehab cen
ter in Arizona, where he
spent the remainder of the
season. Just like that, the
shine had worn off. His ca
reer was never the same.
"I hate to say it, but I
just kind of just got forgot
ten," Mahalic says.
Two seasons went by,
and not much changed.
The organization shook
him around, converting
him to a reliever and then
a starter. In 2011, spring
training rolled around, and
Mahalic felt he was pitch
ing better than ever. The
team didn't agree — on
the last day of camp, Ma
halic was cut. With every
other team's minor-league
rosters already finalized,
he was unable to secure a
spot.
"If it wasn't for that el
bow injury, he would be

still pitching in the major
leagues today," Archer says.
"On work ethic alone."
It is hard 1 to imagine a
situation in which Joey
Mahalic takes a snap in a
Cal football uniform. He's a
24-year old walk-on fresh
man. Jared Goff — in the
same academic year as Ma
halic — isn't going anywhere
soon. But that won't stop
him from making his mark
on the Cal football program.
When backup quarterback
Zach Kline exited the Wash
ington State game after a
disappointing performance,
Mahalic was there with an
encouraging word.
"I didn't do particularly as
well as I might've wanted to,"
Kline says. "(Mahalic) was
right there to say, 'Hey, don't
worry about it.' It's just the
little things he does. When
Joe talks, you listen."

into the recesses of his mem
ory. There are no regrets.
The lessons learned on his
journey are felt in different
ways — just as Archer owes
a part of his success to him,
someday his fellow Bears
may, too.
"You know how certain
people just have an aura
about them that you can just
notice? That's something
that he has," Drew Mahalic
says. "He's the residue of all
of those different
experiences." ■
