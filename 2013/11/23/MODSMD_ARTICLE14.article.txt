# At least make the losing fun
## 
### Connor Byrne cbyrne@dailycol. org 
In my 16 or so years of
following Cal football,
I can't ever remem
ber feeling this apathetic
about a Big Game.
And I don't think my
sentiment is unique. With
Cal sitting at 1-10 and set
to bring its surprisingly
pedestrian offense, accom
panied by the worst sta
tistical defense in school
history, to Palo Alto to face
off with a bigger, stronger
and deeper Stanford team,
you'd be hard-pressed
to find anyone with any
legitimate expectations
heading into Saturday's
contest.
In all likelihood, Cal
is going to lose, and lose
badly at that.
While Stanford will
be fighting to improve its
resume in hopes snag
ging the last BCS at-large
berth, the Cal football
team has absolutely noth
ing to play for save
pride. But that also means
it has nothing to lose.
So for the first time this
season, Cal needs to play
like it.
On offense, the Bears
need to start taking risks.
Despite the team's in
sistence on them, quick

screens and underneath
passes haven't been at all
effective this year, which
is a fact that isn't going to
magically change Satur
day. The Bears don't seem
to understand how to
utilize downfield block
ing, which has made their
penchant for short passes
and screens an exercise
in futility. Instead, Cal

needs to throw the ball
downfield and let its trio
of wide receivers the
clear strength of the team
have a shot at making
some plays.
If it doesn't work out,
who cares? You were

likely going to lose any
way. At least try to make

it fun to watch.
The defense is likely
going to give up more
than 40 points. That
might seem like an overly
pessimistic number to
throw out, but when you
consider the squad has
held only three oppo
nents to less than that
amount and none
under the 30-point mark
it seems pretty safe.
The straight-ahead 4-3
has not worked, and it will
continue not to work. So
change it up. Blitz every
down. Send safeties and
corners on every play. Do
something crazy.
It'll probably lead to a
handful of big plays and
another lopsided final
score. But so will the
business-as-usual game
plan. So take a few risks
just to see what happens.
Jeff Tedford's biggest
crime in his final years at
Cal wasn't that he started
losing games or failed to
graduate his players. It

was that his teams be-

came boring and painful
to watch.

Sonny Dykes' team
has done the same in the
past few weeks, relying
on overly safe and bor
ing offensive plays while
showing an unwillingness
to take any sort of risks
on defense.

His team is going to
lose Saturday, and it's go
ing to lose badly. But that
doesn't mean it needs to
be boring.
When Dykes came to
Cal, he seemed to pride
himself on being an offen
sive mastermind whose
offense would constantly
be exciting and efficient.
It's been neither in 2013.
He has one more
chance to change the per
ception of how his open
ing season will be viewed.
And while it seems like
that last hurrah will be
a loss, it doesn't have to
be a boring one. For his
sake, it can't be. ■
