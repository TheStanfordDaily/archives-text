# GO WITH THE FLOW
## Despite being the No. 2 QB on the depth chart, Zach Kline keeps it cool 
### Annie Gerlach | Senior Staff agerlach@dailycal. org 
About two and a half
hours prior to kickoff at
each home game, cheers
and fight songs bombard the Cal
football team on Piedmont Av
enue as it makes its way toward
Memorial Stadium. The tradi
tion is called March to Victory.
Zach Kline has his own tradi
tion. Tuning out the rest of the
world, he lets the opening rilf
of "Black Thumbnail" by Kings
of Leon fill his head before his
team leaves the bus. "Such a

sweet song," he says.
More often than not, pump
ing himself up before a game
means staying in that state of
mind for the entire game. Get
ting into the zone isn't a first
step that gives way to an adrena
line rush on the field.
On most Saturdays, it's the
only step. Kline has to cling to
that pregame emotion even as
the quarters wind down. Just in
case the coaches decide to sub
him in. As the No. 2 quarter
back on the team, Kline rarely
sees playing time. Between the
lines of "Black Thumbnail," he
dials into the emotions that
other teammates will harness
throughout the next 60 min
utes. He stays vigilant as some
one ahead of him calls the shots.
For Kline to do so wasn't
part of anybody's original plan.
When he came to UC Berke
ley in spring 2012, he was Cal's

great hope. But a quarterback
race in this past offseason left
him on the sideline for the sec
ond year in a row.
His position on the team
could be seen as anticlimactic.
Or it could be seen as a vital, if
less visible, cog in Cal's machine.
Kline sees it as the latter.
Before the quarterback com
petition, there was some
thing simpler: Zach, his father
and the park.
Scott Kline used to take his
8-year-old son to a nearby park
year-round in Danville, Calif., to
play football and baseball. That
same year, Zach joined his first
Pop Warner team.
Scott taught his son a simple
three-step drop in the hopes it
would get Zach noticed in prac
tice. It did: That first year, Zach
switched from linebacker to
backup quarterback.
From then on, at the be

ginning of every new season,
coaches would ask which play
ers wanted to try out for quar
terback. After a while, it served
little more than symbolic pur
pose; Kline always won the
starting slot.
"Fifty hands would go up,"
says Lisa, Zach's mother. "There
was always a competition, and
he beat them out."
Performing on the field came
naturally and brought with it
plenty of attention. Adults con
stantly told him he would have a
career in college, in the pros.
So one day at the park, Scott
Kline imparted some advice his
young son never shook off. If you
ever get the chance to play in
college, he told Zach, and Cal or
Stanford comes calling, just say
yes. There are no better schools.
Kline grew up attending
games and camps in Memorial
Stadium, so dreams of playing

there came easily.
"I was all Cal," he says. He
loved it, plain and simple.
After the first game of his
junior year of high school,
Kline committed to the
Bears — and spent the next
year and a half recruiting
others on Cal's behalf.
Kline was the crown
jewel of Jeff Tedford's 2012
Signing Day class, and he
literally could not wait to
come to Berkeley. In Febra
aiy 2012, while the rest of
his class waffled over last
minute decisions, Kline was
already living in the Clark
Kerr dorms after graduating
from high school early.
At that year's intra-squad
spring game, Cal unveiled
Kline. The freshman com
pleted a game-winning
two-point-conversion pass
to Jackson Bouza and solidi
fied his identity as Cal's next
big thing.
During his redshirt year
in 2012, he never grew im
patient. Cal was the dream,
after all. He was playing un
der a coach he had admired
throughout his career in a
stadium he'd known since
childhood.
"I was thankful even to
have the cleats on," Kline
says. "It's so easy for a fresh
man to get hated, and I did
not want to go down that
road. I just did what they
told me to do, and I was
thankful eveiy moment."
Observing from the side
line would pay off. Everyone
figured he would nab the
starting role the following

season.
In a prelude to the foot
ball season, the major
headline centered around a
three-way battle for the top
signal-calling spot. Kline,
junior Austin Hinder and
newcomer Jared Goff spent
the offseason locked in a
fierce and hyped-up compe
tition.
On Aug. 16, the team an
nounced its answer to the
long-fraught question: True
freshman Goff would lead
the Cal football team. At
the end of practice that day,
media swarmed head coach
Sonny Dykes, Goff and
Kline. Kline kept repeating
one phrase: "It's not over."
There was neither threat
nor resentment behind his
words, only sincerity. He was
disappointed, but he would
obviously support Goff.
"Heck, I wanted to," he
says of starting. "That was
the goal."
It still is for Kline, who
took the situation with sur
prising perspective. Football
"takes up 90 percent of your
life," according to Kline, and
that final 10 percent around
the edge is crucial.
He defines himself
largely outside the sport —
through his faith, through
the punk rock music he
plays on his Les Paul guitar.
His interests are so varied
that his mother calls him a
"Renaissance kid."
His life was far from over.
His career wasn't even over.
So he reworked his role
on the team. He took on

the backup spot with pride,
molding it to fit his person
ality.
"He's handled it fantas
tic," Worstell says. "He's just
trying to do the best he can
and to help out his team the
best he can."
For now, that means don
ning a headset. Kline is one
of four people who can talk
to Goff during live action,
and he embraces the posi
tion.

each outing, Kline posted
respectable numbers.
When coaches let Kline
know he will sub in, he has
only a few minutes to warm
up.
The emotion that builds
with "Black Thumbnail"
finds its outlet as he takes
his first snap. ■

throughout his career in a
stadium he'd known since
childhood.
"I was thankful even to
have the cleats on," Kline
says. "It's so easy for a fresh
man to get hated, and I did
not want to go down that
road. I just did what they
told me to do, and I was
thankful eveiy moment."
Observing from the side
line would pay off. Everyone
figured he would nab the
starting role the following

season.
In a prelude to the foot
ball season, the major
headline centered around a
three-way battle for the top
signal-calling spot. Kline,
junior Austin Hinder and
newcomer Jared Goff spent
the offseason locked in a
fierce and hyped-up compe
tition.
On Aug. 16, the team an
nounced its answer to the
long-fraught question: True
freshman Goff would lead
the Cal football team. At
the end of practice that day,
media swarmed head coach
Sonny Dykes, Goff and
Kline. Kline kept repeating
one phrase: "It's not over."
There was neither threat
nor resentment behind his
words, only sincerity. He was
disappointed, but he would
obviously support Goff.
"Heck, I wanted to," he
says of starting. "That was
the goal."
It still is for Kline, who
took the situation with sur
prising perspective. Football
"takes up 90 percent of your
life," according to Kline, and
that final 10 percent around
the edge is crucial.
He defines himself
largely outside the sport —
through his faith, through
the punk rock music he
plays on his Les Paul guitar.
His interests are so varied
that his mother calls him a
"Renaissance kid."
His life was far from over.
His career wasn't even over.
So he reworked his role
on the team. He took on

the backup spot with pride,
molding it to fit his person
ality.
"He's handled it fantas
tic," Worstell says. "He's just
trying to do the best he can
and to help out his team the
best he can."
For now, that means don
ning a headset. Kline is one
of four people who can talk
to Goff during live action,
and he embraces the posi
tion.

each outing, Kline posted
respectable numbers.
When coaches let Kline
know he will sub in, he has
only a few minutes to warm
up.
The emotion that builds
with "Black Thumbnail"
finds its outlet as he takes
his first snap. ■

About two and a half
hours prior to kickoff at
each home game, cheers
and fight songs bombard the Cal
football team on Piedmont Av
enue as it makes its way toward
Memorial Stadium. The tradi
tion is called March to Victory.
Zach Kline has his own tradi
tion. Tuning out the rest of the
world, he lets the opening rilf
of "Black Thumbnail" by Kings
of Leon fill his head before his
team leaves the bus. "Such a

sweet song," he says.
More often than not, pump
ing himself up before a game
means staying in that state of
mind for the entire game. Get
ting into the zone isn't a first
step that gives way to an adrena
line rush on the field.
On most Saturdays, it's the
only step. Kline has to cling to
that pregame emotion even as
the quarters wind down. Just in
case the coaches decide to sub
him in. As the No. 2 quarter
back on the team, Kline rarely
sees playing time. Between the
lines of "Black Thumbnail," he
dials into the emotions that
other teammates will harness
throughout the next 60 min
utes. He stays vigilant as some
one ahead of him calls the shots.
For Kline to do so wasn't
part of anybody's original plan.
When he came to UC Berke
ley in spring 2012, he was Cal's

great hope. But a quarterback
race in this past offseason left
him on the sideline for the sec
ond year in a row.
His position on the team
could be seen as anticlimactic.
Or it could be seen as a vital, if
less visible, cog in Cal's machine.
Kline sees it as the latter.
Before the quarterback com
petition, there was some
thing simpler: Zach, his father
and the park.
Scott Kline used to take his
8-year-old son to a nearby park
year-round in Danville, Calif., to
play football and baseball. That
same year, Zach joined his first
Pop Warner team.
Scott taught his son a simple
three-step drop in the hopes it
would get Zach noticed in prac
tice. It did: That first year, Zach
switched from linebacker to
backup quarterback.
From then on, at the be

ginning of every new season,
coaches would ask which play
ers wanted to try out for quar
terback. After a while, it served
little more than symbolic pur
pose; Kline always won the
starting slot.
"Fifty hands would go up,"
says Lisa, Zach's mother. "There
was always a competition, and
he beat them out."
Performing on the field came
naturally and brought with it
plenty of attention. Adults con
stantly told him he would have a
career in college, in the pros.
So one day at the park, Scott
Kline imparted some advice his
young son never shook off. If you
ever get the chance to play in
college, he told Zach, and Cal or
Stanford comes calling, just say
yes. There are no better schools.
Kline grew up attending
games and camps in Memorial
Stadium, so dreams of playing

there came easily.
"I was all Cal," he says. He
loved it, plain and simple.
After the first game of his
junior year of high school,
Kline committed to the
Bears — and spent the next
year and a half recruiting
others on Cal's behalf.
Kline was the crown
jewel of Jeff Tedford's 2012
Signing Day class, and he
literally could not wait to
come to Berkeley. In Febra
aiy 2012, while the rest of
his class waffled over last
minute decisions, Kline was
already living in the Clark
Kerr dorms after graduating
from high school early.
At that year's intra-squad
spring game, Cal unveiled
Kline. The freshman com
pleted a game-winning
two-point-conversion pass
to Jackson Bouza and solidi
fied his identity as Cal's next
big thing.
During his redshirt year
in 2012, he never grew im
patient. Cal was the dream,
after all. He was playing un
der a coach he had admired
throughout his career in a
stadium he'd known since
childhood.
"I was thankful even to
have the cleats on," Kline
says. "It's so easy for a fresh
