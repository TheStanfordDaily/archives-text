# GO WITH THE FLOW
## Despite being the No. 2 QB on the depth chart, Zach Kline keeps it cool

About two and a half
hours prior to kickoff at
each home game, cheers
and fight songs bombard the Cal
football team on Piedmont Av
enue as it makes its way toward
Memorial Stadium. The tradi
tion is called March to Victory.
Zach Kline has his own tradi
tion. Tuning out the rest of the
world, he lets the opening rilf
of "Black Thumbnail" by Kings
of Leon fill his head before his
team leaves the bus. "Such a

sweet song," he says.
More often than not, pump
ing himself up before a game
means staying in that state of
mind for the entire game. Get
ting into the zone isn't a first
step that gives way to an adrena
line rush on the field.
On most Saturdays, it's the
only step. Kline has to cling to
that pregame emotion even as
the quarters wind down. Just in
case the coaches decide to sub
him in. As the No. 2 quarter
back on the team, Kline rarely
sees playing time. Between the
lines of "Black Thumbnail," he
dials into the emotions that
other teammates will harness
throughout the next 60 min
utes. He stays vigilant as some
one ahead of him calls the shots.
For Kline to do so wasn't
part of anybody's original plan.
When he came to UC Berke
ley in spring 2012, he was Cal's

great hope. But a quarterback
race in this past offseason left
him on the sideline for the sec
ond year in a row.
His position on the team
could be seen as anticlimactic.
Or it could be seen as a vital, if
less visible, cog in Cal's machine.
Kline sees it as the latter.
Before the quarterback com
petition, there was some
thing simpler: Zach, his father
and the park.
Scott Kline used to take his
8-year-old son to a nearby park
year-round in Danville, Calif., to
play football and baseball. That
same year, Zach joined his first
Pop Warner team.
Scott taught his son a simple
three-step drop in the hopes it
would get Zach noticed in prac
tice. It did: That first year, Zach
switched from linebacker to
backup quarterback.
From then on, at the be

ginning of every new season,
coaches would ask which play
ers wanted to try out for quar
terback. After a while, it served
little more than symbolic pur
pose; Kline always won the
starting slot.
"Fifty hands would go up,"
says Lisa, Zach's mother. "There
was always a competition, and
he beat them out."
Performing on the field came
naturally and brought with it
plenty of attention. Adults con
stantly told him he would have a
career in college, in the pros.
So one day at the park, Scott
Kline imparted some advice his
young son never shook off. If you
ever get the chance to play in
college, he told Zach, and Cal or
Stanford comes calling, just say
yes. There are no better schools.
Kline grew up attending
games and camps in Memorial
Stadium, so dreams of playing
