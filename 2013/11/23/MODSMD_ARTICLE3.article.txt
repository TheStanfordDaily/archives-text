## PREDICTIONS 
### 
GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 41, CAL 13: I know that Stanford's
offense hasn't played well in its last two games against
Cal, but the Bears defense is so bad this year that even
if head coach David Shaw dials up the Wildcat every
play, the Cardinal will still win the game. Last weekend's
loss to USC was was one of the most disappointing loss
es in recent memory, but with an at-large BCS bowl still
possible, don't expect the Cardinal players to take to
day's game lightly. I think junior quarterback Kevin Hogan
will bounce back in a big way, and the Cardinal defense
will force at least three turnovers. Expect Stanford to
jump out to an early two-touchdown lead and never look
back.

STANFORD 48, CAL 1 < : In homage to my first
Big Game memory, I'll take Stanford 48-14. While I think
the Cardinal is actual more than 34 points better than the
Bears, I just don't see Stanford running up the score.
There hasn't been much animosity in this rivalry as of
late you have to go back to the pregame "brawl" in
2010 to find anything of the sort. I think Stanford comes
out a bit flat due to the disappointment of USC but pulls
away in the second and third quarters to win easily. Fifth
year senior linebacker Trent Murphy picks up two more
sacks as well, and I'm hoping that will be enough for him
to finally earn the national recognition he very much de
serves.

STANFORD 56, CAL 10: I find it bizarre how
bad Cal is this season. They've been a top-25 recruiter
for the better part of the last decade, and their skill talent
is still outrageous. Bigelow, Treggs, Harper and Muham
mad are all stud playmakers that can go off at any time
Cal didn't just top UCLA last year; it beat the Bruins
like the proverbial drum. Anything can happen with the
Golden Bears. However, Cal is weak where Stanford is
strong: on the lines. Years of poor recruiting on the offen
sive line has killed Cal's depth to the point where it lost to
Colorado. I don't just expect Stanford to win. I think the
Card will easily cover the spread, which is five scores the
last time I checked.
