# Improbable path to a BCS bowl
## 
### WHAT TO WATCH FOR Sam Fisher 
I'm sorry, but I can't in good faith
give an in-depth breakdown of Big
Game. I just don't believe that Cal
can beat Stanford, and more im
portantly, I don't think there are
any interesting matchups to go
through.

Barring an upset of literally epic
proportions, Stanford will beat the
Bears, likely by three touchdowns or
more. I'm not saying an upset can't hap
pen, but I can't possibly predict how
that upset would take place.
For those reasons, I'm going to go
off the regular path of this column to go
through this weekend's football games
taking place outside of Stanford Stadi
um that could have significant impacts
on the Cardinal's bowl destination.

The big game of the weekend in
college football is one of those that
could impact Stanford: the Big-12
matchup between No. 10 Oklahoma
State and No. 4 Baylor. The Baylor Bears
are likely to play in a BCS bowl no mat
ter what happens on Saturday, but
Oklahoma State is on the bubble.
Teams need to be ranked in the top 14
of the BCS to be eligible for at-large se
lections to a BCS game, so a blowout
loss to Baylor could potentially move
the Cowboys out of contention. If Okla
homa State can play Baylor close or up
set the Bears, both of those teams
could end up in BCS bowls, sending
Stanford to the Alamo Bowl or worse.

If the Big-12 doesn't send two
teams, Stanford could still be undone
by the No. 2 team out of the Big Ten.
Hie two contenders for this spot are

No. 19 Wisconsin and No. 13 Michi
gan State.

Michigan State is unlikely to
lose Saturday against Northwestern
(4-6, 0-6 Big Ten), but anything can
happen on the road in the Big Ten.
A loss to a team like Northwestern,
which would be the Spartans' sec
ond loss of the year, would certainly
knock Michigan State out of con
tention for an at-large BCS berth.
Wisconsin is significantly more
likely to lose this weekend. The
Badgers head into hostile territory
to take on No. 25 Minnesota. The
upstart Golden Gophers are playing
great football as of late and are tech
nically still alive for a berth in the Big
Ten Championship, so you can ex
pect that the atmosphere in Min
neapolis will be raucous. Many ex
perts have projected Wisconsin as
the team most likely to earn the fi
nal BCS at-large bid, so a Minnesota
win could be a huge boon to Stan
ford's hopes.
The final piece of the puzzle,
which isn't as relevant this weekend
due to cupcake matchups, is that
Stanford needs the favorite team in
each AQ conference besides the
SEC to win its conference. If No.
2 Florida State, No. 3 Ohio State or
No. 5 Oregon is upset in its confer
ence-championship games, it will
probably still earn an at-large bid
while the team that beat it will earn
the automatic bid, leaving Stanford
out of the hunt once again.
Looking at the complexity of
the above scenarios, it is easy to see
how precarious Stanford's position
is right now. Help could be on the
way, however, as early as today, and
that's part of what makes college
football so intriguing. We'll just have
to wait and see.

magic to bring down Oklahoma
State, Michigan State and Wisconsin.
