# BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DAILY CALIFORNIAN

### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's Big Game be
tween Stanford and Cat, The Daily's Win
ston Shi chatted with Connor Byrne, a
columnist for The Daily Californian, to get
perspective from both camps. Below is a
partial transcript of their conversation. For

Winston Shi (WS): Obviously Cal's record has
been disappointing, but has Cal improved over
the course of the season?

Connor Byrne (CB): There hasn't been any tan
gible improvement. The offense still hasn't found
away to consistently score in the red zone, the
offensive line has continued to struggle providing
any sort of pocket and the defense hasn't been
able to stop anybody. A lot of that can be attrib
uted to just an absurd amount of injuries. At one
point in the season wide receivers Bryce Treggs
and Chris Harper started working out with the
defensive backs, as there were almost a few situ
ations where there were just no other available
cornerbacks to play. However, there have been a
handful of players who have played the whole
year without getting hurt, and they haven't
shown any real improvement. Cal's most impres
sive game continues to be its opener against
Northwestern, which is looking less and less im
pressive given that the Wildcats have imploded in
recent weeks.

WS: Cal played probably the hardest schedule in
the country to open the season: Northwestern,
Ohio State and Oregon. I guess you could say
that the nail-biter against an FCS team was a har
binger of bad things to come, but if Cal had
played a less brutal schedule do you think the
team would be playing better now?

CB: It's definitely possible, but given how it
struggled against Portland State, I'm not sure that
an easier schedule would have made much differ
ence in terms of how the team would be playing
right now. More so than anything else, injuries
have been the No. 1 reason for the Bears' strug
gles. At this point they currently have two of the
11 projected defensive starters back in spring
playing. They could have played one of the easiest
schedules in the country and continued to strug
gle given how many players they've had miss sig-

Senior tailback Tyler Gaffney (right) should have no problem finding some open holes in Cal's
defense. Gaffney rushed for 158 yards and two touchdowns in Stanford's loss at USC last week.
