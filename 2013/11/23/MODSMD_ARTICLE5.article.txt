### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
In advance of Saturday's Big Game be
tween Stanford and Cat, The Daily's Win
ston Shi chatted with Connor Byrne, a
columnist for The Daily Californian, to get
perspective from both camps. Below is a
partial transcript of their conversation. For
the full conversation, go to www.stanford
daily.com/category/sports.

Winston Shi (WS): Obviously Cal's record has
been disappointing, but has Cal improved over
the course of the season?

Connor Byrne (CB): There hasn't been any tan
gible improvement. The offense still hasn't found
away to consistently score in the red zone, the
offensive line has continued to struggle providing
any sort of pocket and the defense hasn't been
able to stop anybody. A lot of that can be attrib
uted to just an absurd amount of injuries. At one
point in the season wide receivers Bryce Treggs
and Chris Harper started working out with the
defensive backs, as there were almost a few situ
ations where there were just no other available
cornerbacks to play. However, there have been a
handful of players who have played the whole
year without getting hurt, and they haven't
shown any real improvement. Cal's most impres
sive game continues to be its opener against
Northwestern, which is looking less and less im
pressive given that the Wildcats have imploded in
recent weeks.

WS: Cal played probably the hardest schedule in
the country to open the season: Northwestern,
Ohio State and Oregon. I guess you could say
that the nail-biter against an FCS team was a har
binger of bad things to come, but if Cal had
played a less brutal schedule do you think the
team would be playing better now?

CB: It's definitely possible, but given how it
struggled against Portland State, I'm not sure that
an easier schedule would have made much differ
ence in terms of how the team would be playing
right now. More so than anything else, injuries
have been the No. 1 reason for the Bears' strug
gles. At this point they currently have two of the
11 projected defensive starters back in spring
playing. They could have played one of the easiest
schedules in the country and continued to strug
gle given how many players they've had miss sig-

nificant time on both sides of the ball.

WS: So is there hope? The story goes
that Stanford only started improving
after Tedford built a winner in Straw
berry Canyon —it lit a fire under
the Stanford fan base. This season
may be difficult, but do you at least
believe that Stanford's resurgence
has ignited the Cal fan base? Even if
this season is lost, what hope do you
see coming?

CB: I think Stanford's success proba
bly irks much of the Cal fan base, but
I wouldn't go as far to say it has "ignit
ed" it. The Cal fan base started to get
pretty upset with the direction of the
football team in late 2007, and has
continued to demand a return to rel
evancy. As far as the future, I think
most people are taking a wait-and-see
approach with the Sonny Dykes
regime.

WS: Can Cal win? If so, how would
it happen?

CB: If the Bears can find away to
stop the run consistently while estab
lishing their own running game, they
could have a chance. But they haven't
shown any ability on defense to stop
anybody, and I don't see that chang
ing this weekend. They just don't
have the personnel healthy right
now. Their ground game has shown a
little more improvement in the past
few weeks, but that has also coincid
ed with playing against some softer
defenses. I don't see them being able
to control the ball and keep their de
fense off the field against Stanford.

WS: How do you see the game un
folding then? Do you have a score
prediction?

CB: I think Stanford gets an early
lead in the first quarter and then just
runs the ball straight over Cal the rest
of the way. 45-20 Stanford.

right now. More so than anything else, injuries
have been the No. 1 reason for the Bears' strug

11 projected defensive starters back in spring
playing. They could have played one of the easiest
schedules in the country and continued to strug

nificant time on both sides of the ball.

WS: So is there hope? The story goes
that Stanford only started improving
after Tedford built a winner in Straw
berry Canyon —it lit a fire under
the Stanford fan base. This season
may be difficult, but do you at least
believe that Stanford's resurgence
has ignited the Cal fan base? Even if
this season is lost, what hope do you
see coming?

CB: I think Stanford's success proba
bly irks much of the Cal fan base, but
I wouldn't go as far to say it has "ignit
ed" it. The Cal fan base started to get
pretty upset with the direction of the
football team in late 2007, and has
continued to demand a return to rel
evancy. As far as the future, I think
most people are taking a wait-and-see
approach with the Sonny Dykes
regime.

WS: Can Cal win? If so, how would
it happen?

CB: If the Bears can find away to
stop the run consistently while estab
lishing their own running game, they
could have a chance. But they haven't
shown any ability on defense to stop
anybody, and I don't see that chang
ing this weekend. They just don't
have the personnel healthy right
now. Their ground game has shown a
little more improvement in the past
few weeks, but that has also coincid
ed with playing against some softer
defenses. I don't see them being able
to control the ball and keep their de
fense off the field against Stanford.

WS: How do you see the game un
folding then? Do you have a score
prediction?

CB: I think Stanford gets an early
lead in the first quarter and then just
runs the ball straight over Cal the rest
of the way. 45-20 Stanford.
