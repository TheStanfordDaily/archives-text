# The
						Infamous Three
## Looking back on the last successful Axe heist 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Tim Conway '74 and David Suliteanu '75 were
caught off guard at the Big Game rally on Monday
night. It wasn't star linebacker Shayne Skov's "Macho
Man" Randy Savage accent as emcee, or the fire
works that were periodically launched from Angell
Field during the show.

The biggest surprise was the Stanford Axe. It felt
heavy.

A lot can change in 40 years.
On Nov. 20, 1973, Stanford students Conway
and Suliteanu stole the Axe in the lead-up to Big
Game, earning the nickname "The Infamous Three"
for themselves and Conway's brother Matt, their fel
low conspirator. But after the Axe was returned to
Cal moments before kickoff, Conway and Suliteanu
never picked it up again.
Not until they hoisted it at this week's rally, that
is.
"The highlight was getting our hands on that
Axe again," Suliteanu said. "Being able to carry it out
on stage and show it, it was perfect... Think about
that. Forty years, almost to the day."

Though the Axe still changes hands on the play
ing field regularly â€”Stanford won the trophy back
just hours after The Infamous Three gave it up
Conway and Suliteanu are the last people to success
fully engineer its heist. Maybe that's why that
Thanksgiving Week back in 1973 is still such a high
point.

'After 40 years of being out there in the working
world doing whatever you do, there's a lot of neat
things that come along," Conway said. "But when
you look at the whole big picture it definitely stands
out as a really big part of our lives."
With Conway and Suliteanu, that's saying some
thing. Besides his day job working in construction labor
relations, Conway has operated a wilderness camp in
Alaska for 30 years; Suliteanu, meanwhile, served for
13 years as the president and CEO of cosmetics retail
er Sephora. They've stayed in touch the entire time,
and this year they've taken trips to Alaska and wine
country to celebrate Suliteanu's 60th birthday.
Suliteanu claims he's told the story of the heist
100 times. Once, he was interviewing with a job re
cruiter from Home Depot who had a policy against
asking candidates questions instead, he just want
ed to hear their life stories. Suliteanu obliged, and
when he got to his college years, he mentioned that
he had stolen the Stanford Axe.

That's when the recruiter the one who usu-

during their theft of the Axe in 1973. They then convinced Cal students that the trophy was needed for
a press conference at a restaurant in Palo Alto and took advantage to steal back the Axe for Stanford.
