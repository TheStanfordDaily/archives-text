# The 						Infamous Three
## Looking back on the last successful Axe heist 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Tim Conway '74 and David Suliteanu '75 were
caught off guard at the Big Game rally on Monday
night. It wasn't star linebacker Shayne Skov's "Macho
Man" Randy Savage accent as emcee, or the fire
works that were periodically launched from Angell
Field during the show.

The biggest surprise was the Stanford Axe. It felt
heavy.

A lot can change in 40 years.
On Nov. 20, 1973, Stanford students Conway
and Suliteanu stole the Axe in the lead-up to Big
Game, earning the nickname "The Infamous Three"
for themselves and Conway's brother Matt, their fel
low conspirator. But after the Axe was returned to
Cal moments before kickoff, Conway and Suliteanu
never picked it up again.
Not until they hoisted it at this week's rally, that
is.
"The highlight was getting our hands on that
Axe again," Suliteanu said. "Being able to carry it out
on stage and show it, it was perfect... Think about
that. Forty years, almost to the day."

Though the Axe still changes hands on the play
ing field regularly —Stanford won the trophy back
just hours after The Infamous Three gave it up
Conway and Suliteanu are the last people to success
fully engineer its heist. Maybe that's why that
Thanksgiving Week back in 1973 is still such a high
point.

'After 40 years of being out there in the working
world doing whatever you do, there's a lot of neat
things that come along," Conway said. "But when
you look at the whole big picture it definitely stands
out as a really big part of our lives."
With Conway and Suliteanu, that's saying some
thing. Besides his day job working in construction labor
relations, Conway has operated a wilderness camp in
Alaska for 30 years; Suliteanu, meanwhile, served for
13 years as the president and CEO of cosmetics retail
er Sephora. They've stayed in touch the entire time,
and this year they've taken trips to Alaska and wine
country to celebrate Suliteanu's 60th birthday.
Suliteanu claims he's told the story of the heist
100 times. Once, he was interviewing with a job re
cruiter from Home Depot who had a policy against
asking candidates questions instead, he just want
ed to hear their life stories. Suliteanu obliged, and
when he got to his college years, he mentioned that
he had stolen the Stanford Axe.

That's when the recruiter the one who usu-

ally refuses to ask questions
broke in. He had gone to Cal, and he
wanted to hear everything. Thirty
minutes later, Suliteanu had the job.

The tale of the heist is as dra
matic as it is legendary. Conway
hatched the plan only a couple of
weeks before Big Game. Matt, then
a student at San Francisco School of
Law, would impersonate Cal head
coach Mike White over the phone
and ask the Cal student union man
ager to hand over the Axe to two of
his "players" Conway and
Suliteanu —who needed it for a
press luncheon at Ming's Restau
rant in Palo Alto. Conway completed
the disguise by telling a friend on
the Golden Bears baseball team that
he needed two Cal letterman jack
ets for a costume party.
But when Conway and
Suliteanu arrived at the student
union on that fateful Tuesday, the
Axe wasn't there it was being
safeguarded at the Berkeley police
station for Big Game week. With a
policeman stationed right outside
the manager's office, the impostors
could only sit and wait for Matt to
call again.
"I felt a little bit trapped," Con
way said. "When we were sitting
there in that office, I remember
thinking, 'What are we doing here?
This is not a good place to be.'"
Finally, the phone rang; it was
Matt. The manager explained the

predicament, but "Coach White"
was insistent he needed the Axe,
and he didn't want his "players" to
be late.

The Cal Rally Committee re
trieved the Axe, but they wouldn't
just hand it over. Instead, four mem
bers agreed to take the Axe in a sep
arate car and follow Conway and
Suliteanu all the way to Ming's.
"We had to drive from Berkeley
to Palo Alto, with the Axe in a car be
hind us," Suliteanu remembered.
"Two of us, four of them. We had one
hour, approximately, to think about
what we were going to do, and how.
And basically, we just looked at each
other and said, 'You know what? We
came this far. No matter what, we're
going for it. Whatever happens, we're
going to try to get our hands on it.'"
When Suliteanu and Conway
pulled into Ming's, they saw some of
their Theta Delta Chi fraternity broth
ers tossing a football in the parking
lot. Matt had run out of toll money
for the trip back, but he had called for
backup.

As two of the Rally Committee
members helped him cover the Axe
from the rain, Conway grabbed the
trophy, yelled out and took off run
ning. Suliteanu instinctually bear
hugged one of the Cal students, leav
ing Conway to fend off the other
three. But the bulk slowed him
down, and they eventually tackled
Conway onto a pink Cadillac that was
sitting in the parking lot.

The Axe slid out of his hands and
onto the top of the wet car, where
one of the Rally Committee members
grabbed it. Just moments later, how
ever, a swarm of Conway's fraternity

brothers arrived to snatch it for good.
After some group photos at
Theta Delta Chi, the Axe was quickly
spirited away to Suliteanu's grand
mother's house. The conspirators
had no choice; they had been spotted
by the media at Ming's. But even
though Conway and Suliteanu were
soon contacted by the police chief
and University officials, the Axe re
mained safe.

"Think about the temptation,"
Suliteanu said. "You've got this thing,
and what you really wanted to do was
go grab it and go run around with it
... Our thinking was, 'Let's stay away
from it.'"

The Infamous Three submitted a
list of creative demands among
them, $6,000, admission to the Stan
ford graduate school of their choice
and Thanksgiving dinner with Univer
sity president Richard Lyman be
fore eventually exchanging the Axe
for Big Game field passes. They drove
into Stanford Stadium on Saturday
morning and handed the trophy over
to the police chief, Sports Informa
tion Director Bob Murphy and Cardi
nal head coach Jack Christiansen, and
Stanford's captains returned it to Cal
during the pregame coin toss.

Besides the scuffle at Ming's, a
couple of brief photo sessions and the
pregame exchange, the Axe re
mained safely under Suliteanu's
grandmother's bed for the entire
week leading up to the 1973 Big
Game. That's part of the reason why
Monday's rally was so special to Con
way and Suliteanu. They hadn't just
waited 40 years to hold the Axe again;
they had waited 40 years to truly eel

ebrate with it.

But the two surviving members
of The Infamous Three aren't cele
brating alone this week. On Thursday
night, over Conway's barbequing and
tri-tips, their tale was told one more
time at Theta Delta Chi to fraternity
brothers young and old.
"What a great excuse to recon
nect with them and get them togeth
er," Suliteanu said. "You've got these
guys who are in the fraternity now,
and truthfully, they don't know much
about us, they don't know much
about [the heist). And so you can put
[this] huge, giant generation gap to
gether for one evening, in the house
where we lived."

About 50 fraternity members
from the 70s are in town to celebrate
the heist's 40th anniversary with the
barbeque, a private dinner Friday
night and a tailgate Saturday morn
ing. They're not the only ones for
whom the memory of November
1973 still holds meaning; the story is
a sense of pride for the Stanford com
munity as a whole. Jim Cost, one of
the Palo Alto police officers who in
vestigated the theft, even lists the
case on his Linkedln page.

But to call the tale of The Infa
mous Three just a great memory is,
itself, minimizing. That's because of
the trio's outlandish demands, one
their request that Stanford create
a display case for the Axe —was ac
tually implemented by the Universi
ty soon after the heist.
The Axe hasn't been stolen
since.

and he didn't want his "players" to
be late.

The Cal Rally Committee re
trieved the Axe, but they wouldn't
just hand it over. Instead, four mem
bers agreed to take the Axe in a sep
arate car and follow Conway and
Suliteanu all the way to Ming's.
"We had to drive from Berkeley
to Palo Alto, with the Axe in a car be
hind us," Suliteanu remembered.
"Two of us, four of them. We had one
hour, approximately, to think about
what we were going to do, and how.
And basically, we just looked at each
other and said, 'You know what? We
came this far. No matter what, we're
going for it. Whatever happens, we're
going to try to get our hands on it.'"
When Suliteanu and Conway
pulled into Ming's, they saw some of
their Theta Delta Chi fraternity broth
ers tossing a football in the parking
lot. Matt had run out of toll money
for the trip back, but he had called for
backup.

As two of the Rally Committee
members helped him cover the Axe
from the rain, Conway grabbed the
trophy, yelled out and took off run
ning. Suliteanu instinctually bear
hugged one of the Cal students, leav
ing Conway to fend off the other
three. But the bulk slowed him
down, and they eventually tackled
Conway onto a pink Cadillac that was
sitting in the parking lot.

The Axe slid out of his hands and
onto the top of the wet car, where
one of the Rally Committee members
grabbed it. Just moments later, how
ever, a swarm of Conway's fraternity

brothers arrived to snatch it for good.
After some group photos at
Theta Delta Chi, the Axe was quickly
spirited away to Suliteanu's grand
mother's house. The conspirators
had no choice; they had been spotted
by the media at Ming's. But even
though Conway and Suliteanu were
soon contacted by the police chief
and University officials, the Axe re
mained safe.

"Think about the temptation,"
Suliteanu said. "You've got this thing,
and what you really wanted to do was
go grab it and go run around with it
... Our thinking was, 'Let's stay away
from it.'"

The Infamous Three submitted a
list of creative demands among
them, $6,000, admission to the Stan
ford graduate school of their choice
and Thanksgiving dinner with Univer
sity president Richard Lyman be
fore eventually exchanging the Axe
for Big Game field passes. They drove
into Stanford Stadium on Saturday
morning and handed the trophy over
to the police chief, Sports Informa
tion Director Bob Murphy and Cardi
nal head coach Jack Christiansen, and
Stanford's captains returned it to Cal
during the pregame coin toss.

Besides the scuffle at Ming's, a
couple of brief photo sessions and the
pregame exchange, the Axe re
mained safely under Suliteanu's
grandmother's bed for the entire
week leading up to the 1973 Big
Game. That's part of the reason why
Monday's rally was so special to Con
way and Suliteanu. They hadn't just
waited 40 years to hold the Axe again;
they had waited 40 years to truly eel

ebrate with it.

But the two surviving members
of The Infamous Three aren't cele
brating alone this week. On Thursday
night, over Conway's barbequing and
tri-tips, their tale was told one more
time at Theta Delta Chi to fraternity
brothers young and old.
"What a great excuse to recon
nect with them and get them togeth
er," Suliteanu said. "You've got these
guys who are in the fraternity now,
and truthfully, they don't know much
about us, they don't know much
about [the heist). And so you can put
[this] huge, giant generation gap to
gether for one evening, in the house
where we lived."

About 50 fraternity members
from the 70s are in town to celebrate
the heist's 40th anniversary with the
barbeque, a private dinner Friday
night and a tailgate Saturday morn
ing. They're not the only ones for
whom the memory of November
1973 still holds meaning; the story is
a sense of pride for the Stanford com
munity as a whole. Jim Cost, one of
the Palo Alto police officers who in
vestigated the theft, even lists the
case on his Linkedln page.

But to call the tale of The Infa
mous Three just a great memory is,
itself, minimizing. That's because of
the trio's outlandish demands, one
their request that Stanford create
a display case for the Axe —was ac
tually implemented by the Universi
ty soon after the heist.
The Axe hasn't been stolen
since.

Tim Conway '74 and David Suliteanu '75 were
caught off guard at the Big Game rally on Monday
night. It wasn't star linebacker Shayne Skov's "Macho
Man" Randy Savage accent as emcee, or the fire
works that were periodically launched from Angell
Field during the show.

The biggest surprise was the Stanford Axe. It felt
heavy.

A lot can change in 40 years.
On Nov. 20, 1973, Stanford students Conway
and Suliteanu stole the Axe in the lead-up to Big
Game, earning the nickname "The Infamous Three"
for themselves and Conway's brother Matt, their fel
low conspirator. But after the Axe was returned to
Cal moments before kickoff, Conway and Suliteanu
never picked it up again.
Not until they hoisted it at this week's rally, that
is.
"The highlight was getting our hands on that
Axe again," Suliteanu said. "Being able to carry it out
on stage and show it, it was perfect... Think about
that. Forty years, almost to the day."

Though the Axe still changes hands on the play
ing field regularly —Stanford won the trophy back
just hours after The Infamous Three gave it up
Conway and Suliteanu are the last people to success
fully engineer its heist. Maybe that's why that
Thanksgiving Week back in 1973 is still such a high
point.

'After 40 years of being out there in the working
world doing whatever you do, there's a lot of neat
things that come along," Conway said. "But when
you look at the whole big picture it definitely stands
out as a really big part of our lives."
With Conway and Suliteanu, that's saying some
thing. Besides his day job working in construction labor
relations, Conway has operated a wilderness camp in
Alaska for 30 years; Suliteanu, meanwhile, served for
13 years as the president and CEO of cosmetics retail
er Sephora. They've stayed in touch the entire time,
and this year they've taken trips to Alaska and wine
country to celebrate Suliteanu's 60th birthday.
Suliteanu claims he's told the story of the heist
100 times. Once, he was interviewing with a job re
cruiter from Home Depot who had a policy against
asking candidates questions instead, he just want
ed to hear their life stories. Suliteanu obliged, and
when he got to his college years, he mentioned that
he had stolen the Stanford Axe.

That's when the recruiter the one who usu-

ally refuses to ask questions
broke in. He had gone to Cal, and he
wanted to hear everything. Thirty
minutes later, Suliteanu had the job.

The tale of the heist is as dra
matic as it is legendary. Conway
hatched the plan only a couple of
weeks before Big Game. Matt, then
a student at San Francisco School of
Law, would impersonate Cal head
coach Mike White over the phone
and ask the Cal student union man
ager to hand over the Axe to two of
his "players" Conway and
Suliteanu —who needed it for a
press luncheon at Ming's Restau
rant in Palo Alto. Conway completed
the disguise by telling a friend on
the Golden Bears baseball team that
he needed two Cal letterman jack
ets for a costume party.
But when Conway and
Suliteanu arrived at the student
union on that fateful Tuesday, the
Axe wasn't there it was being
safeguarded at the Berkeley police
station for Big Game week. With a
policeman stationed right outside
the manager's office, the impostors
could only sit and wait for Matt to
call again.
"I felt a little bit trapped," Con
way said. "When we were sitting
there in that office, I remember
thinking, 'What are we doing here?
This is not a good place to be.'"
Finally, the phone rang; it was
Matt. The manager explained the

predicament, but "Coach White"
was insistent he needed the Axe,
and he didn't want his "players" to
be late.

The Cal Rally Committee re

Tim Conway '74 and David Suliteanu '75 were
caught off guard at the Big Game rally on Monday
night. It wasn't star linebacker Shayne Skov's "Macho
Man" Randy Savage accent as emcee, or the fire
works that were periodically launched from Angell
Field during the show.

The biggest surprise was the Stanford Axe. It felt
heavy.

A lot can change in 40 years.
On Nov. 20, 1973, Stanford students Conway
and Suliteanu stole the Axe in the lead-up to Big
Game, earning the nickname "The Infamous Three"
for themselves and Conway's brother Matt, their fel
low conspirator. But after the Axe was returned to
Cal moments before kickoff, Conway and Suliteanu
never picked it up again.
Not until they hoisted it at this week's rally, that
is.
"The highlight was getting our hands on that
Axe again," Suliteanu said. "Being able to carry it out
on stage and show it, it was perfect... Think about
that. Forty years, almost to the day."

Though the Axe still changes hands on the play
ing field regularly —Stanford won the trophy back
just hours after The Infamous Three gave it up
Conway and Suliteanu are the last people to success
fully engineer its heist. Maybe that's why that
Thanksgiving Week back in 1973 is still such a high
point.

'After 40 years of being out there in the working
world doing whatever you do, there's a lot of neat
things that come along," Conway said. "But when
you look at the whole big picture it definitely stands
out as a really big part of our lives."
With Conway and Suliteanu, that's saying some
thing. Besides his day job working in construction labor
relations, Conway has operated a wilderness camp in
Alaska for 30 years; Suliteanu, meanwhile, served for
13 years as the president and CEO of cosmetics retail
er Sephora. They've stayed in touch the entire time,
and this year they've taken trips to Alaska and wine
country to celebrate Suliteanu's 60th birthday.
Suliteanu claims he's told the story of the heist
100 times. Once, he was interviewing with a job re
cruiter from Home Depot who had a policy against
asking candidates questions instead, he just want
ed to hear their life stories. Suliteanu obliged, and
when he got to his college years, he mentioned that
he had stolen the Stanford Axe.

That's when the recruiter the one who usu-

ally refuses to ask questions
broke in. He had gone to Cal, and he
wanted to hear everything. Thirty
minutes later, Suliteanu had the job.

The tale of the heist is as dra
matic as it is legendary. Conway
hatched the plan only a couple of
weeks before Big Game. Matt, then
a student at San Francisco School of
Law, would impersonate Cal head
coach Mike White over the phone
and ask the Cal student union man
ager to hand over the Axe to two of
his "players" Conway and
Suliteanu —who needed it for a
press luncheon at Ming's Restau
rant in Palo Alto. Conway completed
the disguise by telling a friend on
the Golden Bears baseball team that
he needed two Cal letterman jack
ets for a costume party.
But when Conway and
Suliteanu arrived at the student
union on that fateful Tuesday, the
Axe wasn't there it was being
safeguarded at the Berkeley police
station for Big Game week. With a
policeman stationed right outside
the manager's office, the impostors
could only sit and wait for Matt to
call again.
"I felt a little bit trapped," Con
way said. "When we were sitting
there in that office, I remember
thinking, 'What are we doing here?
This is not a good place to be.'"
Finally, the phone rang; it was
Matt. The manager explained the

predicament, but "Coach White"
was insistent he needed the Axe,
and he didn't want his "players" to
be late.

The Cal Rally Committee re
trieved the Axe, but they wouldn't
just hand it over. Instead, four mem
bers agreed to take the Axe in a sep
arate car and follow Conway and
Suliteanu all the way to Ming's.
"We had to drive from Berkeley
to Palo Alto, with the Axe in a car be
hind us," Suliteanu remembered.
"Two of us, four of them. We had one
hour, approximately, to think about
what we were going to do, and how.
And basically, we just looked at each
other and said, 'You know what? We
came this far. No matter what, we're
going for it. Whatever happens, we're
going to try to get our hands on it.'"
When Suliteanu and Conway
pulled into Ming's, they saw some of
their Theta Delta Chi fraternity broth
ers tossing a football in the parking
lot. Matt had run out of toll money
for the trip back, but he had called for
backup.

As two of the Rally Committee
members helped him cover the Axe
from the rain, Conway grabbed the
trophy, yelled out and took off run
ning. Suliteanu instinctually bear
hugged one of the Cal students, leav
ing Conway to fend off the other
three. But the bulk slowed him
down, and they eventually tackled
Conway onto a pink Cadillac that was
sitting in the parking lot.

The Axe slid out of his hands and
onto the top of the wet car, where
one of the Rally Committee members
grabbed it. Just moments later, how
ever, a swarm of Conway's fraternity

brothers arrived to snatch it for good.
After some group photos at
Theta Delta Chi, the Axe was quickly
spirited away to Suliteanu's grand
mother's house. The conspirators
had no choice; they had been spotted
by the media at Ming's. But even
though Conway and Suliteanu were
soon contacted by the police chief
and University officials, the Axe re
mained safe.

"Think about the temptation,"
Suliteanu said. "You've got this thing,
and what you really wanted to do was
go grab it and go run around with it
... Our thinking was, 'Let's stay away
from it.'"

The Infamous Three submitted a
list of creative demands among
them, $6,000, admission to the Stan
ford graduate school of their choice
and Thanksgiving dinner with Univer
sity president Richard Lyman be
fore eventually exchanging the Axe
for Big Game field passes. They drove
into Stanford Stadium on Saturday
morning and handed the trophy over
to the police chief, Sports Informa
tion Director Bob Murphy and Cardi
nal head coach Jack Christiansen, and
Stanford's captains returned it to Cal
during the pregame coin toss.

Besides the scuffle at Ming's, a
couple of brief photo sessions and the
pregame exchange, the Axe re
mained safely under Suliteanu's
grandmother's bed for the entire
week leading up to the 1973 Big
Game. That's part of the reason why
Monday's rally was so special to Con
way and Suliteanu. They hadn't just
waited 40 years to hold the Axe again;
they had waited 40 years to truly eel

ebrate with it.

But the two surviving members
of The Infamous Three aren't cele
brating alone this week. On Thursday
night, over Conway's barbequing and
tri-tips, their tale was told one more
time at Theta Delta Chi to fraternity
brothers young and old.
"What a great excuse to recon
nect with them and get them togeth
er," Suliteanu said. "You've got these
guys who are in the fraternity now,
and truthfully, they don't know much
about us, they don't know much
about [the heist). And so you can put
[this] huge, giant generation gap to
gether for one evening, in the house
where we lived."

About 50 fraternity members
from the 70s are in town to celebrate
the heist's 40th anniversary with the
barbeque, a private dinner Friday
night and a tailgate Saturday morn
ing. They're not the only ones for
whom the memory of November
1973 still holds meaning; the story is
a sense of pride for the Stanford com
munity as a whole. Jim Cost, one of
the Palo Alto police officers who in
vestigated the theft, even lists the
case on his Linkedln page.
