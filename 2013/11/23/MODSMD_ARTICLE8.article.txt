# STANFORD PREVAILS IN PENALTIES
## 
### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Generally, if you score a goal
and an assist, you're having a great
game. If that goal happens to be the
winning penalty kick, then you're
having a fantastic game. If you're a
goalie, and you save a penalty kick,
you're having a stunning game. If
you happen to be Stanford's senior
goalkeeper Drew Hutchins and have
done all three of these things, you're
having a once-in-a-lifetime perform
ance.

Drew Hutchins didn't want to
go home to Morrisville, Pennsylva
nia, just yet. In order to prolong his

and Stanford's tournament
life, all he needed was one of the
finest individual displays this year.

For a long time, it appeared that
this game would be a fitting end to
Stanford's season. Having dominated
from the outset and establishing a
16-5 lead in shots, Stanford (9-6-3)
outplayed the Loyola Marymount
Lions (13-4-2) from start to finish,
yet had no goal to reward it for its
troubles. Just as in many of the
games this season, the Card was
punished for its inability to finish
in front of the goal, with LMU tak
ing what seemed to be an insur
mountable lead in the 83rd
minute. LMU midfielder John Mc-
Farlin, already possessing 10 as
sists for the season, added another
to his tally when he squared the
ball for forward Adrien Perez, who
unleashed a 20-yard shot into the
top-right corner of the goal. There
was nothing Hutchins could do.
Not yet.

Among the Stanford chances
it would have rued were senior
Bobby Edwards' volley, pushed
away by LMU's sophomore goalie
Paul Blechette, and sophomore
midfielder Ty Thompson's header,

also saved by Blechette. Senior
midfielder and captain JJ Koval
missed two headers just wide of
the post, while freshman forward
Jordan Morris blazed a volley just
over the bar. None of that would
matter anymore, it seemed, as
Stanford appeared to have suc
cumbed once again to a worrying
trend of allowing a late goal to
doom its chances.

The Card fought on, and in
that fight came a moment that
could only be described as magical:
90th minute, 20 seconds left in
regulation. Junior wingback Jimmy
Callinan sent in one last hopeful
cross and Hutchins swooped in, in
a penalty box that seemed so for

eign to him, and got a headed flick
on. The ball fell to junior forward
Zach Batteer's feet, and he lashed
a left-footed volley into the bottom
corner. At first he was shocked,
and then an expression of pure joy
creased his face. 1-1. Pandemoni
um.
Obviously, the game was not
over. Both sides had their chances
in extra time, with a Perez shot be
ing deflected just past the post and
junior Connor Hunsicker's volley
saved by Hutchins. For Stanford,
Batteer had another volley pushed
away, while Koval flashed wide a
volley that seemed destined for the
bottom corner. Unfortunately for
the blood pressures of the crowd

in attendance at Cagan Stadium,
the deadlock could not be broken
so the game went to penalties.
To say penalties started badly
for Stanford would be an under
statement. Both Koval and sopho
more winger Aaron Kovar saw
their penalties saved by Blechette,
meaning LMU took a 1-0 lead after
two rounds of penalties, thanks to
junior defender Craig Nitti slotting
his penalty past Hutchins.
Stanford, however, would not
give in. Sophomore centreback
Brandon Vincent and Morris con
verted the next two penalties,
while LMU's Perez saw his cannon
back off the post.

That made it 2-2 after four

rounds. Up stepped Hutchins. Of
course, he slotted his penalty into
the bottom left corner: 3-2. Then,
he turned around and saved Hun
sicker 's penalty, diving low to his
left to give Stanford a 3-2 victory
on penalties.
There was pandemonium
again, and in the center of it all was
an amazed Drew Hutchins, trying
desperately to savor this moment.
Stanford lived to fight another day.

The Cardinal will travel to 15th
seeded Cal State Northridge (15-6-1)
on Sunday and hopes to continue its
charmed tournament life.
