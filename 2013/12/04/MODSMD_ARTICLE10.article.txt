## From Isolationism to Interventionism and Isolated Interventionism 
### Nick Ahamed 
Every president since Teddy
Roosevelt has fought for an
expanded legislative role for
their office.

But in foreign policy, they do not
need to play second fiddle; Barack
Obama has seized that right. Under
his leadership, we've seen engage
ment with Libya, Iran and Syria;
the end of wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan; and a pivot to Asia.
This is not to mention his Nobel
Peace Prize.
But what's less clear is how
presidents should navigate foreign
policy. Unlike with their domestic
agenda, presidents need not rely on
a dismally uninformed populace for
guidance. Now they are torn be
tween America's tradition of isola
tionism and the demands of an in
creasingly connected world.
"It is our true policy to steer
clear of permanent alliances with
any portion of the foreign world,"
Washington promulgated in his
Farewell Address, starting our iso
lationist tradition. Five years later,
Jefferson confirmed this view, en
dorsing "peace, commerce, and
honest friendship with all nations,
entangling alliances with none."
This theme continued through
much of our early history. Woodrow
Wilson was reluctant to enter
World War I. Roosevelt too claimed
he needed a polarizing event to

move the country to war (which
came on Dec. 7,1941).
However, the end of WWII saw
a change in the global dynamic. The
American giant, awoken by war,
vied for hegemony, necessitating
active involvement in world affairs.
Prom funding the United Nations
to supporting client states, this
manifested itself clearly and often.
Yet, these manifestations were
largely overextensions of our pow
er. In Korea, initial successes
turned into repeated defeats as we
shifted to offense. In Vietnam, our
gradual buildup was to no avail;
unified Vietnam became communist
in 1976.
The end of the Cold War
brought this trend to an abrupt
stop. Bush I ensured that about
face in the lead up to the Gulf War
by following the Powell-Weinberger
Doctrine. That conflict was the an
ti-Vietnam: short, victorious and
limited.
Noting that success, Clinton
continued to follow the doctrine. As
Samantha Power details in "A
Problem from Hell," Clinton had to
be dragged into involvement in So
malia and resisted action in Rwan
da.
But when his administration did
finally act to stop genocide, it was
limited and tactful. In Kosovo, NA
TO airstrikes last 78 days and

forced the end of the war.
Bush II totally ignored the les
sons of his father. Within 26 months
of taking office, President Bush had
committed us to three intervention
ist wars: an initially limited war in
Afghanistan, an invasion of Iraq
both part of a worldwide war on
terror.
Because these protracted wars
carried the stigma of Vietnam,
Obama campaigned on ending
these wars, like Eisenhower and
Nixon before him. Through the
"Obama Doctrine," he's rolled back
the aggressive and traditional in
terventionism of his predecessor by
focusing on diplomacy and limited
military engagements. This shift to
a new form of "isolated" interven
tionism relied on drones and Spe
cial Forces, along the lines of the
bin Laden, al-Liby and Ikrima
raids.
But what does this history tell
us about intervention in Syria?
A key lesson is that both sides
must be forced into a position
where a negotiated settlement will
be self-enforcing. More simply put:
The balance of power must last be
yond the war. But when the United
States is a key participant in the
fighting, we invariably leave after it
ends, disrupting the delicate bal
ance. Thus, acting not only on be
half of, but instead of, our allies
as we did in Korea, Vietnam and
Iraq II reaching that settlement
becomes impossible.
Small acts of ancillary support
isolated interventions are a
much stronger model. This has the
added benefit of continuing our
support for self-determination. In
the end, the Kosovar people had to
decide for themselves who is to
govern. Libyans continue that dis
cussion still.
No one can say Syrians haven't
fought this war on their own. Pres
ident Obama abandoned a plan of
isolated interventionism by focus
ing only on removing chemical
weapons. While this was a step to
wards a equalizing the balance of
power, it was not enough. Remov
ing these weapons does not do
enough to create the conditions for
a settlement.
First, we should focus on arm
ing and training the Free Syrian
Army, which is poorly equipped
with AK-47s and RPG-7s.
Second, we should impose a no
fly zone. With no air support, the
opposition forces have had to aban
don vehicles and must hide in cities.
Restricting al-Assad's air power
will empower a more effective op
position to move away from civilian
dominated areas, lowering collater
al damage.
It is time for an isolated inter
vention.

much of our early history. Woodrow
Wilson was reluctant to enter
World War I. Roosevelt too claimed
he needed a polarizing event to

move the country to war (which
came on Dec. 7,1941).
However, the end of WWII saw
a change in the global dynamic. The
American giant, awoken by war,
vied for hegemony, necessitating
active involvement in world affairs.
Prom funding the United Nations
to supporting client states, this
manifested itself clearly and often.
Yet, these manifestations were
largely overextensions of our pow
er. In Korea, initial successes
turned into repeated defeats as we
shifted to offense. In Vietnam, our
gradual buildup was to no avail;
unified Vietnam became communist
in 1976.
The end of the Cold War
brought this trend to an abrupt
stop. Bush I ensured that about
face in the lead up to the Gulf War
by following the Powell-Weinberger
Doctrine. That conflict was the an
ti-Vietnam: short, victorious and
limited.
Noting that success, Clinton
continued to follow the doctrine. As
Samantha Power details in "A
Problem from Hell," Clinton had to
be dragged into involvement in So
malia and resisted action in Rwan
da.
But when his administration did
finally act to stop genocide, it was
limited and tactful. In Kosovo, NA
TO airstrikes last 78 days and

forced the end of the war.
Bush II totally ignored the les
sons of his father. Within 26 months
of taking office, President Bush had
committed us to three intervention
ist wars: an initially limited war in
Afghanistan, an invasion of Iraq
both part of a worldwide war on
terror.
Because these protracted wars
carried the stigma of Vietnam,
Obama campaigned on ending
these wars, like Eisenhower and
Nixon before him. Through the
"Obama Doctrine," he's rolled back
the aggressive and traditional in
terventionism of his predecessor by
focusing on diplomacy and limited
military engagements. This shift to
a new form of "isolated" interven
tionism relied on drones and Spe
cial Forces, along the lines of the
bin Laden, al-Liby and Ikrima
raids.
But what does this history tell
us about intervention in Syria?
A key lesson is that both sides
must be forced into a position
where a negotiated settlement will
be self-enforcing. More simply put:
The balance of power must last be
yond the war. But when the United
States is a key participant in the
fighting, we invariably leave after it
ends, disrupting the delicate bal
ance. Thus, acting not only on be
half of, but instead of, our allies
as we did in Korea, Vietnam and
Iraq II reaching that settlement
becomes impossible.
Small acts of ancillary support
isolated interventions are a
much stronger model. This has the
added benefit of continuing our
support for self-determination. In
the end, the Kosovar people had to
decide for themselves who is to
govern. Libyans continue that dis
cussion still.
No one can say Syrians haven't
fought this war on their own. Pres
ident Obama abandoned a plan of
isolated interventionism by focus
ing only on removing chemical
weapons. While this was a step to
wards a equalizing the balance of
power, it was not enough. Remov
ing these weapons does not do
enough to create the conditions for
a settlement.
First, we should focus on arm
ing and training the Free Syrian
Army, which is poorly equipped
with AK-47s and RPG-7s.
Second, we should impose a no
fly zone. With no air support, the
opposition forces have had to aban
don vehicles and must hide in cities.
Restricting al-Assad's air power
will empower a more effective op
position to move away from civilian
dominated areas, lowering collater
al damage.
It is time for an isolated inter
vention.
