## Anti-Transgender Campaign Shows Lack of Awareness and Education 
### 
The acronym LGBT (short for
lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender) has largely sur
passed "gay" as the socially accept
able term for referring to sexual
and gender minorities. LGBT
sounds newer, younger and more
progressive. But how much atten
tion is really paid to the fourth let
ter? Many newspaper articles
speak of LGBT issues while only
enumerating "gays and lesbians" as
the relevant population. An esti
mated 52 percent of Americans
support gay marriage, but how
many of those people have an
awareness of transgender people
and their histories, challenges, or
victories?
A transgender person is some
one whose gender identity does not
correspond with the sex they were
assigned at birth. For example, a
transgender woman might have
been assigned "male" at birth but
identify as a woman, and some peo
ple identify outside of the male/fe
male gender binary entirely.
Currently in the state of Califor
nia, transgender students' rights
are in contention. Six weeks after
the Supreme Court of the United
States decided in favor of gay mar
riage in two landmark cases, Cali
fornia governor Jerry Brown
signed into law the School Success
and Opportunity Act (SSOA).
SSOA states that all students have
the right to participate in gender
segregated activities and use gen
der-segregated facilities according
to their gender identity. It was au
thored in response to reports that
transgender students were being
prohibited from using gendered
restroom facilities and appropri
ately participating in activities
such as sports or physical educa
tion. The law is set to go into effect

on Jan. 1, 2014.
This law addresses a dire need
in our schools. The National Trans
gender Discrimination Survey pub
lished in 2011 found that 78 percent
of transgender students were ha
rassed in K-12 education and 15
percent left school due to harass
ment. Exclusionary policies have
deep-rooted effects on students.
The National Center for Lesbian
Rights explains that "being singled
out and treated differently than

their peers is detrimental to a
transgender student's psychologi
cal, social and academic wellbeing
and development."
Although this legislation may
only be a small step in countering
transphobia, with SSOA transgen
der students will no longer need to
worry that their gender identity
will be denied by the school itself.
When it comes to bathrooms, gym
classes and sports teams, transgen
der boys will be treated like other
boys and transgender girls like oth
er girls. Will it cause trouble? Los
Angeles Unified School District,
the largest district in the state of
California, implemented a similar
policy in 2005 and has "encountered
nothing but positive results."
Unfortunately, there has been
considerable backlash to this law.
The National Organization for

Marriage, the Pacific Justice Insti
tute, the Capitol Resource Institute
and Faith and Public Policy have
bankrolled the conservative coali
tion Privacy for All Students to use
California's referendum to put the
law on the ballot next year. As of
Nov. 10, Privacy for All Students
has gathered 620,000 signatures,
largely by taking advantage of the
public's lack of awareness about
transgender people. One organiza
tion's homepage prominently fea-

tares a misleading banner urging
readers to stop the "Co-Ed Bath
room Bill," a line of argument that
has been used extensively to scare
voters into signing the petition for
the referendum effort. Another ex
ample of scare tactics used by Pri
vacy for All Students are the Pacif
ic Justice Institute's publicly admit
ted lies about a transgender stu
dent harassing classmates while us
ing the women's restroom.
Until widespread awareness is
raised about transgender issues,
the public will continue to be misled
by conservative groups. If SSOA
ends up on the ballot, it will only
contribute to the damage done by
years of silence around transgen
der issues. (As of press time, it is
not yet clear if the referendum ef
fort was successful.) But the silence
must stop somewhere, and at Stan

ford University we can do our part.
Stanford has a visible and grow
ing transgender population, and it
is our responsibility as community
members to become educated
about transgender issues. Chal
lenge yourself to think critically
about how our society systematical
ly discriminates against those who
do not conform to gender norms.
Access the countless resources
available to you on and off campus
in order to learn more about your
transgender peers.
When your dorm or student
group has a meeting, ask people to
state their preferred gender pro
nouns so as not to assume the gen
der identity of any community
members. Many queer-specific stu
dent groups include preferred gen
der pronouns as part of group in
troductions, but other student
groups including Stanford NAACP
and the writing group Spoken
Word Collective also have adopted
the practice.
Take action not because you
want to be politically correct. Take
action because your efforts will
make Stanford a safer place for all
students. Take action because with
out widespread effort in our society,
legislation protecting transgender
people will be overturned too easily
with malicious misinformation.
We ask you to broaden your en
thusiasm for lesbian, gay and bisex
ual rights and stand beside trans
gender students as well. Californi
a's students deserve SSOA, and all
people deserve a world where they
can express their gender identity
authentically and safely.

the public will continue to be misled
by conservative groups. If SSOA
ends up on the ballot, it will only
contribute to the damage done by
years of silence around transgen
der issues. (As of press time, it is
not yet clear if the referendum ef
fort was successful.) But the silence
must stop somewhere, and at Stan

ford University we can do our part.
Stanford has a visible and grow
ing transgender population, and it
is our responsibility as community
members to become educated
about transgender issues. Chal
lenge yourself to think critically
about how our society systematical
ly discriminates against those who
do not conform to gender norms.
Access the countless resources
available to you on and off campus
in order to learn more about your
transgender peers.
When your dorm or student
group has a meeting, ask people to
state their preferred gender pro
nouns so as not to assume the gen
der identity of any community
members. Many queer-specific stu
dent groups include preferred gen
der pronouns as part of group in
troductions, but other student
groups including Stanford NAACP
and the writing group Spoken
Word Collective also have adopted
the practice.
Take action not because you
want to be politically correct. Take
action because your efforts will
make Stanford a safer place for all
students. Take action because with
out widespread effort in our society,
legislation protecting transgender
people will be overturned too easily
with malicious misinformation.
We ask you to broaden your en
thusiasm for lesbian, gay and bisex
ual rights and stand beside trans
gender students as well. Californi
a's students deserve SSOA, and all
people deserve a world where they
can express their gender identity
authentically and safely.

Currently, in California,
transgender students' rights
are in contention.
The acronym LGBT (short for
lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender) has largely sur
passed "gay" as the socially accept
able term for referring to sexual
and gender minorities. LGBT
sounds newer, younger and more
progressive. But how much atten
tion is really paid to the fourth let
ter? Many newspaper articles
speak of LGBT issues while only
enumerating "gays and lesbians" as
the relevant population. An esti
mated 52 percent of Americans
support gay marriage, but how
many of those people have an
awareness of transgender people
and their histories, challenges, or
victories?
A transgender person is some
one whose gender identity does not
correspond with the sex they were
assigned at birth. For example, a
transgender woman might have
been assigned "male" at birth but
identify as a woman, and some peo
ple identify outside of the male/fe
male gender binary entirely.
Currently in the state of Califor
nia, transgender students' rights
are in contention. Six weeks after
the Supreme Court of the United
States decided in favor of gay mar
riage in two landmark cases, Cali
fornia governor Jerry Brown
signed into law the School Success
and Opportunity Act (SSOA).
SSOA states that all students have
the right to participate in gender
segregated activities and use gen
der-segregated facilities according
to their gender identity. It was au
thored in response to reports that
transgender students were being
prohibited from using gendered
restroom facilities and appropri
ately participating in activities
such as sports or physical educa
tion. The law is set to go into effect

on Jan. 1, 2014.
This law addresses a dire need
in our schools. The National Trans
gender Discrimination Survey pub
lished in 2011 found that 78 percent
of transgender students were ha
rassed in K-12 education and 15
percent left school due to harass
ment. Exclusionary policies have
deep-rooted effects on students.
The National Center for Lesbian
Rights explains that "being singled
out and treated differently than

their peers is detrimental to a
transgender student's psychologi
cal, social and academic wellbeing
and development."
Although this legislation may
only be a small step in countering
transphobia, with SSOA transgen
der students will no longer need to
worry that their gender identity
will be denied by the school itself.
When it comes to bathrooms, gym
classes and sports teams, transgen
der boys will be treated like other
boys and transgender girls like oth
er girls. Will it cause trouble? Los
Angeles Unified School District,
the largest district in the state of
California, implemented a similar
policy in 2005 and has "encountered
nothing but positive results."
Unfortunately, there has been
considerable backlash to this law.
The National Organization for

Marriage, the Pacific Justice Insti
tute, the Capitol Resource Institute
and Faith and Public Policy have
bankrolled the conservative coali
tion Privacy for All Students to use
California's referendum to put the
law on the ballot next year. As of
Nov. 10, Privacy for All Students
has gathered 620,000 signatures,
largely by taking advantage of the
public's lack of awareness about
transgender people. One organiza
tion's homepage prominently fea-

tares a misleading banner urging
readers to stop the "Co-Ed Bath
room Bill," a line of argument that
has been used extensively to scare
voters into signing the petition for
the referendum effort. Another ex
ample of scare tactics used by Pri
vacy for All Students are the Pacif
ic Justice Institute's publicly admit
ted lies about a transgender stu
dent harassing classmates while us
ing the women's restroom.
Until widespread awareness is
raised about transgender issues,
the public will continue to be misled
by conservative groups. If SSOA
ends up on the ballot, it will only
contribute to the damage done by
