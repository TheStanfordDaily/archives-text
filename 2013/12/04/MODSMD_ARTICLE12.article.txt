## DESERT STORM CARDINAL READY TO DEFEND PAC-12 TITLE 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Stanford doesn't always win, but
when it does, it wins by making defen
sive stands.
The No. 7 Cardinal (10-2, 7-2 Pac
-12) edged Notre Dame 27-20 (8-4) on
Senior Night, as fifth-year senior in
side linebacker Shayne Skov and the

Cardinal defense held Irish quarter
back Tommy Rees and company to 22
yards of total offense in the fourth
quarter. Stanford will now look to de
fend its Pac-12 title and earn a second
consecutive Rose Bowl berth when it
travels to Tempe, Ariz., to battle No.
11 Arizona State in the Pac-12 Cham
pionship Game on Dec. 7.

Not only did the victory allow
Stanford to pick up its fourth consec
utive 10-win season prior to 2009,
the Cardinal only had three such sea
sons in its history but it also
marked the first time in the pro
gram's history that Stanford has
beaten five consecutive ranked teams
at home.
Senior running back Tyler
Gaffney finished his last game at
Stanford Stadium with 189 rushing
yards a career high that gave
Gaffney his eighth 100-yard game of
the season while junior cornerback
Wayne Lyons picked off Rees twice
on the last two Irish drives to seal the
game and extend the Cardinal's home
win streak to 16. The Cardinal seniors
finished their college careers with
just only one home loss, the 53-30 loss
to Oregon in 2011.
"I can't say enough about our sen
iors," said head coach David Shaw.
