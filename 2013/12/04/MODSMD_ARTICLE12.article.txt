## DESERT STORM CARDINAL READY TO DEFEND PAC-12 TITLE 
### GEORGE CHEN EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
Stanford doesn't always win, but
when it does, it wins by making defen
sive stands.
The No. 7 Cardinal (10-2, 7-2 Pac
-12) edged Notre Dame 27-20 (8-4) on
Senior Night, as fifth-year senior in
side linebacker Shayne Skov and the

Cardinal defense held Irish quarter
back Tommy Rees and company to 22
yards of total offense in the fourth
quarter. Stanford will now look to de
fend its Pac-12 title and earn a second
consecutive Rose Bowl berth when it
travels to Tempe, Ariz., to battle No.
11 Arizona State in the Pac-12 Cham
pionship Game on Dec. 7.

Not only did the victory allow
Stanford to pick up its fourth consec
utive 10-win season prior to 2009,
the Cardinal only had three such sea
sons in its history but it also
marked the first time in the pro
gram's history that Stanford has
beaten five consecutive ranked teams
at home.
Senior running back Tyler
Gaffney finished his last game at
Stanford Stadium with 189 rushing
yards a career high that gave
Gaffney his eighth 100-yard game of
the season while junior cornerback
Wayne Lyons picked off Rees twice
on the last two Irish drives to seal the
game and extend the Cardinal's home
win streak to 16. The Cardinal seniors
finished their college careers with
just only one home loss, the 53-30 loss
to Oregon in 2011.
"I can't say enough about our sen
iors," said head coach David Shaw.

LUIS AGUILAR/The Stanford Daily
Junior cornerback Wayne Lyons (above) was able to seal Saturday's Cardinal victory over Notre Dame
with two late interceptions to send the Cardinal into the Pac-12 Championship on a winning note.
"[They] put this program among
the elite. You have to say it now: We
are among the elite, to have this
many 10-win seasons in a row."
The Irish struck first with a 21-
yard field goal from Kyle Brindza,
but junior quarterback Kevin
Hogan found a wide-open Devon
Cajuste in the end zone for a 16-
yard touchdown and Gaffney
punched it in from 1-yard out early
in the second quarter to give the
Cardinal a 14-3 lead. Hauling in
three receptions for 75 yards and a
touchdown on the night, Cajuste
played a major role in the Cardinal
passing game for the first time
since he suffered a knee injury
against UCLA in October.
Hogan, However, could not re
peat his career-best performance in
last weekend's Big Game, at least
not from start to finish. The junior
went 12 of 18 for 158 yards and two
interceptions and overthrew open
targets one of his misfires in the
second quarter resulted in an inter
ception that shifted the game's mo
mentum away from the Cardinal.
Still, Stanford's defense executed
its bend-but-don't-break approach
well enough to hold the Irish to a
short field goal late in the first half
to bring the score to 14-6 at half
time.
"[Notre Dame] is really good up
front," Shaw said. "We knew we
had to keep pounding. We knew we
had to keep fighting. We knew they
were going to come back."
The Irish came back all right.
Stanford opened the second half
with a seven-play, 76-yard touch
down drive capped by senior run
ning back Anthony Wilkerson's 20-
yard scamper on third-and-9, but
Rees answered on the next drive
with a 4-yard touchdown pass to TJ

Jones. Though the Irish running
game sputtered Stanford out
gained Notre Dame 261 yards to 64
on the ground its offensive line
held its ground against the Cardi
nal's pass rush.
After the Cardinal had to settle
for a 27-yard Jordan Williamson
field goal, Rees threw his second
touchdown of the night on the ensu
ing possession with a 14-yard pass
to wideout DaVaris Daniels to bring
the Irish within three at 24-21.
"I think [Rees] is a little under
rated," said senior safety Ed
Reynolds, who recorded seven
tackles on the night. "He's a very
good quarterback, smart quarter
back ... It was kind of a chess match
there. He's a great competitor, and
he can make all the throws."
Williamson tacked on one more
field goal to set up Stanford's
fourth-quarter defensive stand.
The Cardinal offense didn't do its
defensive counterpart any favors
when Hogan was picked off by cor
nerback Bennett Jackson at the
Irish 21, but Lyons made his two in
terceptions to quash the Irish
comeback. Lyons' big plays served
as a fitting redemption for his mis
take earlier in the third quarter,
when he bit on a head fake that al
lowed Rees to find a wide-open
Daniels for the 14-yard touchdown.
"Sometimes you have to have a
short memory because [after] any
small movement or small mess-up,
big plays happen," Lyons said.
"Sometimes you have to let those
things happen and bounce back
from them."
The Cardinal will now turn its
attention to Arizona State, which
blew out Arizona 58-21 Saturday
night to clinch home-field advan
tage for the Pac-12 Championship
Game.
"We had ups and downs, we had
bumps and bruises," Shaw said.
"We lost some guys, we had some
guys step up. We lost a couple
games. But when you look up, we're

where we wanted to be, a 10-win
team in the Pac-12 Championship

Game, and it's going to be a heck of
a game next week."
The Sun Devils fell to Stanford
42-28 in their third game of the sea
son and also lost to Notre Dame 37-
34, but have won seven straight
games since then. Under head
coach Todd Graham, who was
named the Pac-12 coach of the year
on Monday, Arizona State has yet to
drop a game at home this season
thanks to an explosive offense that
has averaged 49 points per game at
Sun Devil Stadium.
Arizona State quarterback Tay
lor Kelly played his way into a spot
on the all-Pac-12 second team with
3,337 passing yards and 27 touch
downs. Kelly's arsenal of weapons
includes wide receiver Jaelen
Strong, who comes into Saturday's
game with seven 100-yard receiving
games on the year. Arizona State
will be without its top running back,
Marion Grice, an injury that may
limit its running game. The Cardi
nal defense held the Sun Devils to
just 50 yards on the ground back in
September.
Stanford successfully contained
star defensive tackle Will Sutton
the first time around, but the fifth
year senior played much better in
the back-half of the season eight
out of his 10.5 tackles for loss came
in the last six game to earn Pac
-12 defensive player of the year hon
ors. Against Utah in early Novem
ber, the versatile Sutton even
recorded an interception.
"[The Pac-12 Championship
Game] means everything," Gaffney
said. "Being able to play with these
guys day in, day out is why I came
back."
Stanford and Arizona State bat

on Saturday. Kickoff is scheduled

Not only did the victory allow
Stanford to pick up its fourth consec
utive 10-win season prior to 2009,
the Cardinal only had three such sea
sons in its history but it also
marked the first time in the pro
gram's history that Stanford has
beaten five consecutive ranked teams
at home.
Senior running back Tyler
Gaffney finished his last game at
Stanford Stadium with 189 rushing
yards a career high that gave
Gaffney his eighth 100-yard game of
the season while junior cornerback
Wayne Lyons picked off Rees twice
on the last two Irish drives to seal the
game and extend the Cardinal's home
win streak to 16. The Cardinal seniors
finished their college careers with
just only one home loss, the 53-30 loss
to Oregon in 2011.
"I can't say enough about our sen
iors," said head coach David Shaw.

LUIS AGUILAR/The Stanford Daily
Junior cornerback Wayne Lyons (above) was able to seal Saturday's Cardinal victory over Notre Dame
with two late interceptions to send the Cardinal into the Pac-12 Championship on a winning note.
"[They] put this program among
the elite. You have to say it now: We
are among the elite, to have this
many 10-win seasons in a row."
The Irish struck first with a 21-
yard field goal from Kyle Brindza,
but junior quarterback Kevin
Hogan found a wide-open Devon
Cajuste in the end zone for a 16-
yard touchdown and Gaffney
punched it in from 1-yard out early
in the second quarter to give the
Cardinal a 14-3 lead. Hauling in
three receptions for 75 yards and a
touchdown on the night, Cajuste
played a major role in the Cardinal
passing game for the first time
since he suffered a knee injury
against UCLA in October.
Hogan, However, could not re
peat his career-best performance in
last weekend's Big Game, at least
not from start to finish. The junior
went 12 of 18 for 158 yards and two
interceptions and overthrew open
targets one of his misfires in the
second quarter resulted in an inter
ception that shifted the game's mo
mentum away from the Cardinal.
Still, Stanford's defense executed
its bend-but-don't-break approach
well enough to hold the Irish to a
short field goal late in the first half
to bring the score to 14-6 at half
time.
"[Notre Dame] is really good up
front," Shaw said. "We knew we
had to keep pounding. We knew we
had to keep fighting. We knew they
were going to come back."
The Irish came back all right.
Stanford opened the second half
with a seven-play, 76-yard touch
down drive capped by senior run
ning back Anthony Wilkerson's 20-
yard scamper on third-and-9, but
Rees answered on the next drive
with a 4-yard touchdown pass to TJ

Jones. Though the Irish running
game sputtered Stanford out
gained Notre Dame 261 yards to 64
on the ground its offensive line
held its ground against the Cardi
nal's pass rush.
After the Cardinal had to settle
for a 27-yard Jordan Williamson
field goal, Rees threw his second
touchdown of the night on the ensu
ing possession with a 14-yard pass
to wideout DaVaris Daniels to bring
the Irish within three at 24-21.
"I think [Rees] is a little under
rated," said senior safety Ed
Reynolds, who recorded seven
tackles on the night. "He's a very
good quarterback, smart quarter
back ... It was kind of a chess match
there. He's a great competitor, and
he can make all the throws."
Williamson tacked on one more
field goal to set up Stanford's
fourth-quarter defensive stand.
The Cardinal offense didn't do its
defensive counterpart any favors
when Hogan was picked off by cor
nerback Bennett Jackson at the
Irish 21, but Lyons made his two in
terceptions to quash the Irish
comeback. Lyons' big plays served
as a fitting redemption for his mis
take earlier in the third quarter,
when he bit on a head fake that al
lowed Rees to find a wide-open
Daniels for the 14-yard touchdown.
"Sometimes you have to have a
short memory because [after] any
small movement or small mess-up,
big plays happen," Lyons said.
"Sometimes you have to let those
things happen and bounce back
from them."
The Cardinal will now turn its
attention to Arizona State, which
blew out Arizona 58-21 Saturday
night to clinch home-field advan
tage for the Pac-12 Championship
Game.
"We had ups and downs, we had
bumps and bruises," Shaw said.
"We lost some guys, we had some
guys step up. We lost a couple
games. But when you look up, we're

where we wanted to be, a 10-win
team in the Pac-12 Championship

Game, and it's going to be a heck of
a game next week."
The Sun Devils fell to Stanford
42-28 in their third game of the sea
son and also lost to Notre Dame 37-
34, but have won seven straight
games since then. Under head
coach Todd Graham, who was
named the Pac-12 coach of the year
on Monday, Arizona State has yet to
drop a game at home this season
thanks to an explosive offense that
has averaged 49 points per game at
Sun Devil Stadium.
Arizona State quarterback Tay
lor Kelly played his way into a spot
on the all-Pac-12 second team with
3,337 passing yards and 27 touch
downs. Kelly's arsenal of weapons
includes wide receiver Jaelen
Strong, who comes into Saturday's
game with seven 100-yard receiving
games on the year. Arizona State
will be without its top running back,
Marion Grice, an injury that may
limit its running game. The Cardi
nal defense held the Sun Devils to
just 50 yards on the ground back in
September.
Stanford successfully contained
star defensive tackle Will Sutton
the first time around, but the fifth
year senior played much better in
the back-half of the season eight
out of his 10.5 tackles for loss came
in the last six game to earn Pac
-12 defensive player of the year hon
ors. Against Utah in early Novem
ber, the versatile Sutton even
recorded an interception.
"[The Pac-12 Championship
Game] means everything," Gaffney
said. "Being able to play with these
guys day in, day out is why I came
back."
Stanford and Arizona State bat
tle for Pac-12 supremacy in Tempe
on Saturday. Kickoff is scheduled
for 4:45 p.m. PST.
