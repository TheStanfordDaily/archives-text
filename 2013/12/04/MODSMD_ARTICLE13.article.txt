## REVISITING THE SUN DEVILS 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Stanford is now on a colli
sion course with Arizona
State for the Dec. 7 Pac-12
Championship Game. When
the Cardinal met the Sun
Devils in September, it
jumped out to a 29-0 half
time lead before letting ASU
back into the game in the sec
ond half We asked football
writers David, Cohn, Do-Hy
oung Park and Winston Shi:
What can Stanford take from
its I*2-28 win earlier in the
season?
David: I believe that Stanford
can derive some confidence from
September's win against ASU
heading into Saturday's
matchup. In the three meaningful
quarters of that football game,
the Cardinal harassed Sun Devil
quarterback Taylor Kelly,

blocked two punts and made new
ly minted Pac-12 Coach of the
Year Todd Graham look lost.
Stanford didn't just beat the Sun
Devils; the Card embarrassed
ASU and showed all of us that it
is more than capable of beating
the Sun Devils, even in Tempe.
In addition, I believe the Car
dinal has a lot of motivation head
ing into this game many peo
ple are proclaiming the Sun Dev
ils as the favorite in this contest,
rather than the defending confer
ence champion Cardinal, which
has also made three consecutive
BCS bowls. Even Vegas doubts
the Card, as ASU is about a
three-point favorite in most
places.
Stanford has always played its
best football when its play has
been criticized or its chances of
winning a contest are questioned.
To name a few examples, as the
underdog, the Cardinal knocked

off Oregon in both 2012 and
2013 and took down USC in
2012. I will always remem
ber David Shaw's quote at
the Rose Bowl trophy pres
entation ceremony, when
Chris Fowler asked him
about seeking national re
spect: "We still feel like we
don't have it." As Fowler
brilliantly pointed out later
on in the conversation, Stan
ford likes to play with a chip
on its shoulder and prove
people wrong.
Do: Next to nothing. I don't
believe that the September
win translates well to the
Pac-12 Championship Game
because the circumstances
surrounding the two games
are so different.
For one, the September
meeting was all the way
back in week four, when
teams had not yet fully
gelled, and Arizona State es
pecially had not asserted it
self as a Pac-12 South power.
At this point in the season,
teams are supposed to be at
their best after a full season
of play as a unit. Arizona
State has rebounded excep
tionally well at the end of the
season after early losses to
Stanford and Notre Dame,
while both of Stanford's loss
es have come later in the
season.
In addition, both of these
teams have drastic
home/away swings that defi
nitely cannot be overlooked
in a game of this magnitude.
Both of these teams have
been very flat outside of
their home stadiums, and
the fact that this game will
be played at Sun Devil Sta
dium is going to have big im
plications. Stanford and
ASU have combined for four
losses this season, all four of
which have come away from
home. The Sun Devils score
an average of 15 more points
in home games than in road
games. Meanwhile, Stanford
has been far from its domi
nant self in losses at USC
and Utah and unexpectedly
close games at Army and
Oregon State.
While Stanford was
clearly the better team in
the early-season victory
against ASU, that game is
now ancient history. The
Cardinal had a great plan to
neutralize Will Sutton and
was able to run all over the
Sun Devils. But in a repeat
matchup, expect ASU to be
much more prepared on de
fense, while Kevin Hogan

has had more than his share
of struggles on the road.
ASU will be ready, and ASU
will be hungry.

Winston: I still see the early
game as instructive. It's
hard to imagine that the
same sort of beatdown is go
ing to happen again, if only
because Arizona State has to
regress to the mean and
given its results later this
season, ASU certainly has.
However, ASU's players are
still the same players, and
its coaches are still the same
coaches.
Arizona State has done
well since the Stanford deba
cle, and Arizona, Washing
ton, and USC are three very
impressive scalps. But do
the Sun Devils have the sort
of signature win that Stan
ford has? The Sun Devils
dodged Cal on the schedule,
which I'm sure they regret,
but they also missed Oregon.
ASU's only game against
elite competition resulted in
a humiliation that we all saw
and loved.
What could Arizona State
do against Stanford? The
Sun Devils couldn't run the
ball up the middle. Taylor
Kelly scrambled well and
had success throwing quick
screens, but ever since
Stanford started blitzing
screeners, teams haven't re
ally pressed the outside
passing game. UCLA went
away from the screens.
Notre Dame went away
from the screens. USC went
away from the screens. Ore
gon went away from the
screens.
I watched most of Ari
zona State's annihilation of
Arizona. There were some
very good plays, to be sure.
You don't take out a team
like that without deserving
to win. But Arizona still had
some success. It more than
held its own in the trenches
on both sides of the ball; the
Wildcats simply shot them
selves in the foot in epic
fashion. With quality line
play, Stanford will prove that
reports of its demise have
been most premature in
deed.

Do-Hyoung Park thinks the
Cardinal can take "next to
nothing" aivay from its ear
ly season victory over ASU.
To tell him and the rest of the
crew why Stanford's shut
down of Will Sutton proves
he shouldn't be the confer
ence's defensive player of the
year, contact Do-Hyoung
