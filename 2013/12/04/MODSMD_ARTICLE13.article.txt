## REVISITING THE SUN DEVILS 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
Stanford is now on a colli
sion course with Arizona
State for the Dec. 7 Pac-12
Championship Game. When
the Cardinal met the Sun
Devils in September, it
jumped out to a 29-0 half
time lead before letting ASU
back into the game in the sec

What can Stanford take from
its I*2-28 win earlier in the
season?
David: I believe that Stanford
can derive some confidence from
September's win against ASU
heading into Saturday's
matchup. In the three meaningful
quarters of that football game,
the Cardinal harassed Sun Devil
quarterback Taylor Kelly,

blocked two punts and made new

Year Todd Graham look lost.
Stanford didn't just beat the Sun
Devils; the Card embarrassed
ASU and showed all of us that it
is more than capable of beating
the Sun Devils, even in Tempe.
In addition, I believe the Car
dinal has a lot of motivation head

ple are proclaiming the Sun Dev
ils as the favorite in this contest,
rather than the defending confer
ence champion Cardinal, which
has also made three consecutive
BCS bowls. Even Vegas doubts
the Card, as ASU is about a
three-point favorite in most
places.
Stanford has always played its
best football when its play has
been criticized or its chances of
winning a contest are questioned.
To name a few examples, as the
underdog, the Cardinal knocked
