# INSTANT REPLAY
## FUN WITH THE RUN 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford beat Notre Dame on
Saturday for the fourth time in the
teams' last five contests. The 27-20
result was surprisingly close
Stanford had been favored to win by
over two touchdowns but a win is
a win, and the Cardinal is now 14-5
in one-possession games since David
Shaw took over as head coach.
The Cardinal is very effective at
beating its opponents into exhaus
tion with a consistent running game.
Against evenly matched opponents,
fatigue late in the game is often the
deciding factor. Conversely, when
Stanford has lost, it has typically
been when opponents have stacked
the tackle box with eight players to
overwhelm Stanford's run-blocking
schemes. Quite frankly, at some
point, a team can only punish eight
man boxes by throwing the ball;
while people love to condemn pass
happy teams for not being able to
run the ball, the same holds for run
heavy teams that cannot throw it.
Kevin Hogan was not elite on
Saturday night, throwing two inter
ceptions, but he was good enough
(8.8 yards per attempt) to make
passing a viable option. That, in
turn, opened up opportunities in the
run game such as Anthony Wilker
son's 20-yard touchdown run in the
third quarter.
Stanford was facing third-and-9,
so Notre Dame had to be thinking
"pass" anyway. But the Cardinal was
in the Notre Dame red zone, and a
decent run might set up fourth-and
manageable. Even if the run failed, a

field goal was a reasonable consola
tion prize. Notre Dame defensive co
ordinator Bob Diaco opted to hedge
his bets and put his strong safety ($)
at an intermediate level of the de
fense— not inside the tackle box,
but close enough to hopefully avert a
disaster. However, Notre Dame
could not outnumber Stanford at the
point of attack.
Against this alignment, David
Shaw called a very interesting run
play: a read-option trap. (Wide re
ceivers and cornerbacks have been
omitted for clarity.)
The read-option component of
the play was quite typical. Quarter
back Kevin Hogan (Q) read the
backside defensive end (blue trian
gle); if the end crashed the handoff,
Hogan would take the ball outside,
and if the end stayed home, he would
hand the ball off to Anthony Wilker
son (R). This allowed left tackle An
drus Peat to block somebody else.
This was not, however, the übiq
uitous zone read. Both the classic
zone read and this option play option
off of a backside defender: The play
goes one way, and the quarterback
basically threatens a bootleg to the
opposite side. If the defender cor
rectly sits back and forces the hand
off, the offense's free blocker is on
the wrong side of the field if the
defense aligns properly, there is
very little that the blocker can do to
affect the outcome of the play. Stan
ford took advantage of this many
times against Oregon.
How did Stanford use Peat, then?
The Cardinal had him run the trap.
