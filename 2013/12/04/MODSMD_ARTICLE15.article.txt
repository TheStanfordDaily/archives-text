# Confidence in question despite win
## 
### Sam Fisher 
Another week, another
stressful Stanford
football game. I would
say sorry for sounding
like a broken record

this season, but it's not my fault al
most every game has been eerily
similar.
Stanford again showed that it was
a better team than its opponent (this
time Notre Dame) and again almost
let that opponent come away with a
victory. Watching Saturday's game, I
honestly believe Stanford is at least
17 points better than Notre Dame at
Stanford Stadium, yet that margin
didn't materialize.
With the exception of Cal, no
game on the Cardinal's schedule
since the start of October was easy.
Yes, some of that is a credit to the
depth of the Pac-12, but it is also due
to Stanford's remarkable inability to
finish teams off.
It's amazing to me how often the
Cardinal defense can come up with
enough stops for Stanford to win
those close games. This time, the un
likely hero was junior cornerback
Wayne Lyons, who came up with two
clutch interceptions. The athleticism
Lyons showed on one of his intercep
tions to avoid committing pass inter
ference was impressive and served
as a reminder why Lyons was such a
highly touted recruit out of high
school.
On the other side of the ball, I'm
not sure how much Stanford can take
from the game. Stanford again
showed the ability to run the ball
with senior Tyler Gaffney in a domi
nant fashion, yet still was unable to
turn that into a comfortable victory.
Running well against Norte Dame's
front is moderately impressive, but

the Irish weren't at full
strength. It'll be a much
tougher challenge for Gaffney
and the rest of the Cardinal
rushing attack at ASU Satur
day.
Given Arizona State's like
ly strategy of trying to stop
Gaffney, I'm not sure how
much confidence Hogan's per
formance against Notre Dame
really instilled. Again, Hogan
looked very good at times but
struggled as well. After erring
on the side of the underthrow
against Cal to great success,
Hogan overthrew receivers in
a few critical spots (and almost
overthrew junior wide receiv
er Devon Cajuste on a touch

down), leading to two inter
ceptions.
The fact that those inter
ceptions came on overthrows
is very concerning to me. Af
ter watching the Big Game, I
really thought Hogan had
moved past his overthrow
problem. Now, I'm worried his
performance against Cal was
simply an anomaly. Hogan will
have another chance to prove
me wrong as I expect Ari
zona State's aggressiveness
on defense will leave some
holes in the secondary and
he will have to do a lot better
than he did against the Irish.
The final takeaway from
Notre Dame to watch as Stan
ford heads into the Pac-12
Championship Game is the
question mark of the Cardi
nal kicking game. In warm
ups, senior kicker Jordan
Williamson definitely still looked

hobbled by his nagging leg in
jury Sophomore kicker Conrad
Ukropina has done a nice job
filling in on kickoffs, but
Williamson's injury could be a
factor in a close game. If Stan
ford needs a game-tying or
game-winning field goal at the
end of Saturday's game, how
close will Hogan have to lead
the offense before Shaw can
feel comfortable going for the
kick? I don't know the answer,
and with all the uncertainty, I
certainly hope that I won't
have to find out that answer.
