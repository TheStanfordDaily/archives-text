# Confidence in question despite win

### Sam Fisher 
Another week, another
stressful Stanford
football game. I would
say sorry for sounding
like a broken record

this season, but it's not my fault al
most every game has been eerily
similar.
Stanford again showed that it was
a better team than its opponent (this
time Notre Dame) and again almost
let that opponent come away with a
victory. Watching Saturday's game, I
honestly believe Stanford is at least
17 points better than Notre Dame at
Stanford Stadium, yet that margin
didn't materialize.
With the exception of Cal, no
game on the Cardinal's schedule
since the start of October was easy.
Yes, some of that is a credit to the
depth of the Pac-12, but it is also due
to Stanford's remarkable inability to
finish teams off.
It's amazing to me how often the
Cardinal defense can come up with
enough stops for Stanford to win
those close games. This time, the un
likely hero was junior cornerback
Wayne Lyons, who came up with two
clutch interceptions. The athleticism
Lyons showed on one of his intercep
tions to avoid committing pass inter
ference was impressive and served
as a reminder why Lyons was such a
highly touted recruit out of high
school.
On the other side of the ball, I'm
not sure how much Stanford can take
from the game. Stanford again
showed the ability to run the ball
with senior Tyler Gaffney in a domi
nant fashion, yet still was unable to
turn that into a comfortable victory.
Running well against Norte Dame's
front is moderately impressive, but
