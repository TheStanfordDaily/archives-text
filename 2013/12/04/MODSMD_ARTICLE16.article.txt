# Intellectual brutality on the Farm
## 
### Ashley Westhem 
I wrote earlier this year that I
would never study abroad dur
ing fall quarter because I am a
diehard college football fan, and
it would kill me to have to watch
home games at the crack of dawn via
some questionable live-streaming site
in some foreign country And yet, I
find myself guilty of not flying back to
campus for the Notre Dame game.
Trust me, it was painful watching from
home, so I got my due punishment.
The benefit of watching a broad
cast from home was hearing what the
analysts had to say about Stanford
football. It was basically nothing but
positives, which made me that much
more proud of my school. The other
benefit that I gained from watching at
home was healing the broadcasters
mention Stanford's key to success as
being "intellectual brutality." This is
apparently on the team's warm-up jer
seys, and Stanford football has been
deemed the "Home of Intellectual
Brutality" for a while now â€”I was
just a little late to catch on.
I love this, and it's accurate not on
ly for football but for all of Stanford. It
goes along with Stanford's tagline of
#NerdNation. Everything that stu
dent-athletes and non-athletes do at
Stanford is done with intellectual bru
tality.
To go to class, go to practice, spend
hours in the training room, study, com
pete at the highest level and then find
enough time to sleep and recover re
quires immense intellectual brutality

Mental and physical toughness go
hand in hand for athletes at Stanford,
and they have to have the smarts and
straight brute force to power through
and achieve both.
On the flip side, to power through a
CS assignment into the early horn's of
the morning, or spend five nights a
week at The Daily to produce the pa
per you're reading or to balance class
es with an on-campus job while head
ing different organizations also re
quires intellectual brutality and the
perseverance to work through any
thing.
