# Intellectual brutality on the Farm
## 
### Ashley Westhem 
I wrote earlier this year that I
would never study abroad dur
ing fall quarter because I am a
diehard college football fan, and
it would kill me to have to watch
home games at the crack of dawn via
some questionable live-streaming site
in some foreign country And yet, I
find myself guilty of not flying back to
campus for the Notre Dame game.
Trust me, it was painful watching from
home, so I got my due punishment.
The benefit of watching a broad
cast from home was hearing what the
analysts had to say about Stanford
football. It was basically nothing but
positives, which made me that much
more proud of my school. The other
benefit that I gained from watching at
home was healing the broadcasters
mention Stanford's key to success as
being "intellectual brutality." This is
apparently on the team's warm-up jer
seys, and Stanford football has been
deemed the "Home of Intellectual
Brutality" for a while now —I was
just a little late to catch on.
I love this, and it's accurate not on
ly for football but for all of Stanford. It
goes along with Stanford's tagline of
#NerdNation. Everything that stu
dent-athletes and non-athletes do at
Stanford is done with intellectual bru
tality.
To go to class, go to practice, spend
hours in the training room, study, com
pete at the highest level and then find
enough time to sleep and recover re
quires immense intellectual brutality

Mental and physical toughness go
hand in hand for athletes at Stanford,
and they have to have the smarts and
straight brute force to power through
and achieve both.
On the flip side, to power through a
CS assignment into the early horn's of
the morning, or spend five nights a
week at The Daily to produce the pa
per you're reading or to balance class
es with an on-campus job while head
ing different organizations also re
quires intellectual brutality and the
perseverance to work through any
thing.
Intellectual brutality does
n't just define Stanford foot
ball; it defines the hard work
and brains of the whole institu
tion, and I love and appreciate
the fact that the football team
was what brought this saying
about and exemplifies it every
Saturday on the field.
It was the intellectual bru
tality of this year's senior class
that helped push Stanford foot
ball to be "among the elite," as
head coach David Shaw recent
ly stated. Those seniors en

ing coaches can throw any
number of plays at them and
they can handle them, no mat
ter the complexity And that
combination of intellect and
skill is what has made Stanford
so successful on the field
and all around campus.
Coaches, too, bring this to
their respective spoils. Look at
women's basketball head coach
Tara VanDerveer. She just
earned her 900 th victory and
became only the fifth women's
basketball coach to ever
achieve that mark —and she's
far from slowing down.
It took intellectual brutality
for her to have created such a
consistently great program
from nothing back in 1985. And
it takes intellectual brutality to
tackle each season as a new op
portunity to win, to constantly
strive to be the best in women's
basketball and to push a team
to do so her players, without
a doubt, demonstrate that

tered a program that had just
earned a winning record for
the first time in eight seasons
and had many opportunities
ahead of them to turn Stanford
football into something special.
And they took advantage.
Those 26 seniors will leave
Stanford with a fourth consecu
tive 10-win season, a 26-1 home
record and a chance at a fourth
BCS bowl. The thing about
Stanford football players is
they're not just tough and ath
letic; they're also smart, mean-

same toughness mentally and
physically to keep up with the
demands of such a coach.
Stanford football might
have just created a new tagline
for the university with "intel
lectual brutality" to comple
ment the older standard of
"#NerdNation." When senior
running back Tyler Gaffhey,
fifth-year senior linebacker
Shayne Skov and senior line
backer A. J. Tarpley walked in
to the Oregon post-game press
conference with taped up glass
es after dismantling the
mighty Ducks Skov still
with his intimidating eye-black
still on they epitomized both
sayings.

Ashley Westhem is trying to
petition the Axe and, Palm- to
develop a new, hearty "Intel
lectual Brutality" burger.

"It defines the hard work and
brains of the whole institution."
