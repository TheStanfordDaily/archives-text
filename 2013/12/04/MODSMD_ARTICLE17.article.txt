# STANFORD IN THE NFL
## ERTZ'S TWO TOUCHDOWNS SPUR EAGLES TO VICTORY 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
For tight end Zach Ertz
'l3, big games are just big op
portunities to shine.
Ertz recorded his first ca
reer two-touchdown game,
catching the second and third
touchdowns of his young ca
reer to power the Eagles to a
critical 24-21 victory over the
Arizona Cardinals, who had
previously won four games in
a row. The win allowed the
Eagles to keep pace with the
Dallas Cowboys in the NFC
East. Ertz finished as the
Eagles' leading receiver on
the day with five receptions
for 68 yards in one of the
biggest games of the Eagles'
season thus far.
In the first quarter, Ertz
opened the scoring by reeling
in a six-yard pass from quar
terback Nick Foles to put the
Eagles up 7-0. Later in the
third quarter, Ertz ran up the
seam and caught a pass from
Foles between two defenders
before breaking the plane for
the touchdown and emphati
cally spiking the ball. Ertz
and the Eagles won their
fourth straight game and
earned the tiebreaker
against a likely challenger for
an NFC wildcard berth in the
Cardinals, who now, like the
Eagles, hold a 7-5 record.
The Eagles are tied with the
Cowboys for the NFC East
division lead.
On the other side of the
game, Cardinals tight end
Jim Dray 'lO caught three
passes for 26 yards, including
a 3-yard touchdown pass in
the fourth quarter that nar
rowed the deficit to three
points at 24-21 with four min
utes remaining. Dray contin
ues to build on the best sea
son of his career, which has
seen him record more receiv
ing yards (140) and touch
downs (two) than in his entire
three-year career prior to
this season (87 receiving
yards and zero touchdowns
entering the year).
For the Cardinals, run
ning back Stepfan Taylor 'l3
again saw action on the field,
carrying the ball three times
for 15 yards and catching two
passes for 45 yards. Taylor
has now logged multiple
carries in back-to-back
games for the second time
this season.
♦ ♦♦
The Miami Dolphins offi
cially placed offensive tackle
Jonathan Martin 'l2 on the
non-football injury list, mean
ing that Martin is no longer
eligible to play this season
and will no longer count to
wards the team's 53-man ros

ter. The Dolphins now also
have the flexibility to pay
Martin as little or as much of
the remainder of his base
salary as they want.
Martin, who left the team
amidst a bullying scandal
several weeks ago, may have
played his final snap as a Dol
phin as recent reports state
that Martin does not desire
to return to the team. Like
wise, justifiably or not, sever
al Dolphins players have ex
pressed their belief that Mar
tin should have handled the
situation better by keeping it
in-house and preventing it
from coming under national
media attention, signaling
that the players may no

longer welcome Martin as a
teammate.
Martin remains under his
rookie contract with the Dol
phins for two more years, so
any potential roster move
would most likely come via a
trade in the offseason, as the
Dolphins would hope to get
something in return for Mar
tin. A former second-round
pick who could potentially
start at either right or left
tackle, Martin would normal
ly cost at least a mid-round
draft pick for a team that
wants to trade for him.

Quarterback Andrew
Luck 'l2 finished 17 for 32
with 200 passing yards as the

Indianapolis Colts defeated
the Tennessee Titans 22-14
on Sunday. Luck's perform
ance, however, will not go
down as one of his better
games of the season. Luck
threw an interception and
fumbled twice, although the
Colts did recover both fum
bles.
The win gave the Colts a
three-game lead in the AFC
South with an 8-4 record as
they look to return to the
playoffs after earning a wild
card berth and losing in the
first round to the Ravens last
season.
