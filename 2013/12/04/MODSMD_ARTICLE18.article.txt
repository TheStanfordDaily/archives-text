# PRESS NOTES
## FAMILIAR FOE AWAITS 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
With the Pae-12 championship approaching, Stan
ford sits in a somewhat familiar position. At this time
last year, Stanford was preparing to face a UCLA squad
that it had already dismantled 35-17. This year, the Car
dinal must ready itself for another rematch, this time
against an Arizona State team that it soundly defeated
42-28 at the beginning of the season. In contrast to last
season, when Stanford played UCLA in back-to-back
weeks, the Cardinal will now face the Sun Devils nearly
three months after the first meeting.
"We haven't seen these guys in a long time," said
head coach David Shaw. "Let's reintroduce ourselves to
them personnel wise. Let's go back and watch the film.
They've played a lot of football since we played them
last. They've drawn up a lot of blitzes since we played
them last. We have to treat them as a new team, a new
game."
As the Cardinal remembers all too well, the Sun
Devils came roaring back in the last meeting. After
trailing 39-7 at the start of the fourth quarter, ASU
came back to make things interesting before Stanford
finally put the game away. Since their previous matchup
with the Cardinal, the Sun Devils are 8-1, including five
games in which they scored 50 or more points.
"They were playing well when we played them,"
Shaw stated. "We started off like gangbusters in that
game, but they came storming back. They're just a good
football team. They've got really good players at all
three levels on defense ... I think [Taylor] Kelly is a dy
namic quarterback that just keeps fighting the whole
game."

has guided an offense that
ranks eighth in the nation
with 43.3 points per game.
While Arizona State will be
without starting running
back Marion Grice, who was
ruled out due to a leg injury,
the team possesses capable
backups in D.J. Foster and
Deantre Lewis, who are av
eraging 4.7 and 5.4 yards per
carry respectively.
On the defensive side,
Arizona State has held six of
its last seven opponents to 24
points or fewer. Defensive
tackle Will Sutton was re
cently named Pac-12 Defen
sive Player of the Year and
finished the regular season
with three sacks and 10.5
tackles for loss.
"They're fast," said Shaw

on the most difficult part of
facing Arizona State's de
fense. "Their linebackers
run. Their [defensive backs]
make up speed; when the
ball goes up in the air they
close the cushion fast ... Will
Sutton gets off on the snap.
Just when you think you've
got him blocked he does that
counter move and the next
thing you know he's hitting
your quarterback."
Stanford hopes to enter
Saturday's contest at full
strength with the return of
senior defensive end Josh
Mauro. Shaw is optimistic
that Mauro, who sat out
against Notre Dame, will re
turn against ASU.

Senior running back
Tyler Gaffney is in the midst
of a very special season. De
spite leaving to play minor
league baseball for a year,
Gaffney has returned in re
markable form, as his 1,485

rushing yards on the season
rank third all-time in Stan
ford history behind only
Stepfan Taylor (1,530 rush
ing yards in 2012) and Toby
Gerhart (1,830 rushing yards
in 2009).
"I'm excited for Tyler,"
Shaw said. "He's put on film
that he's a potential high
round pick in the NFL be
cause that's how NFL backs
run. He's done it every game
he's caught the ball out of
the backfield, he's pass pro
tected, he's come back and
shown that he's a complete
back."
Gaffney will have a tough
decision to make at the sea
son's end when he decides to
pursue football or baseball
professionally. While he said
that he hasn't thought about
it yet, he did express his de
sire to continue playing foot
ball. If he does choose to play
in the NFL, he may not be
the only current Cardinal

back who finds himself on an
NFL roster someday, as sen
ior running back Anthony
Wilkerson may wind up earn
ing a roster spot on a team
next season as well.
"You just put Anthony
Wilkerson carries together,
one after another, I think he
looks like an NFL back also,"
Shaw said.
Despite losing snaps to
Gaffney, Wilkerson has
shown his value every time
he steps on the field. Shaw
compared him to former Car
dinal running back Jeremy
Stewart 'll, who played be
hind Stepfan Taylor 'l3 while
at Stanford but now plays for
the Oakland Raiders.
Gaffney and Wilkerson
have two more games left in
their Stanford careers to im
press scouts before the NFL
Draft in April.

With the Pae-12 championship approaching, Stan
ford sits in a somewhat familiar position. At this time
last year, Stanford was preparing to face a UCLA squad
that it had already dismantled 35-17. This year, the Car
dinal must ready itself for another rematch, this time
against an Arizona State team that it soundly defeated
42-28 at the beginning of the season. In contrast to last
season, when Stanford played UCLA in back-to-back
weeks, the Cardinal will now face the Sun Devils nearly
three months after the first meeting.
"We haven't seen these guys in a long time," said
head coach David Shaw. "Let's reintroduce ourselves to
them personnel wise. Let's go back and watch the film.
They've played a lot of football since we played them
last. They've drawn up a lot of blitzes since we played
them last. We have to treat them as a new team, a new
game."
As the Cardinal remembers all too well, the Sun
Devils came roaring back in the last meeting. After
trailing 39-7 at the start of the fourth quarter, ASU
came back to make things interesting before Stanford
finally put the game away. Since their previous matchup
with the Cardinal, the Sun Devils are 8-1, including five
games in which they scored 50 or more points.
"They were playing well when we played them,"
Shaw stated. "We started off like gangbusters in that
game, but they came storming back. They're just a good
football team. They've got really good players at all
three levels on defense ... I think [Taylor] Kelly is a dy
namic quarterback that just keeps fighting the whole
game."

has guided an offense that
ranks eighth in the nation
with 43.3 points per game.
While Arizona State will be
without starting running
back Marion Grice, who was
ruled out due to a leg injury,
the team possesses capable
backups in D.J. Foster and
Deantre Lewis, who are av
eraging 4.7 and 5.4 yards per
carry respectively.
On the defensive side,
Arizona State has held six of
its last seven opponents to 24
points or fewer. Defensive
tackle Will Sutton was re
cently named Pac-12 Defen
sive Player of the Year and
finished the regular season
with three sacks and 10.5
tackles for loss.
"They're fast," said Shaw

on the most difficult part of
facing Arizona State's de
fense. "Their linebackers
run. Their [defensive backs]
make up speed; when the
ball goes up in the air they
close the cushion fast ... Will
Sutton gets off on the snap.
Just when you think you've
got him blocked he does that
counter move and the next
thing you know he's hitting
your quarterback."
Stanford hopes to enter
Saturday's contest at full
strength with the return of
senior defensive end Josh
Mauro. Shaw is optimistic
that Mauro, who sat out
against Notre Dame, will re
turn against ASU.

Senior running back
Tyler Gaffney is in the midst
of a very special season. De
spite leaving to play minor
league baseball for a year,
Gaffney has returned in re
markable form, as his 1,485

rushing yards on the season
rank third all-time in Stan
ford history behind only
Stepfan Taylor (1,530 rush
ing yards in 2012) and Toby
Gerhart (1,830 rushing yards
in 2009).
"I'm excited for Tyler,"
Shaw said. "He's put on film
that he's a potential high
round pick in the NFL be
cause that's how NFL backs
run. He's done it every game
he's caught the ball out of
the backfield, he's pass pro
tected, he's come back and
shown that he's a complete
back."
Gaffney will have a tough
decision to make at the sea
son's end when he decides to
pursue football or baseball
professionally. While he said
that he hasn't thought about
it yet, he did express his de
sire to continue playing foot
ball. If he does choose to play
in the NFL, he may not be
the only current Cardinal

back who finds himself on an
NFL roster someday, as sen
ior running back Anthony
Wilkerson may wind up earn
ing a roster spot on a team
next season as well.
"You just put Anthony
Wilkerson carries together,
one after another, I think he
looks like an NFL back also,"
Shaw said.
Despite losing snaps to
Gaffney, Wilkerson has
shown his value every time
he steps on the field. Shaw
compared him to former Car
dinal running back Jeremy
Stewart 'll, who played be
