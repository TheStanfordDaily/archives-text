## FAMILIAR FOE AWAITS 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
With the Pae-12 championship approaching, Stan
ford sits in a somewhat familiar position. At this time
last year, Stanford was preparing to face a UCLA squad
that it had already dismantled 35-17. This year, the Car
dinal must ready itself for another rematch, this time
against an Arizona State team that it soundly defeated
42-28 at the beginning of the season. In contrast to last
season, when Stanford played UCLA in back-to-back
weeks, the Cardinal will now face the Sun Devils nearly
three months after the first meeting.
"We haven't seen these guys in a long time," said
head coach David Shaw. "Let's reintroduce ourselves to
them personnel wise. Let's go back and watch the film.
They've played a lot of football since we played them
last. They've drawn up a lot of blitzes since we played
them last. We have to treat them as a new team, a new
game."
As the Cardinal remembers all too well, the Sun
Devils came roaring back in the last meeting. After
trailing 39-7 at the start of the fourth quarter, ASU
came back to make things interesting before Stanford
finally put the game away. Since their previous matchup
with the Cardinal, the Sun Devils are 8-1, including five
games in which they scored 50 or more points.
"They were playing well when we played them,"
Shaw stated. "We started off like gangbusters in that
game, but they came storming back. They're just a good
football team. They've got really good players at all
three levels on defense ... I think [Taylor] Kelly is a dy
namic quarterback that just keeps fighting the whole
game."

Senior defensive tackle Josh Mauro (center) returned
to practice earlier than expected from an injury and
will look to bolster a depleted defensive line in the
Pac-12 Championship in Tempe, Ariz, on Saturday.
