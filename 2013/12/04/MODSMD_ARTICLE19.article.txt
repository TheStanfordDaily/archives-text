## Confident Cardinal ready for postseason 
### JORDAN WALLACH STAFF WRITER 
After an up-and-down regular season
that saw some tough losses to ranked op
ponents and ended without a conference
championship, Stanford women's volley
ball enters postseason play this week rid
ing a nine-match winning streak. As one of
only two teams to earn berths in all 32
NCAA tournaments, the Cardinal is poised
to make a run at its seventh national title
and its first since 2004.
Although the Cardinal (24-5) finished
third in the final AVCA rankings before
the postseason, the team is seeded No. 7
overall in the NCAA tournament. As a re
sult, Stanford earned the right to host the
first two rounds of the postseason for its
rank in the top 16. Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference Champion Hampton (19-10)
will make the cross-country journey for a
tough first-round matchup against the
Card on Thursday at Maples Pavilion.
Looking forward, the Cardinal will
move through the Lexington, Ky., Regional
and face the winner of the other first-round
matchup at Maples between Oklahoma
(23-7) and Alabama (24-4). Other potential
roadblocks on the team's road to the Final
Four in Seattle include No. 2 Penn State
(28-2), against whom the Cardinal own a 2-
3 record all-time in postseason play, and
No. 10 Minnesota (27-6). Penn State is the
only other team that has also earned a bid
to all 32 tournaments.
Perhaps more important than their per
formance on the court, this season's team
boasts the experience and poise that last
year's team lacked in the tournament. In
2012, the Cardinal was very young, as it
welcomed the top recruiting class in the
nation five high school All-Americans,
four of whom earned spots in the starting
rotation.

After a somewhat bumpy 3-2 start to
the 2012 regular season against tough op
ponents on the road, Stanford breezed to a
27-3 overall record, without having to deal
with much adversity on the court save for a
loss at USC in the middle of its conference
schedule. The team's somewhat passive at
titude could have been to blame for getting
upset in the regional final by Michigan.
"In years, they're young," said head
coach John Dunning, "but they learned a
lot last year. You had to give Michigan cred
it when they beat us in the playoffs, but our
team talked a lot about it and learned a lot
having gone through that experience."
"We didn't really know what we were
getting into the hype of the tourna
ment," said sophomore middle blocker
Inky Ajanaku. "We just had to hear it
through the other gills' mouths, but this
year we know exactly what we need to do
to be successful."
The Cardinal faced some adversity ear
lier this season, namely a 3-5 record
against ranked opponents after its heart
wrenching five-set loss at home to then-
No. 4 USC. Yet the team developed a new
dynamic, and the players seemed to reded
icate themselves after that loss.
Stanford's renewed focus and ability to
maintain its composure in high-pressure
situations is responsible for its season-high
nine-match winning streak to end the reg
ular season. Straight-set victories on the
road at high altitude against Colorado and
Utah and the team's marquee win of the
season a sweep against then-No. 3 and
eventual conference champion Washington
on Nov. 20 has the Card playing its best
volleyball heading into the postseason.
"We are a much different team than we
were last year, and that's in our favor," said
senior outside hitter Rachel Williams. "All

of our starters know what it's
like to play in the tourna
ment: the importance of
every match and of every
point, and controlling the
momentum and the ball as
much as we can."
While the team's charac
ter will certainly be valuable
to a postseason run, the Car
dinal's strong play both
offensively and defensively
—will be what propels the
team forward. It starts with
a balanced offense and soph
omore setter Madi Bugg's
ability to distribute the ball
to both the pins and the mid
dles.
Ajanaku who was se
lected as the Pac-12 Offen
sive Player of the Week for
the last week of November
has been able to anchor
the team's offense of late, av
eraging 3.1 kills per set and a
.465 hitting percentage over
the Card's nine-match win
ning streak, compared to
2.41 kills per set and a .414
attack percentage over her
previous 18 matches.
"[Bugg] is doing a great
job spreading the ball
around," Ajanaku said, "and
our outsides are doing a
great job putting it down,
which opens up spots for me
on the court."
"We're one of the teams
that can either use our mid
dles to beat people, or make
people worry about our mid
dles and instead beat them
somewhere else," Dunning
added. "We have balance,
and everybody knows it."
On defense, Stanford's
steady play at the net has
held its opponents to a .170
hitting percentage this sea
son. The team ranks third in
the nation with 3.02 blocks
per set and is led by senior
middle blocker Carly Wopat,
whose 1.41 blocks per set av
erage is 16th-best in the
country. Junior libero Kyle
Gilbert leads the team with
5.06 digs per set, and her
play of late has encouraged
her head coach.
"The thing for us that's
improving the most right
now is not just that we're
digging balls, but that we're
digging them with more con
trol," Dunning said. "That
was one of the things that
we've been trying to work
on."
While the Cardinal must
first take care of business
on its home court in the first
two rounds and then against
No. 10 Minnesota, all signs
point towards a clash with
Penn State in the Lexington
regional final, which will be
Stanford's toughest match
of the year. The Nittany Li
ons' only losses this season
came against No. 1 Texas
and then-No. 15 Michigan
State. A tussle between
Penn State and Stanford
would promise an intense
battle at the net, as the
teams rank first and third
nationally in blocks per set.
Yet for the Card, it will just
be another hurdle in their
season-long chase for a
championship.
"I like our team for those
two reasons we have a lot
of belief in what we're doing
and our players work togeth
er really well," Dunning said.
"When the pressure grows,
we're one of those teams that
could just smile at it."
Stanford's first-round
matchup against Hampton,
which is making its first
tournament appearance, is
set for 7 p.m. on Thursday at
Maples Pavilion.

After a somewhat bumpy 3-2 start to
the 2012 regular season against tough op
ponents on the road, Stanford breezed to a
27-3 overall record, without having to deal
with much adversity on the court save for a
loss at USC in the middle of its conference
schedule. The team's somewhat passive at
titude could have been to blame for getting
upset in the regional final by Michigan.
"In years, they're young," said head
coach John Dunning, "but they learned a
lot last year. You had to give Michigan cred
it when they beat us in the playoffs, but our
team talked a lot about it and learned a lot
having gone through that experience."
"We didn't really know what we were
getting into the hype of the tourna
ment," said sophomore middle blocker
Inky Ajanaku. "We just had to hear it
through the other gills' mouths, but this
year we know exactly what we need to do
to be successful."
The Cardinal faced some adversity ear
lier this season, namely a 3-5 record
against ranked opponents after its heart
wrenching five-set loss at home to then-
No. 4 USC. Yet the team developed a new
dynamic, and the players seemed to reded
icate themselves after that loss.
Stanford's renewed focus and ability to
maintain its composure in high-pressure
situations is responsible for its season-high
nine-match winning streak to end the reg
ular season. Straight-set victories on the
road at high altitude against Colorado and
Utah and the team's marquee win of the
season a sweep against then-No. 3 and
eventual conference champion Washington
on Nov. 20 has the Card playing its best
volleyball heading into the postseason.
"We are a much different team than we
were last year, and that's in our favor," said
senior outside hitter Rachel Williams. "All

of our starters know what it's
like to play in the tourna
ment: the importance of
every match and of every
point, and controlling the
momentum and the ball as
much as we can."
While the team's charac
ter will certainly be valuable
to a postseason run, the Car
dinal's strong play both
offensively and defensively
—will be what propels the
team forward. It starts with
a balanced offense and soph
omore setter Madi Bugg's
ability to distribute the ball
to both the pins and the mid
dles.
Ajanaku who was se
lected as the Pac-12 Offen
sive Player of the Week for
the last week of November
has been able to anchor
the team's offense of late, av
eraging 3.1 kills per set and a
.465 hitting percentage over
the Card's nine-match win
ning streak, compared to
2.41 kills per set and a .414
attack percentage over her
previous 18 matches.
"[Bugg] is doing a great
job spreading the ball
around," Ajanaku said, "and
our outsides are doing a
great job putting it down,
which opens up spots for me
on the court."
"We're one of the teams
that can either use our mid
dles to beat people, or make
people worry about our mid
dles and instead beat them
somewhere else," Dunning
added. "We have balance,
and everybody knows it."
On defense, Stanford's
steady play at the net has
held its opponents to a .170
hitting percentage this sea
son. The team ranks third in
the nation with 3.02 blocks
per set and is led by senior
middle blocker Carly Wopat,
whose 1.41 blocks per set av
erage is 16th-best in the
country. Junior libero Kyle
Gilbert leads the team with
5.06 digs per set, and her
play of late has encouraged
her head coach.
"The thing for us that's
improving the most right
now is not just that we're
digging balls, but that we're
digging them with more con
trol," Dunning said. "That
was one of the things that
we've been trying to work
on."
While the Cardinal must
first take care of business
on its home court in the first
two rounds and then against
No. 10 Minnesota, all signs
point towards a clash with
Penn State in the Lexington
regional final, which will be
Stanford's toughest match
of the year. The Nittany Li
ons' only losses this season
came against No. 1 Texas
and then-No. 15 Michigan
State. A tussle between
Penn State and Stanford
would promise an intense
battle at the net, as the
teams rank first and third
nationally in blocks per set.
Yet for the Card, it will just
be another hurdle in their
season-long chase for a
championship.
"I like our team for those
two reasons we have a lot
of belief in what we're doing
and our players work togeth
er really well," Dunning said.
"When the pressure grows,
we're one of those teams that
could just smile at it."
Stanford's first-round
matchup against Hampton,
which is making its first
tournament appearance, is
set for 7 p.m. on Thursday at
Maples Pavilion.

After an up-and-down regular season
that saw some tough losses to ranked op
ponents and ended without a conference
championship, Stanford women's volley
ball enters postseason play this week rid
ing a nine-match winning streak. As one of
only two teams to earn berths in all 32
NCAA tournaments, the Cardinal is poised
to make a run at its seventh national title
and its first since 2004.
Although the Cardinal (24-5) finished
third in the final AVCA rankings before
the postseason, the team is seeded No. 7
overall in the NCAA tournament. As a re
sult, Stanford earned the right to host the
first two rounds of the postseason for its
rank in the top 16. Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference Champion Hampton (19-10)
will make the cross-country journey for a
tough first-round matchup against the
Card on Thursday at Maples Pavilion.
Looking forward, the Cardinal will
move through the Lexington, Ky., Regional
and face the winner of the other first-round
matchup at Maples between Oklahoma
(23-7) and Alabama (24-4). Other potential
roadblocks on the team's road to the Final
Four in Seattle include No. 2 Penn State
(28-2), against whom the Cardinal own a 2-
3 record all-time in postseason play, and
No. 10 Minnesota (27-6). Penn State is the
only other team that has also earned a bid
to all 32 tournaments.
Perhaps more important than their per
formance on the court, this season's team
boasts the experience and poise that last
year's team lacked in the tournament. In
2012, the Cardinal was very young, as it
welcomed the top recruiting class in the
nation five high school All-Americans,
four of whom earned spots in the starting
rotation.
