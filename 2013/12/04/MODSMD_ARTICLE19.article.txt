## Confident Cardinal ready for postseason 
### JORDAN WALLACH STAFF WRITER 
After an up-and-down regular season
that saw some tough losses to ranked op
ponents and ended without a conference
championship, Stanford women's volley
ball enters postseason play this week rid
ing a nine-match winning streak. As one of
only two teams to earn berths in all 32
NCAA tournaments, the Cardinal is poised
to make a run at its seventh national title
and its first since 2004.
Although the Cardinal (24-5) finished
third in the final AVCA rankings before
the postseason, the team is seeded No. 7
overall in the NCAA tournament. As a re
sult, Stanford earned the right to host the
first two rounds of the postseason for its
rank in the top 16. Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference Champion Hampton (19-10)
will make the cross-country journey for a
tough first-round matchup against the
Card on Thursday at Maples Pavilion.
Looking forward, the Cardinal will
move through the Lexington, Ky., Regional
and face the winner of the other first-round
matchup at Maples between Oklahoma
(23-7) and Alabama (24-4). Other potential
roadblocks on the team's road to the Final
Four in Seattle include No. 2 Penn State
(28-2), against whom the Cardinal own a 2-
3 record all-time in postseason play, and
No. 10 Minnesota (27-6). Penn State is the
only other team that has also earned a bid
to all 32 tournaments.
Perhaps more important than their per
formance on the court, this season's team
boasts the experience and poise that last
year's team lacked in the tournament. In
2012, the Cardinal was very young, as it
welcomed the top recruiting class in the
nation five high school All-Americans,
four of whom earned spots in the starting
rotation.

After a somewhat bumpy 3-2 start to
the 2012 regular season against tough op
ponents on the road, Stanford breezed to a
27-3 overall record, without having to deal
with much adversity on the court save for a
loss at USC in the middle of its conference
schedule. The team's somewhat passive at
titude could have been to blame for getting
upset in the regional final by Michigan.
"In years, they're young," said head
coach John Dunning, "but they learned a
lot last year. You had to give Michigan cred
it when they beat us in the playoffs, but our
team talked a lot about it and learned a lot
having gone through that experience."
"We didn't really know what we were
getting into the hype of the tourna
ment," said sophomore middle blocker
Inky Ajanaku. "We just had to hear it
through the other gills' mouths, but this
year we know exactly what we need to do
to be successful."
The Cardinal faced some adversity ear
lier this season, namely a 3-5 record
against ranked opponents after its heart
wrenching five-set loss at home to then-
No. 4 USC. Yet the team developed a new
dynamic, and the players seemed to reded
icate themselves after that loss.
Stanford's renewed focus and ability to
maintain its composure in high-pressure
situations is responsible for its season-high
nine-match winning streak to end the reg
ular season. Straight-set victories on the
road at high altitude against Colorado and
Utah and the team's marquee win of the
season a sweep against then-No. 3 and
eventual conference champion Washington
on Nov. 20 has the Card playing its best
volleyball heading into the postseason.
"We are a much different team than we
were last year, and that's in our favor," said
senior outside hitter Rachel Williams. "All
