# Building Afghan rule of law
## Impending U.S. drawdown creates challenges for law school program 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD DESK EDITOR 
In 2007, two Stanford law stu
dents approached Erik Jensen, now
director of the Rule of Law Program
at Stanford Law School, with the
idea of wilting legal education text
books to meet a growing demand for
more widespread law enforcement
and better judicial practices in
Afghanistan.
The student-led Afghanistan Le
gal Education Project (ALEP) was
created that year with the first text
book, titled "An Introduction to the
Laws of Afghanistan," sent to the
American University of Afghanistan
(AUAF) in Kabul for vetting by lead
ing Afghan academics and law ex
perts. ALEP was the first legal edu
cation project for the Rule of Law
Program. By 2010, the project had
produced three textbooks and was
awarded a grant of $1.3 million by
the U.S. Department of State's Bu
reau of International Narcotics and
Law Enforcement Affairs to contin
ue its work.
"My students were demanding
something where they could not de
lay the gratification of doing some
thing meaningful in their lives and
embrace the textbooks, and the stu

dents on the other side could not get
enough of the textbooks," Jensen
said.
With five books published, ALEP
helped establish a full-fledged law
department this year at AUAF that
grants graduates a bachelor's de
gree in arts and law and offers a se
lective academic project for Stanford
law students through which they
gain real-world experience and de
gree credit by writing textbooks.
ALEP is currently being led by
Christopher Jones J.D. 'l4 and
Samuel Jacobson J.D. 'l4.
Samira Abrar, an undergraduate
from Kabul who received a scholar
ship from the U.S. Embassy and is
now pursuing a law degree at AUAF
through ALEI] said she appreciates
the textbooks more than her domes
tic academic material.
"[The textbooks] are very high
quality and they are a reference on
our own laws and also the parts they
have been discussing in every chap
ter ... [is] new for me," Abrar said.
"In our own textbooks we do not
have such things. [The new text
books] make us think critically or
lead us to discuss more or to seek
other solutions to address the prob
lem."
While the project has seen suc

cess over the past six years, ALEP
will soon face new obstacles. With
new presidential elections and there
fore widespread uncertainty sur
rounding the future of Afghanistan's
social, economic and political securi
ty, 2014 will be a critical year for
Afghanistan.
"The level of insecurity among
Afghans and this includes the stu
dents in AUAF about 2014 is pal
pable," Jensen said.
Abrar acknowledged this uncer
tainty, specifically in regards to the
future of her own education.
"What's going to happen in 2014
is not something clear for every
body," Abrar said. "What we hope as

a student is that they support the law
program. I hope that any changes to
the system will not have a negative
effect on our studies."
According to Megan Karsh, the
Rule of Law Program teaching fel
low for ALER the effect of insecurity
on the degree program is already no
ticeable in the enrollment numbers.
"Enrollment has been growing
more slowly than we expected."
Karsh said. "We just accept that
there's this uncertainty and we con
tinue to provide the best classes we
have."
Looking past lower enrollment
figures, one of the worst-case scenar
ios for Stanford's program after the

2014 pullout of American troops
from Afghanistan and national elec
tions is the Taliban retaking control
of the capital and shutting down uni
versities in Afghanistan all together.
However both Ghizaal Haress
who began as an adjunct lecture for
ALEP in 2012 and recently left her
other responsibilities to become a
full-time law faculty member at
AUAF and Jensen, as well as oth
er experts, are relatively confident
that Kabul will resist coming under
Taliban control after 2014. Their
greater concern is that Afghanistan
will experience an economic reces
