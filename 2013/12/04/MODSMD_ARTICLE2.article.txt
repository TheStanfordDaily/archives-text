# Building Afghan rule of law
## Impending U.S. drawdown creates challenges for law school program 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD DESK EDITOR 
In 2007, two Stanford law stu
dents approached Erik Jensen, now
director of the Rule of Law Program
at Stanford Law School, with the
idea of wilting legal education text
books to meet a growing demand for
more widespread law enforcement
and better judicial practices in
Afghanistan.
The student-led Afghanistan Le
gal Education Project (ALEP) was
created that year with the first text
book, titled "An Introduction to the
Laws of Afghanistan," sent to the
American University of Afghanistan
(AUAF) in Kabul for vetting by lead
ing Afghan academics and law ex
perts. ALEP was the first legal edu
cation project for the Rule of Law
Program. By 2010, the project had
produced three textbooks and was
awarded a grant of $1.3 million by
the U.S. Department of State's Bu
reau of International Narcotics and
Law Enforcement Affairs to contin
ue its work.
"My students were demanding
something where they could not de
lay the gratification of doing some
thing meaningful in their lives and
embrace the textbooks, and the stu

dents on the other side could not get
enough of the textbooks," Jensen
said.
With five books published, ALEP
helped establish a full-fledged law
department this year at AUAF that
grants graduates a bachelor's de
gree in arts and law and offers a se
lective academic project for Stanford
law students through which they
gain real-world experience and de
gree credit by writing textbooks.
ALEP is currently being led by
Christopher Jones J.D. 'l4 and
Samuel Jacobson J.D. 'l4.
Samira Abrar, an undergraduate
from Kabul who received a scholar
ship from the U.S. Embassy and is
now pursuing a law degree at AUAF
through ALEI] said she appreciates
the textbooks more than her domes
tic academic material.
"[The textbooks] are very high
quality and they are a reference on
our own laws and also the parts they
have been discussing in every chap
ter ... [is] new for me," Abrar said.
"In our own textbooks we do not
have such things. [The new text
books] make us think critically or
lead us to discuss more or to seek
other solutions to address the prob
lem."
While the project has seen suc

cess over the past six years, ALEP
will soon face new obstacles. With
new presidential elections and there
fore widespread uncertainty sur
rounding the future of Afghanistan's
social, economic and political securi
ty, 2014 will be a critical year for
Afghanistan.
"The level of insecurity among
Afghans and this includes the stu
dents in AUAF about 2014 is pal
pable," Jensen said.
Abrar acknowledged this uncer
tainty, specifically in regards to the
future of her own education.
"What's going to happen in 2014
is not something clear for every
body," Abrar said. "What we hope as

a student is that they support the law
program. I hope that any changes to
the system will not have a negative
effect on our studies."
According to Megan Karsh, the
Rule of Law Program teaching fel
low for ALER the effect of insecurity
on the degree program is already no
ticeable in the enrollment numbers.
"Enrollment has been growing
more slowly than we expected."
Karsh said. "We just accept that
there's this uncertainty and we con
tinue to provide the best classes we
have."
Looking past lower enrollment
figures, one of the worst-case scenar
ios for Stanford's program after the

2014 pullout of American troops
from Afghanistan and national elec
tions is the Taliban retaking control
of the capital and shutting down uni
versities in Afghanistan all together.
However both Ghizaal Haress
who began as an adjunct lecture for
ALEP in 2012 and recently left her
other responsibilities to become a
full-time law faculty member at
AUAF and Jensen, as well as oth
er experts, are relatively confident
that Kabul will resist coming under
Taliban control after 2014. Their
greater concern is that Afghanistan
will experience an economic reces

sion that will undo the economic
progress made since the fall of the
Taliban.

"We're looking at a really tough
several years," Jensen said. "But it's
not so much hinged on the insecuri
ties of the pullout in 2014, as it is a re
ally serious contraction in the Afghan
economy where we need to figure out
ways to bridge through these eco
nomically difficult times."

AUAF students echo this con
cern, fearing that they will not be
able to afford to pay tuition as the
majority of American and interna
tional NGOs pull out and the econo
my worsens.

"This is a concern for every stu
dent because all of them who are
studying at AUAF are supported fi
nancially either by their families or
by a scholarship," Abrar said. "So
when their families are acquiring
salaries with international projects
mostly, it's a big concern for them
whether their projects will be contin
ued after 2014 changes or not."
"Myself, I am working on such a
project. I am not sure whether I will
be able to financially afford the cost
of my education or not," she added.
Abrar hopes that political
changes will not affect her dream of
becoming a lawyer through the
ALEP program, but she explains
that many students, herself includ
ed, still express fear despite promis
es of continued support from the in
ternational community.
Haress described investing in ed
ucation as a natural concern for
Afghan students and very much in
line with the broader trend of de
creasing investment in Afghanistan.
According to Haress, many have
refrained from buying cars and
houses because of the growing un
certainty in the stability of
Afghanistan's financial markets.
"If people are not planning to in
vest much in property, they may not
be willing to invest in a four-year
program or a five-year program if
they're not completely sure what's
going to happen next," Haress said.
Further affirming Jensen's con
cern over the economy, the new
year will affect ALEP's efforts by
reducing state resources, notably
those used to pay the salaries of
qualified judges, who, according to
Haress, are already extremely lim

ited in number. With the lack of
basic living services for judges in
Afghanistan as well as a minimal
pension system, Haress explains
the moral predicament behind not
having economic assurance for the
future.
"If a judge sees all of that, what
are the incentives for him to be hon
est?" Haress said. "He will take
bribes to just make sure that he has
a house to live, that his children go to
school, and they have enough to eat,
and they have enough clothes."
Additionally, the relatively high
number of women pursuing law de
grees or taking law-related classes
at AUAF a continuing achieve
ment for ALEP might also be
jeopardized by a resurgence of the
Taliban and increased insecurity in
the country.
Despite the numerous obstacles
that ALEP has to confront, much op
timism has been expressed sur
rounding the continued endurance of
the program.
With growing demand for text
books from Afghan law students as
well as the growing interest in real
life legal educational experience from
Stanford students, ALEP was
awarded an additional $7.24 million
grant from the U.S. Department of
State in 2012, which, according to
Karsh, allowed the project to expand
its efforts significantly and further
strengthen its partnership with
AUAF.
The latest grant lasts until 2017,
and according to Jensen, many

grants given by the U.S. government
are intentionally longer term, in part
to assuage the fears among Afghans
about the uncertainty post-2014 and
refute the idea that the U.S. will just
pick up and ship out of Afghanistan
as history might warn.
"I think American University [in
Afghanistan] will continue," Haress
said. "I think the number of students
that we have here will continue to
study here, because it's one of the
most prestigious educational institu
tions that we have in the country."
Jensen further explained that
they have hired a new professor this
year from the Nangarhar province of
Afghanistan, an area that experi
ences significant security challenges.
They are also working to develop
closer ties with Nangarhar Universi
ty to increase outreach and textbook
distribution beyond Kabul.
A group of Stanford law students
currently working with ALEP is
scheduled to travel to Kabul in Feb
ruary 2014 to meet with AUAF law
professors, judicial officials, and min
isters, as well as the AUAF students
who will provide them with feedback
on their textbooks.
"We have a mandate," Karsh said.
"We are helping to establish this law
department and we're providing cur-

riculum for the next five years. No
matter what happens in 2014, we are
going to continue providing this edu
cational opportunity."

ALEP students traveled to Afghanistan earlier this year to observe classes
at the American University of Afghanistan, where the project helped
establish the foreign university's law department and degree program.
