# ELUSIVE TITLE DENIED BY USC
## 
### LUKE ASPERGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Its first Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation championship since
2004 seemed within reach for the
Stanford men's water polo team on
Sunday as it faced off against the
No. 4 seeded USC in the tourna
ment finals. In the end, however,
the title just eluded the No. 2 seed
ed Cardinal, who fell 10-8 to the
Trojans.

Other than a 1-0 lead to open the
game, Stanford spent the entire
match playing from behind, and the
clock ran out on the Cardinal's
valiant attempt to overcome a five
goal deficit in the final period. Stan
ford reached the finals on the heels
of a 12-6 win against seventh-seeded
Long Beach State and a narrow 11-
10 victory against third-seeded
UCLA.
Stanford, who had just barely
edged out USC two weeks earlier
with a 17-16 double-overtime victory
in a conference game, got on the
board first thanks to top-scoring

sophomore Bret Bonanni. However,
the Trojans were quick to seek re
venge, sandwiching a Stanford goal
with three-goal and two-goal runs to
take a 5-2 lead. The teams traded
goals to end the half, leaving USC
with a 6-3 lead.
Stanford scored to open the sec
ond half, but quickly watched as the
USC offense erupted for another
three-goal run. By the time the third
quarter ended, the Trojans sat on a
comfortable 10-5 lead.
Despite the deficit, the Cardinal
refused to give up. Stanford took
control of the game both offensive
ly and defensively, completely shut
ting down the Trojan offense and
putting pressure on USC with a
three-goal run capped off by two in
a row from junior Alex Bowen with
the clock ticking down. However,
three would not be enough for the
Cardinal, who still trailed by two
goals when the final whistle blew,
signaling Stanford's second-place
conference finish.
In Saturday's semifinal match, a
commanding early lead and clutch
defense in the final seconds gave
Stanford the victory over the Brains
in order to advance to the finals. The
Cardinal scored early and often to
begin the game, and by the time the
dust had settled and the first quarter

was over, Stanford was riding a 6-1
lead. UCLA fought back over the
next two quarters, but the Cardinal
did not let up either and the score
stood at 10-6 in favor of Stanford en
tering the fourth quarter.
The Bruins cut the lead to 10-7 to
start the fourth, but Bowen scored
on a 6-on-5 opportunity to maintain
the four-goal spread. UCLA contin
ued to pressure the Stanford de
fense, and Cristiano Mirarchi
capped off a three-goal run by scor
ing at the 1:31 and 33-second marks.
With only a one-goal lead, the Cardi
nal managed to keep the ball away

from the Bruins long enough to run
out the clock and secure the win.
Bowen led the offense with five
goals.
The first half of Friday's quarter
final match against Long Beach
State was dead even. With neither
team able to maintain a lead, the
Cardinal and the 49ers entered the
second half with five goals apiece.
The 49ers pulled ahead 5-6 to
start the second half, but after that
the Cardinal offense dug deep and
never looked back. Fifth-year senior
Paul Rudolph scored twice to put
the Cardinal ahead 7-6, and Stan

ford kept going, racking up a seven
goal run before the final whistle
blew. Bonanni lead the Cardinal
with five goals, and Rudolph added
four.
With the second-place finish,
Stanford (21-5) earned an at-large
bid into the upcoming NCAA tour
nament, which begins Thursday at
Avery Aquatic Center. Stanford is
the third seed out of six and takes
on sixth-seeded Whittier College
Thursday at 2:45 p.m.
