# UNEXPECTED PLAYOFF RUN ENDS FOR CARD
## 
### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At first glance, the contortion of
the body and the tangle of legs as
sociated with the flip throw-in
seems gimmicky, a gymnast's play
thing dragged onto the soccer field.
In the right hands, however, this
maneuver, designed to launch the
ball over huge distances into oppos
ing penalty boxes, can be deadly.
The Stanford Cardinal (10-7-4,
3-5-2 Pac-12) learned that lesson
the hard way on Sunday night as its
dreams for the College Cup came
to a shuddering halt at the hands of
the Pac-12 champion Washington
Huskies (16-1-4, 7-1-2), who will
now advance to an Elite Eight
matchup against New Mexico with
a 1-0 win.

Stanford could only watch as
Husky senior defender Michael
Harris twisted his body one last
time, sending the ball soaring
through the brisk Lake Washing
ton air and onto the head of sopho
more defender lan Lange, who dis
patched the chance. Game over;
season over. Stanford fought
valiantly for the last seven minutes,
but to no avail.
Coming in as the unseeded un
derdog, Stanford knew that it
would have to play the Huskies
tight, hoping to cut down on mis

takes and perhaps sneak a goal that
could give it the crucial advantage.
For much of the game, this plan
worked to perfection as the fourth
seeded Huskies only registered two
shots on goal for the entire game.
The defense held stout, marshaled
well by senior goalkeeper Drew
Hutchins, who was often called up
on to punch clear the crosses and
throws that flew into the box.
Alongside fellow seniors Tyler Con
klin and JJ Koval, it seemed that he
was trying to ensure that he didn't
have to go home quite yet. In total,
both teams only managed to regis
ter five shots for the entire first
half, all of which were off target.
However, the game began to open
up in the second half, as Washington
freshman forward Mason Robertson
curled a shot just high and wide be
fore Stanford senior midfielder Bob
by Edwards replied with a shot that
stung the palms of Husky goalie
Ryan Herman. Chances were few
and far between, with Stanford
freshman forward Jordan Morris
coming closest with a shot that he hit
just over the bar in the 80th minute.
Finally, though, Washington got the
breakthrough it had been seeking
when Harris notched his 10th assist
of the season all of which have
come on throw-ins.
"I'm extremely proud of the way
the team played all season and the
way we played tonight," said Stan
ford head coach Jeremy Gunn.
Gunn had reason to be proud, as
Stanford returned to the NCAA
Tournament for the first time since
2009 and was one of only four un

seeded teams to advance to the
Sweet Sixteen.
Stanford will look to reload and
regroup next year, having secured
what appears to be a very strong
recruiting class, as it will try again
to return to the dizzying heights of
the tournament. This year was not
its year, but the moments created
and the run through the tourna
ment will be something that the
team, especially the leaving sen
iors, will never forget.
"It was an outstanding season,"
Gunn said, "and we have a great
group of guys; the whole group
bought in and worked hard."
That sentiment was shared by
the Pae-12 conference, which
awarded eight Stanford players all
league honors. The Cardinal placed
three players on the first team
tied with Washington for most
among conference teams as jun
ior forward Zach Batteer, senior
midfielder JJ Koval and freshman
forward Jordan Morris achieved
this distinction. Sophomore defend
er Brandon Vincent was named to
the second team while senior de
fender Ty Conklin, sophomore mid
fielders Aaron Kovar and
Thompson and senior goalkeeper
Drew Hutchins were all given hon
orable mentions.
In the darkness of the Seattle
sky and the cold night air, Stan
ford's season reluctantly came to a
halt. The future, however, is begin
ning to look brighter and brighter.
