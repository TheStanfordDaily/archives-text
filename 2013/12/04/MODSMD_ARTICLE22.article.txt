# CARD ROUTS JACKRABBITS

### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
After a frustrating 88-67 loss
to Pittsburgh last week in the
championship game of the Pro
gressive Legends Classic, the
Stanford men's basketball team
was able to exorcise some of its
demons on Sunday night with a
92-60 rout of the South Dakota
State (SDSU) Jackrabbits in the
final game of the Classic at
Maples Pavilion. The win sent the
team into the two-week finals
break on a positive note and deliv
ered head coach Johnny Dawkins
his 100 th career victory.

After being outplayed from
start to finish by Pitt in the game
last Tuesday, Stanford (6-2)
looked to jump out to a quick start
in Sunday's contest. The Cardinal
had started slowly in almost every
game this season but reversed
that trend this time around, scor
ing the first 13 points of the game
en route to an early 19-3 lead.
The Cardinal widened the gap
behind hot shooting and equally
cold marksmanship from the
Jackrabbits (3-6). Stanford shot a
blistering 66.7 percent from the
field in the first half while holding
SDSU to just 30 percent. It
marked the best defensive half of
the season for Stanford from both
a points (24) and shooting-per
centage standpoint.
"I thought we got off to just a
very good start. Right from the

beginning our guys were ready to
go," Dawkins said. "Something we
had talked about was seeing if we
could start games better, and our
kids did a great job of it today."
Junior Chasson Randle led the
charge in the first half with 17
points and three assists for Stan
ford, while seniors Anthony
Brown and Josh Huestis added 14
and 10 points respectively. Stan
ford dominated just about every
aspect of the game in racing out to
a 34-point halftime lead (58-24),
having outshot, outrebounded and
out-assisted SDSU.
SDSU, which was a 25-win
NCAA-tournament team a season
ago, is clearly not the same with
out current Milwaukee Bucks
guard Nate Wolters. Wolters, a
third-team Ail-American for the
2013 season, was the leader of a
team that never quit and could
shoot the lights out on any given
night. With their former leader
gone, it is clear that at least in
the early part of this season
the Jackrabbits are still searching
for their identity. The lone bright
spot for the Jackrabbits was the
play of seniors Brayden Carlson
and Jordan Dykstra, who finished
with 16 and 20 points respectively.
For the Cardinal, Randle's 21
points marked the fifth straight
game and sixth time this season
that a Stanford player had tallied
at least 20 points in a game.
Brown finished with 19 points,
eight rebounds and four assists to
continue the strong start to his
comeback season, while Huestis
contributed 13 points, eight re
bounds and four blocks in a solid
