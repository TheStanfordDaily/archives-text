## VanDerveer becomes fifth NCAA women's basketball coach to 900 wins 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 6 Stanford women's basket
ball ended its week of play in Puer
to Vallarta, Mexico, with an 80-60
win over South Dakota State to cap
ture the 2013 Hardwood Tourna
ment of Hope title.
Thursday's win, however, wasn't
as big of an accomplishment for the
team or for head coach Tara Van-
Derveer as the night before an
83-59 win over Florida Gulf Coast
which marked VanDerveer's 900 th
career win.

VanDerveer is only the fifth
women's basketball coach to reach
the 900-win mark, joining an exclu
sive club that includes former Ten
nessee head coach Pat Summit. In
her storied career, VanDerveer is
901-204, with 748 of those wins oc
curring while at the helm of Stan
ford's program.
"It goes fast," VanDerveer said.
"I can remember my first game,
playing a lot of games in different
places. Obviously, some really big
games, but it goes really fast. I'm
very thankful for the places I've
coached, the assistants I've worked
with, the athletic directors I've
worked for, the outstanding players
I've coached, and the fabulous fans
at Idaho, Ohio State and Stanford."
Stanford went 3-0 while in Mex
ico, improving its record to 7-1. Its
first win was an 86-69 romp against
Purdue. Stanford shot a season
high 61.7 percent from the field led
by senior forward Chiney Ogwu
mike's 22 points. Despite having to
sit out much of the first half due to
early foul trouble only playing
nine minutes Ogwumike scored
17 points in the second half.
"This was a big momentum
game because a lot of people made
big contributions, like Sara James
and [Erica McCall]," Ogwumike
said. "So I think that we can build
off the things we had today and get
better from it. Our aggressiveness,

especially in the second half, over
coming the foul trouble helped us
separate and win."
In its win against Florida Gulf
Coast, the Card was led by the dou
ble-doubles of Ogwumike and fifth
year senior Mikaela Ruef. Ogwu
mike had 27 points and 13 rebounds
while Ruef had a career-high 14
points, finished six of eight from the
field and grabbed 12 rebounds. A
quick stake to a 34-12 lead within
the first 12 minutes of the game left
no doubt that VanDerveer would
only need the one game to go from
win 899 to win 900.
On Thanksgiving Day, the Card
came out sluggish, trailing South
Dakota State 10-8 five minutes into
the first half before taking com
mand with a 32-11 run to lead 40-19
heading into halftime. The Card
outrebounded the Jackrabbits 41-
28 and out-played them on the de
fensive end, forcing 22 turnovers
and snagging a season-high 14
steals, five of them coming from
junior point guard Amber Orrange.
Orrange also impressed on the of
fensive end, shooting five for six
from the field for 13 points.
Also contributing for the Card
were the four active freshmen play
ers: Karlie Samuelson, Lili Thomp
son, Kailee Johnson and Erica Mc-
Call. The freshmen combined for 30
points, led by Johnson's 10. In addi
tion, Ruef dished out a career-high
seven assists and grabbed 12 re
bounds.
Ogwumike wrapped up the
three-game trip with 29 points, av
eraging 26 points and 11 rebounds
per game while shooting 78 percent
to win tournament MVP honors.
"This was a great trip for us this
week. I think we've grown a lot.
We're playing a lot of people, a lot of
young people," VanDerveer said.
"Now we'll go home and get ready
for finals, and Gonzaga, New Mexi
co and Tennessee."
The Card will take a break from
play during Dead Week and Finals
Week before returning to Maples
Pavilion on Dec. 14 to take on Gon
zaga at 1 p.m.

young people," VanDerveer said.

for finals, and Gonzaga, New Mexi
co and Tennessee."
