## Mitch Albom visits Silicon Valley: The 						Good, the Bad and the Ugly 
### DANIA MARINSHAW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Author Mitch Albom's
sold-out talk at Kepler
Books in Menlo Park on
Nov. 20 marked the fi
nal stop on his national
book tour. He spoke
about his latest book, "The
First Phone Call From Heav
en," which details a group of
residents from a small town
who begin to receive calls from
deceased loved ones, presum
ably from heaven. Following
the path of several of his previ
ous books, the novel reached
the top of The New York Times
bestseller list that day. Among
other topics, Albom discussed
the importance of preserving
the human voice in an increas
ingly digital world.
After listening to an hour
of Albom's personal anecdotes,
writing rituals and tips, as well
as a short reading of his new
novel, here are some of my
brief impressions of the au
thor's visit:

The Good
1. Albom made it clear
that not everyone is better off
trading humanistic lives and ca
reers for the tech world, re
counting his visit to Facebook
headquarters before the Ke
pler's talk that evening. After
attempting to answer the com
pany's "Question of the Day"
on the wall of the men's room
("I didn't understand one
word. Some kind of code ...

that presupposes that you've
ever written code. I've never
felt like a failure in a urinal be
fore."), he concluded that the
world of Facebookers and Sili
con Valley is "just too swirly for
me." Well put, Mitch.
2. On a similar note, Al
bom knew his audience. The
author encouraged what he (al
most certainly) correctly iden

tified as tech-sawy listeners to
beware of what can be lost by
relying too heavily on digital
communication rather than
face-to-face interaction and
connection. "It wasn't called
'Texting with Morrie,'" he
stressed.

3. As part of Kepler's Arts
and Lectures series a non
profit forum committed to pre
senting "a diverse range of en
riching sessions with leading
authors" Albom's high-pro
file name brought attention to a
small, independent bookstore.
Three cheers for local business.

The Bad
"The First Phone Call
from Heaven" is fluffy and pre
dictable. After hearing Albom
read the first few pages, my cu
riosity was satiated. The author
himself admitted that "what
happens is what would proba
bly happen" if the same events
took place in real life. Like
many of Albom's books,
though, his new novel leaves
the reader feeling comforted
and hopeful, making its value
hard to discredit. Sometimes
easy reads are good reads.

The Ugly
Perhaps being a widely
beloved author of inspirational
books grants one a certain le
niency when it comes to public
speaking, but I was a bit over
whelmed and disappointed by
the "preachiness" of Albom's
talk, chock-full of reflections
on Meaning and Faith and
Miracles. Knowing that Albom
is not only a successful novel
ist but also a lauded journalist
and playwright, I was expect
ing fewer truisms ("If it's a
miracle to you, it's a miracle.")
and more original observa
tions.
