# Food Review
## Ciao Bello, Piemonte 
### RENJIE WONG FOOD DRINK EDITOR 
Over Thanksgiving break I
spent a week gallivanting
around the streets of New
York. For a first visit, the no
toriously crabby winter
weather truly didn't disap
point it was the coldest week on
record in the city since January, and
Winter Storm Boreas made things
slightly, shall we say, damp.
What did disappoint, however,
was a certain world-famous Italian
restaurant that shall remain un
named. After roughing it out on the
frigid streets of the Upper East Side,
I was thoroughly looking forward to
being pampered by a coddling caval
cade of la cucina della nonna; the
Michelin-starred Big Apple institu
tion was, after all, a significant part
of why I was in the city. I won't even
dignify it with a detailed recount of
the horrific meal, but suffice to say,
insect legs do not an haute cuisine
garnish make.

And so Italian-induced PTSD
attacks ongoing I approached Pa
lo Alto's very own Italian institution,
II Fornaio, with great trepidation.
The restaurant, which incidentally is
as old as I am, runs a regional festi
val two weeks out of every month,
serving up local specialties from
each of 11 handpicked regions in
Italy. They had me at hellocal.
Clearly my worries were unwar
ranted, because the meal was every
thing that I had hoped it to be. It did
n't hurt, of course, that the region of
the month was the Piemonte, a
sprawling estate in the North bor
dering France and Switzerland that
is world-renowned for its spectacu
lar white truffles and carnaroli rice.

We started off with the zuppa
di patate, porcini e porri, a
uniquely Italian take on the classic
French vichyssoise soup. The porcini
added a wonderful meatiness to the
dish, elevated by a delicate drizzle of
white truffle oil; meanwhile, a fonti
na-topped crouton could not have
been put to better use than to mop
up the last drops of the soup.
Our appetites suitably whetted,
we moved on to the insalata del
Furmagiat, a verdant mix of Belgian
endive, Bosc pear, garbanzo beans,

arugula and farro. Now, people who
know me know that I'd sooner be
come a peasant farmer than eat far
ro, but in the name of journalistic
valor I had a mouthful... and then
another, and another, until it had all
but vanished off my plate. The gas
tronomic alchemy here lay in a di
vine boschetta al tartufo, a semi
soft cheese speckled with earthy
shavings of Alba white truffle that is
rarely found outside of Italy.
A tasting platter of four differ
ent pasta offerings was next. The
gnocchi con brasato coniglio
paired dense potato dumplings with
a rich ragu of braised rabbit, delight
fully avoiding the musky gaminess
that the animal tends to retain; shav
ings of grana padano imparted an
appropriately salty tang to the warm,
comforting dish. Cannelloni alia
montanara quickly followed: Fork
tender house-made pasta tubes
were stuffed with prosciutto di Par
ma, mortadella, veal, spinach and
Grana Padano, held together with a
silky tomato-tarragon bechamel
sauce. Oven-baked, this dish single
handedly made me question why
anyone ever bothered with Chef Bo
yardee lasagne (or any other food,
for that matter).
The agnolotti di fonduta ai
porcini brought together ravioli of
fontina, which were coated in an in
tensely creamy porcini sauce. Truf
fles were never far from sight in this
meal, and the unctuous parcels were
infused with the deep, powerful
scent of white truffles, making it
truly ambrosial.
Saving the best for the last, the
risotto con porcini e gam
beretti was a dense heap of creamy
grains imported from the town of
Vercelli, cooked to that perfect con
sistency the Italians call all'onda, or
"wave-like." The porcini and prawns
afforded both textural contrast and a
magnificent umami savoriness to
the dish, rounding off its heaviness
with natural sweetness.

The parade of stellar dishes
marched gloriously on, starting with
a unique filetto di branzino al-
I'uva a wild sea bass filet
sauteed with champagne vinegar,
thyme and green grapes. Pan-fried to
a crisp, the pristine fish combined
with the sweet tartness of the

grapes in a delicate flourish that few
chefs are able to achieve. The
suprema di polio ripiena, per
haps more familiar to American
palates, nevertheless managed to
surprise: Breaded and pan-fried, a
hefty chunk of chicken breast was
stuffed with prosciutto di Parma and
fontina cheese, oozing out in a most
graphic manner (almost too NSFW
to describe). Drizzled with a Dijon
mustard sauce the French town
is, after all, right across the border
from Piemonte the dish was an
exercise in decadence.

But nothing could come close
to the unbridled debauchery that
was the bra.sa.to al Barbera, a
breathtaking heap of beef short ribs
braised for hours in Barbera, the
King of Wines; short of sipping on
the velvety red on the balcony of an
Italian villa on a balmy fall evening,
this was perhaps the best way to en
counter it. As if in a nominal attempt
to ameliorate the sinfulness of the
meat, root vegetables, mashed pota
toes, and sauteed spinach provided
some semblance of healthfulness to
the dish (wholly unnecessary, in my
opinion!).
As a simple, comforting end to
what was by now a full-on feast, we
wrapped up the meal with sfoglia
ta di pere con gelato alle nocci
ole-, a warm, flaky puff pastry tart
encased caramelized pear and toast
ed walnuts, and —in a respectful
nod to the famed hazelnuts of
Piemonte, made famous worldwide
with the Chocolate Tears of the An
gels, Nutella topped with a hulk
ing sphere of hazelnut gelato.
Stumbling out of the restaurant
after the meal into the brisk Cali
fornian air, my mind wandered back
to that horrific New York meal. If, I
concluded, the food critics have be
stowed a constellation of Michelin
stars onto that wretched restaurant,
and not a fine, truly authentic insti
tution like II Fornaio, perhaps these
experts ought to re-evaluate their
judging criteria.
Or, at the very least, perhaps I
ought to just stay in Palo Alto for my
next Thanksgiving culinary adven
ture.

haps more familiar to American
palates, nevertheless managed to
surprise: Breaded and pan-fried, a
hefty chunk of chicken breast was
stuffed with prosciutto di Parma and
fontina cheese, oozing out in a most
graphic manner (almost too NSFW
to describe). Drizzled with a Dijon
mustard sauce the French town
is, after all, right across the border
from Piemonte the dish was an
exercise in decadence.

But nothing could come close
to the unbridled debauchery that
was the bra.sa.to al Barbera, a
breathtaking heap of beef short ribs
braised for hours in Barbera, the
King of Wines; short of sipping on
the velvety red on the balcony of an
Italian villa on a balmy fall evening,
this was perhaps the best way to en
counter it. As if in a nominal attempt
to ameliorate the sinfulness of the
meat, root vegetables, mashed pota
toes, and sauteed spinach provided
some semblance of healthfulness to
the dish (wholly unnecessary, in my
opinion!).
As a simple, comforting end to
what was by now a full-on feast, we
wrapped up the meal with sfoglia
ta di pere con gelato alle nocci
ole-, a warm, flaky puff pastry tart
encased caramelized pear and toast
ed walnuts, and —in a respectful
nod to the famed hazelnuts of
Piemonte, made famous worldwide
with the Chocolate Tears of the An
gels, Nutella topped with a hulk
ing sphere of hazelnut gelato.
Stumbling out of the restaurant
after the meal into the brisk Cali
fornian air, my mind wandered back
to that horrific New York meal. If, I
concluded, the food critics have be
stowed a constellation of Michelin
stars onto that wretched restaurant,
and not a fine, truly authentic insti
tution like II Fornaio, perhaps these
experts ought to re-evaluate their
judging criteria.
Or, at the very least, perhaps I
ought to just stay in Palo Alto for my
next Thanksgiving culinary adven
ture.

Located on University Avenue in Palo Alto, II Fornaio dishes up some of the most authentic and delicious
Italian cuisine in the Bay Area. Such dishes include the breaded and pan-fried supreme di polio, pictured above.
Over Thanksgiving break I
spent a week gallivanting
around the streets of New
York. For a first visit, the no
toriously crabby winter
weather truly didn't disap
point it was the coldest week on
record in the city since January, and
Winter Storm Boreas made things
slightly, shall we say, damp.
What did disappoint, however,
was a certain world-famous Italian
restaurant that shall remain un
named. After roughing it out on the
frigid streets of the Upper East Side,
I was thoroughly looking forward to
being pampered by a coddling caval
cade of la cucina della nonna; the
Michelin-starred Big Apple institu
tion was, after all, a significant part
of why I was in the city. I won't even
dignify it with a detailed recount of
the horrific meal, but suffice to say,
insect legs do not an haute cuisine
garnish make.

And so Italian-induced PTSD
attacks ongoing I approached Pa
lo Alto's very own Italian institution,
II Fornaio, with great trepidation.
The restaurant, which incidentally is
as old as I am, runs a regional festi
val two weeks out of every month,
serving up local specialties from
each of 11 handpicked regions in
Italy. They had me at hellocal.
Clearly my worries were unwar
ranted, because the meal was every
thing that I had hoped it to be. It did
n't hurt, of course, that the region of
the month was the Piemonte, a
sprawling estate in the North bor
dering France and Switzerland that
is world-renowned for its spectacu
lar white truffles and carnaroli rice.

We started off with the zuppa
di patate, porcini e porri, a
uniquely Italian take on the classic
French vichyssoise soup. The porcini
added a wonderful meatiness to the
dish, elevated by a delicate drizzle of
white truffle oil; meanwhile, a fonti
na-topped crouton could not have
been put to better use than to mop
up the last drops of the soup.
Our appetites suitably whetted,
we moved on to the insalata del
Furmagiat, a verdant mix of Belgian
endive, Bosc pear, garbanzo beans,

arugula and farro. Now, people who
know me know that I'd sooner be
come a peasant farmer than eat far
ro, but in the name of journalistic
valor I had a mouthful... and then
another, and another, until it had all
but vanished off my plate. The gas
tronomic alchemy here lay in a di
vine boschetta al tartufo, a semi
soft cheese speckled with earthy
shavings of Alba white truffle that is
rarely found outside of Italy.
A tasting platter of four differ
ent pasta offerings was next. The
gnocchi con brasato coniglio
paired dense potato dumplings with
a rich ragu of braised rabbit, delight
fully avoiding the musky gaminess
that the animal tends to retain; shav
ings of grana padano imparted an
appropriately salty tang to the warm,
comforting dish. Cannelloni alia
montanara quickly followed: Fork
tender house-made pasta tubes
were stuffed with prosciutto di Par
ma, mortadella, veal, spinach and
Grana Padano, held together with a
silky tomato-tarragon bechamel
sauce. Oven-baked, this dish single
handedly made me question why
anyone ever bothered with Chef Bo
yardee lasagne (or any other food,
for that matter).
The agnolotti di fonduta ai
porcini brought together ravioli of
fontina, which were coated in an in
tensely creamy porcini sauce. Truf
fles were never far from sight in this
meal, and the unctuous parcels were
infused with the deep, powerful
scent of white truffles, making it
truly ambrosial.
Saving the best for the last, the
risotto con porcini e gam
beretti was a dense heap of creamy
grains imported from the town of
Vercelli, cooked to that perfect con
sistency the Italians call all'onda, or
"wave-like." The porcini and prawns
afforded both textural contrast and a
magnificent umami savoriness to
the dish, rounding off its heaviness
with natural sweetness.

The parade of stellar dishes
marched gloriously on, starting with
a unique filetto di branzino al-
I'uva a wild sea bass filet
sauteed with champagne vinegar,
thyme and green grapes. Pan-fried to
a crisp, the pristine fish combined
with the sweet tartness of the

grapes in a delicate flourish that few
chefs are able to achieve. The

haps more familiar to American
