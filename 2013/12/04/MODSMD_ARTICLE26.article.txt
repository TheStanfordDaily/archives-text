## 2014 Fashions to Look Forward 
### LAYNIE STEPHENS FASHION COLUMNIST 
As the year comes to an end, I can think
of hundreds of fashion highlights from
2013. It was a great year, but I'm even
more excited to see what next year
and next quarter will bring. You have
plenty of time over winter break to
update your wardrobe, so no excuses come
winter quarter! I'm looking forward to seeing

the following fashion updates around cam

1. Play with texture. Texture is everything
when it comes to differentiating between
a good outfit and a fantastic outfit. Winter
quarter will definitely get chilly, so now's the
time to get out all your bulky knit sweaters
and scarves. Mix them together for some
thing new and different. You don't have to
just mix knits though what about lace,

leather and metal detailing? How about
adding in a little pattern? I'm not saying you
need cosmic or psychedelic patterns every
day, but completing a look with a unique
print never hurt anyone.
2. Make business casual the new casual.
Seriously, how often do I need to talk
about dressing for the occasion? Next quar
ter, I'm challenging you to make "business ca
sual" the new "casual," but actually I'm just

hoping that next quarter will bring fewer
sweatpants out of your dorm rooms. Think
about what you're wearing and the image
you portray. Who do you take more seriously:
someone dressed professionally or someone
in yoga pants and a freshman dorm t-shirt?
(Hint: someone dressed professionally.) Re
member this when you're getting dressed in
the morning next quarter! It really doesn't
