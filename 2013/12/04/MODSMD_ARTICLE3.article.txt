## Humanities career resources expand Departments, CDC and GSB offer internships, networking training 
### SARAH MOORE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite concerns about the
popularity of the humanities at
Stanford, University adminis
trators say they are not wor
ried about enrollment in the
humanities or the post-gradua
tion career opportunities for
students in these departments,
in part because of the introduc

According to Vice Provost
of Undergraduate Education
Harry Elam, the number of
undergraduates majoring in
the humanities over the past 10
years has remained relatively
stable.
Data from the Office of
Graduate and Undergraduate
Studies within the School of
Humanities and Sciences
shows that last academic year,
the University had 253 bache

and arts majors. There were
265 for the 2011-12 academic
year, 254 for 2010-11 and 262
for 2009-10.
Elam stated that two prior

ities the University must con

the humanities departments on
campus and dealing with stu

about the economic stability of
a humanities degree.
"I've seen history majors
who have gone to work for
Google because Google wants
people who can synthesize in
formation," Elam said. "Par
ents should understand that
their child is not going to suffer
[with a humanities degree] and
will probably be better off do
ing something they really want
to do rather than a means to an
end."
Existing career resources for
humanities students
In alignment with the prior
ities that Elam outlined, the
University provides support
for humanities students within
the departments as well as at
the administrative level.
Katie McDonough, humani
ties and arts initiatives coordi
nator for the School of Human

position was created to help in-
