## Humanities career resources expand Departments, CDC and GSB offer internships, networking training 
### SARAH MOORE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite concerns about the
popularity of the humanities at
Stanford, University adminis
trators say they are not wor
ried about enrollment in the
humanities or the post-gradua
tion career opportunities for
students in these departments,
in part because of the introduc
tion of more resources.
According to Vice Provost
of Undergraduate Education
Harry Elam, the number of
undergraduates majoring in
the humanities over the past 10
years has remained relatively
stable.
Data from the Office of
Graduate and Undergraduate
Studies within the School of
Humanities and Sciences
shows that last academic year,
the University had 253 bache
lor's conferrals for humanities
and arts majors. There were
265 for the 2011-12 academic
year, 254 for 2010-11 and 262
for 2009-10.
Elam stated that two prior

ities the University must con
sider when promoting the hu
manities at Stanford are publi
cizing the top-level quality of
the humanities departments on
campus and dealing with stu
dent and parent concerns
about the economic stability of
a humanities degree.
"I've seen history majors
who have gone to work for
Google because Google wants
people who can synthesize in
formation," Elam said. "Par
ents should understand that
their child is not going to suffer
[with a humanities degree] and
will probably be better off do
ing something they really want
to do rather than a means to an
end."
Existing career resources for
humanities students
In alignment with the prior
ities that Elam outlined, the
University provides support
for humanities students within
the departments as well as at
the administrative level.
Katie McDonough, humani
ties and arts initiatives coordi
nator for the School of Human
ities and Sciences, said that her
position was created to help in-

crease the visibility and acees-
sibility of courses, faculty research
and programs within the humani
ties.
McDonough stated that elite uni
versities around the country, includ
ing Stanford, are seeking to collect
more data about what alumni who
graduated with degrees in the hu
manities have done after graduation
in order to educate humanities stu
dents about employment possibili
ties.
Richard Sailer, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
has expressed the same confidence
about the futures of humanities ma
jors.
"The truth is that we don't have
very detailed data on the careers of
our humanities graduates, but we
do know that they have done very
well, and we are gathering system
atic data about them careers and ad
mittance to professional school,"
Sailer said.
Individual humanities depart
ments provide job-oriented re
sources for their students, McDo
nough said. She added that depart
ments help connect students with
internships for career experience
and even offer funding for unpaid
internships.
Katie Dooling, undergraduate
student services coordinator for the
English Department, said that in
the past three years the department
has provided grants to students for
summer internships, including the
Kaplan Endowment which awards
grants of $l,OOO to help subsidize all
or part of an internship at an organ
ization that allows students to use
them academic experience as Eng
lish majors at work.
"We don't want students to feel
like they can't participate in intern
ships that are unpaid because they
have to make money during the
summer," Dooling said. "Then later
it's great to hear back from them
about what they found interesting
and how they applied their English
knowledge in this field."
The department also puts on two
panels with alumni who speak about
their careers, whether as writers or
in other fields, such as business.
"For English students, it's not a
limitation on what you can do, but
you have so many options that you
need to figure out what you want to
do," Dooling said.
Increasing career opportunities
for humanities majors
Departments and organizations

across campus are developing new
programs and resources in order to
help introduce those in the humani
ties to opportunities beyond Stan
ford and inspire confidence in their
choice of major.
One new course, Music 6P: Art
Is My Occupation: Professional De
velopment for Creatives, offered
through the Arts Institute will
launch in winter quarter, featuring
guest speakers with careers in arts
administration and practicing art.
Paula Salazar 'l3, arts in student
life coordinator for the Arts Insti
tute, believes that the arts are thriv
ing at Stanford and that the best
way for students to orient them
selves toward a career is to first dis
cover their passions.
Salazar talked about her own
personal experience as an art histo
ry major, stating that being part of
the founding team of The Stanford
Arts Review a publication fea
turing original work and commen
tary expanded her thinking
about her major in away that
helped her reach out to a larger
community.
"Stanford humanities majors
have the opportunity to develop a
skill set beyond knowledge that
may fade away over time," Salazar
said. "Being able to write a really
good essay translates into being
able to write a really great report
for your supervisors."
"It's important especially for hu
manities majors to think about their
skill set in this way, and a lot of dif
ferent fields and jobs will suddenly
seem open," she added.
The Career Development Cen
ter (CDC) is also working to help
students in the humanities and arts
by offering more career counseling,
according to Margot Gilliland, CDC
assistant director for students in the
humanities and sciences.
The CDC is making efforts to
work closely with individual depart
ments, and Gilliland herself also
holds office hours in the English and
history departments. Additionally,
the CDC is offering Career Mee
tups this year as a casual way for
students to talk about job search
strategies.
Humanities majors often have
strong communication and analyti
cal skills as well as a developed abil
ity to work on teams, according to
Gilliland, and the CDC's new efforts
aim to teach students how to market
those strengths.
Gilliland also noted that in Feb
ruary there will be a humanities and
sciences career fair featuring em
ployers specifically looking for the
skills that come with these types of
majors.
Another new resource for hu

manities majors is the opportunity
to participate in the Summer Insti
tute for General Management
(SIGM) at the Graduate School of
Business. SIGM is a four-week full
time summer program aimed at
providing business knowledge and
improving career-oriented skills for
non-business majors.
With support from the Office of
the President, the program offers
students majoring in the humanities

and arts financial aid based on need
for up to the full tuition cost of
$10,750.
"We hope that a funded opportu
nity like this will be an encourage
ment to students who feel like oth
erwise they might need to major in
something that does have more of a
business focus," McDonough said.
Despite existing and future re
sources available to undergraduate
majors in the humanities and arts,

McDonough expressed concern that
many of these opportunities are not
well known around campus.
"[These opportunities] are
things that potentially could attract
students to the humanities and the
arts if they knew they existed be
fore they declare," McDonough
said.

nator for the School of Human
ities and Sciences, said that her
position was created to help in-

crease the visibility and acees-
sibility of courses, faculty research
and programs within the humani
ties.
McDonough stated that elite uni
versities around the country, includ
ing Stanford, are seeking to collect
more data about what alumni who
graduated with degrees in the hu
manities have done after graduation
in order to educate humanities stu
dents about employment possibili
ties.
Richard Sailer, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
has expressed the same confidence
about the futures of humanities ma
jors.
"The truth is that we don't have
very detailed data on the careers of
our humanities graduates, but we
do know that they have done very
well, and we are gathering system
atic data about them careers and ad
mittance to professional school,"
Sailer said.
Individual humanities depart
ments provide job-oriented re
sources for their students, McDo
nough said. She added that depart
ments help connect students with
internships for career experience
and even offer funding for unpaid
internships.
Katie Dooling, undergraduate
student services coordinator for the
English Department, said that in
the past three years the department
has provided grants to students for
summer internships, including the
Kaplan Endowment which awards
grants of $l,OOO to help subsidize all
or part of an internship at an organ
ization that allows students to use
them academic experience as Eng
lish majors at work.
"We don't want students to feel
like they can't participate in intern
ships that are unpaid because they
have to make money during the
summer," Dooling said. "Then later
it's great to hear back from them
about what they found interesting
and how they applied their English
knowledge in this field."
The department also puts on two
panels with alumni who speak about
their careers, whether as writers or
in other fields, such as business.
"For English students, it's not a
limitation on what you can do, but
you have so many options that you
need to figure out what you want to
do," Dooling said.
Increasing career opportunities
for humanities majors
Departments and organizations

across campus are developing new
programs and resources in order to
help introduce those in the humani
ties to opportunities beyond Stan
ford and inspire confidence in their
choice of major.
One new course, Music 6P: Art
Is My Occupation: Professional De
velopment for Creatives, offered
through the Arts Institute will
launch in winter quarter, featuring
guest speakers with careers in arts
administration and practicing art.
Paula Salazar 'l3, arts in student
life coordinator for the Arts Insti
tute, believes that the arts are thriv
ing at Stanford and that the best
way for students to orient them
selves toward a career is to first dis
cover their passions.
Salazar talked about her own
personal experience as an art histo
ry major, stating that being part of
the founding team of The Stanford
Arts Review a publication fea
turing original work and commen
tary expanded her thinking
about her major in away that
helped her reach out to a larger
community.
"Stanford humanities majors
have the opportunity to develop a
skill set beyond knowledge that
may fade away over time," Salazar
said. "Being able to write a really
good essay translates into being
able to write a really great report
for your supervisors."
"It's important especially for hu
manities majors to think about their
skill set in this way, and a lot of dif
ferent fields and jobs will suddenly
seem open," she added.
The Career Development Cen
ter (CDC) is also working to help
students in the humanities and arts
by offering more career counseling,
according to Margot Gilliland, CDC
assistant director for students in the
humanities and sciences.
The CDC is making efforts to
work closely with individual depart
ments, and Gilliland herself also
holds office hours in the English and
history departments. Additionally,
the CDC is offering Career Mee
tups this year as a casual way for
students to talk about job search
strategies.
Humanities majors often have
strong communication and analyti
cal skills as well as a developed abil
ity to work on teams, according to
Gilliland, and the CDC's new efforts
aim to teach students how to market
those strengths.
Gilliland also noted that in Feb
ruary there will be a humanities and
sciences career fair featuring em
ployers specifically looking for the
skills that come with these types of
majors.
Another new resource for hu

manities majors is the opportunity
to participate in the Summer Insti
tute for General Management
(SIGM) at the Graduate School of
Business. SIGM is a four-week full
time summer program aimed at
providing business knowledge and
improving career-oriented skills for
non-business majors.
With support from the Office of
the President, the program offers
students majoring in the humanities

and arts financial aid based on need
for up to the full tuition cost of
$10,750.
"We hope that a funded opportu
nity like this will be an encourage
ment to students who feel like oth
erwise they might need to major in
something that does have more of a
business focus," McDonough said.
Despite existing and future re
sources available to undergraduate
majors in the humanities and arts,

McDonough expressed concern that
many of these opportunities are not
well known around campus.
"[These opportunities] are
things that potentially could attract
students to the humanities and the
arts if they knew they existed be
fore they declare," McDonough
said.

Despite concerns about the
popularity of the humanities at
Stanford, University adminis
trators say they are not wor
ried about enrollment in the
humanities or the post-gradua
tion career opportunities for
students in these departments,
in part because of the introduc
tion of more resources.
According to Vice Provost
of Undergraduate Education
Harry Elam, the number of
undergraduates majoring in
the humanities over the past 10
years has remained relatively
stable.
Data from the Office of
Graduate and Undergraduate
Studies within the School of
Humanities and Sciences
shows that last academic year,
the University had 253 bache
lor's conferrals for humanities
and arts majors. There were
265 for the 2011-12 academic
year, 254 for 2010-11 and 262
for 2009-10.
Elam stated that two prior

ities the University must con
sider when promoting the hu
manities at Stanford are publi
cizing the top-level quality of
the humanities departments on
campus and dealing with stu
dent and parent concerns
about the economic stability of
a humanities degree.
"I've seen history majors
who have gone to work for
Google because Google wants
people who can synthesize in
formation," Elam said. "Par
ents should understand that
their child is not going to suffer
[with a humanities degree] and
will probably be better off do
ing something they really want
to do rather than a means to an
end."
Existing career resources for
humanities students
In alignment with the prior
ities that Elam outlined, the
University provides support
for humanities students within
the departments as well as at
the administrative level.
