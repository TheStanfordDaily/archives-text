# Beyond Bender
## Top Five Hidden Study Spots 
### ARTS LIFE STAFF 
Alright frosh, listen up. It's your first
Dead Week things are about to
get real and everything you've
heard about where to study is
wrong. Sure, Meyer may be conven
ient and the Bender room may be
pretty, but the perks of these popular spots
aren't worth the crowds (or, in Bender's
case, the squeaky chairs). This week, step
off the beaten path and take your last
minute cramming to these little-known lo
cales:

■ Art and Art History Library: Elands
down the best library on campus to study in,
with huge windows, high ceilings, large ta
bles to spread out your stuff on and a secret
mezzanine level to escape to if you really
need to pound out those papers. Bonus: it's
almost never crowded, and the super-sweet
librarians are always available to help with
online research and printing.

■ Engineering Quad: The engineers
among you may have already figured this one
out, but fuzzies, be adventurous and explore
this mysterious side of campus! Specifically,
give the study rooms in Huang a try glass
walled and well supplied with white boards,
they are a surprisingly calm and picturesque
place to work on that p-set or creative writ
ing essay.

■ Margaret Jacks Hall (Bldg 460) Eng
lish Lounge: Fuzzies know where it's at:
the English Lounge in Building 460, that is.
With comfy chairs, footrests and ample table
space, the English Lounge is the ideal spot
for cuddling up with your textbooks. Plus, if
you get an itch for fresh air, just one floor
above is the serene and scenic English Ter
race overlooking the quad.

■ GSB Courtyard: If it's a sunny day, camp
out at one of the wooden tables in the court
yard of the Business School and surround
yourself with focused soon-to-be CEOs for
motivation. There's a Coupa nearby if you
feel peckish (although these days, where is
n't there a Coupa ...) just make sure to
avoid groups of rowdy seniors downing bot
tomless mimosas on weekend mornings.

■ La Boulange: When it comes to off-cam
pus study spots, Philz might seem like the go
to coffee shop (I mean, everyone and their
brother has checked in on Facebook ...), but
if you want to avoid the parking nightmare
and the crowds, check out this other great
cafe. La Boulange's coffee may not be quite
as delicious, but you can't beat the ambiance.
Grab a table in the sunny octagon room over
looking University Ave. and get to work on
that Thinking Matters paper.
