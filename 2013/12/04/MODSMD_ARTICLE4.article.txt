## Stanford wins three Rhodes Scholarships 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Emma Pierson 'l3 M.S. 'l3,
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3 and

Meredith Wheeler 'l4 were named
2014 Rhodes Scholars.
The Rhodes Scholarship is a
prestigious award that selects 32
American recipients each year. Ac
cording to the Rhodes Trust, candi
dates are evaluated on their high
academic achievement, integrity of
character, spirit of unselfishness,
respect for others, potential for
leadership and physical vigor. Win
ners receive funding for up to four
years of graduate study at the Uni
versity of Oxford in England.
Pierson, who is originally from
Arlington, Va., graduated last year

with a bachelor's degree in physics
and a master's degree in computer
science. While at Stanford, she was
a recipient of Stanford's 2013
Deans' Award for Academic
Achievement, which honors excep
tional undergraduate students.
Pierson was also the president
of the Stanford Debate Society and
took second place in the U.S. na
tional debate championships. She
cited her debating experience as
one of the factors that helped her
prepare to apply for the Rhodes
Scholarship.
"[The Rhodes interview] is very
smart people asking you very ag
gressive questions not mean
questions, but very pointed ques

tions and being able to respond
to those is the kind of thing that de
bate teaches you," Pierson ex
plained.
Pierson intends to earn a doctor
of philosophy (DPhil) in computa
tional biology at Oxford and ulti
mately, to become a professor of
computation biology. She said she
wants to apply statistics to develop
ing screens and treatments for can
cers.
Unterreiner, a native of Gig Har
bor, Wash., left Stanford last spring
with both a bachelor's degree and a
master's degree in history. Pursu
ing a career as an international hu
man rights lawyer and judge, Un
terreiner applied for the Rhodes
for the second time because
earning a master of philosophy
(MPhil) degree in international re
lations from Oxford "provides an
amazing foundation for that long
term goal."
"There's a really cool center at
Oxford called the [lnstitute] for
Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict,"
Unterreiner said. "I'm hoping to
work with some researchers and
professors from that center as I
work to [complete] my dissertation
in the second year."
Last fall, Unterreiner made na
tional news after a University donor
provided a private plane so that he
could run in the NCAA cross coun
try national championships and par
ticipate in his Rhodes Scholarship
interview in the same day, but he
was not awarded the scholarship.
Unterreiner said he didn't have a
strong explanation for why he was
more successful this year, but said
that his family, friends and advisors
encouraged him to apply again.
"It was a really great experience
this year. All the other candidates
were fantastic, I loved the panel
members and the interview was ac
tually really enjoyable," he said. "I
loved last year too, but I don't think
I could tell you why this year was
different."
Unterreiner is a former writer,
columnist and managing editor at
The Daily and won the Robert No
vak Collegiate Journalism Award
for his four-part series on Stan
ford's decision to end student man
agement at Suites Dining.
Unterreiner also ran for Stan
ford's track and field and cross
country teams, where he was a two
time Ail-American. Last spring, he
was recognized for holding the high
est GPA among Stanford's graduat
ing varsity athletes.
Wheeler is a senior majoring in
history and political science. Earli
er this year, Wheeler, who hails
from Fort Collins, Colo., also
earned recognition as a 2013 Tru

man Scholar.
She is the current chair of Stan
ford in Government and has been
active with the American Middle
Eastern Network for Dialogue at
Stanford (AMENDS). Wheeler said
her interest in the Middle East led
her to apply for the Rhodes Scholar
ship because of Oxford's history of
Middle East scholarship and prox
imity to the region. At Oxford,
Wheeler plans to pursue a master's
degree in modern Middle Eastern
studies and potentially a doctorate
in politics.
Wheeler said she was completely
shocked to have won the award and
described the announcement as
"the weirdest moment of her life."
"The other finalists were so in
credible and were doing really
amazing work in all of their fields,"
Wheeler said. "Having spent the
whole day with them and hearing
more about their experiences, their
passion and the work that they had
done, I just didn't think I had any
chance at all."
Wheeler has also been involved
in The Daily, as well as Herodotus,
Stanford's undergraduate history
journal, and the alpine ski team
while at Stanford. Academically,
Wheeler was elected to Phi Beta
Kappa as a junior and has done ex
tensive research in Morocco during
the summers and also served as a
research assistant to Condoleezza

Rice for a summer.
"The whole process of prepar
ing for the application just made
me really grateful for all of the re
sources I have at Stanford the
professors who've really invested a
lot of time in mentoring me and al
so just my friends and all the con
versations that we've had about our
interests and our plans and our
goals," Wheeler said.
According to the Rhodes Trust,
approximately 1,750 students
sought endorsement from their col
lege or university and 857 were ul
timately endorsed. Last weekend,
208 applicants went through the fi
nal interview process before the 32
winners were selected. With six
scholars chosen, Harvard had the
most affiliated recipients, while
both Yale and Stanford had three
winners selected. Including the
2014 class, 112 Stanford affiliates
have been named Rhodes Scholars
during the history of the award.
"It's very gratifying to win be
cause it's important to me to be
helping the world, and it's a sign
that maybe I was heading in the
right direction towards doing that,"
Pierson said. "I would encourage
other people to do it. I think it's very
good in terms of self-discovery and
determining what matters to you."

journal, and the alpine ski team
while at Stanford. Academically,
Wheeler was elected to Phi Beta
Kappa as a junior and has done ex
tensive research in Morocco during
the summers and also served as a
research assistant to Condoleezza

Rice for a summer.
"The whole process of prepar
ing for the application just made
me really grateful for all of the re
sources I have at Stanford the
professors who've really invested a
lot of time in mentoring me and al
so just my friends and all the con
versations that we've had about our
interests and our plans and our
goals," Wheeler said.
According to the Rhodes Trust,
approximately 1,750 students
sought endorsement from their col
lege or university and 857 were ul
timately endorsed. Last weekend,
208 applicants went through the fi
nal interview process before the 32
winners were selected. With six
scholars chosen, Harvard had the
most affiliated recipients, while
both Yale and Stanford had three
winners selected. Including the
2014 class, 112 Stanford affiliates
have been named Rhodes Scholars
during the history of the award.
"It's very gratifying to win be
cause it's important to me to be
helping the world, and it's a sign
that maybe I was heading in the
right direction towards doing that,"
Pierson said. "I would encourage
other people to do it. I think it's very
good in terms of self-discovery and
determining what matters to you."

Emma Pierson 'l3 M.S. 'l3,
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3 and

Meredith Wheeler 'l4 were named
2014 Rhodes Scholars.
The Rhodes Scholarship is a
prestigious award that selects 32
American recipients each year. Ac
cording to the Rhodes Trust, candi
dates are evaluated on their high
academic achievement, integrity of
character, spirit of unselfishness,
respect for others, potential for
leadership and physical vigor. Win
ners receive funding for up to four
years of graduate study at the Uni
versity of Oxford in England.
Pierson, who is originally from
Arlington, Va., graduated last year

with a bachelor's degree in physics
and a master's degree in computer
science. While at Stanford, she was
a recipient of Stanford's 2013
Deans' Award for Academic
Achievement, which honors excep
tional undergraduate students.
Pierson was also the president
of the Stanford Debate Society and
took second place in the U.S. na
tional debate championships. She
cited her debating experience as
one of the factors that helped her
prepare to apply for the Rhodes
Scholarship.
"[The Rhodes interview] is very
smart people asking you very ag
gressive questions not mean
questions, but very pointed ques

tions and being able to respond
to those is the kind of thing that de
bate teaches you," Pierson ex
plained.
Pierson intends to earn a doctor
of philosophy (DPhil) in computa
tional biology at Oxford and ulti
mately, to become a professor of
computation biology. She said she
wants to apply statistics to develop
ing screens and treatments for can
cers.
Unterreiner, a native of Gig Har
bor, Wash., left Stanford last spring
with both a bachelor's degree and a
master's degree in history. Pursu
ing a career as an international hu
man rights lawyer and judge, Un
terreiner applied for the Rhodes
for the second time because
earning a master of philosophy
(MPhil) degree in international re
lations from Oxford "provides an
amazing foundation for that long
term goal."
"There's a really cool center at
Oxford called the [lnstitute] for
Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict,"
Unterreiner said. "I'm hoping to
work with some researchers and
professors from that center as I
work to [complete] my dissertation
in the second year."
Last fall, Unterreiner made na
tional news after a University donor
provided a private plane so that he
could run in the NCAA cross coun
try national championships and par
ticipate in his Rhodes Scholarship
interview in the same day, but he
was not awarded the scholarship.
Unterreiner said he didn't have a
strong explanation for why he was
more successful this year, but said
that his family, friends and advisors
encouraged him to apply again.
"It was a really great experience
this year. All the other candidates
were fantastic, I loved the panel
members and the interview was ac
tually really enjoyable," he said. "I
loved last year too, but I don't think
I could tell you why this year was
different."
Unterreiner is a former writer,
columnist and managing editor at
The Daily and won the Robert No
vak Collegiate Journalism Award
for his four-part series on Stan
ford's decision to end student man
agement at Suites Dining.
Unterreiner also ran for Stan
ford's track and field and cross
country teams, where he was a two
time Ail-American. Last spring, he
was recognized for holding the high
est GPA among Stanford's graduat
ing varsity athletes.
Wheeler is a senior majoring in
history and political science. Earli
er this year, Wheeler, who hails
from Fort Collins, Colo., also
earned recognition as a 2013 Tru

man Scholar.
She is the current chair of Stan
ford in Government and has been
active with the American Middle
Eastern Network for Dialogue at
Stanford (AMENDS). Wheeler said
her interest in the Middle East led
her to apply for the Rhodes Scholar
ship because of Oxford's history of
Middle East scholarship and prox
imity to the region. At Oxford,
Wheeler plans to pursue a master's
degree in modern Middle Eastern
studies and potentially a doctorate
in politics.
Wheeler said she was completely
shocked to have won the award and
described the announcement as
"the weirdest moment of her life."
"The other finalists were so in
credible and were doing really
amazing work in all of their fields,"
Wheeler said. "Having spent the
whole day with them and hearing
more about their experiences, their
passion and the work that they had
done, I just didn't think I had any
chance at all."
Wheeler has also been involved
in The Daily, as well as Herodotus,
Stanford's undergraduate history
journal, and the alpine ski team
while at Stanford. Academically,
Wheeler was elected to Phi Beta
Kappa as a junior and has done ex
tensive research in Morocco during
