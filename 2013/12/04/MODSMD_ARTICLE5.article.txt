### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Robert Simoni, chair of the
Biology Department, recently
announced that he would retire
at the end of the 2013-14 school
year after 42 years at Stanford.
Simoni has also taught Biology
41: Genetic, Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology for 41 years.

At the end of his last Biology 41
lecture on Nov. 22, faculty and
students arranged a surprise cel

including President John
Hennessy. The Daily spoke
with Simoni about his up
coming retirement and his
reaction to the celebration.
The Stanford Daily
(TSD): Why did you decide
that this was going to be your
last year teaching?
Robert Simoni (RS): I'm
74, and, when I first started,
it was traditional that people
retired at the age of 65 in
fact, it was mandatory. Then
that changed and then, gosh,
I never really thought I'd
work this long, but I have in
large part because I enjoy
teaching so much. But there
just comes a time to move on
and time for younger people
to take over. I have lots of
other things I'd like to be do
ing, so it just seems like the
right time.
TSD: What are some of
your most memorable career
experiences?
RS: Getting a job at Stan
ford was far and away the
most memorable. And [Biolo
gy 41] I mentioned to the
class at the end of the cele
bration that teaching that
class has sustained me the
entire [4l] years I've been at

Stanford, and it's really true.
I've enjoyed teaching it, and
it's one thing that's been a
constant in my entire time at
Stanford, and it's been quite
memorable. It's a large class,
and, over the [4l] years, it's
probably averaged over 350
students a year, and to be
able to have a hopefully posi
tive influence on that many
students is really quite won
derful. It's the joy of teach
ing.
TSD: What is it about Bi
ology 41 that's made it so in
teresting to teach for [4l]
years?
RS: I'm a biochemist and
it's a biochemistry and molec
ular biology class, so the sub
ject area is something that
has been part of my career in
every respect all of my re
search and most of my teach
ing. I just think it's a wonder
ful kind of science.
TSD: We saw the video of
your retirement celebration
did you know that was
coming at all?
RS: Oh gosh no, it was a
total surprise. And in part
because the first thing was
that the Band came in and,
you know, it was the Friday
before Big Game and often
times the Band has come in
to my class it's a large

class so it's sort of a Big
Game promotion so that
part wasn't so much a sur

prise. But then I saw all my
faculty colleagues and peo
ple I know well come in
wearing white wigs, which
was sort of a tip off that this
was going to be something
else.
TSD: So what was your
reaction when you realized
that the celebration was
thrown to commemorate
your career?
RS: To me, it was quite
moving. I got a little
verklempt and didn't know
quite what to say. It was quite
a touching experience for me,
it really was.
TSD: What are your fu
ture plans for the rest of this
year and then after this year?
RS: I'm chairman of the
Biology Department and so
I'll complete that job this
year and then subsequently
someone else will take over.
And then I'm going to take
sabbatical and then I'm going
to retire.
TSD: What are you most
looking forward to in your re
tirement?
RS: Spending more time
with my grandchildren. Trav
elling a bit. I have a couple of
small writing projects I'd like
to do. And not having to keep
a schedule.
