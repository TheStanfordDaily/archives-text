## Shorter Ph.D. track proposed 
### SARAH SALAMEH 
Since last year, the School of Humani
ties and Sciences has been working to de
crease the time to degree for students in
humanities Ph.D. programs to about five
years by allowing departments to submit
proposals for restructuring and rein
forcement of benchmarks and monitor
ing procedures within various programs.
However, most humanities depart
ments have yet to submit proposals, ac
cording to Richard Sailer, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.

"I would have suspected a lot bigger
uptake on it," Sailer said. "Among some
faculty in the humanities and I don't
know how many there is a sense that
we should not be aiming for a five-year
Ph.D. program, that it takes longer than
that and that they don't want to compress
Ph.D. training."
According to Sailer, time to degree for
students completing Ph.D. programs in
the humanities is typically longer than
the time for students completing a doc
torate in the social sciences and natural
sciences.
Debra Satz, associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences, said
that students with longer than average
time to degree have historically not per
formed as well in the job market.
Longer than average time to degree is
not only related to lower performance in
the job market, but can deter interested
students who do not want to go into aca
demia from applying to complete a doc
toral program, explained Russell
Berman, a professor of comparative liter
ature and director of the Department of
German Studies.
"Not only is time to degree for getting
a Ph.D. in the humanities longer than
getting a Ph.D. for the social sciences and
natural sciences, but it's also longer than
getting a professional school degree,"
Berman said. "So a smart undergraduate
approaching senior year... is going to ask
whether he or she wants to spend seven
years getting a Ph.D. in the humanities
versus spending three years in law
school."
In addition, Sailer said that a little
over half of the doctoral students in the
