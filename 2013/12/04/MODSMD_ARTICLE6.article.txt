## Shorter Ph.D. track proposed 
### SARAH SALAMEH 
Since last year, the School of Humani
ties and Sciences has been working to de
crease the time to degree for students in
humanities Ph.D. programs to about five
years by allowing departments to submit
proposals for restructuring and rein
forcement of benchmarks and monitor
ing procedures within various programs.
However, most humanities depart
ments have yet to submit proposals, ac
cording to Richard Sailer, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.

"I would have suspected a lot bigger
uptake on it," Sailer said. "Among some
faculty in the humanities and I don't
know how many there is a sense that
we should not be aiming for a five-year
Ph.D. program, that it takes longer than
that and that they don't want to compress
Ph.D. training."
According to Sailer, time to degree for
students completing Ph.D. programs in
the humanities is typically longer than
the time for students completing a doc
torate in the social sciences and natural
sciences.
Debra Satz, associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences, said
that students with longer than average
time to degree have historically not per
formed as well in the job market.
Longer than average time to degree is
not only related to lower performance in
the job market, but can deter interested
students who do not want to go into aca
demia from applying to complete a doc
toral program, explained Russell
Berman, a professor of comparative liter
ature and director of the Department of
German Studies.
"Not only is time to degree for getting
a Ph.D. in the humanities longer than
getting a Ph.D. for the social sciences and
natural sciences, but it's also longer than
getting a professional school degree,"
Berman said. "So a smart undergraduate
approaching senior year... is going to ask
whether he or she wants to spend seven
years getting a Ph.D. in the humanities
versus spending three years in law
school."
In addition, Sailer said that a little
over half of the doctoral students in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
who graduated in 2001 have
tenure-track positions at universi
ties. However, he said that ensur
ing that students graduate within
five to six years is important for the
other half of students not entering
academia.
"Five years is a pretty significant
period of time, especially in a con
text where many of the Ph.D.s
don't end up with academic jobs,"
Sailer said. "That's also a factor in
thinking through, 'ls it fair to stu
dents to let them spend eight years
or nine years working on a disserta
tion that doesn't even issue in an ac
ademic job?"'
Satz attributed the long time to
degree that exists now partially to
Stanford humanities doctoral pro
grams requiring fluency in a for
eign language, which can add a sig
nificant amount of time to obtain a
degree.
"Not every program requires
students to be fluent in a foreign lan
guage, but some programs clearly
do," Satz said. "And for some of the
students, they obviously have some
background, but maybe not suffi
cient."
According to Gabriella Safran,
the chair of the Division of Litera
tures, Cultures, and Languages
(DLCL), all five departments in the
D L C L comparative literature,
German studies, French and Italian,
Slavic languages and literature and
Iberian and Latin American cultures
submitted proposals to move up
program milestones such as testing
students earlier to measure how
much language training they need
before entering the program.
Safran said the proposals are
part of an ongoing effort to reduce
time to degree for departments in
the DLCL.
Sailer also attributed the longer
than average time to degree to the
fact that many doctoral students in
the humanities take longer periods
of time to decide on a dissertation
topic or their focus for their studies.
"In general, time to degree in the
sciences is shorter and that's be
cause students generally work in a
laboratory structure where they're
a part of a bigger project," Sailer
said.
Berman said that time to degree
in the sciences tends to be shorter
than that for the humanities because
of higher pressure for efficiency.
"In the natural sciences and so
cial sciences where there's so much
more dependency on outside
sources of grants, there's this bot
tom-line pressure to work efficient
ly," said Berman.
According to Satz, the depart
ment proposals should aim to help

students decide on their Ph.D. focus
through events such as dissertation
seminars and by helping faculty be
more proactive in meeting regularly
with their students and monitoring
their work.
Satz said the proposals submit
ted would be part of an ongoing
process of reevaluating doctoral
programs in humanities and time to
degree. She added that other de
partments continue to work on their
own proposals.
Some Ph.D. students strongly
believe that there are tangible bene
fits of shortening Ph.D. tracks.
"I feel like shorter would be bet
ter," said [redacted].
'l6, who studies U.S. foreign policy,
gender and international develop
ment. "As it is now, the dissertation
seems too large, especially in hu
manities programs. Being in grad
school for six to eight years, in my
opinion, is bad for morale... I think
everyone would be better off if the
process was shorter and the culture
of academia shifted in order to ac
commodate that change."
Nicholas Lund M.A. 'l2 Ph.D.
'l3, whose primary work focused on
Russian history, believes that short
ening Ph.D. tracks would encourage
departments to prioritize the re
quired coursework.
"There's no reason to think that
a shorter Ph.D. track would hurt
anyone's career," Lund said. "Right
now, coursework is a total mess be
cause students are required to take
lots of courses, which also means
that faculty members are required
to teach a lot of courses. This in
evitably leads to professors offer
ing esoteric courses on whatever
they happen to be researching at
the moment and students have no
choice but to sit through a random
assortment of classes for over two
years."
While history doctoral student
Erin Pettigrew Ph.D. 'l4 under
stands the rationale behind the ef
forts to shorten time to degree, she
added that the utility of such
changes depends on the field and
discipline.
"While it's true that Ph.D. stu
dents burn out from the length of
programs and the small stipends, I
wouldn't want shortening the
length of the program to come at
the expense of good quality train
ing or to add to students' anxieties
about finishing the degree," Petti
grew said. "In my field, we still
need to undertake language train
ing, long-term fieldwork, and good
wilting, all of which take time. So it
depends on what exactly would be

shortened, removed, pushed or
changed."
