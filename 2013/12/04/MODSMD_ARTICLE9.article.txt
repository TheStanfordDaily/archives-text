## SUPER TUESDAY Syria in Need of an Intervention 
### Marshall Watkins 
Ever since reaching an agree
ment to dispose of Syria's
chemical weapons, the inter
national community has largely
turned its back on a civil war that
has yet to show any sign of ameliora
tion.
Hundreds of thousands have
been killed or displaced by a regime
whose brutality is perhaps only
matched by the world's indifference
and, frankly, impotence. In Syria and
elsewhere, the United States has
turned its back on a recent legacy of
successful and limited interventions
even while it could, and should, do
so much more.
Since the end of the Vietnam
War, American foreign policy has
been defined by stints of overconfi
dent overreach followed by periods
of naive and counterproductive isola
tionism. Following a disastrous if
reasonably founded intervention
in Somalia in the early 19905, the
Clinton administration subsequently
shied away from stopping genocide
in Rwanda or acting decisively to
head off the burgeoning threat of Is
lamist terrorism. Stricken by the hu
man and financial costs of Iraq and
Afghanistan, the Obama administra
tion looks set to head down the same
road.
The human cost, meanwhile, of
the ongoing conflict in Syria has
been simply catastrophic. More than
100,000 Syrians have been killed
according to a rather conservative
estimate while a further two mil
lion have fled from Syria to neigh
boring countries. Even after the for
mulation of an agreement to destroy
the Assad regime's chemical
weapons, the situation on the ground
will likely only continue to deterio
rate.
Mounting an effective interven
tion in Syria would be complicated at
the best of times, given the country's
pronounced sectarian divide. Inter
vening at this point in the conflict,
when the Obama administration's
failure to support moderate opposi
tion to Assad has driven the emer
gence of a radically more fundamen
talist and anti-American set of
rebels, is even more complex, given
the risk of inadvertently arming
those who would in an echo of the
mujahedeen's struggle in
Afghanistan against the Soviet
Union later seek to do the United
States harm with American-sup
plied weapons.

Even so, the smallest steps
such as the creation of a no-fly zone,
the selective provision of technical
assistance to moderate rebel forces
and the use of diplomatic and eco
nomic pressure to distance Assad
from external backers like Russia
may have a significant effect. As
shown by interventions from Kosovo
to Libya, Western nations can exert
remarkable pressure towards
restoring order while assuming little
to no risk. Syria should be no differ
ent.
Moreover, the broader implica
tions of failing to advance even in
a limited way basic principles
through some form of intervention
or assistance to the rebels is strik
ing. The international community
has become all too accustomed to
"norms," boundaries within which
nation-states can acceptably conduct
their business, and to an unprece
dented period of peace and prosper
ity (at least on a global scale).
That stability is directly contin
gent on leading powers and, to
the exclusion of China, leading pow
ers that both espouse and adhere to
basic standards regarding human
rights and liberal principles
standing up for those norms and rec
tifying breaches when they take
place. Failing to do so in Syria, given
the steadily rising human cost, is at
best morally negligent and at worse
directly detrimental to the estab
lished international order â€”if the
United States is unwilling to assume
that burden, no other acceptable al
ternative is in sight.
Of course, an interventionist for
eign policy runs the risk of "mission
creep," as Iraq and Afghanistan
demonstrate all too well. The United
States doesn't "nation-build" all that
well unilaterally but does when
approaching the issue with the assis
tance of international partners and
organizations like the UN and the
cost of those two recent interven
tions is all too well-documented.
Even so, doing nothing in Syria
to write off a brutalized people,
and to relinquish any sort of moral
authority the United States may
retain on such issues is simply
not an option. Quite simply, the in
ternational community and the
United States in particular
needs to step up.
