Longevity in the 21st Century
Crisis or Opportunity?
Psychology 102
Winter 2014
In the 20th century, more years were added to life
expectancy than was the case for all increases across all
prior millennia combined. The scale of the change we are
experiencing is so dramatic that it requires deep, open, and
sustained conversations about what kind of aging societies
we want to create.
In this course students will learn about the implications of
longer lives for themselves and for societies. By adopting
a multi-disciplinary approach, Rando -- a neurologist and
biogerontologist -- and Carstensen -- a psychologist and
life-span developmentalist -- will help students understand
new challenges to health care, financial markets, families,
work, and politics.
