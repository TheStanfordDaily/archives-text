## Life and Death in the Digital Cloud 
### Chi Ling Chan 
I have always thought that a day
will come when human beings
can live forever. It's just a mat
ter of time before we figure out how
to do it. The more interesting ques
tion is what form our defiance of
death will take.
Will we take anti-aging pills to
magically stop our bodies from ag
ing? Will we plug our preserved
brains into new bodies made of
sterner stuff? Or will we down
load all our memories into a
supercomputer that replicates
human consciousness before
our bodies diet
After watching Charlie Brook
er's "Be Right Back" in the British
TV series "Black Mirror," I'm be
ginning to believe in another possi
bility: Instead of resurrection or
preservation, technology could
recreate with the manifold digital
footprints you leave in your virtual
life.
Compiling a database of photo

graphs, tweets, voice recordings,
emails, chat logs and status up
dates, an artificial intelligence pro
gram could pick up a dead man's
online mannerisms, tastes, prefer
ences and memories from his digi
tal interactions to reverse-engineer
his personality.
This was the unsettling prospect
offered to the protagonist Martha,
who had suffered the devastating
loss of her fiance: a service that lets
you talk to the dead. The computer
gathers enough of her fiance's digi
tal footprints to let her talk on the
phone with him. She enhances this
virtual reincarnation by reminding
him of certain memories he's meant
to have, which he retains.
The virtual life that once
seemed nothing more than a thin
simulacrum acquires a life of its
own through artificial intelligence,
which calculates a life "essence"
from the bits of personality sprin
kled into the digital infrastructure.

"You," or something that behaves
and speaks very much like you,
lives on in the machine.
This may sound like sci-fi taking
reality to a logical extreme, but
here's something that might creep
you out: It's already happening.
LivesOn, a social media service
in beta testing, uses artificial intel
ligence to mimic an individual's
Twitter activity, keeping an online
persona alive after the physical self
has kicked the bucket. "When your
heart stops beating," goes the com
pany's tagline, "you'll keep tweet
ing."
Other apps, like IflDielst, offer
people a "once in a lifetime chance"
at posthumous fame by broadcast
ing Al-generated messages on var
ious social networking platforms.
"Immortality is right around the
corner," intones the ghoulish adver
tisement, "along with death."
We already speak of living mul
tiple lives one offline in the "real
world" and as many virtual online
lives as we care to manage. Some,
particularly those of us who cannot
live a waking day without smart
phones and social media, already
live in a culture of "real virtuality."
This occurs when digitalized net
works of communication are so in
clusive of cultural expressions and
personal experiences that virtuality
becomes a fundamental dimension
of reality.
Our smartphones and iPads
keep us perpetually connected, and
increasingly our physical self is de
fined as much by our online profiles
and postings as by our "real-life"
interactions. Each tweet and "like"
we share goes into weaving an elab
orate digital garb that can repre
sent us forever in the cloud. Your
digital footprints are not easily
erased; the Internet has the never
forgets memory of an elephant.
Rarely do we know how we look
in our amorphous digital garb, or
what it says about us. Data taken in
aggregate can reveal information
about us that we did not intend to
share. Combining information from
multiple sources, companies have
long been able to develop dossiers
from discrete consumer behavior
data.
Target, for instance, is notorious
for its ability to predict consumer
patterns through analyzing shop
ping habits; the company even went
so far as to discern a teen girl's

pregnancy before her parents so
they could begin marketing mater
nity items to the mother-to-be.
Our ability to extrapolate habits
from consumption data is constant
ly improving, and considering that
habits rather than conscious de
cision-makingâ€” shape 45 percent
of the choices we make, the possi
bility of immortal virtual identities
is not so far off.
Most people living in "real virtu
ality" are probably still too young
to think about digital death while
they are busy leading their digital
lives. But the specter of death will
not go away until scientists discov
er the secret to immortality for the
offline self.
While we wait for that biological
solution, it's worth contemplating
what happens to our digital identi
ties when we die: Do we want to
have them erased, or do we want to
preserve them indefinitely in the
ether(net)? Do we want to keep our
digital selves alive for our loved
ones? Will we create digital wills to
address this, or will we let the cor
porate giants see to this for us?
These are new problems for a
digital generation that's living
more online by the day. It is already
a truism that the Internet has
changed the world completely, and
us along with it. And now it even
appears that the perennial question
of death is further complicated by
the prospect of digital immortality
enabled by apps. Congratulations,
or should we say commiserations?
