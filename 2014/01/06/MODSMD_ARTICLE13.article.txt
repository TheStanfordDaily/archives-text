## STANFORD IN THE NFL LUCK'S EPIC COMEBACK Colts fight back in the fourth to stun Chiefs in playoffs 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
With Andrew Luck 'l2 at quar
terback, no deficit is too large.
Despite trailing the Kansas
City Chiefs 38-10 early in the third
quarter this Saturday, Luck and
the Colts maintained a calm confi
dence and rallied to defeat the
Chiefs 45-44 in the second-largest
playoff comeback of all time.
The comeback is even more un
fathomable considering the fact
that Luck threw three intercep
tions, including two in the second
half, with the Colts committing a
total of four turnovers on the day.
While Luck may have not played
the best game of his career, he
made the plays he needed to in or
der to guide the Colts to victory.
"He's as advertised," said
Chiefs cornerback Sean Smith
about Luck. "He went out there
and definitely avoided some pres
sure and made big plays down the
field."
The defining moment of the
comeback came with just under 11
minutes remaining and the Colts
trailing 41-31. Lined up in the shot
gun at the Chiefs 1-yard line, Luck
handed the ball off to running back
Donald Brown who was hit by

Chiefs all-pro safety Eric Berry
and subsequently fumbled the ball.
The ball popped out of Brown's
arms and fell right in front of Luck,
who scooped up the fumble, dove
though a pile of lineman and ex
tended his arm into the end zone
for a touchdown.
On the Colts' next possession,
Luck hit Indianapolis receiver T.Y.

Hilton on a 64-yard touchdown
pass to complete the comeback and
put the Colts ahead for good. The
victory was Luck's first career
playoff win and his 11th game-win
ning drive in the fourth quarter or
overtime.
Luck finished the game 29-for
-45 with 443 passing yards and four
touchdowns. He also ran for 45

yards on seven carries. After again
leading the Colts to an 11-5 regular
season, Luck leveled his career
record in the playoffs at 1-1 after
Indianapolis fell in his first playoff
contest last year against the
Ravens.
Colts tight end Coby Fleener
'll recorded five receptions for 46
yards and caught a 12-yard touch
down pass in the third quarter to
bring the Colts within 10 at 41-31.
Luck's other former Cardinal tar
get, Griff Whalen 'l2, caught two
passes for 26 yards.

San Diego linebacker Thomas
Keiser 'll was arrested last Sunday
night on suspicion of misdemeanor
battery. Keiser was involved in a
bar fight in San Diego and did not
play in the Chargers 27-10 victo
ry over the Bengals this Sunday.
Before the incident, Keiser was in
the midst of a breakout season
with the Chargers finishing with
career-highs in tackles (21) and
sacks (4.5).
In another playoff contest, Ea
gles tight end Zach Ertz 'l3 caught
what could have been a game-win
ning 3-yard touchdown pass
against the Saints to put the Eagles
up 24-23 with just under five min
utes remaining. The Eagles were
thwarted shortly after, however,
when Saints kicker Shayne Graham
kicked a 32-yard field goal to give
the Saints the 26-24 win.
