# OGWUMIKE SETS RECORD IN OPENER
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 4 Stanford women's basketball
opened Pac-12 play this weekend with deci
sive victories over Oregon and Oregon State.
Senior forward Chiney Ogwumike, who
hit over 30 points in both contests, led the
Card against a Ducks' offense on Friday that
was averaging 105 points per game the
highest-scoring team in the nation beat
ing them 96-66 and holding them to just 33.8-
percent shooting from the field and only six
of-26 from behind the arc. Then on Sunday,
the Card shot out of the gate to beat the
Beavers 89-67.

On Friday, Ogwumike had a lot of help
from the rest of the team with 11 other Car
dinal players scoring against Oregon. Junior
guard Bonnie Samuelson scored a career
high 21 points and tied another career high
with six 3-pointers in a game, leading the
team's season best of 12 3-pointers. Despite
a good spread of scoring, Ogwumike who
finished with 33 points and 14 rebounds
and Samuelson were the only players to
score in double digits.
"[Head coach Tara VanDerveer] has been
preaching that to us all year, that we need to
be ready and go out there and do our jobs,"
Samuelson told GoStanford. "It was good
that I shot well tonight, because that hope
fully helped release some pressure on
Chiney and get her going. We know we have
the best player in the nation on our team,
and we want to enjoy this year as much as we
can with her."
With her 14 rebounds, Ogwumike had
her ninth double-double of the season, and,
even more notably, she set the new Pac-12
all-time rebounding record with 1,271 career
rebounds. She eclipsed fellow Stanford
standouts Jayne Appel 'lO, Kayla Pederson
'll and older sister Nneka Ogwumike 'l2.
"Honestly, there are a few times when

Senior Chiney Ogwumike (middle) led the Cardinal to victory in its opening weekend of Pac-12
play. In Friday's game, Ogwumike became the Pac-12 career rebounding leader with 1,271.
I'm speechless," Ogwumike told
GoStanford. "I just have great
teammates. I love playing for my
team, so every night I just go out
there and play to the best of my abil
ity. [Records] are great headlines ...
I just try to be consistent for Coach
Tara and our program.
"It's exciting to hear about these

things, but I always have the bigger
picture in mind. I just love playing
with our team."
The Ducks, however, put up a
good fight in the first half and only
trailed by five with seven minutes
until halftime. Sophomore Jillian Al
leyne scored the most points by any
player against the Cardinal this sea
son with 26 points to go along with
13 rebounds.
Samuelson hit three triples dur
ing the final three minutes of the
first half to spur a 26-14 Stanford
run and end the half with the Cardi

nal ahead 51-34.
Ogwumike opened up the second
half on fire, scoring 15 of the Cardi
nal's first 20 points. Samuelson then
chipped in again with consecutive 3-
point plays that put the Card ahead
81-49 with three minutes to play.
"All in all, this was a really good
first game for us to come out with in
the Pac-12 regular season," Van-
Derveer told GoStanford.
The Cardinal continued to domi
nate in Sunday afternoon's match
against Oregon State, using a 29-4
game-opening run to defeat the

Beavers 89-67. This time, Ogwu
mike received key support in scor
ing from a different player. Ogwu
mike had 31 points and 13 rebounds
posting her sixth 30-point game
and 10th double-double of the sea
son and also passed out a season
high six assists.
Freshman Lili Thompson had a
career-high 19 points to go with five
assists, two steals and five re
bounds. Together, Thompson and
Ogwumike combined for 36 of Stan
ford's 50 points in the first half. Sen
ior Mikaela Ruef and junior Taylor

Greenfield also contributed with
double digits, scoring 10 and 13
points, respectively.
Oregon State shot just 38.3 per
cent Sunday, making this the 13th
out of 14 games this season that
Stanford has held its opponents to
under 40-percent shooting.
The Cardinal embarks on its
first Pac-12 road trip of the season
with Utah on Friday and Colorado
on Sunday.
