## Lack of depth dooms Card in loss to Cal 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Any optimism brought about
by the Stanford men's basketball
team's recent East Coast road
trip will have to temporarily be
put on hold, as the Cardinal (9-4,
0-1 Pac-12) dropped its Pac-12
opener to Cal (10-4, 1-0) 69-62 at
home on Thursday night.
Although the game was close
throughout, it was Cal that better
executed its game plan and made

the big shots down the stretch.
The Golden Bears held the Cardi
nal to just 36.4-percent shooting
in the second half and 28.6-per
cent overall from 3-point range.

Stanford is a team that prides
itself on its defense, and, despite
holding its archrival to 42.1-per

cent shooting for the game, the
Cardinal could not find the an
swers on the offensive end to
come away with the victory. Stan
ford tallied a season-low seven as
sists and made just 10 of 20 free
throws, which compounded the
team's problems shooting from
the field.
"We didn't finish as well as we
usually do," head coach Johnny
Dawkins told GoStanford.com.
"We didn't shoot from the line
how we usually do, and that is

very disappointing. It is some
thing that our guys work on, and
they know the importance of it."
The Cardinal was able to stay
close in the second half thanks to
a tremendous effort by senior for
ward Dwight Powell, who scored
15 of the team's 19 points over a
10-minute stretch in the second
half before fouling out.
Despite the problems the team
was having offensively, Stanford

CAL 69
STANFORD 62
1/2, Maples Pavilion
was able to put together a
13-3 run to take a 56-54 lead
with 5:17 remaining, capped
by a Powell free throw.
From there on out, how
ever, Cal's senior guard and
leading scorer Justin Cobbs
took over, rallying the
Bears by scoring nine of his
18 points, in addition to an
assist on a dunk, in the final
3:31 of the game.
Two costly turnovers by
Stanford junior Chasson
Randle allowed the Bears to
take a four-point lead with
2:36 remaining, and a terrif
ic offensive sequence by
Cobbs on consecutive pos
sessions gave the Bears a
64-58 lead with 1:06 left to
play.
Free throws by Randle, a
missed free throw by Cal
sophomore Tyrone Wallace
and a jumper by Randle
once more cut the Cal lead
to one possession, 65-62,
with 0:53 left, but the Cardi
nal was never able to get
any closer. Cobbs iced the
game by scoring the final
four points for the Golden
Bears, who secured their
first victory at Maples
Pavilion since March 6,
2010.
Dwight Powell led the
Cardinal with 16 points,
while Randle added 15 and
senior Anthony Brown con
tributed 14.
Wallace paced the Bears
with 20, while Cobbs fin
ished with 18 and senior
Richard Solomon con
tributed 14 points and 13 re
bounds.
Stanford's lack of depth,
which has become an issue

due to the season-ending in
juries sustained by senior
guard Aaron Bright, sopho
more guard Christian
Sanders and fifth-year sen
ior forward Andy Brown,
was a glaring weakness for
the Cardinal throughout,
but especially down the
stretch. The bench failed to
score a single point for Stan
ford for the second time in
four games, and it was clear
that Dawkins had few reli
able options to turn to when
seniors Stefan Nastic and
Powell fouled out in the final
four minutes of the game.
"Stefan fouling out was
big. He anchors our post
and not having him in there
hurt us," Dawkins told
GoStanford.com. "It was a
tough play. He was being
aggressive. We want him
going in there to the offen
sive boards, and it was un
fortunate that he went over
a young man's back. He was
giving us a presence down
there. A lot of our offense
flows with what we do with
him."
As the Pac-12 season
progresses, it is clear that
someone will have to step
up to help shoulder some of
the starters' load. Against
Cal, Stanford's starting
lineup of Randle, Brown,
Huestis, Powell and Nastic
played a combined 179 out
of a possible 200 minutes,
and it would have been
more had Powell and Nastic
not fouled out.
The Cardinal will search
for some answers offensive
ly and look to find a solution
for its depth problem when
it takes on Oregon State
and Oregon on the road
next week.

Despite strong play by senior forward Dwight Powell (above), who led the Card to a promising 13-3 run in the final
minutes, Stanford was challenged by its lack of bench depth when both Powell and senior Stefan Nastic fouled out late.
