## Lack of depth dooms Card in loss to Cal 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Any optimism brought about
by the Stanford men's basketball
team's recent East Coast road
trip will have to temporarily be
put on hold, as the Cardinal (9-4,
0-1 Pac-12) dropped its Pac-12
opener to Cal (10-4, 1-0) 69-62 at
home on Thursday night.
Although the game was close
throughout, it was Cal that better

the big shots down the stretch.
The Golden Bears held the Cardi
nal to just 36.4-percent shooting
in the second half and 28.6-per
cent overall from 3-point range.

Stanford is a team that prides
itself on its defense, and, despite
holding its archrival to 42.1-per

cent shooting for the game, the
Cardinal could not find the an
swers on the offensive end to
come away with the victory. Stan
ford tallied a season-low seven as
sists and made just 10 of 20 free
throws, which compounded the
team's problems shooting from
the field.
"We didn't finish as well as we
usually do," head coach Johnny
Dawkins told GoStanford.com.
"We didn't shoot from the line
how we usually do, and that is

very disappointing. It is some
thing that our guys work on, and
they know the importance of it."
The Cardinal was able to stay
close in the second half thanks to
a tremendous effort by senior for
ward Dwight Powell, who scored
15 of the team's 19 points over a
10-minute stretch in the second
half before fouling out.
Despite the problems the team
was having offensively, Stanford
