# Making sense of a true defeat
## 
### Sam Fisher 
For the first time since Nov.
12, 2011, Stanford football
was beaten by a better
team. On Jan. 1, 2014, the
Spartans, playing without
their two-time captain and defensive
leader Max Bullough, were better
than the Cardinal and more physi
cal too.
The 100 th Rose Bowl Game was
remarkably different than Stanford's
previous five losses. In all five of those
games, Stanford clearly looked like
the better team and had golden op
portunities to win. Against Michigan
State, even if the Cardinal had some
how scored on its last drive, it would
have felt like Stanford stole the game
away.
This was a remarkable shift; quite
honestly, I'm still having trouble pro
cessing just how physically Michigan
State played. In my four seasons of
watching Stanford football up close,
I've never seen a game play out quite
like that.
But even though the Spartans'
shocking physical domination up iront
made a Stanford victory unlikely, the
Cardinal still had its chances to win.
All it had to do was attack Michigan
State's weaknesses instead of its
strengths and execute, of course.
Heading into the game, Michigan
State had two apparent weaknesses:
quarterback Connor Cook's decisions
under pressure and safety Isaiah
Lewis' coverage skills. Stanford's abil
ity to expose these weaknesses, I
thought, would decide the Rose Bowl.
That's why early on at least, there
was plenty of reason for Cardinal fans
to be extremely confident in victory.
Stanford had success early down the
middle of the field, as sophomore wide
receiver Michael Rector was consis
tently open, and pressure on Cook
forced two terrible decisions in the
first half alone.
Inexplicably, however, Stanford
took very few shots down the field,
settling instead for inside inns that
struggled all game long. And on the
other side of the ball, the Cardinal
failed to convert Cook's mistakes into
enough turnovers to change the game
those two dropped interceptions
could easily have been the difference
with such a small margin of victory.
I'm not sure how to describe exact
ly what happened or why the offen
sive game plan was simply perplexing.
All season long, we have heard head
coach David Shaw preach that Stan
ford would take whatever an opposing
defense gave it. Against Oregon, that
meant running the ball down the
Ducks' throats. Against Cal and Ari
zona State, that meant throwing the
ball deep down the field. So when
Michigan State stacked the box with
nine defenders, why not go to the
pass-first game plan?
Critics might argue that Michigan
State's secondary is much better than
either Cal's or Arizona State's, and
they would be right. But the Spartans
also had a much better run defense
than either of those teams, so with
nine guys in the box, the defensive
front was effectively impenetrable.
Sure the deep ball may not have
worked, and some, like the one to a
double-covered Rector, may have
even been intercepted. But would that
have been any worse than repeatedly
running the ball into the line? It cer
tainly was worth taking a few more
chances.
So while Michigan State was the
better football team on Jan. 1, Stan
ford still could have avoided the loss.
Fortunately for Shaw and the Car
dinal, the loss shouldn't have much ef
fect on the program. Stanford proved
all it needed to prove by beating Ore
gon and winning the Pac-12. I'd find it
hard to believe that many recruits, if
any at all, would be turned off from
signing with Stanford based on the
Rose Bowl loss.
The most meaningful ramification
from the loss is the unfairly bitter
taste that the Cardinal seniors' ca
reers will end with. The most success
ful seniors and fifth-year seniors in
Stanford history deserved a better
ending, but their careers have been so
great that it hardly feels sad.
Perhaps that's why the Rose Bowl
loss was so much easier to handle than
losses in year's past. There was no
next game either way, the last four
years have been great and Michigan
State also deserved a win, so how can
we be bitter? Anyone complaining
about the results of this season will be
in for a rude awakening in 2014, with
road games at Oregon, UCLA, Notre

Dame, Washington and Ari
zona State looming. So while
the play calling was certainly
frustrating, and the defeat
tough to swallow, it's time to
move on and enjoy all of the
good that the last four- years
brought.
Who knows how long it will
last.

Sam Fisher is not sure what
to do with himself now that

over. Recommend some cop
