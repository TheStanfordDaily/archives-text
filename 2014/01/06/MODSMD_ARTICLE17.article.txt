# FOOTBALL BY THE NUMBERS
## 
### â€“ David Cohn 
91 rushing yards for running back Tyler Gaffney
The senior from San Diego had his moments in the 100 th Rose Bowl Game, but he certainly was challenged by an
aggressive interior defense from the Spartans. With eight or nine Spartan defenders often stacking the box, Gaffney
found little room to move as the second half progressed.
18 passing attempts by quarterback Kevin Hogan
On a day when the No. 1 -ranked Spartan defense simply would not allow the Cardinal to win the Rose Bowl by running
the football, the Cardinal did not throw the ball enough in order to win the game. When given the opportunity, Hogan
was reasonably effective throwing the deep ball against MSU's "no-fly zone," completing passes of 43 and 51 yards.
40 -yard interception return by outside linebacker Kevin Anderson
The junior linebacker from Palo Alto had a memorable performance in his second Rose Bowl Game. Anderson picked
off a poor pass from Michigan State quarterback Connor Cook and returned it for 6 to silence the vocal Spartan contin
gent and increase the Cardinal lead to 16-7. Anderson also had a fantastic tackle for loss in the red zone to help mo
mentarily keep the Spartans at bay in the second quarter.
tackles for loss by senior inside linebacker Shayne Skov
The star fifth-year senior for the Cardinal produced a heroic effort in his final game. Skov had nine total tackles for Stan
ford, while also forcing a fumble in the third quarter on Spartan running back Jeremy Langford to help prematurely end
a promising Spartan drive. For Skov, Trent Murphy and Stanford's other departing seniors, the focus now turns to prepar
ing for the NFL combine and postseason all-star games.
