## CARD COMEBACK STALLS IN ROSE BOWL DEFEAT 
### GEORGE CHEN MANAGING EDITOR 
It's no secret that Stanford football lives
and dies by its running game.
On one of the biggest stages in college foot
ball, the Cardinal running engine sputtered
and then sputtered some more for over three
quarters. And when it mattered the most

when Stanford needed one more yard to keep
its last-minute desperation drive alive the
engine went up in flames.

Senior running back Tyler Gaffney (above) met his match at the 100 th Rose Bowl Game, as he was repeatedly stopped by the stingy
Spartan defense. Gaffney, who has averaged 122 yards per game this season, struggled to find any gains throughout the second half.
game, and, reminiscent of
how it lost to Utah and USC
earlier this season, Stanford's
offense couldn't execute with
the game on the line.
"You play all year and you
fight all season to get to these
moments, to have these op
portunities," said fifth-year
senior linebacker Shayne
Skov. "You play the game to
get these opportunities and
have these games, so to lose is
incredibly difficult."
"[Michigan State] played
better," added head coach
David Shaw. "They made more
plays. That's the bottom line."
There were no early signs
of the Cardinal struggling af
ter a 43-yard connection be
tween junior quarterback
Kevin Hogan and sophomore
wideout Michael Rector set up
a 16-yard touchdown score by
senior halfback Tyler Gaffney,
who razed safety Isaiah Lewis
on his way to the end zone.
Gaffney continued to impose
his will two chives later when
he busted off a 47-yard run
that allowed senior kicker Jor
dan Williamson to hit a 34-
yard field goal. With Stanford
leading Michigan State 10-0 at
the end of the first quarter, the
game appeared to be headed
toward a Cardinal rout instead
of the tight defensive battle it
was predicted to be.
But the Cardinal offense
wouldn't even get a whiff of the
end zone for the rest of the
game.

After rumbling for 67
yards in the first 15 minutes,
Gaffney could only muster 24
yards in the next three quar
ters, and, after displaying an
accuracy of a heat-seeking
missile on the first drive of the
game, Hogan cooled down
quickly and didn't receive
much help from his receivers,
who dropped multiple passes.
Stanford became the definition
of offensive futility, going
three-and-out or turning the
ball over on five of its eight
drives after the first quarter.
"[Michigan State] made
adjustments after the first
couple runs, first couple
drives of the series," Gaffney
said, "and we didn't respond
like we needed to."
Just as the Cardinal of
fense began to crumble, Spar
tans quarterback Connor
Cook and the rest of his of
fense started to put the pieces
together in the second quarter.
Aided by junior outside line
backer Kevin Anderson drop
ping what should have been a
sure interception, Michigan
State went on a 13-play, 75-
yard touchdown drive capped
by tailback Jeremy Langford's
2-yard ran.
Anderson atoned for his
earlier mistake later in the sec
ond quarter by intercepting an
ill-advised pass from Cook,
who was under heavy pressure
from fifth-year senior nickel
back Usua Amanam, and tak
ing it to the house to put the

Cardinal back up by 10.
Cook wasn't fazed at all,
though, not when Stanford's
pass rush failed to hit home
and certainly not when the sec
ondary left Spartan receivers
wide open at times. On the
very next drive, Cook threw a
beautiful back-shoulder pass
to wideout Bennie Fowler
good for 37 yards and two
plays later, Cook rolled out to
his right and hit fullback
Trevon Pendleton for a 2-yard
touchdown.
"[Cook has] played too well
in the last nine games of the
season to think that we're going
to rattle him," Shaw said. "He's
made some bad plays before,
but, just like today, he bounces
back. He's a tough kid, he's a
big kid and he's a better ath
lete than you think."
The Spartans knotted the
game at 17 apiece with an
early field goal to start the
second half, but the rest of
the third quarter turned out
to be a defensive slugfest.
Stanford failed to clean up its
sloppy play, as it committed a
season-high eight penalties.
Equally frustrating for the
Cardinal was its inability to
methodically march down the
field â€”l4l of Stanford's 305
total offensive yards came on
just three plays.
"Everywhere I looked
there was a green defender,"
Gaffney said. "There were
glimpses of [us] being suc
cessful. There were glimpses
of establishing I'd almost say
dominance and then we re
verted back. It's tough when
you can't really get a rhythm

in the game."
Just like how it finally
caved against USC back in
November, the Cardinal de
fense couldn't shut down
Cook in the fourth quarter.
After forcing Stanford to
punt out of its own end zone
a Wildcat play on second
down deep in Cardinal terri
tory resulted in a loss of 5
the Spartans saw their best
field position of the day at the
Cardinal 27, allowing Cook to
find wideout Tony Lippett on
a post for a 25-yard touch
down to give the Spartans
their first lead of the night.
Picked on by Cook all day,
junior cornerback Wayne
Lyons was beat badly by Lip
pett on the play.
"[Cook's] got a lot of
poise, especially in the pock
et, and he's able to extend
plays and find open guys,"
Skov said. "We tried to get af
ter him, but, at the same time,
I think he remained calm and
made plays when he needed
to."
The Cardinal defense
managed to keep it a one-pos
session game. A Williamson
field goal put Stanford within
four, but Stanford couldn't get
a single first down when it got
the ball back with 3:06 left in
the game. Gaffney was held to
a 1-yard gain on third-and-2,
and fifth-year senior Ryan
Hewitt was stuffed for no gain
on a fourth-and-1 that sealed
the game. Fittingly enough, it
was linebacker Kyler
Elsworth, who filled in for the
suspended Max Bullough,
who jumped over the Cardinal

linemen to make the fourth
down stand.
As disappointing as the
loss was, the Cardinal seniors
and fifth-year seniors, includ
ing Skov and outside line
backer Trent Murphy, will end
their careers with four
straight BCS bowl appear
ances. Losing the 100 th Rose
Bowl Game does not take
away the fact that the recruit
ing class of 2009 is the most
successful class in school his
tory.
"When you talk about the
best teams of the BCS era,
you have to mention Stanford
University," Shaw said. "You
have to."

Junior outside linebacker Kevin Anderson (above) returned an interception for a touchdown, but it wasn't enough for the Cardinal to hold off a furious Spartan second-half charge.
