# ACADEMICS
## Special language offerings thrive 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
For more than 30 years, the
Special Language Program
(SLP) has allowed students to
learn less commonly taught lan
guages ranging from Lakota to
Norwegian.
SLP has grown to accommo
date more than 160 students and
18 to 20 languages per quarter
with American Sign Language,
Vietnamese and Hindi proving
the most popular across the
years, according to Eva Prionas
M.A.'76 Ph.D.'Bl, the program's
coordinator.
SLP began as a small-scale
program within the Stanford Lin
guistics Department in the '7os
due to the desire and need that
linguists had to study the struc
ture of language, Prionas said.
In the mid '9os, SLP's move to
become part of the Language
Center brought about more visi
bility, support and resources.
"With moving under the Lan
guage Center, there was more
collaboration with the other lan
guages," Prionas said. "It's really
helpful to be among other lan
guage-teaching peers."
Along with the increased visi
bility, SLP also began to receive
more requests for languages. Ac
cording to Prionas, now five to
seven languages are requested
per quarter.
Requests, however, are not al
ways fulfilled for a variety of rea
sons including unavailability of an

instructor competent enough to
teach the classes, Prionas added.
Setting the curriculum
A language qualifies for SLP
when it is not commonly instruct
ed outside its region of origin.
However, Priones said that this
does not mean that these lan
guages are less commonly spoken
in fact some are spoken by mil
lions of people.
Additionally, some languages
that began as part of SLP have
become part of other depart
ments as they grew more popular,
including Korean and Cantonese.
The class size for SLP lan
guages is usually very small, a
few containing only one student.
Eva Szoke, an instructor of Hun
garian, has four students in her
class this quarter, but she doesn't
see this as a detriment to the
class.
"I have an opportunity to real
ly know the students and tailor
the course material to their
needs," Szoke said.
Language instructors hired
by SLP work part-time, but are
offered the same resources and
benefits of a full-time instructor,
Prionas explained.
SLP class structures are iden
tical to the regular language
courses offered at Stanford, al
though instructors of SLP class
es often face difficulty finding
course materials.
"Just now, I had a very diffi
cult time finding a particular
textbook, and eventually ended

up ordering the books from Hun
gary," Szoke said.
However, Prionas believes
that, despite the difficulties, in
structors have more creativity
within a class, citing modern
technology and the Internet, es
pecially social media, as making
the search for materials an easier
and more diverse experience.
"You have ways to create ma
terials and be innovative," Pri

onas said. "You're not stuck with
the textbook only."
The student experience
Although students have vari
ous reasons for taking SLP
courses, most students take the
classes because of heritage links
with a language or the need to
learn a language for academic re-

search on a region where that lan
guage is spoken.
Gabrial Aldez, a fourth-year
Ph.D. student in mechanical engi
neering, is learning Hungarian
through SLE He mentioned that
although his mother's side is Hun
garian, his family does not speak
the language at home.
"I have decided that after all
these years, I did want to learn
Hungarian and get in touch with
my family history,"Aldez said.
Similarly, Natalie Nguyen 'l5 is
taking Vietnamese through SLP to
better connect with her family's

cultural history and what she calls
her "mother tongue".
"I've never appreciated Viet
namese culture more in my life,"
Nguyen said.
Lukas Dovern, a second-year
Ph.D. student in history, is in his
second year of studying Czech for
strictly academic purposes, as his
focus is on comparative research
on Central and Eastern European
history.
"I had to know the language be
cause most of the research done on
this region are by scholars who ei
ther only know Russian or one cen
tral European language," Dovern
said.
Sometimes students find them
selves unable to fit well in the lan
guage levels already defined, find
ing the beginner class too easy and
the intermediate class too difficult.
Additionally, even within the class
es themselves, students come from
different backgrounds and experi
ences in the language.
Prionas addressed this issue by
stating that SLP is committed to
offering languages in at least two
levels, sometimes with higher-level
classes offered every other year.
SLP is committed to educating
students about the cultures of each
language's target region, with six
to eight Fulbright Scholars from
the relevant countries serving as
course Teaching Assistants (TAs).
"[The scholars] come to our pro
gram as TAs and are young ambas
sadors of their countries," Prionas
said. "The direct communication
between scholars and students en
hances the cultural learning."
