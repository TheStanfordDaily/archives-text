# ACADEMICS
## Special language offerings thrive 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
For more than 30 years, the
Special Language Program
(SLP) has allowed students to
learn less commonly taught lan
guages ranging from Lakota to
Norwegian.
SLP has grown to accommo
date more than 160 students and
18 to 20 languages per quarter
with American Sign Language,
Vietnamese and Hindi proving
the most popular across the
years, according to Eva Prionas
M.A.'76 Ph.D.'Bl, the program's
coordinator.
SLP began as a small-scale
program within the Stanford Lin
guistics Department in the '7os
due to the desire and need that
linguists had to study the struc
ture of language, Prionas said.
In the mid '9os, SLP's move to
become part of the Language
Center brought about more visi
bility, support and resources.
"With moving under the Lan
guage Center, there was more
collaboration with the other lan
guages," Prionas said. "It's really
helpful to be among other lan
guage-teaching peers."
Along with the increased visi
bility, SLP also began to receive
more requests for languages. Ac
cording to Prionas, now five to
seven languages are requested
per quarter.
Requests, however, are not al
ways fulfilled for a variety of rea
sons including unavailability of an

instructor competent enough to
teach the classes, Prionas added.
Setting the curriculum
A language qualifies for SLP
when it is not commonly instruct
ed outside its region of origin.
However, Priones said that this
does not mean that these lan
guages are less commonly spoken
in fact some are spoken by mil
lions of people.
Additionally, some languages
that began as part of SLP have
become part of other depart
ments as they grew more popular,
including Korean and Cantonese.
The class size for SLP lan
guages is usually very small, a
few containing only one student.
Eva Szoke, an instructor of Hun
garian, has four students in her
class this quarter, but she doesn't
see this as a detriment to the
class.
"I have an opportunity to real
ly know the students and tailor
the course material to their
needs," Szoke said.
Language instructors hired
by SLP work part-time, but are
offered the same resources and
benefits of a full-time instructor,
Prionas explained.
SLP class structures are iden
tical to the regular language
courses offered at Stanford, al
though instructors of SLP class
es often face difficulty finding
course materials.
"Just now, I had a very diffi
cult time finding a particular
textbook, and eventually ended

up ordering the books from Hun
gary," Szoke said.
However, Prionas believes
that, despite the difficulties, in
structors have more creativity
within a class, citing modern
technology and the Internet, es
pecially social media, as making
the search for materials an easier
and more diverse experience.
"You have ways to create ma
terials and be innovative," Pri

onas said. "You're not stuck with
the textbook only."
The student experience
Although students have vari
ous reasons for taking SLP
courses, most students take the
classes because of heritage links
with a language or the need to
learn a language for academic re-

in the Linguistics Department, has grown to offer 18 to 20
languages per quarter as well as cultural connections for students.
