## Director of OCS leaves judicial role Bakkegard said Student Justice Project did not influence decision 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
The current director of the Office of
Community Standards (OCS), Koren
Bakkegard, stepped down today to serve
as associate dean of Residential Educa
tion (ResEd).
Associate Vice Provost and Dean of
Student Life Chris Griffith said in an
email statement that a national search
for a new director will begin early this
month with a search committee com
prised of faculty, students and staff.
Bakkegard who became the first
OCS director in October of 2012 said
she will continue to oversee cases she is
currently handling as a judicial advisor
while she takes up her new role in
ResEd, where she will mainly work in
the freshmen program.
Prior to leading the OCS, Bakkegard
served as director of new student pro
grams with then Dean of Freshmen Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9, advised frosh coun
cil and served as assistant dean of fresh
men and later associate dean of Under
graduate Advising and Research.
Bakkegard said she applied for the
ResEd position because she saw it as an
opportunity to return to her professional
love.
"This is going back to the work that I
really love to do, which is working with
our first-year students at Stanford,"
Bakkegard said.
News of Bakkegard's transition
comes three months after the Student
Justice Project a group alleging a bi
ased judicial affairs process re
leased testimonials that raised con
cerns about the OCS for issues of mis
conduct in the judicial process includ
ing intimidation of witnesses and viola
tion of student privacy.
Bakkegard, however, said the efforts
of the Student Justice Project did not
play a role in her decision to leave the
OCS.
In terms of her work at the OCS,
Bakkegard spoke of the office's progress
in implementing recommendations that
came out of the Internal Review Panel
