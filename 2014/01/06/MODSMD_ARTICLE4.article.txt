## Director of OCS leaves judicial role Bakkegard said Student Justice Project did not influence decision 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
The current director of the Office of
Community Standards (OCS), Koren
Bakkegard, stepped down today to serve
as associate dean of Residential Educa
tion (ResEd).
Associate Vice Provost and Dean of
Student Life Chris Griffith said in an
email statement that a national search
for a new director will begin early this
month with a search committee com
prised of faculty, students and staff.
Bakkegard who became the first
OCS director in October of 2012 said
she will continue to oversee cases she is
currently handling as a judicial advisor
while she takes up her new role in
ResEd, where she will mainly work in
the freshmen program.
Prior to leading the OCS, Bakkegard
served as director of new student pro
grams with then Dean of Freshmen Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9, advised frosh coun
cil and served as assistant dean of fresh
men and later associate dean of Under
graduate Advising and Research.
Bakkegard said she applied for the
ResEd position because she saw it as an
opportunity to return to her professional
love.
"This is going back to the work that I
really love to do, which is working with
our first-year students at Stanford,"
Bakkegard said.
News of Bakkegard's transition
comes three months after the Student
Justice Project a group alleging a bi
ased judicial affairs process re
leased testimonials that raised con
cerns about the OCS for issues of mis
conduct in the judicial process includ
ing intimidation of witnesses and viola
tion of student privacy.
Bakkegard, however, said the efforts
of the Student Justice Project did not
play a role in her decision to leave the
OCS.
In terms of her work at the OCS,
Bakkegard spoke of the office's progress
in implementing recommendations that
came out of the Internal Review Panel
commissioned by President John
Hennessy and Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Greg Boardman in
2010 to review Judicial Affairs at
Stanford. One example of steps
taken includes her appointment as
the first director of the OCS, which
was renamed from the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs where she held her
first position at Stanford as a judi
cial advisor and officer.
Bakkegard also highlighted the
efforts to improve communications
between the ASSU and the OCS as
well as changes to the OCS web
site to make it easier for students
to be informed of the judicial
process.
She added that many recom
mendations of the Internal Review
Panel remain to be addressed,
most dealing with education and
outreach to ensure that faculty and
students fully understand the
Honor Code including creating ed
ucational modules.
"We really need to ensure that
all of our constituents are aware of,
understand and are committed to
the Honor Code," Bakkegard said.
"That's not something you can
count on, people reading the Hon
or Code once and really being able
to uphold its tenants."
"It's ongoing work that we need
to participate in," she added.
Griffith said that she does not
anticipate a need for an interim di
rector for the OCS as Bakkegard
positioned the office to continue
meeting its duties while the search
for a new director goes underway.
