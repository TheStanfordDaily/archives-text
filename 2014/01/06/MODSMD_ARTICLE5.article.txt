# STUDENT LIFE
## Plans begin for drop-in 'arts gym' 
### EDWARD NGAI EDITOR IN CHIEF 
As the arts scene at Stanford receives
increasing resources and attention, the
University has started planning the con
struction of a new "arts gym" a drop
in studio and performing arts space at
Roble Gym.
An enormous amount of interest is
driving the University to keep up with
student demand for arts spaces, accord
ing to Matthew Tiews M.A. '99 Ph.D. 'O4,
executive director of arts program.
"There was a real desire for a drop-in
creative space where students could
come, just swipe their ID, get in and have
a space to make work, rehearse and per
form in," Tiews said.
The initiative is the latest in a long and
expensive effort to increase the role and
visibility of the arts on campus. The $B5
million dollar McMurtry Building, the
new home of Stanford's Department of
Art and Ait History, will open in a year,
down the street from the acclaimed Bing
Concert Hall. An additional $30.5 million
is being spent to house the Anderson Col
lection, a major collection of modern and
contemporary art. These development
projects at the end of Palm Drive are in-
tended to serve as the foundation
for Stanford's new arts district a
hub for creative expression that will
greet visitors when they come to
campus.
With the University investing in
the arts, Tiews said resources have
been allocated to increase student
access to creative spaces, including
the tentatively named "arts gym"
project. The project is now in its de
sign phase with completion aimed
for fall of 2015.
The creation of practice spaces
available by reservation for all stu
dents not just those taking a re
lated class or part of a University
affiliated student group would
satisfy a longtime need for students
on campus.
Designated facilities, like the
Braun Music Center, prioritize de
partmentally affiliated students
and sometimes leave independent
artists without places to rehearse.

To keep up with the demand, the
University has been working with
students to better equip or convert
community spaces into ones that
could support art making.
Last December Viraj Bindra 'l5,
a former ASSU senator, helped cre
ate a practice room for independent
musicians in the Stern Dining com
plex. To do so, he worked with a
range of University officials, includ
ing the Stanford Arts Institute,
Residential and Dining Enterprises
and art and art history faculty.
"The need for an independent
student music space stemmed di
rectly out of my conversations with
students frustrated by the lack of
available practice space on cam
pus," Bindra said. "I've heard a lot
of positive feedback about the mu
sic room in Stern Hall, and hopeful
ly we'll see another major practice
room on campus in the near fu
ture."
Actively supporting independ
ent artists has become a top priori
ty, according to Paula Salazar 'l3,
the arts in student life coordinator
at the Stanford Arts Institute. She
argues that just because a student

isn't taking a related class doesn't
mean the arts are any less valuable.
"We definitely understand that
there is a lack of arts spaces on
campus, and it's one of our biggest
priorities," Salazar said, citing dis
cussions about "flex spaces" for stu
dent work and performance at the
new McMurtry building.
"Our priority is to help students
who might not [be affiliated with an
arts department]... at Stanford
art will still be a part of their lives
and will continue to enrich their ex
perience," she added.
The proposed drop-in rehearsal,
performance and studio concept at
Roble Gym is one such attempt.
When Toamatapu Lohe 'l6 ap
proached the Stanford Arts Insti
tute with a proposal to designate a
centralized space for any artist to
find any tool in any field, he found
that the University was already
planning to outfit existing facilities
with new gadgets.
"They are expanding their cre
ative spaces," Lohe said. "One ex
ample would be getting a green
screen for filmmakers or creating
Lanthrop Library, where there will

be rooms for video production, like
a video editing bay."
Personally, Lohe contributes to
the arts scene by working with Aca
demic Computing Services to put
on arts-related programming on
the second floor of Meyer Library.
His vision for the arts on campus
is an environment where creatively
inclined students of many different
fields can meet and germinate new
ideas. He is now working with more
than a dozen sophomores and the
Hasso Plattner Institute of Design
to create a space for members of dif
ferent artistic disciplines to interact.
According to Salazar, the whirl
wind growth of arts funding and a
strong desire to harness student
ideas have opened up a rare oppor
tunity for current students to im
pact Stanford's creative community
long after they leave.
"Students are really having a
say on what the arts looks like on
campus," she said. "They really
have a hand in future generations of
art experience at Stanford."

at Roble Gym. The project is part of an effort to increase the role and visibility of the arts on campus and support individual artists.
As the arts scene at Stanford receives
increasing resources and attention, the
University has started planning the con
struction of a new "arts gym" a drop
in studio and performing arts space at
Roble Gym.
An enormous amount of interest is
driving the University to keep up with
student demand for arts spaces, accord
ing to Matthew Tiews M.A. '99 Ph.D. 'O4,
executive director of arts program.
"There was a real desire for a drop-in
creative space where students could
come, just swipe their ID, get in and have
a space to make work, rehearse and per
form in," Tiews said.
The initiative is the latest in a long and
expensive effort to increase the role and
visibility of the arts on campus. The $B5
million dollar McMurtry Building, the
new home of Stanford's Department of
Art and Ait History, will open in a year,
down the street from the acclaimed Bing
Concert Hall. An additional $30.5 million
is being spent to house the Anderson Col
lection, a major collection of modern and
contemporary art. These development
projects at the end of Palm Drive are in-
tended to serve as the foundation
for Stanford's new arts district a
hub for creative expression that will
greet visitors when they come to
campus.
With the University investing in
the arts, Tiews said resources have
been allocated to increase student
access to creative spaces, including
the tentatively named "arts gym"
project. The project is now in its de
sign phase with completion aimed
for fall of 2015.
The creation of practice spaces
available by reservation for all stu
dents not just those taking a re
lated class or part of a University
affiliated student group would
satisfy a longtime need for students
on campus.
Designated facilities, like the
Braun Music Center, prioritize de
partmentally affiliated students
and sometimes leave independent
artists without places to rehearse.

To keep up with the demand, the
University has been working with
students to better equip or convert
community spaces into ones that
could support art making.
Last December Viraj Bindra 'l5,
a former ASSU senator, helped cre
ate a practice room for independent
musicians in the Stern Dining com
plex. To do so, he worked with a
range of University officials, includ
ing the Stanford Arts Institute,
Residential and Dining Enterprises
and art and art history faculty.
"The need for an independent
student music space stemmed di
rectly out of my conversations with
students frustrated by the lack of
available practice space on cam
pus," Bindra said. "I've heard a lot
of positive feedback about the mu
sic room in Stern Hall, and hopeful
ly we'll see another major practice
room on campus in the near fu
ture."
Actively supporting independ
ent artists has become a top priori
ty, according to Paula Salazar 'l3,
the arts in student life coordinator
at the Stanford Arts Institute. She
argues that just because a student

isn't taking a related class doesn't
mean the arts are any less valuable.
"We definitely understand that
there is a lack of arts spaces on
campus, and it's one of our biggest
priorities," Salazar said, citing dis
cussions about "flex spaces" for stu
dent work and performance at the
new McMurtry building.
"Our priority is to help students
who might not [be affiliated with an
arts department]... at Stanford
art will still be a part of their lives
and will continue to enrich their ex
perience," she added.
The proposed drop-in rehearsal,
performance and studio concept at
Roble Gym is one such attempt.
When Toamatapu Lohe 'l6 ap
proached the Stanford Arts Insti
tute with a proposal to designate a
centralized space for any artist to
find any tool in any field, he found
that the University was already
planning to outfit existing facilities
with new gadgets.
"They are expanding their cre
ative spaces," Lohe said. "One ex
ample would be getting a green
screen for filmmakers or creating
Lanthrop Library, where there will

be rooms for video production, like
a video editing bay."
Personally, Lohe contributes to
the arts scene by working with Aca
demic Computing Services to put
on arts-related programming on
the second floor of Meyer Library.
His vision for the arts on campus
is an environment where creatively
inclined students of many different
fields can meet and germinate new
ideas. He is now working with more
than a dozen sophomores and the
Hasso Plattner Institute of Design
to create a space for members of dif
ferent artistic disciplines to interact.
According to Salazar, the whirl
wind growth of arts funding and a
strong desire to harness student
ideas have opened up a rare oppor
tunity for current students to im
pact Stanford's creative community
long after they leave.
"Students are really having a
say on what the arts looks like on
campus," she said. "They really
have a hand in future generations of
art experience at Stanford."
