## Global Middle Ages minor in development for next fall 
### MINNA XIAO DESK EDITOR 
A new interdisciplinary Global
Middle Ages minor at Stanford is
under development and will be
launched in fall 2014.
Kathryn Starkey, a professor in
the Department of German Stud
ies; Elaine Treharne, professor of
medieval literature in the Depart
ment of English; and Bissera
Pentcheva, associate professor in
the Department of Art & Art Histo
ry, are spearheading the initiative
with funding from the Faculty Col

lege program. Starkey and Tre
harne also serve as co-directors of
the Center for Medieval and Early
Modern Studies (CMEMS).
Pentcheva explained in an email
statement to The Daily that the ex
pansion of the medieval studies fac
ulty in 2011 enriched a vibrant
scholarly community at Stanford.
This in turn motivated the three
faculty members to propose the mi
nor as a replacement for the preex
isting interdisciplinary program in
medieval studies, for which no stu
dents have signed up since 2010.
"We are seeking ways in which

the introductory courses [of the mi
nor] could be spread out to reach
beyond the scope of the usual hu
manities students in trying to be in
ventive in the way we structure the
minor," Pentcheva said.
Three courses The Digital
Middle Ages, Medieval Journeys
and Performing the Middle Ages
are in development for the minor as
a selection from which students can
choose a core course. Students will
fulfill the remaining minor require
ments based on a list of courses that
satisfy the minor; this list includes
courses like Arthist 408 C: Architec

ture, Acoustics and Ritual in Byzan
tium, Music 305A: Analysis and
Repertoire: Medieval and Renais
sance and Phil 101: Introduction to
Medieval Philosophy.
Pentcheva explained the team is
trying to list the core courses as
electives for other fields such as en
gineering and computer science to
reach out to a broader group of stu
dents for the minor.
Starkey added that the core
course offerings will be similar to
each other in key material but will
differ in the way students ap
proach their course projects.
"They are structured like tem
plates right now, so that the first
part of the course will always pro
vide a core material about the me
dieval period," Starkey said. "The
second part of the course will be
thinking about journeys, perform
ance or digitalization projects, de
pending on which course is being
taught."
True to the interdisciplinary na
ture of the Global Middle Ages mi
nor, Starkey explained how the
course project for The Digital Mid
dle Ages, for example, might be a
digital project that could include
creating a website on a particular
manuscript held at Stanford or
making a video, podcast or visuali
zation of a medieval space or land
scape. Starkey hopes that such

modern approaches to teaching
medieval studies will draw stu
dents from all fields, including the
more technically inclined.
Ben Diego 'l6, a sophomore
double majoring in history and
English, discovered the study of
medieval manuscripts during his
freshman year after working one
on-one with Treharne who is
now his major advisor on a 1596
manuscript from a Spanish town
where most of his family now lives.
With such a background, Diego is
excited for the new minor.
"To understand the crusades or
the [Cathedral of Santiago de
Compostela] or the St. Albans
Psalter requires a mental adjust
ment," Diego said. "The medieval
mind that made their production
possible was radically different
from the modern mind.
"But something essentially hu
man connects me to it and I want
to figure out what that is," he
added.
Starkey is confident of the value
that students will gain from im
mersing themselves in the study of
the Middle Ages and emphasizes
the important academic skills that
students can develop by studying
this history period in depth.
