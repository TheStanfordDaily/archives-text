## OP-ED When Your Job is Not Work 
### Wyatt Bunce â€“ WYATT BUNCE '14 
Work is everywhere, and that
might seem intimidating.
This is the case at Stanford
Sierra Camp, a place where I have
worked for three summers in a row.
Sierra Camp taught me a new kind
of work, a kind that does not have to
be a place you go to at 9 a.m., look at
a computer screen, interact cordially
with colleagues and then leave at 5
p.m. At the Sierra Camp, work is all
encompassing. Work is leading a
"Disco Bingo" night for guests every
Monday. It is helping a kid clean up
a scraped knee after a shift. It is
taking a boat of guests out at night
on an "Astroeruise." It is joining
guests for meals and teaching kids
how to waterski. Work is waking up
before the sun and preparing the
dining room for breakfast. Work is
everywhere, and that is a good
thing. The friendships, the energy
and the attitude that meaning can
be found in any task is what makes
Sierra Camp feel different from
work. I have come to realize that
the most productive kind of work
combines enjoyment and a spirited
community.
Shifts at camp are spent with a
supportive and vibrant community.
The energy is contagious. Cleaning
60 cabins? That's daunting. But the
half hour leading up to housekeep
ing is spent in a Braveheart-style
pep rally screaming "HOUSE
KEEPING MEETING" and listen
ing to Morgan, the head of house
keeping, recite William Wallace's
pump-up speech. Staffers sprint out
of the meeting with a will to make
every toilet at camp sparkle.
Bussing 40 tables? That sounds like
work. A lot of work. But when
bussing becomes a Civil War
themed contest complete with cos
tumes and prizes, it does not feel
like work. The people I worked with
brought an energy and mindset
that any work can be fun. We made
our job fulfilling, and we worked
quicker because we found joy in
what we were doing.
I often forgot that Sierra Camp
was a job the fun I had socializ
ing was indistinguishable from the
fun I had working. I loved my work
at camp because the community
was supportive and brought energy
to everything. I looked forward to
every Saturday, our most rigorous
day of housekeeping, because I
knew I got to work with the people
I loved. The encouragement I re
ceived from these people made me a
more confident person. I had never
felt so comfortable letting the weird
side of my personality run free as I
did at camp. I feel this confidence at
Stanford too. I made mistakes, and
I had bad days at Sierra Camp, but
I always knew the community
would support me through those
times. At Sierra Camp, work is
pleasure because it is spent with
people that are more like friends
than colleagues. Personal growth is
another aspect of camp that makes
it feel different from work. The
camp community pushed me
through my most difficult work
tasks.
Learning the value of communi
ty changed the way I tackle proj
ects. I learned that people are my
best resource in all my pursuits. I

search for support and collabora
tion on projects, and the sense of
community is empowering. I do not
think that the blending of work, en
tertainment and community is
unique to Stanford Sierra Camp.
The blending begins with an atti
tude a mindset that embraces all
tasks. One that makes these tasks
something to care about. This atti
tude is one that students are capa
ble of finding and applying to aca
demics and to the professional
world. Dirty work and menial tasks
can have meaning at Stanford.
When I clean my dorm room, I turn
on Sandstorm and jump around to
amp myself up. I do not see small
talk, email and other "menial" tasks
as duties. Instead, I find away to
make them my own to invest en
ergy in them and to use them as a
means for self-expression. Giving
attention to tasks at hand has made
me more present. I am engaged
with life, and I focus. In hindsight,
too much of my youth including
my high school experience was
spent sacrificing the present to ad
vance my future. I dragged myself
through many responsibilities to
open up future opportunities. I am
not saying students should sacrifice
future opportunities in order to en
joy the present. Rather, I advocate
engaging in these responsibilities.
Finding a work community and
initiating energy and positivity
within that work community is es
sential to finding happiness and
productivity in the work place. The
energy you put into a community is
contagious, and the support you re
ceive in return is fulfilling. Ideally, a
career should not feel like an obli
gation. It should foster friendships,
support, energy and a love for what
you are doing. A job does not have to
feel like work it can be something
you look forward to.
