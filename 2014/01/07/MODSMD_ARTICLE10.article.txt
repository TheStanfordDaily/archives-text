# INSTANT REPLAY
## HOW ANDERSON PICKED FOR SIX 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At the end of the Rose Bowl, it
seemed like either team could have
won or lost by two touchdowns.
That's a good game in anyone's
book. Stanford lost to Michigan
State in the 100 th Rose Bowl, but
while losing is never fun to watch,
the Cardinal and the Spartans def
initely played an instant classic in
Pasadena.
Everyone expected Michigan
State's defense to come out and
play, and it did. The Spartan D was
helped immensely by its special
teams, which neutralized Stan
ford's top-ranked returners
Stanford's offense was routinely
stuck deep in its own territory
and it took spectacular showings
by kicker Jordan Williamson
(touchbacks on all five kickoffs)
and punter Ben Rhyne (49.8 yards
per punt) to keep Stanford in the
game.
What was especially surprising,
however, was that Stanford gave
up 24 points to the Spartan offense.
Michigan State's offense has
been a bit of a national punch line
in recent years. By season's end,

however, the Rose Bowl proved
confident MSU fans correct:
Michigan State's offense, once
sputtering, was a solid unit. Vegas
favored Stanford by a touchdown;
that was probably a mistake. The
Spartans outplayed Stanford in all
three phases of the game and, as
much as it hurts to admit it, they
deserved to win.
Stanford's defense still kept the
Cardinal in the game, however. Al
though Spartan quarterback Con
nor Cook was excellent when given
time, he was shaky under pressure
and made a number of horrendous
decisions. And when Stanford's of
fense sputtered, defensive coordi
nator Derek Mason's unit put up
some points on its own line
backer Kevin Anderson returned
an interception for a touchdown
late in the second quarter.
With just over two minutes left
in the first half, Michigan State
was only at its own 45-yard line.
The Spartans were facing second
and-6 and pressing, and Mason de
cided to try to bait Cook into a mis
take. He called a 3-3 zone blitz,
fielding three deep defenders and
another three under them. Al
though the play call was vulnerable

on short routes, it was both solid
against the deep ball and able to
blitz five men instead of the usual
four.
The purpose of the zone blitz is
to mix confusing coverages with
blitz pressure, and it worked to
perfection against the Spartans.
Aware of its own tendencies, the
Cardinal showed an unexpected
look on this play. Fifth-year senior
nickelback Usua Amanam (N)
lined up in coverage before the
snap set up shop on the line of
scrimmage after Cook had called
the play, and it was too late for

Cook to change the pass protec
tion. With six defensive players
against five offensive linemen,
MSU couldn't run the ball. Mean
while, safety Jordan Richards (not
pictured for clarity), normally the
last line of the defense, headed to
the flat, filling Amanam's role.
Perhaps most surprisingly, line
backer Trent Murphy (S) the
nation's premier sack master
dropped back into coverage (blue
line) to rob short crossing routes.
As a pass rusher, Murphy is so
