# INSTANT REPLAY
## HOW ANDERSON PICKED FOR SIX 
### WINSTON SHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At the end of the Rose Bowl, it
seemed like either team could have
won or lost by two touchdowns.
That's a good game in anyone's
book. Stanford lost to Michigan
State in the 100 th Rose Bowl, but
while losing is never fun to watch,
the Cardinal and the Spartans def
initely played an instant classic in
Pasadena.
Everyone expected Michigan
State's defense to come out and
play, and it did. The Spartan D was
helped immensely by its special
teams, which neutralized Stan
ford's top-ranked returners
Stanford's offense was routinely
stuck deep in its own territory
and it took spectacular showings
by kicker Jordan Williamson
(touchbacks on all five kickoffs)
and punter Ben Rhyne (49.8 yards
per punt) to keep Stanford in the
game.
What was especially surprising,
however, was that Stanford gave
up 24 points to the Spartan offense.
Michigan State's offense has
been a bit of a national punch line
in recent years. By season's end,

however, the Rose Bowl proved
confident MSU fans correct:
Michigan State's offense, once
sputtering, was a solid unit. Vegas
favored Stanford by a touchdown;
that was probably a mistake. The
Spartans outplayed Stanford in all
three phases of the game and, as
much as it hurts to admit it, they
deserved to win.
Stanford's defense still kept the
Cardinal in the game, however. Al
though Spartan quarterback Con
nor Cook was excellent when given
time, he was shaky under pressure
and made a number of horrendous
decisions. And when Stanford's of
fense sputtered, defensive coordi
nator Derek Mason's unit put up
some points on its own line
backer Kevin Anderson returned
an interception for a touchdown
late in the second quarter.
With just over two minutes left
in the first half, Michigan State
was only at its own 45-yard line.
The Spartans were facing second
and-6 and pressing, and Mason de
cided to try to bait Cook into a mis
take. He called a 3-3 zone blitz,
fielding three deep defenders and
another three under them. Al
though the play call was vulnerable

on short routes, it was both solid
against the deep ball and able to
blitz five men instead of the usual
four.
The purpose of the zone blitz is
to mix confusing coverages with
blitz pressure, and it worked to
perfection against the Spartans.
Aware of its own tendencies, the
Cardinal showed an unexpected
look on this play. Fifth-year senior
nickelback Usua Amanam (N)
lined up in coverage before the
snap set up shop on the line of
scrimmage after Cook had called
the play, and it was too late for

Cook to change the pass protec
tion. With six defensive players
against five offensive linemen,
MSU couldn't run the ball. Mean
while, safety Jordan Richards (not
pictured for clarity), normally the
last line of the defense, headed to
the flat, filling Amanam's role.
Perhaps most surprisingly, line
backer Trent Murphy (S) the
nation's premier sack master
dropped back into coverage (blue
line) to rob short crossing routes.
As a pass rusher, Murphy is so

dominant that no offensive
coordinator should consider
blocking him with a running
back. As such, it was un
thinkable for MSU to exe
cute a traditional full slide
protection to the right, where
the running back blocks
Murphy and all the linemen
block right. Meanwhile, there
was no way to slide left be
cause Stanford outnumbered
the defense on the right so
greatly. But schematically,
slide protection is the sound
est option an offensive line
can take. By having linemen
block areas instead of specif
ic men, the protection can
hold against blitzers who loop
from one gap to another.
Michigan State decided to
go half-slide: man-on-man to
the left with two blockers and
a slide to the right with three,
a mirror image of what Stan
ford did on the critical play
against USC. With fifth-year
senior inside linebacker
Shayne Skov walking up to
the line of scrimmage, MSU's
center anticipated a blitz and
decided to help to the right
(toward Skov) instead of to
the left. As with USC against
the Cardinal, the defense's
best shot was to attack where
the man-blocking ended and
the slide protection began.
The blitz was already very
favorable because of the
geometry of the play: There
was nobody nearby to block
Amanam. MSU's right tackle
was too far away to block him
properly, and while the Spar
tan running back was in the
backfield to block free
blitzers, most half-slides put
the back on the man side of
the formation the wrong
side in that case. With the
running back placed behind
the quarterback, Amanam
was free to take target prac
tice at Cook.
With Amanam pressuring
on the right, linebacker

Kevin Anderson (W) could
devote his energies to attack
ing the left. The blitz was es
sentially designed for him:
On the left, sophomore de
fensive end Aziz Shittu (E)
engaged his man (MSU's left
guard) and forced him left,
while Skov (M) occupied the
center, already sliding right.
Anderson looped around
Skov (red line) and senior de
fensive end Henry Anderson
(E on the right), intending to
drive through the gap, where
he would have a favorable
matchup against a running
back. Looping is in general a
counterintuitive idea, which
is why it was effective here:
It changed the internal math
ematics of the play, putting a
man where MSU didn't ex
pect there to be one. This was
not a very run-sound tactic,
but against a pass it could be
useful.
By not giving MSU's
right side specific man as
signments, the slide scheme
allowed the Spartan right
guard to head upfield and
disrupt Anderson's path to
the gap. But Amanam had
Cook on his heels immediate
ly, and by delaying Ander
son's attack, MSU ironically
put the linebacker in perfect
position to catch Cook's des
perate heave. Already in the
backfield, Anderson had no
Spartans in front of him and
ran straight to the end zone.
More than anything else,
Anderson's interception was
what made the Rose Bowl
such a brilliant back-and-forth
affair. Even though MSU
played better overall, Stanford
had its chances to win, and sim
ilar defensive pressure created
two more gilt-edged intercep
tion chances that bounced out of
Stanford defenders' hands. For
all the hand wringing that oc
curred, the Cardinal had the
ball at the end with a chance
to win the game and failed.
The Rose Bowl wasn't a
crushing defeat. But it hurt
all the same.

est option an offensive line
can take. By having linemen
block areas instead of specif
ic men, the protection can
hold against blitzers who loop
from one gap to another.
Michigan State decided to
go half-slide: man-on-man to
the left with two blockers and
a slide to the right with three,
a mirror image of what Stan
ford did on the critical play
against USC. With fifth-year
senior inside linebacker
Shayne Skov walking up to
the line of scrimmage, MSU's
center anticipated a blitz and
decided to help to the right
(toward Skov) instead of to
the left. As with USC against
the Cardinal, the defense's
best shot was to attack where
the man-blocking ended and
the slide protection began.
The blitz was already very
favorable because of the
geometry of the play: There
was nobody nearby to block
Amanam. MSU's right tackle
was too far away to block him
properly, and while the Spar
tan running back was in the
backfield to block free
blitzers, most half-slides put
the back on the man side of
the formation the wrong
side in that case. With the
running back placed behind
the quarterback, Amanam
was free to take target prac
tice at Cook.
With Amanam pressuring
on the right, linebacker

Kevin Anderson (W) could
devote his energies to attack
ing the left. The blitz was es
sentially designed for him:
On the left, sophomore de
fensive end Aziz Shittu (E)
engaged his man (MSU's left
guard) and forced him left,
while Skov (M) occupied the
center, already sliding right.
Anderson looped around
Skov (red line) and senior de
fensive end Henry Anderson
(E on the right), intending to
drive through the gap, where
he would have a favorable
matchup against a running
back. Looping is in general a
counterintuitive idea, which
is why it was effective here:
It changed the internal math
ematics of the play, putting a
man where MSU didn't ex
pect there to be one. This was
not a very run-sound tactic,
but against a pass it could be
useful.
By not giving MSU's
right side specific man as
signments, the slide scheme
allowed the Spartan right
guard to head upfield and
disrupt Anderson's path to
the gap. But Amanam had
Cook on his heels immediate
ly, and by delaying Ander
son's attack, MSU ironically
put the linebacker in perfect
position to catch Cook's des
perate heave. Already in the
backfield, Anderson had no
Spartans in front of him and
ran straight to the end zone.
More than anything else,
Anderson's interception was
what made the Rose Bowl
such a brilliant back-and-forth
affair. Even though MSU
played better overall, Stanford
had its chances to win, and sim
ilar defensive pressure created
two more gilt-edged intercep
tion chances that bounced out of
Stanford defenders' hands. For
all the hand wringing that oc
curred, the Cardinal had the
ball at the end with a chance
to win the game and failed.
The Rose Bowl wasn't a
crushing defeat. But it hurt
all the same.

At the end of the Rose Bowl, it
seemed like either team could have
won or lost by two touchdowns.
That's a good game in anyone's
book. Stanford lost to Michigan
State in the 100 th Rose Bowl, but
while losing is never fun to watch,
the Cardinal and the Spartans def
initely played an instant classic in
Pasadena.
Everyone expected Michigan
State's defense to come out and
play, and it did. The Spartan D was
helped immensely by its special
teams, which neutralized Stan
ford's top-ranked returners
Stanford's offense was routinely
stuck deep in its own territory
and it took spectacular showings
by kicker Jordan Williamson
(touchbacks on all five kickoffs)
and punter Ben Rhyne (49.8 yards
per punt) to keep Stanford in the
game.
What was especially surprising,
however, was that Stanford gave
up 24 points to the Spartan offense.
Michigan State's offense has
been a bit of a national punch line
in recent years. By season's end,

however, the Rose Bowl proved
confident MSU fans correct:
Michigan State's offense, once
sputtering, was a solid unit. Vegas
favored Stanford by a touchdown;
that was probably a mistake. The
Spartans outplayed Stanford in all
three phases of the game and, as
much as it hurts to admit it, they
deserved to win.
Stanford's defense still kept the
Cardinal in the game, however. Al
though Spartan quarterback Con
nor Cook was excellent when given
time, he was shaky under pressure
and made a number of horrendous
decisions. And when Stanford's of
fense sputtered, defensive coordi
nator Derek Mason's unit put up
some points on its own line
backer Kevin Anderson returned
an interception for a touchdown
late in the second quarter.
With just over two minutes left
in the first half, Michigan State
was only at its own 45-yard line.
The Spartans were facing second
and-6 and pressing, and Mason de
cided to try to bait Cook into a mis
take. He called a 3-3 zone blitz,
fielding three deep defenders and
another three under them. Al
though the play call was vulnerable

on short routes, it was both solid
against the deep ball and able to
blitz five men instead of the usual
four.
The purpose of the zone blitz is
to mix confusing coverages with
blitz pressure, and it worked to
perfection against the Spartans.
Aware of its own tendencies, the
Cardinal showed an unexpected
look on this play. Fifth-year senior
nickelback Usua Amanam (N)
lined up in coverage before the
snap set up shop on the line of
scrimmage after Cook had called
the play, and it was too late for

Cook to change the pass protec
tion. With six defensive players
against five offensive linemen,
MSU couldn't run the ball. Mean
while, safety Jordan Richards (not
pictured for clarity), normally the
last line of the defense, headed to
the flat, filling Amanam's role.
Perhaps most surprisingly, line
backer Trent Murphy (S) the
nation's premier sack master
dropped back into coverage (blue
line) to rob short crossing routes.
As a pass rusher, Murphy is so

dominant that no offensive
coordinator should consider
blocking him with a running
back. As such, it was un
thinkable for MSU to exe
cute a traditional full slide
protection to the right, where
the running back blocks
Murphy and all the linemen
block right. Meanwhile, there
was no way to slide left be
cause Stanford outnumbered
the defense on the right so
greatly. But schematically,
slide protection is the sound
est option an offensive line
can take. By having linemen
block areas instead of specif
ic men, the protection can
