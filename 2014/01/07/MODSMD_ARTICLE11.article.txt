## 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 9 Stanford women's gymnastics team
started off its 2014 season with a bang, taking
first place at the five-team NorCal Meet in
Sacramento on Sunday.
Stanford edged out No. 22 Cal, the only other
ranked team in the meet, 194.825 to 194.650, with
Sacramento State, UC-Davis and San Jose State
trailing from third to fifth respectively.
The Cardinal had 13 team members compete
in the event, with only sophomore Taylor Rice at
tempting all four events.
The key event for the Cardinal was the un
even parallel bars. On the bars, Stanford scored
a 49.050 the best score in the meet and .375
clear of Cal, which more than accounted for the
final score difference propelled by a first
place finish from senior Kristina Yaculik and a
second-place finish from freshman Nicolette Mc-
Nair. Freshman Danielle McNair, senior Shona
Morgan and junior Samantha Shapiro all fin
ished in a tie for seventh with a score of 9.775 to
finish out the scoring for the Cardinal.

Stanford also had a meet-high score of 48.875
in vault. Freshman Sophia Lee and sophomore
Melissa Chuang tied for first with Serena Leong
of Cal to lead the Stanford charge. Freshman
Rachel Daum also grabbed a top-five finish while
Rice and Nicolette McNair tied for 10th.
The young Cardinal team will look to build off
its first-place finish as the competition heats up
in the weeks to come. Stanford will host four
teams currently ranked in the top 25 during the
regular season, starting with tough matchups
during the next two weeks.
Stanford hosts No. 8 Georgia this Sunday in
the Card's season opener, which will provide an
opportunity for the standout underclassmen to
show how they can perform under the pressure
of stiff competition. The following Sunday, Stan
ford will host another tough meet when No. 17
Arizona and Sacramento State come to the
Farm.
The dual meet between Stanford and Georgia
is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. on Sunday at
Burnham Pavilion.
