## Volleyball earns big upset win Card topples No. 2 UCLA to finish tourney 
### ELIZA THOMPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball journeyed to
Southern California this past weekend,
opening the 2014 season at the 50th ASICS
Tournament at UC-Santa Barbara. The
Cardinal, ranked No. 5 nationally in the
preseason polls, went 2-3 in its five match
es during the two-day tournament, includ
ing an impressive come-from-behind win
against No. 2 UCLA in the Cardinal's only
official match.
Stanford faced Harvard in its first
match, losing 29-27, 25-20. The Card
played Pacific next, winning in two sets.
While both sets were close, Stanford
seemed in control of its lead throughout
each frame and played with confidence all
match long. Stanford went on to play both
Cal Baptist and UCSB, losing to both in
three sets. The Cardinal lost the first set to
Cal Baptist but rallied to win
the second set, before losing
the match in the third set 15-
12. The matchup against the
Gauchos was a similar story:
Stanford lost the first set,
won the second 26-24, but let
UCSB pull out to an early
lead in the third and final
set, ultimately falling short.
The highlight of Stan
ford's tournament came on
Saturday when it downed No.
2 UCLA, recording its sec
ond victory of the tourna
ment. After losing the first
set 25-22, the Cardinal
turned up the heat against
the Bruins. Stanford quickly
scored against UCLA in the
second set, jumping out to a

15-9 advantage and forcing
UCLA to call a timeout. Stan
ford went on to win the sec
ond frame 25-18, evening the
match at one apiece. John
Kosty's squad prevailed
again in set three 25-18 and
set four 25-22, winning the
match the key to the victo
ry was consistent play and a
strong offensive perform
ance. Furthermore, Stanford
was able to maintain its lead
throughout each set.
Stanford hit .433 for the

match and had four players
with double-digit kills. Sen
ior outside hitters Brian
Cook and Steven Irvin led
the match on offense, with
16 and 14 kills, respectively.
Sophomore middle Conrad
Kaminski had a very strong
performance as well with a
team-high .769 attack per
centage and five blocks.
Sophomore setter James
Shaw also demonstrated his
consistency and offensive
skill, notching 53 assists.

The victory over the Bru
ins was the first official
match for both squads, giv
ing Stanford a 1-0 record to
begin the 2014 campaign.
Stanford's home opener is
this Friday at Maples Pavil
ion against No. 10 Lewis
University, and the Cardinal
will conclude its weekend
homestand with Grand
Canyon on Saturday at 7 p.m.
