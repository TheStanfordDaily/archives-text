## Cardinal wins on last event Lee clutch in close victory at No. 8 Texas 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 Cardinal women's swimming
team started off the new year with a dra
matic flourish, using a strong performance
in its final relay to win a nail-biting dual
meet over No. 8 Texas, 154-146.

Saturday's victory in Austin demon
strated that the team had effectively uti
lized winter training over the break, as the
Cardinal now remains undefeated in early
season dual-meet action.
"It was fun to race a strong Texas team
today," head coach Greg Meehan told
GoStanford.com after the meet. "Coming
off our training camp, we didn't get out to
a good start through the front half of the
meet, but we rebounded really well. Meets
in early January are more about toughness
than going fast, and I thought both teams
worked through that today."
