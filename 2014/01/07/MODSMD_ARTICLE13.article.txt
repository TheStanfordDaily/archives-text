## Cardinal wins on last event Lee clutch in close victory at No. 8 Texas 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 Cardinal women's swimming
team started off the new year with a dra
matic flourish, using a strong performance
in its final relay to win a nail-biting dual
meet over No. 8 Texas, 154-146.

Saturday's victory in Austin demon
strated that the team had effectively uti
lized winter training over the break, as the
Cardinal now remains undefeated in early
season dual-meet action.
"It was fun to race a strong Texas team
today," head coach Greg Meehan told
GoStanford.com after the meet. "Coming
off our training camp, we didn't get out to
a good start through the front half of the
meet, but we rebounded really well. Meets
in early January are more about toughness
than going fast, and I thought both teams
worked through that today."

TEXAS 146
1! A, Austin, Texas
It was the second consec
utive year in which the dual
meet between Stanford and
Texas came down to the final
relay. In last year's matchup
between the two swimming
powers, the Longhorns used
a late push to come out on
top as they eked out a three
point victory.
This year, however, the
Cardinal's 400-yard freestyle
relay quartet—junior Mad
dy Schaefer, senior Felicia
Lee, sophomore Julia Ander
son and freshman Lia Neal
—ensured that Stanford
would be the team going
home happy.
Because the Cardinal
held a three-point edge going
into the final relay, the 11
points awarded to the win
ning team would have been
enough to clinch the meet for
either squad, with the six
combined points for second
place and third-place finishes
being irrelevant as to decid
ing the victor of the meet.
Lee, the Pac-12 swimmer
of the month for November,
led Stanford to a comfortable
victory in the relay with her
impressive 48.74 split to beat
the "A" squad from Texas by
over two seconds. Lee con
tinued her strong start to the
season with two comfortable

individual victories in the
100-yard backstroke, 100-
yard butterfly and two relay
winning efforts.
Senior Maya Dißado,
who gave way to Anderson
in the meet-clinching relay,
ensured that her presence
would be felt in her other
events, claiming victories in
all three of the individual
events in which she partici
pated— the 200-yard but
terfly, the 200-yard back
stroke and the 200-yard indi
vidual medley.
Those individual victories
were key, as the Cardinal
needed all 10 of its victories
out of the 16 events in the
meet to squeak past the
Longhorns. This was largely
due to the fact that Stanford
failed to place in several of the
events that it lost Texas
took 1-2-3 finishes in the 200-
yard freestyle, 1-meter diving
and 3-meter diving events.
However, a first-place
finish from freshman Lia
Neal in the 100-yard
freestyle and a pair of solid
victories from senior Andie
Taylor in the distance events
the 500-yard freestyle
and 1000-yard freestyle
ensured that the early Car
dinal lead stood as the meet
progressed. Aside from brief
Longhorn advantages after
Stanford's weak showings in
both the diving events, the
Cardinal ultimately ensured
that those Texas leads were
short lived.

The Cardinal will now
train for three more weeks
before it hosts Arizona and
Arizona State at Avery
Aquatic Center on Jan. 24
and Jan. 25.

stroke and the 200-yard indi
vidual medley.
Those individual victories
were key, as the Cardinal
needed all 10 of its victories
out of the 16 events in the
meet to squeak past the
Longhorns. This was largely
due to the fact that Stanford
failed to place in several of the
events that it lost Texas
took 1-2-3 finishes in the 200-
yard freestyle, 1-meter diving
and 3-meter diving events.
However, a first-place
finish from freshman Lia
Neal in the 100-yard
freestyle and a pair of solid
victories from senior Andie
Taylor in the distance events
the 500-yard freestyle
and 1000-yard freestyle
ensured that the early Car
dinal lead stood as the meet
progressed. Aside from brief
Longhorn advantages after
Stanford's weak showings in
both the diving events, the
Cardinal ultimately ensured
that those Texas leads were
short lived.

The Cardinal will now
train for three more weeks
before it hosts Arizona and
Arizona State at Avery
Aquatic Center on Jan. 24
and Jan. 25.

Senior Felicia Lee (above) was key to Stanford's win over Texas, winning two individual and two relay events. The New
Jersey native was part of the Cardinal 400-freestyle relay victory, which sealed the narrow eight-point Stanford victory.
