## OP-ED Locked into Bitcoin 
### Raven Jiang â€“ Raven Jiang '15 
A huge part of the appeal of
Bitcoin is its promise of being
decentralized yet secure, but
what happens when the system re
quires fundamental adjustments?
In traditional monetary sys
tems, a credible government is nec
essary to guarantee the value of fiat
currency. Across the political spec
trum, from the anti-establishment
online movements to more tradi
tional libertarians, there are groups
of people who believe that the cen
tral authority represents a single
point of failure in the economy, al
lowing corrupt or incompetent gov
ernments to devalue existing mon
ey to the detriment of the people.
The dramatic rise in the price of
gold over the past decade can be
partly attributed to this desire for a
non-inflationary currency. As for
mer Congressman Ron Paul puts it,
"Gold is the ultimate money."
With Bitcoin, we seem to have fi
nally discovered digital gold. Like
gold, the supply is finite and not
subjected to intentional increases
by political entities. The amount of
gold is presently limited by the
Earth's composition while the num
ber of bitcoins is bounded mathe
matically to 21 million. Therefore
bitcoins and gold are both naturally
deflationary their values tend to
increase over time. The inventor of
Bitcoin even used the term "min
ing" to describe the process in
which new coins are computed. Un
like gold, Bitcoin is vastly more
functional as a currency. The peer
to-peer network handling Bitcoin
transactions allows fast, pseudony
mous, and cryptographically veri
fied payments all without the in
volvement of any monetary author
ities. Bitcoins do not require trust
in traditional institutions, but mere
ly trust in the open source mathe
matical algorithms.
So is this the freedom that cy
berlibertarians have long fanta
sized about? If we are merely talk
ing about freedom from govern
mental control, then the answer is
yes, eventually. While governments
presently exert control over Bitcoin
by targeting exchanges and physi
cal infrastructures that power Bit
coin, these leverages diminish over
time as the economy becomes more
self-contained. If people outgrow
the constant need to convert BTC
into USD and anonymization of Bit
coin transactions become routine,
then it seems inevitable that moni
toring financial transactions will be
come increasingly impractical for
governments. Forget fiscal policies
and taxation the government
needs to first prove that your
wealth exists. That may well be the
libertarian idea of paradise.
But is that really freedom? Or
are we are simply the subjects of a
new, subtler master? Instead of a
flawed, but democratic govern
ment, we place our trust in an algo
rithm from an anonymous creator
the same individual whom some
believe owns 4.7 percent of all Bit
coins that will ever exist.
In the peer-to-peer transaction
network, the rules of Bitcoin are en
forced purely by majority consen
sus of the nodes. No one has any re
al idea what the hard limit and the
designed deflation would mean for a
significantly sized economy, or how
the extreme inequality in accumu
lated Bitcoin wealth would serve to
influence and perhaps distort socie-

ty, especially since these pockets of
wealth can never be overcome due
to the hard cap. Within the Bitcoin
community, the canned response to
questions about the hard limit is
that each Bitcoin is divisible down
to eight decimal places and there
fore there will be more than enough
units of currency to go around. The
fallacy in this line of thinking is ob
vious when we look at legacy prob
lems such as the exhaustion of IPv4
addresses.
A separate but related problem
is that of lost bitcoins. Due to en
cryption, it is not hard for individu
als to irreversibly lose access to
their bitcoins by accident. There
are many precautions one can take
in backing up encryption keys, but
humans errors will always exist.
Since the encryption used to pro
tect the wallet is impervious to
cracking (or there would be far
greater problems at hand), these
coins are lost forever. Therefore,
the final number of Bitcoins is not
just capped at 21 million but ever
decreasing, placing yet another lim
it on the flexibility of Bitcoin as a
global currency.
If Bitcoin truly intends to go
mainstream, it must look to address
these issues in the long term. How
ever, the decentralized design
makes it nigh impossible for anyone
to make adjustments to the under
lying system. Yet if Bitcoin is to be
come more than just a temporary
asset bubble, there are numerous
conceivable systemic changes that
may be required as scalability lim
its of the system are tested by
growing demands. For such
changes to be successfully imple
mented, some form of committee or
central authority must emerge to
fulfil that role.
There have been limited at
tempts at this in the form of Bitcoin
Improvement Proposals (BIP).
Suggested changes to the network
are put into mining clients as BIPs,
allowing individual miners to vote in
favor of or against the proposal as
part of the mining process. The
problem with BIPs is that they are
never adopted in practice because
any protocol change requires more
than 51 percent of the miners in the
network to vote positively as a
technical and not merely procedur
al necessity. Think about how hard
it is to get bills passed in Congress
and combine that with the low vot
ing turnout of most modern democ
racies. That is no way to run an
economy.
If it proves to be technically in
feasible for a credible and potent
Bitcoin authority to emerge, then
investors and their wealth may ulti
mately be locked into the unchang
ing algorithm. Let us hope that
Satoshi Nakamoto, unlike the cre
ators of the Internet Protocol, got it
right the first time.
