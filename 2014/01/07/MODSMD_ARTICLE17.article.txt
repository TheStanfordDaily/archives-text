## Confronting Socioeconomic Class 
### McKenzie Andrews 
//-TT T"hat do you think is
l/l / most difficult to talk
V V about at Stanford?
Race, sexuality, or socioeconomic
class?"
My friend asked me this around
midnight while her roommate was
wrapped in a Snuggie watching lec
tures on her laptop, and I was try
ing to understand confidence inter
vals for homework.
Tired from the p-set onslaught,
I thought for a second before reply
ing, "Socioeconomic class. It's the
most hidden of the three, so I think
it's hardest to talk about. Race is
usually pretty apparent, and sexu
ality generally comes out if you're
friends with somebody."
Socioeconomic class shapes the
way someone grows up, and there
are extremes on both ends at Stan
ford. I've met a friend whose dad is
the CEO of a Fortune 500 company,
and a friend whose dad immigrated
to the U.S. and works at Safeway.

According to an article in The
Stanford Progressive, almost half
of Stanford's students come from
families making more than
$300,000 a year. There's also a
slosh of students who come from
upper-middle-class backgrounds
with doctor/lawyer/professor/engi
neer parents.
Last year, I was fortunate
enough to go on an Alternative
Spring Break trip. Each night of
our trip, we'd feature someone on
"Spotlight," a bonding exercise
where a person sits and tells his or
her life story. The group listens,
and then asks questions, and people
are generally left with the warm
feeling that comes from getting to
know someone a little better.
During our week, the variety in
people's background was highlight
ed. One spotlight story contained
stories of a parent being one of the
first employees at Microsoft then a
childhood growing up in Mexico,
Canada, and France, leaving said
individual trilingual; another story
featured someone overcoming
homelessness in New York with a
mom who makes less per hour than
her daughter's on-campus job pays.
My impression of socioeconomic
class is this: It completely affects
people's life experiences. It can be
embarrassing to talk about, be
cause it's not going to be the same
for everyone. Its distribution is
based on luck. If you're gay or
black today it's easy to argue that
the world shouldn't treat you dif
ferently and we've had civil rights
movements that fight for this sort
of equality. That isn't the case with
socioeconomic class.
When I started to write this ar
ticle, I asked several friends
whether they thought socioeconom
ic class was hard to talk about at
Stanford.
Every friend said yes. "Most
people come from fairly homoge
neous backgrounds, and there's a
fair amount of political and social
apathy, so people don't want to dis
cuss class. That's not what they
care most about, and they're not
forced to face it, because Stanford
is, again, pretty homogeneous."
One friend from a socioeconomi
cally disadvantaged background
replied, "Despite the fact that Stan
ford tries to create an environment
of equal opportunity both in and out
of classroom settings and does a

pretty good job, in my opinion
socioeconomic status is still pretty
hard to ignore for less wealthy stu
dents when they see their wealthier
friends posting statuses about their
excursions abroad for vacation,
spontaneous purchases of tickets to
the World Cup, and other similarly
expensive events. It's easy for the
less well-off to feel a bit insecure,
and frankly feel like they have less
to contribute to the conversation
because they feel less knowledge
able about the world than their
richer peers, and are afraid that
their richer peers will think so too."
One friend stated, "The only
thing open-minded people with dif
ferent backgrounds can do is ac
cept. And if that's the best possible
outcome out of a conversation
about class, how do you progress to
narrow that gap? Plus, there's a
huge barrier to enter into that kind
of conversation, because it's easy to
overlook the other side of the spec
trum if you tend to flock towards
people of a similar background."
When everyone in your dorm
lives in a one-room double, it's easy
to think there's no difference be
tween how individuals experience
Stanford. Coming to an elite uni
versity opens doors to big places.
At Stanford, wealth appears to be
the norm, and this fagade can leave
students feeling isolated. We need
to work to create safe spaces
where students can learn from one
another, and respect the variety of
backgrounds we have on our cam
pus. Though I feel seeped in the ig
norance of my single life experi
ence, these issues are worth con
templating. Let's talk to build a
more open, understanding Stan
ford community.
