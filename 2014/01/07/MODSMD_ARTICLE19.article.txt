### â€“ Do-Hyoung Park 
The college football coaching experts at
Football Scoop announced on Monday that
Stanford offensive coordinator Mike Bloom
gren has earned the honor of offensive line
coach of the year for the 2013 season.
Under Bloomgren's coaching, the Cardinal
offensive line featured a unanimous All-Amer
ican selection in senior left guard David
Yankey and three AU-Pac-12 second team se
lections in senior tackle Cameron Fleming,
sophomore tackle Andrus Peat and fifth-year
senior center Khalil Wilkes.
The line proved to be disciplined and ready
for critical situations throughout the entire sea
son, finishing the regular season with only two
holding penalties and playing a key role in Stan
ford's third-down conversion rate of 49.75 per
cent, good for tenth in the nation. It also played
a key role in the victory over Oregon as the
Cardinal used an overwhelming advantage on
the lines to possess the ball for over 42 minutes.
Bloomgren joins strength coach Shannon
Turley, defensive line coach Randy Hart and
director of football operations Matt Doyle as
Stanford personnel recently awarded honors
by Football Scoop.
