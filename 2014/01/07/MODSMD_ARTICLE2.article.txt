# Dorm, sweet dorm
## Rising housing costs lead to growing number of RFs with children 
### JAMIE HELYAR 
It was a typical Friday night in Serra.
Loud rap music blasted from somewhere
down the hall of the Stanford freshman
dorm. Next to the trash can, empty pizza
boxes were piled up next to empty beer
bottles.
But inside suite 201, Adam Berkel
hamer and Michelle Reininger M.A. 'O4
Ph.D. 'O7 unpacked bottles of a different
kind: baby bottles.
The couple is serving in their second
year as the dorm's resident fellows (RFs)
live-in faculty members in charge of

the dorm. Living with their first child,
one-month-old Noll Eliot Berkelhamer,
the couple admitted that at times, they
have wondered if they might be in over
then- heads.
"Our friends think we're crazy,"
Reininger said, with a laugh.
But taking into account the pressure
of the high cost of living for middle class
faculty families in contrast with the
benefits of living expense-free on campus
and suddenly, Reininger and Berkel
hamer don't seem so crazy for choosing
to raise their child in a freshman dorm.
In fact, Reininger and Berkelhamer

are part of a growing trend.
The RF application process has be
come increasingly competitive in the last
five years according to Deborah Golder,
dean of Residential Education. These ap
plicants have a few things in common
for one, their minivans.
Golder added that RFs appointed in
2013 alone raised the total number of RF
children from 60 to 70. Reininger and
Berkelhamer's son born in December
makes 71.

When Adam Berkelhamer and Michelle Reininger M.A.
'04 Ph.D. '07 found out they were expecting a child, they
applied to become RFs due to costly Palo Alto housing.
