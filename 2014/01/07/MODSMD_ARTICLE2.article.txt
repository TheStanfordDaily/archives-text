# Dorm, sweet dorm
## Rising housing costs lead to growing number of RFs with children 
### JAMIE HELYAR 
It was a typical Friday night in Serra.
Loud rap music blasted from somewhere
down the hall of the Stanford freshman
dorm. Next to the trash can, empty pizza
boxes were piled up next to empty beer
bottles.
But inside suite 201, Adam Berkel
hamer and Michelle Reininger M.A. 'O4
Ph.D. 'O7 unpacked bottles of a different
kind: baby bottles.
The couple is serving in their second
year as the dorm's resident fellows (RFs)
live-in faculty members in charge of

the dorm. Living with their first child,
one-month-old Noll Eliot Berkelhamer,
the couple admitted that at times, they
have wondered if they might be in over
then- heads.
"Our friends think we're crazy,"
Reininger said, with a laugh.
But taking into account the pressure
of the high cost of living for middle class
faculty families in contrast with the
benefits of living expense-free on campus
and suddenly, Reininger and Berkel
hamer don't seem so crazy for choosing
to raise their child in a freshman dorm.
In fact, Reininger and Berkelhamer

are part of a growing trend.
The RF application process has be
come increasingly competitive in the last
five years according to Deborah Golder,
dean of Residential Education. These ap
plicants have a few things in common
for one, their minivans.
Golder added that RFs appointed in
2013 alone raised the total number of RF
children from 60 to 70. Reininger and
Berkelhamer's son born in December
makes 71.

graphics families with
young kids as beneficial to
both RF parents and the
University.
RFs are guaranteed free
rent, free dining, full utility
coverage, daycare and access
to the Palo Alto public school
system, not to mention the
money saved by avoiding
long commutes made by fac
ulty living in surrounding ar
eas like Mountain View, Men
lo Park or Redwood City.
"The irony is, this is ab
solutely the cheapest we
could be living light now, in
the most expensive part of
the world," Berkelhamer
said.
For Reininger and
Berkelhamer, the decision to
become RFs was more a last
resort than a master plan.
After Reininger learned
she was pregnant, the couple
decided to move closer to
campus, turning to faculty
housing considering the high
prices of the local market.
The San Francisco Chron
icle projected a 2013 Palo Al
to housing appreciation rate
of 12 percent and not every
one can pay the price.
Faculty members aren't
guaranteed housing. And of
ten, newly tenured faculty in
the middle class bracket, like
Reininger and Berkelhamer,
are outbid.
Then the couple learned
about the RF position.
"We were in panic mode,
and we're like, 'We're preg
nant. Let's do it,"' Reininger
said.
Berkelhamer admitted
that as a parent, he had
reservations about the posi
tion at first.
The babies of RFs are ex
posed to more pathogens
than most, and loud college
students can easily wake up
sleeping newborn infants
(and their parents). Em
manuel Assa 'l7, a student
living in Serra, admitted he
was skeptical about sharing
his dorm with a toddler.
"He might overhear

things from students that his
parents don't want him to
hear," Assa said.
Toyon Hall RF Marie-
Louise Catsalis, the mother
of two young boys, said she
worries more about the over
exposure in her son's teenage
years. Yet she recognizes
some positive influence from
such early exposure. For in
stance, her son Tobin, who is
disgusted by underage
drinking, serves as the dor
m's unofficial "alcohol moni
tor."
"He knows that alcohol
can hurt your brain, and
make you act strange," Cat
salis said.
Catsalis also spoke of oth
er benefits to raising her sons
around Stanford students.
"Being around smart stu
dents, [the children] think
earlier about the different
things they can be when they
grow up," Catsalis said.
There are other more tan
gible future benefits for RFs'
children as well. With the
University covering their
cost of living, RFs are free to
save for their futures. That
means more money for col
lege funds, insurance cover
age and better housing.
Golder observed that with
the money saved, some RFs
have reportedly found them
selves better positioned to
become homeowners in the
area.
However, RFs like Cat
salis and her husband still
count their 1,200-square-foot
apartments and untradi
tional lifestyles among the
sacrifices they must make in
order to raise kids on faculty
paychecks in Palo Alto.
Back in Reininger and
Berkelhamer's own 1,200
square-foot apartment, space
is tight and compromises
have been made.
But on the changing table
in the nursery, Reininger and
Berkelhamer unrolled a
sprawling banner, filled with
congratulations and signed
by all 86 students in Serra,
and insist this community
has only made the trade-offs
more worthwhile.

the middle class bracket, like
Reininger and Berkelhamer,
are outbid.
Then the couple learned
about the RF position.
"We were in panic mode,
and we're like, 'We're preg
nant. Let's do it,"' Reininger
said.
Berkelhamer admitted
that as a parent, he had
reservations about the posi
tion at first.
The babies of RFs are ex
posed to more pathogens
than most, and loud college
students can easily wake up
sleeping newborn infants
(and their parents). Em
manuel Assa 'l7, a student
living in Serra, admitted he
was skeptical about sharing
his dorm with a toddler.
"He might overhear

things from students that his
parents don't want him to
hear," Assa said.
Toyon Hall RF Marie-
Louise Catsalis, the mother
of two young boys, said she
worries more about the over
exposure in her son's teenage
years. Yet she recognizes
some positive influence from
such early exposure. For in
stance, her son Tobin, who is
disgusted by underage
drinking, serves as the dor
m's unofficial "alcohol moni
tor."
"He knows that alcohol
can hurt your brain, and
make you act strange," Cat
salis said.
Catsalis also spoke of oth
er benefits to raising her sons
around Stanford students.
"Being around smart stu
dents, [the children] think
earlier about the different
things they can be when they
grow up," Catsalis said.
There are other more tan
gible future benefits for RFs'
children as well. With the
University covering their
cost of living, RFs are free to
save for their futures. That
means more money for col
lege funds, insurance cover
age and better housing.
Golder observed that with
the money saved, some RFs
have reportedly found them
selves better positioned to
become homeowners in the
area.
However, RFs like Cat
salis and her husband still
count their 1,200-square-foot
apartments and untradi
tional lifestyles among the
sacrifices they must make in
order to raise kids on faculty
paychecks in Palo Alto.
Back in Reininger and
Berkelhamer's own 1,200
square-foot apartment, space
is tight and compromises
have been made.
But on the changing table
in the nursery, Reininger and
Berkelhamer unrolled a
sprawling banner, filled with
congratulations and signed
by all 86 students in Serra,
and insist this community
has only made the trade-offs
more worthwhile.

It was a typical Friday night in Serra.
Loud rap music blasted from somewhere
down the hall of the Stanford freshman
dorm. Next to the trash can, empty pizza
boxes were piled up next to empty beer
bottles.
But inside suite 201, Adam Berkel
hamer and Michelle Reininger M.A. 'O4
Ph.D. 'O7 unpacked bottles of a different
kind: baby bottles.
The couple is serving in their second
year as the dorm's resident fellows (RFs)
live-in faculty members in charge of

the dorm. Living with their first child,
one-month-old Noll Eliot Berkelhamer,
the couple admitted that at times, they
have wondered if they might be in over
then- heads.
"Our friends think we're crazy,"
Reininger said, with a laugh.
But taking into account the pressure
of the high cost of living for middle class
faculty families in contrast with the
benefits of living expense-free on campus
and suddenly, Reininger and Berkel
hamer don't seem so crazy for choosing
to raise their child in a freshman dorm.
In fact, Reininger and Berkelhamer

are part of a growing trend.
The RF application process has be
come increasingly competitive in the last
five years according to Deborah Golder,
dean of Residential Education. These ap
plicants have a few things in common
for one, their minivans.
Golder added that RFs appointed in
2013 alone raised the total number of RF
children from 60 to 70. Reininger and
Berkelhamer's son born in December
makes 71.

RFs are guaranteed free

"The irony is, this is ab
solutely the cheapest we
could be living light now, in
the most expensive part of
the world," Berkelhamer
said.
For Reininger and
Berkelhamer, the decision to
become RFs was more a last
resort than a master plan.
After Reininger learned
she was pregnant, the couple
decided to move closer to

housing considering the high
