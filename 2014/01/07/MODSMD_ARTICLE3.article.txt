# STARTUP SWAGGER
## THE 						RISE OF STANFORD'S STARTUP CULTURE 
### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
The image of Stanford as a place
for technological innovation and
student-led ventures only recent
ly grew to be pervasive on and off
campus.
Venture capital and private equity firms
weren't always clustered on Sand Hill Road,
right off campus.
When Hennessy's MIPS Technologies
a company known for revolutionizing Re
duced Instruction Set Computing chips,
through a new type of instruction set was
founded in 1984 based on graduate students'
research, Hennessy explained how there

wasn't a well-established venture community
in the area.
He added that while the company's
founding team knew their technology, they
weren't as fluent with entrepreneurial con
cerns, including how to raise money or how
to make a valuation a shift from the tech
nological, innovative and entrepreneurial
landscape today.
"The average student now doing some
thing entrepreneurial at Stanford knows 10
times as much," Hennessy said.

The start of entrepreneurship culture
Through the '7os there were not a lot of
startups formed, Hennessy said. But within
the span of four or five years in the early
1980s, technological advances fueled a burst

of action including the founding of companies
such as Cisco, Sun, Silicon Graphics, and
MIPS Technologies.
When the dot-com bubble burst hap
pened in the late '9os, companies in Silicon
Valley took a hard hit many companies
that didn't solve core problems went out of
business, explained Mark Goldenson 'Ol,
founder and CEO of Breakthrough, a compa
ny that provides affordable online mental
health care.
"I think what made [some companies] dif
ferent was the fact that some of them were
offering critical consumer services, like sell
ing items online, or the ability to search the
web better," he said.

At a recent career fair, Olivia Wu '16 received plenty of free T-shirts and swag from Silicon Valley startup companies. This has
become an increasingly common sight as Stanford has grown into a hub for technological innovation and entrepreneurial education.
Hennessy explained that
in the 'Bos and early part of
the '9os, more than half of
the companies founded by
Stanford affiliates were prof
itable.
"Maybe not all of them
had a giant IPO, but they
had some kind of an exit
that repaid the investors
and gave some value back to
the shareholders," he
added.
With emerging technolo
gies, Silicon Valley started
embracing more entrepre
neurial leaders to keep up
with the rapid speeds at
which companies launched.
At the same time, Stanford
ramped up efforts to pre
pare its students for the
shifting landscape that led
to the abundant resources
available today.
Cultivating the new genera
tion of leaders
Konstantine Buhler 'l4,
Mayfield Fellow recipient
and a member of the Stan
ford Technology Ventures
Program (STVP), explained
that the resources at Stan
ford for innovation and en
trepreneurship are unparal
leled.
"It's why I came to Stan
ford the entrepreneurial
spirit that is everywhere on
campus was very attractive
to me," Buhler said.
The Mayfield Fellowship
is one of the many initiatives
at Stanford promoting en
trepreneurship and innova
tion. Founded in 1996 at
Stanford, the Mayfield Fel

lows program was expanded
to include students at UC-
Berkeley in 2001. The pro
gram is a nine-month pro
gram, limited to a dozen un
dergraduate or coterminal
Stanford students who go
through an intense se
quence of courses on the
management of technology
ventures, numerous men
toring and networking ac
tivities and a paid intern
ship at a startup company.
Buhler explained that
STVP was one of the many
new programs that made
Stanford a unique place for
innovation. Hosted in the
Department of Manage
ment Science and Engineer
ing, STVP is aimed at high
tech entrepreneurship edu
cation and research in tech
nology.
Another übiquitous
Stanford-connected pro
gram is StartX, started by
Cameron Teitelman 'lO in
2009. In 2010, it launched as
SSE Labs, a division of Stan
ford Student Enterprises,
and then became an inde
pendent entity in 2011.
Unlike many other simi
lar programs, StartX takes
no fees or equity in the com
panies it works with.
StartX's unique features in
clude resources like office
space and legal services, and
a community for mentorship
from entrepreneurs.
StartX's ties with Stan
ford have only strengthened
despite it being an independ
ent organization. For in
stance, Stanford University
and Stanford Hospital &
Clinics pledged $3.6 million
over three years in grant
funding for StartX.
Teitelman explained that
his experiences in the entre

preneurial space at Stanford
significantly shaped the vi
sion for StartX, including his
participation in Alpha Kappa
Psi, the business-themed
fraternity.
"At Stanford, there is a
lot of experiential education
that happens," Teitelman
said.
He explained that one of
his learning experiences was
the pledging process for
AKPsi.
"We had to build busi
nesses. We had to plan a
startup, we had to do sales
door to door," he said. "It
was really good to get over a
lot of those emotional and
psychological hurdles you
have when you're starting
out of school."
"By forcing you to do it in
a safe environment, you get
over the biggest hurdles at
tached to starting a compa
ny, like taking a leap to do it
and taking those risky deci
sions," Teitelman added.
Apart from student-di
rected programs, many fac
ulty and researchers at
Stanford have also been re
sponsible for breakthrough
technologies and ideas, in
cluding Andrew Ng, associ
ate professor of computer
science and co-founder of on
line education platform
Coursera.
"I think the highly entre
preneurial ecosystem in Sili
con Valley is an integral part
that is not seen anywhere
else in the United States,"
Ng said. "It's created a uni
versity with amazing faculty
that produces amazing con
tent."
The current culture
Thanks to efforts such as
the recent venture capital

fund for StartX, more Stan
ford startups are being
launched or developed
where students and alumni
can put their education into
practice.
One of the criticisms sur
rounding the growing start
up culture at Stanford, how
ever, is that students are get
ting involved for the profit
opportunities.
Goldenson admitted that
at the height of the then dot
com bubble, many compa
nies with purely lucrative
goals were misguided and
unsuccessful.
Yet he added that they
ended up serving an impor
tant purpose.
"A lot of these companies
tried out ways to enter mar
kets that failed for them, but
ultimately created thought
on new ideas for successful
companies," he said.
Goldenson cited the ex
ample of Webvan, a food-de
livery startup that failed in
2001 but ultimately inspired
many successful new enter
prises, from Google's local
delivery service to food de
livery services like Flue and
Doordash.
Buhler echoed similar
sentiments. He explained
that while the barriers to en
try for being an entrepre
neur is low, people should al
so put [a lot of] thought when
they make decisions about
entrepreneurship.
"Generally I would say
that it's not a great idea to be
an entrepreneur just for the
sake of it," Buhler said. "You
should be passionate about it
and passionate about solving
problems a certain way."

through a new type of instruction set was
founded in 1984 based on graduate students'
research, Hennessy explained how there

wasn't a well-established venture community
in the area.
He added that while the company's
founding team knew their technology, they
weren't as fluent with entrepreneurial con
cerns, including how to raise money or how
to make a valuation a shift from the tech
nological, innovative and entrepreneurial
landscape today.
"The average student now doing some
thing entrepreneurial at Stanford knows 10
times as much," Hennessy said.

The start of entrepreneurship culture
Through the '7os there were not a lot of
startups formed, Hennessy said. But within
the span of four or five years in the early
1980s, technological advances fueled a burst

of action including the founding of companies
such as Cisco, Sun, Silicon Graphics, and
MIPS Technologies.
When the dot-com bubble burst hap
pened in the late '9os, companies in Silicon
Valley took a hard hit many companies
that didn't solve core problems went out of
business, explained Mark Goldenson 'Ol,
founder and CEO of Breakthrough, a compa
ny that provides affordable online mental
health care.
"I think what made [some companies] dif
ferent was the fact that some of them were
offering critical consumer services, like sell
ing items online, or the ability to search the
web better," he said.

At a recent career fair, Olivia Wu '16 received plenty of free T-shirts and swag from Silicon Valley startup companies. This has
become an increasingly common sight as Stanford has grown into a hub for technological innovation and entrepreneurial education.
Hennessy explained that
in the 'Bos and early part of
the '9os, more than half of
the companies founded by
Stanford affiliates were prof
itable.
"Maybe not all of them
had a giant IPO, but they
had some kind of an exit
that repaid the investors
and gave some value back to
the shareholders," he
added.
With emerging technolo
gies, Silicon Valley started
embracing more entrepre
neurial leaders to keep up
with the rapid speeds at
which companies launched.
At the same time, Stanford
ramped up efforts to pre
pare its students for the
shifting landscape that led
to the abundant resources
available today.
Cultivating the new genera
tion of leaders
Konstantine Buhler 'l4,
Mayfield Fellow recipient
and a member of the Stan
ford Technology Ventures
Program (STVP), explained
that the resources at Stan
ford for innovation and en
trepreneurship are unparal
leled.
"It's why I came to Stan
ford the entrepreneurial
spirit that is everywhere on
campus was very attractive
to me," Buhler said.
The Mayfield Fellowship
is one of the many initiatives
at Stanford promoting en
trepreneurship and innova
tion. Founded in 1996 at
Stanford, the Mayfield Fel

lows program was expanded
to include students at UC-
Berkeley in 2001. The pro
gram is a nine-month pro
gram, limited to a dozen un
dergraduate or coterminal
Stanford students who go
through an intense se
quence of courses on the
management of technology
ventures, numerous men
toring and networking ac
tivities and a paid intern
ship at a startup company.
Buhler explained that
STVP was one of the many
new programs that made
Stanford a unique place for
innovation. Hosted in the
Department of Manage
ment Science and Engineer
ing, STVP is aimed at high
tech entrepreneurship edu
cation and research in tech
nology.
Another übiquitous
Stanford-connected pro
gram is StartX, started by
Cameron Teitelman 'lO in
2009. In 2010, it launched as
SSE Labs, a division of Stan
ford Student Enterprises,
and then became an inde
pendent entity in 2011.
Unlike many other simi
lar programs, StartX takes
no fees or equity in the com
panies it works with.
StartX's unique features in
clude resources like office
space and legal services, and
a community for mentorship
from entrepreneurs.
StartX's ties with Stan
ford have only strengthened
despite it being an independ
ent organization. For in
stance, Stanford University
and Stanford Hospital &
Clinics pledged $3.6 million
over three years in grant
funding for StartX.
Teitelman explained that
his experiences in the entre

preneurial space at Stanford
significantly shaped the vi
sion for StartX, including his
participation in Alpha Kappa
Psi, the business-themed
fraternity.
"At Stanford, there is a
lot of experiential education
that happens," Teitelman
said.
He explained that one of
his learning experiences was
the pledging process for
AKPsi.
"We had to build busi
nesses. We had to plan a
startup, we had to do sales
door to door," he said. "It
was really good to get over a
lot of those emotional and
psychological hurdles you
have when you're starting
out of school."
"By forcing you to do it in
a safe environment, you get
over the biggest hurdles at
tached to starting a compa
ny, like taking a leap to do it
and taking those risky deci
sions," Teitelman added.
Apart from student-di
rected programs, many fac
ulty and researchers at
Stanford have also been re
sponsible for breakthrough
technologies and ideas, in
cluding Andrew Ng, associ
ate professor of computer
science and co-founder of on
line education platform
Coursera.
"I think the highly entre
preneurial ecosystem in Sili
con Valley is an integral part
that is not seen anywhere
else in the United States,"
Ng said. "It's created a uni
versity with amazing faculty
that produces amazing con
tent."
The current culture
Thanks to efforts such as
the recent venture capital

fund for StartX, more Stan
ford startups are being
launched or developed
where students and alumni
can put their education into
practice.
One of the criticisms sur
rounding the growing start
up culture at Stanford, how
ever, is that students are get
ting involved for the profit
opportunities.
Goldenson admitted that
at the height of the then dot
com bubble, many compa
nies with purely lucrative
goals were misguided and
unsuccessful.
Yet he added that they
ended up serving an impor
tant purpose.
"A lot of these companies
tried out ways to enter mar
kets that failed for them, but
ultimately created thought
on new ideas for successful
companies," he said.
Goldenson cited the ex
ample of Webvan, a food-de
livery startup that failed in
2001 but ultimately inspired
many successful new enter
prises, from Google's local
delivery service to food de
livery services like Flue and
Doordash.
Buhler echoed similar
sentiments. He explained
that while the barriers to en
try for being an entrepre
neur is low, people should al
so put [a lot of] thought when
they make decisions about
entrepreneurship.
"Generally I would say
that it's not a great idea to be
an entrepreneur just for the
sake of it," Buhler said. "You
should be passionate about it
and passionate about solving
problems a certain way."
