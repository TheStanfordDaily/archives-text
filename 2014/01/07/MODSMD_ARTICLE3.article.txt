# STARTUP SWAGGER
## THE
						RISE OF STANFORD'S STARTUP CULTURE 
### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
The image of Stanford as a place
for technological innovation and
student-led ventures only recent
ly grew to be pervasive on and off
campus.
Venture capital and private equity firms
weren't always clustered on Sand Hill Road,
right off campus.
When Hennessy's MIPS Technologies
a company known for revolutionizing Re
duced Instruction Set Computing chips,
through a new type of instruction set was
founded in 1984 based on graduate students'
research, Hennessy explained how there

wasn't a well-established venture community
in the area.
He added that while the company's
founding team knew their technology, they
weren't as fluent with entrepreneurial con
cerns, including how to raise money or how
to make a valuation a shift from the tech
nological, innovative and entrepreneurial
landscape today.
"The average student now doing some
thing entrepreneurial at Stanford knows 10
times as much," Hennessy said.

The start of entrepreneurship culture
Through the '7os there were not a lot of
startups formed, Hennessy said. But within
the span of four or five years in the early
1980s, technological advances fueled a burst

of action including the founding of companies
such as Cisco, Sun, Silicon Graphics, and
MIPS Technologies.
When the dot-com bubble burst hap
pened in the late '9os, companies in Silicon
Valley took a hard hit many companies
that didn't solve core problems went out of
business, explained Mark Goldenson 'Ol,
founder and CEO of Breakthrough, a compa
ny that provides affordable online mental
health care.
"I think what made [some companies] dif
ferent was the fact that some of them were
offering critical consumer services, like sell
ing items online, or the ability to search the
web better," he said.

At a recent career fair, Olivia Wu '16 received plenty of free T-shirts and swag from Silicon Valley startup companies. This has
become an increasingly common sight as Stanford has grown into a hub for technological innovation and entrepreneurial education.
