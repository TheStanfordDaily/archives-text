# STUDENT GROUPS
## Stanford Dems refocus goals Group to prioritize direct political involvement over speaking events 
### MADELEINE HAN 
The Stanford Democrats are shifting
away from an events-based structure to
wards a campaign-focused model for this
year with the hope of creating opportunities
for direct political involvement.
The student organization was founded
more than a decade ago and has traditional
ly held on-campus events to raise awareness
about the Democratic Party's political
stance. Now, the group is hoping to turn
their sights toward grassroots frontiers.
Plans include additional voter registra
tion drives, a newsletter focusing on major
topics in Washington and an increased focus
on assisting Democratic campaign efforts.
Elections for a slew of new officer positions
such as voter drive and phone bank coor
dinatorsâ€” will accompany the structural
changes made this quarter.
Henock Dory 'l4, president of Stanford

Democrats, said he hopes the changes will
help the group and their mission evolve.
"When there is a big election, there's a
lot of involvement," Dory said. "But after
that, it was just a big question mark. We're
starting to realize that we want to find a
niche."
In the past, the Stanford Democrats
hosted events ranging from a discussion
about the constitutionality of gay marriage
to a panel on the government shutdown.
"There are already organizations on
campus that do a very good job of putting to
gether events," said Natasha Patel 'l6, vice
president of Stanford Democrats. "We're
looking at where the gaps on campus are
and what we could do to provide students
with an opportunity to participate in the po
litical process."
The Stanford Democrats' most recent
peak in political involvement came during
the 2012 presidential election, during which
members were invited to participate in get
out-the-vote efforts.
The organization is planning to keep the
electoral momentum going with efforts to

get stu
dents
in
volved in
statewide and local
campaigns, said events
coordinator Sara Or
ton 'l6. Dory added
that the Stanford De
mocrats are also
looking to solidify
connections with local
alumni.
Patel said she hopes the
structural changes will encourage students
to apply their abilities to the political
process as well as learn new skills.
"I think there's this general lack of the
sentiment that the government is a place
where we can solve problems, and a force for
good," Patel said. "Stanford students like to
think about how they can solve problems
through the private sphere, and less of how
they could potentially solve problems

through the public sphere."
"Most of the major proj
ects that I think our country
has been able to provide its
citizens with are projects
that require the mechanisms
of government," she added.
Dory also sees a greater
need for general political

awareness on campus.
"A lot of the time, espe
cially at Stanford, it's hard
to see how those decisions
are going to be affecting
you," Dory said. "But I
think we all have a duty... to
force in a bit of time to learn
about the people who are
running for elections and is
sues that are big on the tick
ets."
