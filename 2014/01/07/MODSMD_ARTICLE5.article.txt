## Mental health partnership fights stigmas To increase accessibility, CAPS partners with community centers 
### SABELLE SMYTHE STAFF WRITER 
For many at Stanford, seeking mental
health services means finding their way to
the second floor of Vaden Health Center
with its towering windows and modern de
cor.
The past few years, however, have
marked a shift towards a more decentral
ized approach towards psychological
health. University officials have sought to
make mental health services more accessi
ble to on-campus communities that have
traditionally underutilized them.
In 2011, Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) began offering clinical
services at El Centro Chicano, based out of
a former storage closet that was renovated
into a beach-themed wellness room.
"To introduce CAPS services in El Cen
tro, we had a town hall meeting with stu
dents, because it was a new initiative," said
Frances Morales, associate dean and direc
tor of El Centro Chicano. "We wanted to
make sure students knew that coming here
and receiving services didn't mean that
there was a stigma; we were trying to work
to decrease the stigma of seeking help."
According to Morales, offering clinical
services in El Centro was just one such
step: CAPS has been making an active ef
fort in recent years to address varying cul
tural attitudes towards mental health treat
ment, she said.
Approaches and barriers to mental
health care
"One of the things we learned early on is
that a single approach won't work," CAPS
Director Ronald Albucher said. "Because of
the different cultures, languages, treatment
of mental health issues within the culture,
even religious concerns around mental
health issues is this more of a spiritual is
sue versus a mental health issue?"
The stigmatization of mental health is
sues can be more prevalent within some cul
tural groups on campus, making them less
likely to seek out traditional psychological
services, according to Cindy Ng, associate
dean of students and Asian American Activ
ities Center director. Ng brought up the ex
ample of a cultural stigma to mental health
issues impacting whether Asian American
students seek help.
"I believe that Asian American under
grads are still one of the few populations
that underutilize CAPS, and I think it's be
cause of that cultural stigma to help-seek
ing," Ng said. "And when they do go,
they're often sicker, rather than seeking
help early."
More practical difficulties can also arise
for international students, whose insurance
plans often include few or no provisions for
mental health care. This was addressed in
2010, when the University began requiring
all international students to enroll in the
Stanford-run insurance plan Cardinal Care.
Stanford gives exceptions to students
whose insurance meets minimum stan
dards.
"Insisting that all international students
have Cardinal Care coverage was a major
step forward in our ability to work with
those students," Albucher said. "A lot of
them came here with minimal insurance
