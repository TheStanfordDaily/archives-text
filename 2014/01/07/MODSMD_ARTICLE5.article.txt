## Mental health partnership fights stigmas To increase accessibility, CAPS partners with community centers 
### SABELLE SMYTHE STAFF WRITER 
For many at Stanford, seeking mental
health services means finding their way to
the second floor of Vaden Health Center
with its towering windows and modern de
cor.
The past few years, however, have
marked a shift towards a more decentral
ized approach towards psychological
health. University officials have sought to
make mental health services more accessi
ble to on-campus communities that have
traditionally underutilized them.
In 2011, Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) began offering clinical
services at El Centro Chicano, based out of
a former storage closet that was renovated
into a beach-themed wellness room.
"To introduce CAPS services in El Cen
tro, we had a town hall meeting with stu
dents, because it was a new initiative," said
Frances Morales, associate dean and direc
tor of El Centro Chicano. "We wanted to
make sure students knew that coming here
and receiving services didn't mean that
there was a stigma; we were trying to work
to decrease the stigma of seeking help."
According to Morales, offering clinical
services in El Centro was just one such
step: CAPS has been making an active ef
fort in recent years to address varying cul
tural attitudes towards mental health treat
ment, she said.
Approaches and barriers to mental
health care
"One of the things we learned early on is
that a single approach won't work," CAPS
Director Ronald Albucher said. "Because of
the different cultures, languages, treatment
of mental health issues within the culture,
even religious concerns around mental
health issues is this more of a spiritual is
sue versus a mental health issue?"
The stigmatization of mental health is
sues can be more prevalent within some cul
tural groups on campus, making them less
likely to seek out traditional psychological
services, according to Cindy Ng, associate
dean of students and Asian American Activ
ities Center director. Ng brought up the ex
ample of a cultural stigma to mental health
issues impacting whether Asian American
students seek help.
"I believe that Asian American under
grads are still one of the few populations
that underutilize CAPS, and I think it's be
cause of that cultural stigma to help-seek
ing," Ng said. "And when they do go,
they're often sicker, rather than seeking
help early."
More practical difficulties can also arise
for international students, whose insurance
plans often include few or no provisions for
mental health care. This was addressed in
2010, when the University began requiring
all international students to enroll in the
Stanford-run insurance plan Cardinal Care.
Stanford gives exceptions to students
whose insurance meets minimum stan
dards.
"Insisting that all international students
have Cardinal Care coverage was a major
step forward in our ability to work with
those students," Albucher said. "A lot of
them came here with minimal insurance
coverage to begin with, and
certainly within the mental
health area."
"So if we ever had to hos
pitalize a student in the past,
there would be no coverage
for that or if we wanted to
just see them in weekly psy
chotherapy, there was no
coverage for that. It was a fi
nancial burden on the stu
dent," he added.
The lack of proper mental
health coverage was espe
cially prevalent in the gradu
ate student population,
where around one in three
are international students.
Given these numbers, CAPS
worked to reach out to this
community through pro
grams hosted in areas of
campus frequented by grad
uate students, such as the
School of Engineering and
the School of Medicine.
There are also two clinicians
who work at the Graduate
Community Center, Albuch
er said.
"People may be more
comfortable going there to
see a clinician or even to
drop in and talk to somebody
because I think graduate
students tend not to utilize
the community centers near
ly as much," Albucher said.
Increasing community men
tal health care
Many undergraduates,
however, do take advantage
of services offered at the
community centers.
To address cultural fac
tors that may serve as obsta
cles to providing proper
mental health treatments,
the University has focused
on incorporating psychologi
cal services into existing
community structures. The
hope is to increase the acces
sibility of these services,

particularly for students
who may be uncomfortable
signing up for an appoint
ment at Vaden.
"We have a number of
programs that we work in
collaboration with the com
munity centers to bring,"
said Alejandro Martinez,
senior associate director for
consultation and liaison at
CAPS. "The goal there is,
instead of always coming to
us, we want to make sure
students can get some of
these resources where they
are, where they study,
where they live, where they
socialize."
At El Centro Chicano and
the Black Community Serv
ices Center (BCSC), this ef
fort has taken the form of
on-site clinical services as
well as additional programs

that promote mental health,
such as workshops and dis
cussions about stress and
other student issues.
Similar programs have
been introduced at the Na
tive American Cultural Cen
ter (NACC), focusing on ad
dressing mental health is
sues within the broader
framework of Native Ameri
can culture.
In addition to hosting
their own on-site counseling,
the NACC has created a
three-course sequence on
Native American mental
health geared towards stu
dents with an interest in
peer counseling and has in
troduced a talking circle for
students.
"We started a talking
circle in the afternoon,
which is sort of a Native

version of a group wellness
dynamic," said Karen Biest
man, associate dean and di
rector of the NACC. "That
draws, of course, on tribal
principles of a talking circle
and the symbolism of a talk
ing circle."
Martinez said that overall
CAPS has made a dedicated
effort to allocate resources
across communities on cam
pus.
"For a service like CAPS
to be effective, we need to
have a good sense of where
students are," Martinez said.
"That sometimes really re
quires that we be out in the
community, that we don't
just simply wait for students
to come to us."

In 2011, Counseling and Psychological Services opened up a wellness room in EI Centro
Chicano in an effort to address stigmas toward receiving mental health treatment.
For many at Stanford, seeking mental
health services means finding their way to
the second floor of Vaden Health Center
with its towering windows and modern de
cor.
The past few years, however, have
marked a shift towards a more decentral
ized approach towards psychological
health. University officials have sought to
make mental health services more accessi
ble to on-campus communities that have
traditionally underutilized them.
In 2011, Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) began offering clinical
services at El Centro Chicano, based out of
a former storage closet that was renovated
into a beach-themed wellness room.
"To introduce CAPS services in El Cen
tro, we had a town hall meeting with stu
dents, because it was a new initiative," said
Frances Morales, associate dean and direc
tor of El Centro Chicano. "We wanted to
make sure students knew that coming here
and receiving services didn't mean that
there was a stigma; we were trying to work
to decrease the stigma of seeking help."
According to Morales, offering clinical
services in El Centro was just one such
step: CAPS has been making an active ef
fort in recent years to address varying cul
tural attitudes towards mental health treat
ment, she said.
Approaches and barriers to mental
health care
"One of the things we learned early on is
that a single approach won't work," CAPS
Director Ronald Albucher said. "Because of
the different cultures, languages, treatment
of mental health issues within the culture,
even religious concerns around mental
health issues is this more of a spiritual is
sue versus a mental health issue?"
The stigmatization of mental health is
sues can be more prevalent within some cul
tural groups on campus, making them less
likely to seek out traditional psychological
services, according to Cindy Ng, associate
dean of students and Asian American Activ
ities Center director. Ng brought up the ex
ample of a cultural stigma to mental health
issues impacting whether Asian American
students seek help.
"I believe that Asian American under
grads are still one of the few populations
that underutilize CAPS, and I think it's be
cause of that cultural stigma to help-seek
ing," Ng said. "And when they do go,
they're often sicker, rather than seeking
help early."
More practical difficulties can also arise
for international students, whose insurance
plans often include few or no provisions for
mental health care. This was addressed in
2010, when the University began requiring
all international students to enroll in the
Stanford-run insurance plan Cardinal Care.
Stanford gives exceptions to students
whose insurance meets minimum stan
dards.
"Insisting that all international students
have Cardinal Care coverage was a major
step forward in our ability to work with
those students," Albucher said. "A lot of
them came here with minimal insurance
coverage to begin with, and
certainly within the mental
health area."
"So if we ever had to hos
pitalize a student in the past,
there would be no coverage
for that or if we wanted to
just see them in weekly psy
chotherapy, there was no
coverage for that. It was a fi
nancial burden on the stu
dent," he added.
The lack of proper mental
health coverage was espe
cially prevalent in the gradu
ate student population,
where around one in three
are international students.
Given these numbers, CAPS
worked to reach out to this
community through pro
grams hosted in areas of
campus frequented by grad
uate students, such as the
School of Engineering and
the School of Medicine.
There are also two clinicians
who work at the Graduate
Community Center, Albuch
er said.
"People may be more
comfortable going there to
see a clinician or even to
drop in and talk to somebody
because I think graduate
students tend not to utilize
the community centers near
ly as much," Albucher said.
Increasing community men
tal health care
Many undergraduates,
however, do take advantage
of services offered at the
community centers.
To address cultural fac
tors that may serve as obsta
cles to providing proper
mental health treatments,
the University has focused
on incorporating psychologi
cal services into existing
community structures. The
hope is to increase the acces
sibility of these services,

particularly for students
who may be uncomfortable
signing up for an appoint
ment at Vaden.
"We have a number of
programs that we work in
collaboration with the com
munity centers to bring,"
said Alejandro Martinez,
senior associate director for
consultation and liaison at
CAPS. "The goal there is,
instead of always coming to
us, we want to make sure
students can get some of
these resources where they
are, where they study,
where they live, where they
socialize."
At El Centro Chicano and
the Black Community Serv
ices Center (BCSC), this ef
fort has taken the form of
on-site clinical services as
well as additional programs

that promote mental health,
such as workshops and dis
cussions about stress and
other student issues.
Similar programs have
been introduced at the Na
tive American Cultural Cen
ter (NACC), focusing on ad
dressing mental health is
sues within the broader
framework of Native Ameri
can culture.
In addition to hosting
their own on-site counseling,
the NACC has created a
three-course sequence on
Native American mental
health geared towards stu
dents with an interest in
peer counseling and has in
troduced a talking circle for
students.
"We started a talking
circle in the afternoon,
which is sort of a Native

version of a group wellness
dynamic," said Karen Biest
man, associate dean and di
rector of the NACC. "That
draws, of course, on tribal
principles of a talking circle
and the symbolism of a talk
ing circle."
Martinez said that overall
CAPS has made a dedicated
effort to allocate resources
across communities on cam
pus.
"For a service like CAPS
to be effective, we need to
have a good sense of where
students are," Martinez said.
"That sometimes really re
quires that we be out in the
community, that we don't
just simply wait for students
to come to us."
