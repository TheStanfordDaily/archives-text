## Stanford receives $90 million gift to continue fight against cancer 
### â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Stanford announced Monday
it had received a $9O million gift
to support cancer stem cell re
search at the School of Medi
cine.
The money came as part of a
$540 million contribution made
on behalf of the late Daniel Lud
wig, a billionaire American ship
ping magnate, to six different
institutions.
The gift is not Ludwig's first
to Stanford.
Including the latest contribu
tion, Ludwig has now donated
$l5O million to the University
with the Ludwig Center for
Cancer Stem Cell Research and

Medicine at Stanford estab
lished in 2006 named after
him. The center investigates the
treatment of cancer from the
perspective of stem cell biology
and medicine.
The center's current direc
tor, Irving Weissman M.D.'65,
told the Stanford Report that
when most expressed skepti
cism about cancer stem cell re
search, Ludwig took a chance.
Scientists now believe cancer
stem cells may lead to relapses
in cancer patients.
"Ludwig funded cancer stem
cell research at a time when it
was unpopular and disbelieved,"
Weisman said. "Its support has
enabled us to take a discovery
that was first made in leukemia
and apply it to all cancers and to
develop new immunotherapies
to targets revealed in these can
cer stem cells."
