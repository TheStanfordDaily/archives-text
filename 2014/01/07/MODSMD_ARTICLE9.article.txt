# Rose Bowl loss is on coaching
## 
### Ashley Westhem 
It was the perfect day, with a
buzz and excitement filling the
Stanford sections throughout
the Rose Bowl. Alas, it quickly
fizzled along with all hope of a
repeat Rose Bowl victory as Stanford
came up short on its most crucial
fourth-and-1 of the season. Of course,
the fizzle didn't start and end with
that play. There was a tangible shift in
confidence and certainty of a Stan
ford victory as the Cardinal ended
the third quarter without having pro
duced any points.
Analysts can speculate all they
want about why head coach David
Shaw called the game as conserva
tively as he did, but we'll never really
know. That doesn't mean we have to
stop questioning and debating it,
though, because it truly was baffling.
Honestly, it was a coaching deba
cle and there was an apparent crisis
of confidence in his team leaders.
Why was Shaw seemingly afraid to
pass in the second half and if he was
so adamant to not pass, why wouldn't
he rely on the seventh-ranked rusher
in the country, Tyler Gaffney, to make
or break the Card's most decisive
play of the season?
Stanford used three straight run
ning plays to set up the critical
fourth-and-l and then saw Ryan He
witt stuffed running down the middle
after Gaffney was stopped on the
previous third-and-short. Shaw took
the game out of the hands of his
quarterback and his best running
back.
Michigan State is statistically one
of the best defensive teams in the na
tion for limiting its opponents' rush
ing and passing yards to just over 86
and 165 yards per game, respective
ly. So when the mix of passing and
rushing was working so well for the
Card in the first half, why did it stop
and rely so heavily on the run game
for the remainder of the game? Stan
ford just didn't adjust well to the
Spartans' defensive pressure.
When Ty Montgomery got hurt at
the beginning of the fourth quarter,
the passing game was completely
halted. It seemed as if Shaw was hav
ing a change of heart and losing faith
in Kevin Hogan. Even if he was
afraid of a turnover during that cru
cial fourth quarter, he certainly chose
a bad time to lose faith in his quarter
back. It was evident that for whatev
er reason, Shaw was not willing to
put the game in Hogan's hands when
everything was on the line.
You could blame the lack of pass
ing on the absence of Montgomery,
but is Stanford so lacking in depth
that with Montgomery hurt, the of
fense falls apart? No. Shaw could
have utilized Devon Cajuste, Michael
Rector or Kodi Whitfield.
Overall, Stanford didn't play
physically or assertively It was al
most as if the Card was playing not to
lose, rather than playing to win. It
would have been worth taking more
chances with passing, even if they
didn't come to fruition, as long as
Stanford was making adjustments
and putting it all on the line. Instead,
it chose the conservative route. I'm
not doubting that the players put
their heart and soul into that game
especially the seniors in their
fourth and final BCS bowl but did
n't the coaches owe it to their- players
to mix it up a bit and stop the fruit
less running game?
In the end, the lowly three points
managed in the final three quarters
of the game and penalty flags flying
often were not representative of Car
dinal football. The seniors deserved
to go out with a bang, but unfortu
nately Stanford didn't demonstrate
the "intellectual brutality" that those
seniors helped foster.
All that being said, the season
can't be disregarded, as the Cardinal
did pull off huge victories against
Oregon and Arizona State to win the
Pac-12 title. The seniors and fifth
year seniors Gaffney, Shayne
Skov, Trent Murphy and Ben Gard
ner, to name a few are a testa
ment to the success of Stanford foot
ball with and without Andrew Luck.
And when the program was in ques
tion, they didn't skip a beat but just
continued to play their game and de
velop into the leaders that the Card
needed. So while they deserved a
better send-off than the Rose Bowl
game offered, they leave Stanford at
its high point at height that they cre
ated and that will hopefully be sus
tained by the classes that follow.

It was the perfect day, with a
buzz and excitement filling the
Stanford sections throughout
the Rose Bowl. Alas, it quickly
fizzled along with all hope of a
repeat Rose Bowl victory as Stanford
came up short on its most crucial
fourth-and-1 of the season. Of course,
the fizzle didn't start and end with
that play. There was a tangible shift in
confidence and certainty of a Stan
ford victory as the Cardinal ended
the third quarter without having pro
duced any points.
Analysts can speculate all they
want about why head coach David
Shaw called the game as conserva
tively as he did, but we'll never really
know. That doesn't mean we have to
stop questioning and debating it,
though, because it truly was baffling.
Honestly, it was a coaching deba
cle and there was an apparent crisis
of confidence in his team leaders.
Why was Shaw seemingly afraid to
pass in the second half and if he was
so adamant to not pass, why wouldn't
he rely on the seventh-ranked rusher
in the country, Tyler Gaffney, to make
or break the Card's most decisive
play of the season?
Stanford used three straight run
ning plays to set up the critical
fourth-and-l and then saw Ryan He
witt stuffed running down the middle
after Gaffney was stopped on the
previous third-and-short. Shaw took
the game out of the hands of his
quarterback and his best running
back.
Michigan State is statistically one
of the best defensive teams in the na
tion for limiting its opponents' rush
ing and passing yards to just over 86
and 165 yards per game, respective
ly. So when the mix of passing and
rushing was working so well for the
Card in the first half, why did it stop
and rely so heavily on the run game
for the remainder of the game? Stan
ford just didn't adjust well to the
Spartans' defensive pressure.
When Ty Montgomery got hurt at
the beginning of the fourth quarter,
the passing game was completely
halted. It seemed as if Shaw was hav
ing a change of heart and losing faith
in Kevin Hogan. Even if he was
afraid of a turnover during that cru
cial fourth quarter, he certainly chose
a bad time to lose faith in his quarter
back. It was evident that for whatev
er reason, Shaw was not willing to
put the game in Hogan's hands when
everything was on the line.
You could blame the lack of pass
ing on the absence of Montgomery,
but is Stanford so lacking in depth
that with Montgomery hurt, the of
fense falls apart? No. Shaw could
have utilized Devon Cajuste, Michael
Rector or Kodi Whitfield.
Overall, Stanford didn't play
physically or assertively It was al
most as if the Card was playing not to
lose, rather than playing to win. It
would have been worth taking more
chances with passing, even if they
didn't come to fruition, as long as
Stanford was making adjustments
and putting it all on the line. Instead,
it chose the conservative route. I'm
not doubting that the players put
their heart and soul into that game
especially the seniors in their
fourth and final BCS bowl but did
n't the coaches owe it to their- players
to mix it up a bit and stop the fruit
less running game?
In the end, the lowly three points
managed in the final three quarters
of the game and penalty flags flying
often were not representative of Car
dinal football. The seniors deserved
to go out with a bang, but unfortu
nately Stanford didn't demonstrate
the "intellectual brutality" that those
seniors helped foster.
All that being said, the season
can't be disregarded, as the Cardinal
did pull off huge victories against
Oregon and Arizona State to win the
Pac-12 title. The seniors and fifth
year seniors Gaffney, Shayne
Skov, Trent Murphy and Ben Gard
ner, to name a few are a testa
ment to the success of Stanford foot
ball with and without Andrew Luck.
And when the program was in ques
tion, they didn't skip a beat but just
continued to play their game and de
velop into the leaders that the Card
needed. So while they deserved a
better send-off than the Rose Bowl
game offered, they leave Stanford at
its high point at height that they cre
ated and that will hopefully be sus
tained by the classes that follow.
