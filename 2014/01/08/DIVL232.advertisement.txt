UNITS: 1-3
In this course we will view a film, made outside Iran, in each class meeting and expect
to reach a common consensus in identifying the general patterns within these works and
this movement. Questions such as the ones listed below will be addressed in our meetings
each week: What changes in aesthetics and point of view of the filmmaker are caused
by the change in his or her work environment? Though unwantedly these films are made
outside Iran, how related are they to the known (recognized) cinema within Iran? And in
fact, to what extent do these films express things that are left unsaid by the cinema within
Iran?

Modern Iran has been a smithy for political movements, ideologies, and types of states.
Movements include nationalism, constitutionalism, Marxism, Islamic fundamentalism,
social democracy, Islamic liberalism, and fascism. Forms of government include Oriental
despotism, authoritarianism, Islamic theocracy, and liberal democracy. These varieties
have appeared in Iran in an iteration shaped by history, geography, proximity to oil and
the Soviet Union, and the hegemony of Islamic culture.
