# A 						beautiful end to SEC, BCS reigns
## 
### Viggy Venkataraman 
As fireworks lit the night
sky and Jimbo Fisher
got all emotional at his
postgame interview, a
part of me was also
shedding a tear or two. For the day had
come: the last BCS National Champi
onship Game was over, the BCS was
dead, long live the (obnoxiously brand
ed) College Football Playoff.
The narratives that talking heads
could choose to preach about were al
most innumerable in the aftermath.
You had two of the prouder fan-bases
in college football converging on the
Rose Bowl, no stranger to late-game
histrionics, on a balmy January
evening. Tou had this year's edition of
the college football Cinderella story
wrapped in cosmic miracle seasoned
with toppings of the absurd (Auburn,
with its ludicrous victories against
Georgia and Alabama) facing one of
the most dominant teams, by any met
ric, in college football history (Florida
State, with its season-long shellacking
of overmatched conference oppo
nents).
You had Fhmous Jameis Winston,
Heisman TVophy winner, charismatic
speech-giver, team leader, who also
happened to have been recently
cleared of any wrongdoing in a dis
tastefully protracted sexual assault in
vestigation, facing off against Nick
Marshall and Tre Mason, the latter of
whom adopted the Heisman pose as
his celebration of choice in recent
weeks. You had stoic Jimbo Fisher
paired off against mad-genius Gus
Malzahn. You (eventually) had the
SEC's multiyear reign of terror being
snapped in dramatic fashion, that too
by a team from the much-maligned
ACC. I could continue, but I would
most likely run out of column space.
In retrospect, the game was a per
fect analogy for the life of the BCS it
self —wild, wacky, not without contro
versy, but ultimately a rewarding expe
rience. We're definitely going to miss it
a little bit now that it is gone.
The game itself seemed to hinge on
huge momentum-shifting plays in the
second half. There was the gutsy fake
punt on fourth down, which avoided
what would have been another frus
trating three-and-out for a Florida
State offense that literally could do
nothing right. After the conversion, it
seemed the FSU offense could do no
wrong.
There was the missed field goal by
Auburn kicker Cody Parkey; the
points forgone in that miss eventually
accounted for the difference in the 34-
31 final score. On the other side of the
ball, there was Roberto Aguayo and
his theatrically absurd mark of 21 of 22
field goals made this season and 94 of
94 extra points converted, including
two key makes in the title game itself
There was the monstrous kickoff re
turn touchdown that bestowed upon
Florida State its first lead of the game;
then there was the counterpunch from
Tre Mason, and the fear that there
might have been too much time left on
the clock.
Then there was that final drive, a
quick and methodical Florida State
march down the field, all too reminis
cent ofVince Young, at this very venue
a few years back, carving up an ex
hausted USC defense and signaling
the end of an era. This time, it was a
coronation and a vindication of sorts for
Winston, who had looked so out of
sorts all game up until that clutch
drive. On that last possession, he was
calm and collected, completing six of
seven passes for 77 yards and the
game-winning touchdown to Kelvin
Benjamin. And yet, though the game
was all but over, you couldn't help but
wonder whether the 13 seconds left on
the clock were again enough for
Auburn to score. After all, this is the
same team that had made many a win
probability estimate choke in disbelief.
Alas, another Rose Bowl miracle
was not to be, and the Anbum Tigers
sadly trudged off the field, defeated by
the finest of margins. As Florida State
celebrated its first national champi
onship since the Bobby Bowden era,
the curtain closed on the Bowl Cham
pionship Series. Ironically the first
BCS national title game was a 23-17
Tennessee victory over Bowden's
Seminoles. It seems fitting that the
bookending final BCS title game has
Bowden's successor Fisher triumph
ing over another SEC squad in such
dramatic fashion.
College football stands at a cross
roads, as the upcoming playoff system
gets finalized. As the years go by, de
spite all the controversy it engendered,
we might just remember the BCS

fondly After all, it produced
some of the finest drama in all
of sports, whether on or off the
field. Congratulations to Flori
da State, the deserving nation
al champions, and Aubum, a
truly worthy runner up, for all
its accomplishments this sea
son. It was a game that I will
remember for a long time.

Vignesh Venkataraman has

final minutes of the final
BCS bowl. Offer to buy him

self —wild, wacky, not without contro
versy, but ultimately a rewarding expe
rience. We're definitely going to miss it
a little bit now that it is gone.
The game itself seemed to hinge on
huge momentum-shifting plays in the
second half. There was the gutsy fake
punt on fourth down, which avoided
what would have been another frus
trating three-and-out for a Florida
State offense that literally could do
nothing right. After the conversion, it
seemed the FSU offense could do no
wrong.
There was the missed field goal by
Auburn kicker Cody Parkey; the
points forgone in that miss eventually
accounted for the difference in the 34-
31 final score. On the other side of the
ball, there was Roberto Aguayo and
his theatrically absurd mark of 21 of 22
field goals made this season and 94 of
94 extra points converted, including
two key makes in the title game itself
There was the monstrous kickoff re
turn touchdown that bestowed upon
Florida State its first lead of the game;
then there was the counterpunch from
Tre Mason, and the fear that there
might have been too much time left on
the clock.
Then there was that final drive, a
quick and methodical Florida State
march down the field, all too reminis
cent ofVince Young, at this very venue
a few years back, carving up an ex
hausted USC defense and signaling
the end of an era. This time, it was a
coronation and a vindication of sorts for
Winston, who had looked so out of
sorts all game up until that clutch
drive. On that last possession, he was
calm and collected, completing six of
seven passes for 77 yards and the
game-winning touchdown to Kelvin
Benjamin. And yet, though the game
was all but over, you couldn't help but
wonder whether the 13 seconds left on
the clock were again enough for
Auburn to score. After all, this is the
same team that had made many a win
probability estimate choke in disbelief.
Alas, another Rose Bowl miracle
was not to be, and the Anbum Tigers
sadly trudged off the field, defeated by
the finest of margins. As Florida State
celebrated its first national champi
onship since the Bobby Bowden era,
the curtain closed on the Bowl Cham
pionship Series. Ironically the first
BCS national title game was a 23-17
Tennessee victory over Bowden's
Seminoles. It seems fitting that the
bookending final BCS title game has
Bowden's successor Fisher triumph
ing over another SEC squad in such
dramatic fashion.
College football stands at a cross
roads, as the upcoming playoff system
gets finalized. As the years go by, de
spite all the controversy it engendered,
we might just remember the BCS

fondly After all, it produced
some of the finest drama in all
of sports, whether on or off the
field. Congratulations to Flori
da State, the deserving nation
al champions, and Aubum, a
truly worthy runner up, for all
its accomplishments this sea
son. It was a game that I will
remember for a long time.

As fireworks lit the night
sky and Jimbo Fisher
got all emotional at his
postgame interview, a
part of me was also
shedding a tear or two. For the day had
come: the last BCS National Champi
onship Game was over, the BCS was
dead, long live the (obnoxiously brand
ed) College Football Playoff.
The narratives that talking heads
could choose to preach about were al
most innumerable in the aftermath.
You had two of the prouder fan-bases
in college football converging on the
Rose Bowl, no stranger to late-game
histrionics, on a balmy January
evening. Tou had this year's edition of
the college football Cinderella story
wrapped in cosmic miracle seasoned
with toppings of the absurd (Auburn,
with its ludicrous victories against
Georgia and Alabama) facing one of
the most dominant teams, by any met
ric, in college football history (Florida
State, with its season-long shellacking
of overmatched conference oppo
nents).
You had Fhmous Jameis Winston,
Heisman TVophy winner, charismatic
speech-giver, team leader, who also
happened to have been recently
cleared of any wrongdoing in a dis
tastefully protracted sexual assault in
vestigation, facing off against Nick
Marshall and Tre Mason, the latter of
whom adopted the Heisman pose as
his celebration of choice in recent
weeks. You had stoic Jimbo Fisher
paired off against mad-genius Gus
Malzahn. You (eventually) had the
SEC's multiyear reign of terror being
snapped in dramatic fashion, that too
by a team from the much-maligned
ACC. I could continue, but I would
most likely run out of column space.
