# STORY OF THE SEASON
## 
### JORDAN WALLACH STAFF WRITER 
Entering the 2013 season, Stan
ford women's volleyball had an op
portunity to take advantage of a rar
ity in college sports the return of
its entire starting lineup from the
previous season. The young team,
with a core of five sophomores, an
chored by senior captain and middle
blocker Carly Wopat, had its sights
set on an NCAA-record seventh na
tional championship and the school's
first since 2004.
The Cardinal (27-6,17-3 Pac-12),
which finished the postseason
ranked fifth in the nation, had
streaks of dominance throughout
the season en route to its 33rd con
secutive N CAA tournament appear
ance, but also faced some adversity
the Cardinal finished with just a
5-6 record against ranked oppo
nents. The team finished second in
the Pac-12 behind Washington and
ultimately fell in the Elite Eight to
eventual national champion Penn
State.
After sweeping its first two
matches of the season against UC-
Santa Barbara and Pacific, the Car
dinal headed to Austin, Tex., for the
Nike Volleyball Big Four Classic, its
yearly trip to play the nation's top
teams in preparation for a tough
conference slate. The team suffered
quick four-set losses to No. 8 Flori
da and No. 6 Texas, thanks in part to
serving issues (3.57 service errors
per set in the team's first four
matches) and defensive challenges.
Extended serving practices then
became a staple in Stanford's work
outs throughout the season, and the
players reevaluated their efforts on
defense.
"It took giving that extra effort
that [the sophomores] all had last
year when we were young and try
ing to prove ourselves it takes
even more to do it the second year,"
said sophomore middle blocker Inky
Ajanaku. "By the end, I feel that our
defense was one of the things that
got us so far in the tournament."
Stanford's youth was also on dis
play against quality opponents early
on in the season. With the starting
lineup featuring four sophomores,

the team simply hadn't had as much
experience playing with each other
as other veteran squads.
"I don't think we were very
poised. I don't think we were very
tough. And we had to go through the
season to learn some things about
ourselves, about how you have to be
in the big moments," said head
coach John Dunning. "We were still
a young team at that point."
The Cardinal rebounded after its
tough losses in Austin, winning its

next eight matches a stretch in
which it only dropped two sets. Al
most everything was working, as
the team hit .356 over the winning
streak with 1.7 aces per set. But in
its trip to the Galen Center to face
then-No. 2 USC on Oct. 4, Stanford
was swept for the first time since
October 2011.
The Cardinal won five matches
in October, but it was a relatively
tough month for the team, as it suf
fered two difficult five-set losses to

ranked opponents: away at No. 6
Washington and at home against
No. 4 USC Stanford's first home
loss in 24 matches. However, the de
feat at Maples proved to be the
turning point in the team's season.
Coaches and players stressed re
newing focus and maintaining com
posure in high-pressure situations
after the USC match, and a
recharged team dynamic led to a
season-long nine-match winning
streak to end the regular season.
Straight-set victories on the road at
high altitude against Colorado and
Utah at the beginning of November
preceded the Card's marquee win of
the season a sweep against then-
No. 3, and eventual conference
champion Washington on Nov. 20.
In 96 minutes (including an in
termission), Stanford completely
dominated the Huskies, limiting the
Pac-12's best servers to just one ace
in the match and using the good de
fense to create a strong offensive at
tack. The Cardinal defense held its
opponent to a .167 hitting percent
age, key to handing Washington its
only straight-set loss of the regular*
season.
"[The win] gave us that same
mentality that we had last year* that
we were all searching for that
fear-less mentality," Ajanaku said,
"which was what we decided to be
our theme this year. I don't think we
really felt it until we beat Washing
ton." Sophomore setter Madi
Bugg, who was named an AVCA
Second-Team Ail-American and the
Pac-12 Setter of the Year, was key in
the win and throughout the season,
anchoring Stanford's balanced of
fense with her ability to distribute
the ball to both the pins and the mid
dles.
"We're one of the teams that can
either use our middles to beat people,
or make people worry about our mid
dles and instead beat them some
where else," Dunning said prior to
the NCAA tournament. "We have
balance, and everybody knows it."
After taking down Hampton,
Oklahoma, and Minnesota in the
NCAA tournament all in straight
sets, Stanford played Big Ten cham-

pion Penn State in the Lexing
ton, Ky. regional final. It was
the team's toughest matchup
of the season, pairing the
Card's third-ranked block
with the Nittany Lions' top
block in the nation. It was a
thrilling five-set match more
suited for the Final Four, as
the teams were never sepa
rated by more than five
points.
Stanford jumped out to a
quick lead in the match, win
ning the first game 25-22 after
being down 19-15 late in the
set. The team then fell behind
two games to one after Penn
State rallied, but the Card
battled back and dominated
the fourth game to take the
match to a first-to-15 fifth set.
Stanford even jumped out to a
9-6 lead in the final set, but
Penn State's defense, led by
senior middle hitter Katie
Slay, repeatedly denied the
Cardinal attempts with a
strong block. The Nittany Li
ons later took the fifth game
15-11.

Despite Stanford's loss,
Dunning said it was by far the
best match they played on the
season.

It was the last match for
the Cardinal seniors, includ
ing Wopat and outside hitter
Rachel Williams, the 13th and
14th players to record 1,000
career kills for Stanford since
1986. Wopat, a two-time AV
CA First-Team All-American,
was a consistent force on the
court and her strong net pres
ence will especially be missed,
as her 614 career blocks rank
third in Stanford history.
"Everybody can recognize
that Carly has been an All-
American and her level of play
on any given day. But more
than that, it's how much did the
team benefit from her just ob
vious competitive spirit? How
much did the team benefit
from Rachel stepping up and
saying, We have to do things
that help the team and not just
our individual selves,'" Dun
ning said. "[Mary-Ellen Luck]
and [Lydia Bai] were just kind
of more quiet but solid people,
doing the things you have to
do every day."
Though younger players
will have to step up to replace
the graduating seniors in the
stalling lineup, Stanford will
return four AVCA All-Ameri
cans in 2014. Ajanaku is sure
to be one of the leaders on the
team, coming off one of the
best single-season perform
ances in school history. The
first-team All-American hit
.438, the third-best single-sea
son mark in Stanford history
good for ninth-best in the
country this year.

While the team wasn't able
to accomplish everything it
set out to achieve this season,
a core of five rising juniors
leaves a two-year window of
opportunity to achieve the
program's yearly goal of win
ning a national title.
"Everybody knows that
when we get back in the next
couple of weeks that we're go
ing to start over," Dunning
said. "We're not talking about
who played last year, we're not
talking about who redshirted.
We're going to walk into the
gym and say, 'We know what
we learned. We know where
we are.' We're going to get af
ter it because the process re
news itself right now."
