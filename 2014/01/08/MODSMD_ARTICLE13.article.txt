# TAKE THREE
## No. 4 too high for Cardinal? 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
The "way-too-early" top
25 for the 2014 college foot
ball season by ESPN's Mark
Schlabach had Stanford at
No. 4, just behind. No. 3 Ore
gon. We asked football writ
ers David Cohn, Do-Hyoung
Park and Winston Shi: Is
that too high, too low or just
right, for the Cardinal ?
David: I may sound overly
optimistic in my assessment, but
I would argue that Stanford's
ranking is just right, given the
potential of the young talent,
particularly on the defensive
side of the ball, as well as the
overall strength of the Cardinal
program.
While the Card may have to
replace up to seven defensive
starters in 2014, Stanford is for
tunate to have several capable
players, particularly in the line
backer corps, to step into the
starting lineup. One such exam
ple is at one of the two outside
linebacker positions, a spot pre
viously held by Went Murphy.
While Stanford may not be
able to rely on a level of produc
tion that is remotely close to
Murphy's display this past sea
son when he led the nation in
sacks, rising senior Kevin An
derson proved that he can cer
tainly hold down that position
with his play in the 100 th Rose
Bowl Game. In addition, rising
junior inside linebacker Blake
Martinez has earned rave re
views for his performance in
practice, and could serve as a ca
pable replacement for graduating
fifth-year senior Shayne Skov.
Secondly, Stanford's No. 4
ranking in Schlabach's poll re
flects the progress that head
coach David Shaw and former
head coach Jim Harbaugh have
had in producing a "football ren
aissance" on the Farm. Stanford
now stands alone with four con

secutive BCS bowl berths and
two straight conference champi
onships. If anything, the Card's
position, along with the likes of
Alabama and Florida State, re
flects that the Stanford program
will continue to be a preeminent
staple on the national landscape,
regardless of who comes or goes.
Winston: I've often fumed at
how Stanford never seems to get
the love from the pundits and the
polls. The common belief is that
the Cardinal rarely gets the ben
efit of the doubt. But I can't real
ly say that, at least not right now.
Tellingly, the rankings from
this season were also very favor
able to Stanford given the cir
cumstances. We all know how
the polling game works. It's all
about the number of losses a
team has. And pollers respect
Stanford: Throughout the sea
son, Stanford was consistently
the top-ranked one-loss team,
then the top-ranked two-loss
team, and now the top-ranked
three-loss team. Stanford even
outranked equivalent-loss SEC
teams, the first time that's hap
pened in recent memory. The
Stanford brand, in short, is very
strong.
With two major outlets fore
casting Stanford highly, it looks
like Stanford is going to be a top
-10 team in the preseason. Think
ing about the playmakers Stan
ford needs to replace, I'm not
sure I could personally justify a
top-five ranking, and even a top
-10 ranking would be a little ques
tionable to me. Although Stan
ford's recruiting has been very
good and the Card has talent up
and down the roster, the fact re
mains that head coach David
Shaw is still going to have to re

place some truly extraordinary
players.
Still, Stanford has a track
record of success, and every pro
gram cycles out its stars. I would
hope that the coming recruiting
class can produce some immedi
ate contributors, but even with
personnel losses, as the next sea
son dawns, we'll all be reminded
that every other team on Stan
ford's schedule is to some degree
bemoaning the exact same thing.
Do: I'm personally taking
these "way-too-early" top 25
rankings with a grain of salt be
cause, we 11... they're way too
early. There are simply too many
moving pieces right now in the
college football world coach
ing changes and players choos
ing whether or not to declare for
the draft —to try and predict
how each team will fare next sea
son.
Heck, the media has a pretty
bad track record in trying to
predict rankings even after all of
those moving pieces have come
to rest in off-seasons past. Take
this season, for instance. Only
four of the teams ranked in the
preseason AP top ten Ala
bama, Oregon, South Carolina
and Clemson finished in the
postseason top ten. Three of the
final top-five teams in the nation
Auburn, Michigan State and
Missouri were unranked in
the preseason.
We still have no idea whether
key pieces to Stanford's defense,
like senior safety Ed Reynolds,
senior defensive end Henry An
derson or senior linebacker A. J.
Tarpley, are declaring for the
draft or not. We don't know how

strong Louisville's pursuit of
defensive coordinator Derek
Mason is. We don't know
who is filling the coaching
void that former running
backs coach Tavita
Pritchard vacated after he
was selected to replace the
departed Mike Sanford. We
don't know how strong the
rest of the Pac-12 will be
with Steve Sarkisian shuf
fling his way to USC and
Chris Petersen taking the
reins in Washington.
Just so that I have a sem
blance of an actual answer to

the prompt, I'm going to say
that my gut instinct is that
Stanford is too high, based
on all of the talent that the
team has already lost (and
might lose in the next few
weeks). But really, until all of
the pieces come to rest, we
can't really know. And even
when they do come to rest,
we still won't really know.

The "way-too-early" top
25 for the 2014 college foot
ball season by ESPN's Mark
Schlabach had Stanford at
No. 4, just behind. No. 3 Ore
gon. We asked football writ
ers David Cohn, Do-Hyoung
Park and Winston Shi: Is
that too high, too low or just
right, for the Cardinal ?
David: I may sound overly
optimistic in my assessment, but
I would argue that Stanford's
ranking is just right, given the
potential of the young talent,
particularly on the defensive
side of the ball, as well as the
overall strength of the Cardinal
program.
While the Card may have to
replace up to seven defensive
starters in 2014, Stanford is for
tunate to have several capable
players, particularly in the line
backer corps, to step into the
starting lineup. One such exam
ple is at one of the two outside
linebacker positions, a spot pre
viously held by Went Murphy.
While Stanford may not be
able to rely on a level of produc
tion that is remotely close to
Murphy's display this past sea
son when he led the nation in
sacks, rising senior Kevin An
derson proved that he can cer
tainly hold down that position
with his play in the 100 th Rose
Bowl Game. In addition, rising
junior inside linebacker Blake
Martinez has earned rave re
views for his performance in
practice, and could serve as a ca
pable replacement for graduating
fifth-year senior Shayne Skov.
Secondly, Stanford's No. 4
ranking in Schlabach's poll re
flects the progress that head
coach David Shaw and former
head coach Jim Harbaugh have
had in producing a "football ren
aissance" on the Farm. Stanford
now stands alone with four con

secutive BCS bowl berths and
two straight conference champi
onships. If anything, the Card's
position, along with the likes of
Alabama and Florida State, re
flects that the Stanford program
will continue to be a preeminent
staple on the national landscape,
regardless of who comes or goes.
Winston: I've often fumed at
how Stanford never seems to get
the love from the pundits and the
polls. The common belief is that
the Cardinal rarely gets the ben
efit of the doubt. But I can't real
ly say that, at least not right now.
Tellingly, the rankings from
this season were also very favor
able to Stanford given the cir
cumstances. We all know how
the polling game works. It's all
about the number of losses a
team has. And pollers respect
Stanford: Throughout the sea
son, Stanford was consistently
the top-ranked one-loss team,
then the top-ranked two-loss
team, and now the top-ranked
three-loss team. Stanford even
outranked equivalent-loss SEC
teams, the first time that's hap
pened in recent memory. The
Stanford brand, in short, is very
strong.
With two major outlets fore
casting Stanford highly, it looks
like Stanford is going to be a top
-10 team in the preseason. Think
ing about the playmakers Stan
ford needs to replace, I'm not
sure I could personally justify a
top-five ranking, and even a top
-10 ranking would be a little ques
tionable to me. Although Stan
ford's recruiting has been very
good and the Card has talent up
and down the roster, the fact re
mains that head coach David
Shaw is still going to have to re

place some truly extraordinary
players.
Still, Stanford has a track
record of success, and every pro
gram cycles out its stars. I would
hope that the coming recruiting
class can produce some immedi
ate contributors, but even with
personnel losses, as the next sea
son dawns, we'll all be reminded
that every other team on Stan
ford's schedule is to some degree
bemoaning the exact same thing.
Do: I'm personally taking
these "way-too-early" top 25
rankings with a grain of salt be
cause, we 11... they're way too
early. There are simply too many
moving pieces right now in the
college football world coach
ing changes and players choos
ing whether or not to declare for
the draft —to try and predict
how each team will fare next sea
son.
Heck, the media has a pretty
bad track record in trying to
predict rankings even after all of
those moving pieces have come
to rest in off-seasons past. Take
this season, for instance. Only
four of the teams ranked in the
preseason AP top ten Ala
bama, Oregon, South Carolina
and Clemson finished in the
postseason top ten. Three of the
final top-five teams in the nation
Auburn, Michigan State and
Missouri were unranked in
the preseason.
We still have no idea whether
key pieces to Stanford's defense,
like senior safety Ed Reynolds,
senior defensive end Henry An
derson or senior linebacker A. J.
Tarpley, are declaring for the
draft or not. We don't know how
