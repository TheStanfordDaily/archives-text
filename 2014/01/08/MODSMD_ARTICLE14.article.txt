## SUPER WEDNESDAY Nothing Too Special About Special Fees 
### Nick Ahamed 
Student fees are incredibly im
portant to Stanford's vibrant
community. In total, the ASSU
distributes nearly $3 million to 775
different Voluntary Student Organi
zations (VSOs) by collecting $143 per
quarter from each undergraduate
student this year.
Yet the rules that govern student
fees are read by few and understood
by fewer. For a select group AS
SU Senators and VSO treasurers
it is their job to understand this com
plex system. For the rest of the stu
dent body, "special fees" are only rel
evant for a couple months in the
spring, and even then, are the sub
ject of much indifference. "General
fees" receive even less attention.
The system's complexity for
both General and Special Fees
undermines student interest, re
ducing crucial oversight. A more
approachable system is badly need
ed.

General Fees
There are two categories of stu
dent fees: Special and General.
The vast majority of student
groups use general fees, which au
thorize spending of up to $6,000 an
nually. Rather than being distributed
as lump-sum deposits to specific
groups, the ASSU Senate holds the
funds, and groups can submit re
quests for specific funding items.
While the lack of group discretion
can be frustrating, this setup does al
low for clear oversight for the pro
posed spending.
However, general fees groups
are thus limited in the way they can
plan and spend. There is no advan
tage to planning far ahead because
these groups are not given funds un
til they submit specific requests.
Moreover, these appropriations
excessively consume the Senate's
time. For example, at one meeting in
November, the Senate voted on ap
propriations requests totaling only
$32,000. Senators should be able to
use their time more productively,
and they should not be asked to be
accounting professionals. Senators
should not be expected to be well
versed in finance, nor should they
have to have an in depth knowledge
of each VSO. Because of this steep
learning curve, any institutional
knowledge gained is quickly lost af
ter each election.

Special Fees: The Rules
Most of the ASSU's funds are
dispersed via special fees: about $2.5
million of the total $3 million from
last year. In the spring of 2013,54 of
55 groups (and all 50 undergraduate
VSOs) had their Special Fees ap
proved - meaning that they will have
funding for the current school year.
Each of these groups petitioned
because they want to spend more
than the $6,000 limit of General
Fees. Moreover, they were seeking
more control of their respective
budgets so they could fully plan
their budget for the entire year.

Needless to say, Special Fees give
groups significantly more discretion
than General Fees.
While the reasons may be clear,
the process that these groups went
through was not. The first step for
a group is to review their current ac
counts and budget and estimate a
proposed budget for the upcoming
year.
The second step is to earn a spot
on the ballot. Groups that received a
majority of the vote the previous
year, garnered 60% of the vote in the
Senate and increased their budget
by less than 7.1% a 5% increase
plus 2.1% for inflation are auto
matically allowed back onto the bal
lot.
VSOs applying for the first time
and groups that have previously re
ceived Special Fees, but did not
meet the third criteria above, are re
quired to "petition." Yet there is not
just one way to petition. Petitioners
have the option to collect the signa
tures of 15% of the student body. If
they opt not to do that, they must
collect the signatures of 10% of the
student body and earn the support
of 60% of the Undergraduate Sen
ate.
Once groups have jumped
through these hoops, they will have
only accomplished half the task.
Now on the ballot, the student vot
ers must approve them.
Again, this is not straightfor
ward. Expectedly, groups must re
ceive a majority of the votes cast.
But this is nearly guaranteed be
cause of the opt-out system. Stu
dents must specifically choose not to
vote for specific groups but can ap
prove all groups in one click. But be
yond that, 15% of the entire student
body must vote "yes" on the group's
petition. This means that low voter
turnout may make it difficult for
some groups to secure funding. On
ly if both voting criteria are met will
the group will receive its requested
funding.

No Recount Needed
Despite this convoluted petition
and election process year after year,
nearly all undergraduate petitions
are approved. In five of the last nine
elections, every undergraduate peti
tion was approved. 2010 had the low
est approval rate, and even that was
a lofty 88%. While the approval rate
is constant, the average vote share is
steadily increasing - from 65% in
2005 to 73% in 2013. Similarly, the
absolute number of petitions ap
proved is increasing; that number
jumped by 15 between 2005 and
2013.
Do students know about what
they are voting on? These results
suggest they don't. By and large,
the Special Fees system seems
structured so that the groups that
put in the requisite hours receive
the funds they request, regardless
of the merit of their budget itself.
It's clear that budgets could be
more carefully planned. Only about

75% of funds allocated through Spe
cial Fees are spent. The result is a
massive $1.3 million reserve fund
that largely goes untouched. Even
still, Special Fees groups later re
quested $300,000 in budget modifi
cations.
Oversight, supposedly from vot
ers, is lacking.
Current Solutions
Defeating special fee petitions is
extremely difficult.
Students may act as sponsors
against a special fee petition. The
first statement submitted will ap
pear on the ballot, but there is no
guarantee that it will be given equal
attention with the Special Fee re
quest.
If the Special Fee is passed de
spite this, which history suggests is
likely, then students are able to
waive their student fees for any or
all groups. Their portion of special
fees paid in tuition is then refunded
for the term. This is an increasingly
popular option, with 14% waiving
some or all of their student fees in
spring of 2013.
More rebelliously, one student
developed a script to automatically
vote "no" on each special fee. The
Daily estimated that $llO,OOO would
have been saved if only 400 students
had used this script during the
spring 2013 election.
However, these solutions are on
ly Band-Aids. They provide no long
term structural recourse for those

who oppose increasing student fees,
although doing so is badly needed.

Support SAFE Reform
In response, a few students have
joined formed a group to reconfig
ure the funding system. That group,
Student Activity Fee Reform or
SAFE Reform, proposes drastic
changes to the ASSU funding sys
tem that would maintain the positive
aspects of special fees while working
to eliminate the negative ones.
First, the suggested changes
would eliminate special and general
fees and replace them with a set of
major, minor and quick grants.
Major grants are most similar to
the special fees of today in that they
would be used to fund large events
planned far in advance. The new
budgets would be specific to con
crete events. Major grants would
still require the approval of the stu
dent body, although the exact voting
mechanism has yet to be clarified.
Election returns from special
fees suggest that the vote should be
by simple majority and be an opt-in
system as opposed to opt-out, which
would influence students to consider
budgets more carefully. These will
be drawn from an account of rough
ly $1.7 million.
Minor grants would supply the
funding for more immediate events.
These would be awarded quarterly
for an annual sum of about $600,000.
While, like general fees, minor grants
would not require student body ap

proval, unlike general fees they would
be awarded as a lump-sum payment
once approval is received.
Lastly, a new funding resource,
quick grants, would be created. Un
der these, the remaining $200,000 col
lected from student fees would be re
served. Groups could apply for quick
grants if an opportunity or event aris
es that they could not budget for with
either major or minor grants. Again,
students would not have to vote on
this type of grant.
The second change is through the
creation of a Funding Board. This
Board would be responsible for re
viewing all grant requests, for mak
ing recommendations to the Under
graduate Senate for both major and
minor grants, and for authorizing
quick grant requests. Four senators
would sit on the Board alongside
four appointed members well versed
in student finances, such as former
Financial Officers or SSE employ
ees. This shifts the responsibility
from the Undergraduate Senate to a
group of experienced reviewers,
while still maintaining some elected
oversight.
The new grant system would re
quire the Funding Board to meet on
ly once a quarter to approve minor
grants, and as needed for quick
grants. The Undergraduate Senate
would only meet once per term to re
view the Funding Board's recom
mendations. This offers a significant
and positive change from the weekly
Appropriations Committee meetings
on General Fees.

Time is Money
These changes would make the
entire system simpler for senators,
groups and students alike. They of
fer senators more time to focus on
actually improving students' lives at
Stanford. They offer groups more
flexibility in planning their budgets
and more opportunities to fund
events for students. Perhaps most
importantly, student fees would be
capped at $360, a 15% decrease.
There are more than enough rea
sons for everyone to unite behind
this reform of an overly complex and
dysfunctional system.
