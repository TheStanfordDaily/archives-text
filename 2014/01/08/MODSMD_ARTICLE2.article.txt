## Yahoo buys alumni startup PeerCDN Founders shared a love of technology before coming to study at Stanford 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
In December Yahoo purchased Peer-
CDN, a startup company founded by three
Stanford computer science graduates: Fer
oss Aboukhadijeh 'l2 M.S. 'l3, John Hiesey
'll M.S. 'l2 and Abimanyu Raja 'l3.
PeerCDN has created a next-generation
content delivery network that would both
reduce bandwidth costs and increase effi
ciency for websites.
Although the terms of the acquisition
have not yet been disclosed, Aboukhadijeh,
Hiesey, and Raja have joined Yahoo's media
organization.
Longtime passion
All three startup founders had early
starts in the world of computer science,
from Internet work to experience in electric
networks.
Aboukhadijeh's interest in the web be
gan in eighth grade when he wanted to build
a website and he first learned HTML using
a program called Microsoft FrontPage
which allowed him to format his own page
while simultaneously generating the HTML
code for the site in a split
screen display.
"As a freshman in high
school, I decided I wanted to
make a site with all of my fa
vorite videos and flash games
and little Internet-cultured
things on it," Aboukhadijeh
said. "In 2006, it got like
600,000 visitors, and that was
my first taste of 'Oh wow, the
Internet is great.'"
"You can put stuff out
there, and if people like it,
they'll come," he said. "You
don't have to do anything.

It's like getting popular
while you're sleeping."
While attending high
school in Singapore, Raja
was hired by Mozilla to work
on a Firefox extension he had
been developing.
"It was this world where
you could do something and
people would encourage you
to do it," Raja said. "They
don't even have to know that
I'm a kid in Singapore. They
don't care."
Hiesey, on the other hand,
originally thought he would
major in physics or electrical
engineering. Hiesey ex
plained that his father
worked on electronics and
taught him about circuits and
programming around fifth or
sixth grade.
"[My dad] gave me the
schematic, and we went to the
electronic store and bought
breadboards and wires and
all the chips you needed,"
Hiesey said. "I'd wire it up
and say 'Woo - it worked!'
And then I wanted to know
how it worked so I would
study the diagram and figure
out what was going on."

Surprising goals
Aboukhadijeh explained
that as a group, the three
founders aim to surprise peo
ple through their projects,

which have included an appli
cation that displays and
records what everyone on an
open Wi-Fi network is doing
and a quadcopter controlled
by an Oculus Rift Virtual Re
ality headset.
"I like to do projects that
unsettle people," Aboukhadi
jeh said. "You can do things
with computers or with the
web that show people that
their expectations and their
understanding of the com
puter is actually not the way
it works."
PeerCDN itself was one
of those projects with the
goal of surprising people.
The product uses Web
Real Time Communications,
which allows peer-to-peer
communication in the brows
er. Used in applications like
Skype for videoconferencing
and Spotify for music shar
ing, peer-to-peer communi
cation eliminates the middle
man and allows direct con
nections between users,
therefore reducing costs for
the website hosting the ma
terial.
Through a peer-to-peer
network of a site's visitors,
PeerCDN enables the major
ity of a site to be hosted by
users.
By reducing bandwidth
costs, PeerCDN also elimi

nates one of the main limit
ing factors placed on web
sites. Furthermore, the soft
ware is easy for developers
to implement and does not
require users to install any
thing.
"Now [cost is] no longer a
limiting factor so people can
dream up really crazy new
ideas," Aboukhadijeh said.
"We'll make this bandwidth
really cheap and then maybe
people will build cool
things."
Although the original
goal of PeerCDN was not to
join a larger company, Fer
oss, Hiesey, and Raja plan
on working for Yahoo for
some time. In the long
run, however, Hiesey is
considering pursuing a
Ph.D., and Aboukhadijeh al
so wants to return to com
plete his masters but has not
yet determined what year he
will finish.
"I really want to come
back. I feel like now that I've
been out in the world, I'll ac
tually get something from
these really advanced CS
classes," Aboukhadijeh said.
"Now I can actually know
what classes to take and why
[they're] useful."

[they're] useful."

John Hiesey '11 M.S. '12, Feross Aboukhadijeh '12 M.S. '13 and Abimanyu Raja '13 (left to right) founded PeerCDN,
a startup that facilitates peer-to-peer communication in Internet browsers that was recently acquired by Yahoo.
In December Yahoo purchased Peer-
CDN, a startup company founded by three
Stanford computer science graduates: Fer
oss Aboukhadijeh 'l2 M.S. 'l3, John Hiesey
'll M.S. 'l2 and Abimanyu Raja 'l3.
PeerCDN has created a next-generation
content delivery network that would both
reduce bandwidth costs and increase effi
ciency for websites.
Although the terms of the acquisition
have not yet been disclosed, Aboukhadijeh,
Hiesey, and Raja have joined Yahoo's media
organization.
Longtime passion
All three startup founders had early
starts in the world of computer science,
from Internet work to experience in electric
networks.
Aboukhadijeh's interest in the web be
gan in eighth grade when he wanted to build
a website and he first learned HTML using
a program called Microsoft FrontPage
which allowed him to format his own page
while simultaneously generating the HTML
code for the site in a split
screen display.
"As a freshman in high
school, I decided I wanted to
make a site with all of my fa
vorite videos and flash games
and little Internet-cultured
things on it," Aboukhadijeh
said. "In 2006, it got like
600,000 visitors, and that was
my first taste of 'Oh wow, the
Internet is great.'"
"You can put stuff out
there, and if people like it,
they'll come," he said. "You
don't have to do anything.

It's like getting popular
while you're sleeping."
While attending high
school in Singapore, Raja
was hired by Mozilla to work
on a Firefox extension he had
been developing.
"It was this world where
you could do something and
people would encourage you
to do it," Raja said. "They
don't even have to know that
I'm a kid in Singapore. They
don't care."
Hiesey, on the other hand,
originally thought he would
major in physics or electrical
engineering. Hiesey ex
plained that his father
worked on electronics and
taught him about circuits and
programming around fifth or
sixth grade.
"[My dad] gave me the
schematic, and we went to the
electronic store and bought
breadboards and wires and
all the chips you needed,"
Hiesey said. "I'd wire it up
and say 'Woo - it worked!'
And then I wanted to know
how it worked so I would
study the diagram and figure
out what was going on."

Surprising goals
Aboukhadijeh explained
that as a group, the three
founders aim to surprise peo
ple through their projects,

which have included an appli
cation that displays and
records what everyone on an
open Wi-Fi network is doing
and a quadcopter controlled
by an Oculus Rift Virtual Re
ality headset.
"I like to do projects that
unsettle people," Aboukhadi
jeh said. "You can do things
with computers or with the
web that show people that
their expectations and their
understanding of the com
puter is actually not the way
it works."
PeerCDN itself was one
of those projects with the
goal of surprising people.
The product uses Web
Real Time Communications,
which allows peer-to-peer
communication in the brows
er. Used in applications like
Skype for videoconferencing
and Spotify for music shar
ing, peer-to-peer communi
cation eliminates the middle
man and allows direct con
nections between users,
therefore reducing costs for
the website hosting the ma
terial.
Through a peer-to-peer
network of a site's visitors,
PeerCDN enables the major
ity of a site to be hosted by
users.
By reducing bandwidth
costs, PeerCDN also elimi

nates one of the main limit
ing factors placed on web
sites. Furthermore, the soft
ware is easy for developers
to implement and does not
require users to install any
thing.
"Now [cost is] no longer a
limiting factor so people can
dream up really crazy new
ideas," Aboukhadijeh said.
"We'll make this bandwidth
really cheap and then maybe
people will build cool
things."
Although the original
goal of PeerCDN was not to
join a larger company, Fer
oss, Hiesey, and Raja plan
on working for Yahoo for
some time. In the long
run, however, Hiesey is
considering pursuing a
Ph.D., and Aboukhadijeh al
so wants to return to com
plete his masters but has not
yet determined what year he
will finish.
"I really want to come
back. I feel like now that I've
been out in the world, I'll ac
tually get something from
these really advanced CS
classes," Aboukhadijeh said.
"Now I can actually know
what classes to take and why
[they're] useful."
