## Senate unveils new plans for winter quarter Class start times proposal resurface, athletes' academic careers discussed 
### ANDREW VOGELEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although the 15th Undergraduate Senate
passed no official measures beyond the ap
proval of two funding bills, their meeting
Tuesday night revealed plans for the quarter
and featured important updates from several
senators, including updates about proposals
for new class schedules.
Senator Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6, chair of
the student life committee, reported to the
Senate that University Registrar Thomas
Black has expressed desire to keep the pro
posed 8:30 a.m. start time for some classes,
despite opposition from the student body and
University administration suggesting that
the new class scheduling proposal would be
reworked so that the earliest class time
would be 9:00 a.m.
"We continue to work with University ad
ministration to figure out what they are going
to do and then once we know what they are
going to do, we are going to bring it to the stu
dents if we perceive it to adversely affect
them and then have a wider campus discus-
sion about [the future proposal],"
Mouzykantskii said.
Senate Chair Ben Holston 'l5 al
so updated the Senate on the begin
nings of a joint initiative with Cardi
nal Council the representative
council for Stanford varsity athletes
that seeks to guarantee athletes
the ability to graduate in four years,
regardless of major. Some majors
currently have required classes
that conflict with practice sched
ules.
"I believe every athlete should
be able to finish their major within
four years, regardless of major, and
that is not the case right now," Hol
ston said.
Holston also said that the poten
tial for a new class schedule would
create an opportunity for the Sen
ate and the Cardinal Council to dis
cuss their concerns with various ac
ademic departments.
In open forum, the Senate dis
cussed the timeline for acting on the
Upperclassmen Constitutional
Amendment, which requires the
Senate to establish the number of
upperclassmen senators each year.
"We hope to have a bill on the
Senate floor, either as soon as next
week or the week after," Holston
said.
Senator Brandon Caruso 'l6,
chair of the Mental Health Initia
tive, updated the Senate on Univer

sity plans regarding residential
dorm staff, particularly in freshmen
dorms.

There had been some concern
that the Peer Health Educator
(PHE) program would be elimi
nated, but Caruso, after meeting

with administrators from Resi
dential Education, assured the
Senate that the PHE program
would not be decreased in size any
time soon. Caruso also said that
plans were in the works to equal
ize training among residential

staff, so that each staff member is
more capable of handling a wider
variety of concerns.
In addition, Mouzykantskii also
revealed plans for a program that
would promote investigative jour
nalism that explores issues relevant

to students, using funds from the
Senate Innovation Fund.
The Senate also passed $5,578 in
funding bills.

At the first meeting of the quarter, senators engage in talks surrounding proposals for earlier course start times, ways for athletes to complete their
undergraduate education in four years regardless of major, and the future of the Peer Health Educator (PHE) program in residences.
