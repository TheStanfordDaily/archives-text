## Ike's rebidding after contract ends in June A 						Facebook post has created controversy, but Ike's to remain open until at least June 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Operating in the Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering
Center since September 2010, the Stanford branch of
the sandwich shop Ike's Place is open until at least
June 2014 and will remain open if the University ac
cepts a rebid proposal from Ike Shehadeh, the owner
of the eatery.
The sandwich shop was operating on a service con
tract that the University decided to end in June 2014,
said Jamie Beckett, director of communications for the
Stanford School of Engineering. University policy
calls for buildings to put out contracts on a competitive
bid, and various businesses will submit bids that will
be evaluated by a committee representing occupants
of the Science and Engineering Quad, including stu
dents.
"We thought to consider what's best for people that
go to work and school here, so that's why we put it out
for bid," Beckett said.
Shehadeh plans to place a rebid proposal for the
building, an opportunity that the University offered
him in early December. The proposals for bids are due
Jan. 20, and the contract will be awarded in March
2014.
The Science and Engineering Quad is a great place
for business, according to Shehadeh, but if he doesn't
get the bid, he is looking to open other locations in Pa
lo Alto, including University Avenue.
The University put out a survey asking students,
faculty, staff and visitors about their dining prefer
ences to help in the decision-making process, accord
ing to Beckett. The survey consisting of questions
regarding quality, price and wait time received 900
responses, 77 percent of which were from students.
In the survey, a majority (62 percent) said the ideal
price for food to be within the $5.00 to $7.50 range. The
preferred wait time (67 percent) is between five and 10
minutes. In terms of dining options, respondents

"We hope to use [the sur

cision," Beckett said.
Meanwhile, after seeing a

post from Shehadeh on
Facebook announcing the
possibility of Ike's moving
off Stanford campus, Daniel
Knapp 'l5 and a few of his
friends decided to start an
online petition to express the

student support to keep
Ike's, dubbed "Ike's Army."
As of press time, the peti
tion has 467 signatures.
