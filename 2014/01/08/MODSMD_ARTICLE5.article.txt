# STUDENT GROUPS
## VSO alcohol funding process under review 
### SKYLAR COHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Finances for student groups have seen re
cent revisions, including the creation of a new
account that could allow undergraduate
groups to receive money for alcohol purchases
and a streamlined funding process for events.
Effective Jan. 1, a new account was made
available to fund alcohol for voluntary student
organizations (VSOs) through general fees
and special fees. While the account has been
made available online for VSOs, both funding
and reimbursement procedures must be put in
place before undergraduate VSOs can utilize
the account.
Angela Zhang 'l6, appropriations commit
tee chair for the Undergraduate Senate, said
that a funding bill is currently being examined
by the Risk Management Office, and if ap
proved, would allow undergraduate VSOs to
request funding for alcohol through the new
account. Although the office's approval isn't
necessary for the bill to be adopted, Zhang
notes that all parties need to guarantee that
the bill is compliant with Stanford policy and

national law.
According to Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6, chair
of student life for the Undergraduate Senate,
the issue of allowing undergraduate VSOs to
fund alcohol has been unfolding this past year
through discussions between student sena
tors, the Stanford Student Enterprises, and
University officials mainly from Student Ac
tivities and Leadership, the Office of Alcohol
Policy and Education and the Risk Manage
ment Office.
One major concern is that undergraduates
under 21 would be funding alcohol, and the bill
would be illegal, Zhang said.
As a result of this concern, the bill was
modified to state that the percentage of funds
that could go towards purchasing alcohol must
be equal to or less than the percentage of
funds paid by students 21 and older.
Mouzykantskii believes the bill can have
significant benefits. He hopes that the new al
cohol procedure will make alcohol consump
tion safer for everyone involved, minimize risk
involved in alcohol-based transactions and
promote the use of beer and wine as opposed
to hard alcohol.

Although the funding bill is still transit, a
reimbursement policy has been finalized and
was implemented on Jan. 1. This newly creat
ed policy almost always requires VSO events
to be registered and approved by the Univer
sity in order to be eligible for alcohol reim
bursement. Stephen Trusheim 'l3
M.S. 'l3, assistant financial manager of the
ASSU, notes that the University will general
ly approve any event where alcohol is a mean
ingful component but the focus is not simply
on participants becoming intoxicated.
According to Trusheim, in the past it was
generally assumed that the money undergrad
uates pay towards the ASSU (a part of every
student's bill) could not go to alcohol. Howev
er, as long as it is practiced within specific
guidelines, the creation of this account is al
lowed.
"[The account] came from wanting to clar
ify how and when alcohol can be funded by the
ASSU, and more correctly and specifically ac
counting for it in compliance with law and
Stanford policy," Trusheim said.
