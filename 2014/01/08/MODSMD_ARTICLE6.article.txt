## FROM SWEATS TO SUITS, CONOR McFADDEN GETS POLITICAL 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Most senior football players with
a year of eligibility left keep
their post-college plans close
to their chests until season's
end. Even star Texas A&M
quarterback Johnny Manziel, who is widely as
sumed to be headed to the NFL in April, has
n't announced his decision yet.
But Stanford senior center Conor McFad
den is not most football players, and his plans
do not include the NFL Draft.
McFadden, a former walk-on from Sunfish
Lake, Minn., was in uniform for the last time as
a member of the Cardinal when he took the
field on Jan. 1 for the 100 th Rose Bowl Game.
A day later, McFadden headed home to Min
nesota to begin a very different challenge in his

first full-time job: working for his father Mike
McFadden's senate campaign.
"It's a little bittersweet," McFadden said.
"I've been part of such an amazing family here
at Stanford, but it's time to go home. It's time
to help my blood family out for a little while."
McFadden has been juggling these two re
sponsibilities since his dad announced his can
didacy back in May. Anyone walking through
the halls of the Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter might find McFadden on his way to prac
tice or on a conference call with his dad's cam
paign team.
