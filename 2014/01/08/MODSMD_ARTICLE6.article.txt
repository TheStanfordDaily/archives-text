## FROM SWEATS TO SUITS, CONOR McFADDEN GETS POLITICAL 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Most senior football players with
a year of eligibility left keep
their post-college plans close
to their chests until season's
end. Even star Texas A&M
quarterback Johnny Manziel, who is widely as
sumed to be headed to the NFL in April, has
n't announced his decision yet.
But Stanford senior center Conor McFad
den is not most football players, and his plans
do not include the NFL Draft.
McFadden, a former walk-on from Sunfish
Lake, Minn., was in uniform for the last time as
a member of the Cardinal when he took the
field on Jan. 1 for the 100 th Rose Bowl Game.
A day later, McFadden headed home to Min
nesota to begin a very different challenge in his

first full-time job: working for his father Mike
McFadden's senate campaign.
"It's a little bittersweet," McFadden said.
"I've been part of such an amazing family here
at Stanford, but it's time to go home. It's time
to help my blood family out for a little while."
McFadden has been juggling these two re
sponsibilities since his dad announced his can
didacy back in May. Anyone walking through
the halls of the Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter might find McFadden on his way to prac
tice or on a conference call with his dad's cam
paign team.

While McFadden may not
have the work experience of
most people working on sen
ate campaigns, he does have
an academic background that
will help. McFadden majors
in public policy at Stanford
fitting for his new job but
says he picked that path well
before he knew he would be
assisting his dad in a senate
campaign. That hasn't
stopped him from taking ad
vantage of his resources.
"So many of my profes
sors that I've had in Public
Policy are just thought lead
ers, both on the Republican
and Democratic sides," Mc-
Fadden said. "I've been able
to have meetings with people
who have advised presidents,
and they're advising me on
the basics of social security.
I've got Professor [John] Co
gan, [who has] run a Blue-
Ribbon Commission for pres
idents on Social Security, and
he's giving me the basics.
What an unbelievable oppor
tunity that wouldn't be avail
able at any other place other
than Stanford."
With that experience, Mc-
Fadden does not plan to be
just another smiling politi
cian's kid. Anyone who knows
McFadden the cutting intel
lectual, with his savant-like
understanding of the Cardi
nal's playbook and school
textbooks alike, would not be
shocked to see him in the mid
dle of the tough conversations
about policy decisions
throughout the campaign.
But McFadden's persona
lends itself well to the cam
paign trail as well. McFadden
expects that, especially in the
second half of the campaign,
he will spend a lot of time on
the road interacting with vot
ers. So when McFadden
armed with a booming voice
and bubbly personality
steps out on the campaign
trail perhaps as early as this
week, he will have his best
chance to shine.
"I think early [on Jan. 3] I
might be in good old Albert
Lea, [Minn.,] shaking hands
and kissing babies," McFad
den said before the Rose
Bowl. "I'm just trying to
avoid a Will Ferrell moment

[from 'The Campaign']. No
punches will be thrown."
The 6-foot-3, 289-pound
offensive lineman might have
some cleaning up to do before
kissing babies. With McFad
den currently sporting an
overgrown beard fit for an of
fensive lineman, not all of his
teammates are convinced
that he's baby-kissing materi
al.
Senior linebacker A.J.
Tarpley said that, if he had a
baby, he certainly wouldn't let
McFadden kiss it. McFad
den's fellow offensive line
man, senior right tackle Cam
Fleming, said he would let
McFadden kiss a baby, but
only if he shaved first.
"I'd have to let him,"
Fleming said. "He's my
roommate. I'd have to let him
kiss my baby."
For the record, head coach
David Shaw sided with Flem
ing to break the tie, but that
might not matter if the
weather in Minnesota doesn't
improve fast. In the days
leading up to the Rose Bowl,
the wind chill in Minneapolis
dropped to around 60 degrees
below zero only 140 de
grees lower than that in Los
Angeles.
The biggest fear for the
21-year-old, with a game
against No. 4 Michigan State
and a challenging job in a sen
ate campaign just days ahead
of him, was dealing with the
weather.
"It chills everything," Mc-
Fadden said. "It doesn't mat
ter how many layers of cloth
ing you're wearing: It is cold.

I really can't describe it, espe
cially for somebody out in
California. I don't even know
what it feels like anymore... I
complain when it's 50 degrees
out nowadays."
That will make McFad
den's eventual return to Stan
ford all the more sweet. Mc-
Fadden has one quarter of
school left before graduating.
He plans on working for his
dad for the next year before
returning in either January
or April of 2015 to finish out
his degree. At that point, his
eligibility will have expired
barring injury, student-ath
letes have five years to play at
most four seasons, and Mc-
Fadden's five-year clock runs
out before the 2015 football
season â€”so the Rose Bowl
was MeFadden's last football
game.
As the backup center, Mc-
Fadden did not see the field
against Michigan State, but
as a College Gameday seg
ment that aired earlier this
season showed, he definitely
had an impact. He left his
mark behind the scenes, help
ing out in any way that he
could, as he has for the last
four seasons.
So for McFadden, who
said his first job in the cam
paign is to be "Mr. Fix It," the
transition from football to pol
itics may not be as big of a
shift as it seems.

or April of 2015 to finish out
his degree. At that point, his
eligibility will have expired
barring injury, student-ath
letes have five years to play at
most four seasons, and Mc-
Fadden's five-year clock runs
out before the 2015 football
season â€”so the Rose Bowl
was MeFadden's last football
game.
As the backup center, Mc-
Fadden did not see the field
against Michigan State, but
as a College Gameday seg
ment that aired earlier this
season showed, he definitely
had an impact. He left his
mark behind the scenes, help
ing out in any way that he
could, as he has for the last
four seasons.
So for McFadden, who
said his first job in the cam
paign is to be "Mr. Fix It," the
transition from football to pol
itics may not be as big of a
shift as it seems.

A version of this story ap
peared online on Dec. 30.
Most senior football players with
a year of eligibility left keep
their post-college plans close
to their chests until season's
end. Even star Texas A&M
quarterback Johnny Manziel, who is widely as
sumed to be headed to the NFL in April, has
n't announced his decision yet.
But Stanford senior center Conor McFad
den is not most football players, and his plans
do not include the NFL Draft.
McFadden, a former walk-on from Sunfish
Lake, Minn., was in uniform for the last time as
a member of the Cardinal when he took the
field on Jan. 1 for the 100 th Rose Bowl Game.
A day later, McFadden headed home to Min
nesota to begin a very different challenge in his

first full-time job: working for his father Mike
McFadden's senate campaign.
"It's a little bittersweet," McFadden said.
"I've been part of such an amazing family here
at Stanford, but it's time to go home. It's time
to help my blood family out for a little while."
McFadden has been juggling these two re
sponsibilities since his dad announced his can
didacy back in May. Anyone walking through
the halls of the Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter might find McFadden on his way to prac
tice or on a conference call with his dad's cam
paign team.


AVI BAGLA/The Stanford Daily
While McFadden may not
have the work experience of
most people working on sen
ate campaigns, he does have
an academic background that
will help. McFadden majors
in public policy at Stanford
fitting for his new job but
says he picked that path well
before he knew he would be
assisting his dad in a senate
campaign. That hasn't
stopped him from taking ad
vantage of his resources.
"So many of my profes
sors that I've had in Public
Policy are just thought lead
ers, both on the Republican
and Democratic sides," Mc-
Fadden said. "I've been able
to have meetings with people
who have advised presidents,
and they're advising me on
the basics of social security.
I've got Professor [John] Co
gan, [who has] run a Blue-
Ribbon Commission for pres
idents on Social Security, and
he's giving me the basics.
What an unbelievable oppor
tunity that wouldn't be avail
able at any other place other
than Stanford."
With that experience, Mc-
Fadden does not plan to be
just another smiling politi
cian's kid. Anyone who knows
McFadden the cutting intel
lectual, with his savant-like
understanding of the Cardi
nal's playbook and school
textbooks alike, would not be
shocked to see him in the mid
dle of the tough conversations
about policy decisions
throughout the campaign.
But McFadden's persona
lends itself well to the cam
paign trail as well. McFadden
expects that, especially in the
second half of the campaign,
he will spend a lot of time on
the road interacting with vot
ers. So when McFadden
armed with a booming voice
and bubbly personality
steps out on the campaign
trail perhaps as early as this
week, he will have his best
chance to shine.
"I think early [on Jan. 3] I
might be in good old Albert
Lea, [Minn.,] shaking hands
and kissing babies," McFad
den said before the Rose
Bowl. "I'm just trying to
avoid a Will Ferrell moment

[from 'The Campaign']. No
punches will be thrown."
The 6-foot-3, 289-pound
offensive lineman might have
some cleaning up to do before
kissing babies. With McFad
den currently sporting an
overgrown beard fit for an of
fensive lineman, not all of his
teammates are convinced
that he's baby-kissing materi
al.
Senior linebacker A.J.
Tarpley said that, if he had a
baby, he certainly wouldn't let
McFadden kiss it. McFad
den's fellow offensive line
man, senior right tackle Cam
Fleming, said he would let
McFadden kiss a baby, but
only if he shaved first.
"I'd have to let him,"
Fleming said. "He's my
roommate. I'd have to let him
kiss my baby."
For the record, head coach
David Shaw sided with Flem
ing to break the tie, but that
might not matter if the
weather in Minnesota doesn't
improve fast. In the days
leading up to the Rose Bowl,
the wind chill in Minneapolis
dropped to around 60 degrees
below zero only 140 de
grees lower than that in Los
Angeles.
The biggest fear for the
21-year-old, with a game
against No. 4 Michigan State
and a challenging job in a sen
ate campaign just days ahead
of him, was dealing with the
weather.
"It chills everything," Mc-
Fadden said. "It doesn't mat
ter how many layers of cloth
ing you're wearing: It is cold.

I really can't describe it, espe
cially for somebody out in
California. I don't even know
what it feels like anymore... I
complain when it's 50 degrees
out nowadays."
That will make McFad
den's eventual return to Stan
ford all the more sweet. Mc-
Fadden has one quarter of
school left before graduating.
He plans on working for his
dad for the next year before
returning in either January
or April of 2015 to finish out
his degree. At that point, his
eligibility will have expired
barring injury, student-ath
letes have five years to play at
