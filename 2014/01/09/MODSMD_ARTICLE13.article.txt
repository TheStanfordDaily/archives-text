## FOOTBALL Schedule released for 2014 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
The Pac-12 released Stanford
football's full 2014 schedule on
Wednesday afternoon, featuring
nine conference matchups and six
home games. As was the case in
2012, Stanford will have three con
secutive home games to open the
season before most of the student
body arrives on campus for the
new school year.
The Cardinal will open the sea
son against UC-Davis in place of
the annual Bill Walsh Legacy
Game against San Jose State,
which was discontinued after the
schools' athletic departments failed
to reach an agreement.
Stanford will then host its annu
al rivalry game against a new-look
USC team looking to make a
resurgence in the Pac-12 after the
hiring of new head coach Steve
Sarkisian and win at Stanford Sta
dium for the first time since 2008.
The Cardinal will end its
homestand with a non-confer
ence game against Army be
fore a bye week that will coin
cide with the arrival of most
students on campus.
Back-to-back road trips to
Seattle to face Washington
and South Bend to battle
Notre Dame will serve as a
stiff early-season test given
the Cardinal's road woes in
2013, the hostile environment
of Husky Stadium and the re
turn of quarterback Everett
Golson to the helm of the
Fighting Irish offense. Stan
ford will be looking to avenge
its losses to Washington and
Notre Dame in its previous
road games against the two
teams.
A Friday night home game
against a resurgent Washing
ton State team is followed by
perhaps the toughest stretch
of the season: a rematch of the
2013 Pac-12 Championship
Game in Tempe against Ari
zona State, a home matchup
with an experienced quarter
back Sean Mannion and Ore
gon State and, of course, the
annual matchup against fel
low Pac-12 North powerhouse
Oregon.
As has been the case in
the last few years, the contest
between the Ducks and Car
dinal has the potential to be
the de facto Pac-12 North
championship game. With
quarterback Marcus Mariota
and cornerback Ifo Ekpre-
Olomu both returning to the
Ducks for another season, the
Cardinal will face the tough
est challenge of its season at
Autzen Stadium.
After another bye week,
the Cardinal hopes to avenge
last season's heartbreaking
loss to Utah it hosts the Utes
at home before it travels
across the Bay for the 117 th
Big Game, facing a Cal team
that is looking to bounce back
from one of the worst seasons
in recent memory.
For the second time in
three seasons, Stanford will
wrap up its regular season at
the Rose Bowl Stadium
against UCLA. The Bruins,
led by returning quarterback
Brett Hundley, will be looking
to snap a six-game losing
streak against the Cardinal in
another unusual Friday night
game.
If the Cardinal can win its
third consecutive Pac-12 North
crown, it will play in its third
Friday night game of the 2014
season in the Pac-12 Champi
onship Game on Dec. 5.
