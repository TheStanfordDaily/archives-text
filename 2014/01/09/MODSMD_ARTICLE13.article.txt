## FOOTBALL Schedule released for 2014 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
The Pac-12 released Stanford
football's full 2014 schedule on
Wednesday afternoon, featuring
nine conference matchups and six
home games. As was the case in
2012, Stanford will have three con
secutive home games to open the
season before most of the student
body arrives on campus for the
new school year.
The Cardinal will open the sea
son against UC-Davis in place of
the annual Bill Walsh Legacy
Game against San Jose State,
which was discontinued after the
schools' athletic departments failed
to reach an agreement.
Stanford will then host its annu
al rivalry game against a new-look
USC team looking to make a
resurgence in the Pac-12 after the
hiring of new head coach Steve
Sarkisian and win at Stanford Sta
dium for the first time since 2008.
