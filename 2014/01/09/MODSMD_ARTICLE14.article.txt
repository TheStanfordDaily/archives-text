# W. WATER POLO
## Card primed for another shot at title High expectations for Stanford, USC 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Two hundred and forty two
days ago, Stanford women's water
polo, the two-time defending na
tional champions dubbed by many
as the best college water polo
team ever before the 2013 sea
son, came as close as it could
possibly have come to an NCAA
title without grasping it, falling
10-9 in quadruple overtime to
archrival USC.
Two days from now, No. 2
Stanford will begin its quest for
revenge when the Cardinal trav
els to Berkeley for the California
Speedo Cup to kick off what could
be one of the most exciting water
polo seasons in NCAA history.
All season long, the debate
between whether No. 1 USC
or Stanford is the best team
in the country will rage. The
gap between the top two
teams and the rest of the na
tion is pronounced the
teams were a combined 52-0
in games besides Stanford-
USC in the 2013 season so
each matchup between the
two will have the water polo
world holding its breath.
Don't expect a final answer,
however, until the final day of
the NCAA Championships
on May 11 in Los Arigeles.
In the Cardinal's opening
weekend at Berkeley, Stan
ford will play Pacific and then
face off against No. 4 Cal in
an exhibition match. In those
matchups, Stanford head
coach John Tanner will have
his first opportunity to show
how he plans to replace
Melissa Seidemann 'l2, who
finished her playing career
last season after taking the
2012 year off to star on the
United States Olympic team

that brought home gold
medals.
Stanford does return two
other players from that
Olympic squad in sophomore
driver Maggie Steffens and
senior two-meter Annika
Dries. Steffens, who was the
Most Outstanding Player in
the 2012 Olympic water polo
tournament, is expected to be
a stalwart again for the Car
dinal after placing second on
the squad with 60 goals last
season. The play of Dries,
who struggled with injury
early in 2013 but still scored
35 goals and earned second
team All-MPSF status, will
be another key to watch this
weekend.
The Cardinal also returns
two star scorers who were
key contributors on the Car
dinal's 2012 NCAA title-win
ning team while Dries and
Steffens were in London: jun
ior driver Kiley Neushul and
senior driver Kaley Dodson.
Neushul was named first
team All-MPSF for her 50-
goal performance in 2013
while Dodson was a first
team All-American in 2012.
Stanford will have three
weeks off from competition

after Saturday before hosting
the Stanford Invitational on
Feb. 1 and 2. When the regu
lar season begins, look out for
the home game against USC
on March 30 and road game
at UCLA, the last team be
sides USC to beat the Cardi
nal, on April 11.
The matchup between
Stanford and Pacific is sched
uled to begin at 1:30 p.m. Sat
urday in Berkeley and will be
followed at 3 p.m. by an exhi
bition between Cal and Stan
ford.
