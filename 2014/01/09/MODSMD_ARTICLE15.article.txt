# ROAD RUMBLE
## CARD SEEKS FIRST CONFERENCE WIN 
### DANIEL LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
After a disappointing home
loss to Cal last week in its confer
ence opener, the Stanford men's
basketball team will hit the road
this week to take on both Oregon
schools in a crucial stretch for the
team's Pac-12 aspirations. A road
sweep of Oregon State (8-6, 0-2
Pac-12) and No. 17 Oregon (13-2,
1-1) could do wonders to restore
Stanford's confidence early in the
conference season.
At the very least, the Cardinal
(9-4, 0-1) must come away with a
split to avoid a disastrous 0-3 start
to conference play, and that should
be manageable given the favor

able matchup with Oregon State
on Thursday night in Corvallis,
Ore. OSU has lost three of its last
four games, including two last
week against Colorado and Utah
during the opening week of con
ference play.
The Beavers have been partic
ularly poor in two crucial cate
gories: defense and rebounding.
OSU is giving up 73.7 points per
game—just 10th in the confer
ence — and features the worst
three-point defense in the confer
ence, allowing 37.6 percent shoot
ing from behind the arc.
Oregon State compounds its
inability to contest shots by not
doing a very good job of grabbing
the shots that do miss. OSU ranks

dead last in the Pac-12 in rebound
ing margin. Given Stanford's abil
ity to shoot the three the Car
dinal ranks second in the confer
ence in three-point field goal per
centage at 41.2 percent junior
guard Chasson Randle and com
pany should be able to shoot over
OSU's defense and grab a fair
number of offensive rebounds
along the way. This should trans
late into a high-scoring night for
the Cardinal.
Despite their defensive strug
gles, the Beavers field a danger
ous offense that features senior
guard Roberto Nelson, the confer
ence's leading scorer at 21.1
points per game, and senior for
ward Devon Collier, a nightly dou
ble-double threat. If Stanford can
slow down one of Oregon State's
two leading scorers and dominate
the glass against the worst re
bounding team in the conference,
the Cardinal should be able to cor
ral the victory in Corvallis.
Sunday's contest in Eugene
figures to be an entirely different
affair for Stanford, as the Cardi
nal is sure to be a heavy underdog
against the 17th-ranked Ducks.
Led by the sweet shooting of jun
ior guard Joseph Young and the
strong interior play of senior for
ward Mike Moser both trans
fers the Ducks will be eager to
defend their home court after suf
fering their first loss of the season
on Sunday against Colorado.
Oregon's high-flying attack
will be a tough test for Stanford's
recently improved defense. The
Ducks lead the conference in scor
ing with 89.4 points per game and
three-point field goal percentage
at 41.4 percent, and they rank sec
ond in both free throw attempts
and free throw shooting percent
age. Oregon has scored at least 70
points in all but one game this sea
son, while Stanford's defense has
n't allowed an opponent to score
70 since an 88-67 defeat to Pitts
burgh on Nov. 26 a stretch of
six straight games.
For Stanford to find success
against Oregon, the defensive im
provements that the Cardinal has
shown over the past few weeks
must prove to be sustainable. The
Cardinal simply cannot afford to
find itself in a shootout, or odds
are Stanford will wind up on the
wrong side of the scoreboard. The
Men of Maples would be wise to
take a page out of the football
team's book: Control the tempo
and pound the ball inside. The
Ducks simply do not have the size
to contend with the interior scor-
