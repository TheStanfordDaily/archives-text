As a broadcaster, reporter and student,
I have had the opportunity to get to
know Stanford student-athletes,
which has been one of the best as
pects of my Stanford experience thus
far. At Stanford, our student-athletes are talented
individuals who manage to balance the demands of
busy schedules and difficult challenges both on and
off the field, all the while serving as valuable mem
bers of our wider student body.
Among the members of the football team, I am
very fortunate to have had the opportunity to know
junior linebacker Kevin Anderson and junior run
ning back Remound Wright since our freshman
years. I sat down with Kevin and Remound be
fore the Rose Bowl Game to talk about football,
the Rose Bowl and the life of a Stanford student
athlete.

As a Palo Alto native, Kevin Anderson has been
familiar with the Stanford program since he was
young. A standout defensive end for Palo Alto High
School, Kevin had a decorated senior season with
110 tackles, 22 tackles for loss (TFL) and 111/2
sacks while helping lead the Vikings to a state
championship. Since arriving at Stanford, Kevin's
ability to rush the passer has moved him up the
depth chart and earned him the praise of his posi
tion coaches and the 2011 Greg Piers Team Award
for his defensive scout team contributions.
This season, Kevin has backed up Ail-American
and a likely top pick in this year's NFL draft, fifth
year senior outside linebacker Trent Murphy,
which has had a great impact on Kevin's develop
ment as a player.
"I just go and work with [Murphy] and try to
pick his mind," Kevin said. "He is leading the coun
try in sacks, so anything that I learn from him will
be beneficial."
Kevin had his best defensive effort this regular
season against Oregon State. In a defensive
slugfest in Corvallis in which the Cardinal needed a
defensive stand to overcome a sputtering offensive
performance, Kevin tallied five tackles, 2.5 TFL
and 1.5 sacks and helped lead the Card to a gritty
20-12 victory. After the game, Kevin was named one

of the Defensive Players of the Game.
Kevin also played well against Washington State
in October; he totaled three tackles and also laid a
ridiculous hit on Cougars backup quarterback
Austin Apodaca. And then in the Rose Bowl, An
derson had his moment in the spotlight when he re
turned an interception for a touchdown.
While Kevin may deliver punishing hits on the
field, he could not be a nicer person off it. When I
was writing a PWR 1 assignment about the college
experience of a Stanford student-athlete, Kevin
took the time out of his busy winter schedule to an
swer questions for my project.
Kevin and I both lived in the C wing of Roble
Hall freshman year, and one of my favorite memo
ries from that year was the video game competition
between members of my hall (3C) and his hall (2C)
in FIFA and NBA 2K. In his common room in
Roble, Kevin kept a piece of paper on his wall with
the number of victories for some of the people in

Cardinal backfield next season after the departure of senior running back Tyler Gaffney.
