### DAVID COHN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As a broadcaster, reporter and student,
I have had the opportunity to get to
know Stanford student-athletes,
which has been one of the best as
pects of my Stanford experience thus
far. At Stanford, our student-athletes are talented
individuals who manage to balance the demands of
busy schedules and difficult challenges both on and
off the field, all the while serving as valuable mem
bers of our wider student body.
Among the members of the football team, I am
very fortunate to have had the opportunity to know
junior linebacker Kevin Anderson and junior run
ning back Remound Wright since our freshman
years. I sat down with Kevin and Remound be
fore the Rose Bowl Game to talk about football,
the Rose Bowl and the life of a Stanford student
athlete.

As a Palo Alto native, Kevin Anderson has been
familiar with the Stanford program since he was
young. A standout defensive end for Palo Alto High
School, Kevin had a decorated senior season with
110 tackles, 22 tackles for loss (TFL) and 111/2
sacks while helping lead the Vikings to a state
championship. Since arriving at Stanford, Kevin's
ability to rush the passer has moved him up the
depth chart and earned him the praise of his posi
tion coaches and the 2011 Greg Piers Team Award
for his defensive scout team contributions.
This season, Kevin has backed up Ail-American
and a likely top pick in this year's NFL draft, fifth
year senior outside linebacker Trent Murphy,
which has had a great impact on Kevin's develop
ment as a player.
"I just go and work with [Murphy] and try to
pick his mind," Kevin said. "He is leading the coun
try in sacks, so anything that I learn from him will
be beneficial."
Kevin had his best defensive effort this regular
season against Oregon State. In a defensive
slugfest in Corvallis in which the Cardinal needed a
defensive stand to overcome a sputtering offensive
performance, Kevin tallied five tackles, 2.5 TFL
and 1.5 sacks and helped lead the Card to a gritty
20-12 victory. After the game, Kevin was named one

of the Defensive Players of the Game.
Kevin also played well against Washington State
in October; he totaled three tackles and also laid a
ridiculous hit on Cougars backup quarterback
Austin Apodaca. And then in the Rose Bowl, An
derson had his moment in the spotlight when he re
turned an interception for a touchdown.
While Kevin may deliver punishing hits on the
field, he could not be a nicer person off it. When I
was writing a PWR 1 assignment about the college
experience of a Stanford student-athlete, Kevin
took the time out of his busy winter schedule to an
swer questions for my project.
Kevin and I both lived in the C wing of Roble
Hall freshman year, and one of my favorite memo
ries from that year was the video game competition
between members of my hall (3C) and his hall (2C)
in FIFA and NBA 2K. In his common room in
Roble, Kevin kept a piece of paper on his wall with
the number of victories for some of the people in

this competition. Unfortu
nately for Kevin and me, we
both struggled to notch wins
in FIFA against some of the
better players in our halls. It
was, perhaps, the only time I

have seen him fail to achieve
the highest levels of success
both on and off the field.

On the football field, Re
mound Wright is an explosive
running back whose academ
ic and athletic success as a
highly talented prospect at
Bishop Dwenger High School
in Fort Wayne, Ind., led him
to the Farm. Remound re

mains Bishop Dwenger's ca
reer leader in rushing yards
(4,730), touchdowns (85) and
points scored (516).
After redshirting in 2011,
Remound has been a back-up
behind two of Stanford's
most successful running
backs in school history: Step
fan Taylor 'l3 and senior
Tyler Gaffney. Remound
praised Gaffney and Taylor

for the guidance that they
have provided and stated that
he relishes in the opportuni
ties that he has had to prove
himself.
These opportunities have
included a great performance
this year against Washington
State, when Remound led the
team in rushing with 56 yards
on two carries, including a 53-
yard dash to the end zone that
gave the Card a 47-3 lead.
Remound also had two im
pactful carries against Ore
gon and represented a dra
matic change in pace that ap
peared to flummox the
Ducks. While Gaffney, who
received the overwhelming
majority of carries that night,
gained most of his yards
against the Ducks by fighting
through contact with brute
force, Remound utilized his
speed to average nearly sev
en yards per carry for the
Card.
"I enjoy it. It is all about
making the most of my op
portunities," said Remound
about being a change-of-pace
back. "Whenever any of the
running backs get carries, we
are trying to produce. We
don't know whether we will

get another chance. So we
definitely go into a game with
the mindset of making big
plays, scoring touchdowns,
trying to make things hap
pen."
Off the field, I got the op
portunity to see Remound's
dedication when we were in
the same class during the
winter and spring quarters of
our freshman years. Al
though Remound often came
to our 10 a.m. section straight
from early-morning winter
offseason workouts, he al
ways had a smile on his face
and great points to contribute
to our discussion.
Given the seemingly con
stant demands of being a
Stanford student-athlete that
I saw firsthand with Re
mound, I asked him what he
would tell Stanford fans
about these challenges that
he and his teammates have to
manage on daily basis.
"It is a nonstop grind,"
Remound said. "Even when
we are not at the football fa
cility, we are watching film,
going over our playbook and
we have to study for our
classes on top of that, so we
appreciate any support that

Stanford fans can give.
Whether it is screaming real
ly loud on third down, or even
being quiet for the offense,
we appreciate it, and we ap
preciate people coming to the
games and coming out to sup
port us at the Rose Bowl."

I know that Kevin and Re
mound have bright futures
ahead of them, both on and
off the football field. With the
graduation of Murphy,
Gaffney and senior running
back Anthony Wilkerson,
both Kevin and Remound will
figure to compete for the
starting jobs at outside line
backer and running back, re
spectively, in 2014.
As talented as Kevin and
Remound are on the football
field, I see them first as great
people off it. In turn, meeting
student-athletes who are also
great people has been a won
derful aspect of my Stanford
experience.

Kevin had his best defensive effort this regular
season against Oregon State. In a defensive
slugfest in Corvallis in which the Cardinal needed a
defensive stand to overcome a sputtering offensive
performance, Kevin tallied five tackles, 2.5 TFL
and 1.5 sacks and helped lead the Card to a gritty
20-12 victory. After the game, Kevin was named one

of the Defensive Players of the Game.
Kevin also played well against Washington State
in October; he totaled three tackles and also laid a
ridiculous hit on Cougars backup quarterback
Austin Apodaca. And then in the Rose Bowl, An
derson had his moment in the spotlight when he re
turned an interception for a touchdown.
While Kevin may deliver punishing hits on the
field, he could not be a nicer person off it. When I
was writing a PWR 1 assignment about the college
experience of a Stanford student-athlete, Kevin
took the time out of his busy winter schedule to an

Kevin and I both lived in the C wing of Roble
Hall freshman year, and one of my favorite memo
ries from that year was the video game competition
between members of my hall (3C) and his hall (2C)
in FIFA and NBA 2K. In his common room in
Roble, Kevin kept a piece of paper on his wall with
the number of victories for some of the people in

this competition. Unfortu
nately for Kevin and me, we
both struggled to notch wins
in FIFA against some of the
better players in our halls. It
was, perhaps, the only time I

have seen him fail to achieve
the highest levels of success
both on and off the field.

On the football field, Re
mound Wright is an explosive
running back whose academ
ic and athletic success as a
highly talented prospect at
Bishop Dwenger High School
in Fort Wayne, Ind., led him
to the Farm. Remound re

mains Bishop Dwenger's ca
reer leader in rushing yards
(4,730), touchdowns (85) and
points scored (516).
After redshirting in 2011,
Remound has been a back-up
behind two of Stanford's
most successful running
backs in school history: Step
fan Taylor 'l3 and senior
Tyler Gaffney. Remound
praised Gaffney and Taylor

for the guidance that they
have provided and stated that
he relishes in the opportuni
ties that he has had to prove
himself.
These opportunities have
included a great performance
this year against Washington
State, when Remound led the
team in rushing with 56 yards
on two carries, including a 53-
yard dash to the end zone that
gave the Card a 47-3 lead.
Remound also had two im
pactful carries against Ore
gon and represented a dra
matic change in pace that ap
peared to flummox the
Ducks. While Gaffney, who
received the overwhelming
majority of carries that night,
gained most of his yards
against the Ducks by fighting
through contact with brute
force, Remound utilized his
speed to average nearly sev
en yards per carry for the
Card.
"I enjoy it. It is all about
making the most of my op
portunities," said Remound
about being a change-of-pace
back. "Whenever any of the
running backs get carries, we
are trying to produce. We
don't know whether we will

get another chance. So we
definitely go into a game with
the mindset of making big
plays, scoring touchdowns,
trying to make things hap
pen."
Off the field, I got the op
portunity to see Remound's
dedication when we were in
the same class during the
winter and spring quarters of
our freshman years. Al
though Remound often came
to our 10 a.m. section straight
from early-morning winter
offseason workouts, he al
ways had a smile on his face
and great points to contribute
to our discussion.
Given the seemingly con
stant demands of being a
Stanford student-athlete that
I saw firsthand with Re
mound, I asked him what he
would tell Stanford fans
about these challenges that
he and his teammates have to
manage on daily basis.
"It is a nonstop grind,"
Remound said. "Even when
we are not at the football fa
cility, we are watching film,
going over our playbook and
we have to study for our
classes on top of that, so we
appreciate any support that

Stanford fans can give.
Whether it is screaming real
ly loud on third down, or even
being quiet for the offense,
we appreciate it, and we ap
preciate people coming to the
games and coming out to sup
port us at the Rose Bowl."

I know that Kevin and Re
mound have bright futures
ahead of them, both on and
off the football field. With the
graduation of Murphy,
Gaffney and senior running
back Anthony Wilkerson,
both Kevin and Remound will
figure to compete for the
starting jobs at outside line
backer and running back, re
spectively, in 2014.
As talented as Kevin and
Remound are on the football
field, I see them first as great
people off it. In turn, meeting
student-athletes who are also
great people has been a won
derful aspect of my Stanford
experience.

As a broadcaster, reporter and student,
I have had the opportunity to get to
know Stanford student-athletes,
which has been one of the best as
pects of my Stanford experience thus
far. At Stanford, our student-athletes are talented
individuals who manage to balance the demands of
busy schedules and difficult challenges both on and
off the field, all the while serving as valuable mem
bers of our wider student body.
Among the members of the football team, I am
very fortunate to have had the opportunity to know
junior linebacker Kevin Anderson and junior run
ning back Remound Wright since our freshman
years. I sat down with Kevin and Remound be
fore the Rose Bowl Game to talk about football,
the Rose Bowl and the life of a Stanford student
athlete.

As a Palo Alto native, Kevin Anderson has been
familiar with the Stanford program since he was
young. A standout defensive end for Palo Alto High
School, Kevin had a decorated senior season with
110 tackles, 22 tackles for loss (TFL) and 111/2
sacks while helping lead the Vikings to a state
championship. Since arriving at Stanford, Kevin's
ability to rush the passer has moved him up the
depth chart and earned him the praise of his posi
tion coaches and the 2011 Greg Piers Team Award
for his defensive scout team contributions.
This season, Kevin has backed up Ail-American
and a likely top pick in this year's NFL draft, fifth
year senior outside linebacker Trent Murphy,
which has had a great impact on Kevin's develop
ment as a player.
"I just go and work with [Murphy] and try to
pick his mind," Kevin said. "He is leading the coun
try in sacks, so anything that I learn from him will
be beneficial."
