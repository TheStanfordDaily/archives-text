# Scheduling issues come into focus
## 
### Joey Beyda 
Let's start with the good:
For the fourth straight
year, Stanford and Ore
gon will square off in a
November matchup
that's likely to decide the Pac-12
North title. Besides that, well ...
Crickets.
It's hard not to cringe looking at
the Cardinal's 2014 football sched
ule, which includes two Friday
games three if you count the Pac
-12 Championship and has Stan
ford playing half of its home contests
before the students arrive on cam
pus. That's not to mention the rela
tive weakness of the Cardinal's 2014
home slate, which only includes one
team that finished the 2013 season
ranked in the AP top 25. Five of
Stanford's home opponents from
this past season appeal 1 in that same
poll.

Scheduling is no easy business,
and there's usually a glitch or two; nei
ther the Cardinal's season-opening
bye in 2013 nor its October showdown
with Cal in 2012 went over well with
fans (or the team). But this year's
schedule sees those two unsatisfying
agendas and raises them a hearty
dose of disappointment.
The most eye-popping scheduling
decision is Stanford's Sept. 6 game
against USC in week two. Maybe the
Cardinal is lucky to catch the potential
top-10 Trojans early, before they truly
adjust to new coach Steve Sarkisian's
staff and system. But what of the at
mosphere at Stanford Stadium 16
days before the start of fall classes? A
favorable crowd can mean a whole lot
in a tight game, and unlike in 2012,
when the Red Zone was full for the
pre-NSO matchup, few non-local stu
dents will be in town for what has be
come arguably the Cardinal's biggest
rivalry.
Take those extra student seats and
add to them the ones that newly mint
ed Stanford season ticket holders in
the East Lansing area will likely be
hawking on Stub Hub, and our sea of
Cardinal is bound to take on a few yel
low blotches.
It won't be as bad as the Trojan in
vasion of 2006, when a hoard of USC
fans dominated Stanford Stadium
against fans of the struggling Cardi
nal. But in another flashback to the
dark days, Stanford opens the season
by welcoming UC-Davis, which be
came the only non-Division I-A team
to beat the Cardinal back in 2005.
Even if you don't care about that little
piece of unfortunate history, it's hard
to be enthusiastic about playing the
Aggies, who are fresh off a 5-7 record,
including a 0-4 mark outside of the
Big Sky Conference.
After another unbalanced tilt with
Army and a bye week, the Cardinal
will then prepare to face Washington
and Notre Dame on the road in con
secutive weeks. The last time Stan
ford had to make those two trips
(2012), it didn't win either game.
The Cardinal will then return to
the Farm for the Class of 2018's first
home game, but hold the face paint
and tailgating. Assuming this one gets
the same 6 p.m. slot that the Pac-12's
midseason Friday night games did
last year; those festivities will give way
to a collective race to the stadium
from Thinking Matters sections
and, for students of old, from corner
offices across the Bay Area.
The Cougars didn't give the Cardi
nal any trouble in 2013, but they near
ly pulled off the upset at Stanford Sta
dium just two years ago and are well
on their way to respectability after
their first bowl berth in 10 year's.
Again, having a full stadium would be
nice.

Dec. 5 Pac-1 2 Championship
Game

Big Game in Berkeley and
then another Friday night con
test at UCLA will close out the
regular season. Normally, I'd
say there's no way the Cardi
nal looks past archrival Cal,
but given the Bears' recent
struggles, the Bruins' recent
resurgence and the shortened

week between those two
games in 2014, Stanford's
mental focus will have to be at
its best if it wants to end its
year with two wins.
The only other irregularity
of note is the Pac-12 Champi
onship Game's return to Fri
day nightâ€”which led to infa
mously poor attendance when
Stanford hosted the event in
2012 after a one-year (and
highly successful) switch to
Saturday.
Of course, if the Pac-12

schedulers had their way; the
Cardinal wouldn't have to wor
ry about that game regardless.

Regardless of what Joseph
Beyda says, he is more excit
ed for the UC-Davis game
than he has been for any
home game in Stanford foot
ball history. Seeing as how
the entire Beyda. clan will be
in attendance, suggest big,
family-friendly reunion lo
cations to Joey at jbeyda@
stanford.edu.
