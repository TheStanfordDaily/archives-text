# ALTITUDE AWAITS CARD
## UTAH, COLORADO FIRST IN PAC-12 ROAD SLATE 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Senior forward Chiney Ogwumike started
the Pac-12 season with a bang in last week
end's season opener and earned her fifth Pac
-12 Player of the Week honor this season. In
doing so, she became the Pac-12's all-time
leading rebounder and averaged 32 points
and 13.5 rebounds per game in the Card's dis
mantling of both Oregon and Oregon State.
This weekend, the No. 4 Cardinal (13-1,2-
0 Pac-12) will embark on a journey into the
mountains for its first conference road trip of
the season at Utah (7-6, 0-2) on Friday and
No. 17 Colorado (11-1,1-1) on Sunday
This time last season, the Card was heavi
ly dependent on the production and leader
ship of Ogwumike, causing head coach Tara
VanDerveer to make a strong call for her oth
er players to step up. Then-junior guard Sara
James came through in this exact road series
with the highest-scoring game of her career,
totaling 18 points and four assists in the
Card's win over the Utes. Three other Cardi
nal players also scored double-digit points in
that game to seal the 70-56 win.
Fast-forward to the present and Van-
Derveer is singing a different tune. Various
starters and players off the bench have been
taking their turns in contributing to the team
effort, providing consistent backup and lead
ership from all over the roster. Because of
that, it should be expected that the Card will
receive impactful scoring from at least one
player other than Ogwumike something
that wasn't a given at the tip-off against Utah
a year ago.
Stanford has three players averaging dou

ble digits in scoring this season: Ogwumike
with 26.6 points per game, junior guard Am
ber Orrange with 10.5 and junior forward
Taylor Greenfield with 10. The Card has
come alive from behind the three-point line
this season, with Greenfield and junior for
ward Bonnie Samuelson leading the way with
their .520 (13-of-25) marks from behind the
line in the past six games. FYeshman guard
Lili Thompson has also made her mark by
hitting eight triples and averaging 11 points,
four assists and 3.5 rebounds in that same
span.
Though not one of the Card's main offen
sive threats, senior forward Mikaela Ruef has
produced 7.2 points per game while being a
force at the post position, ranking in the Pac
e's top-15 in rebounding, assists and assist
to-turnover ratio.
Utah is led by a pair of forwards: senior
Michelle Plouffe with her 17.9 points and 10.7
rebounds per game and freshman Emily Pot
ter with 11.5 points and 6.4 rebounds per
game. The Utes' defense has proved to be a
force to reckon with, as it has held the Cardi
nal to 70 points or fewer in the teams' last six
meetings. The Utes will enter the matchup
having dropped its first two conference
games to UCLA and USC.
Due to the recent addition of Utah and
Colorado to the Pac-12, the Card plays four
conference teams just once per year. Stanford
started out with two of those teams last week
end in Oregon and Oregon State and will fin
ish with Colorado and Utah this upcoming
weekend in its only matchups with those four
teams of the season. Starting next week, the
Card will play all other conference teams
twice once at home and once on the road.
The Card plays at Utah at 5 p.m. on Fri
day and at Colorado at 2 p.m. on Sunday.
