# Preserving Alaska's Hobbit Hole
## Ph.D. students campaign to open field school 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Zach Brown, a sixth-year
Ph.D. student in the Department
of Environmental Earth System
Science, recalls some of the most
memorable events in his life oc
curring at the Hobbit Hole, a five
acre property surrounded by
wilderness in southeast Alaska.
Potlucks. Jam sessions. The
weddings of childhood friends.
"People really enjoyed coming
out there because there's a real
sense of affability and community
that develops when you are all to
gether in this small little place, on
this island, in the midst of this
abundant beauty," Brown said.
The plot of land, resting be
tween the world's largest tem
perate rainforest and the Gla
cier Bay National Park, might
become the site of another mo
mentous occasion in Brown's
life. He and three other Stan
ford Ph.D. students have a plan
to purchase the property and
transform it into a nonprofit field
school called the Inian Islands In
stitute, allowing students from
Stanford, other universities and
even high schools to take month
long experiential learning classes
on sustainability.
First, however, the group is
working to raise funds for the
project.
As of Wednesday night, a
crowdfunding campaign on the

site Indiegogo had generated
around $19,500. The campaign has
until Jan. 12 to amass the rest of
its $40,000 goal, an amount that
would go towards covering initial
expenses: for instance, an official
appraisal of the property, legal
fees to become a nonprofit, pro
motional materials and the ability
to invite potential donors to visit
the remote Alaskan site.
"It's an exciting thing to think
about: bringing students out into
the wilderness to think about
ecology and conservation and hu
man-environment interactions,"

Brown said.
The founding four
His parents both employed by
the National Parks Service,
Brown grew up in Gustavus, Ala.
The small coastal town has a pop
ulation of about 400 and is so iso
lated, Brown said, that his five
person basketball team had to fly
by bush planes to get to games.
Geographically close to Gus
tavus, however, are the Inian Is
lands. Brown said these islands
are uninhabited with one excep
tion: the Hobbit Hole, which sits

on a protected harbor and is com
prised of three houses, a work
shop and a dock.
For around 40 years, family
friends owned and lived on the
property, where they worked as
commercial fishermen. Three
years ago, however, they put the
land up for the sale, announcing
retirement from their labor-inten
sive lifestyle.
That's when the idea of estab
lishing an institute first came,
Brown said.

Four Ph.D. students are raising funds through an online campaign to purchase a plot of land known as
the Hobbit Hole in Alaska (pictured above), where they hope to open the Inian Islands Institute.
After a chance meeting in
Monterey, Calif., Brown lat
er shared his thoughts with
Lauren Oakes a fifth-year
Stanford Ph.D. student in the
Emmett Interdisciplinary
Program in Environment and
Resources (E-IPER) who
conducted dissertation re
search in southeast Alaska.
"When Zach and I met, it
was really clear that he also
wanted to protect that place,"
Oakes said. "He knew the
Hobbit Hole was a place that
holds a tremendous opportu
nity for education and re
search, but it could also poten
tially be bought by a lodge
owner or someone who wants
to do something very differ
ent there."
Oakes jumped on board
with the project, believing it
was well matched with her
own academic and personal
interests.
"Alaska's been amazing to
me," Oakes said. "I call it my
monogamous relationship
with a place."
"That place just holds a re
markable capacity to teach
people about environmental
change," Oakes said. "There's
a fascinating history of people
with a deep connection to the
natural resources, and I see
us teaching sustainability
places in an area where stu
dents will have an immediate
relationship with the re
sources that they rely upon."

third-year Ph.D. student in E
IPER, complete the founding
member quartet.
At first, the four would just
meet up in the evenings and
talk about the potential proj
ect over a few beers, Brown
said. In the last year, however,
the group has become more
serious about the institute,
drafting a business plan, re
cruiting members for its advi
sory council and launching a
website.

Getting the idea off the
ground
One of the most important
initial steps, Oakes said, was
drawing up a document listing
the core values that would
guide the project.
"Some of [the core values]
have been maintaining a small
program, protecting the place
in its current state [and] em
phasizing an interdisciplinary
program," Oakes said.
"It's really easy to get dis
tracted. Someone could have
the idea, 'Why don't we make
it a marine research institu
tion?"' she added. "That
sounds great, and obviously
has value as well, but it's a
step away from what we in
a dream world would like
to do there."
The first test of this dream
came this September.
The group along with
Robert Dunbar, professor of
environmental earth system
science led a three-week
seminar based in southeast
Alaska. Held as part of Stan

ford's Sophomore College
program, the course gave
twelve rising sophomores the
opportunity to learn resource
management and long-term
sustainability in the communi
ty of Sitka, Ala.
At one point in the seminar,
participants chartered a boat
around 100 miles north to the
Hobbit Hole and stayed on
the property for several days.
"We thought about the is
sues of resources and sustain
ability on a real micro scale,"
Brown said. "We were able to
eat fresh-caught venison,
salmon and halibut. We were
able to utilitze power generat
ed right there on site by a mi
cro hydro system."
Brown said the seminar ex
perience reaffirmed his desire
to open the institute. After de
fending his dissertation in
March, he hopes to return to
the Hobbit Hole and lead the
project year-round. The goal
is to have the institute serve
as the site of another Sopho
more College course or simi
lar college seminar in summer
2015.
Right now, however, the in
stitute's founders said they
are focused on finishing the

crowdfunding campaign and
searching for a donor. They
are also examining the feasi
bility of the project, acknowl
edging the high costs of work
ing in remote southeast Alas
ka.
According to Strong, the
money from the crowdfund
ing campaign will help move
the project forward.
"In order to make this hap
pen we are going to need a
long-term strategy, but the
first step is to actually acquire
the property," Strong said.
'And to acquire the property,
we need to raise awareness
about our mission and get the
property appraised. The
crowdfunding campaign can
help us accomplish those first
steps."
Oakes agreed that the goal
is to make the institute a long
term project.
"We want to make this a
sustainable program," Oakes
said. "Ironically, building the
institute and making it work
is forcing us to ask questions
that run parallel to what we
want to teach our students."

memorable events in his life oc
curring at the Hobbit Hole, a five

wilderness in southeast Alaska.
Potlucks. Jam sessions. The
weddings of childhood friends.
"People really enjoyed coming
out there because there's a real
sense of affability and community
that develops when you are all to
gether in this small little place, on
this island, in the midst of this
abundant beauty," Brown said.
The plot of land, resting be
tween the world's largest tem
perate rainforest and the Gla
cier Bay National Park, might
become the site of another mo
mentous occasion in Brown's
life. He and three other Stan
ford Ph.D. students have a plan
to purchase the property and
transform it into a nonprofit field
school called the Inian Islands In
stitute, allowing students from
Stanford, other universities and
even high schools to take month
long experiential learning classes
on sustainability.
First, however, the group is
working to raise funds for the
project.
As of Wednesday night, a
crowdfunding campaign on the

site Indiegogo had generated
around $19,500. The campaign has
until Jan. 12 to amass the rest of
its $40,000 goal, an amount that
would go towards covering initial
expenses: for instance, an official
appraisal of the property, legal
fees to become a nonprofit, pro
motional materials and the ability
to invite potential donors to visit
the remote Alaskan site.
"It's an exciting thing to think
about: bringing students out into
the wilderness to think about
ecology and conservation and hu
man-environment interactions,"

Brown said.

His parents both employed by
the National Parks Service,
Brown grew up in Gustavus, Ala.
The small coastal town has a pop
ulation of about 400 and is so iso
lated, Brown said, that his five
person basketball team had to fly
by bush planes to get to games.
Geographically close to Gus
tavus, however, are the Inian Is
lands. Brown said these islands
are uninhabited with one excep
tion: the Hobbit Hole, which sits

on a protected harbor and is com
prised of three houses, a work
shop and a dock.
For around 40 years, family
friends owned and lived on the
property, where they worked as
commercial fishermen. Three
years ago, however, they put the
land up for the sale, announcing
retirement from their labor-inten
sive lifestyle.
That's when the idea of estab
lishing an institute first came,
Brown said.

Four Ph.D. students are raising funds through an online campaign to purchase a plot of land known as
the Hobbit Hole in Alaska (pictured above), where they hope to open the Inian Islands Institute.
After a chance meeting in

conducted dissertation re

"When Zach and I met, it

Oakes jumped on board
with the project, believing it
was well matched with her
own academic and personal
interests.
"Alaska's been amazing to
me," Oakes said. "I call it my

"That place just holds a re

At first, the four would just
meet up in the evenings and
talk about the potential proj
ect over a few beers, Brown
said. In the last year, however,
the group has become more
serious about the institute,
drafting a business plan, re
cruiting members for its advi
sory council and launching a
website.

Getting the idea off the
ground
One of the most important
initial steps, Oakes said, was
drawing up a document listing
the core values that would
guide the project.
"Some of [the core values]
have been maintaining a small
program, protecting the place
in its current state [and] em
phasizing an interdisciplinary
program," Oakes said.
"It's really easy to get dis
tracted. Someone could have
the idea, 'Why don't we make
it a marine research institu
tion?"' she added. "That
sounds great, and obviously
has value as well, but it's a
step away from what we in
a dream world would like
to do there."
The first test of this dream
came this September.
The group along with
Robert Dunbar, professor of
environmental earth system
science led a three-week
seminar based in southeast
Alaska. Held as part of Stan

ford's Sophomore College
program, the course gave
twelve rising sophomores the
opportunity to learn resource
management and long-term
sustainability in the communi
ty of Sitka, Ala.
At one point in the seminar,
participants chartered a boat
around 100 miles north to the
Hobbit Hole and stayed on
the property for several days.
"We thought about the is
sues of resources and sustain
ability on a real micro scale,"
Brown said. "We were able to
eat fresh-caught venison,
salmon and halibut. We were
able to utilitze power generat
ed right there on site by a mi
cro hydro system."
Brown said the seminar ex
perience reaffirmed his desire
to open the institute. After de
fending his dissertation in
March, he hopes to return to
the Hobbit Hole and lead the
project year-round. The goal
is to have the institute serve
as the site of another Sopho
more College course or simi
lar college seminar in summer
2015.
Right now, however, the in
stitute's founders said they
are focused on finishing the

crowdfunding campaign and
searching for a donor. They
are also examining the feasi
bility of the project, acknowl
edging the high costs of work
ing in remote southeast Alas
ka.
According to Strong, the
money from the crowdfund
ing campaign will help move
the project forward.
"In order to make this hap
pen we are going to need a
long-term strategy, but the
first step is to actually acquire
the property," Strong said.
'And to acquire the property,
we need to raise awareness
about our mission and get the
property appraised. The
crowdfunding campaign can

pen we are going to need a
long-term strategy, but the
first step is to actually acquire
the property," Strong said.
'And to acquire the property,
we need to raise awareness
about our mission and get the
property appraised. The
crowdfunding campaign can
help us accomplish those first
steps."
Oakes agreed that the goal
is to make the institute a long
term project.
"We want to make this a
sustainable program," Oakes
said. "Ironically, building the
institute and making it work
is forcing us to ask questions
that run parallel to what we
want to teach our students."
