# Preserving Alaska's Hobbit Hole
## Ph.D. students campaign to open field school 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Zach Brown, a sixth-year
Ph.D. student in the Department
of Environmental Earth System
Science, recalls some of the most
memorable events in his life oc
curring at the Hobbit Hole, a five
acre property surrounded by
wilderness in southeast Alaska.
Potlucks. Jam sessions. The
weddings of childhood friends.
"People really enjoyed coming
out there because there's a real
sense of affability and community
that develops when you are all to
gether in this small little place, on
this island, in the midst of this
abundant beauty," Brown said.
The plot of land, resting be
tween the world's largest tem
perate rainforest and the Gla
cier Bay National Park, might
become the site of another mo
mentous occasion in Brown's
life. He and three other Stan
ford Ph.D. students have a plan
to purchase the property and
transform it into a nonprofit field
school called the Inian Islands In
stitute, allowing students from
Stanford, other universities and
even high schools to take month
long experiential learning classes
on sustainability.
First, however, the group is
working to raise funds for the
project.
As of Wednesday night, a
crowdfunding campaign on the

site Indiegogo had generated
around $19,500. The campaign has
until Jan. 12 to amass the rest of
its $40,000 goal, an amount that
would go towards covering initial
expenses: for instance, an official
appraisal of the property, legal
fees to become a nonprofit, pro
motional materials and the ability
to invite potential donors to visit
the remote Alaskan site.
"It's an exciting thing to think
about: bringing students out into
the wilderness to think about
ecology and conservation and hu
man-environment interactions,"

Brown said.
The founding four
His parents both employed by
the National Parks Service,
Brown grew up in Gustavus, Ala.
The small coastal town has a pop
ulation of about 400 and is so iso
lated, Brown said, that his five
person basketball team had to fly
by bush planes to get to games.
Geographically close to Gus
tavus, however, are the Inian Is
lands. Brown said these islands
are uninhabited with one excep
tion: the Hobbit Hole, which sits

on a protected harbor and is com
prised of three houses, a work
shop and a dock.
For around 40 years, family
friends owned and lived on the
property, where they worked as
commercial fishermen. Three
years ago, however, they put the
land up for the sale, announcing
retirement from their labor-inten
sive lifestyle.
That's when the idea of estab
lishing an institute first came,
Brown said.
