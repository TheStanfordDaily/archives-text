## Off the Grid seeks expansion Food truck company faces pushback for Menlo Park plans 
### SAMANTHA LYNN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Off the Grid —a Bay Area food
truck management company offering
lunchtime food truck options here at
Stanford is seeking to expand into
Menlo Park despite pushback from lo
cal business owners.
Off the Grid applied in October for
a permit to set up a group of food
trucks in the parking lot of the Menlo
Park Caltrain station on Wednesday
nights. The Menlo Park Planning
Commission will review the applica
tion on Monday, Jan. 13.
Some Menlo Park merchants have
expressed concern over various conse
quences of Off the Grid's presence,
from sanitation to parking fees.
Kurt Ugur, the manager of the Ital
ian restaurant Trellis, said customers
stay at home instead of coming to eat
at his restaurant when streets are
crowded with downtown fairs. He wor
ries that Off the Grid will cause similar
problems.
"Who's going to provide parking
for 200 or 300 people?" Ugur said.
"They're going to block our city
streets, and I will not be able to get my
customers."
According to Off the Grid's Direc
tor of Business Development Ben
Hamlin, however, the company has
conducted an extensive parking analy
sis and concluded that parking will not
be a problem.
"One of the reasons why we have
authorization through Caltrain to use
the property is because we feel that
there is enough parking that will ac
commodate our needs for the market,"
Hamlin said.
Ugur said that he expects dozens of
local business owners to show up to the
Planning Commission meeting on
Monday to speak their minds in oppo
sition to Off the Grid. Hamlin points
out, however, that Off the Grid can ac
tually have a mutually beneficial rela
tionship with those businesses.
"Ultimately what we hope to do is
bring in a large amount of foot traffic
that will have a positive impact on the
surrounding businesses," Hamlin said.
He added that ideally, people from
outside the city who follow Off the Grid
or a particular food truck under their
management will be drawn to down
town Menlo Park. There, they will
have the opportunity to discover new
restaurants and other businesses to
which they can return.
"We're looking to create partner
ships. We're not looking to create com
petition or create bad feelings," Ham
lin said. "We're trying to create some
thing unique that can play a positive
role in a really cool area."
At Stanford, the company is still of
fering lunchtime food truck options on
West Campus. Last academic
year, one food truck per day was sta
tioned on Lomita Mall, but construc
tion has moved the trucks to the inter
section of Samuel Morris Way and
Panama Mall this year. Two
changing food trucks are
stationed there for lunch
daily.
Hamlin said this move
has caused some minor chal
lenges. Off the Grid tries to
capitalize on the visibility of
the trucks, which was re
duced when the trucks were
moved off Lomita Mall.

"Being in a location
where we can capture the
organic foot traffic that is
happening is really impor
tant for the success of the
vendors," Hamlin said.
Despite the move, the
trucks seem to be doing rel
atively well in the amount of
meals they're serving,
Hamlin added.
Lunchtime Off the Grid
trucks were well received
by members of the Stanford
community when they came
to campus last year. Howev
er, many reacted negatively

to the University's mobile
food vendor policy, which
forced some trucks off cam
pus when they were unable
to register with Off the
Grid.
Those trucks included
Mia's Catering and Net Ap
petit, which closed after the
Stanford University De
partment of Public Safety
(SUDPS) asked the truck's
owners not to return to the
Stanford campus.
