### ALEX ZIVKOVIC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week the California Supreme
Court made a landmark ruling that Sergio
Garcia and other undocumented immi
grants who have passed the bar exam must
be afforded a license by the state. Garcia
who was brought to the United States as a
baby but has permanently lived in Califor
nia since the age of 17 waiting for his visa
passed the bar exam in 2009. It's only after
the recent ruling that he will be granted his
license to practice law.
Daniel Siciliano J.D. 'O4, a Stanford Law
School professor of the practice of law,
spoke to The Daily concerning the court's

decision and its implications on furthering
immigration reform and the future of the
economy.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What was the
legal basis for the court's rationale?
Daniel Siciliano (DS): I didn't read the fi
nal case outcome, but I know that part of
the basis was that the federal determina
tion of his status meaning that he is here
in contravention of an existing statute
was insufficient to disallow him to be admit
ted to the bar.
It would have been a very different
thing if he entered unlawfully when he was,
let's say, 25. And it's also important to note
that his relationships with the United

States were very profound and deep. If he
had only entered the first time when he was
17 I think at the narrative level that would
have made a big difference.

TSD: What do you think will be the limita
tions Garcia will face after this?
DS: Now he has employability challenges.
So on the one hand he has been admitted to
the bar so he is licensed to practice law in
California and licensed to practice in the
United States as well under broader cir
cumstances, but he isn't readily able to be
employed since he is not eligible for em
ployment in the traditional sense because of
