# Q&A DANIEL SICILIANO
## STANFORD LAW SCHOOL PROFESSOR OF THE PRACTICE OF LAW 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week the California Supreme
Court made a landmark ruling that Sergio
Garcia and other undocumented immi
grants who have passed the bar exam must
be afforded a license by the state. Garcia
who was brought to the United States as a
baby but has permanently lived in Califor
nia since the age of 17 waiting for his visa
passed the bar exam in 2009. It's only after
the recent ruling that he will be granted his
license to practice law.
Daniel Siciliano J.D. 'O4, a Stanford Law
School professor of the practice of law,
spoke to The Daily concerning the court's

decision and its implications on furthering
immigration reform and the future of the
economy.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What was the
legal basis for the court's rationale?
Daniel Siciliano (DS): I didn't read the fi
nal case outcome, but I know that part of
the basis was that the federal determina
tion of his status meaning that he is here
in contravention of an existing statute
was insufficient to disallow him to be admit
ted to the bar.
It would have been a very different
thing if he entered unlawfully when he was,
let's say, 25. And it's also important to note
that his relationships with the United

States were very profound and deep. If he
had only entered the first time when he was
17 I think at the narrative level that would
have made a big difference.

TSD: What do you think will be the limita
tions Garcia will face after this?
DS: Now he has employability challenges.
So on the one hand he has been admitted to
the bar so he is licensed to practice law in
California and licensed to practice in the
United States as well under broader cir
cumstances, but he isn't readily able to be
employed since he is not eligible for em
ployment in the traditional sense because of

his undocumented status.
This is outside of any for
mal legal structure, but there
is an observed phenomena
among those who have been
in the United States for a
long time and are not docu
mented in the way that al
lows them to work, and that
is that a lot of people become
self-employed. And so it'll be
interesting to see if he goes
that route. I mean a lawyer
can hang out a shingle and
practice, so we'll have to wait
and see.
But at the moment his
biggest challenge is he's a
member of the bar, he's a re
al lawyer and he can't work
for a law firm, and they
haven't sorted that out to my
knowledge.

TSD: Are there any econom
ic implications behind this de
cision?
DS: This is really relevant for
economic and policy develop
ment. One of the things we
know about immigration
documented, undocumented,
skilled and highly skilled
is that when you analyze [im
migrants'] net contributions
to the economy they tend to
grow the economy.
One of the interesting
pieces... is that the more ed
ucation an immigrant has,
the little bit more of a multi
plier that contribution has on
average not always, but to

a certain extent, like doctors,
engineers with master's de
grees and so on and so forth.

It isn't all that often that
you have an undocumented
cohort of immigrants, I think,
overlapping with lots of ad
vanced degrees, but it turns
out that there is someone
who happens to have been
undocumented, has an ad
vanced degree, a J.D., and if
you don't let him practice law
then you've actually man
aged to strip out the advan
tage of his contribution to the
economy. One question
you're asking is, "Is this good
for other people in the econo
my who were born in the
United States of America
and are not immigrants?"
The answer is, if you let him
practice law, probably. If you
don't let him practice law,
maybe not.

TSD: Similar cases are going
to be reviewed in New York
and Florida. How do you
think those cases will go?
DS: Both of those I suspect
would act more like Califor
nia than not. We'll see where
it goes and it'll be interesting
to see what happens if it
crops up in a state like Ari
zona or in other states that
tend to be viewed as more
conservative towards their
reactions towards undocu
mented immigrants. I don't
know how that will turn out
but we'll be debating it for at
least a month or two. Which
is good.
