## SEEING GREEN Bubbling Away 
### Holly Moeller 
I live in fear of my tiny gas stove.
It's the first gas range I've ever
lived with, and every day I
come home to it carefully sniffing
for gas leaks and feeling faintly re
lieved that it hasn't blown up my
apartment in my absence. I stand
as far back as possible when turn
ing it on, and startle every time a
burner finally catches. In my
kitchen, the stove calls the shots.
Most of my friends don't seem
to share my perfectly rational ter
ror; after all, the natural gas that
powers my stove is an important
and familiar energy source in many
other aspects of our lives. And
methane, the simple molecule that
makes up the majority of natural
gas, is also a major player in our at
mosphere.
Although methane makes up
less than a thousandth of a percent
of the air around and above us, its
total global warming punch is third
in line behind only water vapor and
the notorious carbon dioxide.
That's because, gram for gram,
methane has 20 times the warming
potential of carbon dioxide.
And, while methane concentra
tions are low, they're still twice
what they were just a couple hun
dred years ago (before the Indus
trial Revolution). And they're ris
ing.
This rise is mostly driven by hu
man activities that release
methane, like rice farming and ani
mal husbandry (wet paddies and
cow guts are both full of methane
generating bacteria). But scientists
worry that, in a future, warmer
world, more methane could come
from wetlands and shallow ocean
basins in the Arctic.
Normally, these places are cold
very cold. In fact, they're sealed
by a layer of ground that's frozen
all year round, aptly named "per
mafrost." A lot of carbon has been
stored up in these regions, accumu
lated by plants during their bursts
of summer growth, then sealed in
by freezing that slows down the
natural decay of the dead stems
and leaves.
Over millennia, wetlands and
permafrost soils have tucked away
two times the amount of carbon as
what's currently floating around in
our atmosphere.
But for how long?
Warmer temperatures are melt
ing the permafrost all around the
pole, unsealing the cap on these
carbon stores. Some of the dead or
ganic carbon will be released as
carbon dioxide; much may leak out
as methane.
Since these gases will also con
tribute to the greenhouse gas effect
and the net warming of the polar
regions, further melting the per
mafrost, this could lead to a run
away self-reinforcing feedback
loop.
To understand the magnitude of
this problem, you first have to un
derstand how this methane might
be released. And in order to do
that, as a scientific report published
late last year explains, you have to
know something about bubbles.
The shallow seas that ring the
Arctic Ocean rest on beds of sedi
ment that are filled with methane.
Though we've long believed that
these methane sources, too, were
capped by permafrost, the new
study reveals that, at least in some
places, they're not. Which
means that methane gas bubbles
can form and, where conditions are
right, float to the surface and spill
all that greenhouse gas potential
directly into the atmosphere.
How fast these bubbles drift to
the surface depends a lot on local
conditions. Imagine sticking a
straw into a jar of syrup. You have
to blow a mighty big bubble before
it breaks off the tip of your straw
and rises.
And plenty of tiny bubbles are
almost stationary in the thick liq
uid. On a finer scale, that's what's
happening in the ocean, too: Big
bubbles rise faster than small ones.
And storms which could become
more frequent and more severe
with changing climate acceler
ate the bubbling process by shak
ing up the whole system.
By making a series of careful
measurements of bubble flux,
storm effects and methane concen
trations, the authors of the new re
search more than doubled their
previous estimate of methane re
lease off the coast of Russia. Each
year, they say, at least 17 million
tons (17 Tg) of methane are re
leased from the East Siberian Arc
tic Shelf.
The number sounds big and
indeed it is. But it's only a small
fraction of total "natural" methane
release, at 180 Tg per year. And
when you add in human activities,
globally the land and sea exhale 440

Tg annually.
Yet the potential for imbalance
remains alarming, especially given
methane's greenhouse gas potency.
Unlike my visions of a spontaneous
ly combusting kitchenette, run
away Arctic thawing is a real fear
and one that's worth keeping an
eye on as it simmers on the back
burner.

carbon stores. Some of the dead or
ganic carbon will be released as
carbon dioxide; much may leak out
as methane.
Since these gases will also con
tribute to the greenhouse gas effect
and the net warming of the polar
regions, further melting the per
mafrost, this could lead to a run
away self-reinforcing feedback
loop.
To understand the magnitude of
this problem, you first have to un
derstand how this methane might
be released. And in order to do
that, as a scientific report published
late last year explains, you have to
know something about bubbles.
The shallow seas that ring the
Arctic Ocean rest on beds of sedi
ment that are filled with methane.
Though we've long believed that
these methane sources, too, were
capped by permafrost, the new
study reveals that, at least in some
places, they're not. Which
means that methane gas bubbles
can form and, where conditions are
right, float to the surface and spill
all that greenhouse gas potential
directly into the atmosphere.
How fast these bubbles drift to
the surface depends a lot on local
conditions. Imagine sticking a
straw into a jar of syrup. You have
to blow a mighty big bubble before
it breaks off the tip of your straw
and rises.
And plenty of tiny bubbles are
almost stationary in the thick liq
uid. On a finer scale, that's what's
happening in the ocean, too: Big
bubbles rise faster than small ones.
And storms which could become
more frequent and more severe
with changing climate acceler
ate the bubbling process by shak
ing up the whole system.
By making a series of careful
measurements of bubble flux,
storm effects and methane concen
trations, the authors of the new re
search more than doubled their
previous estimate of methane re
lease off the coast of Russia. Each
year, they say, at least 17 million
tons (17 Tg) of methane are re
leased from the East Siberian Arc
tic Shelf.
The number sounds big and
indeed it is. But it's only a small
fraction of total "natural" methane
release, at 180 Tg per year. And
when you add in human activities,
globally the land and sea exhale 440

Tg annually.
Yet the potential for imbalance
remains alarming, especially given
methane's greenhouse gas potency.
Unlike my visions of a spontaneous
ly combusting kitchenette, run
away Arctic thawing is a real fear
and one that's worth keeping an
eye on as it simmers on the back
burner.

I live in fear of my tiny gas stove.
It's the first gas range I've ever
lived with, and every day I
come home to it carefully sniffing
for gas leaks and feeling faintly re
lieved that it hasn't blown up my
apartment in my absence. I stand
as far back as possible when turn
ing it on, and startle every time a
burner finally catches. In my
kitchen, the stove calls the shots.
Most of my friends don't seem
to share my perfectly rational ter
ror; after all, the natural gas that
powers my stove is an important
and familiar energy source in many
other aspects of our lives. And
methane, the simple molecule that
makes up the majority of natural
gas, is also a major player in our at
mosphere.
Although methane makes up
less than a thousandth of a percent
of the air around and above us, its
total global warming punch is third
in line behind only water vapor and
the notorious carbon dioxide.
That's because, gram for gram,
methane has 20 times the warming
potential of carbon dioxide.
And, while methane concentra
tions are low, they're still twice
what they were just a couple hun
dred years ago (before the Indus
trial Revolution). And they're ris
ing.
This rise is mostly driven by hu
man activities that release
methane, like rice farming and ani
mal husbandry (wet paddies and
cow guts are both full of methane
generating bacteria). But scientists
worry that, in a future, warmer
world, more methane could come
from wetlands and shallow ocean
basins in the Arctic.
Normally, these places are cold
very cold. In fact, they're sealed
by a layer of ground that's frozen
all year round, aptly named "per
mafrost." A lot of carbon has been
stored up in these regions, accumu
lated by plants during their bursts
of summer growth, then sealed in
by freezing that slows down the
natural decay of the dead stems
and leaves.
Over millennia, wetlands and
permafrost soils have tucked away
two times the amount of carbon as
what's currently floating around in
our atmosphere.
But for how long?
Warmer temperatures are melt
ing the permafrost all around the
pole, unsealing the cap on these
carbon stores. Some of the dead or
ganic carbon will be released as
carbon dioxide; much may leak out
as methane.
Since these gases will also con
tribute to the greenhouse gas effect
and the net warming of the polar
regions, further melting the per
mafrost, this could lead to a run
away self-reinforcing feedback
loop.
