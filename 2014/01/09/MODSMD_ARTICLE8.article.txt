# OP-ED
## Hidden in Plain Sight: Disabilities at Stanford 
### â€“ Jen Ehrlich '16 Jen Ehrlich 
"V T"ou have to get a GED." I
Y suspect that few, if any,
-1. Stanford students ever
received this pronouncement. Yet
there I was being told by my high
school guidance counselor that the
highest educational achievement I
could hope for was a high school
equivalence degree. This, after I
had been expelled from my prep
school for "being too sick."
Why didn't I just get a GED? A
far better question is why my se
vere chronic illness led to the con
clusion that a GED was my only op
tion.
We need only to turn on the tel
evision to see that our society is ob
sessed with youth and beauty.
The flipside to this obsession is
fear and abhorrence of illness and
disability. The idea that children
can suffer from disabilities is too
horrifying for many to accept, so
they refuse to deal with it. But de
nial cannot deny reality. At Stan
ford about 15 percent of under
graduates suffer from a disability,
and 70 percent of those disabilities
are "invisible." When, at age 11,1
began suffering from mysterious
stomach pains and crippling fa
tigue, I became an adolescent with
a hidden disability.
It took years for me to be diag
nosed with an autonomic nervous
system disorder called Postural Or
thostatic Tachycardia Syndrome
(POTS); in that time I had become
bedridden. My body had broken
but my mind was still mine, and yet
that was not enough for my prep
school, my public school or my
guidance counselors. Since I could
not sit in a classroom for seven
hours or expose myself to germs, I
was told I could not hope to take
advanced classes, graduate high
school or apply to colleges.
I was lucky. I had parents who

believed in me and found an alter
native high school that was able to
send a teacher to my house while I
worked to improve my health. I will
never be normal; my body will nev
er be as strong as my peers', but
last fall I enrolled as a freshman at
Stanford and now I am here. It's a
happy story an uplifting story
but it is not a story that had a
happy "THE END" banner cross
ing the screen when I came to cam
pus. I still have and forever will
have POTS and it affects me all day,
every day.
But why does this matter? What
does it have to do with you the
normal, healthy college student?
There is a lack of awareness at
Stanford about the daily struggles
of students with disabilities. The
fact that I have to take a reduced
course load and can't party every
night is baffling to many of my
peers.
This lack of awareness is detri
mental to students suffering from
disabilities. It is also a wasted op
portunity for our classmates. Stan
ford students are future leaders in
politics, technology, business, law,
medicine and education, and it is
particularly important that they
understand the inherent potential
of and limitations imposed on peo
ple with disabilities.
Stanford students are future ed
ucators who can ensure that sick
kids don't have to fight to fulfill
their academic potential despite
physical limitations. Stanford stu
dents are future inventors who can
create technologies to allow the dis
abled to participate more fully in
life. Stanford students are future
politicians who can ensure that
schools have the resources and in
formation to understand why edu
cating all students matters. Stan
ford students are future doctors

who can help their patients realize
that their illness doesn't get to de
fine them.
In the years since the Ameri
cans with Disabilities Act was
passed great strides have been
made in our country's treatment of
the disabled, but we have a long
way to go. If the Stanford commu
nity were more aware of the chal
lenges facing disabled students,
Stanford grads would be more like
ly to use their intelligence, passion
and world-class education to help
this population.
Awareness won't come out of
thin air and it won't come from a
single op-ed. In order to take full
advantage of our resources the
University itself needs to make
awareness a priority.
There are many ways Stanford
could help. The simplest would be
to include disabled students at
freshman orientation events such
as FACES; not only a student with
visible disability, but also a student
who, like me, is constantly told "but
you don't look sick."
Stanford has a wonderful Office
of Accessible Education providing
services that allow me and others
like me to excel. The OAE, howev
er, is fairly invisible until an accept
ance letter arrives. The University

ought to celebrate its commitment
to the disabled community, act
proactively to attract talented stu
dents with disabilities and inspire
other colleges to follow our lead.
Finally, it is crucially important
for the University to make it clear
that students receiving disability
accommodations are not gaming the
system. An analogy I use to explain
the limitations of POTS is: Imagine
you wake up each morning with 12
spoons. On a good day, each spoon
counts for one full activity: break
fast/shower/getting dressed and to
class, sitting in one class, complet
ing one homework assignment.
On a bad day one spoon is re
quired to get out of bed, another to
eat breakfast, another to shower
and another to get to class. Re
member, you only have 12 spoons
and when they are gone, they're
gone and you can't replace them or
bargain for another.
Imagine making this calculation
all day, every day, and then recon
sider if my living in graduate hous
ing or getting extensions on an oc
casional essay is "pulling some
thing off." If students were aware
of what living with a serious illness
means there would be less ignorant
comments, and more compassion.
As a member of a hidden com
munity I think it is vital that our
university see the value in system
atically educating students about
the reality of the disabled and
chronically ill. This is not an ab
stract and far off issue. It is a prob
lem that affects hundreds of thou
sands of Americans: young and old,
rich and poor, and more of your
classmates than you may think.
