## Stanford begins title quest at Cal 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
No. 3 Stanford men's gymnastics,
armed with the talent to compete for an
NCAA title, begins its 2014 season Satur
day at No. 7 Cal in Berkeley.
The Cardinal is coming off an impres

sive third-place finish at the NCAA Champi
onships in University Park, Pa., last April.
Stanford will have to replace the pro
duction of Eddie Penev 'l3, who graduated
as a three-time national champion and nine
time All-American. Penev was an all-around
star for the Cardinal and consistently domi
nated on the floor exercise.

The Cardinal does return one standout
from last year's championship events: jun
ior Brian Knott. Knott scored a career-best
15.450 in the parallel bars in the team finals
for a first-place finish, and Saturday will pro
vide an opportunity to see how that effort
propelled him in the offseason.
Another upperclassman to
watch out for is senior Sean Sen
ters. Senters has two seasons of
eligibility left after a redshirting in
2011, and he has already estab
lished himself as one of the top
gymnasts in the country. Senters
earned All-America honors in
2012 and 2013 for his perform
ance on the floor exercise and
added All-American status on the
vault in 2013.
Saturday's matchup with Cal
will also provide a first look at the
Cardinal's new freshman class.
Stanford has six freshmen on the
team, and all will look to make an
impact early.
The season is filled with

tough challenges for Stanford.
The Card faces No. 7 Cal on con
secutive Saturdays to open the
season, first in Berkeley and then
at Stanford. Then Stanford hosts a
tournament that will see Cal,
Washington and No. 1 Michigan
come to the Farm.
In the team's first competi
tion after the tournament, Stan
ford heads to Norman, Okla., to
take on the No. 2 Oklahoma
Sooners. The end result: By Feb.
8, Stanford will have faced the
No. 1, No. 2 and No. 7 teams in
the country in competition.
Stanford's season begins at
Cal Saturday at 1 p.m. in a meet
that will be televised on Pac-12
Networks. The Cardinal's home
opener is set for Jan. 18 at 4 p.m.,
also against Cal.
