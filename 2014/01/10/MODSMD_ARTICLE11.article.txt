## MEN'S BASKETBALL Another step back Cardinal sluggish in loss at unheralded Oregon State 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Despite an outstanding offensive per
formance by junior guard Chasson Randle,
the Stanford men's basketball team suffered
its most disappointing loss of the season on
Thursday night, falling to the Oregon State
Beavers 81-72 in Corvallis, Ore. The loss
drops Stanford (9-5) to 0-2 in the Pac-12,
while the Beavers (9-6) move to 1-2 in the
conference.

Stanford was outplayed by Oregon State
from start to finish, falling behind early and
struggling late in a forgettable performance
that could trigger the wheels of change for
the program. Despite entering the game last
in the conference in rebounding margin and
3-point field goal percentage defense, the
Beavers outrebounded the Cardinal 38-33
and held Stanford to a paltry 2-for-8 from
behind the arc, proving that the Cardinal
was both out-hustled and out-executed by a
less talented team.

Junior forward Eric Moreland, playing in
just his third game of the season, proved to
be Stanford's foil, registering a monster per
formance with 17 points, 15 rebounds, four
assists and four blocks. He had plenty of sup
port from the Pac-12's leading scorer, Rober
to Nelson, who met his average by pouring
in 21 points on 6-of-12 shooting, and fresh
man Hallice Cooke, who had a career-high
16 points in his first ever start for the
Beavers.
As has sometimes been the
case this season, a terrific individ
ual effort by Randle wasn't
enough to save the Cardinal. Stan
ford's leading scorer finished the
night with 30 points on 10-for-18
shooting and was a perfect 9-for-9
from the free throw line. Senior
forward Dwight Powell added 13
points and 10 rebounds for Stan
ford, but shot just 4-for-ll from
the field and turned the ball over
a season-high six times.

OSU outshot Stanford 47.2
percent to 41.4 percent and was a
terrific 8-for-15 from 3-point
range. The difference in the 3-
point shooting alone was enough
to make up the final deficit of the
game, a surprising result consider
ing the strengths of the two teams
entering the game. Stanford had
entered the contest second in the
conference in 3-point field goal
percentage, but that advantage

hardly showed on this night.

The Cardinal started the
game slowly, falling behind quick
ly 12-6 thanks to three baskets by
Nelson, before slowly crawling its
way back into the contest. Stan
ford actually took a 15-14 lead
with 10:41 remaining in the half
on a jumper by Randle but the
Beavers quickly regained control
of the game with a 13-3 run to
give themselves a 27-18 lead with
7:03 left in the half. Stanford was
eventually able to whittle the lead
to five by halftime, 37-32, after
Randle scored once more with
two seconds remaining.

Much of the second half
proved to be a back-and-forth af
fair until Stanford went on a 12-
6 run to cut the Oregon State
lead to two with 10:55 left to
play. Oregon State answered im
mediately, and a 3-pointer by
Cooke and a layup by Moreland
reestablished the Beavers' lead at
seven.
Senior Anthony Brown's 3-
pointer with 4:27 to play once
again reduced OSU's lead to two

and a 3-point play by Randle with
2:59 left restored that same
deficit, but a killer sequence that
saw OSU outscore Stanford 5-0
over a one-minute stretch essen
tially put the Cardinal to bed.

It was Stanford's first defeat
to Oregon State in its last five
contests, ending a streak that
spanned the past two seasons.
Moving forward, the Cardi
nal must turn its attention to the
No. 17 Oregon Ducks, a tough
task to handle following a disap
pointing defeat such as the one
endured on Thursday night. If it's
any consolation for the Cardinal,
the Ducks (13-2, 1-2) are playing
their worst basketball of the sea
son at the moment, having
dropped their second consecu
tive home game on Thursday
night to Cal. Stanford will hope
to exploit whatever is ailing Ore
gon and defeat the Ducks to turn
around what has been yet anoth
er disappointing start to a season.

Guard Chasson Randle (above) scored 30 points, yet the Card was outmatched
in an 81-72 loss at Oregon State on Thursday night. It wasn't the
first time this year that a strong performance by the junior went to waste.
