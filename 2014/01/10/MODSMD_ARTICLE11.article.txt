## MEN'S BASKETBALL Another step back Cardinal sluggish in loss at unheralded Oregon State 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Despite an outstanding offensive per
formance by junior guard Chasson Randle,
the Stanford men's basketball team suffered
its most disappointing loss of the season on
Thursday night, falling to the Oregon State
Beavers 81-72 in Corvallis, Ore. The loss
drops Stanford (9-5) to 0-2 in the Pac-12,
while the Beavers (9-6) move to 1-2 in the
conference.

Stanford was outplayed by Oregon State
from start to finish, falling behind early and
struggling late in a forgettable performance
that could trigger the wheels of change for
the program. Despite entering the game last
in the conference in rebounding margin and
3-point field goal percentage defense, the
Beavers outrebounded the Cardinal 38-33
and held Stanford to a paltry 2-for-8 from
behind the arc, proving that the Cardinal
was both out-hustled and out-executed by a
less talented team.

Junior forward Eric Moreland, playing in
just his third game of the season, proved to
be Stanford's foil, registering a monster per
formance with 17 points, 15 rebounds, four
assists and four blocks. He had plenty of sup
port from the Pac-12's leading scorer, Rober
to Nelson, who met his average by pouring
in 21 points on 6-of-12 shooting, and fresh
man Hallice Cooke, who had a career-high
16 points in his first ever start for the
Beavers.
