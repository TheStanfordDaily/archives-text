# MEN'S TENNIS
## Card hits the courts 
### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Cardinal looks forward to the dawning
of the new men's tennis season this winter, hoping to
build upon last year's performance, when the team was
eliminated in the first round of the NCAA Tournament by
the Louisiana State Tigers. The Cardinal goes into the sea
son unranked in the Coaches' Poll, but checks in at No. 41
in the ITA's more extensive rankings, which would place it
on track for a fourth-place finish in the Pac-12 conference.

The Cardinal returns the core of its team from last
year, however, losing no one who played a conference sin
gles match for the team in the 2012-13 season, while also
introducing a three-man freshman class that consists of
former Ohio state champion Yale Goldberg, high school
Ail-American Brandon Sutter and Roy Lederman. Gold
berg has made a good start to his career on the Farm so
far, finishing preseason tournament play with a record of
5-2 in doubles.
