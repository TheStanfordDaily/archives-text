# MEN'S TENNIS
## Card hits the courts 
### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Cardinal looks forward to the dawning
of the new men's tennis season this winter, hoping to
build upon last year's performance, when the team was
eliminated in the first round of the NCAA Tournament by
the Louisiana State Tigers. The Cardinal goes into the sea
son unranked in the Coaches' Poll, but checks in at No. 41
in the ITA's more extensive rankings, which would place it
on track for a fourth-place finish in the Pac-12 conference.

The Cardinal returns the core of its team from last
year, however, losing no one who played a conference sin
gles match for the team in the 2012-13 season, while also
introducing a three-man freshman class that consists of
former Ohio state champion Yale Goldberg, high school
Ail-American Brandon Sutter and Roy Lederman. Gold
berg has made a good start to his career on the Farm so
far, finishing preseason tournament play with a record of
5-2 in doubles.

2013 second-team All-Pac-12 selection John Morrissey (above) headlines an experienced
core of Cardinal players as Stanford's men's tennis season begins next week.
Although Stanford does not currently
have a player in the ITA singles rankings, it
will look to junior John Morrissey to pace the
team. The Irishman, who was a second-team
Pac-12 selection last year and finished the
year ranked No. 58 in singles and No. 52 in
doubles, went 11-9 in the No. 1 spot last
year and will look to build upon that record
in 2014.

Morrissey will be ably assisted by fellow
junior Robert Stineman, who was a first
team Pac-12 All-Academic selection last
year. Stineman, from Winnetka, 111, finished
the season with an 18-17 record and part
nered with current sophomore Maciek Ra
monowicz to a 16-9 record in doubles play.
Finally, the Cardinal will also look to its
four-man sophomore class to carry a heavy
part of the burden as the new season ap

proaches, with Romanowicz, Anthony
Tsodikov, Nolan Paige and Trey Strobel being
looked upon to profit from the experience
they gained last year.
All four sophomores have started well
in the preseason, with the team of Paige and
Strobel opening the ledger with a 4-1 record
in doubles and Romanowicz and Tsodikov
combining for a singles record of 12-4. Both
Strobel and Tsodikov have singles victories
against nationally ranked opponents as well.
If Stanford is to have a successful season go
ing forward, these sophomores will have to
continue taking strides in 2014.
Stanford hopes to open the season with
a bang in its first match on Jan. 14, as it
hosts the Pacific Tigers at 1:30 p.m. The
Cardinal then heads to Thousand Oaks,
Calif., for the prestigious Sherwood Cup,
where its players will face off against oppo
nents from four of the nation's top collegiate
programs.
