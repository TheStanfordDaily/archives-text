# 'Instant classic' overused
## 
### Winston Shi 
Instant classics were once rare
and few and far between. Once
upon a time, before television,
I'd imagine that classics weren't
just games you talked about after
the final whistle for hours on end;
they were games you memorialized
in print, video and, ultimately, mem
ory. The word classic used to have
meaning.
That time is gone.

One of the benefits of television
is that we've been able to preserve
and remember more games than
ever before. With thousands of cable
channels up and running, there are
simply more opportunities to broad
cast flashes from the past. ESPN Clas
sic, the Pac-12 Networks, Texas'
Longhorn Network and so many oth
er enterprises need to fill screen
time, and history fills that role in ad
mirable fashion.
But the era of television is simul
taneously the era of saturation.
Though I appreciate football's history
and love watching its memories of
the past, television has viciously dis
torted our perspective our ability
to see the ordinary and the legendary
and know why the two are not the
same.

In an age when nearly any de
cent game will be replayed over and
over again, our newfound capacity for
memory has exceeded our capacity
for wonder. When ESPN's Ivan
Maisel visited The Daily to talk about
his forty-year sportswriting career, he
mentioned how, for a man like him

who's seen it all, the momentary glories of to
day are often not so readily apparent.
Maisel has the perspective that so many
lack. Just this week I called the Stanford-Michi
gan State Rose Bowl an "instant classic" but
with the benefit of a more objective hindsight,
it seems like a good game with a disappointing
result, nothing more and nothing less. The ti
tles "legendary" or "classic" are not words to be
thrown around lightly; on the contrary, individ
ual games deserve the same exacting scrutiny
that I have held to Stanford's rivalries in the
past. To call the Rose Bowl a classic is to put it
on the same pedestal as Vince Young taking
down USC in 2006 or Miami-Nebraska in
1984. Here is my mea culpa: Calling so many
games instant classics demeans those that actu
ally are.
This is the fifth or perhaps the 50th consec
utive year that we have predicted a "Game of the
Century," and, by definition, we will be let down
more often than not. To a certain degree these
dreams speak well of us: We ought to aspire to
greatness and to hope that every game we see is
one that we will long remember.
Yet the fact remains that the hype and the
mass media of television, our crass new pomp
and pageantry, ultimately detract from what
nevertheless remains a beautiful game.
We blamed the Bowl Championship Series

(BCS) and not the teams on the field because in
the end, we knew that the BCS was our imper
fect solution to our difficult problem. After
years of endless national championship de
bates, the BCS promised America that a game
featuring the two highest-ranked teams in the
country must inevitably be good. As it turned
out, so much of the attention off the field only
served to distort the drama unfolding upon it.
Is that curious myopia the fault of modernity?
No. It is ours and that means that it is also
within our power to reverse it. The BCS is now
gone. Whether its successor will be any better
is a question I certainly cannot answer.
The BCS and the coming College Football
Playoff are both designed to produce a "better,"
"truer" national champion. However, by at
tempting to make national championships real
and not "mythical," they have also committed
themselves to the business of alchemy. Both
systems are trying to crown champions, and in
doing so they are attempting to replicate the
necessary conditions for greatness.
I don't mean to get into an argument about
whether a national championship can or cannot
truly exist that is a question for another day.
I do think, however, that the concept of the na
tional championship matters a great deal and
yet not as much as we think. The dream of im
mortality is the foundational aspiration of col
lege football, and national championships are a
part of that dream but only a part. Flags fly
forever, to be sure, but we don't cheer for flags.
The true failure of the BCS was that mak
ing one bowl a national championship game did

not necessarily carve that game into legend.
Though elevated by the matchup, a great set
ting still had to be matched by a legendary
game and, like Woolf's matches struck unex
pectedly in the dark, it did so very rarely. That
stubborn exclusivity of fate is ultimately why
classics matter. Still, we can safely say that with
out the BCS, Auburn and Florida State would

never have clashed on Jan. 6. We are all very
thankful for that.

When Winston Shi once unexpectedly struck a
match in the dark, he accidentally burned down
The Stanford Daily's shrine to Lane Kiffin. Sug
