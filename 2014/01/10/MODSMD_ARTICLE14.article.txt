## Pair passes on NFL 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
Both senior defensive end Henry Ander
son and senior inside linebacker A.J. Tarpley
have announced that they will not declare for
the NFL draft and will instead return for
their final year of eligibility at Stanford.
Tarpley, who will likely start for his
fourth consecutive season in 2014, finished
his 2013 campaign second on the team with
93 tackles. He leads all Cardinal defenders

past and present —with 216 total tackles
since the start of the 2011 season. In addi
tion to providing a firm presence in the mid
dle of the front seven in defending the run,
Tarpley has made a name for himself with his
pass coverage in a conference with some of
the most dynamic quarterbacks in the nation.
The return of Tarpley and his experience
will be huge for a linebacking corps that will
lose three stalwarts in fifth-year seniors

Shanye Skov, Trent Murphy and Jarek Lan
caster during this off-season. He will provide
a veteran presence in the unit that will likely
help senior Joe Hemschoot and sophomore
Blake Martinez adjust to increased playing
time alongside him.

Anderson's experience will also be criti
cal for a relatively unproven defensive line
that will lose primary contributors in fifth
year seniors Ben Gardner and Josh Mauro.
After Anderson was named to the All-Pac-12
Second Team in 2012, a knee injury side
lined him early this season. He returned just
in time to bolster a battered defensive line
late in the year.

When he last played a full season in
2012, Anderson led the defensive line with
51 tackles and only got stronger as the sea
son progressed, becoming one of the corner
stones of the Cardinal's front seven with
most of his tackles for loss and sacks coming
after the midpoint of the season.

Senior free safety Ed Reynolds, senior
offensive guard David Yankey and senior of
fensive tackle Cameron Fleming have not
yet announced their intentions for the

2014 season.
