## From Stage to Screen: "August Osage County" 
### GILLIE COLLINS 
// II ugust: Osage
a m II County," John
I I Wells' film adap
tation of a
Pulitzer Prize-
I â–  winning play by
Tracy Letts, opens with a
monologue in which Bev West
on (Sam Shepherd) sums up his
marriage: "My wife takes pills,
and I drink," he says. "That is
the bargain we've struck." It is
also the bargain he breaks,
when he disappears and, appar
ently, takes his own life. "Au
gust: Osage County" is a por
trait of the family he leaves be
hind its dysfunction and
self-immolation.

The film takes place almost
entirely in the Westons' dilapi
dated house in northeastern
Oklahoma. Bev and his wife, Vi
olet (Meryl Streep), have been
living or, rather, dying in
the house for years. Violet is a
cancer victim, whose pain has
driven her to depression, pills,
insolence. Bev was a poet, a
one-hit wonder who commit
ted his life to drinking follow
ing the success of his first
book, "Meadowlark."
When Bev goes missing,
the couple's extended family
descends on the house, includ
ing their three daughters (Julia
Roberts, Juliette Lewis and Ju
lian Nicholson) and their re
spective partners (Ewan Mc-
Gregor, Dermot McGregor and
Benedict Cumberbatch). Every

one brings his or her own
grudges, vices and heartaches
to the family living room. Ex
plosion ensues.

During a marathon family
dinner, Violet lashes out at
each and every guest, hitting
each of them where it hurts
most. She bashes her deceased
husband, makes a play for his
bequest and accuses her chil
dren of squandering their privi
lege. Streep's performance is
remarkable. She bites her nails,
sings to herself and gesticulates
wildly. Violet is at once de
ranged and lucid; through it all,
she maintains a knack for illu-

minating the family secrets no
one knows she knows. By the
end of the dinner, Violet and
her daughter, Barbara
(Roberts), are wrestling, thrash
ing and scratching each other
on the floor.
It is understandable, then,
that the film's cast has been
criticized for its Oscar-greedy
melodrama. To me, though, the
movie's shamelessness and vol
ume are part of its value. Like
Violet's commitment to "truth
tellin" at the dinner table, Tracy
Letts wrote a play that stripped
the American family of affect
and exposed its skeletons. Its
onscreen rendition does his
project justice.

As it turns out, the West
ons' secrets run the gamut
from divorce and adultery to in
cest and pedophilia, but sub-
