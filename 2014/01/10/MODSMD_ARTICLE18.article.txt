# THE 						NEW MISSION THEATRE
## SF staple gets a revamp thanks to Texas company 
### MARY CAROLE OVERHOLT 
Located in the Mission District
of San Francisco, the New Mis
sion Theater stands as a rem
nant of a once vibrant commu
nity. Constructed in 1910, this
art deco-style theater once
served as a community center for
entertainment. Today, Alamo Draft
house Cinema is taking enterprising
steps to restore this historic land
mark to its original iconic status.

Based out of Austin, Texas,
Alamo Drafthouse Cinema special
izes in creating an eclectic movie ex
perience. In addition to screening
a variety of modern and older
movies, Alamo Drafthouse the
aters serve dinner and drinks with
each movie showing. With his wild
success in Texas, Alamo Draft
house CEO Tim League's next

step seemed obvious: going to Cali
fornia. For League, expanding the
company's unique dining, drinking
and movie viewing experience to
California seemed natural. The city
where his parents met, San Francis
co, is League's self-proclaimed fa
vorite city in the world, and when an
opportunity to build a theater there
arose, League pounced on it.
"I got a heads up from an old
college friend of mine who lived in
the Mission," League said. "I made a
trip out to San Francisco only a
month afterwards to cruise around
the neighborhood."

Because of its inclusion on the
National Register of Historical
Places, the New Mission Theater
presented itself as a project with
many strings attached. Carried out
by the Turnbull & Page architecture
firm, the Historic Research Determi

nation was submitted to the San
Francisco Planning Department and
approved in January 2013 by its Ar
chitectural Review Committee.

According to Jay Turnbull, prin
cipal partner of Turnbull & Page, the
firm had to start its evaluation "from
the outside in, with the most impor
tant things first, so that when [it]
had this list, [the firm] could figure
out ways that the building could be
changed without necessarily com
promising the most important
pieces."

To League, the most important
piece of the theater was obvious:
the iconic New Mission Theater
sign. As League described it, this ex
terior sign stands as a "staggering
icon" of community entertainment
in the past. While much emphasis

has been placed on refurbishing the
facade, restoration will extend to the
interior of the building. The inside of
the theater boasts details like art deco
metalwork, Greek key-motif plaster
moldings and ornate pilasters, all of
which are deemed "character-defining
features" by the San Francisco Plan
ning Department.

According to project architect
Richard Weiss, restoration of the New
Mission Theater was more extensive
than the restoration of the Alamo
Drafthouse's flagship theater, the Ritz,
in Austin, Texas.

As opposed to regulations in
Texas, Weiss commented that "in Cali
fornia, you have to look at the histori
cal value of each surface," interior and
exterior. While this approach undoubt
edly spiked costs, League said, "I agree

with that, and I'm happy this project
still makes financial sense even in un
dertaking the historic renovation."
Though meticulous emphasis was
placed on preserving physical details of
the building, Tim League made his pri
mary intention clear.

"We want to be a community, cul
tural center for the neighborhood,"
League said. The biggest alter
ations to the building were made in ef
fort to preserve the historical spirit of
the theater. Instead of keeping the ven
ue a single-screen theater, Alamo
Drafthouse split the interior into five
different cinemas. Two cinemas will be
fairly large in size, and the remaining
three will be what League calls "micro
cinemas."

With the division of one large the
ater into five smaller theaters comes
the ability for Alamo Drafthouse to run
their usual program of movies. From
old films to arts films to modern, pop
ular films, this cinema will appeal to
the diverse interests of the Mission

District community.
"Films usually play for six weeks,"
Weiss explained. "We didn't want the
family living down the road to only be
able to visit the theater once every six
weeks until the next movie came out."

Months away from completing
the theater, League has already worked
to involve the community. "We hosted
a couple of community forums where
people toured the facility before we
started our work," League stated, "and
we have somebody that's a community
liaison that's there, taking the voice of
the community."

Through the process of restoring
the New Mission Theater, Alamo
Drafthouse is embracing what Turnbull
calls "the real kernel of why we hold
on to historic buildings: They populate
our memory and form our imagina
tion, and to lose all of them would be
a real shame."
