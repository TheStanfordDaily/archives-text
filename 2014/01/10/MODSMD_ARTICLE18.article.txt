# THE
						NEW MISSION THEATRE
## SF staple gets a revamp thanks to Texas company 
### MARY CAROLE OVERHOLT 
Located in the Mission District
of San Francisco, the New Mis
sion Theater stands as a rem
nant of a once vibrant commu
nity. Constructed in 1910, this
art deco-style theater once
served as a community center for
entertainment. Today, Alamo Draft
house Cinema is taking enterprising
steps to restore this historic land
mark to its original iconic status.

Based out of Austin, Texas,
Alamo Drafthouse Cinema special
izes in creating an eclectic movie ex
perience. In addition to screening
a variety of modern and older
movies, Alamo Drafthouse the
aters serve dinner and drinks with
each movie showing. With his wild
success in Texas, Alamo Draft
house CEO Tim League's next

step seemed obvious: going to Cali
fornia. For League, expanding the
company's unique dining, drinking
and movie viewing experience to
California seemed natural. The city
where his parents met, San Francis
co, is League's self-proclaimed fa
vorite city in the world, and when an
opportunity to build a theater there
arose, League pounced on it.
"I got a heads up from an old
college friend of mine who lived in
the Mission," League said. "I made a
trip out to San Francisco only a
month afterwards to cruise around
the neighborhood."

Because of its inclusion on the
National Register of Historical
Places, the New Mission Theater
presented itself as a project with
many strings attached. Carried out
by the Turnbull & Page architecture
firm, the Historic Research Determi

nation was submitted to the San
Francisco Planning Department and
approved in January 2013 by its Ar
chitectural Review Committee.

According to Jay Turnbull, prin
cipal partner of Turnbull & Page, the
firm had to start its evaluation "from
the outside in, with the most impor
tant things first, so that when [it]
had this list, [the firm] could figure
out ways that the building could be
changed without necessarily com
promising the most important
pieces."

To League, the most important
piece of the theater was obvious:
the iconic New Mission Theater
sign. As League described it, this ex
terior sign stands as a "staggering
icon" of community entertainment
in the past. While much emphasis
