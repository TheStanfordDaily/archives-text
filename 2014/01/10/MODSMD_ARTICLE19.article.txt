## On Japanese Cuisine, Thoughtfulness and Not Throwing Up 
### RENJIE WONG FOOD EDITOR 
Over the Christmas holidays, I decided
to break away from decades of Wong
family custom and not actually stuff
my face with food to the point of
throwing up. So, en route to my native
Singapore, I dropped by the gastro
nomic Shangri-La that is Tokyo.
Now, one would think that being in such
a culinary wonderland would have done my
anti-gluttony pledge no favours, but I actually
managed to steer clear of any regurgitatory
misadventures. That is not to say, though, that
any respectful amount of self-restraint was re
sponsible for this alimentary peace. Many an
evening was, I am ashamed to admit, spent
pre-gaming dinner with ... more dinner.
You see, growing up in Singapore, I'd al
ways been spoilt for choice when it came to
mealtime. The relative inexpensiveness of
food, coupled with a ridiculous plethora of op
tions always carb-laden! at the food cen
ter, meant that every afternoon was spent in a
food coma, desperately trying to stay awake

because my textbooks weren't going to read
themselves. And then, having come to the
Land of the Free two years ago for college, I
discovered that it was really the Land of the
Free Soda Refills. Freshman 15 ballooned into
Freshman 50, and I waddled out of the dining
hall after every meal feeling like a Toulouse
goose that had been force-fed buckets of corn
through a tube. I put it down to the unholy
marriage of homesickness for proper Asian
cuisine and a basically limitless supply of din
ing hall fries.
Throughout my entire time in Tokyo, on
the other hand, I never once felt anything
more than just comfortably full. It was like a
magic trick: scarf down a bento box overflow
ing with luscious food, and still feel game for
another bowl of rice.

Having arrived far too late to justifiably
eat anything more, my first meal was lunch
the next day at renowned kaiseki establish
ment Tofu-ya Ukai. Kaiseki is a traditional
Japanese multi-course meal analogous to West
ern haute cuisine, and this particular iteration
focused on tofu. Every dish featured some
form of the soybean product, from the top

grade soy sauce hand-brewed in the central
highlands of Japan accompanying three hefty
slices of fatty tuna sashimi, to the pillowy
cloud of bean curd simmered in a savory bath
of soybean milk broth. Dining in the shadow
of the Eiffel-esque Tokyo Tower, our meal was
garnished with a breathtaking view of a tradi
tional Japanese garden in the sprawling court
yard, gilded by the full flush of autumnal fo

liage (thanks, global warming!).
Later on, ambling through the urban
maze of downtown Tokyo, I spied dozens of
French patisseries that I literally lost count. En
couraged by Japanese housewives' insatiable
bourgeois appetite for French desserts, the
biggest names in the industry started setting
