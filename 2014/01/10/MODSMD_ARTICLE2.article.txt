## MILES UNTERREINER '12 Grad makes the most of second chance 
### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
After narrowly missing out last year,
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3 will be at
tending Oxford University next year as a
2014 U.S. Rhodes Scholar.

Last year, an anonymous donor pro
vided a private plane so that Unterreiner
could run in the NCAA cross country na
tional championships and interview for
the Rhodes scholarship on the same day,
but Unterreiner was not named a winner.
This year, with a less hectic schedule, Un
terreiner took the award.

"I didn't have the added pressure of
competing in the national championship
race [this year]," Unterreiner explained.
"I remember last year when I got off the
plane and had 15 minutes to get from
Boeing Field to downtown Seattle and
running to the interview location in my

dress shoes and suit."
Unterreiner said that he got to know
the other finalists and interviewees
throughout the course of the interview
process, including at a reception the night
before the interviews.

"That's where we mingled
with the judges, met the other fi
nalists and the judges. We got to
know each other," he explained. "It
wasn't informal, so we got dressed
up nice and were professional, but at
the same time it was relaxed, and I
felt very comfortable being myself.
No one felt like they were being fake
or trying to impress anyone."

Unterreiner achieved success
in a variety of areas at Stanford,
where he competed on the varsity
track and field and cross-country
teams, worked as managing editor
of opinions for The Daily and
served as the president of Stan
ford's chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union. He also won a vari
ety of academic awards, including
the Robert M. Golden Medal for
Excellence in Humanities and Cre
ative Arts and recognition as the
2013 graduating varsity athlete
with highest CPA.
"Miles' greatest attribute is
that he holds himself to the highest
standards in everything he does ac
ademically and athletically," said
Chris Miltenberg, Unterreiner's
cross-country and track coach.
"He's a brilliant, brilliant stu
dent and intellectual and a really
wonderful guy to interact with"
said history professor Matthew
Sommer, Unterreiner's undergrad
uate advisor. "We have a lot of very
fine students who happen to be ath
letes on this campus, but Miles is
truly exceptional even in that
crowd. He just seems to be a real
Renaissance man."

Last year, Unterreiner led the
fight against the changes at Suites
Dining after writing an award-win
ning, four-part expose on the situa
tion. He said that his experience
campaigning to protect the chefs
and student autonomy at Suites
Dining cemented one of his long
term goals.
"Fighting the Suites campaign
last year, and standing up for some
thing that I felt to be right, very
much cemented my desire to be a

human rights lawyer, which is my
goal after Oxford," Unterreiner ex
plained.
Sommer said he is impressed
by Unterreiner's dedication to im
proving the world around him.
"This is a young man who
could do anything and be successful
—he could have a career and make
tons of money and that would be
well with in his reach," Sommer ex
plained. "But he has always struck
me as a very idealistic person,
someone who has genuine intellec
tual curiosity but also a real commit
ment to social justice and human
rights."

Unterreiner added that going
through the Suites campaign
helped him prepare for the applica
tion process as well.
"At a more abstract level, going
through that myself made me a
braver and more courageous per
son," he said. "I was never a person
who was into conflict and fighting
battles publicly. Suites really re
quired me to step outside my com
fort zone, and Suites was an impor
tant learning experience for me,"

Unterreiner said that the cam
paign came up during the infamous
ly difficult Rhodes interview
process, but overall, the interview
was more conversation than inter
rogative.

"I found that it was really help
ful to look at it not as an inquisition
as people are often inclined to, but
to use it as an opportunity to find
out about who you are," he said.
"The judges are not there to tear
you apart, they just want to know
who you are, really, and that's what
they are trying to find out about."
After waiting and watching a
movie with the other finalists, Un
terreiner was invited back for a sec
ond-round interview along with
one another candidate.

"If they invite you back for a
second interview, it usually means
that they're thinking about you in
some way," he explained. "You
might be on the edge they
wouldn't invite you back if they
weren't at least thinking about you.
For that reason, it tends to be a very
tough interview."
After a second interview, Un-

terreiner waited for another 90
minutes before the judges came
out and announced the two region
al winners.

"I was fortunate enough to
grow up in a community that really
valued education," said Unterreiner,
a native of Gig Harbor, Wash. "I had
some amazing teachers from an ear
ly age. I think that really got me
started on a path of valuing educa
tion and loving going to school every
day."

"I couldn't believe it," Unter
reiner said of finding out that he
won. "I don't even know how to de
scribe the moment. I was so excited
and grateful that they chose me to
go I just sat there and thought
about that."

He also emphasized the value
of his experiences at Stanford, call
ing it "one of the best undergradu
ate educations in the world."

Unterreiner explained that ex
periences dating back to his child
hood helped set him on his current
path.

"I think that talking to profes
sors outside of class and learning

about their research and field is
something that is really unique and
that Stanford does really well," Un
terreiner said. "I also think that the
experiences Stanford provides out
side the classroom are incredible,
such as our top-notch athletics pro
grams."
Unterreiner said that students
shouldn't be overwhelmed or intim
idated by the process of applying for
the Rhodes Scholarship.
"The other people who are ap
plying are very capable and incredi
bly intelligent, but at the same time,
they are people like you," he said.
"And at a very basic level, if you
don't get the scholarship one year,
don't hesitate and apply for the next
year," Unterreiner laughed.

was more conversation than inter
rogative.

"I found that it was really help
ful to look at it not as an inquisition
as people are often inclined to, but
to use it as an opportunity to find
out about who you are," he said.
"The judges are not there to tear
you apart, they just want to know
who you are, really, and that's what
they are trying to find out about."
After waiting and watching a
movie with the other finalists, Un
terreiner was invited back for a sec
ond-round interview along with
one another candidate.

"If they invite you back for a
second interview, it usually means
that they're thinking about you in
some way," he explained. "You
might be on the edge they
wouldn't invite you back if they
weren't at least thinking about you.
For that reason, it tends to be a very
tough interview."
After a second interview, Un-

terreiner waited for another 90
minutes before the judges came
out and announced the two region
al winners.

"I was fortunate enough to
grow up in a community that really
valued education," said Unterreiner,
a native of Gig Harbor, Wash. "I had
some amazing teachers from an ear
ly age. I think that really got me
started on a path of valuing educa
tion and loving going to school every
day."

"I couldn't believe it," Unter
reiner said of finding out that he
won. "I don't even know how to de
scribe the moment. I was so excited
and grateful that they chose me to
go I just sat there and thought
about that."

He also emphasized the value
of his experiences at Stanford, call
ing it "one of the best undergradu
ate educations in the world."

Unterreiner explained that ex
periences dating back to his child
hood helped set him on his current
path.

"I think that talking to profes
sors outside of class and learning

about their research and field is
something that is really unique and
that Stanford does really well," Un
terreiner said. "I also think that the
experiences Stanford provides out
side the classroom are incredible,
such as our top-notch athletics pro
grams."
Unterreiner said that students
shouldn't be overwhelmed or intim
idated by the process of applying for
the Rhodes Scholarship.
"The other people who are ap
plying are very capable and incredi
bly intelligent, but at the same time,
they are people like you," he said.
"And at a very basic level, if you
don't get the scholarship one year,
don't hesitate and apply for the next
year," Unterreiner laughed.

"This is a young man who could
do anything and be successful''
MATTHEW SOMMER, UNTERREINER'S ADVISOR
After narrowly missing out last year,
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3 will be at
tending Oxford University next year as a
2014 U.S. Rhodes Scholar.

Last year, an anonymous donor pro
vided a private plane so that Unterreiner
could run in the NCAA cross country na
tional championships and interview for
the Rhodes scholarship on the same day,
but Unterreiner was not named a winner.
This year, with a less hectic schedule, Un
terreiner took the award.

"I didn't have the added pressure of
competing in the national championship
race [this year]," Unterreiner explained.
"I remember last year when I got off the
plane and had 15 minutes to get from
Boeing Field to downtown Seattle and
running to the interview location in my

dress shoes and suit."
Unterreiner said that he got to know
the other finalists and interviewees
throughout the course of the interview
process, including at a reception the night
before the interviews.

"That's where we mingled
with the judges, met the other fi
nalists and the judges. We got to
know each other," he explained. "It
wasn't informal, so we got dressed
up nice and were professional, but at
the same time it was relaxed, and I
felt very comfortable being myself.
No one felt like they were being fake
or trying to impress anyone."

Unterreiner achieved success
in a variety of areas at Stanford,
where he competed on the varsity
track and field and cross-country
teams, worked as managing editor
of opinions for The Daily and
served as the president of Stan
ford's chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union. He also won a vari
ety of academic awards, including
the Robert M. Golden Medal for
Excellence in Humanities and Cre
ative Arts and recognition as the
2013 graduating varsity athlete
with highest CPA.
"Miles' greatest attribute is
that he holds himself to the highest
standards in everything he does ac
ademically and athletically," said
Chris Miltenberg, Unterreiner's
cross-country and track coach.
"He's a brilliant, brilliant stu
dent and intellectual and a really
wonderful guy to interact with"
said history professor Matthew
Sommer, Unterreiner's undergrad
uate advisor. "We have a lot of very
fine students who happen to be ath
letes on this campus, but Miles is
truly exceptional even in that
crowd. He just seems to be a real
Renaissance man."

Last year, Unterreiner led the
fight against the changes at Suites
Dining after writing an award-win
ning, four-part expose on the situa
tion. He said that his experience
campaigning to protect the chefs
and student autonomy at Suites
Dining cemented one of his long
term goals.
"Fighting the Suites campaign
last year, and standing up for some
thing that I felt to be right, very
much cemented my desire to be a

human rights lawyer, which is my
goal after Oxford," Unterreiner ex
plained.
Sommer said he is impressed
by Unterreiner's dedication to im
proving the world around him.
"This is a young man who
could do anything and be successful
—he could have a career and make
tons of money and that would be
well with in his reach," Sommer ex
plained. "But he has always struck
me as a very idealistic person,
someone who has genuine intellec
tual curiosity but also a real commit
ment to social justice and human
rights."

Unterreiner added that going
through the Suites campaign
helped him prepare for the applica
tion process as well.
"At a more abstract level, going
through that myself made me a
braver and more courageous per
son," he said. "I was never a person
who was into conflict and fighting
battles publicly. Suites really re
quired me to step outside my com
fort zone, and Suites was an impor
tant learning experience for me,"

Unterreiner said that the cam
paign came up during the infamous
ly difficult Rhodes interview
process, but overall, the interview
