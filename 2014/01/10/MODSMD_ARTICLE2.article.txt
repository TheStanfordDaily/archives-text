## MILES UNTERREINER '12 Grad makes the most of second chance 
### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
After narrowly missing out last year,
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3 will be at
tending Oxford University next year as a
2014 U.S. Rhodes Scholar.

Last year, an anonymous donor pro
vided a private plane so that Unterreiner
could run in the NCAA cross country na
tional championships and interview for
the Rhodes scholarship on the same day,
but Unterreiner was not named a winner.
This year, with a less hectic schedule, Un
terreiner took the award.

"I didn't have the added pressure of
competing in the national championship
race [this year]," Unterreiner explained.
"I remember last year when I got off the
plane and had 15 minutes to get from
Boeing Field to downtown Seattle and
running to the interview location in my

dress shoes and suit."
Unterreiner said that he got to know
the other finalists and interviewees
throughout the course of the interview
process, including at a reception the night
before the interviews.
