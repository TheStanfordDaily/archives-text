# Roxy Sass: Roxy roams the halls
## 
### ROXY SASS 
Football season may be over, but Roxy's found a
new sport of choice, and this one's a little closer
to home: dormcest. Whether you're in a freshmen
dorm or a Row house, chances are there are some
cuties living nearby that you wouldn't mind get
ting to know a little better... all in the name of
dorm bonding, of course. But just like any nerdy Stan
ford student, Roxy thinks it's probably a good idea to do
some cost-benefit analysis before making "dorm love"
too literal.

PROS: Convenience, convenience, convenience.
Sex might be the only thing that could motivate Roxy to
travel to the far corners of campus (class certainly can't),
but it's always easier when the object of your affection
lives just down the hall. Cozy up to your neighbor, and

you could be saying goodbye to long walks of shame for
the rest of the quarter. It'll only be so long before every
one in the dorm knows, of course, but it can be fun to

see how long you can keep your sneaky activities on the
DL... nothing spices up a hookup quite like trying to
hide it from 48 of your close buddies.
CONS: All of the awkwardness. If things in this
kind of relationship go south (and not in a sexy way), it
can lead to some pretty uncomfortable situations. It's
never fun to eat lunch across the table from the guy or
girl who just broke your heart... or to hear them hook
ing up with someone else through thin dorm walls. And
even if it's all going peachy, it can still be annoying to
know you constantly are the favorite topic of the dorm
gossip mill. Much to Roxy's chagrin, it's also not a great
idea to hook up with multiple people from your house
not tryna have them compare stats, ya feel me?

The dangers of dormcest may be many, but to be
honest, they haven't stopped Roxy, and they shouldn't stop
you. This may be the only time in your life you will be sur
rounded by such convenient and abundant opportunities
to get some... and not even have to leave your house to do
it. If you are prepared to keep it subtle and brave the pos
sible awkward aftermath, then by all means open your door
(and your legs) for that hottie down the hall.
