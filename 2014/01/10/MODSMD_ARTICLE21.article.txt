## Radiant Orchid 
### LAYNIE STEPHENS FASHION COLUMNIST 
Now its time to talk
about the it-color of
the year: Radiant Or
chid. This gorgeous
purple hue is nothing
less than everything
for 2014, at least for Pan
tone, the nationwide au
thority on color. They're
so serious about this color
that you can buy anything
from a pillow to a flash
drive in the perfected radi
ant orchid hue. But for the
average fashionista, match
ing this color with a pretty
similar hue will suffice.
Look for a lighter, pinker
purple and you're there.
To help you start the
new year right in the fash
ion world, here's some in
spiration to keep you look
ing up to date (emerald
green is so 2013, don't you
agree?):

1. I'll start with the Stretch
jersey Mini Dress from
Splendid. Simple, cute and
comfortable; this dress has
it all. Wear it on its own, or
add a belt or some jewelry.
No matter what you do,
you'll be sure to be the
most fashionably up-to-date
person on campus the sec
ond you slip this frock on.
It's available on Net-A-
Porter.

2. Another great way to in
corporate Radiant Orchid
into your style (without be
ing too flashy) is the Nars
nail polish "Chinatown"
available at Lord and Taylor.
It not only looks like a per

feet match to Radiant Or
chid, but also is flattering
on almost any skin tone. It's
a subtle way of saying, "Yes,
I do know that it's now
2014."

3. Finally, pants. Now I
know the prospect of purple
pants may sound like too
much for some of you, but
let me present the "deep
garnet" Sloans from Ba
nana Republic. No, they're
not exactly Radiant Orchid,
but they are a festive way
to add some color to your
wardrobe while staying in
the same color family as
this year's top hue. And re
gardless of color, the Sloan
pants are definitely a
worthwhile investment. If
you haven't already heard
of them, I recommend
dropping everything and
making your way over to Ba
nana Republic immediately.
They may just be the most
comfortable and flattering
pants in the world, and can
very easily be dressed up or
down. Get the deep garnet
ones fast, as they're already
on sale.

If none of these strike
your fancy, don't fret
there are thousands of pur
ple fashion options out
there, and there's nothing a
little shopping can't fix. Just
remember: What's the easi
est way to be fashionable
this year? Add a little orchid
into your wardrobe, and see
how life changing it just
might be.
