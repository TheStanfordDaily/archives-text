# EMMA PERSON '13
## Passion and acumen lead to Rhodes 
### NEHAN CHATOOR 
"After the interviews, I wasn't ex
pecting to win this isn't false modesty,
it's just statistics," Emma Pierson 'l3 M.S
'l3 said about the Rhodes Scholarship ap
plication process.
If anyone knows statistics, it's Pier
son, who received the 2013 Dean's
Award for Academic Achievement for
"her talents and accomplishment in
physics, machine learning, statistical
analysis and interpretation of data, writing
and debating."
In this case, however, Pierson's statis
tical intuition led her astray, as she was ul-

timately selected as
one of 32 U.S.
Rhodes Scholars for
2014.
Originally from

Arlington, Va., Pierson completed her
bachelor's degree in physics and a co-ter
minal master's degree in computer sci
ence in 2013. While at Stanford, Pierson
studied how computers can be applied to
solve the most significant problems in bi
ology, particularly cancer treatments. Her
work was fitting for the Rhodes Scholar
ship, which seeks not only students with
outstanding academic rigor but those also

striving to serve for the common
good.

Pierson first visited Oxford for
a debate tournament. She was cap
tivated by its beauty and excited
about the idea of living with Rhodes
Scholars belonging to different
fields.

Along with serving as a coun
selor for The Bridge Peer Counsel
ing Center, debate was one of Pier
son's main extracurricular activities
at Stanford. She served as president
of the Stanford Debate Society and
took second place in the 2013 U.S.
National Debate Championships.
Maria Mateen 'l3, who
worked at the Bridge and debated
with Pierson, said that Pierson's
thoughtfulness, capabilities and de
votion made her successful in both
extracurricular activities and also
helped her succeed with the
Rhodes Scholarship.
"I think that she is very, very
intelligent, very thoughtful and very
good at her work, but what really
sets her apart from other people is
how much work she puts into the
things that she does," Mateen ex

plained.
Mateen added that Pierson's
passion that causes her to spend
hours thinking about, say, an article
that she finds intriguing, makes her
truly the exceptional individual she
is.

"If you devote that much time
and energy to anything, if you were
good before, you'd be great," Ma
teen said. "And Emma started out
great."

According to Pierson, having
many role models and mentors was
integral to her success. In fact,
Pierson said a phone call from one
of her role models immediately be
fore the interview boosted her con
fidence throughout the process.
"I studied physics and comput
er science, and as a girl, having a lot
of female role models who are
strong and inspiring is incredibly
important," Pierson said.
Pierson said her family has
been equally important in her suc
cess by providing both support and
motivation through what Pierson
calls a "strength of tradition"
both of Pierson's grandmothers
completed graduate studies, which
was extraordinary for women to ac
complish at the time.
Pierson's high school friend,
Jacob Steinhardt, now a Ph.D. stu

dent in the Computer Science de
partment at Stanford, could see
Pierson's brilliance even in high
school. Most importantly, he saw
that "she is proactive in her pur
suits."

Steinhardt explained how Pier
son — a physics major began
taking graduate level computer sci
ence classes and biology classes
once she discovered her interest in
computational biology, demonstrat
ing a remarkable bravery.
Pierson said her passion for
computational biology particu
larly applied to solving the prob
lems of cancer helped inspire
her success.

"It is important to have some
thing that drives you so hard that
some nights you stay up thinking
about it," Pierson said. Pierson
plans to obtain a Ph.D. in computa
tional biology at Oxford and to be
come a professor in the field.

"I am a statistician and I like to
apply statistics to questions in
every field," Pierson said. "I also
just knew I would regret it
maybe as a creaky old grandmoth
er, wishing I had developed a
British accent if I didn't apply."

striving to serve for the common
good.

Pierson first visited Oxford for
a debate tournament. She was cap
tivated by its beauty and excited
about the idea of living with Rhodes
Scholars belonging to different
fields.

Along with serving as a coun
selor for The Bridge Peer Counsel
ing Center, debate was one of Pier
son's main extracurricular activities
at Stanford. She served as president
of the Stanford Debate Society and
took second place in the 2013 U.S.
National Debate Championships.
Maria Mateen 'l3, who
worked at the Bridge and debated
with Pierson, said that Pierson's
thoughtfulness, capabilities and de
votion made her successful in both
extracurricular activities and also
helped her succeed with the
Rhodes Scholarship.
"I think that she is very, very
intelligent, very thoughtful and very
good at her work, but what really
sets her apart from other people is
how much work she puts into the
things that she does," Mateen ex

plained.
Mateen added that Pierson's
passion that causes her to spend
hours thinking about, say, an article
that she finds intriguing, makes her
truly the exceptional individual she
is.

"If you devote that much time
and energy to anything, if you were
good before, you'd be great," Ma
teen said. "And Emma started out
great."

According to Pierson, having
many role models and mentors was
integral to her success. In fact,
Pierson said a phone call from one
of her role models immediately be
fore the interview boosted her con
fidence throughout the process.
"I studied physics and comput
er science, and as a girl, having a lot
of female role models who are
strong and inspiring is incredibly
important," Pierson said.
Pierson said her family has
been equally important in her suc
cess by providing both support and
motivation through what Pierson
calls a "strength of tradition"
both of Pierson's grandmothers
completed graduate studies, which
was extraordinary for women to ac
complish at the time.
Pierson's high school friend,
Jacob Steinhardt, now a Ph.D. stu

dent in the Computer Science de
partment at Stanford, could see
Pierson's brilliance even in high
school. Most importantly, he saw
that "she is proactive in her pur
suits."

Steinhardt explained how Pier
son — a physics major began
taking graduate level computer sci
ence classes and biology classes
once she discovered her interest in
computational biology, demonstrat
ing a remarkable bravery.
Pierson said her passion for
computational biology particu
larly applied to solving the prob
lems of cancer helped inspire
her success.

"It is important to have some
thing that drives you so hard that
some nights you stay up thinking
about it," Pierson said. Pierson
plans to obtain a Ph.D. in computa
tional biology at Oxford and to be
come a professor in the field.

"I am a statistician and I like to
apply statistics to questions in
every field," Pierson said. "I also
just knew I would regret it
maybe as a creaky old grandmoth
er, wishing I had developed a
British accent if I didn't apply."
