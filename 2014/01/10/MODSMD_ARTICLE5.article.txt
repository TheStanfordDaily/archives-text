# MEREDITH WHEELER '14
## Oxford to be a gateway to the Middle East 
### ALLI MARTIN 
Meredith Wheeler 'l4 began her
post-high school career far away from the
sunny skies and cool breeze of Palo Alto.
Instead of jumping straight into the excite
ment of freshman year, she took a gap year

to study Arabic in Egypt.
While students of- I
ten use a gap year to ex
plore something new,
Wheeler chose to fur
ther probe an interest
she had had since her
youth. Even as a young
girl, Wheeler remem
bered looking up to her
grandfather, who

worked in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Yemen.
It was this interest in the Middle East that
was the driving force behind Wheeler's ac
ademic journey, which will lead her to Ox
ford University next year after the Stan
ford senior was named a 2014 U.S.
Rhodes Scholarship winner.
"I'm really interested in the Middle
East, and Oxford has a long history of
scholarship in the region they have a
lot of archival resources and a lot of won
derful faculty," Wheeler said. "It was a bit
of a no-brainer to apply for the opportunity
just because I'm so interested in being
close to the Middle East and study with
the top people in the field."
Wheeler first ventured to the Middle
East during the summer before her senior
year of high school, when she studied Ara
bic in Jordan. When she arrived at Stan
ford after her gap year, Wheeler immersed
herself in activities that dovetailed with
her interests.
During her first quarter at Stanford,
