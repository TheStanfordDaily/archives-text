# MEREDITH WHEELER '14
## Oxford to be a gateway to the Middle East 
### ALLI MARTIN 
Meredith Wheeler 'l4 began her
post-high school career far away from the
sunny skies and cool breeze of Palo Alto.
Instead of jumping straight into the excite
ment of freshman year, she took a gap year

to study Arabic in Egypt.
While students of- I
ten use a gap year to ex
plore something new,
Wheeler chose to fur
ther probe an interest
she had had since her
youth. Even as a young
girl, Wheeler remem
bered looking up to her
grandfather, who

worked in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Yemen.
It was this interest in the Middle East that
was the driving force behind Wheeler's ac
ademic journey, which will lead her to Ox
ford University next year after the Stan
ford senior was named a 2014 U.S.
Rhodes Scholarship winner.
"I'm really interested in the Middle
East, and Oxford has a long history of
scholarship in the region they have a
lot of archival resources and a lot of won
derful faculty," Wheeler said. "It was a bit
of a no-brainer to apply for the opportunity
just because I'm so interested in being
close to the Middle East and study with
the top people in the field."
Wheeler first ventured to the Middle
East during the summer before her senior
year of high school, when she studied Ara
bic in Jordan. When she arrived at Stan
ford after her gap year, Wheeler immersed
herself in activities that dovetailed with
her interests.
During her first quarter at Stanford,

Wheeler joined Stanford in Govern
ment (SIG), which she became the
chair of the organization this year.
Wheeler also co-directed the Amer
ican Middle Eastern Network for
Dialogue at Stanford (AMENDS),
which brings together young civil
society leaders from the Middle
East, North Africa and the United
States for an annual conference.

"Being involved in Stanford in
Government and AMENDS have
both been really meaningful experi

ences for me and given me a per
spective on what I want to do in
the future, while also building the
kinds of relationships that really
prepared me well for applying for
the Rhodes scholarship," Wheeler
said.

However, Wheeler said that or
ganizations on campus were not
enough to satisfy her fascination
with the Middle East. To further in
dulge her curiosity, she returned to
the Middle East over the summers.
After her freshman year, Wheeler
travelled to Morocco on a Critical
Language Scholarship, a program
sponsored by the U.S. State Depart
ment that allowed her the opportu

nity to sharpen her Arabic-speaking
skills. The following summer,
Wheeler returned to Morocco to
study Islamist political parties with a
research grant from Stanford.

Yet Wheeler's interests are not
limited to the scope of Middle East
ern politics. Alongside her political
pursuits, Wheeler has also partici
pated in the Alpine Ski Team, served
on The Daily's editorial board and
edited for the Stanford history jour
nal, Herodotus. In addition, Wheel
er volunteered at a local prison by fa
cilitating creative writing workshops
for incarcerated youth.
"The things I did were never
intended to achieve the Rhodes

Scholarship, or any award," Wheeler
said.

She said that opportunities of all
kinds "fell into [her] inbox," and she
took advantage of those that inter
ested her, particularly those that
connected "the questions of justice,
access and privilege."

Wheeler also shined in the
classroom, achieving Phi Beta Kappa
recognition by her junior year while
majoring in history and political sci
ence. History professor James
Campbell, Wheeler's major advisor,
said that Wheeler is an extremely
talented student.

"I'm a little embarrassed being
characterized as one of Meredith's

'mentors' because I'm not sure that
she's actually learned anything from
me certainly not as much as I've
learned from her," Campbell said.
At Oxford, Wheeler intends to
pursue a master's degree in Modern
Middle Eastern Studies and poten
tially a doctorate in political science.
In the long-run, Wheeler envisions a
future that combines policymaking
and academia to "serve the interests
of people whose voices are not often
heard by a wider audience."
