# Taking the Rhodes to Oxford
## Bechtel, advising, mentors help students prepare 
### KYLIE JUE STAFF WRITER 
With three recipients in 2014, the num
ber of Rhodes Scholars from Stanford has
reached a total of 112. John Pearson, direc
tor of the Bechtel International Center,
which supports students throughout the ap
plication process, attributed this success to
the University's caliber of students. He also
explained that the University has focused
more on the award in the last 30 to 40 years,
as the scholarship has become more widely
recognized.

"In the last 10 or 11 years when we
have done well, we did get some extra sup
port: resources from the University in this
office to help us do better at outreach and
advising," Pearson said.

Bechtel has been the main office for the
scholarship since the mid-'7os, according to
Pearson, and every year, between 20 and 30
students usually apply to be endorsed by
Stanford. In the scholarship's history, 93 of
Stanford's winners were American Rhodes
Scholars while an additional nine were inter
national applicants.

The University sponsorship application
is a combined process with the Marshall
Scholarship so students can apply to be
sponsored for one of the two awards or for
both using the same application. The

process requires the submission of an activi
ties list, three references, a transcript and
1000-word statement of purpose specific to
the Rhodes.

After submitting their materials, stu
dents are interviewed by a Rhodes-Marshall
panel of faculty, alumni, graduate students
and even local Rhodes and Marshall Scholars
from outside the University all of whom
have experience in higher education in the
United Kingdom. While some applicants may
be told to wait a year or to consider a differ
ent scholarship instead, most end up getting
sponsored.

The panel looks for the qualities of a
Rhodes Scholar in applicants, as specified in
Cecil Rhodes's will. However, Pearson clari
fied one of the most common questions he
receives about the award regarding athletics.

"Cecil Rhodes in his will said he wanted
applicants with a fondness and success in,
and I quote, 'manly sports.' Forget all that,"
Pearson said. "It's now this aspect of physical
vigor: Does the applicant show that they
have the energy to do a number of things
well? One way you can show that is by ath
letics, but it's not the only way."
Bechtel provides constant support and
guidance to applicants through mock inter
views, one-on-one workshops and general
advising. Pearson explained that Bechtel's
Overseas Resource Center (ORC) also pairs
students with previous Rhodes Scholars for
mentorship throughout the entire process:
from considering applying to preparing for
the final interview.

"By matching students with alums who
have been through this themselves, it just
gives them a sense that [winning the schol
arship] is doable, that you can prepare for it
and that there is an opportunity waiting for
you," Pearson said.

As a previous Rhodes Scholarship recip
ient, Professor Emeritus of Medicine and Ac
ademic Secretary to the University Rex Jami
son, who chairs Stanford's Rhodes-Marshall
panel, described his experience advising ap
plicants.

"You try to give them a sense of what
the interview will be like, which is generally
pretty rigorous," Jamison said. "The commit
tee is trying to determine how well the can
didate understands the subject [in which] he
or she is interested and generally what other
interests they have."

Rhodes Scholar Fatima Sabar 'll ex
plained that the advising she received during
her application process made the scholar
ship seem more accessible. As a result, she
now volunteers to mentor applicants.
"The help that I got was so invaluable,
so I make it a point to tell John and Diane [at
the ORC] to connect me with anyone I could
be helpful to in the process," Sabar said.
One of the applicants Sabar mentored
was Margaret Hayden 'l3, a 2013 Rhodes
Scholar. Both Sabar and Hayden explained
that Stanford's opportunities to develop
close relationships with faculty and advisors
helped make the application process easier.
They also described the transition between
the two universities.

"They're very different institutions,"
Hayden said. "The best way I've found of
putting it is that at Stanford we're more or
less encouraged to swim in the fountains
and at Oxford you're not allowed to walk on
the grass."

Rhodes Scholar Rachel Kolb 'l2 M.A.
'l3 also took time to adjust to the new struc
ture and traditions at Oxford, yet she and
the others said the friendships they have
formed there were just as valuable as those
at Stanford.

"I've enjoyed the incredibly
diverse community of fellow grad
uate students at Oxford, which
feels similarly diverse to the com
munity at Stanford but is even
more international," Kolb said.
"Just as at Stanford, the absolute
best part about Oxford is the peo
ple I'm meeting during my time
there."

Overall, all three emphasized
that the Rhodes Scholarship has
helped them think about their fu
tures and that winning the award
is something anyone can do.
"In the future, I see myself
becoming a writer and perhaps an
academic who engages with is
sues of disability access," Kolb
said. "Some of that is still in the
air, though, and for now I'm en
joying the experience, trying to
learn as much as I can and leaving
doors open for opportunity."
Sabar explained that Pearson
and Diane Murk, manager at the

ORC, encourage applicants to see
the scholarship as just another
post-graduation option for sen
iors.

"To be perfectly honest,
when I decided to apply, I wasn't
sure really what I wanted to do af
ter senior year," Sabar said. "I de
cided to apply because I wanted
to consider a variety of options af
ter senior year, including re
search, graduate school fellow
ships or industry work."
Hayden explained that the
only reason she applied was that
she knew a previous Rhodes
Scholar who shared her interests.
Knowing that she wants "to be
more than a doctor who sees pa
tients," she saw the scholarship
as an opportunity to experience
academic research before going
to medical school.

"I sort of applied on the whim
of 'let's see what happens'... and
somehow now I'm here at Ox
ford," Hayden said. "I feel like I'm
a normal person who got lucky."

ter senior year, including re
search, graduate school fellow
ships or industry work."
Hayden explained that the
only reason she applied was that
she knew a previous Rhodes
Scholar who shared her interests.
Knowing that she wants "to be
more than a doctor who sees pa
tients," she saw the scholarship
as an opportunity to experience
academic research before going
to medical school.

"I sort of applied on the whim
of 'let's see what happens'... and
somehow now I'm here at Ox
ford," Hayden said. "I feel like I'm
a normal person who got lucky."

With three recipients in 2014, the num
ber of Rhodes Scholars from Stanford has
reached a total of 112. John Pearson, direc
tor of the Bechtel International Center,
which supports students throughout the ap
plication process, attributed this success to
the University's caliber of students. He also
explained that the University has focused
more on the award in the last 30 to 40 years,
as the scholarship has become more widely
recognized.

"In the last 10 or 11 years when we
have done well, we did get some extra sup
port: resources from the University in this
office to help us do better at outreach and
advising," Pearson said.

Bechtel has been the main office for the
scholarship since the mid-'7os, according to
Pearson, and every year, between 20 and 30
students usually apply to be endorsed by
Stanford. In the scholarship's history, 93 of
Stanford's winners were American Rhodes
Scholars while an additional nine were inter
national applicants.

The University sponsorship application
is a combined process with the Marshall
Scholarship so students can apply to be
sponsored for one of the two awards or for
both using the same application. The

process requires the submission of an activi
ties list, three references, a transcript and
1000-word statement of purpose specific to
the Rhodes.

After submitting their materials, stu
dents are interviewed by a Rhodes-Marshall
panel of faculty, alumni, graduate students
and even local Rhodes and Marshall Scholars
from outside the University all of whom
have experience in higher education in the
United Kingdom. While some applicants may
be told to wait a year or to consider a differ
ent scholarship instead, most end up getting
sponsored.

The panel looks for the qualities of a
Rhodes Scholar in applicants, as specified in
Cecil Rhodes's will. However, Pearson clari
fied one of the most common questions he
receives about the award regarding athletics.

"Cecil Rhodes in his will said he wanted
applicants with a fondness and success in,
and I quote, 'manly sports.' Forget all that,"
Pearson said. "It's now this aspect of physical
vigor: Does the applicant show that they
have the energy to do a number of things
well? One way you can show that is by ath
letics, but it's not the only way."
Bechtel provides constant support and
guidance to applicants through mock inter
views, one-on-one workshops and general
advising. Pearson explained that Bechtel's
Overseas Resource Center (ORC) also pairs
students with previous Rhodes Scholars for
mentorship throughout the entire process:
from considering applying to preparing for
the final interview.

"By matching students with alums who
have been through this themselves, it just
gives them a sense that [winning the schol
arship] is doable, that you can prepare for it
and that there is an opportunity waiting for
you," Pearson said.

As a previous Rhodes Scholarship recip
ient, Professor Emeritus of Medicine and Ac
ademic Secretary to the University Rex Jami
son, who chairs Stanford's Rhodes-Marshall
panel, described his experience advising ap
plicants.

"You try to give them a sense of what
the interview will be like, which is generally
pretty rigorous," Jamison said. "The commit
tee is trying to determine how well the can
didate understands the subject [in which] he
or she is interested and generally what other
interests they have."

Rhodes Scholar Fatima Sabar 'll ex
plained that the advising she received during
her application process made the scholar
ship seem more accessible. As a result, she
now volunteers to mentor applicants.
"The help that I got was so invaluable,
so I make it a point to tell John and Diane [at
the ORC] to connect me with anyone I could
be helpful to in the process," Sabar said.
One of the applicants Sabar mentored
was Margaret Hayden 'l3, a 2013 Rhodes
Scholar. Both Sabar and Hayden explained
that Stanford's opportunities to develop
close relationships with faculty and advisors
helped make the application process easier.
They also described the transition between
the two universities.

"They're very different institutions,"
Hayden said. "The best way I've found of
putting it is that at Stanford we're more or
less encouraged to swim in the fountains
and at Oxford you're not allowed to walk on
the grass."

Rhodes Scholar Rachel Kolb 'l2 M.A.
'l3 also took time to adjust to the new struc
ture and traditions at Oxford, yet she and
the others said the friendships they have
formed there were just as valuable as those
at Stanford.


IRENE HSU/The Stanford Daily
"I've enjoyed the incredibly
diverse community of fellow grad
uate students at Oxford, which
feels similarly diverse to the com
munity at Stanford but is even
more international," Kolb said.
"Just as at Stanford, the absolute
best part about Oxford is the peo
ple I'm meeting during my time
there."

Overall, all three emphasized
that the Rhodes Scholarship has
helped them think about their fu
tures and that winning the award
is something anyone can do.
"In the future, I see myself
becoming a writer and perhaps an
academic who engages with is
sues of disability access," Kolb
said. "Some of that is still in the
air, though, and for now I'm en
joying the experience, trying to
learn as much as I can and leaving
doors open for opportunity."
Sabar explained that Pearson
and Diane Murk, manager at the

ORC, encourage applicants to see
the scholarship as just another
post-graduation option for sen
iors.

"To be perfectly honest,
when I decided to apply, I wasn't
sure really what I wanted to do af
ter senior year," Sabar said. "I de
cided to apply because I wanted
to consider a variety of options af
ter senior year, including re
search, graduate school fellow
ships or industry work."
Hayden explained that the
only reason she applied was that
