# Stockholm Syndrome
## 
### Gustavo Empinotti 
The old-fashioned architecture of the
Warfield Theater provides an ironic
contrast to the hundreds of phones
that immediately block general vision
when the performer steps in. At my latest
visit to the venue, I was appalled by the
number of fans who tore their tickets apart
by turning their backs to the stage as
Janelle Monae walked in, just to catch the
moment (with a delightful sight of their
faces) on video.

While I do have some qualms with ex
cessive attachment to technology, what
bothers me most is not the phone itself
but what it represents. Those videos, of
course, were bound straight to Facebook.
Full engagement with content of any form
has been lost to our desire to share it. We
do great things not for their pleasure or
relevance, but to count more coolness
points with our followers.

Why enjoy the show when all that
matters is that my subscribers think I do?
Back home in Brazil this summer, I
went to one of the many protests that took
the streets of the country at the time. The
same photo obsession was there.
Social networks are in great part re
sponsible for the turnout of demonstra
tions like these for two reasons. The obvi
ous one is they facilitate the organization
of the protests. More interestingly, they al
so create an incentive. For a poorly in
formed and politically ignorant audience,
there is no better way to instantly become
a social activist than a picture of your smil
ing self in the rage of the #instaprotest.
The clash between real engagement
and checklisting is not exactly new; it has
been around since the advent of dinner
conversation. However, as it became in
creasingly common to let Twitter know
that you're headed to the shower, the in
centive otherwise provided by resume
building perpetrated surprisingly trifling
moments of our life. Yesterday, we casu
ally posted on Facebook a funny situation
observed. Today, we cook up clever
punch lines so that they look good on the

Internet.
As every single bit of our life gains the
potential to be immediately exhibited on a
voyeuristic clothesline, we start living in a
play. This constant acting brings the risk
that we forget what goes on behind the
curtains. And not without serious conse
quences, for example, for our mental
health. Why care that I'm lonely and sad if
I got 50 likes in this picture making a fun
ny face?

The Facebook profile substitutes
"The Picture of Dorian Gray" by doing its
opposite. A hundred years after Oscar
Wilde, our friends see our profile picture
much more than they see us in person. We
can afford to let ourselves decay as long as
the relevant version remains immaculate.

The parallel entity that is the Face
book profile allows not only for a constant
ly perfect version of ourselves, but also for
the rise of completely new personas. Peo
ple assume an entertaining and unrealistic
variety of "types" under their cyber identi
ty-

There is the too-cool-for-school type.
Aloof, he will ignore even the most affec
tionate of birthday wishes. He ain't got
time for you or maybe you're just not
as close of a friend as you thought (that's
right, he has that many friends).
A thin line separates the too-cool-for
school from the clever type. The clever
type will have an average 30-minute re
sponse time. Immediately after receiving a
message, her brain will start working at
full speed to find the optimally witty one
line answer. The delayed reply might come
as a pun, a music reference, or even lo
and behold a hashtag.

It is fascinating but not exactly sur
prising that these personas are only ex
pressed in public interactions "the
wall" as opposed to the private "in-box
es." In need of an urgent answer from a
clever type, a private message will do the
trick. It removes the threat of public expo
sition of a potentially unwitty response.
The most intriguing of all features of
social media is precisely that public mes
sages are used at all. Faced with the choice
between those and the private analogous
message, one might expect that the last
minute confirmation ("9 at Starbucks?")
could and should be delivered on the DL.
I won't even appeal to the increased possi
bility of kidnapping. One would think we
have an instinctive desire for privacy. But
not if we can casually let our friends know
that we won't be home alone tonight.

When George Orwell made the Big
Brother his villain, he missed a major
point. The prisoners would grow fond of
it.

by turning their backs to the stage as
Janelle Monae walked in, just to catch the
moment (with a delightful sight of their
faces) on video.

While I do have some qualms with ex
cessive attachment to technology, what
bothers me most is not the phone itself
but what it represents. Those videos, of
course, were bound straight to Facebook.
Full engagement with content of any form
has been lost to our desire to share it. We
do great things not for their pleasure or
relevance, but to count more coolness
points with our followers.

Why enjoy the show when all that
matters is that my subscribers think I do?
Back home in Brazil this summer, I
went to one of the many protests that took
the streets of the country at the time. The
same photo obsession was there.
Social networks are in great part re
sponsible for the turnout of demonstra
tions like these for two reasons. The obvi
ous one is they facilitate the organization
of the protests. More interestingly, they al
so create an incentive. For a poorly in
formed and politically ignorant audience,
there is no better way to instantly become
a social activist than a picture of your smil
ing self in the rage of the #instaprotest.
The clash between real engagement
and checklisting is not exactly new; it has
been around since the advent of dinner
conversation. However, as it became in
creasingly common to let Twitter know
that you're headed to the shower, the in
centive otherwise provided by resume
building perpetrated surprisingly trifling
moments of our life. Yesterday, we casu
ally posted on Facebook a funny situation
observed. Today, we cook up clever
punch lines so that they look good on the

Internet.
As every single bit of our life gains the
potential to be immediately exhibited on a
voyeuristic clothesline, we start living in a
play. This constant acting brings the risk
that we forget what goes on behind the
curtains. And not without serious conse
quences, for example, for our mental
health. Why care that I'm lonely and sad if
I got 50 likes in this picture making a fun
ny face?

The Facebook profile substitutes
"The Picture of Dorian Gray" by doing its
opposite. A hundred years after Oscar
Wilde, our friends see our profile picture
much more than they see us in person. We
can afford to let ourselves decay as long as
the relevant version remains immaculate.

The parallel entity that is the Face
book profile allows not only for a constant
ly perfect version of ourselves, but also for
the rise of completely new personas. Peo
ple assume an entertaining and unrealistic
variety of "types" under their cyber identi
ty-

There is the too-cool-for-school type.
Aloof, he will ignore even the most affec
tionate of birthday wishes. He ain't got
time for you or maybe you're just not
as close of a friend as you thought (that's
right, he has that many friends).
A thin line separates the too-cool-for
school from the clever type. The clever
type will have an average 30-minute re
sponse time. Immediately after receiving a
message, her brain will start working at
full speed to find the optimally witty one
line answer. The delayed reply might come
as a pun, a music reference, or even lo
and behold a hashtag.

It is fascinating but not exactly sur
prising that these personas are only ex
pressed in public interactions "the
wall" as opposed to the private "in-box
es." In need of an urgent answer from a
clever type, a private message will do the
trick. It removes the threat of public expo
sition of a potentially unwitty response.
The most intriguing of all features of
social media is precisely that public mes
sages are used at all. Faced with the choice
between those and the private analogous
message, one might expect that the last
minute confirmation ("9 at Starbucks?")
could and should be delivered on the DL.
I won't even appeal to the increased possi
bility of kidnapping. One would think we
have an instinctive desire for privacy. But
not if we can casually let our friends know
that we won't be home alone tonight.

When George Orwell made the Big
Brother his villain, he missed a major
point. The prisoners would grow fond of
it.
