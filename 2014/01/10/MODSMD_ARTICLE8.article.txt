## Seeding Social Impact 
### Elizabeth Woodson 
It's a fact: Silicon Valley and Stanford University
are inextricably connected. The New Yorker's
April 2012 article "Get Rich U" by Ken Aluetta
voiced concerns about this relationship, but in my
opinion, the connection is valuable and particular
ly additive in the field of social impact.
A few Silicon Valley-isms that are seeping into
the world of doing-good and supporting young
people in achieving change: the Ã¼biquity of ac
cepting and progressing from failure, a 'get-out
and-try-it' mentality, the importance of building
empathy with your user, a prerogative to solve big
problems, the commonality of adolescent CEOs...
The list of trends goes on.

I want to focus on seed funding chunks of
capital, usually under $ 1 million, provided to an
entrepreneur whose venture is in the idea stage.
Seed money mitigates risk enough to test the
product, market, and/or team, and hopefully prove
that the concept can go from idea to company.
Traditionally, this money comes mostly out of
the pockets of friends and family, but the process
is now more institutionalized and popular. Seed
funding is currently at an all-time high in the ven
ture capital world.

"Last year, about half of all venture deals were
in the seed and early stages the highest propor
tion since 1985," noted Nathan Heller in his re
cent article, "Bay Watched." Prominent venture
capital firms, such as KPCB, Khosla Ventures and
Floodgate recognize the importance of supporting
promising ideas and their creators in the initial
stage.

Some venture capital groups even make their
support for positive social change explicit. Sequoia
has made "charities the backbone of our client
base." Their Great Causes initiative supports hos
pitals, foundations and other social change organ
izations as Sequoia's investments profit. Another
example is RSF in San Francisco, which only in
vests in nonprofits and is "dedicated to transform

ing the way the world works with money." They
also recently launched a Social Impact Fellowship
program.

The positive ideology around financing young
people with big ideas is spreading, which is great
news for those interested specifically in positive
social impact. Why? Seed funding supports think
ing that is valuable to social impact initiatives.
Innovations are much better placed to flour
ish when given early financial support that can en
courage user testing and product iteration. Ac
cessing unrestricted funds for this is challenging
for nonprofit social change organizations. Instead
of devaluing the nuts and bolts, VCs encourage
supporting the backend elements develop
ment and overhead in seed-funded ventures.

Lack of this kind of support is common in
nonprofits, as noted by SSIR's article "The Non
profit Starvation Cycle." Secondly, it is a reality
that money flows define value in our society.
Funding social impact initiatives signal that public
sector problem solving has worth.
This was one of the main factors that inspired
Steve and Anita Westly to create the Westly Prize,
an annual initiative of their foundation that awards
four young people with $20,000 each to pursue a
problem-solving innovation. "We want to incen
tivize young people to try big things, to take risks,
to be leaders. We hope that the Westly Prize will
help in demonstrating the importance of working
toward the public good," Mr. Westly explained.
This is venture capital seed funding, but for under
-28-year-olds in California focused on social
change.

Kiah Williams, one of last year's winners,
voiced her appreciation of the prize's flexibility.
"Having unrestricted funds was hugely important

... it allowed us to ask ourselves how we can do
what we do better, and then actually implement
it." SIRUM, William's organization, connects clin
ics and donated drugs from suppliers, pharmacies
and health facilities.

Williams noted that the prize allowed SIRIM
to replenish areas that had been bootstrapped by
her and fellow founders in the organization's early
phases, as well as experiment with technologies to
improve company-efficiency, not to
mention the added-value of mere
monetary recognition from a re
spected source. "It means a lot
that someone like Steve Westly,
who has had a great for-profit ca
reer, is demonstrating interest in
the innovative ideas of young peo
ple," said Williams.
The Westly Foundation also
initiated Social Impact Grants, a
new program through Stanford's
Haas Center for Public Service

granting up to $l,OOO. Structured
by the Haas's Principles of Ethical
and Effective Service, students are
free to use the money in the man
ner that best helps them.
Such support is, of course,
not new in concept. Monolithic
examples include Jeff Skoll, who
has been supporting social entre
preneurs since 1999, and of
course Bill Drayton has been lead
ing the way for multiple decades.
But these small-quantity, high-im
pact funds specifically for young
people seem to follow the flow of
Silicon Valley in a unique way that
meets the need of this young pop
ulation to create.

As Steve Westly explained, a
generation ago an entrepreneur
had to be 40 or 50 years old to
achieve real change. The Nobel
Prizes exists, but usually marks
the end of an individual's career.
But in this technological era, you
can solve a big problem in the
world when you're 16. Investing
in that reality through venture
capital or foundation dollars is
critical. I look forward to seeing
social impact being more and
more supported by our Silicon Val
ley ecosystem.
