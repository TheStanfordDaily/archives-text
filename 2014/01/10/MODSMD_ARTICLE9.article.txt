## Stanford begins its home schedule after encouraging upset win against UCLA 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
No. 4 Stanford men's volley
ball (1 -0) will face No. 8 Lewis Uni
versity (1-1) tonight in the team's
home opener before preparing to
host Grand Canyon University on
Saturday.
Fresh off a commanding per
formance in which it beat No. 2
UCLA, the Cardinal has moved up
in the national rankings, but Stan
ford will still have its work cut out
for it in the home opener. The Fly
ers have already had a tough
schedule, losing to defending na
tional champion UC-Irvine in their
season opener in four very close
sets (21-25, 25-19, 26-24, 25-23).
Four days later, Lewis faced No. 3
Brigham Young and defeated the
Cougars in four sets (25-22, 23-25,
25-21,25-23).
The Cardinal's offense looked
strong against UCLA, hitting .433
for the match. Senior outside hit
ters Brian Cook and Steven Irvin
had very solid offensive perform
ances, taking their place early on as
the leaders of Stanford's offense.
Stanford will also look toward

its four returning seniors for leader
ship and the ability to play consis
tently and with poise in a stressful

situation. Furthermore, Stanford
will be helped if sophomore setter
James Shaw can follow up his 53-as
sist match against UCLA with an
other stellar performance.
Lewis' main offensive threat
against Stanford will come from
juniors Greg Petty and Geoff Pow
ell, who both have averaged at least
3.5 kills per set so far this season.
Lewis setter BJ Boldog finished
10th in the nation last season, aver
aging 10.29 assists per set. Boldog
and Powell were named to the
2014 Preseason All-MIVA Team.
Stanford will also face Grand
Canyon in the only match at Burn
ham Pavilion this season. The
match will be Grand Canyon's sea
son opener. GCU's offense will be
led by senior outside hitter Ben
Ponnet, who is a two-time all-con
ference selection.
Tonight's match against the Fly
ers and tomorrow's against the An
telopes will both be held at 7 p.m.
