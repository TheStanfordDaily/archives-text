# Pull Up, Drank

This article is inspired by a
freshman I saw making out on
a dance floor this weekend.
Freshman year, students start
drinking. A sizable contingent of
our campus was not pounding "Nat
ty" Lights when they were in high
school, so there's novelty that
comes with the first quarter as
freshmen drink, make out with ran
dos at frats and engage in the sort
of debauchery that can accompany
the start of college.
Asher Roth, the poet and white
rapper of my generation, put it sim
ply stating, "Time isn't wasted
when you're getting wasted" in his
hit song "I Love College." Roth re
flects on his time and lessons of
higher education like remembering
to wear a condom, not leaving the
party "till the booze gone," and
"don't have sex if she's too gone." To
be honest, I'm on board with some
of these suggestions, but it also re
flects on a culture where the colle

giate expectation is a lot of alcohol
consumption.
When I arrived at college, I was
unable to sleep the night before, be
cause I was so excited to move in. I
deferred my admission for a year, so
I had been waiting for more than a
year and a half to move into Stanford.
I'd seen high school friends have
the college experience, and I longed
to meet all of the people who'd play a
role in mine. During New Student
Orientation, I already figured out
what events were attendance-option
al, met my awesome, athletic room
mate and found an 8 a.m. aerial fab
rics course on Simple Enroll (8 a.m.
rookie mistake).
I was trying to still trying to re
member people's names on the sec
ond or third night when the "water
pong" came out. Given that NSO is
one of the few mandatory dry week
ends on campus, at least for fresh
men, it was somewhat shocking to
me that we were already warming up

for the drinking games to come. With
water pong. For those who haven't
played or spectated, imagine beer
pong played with water rather than
booze.
It was kind of ludicrous that on
my third night at the best university
in the United States, the loudest,
most visible social option was to
watch large dudes throw ping pong
balls into Solo cups filled with water.
According to the National Insti
tute on Alcohol Abuse and Alco
holism, "the first six weeks of fresh
man year is an especially vulnerable
time for heavy drinking and alcohol
related consequences because of
student expectations and social
pressures at the start of the aca
demic year."
College students also have high
er rates of binge drinking than their
noncollegiate peers, and there are
scary statistics on the consequences
for excessive college drinking in re
gard to sexual abuse, injury, assault,
and death (don't drink and drive).
The drinking culture is a loud,
visible contingent in many dorms.
There are definitely positives to
drinking, but it's not the only way to
have a good time. An RA friend and
I recently talked about the impor
tance of providing visible alterna
tives to going out for residents who
want to socialize, but maybe not
drink. It can be challenging to cre
ate a comfortable environment for
residents regardless of their alcohol
policy on a given Friday or Satur
day night.
Before coming to Stanford, I'd
spent a year living in a country
where the drinking age was 18 and
spent some time in bars and clubs
accordingly. During this time, many
of my high school friends who didn't
drink started at their respective
universities.
It can be pretty fun, but I no
ticed that a lot went fairly hard at
first and then backed off. This hap
pens at Stanford too. David Brooks,
a New York Times columnist, re
cently wrote an article titled "Weed:
Been There. Done That," reflecting
on how he grew out of smoking mar
ijuana: "Like the vast majority of
people who try drugs, we aged out."
There's a similar backing-off
phenomenon for the aggregate stu
dent body's binge drinking, as we
grow older and maybe drink a little
less. It gets old.
