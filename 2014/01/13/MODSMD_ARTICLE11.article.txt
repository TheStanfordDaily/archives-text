# Fisher: NFL still reigns over all
## 
### Sam Fisher 
With the constant
grind of the college
football season, I
rarely have time to
watch many NFL
games. But now that Stanford's foot
ball season is over, I've gone back to
the ways of my youth, and I have been
rewarded greatly.
I've never been a believer in sports
conspiracy theories besides ones
involving NBA Commissioner David
Stern, of course but the way these
playoffs have set up epic matchup af
ter epic matchup has been magical.
This week, we had the power read
option bout between Colin Kaeper
nick and Cam Newton and the fran
chise quarterback battle between An
drew Luck 'l2 and Tom Brady. While
the games were certainly not instant
classics, each had great story lines
and at least some very fun action.
But those story lines don't even
come close to matching what we get
next week. Just look at the NFC
championship game, which features
the hippest NFL rivalry right now
with San FFancisco heading to Seattle.
The current edition of this rivalry
has been in the making since 2007,
when 49ers' head coach Jim Har
baugh, then the recently hired Stan
ford head coach, famously called out
Seahawks' head coach Pete Carroll,
then the head coach at USC, in a se
ries of press conferences. The
"Biggest Upset Ever" and "What's
Your Deal?" games only added to this
deeply personal feud, and with Car
roll and Harbaugh now commanding
the two dominant powers of the NFC
West, any matchup between Seattle
and San Francisco has been must-see
television.
That game still lags behind what
will surely be the biggest sports story
line of the week: Peyton Manning ver
sus Tom Brady. With Manning's Den
ver Broncos taking down the pesky
San Diego Chargers and Brady's Pa
triots easily disposing of Luck's Colts,
the two best quarterbacks of this gen
eration will meet in what could be one
of the most epic championship games
in recent memory
Based on last season's precedent,
each of these two games will probably
draw more than 40 million television
viewers. Perhaps one of them will live
up to expectations throughout the
game and be an even bigger event. Ei
ther way, it's clear' that in the month of
January, the NFL playoff games are
sports fans' best bets for a great view
ing experience.
Believe it or not, even with con
stant rhetoric around the future of
football with its concussion problem,
football's ratings are trending up
ward. According to Paulsen's data at
Sports Media Watch, 46 of America's
top 50 most watched sporting events
in 2013 were NFL games. Even more
impressive, every single one of the top
26 events was an NFL game.
Let's start doing some math.
There are only 11 playoff games in the
NFL, and, unsurprisingly, 10 of them
finished in the top 11 in ratings. The
NFL also saw regular-season domi
nance, with 16 games in the top 26.
