While the Cardinal was outhit Friday night by
Lewis .306 to .294 for the match, it was able to de
feat Lewis by playing consistently and aggres
sively on offense. After dropping the second set
and struggling to maintain a lead in the third, the
Cardinal was able to take control of the set and
demonstrated its ability to pull through and win
at home.
When Stanford found itself losing 20-15 in the
fourth set, it went on an 8-3 run to tie the set at

set. However, the offense was able to warm up,
and the Cardinal finished with a .354 hitting per
centage for the match.
Tublin, Irvin and senior outside hitter Brian
Cook led the offense with nine kills apiece for the
match. Some of the younger players helped keep
