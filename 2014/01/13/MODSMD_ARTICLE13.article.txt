## Luck falls short against Patriots 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Despite two seasons full of
fourth-quarter comebacks, An
drew Luck 'l2 and the Indianapolis
Colts sputtered late in the game
this time around and fell to the Pa
triots 43-22. The loss eliminated
the Colts from the playoffs and
sent the Patriots on to the AFC
championship game.
"We had our chances, man, to
make plays and get our offense
back on the field," said Colts safety

Antoine Bethea about the prolific
Patriots offense. "Last game, we
were able to do that, but it was a
great quarterback, a great offense
and a great team we were facing."
On just the second play of the
game, Patriots cornerback Alfonzo
Dennard, the third cousin of Michi
gan State's All-American corner
back and Jim Thorpe Award win
ner Darqueze Dennard, intercept
ed Andrew Luck's pass and re
turned it to the Colts 1-yard line.
