the Colts from the playoffs and
sent the Patriots on to the AFC
championship game.
"We had our chances, man, to
make plays and get our offense
back on the field," said Colts safety

Antoine Bethea about the prolific
Patriots offense. "Last game, we
were able to do that, but it was a
great quarterback, a great offense
and a great team we were facing."
On just the second play of the
game, Patriots cornerback Alfonzo

back and Jim Thorpe Award win

line on the subsequent drive
narrowed the deficit to 14-7.
The Patriots continued to
press and took another 14-
point lead midway through
the third quarter when run
ning back Stevan Ridley
punched in the touchdown
from 3 yards out. Another
touchdown pass from Luck
to Brazill brought the Colts
within seven at 29-22 head

Eight minutes and two
touchdowns later, the Colts
faced yet another hole as
they trailed the Patriots 14-

power of Patriots running
back LeGarrette Blount

doomed the Colts as they
watched the Patriots pull
away to victory with two
fourth quarter touchdowns.
Andrew Luck finished
the game 20-for-41 with 331

yards passing, two touch
downs and four intercep
tions. Luck's playoff run this
year saw him throw seven in
terceptions, only two fewer
than his total from the entire
regular season.
"I'm just disappointed in
myself," Luck said. "I can't
commit that many turnovers
and have a chance to win
against a great team like
this."
Tight end Coby Fleener

pivotal performers on the
Colts roster.
While the season had a
disappointing end, Luck led
the Colts to a second 11-5
finish only two years re
moved from the Colts' 2-14
season. He also answered lin
gering questions from his
rookie year about his accura
cy after halving his intercep

and finishing with a 60.2 per
cent completion rate during
the regular season.
