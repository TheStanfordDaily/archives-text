1/12, Boulder, Colo.

In the win against Utah (7-8,0-4
Pac-12), senior forward Chiney Og
wumike led the Cardinal (15-1, 4-0)
with 30 points and nine rebounds,
followed by junior point guard Am
ber Orrange with 14 points and six
assists.
Stanford did a great job on Fri
day in its 87-61 win against the
Utes, limiting the early output of
point guard Danielle Rodriguez,
making it hard for her to initiate the
offense and drive to the basket.
Ogwumike also did a stellar job
protecting the basket and keeping
leading scorer Michelle Plouffe off
the boards, as Plouffe was held to
just five points in the first half. Og
wumike herself had 17 points in the
half, and her aggressive moves to
the basket forced Plouffe to commit
three fouls before the halftime
break.
Stanford made three 3-pointers
in a four-minute stretch to go on a
14-0 run with eight minutes to play
in the first half, taking a 35-13 lead.
Senior Sara James led the run with
two 3-pointers of her own.
The Cardinal came out of the
half with a 49-29 advantage, but
Utah went on an 8-0 run five min
utes into the second half to cut the
lead to 18. Plouffe quickly picked up
her fourth foul, however, and with
her out of the game, the Card capi
talized and pulled ahead 68-43 with
10 minutes remaining. After that,

the Card never looked back with
James finishing on a fast-break
layup and Ogwumike contributing a
3 of her own to take away any mo
mentum that the Utes tried to
scrape together.
At halftime, Sunday's game at
Colorado (11-4, 1-3) was seemingly
heading in the direction of total
Cardinal domination, like the Utah
game two days earlier. The Card led
55-38 the 55 points marked the
most Stanford has scored in a first
half this season.
"I thought we had a good first
half," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Colorado played really
aggressively, they got into some
foul trouble and then we had some
young players step up."
Stanford had all of the momen
tum heading into the break after
freshman Karlie Samuelson hit a 3-
pointer at the buzzer. Samuelson
finished the game as the Card's sec
ond-leading scorer with a career
high 17 points, making five of eight
shots from behind the arc.
"I've been shooting a lot better
recently and just getting more
shots off," Samuelson said. "That
[buzzer beater] felt cool."
Colorado went through bouts of
playing well and then getting slop
py The Buffs played the Card close
to start the half but slowly slipped
away as they struggled in shooting.
The Buffs picked up the intensity in
the final minutes of the half, howev
er, improving their shooting to 39.5
percent.
The Cardinal efficiency at the
free-throw line, which saw Stanford
shoot a season-high 87.5 percent, al
lowed it to maintain an average 20-
point lead throughout most of the
afternoon until the referees
start calling a close game. By the
midpoint of the second half, both
teams were in the bonus due to mul-
tiple fouls called under the
basket and away from the
ball.
Ogwumike and Orrange
both picked up their fourth
foul with five minutes re
maining in the game. The
two-player game played by
Ogwumike (34 points, 16 re
bounds) and Orrange had
been key in setting up Ogwu
mike for the pick and roll and
Orrange for the jumper.
Colorado was also in foul
trouble as its leading scorer
and reigning Pac-12 Fresh
man of the Year, Arielle

Roberson, played with three
fouls starting early on in the
second half.
Roberson did not have a
dominant first half she was
held to just eight points
but came alive in the second
half when the Buffs needed it
most. The combined efforts of
Roberson (19 points) and
Jamee Swan (20 points, 13 re
bounds) got the Buffs within
12 of the Card with less than
10 minutes to play.
At the 2:35 marker, the
Buffs, within 10 points of the
Cardinal, applied their full
court pressure to Stanford
and managed to force
turnovers and earn key pos
sessions. But free throws and
clutch shots down the stretch
kept the Card ahead and

sealed the shaky 87-77 win.
"We turned the ball over
18 times. We didn't handle
[the full-court] pressure
very well," VanDerveer said.
"It hurts us a lot when
Chiney and Amber get into
foul trouble, but it's good to
have those kinds of games to
see how people play."
Stanford heads back on
the road later this week for
bouts with Arizona and Ari
zona State. Friday night's
game against Arizona is set
for 6 p.m. and Monday's
matchup at Arizona State
will start at 4 p.m. Both
games will be televised on
Pac-12 Networks.

three fouls before the halftime
break.
Stanford made three 3-pointers
in a four-minute stretch to go on a
14-0 run with eight minutes to play
in the first half, taking a 35-13 lead.
Senior Sara James led the run with
two 3-pointers of her own.
The Cardinal came out of the
half with a 49-29 advantage, but
Utah went on an 8-0 run five min
utes into the second half to cut the
lead to 18. Plouffe quickly picked up
her fourth foul, however, and with
her out of the game, the Card capi
talized and pulled ahead 68-43 with
10 minutes remaining. After that,

the Card never looked back with
James finishing on a fast-break
layup and Ogwumike contributing a
3 of her own to take away any mo
mentum that the Utes tried to
scrape together.
At halftime, Sunday's game at
Colorado (11-4, 1-3) was seemingly
heading in the direction of total
Cardinal domination, like the Utah
game two days earlier. The Card led
55-38 the 55 points marked the
most Stanford has scored in a first
half this season.
"I thought we had a good first
half," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "Colorado played really
aggressively, they got into some
foul trouble and then we had some
young players step up."
Stanford had all of the momen
tum heading into the break after
freshman Karlie Samuelson hit a 3-
pointer at the buzzer. Samuelson
finished the game as the Card's sec
ond-leading scorer with a career
high 17 points, making five of eight
shots from behind the arc.
"I've been shooting a lot better
recently and just getting more
shots off," Samuelson said. "That
[buzzer beater] felt cool."
Colorado went through bouts of
playing well and then getting slop
py The Buffs played the Card close
to start the half but slowly slipped
away as they struggled in shooting.
The Buffs picked up the intensity in
the final minutes of the half, howev
er, improving their shooting to 39.5
percent.
The Cardinal efficiency at the
free-throw line, which saw Stanford
shoot a season-high 87.5 percent, al
lowed it to maintain an average 20-
point lead throughout most of the
afternoon until the referees
start calling a close game. By the
midpoint of the second half, both
teams were in the bonus due to mul-
tiple fouls called under the
basket and away from the
ball.
Ogwumike and Orrange
both picked up their fourth
foul with five minutes re
maining in the game. The
two-player game played by
Ogwumike (34 points, 16 re
bounds) and Orrange had
been key in setting up Ogwu
mike for the pick and roll and
Orrange for the jumper.
Colorado was also in foul
trouble as its leading scorer
and reigning Pac-12 Fresh
man of the Year, Arielle

Roberson, played with three
fouls starting early on in the
second half.
Roberson did not have a
dominant first half she was
held to just eight points
but came alive in the second
half when the Buffs needed it
most. The combined efforts of
Roberson (19 points) and
Jamee Swan (20 points, 13 re
bounds) got the Buffs within
12 of the Card with less than
10 minutes to play.
At the 2:35 marker, the
Buffs, within 10 points of the
Cardinal, applied their full
court pressure to Stanford
and managed to force
turnovers and earn key pos
sessions. But free throws and
clutch shots down the stretch
kept the Card ahead and

sealed the shaky 87-77 win.
"We turned the ball over
18 times. We didn't handle
[the full-court] pressure
very well," VanDerveer said.
"It hurts us a lot when
Chiney and Amber get into
foul trouble, but it's good to
have those kinds of games to
see how people play."
Stanford heads back on
the road later this week for
bouts with Arizona and Ari
zona State. Friday night's
game against Arizona is set
for 6 p.m. and Monday's
matchup at Arizona State
will start at 4 p.m. Both
games will be televised on
Pac-12 Networks.

In the win against Utah (7-8,0-4
Pac-12), senior forward Chiney Og

with 30 points and nine rebounds,
followed by junior point guard Am

Stanford did a great job on Fri
day in its 87-61 win against the
Utes, limiting the early output of
point guard Danielle Rodriguez,

Ogwumike also did a stellar job
protecting the basket and keeping
leading scorer Michelle Plouffe off
the boards, as Plouffe was held to
just five points in the first half. Og
wumike herself had 17 points in the
half, and her aggressive moves to
