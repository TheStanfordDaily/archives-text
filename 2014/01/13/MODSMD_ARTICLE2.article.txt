# MUSICAL MASTERY
## SF MUSICIANS OFFER EXPERT TRAINING BY ANDIE WATERMAN 
### 
Chen Zhao sits silently in the emp
ty stands of Bing Concert Hall,
his eyes focused on the bow
strokes of the string players as
the Stanford Orchestra rehearses
Mahler's Symphony No. 2.
Zhao sees when a single violinist isn't put
ting enough "vibrato," or vibration, on the
string or is playing at the wrong end of the
bow. Not too many people know the bow
strokes for this symphony better than Zhao, a
violinist who has recorded Mahler's almost
90-minute work with the San Francisco Sym
phony.
When he spies these deviations, Zhao
picks up his violin and jumps into an empty
seat in the violin section to play along, show
ing the college musicians how he approaches
the music.
Symphony flutist Catherine Payne makes
similar demonstrations for the woodwind sec
tion and can be seen waving her arms in ex
planation while conductor Jindong Cai runs
the rehearsal. Payne and Zhao are "encourag
ing individuals," said Anna Wittstruck Ph.D.
'l5, assistant conductor of the Stanford or
chestra.
"It's very easy to feel lost in a group of
110," Wittstruck said.
For the first time, funding from a portion
of the $500,000 Andrew W Mellon Grant
awarded in 2011 to Stanford's performing
arts organization Stanford Live brought mu
sicians from the San Francisco Symphony and

the San Francisco-based Philharmonia
Baroque Orchestra to Stanford to coach its
orchestra last quarter.
Sessions will continue this quarter as the
symphony prepares Verdi's Requiem, but the
orchestra will have more sessions from San
Francisco musicians next quarter as they pre
pare Kurt Weill's sung ballet "The Seven
Deadly Sins" and Tchaikovsky's Symphony

No. 4 a work which the Stanford Sympho
ny Orchestra will watch the San Francisco
Symphony perform this February.
The Andrew W Mellon Foundation uses
the funds to hire guest artists, debut composi
tions by music faculty and support students in
designing opening acts for shows at Bing, ac
cording to Ben Frandzel, the organization's
institutional gifts officer.

The grant compensates musicians at com
petitive rates, said Wittstruck. But she noted
that this isn't the only reason musicians come
to Stanford to coach they want to teach
students who are headed for diverse careers,
but who are also very talented musicians.

With funding from a portion of the Andrew W. Mellon Grant, the Stanford Orchestra has invited San Francisco-based musicians to
coach its student members. The orchestra performed Mahler's Symphony No. 2 with the Berkeley Community Chorus in fall quarter.
Hausam plans for the grant
to support coaching sessions
again next year. When the
funds are spent after the
2014-15 academic year, indi
vidual donors will likely pro
vide enough funding to sup
port the coaching sessions,
he said.
Although professional
musicians have given coach
ing sessions through the
music department before,
the Mellon funding allowed
for almost every section of
the orchestra to receive indi
vidualized coaching from
professionals who had ex
pertise not only with the in
strument, but also with the
piece.
For example, the San
Francisco Symphony has
recorded all nine of Mahler's
symphonies, and several of
these recordings have won
Grammies. From this sym
phony, Wittstruck hired a vi
olinist, a violist, a cellist, a
flutist, an oboe player, a bas
soon player, a horn player
and a trumpet player.
"There's really no one
better to go to for Mahler
than the San Francisco Sym
phony," Wittstruck said.
"That's what they do."

Heavy on the Mahler
French horn player
Stephanie Palocz 'l6 had
great expectations for the
sectional with Robert Ward,
principal horn of the San
Francisco Symphony. Ward
has played first horn on all
of San Francisco's Mahler
recordings.
"I go to see the San Fran
cisco Symphony a few
times a quarter, whenever
I can," Palocz said. "And I
admire his playing a lot, so
it's really cool to kind of get
some tips."
As the sectional ap
proached, the horn players
knew their parts, but still
had specific questions about
the piece. When section
members got to Braun Re
hearsal Hall for the section
al, everyone was "on the
ball and ready to go," said
horn player Rebecca
Gruskin, a second-year doc
toral student in the history

department.
Ward, too, was all busi
ness. He sat down in front of
the section holding a copy of
the score, which includes
six separate horn parts for
nine horns, and had the sec
tion play through the entire
piece. When he occasionally
stopped the horns, Ward
gave succinct advice, which
applied to the particular
difficulties of the instru
ment.
For example, few people
who are not French horn
players would be able to ex
plain the best fingerings for
a technique called "stopped
horn." Players must put a
hand in the bell of the in
strument to make a more
muted, metallic sound a half
step above normal pitch. To
lower the pitch again, they
must change their fingering
"He knew exactly where
to go and what sort of prob
lems we might encounter,"
said horn player America
Reyes 'l4.
There's a passage at the
beginning of the Mahler us
ing this technique that is
very difficult to get in tune,
Gruskin said.
But Ward has a "little
chart" in his head of the best
fingerings to use in different
situations, he said. Ward sug
gested these alternate fin
gerings to the section.
One rehearsal later, the
horns played the "stopped"
parts in tune for the first
time, Gruskin said.
Students also said they
appreciated how they were
able to play the piece with
more awareness of the com
poser's ideas after the ses
sions.

Clarinetist Richard Wang
Ph.D. 'l6 said that, drawing
from their experience, San
Francisco coaches advised
woodwinds to play with vol
ume and expression to cap
ture the varied moods of
Mahler's work.
"Always exaggerate what
you're playing," he recalled
being told. "Because the au
dience hears a lot less than
you think."
Future collaboration
Zhao has worked with
Wittstruck on several per
formances in the past few
years, and they often spoke
about bringing members of
the San Francisco Symphony
to work with Stanford's or
chestra. Zhao established the
connection last year when he
coached through the music
department.
Zhao said he benefited
from stepping out of his per
formance element and teach
ing the college musicians, as
he's not usually as aware of
how he translates musical
ideas into technique this
awareness makes him a bet
ter player.
Ward also said he would
like to work with the Stan
ford musicians again.
Ward, who has coached at
music festivals and is on the
faculty at the San Francisco
Conservatory of Music with
Zhao, said he appreciates
college students' enthusiasm
for learning new pieces.
"It was really fun to be a
part of that energy," he said
when he coached at Stanford
this fall.

With funding from a portion of the Andrew W. Mellon Grant, the Stanford Orchestra has invited San Francisco-based musicians to
coach its student members. The orchestra performed Mahler's Symphony No. 2 with the Berkeley Community Chorus in fall quarter.
Hausam plans for the grant
to support coaching sessions
again next year. When the
funds are spent after the
2014-15 academic year, indi
vidual donors will likely pro
vide enough funding to sup
port the coaching sessions,
he said.
Although professional
musicians have given coach
ing sessions through the
music department before,
the Mellon funding allowed
for almost every section of
the orchestra to receive indi
vidualized coaching from
professionals who had ex
pertise not only with the in
strument, but also with the
piece.
For example, the San
Francisco Symphony has
recorded all nine of Mahler's
symphonies, and several of
these recordings have won
Grammies. From this sym
phony, Wittstruck hired a vi
olinist, a violist, a cellist, a
flutist, an oboe player, a bas
soon player, a horn player
and a trumpet player.
"There's really no one
better to go to for Mahler
than the San Francisco Sym
phony," Wittstruck said.
"That's what they do."

Heavy on the Mahler
French horn player
Stephanie Palocz 'l6 had
great expectations for the
sectional with Robert Ward,
principal horn of the San
Francisco Symphony. Ward
has played first horn on all
of San Francisco's Mahler
recordings.
"I go to see the San Fran
cisco Symphony a few
times a quarter, whenever
I can," Palocz said. "And I
admire his playing a lot, so
it's really cool to kind of get
some tips."
As the sectional ap
proached, the horn players
knew their parts, but still
had specific questions about
the piece. When section
members got to Braun Re
hearsal Hall for the section
al, everyone was "on the
ball and ready to go," said
horn player Rebecca
Gruskin, a second-year doc
toral student in the history

department.
Ward, too, was all busi
ness. He sat down in front of
the section holding a copy of
the score, which includes
six separate horn parts for
nine horns, and had the sec
tion play through the entire
piece. When he occasionally
stopped the horns, Ward
gave succinct advice, which
applied to the particular
difficulties of the instru
ment.
For example, few people
who are not French horn
players would be able to ex
plain the best fingerings for
a technique called "stopped
horn." Players must put a
hand in the bell of the in
strument to make a more
muted, metallic sound a half
step above normal pitch. To
lower the pitch again, they
must change their fingering
"He knew exactly where
to go and what sort of prob
lems we might encounter,"
said horn player America
Reyes 'l4.
There's a passage at the
beginning of the Mahler us
ing this technique that is
very difficult to get in tune,
Gruskin said.
But Ward has a "little
chart" in his head of the best
fingerings to use in different
situations, he said. Ward sug
gested these alternate fin
gerings to the section.
One rehearsal later, the
horns played the "stopped"
parts in tune for the first
time, Gruskin said.
Students also said they
appreciated how they were
able to play the piece with
more awareness of the com
poser's ideas after the ses
sions.

Clarinetist Richard Wang
Ph.D. 'l6 said that, drawing
from their experience, San
Francisco coaches advised
woodwinds to play with vol
ume and expression to cap
ture the varied moods of
Mahler's work.
"Always exaggerate what
you're playing," he recalled
being told. "Because the au
dience hears a lot less than
you think."
Future collaboration
Zhao has worked with
Wittstruck on several per
formances in the past few
years, and they often spoke
about bringing members of
the San Francisco Symphony
to work with Stanford's or
chestra. Zhao established the
connection last year when he
coached through the music
department.
Zhao said he benefited
from stepping out of his per
formance element and teach
ing the college musicians, as
he's not usually as aware of
how he translates musical
ideas into technique this
awareness makes him a bet
ter player.
Ward also said he would
like to work with the Stan
ford musicians again.
Ward, who has coached at
music festivals and is on the
faculty at the San Francisco
Conservatory of Music with
Zhao, said he appreciates
college students' enthusiasm
for learning new pieces.
"It was really fun to be a
part of that energy," he said
when he coached at Stanford
this fall.

Chen Zhao sits silently in the emp

his eyes focused on the bow
strokes of the string players as
the Stanford Orchestra rehearses
Mahler's Symphony No. 2.
Zhao sees when a single violinist isn't put
ting enough "vibrato," or vibration, on the
string or is playing at the wrong end of the
bow. Not too many people know the bow
strokes for this symphony better than Zhao, a
violinist who has recorded Mahler's almost
90-minute work with the San Francisco Sym
phony.
When he spies these deviations, Zhao
picks up his violin and jumps into an empty
seat in the violin section to play along, show
ing the college musicians how he approaches
the music.
Symphony flutist Catherine Payne makes
similar demonstrations for the woodwind sec
tion and can be seen waving her arms in ex

the rehearsal. Payne and Zhao are "encourag
