# MUSICAL MASTERY
## SF MUSICIANS OFFER EXPERT TRAINING BY ANDIE WATERMAN 
### 
Chen Zhao sits silently in the emp
ty stands of Bing Concert Hall,
his eyes focused on the bow
strokes of the string players as
the Stanford Orchestra rehearses
Mahler's Symphony No. 2.
Zhao sees when a single violinist isn't put
ting enough "vibrato," or vibration, on the
string or is playing at the wrong end of the
bow. Not too many people know the bow
strokes for this symphony better than Zhao, a
violinist who has recorded Mahler's almost
90-minute work with the San Francisco Sym
phony.
When he spies these deviations, Zhao
picks up his violin and jumps into an empty
seat in the violin section to play along, show
ing the college musicians how he approaches
the music.
Symphony flutist Catherine Payne makes
similar demonstrations for the woodwind sec
tion and can be seen waving her arms in ex
planation while conductor Jindong Cai runs
the rehearsal. Payne and Zhao are "encourag
ing individuals," said Anna Wittstruck Ph.D.
'l5, assistant conductor of the Stanford or
chestra.
"It's very easy to feel lost in a group of
110," Wittstruck said.
For the first time, funding from a portion
of the $500,000 Andrew W Mellon Grant
awarded in 2011 to Stanford's performing
arts organization Stanford Live brought mu
sicians from the San Francisco Symphony and

the San Francisco-based Philharmonia
Baroque Orchestra to Stanford to coach its
orchestra last quarter.
Sessions will continue this quarter as the
symphony prepares Verdi's Requiem, but the
orchestra will have more sessions from San
Francisco musicians next quarter as they pre
pare Kurt Weill's sung ballet "The Seven
Deadly Sins" and Tchaikovsky's Symphony

No. 4 a work which the Stanford Sympho
ny Orchestra will watch the San Francisco
Symphony perform this February.
The Andrew W Mellon Foundation uses
the funds to hire guest artists, debut composi
tions by music faculty and support students in
designing opening acts for shows at Bing, ac
cording to Ben Frandzel, the organization's
institutional gifts officer.

The grant compensates musicians at com
petitive rates, said Wittstruck. But she noted
that this isn't the only reason musicians come
to Stanford to coach they want to teach
students who are headed for diverse careers,
but who are also very talented musicians.

With funding from a portion of the Andrew W. Mellon Grant, the Stanford Orchestra has invited San Francisco-based musicians to
coach its student members. The orchestra performed Mahler's Symphony No. 2 with the Berkeley Community Chorus in fall quarter.
