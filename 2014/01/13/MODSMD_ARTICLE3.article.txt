# NO DUCK PROBLEM
## BROWN KEYS CARD UPSET 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team
finally found an opponent that was reel
ing worse than it was and took advantage
of the opportunity to score a win over a
ranked opponent on the road.
The Cardinal (10-5, 1-2 Pac-12) held
on to defeat the No. 17 Oregon Ducks
(13-3,1-3 Pac-12) 82-80 on Sunday, giving
Stanford its first Pac-12 win of the sea
son while handing Oregon its third con
secutive loss. After starting the year 13-
0, the Ducks have now lost to Colorado,
California and Stanford in consecutive
games.

The game was a fight to the finish as
the Cardinal was not able to secure the
victory until senior forward Dwight Pow
ell corralled Dominic Artis' missed layup
attempt that rolled off the front of the
rim as time expired. Paired with Stan
ford's upset win earlier this season at
UConn, the victory over the Ducks
marks the first time the Cardinal has
won multiple road games over ranked
teams in the same season since the 2001-
02 campaign, and the first time it has de
feated two ranked teams home or away
since the 2008-09 season.
After struggling through a 1-10
shooting night against Oregon State,
senior guard Anthony Brown came out
on fire this time around, making his first
seven shots en route to a career-high 24
points. He finished 10-of-12 from the
floor and added six rebounds, two assists
and a steal.
"After going 1-10 against Oregon
State on Thursday, I just had to move
forward," Brown said. "I haven't had a
game like that all season. I told the team
I felt like I let them down. During this
game, I just wanted to make sure my en
ergy level was there."
"Anthony stepped up," said junior
guard Chasson Randle. "The starters
had a talk after the Oregon State game
