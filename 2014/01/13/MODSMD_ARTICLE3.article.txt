# NO DUCK PROBLEM
## BROWN KEYS CARD UPSET 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team
finally found an opponent that was reel
ing worse than it was and took advantage
of the opportunity to score a win over a
ranked opponent on the road.
The Cardinal (10-5, 1-2 Pac-12) held
on to defeat the No. 17 Oregon Ducks
(13-3,1-3 Pac-12) 82-80 on Sunday, giving
Stanford its first Pac-12 win of the sea
son while handing Oregon its third con
secutive loss. After starting the year 13-
0, the Ducks have now lost to Colorado,
California and Stanford in consecutive
games.

The game was a fight to the finish as
the Cardinal was not able to secure the
victory until senior forward Dwight Pow
ell corralled Dominic Artis' missed layup
attempt that rolled off the front of the
rim as time expired. Paired with Stan
ford's upset win earlier this season at
UConn, the victory over the Ducks
marks the first time the Cardinal has
won multiple road games over ranked
teams in the same season since the 2001-
02 campaign, and the first time it has de
feated two ranked teams home or away
since the 2008-09 season.
After struggling through a 1-10
shooting night against Oregon State,
senior guard Anthony Brown came out
on fire this time around, making his first
seven shots en route to a career-high 24
points. He finished 10-of-12 from the
floor and added six rebounds, two assists
and a steal.
"After going 1-10 against Oregon
State on Thursday, I just had to move
forward," Brown said. "I haven't had a
game like that all season. I told the team
I felt like I let them down. During this
game, I just wanted to make sure my en
ergy level was there."
"Anthony stepped up," said junior
guard Chasson Randle. "The starters
had a talk after the Oregon State game

and Anthony stepped up
and said, 'l've got you guys.
We're going to do it togeth
er but I'm going to step up
next game.'"
While Brown led the
scoring for Stanford, Ran
dle nearly matched him
with 23 points, capping a
stellar offensive week for
the Cardinal's leading scor
er. After scoring 30 points
and shooting over 50 per
cent from the floor against
Oregon State on Thursday,
Randle was again efficient,
finishing 8-of-14 from the
field, including 2-for-4 from
the 3-point range.
Stanford's starting
backcourt was stellar on
Sunday, and it had to be, be
cause senior frontcourt
starters Josh Huestis and
Stefan Nastic struggled
mightily. Although Powell
tallied 14 points, six assists,
and five rebounds, Huestis
finished the game 0-for-7
from the field, and Nastic
registered just four points
and three rebounds before
fouling out after playing on
ly 12 minutes.
As a result, the bench
was forced to play more ex
tensive minutes. Depth has
been an issue for Stanford
all season long, especially
given the injuries sustained
by Andy Brown, Christian
Sanders, Aaron Bright and
Rosco Allen. On Sunday,
Stanford's bench was actu
ally something of an asset,
as seniors Robbie Lemons
and John Gage and fresh
man Marcus Allen managed
to chip in a combined 16
points, five rebounds and
two assists. It was a dra
matic improvement from
the previous two games,
when the substitutes only
managed to contribute two
points total against Cal and
Oregon State.
Stanford led Oregon 59-
50 after an Anthony Brown
jump shot with 13:30 left to
play, and then somehow
managed to withstand a
stretch in which the Ducks
scored a 3-pointer on four
straight possessions, three
of them by senior forward
Mike Moser.
The Cardinal was able to
counter with a 3 and a pair
of 2-point baskets of its own
to keep the lead at four, and
it would manage to cling to
a similarly small lead for
the rest of the game. The
Ducks failed to capitalize on
the five free throws Stan
ford missed down the
stretch, including three in
the final 14 seconds of the
game.
"We hadn't won a Pac-12
game, so it's good to get one
under your belt," said head
coach Johnny Dawkins.
"The way we did it was re
ally good because I felt the
guys had to dig deep and
make some plays at the end
to secure the lead."
Dawkins and Stanford
will hope that this game can
serve as a turning point for
the season moving forward.
The Cardinal will look to es
tablish some consistently
strong play when it hosts
Washington State on
Wednesday night at 7 p.m.

the final 14 seconds of the
game.
"We hadn't won a Pac-12
game, so it's good to get one
under your belt," said head
coach Johnny Dawkins.
"The way we did it was re
ally good because I felt the
guys had to dig deep and
make some plays at the end
to secure the lead."
Dawkins and Stanford
will hope that this game can
serve as a turning point for
the season moving forward.
The Cardinal will look to es
tablish some consistently
strong play when it hosts

The Stanford men's basketball team
finally found an opponent that was reel
ing worse than it was and took advantage
of the opportunity to score a win over a
ranked opponent on the road.
The Cardinal (10-5, 1-2 Pac-12) held
on to defeat the No. 17 Oregon Ducks
(13-3,1-3 Pac-12) 82-80 on Sunday, giving
Stanford its first Pac-12 win of the sea
son while handing Oregon its third con
secutive loss. After starting the year 13-
0, the Ducks have now lost to Colorado,
California and Stanford in consecutive
games.

The game was a fight to the finish as
the Cardinal was not able to secure the
victory until senior forward Dwight Pow
ell corralled Dominic Artis' missed layup
attempt that rolled off the front of the
rim as time expired. Paired with Stan
ford's upset win earlier this season at
UConn, the victory over the Ducks
marks the first time the Cardinal has
won multiple road games over ranked
teams in the same season since the 2001-
02 campaign, and the first time it has de
feated two ranked teams home or away
since the 2008-09 season.
After struggling through a 1-10
shooting night against Oregon State,
senior guard Anthony Brown came out
on fire this time around, making his first
seven shots en route to a career-high 24
points. He finished 10-of-12 from the
floor and added six rebounds, two assists
and a steal.
"After going 1-10 against Oregon
State on Thursday, I just had to move
forward," Brown said. "I haven't had a
game like that all season. I told the team
I felt like I let them down. During this
game, I just wanted to make sure my en
ergy level was there."
"Anthony stepped up," said junior
guard Chasson Randle. "The starters
had a talk after the Oregon State game

While Brown led the
scoring for Stanford, Ran
dle nearly matched him
with 23 points, capping a
stellar offensive week for
the Cardinal's leading scor
er. After scoring 30 points
and shooting over 50 per
cent from the floor against
Oregon State on Thursday,
Randle was again efficient,
finishing 8-of-14 from the
field, including 2-for-4 from
the 3-point range.
Stanford's starting
backcourt was stellar on
Sunday, and it had to be, be
cause senior frontcourt
starters Josh Huestis and
Stefan Nastic struggled
mightily. Although Powell
tallied 14 points, six assists,
and five rebounds, Huestis
finished the game 0-for-7
from the field, and Nastic
registered just four points
and three rebounds before
fouling out after playing on
ly 12 minutes.
As a result, the bench
was forced to play more ex
tensive minutes. Depth has
been an issue for Stanford
all season long, especially
given the injuries sustained
by Andy Brown, Christian
Sanders, Aaron Bright and
Rosco Allen. On Sunday,
Stanford's bench was actu
ally something of an asset,
as seniors Robbie Lemons
and John Gage and fresh
man Marcus Allen managed
to chip in a combined 16
points, five rebounds and
two assists. It was a dra
matic improvement from
the previous two games,
when the substitutes only
managed to contribute two
points total against Cal and
Oregon State.
Stanford led Oregon 59-
50 after an Anthony Brown
jump shot with 13:30 left to
play, and then somehow
managed to withstand a
stretch in which the Ducks
scored a 3-pointer on four
straight possessions, three
of them by senior forward
Mike Moser.
The Cardinal was able to
counter with a 3 and a pair
of 2-point baskets of its own
to keep the lead at four, and
it would manage to cling to
a similarly small lead for
the rest of the game. The
Ducks failed to capitalize on
the five free throws Stan
ford missed down the
stretch, including three in
the final 14 seconds of the
game.
