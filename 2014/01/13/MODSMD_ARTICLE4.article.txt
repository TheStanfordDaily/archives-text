## PA suspends car-dwelling ban for a year Need, for more outreach, education prompts delay of law's enforcement 
### SAM KURLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Dec. 16 the Palo Alto City Council
unanimously voted to delay the enforcement
of the Vehicle Habitation Ordinance (VHO)
which prohibits the act of living in a vehi
cle within city limits for up to one year or
until an appellate court rules on a topically
related Los Angeles case that may affect the
local ordinance's enforcement.
The ordinance originally passed on Aug. 5
and was scheduled to take effect six months
after its passage to allow time for communi

wrote a letter to Palo Alto City Attorney
Molly Stump alleging that the ordinance vio

citizens. The letter requested a meeting with
the city attorney to resolve the matter out
side of court by Dec. 5. Stump obliged and
the parties met to discuss the ordinance, out
of which Stump agreed to recommend that
the City Council to suspend enforcement.
Later that month in a memo to the City
Council, City Manager James Keene recom
mended that enforcement of the VHO be
stayed pending resolution of a Los Angeles
case, describing the pending matter as "a
case whose decision may provide further
clarification regarding legal requirements
governing ordinances prohibiting vehicle
habitation."
The Southern California case challenges
a Los Angeles ordinance restricting certain
activities that homeless people frequently
participate in, such as holding a sign that
asks for donations.
Abrams said that the judges for the 9th
Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals who
heard an oral argument over the Los Ange
