## PA suspends car-dwelling ban for a year Need, for more outreach, education prompts delay of law's enforcement 
### SAM KURLAND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Dec. 16 the Palo Alto City Council
unanimously voted to delay the enforcement
of the Vehicle Habitation Ordinance (VHO)
which prohibits the act of living in a vehi
cle within city limits for up to one year or
until an appellate court rules on a topically
related Los Angeles case that may affect the
local ordinance's enforcement.
The ordinance originally passed on Aug. 5
and was scheduled to take effect six months
after its passage to allow time for communi
ty outreach and education about the new law.
Stanford consulting professor William
Abrams '76, an expert on constitutional law,
is one of a number of attorneys who are rep
resenting citizens to be affected by the VHO
and threatening to challenge the new ordi
nance in court.
In November, the team of attorneys
wrote a letter to Palo Alto City Attorney
Molly Stump alleging that the ordinance vio
lates the constitutional rights of Palo Alto
citizens. The letter requested a meeting with
the city attorney to resolve the matter out
side of court by Dec. 5. Stump obliged and
the parties met to discuss the ordinance, out
of which Stump agreed to recommend that
the City Council to suspend enforcement.
Later that month in a memo to the City
Council, City Manager James Keene recom
mended that enforcement of the VHO be
stayed pending resolution of a Los Angeles
case, describing the pending matter as "a
case whose decision may provide further
clarification regarding legal requirements
governing ordinances prohibiting vehicle
habitation."
The Southern California case challenges
a Los Angeles ordinance restricting certain
activities that homeless people frequently
participate in, such as holding a sign that
asks for donations.
Abrams said that the judges for the 9th
Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals who
heard an oral argument over the Los Ange
les case seemed unfriendly to the Los Ange
les law.
"From what everybody sees from the way
the three-judge panel re
ceived the arguments, they
were quite hostile to the city
in trying to defend the law,"
Abrams said.
Keene also wrote in the
memo that an additional pe
riod of public outreach prior
to enforcement would help
the Palo Alto City Council
answer citizens' questions
about the scope of the new
ordinance.
If the city of Palo Alto de
cides to enforce the ordi
nance after the suspension
expires, Abrams said that
his clients would not hesitate
to file suit.
"If they revoke the sus
pension, we will be in court,"
he said. "We will sue the city,
and I am confident we will
get an order that will enjoin
any enforcement of [the
VHO]."
Claudia Keith, Palo Alto
chief communications officer,
said that the city of Palo Alto
believes the ordinance would
withstand that challenge.
However, she also said that
the city may choose to make
changes to the ordinance
based on the outcome of the
Los Angeles case.
"Depending on what hap
pens in [the Los Angeles]
court case, there may or may
not be changes to the ordi
nance or the way it is ap
proached," Keith said.
Concerns of a developing
trend
Chuck Jagoda, who came
to Palo Alto four years ago,
has spent the better part of
his time in the city living in
cars, with friends or on the
ground. He said that while
the ordinance might not di
rectly affect him, he is
alarmed by an apparent
trend of recent laws un
friendly to homeless people
in Palo Alto.
"If you listen to the words
[Palo Alto City Council
members] use, their big fear
is that Palo Alto will become
a magnet for homeless peo
ple," Jagoda said. "That's
consistent with their ordi
nances over the years, with
their ordinances making it il
legal to camp along San

Francisquito Creek, and no
bathrooms in parks, and this
ordinance here."
"[lf there is] not purpose
ful or intentional policy to
drive away homeless people,
there is at least an acciden
tal, default or 'de facto' to
use Jim Keene, the city man
ager's favorite phrase
policy to drive out homeless
people," Jagoda said.
Keith emphasized that
the ordinance was intended
to be enforced only in cases
in which residents have com
plained about an individual's

conduct.
"Our police officers are
not going out on patrol look
ing for folks living in their
vehicles," Keith said. "The
council decided to pass what
is essentially a complaint
based ordinance. It really
just provides our police offi
cers with a tool."
Jagoda was skeptical of
the need for a new authority
under which police officers
can cite homeless people in
case of a disturbance.
"The thing that's worri
some is that this weapon

they call it a tool, I would call
it a weapon why would
anyone think they needed
this? I'm intimidated by po
licemen, period," Jagoda
said. "They don't need any
more weaponry as far as I'm
concerned. I'm afraid of
them now."
A short-term solution
Advocates both for and
against the VHO agree that
the new law does not provide
Palo Alto with the means to
address the underlying real
ity of homelessness in the
city.
"Our clients have been on
waiting lists for shelters for
years," Abrams said. "Not
months, but years. We don't
have the shelters available.
So while society really needs
to deal with the issue [of
homelessness] and not just
sweep human beings under
the rug, the city of Palo Alto
has enacted this law, which
besides being unfair and re
ally wrong, is unconstitution
al."
Both Keith and Abrams
emphasized the importance
of partnering with communi
ties outside of Palo Alto to
more effectively address the
problem of homelessness in
the city.
"As a city, we can't solve it
ourselves," Keith said.
"We've partnered with Santa
Clara County. We are provid
ing funding for case workers
to help individuals find shel
ter."
Keith said Palo Alto has
committed $250,000 to work
with the city of Santa Clara
and other partners to help
homeless individuals find
housing.
