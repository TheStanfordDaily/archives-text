## Stanford researchers close to universal flu vaccine 
### â€“ Helin Gao 
A recent study led by Stan
ford researchers and pub
lished online on Dec. 16 brings
the medical community a step
closer towards the creation of
a universal flu vaccine.
Led by James Swartz
a professor of chemical engi
neering and bioengineering
and authored by postdoc
toral researcher Yuan Lu and
John Welsh M.S. 'OB Ph.D.
'll, the research presents a
vaccine that covers a broad
spectrum of viruses.
Rather than focusing on

the heads of hemagglutinin
a protein attached to the
influenza virus' surface
the new vaccine reproduces
the stem of the hemagglu
tinin which largely remains
unchanged and allows for a
better understanding of the
protein's structure.
While the efficacy of this
new vaccine has yet to be
seen, researchers aim to cre
ate an inactivated virus tar
get to elicit an immune re
sponse. If successful, the new
approach will shrink the time
frame for protein production
from weeks to hours.
Before put into practice,
the new vaccine has to under
go safety and efficacy tests
on animals and eventually
humans.
