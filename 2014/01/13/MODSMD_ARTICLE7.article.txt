## OP-ED OMG BDSM 
### 
Whether it has impacted you
personally or not, you prob
ably know how college ro
mance usually goes. A guy, with fan
tasies of sex or romance, approaches
a girl. As long as she doesn't tell him
to stop, he pushes small boundaries: a
surprise compliment or tease, a touch
of her hair, a casual arm around her, a
stolen kiss in the heat of the moment.
Alcohol and the ambiance of a
crowd encourages both to do less sec
ond-guessing. If she's pretty and
kind, and he isn't awkward, they
eventually whether in hours or
months end up together in a dark
room, wordlessly stealing bases.
It isn't a surprise why this game of
hints, nudges and assumptions doesn't
work for the kinkyâ€”that is, people
whose desires lie outside the norms of
sexuality or relationships. You can't as
sume what you want is in line with
what they want, or even, that what you
want won't be extremely violating to
them.
Before you decide to open your re
lationship up to multiple partners, don
a diaper for an hour of cuddling, or put
an ice cube in your mouth before oral
sex, everyone involved has to commu
nicate what they want and consent to
what they'll be doing.
Otherwise, it's alarmingly likely
that someone will be physically or
emotionally hurt, perhaps to the point
of violation. Pushing boundaries is one
of the most psychotic habits one could
have and, paired with alcohol's delete
rious impact on decision-making, re
markably dangerous.
Consent and, more broadly, open
communication are, by necessity the
foundation of kink since mainstream
assumptions about sex and relation
ships no longer apply.
But did they ever apply? What's
the difference between kink and
vanilla?
The aesthetics and shock value of
kink are vastly overplayed, so instead
of describing kink through common
fantasies, I'll enumerate a few com
mon reasons people identify as kinky.
One: The sex or intimacy I want is
shamed or uncommon in mainstream
society, but it can be accepted and
even desired in the kink community.
Two: I dislike how integral alcohol
and pushing boundaries are to having
sex, and prefer a community that em
phasizes consent. Three: I want to
feel desired male, trans, over
weight, cross-dresser, handicapped,
etc. Four: I love applying my brain to
sex. Five: It's fun! Six: I'm interested
in feeling pleasure besides in areas
other than the genitals.
Everyone's sexuality is
different. It can consist of a different
anatomy, libido, orientation, interests,
orgasm, ways to orgasm, etc. In this
spectrum of sexuality the line be
tween kink and vanilla is simply the
line where society starts judging.
The difference between being
kinky and being vanilla is the same as
the difference between being straight
and being gay. Besides the fact that
some people are considered outside
the cultural norm and some are not,
there is no fundamental difference,
and the reality is that most people lie
somewhere in between the two ex
tremes.
In a perfectly sex-positive world,
there would be no such thing as
"kinky." Whether one's sexuality is
due to genetics or a choice wouldn't
matter, and sex wouldn't be a game
with very convoluted rules that name

"winners" and "losers."
I don't mean to paint kink as a per
fect wonderland. Tlie reality is that it
kink exists in the context of modern
society complete with sexual assault,
social biases (sexism, racism, etc.) and
discrimination.
The entile kink community, in
cluding Kardinal Kink, functions un
der as much anonymity as possible.
Many fear the impact being outed
would have on their career and rela
tionships.
Many understand and respect our
anonymity, but so few question why it
is necessary and what negative im
pact this legacy of silence has on indi
viduals.
Kardinal Kink is just what it
sounds like: a Stanford group for all
things kink, and a two-pronged effort
to create a support system for Stan
ford students to safely explore kink
and to campaign for the legitimacy of
kink.
There seem to be more kink-iden
tified people than queer or LGBT
identified people, but one can major in
Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Stud
ies and never read an article about
kink by someone kink-identified.
There are no resources at Yaden
or the LGBT-CRC that address kink.
There are no classes on campus that
explore kink as anything more than a
footnote. This isn't Stanford's fault in
particular, but rather evidence of a
widespread tendency for "legitimate"
organizations to not acknowledge
kink, for fear of being associated with
it.
There is so little research into
kink that we hardly even know what
demographics it reflects, let alone the
problems it faces. One exception, a
survey by the National Coalition for
Sexual Freedom, found that a third of
kink-identified people, including the
heavily closeted, report experiencing
discrimination based on their in
volvement with kink.
More than half of that discrimina
tion came from medical professionals
and a quarter from government or
police officials, which implies that
these much-needed services system
atically fall short of serving this pop
ulation's needs.
This has a concrete, negative im
pact: Isolation and a lack of resources
puts many newcomers to kink at a
high risk of abuse. In turn, there are
few resources available for those who
have their consent broken in an un
conventional circumstance. While the
kink community tries to enforce con
sent and offer resources and medical
knowledge to those who need it, it
should be the job of the police and
relevant professionals.
I am not calling for a large-scale
civil rights movement like the gay
rights movement, but am asking the
local community Stanford as a
university and as a campus to re
spect kink as a gender and sexuality
minority in academia and in services
on campus. Although kink is current
ly dismissed as an individual's crazy
sexual tastes, it represents a world of
enthusiastic consent that encourages
you to craft the relationships and live
the experiences that truly satisfy
you; a world that must function in si
lence and in isolation.
