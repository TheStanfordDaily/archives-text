# YANKEY NFL BOUND
## All-American will forgo fifth year to enter the draft 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
In a widely expected decision,
Stanford left guard David Yankey
announced today that he will forgo
his final year of eligibility and en
ter the 2014 NFL Draft.
The 6-foot-5, 313-pound senior
has been a fixture on a dominant
Stanford offensive line for the past
three seasons and earned consen
sus All-American status the past
two seasons, becoming the first
Stanford player in over 30 years to
achieve the honor in consecutive
years. Although Yankey has played
in each of the past four seasons, he
could have earned an additional
year of eligibility through a med
ical redshirt because he suffered a
season-ending injury early in his
freshman year.
With Yankey's departure, the
Cardinal will lose its only offensive
captain from last season and an in
strumental cog in its bread-and
butter power run game. With his
impeccable body control that de
fied his gargantuan size, Yankey
frequently pulled from his guard
position to open holes for Stanford
running backs, allowing running
back Stepfan Taylor 'l3 to rush for

1,530 yards in 2012 and senior run
ning back Tyler Gaffney to gain
1,709 yards in 2013.
Yankey's decision, along with
the departure of fifth-year seniors
Kevin Danser and Khalil Wilkes,
leaves Stanford with considerable
amount of turnover on the offen
sive line. Sophomore Josh Garnett,
who replaced Yankey in the start
ing lineup against Washington
State after Yankey returned home
following the death of his father,
appears to be the obvious heir ap
parent at the left guard. Aside
from his one start, Garnett's fre
quent presence on the field as the
Cardinal's extra lineman or full
back in jumbo formations gives
him a sizeable amount of experi
ence under his belt as he will likely
try to replace one of the most dec
orated players in Stanford history.
At the next level, Yankey is ex
pected to be among the first interi
or offensive linemen taken in the
draft. Because NFL teams typical
ly do not value guards as a high
priority position, the senior from
Roswell, Ga., is currently projected
to go in the late first round or ear
ly second round.
Regardless of where he falls in
the draft, Yankey's size, athleti
cism and durability will almost cer
tainly provide him with an opportu
nity to compete for a starting job
right away and give him a chance
to level defenders and open run
ning lanes for NFL running backs,
as he has done countless times as
the anchor of Stanford's offensive

line.
Last week, senior inside line
backer A.J. Tarpley and senior de
fensive end Henry Anderson an
nounced that they would return to
Stanford for the 2013 season. Sen
ior right tackle Cam Fleming and

senior free safety Ed Reynolds
have yet to announce their deci
sion. The deadline to declare is this
Wednesday.
