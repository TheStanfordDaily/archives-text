## Conrad Ray discusses last fall, outlook 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
In advance of the 201 j Stanford men's
golf season, The Daily's Cameron
Miller spoke with men's golf head coach
Conrad Ray to get perspective on
events since the end of last season. Be
low is the transcript of their conversa
tion.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Now that we're
a month removed from the team's fall sched
ule, what are your biggest takeaways from
the four tournaments your team played?
Conrad Ray (CR): I think we were all happy
with the fall. I think that at this point in the
year, we're in the position where we're work
ing on things landmines, roadblocks,
whatever you might say that are in our
way of being at our best in the spring. That's
what our fall schedule provided us: a great
data sample and getting a bunch of guys ex
perience. Eight out of our 10 players on the
team saw some action in tournament play.
We played some very good competition on
some difficult golf courses and in different
conditions than we might see everyday at
Stanford, so there's a ton of positives after
our fall campaign.
TSD: Was there a tournament or individual
performance that was of particular note to
you?

CR: I think tournament-wise, clearly our win

at Erin Hills was a neat experience. I felt like
our guys were on top of their game. We had a
good game plan that week, so to pick up a win
in that field very competitive, beating
UCLA, SMU and some good teams was a
positive.
On the individual side, finishes of note
would include Cameron Wilson picking up his
first individual win as a senior in one of the
staunchest fields we'll have all year at
Olympia Fields. That really was a spring
board for him all fall, and I felt like he played
with a lot of confidence. He did some great
things for our team.

Conrad Ray '97 is in his 10th year as the
head coach of Stanford's men's golf program.
This spring's squad promises to be
one the strongest in Cardinal history.
TSD: It seems like the
team's big win at Erin Hills
was the signature event of
the fall. What are the big
lessons the team can take
from that tournament
specifically?

CR: Our team, the group
that we've put together
including the younger guys
coming up behind —we
rarely lack in offense. Our
problems often lie in de
fense. What I mean by that
is the bigger numbers. We
did a good job that week, mi
nus a weird bobble from Jim
Liu on the last day, from
keeping our ball out of trou
ble, eliminating the double
bogeys and using our short
games and scoring ability to
keep it close to the center
line.

TSD: What were your goals
for the team in the fall sea
son, given the NCAA Cham
pionships are more than six
months away? What do you
look for as a coach during
this period?

CR: What comes out of the
more tournaments you play
and the trips you make is you
start to realize the certain
roles guys have on the team.
I think that's an important
thing. Each guy is preparing
to win the golf tournament,
but as a coach you're think
ing: "Who are the five I can
put out there that give us the
best chance to win?" So
that's what helpful for me. I
also think momentum is key.
Obviously, winning momen
tum is a great thing, but
there's oftentimes when
we'll go play a tournament

and even though the result
may be a spot or two lower
on the board, we'll feel pret
ty good about what hap
pened. Maybe we played a
great final round or we over
came something. Looking at
the team from the 10,000-
foot level and saying, "Okay,
what group can we put out
there that creates the best
momentum and gives us the
best vibes when we're on the
road?"

TSD: Your squad is a mix of
experience and youth. Let's
turn first to the veterans
Cam Wilson and Patrick
Rodgers. What did you think
of their play this fall, and
how have they stepped into
bigger leadership roles?

CR: It's fun to see that
every year. Guys step up and
become leaders, and they
get in a position where
they're playing with confi
dence. They know the
courses oftentimes that
we're going to, they know
what to expect, how to lay
out their schedules for peak
performance. So both those
guys have done a great job
with that. Both of them
picked up an individual win,
so that's great momentum.
I would say with Cameron,
out of all of the guys, was
on top of his game the most.
That doesn't necessarily
mean he's shooting the best
scores —he and Patrick,
they're kind of hand in
hand there in terms of scor
ing. Rodgers made up for
maybe a little bit of a down
turn in his ball striking
with a great short game
and mental approach, some
great final rounds. I think
they're both in great posi
tion to be Ail-Americans and
lead us as we move through
this spring. It was neat to
see.

TSD: For these two especial
ly, the 2012-13 season cer
tainly did not end how they
wanted it to. How have you
seen the disappointing finish
to last year motivate Cam
and Patrick during the early
portion of this season?

CR: I think after something
like that that happens, the
one thing you can't ever do is
take things for granted. Not
to say we did last year, but I
think every year college golf
gets deeper. So I think now
our guys especially those
two leading us there is
more of a sense of urgency
maybe, and I think that's a
healthy thing. There's a lot
of intrinsic motivation with
this group, and I don't have
to bug them to practice a
whole lot. These guys work
hard; I think that's driven
by the older guys but also
by the younger guys.

TSD: You also played three
freshmen in your lineup this
fall. In what ways did you
see them grow during the
four tournaments, and do
you see them playing a big
role during the spring?

CR: I do. I think as much as
they played, all three of
them can play better, which
is great. I think as far as golf
experience goes, Viraat Bad
hwar and Jim Liu have
played as much golf, if not
more, than a lot of guys on
the team. They might be
freshmen in age, but espe
cially Jim and Viraat com
ing in as highly touted re
cruits — and Maverick Mc-
Nealy too, it's just that he
hadn't had the same expo
sure to national golf as those
other guys. I think those two
guys we're going to lean on
and expect big things from
this spring. It's good to have
some young guys who are
pushing. They know that one
day they'll maybe be in the
spot that Rodgers and Cam
are right now.
We pay a lot of attention
to our short games and scor
ing shots, and I think espe
cially Viraat and Maverick
saw that come out in their
scores. I think at the college
level, it's often not about hit
ting it better but scoring
more. And how do you do
that? Well, you chip and
putt, scramble better and
make your bad days better. I

saw big growth in both of
those guys' short games.
Jim Liu had a solid short
game to begin with, and he's
continued to work on that. I
think the other thing we
worked on is shot value. And
what I mean by that is con
trolling your trajectory, con
trolling your golf ball, leav
ing it in the right spot and
understanding how to use
those tools and take it to the
new course you're experi
encing. It's really just in
creasing odds of perform
ance, and that's what we fo
cused on.

TSD: Will your guys play
any tournaments this win
ter? How important is it for
them to stay sharp when
there are no NCAA events
during this period?

CR: I think it's a balance. I
think for some of the guys
that played a ton this fall
a guy like Patrick Rodgers
they came off of a very
busy summer. So for him,
maybe this time is spent bet
ter resting, recharging the
battery. He's testing some
new equipment and some
stuff that's going to benefit
him down the road. But for a
guy like Patrick Grimes, for
example, who kind of got a
couple events in there as our
fourth or fifth guy, he's go
ing to go play some local
events. He also signed up for
a big event down in Miami,
the South Beach Amateur
[and missed the cut].
Cameron Wilson has been
asked to join a U.S. contin
gent down to Australia with
Viraat Badhwar. They're go
ing to play in the Masters of
the Amateurs, which is a big
Australian amateur event.
Viraat is actually the defend
ing champion that was a
big one that he marked on
his resume before he got to
Stanford.

TSD: What has been the
point of emphasis so far dur
ing your team's offseason
work? Is there one overarch
ing theme you've been focus
ing on or is it very individual
specific?

CR: In an offseason, as guys
are digesting their tourna
ment information after the
fall, if every guy does their
part to get one percent bet
ter in every area of their

game and worry about their
own business, that's really
going to feed up to the team
experience. These guys real
ly do have a great team dy
namic, but that's motivating
them to go take care of their
own business and be the guy
that everyone can lean on
when they need to.
We take a very strong
statistical approach. We not
only track rounds at school,
but tournament rounds. So
within those rounds in that
data set, we have a very good
understanding of what each
guy needs to work on indi
vidually. So we give them
practice plans based on that.
It's funny, though, because
there are a lot of common
points. I mentioned earlier
that short game becomes an
undercurrent theme: If you
can have a short game as
team, you're going to do well.
So we stress that as a group,
but we also know that each
guy very specific, individual
things that he can work in to
his practice routines.

TSD: Is there anyone on
your team that we haven't
yet talked about that you be
lieve could play a pivotal role
in your team's success in the
coming months? How do you
feel about your team's depth
at this point?

CR: That's the beauty of the
group we have. It's hard to
predict that. You get a guy
like Dominick Francks, who
came in hitting the ball bet
ter than he has his whole life.
He qualified for our first
event. Then he hit some
roadblocks with his putting,
but he's started to shore that
up. He's a whale of a competi
tor and an athlete and a guy
who's had some experience,
so he's a guy that could bust
in there. And then you got
guys like Shane Lebow who's
a senior and hasn't played a
ton, but he's in that mode
where "Okay, my time at
Stanford is ending, it's wind
ing down." He's relaxed and
enjoying golf and enjoys be
ing around the team. So you
just never know, right? That's
the beauty of golf—it can
change on a dime, for sure.
I'm excited about [the
team's depth]. I think that's a
huge key to successful col
lege teams. You can have a lot
of depth, but you also need
one or two guys to break out

of their current trends. I
think if you look at the histo
ry of teams who are winning
at the end of the year, they
typically have one or two
guys that are doing some
thing different than they did
in the fall, overachieving. So
we're looking for who that's
going to be we don't know
yet.

TSD: The Pac-12 Conference
has been ultra-competitive in
men's golf in recent memory.
Do you expect much of the
same this spring? What are
the advantages and disad
vantages of playing in such a
stacked league?

CR: I think the league has
never been stronger. I like
our position in the league so
far. I think we're right near
No. 2 on the list, nipping at
Cal's heels a little bit. We're
pushing them. I think we'll
see a lot of those schools in
the spring, and that's how it
usually works. We stay more
west with our schedule, and
so it's a challenge. One of the
big goals we've talked about
is seeing if we pull in that
Pac-12 crown that's some
thing that's been a little bit
elusive for us, even in my ca
reer actually.

TSD: Now looking even past
the spring season, your pro
gram recently added three
signees for the class of 2018.
Talk about what Franklin,
Bradley and Jeffrey will
bring to the team in the com
ing years.

CR: They're going to bring a
bunch to the team. I think
they're all great student ath
letes, all really good guys.
They have very diverse back
grounds, which I think is
kind of neat. We have one lo
cal guy, one Midwestern guy
and one SoCal guy. They all
have won tournaments
they all have tremendous up
side in our estimation. They
don't bring with them a top
-10 ranking, but that's okay.
We like that, because we feel
like they'll play their way in
to that position. They're open
to joining a really good team
and having great weather,
great facilities at their dis
posal to see what can hap
pen.

lessons the team can take
from that tournament
specifically?

CR: Our team, the group
that we've put together
including the younger guys
coming up behind —we
rarely lack in offense. Our
problems often lie in de
fense. What I mean by that
is the bigger numbers. We
did a good job that week, mi
nus a weird bobble from Jim
Liu on the last day, from
keeping our ball out of trou
ble, eliminating the double
bogeys and using our short
games and scoring ability to
keep it close to the center
line.

TSD: What were your goals
for the team in the fall sea
son, given the NCAA Cham
pionships are more than six
months away? What do you
look for as a coach during
this period?

CR: What comes out of the
more tournaments you play
and the trips you make is you
start to realize the certain
roles guys have on the team.
I think that's an important
thing. Each guy is preparing
to win the golf tournament,
but as a coach you're think
ing: "Who are the five I can
put out there that give us the
best chance to win?" So
that's what helpful for me. I
also think momentum is key.
Obviously, winning momen
tum is a great thing, but
there's oftentimes when
we'll go play a tournament

and even though the result
may be a spot or two lower
on the board, we'll feel pret
ty good about what hap
pened. Maybe we played a
great final round or we over
came something. Looking at
the team from the 10,000-
foot level and saying, "Okay,
what group can we put out
there that creates the best
momentum and gives us the
best vibes when we're on the
road?"

TSD: Your squad is a mix of
experience and youth. Let's
turn first to the veterans
Cam Wilson and Patrick
Rodgers. What did you think
of their play this fall, and
how have they stepped into
bigger leadership roles?

CR: It's fun to see that
every year. Guys step up and
become leaders, and they
get in a position where
they're playing with confi
dence. They know the
courses oftentimes that
we're going to, they know
what to expect, how to lay
out their schedules for peak
performance. So both those
guys have done a great job
with that. Both of them
picked up an individual win,
so that's great momentum.
I would say with Cameron,
out of all of the guys, was
on top of his game the most.
That doesn't necessarily
mean he's shooting the best
scores —he and Patrick,
they're kind of hand in
hand there in terms of scor
ing. Rodgers made up for
maybe a little bit of a down
turn in his ball striking
with a great short game
and mental approach, some
great final rounds. I think
they're both in great posi
tion to be Ail-Americans and
lead us as we move through
this spring. It was neat to
see.

TSD: For these two especial
ly, the 2012-13 season cer
tainly did not end how they
wanted it to. How have you
seen the disappointing finish
to last year motivate Cam
and Patrick during the early
portion of this season?

CR: I think after something
like that that happens, the
one thing you can't ever do is
take things for granted. Not
to say we did last year, but I
think every year college golf
gets deeper. So I think now
our guys especially those
two leading us there is
more of a sense of urgency
maybe, and I think that's a
healthy thing. There's a lot
of intrinsic motivation with
this group, and I don't have
to bug them to practice a
whole lot. These guys work
hard; I think that's driven
by the older guys but also
by the younger guys.

TSD: You also played three
freshmen in your lineup this
fall. In what ways did you
see them grow during the
four tournaments, and do
you see them playing a big
role during the spring?

CR: I do. I think as much as
they played, all three of
them can play better, which
is great. I think as far as golf
experience goes, Viraat Bad
hwar and Jim Liu have
played as much golf, if not
more, than a lot of guys on
the team. They might be
freshmen in age, but espe
cially Jim and Viraat com
ing in as highly touted re
cruits — and Maverick Mc-
Nealy too, it's just that he
hadn't had the same expo
sure to national golf as those
other guys. I think those two
guys we're going to lean on
and expect big things from
this spring. It's good to have
some young guys who are
pushing. They know that one
day they'll maybe be in the
spot that Rodgers and Cam
are right now.
We pay a lot of attention
to our short games and scor
ing shots, and I think espe
cially Viraat and Maverick
saw that come out in their
scores. I think at the college
level, it's often not about hit
ting it better but scoring
more. And how do you do
that? Well, you chip and
putt, scramble better and
make your bad days better. I

saw big growth in both of
those guys' short games.
Jim Liu had a solid short
game to begin with, and he's
continued to work on that. I
think the other thing we
worked on is shot value. And
what I mean by that is con
trolling your trajectory, con
trolling your golf ball, leav
ing it in the right spot and
understanding how to use
those tools and take it to the
new course you're experi
encing. It's really just in
creasing odds of perform
ance, and that's what we fo
cused on.

TSD: Will your guys play
any tournaments this win
ter? How important is it for
them to stay sharp when
there are no NCAA events
during this period?

CR: I think it's a balance. I
think for some of the guys
that played a ton this fall
a guy like Patrick Rodgers
they came off of a very
busy summer. So for him,
maybe this time is spent bet
ter resting, recharging the
battery. He's testing some
new equipment and some
stuff that's going to benefit
him down the road. But for a
guy like Patrick Grimes, for
example, who kind of got a
couple events in there as our
fourth or fifth guy, he's go
ing to go play some local
events. He also signed up for
a big event down in Miami,
the South Beach Amateur
[and missed the cut].
Cameron Wilson has been
asked to join a U.S. contin
gent down to Australia with
Viraat Badhwar. They're go
ing to play in the Masters of
the Amateurs, which is a big
Australian amateur event.
Viraat is actually the defend
ing champion that was a
big one that he marked on
his resume before he got to
Stanford.

TSD: What has been the
point of emphasis so far dur
ing your team's offseason
work? Is there one overarch
ing theme you've been focus
ing on or is it very individual
specific?

CR: In an offseason, as guys
are digesting their tourna
ment information after the
fall, if every guy does their
part to get one percent bet
ter in every area of their

game and worry about their
own business, that's really
going to feed up to the team
experience. These guys real
ly do have a great team dy
namic, but that's motivating
them to go take care of their
own business and be the guy
that everyone can lean on
when they need to.
We take a very strong
statistical approach. We not
only track rounds at school,
but tournament rounds. So
within those rounds in that
data set, we have a very good
understanding of what each
guy needs to work on indi
vidually. So we give them
practice plans based on that.
It's funny, though, because
there are a lot of common
points. I mentioned earlier
that short game becomes an
undercurrent theme: If you
can have a short game as
team, you're going to do well.
So we stress that as a group,
but we also know that each
guy very specific, individual
things that he can work in to
his practice routines.

TSD: Is there anyone on
your team that we haven't
yet talked about that you be
lieve could play a pivotal role
in your team's success in the
coming months? How do you
feel about your team's depth
at this point?

CR: That's the beauty of the
group we have. It's hard to
predict that. You get a guy
like Dominick Francks, who
came in hitting the ball bet
ter than he has his whole life.
He qualified for our first
event. Then he hit some
roadblocks with his putting,
but he's started to shore that
up. He's a whale of a competi
tor and an athlete and a guy
who's had some experience,
so he's a guy that could bust
in there. And then you got
guys like Shane Lebow who's
a senior and hasn't played a
ton, but he's in that mode
where "Okay, my time at
Stanford is ending, it's wind
ing down." He's relaxed and
enjoying golf and enjoys be
ing around the team. So you
just never know, right? That's
the beauty of golf—it can
change on a dime, for sure.
I'm excited about [the
team's depth]. I think that's a
huge key to successful col
lege teams. You can have a lot
of depth, but you also need
one or two guys to break out

of their current trends. I
think if you look at the histo
ry of teams who are winning
at the end of the year, they
typically have one or two
guys that are doing some
thing different than they did
in the fall, overachieving. So
we're looking for who that's
going to be we don't know
yet.

TSD: The Pac-12 Conference
has been ultra-competitive in
men's golf in recent memory.
Do you expect much of the
same this spring? What are
the advantages and disad
vantages of playing in such a
stacked league?

CR: I think the league has
never been stronger. I like
our position in the league so
far. I think we're right near
No. 2 on the list, nipping at
Cal's heels a little bit. We're
pushing them. I think we'll
see a lot of those schools in
the spring, and that's how it
usually works. We stay more
west with our schedule, and
so it's a challenge. One of the
big goals we've talked about
is seeing if we pull in that
Pac-12 crown that's some
thing that's been a little bit
elusive for us, even in my ca
reer actually.

TSD: Now looking even past
the spring season, your pro
gram recently added three
signees for the class of 2018.
Talk about what Franklin,
Bradley and Jeffrey will
bring to the team in the com
ing years.

CR: They're going to bring a
bunch to the team. I think
they're all great student ath
letes, all really good guys.
They have very diverse back
grounds, which I think is
kind of neat. We have one lo
cal guy, one Midwestern guy
and one SoCal guy. They all
have won tournaments
they all have tremendous up
side in our estimation. They
don't bring with them a top
-10 ranking, but that's okay.
We like that, because we feel
like they'll play their way in
to that position. They're open
to joining a really good team
and having great weather,
great facilities at their dis
posal to see what can hap
pen.

In advance of the 201 j Stanford men's
golf season, The Daily's Cameron
Miller spoke with men's golf head coach
Conrad Ray to get perspective on
events since the end of last season. Be
low is the transcript of their conversa
tion.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Now that we're
a month removed from the team's fall sched
ule, what are your biggest takeaways from
the four tournaments your team played?
Conrad Ray (CR): I think we were all happy
with the fall. I think that at this point in the
year, we're in the position where we're work
ing on things landmines, roadblocks,
whatever you might say that are in our
way of being at our best in the spring. That's
what our fall schedule provided us: a great
data sample and getting a bunch of guys ex
perience. Eight out of our 10 players on the
team saw some action in tournament play.
We played some very good competition on
some difficult golf courses and in different
conditions than we might see everyday at
Stanford, so there's a ton of positives after
our fall campaign.
TSD: Was there a tournament or individual
performance that was of particular note to
you?

CR: I think tournament-wise, clearly our win

at Erin Hills was a neat experience. I felt like
our guys were on top of their game. We had a
good game plan that week, so to pick up a win
in that field very competitive, beating
UCLA, SMU and some good teams was a
positive.
On the individual side, finishes of note
would include Cameron Wilson picking up his
first individual win as a senior in one of the
staunchest fields we'll have all year at
Olympia Fields. That really was a spring
board for him all fall, and I felt like he played
with a lot of confidence. He did some great
things for our team.

they're playing with confi
dence. They know the
courses oftentimes that
we're going to, they know
what to expect, how to lay
out their schedules for peak
performance. So both those
guys have done a great job
with that. Both of them
picked up an individual win,
so that's great momentum.
I would say with Cameron,
out of all of the guys, was
on top of his game the most.
That doesn't necessarily
mean he's shooting the best
scores —he and Patrick,
they're kind of hand in
hand there in terms of scor
ing. Rodgers made up for
maybe a little bit of a down
turn in his ball striking
with a great short game
and mental approach, some
great final rounds. I think
they're both in great posi
tion to be Ail-Americans and
lead us as we move through
this spring. It was neat to
see.

TSD: For these two especial
ly, the 2012-13 season cer
tainly did not end how they
wanted it to. How have you
seen the disappointing finish
to last year motivate Cam
and Patrick during the early
portion of this season?

CR: I think after something
like that that happens, the
one thing you can't ever do is
take things for granted. Not
to say we did last year, but I
think every year college golf
gets deeper. So I think now
our guys especially those
two leading us there is
more of a sense of urgency
maybe, and I think that's a
healthy thing. There's a lot
of intrinsic motivation with
this group, and I don't have
to bug them to practice a
whole lot. These guys work
hard; I think that's driven
by the older guys but also
by the younger guys.

TSD: You also played three
freshmen in your lineup this
fall. In what ways did you
see them grow during the
four tournaments, and do
you see them playing a big
role during the spring?

CR: I do. I think as much as
they played, all three of
them can play better, which
is great. I think as far as golf
experience goes, Viraat Bad
hwar and Jim Liu have
played as much golf, if not
more, than a lot of guys on
the team. They might be
freshmen in age, but espe
cially Jim and Viraat com
ing in as highly touted re
cruits — and Maverick Mc-
Nealy too, it's just that he
hadn't had the same expo
sure to national golf as those
other guys. I think those two
guys we're going to lean on
and expect big things from
this spring. It's good to have
some young guys who are
pushing. They know that one
day they'll maybe be in the
spot that Rodgers and Cam
are right now.
We pay a lot of attention
to our short games and scor
ing shots, and I think espe
cially Viraat and Maverick
saw that come out in their
scores. I think at the college
level, it's often not about hit
ting it better but scoring
more. And how do you do
that? Well, you chip and
putt, scramble better and
make your bad days better. I

saw big growth in both of
those guys' short games.
Jim Liu had a solid short
game to begin with, and he's
continued to work on that. I
think the other thing we
worked on is shot value. And
what I mean by that is con
trolling your trajectory, con
trolling your golf ball, leav
ing it in the right spot and
understanding how to use
those tools and take it to the
new course you're experi
encing. It's really just in
creasing odds of perform
ance, and that's what we fo
cused on.

TSD: Will your guys play
any tournaments this win
ter? How important is it for
them to stay sharp when
there are no NCAA events
during this period?

CR: I think it's a balance. I
think for some of the guys
that played a ton this fall
a guy like Patrick Rodgers
they came off of a very
busy summer. So for him,
maybe this time is spent bet
ter resting, recharging the
battery. He's testing some
new equipment and some
stuff that's going to benefit
him down the road. But for a
guy like Patrick Grimes, for
example, who kind of got a
couple events in there as our
fourth or fifth guy, he's go
ing to go play some local
events. He also signed up for
a big event down in Miami,
the South Beach Amateur
[and missed the cut].
Cameron Wilson has been
asked to join a U.S. contin
gent down to Australia with
Viraat Badhwar. They're go
ing to play in the Masters of
the Amateurs, which is a big
Australian amateur event.
Viraat is actually the defend
ing champion that was a
big one that he marked on
his resume before he got to
Stanford.

TSD: What has been the
point of emphasis so far dur
ing your team's offseason
work? Is there one overarch
ing theme you've been focus
ing on or is it very individual
specific?

CR: In an offseason, as guys
are digesting their tourna
ment information after the
fall, if every guy does their
part to get one percent bet
ter in every area of their

game and worry about their
own business, that's really
going to feed up to the team
experience. These guys real
ly do have a great team dy
namic, but that's motivating
them to go take care of their
own business and be the guy
that everyone can lean on
when they need to.
We take a very strong
statistical approach. We not
only track rounds at school,
but tournament rounds. So
within those rounds in that
data set, we have a very good
understanding of what each
guy needs to work on indi
vidually. So we give them
practice plans based on that.
It's funny, though, because
there are a lot of common
points. I mentioned earlier
that short game becomes an
undercurrent theme: If you
can have a short game as
team, you're going to do well.
So we stress that as a group,
but we also know that each
guy very specific, individual
things that he can work in to
his practice routines.

TSD: Is there anyone on
your team that we haven't
yet talked about that you be
lieve could play a pivotal role
in your team's success in the
coming months? How do you
feel about your team's depth
at this point?

CR: That's the beauty of the
group we have. It's hard to
predict that. You get a guy
like Dominick Francks, who
came in hitting the ball bet
ter than he has his whole life.
He qualified for our first
event. Then he hit some
roadblocks with his putting,
but he's started to shore that
up. He's a whale of a competi
tor and an athlete and a guy
who's had some experience,
so he's a guy that could bust
in there. And then you got
guys like Shane Lebow who's
a senior and hasn't played a
ton, but he's in that mode
where "Okay, my time at
Stanford is ending, it's wind
ing down." He's relaxed and
enjoying golf and enjoys be
ing around the team. So you
just never know, right? That's
the beauty of golf—it can
change on a dime, for sure.
I'm excited about [the
team's depth]. I think that's a
huge key to successful col
lege teams. You can have a lot
of depth, but you also need
one or two guys to break out

of their current trends. I
think if you look at the histo
ry of teams who are winning
at the end of the year, they
typically have one or two
guys that are doing some
thing different than they did
in the fall, overachieving. So
we're looking for who that's
going to be we don't know
yet.

TSD: The Pac-12 Conference
has been ultra-competitive in
men's golf in recent memory.
Do you expect much of the
same this spring? What are
the advantages and disad
vantages of playing in such a
stacked league?

CR: I think the league has
never been stronger. I like
our position in the league so
far. I think we're right near
No. 2 on the list, nipping at
Cal's heels a little bit. We're
pushing them. I think we'll
see a lot of those schools in
the spring, and that's how it
usually works. We stay more
west with our schedule, and
so it's a challenge. One of the
big goals we've talked about
is seeing if we pull in that
Pac-12 crown that's some
thing that's been a little bit
elusive for us, even in my ca
reer actually.

TSD: Now looking even past
the spring season, your pro
gram recently added three
signees for the class of 2018.
Talk about what Franklin,
Bradley and Jeffrey will
bring to the team in the com
ing years.

CR: They're going to bring a
bunch to the team. I think
they're all great student ath
letes, all really good guys.
They have very diverse back
grounds, which I think is
kind of neat. We have one lo
cal guy, one Midwestern guy
and one SoCal guy. They all
have won tournaments
they all have tremendous up
side in our estimation. They
don't bring with them a top
-10 ranking, but that's okay.
We like that, because we feel
like they'll play their way in
to that position. They're open
to joining a really good team
and having great weather,
great facilities at their dis
posal to see what can hap
pen.

In advance of the 201 j Stanford men's
golf season, The Daily's Cameron
Miller spoke with men's golf head coach
Conrad Ray to get perspective on
events since the end of last season. Be
low is the transcript of their conversa
tion.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Now that we're
a month removed from the team's fall sched
ule, what are your biggest takeaways from
the four tournaments your team played?
Conrad Ray (CR): I think we were all happy
with the fall. I think that at this point in the
year, we're in the position where we're work
ing on things landmines, roadblocks,
whatever you might say that are in our
way of being at our best in the spring. That's
what our fall schedule provided us: a great
data sample and getting a bunch of guys ex
perience. Eight out of our 10 players on the
team saw some action in tournament play.
We played some very good competition on
some difficult golf courses and in different
conditions than we might see everyday at
Stanford, so there's a ton of positives after
our fall campaign.
TSD: Was there a tournament or individual
performance that was of particular note to
you?

CR: I think tournament-wise, clearly our win

at Erin Hills was a neat experience. I felt like
our guys were on top of their game. We had a
good game plan that week, so to pick up a win
in that field very competitive, beating
UCLA, SMU and some good teams was a
positive.
On the individual side, finishes of note
would include Cameron Wilson picking up his
first individual win as a senior in one of the
staunchest fields we'll have all year at
Olympia Fields. That really was a spring
board for him all fall, and I felt like he played
with a lot of confidence. He did some great
things for our team.

Conrad Ray '97 is in his 10th year as the
head coach of Stanford's men's golf program.
This spring's squad promises to be
one the strongest in Cardinal history.
TSD: It seems like the
team's big win at Erin Hills
was the signature event of
the fall. What are the big
lessons the team can take
from that tournament
specifically?

CR: Our team, the group
that we've put together
including the younger guys
coming up behind —we
rarely lack in offense. Our
problems often lie in de
fense. What I mean by that
is the bigger numbers. We
did a good job that week, mi
nus a weird bobble from Jim
Liu on the last day, from
keeping our ball out of trou
ble, eliminating the double
bogeys and using our short
games and scoring ability to
keep it close to the center
line.

TSD: What were your goals
for the team in the fall sea
son, given the NCAA Cham
pionships are more than six
months away? What do you
look for as a coach during
this period?

CR: What comes out of the
more tournaments you play
and the trips you make is you
start to realize the certain
roles guys have on the team.
I think that's an important
thing. Each guy is preparing
to win the golf tournament,
but as a coach you're think
ing: "Who are the five I can
put out there that give us the
best chance to win?" So
that's what helpful for me. I
also think momentum is key.
Obviously, winning momen
tum is a great thing, but
there's oftentimes when
we'll go play a tournament

and even though the result
may be a spot or two lower
on the board, we'll feel pret
ty good about what hap
pened. Maybe we played a
great final round or we over
came something. Looking at
the team from the 10,000-
foot level and saying, "Okay,
what group can we put out
there that creates the best
momentum and gives us the
best vibes when we're on the
road?"

TSD: Your squad is a mix of
experience and youth. Let's
turn first to the veterans
Cam Wilson and Patrick
Rodgers. What did you think
of their play this fall, and
how have they stepped into
bigger leadership roles?

CR: It's fun to see that
every year. Guys step up and
become leaders, and they
get in a position where
they're playing with confi
dence. They know the
courses oftentimes that
we're going to, they know
what to expect, how to lay
out their schedules for peak
performance. So both those
guys have done a great job
with that. Both of them
picked up an individual win,

hwar and Jim Liu have
played as much golf, if not
more, than a lot of guys on
the team. They might be
freshmen in age, but espe
cially Jim and Viraat com
ing in as highly touted re
cruits — and Maverick Mc-
Nealy too, it's just that he
hadn't had the same expo
sure to national golf as those
other guys. I think those two
guys we're going to lean on
and expect big things from
this spring. It's good to have
some young guys who are
pushing. They know that one
day they'll maybe be in the
spot that Rodgers and Cam
are right now.
We pay a lot of attention
to our short games and scor
ing shots, and I think espe
cially Viraat and Maverick
saw that come out in their
scores. I think at the college
level, it's often not about hit
ting it better but scoring
more. And how do you do
that? Well, you chip and
putt, scramble better and
make your bad days better. I

saw big growth in both of
those guys' short games.
Jim Liu had a solid short
game to begin with, and he's
continued to work on that. I
think the other thing we
worked on is shot value. And
what I mean by that is con
trolling your trajectory, con
trolling your golf ball, leav
ing it in the right spot and
understanding how to use
those tools and take it to the
new course you're experi
encing. It's really just in
creasing odds of perform
ance, and that's what we fo
cused on.

TSD: Will your guys play
any tournaments this win
ter? How important is it for
them to stay sharp when
there are no NCAA events
during this period?

CR: I think it's a balance. I
think for some of the guys
that played a ton this fall
a guy like Patrick Rodgers
they came off of a very
busy summer. So for him,
maybe this time is spent bet
ter resting, recharging the
battery. He's testing some
new equipment and some
stuff that's going to benefit
him down the road. But for a
guy like Patrick Grimes, for
example, who kind of got a
couple events in there as our
fourth or fifth guy, he's go
ing to go play some local
events. He also signed up for
a big event down in Miami,
the South Beach Amateur
[and missed the cut].
Cameron Wilson has been
asked to join a U.S. contin
gent down to Australia with
Viraat Badhwar. They're go
ing to play in the Masters of
the Amateurs, which is a big
Australian amateur event.
Viraat is actually the defend
ing champion that was a
big one that he marked on
his resume before he got to
Stanford.

TSD: What has been the
point of emphasis so far dur
ing your team's offseason
work? Is there one overarch
ing theme you've been focus
ing on or is it very individual
specific?

CR: In an offseason, as guys
are digesting their tourna
ment information after the
fall, if every guy does their
part to get one percent bet
ter in every area of their

game and worry about their
own business, that's really
going to feed up to the team
experience. These guys real
ly do have a great team dy
namic, but that's motivating
them to go take care of their
own business and be the guy
that everyone can lean on
when they need to.
We take a very strong
statistical approach. We not
only track rounds at school,
but tournament rounds. So
within those rounds in that
data set, we have a very good
understanding of what each
guy needs to work on indi
vidually. So we give them
practice plans based on that.
It's funny, though, because
there are a lot of common
points. I mentioned earlier
that short game becomes an
undercurrent theme: If you
can have a short game as
team, you're going to do well.
So we stress that as a group,
but we also know that each
guy very specific, individual
things that he can work in to
his practice routines.

TSD: Is there anyone on
your team that we haven't
yet talked about that you be
lieve could play a pivotal role
in your team's success in the
coming months? How do you
feel about your team's depth
at this point?

CR: That's the beauty of the
group we have. It's hard to
predict that. You get a guy
like Dominick Francks, who
came in hitting the ball bet
ter than he has his whole life.
He qualified for our first
event. Then he hit some
roadblocks with his putting,
but he's started to shore that
up. He's a whale of a competi
tor and an athlete and a guy
who's had some experience,
so he's a guy that could bust
in there. And then you got
guys like Shane Lebow who's
a senior and hasn't played a
ton, but he's in that mode
where "Okay, my time at
Stanford is ending, it's wind
ing down." He's relaxed and
enjoying golf and enjoys be
ing around the team. So you
just never know, right? That's
the beauty of golf—it can
change on a dime, for sure.
I'm excited about [the
team's depth]. I think that's a
huge key to successful col
lege teams. You can have a lot
of depth, but you also need
one or two guys to break out

of their current trends. I
think if you look at the histo
ry of teams who are winning
at the end of the year, they
typically have one or two
guys that are doing some
thing different than they did
in the fall, overachieving. So
we're looking for who that's
going to be we don't know
yet.

TSD: The Pac-12 Conference
has been ultra-competitive in
men's golf in recent memory.
Do you expect much of the
same this spring? What are
the advantages and disad
vantages of playing in such a
stacked league?

CR: I think the league has
never been stronger. I like
our position in the league so
far. I think we're right near
No. 2 on the list, nipping at
Cal's heels a little bit. We're
pushing them. I think we'll
see a lot of those schools in
the spring, and that's how it
usually works. We stay more
west with our schedule, and
so it's a challenge. One of the
big goals we've talked about
is seeing if we pull in that
Pac-12 crown that's some
thing that's been a little bit
elusive for us, even in my ca
reer actually.

TSD: Now looking even past
the spring season, your pro
gram recently added three
signees for the class of 2018.
Talk about what Franklin,
Bradley and Jeffrey will
bring to the team in the com
ing years.

CR: They're going to bring a
bunch to the team. I think
they're all great student ath
letes, all really good guys.
They have very diverse back
grounds, which I think is
kind of neat. We have one lo
cal guy, one Midwestern guy
and one SoCal guy. They all
have won tournaments
they all have tremendous up
side in our estimation. They
don't bring with them a top
-10 ranking, but that's okay.
We like that, because we feel
like they'll play their way in
to that position. They're open
to joining a really good team
and having great weather,
great facilities at their dis
posal to see what can hap
pen.

In advance of the 201 j Stanford men's
golf season, The Daily's Cameron
Miller spoke with men's golf head coach
Conrad Ray to get perspective on
events since the end of last season. Be
low is the transcript of their conversa
tion.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Now that we're
a month removed from the team's fall sched
ule, what are your biggest takeaways from
the four tournaments your team played?
Conrad Ray (CR): I think we were all happy
with the fall. I think that at this point in the
year, we're in the position where we're work
ing on things landmines, roadblocks,
whatever you might say that are in our
way of being at our best in the spring. That's
what our fall schedule provided us: a great
data sample and getting a bunch of guys ex
perience. Eight out of our 10 players on the
team saw some action in tournament play.
We played some very good competition on
some difficult golf courses and in different
conditions than we might see everyday at
Stanford, so there's a ton of positives after
our fall campaign.
TSD: Was there a tournament or individual
performance that was of particular note to
you?

CR: I think tournament-wise, clearly our win

at Erin Hills was a neat experience. I felt like
our guys were on top of their game. We had a
good game plan that week, so to pick up a win
in that field very competitive, beating
UCLA, SMU and some good teams was a
positive.
On the individual side, finishes of note
would include Cameron Wilson picking up his
first individual win as a senior in one of the
staunchest fields we'll have all year at
Olympia Fields. That really was a spring
board for him all fall, and I felt like he played
with a lot of confidence. He did some great
things for our team.

Conrad Ray '97 is in his 10th year as the
head coach of Stanford's men's golf program.
This spring's squad promises to be
one the strongest in Cardinal history.
TSD: It seems like the
team's big win at Erin Hills
was the signature event of
the fall. What are the big
lessons the team can take
from that tournament
specifically?

CR: Our team, the group
that we've put together
including the younger guys
coming up behind —we
rarely lack in offense. Our
problems often lie in de
fense. What I mean by that
is the bigger numbers. We
did a good job that week, mi
nus a weird bobble from Jim
Liu on the last day, from
keeping our ball out of trou
ble, eliminating the double
bogeys and using our short
games and scoring ability to
keep it close to the center
line.

TSD: What were your goals
for the team in the fall sea
son, given the NCAA Cham
pionships are more than six
months away? What do you
look for as a coach during
this period?

CR: What comes out of the
more tournaments you play
and the trips you make is you
start to realize the certain
roles guys have on the team.
I think that's an important
thing. Each guy is preparing
to win the golf tournament,
but as a coach you're think
ing: "Who are the five I can
put out there that give us the
best chance to win?" So
that's what helpful for me. I
also think momentum is key.
Obviously, winning momen
tum is a great thing, but
there's oftentimes when
we'll go play a tournament

and even though the result
may be a spot or two lower
on the board, we'll feel pret
ty good about what hap
pened. Maybe we played a
great final round or we over
came something. Looking at
the team from the 10,000-
foot level and saying, "Okay,
what group can we put out
there that creates the best
momentum and gives us the
best vibes when we're on the
road?"

TSD: Your squad is a mix of
experience and youth. Let's
turn first to the veterans
Cam Wilson and Patrick
Rodgers. What did you think
of their play this fall, and
how have they stepped into
bigger leadership roles?

CR: It's fun to see that
every year. Guys step up and
become leaders, and they
get in a position where
they're playing with confi
dence. They know the
courses oftentimes that
we're going to, they know
what to expect, how to lay
out their schedules for peak
performance. So both those
guys have done a great job
with that. Both of them
picked up an individual win,
so that's great momentum.
I would say with Cameron,
out of all of the guys, was
on top of his game the most.
That doesn't necessarily
mean he's shooting the best
scores —he and Patrick,
they're kind of hand in
hand there in terms of scor
ing. Rodgers made up for
maybe a little bit of a down
turn in his ball striking
with a great short game
and mental approach, some
great final rounds. I think
they're both in great posi
tion to be Ail-Americans and
lead us as we move through
this spring. It was neat to
see.

TSD: For these two especial
ly, the 2012-13 season cer
tainly did not end how they
wanted it to. How have you
seen the disappointing finish
to last year motivate Cam
and Patrick during the early
portion of this season?

CR: I think after something
like that that happens, the
one thing you can't ever do is
take things for granted. Not
to say we did last year, but I
think every year college golf
gets deeper. So I think now
our guys especially those
two leading us there is
more of a sense of urgency
maybe, and I think that's a
healthy thing. There's a lot
of intrinsic motivation with
this group, and I don't have
to bug them to practice a
whole lot. These guys work
hard; I think that's driven
by the older guys but also
by the younger guys.

TSD: You also played three
freshmen in your lineup this
fall. In what ways did you
see them grow during the
four tournaments, and do
you see them playing a big
role during the spring?

CR: I do. I think as much as
they played, all three of
them can play better, which
is great. I think as far as golf
experience goes, Viraat Bad
hwar and Jim Liu have
played as much golf, if not
more, than a lot of guys on
the team. They might be
freshmen in age, but espe
cially Jim and Viraat com
ing in as highly touted re
cruits — and Maverick Mc-
Nealy too, it's just that he
hadn't had the same expo
