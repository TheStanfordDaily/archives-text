## Conrad Ray discusses last fall, outlook 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
In advance of the 201 j Stanford men's
golf season, The Daily's Cameron
Miller spoke with men's golf head coach
Conrad Ray to get perspective on
events since the end of last season. Be
low is the transcript of their conversa
tion.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Now that we're
a month removed from the team's fall sched
ule, what are your biggest takeaways from
the four tournaments your team played?
Conrad Ray (CR): I think we were all happy
with the fall. I think that at this point in the
year, we're in the position where we're work
ing on things landmines, roadblocks,
whatever you might say that are in our
way of being at our best in the spring. That's
what our fall schedule provided us: a great
data sample and getting a bunch of guys ex
perience. Eight out of our 10 players on the
team saw some action in tournament play.
We played some very good competition on
some difficult golf courses and in different
conditions than we might see everyday at
Stanford, so there's a ton of positives after
our fall campaign.
TSD: Was there a tournament or individual
performance that was of particular note to
you?

CR: I think tournament-wise, clearly our win

at Erin Hills was a neat experience. I felt like
our guys were on top of their game. We had a
good game plan that week, so to pick up a win
in that field very competitive, beating
UCLA, SMU and some good teams was a
positive.
On the individual side, finishes of note
would include Cameron Wilson picking up his
first individual win as a senior in one of the
staunchest fields we'll have all year at
Olympia Fields. That really was a spring
board for him all fall, and I felt like he played
with a lot of confidence. He did some great
things for our team.
