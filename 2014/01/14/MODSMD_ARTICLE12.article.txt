## Modi springs Card past Cal in debut 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford men's gymnastics opened its sea
son in the best possible way for a Cardinal ath
letic team: beating Cal in Berkeley. The Cardi
nal, powered by the remarkable debut of fresh
man Akash Modi and five individual victories
in the six events, beat the Bears in their home
gym for the second consecutive season.

As a team, the Cardinal won five out of the
six events, but the meet did not start out aus
piciously. Cal slightly edged out Stanford in
the floor exercise to begin the afternoon,
72.300 to 72.000. Modi won the event in his
collegiate debut with a 16.350, a remarkable
.550 clear of second place, to keep Stanford in
striking distance.
Stanford took the lead for the first time on
the pommel horse behind the winning effort of
senior Chris Turner. Turner executed on a
high-difficulty routine to be the only gymnast
to break the 15-point mark on the pommel
horse, finishing with a 15.050.
The Cardinal and the Golden Bears traded
narrow wins over the next two events: the
rings and the vault. Sophomore Dennis Zarem-

ski picked up the individual
victory on the rings with a
score of 15.100, and Modi
led the Cardinal with a sec
ond-place 15.000 in the
vault.
Stanford pulled away for
good on the parallel bars,
dominating Cal by over a
full point, 71.300 to 70.200.
Modi again led the way for

Stanford, picking up his
third team-high score and
second individual victory of
the afternoon with a 15.250.
With a comfortable lead
already in hand, Stanford
didn't settle in the final
event: the high bar. The
Cardinal pummeled the
Bears by 2.300 points, led
by fifth-year senior Paul
Hichwa, who won the event
with a score of 15.000.
Only four gymnasts com
peted in every event of the
meet: Modi of Stanford and
three Cal gymnasts. Modi
had the highest score of the
four, finishing what will
surely be an unforgettable
collegiate debut with an all
around score of 88.150, just
clear of Cal's Donothan Bai
ley, who scored an 87.800.
Cal will have its chance
for revenge this Saturday,
when the Cardinal hosts the
Golden Bears at 4 p.m. Cal
will also return to the Farm
the following Saturday as
one of the four teams at the
Stanford Open.
