## Modi springs Card past Cal in debut 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford men's gymnastics opened its sea
son in the best possible way for a Cardinal ath
letic team: beating Cal in Berkeley. The Cardi
nal, powered by the remarkable debut of fresh
man Akash Modi and five individual victories
in the six events, beat the Bears in their home
gym for the second consecutive season.

As a team, the Cardinal won five out of the
six events, but the meet did not start out aus
piciously. Cal slightly edged out Stanford in
the floor exercise to begin the afternoon,
72.300 to 72.000. Modi won the event in his
collegiate debut with a 16.350, a remarkable
.550 clear of second place, to keep Stanford in
striking distance.
Stanford took the lead for the first time on
the pommel horse behind the winning effort of
senior Chris Turner. Turner executed on a
high-difficulty routine to be the only gymnast
to break the 15-point mark on the pommel
horse, finishing with a 15.050.
The Cardinal and the Golden Bears traded
narrow wins over the next two events: the
rings and the vault. Sophomore Dennis Zarem-
