## OP-ED Superfish in a Pond: A Freshman Perspective 
### 
It's no secret that students here
at Stanford have insecurities
about their competence. From
Admit Weekend to Orientation,
they've told us at every turn: "You
deserve to be here. You're good
enough. You weren't admitted by
mistake."
Yet I continue to hear classmates,
friends and people in my dorm say
(often in these exact words): "I
don't deserve to be here. I'm not
good enough. I feel like I was ad
mitted by mistake." It reminds me
of the way models are said to feel
insecure about their bodies.
One would think that we of all
people, students at Stanford
University, would realize our val
ue. Why don't we? It boils down to
one thing: what Stanford's own
Carol Dweck, professor of psychol
ogy, calls "fixed mindset"; in simple
terms, the idea that our abilities
are set, especially in relation to
those around us. Before Stanford,
we were all big fish relative to our
peers. Now, here, we're smaller
fish, too small or so many of us
feel to swim in the Stanford
pond.
Fixed mindset sneaks into our
lives and nearly incapacitates us. It
doesn't completely preclude us
from hard work no one would
dispute that Stanford students are
among the hardest workers of all.
But it keeps us succeeding only
in those areas we feel safe in (why
do I pretend to be a ditz at math in
front of my Ã¼ber-achieving friends
when I shone at it before?), and it
turns every midterm into dooms
day. If we're working our butts off
and still not achieving to the level
of our peers, what does that say
about us?
The thing is, hard work doesn't
cut it when we don't believe in our
selves in the first place. If we're
undermining ourselves at every
turn, consciously or subconscious
ly, no amount of effort will be
enough.
No, what a mind really needs to
succeed at something is that
spark, that click, that "I get it!"
That feeling you get when you've
realized how to become good at
something. You know what I'm
talking about. We've all felt it
that spark of understanding, ex
citement, fascination with the
beauty of a subject or the art of ex
celling at it. It's that thing we lost
about two weeks after we got here.
What we need to realize is that
we can still feel that spark with
out being the best. It's there, lurk
ing just beneath the surface of our
fears and self doubts and self im
pairments. Each and every one of
us has the ability to reach for it.
And what's more, it's not a matter
of simply choosing what is easiest
or most natural. We can each find
our spark in whatever area we
choose.
To regain our spark, we need
only regain our confidence. Sound
hard? Did you shy away as things
got more difficult in high school? If
so, you wouldn't be here!
College is when fixed mindset
really hits hard. It's this sense that
we're "stuck" here, wherever we

are, at B's in science, "bad at writ
ing," "techie," "fuzzy," cut out for
one thing, not cut out for another.
Many of us felt we were "stuck" at
the top in high school, and now we
feel like we're stuck at subpar... as
smaller fish in a pond of giants.
But in reality, we're no normal
fish. We're superfish, with infinite
growing capacity. Who cares if
there's a bigger fish right now?
That other fish is irrelevant. What
matters is our own personal
amount of growth, and the beauty
and excitement of the process of
growing.
What's more: as the fish in the
pond grow, the super pond, grows
as well. That's right. Our pond,
Stanford, gets bigger the
school itself improves and achieves
more as it expands to accommo
date us. And as our growth leads us
to extend our reach, achievement
and impact, the world itself gets
bigger.
Improvement, forward progress
this is the result of what happens
when we truly dedicate ourselves to
the art of developing ourselves and
pushing ourselves to the wait
limits? There aren't any! Isn't that
exciting?
We're at Stanford. Not only do
we have a responsibility to our
selves to explore our potential, we
have a responsibility to the world.
Get out there. Get your growth
mindset on. Start changing your
self, start changing the world.
We're in the place with possibly the
most opportunities on Earth.
Wouldn't it be sad if we passed
them by simply because couldn't
get past our own insecurities?
Stanford recognized your poten
tial; will you?
