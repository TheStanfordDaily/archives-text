# SUPER TUESDAY
## Reclaiming the Primary 
### Nick Ahamed 
They explain why Mitt Romney was labeled
a flip flopper in the 2012 election. They ex
plain why our politics have swung so dra
matically to the extremes of the political spec
trum. And they may well predict whether the
Democrats control the White House again after
2016.
They, primaries and caucuses, are the process by
which political parties nominate candidates for
office.
Yet the terms "primary" and "caucus" are on
ly important to three groups of people: (1) hope
ful candidates such as Mitt Romney, (2) political
junkies like this writer and (3) high school stu
dents studying for a civics exam as you once did.
While these may seem like three disparate
groups, their relationships or lack thereof —
have a profound impact on this country.
The vast majority of the country loses inter
est after their high school exams, allowing those
like me to control the process. For Republicans,
this has meant that nomination seekers must
cater to the Tea Party.
While Mitt Romney was campaigning for the
nomination, he faced seven serious contenders in
20 official debates. This, in addition to the mil
lions of dollars spent against him by his own par

ty, made him unable to sway enough voters to his
camp later on in the actual presidential race.
Right now, it seems, winning the nomination and
the general election are mutually exclusive for
Republican presidential candidates a prob
lematic situation for a healthy democracy.
Thankfully, GOP leadership has recognized
their dilemma and has established a plan to fix it,
according to CNN. First, there will be fewer of
ficial debates and participation in outside "fo
rums" will be deterred. Second, the RNC will
enact penalties against states that move their
primaries earlier. Third, primaries that take
place around Super Tuesday will now award
their delegates proportionally; avoiding a win
ner-take-all system means that consistently
strong candidates won't face as significant chal
lenges from challengers who sputter out after
winning one state.
If passed by the RNC Rules Committee, this
plan will make it more difficult for extreme view
points to leverage their way onto the main stage
of national debate. Those most in line with
states' Republicans will get the nod.
Right now, that person is Chris Christie, who
leads national polls by 6.2 percentage points, ac
cording to Real Clear Politics. State GOP lead

ers say that his recent controversy is unlikely to
affect voters. Nevertheless, Rand Paul, Ted
Cruz and Marco Rubio are not far behind.
While it's an admirable plan, there is a better
way to reform primaries to encourage more
moderate candidates: the jungle primary.
The jungle primary, more formally called the
nonpartisan blanket primary, removes parties
from the primary process. Rather than advanc
ing one Republican and one Democrat (in addi
tion to a slew of third parties), this system allows
the top two vote-getting candidates to advance,
regardless of party.
In more liberal California, where this system
was instituted after the 2010 election, Democ
rats are likely to earn those spots. Take, for ex
ample, the 15th Congressional District, just east
of Stanford.
In 2012, two Democrats faced off in the pri
mary: incumbent Pete Stark and Eric Swalwell.
Stark beat Swalwell by 6.1 percentage points in
the primary while Swalwell defeated the third
contender by 14.3 points. In the general election,
Swalwell won because his more moderate posi
tions appealed to Republicans, who had no one
from their party to support.
In the district just south of Stanford, CA-17,
incumbent Democrat Mike Honda is facing a
2014 challenge from another Democrat, Ro
Khanna.
California, Louisiana and Washington have
already enacted this system. Purple districts
would especially benefit from their states follow
ing suit. Interestingly, many districts fit this de
scription, as a map made by Mark Newman of
the University of Michigan demonstrates.

Even if national reform of the Republican
primary is likely to happen and will encourage
more moderate candidates, nonpartisan primar
ies would do many states and voters more good.
In the end, however, the real answer lies with
you and me.
While in Washington D.C., I met with a mod
erate member of Congress for class. I asked her
why there are not more moderates in Congress.
Her response were simple: Voters don't elect
them.
Though one is more far reaching, both of
these changes will enable centrists to have a
greater voice in elections. But, they will not just
hand out this leverage; moderates and independ
ents must be more active.
Young people especially have been disaffected
by the recent hyper-partisanship. Our retrench
ment from politics has not encouraged reform of
primaries. But the solution is not to remove our
selves further. Indeed, it is the opposite. If we
want change, we must make it ourselves.

In 2012, two Democrats faced off in the pri
mary: incumbent Pete Stark and Eric Swalwell.
Stark beat Swalwell by 6.1 percentage points in
the primary while Swalwell defeated the third
contender by 14.3 points. In the general election,
Swalwell won because his more moderate posi
tions appealed to Republicans, who had no one
from their party to support.
In the district just south of Stanford, CA-17,
incumbent Democrat Mike Honda is facing a
2014 challenge from another Democrat, Ro
Khanna.
California, Louisiana and Washington have
already enacted this system. Purple districts
would especially benefit from their states follow
ing suit. Interestingly, many districts fit this de
scription, as a map made by Mark Newman of
the University of Michigan demonstrates.

Even if national reform of the Republican
primary is likely to happen and will encourage
more moderate candidates, nonpartisan primar
ies would do many states and voters more good.
In the end, however, the real answer lies with
you and me.
While in Washington D.C., I met with a mod
erate member of Congress for class. I asked her
why there are not more moderates in Congress.
Her response were simple: Voters don't elect
them.
Though one is more far reaching, both of
these changes will enable centrists to have a
greater voice in elections. But, they will not just
hand out this leverage; moderates and independ
ents must be more active.
Young people especially have been disaffected
by the recent hyper-partisanship. Our retrench
ment from politics has not encouraged reform of
primaries. But the solution is not to remove our
selves further. Indeed, it is the opposite. If we
want change, we must make it ourselves.

They explain why Mitt Romney was labeled
a flip flopper in the 2012 election. They ex
plain why our politics have swung so dra
matically to the extremes of the political spec
trum. And they may well predict whether the
Democrats control the White House again after
2016.
They, primaries and caucuses, are the process by
which political parties nominate candidates for
office.
Yet the terms "primary" and "caucus" are on
ly important to three groups of people: (1) hope
ful candidates such as Mitt Romney, (2) political
junkies like this writer and (3) high school stu
dents studying for a civics exam as you once did.
While these may seem like three disparate
groups, their relationships or lack thereof —
have a profound impact on this country.
The vast majority of the country loses inter
est after their high school exams, allowing those
like me to control the process. For Republicans,
this has meant that nomination seekers must
cater to the Tea Party.
While Mitt Romney was campaigning for the
nomination, he faced seven serious contenders in
20 official debates. This, in addition to the mil
lions of dollars spent against him by his own par

ty, made him unable to sway enough voters to his
camp later on in the actual presidential race.
Right now, it seems, winning the nomination and
the general election are mutually exclusive for
Republican presidential candidates a prob
lematic situation for a healthy democracy.
Thankfully, GOP leadership has recognized
their dilemma and has established a plan to fix it,
according to CNN. First, there will be fewer of
ficial debates and participation in outside "fo
rums" will be deterred. Second, the RNC will
enact penalties against states that move their
primaries earlier. Third, primaries that take
place around Super Tuesday will now award
their delegates proportionally; avoiding a win
ner-take-all system means that consistently
strong candidates won't face as significant chal
lenges from challengers who sputter out after
winning one state.
If passed by the RNC Rules Committee, this
plan will make it more difficult for extreme view
points to leverage their way onto the main stage
of national debate. Those most in line with
states' Republicans will get the nod.
Right now, that person is Chris Christie, who
leads national polls by 6.2 percentage points, ac
cording to Real Clear Politics. State GOP lead

ers say that his recent controversy is unlikely to
affect voters. Nevertheless, Rand Paul, Ted
Cruz and Marco Rubio are not far behind.
While it's an admirable plan, there is a better
way to reform primaries to encourage more
moderate candidates: the jungle primary.
The jungle primary, more formally called the
nonpartisan blanket primary, removes parties
from the primary process. Rather than advanc
ing one Republican and one Democrat (in addi
tion to a slew of third parties), this system allows
the top two vote-getting candidates to advance,
regardless of party.
In more liberal California, where this system
was instituted after the 2010 election, Democ
rats are likely to earn those spots. Take, for ex
ample, the 15th Congressional District, just east
of Stanford.
