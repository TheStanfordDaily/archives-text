## KEITH HUMPHREYS PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES 
### VICTOR XU 
Reactions to the legalization and opening
of stores selling marijuana in Colorado this
month has been mixed, with supporters and
opponents arguing about the tax impact of
legalization, health concerns and meaning
for the national drug war.
Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychi
atry and behavioral sciences, is part of a
commission organized by Lieutenant Gover
nor Gavin Newsom and the American Civil
Liberties Union to study marijuana legaliza
tion in California. He has also served as a
member of the White House Commission on
Drug Free Communities and as senior poli
cy advisor at the White House Office of Na
tional Drug Control Policy under the Obama
administration.
The Daily spoke with Humphreys about
Colorado and Washington's laws allowing
for the commercial sale of marijuana and
their potential impacts and implications na
tionwide.

that decide to follow suit with commercial-

ization of marijuana?
KH: First off, there's differ
ent ways of setting up taxa
tion. So Colorado and Wash
ington don't do the same
thing. Colorado is a pretty
lightly taxed regime. They
exempt anyone who has a
medical card, and about a
fourth of users have a med
ical card, so they won't pay
any tax. And the tax in the
state is pretty low. They're
also allowing vertical inte
gration, in fact mandating
vertical integration... That
makes prices lower.
As prices drop, any taxes
based on a percentage of
price brings in less revenue.
Ad valorem prices you
know, 10 percent, 20 percent
versus an excise tax are
really dependent on price.
Most people think that mari
juana's price could drop very
dramatically under legaliza
tion, maybe as much as 90
percent. So if prices drop
that fast, the taxes will drop
right along with it because

they're based on the price of
the marijuana. That proba
bly means that a lot of the tax
revenue projections that
have been made are too opti
mistic.

TSD: Proponents say legal
ization will bring under
ground money into the for
mal economy through taxa
tion.
KH: Marijuana's a funny
market. A huge amount of it
is just ordinary people shar
ing, and there's really no
transaction, so part of it is
mythological.
But... there's got to be
several billion dollars going
to growers in the United
States and Canada but also
heavily into Mexico which
would not go there anymore,
at least, if the whole country
legalized. Even if that money
never ends up in the public
coffers, the fact that it isn't
going to be put toward trying
to destabilize the Mexican
state is a benefit.

TSD: What other potential
effects of marijuana legaliza
tion is the [commission] mon
itoring?
KH: One of the problems we

have with tobacco is when
you have a large industry
that sells an addictive prod
uct, they're often very good
at influencing the political
process and making the reg
ulatory structure weak. Will
that be reproduced? Will you
have, for example, a marijua
na industry and a tobacco in
dustry fighting side by side
to get rid of antismoking
laws?
The second thing is about
young people's views. The
human brain is the most plas
tic when people are adoles
cents, and I think with some
exceptions, most people...
would still not necessarily
want their own children to be
using the drug. So if the price
falls as much as is expected,
it seems likely that youth use
will go up... People will defi
nitely be watching for that,
and especially for very heavy
use, dependent use.
TSD: Do you see any public
health standpoint negatives?
KH: It depends how you con
sume it. As a general rule, in
haling hot gas full of chemi
cals is not good for us. So you
could have a rise in common
respiratory ailments, for ex

ample, or chronic illness of
the nasal passages... there
are lots of things being devel
oped, though: Yape-Pens, fil
tering devices, vaporizers.
They help reduce that risk.
Another thing that is hap
pening with the reduced en
forcement are these very
high butane ash oil products
where you can zing up the
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
... We could get incredible
ramping up in the levels of
THC. What happens to peo
ple who consume that high a
level of THC? Nobody
knows. Marijuana 20 years
ago was four-, five-, six-per
cent THC and now it's 11-12
percent. If, under legaliza
tion, it goes up to 18-, 20- [or]
25-percent, then we've got a
new experiment that we may
be sorry [about] the effects
of in terms of people using
more and more potent drugs
... as far as I know, neither
regime [in Colorado or Wash
ington] keeps a cap on the
amount of THC.
TSD: Are states going about
legalization too hastily?
KH: There are a number of
groups and states including
California, Oregon and Alas

ka who right now are trying
to get something on the 2014
ballot. I think that's a mis
take ... even if you decide as a
result, that okay, you want to
do this, you might learn a
better way to do it because of
something [other states] did
that they sorely regret.

In a former bus barn near Denver, marijuana plants live their lives on camera, part of intense seed-to-sale scrutiny that
distinguishes Colorado's medical-marijuana industry. Washington is looking to Colorado as it considers rules for a new
legal marijuana market.
