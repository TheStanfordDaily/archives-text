# Steele leaves GSE for Berkeley
## Education dean named new UC-Berkeley provost 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
Claude Steele, dean of the
Graduate School of Education
(GSE) and professor emeritus of
psychology, was named the next
executive vice chancellor and
provost of UC-Berkeley on Mon
day.
Steele is expected to move
across the Bay on March 31 while
Deborah Stipek, professor of ed
ucation, will return to her posi
tion as dean of the education
school for 18 months starting
April 1. Stipek served as dean of
the School of Education from
2001 to 2011. A search for a per
manent director will begin in the
coming academic year.
To facilitate the transition
process and assist Stipek, the
newly created position of deputy
dean will be filled by Eamonn

Callan, professor of education.
As a researcher, Steele is per
haps best known for his work on
stereotype threat, an experience
in which people face anxiety
about behaviors that support
stereotypes about social or racial
groups.
"I think their gain is our loss,"
Stipek said of Steele's departure.
The opportunity to work at a
large-scale public institution with
a mission of broad access and si
multaneous excellence is what
Steele found appealing in the
Berkeley position. There, Steele
will be overseeing academic pro
grams, daily operations and the
school's budget. It is a familiar
role for Steele, who served as Co
lumbia University's provost from
2009 to 2011.
When speaking of his goals for
the new role, Steele recognized
that Berkeley has suffered cut

backs that impede the school's
ability to fulfill its public respon
sibility.
"I think the overriding chal
lenge at Berkeley is to improve
its financial stability... for the
years ahead," Steele said.
He added that public institu
tions like Berkeley are increas
ingly in need of support from
alumni and individuals interested
in the future of higher education.
"The whole process of devel
opment, that kind of revenue
needs to play a much bigger role
in Berkeley going forward,"
Steele said.
In addition to funding con
cerns, Steele said he plans to
make progress in diversifying
both the student body and the
faculty at Berkeley.

Leaving home
Although Steele is looking for

ward to playing a major role in
shaping the future of the school
across the Bay, he admitted that
the hardest part of accepting the
position is leaving Stanford a
place he's called home for over 20
years.
Steele joined the Stanford fac
ulty in the Department of Psy
chology in 1991. Here, he served
as chair of the Psychology De
partment, director of the Center
for Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity and director of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Science.
When recalling his accom
plishments, it is his research with
graduate students that Steele
said takes the number-one spot.

Steele anticipates that, as Berkeley vice chancellor and provost, he will focus on financial development and student body diversity.
role as dean of the GSE in
April, she said she expects
no dramatic changes from
the direction set out by
Steele. According to Steele,
this includes a focus on the
role of technology in educa
tion and work that expands
the nation's capacity to edu
cate low-income students.
"I think the transition
will be seamless because I
have been in the job, I have
relationships with many of
the people who are in the
larger GSE family and
Claude and I are like-mind
ed on what's so important
for a Graduate School of Ed
ucation," Stipek said.
