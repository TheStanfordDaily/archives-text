## Pre-meds unfazed by new MCAT social science section 
### IRENE HSU 
Because of the new Medical College Ad
mission Test (MCAT) coming out in 2015, the
University is recommending pre-medical stu
dents planning to start medical school in or
after Fall 2016 to gear their course selection
towards the MCAT's new focus on biochem
istry and the social determinants of health.
Despite these changes, neither advisors
nor students seem to be worried about the
test's restructuring.
The MCAT was rewritten in November
2011 after an Association of American Med
ical Colleges (AAMC)-appointed committee
re-evaluated how well the MCAT reflected
the skills needed in the medical field. For in
stance, the Institute of Medicine report, "Im
proving Medical Education: Enhance the Be
havioral and Social Science Content of Med
ical School Curricula," states that about half
of all deaths in the United States are "linked
to behavioral and social factors.
The MCAT2OIS, then, offers a new sec
tion on social and behavioral science. It also
encompasses changes to the natural sciences
section, such as an emphasis on biochemistry
and a "critical analysis and reasoning skills"
section that includes reading on various hu
manities topics.
"Ultimately, medical schools are looking
for doctors who can think how data is ana
lyzed, collected and applied," said Elizabeth
Hadly, senior associate vice provost for un
dergraduate education.
The current requirements for pre-meds
at Stanford include general chemistry, organ
ic chemistry, biology physics, English and
math. With the new MCAT, students will be
