## Pre-meds unfazed by new MCAT social science section 
### IRENE HSU 
Because of the new Medical College Ad
mission Test (MCAT) coming out in 2015, the
University is recommending pre-medical stu
dents planning to start medical school in or
after Fall 2016 to gear their course selection
towards the MCAT's new focus on biochem
istry and the social determinants of health.
Despite these changes, neither advisors
nor students seem to be worried about the
test's restructuring.
The MCAT was rewritten in November
2011 after an Association of American Med
ical Colleges (AAMC)-appointed committee
re-evaluated how well the MCAT reflected
the skills needed in the medical field. For in
stance, the Institute of Medicine report, "Im
proving Medical Education: Enhance the Be
havioral and Social Science Content of Med
ical School Curricula," states that about half
of all deaths in the United States are "linked
to behavioral and social factors.
The MCAT2OIS, then, offers a new sec
tion on social and behavioral science. It also
encompasses changes to the natural sciences
section, such as an emphasis on biochemistry
and a "critical analysis and reasoning skills"
section that includes reading on various hu
manities topics.
"Ultimately, medical schools are looking
for doctors who can think how data is ana
lyzed, collected and applied," said Elizabeth
Hadly, senior associate vice provost for un
dergraduate education.
The current requirements for pre-meds
at Stanford include general chemistry, organ
ic chemistry, biology physics, English and
math. With the new MCAT, students will be

advised to take more courses
in biochemistry as well as an
additional social science class
of their interest.
"We're still asking stu
dents to take the same
coursework as now," said Pa
tricia Lewis, a pre-med advi
sor. "For the social determi
nants of health, what we're
recommending is if you're
interested in that social sci
ence area, like psychology,
to take it. It won't hurt you
one bit."
Currently according to
Hadly, different departments
are discussing how to incor
porate the new MCAT re
quirements to help pre-med

students. These discussions
involve not just the classes
that are offered, but also the
timing of these courses and
consideration of students
who are not on the pre-med
track.
However, a practice ver
sion of the new MCAT won't
be released until April 2014,
so until that time, it is diffi
cult to have a firm concept of
what will be tested.
"We're still waiting for
the practice test and for
ideas to develop," said Lewis,
who encourages students to
come in and talk with pre
med advisors during the
transition from the old to the
new MCAT.
Though the new version
of the test will be implement
ed in a year, some pre-med
freshmen and sophomores
such as Jack Takahashi 'l7

are not too concerned about
the new requirements.
Takahashi first heard
about possible changes to the
MCAT a year ago. His first
reaction was negative be
cause the test, currently a lit
tle over four hours, will be
more than six hours given
the new sections and
changes.
"I thought, 'Well wow,
that's going to make it a lot
less fun to take,' as though it
were fun in the first place,"
he said. Besides the longer
test, however, the rest of the
MCAT2OIS does not concern
Takahashi, mainly because
he was planning to take it his
junior year anyway.
Amanda Somvilay 'l7, is
also unperturbed by the new
MCAT. She had planned to
take more psychology and
sociology courses to begin

with because of her interest
in psychiatry.
"SAT scores and CPAs
aren't everything," she said.
Somvilay sees the new social
and behavioral sciences re
quirements are away to
"shift away from numbers
and into people and their po
tential."
Similarly, the pre-med ad
visors aren't worried about
students who will be taking
the MCAT with the new for
mat.
"Our students will be
very well prepared," Lewis
said. "We have really strong
students, and they're very
well positioned."
