# Lowly Lakers are still kings of Staples
## 
### Ashley Westhem 
I was born and raised in Los An
geles, born and raised a USC
fan (don't worry, not anymore
—my past columns can cor
roborate that), but most impor
tantly, and relevantly, born and raised
a Lakers fan.
While my love for the Trojans
quickly dissipated when I joined
Nerd Nation, I won't turn my back on
the Lakers despite that horrifying
123-87 loss to the Clippers on Friday
(their largest loss in the almost 44
years of playing them).
I can acknowledge that there
might possibly be a new sheriff in LA
when it comes to the NBA, but I won't
be a turncoat or jump on the Clippers
bandwagon anyone who does that
was never a real Lakers fan to begin
with. That would be like suddenly tol
erating the Celtics it's just an ac
cepted rule that Lakers fans can't and
won't do that, ever.
This is not to say that I have an
ounce of faith in the Lakers or believe
that they can bounce back this season
and make the playoffs. The Lakers
have only ever not made the playoffs
once since the 1993-94 season, but I
can say without a doubt that this sea
son will be the second time.
I want to make it clear, though,
that I am a Lakers fan and always will
be it's just a part of being born in
Los Angeles that I'll always carry
with me because I don't want my
criticism to seem like I'm bashing the
Lakers or am disrespecting the fran
chise; my intention is not aimed to
wards accomplishing any of those. I'm
just talking as a disheartened Lakers
fan.
Right now, in the absence of Kobe
Bryant, Steve Nash, Steve Blake,
Jordan Farmar and Xavier Henry
due to injury, the Lakers are allowing
themselves to be walked all over one
and treated as an easy game where
everyone on the opposing team can
score and have some fun and laughs.
The Lakers are playing soft basket
ball.
Nick Young called it "embarrass
ing" after Friday's loss how they "let
people just dunk on us and clown us
without giving them a hard foul or
even showing any emotion."
Harnovers will be the demise of
the Lakers, as will the lack of forcing
turnovers. That just shows a lack of
effort, drive and intensity on the part
of the defense and a lack of confidence
and accountability on the part of the
offense. It is pretty hard to rally
though when you have no depth, no
chemistry and little hope.
But what happened to that heart
and drive of the Lakers? I think it's
been missing since just before the
passing of Jerry Buss. Since then,
nothing good has happened for the
Lakers. They spent loads of money
acquiring Steve Nash and Dwight
Howard, and look where that ended:
higher draft picks foregone, an un
happy and unproductive Howard for
the short time that he was in Los An
geles and the realization that Nash
might be nearing the end of his time
as a capable player.
Pau Gasol is the only player left on
the active roster who has champi
onship experience. The Lakers have
gone from a team of veterans and
stars to a team of newbies trying to
scrap together enough points for a
win. I'm not saying they're not talent
ed (I'm still a Nick Young fan from my
time as a USC supporter); they just
haven't figured out how to play to
gether.
Perhaps the coaching could be
blamed for that. I haven't heard of
any fan that is happy with Mike D'An
toni at the helm. However, no single
instance or person can be pegged for
this downfall of the Lakers—it's a
cumulative effect and a part of the
natural cycling of the NBA that
teams rise to prominence, fall to ob
scurity and then regroup and return
to dominance.
The Lakers are in the midst of a
free fall, but that only means that they
are coming off the heels of some kind
of prominence, and, in the case of the
Lakers franchise, periods of greatness
are more common than periods of in
significance. So as a Lakers fan, I en
courage all other fans out there who
consider the Lakers to be the reigning
Los Angeles team in the NBA
forevermore to remember that a few
bad seasons shouldn't wipe away the
memory of those seasons of NBA ex
cellence— that should be something
to rally the fans and the players.

Ashley Westhem nearly had a heart
attack when the Lakers were forced
to insert the recently signed
Kendall Marshall into the starting
lineup due to a rash of injuries.
