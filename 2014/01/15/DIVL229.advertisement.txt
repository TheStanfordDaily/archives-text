Just over a year after Sandy Hook, one of the worst
mass shootings in United States history, in which
twenty children and seven adults lost their lives,
Stanford Law School Professor John Donohue and
Attorney at Law, Donald E. J. Kilmer, Jr., will take
stock of gun use and ownership regulation in the US.
They will engage questions coming from both sides of current gun regulation debates, such as:
Is it a constitutional right to have a fully automatic weapon?
To achieve a reduction in the number of casualties at mass
public shootings, why wouldn't the best policy be to have a trained
person in place or already on scene to engage the shooter?
