## WHO'S IN THE RIGHT? 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
When the San Francisco j9ers and
Seattle Seahawks clash in this Sun
day's NFC Championship game, it
will be another installment in one of
the most heated personal rivalries in
sports between Jim Harbaugh and
Pete Carroll. Though Stanford fans
are quick to side with Harbaugh,
their former head coach, over Car
roll, who was known to run up the
score when coaching USC, Har
baugh has often played the part of
instigator in their infamous rela
tionship. We asked football writers
Winston Shi, David, Colin and Do-
Hyoung Park: Pac-12 affiliations
aside, which coach is the "good guy"
and which is the "bad guy"?

Winston: To be completely honest with
you, there really is no answer. Both coach
es aren't perfect. Harbaugh rubbed many
people the wrong way. While the "What's
your deal?" blowout announced Stanford's


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll and
49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh (above)
have been bitter rivals since Harbaugh came
to Stanford in 2007 and began relentlessly
striving to take down Carroll's USC Trojans.
revival as a football pro
gram, few Stanford fans will
argue that Harbaugh going
for two while up by four
touchdowns was a classy
move in any way. Though
Carroll's Trojans could run
up the score at times, Carroll
also knew when to let off the
gas, as Notre Dame and
Penn State fans will tell you.
Meanwhile, although
Carroll himself is popular,
USC lost a national champi
onship due to the Reggie
Bush scandal. In addition,
from Brian Cushing at USC
to a number of Seahawks
players now, Carroll's play
ers have shown a certain ten
dency to skirt the rules, es
pecially regarding PEDs.
We don't know how much
Carroll has to do with any of
these things, but ultimately
his team is his responsibility.
Should our college fan
dom factor into this assess
ment? As a rule, the relation
ship between a coach and a
school is the proverbial two
way street. Harbaugh de
serves a huge share of the
credit for rebuilding the
Stanford football program,
but in the end he viewed
Stanford as a stepping-stone
to his true dream: the NFL.
Carroll left USC once it was
clear that NCAA sanctions
were about to hamstring his
program. This is not to say
that Stanford should not be
grateful to Harbaugh, or
USC to Carroll but our
university allegiances
shouldn't really factor into
our perceptions of good and
evil.
Coaching football is a job,
and when it comes to our re
lationships with former col

lege coaches, as with Har
baugh and Carroll, it's ulti
mately just business when
they come and go. Even if
Richard Sherman's much
publicized beef with his for
mer coach happens to add
some color to the narrative,
whatever animosity may ex
ist between the two is ulti
mately a personal affair. It's
not our duty to determine
which one has the moral high
ground.
David: I know that, as a
Cardinal fan, I am seemingly
obligated to select Coach
Harbaugh as the "good guy."
I mean, how can I not sup
port a guy who clearly has
such good taste in television
shows? In all seriousness
though, I think that both
coaches have certainly had
their "bad guy" moments.
In Jim Harbaugh's case,
the instruction from Har
baugh and Defensive Coor
dinator Vic Fangio to Chase
Thomas 'l2 to fake an injury
in the 2010 Oregon game was
a pretty infamous moment
that did not reflect well on
the Stanford program. In
particular, that incident put
Stanford in inglorious com
pany with Cal as two Pac-12
programs that resorted to
dubious tactics in order to
challenge the Ducks.
In addition, once Har
baugh reached the NFL, he
made a point to endear him
self to his colleague Jim
Schwartz in their infamous
2011 post-game handshake.
While I believe that
Schwartz was certainly at
fault for his emotional out
burst in response to Har
baugh's "bro back tap," Har
baugh could have very easily
maintained some semblance
of professionalism at that
moment.

On the other hand, Car
roll is also not immune from

angering people. In particu
lar, the fallout from the Reg
gie Bush fiasco, which result
ed in Carroll's flight to the
NFL right before the NCAA
imposed harsh sanctions on
USC and crippled his once
proud-program, hurt Carrol
l's image.
Carroll has also drawn
additional criticism for the
fact that numerous Sea
hawks players have tested
positive for performance-en
hancing drugs on his watch.
These Seahawks include cor
nerbacks Brandon Browner
and Walter Thurmond, de
fensive end Bruce Irvin,
guard John Moffitt, offensive
lineman Allen Barbre and
safety Winston Guy.
In both cases, it appears to
me that Carroll is either ex
tremely naive, completely in
capable of maintaining "insti
tutional control" with regards
to the multiple programs that
he has led, or he is condoning
this behavior by his inaction. I
wonder which one it could be?
In the end, regardless of
my thoughts on Carroll and
Harbaugh, I completely
agree with Winston that we
will certainly be entertained
by the great storylines that
have come to define one of the
best rivalries in the NFL.

Do: Reader, let me take
you on a journey.

Imagine that the Pac-10
conference of the late 2000's is
an idyllic cul-de-sac buried
deep in the suburbs of
Nowhereville, Calif. Looking
at the scene, you can't help
but feel that the unifying fac
tor of the picture, the "I," so
to say is the sturdy, robust
cardinal-and-gold house on
the far side. It has a historic,
powerful aura about it, and
even the very houses around
it seem to acknowledge its
splendor, appearing almost as
supporting characters in the
grand scheme of the neigh
borhood. To outsiders, that
house is the very representa
tion of the neighborhood as a
whole.
On the front lawn struts a
dignified, regal mastiff. Read
er, meet Pete Carroll.
Hidden in the splendid
grandeur of the central house,
easily passed over as an after
thought in the grand planning
of the neighborhood, lies a
small, tattered, broken,
bruised outhouse. On one of
its walls, one can just barely
make out the faint outline of a
tree albeit a strange tree,
with eyes, legs and what looks
to be a human inside it. The
owners are considering sell
ing the outhouse but are re
luctant to do so because of its
once-proud history.
One day, a chihuahua ap
pears. Nobody knows where
he came from rumor has it
that he once lived in San
Diego but he immediately
takes the neighborhood by
storm. He treads freely on
the other dogs' territory He

yips to the left, yaps to the
right, urinates on everything
that moves and seemingly has
no sense of shame. He seems
to make his home in the out
house, and because of that,
nobody really takes him seri
ously. That's right enter
Jim Harbaugh.
Little Jimmy packs a lot of
spunk into his little frame. He
immediately takes to openly
challenging Pete's authority.
"I bow to no dog," Jimmy said
defiantly. He begins to chip
away at the very pillars of the
grand house, gnawing away
at them with his teeth. It
doesn't seem as if he is mak
ing much progress, and the
neighborhood writes him off
as "that crazy new dog."
But Jimmy persists. He
continues on. He recruits a
small army of the squirrels,
raccoons and pests of the
neighborhood to help his
cause. On Oct. 6, 2007, with
the help of a ferret known
only as "Tavita," a pillar of
the house falls. Pete watches
in horror. Outsiders take no
tice of the feisty Jimmy
Fast-forward two years.
Jimmy has made a notice
able dent in the house,
helped in part by a rather
portly greyhound known as
"Chip." Jimmy is relentless.
His squirrels, raccoons and
pests are bigger, better,
faster, stronger. Pete is hor
rified. He has done nothing
to disturb Jimmy yet Jimmy
has done nothing but disturb
the natural order of the
neighborhood since he first
moved in. Pete doesn't un

derstand. All he wanted was
to continue being comfort
able as leader of the previ
ously peaceful neighbor
hood. Pete is worried for his
house, which is starting to
show the stresses of Jimmy's
assaults.
Finally, the house falls.
Jimmy unleashes a raccoon
named "Toby" to wreak hav
oc on the aged walls and an
cient facades of the house,
and the house crumbles with
Pete watching helplessly. To
add insult to injury, Jimmy
jumps all over the skeleton
of the ruined house with an
almost rabid fervor until
every last board is splin
tered, every last pane of
glass shattered. He then im
mediately proceeds to push
the outhouse into the middle
of the rubble and firmly
plant its foundation.
After the dust settles, an
aghast Pete can only muster,
"What's your deal?"
With a grin, Jimmy an
swers, "What's your deal?"
So, reader, you decide.
Who's the good guy and
who's the bad guy here?

Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll and
49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh (above)
have been bitter rivals since Harbaugh came
to Stanford in 2007 and began relentlessly
striving to take down Carroll's USC Trojans.
revival as a football pro
gram, few Stanford fans will
argue that Harbaugh going
for two while up by four
touchdowns was a classy
move in any way. Though
Carroll's Trojans could run
up the score at times, Carroll
also knew when to let off the
gas, as Notre Dame and
Penn State fans will tell you.
Meanwhile, although
Carroll himself is popular,
USC lost a national champi
onship due to the Reggie
Bush scandal. In addition,
from Brian Cushing at USC
to a number of Seahawks
players now, Carroll's play
ers have shown a certain ten
dency to skirt the rules, es
pecially regarding PEDs.
We don't know how much
Carroll has to do with any of
these things, but ultimately
his team is his responsibility.
Should our college fan
dom factor into this assess
ment? As a rule, the relation
ship between a coach and a
school is the proverbial two
way street. Harbaugh de
serves a huge share of the
credit for rebuilding the
Stanford football program,
but in the end he viewed
Stanford as a stepping-stone
to his true dream: the NFL.
Carroll left USC once it was
clear that NCAA sanctions
were about to hamstring his
program. This is not to say
that Stanford should not be
grateful to Harbaugh, or
USC to Carroll but our
university allegiances
shouldn't really factor into
our perceptions of good and
evil.
Coaching football is a job,
and when it comes to our re
lationships with former col

lege coaches, as with Har
baugh and Carroll, it's ulti
mately just business when
they come and go. Even if
Richard Sherman's much
publicized beef with his for
mer coach happens to add
some color to the narrative,
whatever animosity may ex
ist between the two is ulti
mately a personal affair. It's
not our duty to determine
which one has the moral high
ground.
David: I know that, as a
Cardinal fan, I am seemingly
obligated to select Coach
Harbaugh as the "good guy."
I mean, how can I not sup
port a guy who clearly has
such good taste in television
shows? In all seriousness
though, I think that both
coaches have certainly had
their "bad guy" moments.
In Jim Harbaugh's case,
the instruction from Har
baugh and Defensive Coor
dinator Vic Fangio to Chase
Thomas 'l2 to fake an injury
in the 2010 Oregon game was
a pretty infamous moment
that did not reflect well on
the Stanford program. In
particular, that incident put
Stanford in inglorious com
pany with Cal as two Pac-12
programs that resorted to
dubious tactics in order to
challenge the Ducks.
In addition, once Har
baugh reached the NFL, he
made a point to endear him
self to his colleague Jim
Schwartz in their infamous
2011 post-game handshake.
While I believe that
Schwartz was certainly at
fault for his emotional out
burst in response to Har
baugh's "bro back tap," Har
baugh could have very easily
maintained some semblance
of professionalism at that
moment.

On the other hand, Car
roll is also not immune from

angering people. In particu
lar, the fallout from the Reg
gie Bush fiasco, which result
ed in Carroll's flight to the
NFL right before the NCAA
imposed harsh sanctions on
USC and crippled his once
proud-program, hurt Carrol
l's image.
Carroll has also drawn
additional criticism for the
fact that numerous Sea
hawks players have tested
positive for performance-en
hancing drugs on his watch.
These Seahawks include cor
nerbacks Brandon Browner
and Walter Thurmond, de
fensive end Bruce Irvin,
guard John Moffitt, offensive
lineman Allen Barbre and
safety Winston Guy.
In both cases, it appears to
me that Carroll is either ex
tremely naive, completely in
capable of maintaining "insti
tutional control" with regards
to the multiple programs that
he has led, or he is condoning
this behavior by his inaction. I
wonder which one it could be?
In the end, regardless of
my thoughts on Carroll and
Harbaugh, I completely
agree with Winston that we
will certainly be entertained
by the great storylines that
have come to define one of the
best rivalries in the NFL.

Do: Reader, let me take
you on a journey.

Imagine that the Pac-10
conference of the late 2000's is
an idyllic cul-de-sac buried
deep in the suburbs of
Nowhereville, Calif. Looking
at the scene, you can't help
but feel that the unifying fac
tor of the picture, the "I," so
to say is the sturdy, robust
cardinal-and-gold house on
the far side. It has a historic,
powerful aura about it, and
even the very houses around
it seem to acknowledge its
splendor, appearing almost as
supporting characters in the
grand scheme of the neigh
borhood. To outsiders, that
house is the very representa
tion of the neighborhood as a
whole.
On the front lawn struts a
dignified, regal mastiff. Read
er, meet Pete Carroll.
Hidden in the splendid
grandeur of the central house,
easily passed over as an after
thought in the grand planning
of the neighborhood, lies a
small, tattered, broken,
bruised outhouse. On one of
its walls, one can just barely
make out the faint outline of a
tree albeit a strange tree,
with eyes, legs and what looks
to be a human inside it. The
owners are considering sell
ing the outhouse but are re
luctant to do so because of its
once-proud history.
One day, a chihuahua ap
pears. Nobody knows where
he came from rumor has it
that he once lived in San
Diego but he immediately
takes the neighborhood by
storm. He treads freely on
the other dogs' territory He

yips to the left, yaps to the
right, urinates on everything
that moves and seemingly has
no sense of shame. He seems
to make his home in the out
house, and because of that,
nobody really takes him seri
ously. That's right enter
Jim Harbaugh.
Little Jimmy packs a lot of
spunk into his little frame. He
immediately takes to openly
challenging Pete's authority.
"I bow to no dog," Jimmy said
defiantly. He begins to chip
away at the very pillars of the
grand house, gnawing away
at them with his teeth. It
doesn't seem as if he is mak
ing much progress, and the
neighborhood writes him off
as "that crazy new dog."
But Jimmy persists. He
continues on. He recruits a
small army of the squirrels,
raccoons and pests of the
neighborhood to help his
cause. On Oct. 6, 2007, with
the help of a ferret known
only as "Tavita," a pillar of
the house falls. Pete watches
in horror. Outsiders take no
tice of the feisty Jimmy
Fast-forward two years.
Jimmy has made a notice
able dent in the house,
helped in part by a rather
portly greyhound known as
"Chip." Jimmy is relentless.
His squirrels, raccoons and
pests are bigger, better,
faster, stronger. Pete is hor
rified. He has done nothing
to disturb Jimmy yet Jimmy
has done nothing but disturb
the natural order of the
neighborhood since he first
moved in. Pete doesn't un

derstand. All he wanted was
to continue being comfort
able as leader of the previ
ously peaceful neighbor
hood. Pete is worried for his
house, which is starting to
show the stresses of Jimmy's
assaults.
Finally, the house falls.
Jimmy unleashes a raccoon
named "Toby" to wreak hav
oc on the aged walls and an
cient facades of the house,
and the house crumbles with
Pete watching helplessly. To
add insult to injury, Jimmy
jumps all over the skeleton
of the ruined house with an
almost rabid fervor until
every last board is splin
tered, every last pane of
glass shattered. He then im
mediately proceeds to push
the outhouse into the middle
of the rubble and firmly
plant its foundation.
After the dust settles, an
aghast Pete can only muster,
"What's your deal?"
With a grin, Jimmy an
swers, "What's your deal?"
So, reader, you decide.
Who's the good guy and
who's the bad guy here?

49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh (above)
have been bitter rivals since Harbaugh came
to Stanford in 2007 and began relentlessly
striving to take down Carroll's USC Trojans.
revival as a football pro
gram, few Stanford fans will
argue that Harbaugh going
for two while up by four
touchdowns was a classy
move in any way. Though
Carroll's Trojans could run
up the score at times, Carroll
also knew when to let off the
gas, as Notre Dame and
Penn State fans will tell you.
Meanwhile, although
Carroll himself is popular,
USC lost a national champi
onship due to the Reggie
Bush scandal. In addition,
from Brian Cushing at USC
to a number of Seahawks
players now, Carroll's play
ers have shown a certain ten
dency to skirt the rules, es
pecially regarding PEDs.
We don't know how much
Carroll has to do with any of
these things, but ultimately
his team is his responsibility.
Should our college fan
dom factor into this assess
ment? As a rule, the relation
ship between a coach and a
school is the proverbial two
way street. Harbaugh de
serves a huge share of the
credit for rebuilding the
Stanford football program,
but in the end he viewed
Stanford as a stepping-stone
to his true dream: the NFL.
Carroll left USC once it was
clear that NCAA sanctions
were about to hamstring his
program. This is not to say
that Stanford should not be
grateful to Harbaugh, or
USC to Carroll but our
university allegiances
shouldn't really factor into
our perceptions of good and
evil.
Coaching football is a job,
and when it comes to our re
lationships with former col

lege coaches, as with Har
baugh and Carroll, it's ulti
mately just business when
they come and go. Even if
Richard Sherman's much
publicized beef with his for
mer coach happens to add
some color to the narrative,
whatever animosity may ex
ist between the two is ulti
mately a personal affair. It's
not our duty to determine
which one has the moral high
ground.
David: I know that, as a
Cardinal fan, I am seemingly
obligated to select Coach
Harbaugh as the "good guy."
I mean, how can I not sup
port a guy who clearly has
such good taste in television
shows? In all seriousness
though, I think that both
coaches have certainly had
their "bad guy" moments.
In Jim Harbaugh's case,
the instruction from Har
baugh and Defensive Coor
dinator Vic Fangio to Chase
Thomas 'l2 to fake an injury
in the 2010 Oregon game was
a pretty infamous moment
that did not reflect well on
the Stanford program. In
particular, that incident put
Stanford in inglorious com
pany with Cal as two Pac-12
programs that resorted to
dubious tactics in order to
challenge the Ducks.
In addition, once Har
baugh reached the NFL, he
made a point to endear him
self to his colleague Jim
Schwartz in their infamous
2011 post-game handshake.
While I believe that
Schwartz was certainly at
fault for his emotional out
burst in response to Har
baugh's "bro back tap," Har
baugh could have very easily
maintained some semblance
of professionalism at that
moment.

On the other hand, Car
roll is also not immune from

angering people. In particu
lar, the fallout from the Reg
gie Bush fiasco, which result
ed in Carroll's flight to the
NFL right before the NCAA
imposed harsh sanctions on
USC and crippled his once
proud-program, hurt Carrol
l's image.
Carroll has also drawn
additional criticism for the
fact that numerous Sea
hawks players have tested
positive for performance-en
hancing drugs on his watch.
These Seahawks include cor
nerbacks Brandon Browner
and Walter Thurmond, de
fensive end Bruce Irvin,
guard John Moffitt, offensive
lineman Allen Barbre and
safety Winston Guy.
In both cases, it appears to
me that Carroll is either ex
tremely naive, completely in
capable of maintaining "insti
tutional control" with regards
to the multiple programs that
he has led, or he is condoning
this behavior by his inaction. I
wonder which one it could be?
In the end, regardless of
my thoughts on Carroll and
Harbaugh, I completely
agree with Winston that we
will certainly be entertained
by the great storylines that
have come to define one of the
best rivalries in the NFL.

Do: Reader, let me take
you on a journey.

Imagine that the Pac-10
conference of the late 2000's is
an idyllic cul-de-sac buried
deep in the suburbs of
Nowhereville, Calif. Looking
at the scene, you can't help
but feel that the unifying fac
tor of the picture, the "I," so
to say is the sturdy, robust
cardinal-and-gold house on
the far side. It has a historic,
powerful aura about it, and
even the very houses around
it seem to acknowledge its
splendor, appearing almost as
supporting characters in the
grand scheme of the neigh
borhood. To outsiders, that
house is the very representa
tion of the neighborhood as a
whole.
On the front lawn struts a
dignified, regal mastiff. Read
er, meet Pete Carroll.
Hidden in the splendid
grandeur of the central house,
easily passed over as an after
thought in the grand planning
of the neighborhood, lies a
small, tattered, broken,
bruised outhouse. On one of
its walls, one can just barely
make out the faint outline of a
tree albeit a strange tree,
with eyes, legs and what looks
to be a human inside it. The
owners are considering sell
ing the outhouse but are re
luctant to do so because of its
once-proud history.
One day, a chihuahua ap
pears. Nobody knows where
he came from rumor has it
that he once lived in San
Diego but he immediately
takes the neighborhood by
storm. He treads freely on
the other dogs' territory He

yips to the left, yaps to the
right, urinates on everything
that moves and seemingly has
no sense of shame. He seems
to make his home in the out
house, and because of that,
nobody really takes him seri
ously. That's right enter
Jim Harbaugh.
Little Jimmy packs a lot of
spunk into his little frame. He
immediately takes to openly
challenging Pete's authority.
"I bow to no dog," Jimmy said
defiantly. He begins to chip
away at the very pillars of the
grand house, gnawing away
at them with his teeth. It
doesn't seem as if he is mak
ing much progress, and the
neighborhood writes him off
as "that crazy new dog."
But Jimmy persists. He
continues on. He recruits a
small army of the squirrels,
raccoons and pests of the
neighborhood to help his
cause. On Oct. 6, 2007, with
the help of a ferret known
only as "Tavita," a pillar of
the house falls. Pete watches
in horror. Outsiders take no
tice of the feisty Jimmy
Fast-forward two years.
Jimmy has made a notice
able dent in the house,
helped in part by a rather
portly greyhound known as
"Chip." Jimmy is relentless.
His squirrels, raccoons and
pests are bigger, better,
faster, stronger. Pete is hor
rified. He has done nothing
to disturb Jimmy yet Jimmy
has done nothing but disturb
the natural order of the
neighborhood since he first
moved in. Pete doesn't un

derstand. All he wanted was
to continue being comfort
able as leader of the previ
ously peaceful neighbor
hood. Pete is worried for his
house, which is starting to
show the stresses of Jimmy's
assaults.
Finally, the house falls.
Jimmy unleashes a raccoon
named "Toby" to wreak hav
oc on the aged walls and an
cient facades of the house,
and the house crumbles with
Pete watching helplessly. To
add insult to injury, Jimmy
jumps all over the skeleton
of the ruined house with an
almost rabid fervor until
every last board is splin
tered, every last pane of
glass shattered. He then im
mediately proceeds to push
the outhouse into the middle
of the rubble and firmly
plant its foundation.
After the dust settles, an
aghast Pete can only muster,
"What's your deal?"
With a grin, Jimmy an
swers, "What's your deal?"
So, reader, you decide.
Who's the good guy and
who's the bad guy here?

When the San Francisco j9ers and
Seattle Seahawks clash in this Sun
day's NFC Championship game, it
will be another installment in one of
the most heated personal rivalries in
sports between Jim Harbaugh and
Pete Carroll. Though Stanford fans
are quick to side with Harbaugh,
their former head coach, over Car
roll, who was known to run up the
score when coaching USC, Har
baugh has often played the part of
instigator in their infamous rela
tionship. We asked football writers
Winston Shi, David, Colin and Do-
Hyoung Park: Pac-12 affiliations
aside, which coach is the "good guy"
and which is the "bad guy"?

Winston: To be completely honest with
you, there really is no answer. Both coach
es aren't perfect. Harbaugh rubbed many
people the wrong way. While the "What's
your deal?" blowout announced Stanford's
