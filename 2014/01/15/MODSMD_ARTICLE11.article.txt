## SEEING GREEN Gun Control 
### Holly Moeller 
This is not a column about how
we should regulate the pos
session of firearms in this
country.
Nor is this a column about the hu
man tragedy of gun-related vio
lence, despite the many examples.
Instead, this is a column about
how guns and other means of
hunting and fishing control wild
animal populations, from the basics
of their size and distribution, to the
subtle but profound carry-overs in
to evolutionary time.
As long as we have been Homo
sapiens, we have been predators.
Certainly, our diets have always
been mixed, taking advantage of
whatever bounty nature provided,
including large portions of plant
matter like fruits, tubers, even the
bark peeled from trees. But the
protein of other animals played
and continues to play an impor
tant role in our diet.
Today, most of our protein
comes from livestock reared on
farms specifically for our consump
tion. Yet the omnivores among us
may also consume animals harvest
ed from the wild: fish like cod, tuna,
or salmon; the occasional cut of
venison. (Despite my own forays in
to vegetarianism, I find all of the
above delicious.)
We occasionally hear disturbing
tales of how our harvest of natural
populations may be unsustainable.
The majority of our industrialized
fisheries are in decline or collapse.
The bush meat trade decimates
wildlife in South America and
Africa.
If we need any evidence that hu
man predation can drive other
species to the brink, we need look
no further than North America,
where the first human inhabitants
likely hunted many large mammals
(think woolly mammoth, etc.) to ex
tinction.
Yet we often do not hear about
another process that results from
our harvesting efforts: so-called
unnatural selection.
Unnatural selection is artificial
selection's accidental cousin. Artifi
cial selection occurs when humans
deliberately breed animals (or
plants) with the traits that we de
sire, so that subsequent genera
tions will have them. Artificial se
lection gave rise to exceptionally
milky cows, impressively woolly
sheep, a plethora of bizarre looking
dogs and cats, and even Darwin's
(r)evolutionary insights.
Artificial selection is something
that we do deliberately. Unnatural
selection is something we do acci
dentally - a consequence of prefer
entially capturing wild animals with
certain traits, leaving the remain
der of the population in the wild to
breed.
There are an increasing number
of examples of unnatural selection,
both in populations that we harvest
at large commercial scales for food,
and in those we hunt for sport.
Among the latter, studies in
Canada have shown that bighorn
sheep horns are getting smaller.
This happens because trophy
hunters kill the rams with the most
impressive racks. Thus, individual
sheep with smaller horns are more
likely to survive and reproduce,
passing their diminutive genes on
to the next generation. In Africa,
the (illegal) ivory trade produces a
selection pressure so strong that
tuskless elephants are on the rise.

At the commercial scale, larger
fish have more market value, so we
arrange our gear to preferentially
catch them. Over time, scientists
have observed a shift in cod repro
duction: these (relatively) long
lived fish now begin reproduction
at a younger age and smaller body
size.
These may read as interesting
facts, but they also have important
evolutionary consequences. There's
a reason that rams have horns:
They joust with them for the right
to mate, and as you might guess,
rams with bigger horns are
tougher, more fit, and more likely
to win, passing on their genes and
improving the robustness of the en
tire population. Similarly, bigger
codfish produce more young of
higher quality, improving the fit
ness of the entire population, and
its odds of surviving extinction over
the long course of evolutionary
time. By selectively removing the
healthiest individuals, we leave be
hind breeders whose offspring will
be more poorly adapted to their en
vironment.
All this is not to say that I am
opposed to hunting and fishing.
I would even argue that human
hunters should to play an impor
tant role in the control of certain
animal populations. For example,
deer are overpopulated in many
parts of the United States. In this
case, hunting can serve the dual
purpose of population control and
putting food on the table. (Did I al
ready mention that I find deer deli
cious?)
But we must show the same
awareness in our harvesting prac
tices that we have displayed in our
breeding programs. We must con
sider what it means to harvest the
strong, the big-antlered, the large
bodied. We have seen compelling
evidence that we are producing se
lection pressures that, at times, run
counter to those that these organ
isms would experience in our ab
sence. It's important to consider
what this means for their survival
in the long run.
