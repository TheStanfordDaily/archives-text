## Pot and the Pink Police State 
### Jason Willick 
Few cultural transformations
of the last generation are as
striking as the reversal of
public opinion toward marijuana.
At the start of the Clinton adminis
tration, Americans opposed legal
pot by a 4-to-l margin; today, a
majority of Americans support it,
and at the beginning of this year,
Colorado and Washington became
the first states to introduce com
mercial markets in recreational
weed.
This seismic shift has no doubt
been motivated in part by a desire
to ameliorate some of the worst
failures of the drug war, such as
racial bias in pot-related arrests
and unconscionably high rates of in
carceration for nonviolent offend
ers.
But these problems could also be
addressed with modest reforms
that stop well short of Colorado
style legalization. UCLA drug poli
cy expert Mark Kleiman, for exam
ple, supports a "grow-your-own"
marijuana regime that would de
criminalize personal possession but
prevent the emergence of "a legal

cannabis industry working hard to
produce as many chronic stoners as
possible."
The national march toward com
mercial cannabis is ultimately a
symbol of the live-and-let-live cul
tural libertarianism that increas
ingly defines our political moment,
and the Millennial generation in
particular.
More than any other demo
graphic, Millennials have led the
surge in support for legal pot, com
ing out in force to approve the ballot
measures in Colorado and Washing
ton last year.
Millennials' apparent preference
for release over restraint extends in
to the sphere of sexual freedom as
well a YouGov poll found 45% of
young voters support legalized pros
titution, more than any other age
group. The trend toward maximal
individual liberty is also evident in
the proliferation of commercial casi
nos in across the United States, es
pecially in the mid-Atlantic and
Northeast.
But young Americans are not
Randian individualists. The impulse
toward personal liberation and self
expression coexists with a pro
nounced confidence in government
institutions.
Compared to Gen X'ers and Ba
by Boomers, Millennials are sub
stantially less likely to favor a small
er government and more likely to fa
vor strong social legislation, accord
ing to a detailed report by the Pew
Research Center.
The liberal columnist Peter
Beinart drew on these findings in a
widely read Daily Beast essay, "The
Rise of the New New Left," which
argued persuasively that young
Americans will power a surge of Bill
De Blasio-style left-wing economic
populism.
The potential promise of the
"liberaltarian" that is culturally
libertarian and economically liberal
Millennial worldview is clear
enough: Religious moralism might
lose some influence in public policy
and government might provide
more economic security for the poor
and middle class.
But a society that blends cultur
al permisiveness with an activist
government also presents certain
perils. There is a tendency to be
lieve that vices are more tolerable if
they are government controlled:
proponents of legal prostitution of
ten tout the public health benefits of
government-regulated sex work,
just as proponents of legal pot and

gambling point to the tax revenue
that coulcl be generated by the weed
and casino industries.
These types of arguments per
suaded the Swiss government set
up publicly funded brothels, the
government of Uruguay to con
struct a state-run marijuana mo
nopoly, and a growing number of
cash-starved U.S. states to intro
duce commercial casinos.
As the cultural critic James Pou
los has suggested, it's easy to imag
ine 21st century society drifting to
ward a point where everything is
legal but everything is regulated,
the state is seen as a "cool parent,"
dispensing pleasures to its citizens,
and the government accumulates
more and more power without any
one feeling actually coerced.
Poulos provocatively describes
this unsettling phenomenon as the
"pink police state." In a 2009 inter
view with The Atlantic, Poulos said,
"citizens of a Pink Police State (I
should say subjects) are apt to sur
render more and more political lib
erty in exchange for more and more
cultural or 'personal' license.
'And the government of a Pink
Police State tends to monopolize
and totalize administrative control
while carving out a permissive
playpen for the people."
You don't have to agree with this
dystopian framing to see the poten
tial hazards that could arise from a
legalized marijuana industry.
Like the alcohol, gambling and
tobacco industries, it would depend
on the downscale and problem
users for the lion's share of its busi
ness. America's marketing genius
es might even manage to create a
drug problem where none existed
in the first place.
And insofar as state govern
ments share in the pot windfall
through heavy taxes (or by selling
the drug directly, as in Uruguay)
the revenues they earn are likely
to be highly regressive.
Most people can smoke an occa
sional joint, take a few trips to Ve
gas, or even frequent a brothel
without suffering any harm. But as
David Frum has pointed out, "mod
ern life is becoming steadily more
dangerous for people prone to
making bad choices." The state-as
cool-parent model has a clear ap
peal, but it also poses clear dangers
especially to the most vulnera
ble citizens.

Most people can smoke an occa

gas, or even frequent a brothel
without suffering any harm. But as
David Frum has pointed out, "mod

dangerous for people prone to
making bad choices." The state-as
cool-parent model has a clear ap
peal, but it also poses clear dangers
especially to the most vulnera

Few cultural transformations
of the last generation are as
striking as the reversal of
public opinion toward marijuana.
At the start of the Clinton adminis
tration, Americans opposed legal
pot by a 4-to-l margin; today, a
majority of Americans support it,
and at the beginning of this year,
Colorado and Washington became
the first states to introduce com
mercial markets in recreational
weed.
This seismic shift has no doubt
been motivated in part by a desire
to ameliorate some of the worst
failures of the drug war, such as
racial bias in pot-related arrests
and unconscionably high rates of in
carceration for nonviolent offend
ers.
But these problems could also be
addressed with modest reforms
that stop well short of Colorado
style legalization. UCLA drug poli
cy expert Mark Kleiman, for exam
ple, supports a "grow-your-own"
marijuana regime that would de
criminalize personal possession but
prevent the emergence of "a legal

cannabis industry working hard to
produce as many chronic stoners as
possible."
The national march toward com
mercial cannabis is ultimately a
symbol of the live-and-let-live cul
tural libertarianism that increas
ingly defines our political moment,
and the Millennial generation in
particular.
More than any other demo
graphic, Millennials have led the
surge in support for legal pot, com
ing out in force to approve the ballot
measures in Colorado and Washing
ton last year.
Millennials' apparent preference
for release over restraint extends in
to the sphere of sexual freedom as
well a YouGov poll found 45% of
young voters support legalized pros
titution, more than any other age
group. The trend toward maximal
individual liberty is also evident in
the proliferation of commercial casi
nos in across the United States, es
pecially in the mid-Atlantic and
Northeast.
But young Americans are not
Randian individualists. The impulse
toward personal liberation and self
expression coexists with a pro
nounced confidence in government
institutions.
Compared to Gen X'ers and Ba
by Boomers, Millennials are sub
stantially less likely to favor a small
er government and more likely to fa
vor strong social legislation, accord
ing to a detailed report by the Pew
Research Center.
The liberal columnist Peter
Beinart drew on these findings in a
widely read Daily Beast essay, "The
Rise of the New New Left," which
argued persuasively that young
Americans will power a surge of Bill
De Blasio-style left-wing economic
populism.
The potential promise of the
"liberaltarian" that is culturally
libertarian and economically liberal
Millennial worldview is clear
enough: Religious moralism might
lose some influence in public policy
and government might provide
more economic security for the poor
and middle class.
But a society that blends cultur
al permisiveness with an activist
government also presents certain
perils. There is a tendency to be
lieve that vices are more tolerable if
they are government controlled:
proponents of legal prostitution of
ten tout the public health benefits of
government-regulated sex work,
just as proponents of legal pot and

gambling point to the tax revenue
that coulcl be generated by the weed
and casino industries.
These types of arguments per
suaded the Swiss government set
up publicly funded brothels, the
government of Uruguay to con
struct a state-run marijuana mo
nopoly, and a growing number of
cash-starved U.S. states to intro
duce commercial casinos.
As the cultural critic James Pou
los has suggested, it's easy to imag
ine 21st century society drifting to
ward a point where everything is
legal but everything is regulated,
the state is seen as a "cool parent,"
dispensing pleasures to its citizens,
and the government accumulates
more and more power without any
one feeling actually coerced.
Poulos provocatively describes
this unsettling phenomenon as the
"pink police state." In a 2009 inter
view with The Atlantic, Poulos said,
"citizens of a Pink Police State (I
should say subjects) are apt to sur
render more and more political lib
erty in exchange for more and more
cultural or 'personal' license.
'And the government of a Pink
Police State tends to monopolize
and totalize administrative control
while carving out a permissive
playpen for the people."
You don't have to agree with this
dystopian framing to see the poten
tial hazards that could arise from a
legalized marijuana industry.
Like the alcohol, gambling and
tobacco industries, it would depend
on the downscale and problem
users for the lion's share of its busi
ness. America's marketing genius
es might even manage to create a
drug problem where none existed
in the first place.
And insofar as state govern
ments share in the pot windfall
through heavy taxes (or by selling
the drug directly, as in Uruguay)
the revenues they earn are likely
to be highly regressive.
