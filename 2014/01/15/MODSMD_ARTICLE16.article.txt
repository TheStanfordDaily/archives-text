# TIGERS TOASTED
## 
### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 41 Stanford (1-0, 0-0
Pac-12) men's tennis team opened
its season campaign Tuesday at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium with a
comfortable win over the Pacific
Tigers (0-1, 0-0 Big West). The Car
dinal opened the ledger with a very
consistent team performance, win
ning the doubles point and five out
of the six singles matches.

The contest was held under the
new experimental NCAA rules,
which got rid of ad scoring and re
duced the doubles matches to one
set in an effort to speed up the pace
of play. While many coaches and
players have stated their opposition
to the changes, the changes will last
until at least mid-February, at which
time they will be reviewed. Rules
changes aside, the Cardinal is happy
to notch its first win of the season
and one which sets them up nicely
going into the Sherwood Cup this
coming weekend.
The doubles matches started
well for Stanford, with the No. 3
team of sophomores Anthony
Tsodikov and Nolan Paige excelling
in a comfortable 6-1 victory over Pa
cific's juniors Alex Hamilton and
Denis Stolyarov. Paige and Tsodikov
showed some excellent passages of
play, including one point wherein a
beautiful backhand lob by Tsodikov

was followed by a crisp drop volley
by Paige to secure a break. The duo
never looked in danger and will look
to build on what was a very good
opening performance that set the
tone for the rest of the match.
The other two matches, however,
were significantly closer. Stanford's
No. 1 team, made up of junior John
Morrissey and sophomore Maciek
Romanowicz, eked out a tight 6-4
victory over sophomores Daniel
Alameh and Marlon Brand in a
match that flowed back and forth.
Brand, a Dutchman standing 6-foot
5, caused problems for the Cardinal
duo with his serve. Eventually, they
pulled through, with Romanowicz
putting an exclamation point on the
victory with a final ace.
This victory turned out to be cru
cial in securing the doubles point, as
Stanford's No. 2 group, senior
Daniel Ho and junior Robert Stine
man, were at that point losing 5-4 to
the team of sophomore Sem Ver
beek (ITA No. 105 in singles) and
freshman Miguel Diaz. The Stan
ford duo, plagued by numerous un
forced errors that allowed the game
to slip away, surely must have been
pleased to see its teammates help
out in securing the point.
Point safely in hand, the Cardinal
moved on to the singles, where it con
tinued its serene progress. Tsodikov
continued his fantastic start to the
season with a comfortable 6-2,6-0 vic
tory over Hamilton from the No. 6
spot, with Hamilton seemingly hav
ing no answer for the lefthander's
somewhat unorthodox style.
Sophomore Trey Strobel then
continued the accumulation of

points at No. 5 with a 6-3, 6-4 win
over Brand in what was a solid per
formance. Finally, victory was se
cured by Romanowicz —who had
been locked in a very tight match
with Stolyarov in the No. 3 spot
when he put away a final forehand,
punching the air in delight. Victory
was ensured, but the margin was
still yet to be decided.
Next came Nolan Paige with a 6-
5,6-4 win over Diaz in the No. 4 slot,
a victory that will help build his con
fidence going into the meat of the
schedule. Another impres

sive and gutsy performance came
from Ho, a come-from-behind win
ner 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 over Alameh. The
first set was marred by numerous
unforced errors on the part of Ho,
but he recovered and used his dan
gerous forehand and solid serve to
wear down Alameh and seal the vic
tory.
Finally, the marquee match:
Stanford's Morrissey went up
against the dangerous Verbeek and
started off superbly, winning the
first set 6-4. However, he would
eventually succumb in a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2

loss. The turning point came in the
third set, when Morrissey lost four
straight points and conceded a key
break of serve. Result notwith
standing, there were a lot of posi
tives to take from the performance.
Overall, the Cardinal will be
pleased with a very strong team ef
fort in a 6-1 victory and now turns
its attention to the prestigious Sher
wood Cup, held this weekend in
Sherwood Oaks, Calif.

to build on what was a very good
opening performance that set the
tone for the rest of the match.
The other two matches, however,
were significantly closer. Stanford's
No. 1 team, made up of junior John
Morrissey and sophomore Maciek
Romanowicz, eked out a tight 6-4
victory over sophomores Daniel
Alameh and Marlon Brand in a
match that flowed back and forth.
Brand, a Dutchman standing 6-foot
5, caused problems for the Cardinal
duo with his serve. Eventually, they
pulled through, with Romanowicz
putting an exclamation point on the
victory with a final ace.
This victory turned out to be cru
cial in securing the doubles point, as
Stanford's No. 2 group, senior
Daniel Ho and junior Robert Stine
man, were at that point losing 5-4 to
the team of sophomore Sem Ver
beek (ITA No. 105 in singles) and
freshman Miguel Diaz. The Stan
ford duo, plagued by numerous un
forced errors that allowed the game
to slip away, surely must have been
pleased to see its teammates help
out in securing the point.
Point safely in hand, the Cardinal
moved on to the singles, where it con
tinued its serene progress. Tsodikov
continued his fantastic start to the
season with a comfortable 6-2,6-0 vic
tory over Hamilton from the No. 6
spot, with Hamilton seemingly hav
ing no answer for the lefthander's
somewhat unorthodox style.
Sophomore Trey Strobel then
continued the accumulation of

points at No. 5 with a 6-3, 6-4 win
over Brand in what was a solid per
formance. Finally, victory was se
cured by Romanowicz —who had
been locked in a very tight match
with Stolyarov in the No. 3 spot
when he put away a final forehand,
punching the air in delight. Victory
was ensured, but the margin was
still yet to be decided.
Next came Nolan Paige with a 6-
5,6-4 win over Diaz in the No. 4 slot,
a victory that will help build his con
fidence going into the meat of the
schedule. Another impres

sive and gutsy performance came
from Ho, a come-from-behind win
ner 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 over Alameh. The
first set was marred by numerous
unforced errors on the part of Ho,
but he recovered and used his dan
gerous forehand and solid serve to
wear down Alameh and seal the vic
tory.
Finally, the marquee match:
Stanford's Morrissey went up
against the dangerous Verbeek and
started off superbly, winning the
first set 6-4. However, he would
eventually succumb in a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2

loss. The turning point came in the
third set, when Morrissey lost four
straight points and conceded a key
break of serve. Result notwith
standing, there were a lot of posi
tives to take from the performance.
Overall, the Cardinal will be
pleased with a very strong team ef
fort in a 6-1 victory and now turns
its attention to the prestigious Sher
wood Cup, held this weekend in
Sherwood Oaks, Calif.

Sophomore Maciek Romanowicz (above) and junior John Morrissey, Stanford's No. 1 doubles pair, came
out on top with a win over Pacific on Tuesday to help the Cardinal earn its doubles point and win the match.
The No. 41 Stanford (1-0, 0-0
Pac-12) men's tennis team opened
its season campaign Tuesday at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium with a
comfortable win over the Pacific
Tigers (0-1, 0-0 Big West). The Car
dinal opened the ledger with a very
consistent team performance, win
ning the doubles point and five out
of the six singles matches.

The contest was held under the
new experimental NCAA rules,
which got rid of ad scoring and re
duced the doubles matches to one
set in an effort to speed up the pace
of play. While many coaches and
players have stated their opposition
to the changes, the changes will last
until at least mid-February, at which
time they will be reviewed. Rules
changes aside, the Cardinal is happy
to notch its first win of the season
and one which sets them up nicely
going into the Sherwood Cup this
coming weekend.
The doubles matches started
well for Stanford, with the No. 3
team of sophomores Anthony
Tsodikov and Nolan Paige excelling
in a comfortable 6-1 victory over Pa
cific's juniors Alex Hamilton and
Denis Stolyarov. Paige and Tsodikov
showed some excellent passages of
play, including one point wherein a
beautiful backhand lob by Tsodikov

was followed by a crisp drop volley
by Paige to secure a break. The duo
never looked in danger and will look
to build on what was a very good
opening performance that set the
tone for the rest of the match.
