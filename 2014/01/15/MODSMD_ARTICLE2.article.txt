# Zuckerberg draws large MemAud crowd
## President Hennessy hosts a talk with Facebook founder 
### JENNA SHAPIRO 
Facebook founder and CEO Mark
Zuckerberg and Stanford President
John Hennessy came together for a
conversation in front of a packed Me
morial Auditorium on Tuesday, cover
ing a wide range of topics including
their similar backgrounds as tech pio
neers and their mutual appreciation
for the humanities in engineering.
Senior Assistant to the President
Jeff Wachtel '79 helped organize the
talk, stressing the effectiveness of the
event's unscripted format.
"The idea is to have [the conversa
tion] be as fresh and spontaneous as it
can be," Wachtel said. "The idea
makes for a more interesting and en
joyable session than a scripted one,
with really honest responses to issues
and questions."
During the talk, Zuckerberg
shared his former and current aspira
tions for Facebook. He spoke of how
the company originated in a conver
sation over nightly pizza with his
close friend at Harvard when they
discussed the likelihood of building
a social network for the world. At the
time, however, they had not thought
much about their role in such a net
work.
"It didn't cross my mind that we'd
be the people to do it," Zuckerberg
said. "There were all these other com
panies that had experiences and tens
of thousands of engineers... I as
sumed that one of them would go on to
build this."
Zuckerberg's vision for the compa
ny for the last six years has been to
connect one billion people, one of their
"craziest" goals said Zuckerberg. He
later added, "no one really took [the
goal] seriously."

The company surpassed the mile
stone about a year ago. The multibil
lion-dollar social network now has its
sights set on connecting everyone
worldwide.
Zuckerberg noted that two-thirds
of the globe still has no access to the
Internet, a fact that he is concerned
about given that pooling people's
knowledge together can solve prob
lems.

"We are robbed of an opportunity
to benefit fi*om the communication
that all those folks will bring," he said.
Hennessy and Zuckerberg also
discussed their respective career
paths that they found to be similar.
Hennessy joined Stanford as an
electrical engineering professor in
1977 and moved up the ranks as direc
tor of Stanford's Computer System
Laboratory, chair of the Computer

Science Department, dean of the
School of Engineering, provost and
now president. A pioneer in the field of
computer architecture, Hennessy
helped found MIPS Computer Sys
tems, Inc. (now MIPS Technologies,
Inc.), a semiconductor design compa
ny.
Zuckerberg excelled starting at a
young age, as he learned Atari BASIC
Programming from his father in mid

die school, took a graduate-level com
puter programming class in high
school and became founder and CEO
of his own social network in college.
Anton Apostolatos 'l6, a computer
science major, noted the tech giants'
career crossovers.
"Hennessy comes from an aca
demic standpoint, while Zuckerberg is
a drop-out who did his own thing,"
Apostolatos said. "They're two very
different sides of the same coin."
While that is a very tech-centric
coin, Zuckerberg himself harbors an
appreciation for the humanities along
side his savvy computer skills. He
earned a diploma in classics in prep
school, has reportedly quoted lines
from Virgil's Roman epic poem "The
Aeneid" at a Facebook product confer
ence and was pursuing a psychology
major while at Harvard.
During the talk, Zuckerberg dis
cussed the dichotomy of the technical
and humanities-based fields a di
vide that is no secret at Stanford.
"A lot of times, interesting work is
done at the intersection of the two,"
Zuckerberg said. "One thing you learn
in college is what problem to pick to
solve, rather than how to solve these
problems... [and] being able to look
across disciplines and pick problems
that are real rather than only focusing
on technology."
Students appreciated hearing tech
nology giants Hennessy and Zucker
berg both talk about bridging the gap
between technology and humanities.
"I came [to the conversation today]
because I am a humanities major and
don't know much about the tech
world," Asia Chiao 'l5. "I appreciate
what [Zuckerberg] said about bridg
ing the gap that is so vividly illustrat
ed at Stanford with the fuzzy-techie
divide."
