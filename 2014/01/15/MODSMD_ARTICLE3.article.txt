## Profs study impact of ultrarunning Stress fractures less prevalent in ultrarunners than other runners 
### JULIA TURAN 
While participation in ultramarathons
which cover distances beyond the standard
26.2-mile marathons has seen a surge of pop
ularity in recent years, not much is known about
the health effects of this extreme exercise.
Eswar Krishnan, assistant professor of
medicine at Stanford, and Martin Hoffman,
professor of physical medicine and rehabilita
tion at UC-Davis, recently published a study in
the journal PLOS ONE that addresses the is
sue.
"I'm tired of my family telling me that all
this running is bad for me, without some sci
ence," said Hoffman, who is an ultrarunner him
self.
The Ultrarunners Longitudinal Tracking
Study consisted of an online questionnaire in
which ultrarunners answered questions about
the last 12 months of competitions as well as
questions about their training, general health
and running-related injuries.

The study is geared towards helping under
stand how much exercise is best, and how fat
runners should push their bodies.
"We want to understand the more general
concept of physical function, meaning why are
some patients able to perform well, while others
are not," Krishnan said.
The effect of ultrarunning on the body of
athletes remains unclear from the study due to
difficulty in isolating the effects of ultrarunning.
However, Hoffman said that the biggest con
cern for these runners —in terms of adverse
health effects —is cardiac arrhythmia, which
has been shown as a risk factor in cross-section
al studies.
Krishnan also noted the possibility of kidney
failure, due to an increase in muscle breakdown
products; however, when breakdown occurs in
ultrarunners, it usually resolves quickly
While Krishnan and Hoffman plan to contin
ue studying their pool of 1,200 runners for 20
years, their latest work did reveal some health
statistics specific to ultrarunners.
The latest study showed that over 75 per
cent of ultrarunners had some injury in the past
year, with injuries more common in younger,
less experienced runners. Most of the injuries

were related to knees or other parts of the leg.
Stress fractures were found to be less com
mon in ultrarunners than other runners. How
ever, stress fractures are still important to con
sider, especially in women who are more prone
to osteoporosis in older age. An upcoming study
by Krishnan and Hoffman will look further into
osteoporosis.
Additionally, the incidence of asthma and al
lergies was 11 and 25 percent respectively in ul
trarunners, compared to the 7-8 percent of both
cases in the general population. The higher in
cidence of allergies is not a new observation,
according to Krishnan, given the theory that
runners are more exposed to allergens by be
ing outdoors more often. The asthma cases
were not permanent, making it not such a sig
nificant health problem, Krishnan added.
Krishnan and Hoffman are now looking to
shift their focus to former runners who may
have had to quit due to injury, personal reasons
or medical problems. This will allow for a com
parison between healthy ultrarunners and
those who have had to stop running.
Krishnan and Hoffman will also work with
sports psychologists to understand peoples' at
titudes towards competition.

"I think it's in their mind,
that fact that they can stay
focused for so many hours,"
Krishnan said.
Hoffman added
that people's motivations
toward intense exercise like
ultrarunning is a key fac
tor they want to address.
"Part of it is sort
-1 ing through what moti
vates people to exercise
this much, and if we
could get a better handle

on that, maybe it would
have some application to the general population,
where only a very low percentage [of people] ac
tually exercise," Hoffman said.
