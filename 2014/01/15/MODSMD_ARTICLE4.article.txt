## Senate passes funding for Ansari show $20,000 to subsidize performance by "Parks and Recreation" star 
### ANDREW VOGELEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a meeting that lasted almost three
hours, the 15th Undergraduate Senate
passed a funding bill granting the Stanford
Speakers Bureau the $20,000 they needed
to secure comedian Aziz Ansari for an on
campus performance.
The Senate was forced to use money
from the buffer fund due to the last-minute
nature of the request. Several senators ex
pressed concern over using money that is
not traditionally used for general program
ming and events.
"My reservations at the beginning were
simply what precedent it would set," Sena
tor Zane Hellmann 'l6 said. The senators
were under the impression that the Speak
ers Bureau had approximately $lOO,OOO in
its reserves fund.
Senator Angela Zhang 'l6, one of the bil
l's sponsors, called in Robert Chun 'l6, vice
president of the Speakers Bureau, to an
swer questions about why the Speakers Bu
reau was asking for money when it had
$lOO,OOO in reserves. Chun claimed that the
Bureau needed a large reserve fund to plan
early for events.
"I feel like [the Speakers Bureau] has
enough money in their reserves," said sena
tor Hisham Al-Falih 'l6. "They could have
gotten the money from their reserves right
now and then figured out another source of
funding as they went on."
While the bill ultimately passed by an
11-3 margin, it came with some conditions.
Senator Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6 extract
ed a promise from Chun that he would push
for the Speakers Bureau to make tickets
first available to undergraduates. Although
Chun, as vice president, did not have the
power to make that promise at the meeting,
he assured the senators that
he would strongly endorse
giving undergraduates the
ability to obtain tickets to
the event before the rest of
the Stanford community.
"I'm very glad that Aziz
Ansari is coming to cam
pus," Senate Chair Ben Hol
ston 'l5 said. "I think it will
be a great show."
Official debate regarding
the constitutional amend
ment mandating upper
classmen spots on the Sen
ate also began Tuesday
night. The Senate will vote
on a bill next week that en
forces the amendment ap
proved by the student body
last spring.
The current version of
the bill calls for the election
of three upperclassmen, so
long as they receive at least
two-thirds of the votes re
ceived by the underclass
men with the twelfth-most
votes.
According to Holston,
the two-thirds requirement
was designed to ensure that
upperclassmen elected to
the Senate under this new
provision are deserving of
their spot.
"Last year, there were
two upperclassmen that
ran," Holston said. "With
out any checks, and just im
plementing the amendment
directly, theoretically they
would have needed one vote
to get elected."
The Senate also met with
Jeanette Smith-Laws, direc
tor of operations and student
unions, to discuss the
progress of the Windhover
Contemplative Center. The
Center, which will be located
across from Roble Hall, will
function as a reflective space

and also house several pieces
of art from the collection of
the late Nathan Oliveira, a
former Stanford professor.
"Your phones, computers
and devices will not work in

this space as soon as you
walk through this space, in
tentionally," Smith-Laws
said.
The building is scheduled
to be completed in May.

The Senate also passed
an additional $74,602.14 in
funding bills.
