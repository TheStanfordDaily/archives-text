## The
						reigning kings of quarterbacks 
### Viggy Venkataraman 
Brady-Manning XV Was
there ever any doubt? In
this wild and wacky NFL
season, complete with all
the hallmarks of true dra
ma, including, but not limited to, stir
ring comebacks, coaching malfeasance,
strange fines, blown calls, concussion
controversy and even some occasional
ly excellent football, the AFC playoffs
find themselves perched on the
precipice of another entry in the log
book of the quarterback rivalry of our
generation.
Tom Brady. Peyton Manning.
Round 15, for a chance to reach the
Super Bowl in what just might be the
swan song of both of their careers.
It is strange to think that both
quarterbacks are nearing the end.
Manning himself admitted as much
last week, when he said that, "The
light is at the end of the tunnel for
me." It seems like just yesterday that
Manning was a fresh-faced prospect
coming out of Tennessee, by and
large the most hyped quarterback
entering the draft in a good number
of years.
And Brady? His rise to greatness
remains one of the greatest underdog
stories of all time, as the quarterback
drafted with the 199 th overall pick in
the sixth round of the draft has ce
mented his legacy as one of the great
est ever to lace up a pair of cleats.
Between Brady and Manning,
nearly eveiy single-season passing
record has been shattered twice over.
They have reached seven of the last 12
Super Bowls, winning four in total;
Manning will undoubtedly win the
MVP this year, his fifth award overall,
while Brady has won the award twice
and also owns two Super Bowl MVPs.
And yet, as Brady turns 37 this com
ing year and Manning turns 38,
though neither shows any sign of de
cline, it would be foolish to take their
continued good health for granted.
This might be the climactic final duel
between two of the game's greatest.
There are a ton of confounding
factors leading up to this game. Both
teams have been ravaged by injuries,
with the Broncos having lost line
backer Von Miller, offensive tackle
Ryan Clady and cornerback Chris
Harris Jr. and the Patriots having
lost defensive tackle Vince Wilfork,
linebacker Jerod Mayo and tight end
Rob Gronkowski, all to season-end
ing injuries.
The Broncos wield one of the
greatest offenses the game has ever
seen, having scored over 600 points
for the season (a feat that has never
before been accomplished, even by
the vaunted 2007 New England Pa
triots). Meanwhile, the Patriots of
fense has assumed a new identity be
hind a strong offensive line and a
frightening three-headed-monster at
running back, starring LeGarrette
Blount (force trauma), Stevan "Rim
bleitis" Ridley, and Shane "please
don't get injured" Vereen.
Both defenses, missing their su
perstar's, have had to adopt a next
man-up philosophy that has left the
patchwork defensive products dis
tinctly vulnerable. And the game will
be played in mile-high conditions in
Denver, where it promises to be cold
er than a Rocky-Mountain-brewed
can of Coors Light.
In short, the factors would seem
to suggest that a shootout is in order,
making a slow plodding defensive
struggle the most likely outcome,
since this appears to have been the
NFL season where pigs flew and hell
froze over.
If there is one thing that I have
learned these last few years, it is that
winning a Super Bowl might be the
most impressive feat in any team
sport. Baseball and basketball have
the seven-game series, where the sta
tistical likelihood of the "lesser" team
dominating the "greater" team over
a majority of the series is quite low.
In football? We've got 60 minutes
to decide a champion, meaning all
bets are off. Anything can happen,
and that is a fact.
As a Patriots fan, I'm terrified of
facing Manning and the Broncos. But
I can take solace in the fact that
Broncos fans nationwide are terrified
of facing Brady and the Pats.
I have no prediction this week, as
I'm afraid of jinxing the outcome.
Rest assured, I will be watching the
game whilst chewing my nails in
earnest. May the best quarterback
(whoops, I meant team) win.

his first words as if they were yester
day, as they occurred around the same
time that Manning entered the NFL.
