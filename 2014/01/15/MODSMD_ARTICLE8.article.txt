## Reynolds, Fleming to enter NFL Draft 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITORS 
Stanford senior free safety Ed
Reynolds and senior right tackle
Cam Fleming announced on Tues
day that they would forego their
fifth years of eligibility and enter
the NFL Draft. Some analysts
project Reynolds to be as high as a
second-round pick, while Fleming
will probably be a mid- to late
round selection.
"I would [like] to thank the
Stanford football family for putting
me in this position and preparing
me for the next level," Reynolds
said in a statement. "Avery special
thanks to our coaching staff, sup
port staff and my teammates for
making the memories of these past
four years last a lifetime... A bet
ter script could not have been writ
ten for my experience at Stanford
as a student-athlete."
Reynolds earned first-team
All-Pac-12 and CBSSports.com
first-team All-America honors this
year, and he will return to school
this spring and in the offseason to
finish his Political Science degree.
After sitting out the 2011 sea
son with an ACL/MCL tear, the
Stoneville, N.C., native burst onto
the scene in 2012, intercepting six
passes and leading the country in
pick-sixes (three) and interception
return yards (301). Had he not
been marked down at the 1-yard
line on his final interception return
of the season yet not overturned
a ruling that was seemingly
contradicted by instant replay
Reynolds would have tied FBS
records in both categories.
Reynolds' 2013 season was cer
tainly less impressive from a sta
tistical standpoint, as his only in
terception came in the first game
of the season against San Jose
State. In large part, however, that
downturn was a result of the re
spect he commanded from oppos
ing teams, as the All-American
was rarely targeted with down
field passes in 2013. Despite that
fact, Reynolds finished third on
the team with 87 tackles.
Though Reynolds' departure
was expected, it leaves the Cardi
nal with serious questions to an
swer at the free safety position.
His primary backup, classmate
Devon Carrington, is out of eligi

bility and will not return in 2014,
while former free safety Drew
Madhu was forced to retire before
last season for medical reasons.
Stanford is so thin at safety that
sophomore quarterback Dallas
Lloyd joined the position group
during the team's Rose Bowl prac
tices.
Fleming's departure will also
hit the Cardinal hard. A second
team All-Pac-12 selection this sea
son and a two-time All-Pac-12 hon
orable mention recipient, Fleming
played in 39 games for the Cardi
nal all starts in the last three
seasons after redshirting his
freshman year, as he quietly be
came one of the cornerstones of a
formidable Stanford offensive line.
Fleming, along with center
Sam Schwartzstein 'l2 and senior
guard David Yankey, burst onto
Stanford's offensive line scene in
2011 as part of a younger corps
that maintained the lofty stan
dards of the departed 2010 gradu
ating class of linemen. He started
11 out of the Cardinal's 13 games
in 2011 as a redshirt freshman
missing two games with an ankle
injury and was key in run
blocking and pass protection for
one of the most dominant offenses
in school history.
In the next two seasons, Flem
ing started all 28 games at right
tackle and helped anchor a Stan
ford offensive line that quickly be
came acknowledged as one of the
best in the nation. His large size
6-foot-6, 318 pounds and solid

fundamentals meant that he was
rarely beaten on the edge by his
blocking assignments, and also
helped him pave the way for both
Stepfan Taylor 'l2 and senior Tyler

Gaffney to have historic rushing
seasons.
Fleming's departure will mark
a fundamental changing of the
guard on the offensive line for the
Cardinal. Left guard David
Yankey, fifth-year senior center
Khalil Wilkes and fifth-year senior
right guard Kevin Danser are all
leaving the team as well, paving
the way for the linemen of the
highly touted 2012 recruiting class
to take their places. Sophomore
Kyle Murphy a five-star recruit
and junior Brendon Austin will
likely compete to replace Fleming
at right tackle, while sophomore
guards Johnny Caspers and
Joshua Garnett will look to take on
starting roles as well.
Fleming, who will earn his un
dergraduate degree in aeronautics
and astronautics this spring, joins
Yankey and Reynolds in electing to
enter the draft. Linebacker A.J.
Tarpley and defensive linemen
Henry Anderson and David Parry
have announced that they will re
turn for one more season.
