# Home sweep a must
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
After scoring an upset win
on Sunday against then-No. 17
Oregon, the Stanford men's
basketball team finds itself in
an interesting position head
ing into its games against
Washington State and Wash

ington this week at home.
With a sweep, the Cardinal
could put itself not only back
in the thick of the conference
race, but also in the hunt for
an NCAA tournament bid.
With anything less, Stanford
will put itself back in a hole.
The Cardinal (10-5, 1-2
Pac-12) put forth two of its

most incongruous perform
ances of the season last week
on the road in Oregon. Stan
ford suffered an ignominious
81-72 defeat at the hands of
the Oregon State Beavers last
Thursday night in Corvallis,
Ore. its first loss in its past
five meetings against OSU
before gaining some method
of redemption with the win
over the Ducks in Eugene,
Ore.
As has been the case all
season long, junior guard
Chasson Randle was again at
the forefront of Stanford's ef
forts in both victory and de
feat, averaging 26.5 points on
56.3 percent shooting in the
two games last week. Had
Stanford managed to avoid the
disaster in Corvallis, it is like
ly Randle would have picked
up his second Pac-12 Player of
the Week honor of the season.
Instead, the award went to
Cal's Justin Cobbs, whose
team swept the Oregon
schools. Randle is now averag
ing 19.5 points per game this
season, which puts him third
in the Pac-12.
No one player's week
summed the team's perform
ances like senior guard An
thony Brown, who struggled
mightily against Oregon
State on Thursday before
bouncing back to score a ca
reer-high 24 points against
Oregon on Sunday. Stanford's
backcourt duo of Brown and
Randle has been one of the
team's strengths all season
long, and if the pair can con
tinue to put up simultaneous
performances like the one
they put together against
Oregon, the Cardinal can be
awfully tough to beat.
Washington State (8-8,1-3)
is the first test for Stanford
this week. Much like the
matchup with Oregon State,
the Cardinal will again be

heavily favored, but the
Cougars have the ability to
create some serious prob
lems should Stanford not be
on its game. WSU plays a
low-possession, low-scoring
brand of basketball that can
be frustrating for opponents
at times, as evidenced by the
Cougars' 49-46 upset victory
over Utah last week.

"They play different de
fenses," said Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins.
"They'll mix their defenses,

so that's something you al
ways have to be prepared for.
They'll play some man, some
zone, and the kids are very
active."
That said, WSU is in the
midst of an uphill battle, as
the Cougars will carry on
without leading scorer
DaVonte Lacy, who will miss
the next four to six weeks
with an injury. Lacy, at 17.7
points per game, is currently
the only WSU player averag
ing double figures. His ab
sence should make it even
tougher for the already offen
sively challenged Cougars to
score against the Cardinal.
In his absence, guards
Que Johnson and Royce

Wooli'idge and forward D.J.
Shelton will be the WSU
players to keep an eye on.
In contrast to WSU,
Washington (11-6, 3-1) is
healthy and playing some of
its best basketball of the sea
son. After a shaky start, the
Huskies have won seven of
their past nine contests, in
cluding an upset win over No.
21 Colorado on Sunday.
Washington features a high
powered offense led by star
senior guard C.J. Wilcox, an
NBA prospect who is second
in the Pac-12 in scoring at
20.5 points per game.
Freshman Nigel
Williams-Goss, a McDonald's
High School All-American,

and conspicuously named
sophomore guard Andrew
Andrews provide support for
Wilcox in the backcourt,
while University of San Fran
cisco transfer Perris Black
well anchors the interior.
Stanford would be wise to use
its height advantage against
the Huskies: Blackwell is the
only member of the rotation
taller than 6-foot-5.
Tip off at Maples Pavilion
is set for 7 p.m. on Wednes
day night and 8 p.m. on Sat
urday night as the Cardinal
looks to get itself back in the
Pac-12 race.

backcourt duo of Brown and

heavily favored, but the
Cougars have the ability to
create some serious prob
lems should Stanford not be
on its game. WSU plays a
low-possession, low-scoring
brand of basketball that can
be frustrating for opponents
at times, as evidenced by the
Cougars' 49-46 upset victory
over Utah last week.

"They play different de
fenses," said Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins.
"They'll mix their defenses,

so that's something you al
ways have to be prepared for.
They'll play some man, some
zone, and the kids are very
active."
That said, WSU is in the
midst of an uphill battle, as
the Cougars will carry on
without leading scorer
DaVonte Lacy, who will miss
the next four to six weeks
with an injury. Lacy, at 17.7
points per game, is currently
the only WSU player averag
ing double figures. His ab
sence should make it even
tougher for the already offen
sively challenged Cougars to
score against the Cardinal.
In his absence, guards
Que Johnson and Royce

Wooli'idge and forward D.J.
Shelton will be the WSU
players to keep an eye on.
In contrast to WSU,
Washington (11-6, 3-1) is
healthy and playing some of
its best basketball of the sea
son. After a shaky start, the
Huskies have won seven of
their past nine contests, in
cluding an upset win over No.
21 Colorado on Sunday.
Washington features a high
powered offense led by star
senior guard C.J. Wilcox, an
NBA prospect who is second
in the Pac-12 in scoring at
20.5 points per game.
Freshman Nigel

sophomore guard Andrew

Stanford would be wise to use
its height advantage against

After scoring an upset win
on Sunday against then-No. 17
Oregon, the Stanford men's
basketball team finds itself in
an interesting position head
ing into its games against
Washington State and Wash

ington this week at home.
With a sweep, the Cardinal
could put itself not only back
in the thick of the conference
race, but also in the hunt for
an NCAA tournament bid.
With anything less, Stanford
will put itself back in a hole.
The Cardinal (10-5, 1-2
Pac-12) put forth two of its

most incongruous perform
ances of the season last week
on the road in Oregon. Stan
ford suffered an ignominious
81-72 defeat at the hands of
the Oregon State Beavers last
Thursday night in Corvallis,
Ore. its first loss in its past
five meetings against OSU
before gaining some method
of redemption with the win
over the Ducks in Eugene,
Ore.
As has been the case all
season long, junior guard
Chasson Randle was again at
the forefront of Stanford's ef
forts in both victory and de
feat, averaging 26.5 points on
56.3 percent shooting in the
two games last week. Had
Stanford managed to avoid the
disaster in Corvallis, it is like
ly Randle would have picked
up his second Pac-12 Player of
the Week honor of the season.

Cal's Justin Cobbs, whose
