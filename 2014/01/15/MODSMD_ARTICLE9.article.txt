# Home sweep a must
## 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
After scoring an upset win
on Sunday against then-No. 17
Oregon, the Stanford men's
basketball team finds itself in
an interesting position head
ing into its games against
Washington State and Wash

ington this week at home.
With a sweep, the Cardinal
could put itself not only back
in the thick of the conference
race, but also in the hunt for
an NCAA tournament bid.
With anything less, Stanford
will put itself back in a hole.
The Cardinal (10-5, 1-2
Pac-12) put forth two of its

most incongruous perform
ances of the season last week
on the road in Oregon. Stan
ford suffered an ignominious
81-72 defeat at the hands of
the Oregon State Beavers last
Thursday night in Corvallis,
Ore. its first loss in its past
five meetings against OSU
before gaining some method
of redemption with the win
over the Ducks in Eugene,
Ore.
As has been the case all
season long, junior guard
Chasson Randle was again at
the forefront of Stanford's ef
forts in both victory and de
feat, averaging 26.5 points on
56.3 percent shooting in the
two games last week. Had
Stanford managed to avoid the
disaster in Corvallis, it is like
ly Randle would have picked
up his second Pac-12 Player of
the Week honor of the season.
Instead, the award went to
Cal's Justin Cobbs, whose
team swept the Oregon
schools. Randle is now averag
ing 19.5 points per game this
season, which puts him third
in the Pac-12.
No one player's week
summed the team's perform
ances like senior guard An
thony Brown, who struggled
mightily against Oregon
State on Thursday before
bouncing back to score a ca
reer-high 24 points against
Oregon on Sunday. Stanford's
backcourt duo of Brown and
Randle has been one of the
team's strengths all season
long, and if the pair can con
tinue to put up simultaneous
performances like the one
they put together against
Oregon, the Cardinal can be
awfully tough to beat.
Washington State (8-8,1-3)
is the first test for Stanford
this week. Much like the
matchup with Oregon State,
the Cardinal will again be

Senior guard Anthony Brown (center) rebounded from a
tough game against Oregon State to dominate offensively
against Oregon. Combined efforts from Brown and junior
Chasson Randle will be the key to future wins.
