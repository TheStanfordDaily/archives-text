I didn't expect to feel this far from
home in Britain. There are the
immediate differences
women pushing strollers with one
hand and smoking cigarettes in the
another, cars hurtling at you from
what must be the wrong direction, a
weather with a wicked sense of hu
mor and speed bumps referred to as
"humped zebras."
Quirky disparities like these aren't
necessarily unique to Britain; a
week in Paris where everyone gen
erally looks like they just came from
a very chic funeral debunked my
Copernican assumption that the
world revolves entirely around
American values and culture.
But then again, there are far
more interesting blogs dedicated to
these overt and often hilarious dif
ferences between our teenage na
tion and ancient European civiliza
tions. I was actually thinking of
making one after I asked my British
friend whether it was cold enough to
wear pants that day, unaware that in
the U.K., the terms "pants" and
"panties" are one and the same. Yet
somehow, I feel obliged to share the
(marginally) more meaningful as
pects of my study abroad experience
at Oxford University, the intellectu
al hub of the world, even after they
stopped making Harry Potter
movies.
American and British students
take a fundamentally different ap
proach to college, shaped by our re
spective high school systems. As
high school juniors, British students
have to narrow their course load to
three or four "A-Level" subjects,
which limit the majors they can ap
ply for in college and, based on then
final exam scores, which colleges
they can apply to at all.
Whereas a student with a 3.4
high school GPA in the U.S. could
apply to Harvard and pray very in
tently that his or her admissions of
ficer is dyslexic, a student with
merely average A-level scores
would not be allowed to apply to top
colleges in the U.K. Thus, upon en
tering college, the average British
student is already locked into a ma
jor after years of academic funnels;
my own schizophrenic path through
majors would have been snuffed out
before I got to Stanford.
But I never really saw what was
wrong with a more eclectic approach
to college until I turned in my first
paper at Oxford. In classic British
style, my professor stated dryly,
"They call it a 'well-rounded' educa
tion because you spend most of your
time making circles around the dis
ciplines you love rather than simply
studying them."
We (the "American" students)
had each written 10 superb pages
about Margaret Thatcher's legacy,
pulling from modern perspectives,
economics, biographical informa
tion, politics and media culture to
create an excellent expose on the
former Prime Minister.
"I asked you a question," our
professor said disapprovingly after
grading the essays, "and instead of
an answer, I got every piece of infor
mation about Thatcher except for
perhaps the identity of her hair
dresser."
I should point out that said pro
fessor was so relentlessly sarcastic
that I could never actually follow
what he was actually trying to say;
regardless, he had chosen this prime
opportunity to criticize America's
insistence upon providing students
with a broad education. He argued
that what we gained in latitude, we
lost in depth.
Perhaps this had some truth to it.
Indeed, after shrinking in our seats
for a full 30 minutes, we all resolved
to be far more precise in our writing
and absolutely never include the
name of the hairdresser for Tony
Blair, the subject of our next essay.
We didn't receive too much praise
for that one either, although we
were thankfully spared another
tirade about "loosey-goosey" educa
tion.
That's the other thing it
seems as though we've become very
accustomed to praise following our
work here at Stanford, whether it's
a grade, an award or even a pat on
the back from your professor as you
triumphantly exit class.
At Oxford, you'd be lucky to get a
grade at all, much less any kind of
verbal compliment. I found myself
craving some kind of acknowledg
ment that I was doing OK I start
ed observing my professors' facial
movements so intently that I some
how decided that a nose twitch was
bad and an eyebrow raise was good.
To be honest, I think he just had al
lergies.
For a while, I was resentful of

this strange and tiresome way of
getting an education. I was writing
long, inane essays on technical sub
jects that could've been aptly illus
trated with a graph; I was sitting
through lengthy, detailed lectures
on post-war economic strategy,
much of which was spent waiting for
eyebrows to rise, and I was assigned
countless readings that were never,
ever available in e-book format. It
simply wasn't an efficient education.
I think that's the crux of the dif
ference between the education we're
receiving here, on this sun-soaked
campus, and the education that our
peers are receiving across the At
lantic. Scholarly "efficiency" is not
only sub-optimal it's downright
ignored at institutions like Oxford.
And while I'd like to pick a side
and stubbornly argue its merits,
comparing these two systems really
is like comparing apples to oranges
(both of which, I should point out,
are generally unavailable in Britain,
along with most vegetables of the
green variety).
The most I could do was marvel
at how different college life was for
the standard British student. For
example, it was stunning to wander
into a cathedral and realize that it's
actually a library, with spiraling
staircases and walls lined with books
all the way to the ceiling. It's even
more remarkable to see students
reading those books, pen and paper
in hand, studying in minute detail
the first principles of modern logic
or the theme of immortality in
Shakespeare's 18th sonnet.
I couldn't help but admire the
way these students think and learn,
as I sheepishly lugged my Mac√üook
Pro to a corner of the gaping cham
ber and tried my best not to pull up
the Wiki page for Wittgenstein or
Spark Notes the assigned Nietzsche
reading. From Oxford, I re-learned
how to sit, open a book, read it, and
if I was really motivated, use my
own brain to interpret it.
This often resulted in a full day
spent entirely upon dissecting a sin
gle page of text. But I started to re
alize that in the academic world,
there is no opportunity cost, no
Pareto inefficiency.
There's a lot we can learn from
Oxford's example; conversely,
there's just as much my British
friends could take away from a
quarter spent at Stanford.
It's a source of great pride for me
that a Stanford philosophy major
could outline the mechanics of an ac
tion potential while a pre-med stu
dent could just as easily engage in a
conversation about Kant's categori
cal imperative. The computer sci
ence department at Oxford was
about the size of my apartment in
Oak Creek and not nearly as popu
lated on the weekdays, something I
really do consider a shame, consid
ering the massive relevance that CS
has on today's increasingly digital
world.
Oxford University is an institu
tion that prides itself upon tradition
indeed, after attending dinner in
jeans and being seated nearly out
side the dining hall, I began to un
derstand the importance of custom,
not only at Oxford, but also in the
U.K. as a whole.
Yet just as a healthy dose of
modernity is just what Dr. Phil or
dered for the regal and lordly Ox
ford University, there is no doubt in
my mind that we would benefit from
returning to a more traditional form
of education, and at least every now
and then, sitting down, shutting up
and being wholly unafraid to lose a
few hours getting lost in something
we love.
