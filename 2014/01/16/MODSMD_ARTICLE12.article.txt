# GOOSE SYNDROME
## Feminists: To Bey or not to Bey 
### Gustavo Empinotti 
Immediately after my last fall
quarter final, as I came back to
my room and sat down envi
sioning the three weeks of utter re
laxation that awaited me, I heard
the news about Beyonce's new sur
prise midnight album release on
iTunes. So long to my plans of doing
absolutely nothing during the
break: I was morally compelled to
watch all the videos on repeat.
After the initial freakout, an appar
ently natural reaction (the album
became the second best-selling dig
ital album of 2013, having been re
leased three weeks before the end
of the year), fans were filled with
doubts. With a feminist speech by
Nigerian author Chimamanda
Ngozi Adichie in the track "Flaw
less," but also many apparent dis
plays of servitude to her husband
(her latest tour was called "Mrs.
Carter" for God's sake!), is Beyon
ce's music feminist or the complete
opposite?
To give a little background to
anyone who hasn't examined her al
bum in depth (seriously?), the
videos are full of oversexualized
women (herself included, of course)
and lines such as "I cooked this
meal for you naked" ("Jealous") and
"I just wanna be the girl you like"

("Partition").
None of this is exactly new to
Beyonce (remember "Naughty
Girl"?). She has certainly gotten a
fair amount of criticism for being
"anti-feminist" before. I'm not go
ing to claim that Beyonce is the
deepest artist of the 21st century,
but I don't think it is overreading to
say that she is not so shallow as to
release an album that claims to
champion feminism yet oversexual
izes women at the same time with
out thinking about the potential
contradiction. For exactly that rea
son, I think her new album is a re
sponse to feminist criticism.
The idea is that she embraces
the perfect wife stereotype because
she wants to (and also only when
she wants to, as shown in the lyrics
of "Flawless"). She is not telling
anyone else they have to do the
same. What allows Beyonce to be a
feminist is the difference between
rights and duties, obligation and
free will. She sings about her right
to be "the girl he likes," a right she
has found herself forced to defend
due to what feminism has largely
become, but never does she phrase
that as a duty of all women. The al
bum is about Beyonce (isn't that the
title?), not about all women.

The analogous is true for any
stereotype. It is wrong and often of
fensive to claim that everyone from
a certain group adheres or should
adhere to a given stereotype. But it
is not wrong for an individual of that
group to comply to the stereotype
because he or she happens to be
that way and enjoys it.
While her album can on one side
be seen as a response to feminist
critique, it also has parts that are
themselves feminist. Some will
think that the overt sexuality objec
tifies women, which I think is the
case with some artists, but in this
case it means she can be sexual and
still defend gender equality (look
out for the French passage in "Par
tition").
I've witnessed many discussions
in which girls were annoyed with
what they perceived to be feminism
today. They felt attacked by it be
cause they enjoyed their occasional
nail-painting or shopping sessions.
Feminism is important in order to
allow girls to deviate from that
(and boys to jump in), but it is
equally important that it does not
force anyone to.
