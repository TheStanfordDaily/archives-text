# Overcoming "Maples Malaise"

Before Stanford thrashed
Washington State last
night, I was up and ready
to write an article about
the "malaise" of the Stan
ford men's basketball program. I was
more than ready, in fact.
Although one game doesn't make
a season or a career, I still would have
felt a little strange if I'd criticized the
program with such a blowout so fresh
in my mind. There are, of course, still
veiy good reasons to criticize the
team. Stanford's performance has not
been commensurate with its aspira
tions — it hasn't made the NCAA
toumey in the last five years after go
ing dancing in 15 out of the previous
16. And to a certain extent, Stanford's
fan support has mirrored that per
formance.
We already know the sad tale of
"Maples Malaise" attendance has
nosedived, even in the formerly rau
cous student section. I personally
heard the building get loud during the
big win against Oregon last year, but
when Stanford hosted the first round
of the NIT not the greatest post
season tourney, but the postseason
nonetheless the crowd was as mut
ed as ever.
When the game started, it didn't
look like anything had changed. A rule
of thumb among cameramen is that
the tighter and closer the shot, the
worse the turnout —and watching on
television, at times the video feed was
so confined I could barely see the
crowd at all. The upper tier of the
stands was, as usual, nearly empty.
Even attendance in the lower tier was
spotty. I've seen worse nights at
Maples, but this certainly wasn't any
thing to write home about.
The team, however, played ex
tremely well last night. In retrospect,
the Cardinal's smooth first possession
on offense was a very auspicious sign.
Stanford moved the ball wonderfully
its players knew where they were
supposed to be, moved off-ball to
stretch the defense and passed inside
and outside with both accuracy and
confidence. Even though effort and
execution were not initially rewarded
with success, Stanford opened up a
big lead in the closing minutes of the
first half and blew the game open to
begin the second.
There were plenty of good plays,
and I will focus on just one. Although
Dwight Powell's huge dunk was a vic
tory celebration in and of itself, Pow
ell's beautiful pass to a cutting Chas
son Randle was the best play of the
game and one of the best plays I've
seen all year on any level. Even
though Randle failed to score and had
to reset the play, execution like that
leads to wins. One play mirrored the
entire game. Similarly, Johnny
Dawkins would certainly like to see
this game as a microcosm of the pro
gram over which he presides.
To be honest, pretty much eveiy
coach thinks that he's on the way up.
Even after three difficult years at
Michigan, Rich Rodriguez was pro
claiming that his reinvention of the
Michigan football program was on the
verge of greatness. And ironically, the
year after Rodriguez was fired, the
Wolverines rode a senior-laden team
to the Sugar Bowl. The example of
Michigan is a sign of hope to many
coaches who dream of changing a pro
gram for the better.
In football, a Sugar Bowl means a
successful season. What, though, con
stitutes success for Stanford? Does
beating Washington State once consti
tute success? Does making the NCAA
tournament constitute success? Or
what about the toumey once in six
years? Does making the Sweet Six
teen constitute success, or the Final
Four or the national championship
game? What are we prepared to ac
cept? I don't know, and it's different
for every person. But the empty seats
in Maples indicate that what is going
on right now, despite last night's win,
is unacceptable. As the season pro
gresses, we will see whether Stanford
can put up a season that is, in fact, ac
ceptable.
If Johnny Dawkins can keep Stan
ford playing like it did last night, he'll
have had a successful season. And
consider the context for a moment.
Stanford made one NCAA tourna
ment in its entire history the na
tional championship run in 1942
before Mike Montgomery took over
and revived its fortunes. That is a fact
words cannot wipe away. But today's
recruits do not remember that time.
They grew up when Stanford was still
in the mix for conference champi
onships. They know that Stanford is a
good program that is capable of so
