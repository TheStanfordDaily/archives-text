# COUGARS CRUSHED
## HUESTIS POWERS STANFORD IN ROUT 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
For the first 16 minutes of the game, it
looked like the same old Stanford men's basket
ball team. A lesser opponent was hanging
around with the Cardinal when it had no busi
ness doing so. With about four minutes left to
play in the half and the score tied at 27, that all
changed. The bench made contributions. The
Cardinal didn't allow any second-chance points.
Turnovers were limited. The zone defense was
tight. A 13-2 run to end the half ensued, and
Stanford never looked back.

The Cardinal (11-5, 2-2 Pac-12) defeated the
Washington State Cougars (8-9, 1-4) 80-48 on
Wednesday night, its second consecutive con
ference victory after dropping the first two
games of its Pac-12 slate. The 32-point margin
of victory tied Stanford's best effort this season,
when the Cardinal dismantled South Dakota
State 92-60 on Dec. 1. It was a complete team
performance from start to finish, with seven dif
ferent players tallying at least six points apiece.
Senior forwards Josh Huestis sporting a
new haircut and Dwight Powell led the way
for the Cardinal, thrilling the crowd with one vi
cious put-back dunk after another. Huestis fin
ished with 15 points, five rebounds and two as
sists, while Powell added 10 points, eight re
bounds and five assists in the win. After the
game, Huestis attributed his first double-digit
scoring effort of the conference season to the
new look.
"The past few games I have been struggling,
putting too much pressure on myself and just
trying to find my place, but I cut my hair just to
signal a new mindset and a new beginning,"
Huestis said. "It looked like it worked."
Senior guard Anthony Brown, whose similar
style to that of Huestis confused many coaches
in practice today, also chipped in offensively,
adding 15 points on 5-of-7 shooting. Freshman
guard Marcus Allen also chipped in 11 points,
the first double-digit scoring effort of his Stan
ford career.
Que Johnson had 21 points in the defeat for
the Cougars, who were clearly undermanned
without the services of injured star player and
leading scorer DaVonte Lacy. After a strong
first half in which Johnson scored 15 points on
6-of-7 shooting, he was held to just six points on
2-of-8 shooting in the second half. Lacy's back
court mate Royce Woolridge was the only other
Cougar to reach double figures with 13 points.
"Without Lacy in the game he's a terrific
scorer we try to turn our attention to the
other scorers, Que Johnson being one of them
and Kernich-Drew being another one," said
Stanford head coach Johnny Dawkins. "We re
ally just wanted to slow those guys down and
maybe get them off their rhythm a little bit. I

think we were able to do that in spot moments
tonight."
Stanford marched its way to victory behind
stifling defense and dominance on the interior.
The Cardinal held the Cougars to just 37 per
cent shooting for the game, including just 29.6
percent in the second half, while manhandling
WSU inside. Stanford out-rebounded the visi
tors 37-23 and outscored them 34-12 in the
paint.
The other notable aspect of Stanford's
blowout victory in addition to the team's
strong defense and interior play was the con
tributions of the bench. Saddled by injuries to
four experienced players who were supposed to
be key components of the rotation, the Cardinal
has struggled to receive any sort of meaningful
contributions from its bench this season.
Wednesday night was a different story, as
the Stanford reserves exploded for 28 points

behind the strong play of Allen and senior
guard Robbie Lemons, who sparked Stanford's
run in the first half.
Despite the lopsided final score, the short
handed Cougars hung tough with the Cardinal
for the first 15:46 of the game, as the score was
tied at 27 apiece after a Dexter Kernich-Drew
3-pointer with 4:14 left in the half. Free throws
by Powell, a three by Brown, two threes by
Lemons and a layup by senior Chasson Randle
before the buzzer gave Stanford an 11-point
lead and clear momentum heading into the sec
ond half, neither of which the Cardinal would
relinquish.
The Cardinal will now turn its attention to
the Washington Huskies on Saturday in what
should be a stiffer test. Tipoff is at 8 p.m.
