# Cardinal hits the road for Arizona trio
## Desert duel awaits at No. 19 ASU 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Heading into Arizona for anoth
er road trip after two road wins last
weekend, the No. 4 Stanford Cardi
nal (15-1, 4-0 Pac-12) boasts two
players that are receiving lots of
recognition for their prowess on the
court. Senior forward Chiney Ogwu
mike was named Pac-12 Player of the
Week for the sixth time this season,
while junior guard Amber Orrange
was named to the watch list for the
Lieberman Award, awarded to the
best point guard in the nation.
The two-man play between Og
wumike (27.3 points per game, 11.8
rebounds per game) and Orrange
(10.4 ppg, 4.6 assists per game) last
week at Utah and Colorado led to
open shots for Orrange and easy
piek-and-roll opportunities for Og
wumike. This was very much the
same strategy that the team used for
offensive efficiency at the end of last
season. The difference this year is
that the duo has had help from all po
sitions and class years.
In last Friday's game against
Utah, fifth-year senior forward
Mikaela Ruef had the most complete
game of anyone on the roster with
eight points, 14 rebounds, two assists
and two steals. On Saturday against
Colorado, freshman guard Karlie
Samuelson lit it up from the 3-point
line, going 5-for-8 from behind the
arc and 4-for-4 from the free throw
line to finish with a career-high 19
points. She also finished with two
steals.
Offensively, the Card was just as
efficient against both Utah and Col
orado, scoring 87 points in each con
test. The difference in win margins in
those two games beating Utah by
26 but allowing Colorado to finish
within 10 can be attributed to

careless ball handling down the
stretch in Boulder.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer's
dissatisfaction with the team's han
dling of the Buffaloes' full-court
press in the final minutes of the
game was evident. The Card record
ed 18 turnovers in the narrow win,
almost six more than it tends to aver
age.
Taking care of the ball will be im
portant in Monday's game against
No. 19 Arizona State (14-2,3-1). ASU
has won three consecutive Pac-12
matchups since starting conference
play after a surprising loss to Wash
ington State. The Sun Devils know
how to win close games in the end, as
they are 6-0 in games determined by
five points or less and games that go
to overtime.
They are led by fifth-year senior
guard Deja Mann, who averages 11.6
ppg, and freshman forward Kelsey
Moos, who has scored 9.1 ppg with 6
rpg. While the Sun Devils don't have
any outstanding scorers, six other
players average more than five
points per game, so them scoring is
well distributed.
Before dueling Arizona State, the
Card will first need to take care of
business against the Arizona Wild
cats (4-11,0-4). Arizona finished non
conference play on a three-game
winning streak but has yet to
record a Pac-12 win, sitting at the
bottom of the conference along with
Utah and Oregon. Redshirt junior
guard Candice Warthen (13 ppg, 3
apg) and senior guard Kama Grif
fitts (10.3 ppg, 4.4 rpg) lead the
Wildcats on the court.
The Card has not dropped a
game to Arizona since a close loss at
Tuscon in 2004 and will look to ex
tend that streak against the worst
team in the conference.
Tipoff in Tucson against Arizona
is set for 6 p.m. on Friday. Game
time at Arizona State is set for 4
p.m. on Monday.
