## Flu Crew to offer more vaccines Medical students respond to growing public concerns 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Reports of flu-related deaths,
including four in Santa Clara
County in the last month, led
Vaden Health Center to host an
emergency flu vaccination clinic
on Monday.
Growing public concern over
influenza also prompted the Stan
ford Flu Crew a student organ
ization dedicated to providing
low-cost vaccines to target popu
lations to coordinate two extra
drop-in clinics later this month.
On Jan. 10 the Santa Clara
County Health Department re
ported the deaths of a 41-year-old
woman and a 61-year-old man
from HINI within a month. On
Tuesday, the county health de
partment reported two additional
HINI-related deaths: those of a
62-year-old and 61-year-old.
"What we are noticing differ
ent this flu season, as compared to
last season, is that it seems earli
er in the season, we're seeing
more severe cases and more
deaths this year," said Amy Cor
nell, the county's health informa
tion officer.
To date, there have been 13 re
ported cases of severe flu, or indi
viduals under the age of 65 who
have required hospitalization in
the ICU due to the flu this flu sea
son, Cornell said. For point of
comparison, nine severe flu cases
were reported during the entire
course of the last flu season, a pe
riod of time that generally lasts
from October to April.
"The flu season is very unpre
dictable," Cornell said. "It's hard
to say what will happen from year
to year or even what will hap
pen in the season this year."
Ira Friedman, director of the
health center, said that despite
media attention on local influen-
za-related deaths, most
members of the Stanford
community shouldn't be too
worried about fatalities.
"[Death] always goes
along with a bigger number
of influenza cases," Fried
man said. "The main con
cern should be to avoid in
fection, and the vaccine is
really the best and most ef
fective way to do it."
Media attention actually
ended up serving an impor
tant role in this regard,
Friedman said. It galva
nized members of the Stan
ford community on Monday
to visit Vaden and receive
their free flu shot a med
ical decision he recom
mends everyone still un
vaccinated and in good
health to make.
Throughout fall quarter,
Vaden hosted 14 vaccina
tion clinics, including eight
at its own center and six in
campus dining halls in con
junction with Stanford Flu
Crew.
During winter break,
Vaden made the decision to
host the additional Jan.l 3
drop-in clinic, Friedman
said.
"The clinic was added
on because we felt there
would be a demand given
all that's been going on in
the media," he said.
Due to the increased
student demand the Stan
ford Flu Crew will be hold
ing two additional drop-in
clinics this month, accord
ing to Yu-Jin Lee 'll M.D.
'l7, a medical student di
rector of the Flu Crew. The
first clinic will be held on
Jan. 22 at Arrillaga Dining
Hall. The second is pro
posed for Jan. 29 with the
location pending.
Lee said there are likely
two reasons for the in
creased demand for vac
cines this flu season.
"One of the main rea
sons is because of the me
dia attention," Lee said.
"Another possible reason is

that if people see their
peers around them getting
sick and think that the flu
vaccine could prevent them
from getting sick, then that
could also increase de
mand."
Friedman recommended
Stanford community mem
bers also take additional
preventative habits.
"When we counsel peo
ple about preventative
habits, we talk about the
normal things we are wor
ried about: sleep, stress,
nutrition and moderate ex
ercise," Friedman said.
"We also always say that
people should be covering
their coughs and staying
away from sharing water
bottles, utensils and per
sonal items like lip gloss."
Beyond drop-in clinics,
students and employees can
also call and schedule indi
vidual appointments to re
ceive the flu vaccine at ei
ther Vaden or the Stanford
University Occupational
Health Center, respectively.
