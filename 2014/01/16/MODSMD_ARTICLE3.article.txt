### CLARISSE PERALTA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the first time, a three-week
leadership program will be offered
to incoming juniors, in line with es
tablished freshman and sophomore
programs in September such as
Arts Intensive.
The new Leadership Intensive
program set to run from Sept. 1
to 19 is geared towards develop
ing broad leadership skills in small
seminars that draw expertise from
faculty across campus. Advising
from the program is intended to
continue into students' junior and
senior years, and 10 grants will be
awarded to participants who wish
to work on a project in the academ
ic school year or the following sum
mer.
"We have a good, rich pile of
programs for freshmen and sopho

mores," said Lisa Bilgen, associate
director of the new program. "We
wanted to really focus on the jun
iors and seniors, and this is one of
those initiatives for them."
Both Bilgen and Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) Harry Elam have been
working on creating the program
for more than a year, reaching out
to faculty from all three under
graduate schools, as well as the
professional schools law, busi
ness, medicine and education.
"It's been talked about for so
long at Stanford, and President
Hennessy is constantly saying,
'We're preparing tomorrow's lead
ers,' so we keep saying, 'We need to
do something actually concrete,"'
Bilgen said. "We do that in so many
ways, but we wanted to do an actu
al program that addressed it head
on."

Bilgen added that she and Elam
have been meeting with faculty
who will be teaching the Septem
ber program, giving them advice
on what should be included in the
Leadership Intensive curriculum.
"Tons of faculty were so recep
tive and so excited about offering

this to undergraduates," Bilgen
said. "They've all lent their sup
port in participating."
One of these professors in
cludes A1 Camarillo, professor of
history, who will also serve as the
program's faculty director.
"I'm most excited about stu
dents engaging in the multifaceted
understanding of leadership," he
said.
Thomas Freeland, a lecturer in
the Oral Communication Program
in Writing and Rhetoric, shared
the same sentiment.
"It's always exciting to be work
ing with students who are so
strongly engaged with important
issues and finding ways to connect
with the audience to share that
passion and commitment," Free
land said.
According to Freeland, students
would be working on oral commu
nication programs throughout the
course of Leadership Intensive.
Moreover, students who partici
pate in the program will have the
opportunity to work with faculty
