## Internationals recruit for Stanford overseas 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An auditorium full of Korean
high school juniors and seniors lis
tened as a school alumnus, Joon
Kee Park 'l7, offered a presenta
tion about his first quarter at Stan
ford about freshman dormitory
life, the difficulties of waking up
any time before 10 in the morning
and meeting many brilliant class
mates.
Park, like most students, re
turned home for winter break.
However, Park had work to do
through Admissions Ambassa
dors, a program the Office of Un
dergraduate Admission piloted
this school year.
Before the break international

students were trained to act as
ambassadors for Stanford while
they spent their holidays back
home. The program, named Ad
missions Ambassadors, was
formed in order to further Stan
ford's reach among international
students, connecting international
high school students directly with
student alumni.
The new program is similar to
the existing domestic equivalent,
the Going Home Program,
through which volunteering stu
dents return to their former high
schools in the United States.
According to Theresa Bruket
ta, associate director of admission
and international outreach, 40 stu
dents representing 18 countries
including Macedonia, Vietnam, Ja

maica and Saudi Arabia partici
pated in the program's inaugural
run.
Bruketta hopes that this pro
gram may convince more high
school students to pursue a college
degree outside of their native

country.
"For many students applying to
Stanford from overseas it is not
possible to visit our campus or
meet someone from our communi

and connect them directly with Stanford student representatives.
