## Internationals recruit for Stanford overseas 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An auditorium full of Korean
high school juniors and seniors lis
tened as a school alumnus, Joon
Kee Park 'l7, offered a presenta
tion about his first quarter at Stan
ford about freshman dormitory
life, the difficulties of waking up
any time before 10 in the morning
and meeting many brilliant class
mates.
Park, like most students, re
turned home for winter break.
However, Park had work to do
through Admissions Ambassa
dors, a program the Office of Un
dergraduate Admission piloted
this school year.
Before the break international

students were trained to act as
ambassadors for Stanford while
they spent their holidays back
home. The program, named Ad
missions Ambassadors, was
formed in order to further Stan
ford's reach among international
students, connecting international
high school students directly with
student alumni.
The new program is similar to
the existing domestic equivalent,
the Going Home Program,
through which volunteering stu
dents return to their former high
schools in the United States.
According to Theresa Bruket
ta, associate director of admission
and international outreach, 40 stu
dents representing 18 countries
including Macedonia, Vietnam, Ja

maica and Saudi Arabia partici
pated in the program's inaugural
run.
Bruketta hopes that this pro
gram may convince more high
school students to pursue a college
degree outside of their native

country.
"For many students applying to
Stanford from overseas it is not
possible to visit our campus or
meet someone from our communi

ty before they apply," Bruketta
said. "For some, even after they are
admitted, they will not even have
the opportunity to set foot on our
campus until orientation."
Park echoed this sentiment, say
ing that he believed he made an im
pact on the high school students he
spoke to.
"Maybe not the people applying
right now but I know the wave after
came and told me 'Maybe I'll apply
now,"' he said, of potential appli
cants from his school.
Park also expressed that this
program would have been helpful
while he was applying.
"It would have been nice to get a
better feel of the school from some
one who works or has been there
rather than the Internet," Park
said.
Any student who attends school
outside of the United States re

gardless of citizenship status is
able to become an ambassador, ac
cording to Andres Gutierrez 'l4, ad
mission associate who was part of
the recruiting effort for the Ambas
sadors program.
Park himself first became inter
ested after his admission officer en
couraged him to apply to help reach
out in his native South Korea.
"I first found out about it when I
introduced myself to the admis
sions officer because I couldn't
come to Admit Weekend because I
was international," Park said.
After fall quarter, Park returned
to his high school in Seoul and con
tacted his school's principal to ask if
he could present his 30-minute
PowerPoint on campus life. The
well-attended talk was followed by
a free question-and-answer period.
"They asked if it was more diffi
cult than high school, they asked
about things like time management,
parties, fun opportunities and how I
think it's different from other
schools I didn't choose," Park said.
Park had organized his visit and
structured his presentation follow

ing training from the Admission Of
fice. In addition to guidelines for his
presentation, he received a stack of
pamphlets for his return home and
was encouraged to answer ques
tions about his experience at college
as opposed to admissions informa
tion.
"The Ambassador Program
does not aim to provide specific de
tails about Stanford's selection
process or to provide advice about
how to gain admission but rather
focuses on the Stanford experi
ence," Bruketta said.
Currently, the Admission Office
is compiling reflections from the
ambassadors about their experi
ences to guide the program better
next year.
"I am working with Theresa on
gathering feedback from the am
bassadors on their visits so that we
can ensure that it was helpful and
learn how to develop the program
for future iterations," Gutierrez
said.
