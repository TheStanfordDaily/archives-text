Chad La Tburette is five
laps away from mak
ing the Olympics.
It's the 1,500-meter
freestyle finals on
the last day of the 2012 U.S.
Olympic Trials in Omaha, Neb.,
where the nation's top 2,000
swimmers have gathered to com
pete for just a handful of spots
on the U.S. Olympic team.
A recent Stanford graduate,
La Tourette has logged lap after
lap usually at the rate of
16,000 meters per day to pre
pare for the most important race
of his life. Stanford is a factory

where Olympians are mass-pro
duced every four years: Cardi
nal-affiliated athletes have col
lected a total of 224 medals in
Olympic history, and if Stanford
were its own country, it would be
ranked 24th in the all-time
Olympic medal standings, ahead
of Spain, Greece and Mexico.
Failure is rarely associated
with Stanford athletics.
Four years earlier at the 2008
Trials, La Tourette finished third
in the same event in the same
pool. At almost every other
meet, a swimmer is given a
bronze medal if he finishes third,
but because only the top two fin
ishers in each event qualify for
the Olympics, coming in third at
the Trials is a swimmer's worst

nightmare.
It was a setback for La
Tourette at first, but since then
he has won six medals at major
international competitions, bro
ken an American record and
claimed an NCAA title and two
runner-up finishes. He came into
the Trials as the owner of the na
tion's fastest time in the 30-lap
race.
His journey to the 2012 Trials
should serve as a tale of redemp
tion, a tale of a veteran swimmer
finally fulfilling his ultimate
dream after coming tantalizingly
short four years ago. Stanford is
a breeding ground for Olympic
success, and there is no reason to
think that La Tourette won't join
the hundreds of Stanford

Olympians who have come be
fore him.
But he won't. La Tourette has
led the field for the first 12 min
utes of the race, but in the next
three, his dream turns into a
nightmare the very same one
he lived in 2008.
La Tourette climbs out of the
pool, a third-place finisher once
again. The first person he finds
is Bill Rose, his coach.
"It was the worst thing that's
ever happened to me in my 45
years of coaching," Rose will lat
er remember. La Tourette will
have trouble forgetting, too.
For now, all he does is stare at
his coach.

his coach.

Unlike most record-set
ting athletes, La Tourette
wasn't born with great phys
ical talent.
He first started swim
ming as an 8-year-old when
he joined the Mission Viejo
Nadadores, one of the
largest and most acclaimed
swimming clubs in the coun
try. But La Tourette didn't
post eye-popping times early
on as an age-group swimmer.
Nor was there any other in
dication that he would be
come one of the best swim
mers to ever come out of
Mission Viejo, the only club
team that he trained with un
til 2012.
It wasn't until La Tourette
was 13 years old that he
caught the attention of Rose,
the longtime head coach of
Mission Viejo and a member
of the American Swim
Coaches Hall of Fame. Rose
was impressed by La
Tourette's attitude and ap
proach to his races at a local
summer meet, and six
months later, La Tourette be
gan training with the group
of swimmers directly
coached by Rose, an honor
reserved for the top swim
mers at Mission Viejo.
"Chad was a late
bloomer," Rose said.
"Through his age group, he
was just kind of a normal
swimmer, and he matured
physically very late."
But when La Tourette did
finally bloom, his ceiling only
kept on rising. Two years af
ter Rose took him under his
wing, he qualified for his first
national meet the 2005
World Championship Trials
in Indianapolis. Rose ex
pected the meet to serve as a
good learning experience for
La Tourette, but the 16-year
old swimmer surpassed his
coach's expectations by qual
ifying for the final heat of the
1,500 and breaking his per
sonal record in the event by
nearly 40 seconds.
"That was the start of
everything," Rose said.
Despite La Tourette's
rapid time drops, he and his
family didn't treat swimming
as life or death. Rose remem
bers having a conversation
with Chad's father, Ken La
Tourette, after the Indi
anapolis meet that signaled
to Rose that the family was a
bit naive about La Tourette's
potential. It was a typical
parent-to-coach conversation
that often drives swim coach
es crazy, Rose laughed.
"We're going on vaca
tion in the summer, and
Chad will be gone for
three weeks, if that's
okay," Rose remembers
Chad's father saying.
"No, that's not okay
not if he's going to be
fighting for an interna
tional [meet] spot," Rose
told him.
"Well, we're going to be
in London and they have
hotel pools there, so I'm
sure he can swim back
and forth," Ken said.
In the end, the La
Tourette family took its an
nual summer trip, and La
Tourette still posted decent
times at the summer nation
al meet despite having been
on vacation just a few weeks
earlier.
LaTourette would even
tually grow to be 5-foot-11,
short when compared to the
towering heights of some of
the top distance swimmers
in recent history many,
such as 1,500-meter world
record holder Sun Yang, are
6-foot-4 to 6-foot-6. But La
Tourette didn't let his physi
cal limitations impede his
progress towards becoming
one of the best distance
swimmers in the country.
"What he didn't have in
size and innate athleticism,
he made up in heart," Rose
said. "Chad never backed
down in a race. Chad never
backed out of anything. He
was very strong mentally,
and he was also one of the
top three or four most hard
working swimmers I've ever
coached."
"I wasn't born with a
Michael Phelps build," La
Tourette said of the 22-time
Olympic medalist. "But I
was tough. When you have
the physical toughness as
well as the mental game to
back it up, you can take
yourself really far in this
sport, especially in distance
swimming."
♦ ♦♦
La Tourette entered the
2008 Olympic Trials as the
fourth seed. The 19-year-old

finished second in the pre
liminary session and was by
far the youngest swimmer
among the competitors in the
finals race who had a realistic
chance of qualifying for the
Olympics. Big meets weren't
new for La Tourette despite
his young age. Not only did
he come into the Trials with
multiple national champi
onship meets under his belt,
but he also had a fair share of
experience in international
competitions, including win
ning two individual gold
medals at the 2007 World
University Games and plac
ing fourth in the 5K open-wa
ter race at the 2008 Open
Water World Champi
onships.
But as both La Tourette
and Rose acknowledged, the
intense and high-pressure
atmosphere of the Trials is
unlike that of any other com
petition in swimming.
"I definitely brought a
deer-in-the-headlights ele
ment to the 2008 Trials," La
Tourette said. "In some re
gards, I was pretty fazed by
the difference that the Trials
brings in terms of the level of
energy and also just how
much different it is from oth
er swim meets, including top
level international swim
meets."
The high level of anxiety
that athletes feel at the
Olympic Trials extends be
yond swimming. Stanford
diving head coach Rick
Schavone, a four-time NCAA
Coach of the Year who has
coached diving for over 40
years, believes that the
Olympic Trials for divers is
harder than the actual
Olympic Games.
"Because we have so
much depth in this country
and so much pressure to
make the team, the Trials is
the toughest meet my ath
letes go through," Schavone
said.
"The Olympic Trials is a
mental game," Rose added.
"And that's why so many
swimmers get beat."
However, La Tourette
fared well mentally. Rose
game-planned La Tourette's
1,500-meter race with the
goal of beating Erik Vendt,
who was the top seed in the
finals and also had the
fastest time in the 1,500 in
the world so far that year.
The coach felt that La
Tourette would most likely
finish in the top two and
qualify for the Olympics if he
could beat who they thought
was by far the most impres
sive swimmer in the 1,500
coming into the Trials. La
Tourette swam the race ex
actly as Rose drew it up. Not
only did La Tourette beat
Yendt, but he also set a per
sonal record by breaking the
15-minute barrier.
The only problem was
that two other swimmers
Peter Vandei'kaay and
Larsen Jensen beat
Vendt by even more and fin
ished ahead of La Tourette
by a comfortable margin.
"Chad swam a great
race," Rose said. "He did
what he was asked to do, but
it was just in the cards that
he didn't make it. Bottom
line is, odd man out at third.
That was a very, very men
tally taxing thing for both of
us probably more for me
than him."
The result was indeed
disappointing for La
Tourette, but he bounced
back quickly for an athlete
who had just missed the
Olympics by one spot. With
four years at Stanford to
look forward to, it took him
only one week to reset men
tally.
"I didn't really give my
self time to be discouraged
by the result because I was
about to embark on a new
chapter in college," La
Tourette said. "And that was
a very good prospect to have
in terms of not letting myself
be too down about it and be
ing able to look forward to a
new beginning at Stanford."
♦ ♦♦
In his time on the Farm,
La Tourette became the best
distance swimmer in Stan
ford history. He won the
NCAA title in the 1,650-yard
freestyle as a sophomore,
and though he finished sec
ond at the NCAAs in his jun
ior and senior seasons, he
continued to drop time until
he broke the American
record in the 1,650 at his last
NCAAs in 2012. La Tourette
ended his decorated college
career as an eight-time Ail-
American and five-time con
ference champion.
After every college sea
son, La Tourette returned to
Mission Viejo for the sum
mer to train with Rose, his
longtime club coach. The
transition always proved to

be seamless. He grabbed
one gold and two silvers at
the World University Games
in the 2009 summer season,
won his first national title in
the 1,500-meter in the sum
mer of 2010 and recorded a
top-five finish in the 1,500 at
the World Championships in
the summer of 2011. Given
all the success that La
Tourette had training under
Rose since he was 13, it was
a forgone conclusion that he
would go back to Mission
Viejo to train in the four
months between the NCAAs
and the Olympic Trials.
"I knew there would be a
more committed atmosphere
at Mission Viejo," La
Tourette said. "It was also
nice to be able to live at home
while training, and have that
as a support channel."
But for the first time,
things didn't go smoothly for
La Tourette back at home.
Looking back, La
Tourette felt that he over
trained and added too many
wrinkles into his training
regimen. Right after a big
meet such as the NCAAs, a
coach will generally increase
the intensity and yardage of
a swimmer's workouts to
prepare him for the next im
portant meet. But there is al
so a delicate balance be
tween getting out of shape
and training too hard, and
La Tourette believes that a
23-year-old male swimmer
such as himself doesn't lose
his training base that easily.
"The science says it takes
actually quite a long time for
the aerobic base to go away,
like on the order of 10 weeks
or so." La Tourette said. "I
think any perception of a
loss of base is more psycho
logical than physical... And
when you overtrain, it's very
easy to forget details. So
when you're tired mentally
and physically, you're letting
your form degrade in prac
tice or not worrying about
turns and starts as much."
"I made it tougher than it
should have been," he added.
"Four months actually isn't
that long an amount of time
physiologically to introduce
new training aspects."
Like many elite swim
mers, La Tourette also went
to Colorado Springs, Colo.,
for altitude training camp.
Altitude training can help in
crease a swimmer's per
formance by enlarging his or
her blood cells, but the bene
fits are temporary. La
Tourette believes that he
mistimed the training trip by
going too early, and as a re
sult, he was not able to reap
the full benefits of altitude
camp.
"I don't know, I really
don't know," said Rose, when
asked if he thought La
Tourette's altitude training
was mistimed. "Ever since
2012, I've been asking my
self questions and coming up
with different answers all
along. I can't tell you if that
was good, bad or in be
tween."
La Tourette also feels
that the length of his taper
was too short. All of his suc
cessful tapers have been
around three weeks, said La
Tourette, but he didn't start
decreasing his training load
until a week and a half before
the Trials. He blamed his
coach for not sticking to the
same workout routine that
led to success in the three
earlier summers.
"Everyone was wonder
ing why we started taper so
late," La Tourette said. "I
found myself going into the
coach's office being like,
'Why was today's workout so
long? What was today's
workout so hard?"'
Rose said he doesn't re
member having that conver
sation.

Chad La Tburette is five
laps away from mak
ing the Olympics.
It's the 1,500-meter
freestyle finals on
the last day of the 2012 U.S.
Olympic Trials in Omaha, Neb.,
where the nation's top 2,000
swimmers have gathered to com
pete for just a handful of spots
on the U.S. Olympic team.
A recent Stanford graduate,
La Tourette has logged lap after
lap usually at the rate of
16,000 meters per day to pre
pare for the most important race
of his life. Stanford is a factory

where Olympians are mass-pro
duced every four years: Cardi
nal-affiliated athletes have col
lected a total of 224 medals in
Olympic history, and if Stanford
were its own country, it would be
ranked 24th in the all-time
Olympic medal standings, ahead
of Spain, Greece and Mexico.
Failure is rarely associated
with Stanford athletics.
Four years earlier at the 2008
Trials, La Tourette finished third
in the same event in the same
pool. At almost every other
meet, a swimmer is given a
bronze medal if he finishes third,
but because only the top two fin
ishers in each event qualify for
the Olympics, coming in third at
the Trials is a swimmer's worst

nightmare.
It was a setback for La
Tourette at first, but since then
he has won six medals at major
international competitions, bro
ken an American record and
claimed an NCAA title and two
runner-up finishes. He came into
the Trials as the owner of the na
tion's fastest time in the 30-lap
race.
His journey to the 2012 Trials
should serve as a tale of redemp
tion, a tale of a veteran swimmer
finally fulfilling his ultimate
dream after coming tantalizingly
short four years ago. Stanford is
a breeding ground for Olympic
success, and there is no reason to
think that La Tourette won't join
the hundreds of Stanford

Olympians who have come be
fore him.
But he won't. La Tourette has
led the field for the first 12 min
utes of the race, but in the next
three, his dream turns into a
nightmare the very same one
he lived in 2008.
La Tourette climbs out of the
pool, a third-place finisher once
again. The first person he finds
is Bill Rose, his coach.
"It was the worst thing that's
ever happened to me in my 45
years of coaching," Rose will lat
er remember. La Tourette will
have trouble forgetting, too.
For now, all he does is stare at
his coach.

his coach.

Unlike most record-set
ting athletes, La Tourette
wasn't born with great phys
ical talent.
He first started swim
ming as an 8-year-old when
he joined the Mission Viejo
Nadadores, one of the
largest and most acclaimed
swimming clubs in the coun
try. But La Tourette didn't
post eye-popping times early
on as an age-group swimmer.
Nor was there any other in
dication that he would be
come one of the best swim
mers to ever come out of
Mission Viejo, the only club
team that he trained with un
til 2012.
It wasn't until La Tourette
was 13 years old that he
caught the attention of Rose,
the longtime head coach of
Mission Viejo and a member
of the American Swim
Coaches Hall of Fame. Rose
was impressed by La
Tourette's attitude and ap
proach to his races at a local
summer meet, and six
months later, La Tourette be
gan training with the group
of swimmers directly
coached by Rose, an honor
reserved for the top swim
mers at Mission Viejo.
"Chad was a late
bloomer," Rose said.
"Through his age group, he
was just kind of a normal
swimmer, and he matured
physically very late."
But when La Tourette did
finally bloom, his ceiling only
kept on rising. Two years af
ter Rose took him under his
wing, he qualified for his first
national meet the 2005
World Championship Trials
in Indianapolis. Rose ex
pected the meet to serve as a
good learning experience for
La Tourette, but the 16-year
old swimmer surpassed his
coach's expectations by qual
ifying for the final heat of the
1,500 and breaking his per
sonal record in the event by
nearly 40 seconds.
"That was the start of
everything," Rose said.
Despite La Tourette's
rapid time drops, he and his
family didn't treat swimming
as life or death. Rose remem
bers having a conversation
with Chad's father, Ken La
Tourette, after the Indi
anapolis meet that signaled
to Rose that the family was a
bit naive about La Tourette's
potential. It was a typical
parent-to-coach conversation
that often drives swim coach
es crazy, Rose laughed.
"We're going on vaca
tion in the summer, and
Chad will be gone for
three weeks, if that's
okay," Rose remembers
Chad's father saying.
"No, that's not okay
not if he's going to be
fighting for an interna
tional [meet] spot," Rose
told him.
"Well, we're going to be
in London and they have
hotel pools there, so I'm
sure he can swim back
and forth," Ken said.
In the end, the La
Tourette family took its an
nual summer trip, and La
Tourette still posted decent
times at the summer nation
al meet despite having been
on vacation just a few weeks
earlier.
LaTourette would even
tually grow to be 5-foot-11,
short when compared to the
towering heights of some of
the top distance swimmers
in recent history many,
such as 1,500-meter world
record holder Sun Yang, are
6-foot-4 to 6-foot-6. But La
Tourette didn't let his physi
cal limitations impede his
progress towards becoming
one of the best distance
swimmers in the country.
"What he didn't have in
size and innate athleticism,
he made up in heart," Rose
said. "Chad never backed
down in a race. Chad never
backed out of anything. He
was very strong mentally,
and he was also one of the
top three or four most hard
working swimmers I've ever
coached."
"I wasn't born with a
Michael Phelps build," La
Tourette said of the 22-time
Olympic medalist. "But I
was tough. When you have
the physical toughness as
well as the mental game to
back it up, you can take
yourself really far in this
sport, especially in distance
swimming."
♦ ♦♦
La Tourette entered the
2008 Olympic Trials as the
fourth seed. The 19-year-old

finished second in the pre
liminary session and was by
far the youngest swimmer
among the competitors in the
finals race who had a realistic
chance of qualifying for the
Olympics. Big meets weren't
new for La Tourette despite
his young age. Not only did
he come into the Trials with
multiple national champi
onship meets under his belt,
but he also had a fair share of
experience in international
competitions, including win
ning two individual gold
medals at the 2007 World
University Games and plac
ing fourth in the 5K open-wa
ter race at the 2008 Open
Water World Champi
onships.
But as both La Tourette
and Rose acknowledged, the
intense and high-pressure
atmosphere of the Trials is
unlike that of any other com
petition in swimming.
"I definitely brought a
deer-in-the-headlights ele
ment to the 2008 Trials," La
Tourette said. "In some re
gards, I was pretty fazed by
the difference that the Trials
brings in terms of the level of
energy and also just how
much different it is from oth
er swim meets, including top
level international swim
meets."
The high level of anxiety
that athletes feel at the
Olympic Trials extends be
yond swimming. Stanford
diving head coach Rick
Schavone, a four-time NCAA
Coach of the Year who has
coached diving for over 40
years, believes that the
Olympic Trials for divers is
harder than the actual
Olympic Games.
"Because we have so
much depth in this country
and so much pressure to
make the team, the Trials is
the toughest meet my ath
letes go through," Schavone
said.
"The Olympic Trials is a
mental game," Rose added.
"And that's why so many
swimmers get beat."
However, La Tourette
fared well mentally. Rose
game-planned La Tourette's
1,500-meter race with the
goal of beating Erik Vendt,
who was the top seed in the
finals and also had the
fastest time in the 1,500 in
the world so far that year.
The coach felt that La
Tourette would most likely
finish in the top two and
qualify for the Olympics if he
could beat who they thought
was by far the most impres
sive swimmer in the 1,500
coming into the Trials. La
Tourette swam the race ex
actly as Rose drew it up. Not
only did La Tourette beat
Yendt, but he also set a per
sonal record by breaking the
15-minute barrier.
The only problem was
that two other swimmers
Peter Vandei'kaay and
Larsen Jensen beat
Vendt by even more and fin
ished ahead of La Tourette
by a comfortable margin.
"Chad swam a great
race," Rose said. "He did
what he was asked to do, but
it was just in the cards that
he didn't make it. Bottom
line is, odd man out at third.
That was a very, very men
tally taxing thing for both of
us probably more for me
than him."
The result was indeed
disappointing for La
Tourette, but he bounced
back quickly for an athlete
who had just missed the
Olympics by one spot. With
four years at Stanford to
look forward to, it took him
only one week to reset men
tally.
"I didn't really give my
self time to be discouraged
by the result because I was
about to embark on a new
chapter in college," La
Tourette said. "And that was
a very good prospect to have
in terms of not letting myself
be too down about it and be
ing able to look forward to a
new beginning at Stanford."
♦ ♦♦
In his time on the Farm,
La Tourette became the best
distance swimmer in Stan
ford history. He won the
NCAA title in the 1,650-yard
freestyle as a sophomore,
and though he finished sec
ond at the NCAAs in his jun
ior and senior seasons, he
continued to drop time until
he broke the American
record in the 1,650 at his last
NCAAs in 2012. La Tourette
ended his decorated college
career as an eight-time Ail-
American and five-time con
ference champion.
After every college sea
son, La Tourette returned to
Mission Viejo for the sum
mer to train with Rose, his
longtime club coach. The
transition always proved to

be seamless. He grabbed
one gold and two silvers at
the World University Games
in the 2009 summer season,
won his first national title in
the 1,500-meter in the sum
mer of 2010 and recorded a
top-five finish in the 1,500 at
the World Championships in
the summer of 2011. Given
all the success that La
Tourette had training under
Rose since he was 13, it was
a forgone conclusion that he
would go back to Mission
Viejo to train in the four
months between the NCAAs
and the Olympic Trials.
"I knew there would be a
more committed atmosphere
at Mission Viejo," La
Tourette said. "It was also
nice to be able to live at home
while training, and have that
as a support channel."
But for the first time,
things didn't go smoothly for
La Tourette back at home.
Looking back, La
Tourette felt that he over
trained and added too many
wrinkles into his training
regimen. Right after a big
meet such as the NCAAs, a
coach will generally increase
the intensity and yardage of
a swimmer's workouts to
prepare him for the next im
portant meet. But there is al
so a delicate balance be
tween getting out of shape
and training too hard, and
La Tourette believes that a
23-year-old male swimmer
such as himself doesn't lose
his training base that easily.
"The science says it takes
actually quite a long time for
the aerobic base to go away,
like on the order of 10 weeks
or so." La Tourette said. "I
think any perception of a
loss of base is more psycho
logical than physical... And
when you overtrain, it's very
easy to forget details. So
when you're tired mentally
and physically, you're letting
your form degrade in prac
tice or not worrying about
turns and starts as much."
"I made it tougher than it
should have been," he added.
"Four months actually isn't
that long an amount of time
physiologically to introduce
new training aspects."
Like many elite swim
mers, La Tourette also went
to Colorado Springs, Colo.,
for altitude training camp.
Altitude training can help in
crease a swimmer's per
formance by enlarging his or
her blood cells, but the bene
fits are temporary. La
Tourette believes that he
mistimed the training trip by
going too early, and as a re
sult, he was not able to reap
the full benefits of altitude
camp.
"I don't know, I really
don't know," said Rose, when
asked if he thought La
Tourette's altitude training
was mistimed. "Ever since
2012, I've been asking my
self questions and coming up
with different answers all
along. I can't tell you if that
was good, bad or in be
tween."
La Tourette also feels
that the length of his taper
was too short. All of his suc
cessful tapers have been
around three weeks, said La
Tourette, but he didn't start
decreasing his training load
until a week and a half before
the Trials. He blamed his
coach for not sticking to the
same workout routine that
led to success in the three
earlier summers.
"Everyone was wonder
ing why we started taper so
late," La Tourette said. "I
found myself going into the
coach's office being like,
'Why was today's workout so
long? What was today's
workout so hard?"'
Rose said he doesn't re
member having that conver
sation.

Chad La Tburette is five
laps away from mak
ing the Olympics.
It's the 1,500-meter
freestyle finals on
the last day of the 2012 U.S.
Olympic Trials in Omaha, Neb.,
where the nation's top 2,000
swimmers have gathered to com
pete for just a handful of spots
on the U.S. Olympic team.
A recent Stanford graduate,
La Tourette has logged lap after
lap usually at the rate of
16,000 meters per day to pre
pare for the most important race
of his life. Stanford is a factory

where Olympians are mass-pro
duced every four years: Cardi
nal-affiliated athletes have col
lected a total of 224 medals in
Olympic history, and if Stanford
were its own country, it would be
ranked 24th in the all-time
Olympic medal standings, ahead
of Spain, Greece and Mexico.
Failure is rarely associated
with Stanford athletics.
Four years earlier at the 2008
Trials, La Tourette finished third
in the same event in the same
pool. At almost every other
meet, a swimmer is given a
bronze medal if he finishes third,
but because only the top two fin
ishers in each event qualify for
the Olympics, coming in third at
the Trials is a swimmer's worst

nightmare.
It was a setback for La
Tourette at first, but since then
he has won six medals at major
international competitions, bro
ken an American record and
claimed an NCAA title and two
runner-up finishes. He came into
the Trials as the owner of the na
tion's fastest time in the 30-lap
race.
His journey to the 2012 Trials
should serve as a tale of redemp
tion, a tale of a veteran swimmer
finally fulfilling his ultimate
dream after coming tantalizingly
short four years ago. Stanford is
a breeding ground for Olympic
success, and there is no reason to
think that La Tourette won't join
the hundreds of Stanford

Olympians who have come be
fore him.
But he won't. La Tourette has
led the field for the first 12 min
utes of the race, but in the next
three, his dream turns into a
nightmare the very same one
he lived in 2008.
La Tourette climbs out of the
pool, a third-place finisher once
again. The first person he finds
is Bill Rose, his coach.
"It was the worst thing that's
ever happened to me in my 45
years of coaching," Rose will lat
er remember. La Tourette will
have trouble forgetting, too.
For now, all he does is stare at
his coach.

his coach.

Unlike most record-set
ting athletes, La Tourette
wasn't born with great phys
ical talent.
He first started swim
ming as an 8-year-old when
he joined the Mission Viejo
Nadadores, one of the
largest and most acclaimed
swimming clubs in the coun
try. But La Tourette didn't
post eye-popping times early
on as an age-group swimmer.
Nor was there any other in
dication that he would be
come one of the best swim
mers to ever come out of
Mission Viejo, the only club
team that he trained with un
til 2012.
It wasn't until La Tourette
was 13 years old that he
caught the attention of Rose,
the longtime head coach of
Mission Viejo and a member
of the American Swim
Coaches Hall of Fame. Rose
was impressed by La
Tourette's attitude and ap
proach to his races at a local
summer meet, and six
months later, La Tourette be
gan training with the group
of swimmers directly
coached by Rose, an honor
reserved for the top swim
mers at Mission Viejo.
"Chad was a late
bloomer," Rose said.
"Through his age group, he
was just kind of a normal
swimmer, and he matured
physically very late."
But when La Tourette did
finally bloom, his ceiling only
kept on rising. Two years af
ter Rose took him under his
wing, he qualified for his first
national meet the 2005
World Championship Trials
in Indianapolis. Rose ex
pected the meet to serve as a
good learning experience for
La Tourette, but the 16-year
old swimmer surpassed his
coach's expectations by qual
ifying for the final heat of the
1,500 and breaking his per
sonal record in the event by
nearly 40 seconds.
"That was the start of
everything," Rose said.
Despite La Tourette's
rapid time drops, he and his
family didn't treat swimming
as life or death. Rose remem
bers having a conversation
with Chad's father, Ken La
Tourette, after the Indi
anapolis meet that signaled
to Rose that the family was a
bit naive about La Tourette's
potential. It was a typical
parent-to-coach conversation
that often drives swim coach
es crazy, Rose laughed.
"We're going on vaca
tion in the summer, and
Chad will be gone for
three weeks, if that's
okay," Rose remembers
Chad's father saying.
"No, that's not okay
not if he's going to be
fighting for an interna
tional [meet] spot," Rose
told him.
"Well, we're going to be
in London and they have
hotel pools there, so I'm
sure he can swim back
and forth," Ken said.
In the end, the La
Tourette family took its an
nual summer trip, and La
Tourette still posted decent
times at the summer nation
al meet despite having been
on vacation just a few weeks
earlier.
LaTourette would even
tually grow to be 5-foot-11,
short when compared to the
towering heights of some of
the top distance swimmers
in recent history many,
such as 1,500-meter world
record holder Sun Yang, are
6-foot-4 to 6-foot-6. But La
Tourette didn't let his physi
cal limitations impede his
progress towards becoming
one of the best distance
swimmers in the country.
"What he didn't have in
size and innate athleticism,
he made up in heart," Rose
said. "Chad never backed
down in a race. Chad never
backed out of anything. He
was very strong mentally,
and he was also one of the
top three or four most hard
working swimmers I've ever
coached."
"I wasn't born with a
Michael Phelps build," La
Tourette said of the 22-time
Olympic medalist. "But I
was tough. When you have
the physical toughness as
well as the mental game to
back it up, you can take
yourself really far in this
sport, especially in distance
swimming."
♦ ♦♦
La Tourette entered the
2008 Olympic Trials as the
fourth seed. The 19-year-old

finished second in the pre
liminary session and was by
far the youngest swimmer
among the competitors in the
finals race who had a realistic
chance of qualifying for the
Olympics. Big meets weren't
new for La Tourette despite
his young age. Not only did
he come into the Trials with
multiple national champi
onship meets under his belt,
but he also had a fair share of
experience in international
competitions, including win
ning two individual gold
medals at the 2007 World
University Games and plac
ing fourth in the 5K open-wa
ter race at the 2008 Open
Water World Champi
onships.
But as both La Tourette
and Rose acknowledged, the
intense and high-pressure
atmosphere of the Trials is
unlike that of any other com
petition in swimming.
"I definitely brought a
deer-in-the-headlights ele
ment to the 2008 Trials," La
Tourette said. "In some re
gards, I was pretty fazed by
the difference that the Trials
brings in terms of the level of
energy and also just how
much different it is from oth
er swim meets, including top
level international swim
meets."
The high level of anxiety
that athletes feel at the
Olympic Trials extends be
yond swimming. Stanford
diving head coach Rick
Schavone, a four-time NCAA
Coach of the Year who has
coached diving for over 40
years, believes that the
Olympic Trials for divers is
harder than the actual
Olympic Games.
"Because we have so
much depth in this country
and so much pressure to
make the team, the Trials is
the toughest meet my ath
letes go through," Schavone
said.
"The Olympic Trials is a
mental game," Rose added.
"And that's why so many
swimmers get beat."
However, La Tourette
fared well mentally. Rose
game-planned La Tourette's
1,500-meter race with the
goal of beating Erik Vendt,
who was the top seed in the
finals and also had the
fastest time in the 1,500 in
the world so far that year.
The coach felt that La
Tourette would most likely
finish in the top two and
qualify for the Olympics if he
could beat who they thought
was by far the most impres
sive swimmer in the 1,500
coming into the Trials. La
Tourette swam the race ex
actly as Rose drew it up. Not
only did La Tourette beat
Yendt, but he also set a per
sonal record by breaking the
15-minute barrier.
The only problem was
that two other swimmers
Peter Vandei'kaay and
Larsen Jensen beat
Vendt by even more and fin
ished ahead of La Tourette
by a comfortable margin.
"Chad swam a great
race," Rose said. "He did
what he was asked to do, but
it was just in the cards that
he didn't make it. Bottom
line is, odd man out at third.
That was a very, very men
tally taxing thing for both of
us probably more for me
than him."
The result was indeed
disappointing for La
Tourette, but he bounced
back quickly for an athlete
who had just missed the
Olympics by one spot. With
four years at Stanford to
look forward to, it took him
only one week to reset men
tally.
"I didn't really give my
self time to be discouraged
by the result because I was
about to embark on a new
chapter in college," La
Tourette said. "And that was
a very good prospect to have
in terms of not letting myself
be too down about it and be
ing able to look forward to a
new beginning at Stanford."
♦ ♦♦
In his time on the Farm,
La Tourette became the best
distance swimmer in Stan
ford history. He won the
NCAA title in the 1,650-yard
freestyle as a sophomore,
and though he finished sec
ond at the NCAAs in his jun
ior and senior seasons, he
continued to drop time until
he broke the American
record in the 1,650 at his last
NCAAs in 2012. La Tourette
ended his decorated college
career as an eight-time Ail-
American and five-time con
ference champion.
After every college sea
son, La Tourette returned to
Mission Viejo for the sum
mer to train with Rose, his
longtime club coach. The
transition always proved to

be seamless. He grabbed
one gold and two silvers at
the World University Games
in the 2009 summer season,
won his first national title in
the 1,500-meter in the sum
mer of 2010 and recorded a
top-five finish in the 1,500 at
the World Championships in
the summer of 2011. Given
all the success that La
Tourette had training under
Rose since he was 13, it was
a forgone conclusion that he
would go back to Mission
Viejo to train in the four
months between the NCAAs
and the Olympic Trials.
"I knew there would be a
more committed atmosphere
at Mission Viejo," La
Tourette said. "It was also
nice to be able to live at home
while training, and have that
as a support channel."
But for the first time,
things didn't go smoothly for
La Tourette back at home.
Looking back, La
Tourette felt that he over
trained and added too many
wrinkles into his training
regimen. Right after a big
meet such as the NCAAs, a
coach will generally increase
the intensity and yardage of
a swimmer's workouts to
prepare him for the next im
portant meet. But there is al
so a delicate balance be
tween getting out of shape
and training too hard, and
La Tourette believes that a
23-year-old male swimmer
such as himself doesn't lose
his training base that easily.
"The science says it takes
actually quite a long time for
the aerobic base to go away,
like on the order of 10 weeks
or so." La Tourette said. "I
think any perception of a
loss of base is more psycho
logical than physical... And
when you overtrain, it's very
easy to forget details. So
when you're tired mentally
and physically, you're letting
your form degrade in prac
tice or not worrying about
turns and starts as much."
"I made it tougher than it
should have been," he added.
"Four months actually isn't
that long an amount of time
physiologically to introduce
new training aspects."
Like many elite swim
mers, La Tourette also went
to Colorado Springs, Colo.,
for altitude training camp.
Altitude training can help in
crease a swimmer's per
formance by enlarging his or
her blood cells, but the bene
fits are temporary. La
Tourette believes that he
mistimed the training trip by
going too early, and as a re
sult, he was not able to reap
the full benefits of altitude
camp.
"I don't know, I really
don't know," said Rose, when
asked if he thought La
Tourette's altitude training
was mistimed. "Ever since
2012, I've been asking my
self questions and coming up
with different answers all
along. I can't tell you if that
was good, bad or in be
tween."
La Tourette also feels
that the length of his taper
was too short. All of his suc
cessful tapers have been
around three weeks, said La
Tourette, but he didn't start
decreasing his training load
until a week and a half before
the Trials. He blamed his
coach for not sticking to the
same workout routine that
led to success in the three
earlier summers.
"Everyone was wonder
ing why we started taper so
late," La Tourette said. "I
found myself going into the
coach's office being like,
'Why was today's workout so
long? What was today's
workout so hard?"'
Rose said he doesn't re
member having that conver
sation.

Chad La Tburette is five
laps away from mak
ing the Olympics.
It's the 1,500-meter
freestyle finals on
the last day of the 2012 U.S.
Olympic Trials in Omaha, Neb.,
where the nation's top 2,000
swimmers have gathered to com
pete for just a handful of spots
on the U.S. Olympic team.
A recent Stanford graduate,
La Tourette has logged lap after
lap usually at the rate of
16,000 meters per day to pre
pare for the most important race
of his life. Stanford is a factory

where Olympians are mass-pro
duced every four years: Cardi
nal-affiliated athletes have col
lected a total of 224 medals in
Olympic history, and if Stanford
were its own country, it would be
ranked 24th in the all-time
Olympic medal standings, ahead
of Spain, Greece and Mexico.
Failure is rarely associated
with Stanford athletics.
Four years earlier at the 2008
Trials, La Tourette finished third
in the same event in the same
pool. At almost every other
meet, a swimmer is given a
bronze medal if he finishes third,
but because only the top two fin
ishers in each event qualify for
the Olympics, coming in third at
the Trials is a swimmer's worst

nightmare.
It was a setback for La
Tourette at first, but since then
he has won six medals at major
international competitions, bro
ken an American record and
claimed an NCAA title and two
runner-up finishes. He came into
the Trials as the owner of the na
tion's fastest time in the 30-lap
race.
His journey to the 2012 Trials
should serve as a tale of redemp
tion, a tale of a veteran swimmer
finally fulfilling his ultimate
dream after coming tantalizingly
short four years ago. Stanford is
a breeding ground for Olympic
success, and there is no reason to
think that La Tourette won't join
the hundreds of Stanford

Olympians who have come be
fore him.
But he won't. La Tourette has
led the field for the first 12 min
utes of the race, but in the next
three, his dream turns into a
nightmare the very same one
he lived in 2008.
La Tourette climbs out of the
pool, a third-place finisher once
again. The first person he finds
is Bill Rose, his coach.
"It was the worst thing that's
ever happened to me in my 45
years of coaching," Rose will lat
er remember. La Tourette will
have trouble forgetting, too.
For now, all he does is stare at
his coach.

his coach.

Unlike most record-set
ting athletes, La Tourette
wasn't born with great phys
ical talent.
He first started swim
ming as an 8-year-old when
he joined the Mission Viejo
Nadadores, one of the
largest and most acclaimed
swimming clubs in the coun
try. But La Tourette didn't
post eye-popping times early
on as an age-group swimmer.
Nor was there any other in
dication that he would be
come one of the best swim
mers to ever come out of
Mission Viejo, the only club
team that he trained with un
til 2012.
It wasn't until La Tourette
was 13 years old that he
caught the attention of Rose,
the longtime head coach of
Mission Viejo and a member
of the American Swim
Coaches Hall of Fame. Rose
was impressed by La
Tourette's attitude and ap
proach to his races at a local
summer meet, and six
months later, La Tourette be
gan training with the group
of swimmers directly
coached by Rose, an honor
reserved for the top swim
mers at Mission Viejo.
"Chad was a late
bloomer," Rose said.
"Through his age group, he
was just kind of a normal
swimmer, and he matured
physically very late."
But when La Tourette did
finally bloom, his ceiling only
kept on rising. Two years af
ter Rose took him under his
wing, he qualified for his first
national meet the 2005
World Championship Trials
in Indianapolis. Rose ex
pected the meet to serve as a
good learning experience for
La Tourette, but the 16-year
old swimmer surpassed his
coach's expectations by qual
ifying for the final heat of the
1,500 and breaking his per
sonal record in the event by
nearly 40 seconds.
"That was the start of
everything," Rose said.
Despite La Tourette's
rapid time drops, he and his
family didn't treat swimming
as life or death. Rose remem
bers having a conversation
with Chad's father, Ken La
Tourette, after the Indi
anapolis meet that signaled
to Rose that the family was a
bit naive about La Tourette's
potential. It was a typical
parent-to-coach conversation
that often drives swim coach
es crazy, Rose laughed.
"We're going on vaca
tion in the summer, and
Chad will be gone for
three weeks, if that's
okay," Rose remembers
Chad's father saying.
"No, that's not okay
not if he's going to be
fighting for an interna
tional [meet] spot," Rose
told him.
"Well, we're going to be
in London and they have
hotel pools there, so I'm
sure he can swim back
and forth," Ken said.
In the end, the La
Tourette family took its an
nual summer trip, and La
Tourette still posted decent
times at the summer nation
al meet despite having been
on vacation just a few weeks
earlier.
LaTourette would even
tually grow to be 5-foot-11,
short when compared to the
towering heights of some of
the top distance swimmers
in recent history many,
such as 1,500-meter world
record holder Sun Yang, are
6-foot-4 to 6-foot-6. But La
Tourette didn't let his physi
cal limitations impede his
progress towards becoming
one of the best distance
swimmers in the country.
"What he didn't have in
size and innate athleticism,
he made up in heart," Rose
said. "Chad never backed
down in a race. Chad never
backed out of anything. He
was very strong mentally,
and he was also one of the
top three or four most hard
working swimmers I've ever
coached."
"I wasn't born with a
Michael Phelps build," La
Tourette said of the 22-time
Olympic medalist. "But I
was tough. When you have
the physical toughness as
well as the mental game to
back it up, you can take
yourself really far in this
sport, especially in distance
swimming."
♦ ♦♦
La Tourette entered the
2008 Olympic Trials as the
fourth seed. The 19-year-old

finished second in the pre
liminary session and was by
far the youngest swimmer
among the competitors in the
finals race who had a realistic
chance of qualifying for the
Olympics. Big meets weren't
new for La Tourette despite
his young age. Not only did
he come into the Trials with
multiple national champi
onship meets under his belt,
but he also had a fair share of
experience in international
competitions, including win
ning two individual gold
medals at the 2007 World
University Games and plac
ing fourth in the 5K open-wa
ter race at the 2008 Open
Water World Champi
onships.
But as both La Tourette
and Rose acknowledged, the
intense and high-pressure
atmosphere of the Trials is
unlike that of any other com
petition in swimming.
"I definitely brought a
deer-in-the-headlights ele
ment to the 2008 Trials," La
Tourette said. "In some re
gards, I was pretty fazed by
the difference that the Trials
brings in terms of the level of
energy and also just how
much different it is from oth
er swim meets, including top
level international swim
meets."
The high level of anxiety
that athletes feel at the
Olympic Trials extends be
yond swimming. Stanford
diving head coach Rick
Schavone, a four-time NCAA
Coach of the Year who has
coached diving for over 40
years, believes that the
Olympic Trials for divers is
harder than the actual
Olympic Games.
"Because we have so
much depth in this country
and so much pressure to
make the team, the Trials is
the toughest meet my ath
letes go through," Schavone
said.
"The Olympic Trials is a
mental game," Rose added.
"And that's why so many
swimmers get beat."
However, La Tourette
fared well mentally. Rose
game-planned La Tourette's
1,500-meter race with the
goal of beating Erik Vendt,
who was the top seed in the
finals and also had the
fastest time in the 1,500 in
the world so far that year.
The coach felt that La
Tourette would most likely
finish in the top two and
qualify for the Olympics if he
could beat who they thought
was by far the most impres
sive swimmer in the 1,500
coming into the Trials. La
Tourette swam the race ex
actly as Rose drew it up. Not
only did La Tourette beat
Yendt, but he also set a per
sonal record by breaking the
15-minute barrier.
The only problem was
that two other swimmers
Peter Vandei'kaay and
Larsen Jensen beat
Vendt by even more and fin
ished ahead of La Tourette
by a comfortable margin.
"Chad swam a great
race," Rose said. "He did
what he was asked to do, but
it was just in the cards that
he didn't make it. Bottom
line is, odd man out at third.
That was a very, very men
tally taxing thing for both of
us probably more for me
than him."
The result was indeed
disappointing for La
Tourette, but he bounced
back quickly for an athlete
who had just missed the
Olympics by one spot. With
four years at Stanford to
look forward to, it took him
only one week to reset men
tally.
"I didn't really give my
self time to be discouraged
by the result because I was
about to embark on a new
chapter in college," La
Tourette said. "And that was
a very good prospect to have
in terms of not letting myself
be too down about it and be
ing able to look forward to a
new beginning at Stanford."
♦ ♦♦
In his time on the Farm,
La Tourette became the best
distance swimmer in Stan
ford history. He won the
NCAA title in the 1,650-yard
freestyle as a sophomore,
and though he finished sec
ond at the NCAAs in his jun
ior and senior seasons, he
continued to drop time until
he broke the American
record in the 1,650 at his last
NCAAs in 2012. La Tourette
ended his decorated college
career as an eight-time Ail-
American and five-time con
ference champion.
After every college sea
son, La Tourette returned to
Mission Viejo for the sum
mer to train with Rose, his
longtime club coach. The
transition always proved to

be seamless. He grabbed
one gold and two silvers at
the World University Games
in the 2009 summer season,
won his first national title in
the 1,500-meter in the sum
mer of 2010 and recorded a
top-five finish in the 1,500 at
the World Championships in
the summer of 2011. Given
all the success that La
Tourette had training under
Rose since he was 13, it was
a forgone conclusion that he
would go back to Mission
Viejo to train in the four
months between the NCAAs
and the Olympic Trials.
"I knew there would be a
more committed atmosphere
at Mission Viejo," La
Tourette said. "It was also
nice to be able to live at home
while training, and have that
as a support channel."
But for the first time,
things didn't go smoothly for
La Tourette back at home.
Looking back, La
Tourette felt that he over
trained and added too many
wrinkles into his training
regimen. Right after a big
meet such as the NCAAs, a
coach will generally increase
the intensity and yardage of
a swimmer's workouts to
prepare him for the next im
portant meet. But there is al
so a delicate balance be
tween getting out of shape
and training too hard, and
La Tourette believes that a
23-year-old male swimmer
such as himself doesn't lose
his training base that easily.
"The science says it takes
actually quite a long time for
the aerobic base to go away,
like on the order of 10 weeks
or so." La Tourette said. "I
think any perception of a
loss of base is more psycho
logical than physical... And
when you overtrain, it's very
easy to forget details. So
when you're tired mentally
and physically, you're letting
your form degrade in prac
tice or not worrying about
turns and starts as much."
"I made it tougher than it
should have been," he added.
"Four months actually isn't
that long an amount of time
physiologically to introduce
new training aspects."
Like many elite swim
mers, La Tourette also went
to Colorado Springs, Colo.,
for altitude training camp.
Altitude training can help in
crease a swimmer's per
formance by enlarging his or
her blood cells, but the bene
fits are temporary. La
Tourette believes that he
mistimed the training trip by
going too early, and as a re
sult, he was not able to reap
the full benefits of altitude
camp.
"I don't know, I really
don't know," said Rose, when
asked if he thought La
Tourette's altitude training
was mistimed. "Ever since
2012, I've been asking my
self questions and coming up
with different answers all
along. I can't tell you if that
was good, bad or in be
tween."
La Tourette also feels
that the length of his taper
was too short. All of his suc
cessful tapers have been
around three weeks, said La
Tourette, but he didn't start
decreasing his training load
until a week and a half before
the Trials. He blamed his
coach for not sticking to the
same workout routine that
led to success in the three
earlier summers.
"Everyone was wonder
ing why we started taper so
late," La Tourette said. "I
found myself going into the
coach's office being like,
'Why was today's workout so
long? What was today's
workout so hard?"'
Rose said he doesn't re
member having that conver
sation.
