Chad La Tburette is five
laps away from mak
ing the Olympics.
It's the 1,500-meter
freestyle finals on
the last day of the 2012 U.S.
Olympic Trials in Omaha, Neb.,
where the nation's top 2,000
swimmers have gathered to com
pete for just a handful of spots
on the U.S. Olympic team.
A recent Stanford graduate,
La Tourette has logged lap after
lap usually at the rate of
16,000 meters per day to pre
pare for the most important race
of his life. Stanford is a factory

where Olympians are mass-pro
duced every four years: Cardi
nal-affiliated athletes have col
lected a total of 224 medals in
Olympic history, and if Stanford
were its own country, it would be
ranked 24th in the all-time
Olympic medal standings, ahead
of Spain, Greece and Mexico.
Failure is rarely associated
with Stanford athletics.
Four years earlier at the 2008
Trials, La Tourette finished third
in the same event in the same
pool. At almost every other
meet, a swimmer is given a
bronze medal if he finishes third,
but because only the top two fin
ishers in each event qualify for
the Olympics, coming in third at
the Trials is a swimmer's worst

nightmare.
It was a setback for La
Tourette at first, but since then
he has won six medals at major
international competitions, bro
ken an American record and
claimed an NCAA title and two
runner-up finishes. He came into
the Trials as the owner of the na
tion's fastest time in the 30-lap
race.
His journey to the 2012 Trials
should serve as a tale of redemp
tion, a tale of a veteran swimmer
finally fulfilling his ultimate
dream after coming tantalizingly
short four years ago. Stanford is
a breeding ground for Olympic
success, and there is no reason to
think that La Tourette won't join
the hundreds of Stanford

Olympians who have come be
fore him.
But he won't. La Tourette has
led the field for the first 12 min
utes of the race, but in the next
three, his dream turns into a
nightmare the very same one
he lived in 2008.
La Tourette climbs out of the
pool, a third-place finisher once
again. The first person he finds
is Bill Rose, his coach.
"It was the worst thing that's
ever happened to me in my 45
years of coaching," Rose will lat
er remember. La Tourette will
have trouble forgetting, too.
For now, all he does is stare at
his coach.
