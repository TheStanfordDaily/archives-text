## Coelho '17 debuts his second album Freshman will perform at Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Friday 
### BAKER TILNEY DESK EDITOR 
On Friday, Kevin Coelho 'l7 will cele
brate the release of his second album,
"Turn It Up," with a performance at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. For Coelho, the al
bum represents his continued artistic
growth, growth which has had a home at
Stanford for the past seven years.
Coelho began playing classical piano at
the age of four and started using the Ham
mond B-3 organ a rare instrument that
is no longer manufactured when he was
13. Coelho's B-3 is a 1962 vintage organ,
which he has been playing at shows
around San Francisco since he was 13 or
14. He currently plays regular shows at
Club DeLuxe and Madrone Art Bar in the
city.
"I started experimenting with key
board sounds and different stuff and none
of it was good enough, so I eventually
found my way to the B-3," Coelho said.
The Stanford Jazz Workshop, founded
by saxophonist Jim Nadel '72, played a ma
jor role in Coelho's education as a jazz
artist since he began attending the sum-
mer program seven years
ago. Nadel feels that Coelho's
interaction with other musi
cians helped his development.
"[Coelho has] interacted
with some of the greatest
music minds of our time,
and being the brilliant kind
of musician that he is, he's
absorbed what he can from
those players," Nadel said.
"That's informed and influ
enced his approach to the B

3 organ and the piano key
board."
Coelho, who released his
first album "Funkengru
ven - the Joy of Driving a B3"
at age 16, says that he now
focuses on finding his own
voice and experimenting
with new genres.
A vein of music that Coel
ho is exploring is R&B/hip
hop/soul/funk in the form of
The St. Valentinez, a Bay
Area band for which he both
plays organ and arranges
shows. The group raised
$18,660 in a Kickstarter,
which will allow them to re
lease their debut album lat

er this year.
This mixture of musical
interests parallels Coelho's
wide-ranging personal inter
ests, which include a lifelong
interest in computer sci
ence. He began coding at a
young age, and says that his
academics come before mu
sic for the time being.
"I think I know enough
about the music industry to
know that it's rough out
there," Coelho said. "If I get a
lucky break [in music] I'll
make that decision when I
get there."
Nadel, who has worked
with Coelho since his first

year at the Stanford Jazz
Workshop, is equally uncer
tain about Coelho's future
but thinks that he could be a
unique talent.
"We've had a handful of
wonderful jazz musicians
come through [Stanford], a
handful that went on to
make a real mark in music,"
said Nadel. "And Kevin
might be one of them."
Tomorrow's release par
ty, which is free admission,
will take place at 7:30 p.m. at
Dinkelspiel.
