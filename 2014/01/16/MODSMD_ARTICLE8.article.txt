## Three faculty members win presidential award 
### â€“ Catherine Zaw 
Three faculty members
have each won a Presidential
Early Career Award for Sci
entists and Engineers, con
sidered to be "the highest
honor given by the U.S. gov
ernment to scientists and en
gineers in the early stages of
their research careers."
Sigrid Close, Jennifer
Dionne and Sean Hartnoll
were among 102 winners who
will be recognized in Wash
ington, D.C., later this year.
Close, assistant professor
of aeronautics and astronau
tics, was honored for her
work on the impact of mete
oroid and radio emissions on
the atmosphere and space
craft.

Dionne, assistant profes
sor of materials science and
engineering, is developing
materials with artificial opti
cal and electrical properties,
using these materials to con
trol nanoscale systems. She
and her coworkers designed
a broadband negative index
material that manipulates
light.
Hartnoll, assistant profes
sor of physics, worked to use
theoretical math to explain
gravity in and around black
holes. Hartnoll is applying
this information to better un
derstand what causes elec
trons to flow erratically
through high-temperature
exotic metal superconduc
tors.
Aside from the presti
gious honor, each winner will
receive up to five years of
federal funding to continue
pursuing his or her research.
