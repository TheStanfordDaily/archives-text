Seventeen Minutes That Changed Music History:
Beethoven's Great Fugue
Near the end of his life, Beethoven composed some of his most personal
and original music. The Grosse Fuge (or "Great Fugue"), originally planned
as the final movement to his opus 130 string quartet, was an almost-crazy
experiment in dissonance and disruption by the now-completely-deaf
composer. Called "repellent" and "incomprehensible" by his peers, the
Grosse Fuge was considered by Stravinsky to be "an absolutely
contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever."
Join Benjamin Simon as he leads members of the award-winning youth
orchestra, Palo Alto Chamber Orchestra (PACO), in a performance of
the fugue, preceded by an introductory talk on Beethoven and his musical
development. Stephen Malinowski's brilliant music animation machine
graphics will be shown during the performance, adding a visual layer to
your listening experience that will let you actually see the musical patterns
of this complex work as they unfold in real time.
