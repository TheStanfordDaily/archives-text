# BIG TALKERS
## OUR TOP 10 INTERVIEWEES OF 2013 
### 
There are many great people involved with
Stanford Athletics, and The Daily Sports Staff
interacts with a large percentage of them. In
honor of the top-10 issue, the following is a
list of The Daily Sports Staff's top 10 favorite
people to interview.

1 Women's basketball senior Chiney Ogwumike
As a four-year starter on the women's basketball
team, Ogwumike has spent plenty of time in the
spotlight, and there's no one at Stanford who
shines brighter in that light. From on-camera dance
parties to eloquent interviews, a moment with Og
wumike is never dull.

2 Women's volleyball head coach John Dunning
Dunning sounds more like a history professor than
a coach, which isn't surprising given his start as a
high school teacher and coach. He captures the
essence of every moment, good or bad, and never
seems to hide anything. Dunning's press confer
ence after a tough loss to USC this season was one
of the best we've ever seen.

3 Football senior Conor McFadden

Thirty seconds into your first conversation with
McFadden, you feel like a lifelong friend. Two min
utes later, you're pretty sure your last name is also
McFadden. McFadden's booming voice, beaming
smile and cunning wit will be missed during his
time away from the Farm to work on his dad's Sen
ate campaign.

4 Baseball junior Alex Blandino

Two moments in particular clinched this spot for
Blandino. First, Blandino's description of scoring
the game-winning run in a walkoff Cardinal win
early in the 2013 season was hilarious. Later, after
a season-ending loss, Blandino's sadness and disap
pointment was profound.

5 Women's water polo junior Kiley Neushul

It's easy to tell the truth when everything is going
well or everything is going badly. Neushul told the
enlightening truth when her team's dynamic was
somewhere in the middle, and it allowed for an in
triguing look into what was billed as the best colle-

giate water polo team ever assembled.

G Men's soccer senior JJ Koval

Playing a sport that doesn't get much media atten
tion, Koval was relatively anonymous on Stanford's
campus despite having the talent that would make
him a top-10 MLS Draft selection. Koval makes you
feel comfortable with his quiet demeanor and gives
great descriptions of his team's fight to make it to
the NCAA Tournament.

7 Women's volleyball senior Rachel Williams
The best way to describe interviewing Williams is
that you always feel like you're having a conversa
tion with the real her. It's often easy to forget that
stars like Williams have a life outside of their sport,
but after talking to Rachel, those are the things you
remember most about her.

8 Football defensive coordinator Derek Mason
When you're talking with Mason, make sure to
clear out your schedule. Ask him a question, and
you'll watch it go in a completely different direc
tion than you imagined; but everything he says is
awesome. And when you're done with the inter
view you'll feel like you gained a friend.

9 Men's swimming senior Bryan Offutt

Offutt is the definition of a Stanford Renaissance
Man. Where else do you find a world-class swim
mer walking from swim practice to the computer
science section he teaches sporting a tie-dye shirt,
overgrown hair, a scraggly beard and Baltimore
Ravens' pajama pants? And when you talk to him,
it becomes quickly apparent that he's far along on
the path to enlightenment.

10 Football alumnus James McGillicuddy 'O9
The best way to describe why we had to put this
alumnus on the list: Just ask head football coach
David Shaw. After reading "Rags to Roses," Shaw
told me, "Every time I saw a quote about to come
from McGillicuddy I cringed." That is every sports
writer's dream.
