# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## New No. 1 heads to UCLA, UCSB 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
There is a new No. 1 on
top of the men's volleyball
national rankings, and that
team is Stanford. Thanks to
three impressive victories
and an undefeated record,
the Cardinal (3-0) moved
from the No. 4 spot to No. 1
this week. Stanford will look
to continue its dominant per
formance while on the road
this weekend, hoping to
avoid defeat and maintain its
position as the team to beat.
The Cardinal is heading
south and will face No. 6
UCLA on Friday and No. 11
UC-Santa Barbara on Satur
day. Both teams have proven
difficult opponents on their
home courts in recent sea
sons.

But in the opening
weeks of the season, Stan
ford has demonstrated its
strength as an experienced
and versatile team. The of
fense has proven its ability to
be both aggressive and con
sistent, with 152 kills so far
this season. The defense has
been critical as well, keeping
the average attack percent
age of the Card's opponents
at .240, compared to Stan
ford's .361 percentage. And
the Cardinal's stellar service
game with 22 aces and an
average of two aces per set
â€”is truly setting Stanford
apart from its opponents.

This will not be Stan
ford's first match against
UCLA this season. The two
teams met in their season

openers, and the Cardinal came out victori
ous, winning the match in four sets and out
hitting UCLA .433 to .252.

But Stanford cannot underestimate
UCLA, which has gone on a three-match
winning streak including a victory against
No. 10 Hawaii at the Outrigger Hotels Invi
tational since that Jan. 4 loss to Stanford.
Senior outside hitter Robart Page was named
the tournament's most outstanding player,
leading UCLA to its victory over Hawaii with
16 kills. Page demonstrated ability to excel
in a high-pressure environment and had crit
ical points late in the match.

Stanford will also face UCSB this week

end. Stanford must look to control and limit
both senior outside hitter Matt Hanley and
senior middle blocker Ryan Thompson, who
both provide UCSB with offensive leader
ship. The two players led UCSB to a .420 hit
ting percentage in its win against UC-Santa
Cruz.

But over the past two weeks, Stanford
has appeared to be both the more experi
enced and consistent team. UCSB's offense
will find it difficult to answer the Cardinal's
attack if Stanford plays as aggressively and
balanced as it has shown it can.

Stanford will face UCLA on Friday at 3
p.m. and UCSB on Saturday at 7 p.m. The
UCLA match will be broadcasted on Pac-12
Networks.
