### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
There is a new No. 1 on
top of the men's volleyball
national rankings, and that
team is Stanford. Thanks to
three impressive victories
and an undefeated record,
the Cardinal (3-0) moved
from the No. 4 spot to No. 1
this week. Stanford will look
to continue its dominant per
formance while on the road
this weekend, hoping to
avoid defeat and maintain its
position as the team to beat.
The Cardinal is heading
south and will face No. 6
UCLA on Friday and No. 11
UC-Santa Barbara on Satur
day. Both teams have proven
difficult opponents on their
home courts in recent sea
sons.

But in the opening
weeks of the season, Stan
ford has demonstrated its
strength as an experienced
and versatile team. The of
fense has proven its ability to
be both aggressive and con
sistent, with 152 kills so far
this season. The defense has
been critical as well, keeping
the average attack percent
age of the Card's opponents
at .240, compared to Stan
ford's .361 percentage. And
the Cardinal's stellar service
game with 22 aces and an
average of two aces per set
â€”is truly setting Stanford
apart from its opponents.

This will not be Stan
ford's first match against
UCLA this season. The two
