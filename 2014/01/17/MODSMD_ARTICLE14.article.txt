# Versatility key for Stanford's stars on 0

### Joseph Beyda 
Gather round, Nation of Nerds. It's
that time of the year again: I'm
ready to issue my heartfelt-apology
to-Stanford's-offensive-star col
umn.

In case you haven't been counting the
days until this much-anticipated event, I'll re
mind you that this tradition began last January,
when I apologized for my misguided presea
son prediction that Levine Toilolo would over-

take Zach Ertz as
Stanford's best tight
end (and offensive
player).
Of course, I put
my foot back in my
mouth this Septem-

ber, when I wrote
that Anthony Wilker- -

son would emerge as Stanford's top running
back even though Tyler Gaffney had just dom
inated the playing time in the team's season
opener. The result was a 1,709-yard season
for Gaffney the second-best mark in
school history on a gargantuan 330 car
ries, and a 353-yard season for Wilkerson on
only 84 attempts. Oops.
(Just a week later, I also wrote that jun
ior tailback Ricky Seale would be Stanford's
breakout offensive star. His final numbers:
34 yards on 11 carries.)
Late this season, in an effort to at least
partially make up for my mistake, I asked of
fensive coordinator Mike Bloomgren exactly
what made Gaffney so special. The answer
seemed to be threefold: his strength, his
shiftiness and his durability. Gaffney could
bounce off a hit at the line of scrimmage,
pick through a crowded box and manage to
do it all 45 times in a game.

In an offense as diverse as the Cardi
nal's, that comes in handy. By the Rose Bowl
Game, Gaffney was lining up in the I-forma
tion for power runs as often as he was in the
shotgun for read options not to mention
nobody's favorite, the Wildcat.
If you think about it, that's the same rea
son Ertz was such a surprising success last

year. Before 2012, we knew him as an un
derneath route-runner, but as a senior he
was shaking defenders downfield as well as
his predecessor, fellow NFL tight end Coby
Fleener.

Maybe that's also why we haven't seen
as much as we expected from certain Cardi
nal players. Game after game, the Red Zone
was calling for Barry J. Sanders to party like
it's 1988. Hate to break it to you guys, but
word is he can't run between the tackles as
well as the team's other running backs
not yet, at least. By the same token, Wilker
son has NFL-quality power and speed, but he
lacks the eagle-eyed vision that made
Gaffney such a consistent, versatile per

former.

So over the next eight months, when it
comes time for me and my fellow media
members to make lofty preseason projec
tions, I'm going to look past the obvious
when it comes to the Cardinal. I won't count
out the tight end with a three-inch height
disadvantage or the running back who has to
transition from minor-league baseball to col
lege football. Instead, I'll consider which
players give Stanford the most flexibility, ver
satility, whatever you want to call it come
hell or high Wildcat.
Maybe I'll be wrong again. That's fine; I
like how my foot tastes.
