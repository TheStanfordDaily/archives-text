## Koval taken ninth by San Jose Earthquakes 
### â€” Joseph Beyda 
Stanford senior midfielder JJ Koval
was selected ninth in the MLS Super Draft
by the San Jose Earthquakes on Thursday
morning, marking the second time in as
many years the South Bay squad has added
a Cardinal player.
Koval will join former teammate
Adam Jahn 'l3, who was picked 15th by
the Earthquakes in last year's supplemen
tal draft. Jahn scored four goals in 16 ap
pearances in his first MLS season, includ
ing the dramatic equalizer in the 92nd
minute against Portland and another late
game-tying goal against New York.

Koval isn't as much of a scorer as Jahn

he notched just two goals and an assist
last season but the Cardinal captain
was prized by pro scouts for his physicality
and leadership.
The All-Pac-12 midfielder played few
er than 90 minutes only twice last season,
and notched a crucial assist on Aaron Ko
var's overtime goal to beat No. 5 Cal in the
final game of the regular season. That win
helped propel Stanford to its first NCAA
Tournament berth since 2009.

In October, Koval told The Daily that
he was on track to graduate with a degree
in human biology during fall quarter, but
that he hoped to return to school some
day to finish his pre-med classes.
In an interview with topdrawersoc
cer.com two weeks ago, Koval, a native of
Camarillo, Calif., noted that he grew up
rooting for his hometown L.A. Galaxy, the
Earthquakes' biggest rival.
