## Top 10: Campus EATERIES 
### ELLA AITCHISON 
It's Tuesday night after the
worst midterm you've ever tak
en, and you can't fathom a
healthier outcome than eating
your feelings. To make matters
worse, you have no car, and
even though you're kicking your
self for not doing that Zip Car regis
tration, you'd rather lie on your fu
ton than do anything about it. Let
The Weekender make the most of
night in, and check out these on
campus options:

I Coupa:

For the chic "Starbucks? What Star
bucks?" look you've always wanted,
there's no place better than Coupa.
Between the rich and creamy chai
teas and smooth crepes, this little
cafe's got what you need. You can
even make eye contact with Green
while you're doing it, letting all
those suckers in the window know
what they're missing.

2 Ricker Dining:

If you're looking for a little exercise
to counter-balance your emotional
eating, Ricker is your dining hall

after that trek up Santa Teresa
you'll deserve that plate of mashed
potatoes as big as your head, with
gravy and turkey and fries and any
thing but the green color that
haunts your soul.

3 Thai Cafe:

Maybe your midterm fell in the
middle of the day, and you don't
want to face that one smug neigh
bor who will remind you what you
did wrong when you were frolick
ing in blissful ignorance. To hide
out from the world for a while, pop
into the Thai Cafe hiding in the
quad the peaceful anonymity of
slurping heavy noodles and richly
spiced broccoli from a Styrofoam
container can heal any wound.

4 Olives:

For those grab-'n'-go, "Stanford's
got nothin' on me" days, Olives will
have you in and out in a flash.
Sleeker than a dining hall, cheaper
than a real restaurant, Olives will
give you some version of the sushi
and salmon you'll really be eating
as a CEO one day (after you pass
107, of course).

5 Late Nite @ Lakeside:
Nothing better to work off that
study guilt than with a guilty pleas
ure. It's simple to replace "Was it A
or C?" with "Peanut butter or oreo
milkshake?" and, unlike your exam,
you still have the option of saying,
"Both, please."

6 The CoHo:
You and the underwhelmed, strug
gling musicians at the open mic can
bond over the gorgeous coffees and
sandwiches while you stare blankly
at instant replays of the football
game that the bio exam made you
miss. Take it out on that whole
wheat bread —it doesn't even
know what polyploidy is.

7 The Treehouse:
For the taco-munching, guitar-play
ing, low-light-seeking hippies in all of
us, Treehouse is a perfect place to call
home. With all the guilty fries that you
could ever want and a corner locale
on campus, the only thing slowing
you down is the looks from people in
the Tresidder gym, watching you with
envy from the treadmills.
8 Ike's:

Only coming in so late because of

the "college student budget" tax,
Ike's is the perfect place to eat
twice as much as you intended to,
at twice the price. There's no deny
ing the sweet victory of that honey
mustard or the warm tug of those
mozzarella sticks at your heart
strings, but if you're on a meal plan,
save it for a rainy day.

9 The Axe and Palm:

The highly over-rated and simulta
neously perfect burger joint of
choice, Axe and Palm's late hours
can't be beaten when you're toss
ing and turning over that one in
tegral and decide that the only
derivative of your frustration
should be extra barbeque sauce,
please.

10 Tresidder Memorial Union:
Last but not least, our student
center offers a charming array of
places to make the average
American feel right at home
between Panda Express, Star
bucks and Subway, it's just like
you're in kindergarten again,
staring out of the car window at
passing suburbia.

The highly over-rated and simulta
neously perfect burger joint of
choice, Axe and Palm's late hours
can't be beaten when you're toss
ing and turning over that one in
tegral and decide that the only
derivative of your frustration
should be extra barbeque sauce,
please.

10 Tresidder Memorial Union:
Last but not least, our student
center offers a charming array of
places to make the average
American feel right at home
between Panda Express, Star
bucks and Subway, it's just like
you're in kindergarten again,
staring out of the car window at
passing suburbia.

It's Tuesday night after the
worst midterm you've ever tak
en, and you can't fathom a
healthier outcome than eating
your feelings. To make matters
worse, you have no car, and
even though you're kicking your
self for not doing that Zip Car regis
tration, you'd rather lie on your fu
ton than do anything about it. Let
The Weekender make the most of
night in, and check out these on
campus options:

I Coupa:

For the chic "Starbucks? What Star
bucks?" look you've always wanted,
there's no place better than Coupa.
Between the rich and creamy chai
teas and smooth crepes, this little
cafe's got what you need. You can
even make eye contact with Green
while you're doing it, letting all
those suckers in the window know
what they're missing.

2 Ricker Dining:

If you're looking for a little exercise
to counter-balance your emotional
eating, Ricker is your dining hall

after that trek up Santa Teresa
you'll deserve that plate of mashed
potatoes as big as your head, with
gravy and turkey and fries and any
thing but the green color that
haunts your soul.

3 Thai Cafe:

Maybe your midterm fell in the
middle of the day, and you don't
want to face that one smug neigh
bor who will remind you what you
did wrong when you were frolick
ing in blissful ignorance. To hide
out from the world for a while, pop
into the Thai Cafe hiding in the
quad the peaceful anonymity of
slurping heavy noodles and richly
spiced broccoli from a Styrofoam
container can heal any wound.

4 Olives:

For those grab-'n'-go, "Stanford's
got nothin' on me" days, Olives will
have you in and out in a flash.
Sleeker than a dining hall, cheaper
than a real restaurant, Olives will
give you some version of the sushi
and salmon you'll really be eating
as a CEO one day (after you pass
107, of course).

5 Late Nite @ Lakeside:
Nothing better to work off that
study guilt than with a guilty pleas
ure. It's simple to replace "Was it A
or C?" with "Peanut butter or oreo
milkshake?" and, unlike your exam,
you still have the option of saying,
"Both, please."

6 The CoHo:
You and the underwhelmed, strug
gling musicians at the open mic can
bond over the gorgeous coffees and
sandwiches while you stare blankly
at instant replays of the football
game that the bio exam made you
miss. Take it out on that whole
wheat bread —it doesn't even
know what polyploidy is.

7 The Treehouse:
For the taco-munching, guitar-play
ing, low-light-seeking hippies in all of
us, Treehouse is a perfect place to call
home. With all the guilty fries that you
could ever want and a corner locale
on campus, the only thing slowing
you down is the looks from people in
the Tresidder gym, watching you with
envy from the treadmills.
8 Ike's:

Only coming in so late because of

the "college student budget" tax,
Ike's is the perfect place to eat
twice as much as you intended to,
at twice the price. There's no deny
ing the sweet victory of that honey
mustard or the warm tug of those
mozzarella sticks at your heart
strings, but if you're on a meal plan,
save it for a rainy day.

9 The Axe and Palm:

The highly over-rated and simulta
neously perfect burger joint of
choice, Axe and Palm's late hours
can't be beaten when you're toss
ing and turning over that one in
tegral and decide that the only
derivative of your frustration
should be extra barbeque sauce,
please.
