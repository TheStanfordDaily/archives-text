# Top 10 Palo Alto Bars
## 
### RENJIE WONG FOOD EDITOR 
So it's Wednesday night, your readings
are nowhere near done and your
roommate's lover is over for the night
(awkward). You desperately need a
Hump Day drink. Where do you go?
Worry not The Weekender's got
you covered.

10 The Old Pro:

The Lowdown: Not your typical sports bar,
The Old Pro features a small but mind-bend
ing bar menu including wines on tap, kept
fresh in their barrels with nitrogen.
The Tipple of Choice: Strange though it
may sound, the 21 st Amendment Hell or
High Watermelon Wheat is a crisp, dry ale
with a summery tinge of fresh watermelon
flavor in each sip.
The Insider Tip: There's a mechanical bull.
We'd, you know, do the whole caveat emp
tor thing, but ah well. What's a college
night out without a cricked neck?

9 Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant:

The Lowdown: Chains may be mainstream,
but chains are reliable like the original
branch of Gordon Biersch in Palo Alto, with
its reasonably priced range of craft beers.
The Tipple of Choice: The Hefeweizen, a
golden brew with strangely comforting notes
of banana and clove.

The Insider Tip-. Show up for happy hour
all day on game days and proceed to
slide those kobe beef sliders down your
throat. You'll thank us.

8 Cafe Renzo:

The Lowdown: An old school, oak-paneled
bar set in an Italian restaurant, with an ex
pansive Italian wine list and an innovative
cocktail menu.

The Tipple of Choice : The Hendrick's
Fizz Cafe Renzo's rendition of the classic
gin fizz combines the floral depth of the
Scottish gin with a citrusy crispness of lime.
The Insider Tip : Sit at the bar and ask for a cu
cumber ribbon to go with that Hendrick's Fizz.

7 The Rose and Crown

The Lowdown : This olde English pubbe is
as tacky as they come, but between all those
bangers and mash, you'll find a heartily rotat
ed list of international beers. How terribly
spiffing!
The Tipple of Choice-. Old Speckled Hen,
the most English of English ales, is a beauti
fully creamy beer that's smoother than any
pick-up line you've ever tried.
The Insider Tip : Three-dollar Tuesday spe
cials, a.k.a. how to muster up enough
courage to ask for an extension on that damn
reflection paper.

6 Vino Locale:

The Lowdown : Nestled in a deliciously ram
bling Victorian mansion, this wine bistro's
open secret is not so much its sun-drenched
secret garden, but its brilliant Californian
wine list.

The Tipple of Choice-. The soft, cosseting
floral bouquet of Johannisberg Riesling
'lO from Mann Vineyards (down the road
in Santa Clara Valley) complements the ambi
ence perfectly.
The Insider Tip-. Can't decide your poison
of the day? The excellently curated wine
flights feature tasting portions of four Cali
fornian vinos.

5 Antonio's Nut House:

The Lowdown: Among the diviest of dive
bars the world has ever seen, the California
Ave. watering hole manages to toe the kitsch
line with a truly fail-proof array of our fa
vorite boozes.

The Tipple of Choice: The rarely seen Dog
fish Head 90 Minute IPA packs a breath
takingly intense punch for hop lovers out
there.

The Insider Tip: The 70s arcade machines
may be fun and all, but pay the mechanical
gorilla a visit for a really nutty treat (peanut
allergy sufferers might want to stay away).

4 The Bar at II Fornaio;

The Lowdown: Possibly the best Happy
Hour at possibly the best Italian restaurant in
Palo Alto.

The Tipple of Choice: The cucumber
martini is everything it should be: sharp, ice
cold and providing just the perfect sem
blance of a healthy drink. Shhh, drink up.
The Insider Tip: Head from the bar to the
adjoining restaurant, because nothing says
classy like pre-gaming dinner with a glass of
happy hour Trebbiano.

3 Gravity Bistro and Wine Bar:

TheLowdown: One of the few places in the
area to pour up some serious cocktails, this
joint is at once sophisticated and unpreten-

tious,

The Tipple of Choice: The deceptively
smooth Southern Ice Tea blends a smoky
brew of black iced tea, mint, sugar and
lemon that take the edge off the spirits (and
your impending deadline).
The Insider Tip: Swing by at happy hour
or les temps joyeux, as it is called here

and load up on both great drinks and truffle
matchstick fries.

2 Joya Restaurant & Lounge

The Lowdown: A sparkling jewel in the

crown of Palo Alto's dining strip, this Univer
sity Ave. establishment marries swanky tapas
lounge with classic Southern European liba-

tions.

The Tipple of Choice: Head straight for the
Red Pineapple Sangria, a house-made con
coction with fresh seasonal fruits and velvety
lambrusco wine.

The Insider Tip: For the perfect accompani
ment to your licor, order the surprisingly
good-value Artisan Cheese Plate, which fea
tures such flavors as manchego, urgelia and
black truffle honey.

1 The Dutch Goose:
The Lowdown: Less college dive bar than

treasured neighborhood gem, The Dutch
Goose is the legendary golden egg of Menlo
Park, serving up 33 beers and as many types
of grub.
The Tipple of Choice: Crispin, a wonder
fully refreshing Californian apple cider, pairs
so well with the deviled eggs that you'd be
hard boiled to not be blown away.

The Insider Tip: Make a beeline for The
Duck Blind, the outdoor heated patio that
transforms into a magical garden party by
night: It is packed to the brim even in the
frigid midwinter (the Bay Area version any
way). Me goose-ta.

cials, a.k.a. how to muster up enough
courage to ask for an extension on that damn
reflection paper.

6 Vino Locale:

The Lowdown : Nestled in a deliciously ram
bling Victorian mansion, this wine bistro's
open secret is not so much its sun-drenched
secret garden, but its brilliant Californian
wine list.

The Tipple of Choice-. The soft, cosseting
floral bouquet of Johannisberg Riesling
'lO from Mann Vineyards (down the road
in Santa Clara Valley) complements the ambi
ence perfectly.
The Insider Tip-. Can't decide your poison
of the day? The excellently curated wine
flights feature tasting portions of four Cali
fornian vinos.

5 Antonio's Nut House:

The Lowdown: Among the diviest of dive
bars the world has ever seen, the California
Ave. watering hole manages to toe the kitsch
line with a truly fail-proof array of our fa
vorite boozes.

The Tipple of Choice: The rarely seen Dog
fish Head 90 Minute IPA packs a breath
takingly intense punch for hop lovers out
there.

The Insider Tip: The 70s arcade machines
may be fun and all, but pay the mechanical
gorilla a visit for a really nutty treat (peanut
allergy sufferers might want to stay away).

4 The Bar at II Fornaio;

The Lowdown: Possibly the best Happy
Hour at possibly the best Italian restaurant in
Palo Alto.

The Tipple of Choice: The cucumber
martini is everything it should be: sharp, ice
cold and providing just the perfect sem
blance of a healthy drink. Shhh, drink up.
The Insider Tip: Head from the bar to the
adjoining restaurant, because nothing says
classy like pre-gaming dinner with a glass of
happy hour Trebbiano.

3 Gravity Bistro and Wine Bar:

TheLowdown: One of the few places in the
area to pour up some serious cocktails, this
joint is at once sophisticated and unpreten-

tious,

The Tipple of Choice: The deceptively
smooth Southern Ice Tea blends a smoky
brew of black iced tea, mint, sugar and
lemon that take the edge off the spirits (and
your impending deadline).
The Insider Tip: Swing by at happy hour
or les temps joyeux, as it is called here

and load up on both great drinks and truffle
matchstick fries.

2 Joya Restaurant & Lounge

The Lowdown: A sparkling jewel in the

crown of Palo Alto's dining strip, this Univer
sity Ave. establishment marries swanky tapas
lounge with classic Southern European liba-

tions.

The Tipple of Choice: Head straight for the
Red Pineapple Sangria, a house-made con
coction with fresh seasonal fruits and velvety
lambrusco wine.

The Insider Tip: For the perfect accompani
ment to your licor, order the surprisingly
good-value Artisan Cheese Plate, which fea
tures such flavors as manchego, urgelia and
black truffle honey.

1 The Dutch Goose:
The Lowdown: Less college dive bar than

treasured neighborhood gem, The Dutch
Goose is the legendary golden egg of Menlo
Park, serving up 33 beers and as many types
of grub.
The Tipple of Choice: Crispin, a wonder
fully refreshing Californian apple cider, pairs
so well with the deviled eggs that you'd be
hard boiled to not be blown away.

The Insider Tip: Make a beeline for The
Duck Blind, the outdoor heated patio that
transforms into a magical garden party by
night: It is packed to the brim even in the
frigid midwinter (the Bay Area version any
way). Me goose-ta.

So it's Wednesday night, your readings
are nowhere near done and your
roommate's lover is over for the night
(awkward). You desperately need a
Hump Day drink. Where do you go?
Worry not The Weekender's got
you covered.

10 The Old Pro:

The Lowdown: Not your typical sports bar,
The Old Pro features a small but mind-bend
ing bar menu including wines on tap, kept
fresh in their barrels with nitrogen.
The Tipple of Choice: Strange though it
may sound, the 21 st Amendment Hell or
High Watermelon Wheat is a crisp, dry ale
with a summery tinge of fresh watermelon
flavor in each sip.
The Insider Tip: There's a mechanical bull.
We'd, you know, do the whole caveat emp
tor thing, but ah well. What's a college
night out without a cricked neck?

9 Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant:

The Lowdown: Chains may be mainstream,
but chains are reliable like the original
branch of Gordon Biersch in Palo Alto, with
its reasonably priced range of craft beers.
The Tipple of Choice: The Hefeweizen, a
golden brew with strangely comforting notes
of banana and clove.

The Insider Tip-. Show up for happy hour
all day on game days and proceed to
slide those kobe beef sliders down your
throat. You'll thank us.

8 Cafe Renzo:

The Lowdown: An old school, oak-paneled
bar set in an Italian restaurant, with an ex
pansive Italian wine list and an innovative
cocktail menu.

The Tipple of Choice : The Hendrick's
Fizz Cafe Renzo's rendition of the classic
gin fizz combines the floral depth of the
Scottish gin with a citrusy crispness of lime.
The Insider Tip : Sit at the bar and ask for a cu
cumber ribbon to go with that Hendrick's Fizz.

7 The Rose and Crown

The Lowdown : This olde English pubbe is
as tacky as they come, but between all those
bangers and mash, you'll find a heartily rotat
ed list of international beers. How terribly
spiffing!
The Tipple of Choice-. Old Speckled Hen,
the most English of English ales, is a beauti
fully creamy beer that's smoother than any
pick-up line you've ever tried.
The Insider Tip : Three-dollar Tuesday spe
cials, a.k.a. how to muster up enough
courage to ask for an extension on that damn
reflection paper.
