So it's Wednesday night, your readings
are nowhere near done and your
roommate's lover is over for the night
(awkward). You desperately need a
Hump Day drink. Where do you go?
Worry not The Weekender's got
you covered.

10 The Old Pro:

The Lowdown: Not your typical sports bar,
The Old Pro features a small but mind-bend
ing bar menu including wines on tap, kept
fresh in their barrels with nitrogen.
The Tipple of Choice: Strange though it
may sound, the 21 st Amendment Hell or
High Watermelon Wheat is a crisp, dry ale
with a summery tinge of fresh watermelon
flavor in each sip.
The Insider Tip: There's a mechanical bull.
We'd, you know, do the whole caveat emp
tor thing, but ah well. What's a college
night out without a cricked neck?

9 Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant:

The Lowdown: Chains may be mainstream,
but chains are reliable like the original
branch of Gordon Biersch in Palo Alto, with
its reasonably priced range of craft beers.
The Tipple of Choice: The Hefeweizen, a
golden brew with strangely comforting notes
of banana and clove.

The Insider Tip-. Show up for happy hour
all day on game days and proceed to
slide those kobe beef sliders down your
throat. You'll thank us.

8 Cafe Renzo:

The Lowdown: An old school, oak-paneled
bar set in an Italian restaurant, with an ex
pansive Italian wine list and an innovative
cocktail menu.

The Tipple of Choice : The Hendrick's
Fizz Cafe Renzo's rendition of the classic
gin fizz combines the floral depth of the
Scottish gin with a citrusy crispness of lime.
The Insider Tip : Sit at the bar and ask for a cu
cumber ribbon to go with that Hendrick's Fizz.

7 The Rose and Crown

The Lowdown : This olde English pubbe is
as tacky as they come, but between all those
bangers and mash, you'll find a heartily rotat
ed list of international beers. How terribly
spiffing!
The Tipple of Choice-. Old Speckled Hen,
the most English of English ales, is a beauti
fully creamy beer that's smoother than any
pick-up line you've ever tried.
The Insider Tip : Three-dollar Tuesday spe
cials, a.k.a. how to muster up enough
courage to ask for an extension on that damn
reflection paper.

6 Vino Locale:

The Lowdown : Nestled in a deliciously ram
bling Victorian mansion, this wine bistro's
open secret is not so much its sun-drenched
secret garden, but its brilliant Californian
wine list.

The Tipple of Choice-. The soft, cosseting
floral bouquet of Johannisberg Riesling
'lO from Mann Vineyards (down the road
in Santa Clara Valley) complements the ambi
ence perfectly.
The Insider Tip-. Can't decide your poison
of the day? The excellently curated wine
flights feature tasting portions of four Cali
fornian vinos.

5 Antonio's Nut House:

The Lowdown: Among the diviest of dive
bars the world has ever seen, the California
Ave. watering hole manages to toe the kitsch
line with a truly fail-proof array of our fa
vorite boozes.

The Tipple of Choice: The rarely seen Dog
fish Head 90 Minute IPA packs a breath
takingly intense punch for hop lovers out
there.

The Insider Tip: The 70s arcade machines
may be fun and all, but pay the mechanical
gorilla a visit for a really nutty treat (peanut
allergy sufferers might want to stay away).

4 The Bar at II Fornaio;

The Lowdown: Possibly the best Happy
