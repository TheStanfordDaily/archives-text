# "At Berkeley"
## Documentarv sheds light on Cal 
### GILLIE COLLINS 
Renowned documentary filmmaker
Frederick Wiseman has done it
again and, this time, his focus
is closer to home. Wiseman's 38th
documentary, "At Berkeley," ex
poses the entrails of Stanford's
nearby rival, University of California at
Berkeley. The movie is a four-hour collage
of scenes from across the campus, from
trustee and faculty meetings to classroom
discussions, student protests and ROTC
workout sessions. Taken together, "At
Berkeley" is a portrait of an institution
striving to stay loyal to its founding ideals,
while also reshaping itself to meet chal
lenges of the 21st century.
The film's "fly on the wall" shooting
characteristic of Wiseman's work gen
erally allows audiences to witness the
inner workings of Berkeley's administra
tion, as the university considers new
budgeting policies. Prompted by massive
reductions in state funding, then-chancel
lor Robert J. Birgeneau leads a series of ad
ministrative meetings about bureaucratic
restructuring. While many members of

the community eagerly await greater effi
ciency, Birgeneau is also confronted by
faculty members critical of University
"corporatizing" and staff members afraid
for their jobs.

Wiseman follows these conversations
into classrooms, where teachers use the
university's predicament as a point of de
parture for discussions about the role of
government and import of education in
American democracy. Ultimately, the dis
cussion takes Wiseman into the streets,
where students are organizing a protest
responding to tuition spikes but asserting
a wide range of demands, including
greater resources for special needs and
disability students.
Throughout the film, Wiseman cap
tures the bizarre quirkiness of campus
life: a virtually all-male audience drooling
over a women's a cappella concert, admin
istrative officials chugging Starbucks cof
fee in afternoon meetings and students
slumped over their laptops, finishing prob
lem sets at the eleventh hour. At the same
time, he takes seriously the university's

theory of societal progress, which includes
both winning "the battle of ideas" and invest
ing in participatory politics. There is tension
in this philosophy, as the university appears
to encourage left-wing progressivism and
free speech in classrooms while cracking
down on student-led activism.

The movie is also interested in the grow
ing role of technology at the university and so
ciety at large. "At Berkeley" features long clips
of a programmer designing a laundry-folding
robot, as well as discussions between a pa
tient, his doctor and researchers, who are
working robotic legs to help a paralyzed man
walk. The movie comes to speculative finish,
with a professor discussing intergalactic space
travel —which prods audiences to imagine
how the university's future discoveries will in
fluence humanity in the short and long term.

Like most of Wiseman's films, "At Berke
ley" is primarily a movie about an institution,
but it is also a story about the human experi
ence within a system that shapes behavior
and ideology. Audiences are privy to the emo
tional lives of individuals, who struggle to pay
for college, survive academically and feel in
cluded socially. Where these stories are famil
iar, Stanford audiences are reminded that the
trials and tribulation of young adulthood are
not unique to one campus or another.
With its loose, nonlinear form, "At

Berkeley" is a film that requires viewers to do
the work of interpretation, to make meaning
of raw footage. Especially for members of the
Stanford community, the film is a conversa
tion starter, requiring subsequent discussion
about what it means to belong in a university
and to have a stake in a scholarly community.
School, Wiseman seems to say, is about the
transmission of values across generations. It
is for us to decide what those are.
