## Top 10: Ways to Revamp Your Wardrobe 
### LAYNIE STEPHENS FASHION COLUMNIST 
Dig around in your closet: You never
know what you'll find buried under that pile
of laundry you've been meaning to wash for
a few months now.

2 Borrow from a friend: it's the easiest and
cheapest way to play dress up, since you're
no longer five years old and in your mother's

closet.

3 Speaking of mom's closet: Why not try
there? You never know if she happened to
hold onto some clothes from when she was
younger and about your size. Sentimental
vintage, anyone?

4 Accessorize: It's amazing how different a
dress looks once you add a belt, some jewel
ry and a jacket.

5 Think of different ways to wear the same
thing: Example: A white v-neck with jeans
looks very different than a white v-neck
tucked into a high-waisted skirt, completed
with a cardigan.

6 Alter: If you have something that is too big

or too long, consider cutting it down or
sewing it to a tighter fit. How about making
that shirt that's a little too small a crop top?

7 Sell : There are a lot of sites that will buy
your old clothes that are in good condition,
and you can spend that money on a few new
items to complete your wardrobe!

8 Rent : There are also a lot of sites where
you can rent someone else's clothes, such as
Rent the Runway, if you're looking for some
thing different for a special occasion.

9 Challenge yourself to try something dif
ferent: May I suggest starting with: "Next
week, I'm going to only wear sweatpants
when I'm sleeping."

10 And most of all, be inspired: Channel
your inner Audrey Hepburn or Stacy London.
Let fashion icons influence you, but don't
ever forget your own personal style. That's
what makes your fashion unique.
