# The 						Square:
## On the Street in Egypt's Revolution 
### GILLIE COLLINS 
If you're like me, you followed Egypt's
revolution out of the corner of your
eye, through the lens of Western media
coverage. You saw President Hosni
Mubarak step down in January 2011
and watched the Egyptian people elect
and, a year later, remove Mohammed Mor
si from office. "The Square," a remarkable
new documentary by director Jehane Nou
jaim, is an essential complement to this
long-distance, top-down understanding of
Egypt's recent history, telling the story of
political change through the eyes of grass
roots activists. It is a film that needs to be
seen and shared.

"The Square" traces the experiences
of a handful of demonstrators, from their
protest tent idealism and kitchen table po
litical debates to their violent encounters
with the armed forces. We get to know
Ahmed, who grew up selling lemons to pay
for his schooling and is today a leader
among protesters, a charismatic orator and
an openhearted listener. Magdy, one of
Ahmed's allies and friends, is a father of five
and longtime member of the Muslim Broth

erhood, who is repeatedly prompted to
reevaluate his loyalties.
Khalid Abdalla, an Egyptian actor and
star of "The Kite Runner," is also featured
in the film: He has moved to Egypt to spend
time in Tahrir Square, advocating complete
and long-term political reform by day and
speaking with his father, an Egyptian civil
dissident in exile, via Skype by night.

While these characters have diverse
histories, what they share is persever
ance: They choose time and again to risk
their lives for freedom and democracy.
Their suffering is made particularly palpa
ble when Ramy Essam, a singer-song
writer for the revolution, endures a brutal
beating by the military. Sprawled out on a
bed, he bares his scars to the camera
and we observe, up close, the resilience
of the Egyptian people.
But this documentary is not just a call
for empathy. It's a sophisticated evaluation
of the revolution's outcomes. It exposes
slippage between idealism and naivety, as
well as the pitfalls of a "leaderless" political
movement. Indeed, in reflecting on the
revolution's accomplishments,
Noujaim interviews activists
who acknowledge that their
organization was thwarted by
factionalism. Egypt's economic
and political fate is far from re
solved today.
That said, Ahmed and his
friends see a change in popular
consciousness as the revolu
tion's primary achievement. As
Ahmed says, "I think what's
happening is more powerful
than any individual or any or
ganization. It's something fun
damental inside people that is
moving them. I don't know
how you kill that."
"The Square" promises to
help keep Ahmed's dreams
alive. The documentary is itself
a product of unflinching brav
ery, which does justice to the
everyday risks its characters
continue to bear. The camera
team was unafraid to ask dif
ficult questions, to shoot
from the eye of the storm, in
the midst of the conflagra
tion between demonstrators
and armed forces. In this
sense, Noujaim, her col
leagues and her characters
are all revolutionaries, captur
ing and elaborating the ideals
that exploded in Tahrir Square
three years ago.
