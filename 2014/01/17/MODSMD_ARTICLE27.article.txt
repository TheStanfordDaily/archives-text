# WINTER ONE ACTS
## Pose Deep Questions 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO 
In this year's "The Original Winter One
Acts," "original" means mind games. The
Ram's Head Theatrical Society seasonal
show, a collection of four student-writ
ten and student-directed one-act plays, is
stimulating. From the staged conversa
tions over coffee to surreal dream sequences,
this Stanford tradition from the oldest the
atrical company on campus serves up a jolt of
a show; though it lasts only a little more than
60 minutes, it will leave you pondering its
lessons for hours after.

"Henry Dances with The Man," by
Max Walker-Silverman 'l5, appropriately
opens the show. A mock sacrifice of his girl
friend to a dead rock n' roll star hurls Henry
(Bren Bovee 'l5) into a bizarre world, where,
hovering between reality and dreaming, he
embarks on a literal search for love. Like re
ality, his journey becomes muddied with the
often-frustrating distractions of everyday life,
personified by Brandon Silberstein (a first

year grad student), whose versatility helps
him succeed in his role as "the man" who
reappears like a bad dream. Packed with
deep-seated cynicism about the gross but
real contradictions of contemporary cul
ture, from profiting pastors to womanizing
lawyers, the play justifies Henry's â€”and
humanity's escapist impulses. Like many
romances before, love, yet again, proves to
be his only ticket out. That is, if he's brave
enough to face it.

Assuming that love is achievable, what
kind of love we choose is the problem posed
in the next play by Louis McWilliams 'l6,
"Sex on a Plane." While two strangers wait
to board at Gate 33, their relationship takes
an unexpected, comical turn when the topic
of sex casually comes up. The humor lies in
the interplay between awkward Martin
(Brady Richter 'l5) and talkative Helen
(Marly Carlisle 'l7), who is especially un
abashed about all things sexual. Though their
conversation seems to defy all standards of
public decency, the offhand manner with
which Helen talks about sex makes it almost
acceptable. In contrast, Martin, an overt mas
ter of euphemisms, shows how avoiding this
mature subject is a reflection of our being
constrained by our own underestimation and
miscalculated fantasies.

For workaholic Anuj in Yash Saraf ' 17's
"Toes," another dialogue-driven act and the
show's third installment, fantasies are put on
the back burner for the sake of professional
success. However, when his office is intrud
ed by the free-spirited Sasha from the third
floor, Anuj finds himself succumbing to his
childhood fantasies that stealthily sneak their
way back to the here and now. Together, Nis
hant Karandikar 'l6 and Malaika Murphy-
Sierra 'l7 give honest performances that
strike a familiar chord with young high-
