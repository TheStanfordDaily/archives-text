# Top 10: Movies of 2013
## 
### CALEB SMITH 
2013 may seem like forever ago al
ready, but we aren't done talking about it
yet! To bring back some fond (and maybe
also some painful) memories, here's the
top 10 list of movies from 2013:
I Oblivion:

After a nuclear war against an alien inva
sion, humanity's outpost on the ruined
remains of Earth runs into trouble

and faces big questions over whom it
can trust. An imposing epic that com
bines action, a brilliant plot and top ac
tors, this film takes the cake. Starring
Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman. Di
rected by Joseph Kosinski.

2 Now You See Me:

When a group of stage magicians robs a
bank, the resulting twists and turns in
this caper leave audiences at the edge of
their seats. Combining humor and trick
ery, this film is the best caper film we've
seen in a long time. Starring Jesse Eisen
berg. Directed by Louis Leterrier.

3 Hunger Games: Catching Fire:

Here's an unusual occurrence: a movie
that combines brilliantly choreographed
action with interesting thoughts about
resisting tyranny. This "Hunger Games"
sequel follows Katniss Everdeen (Jen
nifer Lawrence) as she returns to the
gladiatorial conflicts amid political tur
moil. Directed by Francis Lawrence.

4 White House Down

This movie is short plot, depth and cine
matography— but that doesn't matter
because it delivers the type of mindless
fun that only summer blockbusters can.
When terrorists attack the White House,
the President (Jaime Foxx) and a
cop (Channing Tatum) must team
up to save America. Directed by
Roland Emmerich.

5 Star Trek: Into Darkness:

The second movie in this "Star
Trek" reboot, this film features im
pressive special effects, a giddy
plot and a few twists on one of
Star Trek's favorite villains, Khan
(Benedict Cumberbatch). Not
very deep, but awfully fun. Star
ring Chris Pine. Directed by J. J.
Abrams.

6 Despicable Me 2:

This animated film features Gru
(voiced by Steve Carell) working
for the good guys. A fun film
about family, growing up and sav
ing the world, this movie brings
back the incredibly funny min
ions, who are up to their usual an
tics. Directed by Pierre Coffin and
Chris Renaud.

7 Iron Man 3:

Robert Downey Jr. returns as the
man in the iron suit. Although a
bit melodramatic, this sequel de
livers action, excitement and copi
ous amounts of snarky behavior.
It's probably the best superhero
movie of the year. Directed by
Shane Black.

8 Anchorman 2: The Legend
Continues:
Returning to legitimate films, "An
chorman 2" is a predictable but

still funny continuation of the Ron
Burgundy character. Starring the
inexhaustibly funny Will Ferrell as
Ron Burgundy, this film derides ca
ble news for its lack of depth, fixa
tion on ratings and generally insan
ity. Directed by Adam McKay.

9 Sharknado:

Some movies are so bad that they
arrive at entertainment from the
opposite direction. In this mind
blowingly dumb and cheesy disas
ter film, several denizens of Los
Angeles have to survive sharks,
storms and, yes, sharknados
(sharks flying around in the mid
dle of tornados). Starring lan Zier
ing, Tara Reid and John Heard. Di
rected by Anthony Ferrante.

10 The Host:

In a future world where an alien
invasion has taken over most
people's minds, a small group of
free humans seeks to resist.
Sleek, almost bleak settings and
cinematography give this film a
moody atmosphere and help fo
cus the audience's attention on
thought-provoking questions
about the relationships humans
have with other organisms. Star
ring Saoirse Ronan, Max Irons
and Jake Able. Directed by An
drew Niccol and based on a book
by Stephanie Meyer (who also
wrote the "Twilight" books).

invasion has taken over most
people's minds, a small group of
free humans seeks to resist.
Sleek, almost bleak settings and
cinematography give this film a
moody atmosphere and help fo
cus the audience's attention on
thought-provoking questions
about the relationships humans
have with other organisms. Star
ring Saoirse Ronan, Max Irons
and Jake Able. Directed by An
drew Niccol and based on a book
by Stephanie Meyer (who also
wrote the "Twilight" books).
