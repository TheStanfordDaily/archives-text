I Full Moon on the Quad (fall quarter)

Stanford's most historic tradition, Full Moon
on the Quad began as an occasion for well-in
tentioned seniors to welcome freshmen girls to
the Farm. Since then, the event has become a
night of body paint, drunk make-out sessions
and light-hearted debauchery.

2 Fountain Hopping (year round)

Nothing screams Stanford more than a frolic
from one pretty fountain to the next. If you
don't manage to fountain hop at least once in
your four years here, you don't receive your de
gree (just kidding, but come on).

3 Exotic Erotic (680 Lomita, spring quarter)
680's annual clothing-option extravaganza is
the only campus-wide party that requires ID
certification AND admission stickers, but even
then, the only way you're guaranteed entry is
if you live there.

4 Band Run (fall quarter)

Most freshmen's introduction to the quirky,
wonderful place that is Leland Stanford Junior
University is Band Run, an event led by the
Band. In body paint and rally gear, the Band
takes these young upstarts on late night jaunt
around campus, ending at the metaphorical
center of their Stanford lives: the Quad.

5 Hiking the Dish (year round)

A great way to sculpt your quads while taking a

study break, hiking the dish makes Stanford kids
feel both outdoorsy and athletic. But don't worry
â€”we doubt you'll be chased by a mountain lion.

G Back to School (SAE, fall quarter)

Love them or hate them, SAE knows how to
throw a raucous party. If you can deal with the
sticky floors and questionable smells, it's a fun
way to usher in the new academic year.

7 Mausoleum Party (fall quarter)

The only time students are allowed to get
funky with the ghouls and ghosts of Stanford's
past at our namesake's crypt. Creepy, huh?

8 Nomad Party (KA, spring quarter)

What better way to finish off the school year
than with a keg stand in Meyer Library? This
Stanford staple is essentially a drunk parade
across campus no more, no less.

9 Latenite @ Lakeside (9:30 p.m. - 2 a.m.

Sunday-Thursday)

With such tantalizing snacks as chicken strips
a-fire, shrimp fried rice and chocolate milkshakes,
there's no finer means of satiating your midnight
munchies than Lag's greasy late night fare.

10 Happy Hour (EBF, Wednesday nights)

For the more alternative crowd, EBF's Fiappy
Hour combines the perfect amount of chill
conversation and electric music to satisfy even
the hippest hipster.

From the first night of freshman year to jam sessions with the band, fountain hopping No.2
on our list is a common way for Stanford students to take advantage of the California weather.
