## Chen usurps Ngai, named fearless leader The 						Daily elects Vol. 245 editor in chief 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
George Chen 'l5 of Middle-of-
Nowhere, N.Y., was elected Eternal Glorious
Supreme Leader of The Stanford Daily last
night, eking out a narrow victory over Seattle
Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman 'lO.

Chen celebrated his victory with the
dinner of champions a house salad and a
Muscle Milk Light from The Treehouse

and a distance swimming workout. Chen,
dedicated the win to his girlfriend, Lennay
Kekua 'l3 among chants of "U Mad Bro?"
Chen's running mate, Marshall "Dick
Cheney" Watkins, celebrated separately with
his family at Augusta National Golf Club.

Watkins mumbled something about extraor
dinary rendition between sips of whiskey and
puffs on a Cuban cigar.
Though most of the night was spent in
celebration, there were some immediate
concerns within the new leadership.
"I'm worried," Chen said after his victo
ry speech. "With the Patriots taking on the
Broncos Sunday, I wanted to save all of my
good karma for Tom Brady. If the Pats lose, I'll
never forgive myself for allowing my ambi
tions to get in the way of destiny."
Football Editor Joseph Beyda has high
hopes of Chen's ability to affect change. Ac
cording to Beyda, Chen is in talks to expand
the Stanford football season to a 12-month
schedule, which will allow the Cardinal to
fully expand and diversify its offensive attack
and increase The Daily's site hits.
Chen has ambitions of expanding the in
vestigative journalism department of The
Daily. To do this, Chen's platform emphasizes
teaming up with student politicians to find
new ways of incentivizing writers to do inves
tigative journalism. Chen is also a proponent
of long-form journalism in general.
"Goodbye to the days of the 500-,
1,000- or even 5,000-word story," Chen said.
"Every story in The Daily will be at least
15,000 words long especially the swim
ming recaps."

Managing Editor of Sports Sam Fisher
'l4, Managing Editor of the Weekend Edition
Molly Vorwerck 'l4 and co-Managing Editors
of Copy Willa Brock 'l4 and Charlotte Wayne
'l4 reacted to the news by announcing their
retirements from The Daily.
"We swallowed our pride for one vol
ume of working under a junior," the seniors
said in a statement, "but the thought of
working for another junior, especially some
one who looks as young as George, for the re
mainder of our careers was too much to
bear."

Willie "Derek Mason" Shaw also left for
greener pastures when he heard of George's
election, accepting the head coaching job at
Vanderbilt. The over/under on when Chen
realizes has been set at four months.

George Chen '15 celebrated his election by
chugging a Muscle Milk Light and leaving
the office early to go for a swim. It was the
only time he has ever left the office.
There has been one key recruit by the
Chen administration. Alice Phillips 'l5 re
turned early from a sabbatical in Oxford to
team up with Chen as head copy editor. De
spite her in-depth research in Oxford, Phillips
has decided The Daily will continue to not use
Oxford commas.

The departing Editor in Chief, Edward
Ngai 'l5, had little to say about his successor.

When informed of Chen's election, a red-eyed
Ngai continued to shovel underseasoned Tree
house chips into his mouth.
Richard Sherman did not return repeated
phone messages requesting comment for this
article. He did release a statement through the
Seahawks public relations staff: "When you ad
dress me, address me as Richard Sherman, All-
Pro and Stanford Graduate, two things George
Chen will never be able to achieve."
