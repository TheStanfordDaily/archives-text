# OPINIONS
## To Be Everything At Once 
### Chan Chi Ling 
When I ask Stanford stu
dents why they do the
things they do, their an
swers invariably fall under one of
these categories: 1) they don't have
a choice (tuition is insane these
days); 2) they simply love doing it
and that's reason enough; 3) they
are "keeping their options open." In
creasingly I am hearing more of the
third, perhaps because Stanford stu
dents live in a beckoning world with
so many opportunities, they natural
ly want to make the most of them.
After all, since day one of freshman
year we have been told over and
over to the point of becoming trite
to explore, to try new things, to
be unafraid of reimagining yourself.
It's an uplifting message to start a
starry-eyed, confused freshman on
her exploration. I remember how it
was when I first got to Stanford two
years ago, feeling overwhelmed by
the dizzying spread of everything
on offer. Waltzing through activities
fair convinced me I'd need three
lifetimes, maybe more, to fully ex
perience Stanford. And there was
the unmistakable sense of optimism
in the air, the eucalyptic scent of
possibilities. Something was chang
ing, and you felt like you could be
come anybody you wanted to be.
Or to be everything at once.
Lenka's song could well be the
theme song of most Stanford stu
dents: "All I wanna be/ all I wanna
be, oh/ All I wanna be is every
thing."

The one word that would come to
characterize most people's fresh
man year I said "most people"
because there are always the Type-
A kids who knew they wanted to be
Mr. President the first day they
learned to spell the word "ambi
tion" is "trying." Trying out for a
new club, trying a new class, trying
to find the self, whatever that last
one means.

And Stanford does give us a lot

of room to try, and try again. Silicon
Valley logic of "failing faster failing
often" doesn't apply; we live in
what is probably the most protec
tive bubble you could find on earth.
So, when I hear people want
ing to "keep their options open," I
wonder why some of us are still
working so hard to put off choosing,
even in such a protected environ
ment.

Two reasons come to mind.
The first is quite understandable:
you haven't found something you're
willing to bet on, to commit to,
something you believe in enough to
dedicate your time to. In the mean
time, keep exploring until you hit
on something that's really up your
alley. Some people spend their
whole life exploring, and with some
luck you might find something you
love.

The second reason confounds me:
you think you have found your call
ing, but you want to hold off pursu
ing it because you need to "keep
your options open" options have
become things that are good in and
of themselves.
I met a friend at a recruitment
event recently. Dressed up in a
spiffy suit, he told me he wanted to
be a consultant.

"What happened to your plan
of becoming a teacher? I thought
you were going to fix the broken ed
ucation system!"
"Eventually, eventually. For
now I will keep my options open."
I was starting to understand
that it is a matter of strategy â€”be-
cause, as the investment banker will
tell you, putting all your eggs into
one basket is much riskier than if
you spread it out across different in
vestment options.

"But life is not an investment
decision, and you only live once!" I
wanted to tell him, "How long are
you going to postpone living up to
what you believe in because of some

nebulous 'option' in the offing?"

I held back; after all, there is re
ally nothing wrong with wanting to
be a consultant, but I walked away
from the conversation feeling slight
ly perturbed. I wondered if being in
an elite institution actually makes it
harder to find your true calling, be
cause saying that you want to be a
great full-time mother, or the
teacher who would make math fun
for kids doesn't seem that great of a
return to a 60k per-annum invest
ment.

We are probably better off with
more options than fewer, but I also
can't help noticing how "keeping
your options open" could, more
than anything, betray an intense fear
of failure. Instead of dedicating our
efforts to doing something whole
heartedly, we make a series of tepid
commitments and hope the "op
tions" they yield come to some
thing.

Some call this playing smart,
but this could also be timidity: be
cause we have never experienced

anything other than success, our
sense of self has been built around
our ability to succeed, and the
chance of failure is just terrifying.
Instead of being committed to a per
sonal vision, or an idea, we grow to
be committed to "success"

which in our society has very stan
dard definitions and end up
telling ourselves that our personal
calling can wait.
Can it really? I am inclined to
think that as we grow older, every
decision we make starts narrowing
our window of possibilities: if you de
cide, for instance, to be a pre-med to
day, the possibility of being a concert
pianist 10 years down the road is, by
the most optimistic gauge, slim.
Keeping your options open give
you the illusion that we can be
everything at once, but at some
point you will need to make a
choice. You can love Lenka's song,
but you can't be everything at once:
you have to decide who you are and
who you are not.
And because every decision

you make necessarily closes off
doors, your true calling could well
end up being outside your universe
of possibilities, or a forgotten dream.
It is in this way that Stanford, for all
the possibilities it opens students to,
can be paradoxically so limiting.

I do believe there is such a
thing as a true calling, and it will find
those who can say a hundred Noes
for the sake of an overwhelming Yes.
Sometimes what we need is not
more options, but steadfast commit
ment and sheer perseverance to
stand behind what we believe in.

The biggest tragedy, to my
mind, is to graduate from Stanford
with many achievements but little
experience, great success but no
vision. And there is little chance
we can figure out what we actually
believe in if we spend all that time
laying out exit routes before we
even find an entrance.
