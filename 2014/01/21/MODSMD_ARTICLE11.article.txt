# The
						downfall of the one-player show

### Ashley Westhem 
A friend of mine on the
women's crew team
recently told me that
her favorite part of
rowing is that there
cannot be a superstar on the team;
everyone is relied upon equally to ef
fectively power the boat across the
water. If one person messes up and
gets a "crab," the whole boat is affect
ed. This is why it's imperative that all
rowers work together and each takes
accountability for her actions.
Of course there is going to be a
more high-profile rower on each team
the rower that is always in the top
boat, gets the best split times and is
looked to for leadership. However,
that one rower does not have the
power to make or break a race.
This led me to question whether
all other sports depend on a superstar
to drive the team. In sports like bas
ketball, soccer, baseball and water po
lo, for example, one is able to look at
statistics to determine success and
ability: the player with the most
points, rebounds, goals or saves.
These players are typically the ones
who are relied upon to create the
greatest offensive output and will
lead the team to victory or failure.

Rowing is unique because that
much pressure and expectation can
not be placed on one teammate. But
are teams that rely so heavily upon
one athlete ever successful in the long
ran? I don't think they can be.
After the Stanford women's bas
ketball team dismantled Arizona on
Friday night, I realized that one play
er like senior All-American
Chiney Ogwumike can only carry
a team up to a certain point. After
that, it becomes necessary to get help
from elsewhere in order to find long
term success.
All 15 members of the squad
played on Friday, with scoring coming
from 10 different players, three of
whom scored in double digits.
"It was nice to get a lot of people
in the game and have them con
tribute," said head coach Tara Yan-
Derveer. "Chiney always plays well
for us, but she's very unselfish and
she knows she needs other people to
play well around her."
This mentality represents a key
change from last season. Last year's
team was a one-trick pony with Og
wumike leading the way, and point
guard Amber Orrange picking up the
slack towards the end of the season.
The Card won the Pac-12 conference
and tournament titles but fell short of
what would have been its sixth Final
Four appearance when it lost in the
NCAA Sweet 16.
One player cannot propel a team
all the way. With Ogwumike playing
up to the standards of national player
of the year and multiple teammates
stepping up and doing damage as
well, the Card has dominated every
game it has played this season a
loss at No. 1 Connecticut aside and
is expected to get much deeper into
the NCAA tournament this season.
But what about Michael Jordan
and Kobe Bryant? The Lakers have
fallen apart without Kobe, so he must
have been the only glue holding the
team together, right? But remember
that Kobe always had an experienced
team behind him when the Lakers
won the NBA championship Shaq,
Derek Fisher, Pau Gasol, Robert
Horry Horace Grant.
And look at Lebron James. It
wasn't until he moved to the Heat and
joined other superior players, such as
Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade, Shane
Battier, Mario Chalmers and, later
on, Ray Allen, that he got his ring.
There will almost always be a
player who stands out as the best on
the team and leads the way for the
rest; however, he or she can't do it
alone. As rowing has demonstrated,
you may have the best rower in the
nation on your team, but he can't win
a regatta by himself he would just
end up rowing in circles.

Ashley Westhem has been with the
women's basketball team in Ari
zona, all weekend. Ask her about her
block of Tara VanDerveer during
the staff basketball game at awest
hem@ Stanford, edu.

Are teams that
rely so heavily
upon one athlete
ever successful in
the long run?
