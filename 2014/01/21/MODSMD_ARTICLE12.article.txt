# MASON MOVES ON
## Takes helm at Vanderbilt 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's Willie Shaw Director
of Defense Derek Mason has left the
Cardinal to become the next head
coach at Vanderbilt.
Leading up to the Rose Bowl
Game, Mason said he was contacted
about head coach openings at Army
and Connecticut but turned their in
quiries down, stating that he wanted
to stay at Stanford until the right job
opened up for him.
"It's got to be the right job," Ma
son said at a press conference in late
December. "David [Shaw] had his
one right job, and it was Stanford.
And I have mine. That's between me
and my wife, and it's a ways away."
Mason found that right job at
Vanderbilt.
"I am so excited to be at Vander
bilt," Mason said. "This university
combines the best of what's good
about college athletics and academ
ics. We expect to be competitive and
look forward to competing for an
SEC East crown."
Vanderbilt is the second high-pro
file job that Mason interviewed for
last week. When former Louisville

head coach Charlie Strong left to be
come the head coach at Texas, Mason
interviewed to replace him. Then,
when former Vanderbilt head coach
James Franklin left for Penn State,
Mason immediately became a top
candidate to lead the Commodores.
Mason's success with leading the
Cardinal defense over the past three
seasons, in addition to his personality
that fits recruiting perfectly, was
enough to overcome his relative lack
of experience.
Mason, a graduate of Northern
Arizona, spent the first 13 seasons of
his coaching career at non-AQ
schools. Then, after a three-year
stint in the NFL with the Minnesota,
Mason came to Stanford, where he
was the secondary coach in 2010 and
then the defensive coordinator from
2011 to 2013.
Under Mason, the Stanford de
fense improved dramatically. In 2011,
his defense finished in the top 15 in
defensive efficiency. In 2012, oppo
nent scoring dropped from 21.9
points per game to 17.2 points per
game, and the Cardinal led the na
tion in sacks. That defensive im
provement was enough to lead the
Cardinal to a Pac-12 title and Rose
Bowl win, even with Stanford's offen
sive output dropping from 43.2 to
27.9 points per game over that same
stretch.
In 2013, propelled by fifth-year
seniors Shayne Skov, Trent Muiphy

and Ben Gardner, the defense was
stout yet again, allowing only 19
points per game, good for 10th in the
FBS. The Cardinal was even better
against the run, allowing 89.4 yards
per game, the third-best total in the
nation, on an average of 2.9 yards per
carry.
Mason's departure adds to seri
ous concerns about the future of the

Cardinal defense. Five of Stanford's
most decorated starters Gardner,
Murphy, Skov, fifth-year senior de
fensive end Josh Mauro and senior
free safety Ed Reynolds are head
ed to the NFL Draft, leaving many
holes for younger players to fill.

recruiting, has the talent to re
place those seniors, but with
out Mason's guidance, those
ascents just became more dif
ficult.
There is no word yet on
how Stanford head coach
David Shaw plans to replace

Mason on his staff. Shaw has
an abundance of experienced
coaches on the defensive side
of the ball should he decide to
replace Mason internally. One
of his current defensive assis
tants, legendary defensive line
coach Randy Hart, was defen
sive coordinator at Washing
ton from 1995 to 1998. Outside
linebackers coach Lance An
derson, who also serves as ad
missions liaison, is rumored to
be the top candidate with his

experience on defense and
reputation as being one of the
nation's top recruiters.
Inside linebackers coach
David Kotulski, who was a de
fensive coordinator at five dif
ferent stops in his career over
the 21-year period directly
preceding his arrival at Stan
ford in 2012, might have been
a candidate, but coach
ingsearch.com has reported
that Kotulski will join Mason
at Vanderbilt as defensive co

ordinator there.
Even if Shaw does not hire
internally, keeping Anderson
and Hart will be a critical
task for Shaw and whomever
he picks as Mason's replace
ment over the coming weeks.
With National Signing Day
less than three weeks away,
look for the Cardinal to act
quickly.

provement was enough to lead the
Cardinal to a Pac-12 title and Rose
Bowl win, even with Stanford's offen

27.9 points per game over that same
stretch.
In 2013, propelled by fifth-year
seniors Shayne Skov, Trent Muiphy

and Ben Gardner, the defense was
stout yet again, allowing only 19
points per game, good for 10th in the
FBS. The Cardinal was even better
against the run, allowing 89.4 yards
per game, the third-best total in the
nation, on an average of 2.9 yards per
carry.
Mason's departure adds to seri

Cardinal defense. Five of Stanford's
most decorated starters Gardner,
Murphy, Skov, fifth-year senior de
fensive end Josh Mauro and senior
free safety Ed Reynolds are head
ed to the NFL Draft, leaving many
holes for younger players to fill.

There is no word yet on
how Stanford head coach
David Shaw plans to replace

Mason on his staff. Shaw has
an abundance of experienced
coaches on the defensive side
of the ball should he decide to
replace Mason internally. One

nation's top recruiters.

David Kotulski, who was a de

the 21-year period directly

a candidate, but coach

that Kotulski will join Mason

Stanford's Willie Shaw Director
of Defense Derek Mason has left the
Cardinal to become the next head
coach at Vanderbilt.
Leading up to the Rose Bowl
Game, Mason said he was contacted
about head coach openings at Army
and Connecticut but turned their in
quiries down, stating that he wanted
to stay at Stanford until the right job
opened up for him.
"It's got to be the right job," Ma
son said at a press conference in late
December. "David [Shaw] had his
one right job, and it was Stanford.
And I have mine. That's between me
and my wife, and it's a ways away."
Mason found that right job at
Vanderbilt.
"I am so excited to be at Vander
bilt," Mason said. "This university
combines the best of what's good
about college athletics and academ
ics. We expect to be competitive and
look forward to competing for an
SEC East crown."
Vanderbilt is the second high-pro
file job that Mason interviewed for
last week. When former Louisville

head coach Charlie Strong left to be
come the head coach at Texas, Mason
interviewed to replace him. Then,
when former Vanderbilt head coach
James Franklin left for Penn State,
Mason immediately became a top
candidate to lead the Commodores.
Mason's success with leading the
Cardinal defense over the past three
seasons, in addition to his personality
that fits recruiting perfectly, was
enough to overcome his relative lack
of experience.
Mason, a graduate of Northern
Arizona, spent the first 13 seasons of
his coaching career at non-AQ
schools. Then, after a three-year
stint in the NFL with the Minnesota,
Mason came to Stanford, where he
was the secondary coach in 2010 and
then the defensive coordinator from
2011 to 2013.
Under Mason, the Stanford de
fense improved dramatically. In 2011,
his defense finished in the top 15 in
defensive efficiency. In 2012, oppo
nent scoring dropped from 21.9
points per game to 17.2 points per
game, and the Cardinal led the na
tion in sacks. That defensive im
provement was enough to lead the
Cardinal to a Pac-12 title and Rose
Bowl win, even with Stanford's offen
sive output dropping from 43.2 to
27.9 points per game over that same
stretch.
In 2013, propelled by fifth-year
seniors Shayne Skov, Trent Muiphy

and Ben Gardner, the defense was
stout yet again, allowing only 19
