# NFL NOTES
## Sherman steals spotlight 
### VIHAN LAKSHMAN STAFF WRITER 
In 2007, Richard Sherman 'lO
was a budding sophomore wide re
ceiver at Stanford under current
San Francisco 49ers' head coach Jim
Harbaugh. In 2014, as a member of
the Seattle Seahawks, he has solidi
fied his status as the best corner
back in the NFL under Pete Carroll.
In both years 2007 and 2014
Sherman made a crucial play in
the final minutes to determine the
winner of a classic matchup in the
ongoing Harbaugh-Carroll saga.
In the "Biggest Upset Ever"
against USC, Sherman hauled in a
catch in traffic on fourth-and-20
from Stanford quarterback Tavita
Pritchard 'O9 to preserve the Cardi
nal's game-winning touchdown
drive, resulting in a 24-23 win over
Carroll's Trojans.
Six and a half years later, Sher
man, now a defensive star, tipped a
pass from San Francisco 49ers quar
terback Colin Kapernick in the cor
ner of the Seattle end zone where it
was subsequently intercepted by
Seahawks' linebacker Malcolm
Smith. The Seahawks were then
able to run out the clock with a 23-17
lead and punch their ticket to the
Superbowl.
As incredible as Sherman's ef
fort was on the last meaningful play
of the NFC championship game, it
was the last thing anyone wanted to
discuss following the game.
Richard Sherman the trash talk
er just has away of dwarfing
Richard Sherman the player.
In a post-game interview with
Fox's Erin Andrews, Sherman
still full of adrenaline from an ex
tremely emotional contest pro
ceeded to ignore Andrews' question
about his game-winning play and in
stead berated San Francisco receiv
er Michael Crabtree (the intended
receiver of Kaeperniek's final pass)
for "disrespecting him." Sherman
took the time to proclaim that he is,
hands down, "the best corner in the
league."
Sherman's now-famous inter
view immediately exploded on social
media, with some fans calling him a
thug.
In response to these comments,
Sherman penned an essay for
Sports Illustrated, to which he is a
regular contributor, titled "To Those
Who Would Call Me a Thug."
Sherman used the platform to
put his actions into context, stating,
"It was loud. It was in the moment,
and it was just a small part of the
person I am."
Sherman went on to emphasize
the positive impact he has had on
impoverished communities through
his foundation and the contrast be
tween the man he is off the field and
the player he is between the lines.
