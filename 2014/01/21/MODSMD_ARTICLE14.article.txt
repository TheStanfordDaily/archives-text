# Bouncing back with strength
## Third straight win is turning year around 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
With the fans at Maples Pavilion
warming up the atmosphere in prepa
ration for top-ranked Arizona's arrival
in less than two weeks, junior guard
Chasson Randle put on his dancing
shoes, whirling and twirling his way to
a career-high tying 33 points in a Stan
ford 79-67 victory against the Washing
ton Huskies on Saturday night.

Randle, Stanford's leading scorer
this season, carried the Cardinal (12-5,
3-2 Pac-12) offensively for large
stretches of the game, putting his
supreme ball-handling and finishing
skills on full display with repeated
scoring drives to the basket. Washing
ton (11-8, 3-3) simply had no answer
defensively, and, as a result, Stanford

Junior guard Chasson Randle (middle) scored a career-high-tying
33 points during Stanford's victory Saturday against
Washington, cementing his spot as the team's leading scorer.
was able to slowly pull away.
It was Stanford's third con
secutive strong performance
after a disappointing loss to
Oregon State on Jan. 9.
Senior forwards Dwight
Powell and Josh Huestis
were again solid for the Car
dinal in victory, with each
contributing a double-dou

ble. Although Powell was
plagued by the turnover bug,
coughing the ball up six
times, he did finish with 17
points, 10 rebounds and
three assists.
Huestis added a
turnover-free 13-point, 10-
rebound performance, while
also contributing two high
light-reel blocks that delight
ed the crowd. The second
block moved him past Robin
Lopez 'lO for second place all
time on the Stanford career
blocks list. He needs just 11

more to pass Tim Young and
become the all-time leader in
school history.
In defeat, Washington re
ceived 17 points, seven re
bounds and six assists from
freshman point guard Nigel
Williams-Goss, who showed
why he was a McDonald's
All-American coming out of
high school. Shawn Kemp,
Jr., son of the former Seattle
SuperSonics star, added 13
points and six rebounds off
the bench for the Huskies in
the losing effort.

Star guard C.J. Wilcox,
who came into the matchup
averaging 20.3 points per
game, was held in check by
Stanford's Anthony Brown
and the rest of the Cardinal
defense. Wilcox tallied just
nine points of 4-of-13 shoot
ing, marking the first time
this season that the All-Pac
-12 performer was held to
scoring single digits.
"He's one of the best
players in our league," said
Stanford coach Johnny
Dawkins. "I thought the
thing we did well was we
identified him, we tried to
find him as soon as he came
across half court... I thought
our guys did a really good
job of that."
Stanford was hot from
the outset, as it shot 54.2
percent in the first half while
also getting to the line 17
times. Randle's layup two
minutes and 18 seconds into
the game gave the Cardinal
a 7-5 lead, one that it would
not relinquish for the rest of
the game.
In the second half, the

Cardinal was largely suc
cessful in repeating its strat
egy from the first half by ag
gressively attacking the bas
ket, shooting an identical 13-
of-24 from the field while
reaching the line 17 times.
Randle was particularly phe
nomenal in the second
frame, shooting 7-of-8 from
the floor and 4-of-7 from the
line for a 19-point second
half. His deep 3-pointer with
13:40 to play that left his
hand just before the shot
clock expired salvaged a ter
rible offensive possession for
the Cardinal and brought the
crowd to its feet, capping a
night when Randle could do
no wrong.
"We're a ground-and
pound team, whether it's hit
ting the post or driving the
basketball," said Randle,
who was also quick to credit
his teammates. "I think we
played like men tonight. We
were aggressive on both
ends of the floor."
The win for Stanford
moved the Cardinal back
over .500 in conference play

and marked Stanford's first
three-game conference win
streak since Jan. 27-Feb. 3 of
last season, when consecu
tive wins against Utah, Ore
gon and Oregon State also
brought Stanford back over
.500. This time around, the
Cardinal is hoping that the
team's momentum will con
tinue to carry it as Stanford
hits the road this week to
take on UCLA and USC.
The win over Washington
moves the Cardinal into a tie
for fourth place in the confer
ence with its upcoming oppo
nent, the Bruins of UCLA. A
successful week in Los Ange
les could set up a marquee
showdown against top
ranked Arizona on Jan. 29,
the likes of which haven't
been seen in Maples Pavilion
during the Johnny Dawkins
era.
First, the Cardinal must
take care of business down
South, and Stanford knows
that UCLA is no easy task.
