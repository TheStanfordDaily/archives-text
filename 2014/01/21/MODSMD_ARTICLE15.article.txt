# Road kill: desert edition
## Stanford sweeps through Arizona 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's basketball
returned from the road with its sec
ond straight weekend sweep, this
time against Arizona (4-12,0-5 Pac
-12) and No. 19 Arizona State (15-3,
4-2).

Against Arizona on Friday, the
Cardinal set multiple new season
highs with 96 points scored, a 46-
point margin of victory, 40 field
goals made on 63 attempts, 15 3-
pointers made and 32 3-pointers at
tempted when it beat the Wildcats
96-52. Stanford also matched a sea
son high with 28 assists.
A win this big meant that multi
ple players got to contribute, and all
15 players on the roster saw play
ing time for only the second time
this season. Seven different players
hit a 3-pointer in the Card's down
ing of the Wildcats the most in a
single game this season â€”with the
Samuelson sisters combining to go
7-for-14 from behind the arc.
"We're not concerned with who
we're playing, just that we play

well," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "The best thing on this
team is that they keep each other
accountable if there's someone
not playing well, there's someone
right there who can come in and do
well. We have a lot of different
weapons, and they stepped up and
played well."
Senior forward Chiney Ogwu
mike had yet another dominant
game, finishing with 24 points and

12 rebounds (her 12th double-dou
ble of the season). However, it was
not a Chiney-centric game by any
means. Freshman Karlie Samuel
son had an electric night in shooting
with 16 points, while fellow fresh
man Lili Thompson contributed 12
points and tied her career high with
six assists. Although in the begin
ning of the season she seemed to be
a solid backup for junior point
guard Amber Orrange, Thompson
has set herself apart as a shooting
guard and is playing her own game
with consistency and confidence.
"We've been working on work
ing together [as a team] and trying
different things and playing with
the offense," said Thompson. "I've
been starting at [shooting guard]
now for most of the season, so I'm
just starting to adjust into that po
sition."
The Card only had a one-pos
session lead at 15-13 with 14:47 to
play in the first half, but then Stan
ford hit four 3-pointers in consecu
tive possessions as a part of a 26-7
run initiated by a layup from Ogwu
mike.
"[Ogwumike] is a lot more confi
dent [this year-]," said VanDerveer.
"She's got a nice face-up shot, she
rebounds the heck out if it, and she
doesn't force things. I think she
does a really nice job of playing
within herself. To me, she's the best
player in the country hands down."
Ogwumike shot an impressive
92 percent, going 12-for-13 and get-
