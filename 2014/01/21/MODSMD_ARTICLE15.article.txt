## Stanford sweeps through Arizona 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
Stanford women's basketball
returned from the road with its sec
ond straight weekend sweep, this
time against Arizona (4-12,0-5 Pac
-12) and No. 19 Arizona State (15-3,
4-2).

Against Arizona on Friday, the
Cardinal set multiple new season
highs with 96 points scored, a 46-
point margin of victory, 40 field
goals made on 63 attempts, 15 3-
pointers made and 32 3-pointers at
tempted when it beat the Wildcats
96-52. Stanford also matched a sea
son high with 28 assists.
A win this big meant that multi
ple players got to contribute, and all
15 players on the roster saw play
ing time for only the second time
this season. Seven different players
hit a 3-pointer in the Card's down
ing of the Wildcats the most in a
single game this season —with the
Samuelson sisters combining to go
7-for-14 from behind the arc.
"We're not concerned with who
we're playing, just that we play

well," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "The best thing on this
team is that they keep each other
accountable if there's someone
not playing well, there's someone
right there who can come in and do
well. We have a lot of different
weapons, and they stepped up and
played well."
Senior forward Chiney Ogwu
mike had yet another dominant
game, finishing with 24 points and

12 rebounds (her 12th double-dou
ble of the season). However, it was
not a Chiney-centric game by any
means. Freshman Karlie Samuel
son had an electric night in shooting
with 16 points, while fellow fresh
man Lili Thompson contributed 12
points and tied her career high with
six assists. Although in the begin
ning of the season she seemed to be
a solid backup for junior point
guard Amber Orrange, Thompson
has set herself apart as a shooting
guard and is playing her own game
with consistency and confidence.
"We've been working on work
ing together [as a team] and trying
different things and playing with
the offense," said Thompson. "I've
been starting at [shooting guard]
now for most of the season, so I'm
just starting to adjust into that po
sition."
The Card only had a one-pos
session lead at 15-13 with 14:47 to
play in the first half, but then Stan
ford hit four 3-pointers in consecu
tive possessions as a part of a 26-7
run initiated by a layup from Ogwu
mike.
"[Ogwumike] is a lot more confi
dent [this year-]," said VanDerveer.
"She's got a nice face-up shot, she
rebounds the heck out if it, and she
doesn't force things. I think she
does a really nice job of playing
within herself. To me, she's the best
player in the country hands down."
Ogwumike shot an impressive
92 percent, going 12-for-13 and get-

ting the rebound on the one
shot she missed, putting it
back in anyways. Ogwumike
and Thompson have devel
oped a successful two-player
game similar to that of Ogwu
mike and Orrange: Ogwu

jumper, or Thompson or Or
range hits her for the pick and
roll.
"We don't think; we just
make eye contact while play
ing," Thompson said. "It's
been fun, and it's working so
[we'll] stick with it."

After Friday's win, Stan
ford headed to Tempe, where
it took on the No. 19 Arizona
State Sun Devils on Monday.
In the battle of "Fear the
Fork" versus "Fear the
Tree," it was the Tree that
prevailed. After recovering
from a sluggish first half, the
Cardinal capitalized on an
early 9-0 run to beat the Sun
Devils 80-56.
Ogwumike had another
30-point game, grabbing 16
rebounds and dominating
with three blocks. Ogwumike
again had help from multiple
other Cardinal players to
prove that Friday night's
game against a poorly
matched Arizona was not a
fluke Stanford is a much

deeper team than last year
and can consistently rely on
scoring from a multitude of
players, even against top-25
opponents.
Junior forward Taylor
Greenfield came off of the
bench for 14 points, five re
bounds and four assists. The
freshmen continue to be rep
resented well by Thompson
and Samuelson, as they con
tributed 11 points each.
Thompson also dished out
four assists and snatched two
steals.
Stanford and Arizona
State were neck and neck for
most of the first half. Arizona
State controlled the boards
and points in the paint thanks
to freshman Sophie Brunner,
who finished the game with
12 points and 11 rebounds.
The Card came alive in shoot

[we'll] stick with it."

After Friday's win, Stan
ford headed to Tempe, where
it took on the No. 19 Arizona
State Sun Devils on Monday.
In the battle of "Fear the
Fork" versus "Fear the
Tree," it was the Tree that
prevailed. After recovering
from a sluggish first half, the
Cardinal capitalized on an
early 9-0 run to beat the Sun
Devils 80-56.
Ogwumike had another
30-point game, grabbing 16
rebounds and dominating
with three blocks. Ogwumike
again had help from multiple
other Cardinal players to
prove that Friday night's
game against a poorly
matched Arizona was not a
fluke Stanford is a much

deeper team than last year
and can consistently rely on
scoring from a multitude of
players, even against top-25
opponents.
Junior forward Taylor
Greenfield came off of the
bench for 14 points, five re
bounds and four assists. The
freshmen continue to be rep
resented well by Thompson
and Samuelson, as they con
tributed 11 points each.
Thompson also dished out
four assists and snatched two
steals.
Stanford and Arizona
State were neck and neck for
most of the first half. Arizona
State controlled the boards
and points in the paint thanks
to freshman Sophie Brunner,
who finished the game with
12 points and 11 rebounds.
The Card came alive in shoot
ing and intensity in the sec
ond half, however, putting the

Stanford women's basketball
returned from the road with its sec
ond straight weekend sweep, this
time against Arizona (4-12,0-5 Pac
-12) and No. 19 Arizona State (15-3,
4-2).

Against Arizona on Friday, the
Cardinal set multiple new season
highs with 96 points scored, a 46-
point margin of victory, 40 field
goals made on 63 attempts, 15 3-
pointers made and 32 3-pointers at
tempted when it beat the Wildcats
96-52. Stanford also matched a sea
son high with 28 assists.
A win this big meant that multi
ple players got to contribute, and all
15 players on the roster saw play
ing time for only the second time
this season. Seven different players
hit a 3-pointer in the Card's down
ing of the Wildcats the most in a
single game this season —with the
Samuelson sisters combining to go
7-for-14 from behind the arc.
"We're not concerned with who
we're playing, just that we play

well," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "The best thing on this
team is that they keep each other
accountable if there's someone
not playing well, there's someone
right there who can come in and do
well. We have a lot of different
weapons, and they stepped up and
played well."
Senior forward Chiney Ogwu
mike had yet another dominant
game, finishing with 24 points and

12 rebounds (her 12th double-dou
ble of the season). However, it was
not a Chiney-centric game by any
means. Freshman Karlie Samuel
son had an electric night in shooting
with 16 points, while fellow fresh
man Lili Thompson contributed 12
points and tied her career high with
six assists. Although in the begin
ning of the season she seemed to be
a solid backup for junior point
guard Amber Orrange, Thompson
has set herself apart as a shooting
guard and is playing her own game
with consistency and confidence.
"We've been working on work
ing together [as a team] and trying
different things and playing with
the offense," said Thompson. "I've
been starting at [shooting guard]
now for most of the season, so I'm
just starting to adjust into that po
sition."
The Card only had a one-pos
session lead at 15-13 with 14:47 to
play in the first half, but then Stan
