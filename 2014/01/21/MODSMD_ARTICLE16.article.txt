# DIVIDED AND CONQUERED

Stanford women's tennis started off
the regular season with a bang this past
week, collecting three championship tro
phies with its squad split between the
National Collegiate Tennis Classic in In
dian Wells, Calif., and the Freeman Me
morial Invitational in Las Vegas.
The team ranked No. 1 in the
country after capturing the national title
last year and helping secure Stanford's
19th consecutive Director's Cup sent
four players to each competition. Junior

Ellen Tsay took home the singles title at
the Freeman Memorial, while senior
Kristie Ahn won the NCTC singles com
petition as well as the doubles title with
freshman partner Carol Zhao.
Ahn, who is ranked No. 6 in the na
tion for singles and held the team's best
record during autumn competition at 8-
1, beat UCLA junior Chanelle Van
Nguyen 1-6,7-5,7-6 (10-8) in Sunday's fi
nal NCTC singles match, which proved
much tougher for her than the first three
rounds. Ahn already won the USTA/ITA
Northwest Regional Championship this
fall and will look to continue her strong

play as the regular season continues.
Aim also pulled off an impressive
double championship, teaming with
Zhao to defeat Wake Forest's duo of
freshmen Samantha Asch and Luisa
Fernandez. The Cardinal doubles pair is
ranked No. 15 in the country and earned
the NCTC championship in dominant
fashion, winning the final match 6-0.
In Las Vegas, Stanford made an al
most equally impressive run.
Tsay, who is ranked 94th in the na
tion, earned the second singles tourna
ment championship of her career on
Sunday. Her intended opponent, UCLA's
No. 1-ranked Robin Anderson, forfeited
due to illness, and Tsay won by default
after playing three impressive opening
matches to get to the title round.
On the doubles side, Tsay teamed up
with freshman Taylor Davidson (ranked
No. 41 singles) to reach the consolation
championship match. The 16th-ranked
duo was slated to face Duke seniors
Rachel Kahan and Marianne Jodoin, but
the match was not played.
The Cardinal now must prepare for
dual match play, which begins Jan. 24
against UC-Davis. The team has a
packed schedule between now and the
Pac-12 championship in April, but home
court advantage in the majority of
matches should serve Stanford well.
This is a young squad, with five of
eight players in their sophomore or
freshman seasons, and after last year's
impressive finish, these women will have
high expectations for postseason play.
The road to another NCAA champi
onship will begin Friday against UC-
Davis at the Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter. First serve is set for 3 p.m.
