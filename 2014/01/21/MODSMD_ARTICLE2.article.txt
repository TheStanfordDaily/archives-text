# Earlier class start time proposal edited
## Tuesday, Thursday classes to start at 9 a.m., 8:30 a.m. starts still on the table 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
The Office of the University Reg
istrar has made changes and nota
tions to its course-scheduling propos
al addressing student concerns over
8:30 a.m. class start times.
The previous proposal arranged
for classes to start on the half hour
within a grid from 8:30 a.m. until
7:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.
The revised proposal shifts hour

and-a-half long classes on Tuesday
and Thursday down to 9 a.m. and in
cludes a notation that 8:30 a.m. class
times on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday be typically reserved for
labs, discussion sections and lan

departments not to schedule large
undergraduate lectures at 8:30 a.m.

While the registrar does not have the
authority to restrict departments
from pushing large lectures to the
early morning, Shirreffs said there's
no movement from faculty toward
such decisions.
The 8:30 a.m. option remains on
the proposal because there are cer
tain things, such as early morning
discussion section options, that have
to be scheduled early in the morning,
Shirreffs explained.
"We believe that class days will

actually start later for most people,"
Shirreffs said.
He explained that under the lat
est proposal the vast majority of stu
dents taking hour-long classes would
start no earlier than 9:30 a.m. and
those taking hour-and-a-half-long
classes no earlier than 9 a.m.

start time and its effect on sleeping
habits at an October Faculty Senate
meeting.
While Mouzykantskii believes the
registrar reached a consensus on
starting classes later for two of the
live days a week, the proposal still
doesn't go the full way toward what
the ASSU was asking for namely
a 9 a.m. starting time across the
board. He underscored that that the
