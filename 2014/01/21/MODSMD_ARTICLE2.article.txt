# Earlier class start time proposal edited
## Tuesday, Thursday classes to start at 9 a.m., 8:30 a.m. starts still on the table 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
The Office of the University Reg
istrar has made changes and nota
tions to its course-scheduling propos
al addressing student concerns over
8:30 a.m. class start times.
The previous proposal arranged
for classes to start on the half hour
within a grid from 8:30 a.m. until
7:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.
The revised proposal shifts hour

and-a-half long classes on Tuesday
and Thursday down to 9 a.m. and in
cludes a notation that 8:30 a.m. class
times on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday be typically reserved for
labs, discussion sections and lan
guage classes that offer other meet
ing times.
Additionally, Stephen Shirreffs,
associate university registrar, said
that the registrar strongly advises
departments not to schedule large
undergraduate lectures at 8:30 a.m.

While the registrar does not have the
authority to restrict departments
from pushing large lectures to the
early morning, Shirreffs said there's
no movement from faculty toward
such decisions.
The 8:30 a.m. option remains on
the proposal because there are cer
tain things, such as early morning
discussion section options, that have
to be scheduled early in the morning,
Shirreffs explained.
"We believe that class days will

actually start later for most people,"
Shirreffs said.
He explained that under the lat
est proposal the vast majority of stu
dents taking hour-long classes would
start no earlier than 9:30 a.m. and
those taking hour-and-a-half-long
classes no earlier than 9 a.m.
Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6, chair of
the Undergraduate Senate Commu
nications Committee, and ASSU Ex
ecutive Dan Ashton 'l4 had voiced
student concern over the 8:30 a.m.

start time and its effect on sleeping
habits at an October Faculty Senate
meeting.
While Mouzykantskii believes the
registrar reached a consensus on
starting classes later for two of the
live days a week, the proposal still
doesn't go the full way toward what
the ASSU was asking for namely
a 9 a.m. starting time across the
board. He underscored that that the
registrar cannot tell faculty
when to schedule their classes,
so the registrar's office cannot
guarantee that lectures will
not start before 9 a.m.
"It's half a win, and we'll
try to reach out to see
whether the student body
agrees with us," Mouzykantskii
said.
The revised proposal will
be presented to the Commit
tee for Undergraduate Stan
dards and Policies (C-USP)
at the end of the month and
will then be presented at the
Faculty Senate meeting in
February for final approval.
If approved, its implementa
tion would be delayed until
the 2015-16 academic school
year.
"Had we gotten the ap
proval at the beginning of
this year, we thought we
would have had enough time,
but we feel like, especially
given the large discussion
that it's created, we want to
give everybody the opportu
nity to think it through,"
Shirreffs said.
He added the Office of the
University egistrar contin
ues to speak with anyone
that wants to discuss the pro
posal, though he believes all
of the issues that students
raised were answered.
The deans of the under
graduate and graduate
schools commissioned a new
scheduling grid in response to
concerns coming from the
Study on Undergraduate Ed
ucation at Stanford Universi
ty (SUES) report about in
flexible scheduling patterns.
The proposal for a new grid
has been in discussion for the
past two years, according to

Shirreffs.
"Our current classroom
meeting pattern is filled with
structural conflicts that it's
actually highly inflexible,"
Shirreffs said. "It looks
flexible because there are
many more choices, but the
reality is, every time you
make a choice with that pat
tern, you interfere with mul

tiple patterns."
The latest proposed grid
allows faculty to stack up
blocks of time that won't
cause as much interference
with other classes if moved,
given the fewer number of
standardized start times.

meeting pattern is filled with
structural conflicts that it's
actually highly inflexible,"
Shirreffs said. "It looks
flexible because there are
many more choices, but the
reality is, every time you
make a choice with that pat
tern, you interfere with mul

tiple patterns."
The latest proposed grid
allows faculty to stack up
blocks of time that won't
cause as much interference
with other classes if moved,
given the fewer number of
standardized start times.

The revised course schedule includes a notation that
makes 8:30 a.m. classes typically reserved for labs, sections
and languages with other time offerings. If approved,
implementation is set for the 2015-16 academic year.
The Office of the University Reg
istrar has made changes and nota
tions to its course-scheduling propos
al addressing student concerns over
8:30 a.m. class start times.
The previous proposal arranged
for classes to start on the half hour
within a grid from 8:30 a.m. until
7:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.
The revised proposal shifts hour

and-a-half long classes on Tuesday
and Thursday down to 9 a.m. and in
cludes a notation that 8:30 a.m. class
times on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday be typically reserved for
labs, discussion sections and lan
guage classes that offer other meet
ing times.
Additionally, Stephen Shirreffs,
associate university registrar, said
that the registrar strongly advises
departments not to schedule large
undergraduate lectures at 8:30 a.m.

While the registrar does not have the
authority to restrict departments
from pushing large lectures to the
early morning, Shirreffs said there's
no movement from faculty toward
such decisions.
The 8:30 a.m. option remains on
the proposal because there are cer
tain things, such as early morning
discussion section options, that have
to be scheduled early in the morning,
Shirreffs explained.
"We believe that class days will

actually start later for most people,"
Shirreffs said.
He explained that under the lat
est proposal the vast majority of stu
dents taking hour-long classes would
start no earlier than 9:30 a.m. and
those taking hour-and-a-half-long
classes no earlier than 9 a.m.
Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6, chair of
the Undergraduate Senate Commu
nications Committee, and ASSU Ex
ecutive Dan Ashton 'l4 had voiced
student concern over the 8:30 a.m.

start time and its effect on sleeping
habits at an October Faculty Senate
meeting.
While Mouzykantskii believes the
registrar reached a consensus on
starting classes later for two of the
live days a week, the proposal still
doesn't go the full way toward what
the ASSU was asking for namely
a 9 a.m. starting time across the
board. He underscored that that the
registrar cannot tell faculty
when to schedule their classes,
so the registrar's office cannot
guarantee that lectures will
not start before 9 a.m.
"It's half a win, and we'll
try to reach out to see
whether the student body
agrees with us," Mouzykantskii
said.
The revised proposal will
be presented to the Commit
tee for Undergraduate Stan
dards and Policies (C-USP)
at the end of the month and
will then be presented at the
Faculty Senate meeting in
February for final approval.
If approved, its implementa
tion would be delayed until
the 2015-16 academic school
year.
"Had we gotten the ap
proval at the beginning of
this year, we thought we
would have had enough time,
but we feel like, especially
given the large discussion
that it's created, we want to
give everybody the opportu
nity to think it through,"
Shirreffs said.
He added the Office of the
University egistrar contin
ues to speak with anyone
that wants to discuss the pro
posal, though he believes all
of the issues that students
raised were answered.
The deans of the under
graduate and graduate
schools commissioned a new
scheduling grid in response to
concerns coming from the
Study on Undergraduate Ed
ucation at Stanford Universi
ty (SUES) report about in
flexible scheduling patterns.
The proposal for a new grid
has been in discussion for the
past two years, according to

Shirreffs.
"Our current classroom
meeting pattern is filled with
structural conflicts that it's
actually highly inflexible,"
Shirreffs said. "It looks
flexible because there are
many more choices, but the
reality is, every time you
make a choice with that pat
tern, you interfere with mul

tiple patterns."
The latest proposed grid
allows faculty to stack up
blocks of time that won't
cause as much interference
with other classes if moved,
given the fewer number of
standardized start times.
