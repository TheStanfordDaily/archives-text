## Faculty numbers grow in School of H&S 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Due to higher retention rates
and higher yield in searches, the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences has experienced a seven
percent increase in faculty in the
last couple of years, bringing the
total number of full-time faculty
positions to 553 the highest in
its history.
Despite a slight decline just
after the recession, the number
of full-time equivalents (FTEs),
where a half-time faculty mem
ber would count as 0.5, has
grown steadily over the past five
years. According to Richard
Sailer, dean of the school of Hu
manities and Sciences, the num
ber of FTEs in the school has
grown from 514 in September
2009 to 553 in September 2013.
Sailer attributed the increase
to a variety of reasons, including
the decline of departing tenured
faculty and a higher yield of fac
ulty searches.
Before 2010, an average of 13
tenured faculty members de
parted from the University each
year for positions in other insti
tutions, but in the past three
years, fewer than three have de
parted each year. In addition to a
much higher retention rate, the
average percent yield of success
ful faculty searches has grown,
from half to two-thirds of the
searches.
"With fewer faculty leaving
and more faculty accepting of
fers, the size of [the School of
Humanities and Sciences] has

gone up much more dramatically
than anticipated," Sailer said.
The increasing retention rate
and higher search yield of facul
ty are indicative of a higher in
centive for faculty to be working
at Stanford. These reasons
range from the public school sys
tem in the area for faculty with
families to the strong collabora
tions between departments with
in the University.
"I wanted very much to go
back to academia and chose
Stanford for a myriad of rea
sons," said Steven Chu, profes
sor of physics. Chu served as the
12th U.S. Secretary of Energy
from January 2009 to April 2013
before returning to Stanford.
"I love the atmosphere at
Stanford, the interactions I have
here, the collaborations in vari
ous departments and many of
my friends are here. [Returning
to Stanford] was like a sort of
homecoming," Chu added.
The departments within the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences rank high nationally as
well, according to Sailer. In the
U.S. News rankings of graduate
programs, 11 of the departments
are ranked, six of them number
one and none of them ranked be
low five. He also added that less
aggressive faculty hiring from
other peer universities such as
Harvard and Yale due to fi
nancial concerns may also add
to the increased hiring of faculty
at Stanford.
