## Faculty numbers grow in School of H&S 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
Due to higher retention rates
and higher yield in searches, the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences has experienced a seven
percent increase in faculty in the
last couple of years, bringing the
total number of full-time faculty
positions to 553 the highest in
its history.
Despite a slight decline just
after the recession, the number
of full-time equivalents (FTEs),
where a half-time faculty mem
ber would count as 0.5, has
grown steadily over the past five
years. According to Richard
Sailer, dean of the school of Hu
manities and Sciences, the num
ber of FTEs in the school has
grown from 514 in September
2009 to 553 in September 2013.
Sailer attributed the increase
to a variety of reasons, including
the decline of departing tenured
faculty and a higher yield of fac
ulty searches.
Before 2010, an average of 13
tenured faculty members de
parted from the University each
year for positions in other insti
tutions, but in the past three
years, fewer than three have de
parted each year. In addition to a
much higher retention rate, the
average percent yield of success
ful faculty searches has grown,
from half to two-thirds of the
searches.
"With fewer faculty leaving
and more faculty accepting of
fers, the size of [the School of
Humanities and Sciences] has

gone up much more dramatically
than anticipated," Sailer said.
The increasing retention rate
and higher search yield of facul
ty are indicative of a higher in
centive for faculty to be working
at Stanford. These reasons
range from the public school sys
tem in the area for faculty with
families to the strong collabora
tions between departments with
in the University.
"I wanted very much to go
back to academia and chose
Stanford for a myriad of rea
sons," said Steven Chu, profes
sor of physics. Chu served as the
12th U.S. Secretary of Energy
from January 2009 to April 2013
before returning to Stanford.
"I love the atmosphere at
Stanford, the interactions I have
here, the collaborations in vari
ous departments and many of
my friends are here. [Returning
to Stanford] was like a sort of
homecoming," Chu added.
The departments within the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences rank high nationally as
well, according to Sailer. In the
U.S. News rankings of graduate
programs, 11 of the departments
are ranked, six of them number
one and none of them ranked be
low five. He also added that less
aggressive faculty hiring from
other peer universities such as
Harvard and Yale due to fi
nancial concerns may also add
to the increased hiring of faculty
at Stanford.
"Once you're at Stanford, in a


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
sense, you've made it," Sailer said.
"Faculty will get the best graduate
and undergraduates, and faculty
want to teach good students and
have good research support.
"There's a sense that the sci
ence and engineering at Stanford
is the best, and this is the destina
tion university," Sailer added. "So
when [faculty] arrive, they're at
the best place they can hope to be."
However, faculty members do
depart Stanford, and Sailer admit
ted that one of the biggest difficul
ties in retention is being able to
accommodate a spouse or partner
the main reason for faculty who
do leave.
"Housing is hard, too," he
added. "But we do a good job host
ing programs to help faculty get
housing in one of the most expen
sive housing areas."
The growth of the School of
Humanities and Sciences does not
stand alone.
Jim Plummer, dean of the
School of Engineering, stated that

the size of the engineering faculty
has been growing over the past
few years as well, at roughly the
same rate as the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
"The growth has been targeted
at areas like bioengineering,
which is our newest department,
and in growing several of our
smaller departments to critical
mass size," wrote Plummer in an
email to The Daily. Plummer
added that the Computer Science
Department recently has done
quite a fair amount of faculty hir
ing as well, partly due to growing
student demand.
To some administrators, the in
creasing number of faculty in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences is concerning, Sailer said,
because of the burdens on admin
istrative infrastructure and space
and facilities. However, Sailer
doesn't see the high FTE numbers
as particularly disadvantageous.
"There are people who claim
that there is a drawback, but I
don't think so," Sailer said. "If you
have the number-one ranked de
partment, you want to retain it."

before returning to Stanford.
"I love the atmosphere at
Stanford, the interactions I have
here, the collaborations in vari
ous departments and many of
my friends are here. [Returning
to Stanford] was like a sort of
homecoming," Chu added.
The departments within the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences rank high nationally as
well, according to Sailer. In the
U.S. News rankings of graduate
programs, 11 of the departments
are ranked, six of them number
one and none of them ranked be
low five. He also added that less
aggressive faculty hiring from
other peer universities such as
Harvard and Yale due to fi
nancial concerns may also add
to the increased hiring of faculty
at Stanford.
"Once you're at Stanford, in a


VICTOR XU/The Stanford Daily
sense, you've made it," Sailer said.
"Faculty will get the best graduate
and undergraduates, and faculty
want to teach good students and
have good research support.
"There's a sense that the sci
ence and engineering at Stanford
is the best, and this is the destina
tion university," Sailer added. "So
when [faculty] arrive, they're at
the best place they can hope to be."
However, faculty members do
depart Stanford, and Sailer admit
ted that one of the biggest difficul
ties in retention is being able to
accommodate a spouse or partner
the main reason for faculty who
do leave.
"Housing is hard, too," he
added. "But we do a good job host
ing programs to help faculty get
housing in one of the most expen
sive housing areas."
The growth of the School of
Humanities and Sciences does not
stand alone.
Jim Plummer, dean of the
School of Engineering, stated that

the size of the engineering faculty
has been growing over the past
few years as well, at roughly the
same rate as the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
"The growth has been targeted
at areas like bioengineering,
which is our newest department,
and in growing several of our
smaller departments to critical
mass size," wrote Plummer in an
email to The Daily. Plummer
added that the Computer Science
Department recently has done
quite a fair amount of faculty hir
ing as well, partly due to growing
student demand.
To some administrators, the in
creasing number of faculty in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences is concerning, Sailer said,
because of the burdens on admin
istrative infrastructure and space
and facilities. However, Sailer
doesn't see the high FTE numbers
as particularly disadvantageous.
"There are people who claim
that there is a drawback, but I
don't think so," Sailer said. "If you
have the number-one ranked de
partment, you want to retain it."

Due to higher retention rates
and higher yield in searches, the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences has experienced a seven
percent increase in faculty in the
last couple of years, bringing the
total number of full-time faculty
positions to 553 the highest in
its history.
Despite a slight decline just
after the recession, the number
of full-time equivalents (FTEs),
where a half-time faculty mem
ber would count as 0.5, has
grown steadily over the past five
years. According to Richard
Sailer, dean of the school of Hu
manities and Sciences, the num
ber of FTEs in the school has
grown from 514 in September
2009 to 553 in September 2013.
Sailer attributed the increase
to a variety of reasons, including
the decline of departing tenured
faculty and a higher yield of fac
ulty searches.
Before 2010, an average of 13
tenured faculty members de
parted from the University each
year for positions in other insti
tutions, but in the past three
years, fewer than three have de
parted each year. In addition to a
much higher retention rate, the
average percent yield of success
ful faculty searches has grown,
from half to two-thirds of the
searches.
"With fewer faculty leaving
and more faculty accepting of
fers, the size of [the School of
Humanities and Sciences] has

gone up much more dramatically
than anticipated," Sailer said.
The increasing retention rate
and higher search yield of facul
ty are indicative of a higher in
centive for faculty to be working
at Stanford. These reasons
range from the public school sys
tem in the area for faculty with
families to the strong collabora
tions between departments with
in the University.
"I wanted very much to go
back to academia and chose
Stanford for a myriad of rea
sons," said Steven Chu, profes
sor of physics. Chu served as the
12th U.S. Secretary of Energy
from January 2009 to April 2013
before returning to Stanford.
