### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
More than 400 students gath
ered at Cubberley Auditorium
this weekend for the 18th annual
Listen to the Silence conference,
an event intended to bring to
gether activists to discuss issues
affecting the Asian American
community.
"[Listen to the Silence] main
ly came about because Asian
Americans as a community felt
that we didn't have a space
where we could voice issues and
struggles and stuff," said 2014
conference co-chair James
Huynh 'l5. "That's why it's
called Listen to the Silence
listen to this community that has
a history of oppression."
The keynote speakers of this
year's conference, which was
themed around "Art and Ac
tivism," were slam poet and ac
tor Beau Sia and comedian
Kristina Wong, with featured
work by artist Nidhi Chanani.
Conference co-chair Ahn
Truong 'l4 said that the theme
was meant to be more relatable
to participants.
"It's a lot easier for attendees
to empathize with something
they can see or hear or feel, ver
sus you just sitting in a work
shop and listening to this issue

that might be a little far away
from you," Truong explained.
In a profanity-laden speech
that provoked numerous rounds
of laughter and applause from
the audience, Sia talked about

his efforts to find meaning with
in his work and his life.
"All that chasing of external
things, all that running
[around] trying to figure out
who I was through other people

and other people's perception,
in a difficult, difficult way
taught me that I didn't really
understand all of my feelings,"
