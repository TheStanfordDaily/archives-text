### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
More than 400 students gath
ered at Cubberley Auditorium
this weekend for the 18th annual
Listen to the Silence conference,
an event intended to bring to
gether activists to discuss issues
affecting the Asian American
community.
"[Listen to the Silence] main
ly came about because Asian
Americans as a community felt
that we didn't have a space
where we could voice issues and
struggles and stuff," said 2014
conference co-chair James
Huynh 'l5. "That's why it's
called Listen to the Silence
listen to this community that has
a history of oppression."
The keynote speakers of this
year's conference, which was
themed around "Art and Ac
tivism," were slam poet and ac
tor Beau Sia and comedian
Kristina Wong, with featured
work by artist Nidhi Chanani.
Conference co-chair Ahn
Truong 'l4 said that the theme
was meant to be more relatable
to participants.
"It's a lot easier for attendees
to empathize with something
they can see or hear or feel, ver
sus you just sitting in a work
shop and listening to this issue

that might be a little far away
from you," Truong explained.
In a profanity-laden speech
that provoked numerous rounds
of laughter and applause from
the audience, Sia talked about

his efforts to find meaning with
in his work and his life.
"All that chasing of external
things, all that running
[around] trying to figure out
who I was through other people

and other people's perception,
in a difficult, difficult way
taught me that I didn't really
understand all of my feelings,"

The 18th annual Listen to the Silence conference brought together students to discuss issues
affecting the Asian American community. This year's forum was themed around "Art and Activism."
Sia told the audience.
In her address, Wong
spoke about her efforts to
build a foothold in the art
world and gain an audience
for her work.
"We had two keynote
speakers who went up there
and spoke, and it was ab
solutely amazing they
were my favorite speeches of
all the years I've been here,"
Truong said.
Chanani, a San Francis
co-based illustrator and
artist, said that she was ex
cited about the opportunity
to connect to a young audi
ence. According to Chanani,
her goal in life is to make
people happy, something
she believes is a political
act.
"I've also heard a lot
from people how they real
ly appreciate seeing art
work that reflects them, be
cause most of the charac
ters that are in my work
look like me they have
dark skin and dark hair,"

she added. "It's nice to see
artwork that can make you
happy and make you feel
like you are part of it."
In three sessions
throughout the day, activists
and students also hosted
workshops ranging from
"Queer Politics and Queer
Poetry in Modern Singa
pore" to "Artistic Empower
ment Through Korean
Drumming" to "Equipping
Yourself as an Interpreter."
"I don't think there's any
one issue that we give par
ticular attention to, [but] we
represent a bunch of
themes," Truong said. "We
do health issues like mental
health and hepatitis B or
workers' rights and immi
gration rights. There are so
many things [to discuss]."
According to Huynh, the
conference has grown and
attracted more interest
from other schools over the
past several years.
"The cool thing about
[Listen to the Silence] is
that we really strive to find
workshops that equip atten
dees with some skills or
knowledge so that they can
go back into their communi
ties and make the changes

that they want to see,"
Huynh said.
For the first time, this
year's conference also fea
tured "research lightning
talks" in which Stanford stu
dents presented their re
search on topics related to
the Asian and Asian Ameri
can communities.
The event closed with a
concert by performers in
cluding Japanese pop star
and Stanford student Kylee
Saunders 'l6, a capella
group Talisman and dance
group Dil Se.
Amara Tang, a sopho
more from UC-San Diego,
said that her school's Asian
and Pacific Islander Student
Alliance sends a contingent
to the Stanford conference
because of the quality of the
speakers and the workshops.
"We like to promote this
conference every year, and
we make the trip up here
just to come," Tang said.
"It's really important that
groups from all over Califor
nia meet to talk about these
similar issues that we all can
reflect upon."

she believes is a political
act.
"I've also heard a lot
from people how they real
ly appreciate seeing art
work that reflects them, be
cause most of the charac
ters that are in my work
look like me they have
dark skin and dark hair,"

she added. "It's nice to see
artwork that can make you
happy and make you feel
like you are part of it."
In three sessions
throughout the day, activists
and students also hosted
workshops ranging from
"Queer Politics and Queer
Poetry in Modern Singa
pore" to "Artistic Empower
ment Through Korean
Drumming" to "Equipping
Yourself as an Interpreter."
"I don't think there's any
one issue that we give par
ticular attention to, [but] we
represent a bunch of
themes," Truong said. "We
do health issues like mental
health and hepatitis B or
workers' rights and immi
gration rights. There are so
many things [to discuss]."
According to Huynh, the
conference has grown and
attracted more interest
from other schools over the
past several years.
"The cool thing about
[Listen to the Silence] is
that we really strive to find
workshops that equip atten
dees with some skills or
knowledge so that they can
go back into their communi
ties and make the changes

that they want to see,"
Huynh said.
For the first time, this
year's conference also fea
tured "research lightning
talks" in which Stanford stu
dents presented their re
search on topics related to
the Asian and Asian Ameri
can communities.
The event closed with a
concert by performers in
cluding Japanese pop star
and Stanford student Kylee
Saunders 'l6, a capella
group Talisman and dance
group Dil Se.
Amara Tang, a sopho
more from UC-San Diego,
said that her school's Asian
and Pacific Islander Student
Alliance sends a contingent
to the Stanford conference
because of the quality of the
speakers and the workshops.
"We like to promote this
conference every year, and
we make the trip up here
just to come," Tang said.
"It's really important that
groups from all over Califor
nia meet to talk about these
similar issues that we all can
reflect upon."

More than 400 students gath
ered at Cubberley Auditorium
this weekend for the 18th annual
Listen to the Silence conference,
an event intended to bring to
gether activists to discuss issues
affecting the Asian American
community.
"[Listen to the Silence] main
ly came about because Asian
Americans as a community felt
that we didn't have a space
where we could voice issues and
struggles and stuff," said 2014
conference co-chair James
Huynh 'l5. "That's why it's
called Listen to the Silence
listen to this community that has
a history of oppression."
The keynote speakers of this
year's conference, which was
themed around "Art and Ac
tivism," were slam poet and ac
tor Beau Sia and comedian
Kristina Wong, with featured
work by artist Nidhi Chanani.
Conference co-chair Ahn
Truong 'l4 said that the theme
was meant to be more relatable
to participants.
"It's a lot easier for attendees
to empathize with something
they can see or hear or feel, ver
sus you just sitting in a work
shop and listening to this issue

that might be a little far away
from you," Truong explained.
In a profanity-laden speech
that provoked numerous rounds
of laughter and applause from
the audience, Sia talked about

his efforts to find meaning with
in his work and his life.
"All that chasing of external
things, all that running
[around] trying to figure out
who I was through other people

and other people's perception,
in a difficult, difficult way
taught me that I didn't really
understand all of my feelings,"

The 18th annual Listen to the Silence conference brought together students to discuss issues
affecting the Asian American community. This year's forum was themed around "Art and Activism."
Sia told the audience.
In her address, Wong
spoke about her efforts to
build a foothold in the art
world and gain an audience
for her work.
"We had two keynote
speakers who went up there
and spoke, and it was ab
solutely amazing they
were my favorite speeches of
all the years I've been here,"
Truong said.
Chanani, a San Francis
co-based illustrator and
artist, said that she was ex
cited about the opportunity
to connect to a young audi
ence. According to Chanani,
her goal in life is to make
people happy, something
she believes is a political
act.
"I've also heard a lot
from people how they real
ly appreciate seeing art
work that reflects them, be
cause most of the charac
ters that are in my work
look like me they have
dark skin and dark hair,"

she added. "It's nice to see

happy and make you feel
like you are part of it."
