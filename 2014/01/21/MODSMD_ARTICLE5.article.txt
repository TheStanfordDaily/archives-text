Stanford allotted an $850,000 increase in
funding for the Creative Writing Program
this academic year in response to a rise in
course enrollments, according to the 2013-14
University budget. The money will expand
the program's enrollment capacity by funding
additional lectures and classes.
"We are living in an age of participatory
humanities," said Eavan Boland, director of
the Creative Writing Program, a subsidiary of
the English Department.
Despite the long maintenance of a strong
graduate program in creative writing, Boland
said the English Department "hadn't really
figured out its relation to the undergraduate
community" until around 15 years ago. Since
then, enrollment in creative writing courses
has increased dramatically almost 60 per
cent in the past decade, from 479 undergrad
uates in 2002-03 to 802 last year.
In response to the increasing student de
mand, the program has also expanded its
course offerings. There are almost four times
as many creative writing courses this year (23
courses) than there were in the 2002-03 aca
demic year (six courses) and more than twice
as many sections (74 to 34 sections).

A minor history
The boom in popularity began with the in
troduction of the creative writing minor, a six
course minor with concentrations in poetry
and prose, about a decade ago. Today, the mi
nor is one of the most popular minors at Stan
ford, according to Boland.
Boland said that the primary reason why
the Creative Writing Program is so popular is
that it engages students in departments other
than English.
One creative writing class last quarter, for
example, was composed entirely of math ma
jors. According to Boland, 80 percent of stu
dents in creative writing courses were non
majors in Spring 2013, although the numbers
fluctuate each term.
"The more my lecturers are dealing with
CS and math and Hum√üio, the more they're
able to provide a very strong welcome for
these students," Boland said.
