## SBSOK given to Creative Writing 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford allotted an $850,000 increase in
funding for the Creative Writing Program
this academic year in response to a rise in
course enrollments, according to the 2013-14
University budget. The money will expand
the program's enrollment capacity by funding
additional lectures and classes.
"We are living in an age of participatory
humanities," said Eavan Boland, director of
the Creative Writing Program, a subsidiary of
the English Department.
Despite the long maintenance of a strong
graduate program in creative writing, Boland
said the English Department "hadn't really
figured out its relation to the undergraduate
community" until around 15 years ago. Since
then, enrollment in creative writing courses
has increased dramatically almost 60 per
cent in the past decade, from 479 undergrad
uates in 2002-03 to 802 last year.
In response to the increasing student de
mand, the program has also expanded its
course offerings. There are almost four times
as many creative writing courses this year (23
courses) than there were in the 2002-03 aca
demic year (six courses) and more than twice
as many sections (74 to 34 sections).

A minor history
The boom in popularity began with the in
troduction of the creative writing minor, a six
course minor with concentrations in poetry
and prose, about a decade ago. Today, the mi
nor is one of the most popular minors at Stan
ford, according to Boland.
Boland said that the primary reason why
the Creative Writing Program is so popular is
that it engages students in departments other
than English.
One creative writing class last quarter, for
example, was composed entirely of math ma
jors. According to Boland, 80 percent of stu
dents in creative writing courses were non
majors in Spring 2013, although the numbers
fluctuate each term.
"The more my lecturers are dealing with
CS and math and Humßio, the more they're
able to provide a very strong welcome for
these students," Boland said.

She said that the minor
"opened" the department
for students not majoring in
English.
"We set [the minor] up 10
years ago precisely because
we felt that gifted Humßio
students [and] computer
science students wanted to
have this other involve
ment, and we wanted them
to have it," Boland said.
"There are very gifted
students in today's world
who turn to the sciences,"
Boland said. "Many of those
students have always been
creative writers ... It's an
awful thought, to us, that
they would come through
the doors of Stanford and
think, 'Now I've lost that
world.' And the minor was
so that they could think, 'No,
I haven't lost it. I can do
this.'"
Vivian Shen 'l4, a com
puter science major and a
creative writing minor
said she took creative
writing classes for a
change of pace and, since
then, has found her experi
ence to be useful.
"The program is really
well taught and seminars
are different from lecture
based classes that Stanford
offers nowadays, with one
on-one time with teacher
and feedback from class
mates. Everyone can use
something like that whether
you're techie or non techie,"
Shen said.
Shortly after the Univer
sity began offering the mi
nor, the Mohr and Stein
families endowed the Mohr
and Stein Visiting Writers
Program, allowing the Uni
versity to welcome two dis
tinguished writers one in
poetry and one in fiction
to teach a small seminar to
undergraduates.
"The lecturers, who I
couldn't speak highly
enough of, really are the en
gine of innovation and inter
est with the undergradu
ates," Boland said.
Despite its widespread
popularity, the Creative
Writing Program houses six
professors compared to the
more than 30 professors in

the literature office of the
English Department.
Rather than relying on pro
fessors to teach undergrad
uates, instruction in the
Creative Writing Program is
led almost exclusively by
lecturers, visiting writers
and Stegner Fellows.
Started in 2002, the
Levinthal Tutorial, a quar
ter-long mentorship pro
gram that connects under
graduate writers with Steg
ner Fellows, has also been
growing in popularity and
receives more and more ap
plications each year. Boland
said they added a creative
non-fiction option to the tu
torial as student interest in
the genre grew.
The Creative Writing
Program has striven to inno
vate with shifting trends in
creative expression. Boland
said that the program, with
an anti-hierarchical struc
ture, encourages lecturers
to propose and implement
new ideas for engaging stu
dents.
"The lecturers come and
advocate for something, and
basically it's been my expe
rience that they're usually
right," Boland said, "The
lecturers who [teach cre
ative writing to undergradu
ates] have an amazing sense
of how to draw these stu
dents in."
Boland said that creative
writing lecturers have in
creasingly offered classes
which engage new media, in
cluding "Fiction into Film,"
"The Graphic Novel" and
"Literary Media: From
Frankenstein to Facebook."
Additionally, events with in
ventive structures, like the
Four Minute Reading series
initiated by lecturer Tom
Kealey about seven years
ago, attract student involve
ment.
"It is totally our commit
ment and policy to encour
age that innovation because
that's at the heart of really
what the humanities is in
volved in," Boland said.

The future of the Creative
Writing Program
Although this year's cre
ative writing enrollment is
slightly down from the fall
and winter of 2012 (431 ver
sus 483 students enrolled),
Boland anticipates that the
program will continue to

grow over the next five
years.
She predicted that new
general education require
ments which were ap
proved by the Faculty Sen
ate last year for the class of
2017 onward and include a
creative expression compo
nent will motivate stu
dents of all majors to ex
plore creative writing. Ac
cording to the University
budget, the additional
$850,000 in funding is in
tended "to help build capaci
ty in creative expression
[courses]."
To keep class sizes below
15 students, the Creative
Writing Program has always
mediated its enrollment.
The dramatic rise in student
interest has therefore pre
vented some from enrolling
in sections of their choice.
Although Program Adminis
trator Christina Ablaza esti
mated that fewer than 10
students each quarter are
unable to place into a sec
tion, Boland said that even
short waitlists bother her.
"I always want students
not to be waiting," Boland
said, "Basically, I'm an ex
pansionist director. I would
like if we have a waitlist
to put on another course.
We have tried to keep these
things as open as we can."
"We want to spend the
money on student enhance
ment," Boland said. She de
scribed that the additional
funding from the University
would be used to finance
more classes, sections and
events for undergraduates.
Boland also expressed en
thusiasm for forming new in
terdisciplinary partnerships
with other Stanford depart
ments. She said that the Fac
ulty Senate is currently re
viewing a proposal for an in
terdisciplinary computer
science and creative writing
major.
"Today's student isn't
passive; they're activist,"
Boland said, "And we want
that in this program. We
want activism: creative ac
tivism, intellectual activism,
to speak in the classroom, to
read things, to engage them,
to believe that you can enter
this great world of literature
and own it."

Stanford allotted an $850,000 increase in
funding for the Creative Writing Program
this academic year in response to a rise in
course enrollments, according to the 2013-14
University budget. The money will expand
the program's enrollment capacity by funding
additional lectures and classes.
"We are living in an age of participatory
humanities," said Eavan Boland, director of
the Creative Writing Program, a subsidiary of
the English Department.
Despite the long maintenance of a strong
graduate program in creative writing, Boland
said the English Department "hadn't really
figured out its relation to the undergraduate
community" until around 15 years ago. Since
then, enrollment in creative writing courses
has increased dramatically almost 60 per
cent in the past decade, from 479 undergrad
uates in 2002-03 to 802 last year.
In response to the increasing student de
mand, the program has also expanded its
course offerings. There are almost four times
as many creative writing courses this year (23
courses) than there were in the 2002-03 aca
demic year (six courses) and more than twice
as many sections (74 to 34 sections).

A minor history
The boom in popularity began with the in
troduction of the creative writing minor, a six
course minor with concentrations in poetry
and prose, about a decade ago. Today, the mi
nor is one of the most popular minors at Stan
ford, according to Boland.
Boland said that the primary reason why
the Creative Writing Program is so popular is
that it engages students in departments other
than English.
One creative writing class last quarter, for
example, was composed entirely of math ma
jors. According to Boland, 80 percent of stu
dents in creative writing courses were non
majors in Spring 2013, although the numbers
fluctuate each term.
"The more my lecturers are dealing with
CS and math and Humßio, the more they're
able to provide a very strong welcome for
these students," Boland said.

She said that the minor
"opened" the department
for students not majoring in
English.
"We set [the minor] up 10
years ago precisely because
we felt that gifted Humßio
students [and] computer
science students wanted to
have this other involve
ment, and we wanted them
to have it," Boland said.
"There are very gifted
students in today's world
who turn to the sciences,"
Boland said. "Many of those
students have always been
creative writers ... It's an
awful thought, to us, that
they would come through
the doors of Stanford and
think, 'Now I've lost that
world.' And the minor was
so that they could think, 'No,
I haven't lost it. I can do
this.'"
Vivian Shen 'l4, a com
puter science major and a
creative writing minor
said she took creative
writing classes for a
change of pace and, since
then, has found her experi
ence to be useful.
"The program is really
well taught and seminars
are different from lecture
based classes that Stanford
offers nowadays, with one
on-one time with teacher
and feedback from class
mates. Everyone can use
something like that whether
you're techie or non techie,"
Shen said.
Shortly after the Univer
sity began offering the mi
nor, the Mohr and Stein
families endowed the Mohr
and Stein Visiting Writers
Program, allowing the Uni
versity to welcome two dis
tinguished writers one in
poetry and one in fiction
to teach a small seminar to
undergraduates.
"The lecturers, who I
couldn't speak highly
enough of, really are the en
gine of innovation and inter
est with the undergradu
ates," Boland said.
Despite its widespread
popularity, the Creative
Writing Program houses six
professors compared to the
more than 30 professors in

the literature office of the
English Department.
Rather than relying on pro
fessors to teach undergrad
uates, instruction in the
Creative Writing Program is
led almost exclusively by
lecturers, visiting writers
and Stegner Fellows.
Started in 2002, the
Levinthal Tutorial, a quar
ter-long mentorship pro
gram that connects under
graduate writers with Steg
ner Fellows, has also been
growing in popularity and
receives more and more ap
plications each year. Boland
said they added a creative
non-fiction option to the tu
torial as student interest in
the genre grew.
The Creative Writing
Program has striven to inno
vate with shifting trends in
creative expression. Boland
said that the program, with
an anti-hierarchical struc
ture, encourages lecturers
to propose and implement
new ideas for engaging stu
dents.
"The lecturers come and
advocate for something, and
basically it's been my expe
rience that they're usually
right," Boland said, "The
lecturers who [teach cre
ative writing to undergradu
ates] have an amazing sense
of how to draw these stu
dents in."
Boland said that creative
writing lecturers have in
creasingly offered classes
which engage new media, in
cluding "Fiction into Film,"
"The Graphic Novel" and
"Literary Media: From
Frankenstein to Facebook."
Additionally, events with in
ventive structures, like the
Four Minute Reading series
initiated by lecturer Tom
Kealey about seven years
ago, attract student involve
ment.
"It is totally our commit
ment and policy to encour
age that innovation because
that's at the heart of really
what the humanities is in
volved in," Boland said.

The future of the Creative
Writing Program
Although this year's cre
ative writing enrollment is
slightly down from the fall
and winter of 2012 (431 ver
sus 483 students enrolled),
Boland anticipates that the
program will continue to

grow over the next five
years.
She predicted that new
general education require
ments which were ap
proved by the Faculty Sen
ate last year for the class of
2017 onward and include a
creative expression compo
nent will motivate stu
dents of all majors to ex
plore creative writing. Ac
cording to the University
budget, the additional
$850,000 in funding is in
tended "to help build capaci
ty in creative expression
[courses]."
To keep class sizes below
15 students, the Creative
Writing Program has always
mediated its enrollment.
The dramatic rise in student
interest has therefore pre
vented some from enrolling
in sections of their choice.
Although Program Adminis
trator Christina Ablaza esti
mated that fewer than 10
students each quarter are
unable to place into a sec
tion, Boland said that even
short waitlists bother her.
"I always want students
not to be waiting," Boland
said, "Basically, I'm an ex
pansionist director. I would
like if we have a waitlist
to put on another course.
We have tried to keep these
things as open as we can."

budget, the additional
$850,000 in funding is in
tended "to help build capaci
ty in creative expression
[courses]."
To keep class sizes below
15 students, the Creative
Writing Program has always
mediated its enrollment.
The dramatic rise in student
interest has therefore pre
vented some from enrolling
in sections of their choice.
Although Program Adminis
trator Christina Ablaza esti
mated that fewer than 10
students each quarter are
unable to place into a sec
tion, Boland said that even
short waitlists bother her.
"I always want students
not to be waiting," Boland
said, "Basically, I'm an ex
pansionist director. I would
like if we have a waitlist
to put on another course.
We have tried to keep these
things as open as we can."
"We want to spend the
money on student enhance
ment," Boland said. She de
scribed that the additional
funding from the University
would be used to finance
more classes, sections and
events for undergraduates.
Boland also expressed en
thusiasm for forming new in
terdisciplinary partnerships
with other Stanford depart
ments. She said that the Fac
ulty Senate is currently re
viewing a proposal for an in
terdisciplinary computer
science and creative writing
major.
"Today's student isn't
passive; they're activist,"
Boland said, "And we want
that in this program. We
want activism: creative ac
tivism, intellectual activism,
to speak in the classroom, to
read things, to engage them,
to believe that you can enter
this great world of literature
and own it."
