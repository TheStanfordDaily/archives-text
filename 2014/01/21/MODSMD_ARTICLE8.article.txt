## SUPER TUESDAY A
						Culture of (Un) Happiness 
### Nick Ahamed 
Depression "is the leading
cause of disability in the U.S.
for ages 15-44," writes the
National Institute for Mental
Health (NIMH). Roughly 15 million
American adults experience de
pression at least once in a year. An
additional 21 million adults suffer
from depression at least once in
them lifetime. Put it all together,
and the NIMH finds that one in
four Americans has some sort of a
mental disorder.
Young people especially face
challenges. Suicide is the third
leading cause of death for young
people, with 13 deaths by suicide for
every 100,000 people aged 20 to 24.
Clearly, depression is an impor
tant topic for college students. The
National College Health Assess
ment, conducted in spring 2006,
found that 62 percent of students
surveyed had felt hopeless at least
once in the past year. 44 percent had
felt so depressed it was difficult to
function. According to a different
study, more than one third of stu
dents with one or more incidents of
self harm reported that no one else
knew about it.
Stanford is not immune.
A 2008 study found that more
than 38 percent of Stanford stu
dents were experiencing distress at
the time of the survey. Seven per
cent reported having depression.
Additionally, a telephone survey of
Stanford students conducted in
2007-08 found that 33 percent of
students experienced high levels of
stress and that roughly one in eight
students had thought of suicide in
their lifetime.
But it doesn't seem that way.
Not here.
There is a huge emphasis at
Stanford on appealing laid back,
successful and happy. Think back to
the last time you asked a friend how
he was. Did you receive a response
other than "well" or "fine"? The
University expends untold sums of
money to mask the dry fields that
populate the foothills with green
grass and bright flowers. Similarly,
we students live in an apparent par
adise. We've set a standard for each
other where the ideal Stanfordian
has a 4.0, is president of her club,
works out every day and is still
leisurely and stress free.
Yet, this standard is attainable
by no one.
In so doing, we have established
two types of competition: competi
tion with ourselves and competition
with our peers. Comparing our
selves against this impossible ideal,
we create a false binary in which we
either fulfill these impossible condi
tions or we fail. One student in a fo
cus group labeled it "dog-eat-self"
behavior.
With this turmoil boiling on the
inside, we compare ourselves to our
peers, each of whom seems to us to
be fulfilling that ideal. Knowing
this, we engage in a consensual
dance, where one tries to outper
form his partner both academically
and emotionally.
While many members of our
community may be genuinely hap
py, a significant number are not.
The superficial happiness and
leisure espoused only encourages
those with depression or other men
tal disorders to disguise their condi
tion with faux smiles and insincere
ly positive responses. But managing
these emotions can be exhausting
and only serves to perpetuate de
pression.

It's sad that this isolation from
our peers is coupled with isolation
from the administration. When a
fellow student committed suicide in
2012 an event which had a pro
found impact on many in our com
munity we heard almost nothing
from the University. While adminis
trators must respect their students'
privacy, their non-recognition of
mental health issues suggests to us
that these issues are not of concern.
Moreover, our institution has
enormous resources, diverse oppor
tunities and a remarkable environ
ment. Each of us feels incredibly
lucky to be here. This fact, coupled
with unhappiness, makes one feel
guilty: How can I justify feeling
unhappy when I am at such a
beautiful and prestigious uni
versity?
It's okay to feel unhappy.
The University could better ac
knowledge the mental health issues
facing its students and promote
more research into them. The 2008
Task Force on Mental Health and
Well Being was a good start, but be
cause depression and associated
disorders continue to challenge stu
dents, it should become a perennial
study. This would have the added
benefit of allowing the task force to
test solutions' effects over time.
Similarly, the ASSU and the
University could improve resource
coordination. The various institu
tional and student-led groups fo
cused on mental health, such as
Counseling and Psychological Serv
ices (CAPS) and The Bridge, do
amazing work, but they largely act
independently of each other.
Greater collaboration between
these resources could allow stu
dents to benefit from resources that
already exist.
But even now, 15 percent of un
dergraduates and graduate stu
dents use CAPS at least once a year.
CAPS Director Ronald Albucher
believes this increasing number is
because "more and more people are
comfortable accessing the service."
This is the culture we should be
working towards, one that reevalu
ates how we think about being hap
py, one that accepts unhappiness,
depression and anxiety as natural
human emotions. Happiness, put
simply, cannot be measured in aca
demic accomplishment. The Stan
ford Task Force on Mental Health
and Well Being "discovered that ac
ademic success is not a reliable indi
cator of emotional well-being."
The purpose of this University,
as our founding grant says, is to
"qualify its students for personal
success, and direct usefulness in
life." To that end, Jane Stanford
said, "It is the duty of the Universi
ty authorities to send out into the
world students with good physical
health as well as with good mental
attainments, in order that they may
successfully fight the battle of life."
Succeeding at Stanford, and in
life, is not defined by grades or
money. It is about making an impact
on our community. By recognizing
as a student body this fact, as well
as the diverse set of ways happiness
can be attained, we can each find a
way to be individually happy.
I'd like to conclude with a chal
lenge: Next time you ask someone
how they are doing, ask a second
time: "How are you really do
ing?"
