# Technology and Unemployment, Part III: Abolishing the Work-to-Live Paradigm
## 
### Rahul Gupta-Iwasaki 
In the previous two articles of this
series, I described how advanc
ing technology eats away at the
job market from the inside out. What
remain are lower-skill jobs with
wages that may not sustain a family
and skilled jobs whose educational
requirements are far out of reach for
most. Alas are we doomed by our
own genius, destined to the sad fate
of being sidelined by our own cre
ations? Less theatrically: What is it
that we can do to manage the twin
threats of high long-term rates of
unemployment and increasing dis
parities in both wealth and opportu
nity?
The fact of the matter is,
progress is inexorable. Railing
against advancing technology or in
terconnected markets or the pursuit
of profit is neither useful nor helpful.
In this third piece, I would like to
discuss the opportunities I see pro
vided to us in our situation and why
I am hopeful for the future.
As I see it, traditional employ
ment is a broken system that forces
people to occupy their lives with un
interesting tasks. It is a system that
we endure because of societal inertia
and a lack of viable alternatives.
Since our lust for progress and inno
vation is beginning to break that sys
tem, let us not fight the future but
rather seize the chance to embrace a
better system with more fulfilling oc
cupations. Central to this is a funda
mental shift in how we live our lives:
changing from today's work-to-live
paradigm towards one where the
government guarantees a baseline
standard of living.
While jobs provide the wages
people need to avoid living on the
street, they are hardly a source of
satisfaction for most people. Unhap
py workplaces are regularly the sub
ject of ire, and stories of horrible
bosses or coworkers and the like
have become part of modern lore.
Indeed, the popularity of shows like
"The Office" is based on the shared
experience of communal workplace
suffering. A 2008 Towers Perrin

study of over 90,000 workers world
wide discovered that only 21 percent
of employees could be considered
fully invested in their work, while a
full 38 percent were either disen
chanted or totally disengaged. Given
how much of our waking lives are
consumed by work, this is a truly
tragic figure.
For an unfortunately large num
ber of people, work is actually an im
pediment to their hopes and dreams
rather than something enjoyable or
fulfilling. Given that traditional em
ployment is so disliked, we should
use the increased productivity that
technology gives us to enable people
to live comfortably without having to
work.
In his TED talk, "Laws that
Choke Creativity," celebrated
lawyer Lawrence Lessig talks about
an "amateur culture" in which "peo
ple produce for the love of what
they're doing and not for the mon
ey." I call this world "post-employ
ment." Of course, several issues im
mediately present themselves. How
are people going to support them
selves without earning money? And
will people actually be happier if left
to their own devices?
These issues cannot be ignored,
and, coupled with the fact that tech
nologically induced unemployment
can be neither rushed nor preempt
ed, they lead me to suggest the grad
ual adoption of a government-guar
anteed quality of life, or universal
basic income. This will give society
time to adjust to the mindset of indi
viduals working for individuals while
still freeing people to a certain
point from having to support
themselves. Subsequently, the sys
tem will allow people to begin pursu
ing their own interests.
Hardly communism, universal in
come merely considers a baseline
standard of living a human right and
leaves people free to pursue unlimit
ed material gains above and beyond
that. The first stage of this should be
livable unemployment benefits, ap
proached with the economist Loek

Groot's attitude that "what [the un
employed] are doing for us is occu
pying slots... that someone has to oc
cupy in an economy with any appre
ciable level of structural unemploy
ment; and unemployment benefits...
[are] payments to them for that
service." We could all be unem
ployed, so we should take care of the
ones that are.
This solves the problem of re
source cost as it requires only a rela
tively minimal increase in redistribu
tion due to unemployment. It is also
critical because over time, automa
tion is becoming more prevalent, un
employment is rising and fewer hu
mans are working to produce. Since
technology has no need to reap the
benefits of its produce, the excess
value from automation can be cycled
back to humanity through these "un
employment benefits."
This proposal allows for the vol
untarily unemployed, or those early
adopters of post-unemployment, to
live as they wish, while at the same
time not forcing change but rather
simply keeping up with the pace of
automation. Societal attitudes to
wards traditional work will shift on
their own as more and more people
discover the benefits of comfortable
job-free living.
Once automation and correspon
ding unemployment has reached a
critical mass and cultural acceptance
of post-employment has taken root,
finally universal basic income can be
officially adopted, though by this
point it will likely make little differ
ence from the already in-place
scaled unemployment benefits. Peo
ple will be free to pursue their pas
sions rather than strive simply to
survive, while those who still wish to
do so can continue to do business
and advance their own material
wealth beyond the guaranteed base
line. But the freedom is what makes
a fully fulfilling and eternally en
gaged life.
