# Q&A
## WITH ANNE WALKER PROMISING START 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
In advance of the 2011 Stan
ford women's golf season, The
Daily's Cameron Miller spoke
with women's golf head coach
Anne Walker to get perspec
tive on events since the end of
the fall season.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Now
that we're a month removed from

the team's fall schedule, what are
your biggest takeaways from the
four tournaments your team
played?
Anne Walker (AW): Kind of con
firmed what I was thinking as
we're moving into this fall. We
have the talent; we have the play
ers to be the best team in the
country. But we also at the same
time are a very young team, so
what comes with that is some up

and downs. And we had some up
and downs. We played the Univer
sity of Washington, and I think we
could've beaten any team in the
country that week. We smoked
them. But then there are other
weeks, like our final event at
Nanea in Hawaii we were a lit
tle bit tired, a little bit younger.
We finished sixth wasn't our
best.

TSD: Was there a tournament or

individual performance that was of
particular note to you?

AW: Sahalee was. That's an unbe
lievable golf course. That tourna
ment has been there 25-plus years,
and I don't specifically remember a
time when any team finished under
par, and a lot of great teams played
there. We played just absolutely
outstanding, and Mariah's,

Mariko Tumangan's stellar performances at the tournament in Sahalee, Wash., for leading to Cardinal to an impressive finish under par.
Mariko's and Lauren's per
formances were unbeliev
able.

AW: First of all, it's just
great to know that we're that
caliber of team. The national
championship is only one
week —if the team that
showed up at Edean shows
up at the national champi
onship, we're going to be
there until the very last putt
drops. No question. It's
great knowing that's in
there. It's very fun going in
to the offseason, going into
next season knowing that we
have the type of players who
can compete.

TSD: What were your goals
for the team in the fall sea
son, given the NCAA Cham
pionships are more than six
months away? What do you
look for as a coach during
this period?

AW: I'm assessing, knowing
that the championships are
seven, eight months away.
I'm thinking about: "For us
to win the championship,
what needs to be cleaned up?
What do we have to be better
at as a whole as a group
and individually?" This off
season, I gave each player
one or two takeaways from
the fall, observations that I
had. It's difficult in our sport
because in the offseason, I
can't really work with them.
It's almost two and half
months where I can't really
have a lot contact with them.
So I have to rely on their
work ethic and rely that
they'll remember what we
talked about and use those
takeaways.

TSD: Your squad seems to
be a young but experienced
one. Let's turn first to your
sophomores, Mariah Stack
house and Lauren Kim.
What did you think of their

play this fall, and how have
they stepped into bigger
leadership roles?

AW: I felt their play was ter
rific. Actually, I was doing a
little fall wrap-up, and Lau
ren is averaging almost 2.8
shots better [per round]. It
doesn't sound like a lot, but,
in golf, it's huge. Once you
get to that level, even half a
shot [better] is a big deal.
Mariah was averaging 73.2
at this time last year, and
right now she's averaging
71.9, which is massive. So
they were terrific. They
were better players, smarter
players, more mature play
ers. I notice that my expecta
tions for them are sometimes
greater than the average
sophomore. But they are ris
ing to that occasion.

TSD: You also played a cou
ple of freshmen in your line
up this fall. In what ways did
you see them grow during
the four tournaments, and
do you see them playing a
big role during the spring?

AW: I do, yeah. I see Casey
and Quirine being there.
Casey's working on a couple
of things in her swing to
make a little more consistent
clubface control through the
ball. I think that'll help take
away some of her big misses.
And Quirine's just continu
ing to work on confidence.
She's a terrific player, and
she's got all the technical
parts to be the best.
This five, I think, will play
again this spring. I do think
we'll see Marissa Mar in the
lineup, and I wouldn't be sur
prised to see Jisoo and
Danielle in the lineup, either.
But I know that Marissa's
working really hard, she
wants to be in that lineup
very badly she's a senior.
I think she'll come out and
shape things up when we get
back in the spring.

TSD: What has been the
point of emphasis so far dur
ing your team's offseason
work? Is there one overarch

ing theme you've been focus
ing on, or is it very individ
ual-specific?

AW: During our season, we
always come back to short
games. I think the reason
we're a top-10 team right
now is our short game im
provement from last year.
But no two kids have the
same thing they're working
on right now one player's
strength might be another
player's weakness. Mariko is
working on her ability to
play the yardage, meaning
that she has a tendency to hit
a full swing on every club
and the yardage can be a 10-
yard difference. Mariah's not
working on too much other
than her putting. For Mari
ah, that's the conversation
we have ... she's at a level
now where the difference be
tween her and the No. 1 am
ateur in the world is that
player makes one more 10-
footer per round than Mari
ah does. That's really hard to
wrap your head around, but
to get to a place where you
make that 10-foot putt is a
lot of hours of putting.

TSD: Is there anyone on
your squad that we haven't
yet talked about that you be
lieve could play a pivotal role
in your team's success in the
coming months? How do you
feel about your team's depth
at this point?

AW: Great. It's the reason
we're such a good team right
now: We have depth. We're
going to add to that depth in
the next year. That's going to
be my focus as a coach here,
continuing to add to depth
each year. I want to bring in
at least two players I
think it's important in a
sport where you're so indi
vidualized and only five play
ers can travel. If you have a
squad of six and one player
goes down, it's instant. And
so depth is going to continu
ally be my focus as I coach
here at Stanford. But this
year we're in a good spot
with that.

TSD: The Pac-12 conference
has been ultra competitive in
women's golf in recent mem
ory. Do you expect much of
the same this spring? What
are the advantages and dis
advantages of playing in
such a stacked league?

AW: It's hard. So, obviously,
the advantage is we're play
ing with the best teams
every week. I mean, they're
unbelievable. And this year,
USC and UCLA are head
and shoulders above the rest
of the country —we get to
see them a lot, so we're very
familiar with them. The ad
vantage of that is, if we're
right there with them, when
we go outside of our league,
we're probably pretty good.
This disadvantage to that is
when you get beat up every
week, you start to question
yourself, ask yourself: "Are
we good?" And then quickly
you can lose your confidence.
I've tried to hammer that
home with our players: If
we're getting beat by 15, 16
shots against USC and
UCLA, we cannot focus on
that. Because this year

they're historic teams.

TSD: Now looking even past
the spring season, your pro
gram recently added two
signees for the Class of
2018. Talk about what Shan
non and Calli will bring to
the team in the coming
years.

AW: They're two totally dif
ferent kids. First of all,
height wise, Calli is 5-foot-l,
and Shannon is 6-foot. They
bring two very different
things, and I love that.
Shannon comes with just an
unbelievable amount of ex
perience. She's been playing
a high level since she was
12,13,14. She's very experi
enced, done a lot of interna
tional travel. She represent
ed Europe multiple times.
Calli, on the other hand,
Calli is an athlete. She's
played multiple sports, kind
of got into golf late but has
had success with golf.
They have two complete
ly different games: Shannon
is kind of a short hitter and
great short game, and Calli
is one of the longest hitters I

have ever seen and her
short game is really messy.
So they bring totally differ
ent things. What I'm excited
about is I believe I can help
them in different ways. For
Shannon, we can help get
her stronger, get her bigger,
help her hit it a little further,
teach her how to practice
better. And then Calli, I
think we can harness a little
bit of her length and raw tal
ent and teach her how to
have a better short game,
teach her how to work her
way around the golf course.
We're just excited about
the whole thing. There's a re
ally good vibe amongst my
team right now. We love being
together, the kids love being
together, we're working
hard. Everyone's attitude is
really positive, everyone's
engaged. That can only be a
good thing. If we win some
along the way, that'll be
good. But at the end of the
day what's most important is
that we're doing the right
things.
