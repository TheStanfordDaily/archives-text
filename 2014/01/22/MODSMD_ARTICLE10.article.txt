# Q&A
## WITH ANNE WALKER PROMISING START 
### CAMERON MILLER DESK EDITOR 
In advance of the 2011 Stan
ford women's golf season, The
Daily's Cameron Miller spoke
with women's golf head coach
Anne Walker to get perspec
tive on events since the end of
the fall season.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Now
that we're a month removed from

the team's fall schedule, what are
your biggest takeaways from the
four tournaments your team
played?
Anne Walker (AW): Kind of con
firmed what I was thinking as
we're moving into this fall. We
have the talent; we have the play
ers to be the best team in the
country. But we also at the same
time are a very young team, so
what comes with that is some up

and downs. And we had some up
and downs. We played the Univer
sity of Washington, and I think we
could've beaten any team in the
country that week. We smoked
them. But then there are other
weeks, like our final event at
Nanea in Hawaii we were a lit
tle bit tired, a little bit younger.
We finished sixth wasn't our
best.

TSD: Was there a tournament or

individual performance that was of
particular note to you?

AW: Sahalee was. That's an unbe
lievable golf course. That tourna
ment has been there 25-plus years,
and I don't specifically remember a
time when any team finished under
par, and a lot of great teams played
there. We played just absolutely
outstanding, and Mariah's,
