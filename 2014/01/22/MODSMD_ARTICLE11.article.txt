# Vaculik, Modi key victories
## All-around titles lead to two team wins 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
It was a good weekend for Cardi
nal gymnastics, with both the men's
and women's teams putting on a
show in front of the home crowd. On
Saturday, the No. 3 men's squad
took down No. 4 Cal for the second
time in as many weeks. Then, on
Sunday, the No. 12 women's team
picked up a comeback win in a tri
meet with Arizona and Sacramento
State.

For the second straight week,
freshman Akash Modi shined, tak
ing the all-around title. Modi won
the parallel bars in impressive fash
ion with a 15.850, which is the
fourth-highest collegiate score since
2008. The freshman also picked up
the win on the floor with a 15.400 en
route to the all-around victory.
"No matter how good you are in
the junior ranks, there's a transition
period into the senior and collegiate
ranks, and [Modi] hasn't missed a
step," head coach Thom Glielmi told
GoStanford.com. "He's into the
team concept and clearly a big con
tributor."
The Cardinal's big event was the
pommel horse, which saw Stanford
beat Cal 72.250 to 66.150 to take a
lead that it would not relinquish.
Senior Chris Turner picked up the
individual victory with a 15.100 and
Modi finished second with a 14.850,
but the key for Stanford was its
depth. Every player in the Cardi
nal's top five finished with a score
above 14.000, while Cal only had one
gymnast break the 14.000 barrier.
Ihrner also tied for the individual
crown with a 14.950 in the high bars,
matching the score of Cal's Don
Bailey.

Freshman Taylor Seaton earned
an individual title in the vault with a
15.300, a full .200 clear of second
place. Seaton's win helped give the
Cardinal the team victory in the
vault. Stanford won four of the six
events, and kept the margin to a
narrow 0.050 in one of its two losses.
That, paired with domination in the
pommel horse, led Stanford to a
fairly comfortable final margin of
victory.
In Sunday's women's meet, the
Cardinal found itself in a dogfight.
Heading into the final event of the
meet, the floor exercise, Stanford
trailed No. 19 Arizona 146.975 to
146.550. Strong performances from
top to bottom, led by dual 9.925
scores from junior Pauline Hanset

and senior Kristina Vaculik, pro
pelled the Cardinal to a 195.925-
195.850 victory. Sacramento State
finished in third with a final score of
192.450.
Freshman Nicolette McNair, Va
culik, and senior Amanda Spinner
led the Cardinal in the vault, bars
and beam, respectively, demonstrat
ing the balanced depth across all
class years.
Both squads had one all-around
performer. Stanford's Vaculik won
the all-around with a score of
39.425. Vaculik's scores of 9.925 in
both the floor and vault were too
much for Kalliah McCartney
(38.550) of Sacramento State and
