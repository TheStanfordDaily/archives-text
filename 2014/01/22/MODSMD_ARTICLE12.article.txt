## Doubles getting it done CARD DUO TAKES CROWN 
### DYLAN FUGEL STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Cardinal
men's tennis team (1-0, 0-0
Pac-12) continued its strong
start to the season over the
weekend in the annual Sher
wood Cup in Thousand Oaks,
Calif. Two Cardinal players
advanced to the round of 16 in
singles play while the duo of
sophomore Maciek Ro
manowicz and junior John
Morrissey captured the dou
bles title in what was a superb
result for the pair.
The doubles competition
was where Stanford excelled
throughout the weekend's
play, with the team of Ro
manowicz and Morrissey
eventually taking the title
with a hard fought 8-4 victory
over the University of San
Diego team of senior Clarke
Spinosa and freshman Filip
Vittek. The duo had had a se
ries of stellar victories
throughout the Cup, picking
up victories over teams from
USC, UCLA and in what
must have been a tough
match in which to choose a
side for coach John
Whitlinger they took the
semifinals, 8-6, over their fel
low Stanford team of senior
Jamin Ball and sophomore
Trey Strobel.
Other results for the Car
dinal team involved included
freshman Yale Goldberg and
sophomore Anthony Tsodikov
combining to go 1-1 for the
weekend in doubles, while
senior Daniel Ho and junior
Robert Stineman lost 8-2 to
the eventual finalists, Vittek
and Spinosa. The major take-
away from Thousand Oaks for the
Cardinal, however, must have been
the exemplary play of Morrissey
and Romanowicz, a duo that will be
looked upon to help the Cardinal
secure a doubles point in many
matches to come.
In singles play, Morrissey and
Romanowicz paced the team
again, with Morrissey beating
UCLA freshman Ryoto Tachi (6-4,
6-2) and Romanowicz topping No.
70 Max Grant of USC 6-4, ret.
(due to injury.) Morrissey and Ro
manowicz would both lose three
set heartbreakers in the Round of

16. Morrissey fell to USC fresh
man Connor Farren 4-6, 7-5, 6-4,
and Romanowicz lost to UCLA
sophomore Karue Sell, 6-7 (4),
7-5, 6-2.
The other Stanford entrants
lost in the first round, although
some were hamstrung by very
tough draws. Goldberg lost to na
tional No. 1, UCLA senior Clay
Thompson (6-3, 6-1). Ball fell to
eventual singles winner and 11th
ranked UCLA junior Marcos
Giron (7-5, 6-3), and Strobel fell to
USD's Spinosa (6-4, 6-2).
In other results, Stineman, al
though losing in the first round of
the competition, picked up two
wins in the additional matches, in
cluding a 7-6 (4), 6-1 victory over
USC junior Jonny Wang, current
ly No. 67 in the ITA singles rank

ings. Goldberg also rebounded
with a 6-3, 7-6 (5) victory over
UCLA sophomore Ryoto Tachi.
Stanford will now travel to
Seattle to play the Washington
Huskies on Saturday in its Pac-12
opener. The two matches last year
were both closely contested, with
the Cardinal prevailing 4-3 and 4-2
to sweep the season series.
