## SEEING GREEN Oil for Breakfast 
### Holly Moeller 
What did you eat for break
fast this morning? I posed
that question to my Santa
Clara University students last Fri
day during our late-morning lec
ture on the human population and
its many impacts.
I was pleasantly surprised: fully
three quarters of the class had ac
tually eaten something. As to what
they had eaten, their answers were
as variable as they were indicative
of the consumption patterns of the
American population: "Pop-Tarts";
"scrambled eggs"; "cereal". One
girl waved her half-finished energy
drink in the air.
We took a moment to think
about where breakfast - and our
food in general comes from.
How much does it take to feed a
person?
Using modern technology, we
can get about 155 bushels the
equivalent of 18 million calories
of corn off an acre of farmland. A
quick back-of-the-envelope calcula
tion reveals that someone deter
mined to live on corn alone could
get his or her 2,000 calories per day
from as little as 1,700 square feet,
less than a 4-yard sliver of an
American football field.
That doesn't seem like much.
But we hadn't accounted for the
unmistakable fingerprints of fossil
fuel all over those ears of corn
and, as it turns out, the rest of our
food supply.
Modern agriculture relies on
modern technology. We plant and
harvest our crops with the aid of
tractors and combines; we irrigate
them liberally with water pumped
from distant sources that - as we're
about to learn here in California
are just as important to our food
supply as to our skiing season. We
use modern chemistry to produce
nitrogen-rich fertilizers and to
manufacture the pesticides and
herbicides that beat back the
weedy organisms vying to take
over our carefully tended fields.
Then, there's the processing.
Harvested crops are shipped off to
large plants, ground, sifted, mixed,
cooked, baked, and decorated, and
then sealed up in airtight plastic
and foil packaging for distribution
to my students and myselfâ€”of
ten hundreds of miles away from
the 500-acre farm where corn tas
sels might have waved only a few
weeks earlier.
All of these steps require ener
gy. Lots of it. And these days, that
energy comes from fossil fuels
from non-renewable seams of coal
and reservoirs of oil extracted from
progressively less accessible loca
tions beneath the Earth's surface.
As the corn syrup-averse foodie
knows from perusing nutrition facts,
corn and its byproducts are found in
just about everything. Even so, it's
hardly the only thing we eat. Never
theless, modern agriculture employs
the same energy-intensive industrial
practices on almost all of our crops,
and many of our animal husbandry
systems as well.
There's good reason for this: us
ing technology, we've made massive
gains in efficiency. By centralizing
our crop production and taking ad
vantage of breeding programs to
select plants and animals that pro-

duce uniform, high yields, we're al
so able to coordinate our efforts.
While not cost-effective on a small
family farm, tractors on large
farms can harness fossil fuel ener
gy to do the work of dozens of men,
reducing the cost of labor and, by
extension, the cost of the final food
product.
Back in 1900, a third of the Unit
ed States population worked long,
rewarding, but backbreaking hours
on farms. Today, only 1% of our
population grows our entire food
supply.
Though it has sometimes come
at great personal cost, these labor
and time savings have freed up
members of our population to pur
sue other careers some of which
apparently involve sitting in my
Environmental Science course.
And using technology has taken
some of the variability out of agri
culture, enhancing our food securi
ty. Bad year for insect pests? Use
some more pesticide. Dry year?
Pump some more water. Crop fail
ure? Draw on preserved stores or
import from a more fortunate lo
cale.
This technological revolution
was so profound that one of its
founders was awarded the Nobel
Prize in 1970.
Despite its superficial promise,
however, industrial agriculture is
exceptionally perilous. It was de
veloped at a time when oil was
cheap, but the fossil fuels on which
it relies are not renewable re
sources. It took millions of years to
accumulate those energy stores -
and it takes only a few minutes to
peel back the lid of a single-serve
yogurt container and spoon down
its contents in the back of my lec
ture hall.
We're already seeing food prices
climb alongside energy costs. What
happens when we have definitively
passed peak oil? When does run
ning those big tractors and mile
long water lines simply become too
expensive? Sure, we've got our or
ganic farms and buy-fresh-buy-lo
cal initiatives, but they account for
a tiny though growing frac
tion of our food supply.
But one thing is for sure: We
won't be eating oil for breakfast
forever.
