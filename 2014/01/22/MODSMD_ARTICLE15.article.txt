# ANDREWS ASSESSMENT
## One Summer in Peru 
### McKenzie Andrews 
This article is a shameless plug
for the awesome, random op
portunities Stanford has to of
fer. If you only have time to read
this, I urge you to find these oppor
tunities and take advantage of them
as they teach in MEIO4S: Design
Your Stanford, YOSO (you only
Stanford once).
Last summer, I went to Peru
courtesy of the Stanford archaeolo
gy department, and it was extraor
dinary. As Colin Powell once said,
"It is important for American stu
dents to learn other languages, ex
perience foreign cultures and devel
op a broad understanding of global
issues."
I took high school Spanish, but
it's safe to say I had no meaningful
relationships based in the Spanish
language until the summer of 2013.

During this time I was an inden
tured servant in Chavin de Huantar,
Peru. Stanford covered the costs; we
worked 40 to 50 hours a week.
In the day, I worked with Peru
vian archaeologists, rural laborers

and other Peruvian and South
American students. Everyone was
knowledgeable about archaeology; I
didn't even know that Indiana Jones
was an archaeologist until this sum
mer. I met all sorts of people, like
Gaby, a 25-year-old girl from Santia
go who had a nose ring, studied
chemical engineering until switch
ing to archaeology and has now
worked all over South America. She
told me about her novio (boyfriend)
and encouraged my crush on my 29-
year-old boss.
My coworkers and I spent eight
hours together a day; being some
one who loves to talk, my Spanish
improved a lot. In any given class
room at Stanford, there's one na
tive-Spanish speaking professor for

every five to 15 students.
While doing manual labor in
Peru, it was five Spanish
speakers and me in our unit.
We were working 45 hours a
week in the field, as opposed
to maybe five hours a week in
school.
Oftentimes, the best
learning happens out in the
real world. Words like car
retilla (wheelbarrow), ce
ramica (ceramic) and hue
so (bone) became more famil
iar in Spanish than English.
Rather than by studying a
vocabulary list, brichero, the
word for a Peruvian man who
goes after the foreign
gringa (white, generally
American) girls, stuck in my
memory after laughing about
a Stanford girl and a Peru
vian archaeologist's drunken
weekend hookup. We also
joked about another Peru
vian's mysterious pasado
bianco (white past), which
seemed to be a theme with
the male archaeologists who
had spent enough field sea
sons working with Stanford
students at Chavin.
We also witnessed the cor
ruption in Peru. A Stanford
friend stated that Peruvians'
favorite pasttime is telling
him what's wrong with their
country. Our first Friday in
Chavin, a small bus carry
ing mothers and their chil
dren drove off an unpaid
mountain road which more
two million dollars had been
ostensibly spent to pave.
The car tumbled a quarter of
a mile down the mountain
side: the accident was visible

from our site.
After a stunned silence
that lasted several long min
utes, the men started to run
to the mountain. One student,
a Boy Scout and freshman
dorm friend who encouraged
me to come to Chavin, helped
the Peruvians carry up the
bloodied, dead and dying
bodies up the mountainside.
Over 20 people died. This was
real in away I hadn't experi
enced in my freshman dorm.
That first weekend, we
gathered in mourning and to
discuss the tragedy. We
passed a bottle of rum and
coke: it was our way to numb
ourselves. I'd never seen al
cohol used like this. Agosto, a
head archaeologist and a type
of Peruvian Spartan who
loves "Game of Thrones," de
nounced the mayor who had
embezzled the road money
and thanked my friend for
the help he had given to the
Peruvian people; he was wel
comed as brother to stay with
him anytime he was in Peru.
As I spent more time at
the site, the predominant
Chavin archaeologist political
preference communism
revealed itself. Communism
is a political preference that
reveals to me a deep dissatis
faction with the status quo. I
had never previously debated
with people who were serious
about communism, but this
worldview began to make
more sense as I was exposed
to the world my communist
archaeologist friends had
grown up in. Though I still
don't think communism has
ever worked particularly well
in any country, democracy
has some serious flaws in Pe
ru.
Though I won't be major
ing in archaeology, my time in

Peru left me with hard ques
tions on how to build good
governance in the midst of
corruption and how a lack of
infrastructure can literally
kill in poor countries. Stan
ford provides gateways to a
variety of worlds, and this Pe
ruvian one taught me not just
a lot of Spanish but also how
to think about the world from
a perspective I'd never seri
ously considered.
I went to Peru because I
thought it was what would
stretch my comfort zone the
most; I left tired, more profi
cient in Spanish and incredi
bly grateful for the stability
and security I'd taken for
granted in the United States.
At Stanford, take advantage
of the doors that open for
you. As Dr. Seuss said, "Out
there things can happen, and
frequently do, to people as
brainy and footsy as you."
