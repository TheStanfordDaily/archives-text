# ANDREWS ASSESSMENT
## One Summer in Peru 
### McKenzie Andrews 
This article is a shameless plug
for the awesome, random op
portunities Stanford has to of
fer. If you only have time to read
this, I urge you to find these oppor
tunities and take advantage of them
as they teach in MEIO4S: Design
Your Stanford, YOSO (you only
Stanford once).
Last summer, I went to Peru
courtesy of the Stanford archaeolo
gy department, and it was extraor
dinary. As Colin Powell once said,
"It is important for American stu
dents to learn other languages, ex
perience foreign cultures and devel
op a broad understanding of global
issues."
I took high school Spanish, but
it's safe to say I had no meaningful
relationships based in the Spanish
language until the summer of 2013.

During this time I was an inden
tured servant in Chavin de Huantar,
Peru. Stanford covered the costs; we
worked 40 to 50 hours a week.
In the day, I worked with Peru
vian archaeologists, rural laborers

and other Peruvian and South
American students. Everyone was
knowledgeable about archaeology; I
didn't even know that Indiana Jones
was an archaeologist until this sum
mer. I met all sorts of people, like
Gaby, a 25-year-old girl from Santia
go who had a nose ring, studied
chemical engineering until switch
ing to archaeology and has now
worked all over South America. She
told me about her novio (boyfriend)
and encouraged my crush on my 29-
year-old boss.
My coworkers and I spent eight
hours together a day; being some
one who loves to talk, my Spanish
improved a lot. In any given class
room at Stanford, there's one na
tive-Spanish speaking professor for

Stanford
provides
gateways to a
variety of
worlds.
