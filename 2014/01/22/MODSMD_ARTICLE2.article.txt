### ANDREW VOGELEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 15th Undergraduate Sen
ate passed a bill Tuesday night
that could alter the makeup of the
Senate in the future, as it decided
to reserve three Senate seats for
upperclassmen.
The approval of a constitution

al amendment voted on by the
student body last spring forced
the Senate to pass a bill address
ing the lack of upperclassmen
representatives in the students'
governing body.
With the passage of the bill,
which will take effect in time for
elections this spring, the three up
perclassmen receiving the most

votes will earn a seat on the Sen
ate, provided they receive at least
two-thirds of the votes that the
thirteenth place candidate re
ceived.
"I think this will help in get
ting upperclassmen to run," said
Senate Chair Ben Holston 'l5.
