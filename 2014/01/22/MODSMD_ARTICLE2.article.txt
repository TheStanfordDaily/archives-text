## Senate reserves upperclassmen seats 
### ANDREW VOGELEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 15th Undergraduate Sen
ate passed a bill Tuesday night
that could alter the makeup of the
Senate in the future, as it decided
to reserve three Senate seats for
upperclassmen.
The approval of a constitution

al amendment voted on by the
student body last spring forced
the Senate to pass a bill address
ing the lack of upperclassmen
representatives in the students'
governing body.
With the passage of the bill,
which will take effect in time for
elections this spring, the three up
perclassmen receiving the most

votes will earn a seat on the Sen
ate, provided they receive at least
two-thirds of the votes that the
thirteenth place candidate re
ceived.
"I think this will help in get
ting upperclassmen to run," said
Senate Chair Ben Holston 'l5.

The approval of a constitutional amendment voted on by the student body last spring forced the Senate
to pass a bill addressing the lack of upperclassmen representatives in the students' governing body.
Some senators expressed their
opposition to the amendment ap
proved by the student body, but
noted it was then- duty to pass a bill
fulfilling the student body's wishes.
"I had hesitations last year
about the approval of an upper
classmen quota, but I think this bill
is a good compromise of preventing
certain upperclassmen of taking
advantage of the amendment to
make a mockery of the ASSU,"
Senator Zane Hellmann 'l6 said.
Several senators said that the
bill did not address the bigger issue
of why upperclassmen are not run
ning in the first place, with many
citing the restriction against sena
tors serving while studying abroad
as a reason for fewer upperclass
men running for senate.
"I did not vote for this bill be
cause it does not address the base
problem, which is that upperclass
men are not running for Senate,"
Senator Ryan Matsumoto 'l6 said.
Holston noted that the Senate
would continue its discussion about
the study-abroad restriction, with a
vote on the bill regarding the re
striction potentially occurring
within the next two meetings.
The Senate also made other

preparations for the upcoming
spring elections including the con
firmation of members for the Elec
tions Commission, the committee
that oversees the election process.
The Senate also heard propos
als for Senate Innovation Funds
from two student organizations.
A group of students, known as
Maker's Space, sought money to
create a unified space for creative
activities, proposing to turn unused
space in the second floor of Meyer
Library into an area for artists,
filmmakers, photographers and de
signers.
Stanford Student Space Initia
tive sought funds to continue sev
eral of then- projects, including the
launching of space balloons.
In addition, the Senate passed
$19,566.27 in funding bills.
