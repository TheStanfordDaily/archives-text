# Words spoken from the heart
## SPOKEN WORD COLLECTIVE OFFERS PERFORMANCE-BASED ART WORKSHOPS 
### MADELEINE HAN 
At 8 p.m. last Thursday evening, all
of Stanford seemed silent save for a
small room at Hume, alight with de
bate over whether the poetic illustra
tion at hand was an animal or an arti
cle of clothing.
"It's a sweater!" Evelyn Anderson
'l6, explained. "My metaphor was 'sex
is like an itchy sweater.'" The room
erupted into laughter that trickled out
into a series of soft mmm's and lauda
tory snaps.
The room is the temporary home
of the Spoken Word Collective, a cam
pus group founded in 2002 for stu
dents interested in spoken word poet
ry. On Jan. 16 last week, the Collective
invited students to gather after hours
at the Hume Writing Center for "Up
side Down," their first open workshop
of the quarter.
Spoken word, an art form that
combines performance and the writ
ten word, has developed a larger pres
ence on campus in recent years thanks
to the efforts of groups like the Collec
tive, which has hosted open mics and
quarterly shows.
A workshop, where attendees par
ticipate in exercises ranging from il

lustrating metaphors to writing po
ems, is also part of the Collective's ex
panding effort to bring spoken word
to the larger Stanford community.
Sibel Sayiner 'l5, director of the
Collective, wants to create more than
just a rehearsal arena; instead, she
hopes to create a space for students
with varying amounts of spoken word
experience to try their hand at poetic
release.
"I think a lot of people are natural
writers and don't know it," Sayiner
said. "Everyone, to some extent, en
joys getting a release through art in
some sense."
Several of the students at "Upside
Down" were either returning to or
trying their hand at a new art form.
"Once I am indulged in spoken
word, I feel like myself," said Chasity
Salvador 'l7.
Having done spoken word in high
school, Salvador seems at ease, loung
ing on her seat with pen and paper in
hand. But her relationship with spo
ken word has been a rocky one.
"The emotions I was putting into
spoken word were very negative, and
I was running away from spoken word
