# Words spoken from the heart
## SPOKEN WORD COLLECTIVE OFFERS PERFORMANCE-BASED ART WORKSHOPS 
### MADELEINE HAN 
At 8 p.m. last Thursday evening, all
of Stanford seemed silent save for a
small room at Hume, alight with de
bate over whether the poetic illustra
tion at hand was an animal or an arti
cle of clothing.
"It's a sweater!" Evelyn Anderson
'l6, explained. "My metaphor was 'sex
is like an itchy sweater.'" The room
erupted into laughter that trickled out
into a series of soft mmm's and lauda
tory snaps.
The room is the temporary home
of the Spoken Word Collective, a cam
pus group founded in 2002 for stu
dents interested in spoken word poet
ry. On Jan. 16 last week, the Collective
invited students to gather after hours
at the Hume Writing Center for "Up
side Down," their first open workshop
of the quarter.
Spoken word, an art form that
combines performance and the writ
ten word, has developed a larger pres
ence on campus in recent years thanks
to the efforts of groups like the Collec
tive, which has hosted open mics and
quarterly shows.
A workshop, where attendees par
ticipate in exercises ranging from il

lustrating metaphors to writing po
ems, is also part of the Collective's ex
panding effort to bring spoken word
to the larger Stanford community.
Sibel Sayiner 'l5, director of the
Collective, wants to create more than
just a rehearsal arena; instead, she
hopes to create a space for students
with varying amounts of spoken word
experience to try their hand at poetic
release.
"I think a lot of people are natural
writers and don't know it," Sayiner
said. "Everyone, to some extent, en
joys getting a release through art in
some sense."
Several of the students at "Upside
Down" were either returning to or
trying their hand at a new art form.
"Once I am indulged in spoken
word, I feel like myself," said Chasity
Salvador 'l7.
Having done spoken word in high
school, Salvador seems at ease, loung
ing on her seat with pen and paper in
hand. But her relationship with spo
ken word has been a rocky one.
"The emotions I was putting into
spoken word were very negative, and
I was running away from spoken word
for a while," Salvador explained. "I
was reluctant to attend the work
shop, but I felt the loving atmos
phere I got in high school."
Kyle Michelson 'l5, social chair
of the Collective, also fell "instant
ly in love" with spoken word.
"It's a space where people are
vulnerable," he said. "It's incredi
ble how you'll see Stanford stu
dents going through their entire
quarter and then entering a Collec
tive show and just crying for the
first time in months."
In the words of Tucker Bryant
'l6, a member of the Collective, "at
a place like this, people forget that
they're human beings, not human
doers."
Sayiner expressed hope that the
Collective's outreach efforts will at
tract more students to spoken word.
"Stanford, to me, is a university
of productivity," Sayiner said. "Art

is a different and necessary type of
experience, because suddenly,
you're not a cog in the machine who
is just going through the daily
grind. Instead, you are helping add
your own words to the whole
world."
As the workshop approached its
closing hour, Greeshma So
mashekar 'l6 asked each attendee
to share a piece of writing. The
room grew quiet: belly laughter
subsided into the hum of anticipa
tion the furious click-clacking of
laptop keyboards, the scratching of
a leg bouncing against a sofa as
each attendee exchanged glances
with the next, offering tacit invita
tions to share.
"I'll go first," Somashekar said,
a hesitant smile spreading across
her face. She leaned over her lap
top as the rest of the attendees
leaned towards her to listen. For a
moment, the room held its breath.
Somashekar opened her mouth
and the words began to flow.

they're human beings, not human
doers."
Sayiner expressed hope that the
Collective's outreach efforts will at
tract more students to spoken word.
"Stanford, to me, is a university
of productivity," Sayiner said. "Art

is a different and necessary type of
experience, because suddenly,
you're not a cog in the machine who
is just going through the daily
grind. Instead, you are helping add
your own words to the whole
world."
As the workshop approached its
closing hour, Greeshma So
mashekar 'l6 asked each attendee
to share a piece of writing. The
room grew quiet: belly laughter
subsided into the hum of anticipa
tion the furious click-clacking of
laptop keyboards, the scratching of
a leg bouncing against a sofa as
each attendee exchanged glances
with the next, offering tacit invita
tions to share.
"I'll go first," Somashekar said,
a hesitant smile spreading across
her face. She leaned over her lap
top as the rest of the attendees
leaned towards her to listen. For a
moment, the room held its breath.
Somashekar opened her mouth
and the words began to flow.
