## Graduate students to join in discussions of 27 University Ave. 
### – Baker Tilney 
On Jan. 23, Stanford gradu
ate students working with John
Barton, director of Stanford's
Architecture Program, will
present new concepts for a "21st
Century Research Park" located
at 27 University Avenue.
The site adjacent to the
Caltrain station and currently
occupied by the Mac Arthur
Park restaurant has been un
der consideration for develop
ment and a source of controver
sy for residents since late 2012.
Barton and Palo Alto City
Manager James Keene stress
that the graduate student proj
ect — which began in October
is not linked to the city's deci
sion-making on the future of the
site but that their presentation
at City Hall this week will serve
as an intellectual exercise as fur
ther steps are taken.
In early February, Keene and
his staff will announce their own
ideas for the 4.3-acre plot at 27
University, and the future of the
city itself, as part of their Our
Palo Alto plan.
Critics of previous develop
ment plans for the site are wor
ried about the possibility of rais
ing the current 50-foot building
height limit for proposed office
buildings, and that doing so
would be an eyesore not fitting
with Palo Alto's building style.
There is also worry that resi
dents have not been given
enough say in the development
proposal, which was proposed
by Stanford donor John Arrilla
ga '6O.
