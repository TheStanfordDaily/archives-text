### – Edward Ngai 
Arogyaswami Joseph Paulraj,
professor emeritus of electrical
engineering, has been named the
winner of the 2014 Marconi Soci
ety prize. A pioneer in the field
of wireless technology, his innova
tions have become the backbone of
today's übiquitous Wi-Fi and 4G
systems.
Paulraj is the latest Stanford-af
filiated winner of the Marconi
Prize, awarded to recognize ad
vancements in communications.
Past winners of the $lOO,OOO prize
have included cryptographer Ron
Rivest Ph.D. '74 and Google co
founders Sergey Brin M.S. '95 and

Larry Page M.S. '9B.
"Paulraj has made profound
contributions to wireless technolo
gy, and the resulting benefit to
mankind is indisputable," said Sir
David Payne, chairman of the Mar
coni Society, which administers the
award. "Every Wi-Fi router and
4G phone today uses ... technology
pioneered by him."
Paul, as his colleagues refer to
him, joined the Navy in his native
India after graduating from high
school at 15. While serving, he
taught himself everything from
weapons maintenance to informa
tion theory. After brief stints
studying and researching in India

and the U.K., he came to Stanford
to join the research group of
Thomas Kailath, emeritus profes
sor of engineering.
In 1998, Paulraj founded lospan
Wireless, which established and
developed his research as the core
4G technology. Today, he remains
active supervising postdoctoral
students and serving as a senior
advisor to communications compa
ny Broadcom.
"It has taken the effort of thou
sands of engineers and researchers
...to make this happen," Paulraj
said. "My contribution, in compari
son, is indeed small."
