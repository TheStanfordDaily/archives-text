# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## CHANGING THE GAME IS RICHARD SHERMAN GOOD FOR STANFORD FOOTBALL? 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
After the Seattle Seahawks
beat the San Francisco 4-9ers
in the NFC Championship
game Sunday, all anyone
could talk about was Richard
Sherman 'lO. Sherman made
the play of the game to seal the
Seahawks win, and then he
stole the spotlight with his one
of-a-kind postgame interview.
We asked football writers Win

ston Shi, David Colin and Do
ll young Park: Is the always
polarizing Richard Sherman
good for Stanford football?

Winston: I love Richard Sherman.
I honestly do.
Sherman is one of the best play
ers in football, he's excellent be
yond football, and he's actually a
very thoughtful person, as his
columns written for "Sports Illus
trated" attest. There's plenty of
room for cockiness when you are le

gitimately the best cover corner
back in football. We love our big,
brash trash talkers like Steve
Spurrier, Michael Jordan and
Muhammad Ali why not Sherm?
Wes Welker even made jokes about
Rex Ryan's wife, and people
thought it was funny. Richard Sher
man is a part of what makes sports
so fun.
Would I have given the same
postgame interview as Sherman?
Probably not, but I really won't pil
lory him for it. He was angry, he

was amped, he'd just been part of
the play that took the Seahawks to
the Super Bowl and he'd been able
to do so in classic mano-a-mano
fashion tipping victory from be
tween his opponent's hands right
before his eyes. Sherman beat
Michael Crabtree. Few outcomes
are as stark or as glorious.
Much has been made of the fact
that when Sherman delivered his
on-field tirade, he never swore and

on the program coming to the surface. Many on the Farm are now wondering what effect this coverage will have on the Cardinal program.
looked straight at the camera the
entire time. Some people have la
beled the entire thing an act. I'm
not sure how much I believe that.
While feuds between players
are generally overstated (the real
feuds are almost always the ones
nobody wants to talk about), Sher
man seemed pretty real. Real emo
tion would easily fit the narrative
â€”he was both exhausted and
pumping with adrenaline at the
same time. After Sherman had
time to calm down, he was very
good in the postgame press confer
ence.
Ultimately, though, you have to
admit on some level that Sherman
knows exactly what he's doing.
Sherman doesn't trash-talk Larry
Fitzgerald because Fitzgerald
won't let it affect him. When Crab
tree tried to fight Sherman at
Fitzgerald's charity event over the
summer, Sherman knew he had a
target he could mess with on the
field, one almost impossible to
miss. If Sherman's cockiness con
tributed in any way to the Sea
hawks' victory, I'm sure he'd con
sider it totally worth it.

David: As a university, Stanford
has always prided itself on being an
institution that welcomes studious
and hard-working individuals from

a variety of different backgrounds
and life experiences. While some
people may cast aspersions on
Sherman for his bravado and his
propensity for trash-talking, I be
lieve that if people actually took a
moment to consider his back
ground, more specifically the diffi
culties he had to overcome in order
to accomplish his goals of being a
star in the NFL and receiving his
Stanford degree, they would real
ize that Richard Sherman is great
for Stanford football and for Stan
ford University.
Sherman was raised in Comp
ton, Calif., a community that has
been plagued by gang violence.
Furthermore, Sherman did not
come from money his father still
wakes up at four in the morning for
work to drive a garbage truck while
his mother did tremendous work in
education with disabled students.
As such, Sherman's parents in
stilled in him the importance of
hard work and dedication, and that
such dedication would be the key to
achieving his dreams both on and
off the field.
In turn, Sherman has taken his
parents' message and succeeded at
every stage in his life: In high
school, Richard was the salutatori
an of his graduating class, earning
his football scholarship to Stanford.
On the Farm, Richard graduated
with a B.A. in Communications. On
the football field, he survived a po
sition change after his junior sea
son to immediately become a two
year starter on defense. In the

NFL, Richard has developed into a
two-time first-team All-Pro player
at cornerback.
In short, Sherman's remarkable
story is simply one example of what
someone can achieve when he ap
plies himself. Such a story is at the
heart of the American Dream, and
this story should be the narrative
when the media talks about Sher
man. Although Sherman may make
it difficult for us in the media to fo
cus on his journey, especially when
it is far easier for certain outlets to
draw additional viewers or readers
by simply commenting or "debat
ing" his latest boisterous proclama
tion or "beef" with a particular
player, Sherman's journey to reach
the NFL and his work to stay at
the top of his game is a far better
reflection of the real Richard Sher

man than any overblown attempt at
showmanship.

Do: I'd love to continue my "neigh
borhood dogs" metaphor of last
week's roundtable, but I don't want
to take the risk of the nation's pre
mier "All-Pro Stanford graduate"
finding out that I compared him to
a dog in print. So I'll go ahead and
write a more traditional response
this week.
People love to poke fun at Stan
ford (good-naturedly, I hope) be
cause of Stanford's unique position
in the nation as a premier academ
ic university that excels at compet
ing with the "big boys" in athletics.
My favorite tweet from the NFC
Championship game's aftermath
highlighting this came courtesy of
Fake Sports Center: "Stanford
forced to say f*** it, you're all ad
mitted."
I think that the public's lofty ex
pectations and perceptions of Stan
ford graduates are definitely rea
sons that Sherman has become one
of the most notorious figures in the
game. At first glance, Sherman just
doesn't seem like the kind of man
that would have spent four years at
one of the world's most respected
institutions. He's loud, brash and
arrogant. He doesn't shy away
from conflicts, and, as we saw in his
legendary post-NFC Champi
onship interview, he isn't afraid to
be politically incorrect.
If Sherman hadn't gone to Stan
ford, I'm fairly sure that he would
n't be such a controversial figure.

People would just see him as maybe
another Chad Ochocinco: a talented
player with a strong propensity for
trash talking, but nothing too out of
the ordinary. He would maybe oc
casionally have made the news for
isolated incidents and developed a
reputation.
But it's the Stanford pedigree
that makes people turn twice and
consider him as someone more
than just another athlete with a big
mouth. And I think that's a very,
very good thing for Stanford foot
ball. It makes people realize that
Stanford has more to offer than
rich, old engineers and peppy start
up entrepreneurs.
Regardless of whether it's in a
good or bad context, it makes peo
ple talk about Stanford and helps
Cardinal football continue to
emerge into the public eye. I think
there's a lot of people that realize
there's more to Richard Sherman
than what he chooses to express in
his outspoken manner, which push
es a lot of the bad publicity onto
Sherman, rather than Stanford
football. With that in mind, I firmly
believe that no publicity is bad pub
licity when it comes to the Cardinal
in this scenario.

If Do-Hyoung Park had compared
Richard Sherman to a dog, it would
have been the German Shepard. Let
Do, David and Winston know
which breed you would choose at
dparko27@stanford.edu, dmcohn
@stanford.edu and wshi9l>@Stan
ford. edu, respectively.

Someone
more than just
an athlete with
another big
mouth.
