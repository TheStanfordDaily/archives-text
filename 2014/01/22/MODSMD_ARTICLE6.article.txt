## CHANGING THE GAME IS RICHARD SHERMAN GOOD FOR STANFORD FOOTBALL? 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
After the Seattle Seahawks
beat the San Francisco 4-9ers
in the NFC Championship
game Sunday, all anyone
could talk about was Richard
Sherman 'lO. Sherman made
the play of the game to seal the

the Super Bowl and he'd been able
to do so in classic mano-a-mano
fashion tipping victory from be
tween his opponent's hands right
before his eyes. Sherman beat
Michael Crabtree. Few outcomes
are as stark or as glorious.

that when Sherman delivered his
on-field tirade, he never swore and
