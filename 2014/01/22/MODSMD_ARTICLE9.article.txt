# Sherman redefining boundaries
## 
### Sam Fisher 
"To those who would call me a
thug or worse because I show pas
sion on a football field don't
judge a person's character by what
they do between the lines. Judge a
man by what he does off the field,
what he does for his community,
what he does for his family."
Seattle Seahawks cornerback
Richard Sherman 'lO wrote these
words in response to his now-famous
postgame interview with Fox's Erin
Andrews after the NFC Champi
onship game Sunday. I've been fixat
ed on them, more than the interview
itself, ever since.
Sherman has a point. There is
sufficient precedent that America
can separate a player's on-field and
off-field actions when it judges char
acter. Take Brian Dawkins, for exam
ple.
Dawkins was a nine-time Pro-
Bowl safety for the Philadelphia Ea
gles and Denver Broncos. During
that time, Dawkins developed a rep
utation for being a very dirty player.
One of his most infamous plays, a late
hit that ended Giants wide receiver
Ike Hilliard's 2002 season, drew a
$50,000 fine 10 years ago, well before
player safety became a priority.
But off the field, Dawkins was
and is a model citizen. As a result,
you never hear Dawkins called a
"thug" except maybe by Giants or
Cowboys fans.
Switching between these per
sonas is not an easy task. It is re
markably close to controlled schizo
phrenia. Dawkins created an alter
ego, which he called "Weapon X," to
help with this transition. On the field,
Brian Dawkins is Weapon X, a crea
ture willing to sacrifice blood, sweat
and tears to deliver pain to opposing
receivers. Off the field, Brian
Dawkins is Brian Dawkins, a loving
father, husband and charitable mem
ber of his community.
Another player from Dawkins'
era who was known for his dirty play
is Cincinnati Bengals linebacker
James Harrison. In nine seasons
with the Steelers, Harrison went to
five Pro Bowls. He also picked up
fines totaling six figures for dirty
hits.
Harrison was always defiant in
the face of these fines. Harrison was
never apologetic —he often pro
claimed that he would never change
his style, only increasing the fine to
tals levied on him by the NFL. Har
rison, many fans would say, was a
thug.
Richard Sherman is somewhere
between these two, and that is what
makes him such an interesting case.
Part dominant cornerback, part
WWE wrestler and part Stephen
Colbert, Sherman's character will
never fully be understood by those of
us who do not know him personally.
That doesn't mean we can't try.
From my viewpoint, it doesn't
seem like Sherman is doing anything
radically different than people like
Dawkins. On the football field, he is
about as cocky as they come. Far
away from the football field, he is, by
all accounts, a quality human being.
What is different about Sherman
is that he has moved the boundary
between these two realms. For
Dawkins, the boundary was simply
his helmet. With a helmet on,
Dawkins was Weapon X, but as soon
as he took his helmet off, he went
back to being Dawkins. So by the
time postgame handshakes, inter
views and press conferences began,
Dawkins was back to his normal self,
ready to warm fan's hearts.
Sherman is much more like Col
bert. In his entire football sphere,
from midweek media sessions
through postgame interviews, he is
in character. You have to get him far
away from the field to see the other
Sherman.
This is radically different than
everything else we see in sports, and,
unsurprisingly, America responded
with a corresponding collective shock.
But will that shock be the perma
nent response if Sherman has other
NFL players join him? I really don't
know. Critics, I'm sure, would re
spond that the NFL had become too
much like professional wrestling, and
that players like Sherman were de
grading the integrity of the game. To
be fair, they might be right but
they might also be missing out on
some great entertainment.
In the new world where Twitter
and the non-stop media cycle have
taken over our lives, it only seems
natural that people like Sherman ap
pear. Sure, some athletes will take

advantage of their increased face
time with fans to promote their off
field endeavors. But shouldn't
there also be opportunities for ath
letes to promote their on-field per
sonas 24/7?
The news cycle isn't going to stop,

and people like Sherman could actu
ally keep conversations from getting
painfully stale. I, for one, think that
world sounds a lot more fun.

Sam Fisher is sick of the bombard
ment of silly arguments surround
ing Richard Sherman, so he chose
to take a different approach . Let
him. know if he hit or missed the
mark at safisher@Stanford.edu

Another player from Dawkins'
era who was known for his dirty play
is Cincinnati Bengals linebacker
James Harrison. In nine seasons
with the Steelers, Harrison went to
five Pro Bowls. He also picked up
fines totaling six figures for dirty
hits.
Harrison was always defiant in
the face of these fines. Harrison was
never apologetic —he often pro
claimed that he would never change
his style, only increasing the fine to
tals levied on him by the NFL. Har
rison, many fans would say, was a
thug.
Richard Sherman is somewhere
between these two, and that is what
makes him such an interesting case.
Part dominant cornerback, part
WWE wrestler and part Stephen
Colbert, Sherman's character will
never fully be understood by those of
us who do not know him personally.
That doesn't mean we can't try.
From my viewpoint, it doesn't
seem like Sherman is doing anything
radically different than people like
Dawkins. On the football field, he is
about as cocky as they come. Far
away from the football field, he is, by
all accounts, a quality human being.
What is different about Sherman
is that he has moved the boundary
between these two realms. For
Dawkins, the boundary was simply
his helmet. With a helmet on,
Dawkins was Weapon X, but as soon
as he took his helmet off, he went
back to being Dawkins. So by the
time postgame handshakes, inter
views and press conferences began,
Dawkins was back to his normal self,
ready to warm fan's hearts.
Sherman is much more like Col
bert. In his entire football sphere,
from midweek media sessions
through postgame interviews, he is
in character. You have to get him far
away from the field to see the other
Sherman.
This is radically different than
everything else we see in sports, and,
unsurprisingly, America responded
with a corresponding collective shock.
But will that shock be the perma
nent response if Sherman has other
NFL players join him? I really don't
know. Critics, I'm sure, would re
spond that the NFL had become too
much like professional wrestling, and
that players like Sherman were de
grading the integrity of the game. To
be fair, they might be right but
they might also be missing out on
some great entertainment.
In the new world where Twitter
and the non-stop media cycle have
taken over our lives, it only seems
natural that people like Sherman ap
pear. Sure, some athletes will take

advantage of their increased face
time with fans to promote their off
field endeavors. But shouldn't
there also be opportunities for ath
letes to promote their on-field per
sonas 24/7?
The news cycle isn't going to stop,

and people like Sherman could actu
ally keep conversations from getting
painfully stale. I, for one, think that
world sounds a lot more fun.

Sam Fisher is sick of the bombard
ment of silly arguments surround
ing Richard Sherman, so he chose
to take a different approach . Let

"To those who would call me a
thug or worse because I show pas
sion on a football field don't
judge a person's character by what
they do between the lines. Judge a
man by what he does off the field,
what he does for his community,
what he does for his family."
Seattle Seahawks cornerback
Richard Sherman 'lO wrote these
words in response to his now-famous
postgame interview with Fox's Erin
Andrews after the NFC Champi
onship game Sunday. I've been fixat
ed on them, more than the interview
itself, ever since.
Sherman has a point. There is
sufficient precedent that America
can separate a player's on-field and
off-field actions when it judges char
acter. Take Brian Dawkins, for exam
ple.
Dawkins was a nine-time Pro-
Bowl safety for the Philadelphia Ea
gles and Denver Broncos. During
that time, Dawkins developed a rep
utation for being a very dirty player.
One of his most infamous plays, a late
hit that ended Giants wide receiver
Ike Hilliard's 2002 season, drew a
$50,000 fine 10 years ago, well before
player safety became a priority.
But off the field, Dawkins was
and is a model citizen. As a result,
you never hear Dawkins called a
"thug" except maybe by Giants or
Cowboys fans.
Switching between these per
sonas is not an easy task. It is re
markably close to controlled schizo
phrenia. Dawkins created an alter
ego, which he called "Weapon X," to
help with this transition. On the field,
Brian Dawkins is Weapon X, a crea
ture willing to sacrifice blood, sweat
and tears to deliver pain to opposing
receivers. Off the field, Brian
Dawkins is Brian Dawkins, a loving
father, husband and charitable mem
ber of his community.
