# KEEP IT ROLLING
## UCLA, USC next up for Card 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
When opportunity comes a
knockin', it's usually best to open
the door. The Stanford men's bas
ketball team finds itself on the
verge of a breakthrough, winners
of three straight conference games
and possessors of some newfound
confidence. The Cardinal (12-5, 3-2
Pac-12) will travel to UCLA (14-4,
3-2) and USC (9-9, 0-5) this week
with a chance to extend that win
ning streak, and in the process, do
something the team has never
done during head coach Johnny
Dawkins' tenure on the Farm: win

four straight conference games.
The last time Stanford won four
straight in conference play, it was
late February 2008, and a pair of 7-
foot-tall trees named Lopez
roamed the paint for the Cardinal.
That edition of the Men of Maples
was well on its way to the school's

fifth and most recent Sweet
Sixteen appearance in the NCAA
tournament. It hasn't even been
back to the tournament since. In
other words, four-game conference
winning streaks should be treas
ured and highly sought after.
Despite the team's recent dis

appointments, there is renewed
hope for the Cardinal faithful, even
ahead of a trip to the house of hor
rors that Stanford basketball
knows as Los Angeles. Despite
having dropped 15 of its last 16

GAME NOTES: Stanford has turned its
season around with a three-game win
ning streak after an 0-2 start to Pac-12
play. A road sweep of the Los Angeles
schools this weekend would provide
another boost toward a potential
NCAA tournament bid. The play of
junior guard Chasson Randle, who has
been one of the more productive play
ers in the Pac-12 this season, could be
the key in picking up a big win at
Pauley Pavilion tonight.

games against the Bruins
and Trojans in Los Angeles,
the Cardinal stands a solid
chance of extending its win
ning streak in the days
ahead.
The main reason why is
the play of junior guard Chas
son Randle, who has been
nothing short of scintillating
through the first half of the
season. The Illinois native
ranks third in the conference
in scoring at 19.5 points per
game. He is the only guard
from a major-conference
team to rank in the top 40 in
the country in scoring while
shooting better than 50 per
cent from the field (52.2) and
40 percent from three-point
range (42.0).
"He's been aggressive,
and he's playing like the
young man we recruited,"
Dawkins said. "He's a young
man that can score; he can
find guys and make guys bet
ter, and he's done that for us
this year."
Randle has been the star
of a starting lineup that has
been forced to carry Stanford
so far this season, due in large
part to season-ending injuries
to several key contributors.
All five starters will have to
be at their best if the Cardinal
is going to knock off UCLA,
which is playing its first sea-

son under head coach Steve
Afford.
Stanford's back line of
seniors Dwight Powell,
Josh Huestis and Stefan Nas
tic must do a good job of
protecting the rim and secur
ing defensive rebounds
against the high-scoring Bru
ins, who at 84.4 points per
game rank second in the con
ference in scoring.
Stanford's fifth starter,
senior guard Anthony Brown,
will be tasked with the unen
viable challenge of guarding
UCLAs leading scorer, soph
omore Jordan Adams. If last
Saturday is any indication,
Brown should be up to the
task. He successfully held the
Pac-12's second-leading scor
er, Washington's C.J. Wilcox,
to nine points on 4-of-13
shooting in the Cardinal's
game against the Huskies,
marking Wilcox's lowest scor
ing output of the season.
The Bruins, much like the
Cardinal, feature four double
digit scorers in Adams, all
everything Kyle Anderson
and guards Zach LaVine and
Norman Powell. Given the
plethora of perimeter scoring
talent UCLA possesses,
Stanford must avoid the de
fensive lapses that have

plagued it at times this sea
son.
Regardless of the out
come against the highly tal
ented Bruins, Stanford must
come ready to play to avoid a
letdown against USC. It can
be argued that the Cardinal's
two inexplicable losses to the
Trojans last season were the
difference between reaching
the NCAA tournament and
not doing so, the latter being
the fate that eventually befell
Dawkins and company.
Despite having dropped
all five of its conference
games by double digits, USC
is still good enough to pull off
an upset, as evidenced by the
Trojans' victories over
Xavier and Boston College
earlier this season. Junior
guard Byron Wesley has
been a stud for first-year
coach Andy Enfield so far
this season, averaging 16.5
points and 7.4 rebounds per
game, both tops on the team.
The Cardinal will look to
keep its hot streak rolling at
8 p.m. on Thursday night
and 2 p.m. on Sunday. Both
games will be televised on
the Pac-12 Networks.

GAME NOTES: Stanford has turned its
season around with a three-game win
ning streak after an 0-2 start to Pac-12
play. A road sweep of the Los Angeles
schools this weekend would provide
another boost toward a potential
NCAA tournament bid. The play of
junior guard Chasson Randle, who has
been one of the more productive play
ers in the Pac-12 this season, could be
the key in picking up a big win at
Pauley Pavilion tonight.

games against the Bruins
and Trojans in Los Angeles,
the Cardinal stands a solid
chance of extending its win
ning streak in the days
ahead.
The main reason why is
the play of junior guard Chas
son Randle, who has been
nothing short of scintillating
through the first half of the
season. The Illinois native
ranks third in the conference
in scoring at 19.5 points per
game. He is the only guard
from a major-conference
team to rank in the top 40 in
the country in scoring while
shooting better than 50 per
cent from the field (52.2) and
40 percent from three-point
range (42.0).
"He's been aggressive,
and he's playing like the
young man we recruited,"
Dawkins said. "He's a young
man that can score; he can
find guys and make guys bet
ter, and he's done that for us
this year."
Randle has been the star
of a starting lineup that has
been forced to carry Stanford
so far this season, due in large
part to season-ending injuries
to several key contributors.
All five starters will have to
be at their best if the Cardinal
is going to knock off UCLA,
which is playing its first sea-

son under head coach Steve
Afford.
Stanford's back line of
seniors Dwight Powell,
Josh Huestis and Stefan Nas
tic must do a good job of
protecting the rim and secur
ing defensive rebounds
against the high-scoring Bru
ins, who at 84.4 points per
game rank second in the con
ference in scoring.
Stanford's fifth starter,
senior guard Anthony Brown,
will be tasked with the unen
viable challenge of guarding
UCLAs leading scorer, soph
omore Jordan Adams. If last
Saturday is any indication,
Brown should be up to the
task. He successfully held the
Pac-12's second-leading scor
er, Washington's C.J. Wilcox,
to nine points on 4-of-13
shooting in the Cardinal's
game against the Huskies,
marking Wilcox's lowest scor
ing output of the season.
The Bruins, much like the
Cardinal, feature four double
digit scorers in Adams, all
everything Kyle Anderson
and guards Zach LaVine and
Norman Powell. Given the
plethora of perimeter scoring
talent UCLA possesses,
Stanford must avoid the de
fensive lapses that have

plagued it at times this sea
son.
Regardless of the out
come against the highly tal
ented Bruins, Stanford must
come ready to play to avoid a
letdown against USC. It can
be argued that the Cardinal's
two inexplicable losses to the
Trojans last season were the
difference between reaching
the NCAA tournament and
not doing so, the latter being
the fate that eventually befell
Dawkins and company.
Despite having dropped
all five of its conference
games by double digits, USC
is still good enough to pull off
an upset, as evidenced by the
Trojans' victories over
Xavier and Boston College
earlier this season. Junior
guard Byron Wesley has
been a stud for first-year
coach Andy Enfield so far
this season, averaging 16.5
points and 7.4 rebounds per
game, both tops on the team.
The Cardinal will look to
keep its hot streak rolling at
8 p.m. on Thursday night
and 2 p.m. on Sunday. Both
games will be televised on
the Pac-12 Networks.

Stanford has never won four
straight conference games in the
Dawkins era.
When opportunity comes a
knockin', it's usually best to open
the door. The Stanford men's bas
ketball team finds itself on the
verge of a breakthrough, winners
of three straight conference games
and possessors of some newfound
confidence. The Cardinal (12-5, 3-2
Pac-12) will travel to UCLA (14-4,
3-2) and USC (9-9, 0-5) this week
with a chance to extend that win
ning streak, and in the process, do
something the team has never
done during head coach Johnny
Dawkins' tenure on the Farm: win

four straight conference games.
The last time Stanford won four
straight in conference play, it was
late February 2008, and a pair of 7-
foot-tall trees named Lopez
roamed the paint for the Cardinal.
That edition of the Men of Maples
was well on its way to the school's

fifth and most recent Sweet
Sixteen appearance in the NCAA
tournament. It hasn't even been
back to the tournament since. In
other words, four-game conference
winning streaks should be treas
ured and highly sought after.
