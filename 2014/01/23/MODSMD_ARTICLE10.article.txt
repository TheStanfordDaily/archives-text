## UCLA, USC next up for Card 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
When opportunity comes a
knockin', it's usually best to open
the door. The Stanford men's bas
ketball team finds itself on the
verge of a breakthrough, winners
of three straight conference games
and possessors of some newfound
confidence. The Cardinal (12-5, 3-2
Pac-12) will travel to UCLA (14-4,
3-2) and USC (9-9, 0-5) this week
with a chance to extend that win
ning streak, and in the process, do
something the team has never
done during head coach Johnny
Dawkins' tenure on the Farm: win

four straight conference games.
The last time Stanford won four
straight in conference play, it was
late February 2008, and a pair of 7-
foot-tall trees named Lopez
roamed the paint for the Cardinal.
That edition of the Men of Maples
was well on its way to the school's

fifth and most recent Sweet
Sixteen appearance in the NCAA
tournament. It hasn't even been
back to the tournament since. In
other words, four-game conference
winning streaks should be treas
ured and highly sought after.
Despite the team's recent dis

appointments, there is renewed
hope for the Cardinal faithful, even
ahead of a trip to the house of hor
rors that Stanford basketball
knows as Los Angeles. Despite
having dropped 15 of its last 16

GAME NOTES: Stanford has turned its
season around with a three-game win
ning streak after an 0-2 start to Pac-12
play. A road sweep of the Los Angeles
schools this weekend would provide
another boost toward a potential
NCAA tournament bid. The play of
junior guard Chasson Randle, who has
been one of the more productive play
ers in the Pac-12 this season, could be
the key in picking up a big win at
Pauley Pavilion tonight.

on Saturday, will look to help lead the Cardinal to its first four-game conference win streak since 2008.
