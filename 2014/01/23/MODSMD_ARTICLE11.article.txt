# Trojan test lies ahead
## 
### LAUREN LOCKETT 
Following its successful sweep in
the desert of Arizona and No. 14
Arizona State last weekend, No. 4
Stanford women's basketball will
welcome two familiar in-state foes
to its home court this weekend, as

Stanford's two conference Southern
California foes the UCLA Bruins
and the USC Trojans—will come
to Maples this weekend to take on
the Cardinal Friday and Monday,
respectively.
Coming off five straight victories
against top-25 opponents, Stanford

seems to be fully gelling and hitting
its stride. The dynamic play of sen
ior All-American forward Chiney
Ogwumike and burgeoning junior
point guard Amber Orrange has led
the Cardinal to 16 consecutive dom
inant wins. Other players, such as
fifth-year senior forward Mikaela
Ruef and two of the freshmen,
guards Lili Thompson and Karlie
Samuelson, have recently stepped
up significantly in their roles as well
to give the team a more balanced at
tack.
Despite Stanford's recent hot
play, both the Bruins and the Tro
jans will look to give the Card all it
can handle this weekend. Though
UCLA is currently unranked, the
team comes into Friday night's
matchup having won three of its last
four meetings and boasts a 4-3 con
ference record. Stanford's defense
will have to be ready for the Bruins'
trio of scorers who average at least
15 points per game: Atonye Nyingi
fa (18.0 ppg), Nirra Fields (17.6
ppg) and Thea Lemberger (15.8
PPg)-
After facing the Bruins, Stan
ford will face stouter competition on
Monday night against the Trojans.
While the Cardinal currently tops
the conference standings with a 6-0
record in the Pac-12, USC is right
on Stanford's heels with a 6-1 con
ference record. Coming off a high
scoring home sweep of the Oregon
teams, the Women of Troy will look
to ride their momentum into their
game against the Cardinal.
Stanford must be defensively fo
cused and prepared in this matchup
as well, as the Trojans have proven
they can light up the scoreboard.
Following the lead of dominant sen
ior forward Cassie Harberts, USC
scored 109 points in a landslide vic
tory in its last contest against Ore
gon. The reigning Pac-12 Player of
the Week, Harberts has reached
new heights this season, recently
cracking into USC's storied top-10
all time scoring list.
While the two conference games
against UCLA and USC will re
quire tenacity on the defensive end
of the court, recent performances
show that Stanford will be up to the
challenge. Ogwumike is posting an
other dominant, All-American-cal
iber season and Orrange was re
cently named a candidate for the
Nancy Lieberman Award, bestowed
each year on the nation's best colle
giate point guard.

Freshman guard Lili Thompson (above) has been a large contributor to
Stanford's much-improved depth throughout its roster this season.
Thompson is third on the team with 57 assists in her rookie season.
The Ogwumike-Harberts
matchup should be a fun one

to watch as the conference's
two best forwards battle it
out. If the other players on
the Cardinal squad can con
tinue to handle their defen
sive duties and help carry
the scoring load, however,
the Cardinal's win streak

should increase to 19.
The Cardinal will host
UCLA at Maples at 8 p.m.
on Friday and USC at 6 p.m.
on Monday.
