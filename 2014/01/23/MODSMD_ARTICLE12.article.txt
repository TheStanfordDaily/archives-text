## Cardinal seeks a rebound CRITICAL ROAD TRIP APPROACHES 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
After suffering tough
losses to UCLA and No. 8
UC-Santa Barbara last week
that dropped it from No. 1 to
No. 6 in the NCAA rankings,
Stanford men's volleyball
will look to reverse its strug
gles as it hits the road again
to face No. 7 BYU and Cal
Baptist.
The Cardinal now has an
opportunity to prove that it
can be successful on the road
by bringing home two criti
cal wins. Furthermore, Stan
ford is currently 0-2 in the
MPSF and is still looking for
its first conference win of the
season.
The Cardinal, which
started off very strong at the
beginning of the season and
quickly rose to the No. 1
spot, seemed out of its ele
ment and unlucky at times
while on the road last week.
The offense played consis
tently, but so did the offenses
of both UCLA and UC-Santa
Barbara. Certain plays could
have gone either way and
did. Both five-set matches
pushed Stanford to its limit
and proved too much for the
team's first road trip.
But the Cardinal will
have another chance this
weekend when Stanford (3-2,
0-2) will face No. 7 BYU (6-2,
4-0) in Provo, Utah, this Fri
day before heading back to
California to face Cal Baptist
(1-4,1-3) in Riverside on Sat
urday.
After losing two matches
early in the season, BYU is
currently on a four-match
winning streak. The Cougars
beat No. 1 Long Beach State
in four sets and won their
last two matches on the road,
meaning that they will be en
tering this game with confi
dence and positive momen
tum. Senior outside hitter
Taylor Sander broke the
BYU men's volleyball record
for aces in a match last Sat
urday, hitting nine for the
match. Sander will be diffi
cult for Stanford to contain
and the defense should look
to limit his ability to make
big plays in the match.
Because both teams are
strong offensively and like to

use their service game as an
advantage against oppo
nents, this match may prove
to be a fight of which can out
serve the other and which
defense can contain the op
ponent's hitting power more
effectively.
Though Cal Baptist is
currently unranked and com
ing off a loss in three sets at
No. 7 UC-Irvine, Stanford
did lose to the Lancers at the
UC-Santa Barbara Invita
tional earlier this season.
While the match did not
count towards Stanford's
record, Cal Baptist won 2-1
and showed the ability to lim
it Stanford's offensive advan
tage. Furthermore, Stan

ford's quick turnaround be
tween matches that will in
volve a flight from Utah to
Southern California could aid
Cal Baptist's upset chances.
Overall, the Cardinal will
face two strong opponents
again on the road this week.
This time, however, it will
have the experience of last
week's road losses to use as a
lesson for what to work on
and as experience in stressful
environments.
Stanford plays BYU at 7
p.m. in Provo, Utah, on Fri
day and Cal Baptist at 7 p.m.
Saturday in Riverside.
