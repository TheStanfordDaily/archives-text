## Cardinal seeks a rebound CRITICAL ROAD TRIP APPROACHES 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
After suffering tough
losses to UCLA and No. 8
UC-Santa Barbara last week
that dropped it from No. 1 to
No. 6 in the NCAA rankings,
Stanford men's volleyball
will look to reverse its strug

pushed Stanford to its limit

team's first road trip.
But the Cardinal will
have another chance this
weekend when Stanford (3-2,
0-2) will face No. 7 BYU (6-2,
4-0) in Provo, Utah, this Fri
day before heading back to
California to face Cal Baptist
(1-4,1-3) in Riverside on Sat
urday.
After losing two matches
early in the season, BYU is
currently on a four-match
winning streak. The Cougars
beat No. 1 Long Beach State
in four sets and won their
last two matches on the road,
