I war stories," Stanford Y2E2
-L Project Engineer Forest Pe
terson dramatically delivers in a re
cent meeting, and this line holds
more truth than drama. In the
building industry, the story of every
building is ripe with tales of dead
lines missed, costly mistakes and a
final product that doesn't always
match its original plans. Stanford's
Yang-Yamazaki Environment and
Energy Building (Y2E2) was no ex
ception.
This building on the Engineering
Quad was designed with numerous
energy-saving components to make
it the most energy-efficient building
on Stanford's campus. Most impor
tantly, it would use less energy than
a comparable building say, a lab
building of about the same size
that was designed merely to meet
building codes and didn't strive for
high performance.
Y2E2 has been pretty successful,
according to analyses run by Stan
ford Building Management, as well
as those of graduate and postdoc
students associated with the Center
for Integrated Facility Engineering.
Their extensive analyses have
shown that Y2E2 is indeed saving
about 40 percent of the energy need
ed to run a comparable building.
Furthermore, the building's actual
energy usage comes pretty close to
its predicted performance some
thing that is much rarer than it
should be in the building industry.
But the building is not without its
scars. Sloppy and rushed work cre
ated many cosmetic issues through
out the building and one fairly large
structural error that could have
been avoided.
The building is designed to have
four atria; each atrium has a sky
light, numerous conference rooms, a
big open space from the basement
all the way up to the roof, and a dif
ferent color associated with it to
make the building, as a whole, more
navigable. But honestly, I've been in
Y2E2 many, many times, having
taken several classes there and I
still find it to be one of the most con
fusing buildings I've ever stepped
inside.
In the first atrium, you can plain
ly see discolored square patches on
the ground by the railings where
safety rails were put in place for the
construction crew, pulled out once
construction was complete, and then
filled in. Then there's the cracks all
over the concrete, the exposed pipes
and ducts throughout the entire fa
cility, and the numerous plugs and
light switches that may or may not
work. No, really in Y2E2, some
plugs and light switches really do
not work.
None of these cosmetic problems
are really even problems, though. So
what if there's some cracks in the
concrete? Or if I can see some pipes
overhead? The building is still very
functional and high performing. But
there are larger problems lying un
derneath the building both liter
ally and figuratively.
One large issue that arose dur
ing construction concerned the
steel supports in the basement of
Y2E2. Nearly everyone has heard
at some point or another how trian
gles are the most stable support

structure because of which most
buildings include the triangle in
their supporting trusses. For what
ever reason, the contractors of the
building had the triangular trusses
constructed so that at the very base
of the structure, the triangle would
point into the ground, instead of
resting along one of its flat sides
point up.
I'm no engineering expert, but
luckily Peterson is. He informed me
the builders had to add large pieces
of sheet metal to the triangular
trusses to bind them to supporting
columns in order to keep the build
ing together should a seismic event
occur. Overall, this generated a
waste of time and resources. More
worryingly, the actual structural
stability of this configuration is un
known because it was not tested
extensively. This is cause for some
alarm.
Realistically, I think it's safe to
say that Y2E2 will not come crum
bling down around us in the near fu
ture. Furthermore, I would like to
think that a building could not be
erected without proper load testing
first.
But serious mistakes happen in
building and construction all the
time, particularly when there is a
lack of communication and good
project management. "But that's sil
ly," you're thinking. "How could
there possibly be this big of a mis
communication on a project like
this? On a project run by Stan
ford?!"
The sad truth is, miscommunica
tions run rampant on building proj
ects among the many different
groups involved in the project. Even
a project commissioned or owned by
Stanford could be riddled with these
kinds of problems.
Traditionally, building projects
are broken into many different
pieces, and a different expert or
group handles each piece separately.
An architect designs the building, a
structural engineer tweaks the de
sign, a construction company is
hired to build according to the blue
prints and a general contractor
oversees the material acquisition
and construction. Over the course of
the project, these different parties
will interact only sporadically.
This means information is not
flowing freely or quickly. It's easy to
see how some things could slip right
through the cracks and no one, or at
least a majority of the stakeholders
involved, would be the wiser. Con
versely, information lost in transla
tion can manifest itself as one big,
blatant, costly mistake.
The problem is that a building is
a large, complex product that re
quires a bunch of different people
with different areas of expertise. In
turn, the building industry has
evolved to make the building
process really quite inefficient.
However, more and more project
management and organization
strategies have emerged to combat
the wasted time and resources that
characterize the building industry.

are really even problems, though. So
what if there's some cracks in the
concrete? Or if I can see some pipes
overhead? The building is still very
functional and high performing. But
there are larger problems lying un
derneath the building both liter
ally and figuratively.
One large issue that arose dur
ing construction concerned the
steel supports in the basement of
Y2E2. Nearly everyone has heard
at some point or another how trian
gles are the most stable support

structure because of which most
buildings include the triangle in
their supporting trusses. For what
ever reason, the contractors of the
building had the triangular trusses
constructed so that at the very base
of the structure, the triangle would
point into the ground, instead of
resting along one of its flat sides
point up.
I'm no engineering expert, but
luckily Peterson is. He informed me
the builders had to add large pieces
of sheet metal to the triangular
trusses to bind them to supporting
columns in order to keep the build
ing together should a seismic event
occur. Overall, this generated a
waste of time and resources. More
worryingly, the actual structural
stability of this configuration is un
known because it was not tested
extensively. This is cause for some
alarm.
Realistically, I think it's safe to
say that Y2E2 will not come crum
bling down around us in the near fu
ture. Furthermore, I would like to
think that a building could not be
erected without proper load testing
first.
But serious mistakes happen in
building and construction all the
time, particularly when there is a
lack of communication and good
project management. "But that's sil
ly," you're thinking. "How could
there possibly be this big of a mis
communication on a project like
this? On a project run by Stan
ford?!"
The sad truth is, miscommunica
tions run rampant on building proj
ects among the many different
groups involved in the project. Even
a project commissioned or owned by
Stanford could be riddled with these
kinds of problems.
Traditionally, building projects
are broken into many different
pieces, and a different expert or
group handles each piece separately.
An architect designs the building, a
structural engineer tweaks the de
sign, a construction company is
hired to build according to the blue
prints and a general contractor
oversees the material acquisition
and construction. Over the course of
the project, these different parties
will interact only sporadically.
This means information is not
flowing freely or quickly. It's easy to
see how some things could slip right
through the cracks and no one, or at
least a majority of the stakeholders
involved, would be the wiser. Con
versely, information lost in transla
tion can manifest itself as one big,
blatant, costly mistake.
The problem is that a building is
a large, complex product that re
quires a bunch of different people
with different areas of expertise. In
turn, the building industry has
evolved to make the building
process really quite inefficient.
However, more and more project
management and organization
strategies have emerged to combat
the wasted time and resources that
characterize the building industry.
And these management strategies
have emerged right here at Stan
ford.

I war stories," Stanford Y2E2
-L Project Engineer Forest Pe
terson dramatically delivers in a re
cent meeting, and this line holds
more truth than drama. In the
building industry, the story of every
building is ripe with tales of dead
lines missed, costly mistakes and a
final product that doesn't always
match its original plans. Stanford's
Yang-Yamazaki Environment and
Energy Building (Y2E2) was no ex
ception.
This building on the Engineering
Quad was designed with numerous
energy-saving components to make
it the most energy-efficient building
on Stanford's campus. Most impor
tantly, it would use less energy than
a comparable building say, a lab
building of about the same size
that was designed merely to meet
building codes and didn't strive for
high performance.
Y2E2 has been pretty successful,
according to analyses run by Stan
ford Building Management, as well
as those of graduate and postdoc
students associated with the Center
for Integrated Facility Engineering.
Their extensive analyses have
shown that Y2E2 is indeed saving
about 40 percent of the energy need
ed to run a comparable building.
Furthermore, the building's actual
energy usage comes pretty close to
its predicted performance some
thing that is much rarer than it
should be in the building industry.
But the building is not without its
scars. Sloppy and rushed work cre
ated many cosmetic issues through
out the building and one fairly large
structural error that could have
been avoided.
The building is designed to have
four atria; each atrium has a sky
light, numerous conference rooms, a
big open space from the basement
all the way up to the roof, and a dif
ferent color associated with it to
make the building, as a whole, more
navigable. But honestly, I've been in
Y2E2 many, many times, having
taken several classes there and I
still find it to be one of the most con
fusing buildings I've ever stepped
inside.
In the first atrium, you can plain
ly see discolored square patches on
the ground by the railings where
safety rails were put in place for the
construction crew, pulled out once
construction was complete, and then
filled in. Then there's the cracks all
over the concrete, the exposed pipes
and ducts throughout the entire fa
cility, and the numerous plugs and
light switches that may or may not
work. No, really in Y2E2, some
plugs and light switches really do
not work.
None of these cosmetic problems
are really even problems, though. So
what if there's some cracks in the
concrete? Or if I can see some pipes
overhead? The building is still very
