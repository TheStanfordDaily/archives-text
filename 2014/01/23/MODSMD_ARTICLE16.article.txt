## Part I: When the Google Bus Stops 
### Chi Ling Chan 
This column is the first part, of
a multi-part series. The next
segment will be released in two
weeks.

There are two men standing in
front of a bus headed for
Mountain View and the sign
they carry reads "FUCK OFF,
GOOGLE."
For the Google employees on
board the "Google bus" taking
them to work that day, confronting
that jarring message probably
wasn't the best start to their
morning. Then it got worse. Pro
testors in Oakland attacked that
Google bus on that day last month,
smashing a window and distribut
ing fliers calling for a moratorium
against evictions of residents in
Oakland. It is tempting to see this
as an isolated incident mounted by
some disenchanted Luddites, but
it simply isn't. Just last week, San
Francisco activists blocked an Ap
ple bus, parading a wooden coffin
bearing the words "Affordable
Housing."
Just what is going on? Why, for
all the ostensibly democratizing na
ture of the technology celebrated by
Silicon Valley, are its employees
seen as "chums living on free 24/7
buffets driving up housing prices?"
There appears to be some sort of
hipster-on-hipster hatred going on

in the city, not unlike the fuzzie vs.
techie tension so pervasive on the
Stanford campus. But just as the
psychology of the oft-parodied
fuzzie vs. techie tension runs deeper
than humanities majors hating on
computer science, the housing pro
testors are not taking to the streets
because they are against technolo
gy per se.
Tech work isn't some harbinger
of evil, and there is no reason to be
lieve that Bay Area residents see
tech as the enemy, even if viral pho
tos of angry banners tempt us to.
Soon after the incident, the Univer
sity of San Francisco released a poll
suggesting that bread-and-butter
issues for example, the declining
affordability of housing are at
the heart of the debacle.
Partly because of the ongoing
tech boom in the Bay Area and the
recovering real estate market,
housing prices have escalated dra
matically: The median price of a
home in San Francisco topped $1
million earlier this year. Hitting es
pecially hard, the median rent for a
two-bedroom apartment has
reached $3,250, the highest in the
country. Over the past year alone,
the whole Bay Area has seen a 22
percent increase in home prices,
and between 2010 and 2013, the me
dian rent in San Francisco rose by
15 percent.
These increasing prices have
been met with community upheaval.
2013 alone saw 1716 evictions, the
majority of which have been of sen
iors and people with disabilities.
Existing residents in Bay Area
communities are being squeezed
out by young yuppies working in
the tech industry that desire to ex
perience the thrills of urban life.

The root cause of the problem
doesn't lie solely with Google, Ap
ple or the rest of the tech industry,
although they were specifically
called out in the protests. The sim
plest explanation is that, for a mul
titude of reasons access to jobs
being one, the allure of city life be
ing another many tech employ
ees have chosen to live in San Fran
cisco. In away, this is a happy prob
lem that other declining cities in
the U.S. can only dream of, but fast
growth and the rapid influx of
workers are causing a housing cri
sis, making the Bay Area and San
Francisco in particular victims of
their own success.
The real fault, I think, lies in San
Francisco's housing policies, which
have not responded to the surge in
demand. Thanks to restrictive zon
ing laws, a Byzantine permit

process and a pathological culture of
NIMBYism, housing supply has
stalled. Barely 1,500 new housing
units per year have been built over
the past two decades, which is half of
what Seattle (boasting a tech econo
my not unlike the Bay Area's) pro
duces in a year. In 2011, only 269
units were built, but the city added
over 40,000 new jobs in 2012 alone.
Because infill development has been
met with active resistance in San
Francisco, regional population
growth has been pushed elsewhere
to Oakland, the Brooklyn of the
Bay Area.
Change, it must be understood,
is not a tide that lifts all boats. When
it comes too fast, too quickly and
with indifference to (un)fairness,
some resistance can only be expect
ed. In the face of change, it is easy to
see who will have to make way: the
poor, the older, the less code-fluent,
and yes, the less-white. The mani
fest dissatisfaction towards tech
money makes clear one thing: that
the tech sector, for all the paeans it
sings to egalitarianism, is not ex
empt from the host of inequalities
we see throughout the country.
Silicon Valley is a place where
"the right kind" of nerdy does well
and "the right kind" generally
happens to be white or Asian, and
male. The culture and instincts so
prevalent in the Bay Area are not
free from ethnic or gender biases.
Follow the money, and these bi
ases readily reveal themselves: In
Silicon Valley, 89 percent of founding
teams of Series A startups are all
male, and only 3 percent are all-fe
male. (Curiously, almost 1/3 of Mas
sachusetts' founding teams are all
female.) 83 percent of founding
teams that received Series A fund
ing are all-white, compared to less
than 1 percent that are all-black
and the latter get far less seed mon
ey than then* Asian and white coun
terparts. Should we even be sur
prised to learn that the median in
come for households in the Bay
Area headed by non-Hispanic
whites is $77,000, compared with
$26,000 for those headed by African-
Americans?
The question remains: Why have
tech companies become a target in
recent protests? Why are lines be
ing drawn for a battle seemingly be
tween the techies and the non
techies?
A probable answer: This is not
merely about housing policy, but al
so change, inequality and indiffer
ence.

recent protests? Why are lines be
ing drawn for a battle seemingly be
tween the techies and the non
techies?
A probable answer: This is not
merely about housing policy, but al
so change, inequality and indiffer
ence.

There are two men standing in
front of a bus headed for
Mountain View and the sign
they carry reads "FUCK OFF,
GOOGLE."
For the Google employees on
board the "Google bus" taking
them to work that day, confronting
that jarring message probably
wasn't the best start to their
morning. Then it got worse. Pro
testors in Oakland attacked that
Google bus on that day last month,
smashing a window and distribut
ing fliers calling for a moratorium
against evictions of residents in
Oakland. It is tempting to see this
as an isolated incident mounted by
some disenchanted Luddites, but
it simply isn't. Just last week, San
Francisco activists blocked an Ap
ple bus, parading a wooden coffin
bearing the words "Affordable
Housing."
Just what is going on? Why, for
all the ostensibly democratizing na
ture of the technology celebrated by
Silicon Valley, are its employees
seen as "chums living on free 24/7
buffets driving up housing prices?"
There appears to be some sort of
hipster-on-hipster hatred going on

in the city, not unlike the fuzzie vs.
techie tension so pervasive on the
Stanford campus. But just as the
psychology of the oft-parodied
fuzzie vs. techie tension runs deeper
than humanities majors hating on
computer science, the housing pro
testors are not taking to the streets
because they are against technolo
gy per se.
Tech work isn't some harbinger
of evil, and there is no reason to be
lieve that Bay Area residents see
tech as the enemy, even if viral pho
tos of angry banners tempt us to.
Soon after the incident, the Univer
sity of San Francisco released a poll
suggesting that bread-and-butter
issues for example, the declining
affordability of housing are at
the heart of the debacle.
Partly because of the ongoing
tech boom in the Bay Area and the
recovering real estate market,
housing prices have escalated dra
matically: The median price of a
home in San Francisco topped $1
million earlier this year. Hitting es
pecially hard, the median rent for a
two-bedroom apartment has
reached $3,250, the highest in the
country. Over the past year alone,
the whole Bay Area has seen a 22
percent increase in home prices,
and between 2010 and 2013, the me
dian rent in San Francisco rose by
15 percent.
These increasing prices have
been met with community upheaval.
2013 alone saw 1716 evictions, the
majority of which have been of sen
iors and people with disabilities.
Existing residents in Bay Area
communities are being squeezed
out by young yuppies working in
the tech industry that desire to ex
perience the thrills of urban life.

The root cause of the problem
doesn't lie solely with Google, Ap
ple or the rest of the tech industry,
although they were specifically
called out in the protests. The sim
plest explanation is that, for a mul
titude of reasons access to jobs
being one, the allure of city life be
ing another many tech employ
ees have chosen to live in San Fran
cisco. In away, this is a happy prob
lem that other declining cities in
the U.S. can only dream of, but fast
growth and the rapid influx of
workers are causing a housing cri
sis, making the Bay Area and San
Francisco in particular victims of
their own success.
The real fault, I think, lies in San
Francisco's housing policies, which
have not responded to the surge in
demand. Thanks to restrictive zon
ing laws, a Byzantine permit

process and a pathological culture of
NIMBYism, housing supply has
stalled. Barely 1,500 new housing
units per year have been built over
the past two decades, which is half of
what Seattle (boasting a tech econo
my not unlike the Bay Area's) pro
duces in a year. In 2011, only 269
units were built, but the city added
over 40,000 new jobs in 2012 alone.
Because infill development has been
met with active resistance in San
Francisco, regional population
growth has been pushed elsewhere
to Oakland, the Brooklyn of the
Bay Area.
Change, it must be understood,
is not a tide that lifts all boats. When
it comes too fast, too quickly and
with indifference to (un)fairness,
some resistance can only be expect
ed. In the face of change, it is easy to
see who will have to make way: the
poor, the older, the less code-fluent,
and yes, the less-white. The mani
fest dissatisfaction towards tech
money makes clear one thing: that
the tech sector, for all the paeans it
sings to egalitarianism, is not ex
empt from the host of inequalities
we see throughout the country.
Silicon Valley is a place where
"the right kind" of nerdy does well
and "the right kind" generally
happens to be white or Asian, and
male. The culture and instincts so
prevalent in the Bay Area are not
free from ethnic or gender biases.
Follow the money, and these bi
ases readily reveal themselves: In
Silicon Valley, 89 percent of founding
teams of Series A startups are all
male, and only 3 percent are all-fe
male. (Curiously, almost 1/3 of Mas
sachusetts' founding teams are all
female.) 83 percent of founding
teams that received Series A fund
ing are all-white, compared to less
than 1 percent that are all-black
and the latter get far less seed mon
ey than then* Asian and white coun
terparts. Should we even be sur
prised to learn that the median in
come for households in the Bay
Area headed by non-Hispanic
whites is $77,000, compared with
$26,000 for those headed by African-
Americans?
The question remains: Why have
tech companies become a target in
recent protests? Why are lines be
ing drawn for a battle seemingly be
tween the techies and the non
techies?
A probable answer: This is not
merely about housing policy, but al
so change, inequality and indiffer
ence.
