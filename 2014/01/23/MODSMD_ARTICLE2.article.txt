# Behind NPR's "This American Life"
## Snyder remarks on rapid changes in radio news 
### ALEX ZIVKOVIC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On a stage in front of 300 people,
Julie Snyder, the senior producer of
"This American Life," shared the
story of her career path and jour
nalistic mantras with her audience
and mediator Jonah Willihnganz,
the director of Stanford Story
telling Project (SSP), the organiza
tion that put together the event.
According to Event Coordinator
Liz Quinlan, SSP had been expect
ing around 100 students, setting up
just half of the room of Paul Brest
Hall. By the start of the actual
event, however, organizers had to
open up the rest of the room to ac
commodate the nearly 300 people
who attended.
Snyder began by introducing the
success of her show "This American
Life" which she said attracts 1.7
million listeners and has the most
downloaded podcasts week after
week before talking about her
career path.
Snyder's humble beginnings in
media began on her college campus
as a student at UC-Santa Cruz,
where she took a class on radio
journalism. Her specific interest
and strength in radio stem from her
ability to tell a story intuitively.
"I had the understanding of a plot

and tension and an idea and a reflec
tion at the end," she said.
When she first applied for the job
at "This American Life," the show
had only been on the air for a year.
"I was incredibly unqualified
and it was so small and new at the
time that the bar was really low,"
she said of her prospects.
She has been with the show for

the past 17 years, thereby witness
ing a shift in coverage away from in
dividual, emotional stories to narra
tives that capture national events
that major news outlets cover. The
start of this shift for the show, she
believes, was September 11th.
"Now [it's about] trying to get the
characters in the story-telling the
events," Snyder said of her approach.

Following 9/11, Ira Glass, then
host of the show, pushed for cover
age, so Snyder and the team sought
out individuals to sit with and tell ex
tended stories, people that "sounded
like people and didn't sound like
sound bites."
In her coverage of Katrina, Sny
der followed a similar approach.
"Radio really lends itself to em

pathy probably because it is such a
small and intimate medium," Sny
der said.
Snyder told a story of one inter
viewee in New Orleans who had de
scribed a near-fatal mistake of run
ning back to her house to get ciga
rettes when the hurricane struck
and the levees broke. For Snyder,
this story allowed the readers to get
a sense of the event's impact on indi
viduals.
Though Snyder spoke sponta
neously and critically of reports she
found lacking, including her cover
age of most political stories and es
pecially climate change, she paused
when asked which episodes she
most liked.
"My favorite episodes are usually
the same ones as eveiyone else
ones that they really liked," Snyder
said.
In the last half hour, the event
opened to questions from the audi
ence, one of which challenged Sny
der's choice of words when packag
ing a story with an implicit bias, to
which Snyder replied that journal
istic choice of choosing a topic was
in itself sending a message.
Snyder said that these stories
and narratives were meant to help
her understand the world the best
she could.
"Obviously everyone is going to
have his or her own thoughts, but
it's simply a process of being able to
distill and package a story-to-be,"
Snyder said. "I'm choosing a story
that I'm going to tell you."
