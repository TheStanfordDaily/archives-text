## DANIEL SWAIN PH.D. STUDENT IN ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
While the East Coast ploughs
through frozen weather, California
is currently under a drought emer
gency.
To get a better understanding of
what caused the extreme weather
predicament, The Daily spoke with
Daniel Swain third year Ph.D.
student in environmental earth sys
tem science studying atmospheric
processes that impact global cli
mate change who coined the
phrase "Ridiculously Resilient
Ridge" to explain California's dry
spells.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
severe is the current California
drought?
Daniel Swain (DS): By most met
rics it's the worst drought that Cal
ifornia has seen in its historical
record at least as far as humans
have been taking records in the
state. We know that the calendar
year 2013 was the driest in at least
119 years and probably much
longer than that.
The current water year between
October and now is the driest to
date... so if you use all of these dif
ferent metrics about the amount
of precipitation that California's
had to describe how sever the
drought is, it's certainly the worst
in living memory and probably the
worst in a significantly longer pe
riod than that.

TSD: What major factors, environ
mental or otherwise, have led to the
current drought?
DS: From an atmospheric perspec
tive, the proximate cause of the
drought in California is this big
ridge of high pressure over the
north Pacific. You can sort of think
of it as this big mass of warm air
that's essentially been sitting there
more or less in the same place for
many months now, and what this
does is redirect the storm track
away from California. Normally
we'd see a number of Pacific
storms during the winter time here
in California but so far this winter,
and for the second half of last win
ter as well, really all of these
storms have gotten redirected...

into British Columbia and Alaska.
TSD: What are state officials doing
in response and do you think this is
enough?
DS: As I'm sure you're aware, the
governor declared a drought emer
gency in California last week, and
as far as I understand it opens up
some legal pathways and it allows
for ... enforcing certain kinds of
regulations in terms of water use in
California.
The tricky part with a situation
like this is how water is managed in
California. Most likely the agricul
tural interests in California will be
the ones most immediately affected
by water restrictions and water
shortages, but the current situation
is acute enough that it will probably
go beyond that and affect urban
water users and day-to-day water
use by your average person in Cal
ifornia.
So I think what the state is do
ing right now is they're gearing up
for major conservation efforts. I
know there was a recommendation
for voluntary 20 percent reduction
in water use across the board, but if
this current situation continues the
reduction of water use in California
is going to have to be quite a bit

higher than that. I know that
certain local water districts
are considering water ra
tioning to the order of 50
percent reduction or more
and those would be manda
tory. So I think that the state
is starting to sort of mobilize
for big water restrictions in
the next couple of months.

TSD: What immediate im
pact, if any, does the drought
have on the Stanford com
munity and what can the
Stanford community do in
response?
DS: Much of the Bay Area
including the Stanford area
gets its water from largely
non-local sources. The water
actually comes from
snowmelt in the Sierra Ne
vada mountain [range] that
essentially flows over in the
aqueduct to the Bay Area.
So we're affected by the

drought in the sense that re
ally all of Northern Califor
nia has too little water right
now. We're in slightly better
shape than some smaller
communities who are relying
on local sources because we
have a little bit of a buffer
from precipitation from pre
vious years in the reservoirs,
but eventually if this keeps
up there will probably be
some form of water restric
tions here.
I think for now, obviously,
a good thing to do for every
one is to be conscious of wa
ter use and maybe take some
active efforts to reduce your
water use. Sometimes that
can be as simple as not water
ing your lawn or taking
shorter showers or not wash
ing your car. Doing those
sorts of things now will help
to lower potential for more
serious water restrictions in
the future. The current
severity of the drought sug
gests that some of these
smaller measures may not be
enough even if everyone par
takes so that's all the more

reason to conserve water
now.

TSD: What is the outlook to
when this drought will pass?
DS: The weather forecast for
the next week or so is not
very promising pretty
much all of the same for the
next seven to 10 days. Cer
tainly dry and certainly
warm. Pretty much the out
come of the drought this year
will be dependent on how
much rain we get in February
and March, and right now it
doesn't look particularly like
ly that February and March
are going to be wetter than
normal, which is what we
would need to avoid some of
this water rationing.
Unfortunately it looks like
the chances of February and
March being close to normal
or drier than normal are
quite high.

So I think what the state is do
ing right now is they're gearing up
for major conservation efforts. I
know there was a recommendation
for voluntary 20 percent reduction
in water use across the board, but if
this current situation continues the
reduction of water use in California
is going to have to be quite a bit

higher than that. I know that
certain local water districts
are considering water ra
tioning to the order of 50
percent reduction or more
and those would be manda
tory. So I think that the state
is starting to sort of mobilize
for big water restrictions in
the next couple of months.

TSD: What immediate im
pact, if any, does the drought
have on the Stanford com
munity and what can the
Stanford community do in
response?
DS: Much of the Bay Area
including the Stanford area
gets its water from largely
non-local sources. The water
actually comes from
snowmelt in the Sierra Ne
vada mountain [range] that
essentially flows over in the
aqueduct to the Bay Area.
So we're affected by the

drought in the sense that re
ally all of Northern Califor
nia has too little water right
now. We're in slightly better
shape than some smaller
communities who are relying
on local sources because we
have a little bit of a buffer
from precipitation from pre
vious years in the reservoirs,
but eventually if this keeps
up there will probably be
some form of water restric
tions here.
I think for now, obviously,
a good thing to do for every
one is to be conscious of wa
ter use and maybe take some
active efforts to reduce your
water use. Sometimes that
can be as simple as not water
ing your lawn or taking
shorter showers or not wash
ing your car. Doing those
sorts of things now will help
to lower potential for more
serious water restrictions in
the future. The current
severity of the drought sug
gests that some of these
smaller measures may not be
enough even if everyone par
takes so that's all the more

reason to conserve water
now.

TSD: What is the outlook to
when this drought will pass?
DS: The weather forecast for
the next week or so is not
very promising pretty
much all of the same for the
next seven to 10 days. Cer
tainly dry and certainly
warm. Pretty much the out
come of the drought this year
will be dependent on how
much rain we get in February
and March, and right now it
doesn't look particularly like
ly that February and March
are going to be wetter than
normal, which is what we
would need to avoid some of
this water rationing.
Unfortunately it looks like
the chances of February and
March being close to normal
or drier than normal are
quite high.

While the East Coast ploughs
through frozen weather, California
is currently under a drought emer
gency.
To get a better understanding of
what caused the extreme weather
predicament, The Daily spoke with
Daniel Swain third year Ph.D.
student in environmental earth sys
tem science studying atmospheric
processes that impact global cli
mate change who coined the
phrase "Ridiculously Resilient
Ridge" to explain California's dry
spells.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
severe is the current California
drought?
Daniel Swain (DS): By most met
rics it's the worst drought that Cal
ifornia has seen in its historical
record at least as far as humans
have been taking records in the
state. We know that the calendar
year 2013 was the driest in at least
119 years and probably much
longer than that.
The current water year between
October and now is the driest to
date... so if you use all of these dif
ferent metrics about the amount
of precipitation that California's
had to describe how sever the
drought is, it's certainly the worst
in living memory and probably the
worst in a significantly longer pe
riod than that.

TSD: What major factors, environ
mental or otherwise, have led to the
current drought?
DS: From an atmospheric perspec
tive, the proximate cause of the
drought in California is this big
ridge of high pressure over the
north Pacific. You can sort of think
of it as this big mass of warm air
that's essentially been sitting there
more or less in the same place for
many months now, and what this
does is redirect the storm track
away from California. Normally
we'd see a number of Pacific
storms during the winter time here
in California but so far this winter,
and for the second half of last win
ter as well, really all of these
storms have gotten redirected...

into British Columbia and Alaska.
TSD: What are state officials doing
in response and do you think this is
enough?
DS: As I'm sure you're aware, the
governor declared a drought emer
gency in California last week, and
as far as I understand it opens up
some legal pathways and it allows
for ... enforcing certain kinds of
regulations in terms of water use in
California.
The tricky part with a situation
like this is how water is managed in
California. Most likely the agricul
tural interests in California will be
the ones most immediately affected
by water restrictions and water
shortages, but the current situation
is acute enough that it will probably
go beyond that and affect urban
water users and day-to-day water
use by your average person in Cal
ifornia.
So I think what the state is do
ing right now is they're gearing up
for major conservation efforts. I
