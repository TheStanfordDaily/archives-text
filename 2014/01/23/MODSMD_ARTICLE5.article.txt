While the East Coast ploughs
through frozen weather, California
is currently under a drought emer
gency.
To get a better understanding of
what caused the extreme weather
predicament, The Daily spoke with
Daniel Swain third year Ph.D.
student in environmental earth sys
tem science studying atmospheric
processes that impact global cli
mate change who coined the
phrase "Ridiculously Resilient
Ridge" to explain California's dry
spells.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
severe is the current California
drought?
Daniel Swain (DS): By most met
rics it's the worst drought that Cal
ifornia has seen in its historical
record at least as far as humans
have been taking records in the
state. We know that the calendar
year 2013 was the driest in at least
119 years and probably much
longer than that.
The current water year between
October and now is the driest to
date... so if you use all of these dif
ferent metrics about the amount
of precipitation that California's
had to describe how sever the
drought is, it's certainly the worst
in living memory and probably the
worst in a significantly longer pe
riod than that.

TSD: What major factors, environ
mental or otherwise, have led to the
current drought?
DS: From an atmospheric perspec
tive, the proximate cause of the
drought in California is this big
ridge of high pressure over the
north Pacific. You can sort of think
of it as this big mass of warm air
that's essentially been sitting there
more or less in the same place for
many months now, and what this
does is redirect the storm track
away from California. Normally
we'd see a number of Pacific
storms during the winter time here
in California but so far this winter,
and for the second half of last win
ter as well, really all of these
storms have gotten redirected...

into British Columbia and Alaska.
TSD: What are state officials doing
in response and do you think this is
enough?
DS: As I'm sure you're aware, the
governor declared a drought emer
gency in California last week, and
as far as I understand it opens up
some legal pathways and it allows
for ... enforcing certain kinds of
regulations in terms of water use in
California.
The tricky part with a situation
like this is how water is managed in
California. Most likely the agricul
tural interests in California will be
the ones most immediately affected
by water restrictions and water
shortages, but the current situation
is acute enough that it will probably
go beyond that and affect urban
water users and day-to-day water
use by your average person in Cal
ifornia.
So I think what the state is do
ing right now is they're gearing up
for major conservation efforts. I
know there was a recommendation
for voluntary 20 percent reduction
in water use across the board, but if
this current situation continues the
reduction of water use in California
is going to have to be quite a bit

California is experiencing its worst
drought in years with no clear
signs of improvement.
