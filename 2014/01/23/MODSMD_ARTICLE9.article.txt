## Big spending is a return to normalcy 
### Winston Shi 
It is the night of January22,2ol4.
I finally have time to relax and
think, and the first thought that
comes to mind is that the Los
Angeles Dodgers have finally
been outbid for a player.
Japanese ace pitcher Masahiro
Tanaka, formerly of Rakuten, signed
with the New Yirk Yankees for a total
outlay of $175 million. It's trite at this
point to compare sports salaries to oth
er nations' GDPs, so I will pass over the
fact that the figure is larger than the an
nual economic output of Kiribati. Let it
simply be known that Tanaka will be
paid very well to throw balls very hard,
and that since he will be throwing the
majority of his balls in New York, we
will never hear* the end of it.
This announcement came on the
heels of Clayton Kershaw's $215 mil
lion deal to stay in Los Angeles, and so
it is a testament to the largesse of the
Dodgers that an act so utterly typify
ing the New York Yankees was never
theless completely unexpected.
The Yankees didn't just spend $175
million on a pitcher; they spent $175
million on a pitcher who has already
thrown 1,315 innings. 1,315 innings by
age 24! $175 million for a pitcher from
a league where Tanaka threw 160
pitches in a 4-2 complete game loss
a loss in which Rakuten never led af
ter the fifth inning and then closed
out the season the very next day $175
million for a pitcher who has never
thrown a pitch in the major leagues.
It's a contract that makes those of Yu
Darvish and Daisuke Matsuzaka look
beggarly in comparison.
The Yankees, who spent the entire
fall talking about how they wanted to
avoid the luxury tax, have decided to
go supernova. After the signings of
Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury and Brian
McCann, it's clear that baseball's
biggest team has glanced at Bud
Selig's tiny little speed bump and
driven over it with a steam train. In
a life that has been spent watching
the Yankees spend large amounts of
money whenever they felt like it, Tana
ka's signing might have been the most
"New York Yankees thing" ever.
Order, it seems, has finally been re
stored.
As I said, it's a testament to Dodger
owner Mark Walter's pocketbook that
I never* expected this to happen.
If you really think about it, the
Dodgers never even needed Tanaka's
services at all. The Dodgers have ar
guably the best pitching staff in the
league. Their bullpen, normally the
domain of a closer* and some league
minimum relievers, is close to the
most expensive. And yet, even after
the Yankees spent $214 million to
move Ichiro Suzuki to the bench, I
never expected that Tanaka would put
on pinstripes.
We have been lulled into a sense
of security in which the Dodgers
would simply buy any target suppos
edly worth getting. When the Walter
era was getting into swing, I made a
joke that the Dodgers would sign
Michael Vick to play left field. It did
n't seem that ludicrous in the mo
ment, since the Dodgers seemed
ready to sign anyone for any price. It
was fun and it was delightful.
Am I now climbing to the light,
chastened by the Yankees and ready
to start screaming about big-spend
ing teams again? Certainly not. I en
joy teams with competitive resources
more than I enjoy teams without
them. It's strange that I loathed
Frank McCourt for running the
Dodgers as a business, even though
it was within his rights to siphon
money from the team that he owned.
But sports are more than that: They
are a sacred trust, and if a team
needs to act as a nonprofit in order to
win, I certainly think it should do so.
Here we are, though, in a land
where the Lakers' season is dead in
the water and the Dodgers are not
buying everyone in sight. The
Dodgers, powered by their absurd
new TV deal, will keep on spending
money, and the Lakers will probably
end up getting a top-five draft pick
and reload for a new generation of
basketball success. But the Dodgers'
dreams are now clearly constrained
by reality, and the Yankees are back
to normal. Somehow it feels comfort
ing. Somehow it feels natural. I might
regret that feeling later on, but for
now, I at least don't feel like a hog let
loose in the buffet at the Ritz.

Winston Shi is moving to Japan in
order to become the next superstar
baseball sensation. Tell Winston that
MLB franchises generally don't sign
columnists to $2OO million contracts
at ivshi9Jf@stcrnford.edu and sug
gest some alternate career options.

We have been lulled into a sense
of security in which the Dodgers
would simply buy any target suppos
edly worth getting. When the Walter
era was getting into swing, I made a
joke that the Dodgers would sign
Michael Vick to play left field. It did

ready to sign anyone for any price. It
was fun and it was delightful.
Am I now climbing to the light,
chastened by the Yankees and ready

Dodgers as a business, even though
it was within his rights to siphon
money from the team that he owned.

are a sacred trust, and if a team

end up getting a top-five draft pick
and reload for a new generation of
basketball success. But the Dodgers'
dreams are now clearly constrained
by reality, and the Yankees are back
to normal. Somehow it feels comfort

regret that feeling later on, but for
now, I at least don't feel like a hog let
loose in the buffet at the Ritz.

It is the night of January22,2ol4.
I finally have time to relax and
think, and the first thought that
comes to mind is that the Los
Angeles Dodgers have finally
been outbid for a player.
Japanese ace pitcher Masahiro
Tanaka, formerly of Rakuten, signed
with the New Yirk Yankees for a total
outlay of $175 million. It's trite at this
point to compare sports salaries to oth
er nations' GDPs, so I will pass over the
fact that the figure is larger than the an
nual economic output of Kiribati. Let it
simply be known that Tanaka will be
paid very well to throw balls very hard,
and that since he will be throwing the
majority of his balls in New York, we
will never hear* the end of it.
This announcement came on the
heels of Clayton Kershaw's $215 mil
lion deal to stay in Los Angeles, and so
it is a testament to the largesse of the
Dodgers that an act so utterly typify
ing the New York Yankees was never
theless completely unexpected.
The Yankees didn't just spend $175
million on a pitcher; they spent $175
million on a pitcher who has already
thrown 1,315 innings. 1,315 innings by
age 24! $175 million for a pitcher from
a league where Tanaka threw 160
pitches in a 4-2 complete game loss
a loss in which Rakuten never led af
ter the fifth inning and then closed
out the season the very next day $175
million for a pitcher who has never
thrown a pitch in the major leagues.
It's a contract that makes those of Yu
Darvish and Daisuke Matsuzaka look
beggarly in comparison.
The Yankees, who spent the entire
fall talking about how they wanted to
avoid the luxury tax, have decided to
go supernova. After the signings of
Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury and Brian
McCann, it's clear that baseball's
biggest team has glanced at Bud
Selig's tiny little speed bump and
driven over it with a steam train. In
a life that has been spent watching
the Yankees spend large amounts of
money whenever they felt like it, Tana
ka's signing might have been the most
"New York Yankees thing" ever.
Order, it seems, has finally been re
stored.
As I said, it's a testament to Dodger
owner Mark Walter's pocketbook that
I never* expected this to happen.
If you really think about it, the
Dodgers never even needed Tanaka's
services at all. The Dodgers have ar
guably the best pitching staff in the
league. Their bullpen, normally the
domain of a closer* and some league
minimum relievers, is close to the
most expensive. And yet, even after
the Yankees spent $214 million to
move Ichiro Suzuki to the bench, I
never expected that Tanaka would put
on pinstripes.
