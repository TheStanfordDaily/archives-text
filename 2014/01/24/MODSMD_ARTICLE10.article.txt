## FOOTBALL Change awaits Cardinal 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
In the three weeks since the Rose Bowl
Game on Jan. 1, Stanford football has seen
its fair share of change. That change will be
toughest to overcome in three main phases:
coaching, current personnel and recruiting.

ing game, Mike Sanford, and its top defen

sive mind, Derek Mason, have left to be
come the offensive coordinator at Boise
State and head coach at Vanderbilt, respec
tively. Mason is reportedly taking a few
members of the Cardinal staff with him,
most notably inside linebackers coach David
Kotulski, who confirmed on Twitter that he
has accepted the Vanderbilt defensive coor
dinator position.
Not only were Sanford and Mason criti
cal on game days, they also were two of the
best recruiters on the Cardinal's staff. Outside
linebackers coach Lance Anderson, who also
serves as the program's liaison to the Stanford
Office of Undergraduate Admissions, is the
most experienced recruiter who is still a Stan
ford assistant.
Anderson, who is helping secure the Car
dinal's recruiting class before National Signing
Day on Feb. 5, has been mentioned as a pos
sible replacement for Mason at defensive co
ordinator. Anderson was previously the re
cruiting coordinator for the Cardinal, and ac
cording to former head coach Jim Harbaugh,
Anderson's recruiting prowess was so great
that he was the most important person in the
recent rise of Stanford football. Last week, a
source told ESPN's Joe Schad that Anderson
would become the program's new defensive
coordinator.
Even with the recent coaching depar
tures, Stanford's recruiting has been success
ful as of late. The biggest recruiting wins this
month came in the form of four-star tight end
Dalton Schultz and four-star offensive tackle
Casey Tucker. Schultz was one of the most
prized tight ends in this recruiting class, and
Stanford beat out Schultz's hometown school
of Utah and national powers like Notre Dame.
The Cardinal hopes that combination of
Schultz and the highly touted tight end re

cruits of 2013 will fill the void at the position
that plagued the Cardinal throughout the
2013 season.
Tucker, one of the top-10 offensive tack
les in this recruiting class, committed to the
Cardinal over hometown school Arizona State
and became just the second offensive lineman
to commit to the Cardinal so far. He is cur
rently the highest-ranked member of the ES
PN 300 to have committed to Stanford.
There were two prospects that decom
mitted from the Cardinal during the month of
January: safety Kirk Tucker and defensive line
man Nifae Lealao. The coaching departures of
Mason and Sanford did not appear to be im
portant factors in the players' decommit
ments. According to Kirk Tucker's high school
coach, the safety was not admitted to Stan
ford, forcing the decommitment. No official
word has emerged on the reasons for Lealao's
change of heart.
The Cardinal will hope that it can avoid
losing any more recruits, as there will be plen
ty of departures from the current team. In ad
dition to the seniors and fifth-year seniors
who have already exhausted their eligibility
stars like outside linebacker Trent Mur
phy, inside linebacker Shayne Skov and
running back Tyler Gaffney senior
starters Cam Fleming, Ed Reynolds and
David Yankey declared for the NFL Draft in
stead of choosing to return for their final sea
sons of eligibility.
Over the next few weeks, all of the
coaching moves should be finalized, and all
2014 recruits will make their final decisions
by signing letters of intent. During that time,
Stanford's current players will be condition
ing with famed strength and conditioning
coach Shannon Turley, looking to build stam
ina and add strength for spring football,
which will start up in February and culmi
nate with the Spring Game at Stanford Sta
dium on April 12 at 1 p.m.
