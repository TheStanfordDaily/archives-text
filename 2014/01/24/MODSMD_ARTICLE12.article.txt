# LA's outdoor hockey game just a novelty
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
On Saturday night, I'll be in the
stands to watch my beloved San
Jose Sharks take on the Min
nesota Wild. And for the first
time in my life, I might feel like
I'm missing out.

That's be
cause 350 miles
south of SAP Cen
ter, another hock
ey game will be
taking place be
tween perhaps my
two least favorite
teams: the Los An
geles Kings and

Anaheim Ducks. It's not the prospect of
Dustin Brown and Corey Perry beating
each other to a pulp that makes me wish I
could see the showdown; it's the fact that
the game will be played in neither Staples
Center nor the Honda Center.
It will be played in Dodger Stadium.
Saturday's 6:30 p.m. tilt on NBC
Sports Network, part of the NHLs Stadium
Series, will be the first outdoor game in
league history played west of Calgary. Un
less, like The Daily's resident Canada ex
pert Ed Ngai, you know where that is, just
consider the frigid locations of the league's
previous outdoor showcases: Edmonton,
Buffalo, Chicago, Boston, Pittsburgh, Cal
gary, Philadelphia and Ann Arbor. Those
cities' average winter low in 2013 was two
below zero; LA has been in the 80s for
much of this month.
In light of everybody's knee-jerk reac
tion regarding the weather, much has been
made of the technology being used to keep
the Dodger Stadium ice cooled during the
day and the fact that the game-time
temperature will actually be a bit below
that of an ordinary NHL stadium.
But that doesn't take away from how
awesome this all seems. People have been
bubbling about the thought of an outdoor
game in California for years. Case in point:
Two years ago, when I wrote about the

prospect of making ice hockey a Pac-12 sport,
a reader and former minor league hockey play
er emailed me suggesting that the Sharks host
the NHLs annual outdoor game, the Winter
Classic, at Stanford Stadium.
So I'm a bit upset that I can't watch the
Kings-Ducks game. I guess I'll catch it next
time, right?
We 11... maybe not. Chances are that the
greatest state on Earth will host an outdoor
version of the greatest sport on Earth in the
future, but I'm not so sure it will have the
same appeal.
The only reason NHL fans are excited for
Saturday's game is its novelty. The Winter
Classic, on the other hand, is an annual
showcase for the sport, and drew millions of
viewers and a crowd of over 100,000 fans
three weeks ago. It's lasted six years be
cause of its spot in the national spectacle
and its focus on youth hockey. And don't for
get HBO's 24/7 series, a reality show that
tracks the two teams leading up to the event
and gives fans an unprecedented look into

NHL locker rooms. By contrast, 60 minutes
of skating under the Hollywood sign feels a
bit hollow.
This game shouldn't have been lumped
with the rest of the Stadium Series, which
features four outdoor games (not counting
the Winter Classic) this season. It should
have been a unique tribute to what makes
California hockey special: its exponential
growth for youth over the last 30 years, the
Stanley Cups won in the last decade by Ana
heim and LA and the role that The Great One
played in bringing the sport out West. Instead,
all anyone cares about is the refrigeration sys
tem behind the center field fence.
This game should have highlighted the
state's three rich hockey rivalries and inspired
an annual outdoor series on the West Coast.
Instead, the event's organizers plopped down
a beach volleyball court in left field.
This game should have become a tradi
tion. Instead, it's going to be a flash in the pan.

Joseph Beyda was trying to get the Sharks-
Wild game moved to AT&T Park but was ve
toed by the NHL because it was worried that
the players from frigid Minnesota would melt in
the sunny California weather. Send Joey your

tracks the two teams leading up to the event
and gives fans an unprecedented look into

NHL locker rooms. By contrast, 60 minutes
of skating under the Hollywood sign feels a
bit hollow.
This game shouldn't have been lumped
with the rest of the Stadium Series, which
features four outdoor games (not counting
the Winter Classic) this season. It should
have been a unique tribute to what makes
California hockey special: its exponential
growth for youth over the last 30 years, the
Stanley Cups won in the last decade by Ana
heim and LA and the role that The Great One
played in bringing the sport out West. Instead,
all anyone cares about is the refrigeration sys
tem behind the center field fence.
This game should have highlighted the
state's three rich hockey rivalries and inspired
an annual outdoor series on the West Coast.
Instead, the event's organizers plopped down
a beach volleyball court in left field.
This game should have become a tradi
tion. Instead, it's going to be a flash in the pan.

Joseph Beyda was trying to get the Sharks-
Wild game moved to AT&T Park but was ve
toed by the NHL because it was worried that
the players from frigid Minnesota would melt in
the sunny California weather. Send Joey your
