## Card hosts Arizona schools 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK DESK EDITOR 
Avery Aquatic Center will play host to a
doubleheader of dual meets this weekend
when Arizona and Arizona State visit the farm
to do battle with Stanford's pair of undefeat
ed teams.
The No. 11 men's team (3-0, 0-0 Pac-12)
will open its conference season against No. 5
Arizona (1-2, 0-2) and Arizona State (1-3, 0-
2), and the No. 2 women's team (5-0, 2-0)
will take to the pool for the first time in 2014
against No. 10 Arizona's (4-1, 2-1) and Ari
zona State's (2-4, 1-3) women as both Cardi
nal squads will aim to continue strong starts
to their seasons.
Last season, the men's team defeated
both Arizona State and Arizona on the road
the latter of which was a big upset victory
for the Cardinal over the top-ranked Wildcats.
"Arizona has one of the most complete
teams in the nation," head coach Ted Knapp
told GoStanford.com. "They have both quali
ty and depth in almost all events, which also
speaks well to their strength in relays. They

also have a great diver that will match up well
with our diving corps."
The men have plenty of momentum to
build on after they dismantled Pacific in their
first dual meet of the season two weekends
ago, a very strong showing in which they post-

Ed the fastest time in every event. Junior David
Nolan was named the Philip Hunsaker Men's
Division I Swimmer of the Week for his efforts
in the win, in which he collected two individ
ual victories and contributed to two relay vic
tories.
Meanwhile, the women have looked
strong all season long but are coming off of a
victory against Texas in which they struggled
early before rebounding to win in the final
event. The Cardinal is led by seniors Felicia
Lee and Maya Di√üado, who own the team's
fastest times in three events each, along with
junior sprinter Maddy Schaefer, who is cur
rently tied for the nation's best time in the
50-yard freestyle with Wildcats senior Margo
Geer. That race in this weekend's event will
pit two of the premier sprinters in the coun
try against each other.
The coed meets against Arizona and Ari
zona State will take place on Saturday at 2
p.m. and Sunday at noon, respectively, with
the women going first in each event and alter
nating with the men.
