# ARTS & LIFE
## TOP TEN:Things I Learned My First Quarter on the Farm 
### ANDREW VOGELEY 
As we begin what I'm told
is the worst quarter of
the year, it is an oppor
tune time to reflect on
the previous one. Com
ing in as a freshman, I
had lots of questions, both about
Stanford and college life in gen
eral. Some of them were an
swered over the course of the
fall; others were not (for in
stance, I still have no clue where
FroSoCo is). Here are the top 10
things I learned in my first 10
weeks on the Farm:
You will (probably) get
homesick at some point. Living
away from home is different. You
don't have the usual support sys
tem. Most of my friends couldn't
wait to get home for break. On the
flip side, though, you're not weird
if you don't get homesick. I was so
busy the first few weeks adjusting
to Stanford and meeting people
that it seemed I just didn't have
time to miss home.
2 Your friends from high
school may change a little, but
they will still be your friends. As
I checked in with hometown
friends over the course of the
quarter, I could tell some of
them had changed, so I was con
cerned that when we all got back
home and hung out, something
would be different. You can
imagine my relief when this
proved not to be the case. Yes, it
was different but not to the
point that old friendships
couldn't be sustained.

3 The quarter system
moves fast, really fast. I'm not
exactly sure when this realization
hit me, but I think it was some
where between weeks two and
three, when I had to read an en
tire book for my history class in a
single week. That week in class,
we covered 75 years of history. A
piece of advice to my fellow fresh
men don't fall behind. Ever.
4 Cream is pretty awe
some. There's not much to say
about this other than that the
people who own Cream must
make tons of money every
time I go down University, there
is a line out the door.
5 Always keep your room
key with you. Or else you'll end
up writing lovely poems for the
Cedro staff or having to awkward
ly knock on the door when your
roommate is asleep. College is
about responsibility, right? So I
guess that starts with remember
ing your room key.
G There is always some
one new to meet. I was fortunate
to find a close group of friends
early in the quarter, but I didn't
stop making friends. Even though
Stanford is a relatively small
school, it's much bigger than my
high school. It took some adjust
ing to realize that I was going to
be seeing new faces every day.
But once I got over that, it's fun to
view all these new people as po
tential friends.
7 Midterms aren't exams
that occur at the halfway point of the quar
ter. I was lucky in that my first quarter
midterms didn't occur that far away from
week five, but watching people in my
dorm freak out about midterms all the way
from week two to week nine made me re
alize that one day I too will take a midterm
that will not be in the middle of the term.
I don't look forward to that day (which is ac
tually going to be in a week).
8 Taking notes on a laptop is a risky
proposition. My high school didn't let us use
computers in class, so I always took notes by
hand. I came here and realized you could
take notes on a laptop or iPad in bigger lec
tures but this, my friends, is not a good
idea. Unless you have unbelievable willpow
er, I wouldn't recommend it. Before last
quarter, I never knew email could be such

an enthralling distraction.
9 Stanford is special because of the
people. The biggest thing I learned about
Stanford is how normal yet talented the stu
dents are. While I had visited campus before
accepting my admission spot, I had little clue
as to what the kids at Stanford would be like.
(Admit Weekend was just overwhelming, so
I didn't really get much from that.) So, I was
pleasantly surprised to find a diverse group of
people that shared my interests and mindset.
10 I get to do this 11 more times.
As I sat on the Caltrain heading back to cam
pus last week, I reflected on what I wanted
to get out of this new quarter. I was trying
to put all the things I did and learned in the
first quarter in context. And then it suddenly
hit me that I have 11 more quarters at Stan
ford. Somehow, that seems like so many and
so few quarters all at once.

7 Midterms aren't exams
that occur at the halfway point of the quar
ter. I was lucky in that my first quarter
midterms didn't occur that far away from
week five, but watching people in my
dorm freak out about midterms all the way
from week two to week nine made me re
alize that one day I too will take a midterm
that will not be in the middle of the term.
I don't look forward to that day (which is ac
tually going to be in a week).
8 Taking notes on a laptop is a risky
proposition. My high school didn't let us use
computers in class, so I always took notes by
hand. I came here and realized you could
take notes on a laptop or iPad in bigger lec
tures but this, my friends, is not a good
idea. Unless you have unbelievable willpow
er, I wouldn't recommend it. Before last
quarter, I never knew email could be such

an enthralling distraction.
9 Stanford is special because of the
people. The biggest thing I learned about
Stanford is how normal yet talented the stu
dents are. While I had visited campus before
accepting my admission spot, I had little clue
as to what the kids at Stanford would be like.
(Admit Weekend was just overwhelming, so
I didn't really get much from that.) So, I was
pleasantly surprised to find a diverse group of
people that shared my interests and mindset.
10 I get to do this 11 more times.
As I sat on the Caltrain heading back to cam
pus last week, I reflected on what I wanted
to get out of this new quarter. I was trying
to put all the things I did and learned in the
first quarter in context. And then it suddenly
hit me that I have 11 more quarters at Stan
ford. Somehow, that seems like so many and
so few quarters all at once.

As we begin what I'm told
is the worst quarter of
the year, it is an oppor
tune time to reflect on
the previous one. Com
ing in as a freshman, I
had lots of questions, both about
Stanford and college life in gen
eral. Some of them were an
swered over the course of the
fall; others were not (for in
stance, I still have no clue where
FroSoCo is). Here are the top 10
things I learned in my first 10
weeks on the Farm:
You will (probably) get
homesick at some point. Living
away from home is different. You
don't have the usual support sys
tem. Most of my friends couldn't
wait to get home for break. On the
flip side, though, you're not weird
if you don't get homesick. I was so
busy the first few weeks adjusting
to Stanford and meeting people
that it seemed I just didn't have
time to miss home.
2 Your friends from high
school may change a little, but
they will still be your friends. As
I checked in with hometown
friends over the course of the
quarter, I could tell some of
them had changed, so I was con
cerned that when we all got back
home and hung out, something
would be different. You can
imagine my relief when this
proved not to be the case. Yes, it
was different but not to the
point that old friendships
couldn't be sustained.

3 The quarter system
moves fast, really fast. I'm not
exactly sure when this realization
hit me, but I think it was some
where between weeks two and
three, when I had to read an en
tire book for my history class in a
single week. That week in class,
we covered 75 years of history. A
piece of advice to my fellow fresh
men don't fall behind. Ever.
4 Cream is pretty awe
some. There's not much to say
about this other than that the
people who own Cream must
make tons of money every
time I go down University, there
is a line out the door.
5 Always keep your room
key with you. Or else you'll end
up writing lovely poems for the
Cedro staff or having to awkward
ly knock on the door when your
roommate is asleep. College is
about responsibility, right? So I
guess that starts with remember
ing your room key.
G There is always some
one new to meet. I was fortunate
to find a close group of friends
early in the quarter, but I didn't
stop making friends. Even though
Stanford is a relatively small
school, it's much bigger than my
high school. It took some adjust
ing to realize that I was going to
be seeing new faces every day.
But once I got over that, it's fun to
view all these new people as po
tential friends.
