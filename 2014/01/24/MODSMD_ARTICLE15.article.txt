## TOP TEN:Things I Learned My First Quarter on the Farm 
### ANDREW VOGELEY 
As we begin what I'm told
is the worst quarter of
the year, it is an oppor
tune time to reflect on
the previous one. Com
ing in as a freshman, I
had lots of questions, both about
Stanford and college life in gen
eral. Some of them were an
swered over the course of the
fall; others were not (for in
stance, I still have no clue where
FroSoCo is). Here are the top 10
things I learned in my first 10
weeks on the Farm:
You will (probably) get
homesick at some point. Living
away from home is different. You
don't have the usual support sys
tem. Most of my friends couldn't
wait to get home for break. On the
flip side, though, you're not weird
if you don't get homesick. I was so
busy the first few weeks adjusting
to Stanford and meeting people
that it seemed I just didn't have
time to miss home.
2 Your friends from high
school may change a little, but
they will still be your friends. As
I checked in with hometown
friends over the course of the
quarter, I could tell some of
them had changed, so I was con
cerned that when we all got back
home and hung out, something
would be different. You can
imagine my relief when this
proved not to be the case. Yes, it
was different but not to the
point that old friendships
couldn't be sustained.

3 The quarter system
moves fast, really fast. I'm not
exactly sure when this realization
hit me, but I think it was some
where between weeks two and
three, when I had to read an en
tire book for my history class in a
single week. That week in class,
we covered 75 years of history. A
piece of advice to my fellow fresh
men don't fall behind. Ever.
4 Cream is pretty awe
some. There's not much to say
about this other than that the
people who own Cream must
make tons of money every
time I go down University, there
is a line out the door.
5 Always keep your room
key with you. Or else you'll end
up writing lovely poems for the
Cedro staff or having to awkward
ly knock on the door when your
roommate is asleep. College is
about responsibility, right? So I
guess that starts with remember
ing your room key.
G There is always some
one new to meet. I was fortunate
to find a close group of friends
early in the quarter, but I didn't
stop making friends. Even though
Stanford is a relatively small
school, it's much bigger than my
high school. It took some adjust
ing to realize that I was going to
be seeing new faces every day.
But once I got over that, it's fun to
view all these new people as po
tential friends.
