# SUNDANCE: The Daily hits the road to Park City
## 
### ALEXANDRA HEENEY MANAGING EDITOR 
LLast weekend, the 30th Sundance Film Festival
opened in Park City, Utah, drawing crowds from
across the country and, to some degree, from
around the world, for this annual celebration of
American independent cinema. Thanks to The
Stanford Daily mobilizing its resources incredibly
quickly and the very generous Stanford community, in
cluding one amazing Stanford alumni family that hosted
me in Park City, I managed to get a last-minute trip or
ganized to cover my very first Sundance pilgrimage.
Although Sundance screens films from around the
world, the most exciting films tend to come from do
mestic filmmakers; many great American directors were
discovered here, such as Richard linklater, Steven
Soderbergh, Jim Jarmusch and Nicole Holofcener.
These directors frequently return to screen their latest
films and look for distributors: Linklater and Jarmusch
both have films here this year. Despite the focus on
homegrown talent, it is an important stop on the festival
circuit for world cinema, since it's often the place where
gems that are not necessarily commercial, like 201 l's
"Oslo August 31 st," get picked up for a North American
release.
The festival happens about halfway through the
film year, which officially starts with Cannes in May and
then continues with the Toronto International Film Fes
tival in September. Sundance offers a mix of films pre
viously on the festival circuit like "Stranger by the

Lake," "Only Lovers Left Alive" and "Blue Ruin" this
year as well as premieres of highly anticipated films
by seasoned directors, like the world premiere of
Richard linklater's "Before Midnight" last year and his
12-year-project "Boyhood" this year.
Sundance is legendary for discovering new talent,
often from films that had premieres with very little pre
screening buzz, like "Winter's Bone," "Fruitvale Sta
tion" and "Beasts of the Southern Wild" from past years.
Almost all of the premieres feature red carpets walked
by the talent and are followed by a Q&A with the direc
tor and some of the actors.
Sundance is best known for being the start of the
American documentary season: Favorites like last year's
"Twenty Feet from Stardom" and "Blackfish" were nom
inated for Academy Awards, a common trend for Sun
dance documentaries. This year, the opening night doc
umentary, "Dinosaur 13," was quickly snatched up for
distribution. "Cesar's Last Fast," about Cesar Chavez;
"Life Itself," about film critic Roger Ebert; and "The
Case Against 8," about the lawsuit to overturn Proposi
tion 8 in California, were all picked up by distributors
before they even screened.
Although Sundance makes an effort to give Utah
residents priority ticket selection, this is very much a
destination event rather than one for the locals. The lo
cals refer to us outsiders —who have the tendency to
import viruses at the height of flu season —as PIBs:
People in Black. These are mostly press and industry
from New York and LA and film fans who can afford the
$3OO-per-night hotel rooms, $2O hamburgers and the
$4O-plus fees for advanced ticket selection almost all
screenings sell out before individual tickets go on sale to
the public. The serious film buffs try to cram in three to
five films a day, often forgoing meals to do so, which is
a bit easier for those of us in the press, since our screen
ings are all at the same venue. Those here more for the
red carpet excitement will be trying to get into the
many parties and receptions happening around town.
Screenings happen in venues across Park City in
created screening rooms. The auditorium at the local
high school hosts the big premieres like Maya Forbes's


Courtesy of "Boyhood"
"Infinitely Polar Bear." The 1920s Egyptian
Theatre, which is usually a site for local the
ater, hosts some of the more avant-garde
films, like this year's 'A Girl Walks Home
Alone at Night," the first Iranian vampire
western. Even the local library gets trans
formed into a temporary screening room.
Some films have lived up to their buzz,
like Lenny Abrahamson's excellent offbeat
comedy "Frank," about a musician who lives
inside a papier-mache head, and Richard lin

klater's latest masterpiece, "Boyhood." Oth
ers were not-so-surprising disappointments
like Stuart Murdoch's directorial debut, the
musical "God Help the Girl." As the front
man for the Scottish indie pop band, Belle
and Sebastian, which performed here on
Sunday night, his film got a lot of buzz, but
despite some charms, it was too long, too in
choate and easily forgettable.
I haven't yet had the chance to discover
any great new filmmakers most films by

newcomers were okay but not great, with
the best films coming from seasoned direc
tors but for a festival with more than 100
films, it's not possible to see them all. And it
only takes one to make the next Jennifer
Lawrence, whose debut performance in
"Winter's Bone," which premiered at Sun
dance, launched her into stardom.

American documentary season: Favorites like last year's
"Twenty Feet from Stardom" and "Blackfish" were nom
inated for Academy Awards, a common trend for Sun
dance documentaries. This year, the opening night doc
umentary, "Dinosaur 13," was quickly snatched up for
distribution. "Cesar's Last Fast," about Cesar Chavez;
"Life Itself," about film critic Roger Ebert; and "The
Case Against 8," about the lawsuit to overturn Proposi
tion 8 in California, were all picked up by distributors
before they even screened.
Although Sundance makes an effort to give Utah
residents priority ticket selection, this is very much a
destination event rather than one for the locals. The lo
cals refer to us outsiders —who have the tendency to
import viruses at the height of flu season —as PIBs:
People in Black. These are mostly press and industry
from New York and LA and film fans who can afford the
$3OO-per-night hotel rooms, $2O hamburgers and the
$4O-plus fees for advanced ticket selection almost all
screenings sell out before individual tickets go on sale to
the public. The serious film buffs try to cram in three to
five films a day, often forgoing meals to do so, which is
a bit easier for those of us in the press, since our screen
ings are all at the same venue. Those here more for the
red carpet excitement will be trying to get into the
many parties and receptions happening around town.
Screenings happen in venues across Park City in
created screening rooms. The auditorium at the local
high school hosts the big premieres like Maya Forbes's

"Infinitely Polar Bear." The 1920s Egyptian
Theatre, which is usually a site for local the
ater, hosts some of the more avant-garde
films, like this year's 'A Girl Walks Home
Alone at Night," the first Iranian vampire
western. Even the local library gets trans
formed into a temporary screening room.
Some films have lived up to their buzz,
like Lenny Abrahamson's excellent offbeat
comedy "Frank," about a musician who lives
inside a papier-mache head, and Richard lin

klater's latest masterpiece, "Boyhood." Oth
ers were not-so-surprising disappointments
like Stuart Murdoch's directorial debut, the
musical "God Help the Girl." As the front
man for the Scottish indie pop band, Belle
and Sebastian, which performed here on
Sunday night, his film got a lot of buzz, but
despite some charms, it was too long, too in
choate and easily forgettable.
I haven't yet had the chance to discover
any great new filmmakers most films by

newcomers were okay but not great, with
the best films coming from seasoned direc
tors but for a festival with more than 100
films, it's not possible to see them all. And it
only takes one to make the next Jennifer
Lawrence, whose debut performance in
"Winter's Bone," which premiered at Sun
dance, launched her into stardom.

LLast weekend, the 30th Sundance Film Festival
opened in Park City, Utah, drawing crowds from
across the country and, to some degree, from
around the world, for this annual celebration of
American independent cinema. Thanks to The
Stanford Daily mobilizing its resources incredibly
quickly and the very generous Stanford community, in
cluding one amazing Stanford alumni family that hosted
me in Park City, I managed to get a last-minute trip or
ganized to cover my very first Sundance pilgrimage.
Although Sundance screens films from around the
world, the most exciting films tend to come from do
mestic filmmakers; many great American directors were
discovered here, such as Richard linklater, Steven
Soderbergh, Jim Jarmusch and Nicole Holofcener.
These directors frequently return to screen their latest
films and look for distributors: Linklater and Jarmusch
both have films here this year. Despite the focus on
homegrown talent, it is an important stop on the festival
circuit for world cinema, since it's often the place where
gems that are not necessarily commercial, like 201 l's
"Oslo August 31 st," get picked up for a North American
release.
The festival happens about halfway through the
film year, which officially starts with Cannes in May and
then continues with the Toronto International Film Fes
tival in September. Sundance offers a mix of films pre
viously on the festival circuit like "Stranger by the

Lake," "Only Lovers Left Alive" and "Blue Ruin" this
year as well as premieres of highly anticipated films
by seasoned directors, like the world premiere of
Richard linklater's "Before Midnight" last year and his
12-year-project "Boyhood" this year.
Sundance is legendary for discovering new talent,
often from films that had premieres with very little pre
screening buzz, like "Winter's Bone," "Fruitvale Sta
tion" and "Beasts of the Southern Wild" from past years.
Almost all of the premieres feature red carpets walked
by the talent and are followed by a Q&A with the direc
tor and some of the actors.
