# Roxy Sass: Getting It In Abroad
## 
### ROXY SASS 
Study abroad can open up a whole new world
for Stanford students exotic locales, cul
tural experiences, but most importantly...
new places (and people) to bone. Though
she'll always have a soft spot for the hard-ons
of the SAE dance floor, even Roxy admits that
sometimes it's nice to get (some) away from cam
pus. You don't have to be studying in Australia to go
"down under" here are some of Roxy's tips for
how to make the most of your time overseas.
Meeting the locals
Though the other people in your abroad group
may be easy targets (at least they are for Roxy), it's
more fun to sample the local cuisine. Take advantage
of the chance to meet an authentic member (wink)
of a foreign country... the folks at BOSP will be so
proud. Bonus: this kind of full "immersion" is a great
way to beef up your language skills. How do you think
Roxy learned all her French? Voulez-vous...
Weekend getaways
As any Stanfordite abroad knows, unlike on cam
pus, weekends are not just for beer pong and midterm
cramming. No, they are a chance to explore and
Roxy doesn't just mean checking out the churches in
Florence ... a pied-a-terre in Paris is more her style. If
you survive your sketchy Ryanair flight, treat yourself
to a weekend of woohoo in a cute Airbnb.
Picturesque trysts
Campus may boast some exciting places to
hook up (you know Roxy loves those Green stacks),
but nothing can compare to the opportunities you'll
have abroad. Sexy dancing in Berlin disco clubs,
kisses in the rain on Roman street corners. Roxy's
getting hot just thinking about it. Note: your bed
room at your host family's apartment doesn't count
as exotic. Take it from Roxy you don't want to try
to explain in a different language just what you were
doing with those furry handcuffs and that cute
Spanish boy from down the street.

Got too many requirements to go abroad? Voyage
across campus instead Roxy may not be foreign,
but she'll still have you speaking in tongues. Email
