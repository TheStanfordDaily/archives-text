# Fashion Spotlingt The Trials and Tribulations of Trends
## 
### LAYNIE STEPHENS FASHION COLUMNIST 
Trends: a very controversial topic. What is
so appealing about them, anyway? Al
though they're intended to be light
hearted and fun, they don't always
end up that way. To some, they may
seem like little fashion challenges that
one can play around with, but that's not al
ways the case. This week, I want to address
common critiques of trends.
Trends inevitably convey a very strong
message. When coming from elite fashion
magazines, they can imply, "You have to be
this thin, or this tall, or this skin tone to be
able to pull off this look." But how is that
real if we all are different shapes and sizes?
This is definitely something worth thinking
about.

Some may say that this is not the case
at all. Although trends are portrayed in a
very specific manner in fashion magazines,
part of the fun is taking that as an inspira
tion and, in turn, doing whatever you want
from there. Let's pretend that the biggest
trend right now is the crop top. For exam
ple: although that crop top might not work
on me the same way as the model, I can
think about playing around with different
waistlines and silhouettes created by my
clothing. It's true that it's not exactly the
same, but who said we all need to take
those magazines so seriously anyway?
But there's always the haute couture
fashionista who will say that trends are
very particular. And that's partly true: A
crop top is a crop top, and there's not really
any other way to make something that's
not a crop top a crop top. And if I feel like

I can't pull off a crop top, I'm excluded
from the latest and greatest fashion trend
of the moment. It makes me not "fashion
able" enough for haute couture that sea
son.
This makes fashion sound really exclu
sive. But trust me, it's not. Fashion is all
about self-expression, and the way we view
it really makes all the difference. There are
no "rules" in fashion only opinions. You
really can wear whatever you want, when
ever you want. At least here in the United
States, no one's going to punish you for
what's on your body.
So take a risk. The trends are there for
your inspiration, but in reality the world is
your oyster when it comes to deciding
what style you want to adopt. If you don't

like the current trends, start your own trends!
Even if they don't become universally popular,
you'll look like the best version of yourself
that you could imagine, and that's something
beautiful.

So even though I'll be forecasting trends
in the upcoming weeks, don't feel tied down
to them. They're simply suggestions for how
to change your image if you're feeling festive
or daring in the fashion world. Take them as a
challenge and a one-of-a-kind way to express
yourself.
