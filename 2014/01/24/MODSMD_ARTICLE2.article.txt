## Limited exceptions to travel policy 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Despite the University's policy of pro
hibiting Stanford funded, organized or
sponsored trips for undergraduates to
countries on the State Department's travel
warning list, trips to Israel and Mexico
have been granted exceptions in the past
two years.
According to Stephanie Kalfayan, vice
provost for academic affairs, the two excep
tions have been made for faculty-organized
trips that provide an educational benefit in
a carefully planned program and are re
viewed in advance to minimize risk.
Steven Weitzman, a Religious Studies
professor, led an overseas seminar to Israel
last summer through the Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP). According to the
State Department travel warning, US citi
zens are warned against traveling to areas
in Israel.
"We were able to travel to Israel and
have this seminar by agreeing to stay out of
certain areas, like the West Bank or Gaza
Strip," Weitzman said.
In order to make it possible to take stu
dents to Israel, Weitzman had to fill out a
petition to the provost in order to travel to

that country.
"Two years ago, the [Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford] committee
made some recommendations to encour
age the University to encourage more trav
el for the students, thus making the policy
more flexible," he said. "We weren't going
around a ban, necessarily, but we had to
understand the risks and try to minimize
them while in Israel [by staying out of cer
tain places]."
Kalfayan said this trip was approved

because of the educational benefit and
need for that type of program, as well as
the capability of BOSP and the participants
to take on the added responsibilities re
quired to manage the risk. The trip to Israel
was subsidized by BOSR
There are other trips to Israel that are
not required to adhere to the program, ac
cording to Rabbi Serena Eisenberg.

Last summer, Stanford students traveled to Israel through a program organized by
Hillel at Stanford, which does not receive funding from the University.
