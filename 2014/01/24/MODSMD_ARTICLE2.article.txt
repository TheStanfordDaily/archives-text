## Limited exceptions to travel policy 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Despite the University's policy of pro
hibiting Stanford funded, organized or
sponsored trips for undergraduates to
countries on the State Department's travel
warning list, trips to Israel and Mexico
have been granted exceptions in the past
two years.
According to Stephanie Kalfayan, vice
provost for academic affairs, the two excep
tions have been made for faculty-organized
trips that provide an educational benefit in
a carefully planned program and are re
viewed in advance to minimize risk.
Steven Weitzman, a Religious Studies
professor, led an overseas seminar to Israel
last summer through the Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP). According to the
State Department travel warning, US citi
zens are warned against traveling to areas
in Israel.
"We were able to travel to Israel and
have this seminar by agreeing to stay out of
certain areas, like the West Bank or Gaza
Strip," Weitzman said.
In order to make it possible to take stu
dents to Israel, Weitzman had to fill out a
petition to the provost in order to travel to

that country.
"Two years ago, the [Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford] committee
made some recommendations to encour
age the University to encourage more trav
el for the students, thus making the policy
more flexible," he said. "We weren't going
around a ban, necessarily, but we had to
understand the risks and try to minimize
them while in Israel [by staying out of cer
tain places]."
Kalfayan said this trip was approved

because of the educational benefit and
need for that type of program, as well as
the capability of BOSP and the participants
to take on the added responsibilities re
quired to manage the risk. The trip to Israel
was subsidized by BOSR
There are other trips to Israel that are
not required to adhere to the program, ac
cording to Rabbi Serena Eisenberg.

ization, and therefore not subject to these re
strictions [from Stanford], since we do not re
ceive Stanford funding for our programs," she
said. "Over the past several years, Hillel has
sponsored Israel travel opportunities for Jew
ish and non-Jewish students on campus."
Eisenberg added that the Graduate
School of Business organizes an Israel trip
with about 40 business students each spring,
but graduate students are not required to ad
here to the policy. She also noted that the
wording in the State Department travel advi
sory changed with respect to Israel in June
2013, encouraging visitors to major metropol
itan areas.
Mexico is another country listed on the
State Department's warning list; Oaxaca,
however, is not located in one of the warning
areas.
"The State Department travel warning to
Mexico is not national, but regional, and the
state of Oaxaca itself has no travel restric
tions," Gabriel Garcia, professor of medicine
and faculty leader of the Oaxaca program,
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"[We] petitioned the provost's office to
start our... program and after appropriate in
vestigation and discussion with them and the
University's International Office, our overseas
program was approved, with significant re

strictions that aim to enhance the safety and
well-being of our students," he added.
These restrictions include flying directly
from the United States to Oaxaca, having
course faculty and Chile Family Health Inter
national colleagues onsite at all times during
the program and limiting in-country travel to
the capital and nearby communities.
Many peer institutions have addressed
similar issues with respect to student travel to
Israel and other countries on the travel adviso
ry list, Eisenberg said.
"In some cases, the University requires
an additional student waiver, in recognition of
potential risk and liability," she said. "Some
have partnerships with Israeli institutions and
some administer faculty-led programs."
"What all these programs have in com
mon is that they allow some kind of overseas
studies in Israel, provide advising and the
planning of an academic program and allow
students to use University financial aid and
other resources," she added.
Eisenberg said that Harvard University
runs a faculty-led summer school program in Is
rael and in 2009, the UC system restored over
seas studies in Israel, including a program at the
Hebrew University. In 2011, the Cal State sys
tem restored overseas studies in Israel.
"A lot of our peer institutions have those
programs put in place," Weitzman said. "It
was time for us to do the same."

Despite the University's policy of pro
hibiting Stanford funded, organized or
sponsored trips for undergraduates to
countries on the State Department's travel
warning list, trips to Israel and Mexico
have been granted exceptions in the past
two years.
According to Stephanie Kalfayan, vice
provost for academic affairs, the two excep
tions have been made for faculty-organized
trips that provide an educational benefit in
a carefully planned program and are re
viewed in advance to minimize risk.
Steven Weitzman, a Religious Studies
professor, led an overseas seminar to Israel
last summer through the Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP). According to the
State Department travel warning, US citi
zens are warned against traveling to areas
in Israel.
"We were able to travel to Israel and
have this seminar by agreeing to stay out of
certain areas, like the West Bank or Gaza
Strip," Weitzman said.
In order to make it possible to take stu
dents to Israel, Weitzman had to fill out a
petition to the provost in order to travel to

that country.
"Two years ago, the [Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford] committee
made some recommendations to encour
age the University to encourage more trav
el for the students, thus making the policy
more flexible," he said. "We weren't going
around a ban, necessarily, but we had to
understand the risks and try to minimize
them while in Israel [by staying out of cer
tain places]."
Kalfayan said this trip was approved

because of the educational benefit and
need for that type of program, as well as
the capability of BOSP and the participants
to take on the added responsibilities re
quired to manage the risk. The trip to Israel
was subsidized by BOSR
There are other trips to Israel that are
not required to adhere to the program, ac
cording to Rabbi Serena Eisenberg.

ization, and therefore not subject to these re
strictions [from Stanford], since we do not re
ceive Stanford funding for our programs," she
said. "Over the past several years, Hillel has
sponsored Israel travel opportunities for Jew
ish and non-Jewish students on campus."
Eisenberg added that the Graduate
School of Business organizes an Israel trip
with about 40 business students each spring,
but graduate students are not required to ad
here to the policy. She also noted that the
wording in the State Department travel advi
sory changed with respect to Israel in June
2013, encouraging visitors to major metropol
itan areas.
Mexico is another country listed on the
State Department's warning list; Oaxaca,
however, is not located in one of the warning
areas.
"The State Department travel warning to
Mexico is not national, but regional, and the
state of Oaxaca itself has no travel restric
tions," Gabriel Garcia, professor of medicine
and faculty leader of the Oaxaca program,
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"[We] petitioned the provost's office to
start our... program and after appropriate in
vestigation and discussion with them and the
University's International Office, our overseas
program was approved, with significant re

strictions that aim to enhance the safety and
well-being of our students," he added.
These restrictions include flying directly
from the United States to Oaxaca, having
course faculty and Chile Family Health Inter
national colleagues onsite at all times during
the program and limiting in-country travel to
the capital and nearby communities.
Many peer institutions have addressed
similar issues with respect to student travel to
Israel and other countries on the travel adviso
ry list, Eisenberg said.
"In some cases, the University requires
an additional student waiver, in recognition of
potential risk and liability," she said. "Some
have partnerships with Israeli institutions and
some administer faculty-led programs."
"What all these programs have in com
mon is that they allow some kind of overseas
studies in Israel, provide advising and the
planning of an academic program and allow
students to use University financial aid and
other resources," she added.
Eisenberg said that Harvard University
runs a faculty-led summer school program in Is
rael and in 2009, the UC system restored over
seas studies in Israel, including a program at the
Hebrew University. In 2011, the Cal State sys
tem restored overseas studies in Israel.
"A lot of our peer institutions have those
programs put in place," Weitzman said. "It
was time for us to do the same."
