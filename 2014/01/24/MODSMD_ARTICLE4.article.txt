# Students weigh costs of studying overseas

### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
Though tuition and housing costs for
students participating in Stanford overseas
programs are covered by financial aid, the
high incidental expenses of living abroad
can hit students hard.
Brenda Munoz 'l4, who was part of
the Bing Overseas Study Program (BOSP)
in Paris in Autumn 2012, organized a sem
inar on the affordability of study abroad
programs last April. She said that students

at the event, which was held in partner
ship with El Centro Chicano and First-
Generation Low-Income Partnership
(FLIP), spoke of the divide between stu
dents who could afford to spend more
money to take advantage of their experi
ences and those who couldn't.
"When you're abroad, it's kind of dif
ferent," she said. "A lot of people who go
abroad go on weekend trips, like to
Barcelona or other nearby cities."
She explained that finances prevented
some students from participating in addi

tional travel.
The BOSP website states that "apart
from airfare and personal travel expenses,
the basic cost of studying with BOSP is
close to the cost of remaining on campus."
