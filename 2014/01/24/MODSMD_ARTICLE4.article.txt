# Students weigh costs of studying overseas
## 
### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
Though tuition and housing costs for
students participating in Stanford overseas
programs are covered by financial aid, the
high incidental expenses of living abroad
can hit students hard.
Brenda Munoz 'l4, who was part of
the Bing Overseas Study Program (BOSP)
in Paris in Autumn 2012, organized a sem
inar on the affordability of study abroad
programs last April. She said that students

at the event, which was held in partner
ship with El Centro Chicano and First-
Generation Low-Income Partnership
(FLIP), spoke of the divide between stu
dents who could afford to spend more
money to take advantage of their experi
ences and those who couldn't.
"When you're abroad, it's kind of dif
ferent," she said. "A lot of people who go
abroad go on weekend trips, like to
Barcelona or other nearby cities."
She explained that finances prevented
some students from participating in addi

tional travel.
The BOSP website states that "apart
from airfare and personal travel expenses,
the basic cost of studying with BOSP is
close to the cost of remaining on campus."

explained that the financial aid office estimates the ad
ditional expenses for students who are going abroad,
and then revises financial aid packages to cover those
costs.
"We actually have a list of all the students going
abroad, and what center they are going to," Cooper ex
plained. "We have a budget associated with each center,
to reflect really the cost of transportation and any specific
campuses that have known higher out of pocket expenses."
Andrea Acosta 'l4, who studied abroad at Oxford last
year, said that it was possible to live within the salary that
was provided, but additional activities like travel or eating
at restaurants would exceed the budget.
"It would require more out-of-pocket money to do
cooler, more interesting things," Acosta said. "I think that
because this is from your own initiative, it is okay that the
program doesn't provide for that."
Johnathan Bowes 'l5 said that his only major expense
during his time studying abroad in Santiago was his flight to
Chile. He said he learned how to maximize his budget
by purchasing groceries and cooking for himself, he said he
could eat for two weeks on a single week's meal stipend.
Bowes added that travel throughout the region was a
popular choice for program participants.
"There weren't two distinct groups of people the
majority would go on some of the trips, and the rest of the
people would spend time with their host families and stick
around," Bowes said. "It wasn't always due to money,
though. From my perceptions of it, it didn't seem like there
was a divide about these sorts of things."
Munoz said that the biggest issue that students face
abroad when it comes to financial issues is a feeling of iso
lation.
"I think that the issue is especially that you can feel iso
lated when you're abroad," she said. "You don't want to be
the one holding the rest of group back because of afford
ability."
The BOSP website says that specific information about
typical expenses is available in the orientation materials dis
tributed during the quarter prior to departure, and recom
mends student advisors and other recently returned stu
dents as good sources of information for developing a per
sonal budget.
However, Munoz said that at the seminar last spring,
students had many questions related to the expenses and
affordability of studying abroad for the BOSP representa
tive. She added that students told BOSP staff that financial
information was not always clear.
"We were talking about our experiences and some
things that came up were about what more BOSP could
do," Munoz said. "It was nice that they became more aware
of these issues."
