# BOSP in Florence adjusts to new requirements

"lt has been a little intimidating living in
a country where you don't really know the lan
guage," said Arielle Sison 'l5, who is currently
participating in a Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram (BOSP) in Florence.
While in the past students were required
to have completed a full year of Italian language
coursework to attend the Florence program,
there was no language prerequisite for Winter
2014, allowing students like Sison to go abroad
without any Italian language background.
"[The change] was a mutual decision,
which involved lots of parties and which took
into account also the recommendations com
ing from SUES [Study of Undergraduate Edu

cation at Stanford]," wrote Ermelinda Cam
pani, the director of Overseas Studies in Flo
rence, in an email to The Daily.
This decision, however, is temporary.
"The modification of the language re
quirement for Winter 2014 was a pilot pro
gram," Campani explained. "BOSP will consid
er the results for the Winter 2014 and Winter
2015 terms before deciding whether to ex
tend the modification."
The change in requirements appears to
have dramatically affected the popularity of the
program. Campani said that there are currently
37 students in Florence after just seven stud
ied abroad there last winter quarter. According
to information provided by BOSP Senior Pro-
gram Advisor Lee Dukes, the Au
tumn 2013 program in Florence did
not have a waitlist, but the Winter
2014 program did Mowing the sec
ond round of applications.
Additionally, more majors are
represented in this group's demo
graphics and the gender distribution,
typically two-thirds female, is almost
50-50 this quarter, Campani said.
Beyond attracting more diverse
students, dropping the language re
quirement has caused few other
changes to the program this quarter.
"The main and, really, only
change is that academic classes are
offered in English," Campani ex
plained. "We used to offer most of
our classes in a mix of English and
Italian."
Campani added that the biggest
logistical issue has been accommo
dating the various levels of language
experience for the required on-site
language course, with the program
more than doubling its class offer
ings.
"We have students who came
with no Italian, we have one Italian
major, one student who lived in Italy
in the past and all levels in be
tween," Campani wrote.

Students at Florence stay in
homestays, but to accommodate
those with no language background,
students have been matched with
families that speak English.
"We chose families where some
English is spoken," Campani wrote.
"But students take Italian here so al
so their ability to speak in Italian
with their host families increases
dramatically as the quarter pro
ceeds."
Several students who spoke to
The Daily from Florence via email
echoed this sentiment.
"It's hard to communicate with
them due to my limited background
in Italian, but as time goes by, my
knowledge of the language increases
and it becomes easier," said Nchedo
Ezeokoli 'l5 of her host family.
While Ezeokoli did not taken
Italian before arriving in Florence,
she quickly improved.
"It can be frustrating, but never
theless it's just as rewarding to see
the look of understanding on my
host family's faces when they've un
derstood my meager Italian," she
said.
Many young people in the area
also speak English, allowing students
to interact with others in the city.
"I am amazed at how many peo
ple speak English, and the amount of
abroad students here is unbeliev
able," said Santiago Seira 'l5, who

had taken a quarter of Italian before
arriving. "Also, speaking Spanish can
get you by in any situation as long as
you're able to laugh off some made
up words."
Back at Stanford, there have
been repercussions from this change
in Florence with the Italian language
department seeing a decline in en
rollment in first-year Italian.
Italian language coordinator and
lecturer Anna Cellinese said that the
number of students enrolled in all
first year Italian courses ITAL
LANG 1, IA, 2, 2A, 3 dropped
from 98 in Autumn 2013 to 72 in
Winter 2014.
"In any case, the difference may
be insignificant, but in a small pro
gram like ours, this is a number that
makes the difference, and we feel it,"
Cellinese said. "I believe it is due to
the Florence program change since
our numbers have always been sta
ble throughout the academic year."
Cellinese hopes that BOSP Flo
rence will be a starting point for fu
ture studies for the new students of
the Italian language.
"I consider the Italian program a
little bit like a boutique," Cellinese
said. "Students who chose to study
Italian are genuinely interested in its
culture, history and especially arts."
