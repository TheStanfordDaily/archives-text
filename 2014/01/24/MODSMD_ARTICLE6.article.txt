# Moscow switches quarters
## New spring quarter offering allows students to stay abroad longer 
### VANESSA OCHAVILLO 
The Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram (BOSP) in Moscow is moving its
study abroad program from fall quarter
to spring for the 2014-15 academic year,
due to rising demands from students
who wanted to stay in Russia longer than
the 10-week term.
Though the first year will be an ex
periment, BOSP expects the change to
be permanent. The new schedule will
give participants the option of extending
their stay into the summer, an increas
ingly popular option for students looking
to pursue internships abroad.
Besides the specialized program in
Australia, the Moscow center is the last
of BOSP's 11 quarter-long programs
around the world that currently does not
offer a spring quarter option.
"We found not just in Moscow,
but in other places around the world
[one quarter] is just too limited a time,"
said Ramon Saldlvar, director of BOSP He
added that winter break is not enough
time for students in Russia to continue
their studies and immersion.
Though BOSP in recent years has
pushed for more internship opportunities
for its students in Moscow, the quarter
shift signals the program's move towards
formally incorporating more forms of "ex
periential and community-engaged learn
ing" at its only eastern European site.
Several other BOSP centers already offer
formal internships and other immersion
programs.
Saldivar said that it will take a few
years before the Moscow program starts
receiving the same support that more es
tablished programs, like Kyoto and Berlin,
receive. In those locations, students are
eligible for prearranged internships,
many of which are paid for through fund
ing from endowments and alumni sup
port.
While Moscow has a designated staff
member to manage internships, past par
ticipants said limited networking connec
tions sometimes left students to make
their own arrangements.
Alexandra Cox 'l4, who studied in
Moscow during the fall of her junior year,
became aware of this shortcoming at the
Moscow site when an anticipated intern
ship fell through.
"I wish I had pushed more before
starting the program, because my under
standing going into it was that [BOSP's

Moscow office] would set up the intern
ship for you," she said. "But I guess they
didn't."
For Kyle Dumovic 'l4, who was in
Moscow for the same quarter as Cox, 10
weeks was sufficient time to find and
hold short-term internships at two tech
companies. However, he said that the
quarter change from fall to spring is more
ideal for longer-term internships.
In the past, students have worked
around the inconvenient timing by either
returning to Moscow after completing
the winter and spring quarters at the
main California campus, or not returning
until much later. Some students, like
Kevin Rouff 'l5, take a leave of absence
to participate in other non-Stanford pro
grams in Russia.
In Dumovic's case, after returning to
Palo Alto for the remainder of the aca
demic year, he traveled back to Russia
with a grant to study foreign languages.
"If I had applied for that [grant] while
I was abroad there in the spring, then I
wouldn't have even had to go home," he
explained. "I could have just bought a
plane ticket to where I was studying."
Even for students who aren't con
cerned about summer internships, study
ing in the spring puts them in prime po
sition to travel around Russia and Europe
in the summer, another appealing alter
native.
Miguel Boluda 'l4 was a sophomore
when he studied in Moscow in 2011.
Though he said he would have seriously
considered it, he added that he didn't
know if he would have been ready at the
time to remain abroad for the summer.
Yet, one quarter in Moscow shaped
the rest of his undergraduate career.

"I knew I needed to go abroad early
because I knew it would be an impactful
presence in my life," Boluda said. He ulti
mately switched from a major in commu
nication to international relations.
He believes studying abroad earlier
could benefit more students. Currently
it's rare for students to study abroad in
the fall of their sophomore year since
they have to decide to apply as freshmen.
But under the new schedule for Moscow,
sophomores would have more time to
consider studying abroad before applica
tions close.
