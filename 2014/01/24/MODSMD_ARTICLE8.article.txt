## Op-Ed The 						Loss of Cooper Union: The Fight for the Soul of Education 
### â€“ Sam Girvin '16 
Working until the sun rises has away of making you
question your life choices. At 6:30 a.m., thoughts
like, "Why am I doing this?" "What am I getting
out of this?" and "I sure hope this is worth it" bubble to
the surface. Though I, like many people at Stanford, re
ceive a generous financial aid package, college is expen
sive. It is tempting to try to calculate how much money
every hour of lecture costs and it is all too easy to jus
tify that cost as the price of admission to a high-paying job.
But that line of thinking is gravely mistaken. Not only
is it stress inducing and myopic, it also obscures the very
purpose of the American university system.
Though it has roots in the great European university
tradition, our system of higher education has a distinctly
American flavor and is replicated nowhere else in the
world. It is predicated on the belief that an education
the betterment and widening of one's mind in all direc
tions should simultaneously improve one's own life
and make the world a better place to live in.
The theory behind the American ideal is that if people
are encouraged to find, explore and tackle the problems
they are interested in, they will be both more personally
fulfilled and more successful at solving the varied prob
lems they will inevitably encounter. That stands in stark
contrast to institutions like Oxford and Cambridge, where
the norm is for students to choose a subject prior to ma
triculation and then focus almost exclusively on that sub
ject for the rest of their academic career.
The belief that an exploratory education can and
should directly improve society is embedded in Stanford's
Founding Grant. Among other things, the Founding Grant
states that the purpose of the university is to "qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and direct usefulness in life,"
and in doing so, "promote the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization."
Stanford, of course, is hardly the only institute of
higher education to hold these admirable goals. Take, for

instance, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Sci
ence and Art. Founded by engineer, inventor and business
man Peter Cooper, Cooper Union is a small institution
home to less than a thousand undergraduates in Man
hattan with schools of engineering, art, and architecture.
The story of Cooper Union closely parallels the story
of Stanford. Both universities were founded in the latter
half of the 19th century and endowed with money earned
in the railroad business. Both colleges feature well-regard
ed engineering schools. Both colleges have always been
open to women. Of course, both colleges aim to improve
the world through the education of their students. And, at
the time of their founding, both colleges were free.
Stanford began charging tuition in 1919 in order to
raise faculty salaries and grow the school. Since its found
ing in 1858, Cooper Union has never charged tuition:
every student admitted into Cooper Union has received a
full-tuition scholarship.
What does this difference look like? Both of my par
ents attended Cooper Union, and without full-tuition
scholarships, it is highly unlikely that my parents would be
in the places they are today. Free meant that my mother
could afford to stay in the United States on a student visa
and not have to return to her native Philippines. Free en
sured that my father became an architect and not a New
York City harbor pilot.
Free is a mark of faith in the power of education to
empower people to improve the world. It loudly proclaims
a belief that the value of learning transcends cost. Free is
more than a discount. What better way to signify the
pricelessness of an experience than by removing the
price?
Two Fridays ago, the board of trustees of Cooper
Union voted to begin charging tuition in order to fill a
budget gap caused by gross financial mismanagement and
the economic crisis of 2008. Instead of staying true to the
school's vision, the Cooper Union leadership decided to
sell off assets and then spent $ 150 million on a new build
ing. This all occurred without any notice to students or
alumni.
This makes me angry. Cooper Union could easily have
been my home. I find the idea of education as something
freely given intoxicating. I could easily have been one of the
students occupying the president's office at Cooper Union
last year. But I sit here on the opposite side of the country,
unable to do anything but express my outrage.
This is in part a lamentation of the end of an era in
higher education in America, but it is also a reminder to my
fellow students to properly value their college experience.
This country doesn't need fewer Cooper Unions. It
needs more of them.
For further reading, the author recommends John Hen
ry Newman's "The Idea of a University" and Kevin
Slavin's article, "Free is not for Nothing: The Vote to
Save Cooper Union."

alumni.
This makes me angry. Cooper Union could easily have
been my home. I find the idea of education as something
freely given intoxicating. I could easily have been one of the
students occupying the president's office at Cooper Union
last year. But I sit here on the opposite side of the country,
unable to do anything but express my outrage.
This is in part a lamentation of the end of an era in
higher education in America, but it is also a reminder to my
fellow students to properly value their college experience.
This country doesn't need fewer Cooper Unions. It
needs more of them.

Working until the sun rises has away of making you
question your life choices. At 6:30 a.m., thoughts
like, "Why am I doing this?" "What am I getting
out of this?" and "I sure hope this is worth it" bubble to
the surface. Though I, like many people at Stanford, re
ceive a generous financial aid package, college is expen
sive. It is tempting to try to calculate how much money
every hour of lecture costs and it is all too easy to jus
tify that cost as the price of admission to a high-paying job.
But that line of thinking is gravely mistaken. Not only
is it stress inducing and myopic, it also obscures the very
purpose of the American university system.
Though it has roots in the great European university
tradition, our system of higher education has a distinctly
American flavor and is replicated nowhere else in the
world. It is predicated on the belief that an education
the betterment and widening of one's mind in all direc
tions should simultaneously improve one's own life
and make the world a better place to live in.
The theory behind the American ideal is that if people
are encouraged to find, explore and tackle the problems
they are interested in, they will be both more personally
fulfilled and more successful at solving the varied prob
lems they will inevitably encounter. That stands in stark
contrast to institutions like Oxford and Cambridge, where
the norm is for students to choose a subject prior to ma
triculation and then focus almost exclusively on that sub
ject for the rest of their academic career.
The belief that an exploratory education can and
should directly improve society is embedded in Stanford's
Founding Grant. Among other things, the Founding Grant
states that the purpose of the university is to "qualify its stu
dents for personal success, and direct usefulness in life,"
and in doing so, "promote the public welfare by exercising
an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization."
Stanford, of course, is hardly the only institute of
higher education to hold these admirable goals. Take, for

instance, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Sci
ence and Art. Founded by engineer, inventor and business
man Peter Cooper, Cooper Union is a small institution
home to less than a thousand undergraduates in Man
hattan with schools of engineering, art, and architecture.
The story of Cooper Union closely parallels the story
of Stanford. Both universities were founded in the latter
half of the 19th century and endowed with money earned
in the railroad business. Both colleges feature well-regard
ed engineering schools. Both colleges have always been
open to women. Of course, both colleges aim to improve
the world through the education of their students. And, at
the time of their founding, both colleges were free.
Stanford began charging tuition in 1919 in order to
raise faculty salaries and grow the school. Since its found
ing in 1858, Cooper Union has never charged tuition:
every student admitted into Cooper Union has received a
full-tuition scholarship.
What does this difference look like? Both of my par
ents attended Cooper Union, and without full-tuition
scholarships, it is highly unlikely that my parents would be
in the places they are today. Free meant that my mother
could afford to stay in the United States on a student visa
and not have to return to her native Philippines. Free en
sured that my father became an architect and not a New
York City harbor pilot.
Free is a mark of faith in the power of education to
empower people to improve the world. It loudly proclaims
a belief that the value of learning transcends cost. Free is
more than a discount. What better way to signify the
pricelessness of an experience than by removing the
price?
Two Fridays ago, the board of trustees of Cooper
Union voted to begin charging tuition in order to fill a
budget gap caused by gross financial mismanagement and
the economic crisis of 2008. Instead of staying true to the
school's vision, the Cooper Union leadership decided to
sell off assets and then spent $ 150 million on a new build
ing. This all occurred without any notice to students or
alumni.
This makes me angry. Cooper Union could easily have
been my home. I find the idea of education as something
freely given intoxicating. I could easily have been one of the
students occupying the president's office at Cooper Union
last year. But I sit here on the opposite side of the country,
unable to do anything but express my outrage.
This is in part a lamentation of the end of an era in
higher education in America, but it is also a reminder to my
fellow students to properly value their college experience.
This country doesn't need fewer Cooper Unions. It
needs more of them.
