# STREAK SNAPPED
## STANFORD TORCHED BY TURNOVERS AT UCLA 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Call it a night of missed op
portunities. The Stanford men's
basketball team struggled from
the outset in its matchup
against UCLA (15-4, 4-2Pac-12)
on Thursday, falling to the Bru
ins 91-74 in a disappointing per
formance that snapped a three
game conference win streak. It
marked Stanford's 16th loss in
its last 17 games in Los Angeles
against either UCLA or USC.

Plagued by turnovers and
missed open looks, the Cardinal
(12-6, 3-3) did not bring its A
game when it needed it most.
Stanford shot just 38.6 percent
from the field and failed to pro
tect the ball against the Pac-12
steals leader, turning it over a
season-high 19 times in the
loss. It was Stanford's highest
turnover night since a 22-
turnover game against Denver
on Dec. 2 last season.

Despite the issues across
the board, the Cardinal re
mained competitive for a large
portion of the first half, even
holding a 20-17 lead nine min
utes into the game. That lead
would quickly erode and then
transform into a deficit shortly
thereafter, as a 1 -for-6 shooting
stretch in combination with
four turnovers saw a three
point lead become an eight
point deficit in a span of five
minutes. From that point for
ward, the Cardinal would nev
er again draw closer than five.
UCLA led by double figures for
the entirety of the second half.

In defeat, senior forward
Dwight Powell registered 17
points and 13 rebounds for the
Cardinal, although he was also
responsible for six of the
team's turnovers. Fellow sen
ior forward Josh Huestis also
tallied a double-double with 12
points and 12 rebounds, but he
shot just 3-of-10 from the
floor. His shooting perform

ance, while poor, was not the
worst a member of the Cardi
nal suffered on this night.
Junior guard Chasson Ran
dle, who has spent most of the
season as a deadly efficient
scoring machine, finished just
3-of-16 from the floor, easily
his worst shooting perform
ance of the season.
UCLA was boosted by a ca

reer-high performance by
sophomore big man Tony Park
er, who dominated the interior
to the tune of 22 points on 9-
of-14 shooting in just 28 min
utes. Guard Jordan Adams
chipped in with 19 points,
while forward Kyle Anderson
continued to put up gaudy all
around numbers, finishing the
evening with 13 points, 10 as
sists, seven rebounds and two
steals.

The keys to the game for
Stanford were fairly clear-cut
from the start: take care of the
ball, and in the process, limit
UCLA's explosive offense.
Stanford failed to do just that,
and, as a result, the Bruins
were able to shoot 52.3 per
cent from the floor, an efficien
cy that effectively helped shoot
the Cardinal out of Pauley
Pavilion. UCLA surpassed its
season average of 84.4 points
per game with 91 and steals
per-game average of 10.7 with
15.

The loss meant that Stan
ford failed to extend its confer
ence winning streak to four,
which would have marked the
first time the Cardinal had at
tained a streak of that length
since February 2008. As a re
sult, Stanford will be forced to
begin anew when it takes on
USC this Sunday, in anticipa
tion of the Cardinal's home
matchup with top-ranked Ari
zona next week.
Stanford will seek to exor
cise some of its Los Angeles
demons at the Galen Center
against the Pac-12 cellar-dwelling
Trojans, who found new life in
Wednesday's upset of Cal. Sun
day's tip-off is at 2 p.m.

(12-6, 3-3) did not bring its A
game when it needed it most.
Stanford shot just 38.6 percent
from the field and failed to pro
tect the ball against the Pac-12
steals leader, turning it over a
season-high 19 times in the
loss. It was Stanford's highest
turnover night since a 22-
turnover game against Denver
on Dec. 2 last season.

Despite the issues across
the board, the Cardinal re
mained competitive for a large
portion of the first half, even
holding a 20-17 lead nine min
utes into the game. That lead
would quickly erode and then
transform into a deficit shortly
thereafter, as a 1 -for-6 shooting
stretch in combination with
four turnovers saw a three
point lead become an eight
point deficit in a span of five
minutes. From that point for
ward, the Cardinal would nev
er again draw closer than five.
UCLA led by double figures for
the entirety of the second half.

In defeat, senior forward
Dwight Powell registered 17
points and 13 rebounds for the
Cardinal, although he was also
responsible for six of the
team's turnovers. Fellow sen
ior forward Josh Huestis also
tallied a double-double with 12
points and 12 rebounds, but he
shot just 3-of-10 from the
floor. His shooting perform

ance, while poor, was not the
worst a member of the Cardi
nal suffered on this night.
Junior guard Chasson Ran
dle, who has spent most of the
season as a deadly efficient
scoring machine, finished just
3-of-16 from the floor, easily
his worst shooting perform
ance of the season.
UCLA was boosted by a ca

reer-high performance by
sophomore big man Tony Park
er, who dominated the interior
to the tune of 22 points on 9-
of-14 shooting in just 28 min
utes. Guard Jordan Adams
chipped in with 19 points,
while forward Kyle Anderson
continued to put up gaudy all
around numbers, finishing the
evening with 13 points, 10 as
sists, seven rebounds and two
steals.

The keys to the game for
Stanford were fairly clear-cut
from the start: take care of the
ball, and in the process, limit
UCLA's explosive offense.
Stanford failed to do just that,
and, as a result, the Bruins
were able to shoot 52.3 per
cent from the floor, an efficien
cy that effectively helped shoot
the Cardinal out of Pauley
Pavilion. UCLA surpassed its
season average of 84.4 points
per game with 91 and steals
per-game average of 10.7 with
15.

The loss meant that Stan
ford failed to extend its confer
ence winning streak to four,
which would have marked the
first time the Cardinal had at
tained a streak of that length
since February 2008. As a re
sult, Stanford will be forced to
begin anew when it takes on
USC this Sunday, in anticipa
tion of the Cardinal's home
matchup with top-ranked Ari
zona next week.
Stanford will seek to exor
cise some of its Los Angeles
demons at the Galen Center
against the Pac-12 cellar-dwelling
Trojans, who found new life in
Wednesday's upset of Cal. Sun
day's tip-off is at 2 p.m.

Senior forward Josh Huestis (above) was one of two Cardinal
players with double-doubles, but turnover issues doomed Stanford
in a 91-74 loss that snapped its three-game Pac-12 winning streak.
