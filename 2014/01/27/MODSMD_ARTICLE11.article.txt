# Ranking the difficulty of title runs

### Viggy Venkataraman 
This article was supposed
to be, at worst, half joyful
and half morose. After
all, with yours truly hold
ing a vested rooting in
terest in two of the four teams left in
the NFL playoffs, it would seem rea
sonable to hope that at least one of
my teams would advance to the Su
per Bowl.
Alas, it was not meant to be, and
my psyche has yet to recover from
the demoralizing events of Jan. 19,
2014, a day that will long be remem
bered in the Venkataraman house
hold as Footballgeddon.
It is an irrefutable truth that win
ning a championship in any sport re
quires a great deal of skill but also an
equal amount of luck. Whether that
luck be in the form of a team that im
plodes, a random bounce of the ball,
a relative lack of injuries or a terrible
foul call, the point is that the "best"
team, either on paper or by punditry,
is quite often not the team that goes
home with rings and Champagne.
This got me thinking, because we
never stop to think exactly how hard
it is to win a championship in each
sport. Are there some sports that
are inherently tougher to triumph
in? As this column has only just
crossed 200 words, you know the an
swer is going to be "yes." Without
further rigmarole, here is my (defi
nitely imperfect) list of relative
championship-winning difficulties in
major professional sports leagues,
ranked by the relative difficulty for
the most talented team (on paper) to
triumph.
4. Winning the World Series: This
was the easiest call to make: In
baseball, the best team almost al
ways heads home as champions.
The points for baseball being diffi
cult include a grueling 162-game
regular season and a severely
skewed talent distribution, cen
tered around major television
markets; however, the sport has a
relatively smaller injury risk when
compared to the rest of this list, a
plethora of ways to reach the play
offs and five- or seven-game post
season elimination formats that
quench the upset potential that a
smaller sample size would grant.
On the whole, there are fewer con
founding variables in baseball, and
as such, if you have a strong team,
you have a very fair and decent
chance of emerging as champions.
3. Winning an NBA title: The
NBA is the second-easiest league
to emerge from as a champion if
you are the most talented team on
paper. First off, there are only five
players on the floor at a time,
meaning the presence of a single
superstar is far more dramatic
than other sports, where there are
more active players on the floor at
one time. Want proof? The only
team in the last 34 years to win
without a guaranteed Hall of
Famer on its roster was the 2004
Pistons, and their victory ranks as
one of the greatest upsets in NBA
history.
Additionally, the luxury tax
rules include a soft cap, which al
lows teams to spend with (admit
tedly severe) penalties, which has
the added result of again concen
trating talent among big spending
teams; the parity in the league is
thusly diluted. If you are in the
Eastern Conference, your path to
a championship gets paved in gold
en bricks; this year, 12 of the 15
teams in the conference are cur
rently at or below .500.
2. Winning the Super Bowl: Foot
ball is easily the most directly vio
lent sport of the four we are con
sidering; the scope and magnitude
of injuries players suffer leave
teams often in shambles by the
end of the sporting year.
There is also a startling amount
of parity in football; the phrase
"any given Sunday," after all, does
draw its origins from the typical
Sunday football experience. At
tracting and keeping talented free
agents is difficult, as is finding tal
ent in the draft. But the biggest
struggle is the single-elimination
postseason format; all it takes is
five minutes of poor play, and you
can find yourself out of the play
offs. It is rarely sufficient to be tal
ented enough to win the Super
Bowl; you also have to peak at the
perfect time and get hot through
the playoffs. In football, the hottest
(and least injured) team wins.
