## Gage key to Card's overtime win at USC 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
Going on the road in conference
play can at times be about the art of
survival. For the Stanford men's
basketball team, survival was the
sole objective on Sunday afternoon,
and the Cardinal eventually passed
the test, albeit narrowly.
Stanford (13-6,4-3 Pac-12) even
tually overcame the USC Trojans
(10-10, 1-6) 79-71 in overtime, cap
ping an ugly contest that certainly
did not see the Cardinal play its
best basketball. That said, head
coach Johnny Dawkins and compa
ny certainly will take it: The win
was just Stanford's second victory
in its last 18 tries against the likes
of USC and UCLA in Los Angeles
and was badly needed on the heels
of a 17-point defeat to UCLA on
Thursday.

Senior forward John Gage's 12
points off the bench, all of which
came in the second half and over
time, keyed the Stanford victory. It
matched a season high for Gage,
who also chipped in four rebounds
and a career-high four steals. Not
typically known for his defensive
prowess, Gage made several strong
defensive plays throughout the
course of the second half, even while
guarding a much bigger player in
USC's Omar Oraby, which greatly
contributed to the Cardinal victory.
Junior guard Chasson Randle,
who suffered through his worst per
formance of the season on Thurs
day against UCLA, bounced back
late against the Trojans, scoring
seven of his team-high 17 points in
overtime to help seal the win for
Stanford.
Randle, Gage and senior guard
Anthony Brown were the primary
contributors to the Cardinal's over
time success. After a costly
turnover with 30 seconds left in reg
ulation that allowed USC's Byron
Wesley to hit two free throws to tie
the game with 22 seconds remain
ing, Brown played an extremely sol
id overtime period, scoring five
points and assisting on a Gage 3-
pointer.
Wesley finished with 18 points in
the defeat for the Trojans, while
forward Strahinja Gavrilovic tallied
a career-high 12 points off the

bench to help keep USC close.
For Stanford, the game started
innocuously enough. The Cardinal
jumped out to an early 12-4 lead five
minutes into the game before en
during a long cold stretch with Ran
dle on the bench with two fouls that
allowed USC back into the contest.
USC took its first lead of the game

at 17-16 on a Pe'Shon Howard
three-point play, and the teams
would trade baskets for the rest of
the half until a technical foul on
Howard allowed Randle to shoot
four straight free throws. The Car
dinal would enter halftime leading

Senior forward John Gage (right) played a crucial role in the Cardinal's
79-71 overtime win at the Galen Center Sunday afternoon. Gage
netted 12 points, including a critical 3-pointer in the overtime period.
32-28.
USC began the second
half as the hungrier team,
quickly snatching the lead
from Stanford and maintain
ing it until a pair of free
throws and a 3-pointer by
Gage gave the Cardinal a
three-point lead seven min
utes into the half. Stanford
would grow its lead to 58-51
with 3:54 remaining but failed
to execute down the stretch,
in the process allowing the
Trojans to hang around. Five
Stanford turnovers over the
final 5:29 of regulation proved
costly, the most expensive of
those being Brown's mistake
with 30 seconds to play that
gave Wesley free throws to tie
the game.

As if it was finally tired of
letting USC hang around,
Stanford seized control of
overtime from the outset,
thanks in large part to the
efforts of Randle, Brown
and Gage. Gage's 3-pointer
with 2:53 left to play gave
Stanford a commanding
six-point advantage, and
the Trojans would never
again draw within one pos
session.
Senior forwards Josh
Huestis and Dwight Powell
were again solid for Stan
ford, tallying a combined 30
points on 11-of-23 shooting.
The Cardinal will now
turn its attention to No. 1
Arizona, which visits Maples
Pavilion on Wednesday for
the marquee home game of
the season. Tip off is set for
6 p.m.

Going on the road in conference
play can at times be about the art of
survival. For the Stanford men's
basketball team, survival was the
sole objective on Sunday afternoon,
and the Cardinal eventually passed
the test, albeit narrowly.
Stanford (13-6,4-3 Pac-12) even
tually overcame the USC Trojans
(10-10, 1-6) 79-71 in overtime, cap
ping an ugly contest that certainly
did not see the Cardinal play its
best basketball. That said, head
coach Johnny Dawkins and compa
ny certainly will take it: The win
was just Stanford's second victory
in its last 18 tries against the likes
of USC and UCLA in Los Angeles
and was badly needed on the heels
of a 17-point defeat to UCLA on
Thursday.

Senior forward John Gage's 12
points off the bench, all of which
came in the second half and over
time, keyed the Stanford victory. It
matched a season high for Gage,
who also chipped in four rebounds
and a career-high four steals. Not
typically known for his defensive
prowess, Gage made several strong
defensive plays throughout the
course of the second half, even while
guarding a much bigger player in
USC's Omar Oraby, which greatly
contributed to the Cardinal victory.
Junior guard Chasson Randle,
who suffered through his worst per
formance of the season on Thurs
day against UCLA, bounced back
late against the Trojans, scoring
seven of his team-high 17 points in
overtime to help seal the win for
Stanford.
Randle, Gage and senior guard
Anthony Brown were the primary
contributors to the Cardinal's over
time success. After a costly
turnover with 30 seconds left in reg
ulation that allowed USC's Byron
Wesley to hit two free throws to tie
the game with 22 seconds remain
ing, Brown played an extremely sol
id overtime period, scoring five
points and assisting on a Gage 3-
pointer.
Wesley finished with 18 points in
the defeat for the Trojans, while
forward Strahinja Gavrilovic tallied
a career-high 12 points off the

bench to help keep USC close.
For Stanford, the game started
innocuously enough. The Cardinal
jumped out to an early 12-4 lead five
minutes into the game before en
during a long cold stretch with Ran
dle on the bench with two fouls that
allowed USC back into the contest.
USC took its first lead of the game

at 17-16 on a Pe'Shon Howard
three-point play, and the teams
would trade baskets for the rest of
the half until a technical foul on
Howard allowed Randle to shoot
four straight free throws. The Car
dinal would enter halftime leading

Senior forward John Gage (right) played a crucial role in the Cardinal's
79-71 overtime win at the Galen Center Sunday afternoon. Gage
netted 12 points, including a critical 3-pointer in the overtime period.
32-28.
USC began the second
half as the hungrier team,
quickly snatching the lead
from Stanford and maintain
ing it until a pair of free
throws and a 3-pointer by
Gage gave the Cardinal a
three-point lead seven min
utes into the half. Stanford
would grow its lead to 58-51
with 3:54 remaining but failed
to execute down the stretch,
in the process allowing the
Trojans to hang around. Five
Stanford turnovers over the
final 5:29 of regulation proved
costly, the most expensive of
those being Brown's mistake
with 30 seconds to play that
gave Wesley free throws to tie
the game.
