# STANFORD IN THE NFL
## LUCK STARS IN PRO BOWL All eyes now set on Super Bowl 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Regardless of this Sun
day's outcome, a former Car
dinal football player will be
come a Super Bowl champion.
The Seattle Seahawks'
Richard Sherman 'lO and
Doug Baldwin 'll and the
Denver Broncos' Sione Ria
'll spent this past week
preparing to take the field
Sunday in the biggest game of
their football careers that will
see one team crowned as
champions of the NFL.
Ria and the Broncos enter
media week, the week before
the Super Bowl, as 2.5-point
favorites over the Seahawks.
The Broncos earned their Su
per Bowl spot with a 26-16
over the New England Patri
ots in the AFC championship
game. Former Cardinal quar
terback John Elway 'B3, cur
rently executive vice president
of football operations for the
Broncos, also hopes to earn his
first Super Bowl victory as an
executive after winning two in
his final two year's as quarter
back of the Broncos.
The Seahawks advanced
to the Super Bowl with a dra
matic 23-17 victory over for
mer Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh and the San Fran
cisco 49ers. After the social
media firestorm that accom
panied cornerback Richard
Sherman 'lO and his well-pub
licized postgame interview,
Sherman will receive plenty
of attention for the Seahawks
during media week. While
wide receiver Doug Baldwin
'll may be in less of a media
spotlight, the Broncos will
surely consider him in then
game plan after he led all
players with 106 receiving
yards and had a 69-yard kick
off return in the NFC cham
pionship game.
Many members of the me-
dia, fans and players around the nation
spoke out in support of Sherman after
the onslaught of criticism Sherman re
ceived on Twitter directly after his
postgame interview, when some even
called him a "thug." Those jumping to
Sherman's defense included baseball
legend Hank Aaron, Miami Heat for
ward Le√üron James and Saints head
coach Sean Payton.
Sherman did receive a $7,875 fine for
his taunting after making the game-sav
ing play. Sherman made a choking mo
tion toward the 49ers bench and quar
terback Colin Kaepernick that brought
about a 15-yard unsportsmanlike con
duct penalty and the fine.
The NFL also released the sounds
from the end of the NFC championship
game in which Richard Sherman was
equipped with a microphone.

While Andrew Luck 'l2 surely wish
es he could be taking the field for the Su
per Bowl, he did play for one final time
in this season's Pro Bowl.
Drafted first overall on the second
day of the Pro Bowl draft in an eye
catching hat, Luck played for Team
Sanders and completed five of his seven
attempts for 80 passing yards, one
touchdown and one interception in a 22-
21 defeat.
Luck's touchdown pass came on a 36-
yard flea flicker in which Luck connect
ed with Cal alumnus and Philadelphia
Eagles wide receiver Desean Jackson.
Jackson was covered by two defenders,
but Luck found him anyway for the
touchdown in the first quarter.
Luck played in the Pro Bowl for his
second straight season and would have
been joined by fellow Cardinal alumnus
Sherman if not for the Seahawks' Super
Bowl berth.

Andrew Luck '12 (above) started the Pro Bowl game for Team Sanders Sunday,
scoring the game's first points off of a perfectly executed flea flicker. The former
No. 1 overall pick also threw an interception in his squad's 22-21 defeat.
