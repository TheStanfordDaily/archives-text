# BRUIN BRUISERS
## SUPPORTING CAST STARS IN VICTORY 
### LAUREN LOCKETT 
Fueled by a second-half run, the
Stanford women's basketball squad
fended off one of its peskier opponents
to defeat the UCLA Bruins by a score of
72-55 Friday night.

The Cardinal (18-1, 7-0 Pac 12)
notched another conference victory
against UCLA (10-10, 4-4). In the first
half, however, the Cardinal wasn't as
dominant as it had been in much of the
early part of the season. Its one-point
lead at halftime was its slimmest margin
at the break this season.
UCLA came into the matchup with a
plan to use its physicality and length to
get Stanford's offense out of sync and
force someone other than Stanford's All-
American forward Chiney Ogwumike to
beat them.
"They were physical," Ogwumike
said, "and it took me a little bit to adjust
to it."
By playing tough, aggressive defen
sive on Ogwumike early on in the game,
the Bruins were able to disrupt her of
fensive rhythm for much of the first 20
minutes. Ogwumike, second in the na
tion in field goal percentage, missed five
of her first six field goal attempts to be
gin the game. In spite of the tough start,
she worked her way to a hard-earned 21

points and 15 rebounds.
"There are a lot of things to be proud
of," UCLA head coach Cori Close said
after the game. "We played with good
energy for a long time. I've never been
so thrilled to hold anyone to 21 points."
Following a recent trend, however,
Ogwumike's teammates stepped up to
play major roles. Freshman guard Lili
Thompson recorded 15 points in the
game, notching her third consecutive
double-figure scoring effort and seventh
this year, while fellow freshman Erica
McCall contributed 12 points and senior
Sara James scored 11.
Though the Cardinal prevailed, the
Bruins did not go down without a fight.
With just over nine minutes to play, they
were still within six points. But in the fi
nal stages of the game, the intensity of
UCLA who dressed only eight
healthy players for the game seemed
to wane. Junior guard Amber Orrange
and Ogwumike made jumpers to push
the Cardinal lead to an insurmountable
66-51 lead with just under five minutes
remaining.
"UCLA is extremely aggressive,"
said head coach Tara VanDerveer, "but I
thought our team came out in the second
half and got it going. We attacked a lot
better and were more aggressive."
Foul trouble was also an issue for the
depleted Bruins roster. Physical defense
against Ogwumike down low caused the
referees to blow their whistles, and
UCLA was forced to constantly rotate
its few forwards to keep them from foul
ing out.
Star forward Atonye Nyingifa posted
18 points to lead the Bruins in scoring,
and guard Nirra Fields scored 13 in the
effort for UCLA. For Stanford, Orrange
