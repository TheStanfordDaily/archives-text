## OP-ED Land of Plenty, Land of Poverty 
### 
We often think of the United
States as the land of plenty,
but in fact it's also the land
of poverty. In its first annual re
port, the Stanford Center on Pover
ty and Inequality described a
"broadly deteriorating poverty and
inequality landscape," with the
overall U.S. poverty rate as high as
15 percent and a child poverty rate
as high as 21.8 percent.
Why is there so much poverty in
the land of plenty? There are two
main reasons: The economy isn't
delivering the jobs we need, and
workers aren't receiving the educa
tion they need.
Although it's now six years after
the start of the Great Recession,
the proportion of 25-54 year olds
who are working is still 5 percent
lower than it was before the reces
sion. For males without high school
degrees, more than 1 in 4 in the
prime working age (i.e., 25-54 years
old) are not working, a jobless rate
far higher than what prevailed be
fore the Great Recession.
These two causes a jobs disas
ter and a labor market disaster
are pretty much the full poverty sto
ry. We should outlaw the platitude
that poverty is just too complicated
to figure out and that our only hope
is to find some magic bullet that will
cure it. The "disease model" of
poverty, which treats it like some
rare and incurable form of cancer, is
an immensely destructive rhetoric
on poverty. It's destructive because
it wrongly suggests that we don't
know what causes poverty and that
we don't know how to end it.
The claim that poverty is im
mutable is typically trumped up
with official poverty data showing
that, while the amount of poverty
has fluctuated up and down as re
cessions come and go, there hasn't
been any long-term decline over
the last four decades in the under
lying rate.
This intransigence is sometimes
taken as evidence that our govern
ment and nongovernment pro
grams to assist the poor simply
aren't working. If these pro
grams were really working, so
it's argued, shouldn't the poverty
rate he declining ?
This line of argument is disin
genuous: The fact of the matter is
that our safety net, in both its gov
ernment and nongovernment
forms, is delivering real relief. The
Center on Poverty and Inequality
has recently released a new meas
ure of poverty in California that al
lows us to document the safety
net's work. If we imagined a Cali
fornia without food stamps (i.e.,
CalFresh), tax credits (e.g., EITC),
or a cash assistance program (i.e.,
CaIWORKs), child poverty would
be approximately 12 percentage
points higher raising it from 25
to nearly 37 percent of all chil
dren. That's real and meaningful
anti-poverty work.
This result is obscured by con
ventional poverty indices, like the
official poverty measure, that do
not take noncash benefits into ac
count. If a measure of poverty
doesn't factor in the anti-poverty
work of government programs,
then it will perforce create the im
pression that government pro
grams do no anti-poverty work.
The California Poverty Measure,
by contrast, factors in the effects of
noncash benefits and thus allows us
to calculate the effects of those ben
efits in reducing poverty.

What is, then, to be done? In the
short run, it's just more of the
same: We have no choice but to
maintain and strengthen the safety
net. Unless and until a decision is
made to take on poverty at its
source, we have to continue to sup
port those who can't get jobs or
can't get the type of jobs that keep
them out of poverty. This program
matic work, undertaken by the qui
et heroes of our country, is all-im
portant.
But our commitment to reduc
ing poverty ought not to stop there.
As we mark the 50th anniversary of
the War on Poverty, the national de
bate has focused relentlessly on the
legitimacy of safety net benefits, a
debate that has distracted us from
asking whether the country should
fix the economic and labor market
institutions that cause poverty and
lead to a need for the safety net in
the first place.
How might a no-holds-barred
attack on poverty look? The first
step is to solve the employment
problem. There are many ways to
do so: We could provide guaranteed
government jobs of last resort; we
could ramp up demand for existing
products via another round of stim
ulus; or we could incentivize job
creation in the private sector. It
doesn't matter how we do it or
which political party proposes it. It
just matters that we get the job
done. There's of course no free
lunch: Although all approaches to
solving the employment program
have downsides, the key question is
whether those downsides come
close to the costs of continuing to
run a high-poverty country. It is
unimaginable that they do.
The second step is to solve the
labor market problem by eliminat
ing the mismatch between the skills
offered by workers and the skills
demanded by employers. Because
there are far more poorly educated
workers than there are jobs for
them, such workers experience dis
proportionate unemployment, un
deremployment and poverty.
We can reduce the size of this
reserve army of undereducated
workers by providing quality pre
school, primary school and second
ary school experiences to poor chil
dren. If poor children had full and
equal access to the type of early
training that makes a quality col
lege education possible, we could
ramp up the college graduation
rate, lower the number of workers
chasing after low-skill jobs, and
raise their wages to boot. Although
everyone talks about school quality,
the school reform movement needs
to be refocused on school equality
in the most aggressive way possi
ble. We need to mean it. Here
again, we know what to do and how
to do it, but we're seemingly satis
fied with narrow-gauge reform that
doesn't get us close to realizing the
country's commitment to equality
of opportunity.
The simple upshot: The sources
of poverty are well-known, and the
reforms needed to eliminate it are
straightforward. If we nonetheless
decide against taking on poverty,
we can't any longer pretend that
it's because we don't know how.

ary school experiences to poor chil
dren. If poor children had full and
equal access to the type of early
training that makes a quality col
lege education possible, we could
ramp up the college graduation
rate, lower the number of workers
chasing after low-skill jobs, and
raise their wages to boot. Although
everyone talks about school quality,
the school reform movement needs
to be refocused on school equality
in the most aggressive way possi
ble. We need to mean it. Here
again, we know what to do and how
to do it, but we're seemingly satis
fied with narrow-gauge reform that
doesn't get us close to realizing the
country's commitment to equality
of opportunity.
The simple upshot: The sources
of poverty are well-known, and the
reforms needed to eliminate it are
straightforward. If we nonetheless
decide against taking on poverty,
we can't any longer pretend that
it's because we don't know how.

We often think of the United
States as the land of plenty,
but in fact it's also the land
of poverty. In its first annual re
port, the Stanford Center on Pover
ty and Inequality described a
"broadly deteriorating poverty and
inequality landscape," with the
overall U.S. poverty rate as high as
15 percent and a child poverty rate
as high as 21.8 percent.
Why is there so much poverty in
the land of plenty? There are two
main reasons: The economy isn't
delivering the jobs we need, and
workers aren't receiving the educa
tion they need.
Although it's now six years after
the start of the Great Recession,
the proportion of 25-54 year olds
who are working is still 5 percent
lower than it was before the reces
sion. For males without high school
degrees, more than 1 in 4 in the
prime working age (i.e., 25-54 years
old) are not working, a jobless rate
far higher than what prevailed be
fore the Great Recession.
These two causes a jobs disas
ter and a labor market disaster
are pretty much the full poverty sto
ry. We should outlaw the platitude
that poverty is just too complicated
to figure out and that our only hope
is to find some magic bullet that will
cure it. The "disease model" of
poverty, which treats it like some
rare and incurable form of cancer, is
an immensely destructive rhetoric
on poverty. It's destructive because
it wrongly suggests that we don't
know what causes poverty and that
we don't know how to end it.
The claim that poverty is im
mutable is typically trumped up
with official poverty data showing
that, while the amount of poverty
has fluctuated up and down as re
cessions come and go, there hasn't
been any long-term decline over
the last four decades in the under
lying rate.
This intransigence is sometimes
taken as evidence that our govern
ment and nongovernment pro
grams to assist the poor simply
aren't working. If these pro
grams were really working, so
it's argued, shouldn't the poverty
rate he declining ?
This line of argument is disin
genuous: The fact of the matter is
that our safety net, in both its gov
ernment and nongovernment
forms, is delivering real relief. The
Center on Poverty and Inequality
has recently released a new meas
ure of poverty in California that al
lows us to document the safety
net's work. If we imagined a Cali
fornia without food stamps (i.e.,
CalFresh), tax credits (e.g., EITC),
or a cash assistance program (i.e.,
CaIWORKs), child poverty would
be approximately 12 percentage
points higher raising it from 25
to nearly 37 percent of all chil
dren. That's real and meaningful
anti-poverty work.
This result is obscured by con
ventional poverty indices, like the
official poverty measure, that do
not take noncash benefits into ac
count. If a measure of poverty
doesn't factor in the anti-poverty
work of government programs,
then it will perforce create the im
pression that government pro
grams do no anti-poverty work.
The California Poverty Measure,
by contrast, factors in the effects of
noncash benefits and thus allows us
to calculate the effects of those ben
efits in reducing poverty.

What is, then, to be done? In the
short run, it's just more of the
same: We have no choice but to
maintain and strengthen the safety
net. Unless and until a decision is
made to take on poverty at its
source, we have to continue to sup
port those who can't get jobs or
can't get the type of jobs that keep
them out of poverty. This program
matic work, undertaken by the qui
et heroes of our country, is all-im
portant.
But our commitment to reduc
ing poverty ought not to stop there.
As we mark the 50th anniversary of
the War on Poverty, the national de
bate has focused relentlessly on the
legitimacy of safety net benefits, a
debate that has distracted us from
asking whether the country should
fix the economic and labor market
institutions that cause poverty and
lead to a need for the safety net in
the first place.
How might a no-holds-barred
attack on poverty look? The first
step is to solve the employment
problem. There are many ways to
do so: We could provide guaranteed
government jobs of last resort; we
could ramp up demand for existing
products via another round of stim
ulus; or we could incentivize job
creation in the private sector. It
doesn't matter how we do it or
which political party proposes it. It
just matters that we get the job
done. There's of course no free
lunch: Although all approaches to
solving the employment program
have downsides, the key question is
whether those downsides come
close to the costs of continuing to
run a high-poverty country. It is
unimaginable that they do.
The second step is to solve the
labor market problem by eliminat
ing the mismatch between the skills
offered by workers and the skills
demanded by employers. Because
there are far more poorly educated
workers than there are jobs for
them, such workers experience dis
proportionate unemployment, un
deremployment and poverty.
We can reduce the size of this
reserve army of undereducated
workers by providing quality pre
school, primary school and second
ary school experiences to poor chil
dren. If poor children had full and
equal access to the type of early
training that makes a quality col
lege education possible, we could
ramp up the college graduation
rate, lower the number of workers
chasing after low-skill jobs, and
raise their wages to boot. Although
