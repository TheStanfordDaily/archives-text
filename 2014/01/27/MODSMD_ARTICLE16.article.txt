## Cards against Humanity and the American (Wet) Dream 
### 
The night before flying back to
Stanford, I was with a few old
pals at a bar playing, for the
first time, Cards Against Humani
ty. A particularly vicious variant of
Apples to Apples, Cards Against
Humanity is a card game in which
players construct absurd and inten
tionally inappropriate phrases with
their drawn word cards. Every
round, the most inappropriate
phrase wins. I was surprised to find
myself laughing the game is
acutely tuned to our generation, its
pop culture and its humor.
There was one phrase in partic
ular that caught my eye and unani
mously won: "Q: What came out of
my butt?" and the answer, "The
American dream."
The next day aboard a long
flight, I did what all traveling peo
ple do: catch up on all the movies
you would never pay to see or nev
er even know existed, along with all
sorts of modern ideologies being
flushed out of Hollywood.
I never sleep well on those kind
of flights in fact, I am astonished
at my acquired ability to watch five
movies in a row which led to an
in-depth exploration of what exact
ly was this "American dream."
What made people think it was a
reality, and why is it today that we
now laugh at the American dream?
Is it our own dream anymore, or is
it merely an outdated ideal export
ed to outsiders wishing to move to
the XXL land of purple mountain
majesties, computer chips, Coca-
Cola, phone apps, etc?
I believe that at some point, fol
lowing the craze of the "Great Gats
by" era, the American dream took a
turn away from the frenzy on Wall
Street and a material lust that so
demanded headstrong ambition.
Flying at 35,000 feet, I saw how
Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn
symbolized the new dream. The
dream became more personal, tak
ing on the values of the "ideal" fam
ily and the "American way of life."
The American way of life devel
oped, and eventually this expanded
(civil rights, for instance) to repre
sent ideas, morals, and principles.
It would be nice to say we made
some progress as a whole, for these

priorities seem like a feasible and
noble aim. But somehow, we've
changed once more: We've tossed
that idealism aside in favor of
"Jobs" and "The Social Network,"
becoming once more the wolves of
Wall Street (though I have yet to
see that film). Sure, the characters
that populate these films may have
faults, but who really cares now,
considering that they embody man
achieving the impossible? The
means they employ are irrelevant
to us, we think: Like in your typical
Hollywood film, only what hap
pened in the end matters.
Outside America, as in the film
"American Dreams in China," the
acts we perform still take prece
dence in the dream. And yet here in
America and especially at Stanford,
this old ideal is not the reality: Liv
ing in a garage and losing your
friends is not indicative of a failed
(American) dream, but may be the
startup of the next big thing that
will take you there, to the podium
(of TED talks!).
And what else is "there"? Well,
the empty house of Steve Jobs, the
empty office of Cheng Dongqing,
the empty office of Mark Zucker
berg. The process of success, once

idealized in the American dream,
has been divorced from its goal: It
is empty, and has instead become
an amorphous idea of being a
somebody, a puree (this, I'll admit,
was originally a typo, but I like the
imagery) of potential.
We haven't moved very far, to
say the least.
In "Mythologies" Roland
Bai'thes points out the difference
between true pleasure, in which the
strip tease as a whole is euphoria it
self, and the schoolboy's pleasure,
in which the actual striptease is ir
relevant and only the final garmen
t's displacement matters.
This is precisely what we have
today. We are the schoolboys (or
girls) waiting for the last obstacle
to fall so we can become an embod
iment of what we want to resemble.
And we become less concerned
with the greatness of the future's
strip.
As a result, we find ourselves emp
ty-handed, defeated at the first slip.
This is why we laugh at the
American dream —it is now a
dead-end suburban street. Why
would you want, as they put it in
"21 & Over," "a big house, a big
family, a minivan, driving to work,"
when you could change the world
when you could be something
truly "great?"
The American dream has shriv
eled; we over-excited it into some
premature recoil. The backlash has
become the paradigm. There is no
longer the dream, but the fantasy.
It is one no longer reflective of
the popular image of Americana,
with its endless roads, different for
every individual. It is twisted and
distorted into the fantastical Cin
derella stories that are easily
shoved into Hollywood films and
watched on planes.
What do I make of this? Well,
nothing. But I wonder: What do
you wait for? If it's for the final
strip of the garment, you may as
well close your eyes until you're
there, but if on the other hand you
can love the entire bumpy dance,
then keep those eyes open wide.

is empty, and has instead become
an amorphous idea of being a
somebody, a puree (this, I'll admit,
was originally a typo, but I like the
imagery) of potential.
We haven't moved very far, to
say the least.
In "Mythologies" Roland
Bai'thes points out the difference
between true pleasure, in which the
strip tease as a whole is euphoria it
self, and the schoolboy's pleasure,
in which the actual striptease is ir
relevant and only the final garmen
t's displacement matters.
This is precisely what we have
today. We are the schoolboys (or
girls) waiting for the last obstacle
to fall so we can become an embod
iment of what we want to resemble.
And we become less concerned
with the greatness of the future's
strip.
As a result, we find ourselves emp
ty-handed, defeated at the first slip.
This is why we laugh at the
American dream —it is now a
dead-end suburban street. Why
would you want, as they put it in
"21 & Over," "a big house, a big
family, a minivan, driving to work,"
when you could change the world
when you could be something
truly "great?"
The American dream has shriv
eled; we over-excited it into some
premature recoil. The backlash has
become the paradigm. There is no
longer the dream, but the fantasy.
It is one no longer reflective of
the popular image of Americana,
with its endless roads, different for
every individual. It is twisted and
distorted into the fantastical Cin
derella stories that are easily
shoved into Hollywood films and
watched on planes.
What do I make of this? Well,
nothing. But I wonder: What do
you wait for? If it's for the final
strip of the garment, you may as
well close your eyes until you're
there, but if on the other hand you
can love the entire bumpy dance,
then keep those eyes open wide.

At some point,
the American
dream took a turn
away from the
frenzy on Wall
Street and a
material lust
that so demanded
headstrong
ambition.
The night before flying back to
Stanford, I was with a few old
pals at a bar playing, for the
first time, Cards Against Humani
ty. A particularly vicious variant of
Apples to Apples, Cards Against
Humanity is a card game in which
players construct absurd and inten
tionally inappropriate phrases with
their drawn word cards. Every
round, the most inappropriate
phrase wins. I was surprised to find
myself laughing the game is
acutely tuned to our generation, its
pop culture and its humor.
There was one phrase in partic
ular that caught my eye and unani
mously won: "Q: What came out of
my butt?" and the answer, "The
American dream."
The next day aboard a long
flight, I did what all traveling peo
ple do: catch up on all the movies
you would never pay to see or nev
er even know existed, along with all
sorts of modern ideologies being
flushed out of Hollywood.
I never sleep well on those kind
of flights in fact, I am astonished
at my acquired ability to watch five
movies in a row which led to an
in-depth exploration of what exact
ly was this "American dream."
What made people think it was a
reality, and why is it today that we
now laugh at the American dream?
Is it our own dream anymore, or is
it merely an outdated ideal export
ed to outsiders wishing to move to
the XXL land of purple mountain
majesties, computer chips, Coca-
Cola, phone apps, etc?
I believe that at some point, fol
lowing the craze of the "Great Gats
by" era, the American dream took a
turn away from the frenzy on Wall
Street and a material lust that so
demanded headstrong ambition.
Flying at 35,000 feet, I saw how
Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn
symbolized the new dream. The
dream became more personal, tak
ing on the values of the "ideal" fam
ily and the "American way of life."
The American way of life devel
oped, and eventually this expanded
(civil rights, for instance) to repre
sent ideas, morals, and principles.
It would be nice to say we made
some progress as a whole, for these

priorities seem like a feasible and
noble aim. But somehow, we've
changed once more: We've tossed
that idealism aside in favor of
"Jobs" and "The Social Network,"
becoming once more the wolves of
Wall Street (though I have yet to
see that film). Sure, the characters
that populate these films may have
faults, but who really cares now,
considering that they embody man
achieving the impossible? The
means they employ are irrelevant
to us, we think: Like in your typical
Hollywood film, only what hap
pened in the end matters.
Outside America, as in the film
"American Dreams in China," the
acts we perform still take prece
dence in the dream. And yet here in
America and especially at Stanford,
this old ideal is not the reality: Liv
ing in a garage and losing your
friends is not indicative of a failed
(American) dream, but may be the
startup of the next big thing that
will take you there, to the podium
(of TED talks!).
And what else is "there"? Well,
the empty house of Steve Jobs, the
empty office of Cheng Dongqing,
the empty office of Mark Zucker
berg. The process of success, once

idealized in the American dream,
has been divorced from its goal: It
is empty, and has instead become
an amorphous idea of being a
somebody, a puree (this, I'll admit,
was originally a typo, but I like the
imagery) of potential.
