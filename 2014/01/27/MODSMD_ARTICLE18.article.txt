# CARD SPLITS TRIP
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's
volleyball team remained on
the road this week after
two loses on the road last
week and looked to re
verse its struggles with away
matches. The Cardinal re
turned to campus on Sunday

with some success, losing its
first match against No. 7
BYU but beating Cal Baptist
the next day in three sets.
The Cougars (6-2, 6-0
MPSF) beat the Cardinal
(4-3, 1-3) in four close sets
25-20, 19-25, 25-23, 25-21.

thanks to the high-intensity
environment of more than
5,000 people.
Senior outside hitter Steven
Irvin once again led Stanford,

hitting .370 for the night with
15 kills. Senior Eric Mochalski
came off the bench and played
an impressive match with 10
kills and four digs. Junior mid
dle Spencer Haly also had a
perfect hitting night, with 8
kills and no errors on nine
swings.
Despite Stanford's consis
tent offensive performance,
BYU out-hit Stanford .347 to
.325 and out-blocked the Car
dinal 10.5 to 7. Three BYU
players put up double-digit
kills, and the Cougars hit a
match-high .586 in the fourth
and final set.

While Stanford was able to
win the second set after losing
the first, BYU played a more
aggressive match overall and
was able to limit Stanford's of
fense to 10 kills in the fourth
set. The combination of BYU
out-hitting Stanford along
with BYU's strong home
court advantage that helped
elevate their performance in
critical moments proved to be
too much for Stanford.
The next day, Stanford re
turned to California and faced
Cal Baptist. The team gained
a much-needed win in a three
set match, beating Cal Baptist
25-15, 25-18, 25-18. Stanford
had a great passing game,
with strong communication
and consistency.
The service game also
helped the Cardinal gain an
edge over the Lancers. Stan
ford hit .408 for the night and
held Cal Baptist to a .176
with a strong blocking de
fense. Sophomore setter
James Shaw had a terrific
night with 31 assists, five kills
and four blocks. The win pro
vided the Cardinal with a
confidence boost after a
three-match losing streak.
Stanford is in a good position
to build on the momentum,
with its next two matches at
home where they are un
defeated.
