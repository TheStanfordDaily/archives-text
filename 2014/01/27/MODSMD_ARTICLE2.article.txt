## GSB to build housing for MBA students 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate School of Business (GSB) will be
constructing a new residence complex to address
a persistent demand for housing for first-year
MBA students. The new building will be located
west of the Schwab Residential Center and across
from the Knight Management Center.
According to Raj Chellaraj, the GSB's associ
ate dean for finance and administration, the
Board of Trustees approved the building concept
last month and further progress on the design will
be made this spring.
The new building will be a 1,400-square-foot,
three- to four-story complex and will have multi
ple buildings arranged around a courtyard, simi
lar to the layout of the Schwab Residential Center.
Units will have two bedrooms and two bathrooms
with a shared kitchen and will be slightly larger
than the 300-square-feet rooms in the Schwab
Residential Center.
"There will be 200 more net beds, and the
whole concept would be to accommodate more
first-year MBA students, single or married with
out children," Chellaraj said.
The new complex will also feature smaller din
ing rooms for students to use for socializing as
well as a common kitchen and dining space, he
added.

Plans for the residence complex have been in
discussion for the past few years but developed
more rapidly in the last year, said Bernadette de
Rafael, the GSB's director for facilities and hospi
talities and project manager for the new complex.

would add 200 net beds to the
on-campus housing options for GSB.
