## GSB to build housing for MBA students 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate School of Business (GSB) will be
constructing a new residence complex to address
a persistent demand for housing for first-year
MBA students. The new building will be located
west of the Schwab Residential Center and across
from the Knight Management Center.
According to Raj Chellaraj, the GSB's associ
ate dean for finance and administration, the
Board of Trustees approved the building concept
last month and further progress on the design will
be made this spring.
The new building will be a 1,400-square-foot,
three- to four-story complex and will have multi
ple buildings arranged around a courtyard, simi
lar to the layout of the Schwab Residential Center.
Units will have two bedrooms and two bathrooms
with a shared kitchen and will be slightly larger
than the 300-square-feet rooms in the Schwab
Residential Center.
"There will be 200 more net beds, and the
whole concept would be to accommodate more
first-year MBA students, single or married with
out children," Chellaraj said.
The new complex will also feature smaller din
ing rooms for students to use for socializing as
well as a common kitchen and dining space, he
added.

Plans for the residence complex have been in
discussion for the past few years but developed
more rapidly in the last year, said Bernadette de
Rafael, the GSB's director for facilities and hospi
talities and project manager for the new complex.

roughly 400 students each
year. Built 17 years ago,
Schwab houses a maximum
of 220 first-year students and
is consistently at full capacity
with a waitlist each academic

year of 50 to 70 graduate stu
dents.
Other locations on campus
also house first-year MBA
students last year, about
50 lived in the Munger Grad
uate Residences and 80 in
Escondido Village, figures
that have remained constant
over the past couple years,
Chellaraj said. The remain
der of first-year students live

off campus.
In addition to accommo
dating more first-year MBA
students, the new residence
complex will be built with the
goal of integrating GSC's liv
ing and learning environ
ment.
"[All first years] take the
same classes, and we want to
give more opportunity to the
students to collaborate and
innovate with their class
mates," de Rafael said
The GSB also plans to in
tegrate residents from
Schwab by incorporating
more open meeting spaces in
the new dormitory.
Additionally, one-fourth of

the new complex will be used
to host students taking part
in the GSB's Executive Edu
cational Program as well as
other programs that are not
enrolled full year, added de
Rafael.
The GSB is still in the
process of finalizing how
much the construction plans
will cost; however, the GSB is
set on breaking ground in
late 2014 and completing con
struction by the summer of
2016. The additional space for
student housing will not af
fect future MBA class sizes.
