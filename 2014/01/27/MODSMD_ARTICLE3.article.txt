# Dorm tutoring programs cut
## CTL and Hume offer drop-in tutors instead 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The Center for Teaching and Learning
(CTL) and the Hume Center for Writing and
Speaking have chosen to no longer hire resi
dential tutors (RTs) and residential writing
tutors (RWTs) and instead offer drop-in tu
toring in central dorm locations beginning
next academic year.
However, this change does not affect the
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) resi
dent tutoring program, which is separate
from the CTL and Hume programs.
According to Julia Bleakney, director of

Hume, the two departments have chosen to
switch over to a non-residential-based tutor
ing system in order to maximize use of the
tutoring resources and reach out to more
students. Bleakney said that because there
are more houses than available tutors, tutors
are unevenly distributed across campus.
By not attaching tutors to residences,
CTL and Hume hope that accessibility to tu
tors for students will increase.
"A big benefit of having [a tutor] who is
living in that dorm is because they are a rec
ognized member of that community," said
Tim Randazzo, assistant director for tutor
ing and teaching programs at CTL. "Howev
er, a challenge that we've faced is that this tu
toring is only accessible for people in that
particular community."
Randazzo also stated that the tutors' in
terest in taking up the responsibilities of
both a staff and tutor has been decreasing,

citing the decline in number of RTs from
16 last year to 13 this year hired by CTL,
which consistently employs around 80 total
tutors every year, according to Randazzo.
Comparatively, Bleakney reported that the
total number of RWTs that Hume provides is
lower, averaging eight to 12 in the last few
years.
Additionally, CTL and Hume are working
to be more flexible in then* resources provid
ed for students. Since tutor positions would
n't be live-in, tutoring locations, schedules
and the number of tutors would be more ad
justable from week to week.
"We'd be able to better move our tutors
and access students with the ebb and flow of
the quarter," Bleakney said. "We can add a
tutor when it's busier and be more respon
sive to demands that we're hearing about
from students."
In addition to changing
their tutoring system, both
CTL and Hume will be ex
panding drop-in and appoint
ment hours, especially now
that Hume has opened in a
new location.
"One of the features
we're most excited about is
that we have our own build
ing," said Bleakney. "We're
able to open it for much lat
er hours. We're not at the

point where we're offering
24/7 tutoring, but we're just
looking to maximize our re
sources."
CTL similarly plans to
offer more hours at its cen
tral campus tutoring loca
tion at Cubberley and Sweet
Hall, said Randazzo, who al
so added that CTL is hoping
to hire 20 additional tutors,
bringing the total number of
tutors to 100.
At this stage, CTL and
Hume are not fully merging
their services, but they are
in communication and col
laborating due to the similar
transitions in their tutoring
services for next year. The

directors are currently look
ing for potential locations to
host the drop-in tutoring.
"Our main criteria is try
ing to find a place accessible
by all residents," said Ran
dazzo. "For example a
lounge would not be suffi
cient since not everyone has
access to that."
However, not having an
RWT or RT could hurt the
dorm community, according
to Leow Hui Min 'l6, who
was thinking of becoming an
RWT next year in her dorm,
Casa Zapata.
"I feel you're losing out
on the opportunity for com
munity," Leow said.

Leow contended that
when there is a resident tu
tor, students know that the
resource is there and will be
more willing to actually use
the resource than in the case
of a drop-in tutor that they
don't know.
"I think it's very helpful if
the tutor lives in a dorm," Le
ow said, "because they're
part of the community, while
[in the other case] people
would have to be like, 'Oh, I
have to see someone over
there to get tutoring and I
don't really know them.'"
