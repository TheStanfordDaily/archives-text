# Dorm tutoring programs cut
## CTL and Hume offer drop-in tutors instead 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
The Center for Teaching and Learning
(CTL) and the Hume Center for Writing and
Speaking have chosen to no longer hire resi
dential tutors (RTs) and residential writing
tutors (RWTs) and instead offer drop-in tu
toring in central dorm locations beginning
next academic year.
However, this change does not affect the
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) resi
dent tutoring program, which is separate
from the CTL and Hume programs.
According to Julia Bleakney, director of

Hume, the two departments have chosen to
switch over to a non-residential-based tutor
ing system in order to maximize use of the
tutoring resources and reach out to more
students. Bleakney said that because there
are more houses than available tutors, tutors
are unevenly distributed across campus.
By not attaching tutors to residences,
CTL and Hume hope that accessibility to tu
tors for students will increase.
"A big benefit of having [a tutor] who is
living in that dorm is because they are a rec
ognized member of that community," said
Tim Randazzo, assistant director for tutor
ing and teaching programs at CTL. "Howev
er, a challenge that we've faced is that this tu
toring is only accessible for people in that
particular community."
Randazzo also stated that the tutors' in
terest in taking up the responsibilities of
both a staff and tutor has been decreasing,

citing the decline in number of RTs from
16 last year to 13 this year hired by CTL,
which consistently employs around 80 total
tutors every year, according to Randazzo.
Comparatively, Bleakney reported that the
total number of RWTs that Hume provides is
lower, averaging eight to 12 in the last few
years.
Additionally, CTL and Hume are working
to be more flexible in then* resources provid
ed for students. Since tutor positions would
n't be live-in, tutoring locations, schedules
and the number of tutors would be more ad
justable from week to week.
"We'd be able to better move our tutors
and access students with the ebb and flow of
the quarter," Bleakney said. "We can add a
tutor when it's busier and be more respon
sive to demands that we're hearing about
