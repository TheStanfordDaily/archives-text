# 2014 Chinese New Year Spring Gala
## SPEAKERS & EVENTS Celebrating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, The Stanford Law Review
and the Stanford Journal of Civil Rights and
Civil Liberties hosted "The Civil Rights Act
at Fifty," a symposium celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The symposium, held in the Law School,
featured an array of panels and talks focused
around the history of the civil rights move
ment and the state of civil rights in the coun

try today.
Friday night featured a panel on the his
tory of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with
speakers from the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Research and Education Institute at Stan
ford University, the University of Virginia
School of Law and the Stanford Law School.
Following the panel was a talk given by
Eva Paterson, president and founder of the
Equal Justice Society an organization
dedicated to changing the law through pro
gressive legal theory, public policy and prac

tice.
For Paterson, the symposium and the
panels were not only a chance to talk about
the history of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
but also an opportunity for "thinking about
where we are, where we're going and where
we've been."
"I think we should all take this opportuni
ty to deepen our understanding of our histo
ry, through these discussions and panels,"

Stanford Chinese Dance put on a performance, titled Winter Sky, at the Association of Chinese Students and Scholars at Stanford's
Chinese New Year Spring Gala on Saturday, Jan. 25 at Memorial Auditorium. The event received more than 1,200 registrations.
Paterson said, adding that
pop culture is useful for bet
ter understanding our histo
ry.
Paterson said that it is im
portant to understand the
factors that led up to the Civ
il Rights Act, and in particu
lar the events that were driv
ing people to resist racism.
She cited the episode on June
11,1963 when Alabama Gov
ernor George Wallace
blocked the University of Al
abama entrance to black stu
dents James Hood and Vi
vian Malone Jones and how
that event eventually led to
the March on Washington.
"It's very important to
understand what was fueling
people and why a quarter of a
million people showed up in
Washington, D.C., on August
28,1963," she said.
Paterson added that to
day the country is not a post
racial society, as issues of
racism still permeate society
today including racially bi
ased ads negatively depicting
the Obama family, the shoot
ing of young black men be
cause of a subconscious bias
against black faces and race
conscious voting rights laws
that prevent certain people
from voting.
Saturday featured four
more panels, focused on top
ics such as sex, gender and
sexuality in civil rights, and
the changing tides of the en
forcement of the Civil Rights
Act. A panel of three legal

scholars discussed employ
ment discrimination and
freedom of association.
Richard Ford 'BB, a pro
fessor of civil rights and an
tidiscrimination at Stanford
Law, commented on the im
portance of understanding
true intent in employment
discrimination cases, as
someone could be an incom
petent employee yet claim
discrimination as a result of
their loss of job.
On the other hand, em
ployers have to follow the du
ty of making decisions that
do not perpetuate preexist
ing social inequalities, ac
cording to Ford.
Richard Epstein, the Lau
rence A. Tisch professor of
law at the NYU School of
Law and a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institute, and
Samuel Bagenstos, professor
of law at the University of
Michigan Law School, both
talked about public accom
modation laws and recent
freedom of association civil
rights issues.
Specifically, Bagestos cit
ed the "Boy Scouts of Ameri
ca v. Dale" case in 2000, in
which it was determined that
the Boy Scouts, as a private
organization, were allowed to
exclude members based on
certain criteria because the
presence of that person
would affect the group's abil
ity to advocate their view
points.
The symposium ended
with a closing reception at
the Law Lounge on Saturday
afternoon.
