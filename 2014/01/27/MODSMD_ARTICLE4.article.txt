This weekend, The Stanford Law Review
and the Stanford Journal of Civil Rights and
Civil Liberties hosted "The Civil Rights Act
at Fifty," a symposium celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The symposium, held in the Law School,
featured an array of panels and talks focused
around the history of the civil rights move
ment and the state of civil rights in the coun

try today.
Friday night featured a panel on the his
tory of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with
speakers from the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Research and Education Institute at Stan
ford University, the University of Virginia
School of Law and the Stanford Law School.
Following the panel was a talk given by
Eva Paterson, president and founder of the
Equal Justice Society an organization
dedicated to changing the law through pro
gressive legal theory, public policy and prac

tice.
For Paterson, the symposium and the
panels were not only a chance to talk about
the history of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
but also an opportunity for "thinking about
where we are, where we're going and where
we've been."
"I think we should all take this opportuni
ty to deepen our understanding of our histo
ry, through these discussions and panels,"
