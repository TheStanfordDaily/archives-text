The first winter quarter meeting
of the 46th Faculty Senate took place
last Thursday, focusing both on future
plans for the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP) and on Stanford's
role in online learning.

create a more flexible program in the

program on community health in
Oaxaca, Mexico, which goes beyond
the scope of medicine.
"The focus of this program is
community health," Salvidar said.
"But really the question the seminar
asks is this: What does it take to cre
ate a community that can be called
healthy?"
Seventy students applied for the
15-slot Oaxaca program, and BOSP
responded to the high demand by
adding a preparatory course in
spring quarter in order to enrich the
seminar experience. Saldivar de
scribed plans to experiment with
running two parallel Oaxaca courses
in the future.
Saldivar also discussed the value
of internships, which offer addition
al opportunities to students study
ing abroad.
"Internship programs also rep
resent for us a pathway to the fu
ture," Saldivar said. "This is some

thing that I think we can develop
further."
Other future plans for BOSP that
Saldivar discussed included expan
sion of the Cape Town program to
three quarters and collaborative ef
forts with the School of Engineering
for programs in China and India.
In answer to a question from De
bra Satz, senior associate dean for
the Humanities and Ails, Salvidar
stated that BOSP has been working
with faculty to blend the curricular
experience on campus with overseas
experiences as seamlessly as possi
ble. However, the connection be
tween curriculum and experience
would benefit from continued im
provement and a formal structure.
"[We want] a sequence there,
rather than just a randomness,"
Salvidar said. "It's tricky, it's hard to
do, and it doesn't always work."

Stanford's role in online learning
After the discussion on BOSI]
President John Hennessy introduced
an online learning panel held by As
sociate Professor of Education
Mitchell Stevens, Director of the
Open Learning Initiative Candace

Thille and Vice Provost for Online
Learning John Mitchell. This panel
focused on massive open online
courses (MOOCs), which could po
tentially offer higher education to
anyone with Internet access.
In introducing the panel, Hen
nessy discussed the role of MOOC
development at Stanford, prioritizing
the importance of using online learn
ing technologies to improve the expe
riences of Stanford students on cam
pus.
"One area I'm particularly excited
about is... using technology to study
the effects of our pedagogy," Hen
nessy said. "Online technology could
be a significant enhancement in
terms of figuring out how our stu
dents are mastering courses, and im
proving our pedagogy at a much
more rapid rate."
He added that MOOCs could ex
tend Stanford's reach to students
overseas and facilitate access to high
education for a wider range of people
in terms of affordability and accessi
bility.
Stevens discussed the rising cost
of higher education and its increas
ing burden on students and their

families.
"There's a reason people are
thinking about college educations as
consumer products," Stevens said.
"They're literally mortgaging their
own fiitures to pay for college."
Stevens described continuing ad
vances in digital media as allowing
MOOCs to dramatically increase ac
cess to higher education.
"I am convinced we are at an
epochal, pivotal moment in the histo
ry of higher education," Stevens said.
"This is a different kind of change."
Mitchell discussed implications of
MOOCs for teachers spreading their
knowledge.
"We've all taught to classrooms
full of students and enjoyed the rock
star feeling of being in front of a
crowd," Mitchell said. "But that's
nothing compared to reaching tens
of thousands of people with your vi
sion of the field."
Mitchell discussed Stanford's
MOOC program as a method of cre
ating more courses in electrical en
gineering, English and core biology
subjects. Future strategic directions
for the MOOC program include
partnering with other institutions

and becoming a hub of experimenta
tion in the field.
However, Raymond Levitt M.S.
'73 Ph.D. '75, professor of civil and
environmental engineering, pointed
out that some institutions of higher
learning could be threatened or
even eliminated if materials made
by top-tier universities dominated
the market.
"Our hope is that... we're hum
ble and recognize the organizational
diversity of American education in
and of itself," Stevens said in re
sponse. "[Our] goal isn't to close oth
er universities, but to add value to
that ecosystem."
Andrea Goldsmith, professor in
the School of Engineering, asked
the panel to predict what the great
est successes and failures of the
MOOC experiment would be 10
years in the future.
Stevens responded that there is
no future alternative to MOOCs.
"It's not an experiment,"
Stevens said. "It's a new reality ...
there's no turning back."

program on community health in
Oaxaca, Mexico, which goes beyond
the scope of medicine.
"The focus of this program is
community health," Salvidar said.
"But really the question the seminar
asks is this: What does it take to cre
ate a community that can be called
healthy?"
Seventy students applied for the
15-slot Oaxaca program, and BOSP
responded to the high demand by
adding a preparatory course in
spring quarter in order to enrich the
seminar experience. Saldivar de
scribed plans to experiment with
running two parallel Oaxaca courses
in the future.
Saldivar also discussed the value
of internships, which offer addition
al opportunities to students study
ing abroad.
"Internship programs also rep
resent for us a pathway to the fu
ture," Saldivar said. "This is some

thing that I think we can develop
further."
Other future plans for BOSP that
Saldivar discussed included expan
sion of the Cape Town program to
three quarters and collaborative ef
forts with the School of Engineering
for programs in China and India.
In answer to a question from De
bra Satz, senior associate dean for
the Humanities and Ails, Salvidar
stated that BOSP has been working
with faculty to blend the curricular
experience on campus with overseas
experiences as seamlessly as possi
ble. However, the connection be
tween curriculum and experience
would benefit from continued im
provement and a formal structure.
"[We want] a sequence there,
rather than just a randomness,"
Salvidar said. "It's tricky, it's hard to
do, and it doesn't always work."

Stanford's role in online learning
After the discussion on BOSI]
President John Hennessy introduced
an online learning panel held by As
sociate Professor of Education
Mitchell Stevens, Director of the
Open Learning Initiative Candace

Thille and Vice Provost for Online
Learning John Mitchell. This panel
focused on massive open online
courses (MOOCs), which could po
tentially offer higher education to
anyone with Internet access.
In introducing the panel, Hen
nessy discussed the role of MOOC
development at Stanford, prioritizing
the importance of using online learn
ing technologies to improve the expe
riences of Stanford students on cam
pus.
"One area I'm particularly excited
about is... using technology to study
the effects of our pedagogy," Hen
nessy said. "Online technology could
be a significant enhancement in
terms of figuring out how our stu
dents are mastering courses, and im
proving our pedagogy at a much
more rapid rate."
He added that MOOCs could ex
tend Stanford's reach to students
overseas and facilitate access to high
education for a wider range of people
in terms of affordability and accessi
bility.
Stevens discussed the rising cost
of higher education and its increas
ing burden on students and their

families.
"There's a reason people are
thinking about college educations as
consumer products," Stevens said.
"They're literally mortgaging their
own fiitures to pay for college."
Stevens described continuing ad
vances in digital media as allowing
MOOCs to dramatically increase ac
cess to higher education.
"I am convinced we are at an
epochal, pivotal moment in the histo
ry of higher education," Stevens said.
"This is a different kind of change."
Mitchell discussed implications of
MOOCs for teachers spreading their
knowledge.
"We've all taught to classrooms
full of students and enjoyed the rock
star feeling of being in front of a
crowd," Mitchell said. "But that's
nothing compared to reaching tens
of thousands of people with your vi
sion of the field."
Mitchell discussed Stanford's
MOOC program as a method of cre
ating more courses in electrical en
gineering, English and core biology
subjects. Future strategic directions
for the MOOC program include
partnering with other institutions

and becoming a hub of experimenta
tion in the field.
However, Raymond Levitt M.S.
'73 Ph.D. '75, professor of civil and
environmental engineering, pointed
out that some institutions of higher
learning could be threatened or
even eliminated if materials made
by top-tier universities dominated
the market.
"Our hope is that... we're hum
ble and recognize the organizational
diversity of American education in
and of itself," Stevens said in re
sponse. "[Our] goal isn't to close oth
er universities, but to add value to
that ecosystem."
Andrea Goldsmith, professor in
the School of Engineering, asked
the panel to predict what the great
est successes and failures of the
MOOC experiment would be 10
years in the future.
Stevens responded that there is
no future alternative to MOOCs.
"It's not an experiment,"
Stevens said. "It's a new reality ...
there's no turning back."
