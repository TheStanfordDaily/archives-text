## Yahoo buys alumni-founded company 
### NITISH KULKARNI STAFF WRITER 
Yahoo acquired the Stanford
alumni-founded and former
StartX company Aviate this
month. The purchase is part of a
series of companies and tech
nologies recently acquired by
the search engine, including an
other Stanford alumni-founded
company, PeerCDN.
Aviate, acquired by Yahoo for
an undisclosed amount, created
an app and ecosystem for the
Android operating system
one which contextually changes
what users see based on where
they are and what they are do
ing. The company was also fea
tured at StartX's Demo Day last
year.
Paul Montoy-Wilson 'OB M.S.

'O9, William Choi 'O9 M.S. 'O9
and Mark Daiss founded the
company.
"Aviate does two things. It
simplifies your phone, and
makes your phone smarter,"
Montoy-Wilson said. "The vision
of our product is to surface the
world of information at the mo
ment it's useful."
Montoy-Wilson explained
that what the app does funda
mentally is solve a search prob
lem, changing search from being
keyword-based to one that is
more contextual. He said that
with the huge number of apps
and amount of data available,
getting to it all quickly is more
difficult than ever.
"[There are two] problems
one is the front end, where
we get to build the user ex
perience for the world that
we live in today," he added.
"On the back end, it's a new

search problem."
"Things like your loca
tion, your speed, your usage
pattern, your email habits
can be used to help surface
relevant apps and informa
tion based on what you do,"
he explained.
Montoy-Wilson added
that the Yahoo acquisition
gave them the opportunity
to connect more users to the
app, and get more content.
"We're super excited to be
a part of Yahoo," he said.
"When we started talking to
Yahoo, it was very clear that
their vision of the future of
mobile and mobile search
was aligned with our future."
Cameron Teitelman 'lO,
CEO and founder of Stan
ford-affiliated incubator
StartX, theorized that the
acquisition was related to
Yahoo's role as a content
provider.
"If you look at Yahoo's
strategy on the web, they
were always a content por
tal," Teitelman said. "They
would show users content
and have advertising. I think
that Yahoo owning the
homescreen of your phone is
basically an analogue to
their web strategy."
Montoy-Wilson said that
the StartX community
played a role in their start
up's success and Teitelman
added that the Aviate co
founders were big contribu
tors to other founders within
the incubator as well.
"They were at Google
Play before, and were An
droid engineers," Teitelman
said. "They definitely under
stand mobile in and out."
Yahoo and Aviate de
clined to comment on the
price and specific terms of
the acquisition.
