# FALLING JUST SHORT
## MODI INJURY DOOMS CARD 
### SAM FISHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford men's gymnastics put
up a fight on its home turf at Burn
ham Pavilion, but the No. 4 Cardi
nal had to settle for a third-place
finish after it could not overcome
strong efforts from No. 6 Cal and
No. 2 Michigan at Saturday's Stan
ford Open. Stanford led for most of
the meet, taking a three-point lead
into the final rotation, but the Card
could not put up enough points on
the high bar to hold off Cal and
Michigan, which passed Stanford
to finish in second and first place,
respectively.
The Cardinal (2-0) had defeated
Cal (0-2) on each of the two Satur
days prior to the Stanford Open,
first in Berkeley by 5.450 points
and then at Burnham Pavilion by
8.850 points. Stanford finished with
a final score of 429.900 in the Stan

ford Open, lower than its winning
scores the previous two weeks but
higher than Cal's scores over that
stretch.
The Bears made a big enough
improvement to make the Cardinal
pay for the slight decrease in
points, squeaking past Stanford for
second place with a final score of
430.300.
Freshman phenom Akash Modi
suffered the first setback of his
young collegiate career, falling on
the parallel bars. Modi's fall re
quired stitches on the top of his
head, causing him to miss the final
two rotations of the meet. Through
the first four rotations, Modi had
an all-around score of 60.050 and
put up the team-high score in both
the pommel horse (15.100) and the
vault (14.900).
With Modi out, the Cardinal
had to dig deep to try to pick up the
victory. In the meet's format,
teams can have up to six gymnasts
compete with the top five individ
ual scores counting for the team
score. Stanford planned to have on
ly five gymnasts compete on the
high bar, including Modi, so the

freshman's injury caused a late
lineup addition in fellow freshman
Andrew Misiolek. Misiolek scored
an 11.900 in his first collegiate
high-bar action.
Stanford's score of 66.550 on
the high bar did not end up being
enough. While it was only slightly
lower than Cal's high bar score of
67.600 and above Michigan's score
of 64.350, both the Bears and the
Wolverines took advantage of
stronger events in their final rota
tion to pull ahead. Michigan put up
a remarkable score of 76.200 on the
floor the highest team score in
any event all night to take first
place while the Bears scored a
strong 72.700 on the pommel horse
to snag second.
Stanford did pick up two indi
vidual wins, both courtesy of soph
omore Dennis Zaremski. Zaremski
finished with an impressive score
of 15.950 in the rings, well clear of
Michigan's top scorer Alex Bubnov
(15.200), and he followed that up
with a 15.350 on the parallel bars to
edge out Michigan's Syque Caesar

Sophomore Dennis Zaremski (above) provided a strong performance for the Card, scoring a meet-high
15.950 on rings, but it was ultimately not enough as Stanford finished in third behind Cal and Michigan.
(15.300).
With Modi's injury, the
Cardinal did not have a sin
gle gymnast finish the all
around competition. Cal's
Donothan Bailey picked up
the all-around crown with a
final score of 88.900. Modi's
average score of 15.0125 per
event would have been
enough for his third consec
utive all-around victory had
he continued at that pace in
stead of suffering an injury.
After a weekend off, the
Cardinal will head on the
road for its next competition
a date with No. 1 Oklaho
ma in Norman, Okla., on
Feb. 8 at 5 p.m. Stanford's
next home competition is
March 1 at 4 p.m.
