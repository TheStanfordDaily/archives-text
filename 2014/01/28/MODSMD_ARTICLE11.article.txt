Stanford's No. 11 men's
swimming and diving team
swept a weekend doubleheader
against No. 5 Arizona and Ari
zona State with 185-113 and 135-
101 wins, respectively, while the
No. 4 women's swimming and
diving team also defeated No. 10
Arizona 158-137 on Friday and
Arizona State 148-68 on Satur

In Friday's contest against
Arizona, junior David Nolan and
sophomore Danny Thomson
each won two individual events
to power the men's team to vic
tory in its first dual meet
against a Pac-12 foe on the sea
son.
"It's our first Pac-12 meet
and the first of only four," men's
swimming head coach Ted
Knapp told GoStanford.com.
"It's really important that we
take advantage of these four op
portunities to get race ready,
work on strategies and build
confidence. I think we accom
plished that today."
Thomson secured the dis
tance race wins for the Cardinal
with a time of 9:16.79 in the
1,000-yard freestyle and a time
of 4:27.03 in the 500-yard
freestyle. Nolan won the 100-
yard freestyle with a time of
44.34 and also captured the vic
tory in the 100-yard backstroke,
the race for which he owns an
NCAA title.
On Saturday, Stanford's un
derclassmen led the team in a
triumph over the Sun Devils to
pick up the second victory of the
weekend. Thomson again won
the 1,000-yard freestyle with an
improved time of 9:15.53, and
freshman Connor Black came in
first in the 50-yard freestyle with
a time of 20.68. Max Williamson,
another freshman, won the 200-
yard IM more than three sec
onds ahead of any other competi
tor, finishing in 1:48.27.
"The guys who really im
pressed me today were some of
the freshmen," Knapp told
