## BALANCE POWERS VICTORIES 
### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's No. 11 men's
swimming and diving team
swept a weekend doubleheader
against No. 5 Arizona and Ari
zona State with 185-113 and 135-
101 wins, respectively, while the
No. 4 women's swimming and
diving team also defeated No. 10
Arizona 158-137 on Friday and
Arizona State 148-68 on Satur
day.
In Friday's contest against
Arizona, junior David Nolan and
sophomore Danny Thomson
each won two individual events
to power the men's team to vic
tory in its first dual meet
against a Pac-12 foe on the sea
son.
"It's our first Pac-12 meet
and the first of only four," men's
swimming head coach Ted
Knapp told GoStanford.com.
"It's really important that we
take advantage of these four op
portunities to get race ready,
work on strategies and build
confidence. I think we accom
plished that today."
Thomson secured the dis
tance race wins for the Cardinal
with a time of 9:16.79 in the
1,000-yard freestyle and a time
of 4:27.03 in the 500-yard
freestyle. Nolan won the 100-
yard freestyle with a time of
44.34 and also captured the vic
tory in the 100-yard backstroke,
the race for which he owns an
NCAA title.
On Saturday, Stanford's un
derclassmen led the team in a
triumph over the Sun Devils to
pick up the second victory of the
weekend. Thomson again won
the 1,000-yard freestyle with an
improved time of 9:15.53, and
freshman Connor Black came in
first in the 50-yard freestyle with
a time of 20.68. Max Williamson,
another freshman, won the 200-
yard IM more than three sec
onds ahead of any other competi
tor, finishing in 1:48.27.
"The guys who really im
pressed me today were some of
the freshmen," Knapp told
GoStanford.com. "It was
really good to see that the
freshman class is progress
ing as well as we were hop
ing, as well as some other
sophomores and juniors."
For the women's team, it
was the upperclassmen who
led the Card as Stanford
won five of the first six
events on its way to a win in
its first meet at the Avery
Aquatics Center since No
vember.
Senior Felicia Lee and
junior Katie Olsen each won
two events, including a 100-
yard backstroke victory
with a time of 53.68 for Lee
and a 100-yard breaststroke
victory with a time of 1:00.41
for Olsen. Junior Maddy
Schaefer also won the 50-
yard freestyle in a contest
between arguably the na
tion's top two 50-yard
freestylers, beating Arizona
senior Margo Geer by 0.61
seconds with a time of 22.24.
"Regardless of the times,
being forced to race some
one of Margo's caliber is
great," women's swimming

head coach Greg Meehan
told GoStanford.com. "She's
absolutely a sensational
swimmer she's the de
fending champion in both
the 50 and 100. It was a
great environment for those
two to go at each other."
On Saturday, Stanford
jumped to a big lead and
cruised to victory behind
some of the team's younger
swimmers. Freshman Grace
Carlson won the 200-yard
backstroke in 1:59.32 and al
so contributed to several re
lay wins, and freshman Tara
Halsted won the 200-yard
butterfly in 2:00.89.
Lee again won a pair of
events, with her 2:01.11 time
in the 200-yard IM that was
more than three seconds
better than the rest of the
field and her 50.02 time in
the 100-yard freestyle that
was nearly a second better
than her closest competitor.
The men's team now
travels to UC-Santa Bar
bara for a meet on Feb. 7 and
USC for a meet on Feb. 8.
The women's team will head
to UCLA for a meet on Feb.
7 that will be televised on the
Pac-12 Networks.
