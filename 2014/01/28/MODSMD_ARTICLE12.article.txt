## OP-ED Air Travel and Global Warming 
### ANDREW M. BRADLEY, B.S., M.S., 2002, Ph.D., 2010 
A person's air travel has an
outsized environmental cost
relative to his or her other
activities. Here is a rule of thumb:
The environmental impact per
passenger on a commercial air
plane flight is about the same as
that of one person's driving the
same distance solo in a moderately
efficient car.
So a passenger jet equipped to
carry 200 people 2000 miles has
roughly the same environmental
impact as 200 moderately efficient
cars driving 2000 miles. To put it
another way, making one round
trip to Europe from San Francisco
in a year has about the same envi
ronmental impact as a year of typ
ical car commuting to and from
your workplace.
Roughly speaking, one to two
round-trip, cross-country flights
have about the same environmen
tal impact as a typical omnivore's
meat consumption in a year or as a
typical Bay Area resident's por
tion of the area's residential elec
tric and gas usage in a year.
The rule of thumb is supported
by documents produced by, among
others, the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration, the International
Civil Aviation Organization, the
Natural Resources Defense Coun
cil and the Union of Concerned Sci
entists. This rule also accounts for
how airlines respond to demand.
Globally, aviation contributes
approximately three to five per
cent of warming effects, depend
ing on details of assessment. But
this is a small number only be
cause relatively few people fly at
present.
What can we do? Increasing the
efficiency of air travel is impor
tant, of course. But experts agree
that for the next few decades,
there will be no major changes in
the basic mechanisms of passen
ger airplanes. That is not to say in
vention in this area is not welcome;
it is just not nearly enough.
The most important thing to do
is to reduce consumption, as meas
ured by the product of passengers
and miles. Perhaps the most prom
ising way to reduce our passenger
miles is to change the way we col
laborate and do business as aca
demics and professionals.
Already, some of us regularly
have video conferences with col
leagues elsewhere in the world. In
the coming years, we can develop
virtual conference rooms in which
real-time discussion and collabora
tion will be as rich of experiences
as they are in person.
Similarly, by improving technol

ogy and information delivery, we
can make tomorrow's virtual con
ferences feel not just as natural as,
but also more useful than, today's
in-person conferences. Of course,
in-person collaboration is occasion
ally irreplaceable. But if we invest
our resources and effort into this
project, we can make the majority
of in-person professional trips not
only unnecessary but also undesir
able relative to virtual options.
Here in academia, we apply for
travel grants for purposes of col
laboration. We could broaden trav
el grants to be collaboration
grants. These would allow funds to
be used to improve collaborators'
communications infrastructure:
cameras, writing tablets, collabo
ration software and eventually vir
tual reality equipment. Additional
ly, we could arrange in-person con
ference locations to minimize the
sum of participants' travel miles
and hold multiple small confer
ences in similar subject areas si
multaneously in one location.
Invention and entrepreneur
ship will be essential components
of this project. Substantially in
creased interest in high-quality re
mote collaboration would open and
broaden market opportunities in
communications, networking, com
puter hardware, human-computer
interaction, IT security, local infra
structure management, big data
and more.
Additionally, many of us travel
by air to see family and friends
and to see the world. We can make
reasonable changes to our person
al travel without sacrificing its key
benefits. For example, with better
planning, we can make family vis
its more efficient in terms of
everyone's travel, and we can take
longer but fewer overseas trips.
Still, in this piece I'm really fo
cused on air travel for professional
activities, which is where our tech
nology can have the greatest im
pact. Any time you get on a plane
for job-related travel and think to
yourself, "Ugh, I'd rather not go on
this trip," your feeling is a clear op
portunity for positive change.
We live in an exciting time to be
inventors and thinkers. What we
create, we create forever, for good
or for ill. It's our choice.

I want to thank several of my
friends for contributing ideas to
this piece. Any error is mine.
