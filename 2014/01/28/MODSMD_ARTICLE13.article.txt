# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

### 
In his Jan. 21 piece "Technolo
gy and Unemployment, Part
III," Rahul Gupta-Iwasaki
claimed that "traditional employ
ment is a broken system," a cause
of unhappiness that frustrates our
dreams. While such a view may be
intuitive, here is another under
standing.
On May 1, Catholics celebrate
the feast of St. Joseph the Worker,
the foster father of Jesus Christ.
St. Joseph supported Jesus and
Mary as a carpenter; for all his lack
of education and career, he is vener
ated through nations and ages as
the paragon of industry.
Who would argue that carpen
try is exempt from monotony and
frustration? Yet St. Joseph sacri
ficed the pleasures of the world to
serve his family through taxing la

bor. Likewise we, aspiring to his
happy death in the arms of Jesus
and Mary, can rejoice to do our
work, whatever it is, with ever
greater excellence, for the love of
God. Surely, we will find there a
more certain happiness.
Is progress a flight from the
taxing, the hard, the repugnant?
Then let's run from the lie that
causes all misery: that life can be
without suffering. Rather, we can
offer our labors for the good of our
community, for the love of our
neighbor. Is that a regression or
the greatest revolution?
May St. Joseph protect us.
