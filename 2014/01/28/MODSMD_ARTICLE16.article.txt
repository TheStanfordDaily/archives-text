## Kennedy's Torch and Popping the "Stanford Bubble" 
### Nick Ahamed 
November 22,1963 was an im
portant day for our genera
tion, even though it was
three decades before many of us
were born. On that day, John F.
Kennedy was assassinated. I say
this with no regard for party or pol
icy, but with every regard for hope
and inspiration.
The youngest president ever
elected (but so much more than
that), President Kennedy brought a
flood of youth to Washington and
sparked the imaginations of mil
lions more around the country. In
his inaugural address, he spoke of
the proverbial torch being passed to
a new generation, one whose ener
gy and devotion would "light our
country and all who serve it. And
the glow from that fire can truly
light the world."
That fire was extinguished on
Nov. 22,1963.
Disillusioned, that generation
left the institutions of change that
Kennedy had inspired them to join,
and the old stewards of power
the likes of Nixon returned. But
it did not disappear. Instead, that
rebellious group formed a counter
culture, actively protesting against

a society and political system it
viewed as problematic.
Our institution was one site of
this activity and also of the resulting
counter protests. No one had blown
the "Stanford bubble" yet, appar
ently.
Today, our community, our na
tion and our world are challenged
by the same issues that President
Kennedy labeled "the common ene
mies of man: tyranny, poverty, dis
ease and war itself." But, are we,
the new young people, responding
in the same motivated fashion?
In November 2008,1 would have
said, "Yes." Barack Obama had
seemed to reignite that torch. Dur
ing that election cycle, the Stanford
Democrats sent 130 students for an
Election Day canvass for Obama
in Nevada. The University was
aglow with activity across the polit
ical spectrum.
However, just two years later, as
The Stanford Daily itself reports,
that fervor is disappearing. Having
led President Obama's re-election
campaign on campus and served as
co-president of the Stanford De
mocrats for the last year, I can like
wise speak to the difficulties of en
gaging students in politics.
Throughout the election cycle, I
heard that President Obama is a
"letdown" or a "failure." Our peers
asked: "Why should I dedicate my
time to a man who hasn't done and
won't do anything?" Students, re
signed, drew away from politics.
I'm not here to defend the Pres
ident's record or insist that you sup
port him. I am, however, here to ar
gue that we cannot simply give up
on politics.
Whether we like it or not, politi
cal discourse at the local, state and
national level has a profound impact
on our daily lives. From Palo Alto's
ban on homelessness to immigra
tion reform, Stanford is not as bub
ble wrapped as we like to think.
The world can see into the Stanford
bubble, even if we choose not to
look out of it.
We cannot simply hunker down
and lament political polarization.
We cannot simply blame septuage
narians in Congress for bad policy.
Returning to JFK's speech,
Kennedy reminds us: "In your

hands, my fellow citizens, more
than mine, will rest the final success
or failure of our course.
"Since this country was founded,
each generation of Americans has
been summoned to give testimony
to its national loyalty," JFK said
that day. Stanfordians have consis
tently responded to this call, from
Herbert Hoover and President
Kennedy himself (although he did
drop out) to Ted Koppel and John
Steinbeck. Beyond these traditional
fields, one can easily find a myriad
of Stanfordians whose work on the
nation's behalf has benefited us all.
Indeed, Vint Cerf, who spoke here
recently, helped develop the founda
tion of the Internet under the aus
pices of the Department of Defense.
The question before you now is if
and how you will continue their
legacy.
While the options number too
many to list here, I challenge you to
think about how you can pop your
own Stanford bubble. Perhaps that
means getting involved in one of
Stanford's multiple East Palo Alto
tutoring organizations or coming to
a Stanford Democrats or Stanford
Conservative Society event. Maybe
you want to develop apps with
FWD.US, Mark Zuckerberg's im
migration reform lobby, or work to
ward curing disease with the Na
tional Institute of Health. I could
continue ad nauseam.
If it wants us to leave the Farm
as prepared citizens, the university,
for its part, should do more to en
courage this discourse. It should re
duce regulations on free speech and
encourage our civic engagement.
But until we will demonstrate that
we are a politically active and aware
campus, the administration is un
likely to do so.
In keeping with last week's col
umn, I'd like to conclude with a
challenge. Tonight is President
Obama's sixth State of the Union.
Tune in on your dorm TV As you
consider the challenges our nation
faces, consider how you might bring
your skills to bear on them.
"The trumpet summons us
again." Will you listen?

portant day for our genera
tion, even though it was
three decades before many of us
were born. On that day, John F.
Kennedy was assassinated. I say
this with no regard for party or pol
icy, but with every regard for hope
and inspiration.
The youngest president ever
elected (but so much more than
that), President Kennedy brought a
flood of youth to Washington and
sparked the imaginations of mil
lions more around the country. In
his inaugural address, he spoke of
the proverbial torch being passed to
a new generation, one whose ener
gy and devotion would "light our
country and all who serve it. And
the glow from that fire can truly
light the world."
That fire was extinguished on
Nov. 22,1963.
Disillusioned, that generation
left the institutions of change that
Kennedy had inspired them to join,
and the old stewards of power
the likes of Nixon returned. But
it did not disappear. Instead, that
rebellious group formed a counter
culture, actively protesting against

a society and political system it
viewed as problematic.
Our institution was one site of
this activity and also of the resulting
counter protests. No one had blown
the "Stanford bubble" yet, appar
ently.
Today, our community, our na
tion and our world are challenged
by the same issues that President
Kennedy labeled "the common ene
mies of man: tyranny, poverty, dis
ease and war itself." But, are we,
the new young people, responding
in the same motivated fashion?
In November 2008,1 would have
said, "Yes." Barack Obama had
seemed to reignite that torch. Dur
ing that election cycle, the Stanford
Democrats sent 130 students for an
Election Day canvass for Obama
in Nevada. The University was
aglow with activity across the polit
ical spectrum.
However, just two years later, as
The Stanford Daily itself reports,
that fervor is disappearing. Having
led President Obama's re-election
campaign on campus and served as
co-president of the Stanford De
mocrats for the last year, I can like
wise speak to the difficulties of en
gaging students in politics.
Throughout the election cycle, I
heard that President Obama is a
"letdown" or a "failure." Our peers
asked: "Why should I dedicate my
time to a man who hasn't done and
won't do anything?" Students, re
signed, drew away from politics.
I'm not here to defend the Pres
ident's record or insist that you sup
port him. I am, however, here to ar
gue that we cannot simply give up
on politics.
Whether we like it or not, politi
cal discourse at the local, state and
national level has a profound impact
on our daily lives. From Palo Alto's
ban on homelessness to immigra
tion reform, Stanford is not as bub
ble wrapped as we like to think.
The world can see into the Stanford
bubble, even if we choose not to
look out of it.
We cannot simply hunker down
and lament political polarization.
We cannot simply blame septuage
narians in Congress for bad policy.
Returning to JFK's speech,
Kennedy reminds us: "In your

hands, my fellow citizens, more
than mine, will rest the final success
or failure of our course.
"Since this country was founded,
each generation of Americans has
been summoned to give testimony
to its national loyalty," JFK said
that day. Stanfordians have consis
tently responded to this call, from
Herbert Hoover and President
Kennedy himself (although he did
drop out) to Ted Koppel and John
Steinbeck. Beyond these traditional
fields, one can easily find a myriad
of Stanfordians whose work on the
nation's behalf has benefited us all.
Indeed, Vint Cerf, who spoke here
recently, helped develop the founda
tion of the Internet under the aus
pices of the Department of Defense.
The question before you now is if
and how you will continue their
legacy.
While the options number too
many to list here, I challenge you to
think about how you can pop your
own Stanford bubble. Perhaps that
means getting involved in one of
Stanford's multiple East Palo Alto
tutoring organizations or coming to
a Stanford Democrats or Stanford
Conservative Society event. Maybe
you want to develop apps with
FWD.US, Mark Zuckerberg's im
migration reform lobby, or work to
ward curing disease with the Na
tional Institute of Health. I could
continue ad nauseam.
If it wants us to leave the Farm
as prepared citizens, the university,
for its part, should do more to en
courage this discourse. It should re
duce regulations on free speech and
encourage our civic engagement.
But until we will demonstrate that
we are a politically active and aware
campus, the administration is un
likely to do so.
In keeping with last week's col
umn, I'd like to conclude with a
challenge. Tonight is President
Obama's sixth State of the Union.
Tune in on your dorm TV As you
consider the challenges our nation
faces, consider how you might bring
your skills to bear on them.
"The trumpet summons us
again." Will you listen?
