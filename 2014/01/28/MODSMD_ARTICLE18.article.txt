## Pete Hansen replaces Kotulski as inside linebackers coach 
### â€” Sam Fisher 
Stanford hired San Fran
cisco 49ers defensive assis
tant Pete Hansen as inside
linebackers coach Monday
morning. Hansen will replace
David Kotulski, who left the
Cardinal last week to become
Derek Mason's defensive co
ordinator at Vanderbilt.
Hansen joined the 49ers
shortly after head coach Jim
Harbaugh left Stanford to
become head coach of the
49ers. Hansen had worked
for Harbaugh and later de
fensive coordinator Vic Fan
gio in two seasons at Stan
ford as a defensive assistant.
"Pete comes to us at a
young age but with a tremen
dous wealth of knowledge,"
said Cardinal head coach
David Shaw. "In the last
three years, he's worked with
one of the best defenses in
the NFL and worked with
some of the best linebackers
in the NFL. His perspective
and energy will help our
front seven."
Hansen is a Palo Alto
High School alumnus. Pete's
dad, Earl, recently retired as

head coach of Palo Alto High
School's football team, where
he coached Pete, Jim Har
baugh and current Cardinal

verbal commit Keller Chryst.
Hansen worked as an assis
tant to his dad for four sea
sons after playing profes
sional football and basketball
in Europe.
Hansen was a two-sport
varsity athlete at Arizona. On
the gridiron, Hansen was a
standout on special teams,
earning second-team All-Pac
-10 recognition. As an assis
tant, he has spent most of his
time on the defensive side of
the ball, where he will look to
bring lessons learned from
Fangio back to the Farm.
Stanford still has one full
time defensive assistant
coaching spot to fill, with the
departures of Mason and Ko
tulski to Vanderbilt and the
addition of Hansen. Due to
the expertise of new defensive
coordinator Lance Anderson
coaching outside linebackers,
that assistant will probably be
a secondary coach. Mason
worked with the secondary
while he was the Cardinal's
defensive coordinator.
