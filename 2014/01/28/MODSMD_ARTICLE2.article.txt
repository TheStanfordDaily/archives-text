### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
Philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates will be the
2014 Commencement speakers, marking the first
time the podium at commencement will be shared by
two speakers.
This year's Commencement Weekend will also
feature FYed Turner, associate professor of communi
cation, giving the Class Day lecture, and poet and
Zen Buddhist priest Norman Fischer giving the Bac
calaureate address.
As founders and co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation, this year's speakers have worked
together in serving those in need on a global scale.
They also lead programs designed to tackle hunger
and poverty, advance science and technology to im
prove health in developing countries and improve
U.S. high school and postsecondary education.
Bill Gates who spoke at Cubberley Auditorium
two years ago about the importance of foreign aid and
philanthropy in tackling global challenges has di
rected the foundation's work to eradicate polio, be
coming a vocal advocate for immunization efforts.
Melinda Gates champions global access to family
planning information and services and promotes evi
dence-based policy and programs that empower
women and girls.
"Sharing a mutual commitment to a better world,
Bill and Melinda Gates have taken on some of the
planet's toughest challenges," said President John
Hennessy in a press release. "This boldness is an
ethos that we also embody at Stanford, and one we
seek to instill in our graduates."
The senior class presidents Dhruv Amin 'l4, Maya
Humes 'l4, Lawrence Neil 'l4 and Mary Raddawi 'l4
said that the Gates were the their first choice for
speakers.
"I think when you look at their body of work,

they've really transcended
business to a point where I
think you'd be hard pressed

to find who has done more
for humanity than those
two," Amin said.
Amin added that the
Gates' impatience to quickly
solve problems along with
their general optimism about
the nature of humanity are
useful qualities the graduat

ing seniors can emulate as
they head into the real world.
Remarking on how the
Gates will also be the first duo
to share the Commencement
speaker podium at Stanford,
Raddawi said choosing both
Bill and Melinda made sense,
given how a lot of their work

is a shared effort.
"None of the work that
they have done and the im
pact they have had could have
been done with just one of
them," Raddawi said.
As for the selections of
Thrner and Fischer, the sen
ior class presidents spoke of

how their work relates to
dealing with global contem
porary issues.
"For me, Professor Turn
er seems to be a hyper-rele
vant professor for the point
in which we're entering the
real world right now," Neil
said. "He pushes us to think

about how we interact with
technology, how we interact
with society in a new way."
The 123 rd Commence
ment Weekend is scheduled
for June 13 to 15.
