## Stanford designers treat clubfoot abroad 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
Every year, 150,000 children are
born with clubfoot, a debilitating
birth defect that causes an infant's
feet to turn inwards, crippling them
and making them seem as if they
are walking on their ankles.
While clubfoot can be treated in
most cases, the cm-rent solution in
volves a multiple-year process of
bearing heavy and uncomfortable
shoes attached to steel braces, pos
ing significant challenges to infants'
physical mobility all at a cost of
$7OO per pair.
Lan Connolly 'll M.S. 'l3 and
Jeffrey Yang Ph.D. 'l4 first encoun
tered this problem through the
Hassno Plattner Institute of De
sign (d.school), in a class called De
sign for Extreme Affordability. The
class allows students to work in
teams developing products and
services that serve the needs of the
world's poor. Through the class, the
duo partnered with Miraclefeet, a
non-profit organization that pro
vides low-cost clubfoot treatment in
the developing world.
In collaborating with the non
profit and doing fieldwork, Connol
ly and Yang designed and manufac
tured customized shoes that inter
face with light plastic braces to not
only allow children with clubfoot to

stand and walk while receiving
therapeutic treatment but also re
duce the mass-production manufac
turing cost from $7OO to less than
$2O dollars a pair.
"In our mind, this is the fastest
way to have real impact," Yang said.
"We're not really interested in
starting a business of our own. But
being able to create a device that
works and could be used in the field
is really important to us."
The drawing board
The duo's attraction to the proj
ect began when they first spoke
with Miraclefeet representatives in
2012.
"What makes this project
unique is that the benefit that you
are making is something that lasts
for a very long time," Connolly said.
"Physical mobility is very basic,
and every kid should have a
chance."
Prior to the partnership with
Connolly and Yang, Miraclefeet
mainly obtained low-cost braces by
recycling them from higher-end
customers or contacting local or
thopedic manufacturers to produce
them at low cost. Despite success
fully making clubfoot braces afford
able for poor families, the braces
themselves were poorly designed
