## Stanford designers treat clubfoot abroad 
### HELIN GAO DESK EDITOR 
Every year, 150,000 children are
born with clubfoot, a debilitating
birth defect that causes an infant's
feet to turn inwards, crippling them
and making them seem as if they
are walking on their ankles.
While clubfoot can be treated in
most cases, the cm-rent solution in
volves a multiple-year process of
bearing heavy and uncomfortable
shoes attached to steel braces, pos
ing significant challenges to infants'
physical mobility all at a cost of
$7OO per pair.
Lan Connolly 'll M.S. 'l3 and
Jeffrey Yang Ph.D. 'l4 first encoun
tered this problem through the
Hassno Plattner Institute of De
sign (d.school), in a class called De
sign for Extreme Affordability. The
class allows students to work in
teams developing products and
services that serve the needs of the
world's poor. Through the class, the
duo partnered with Miraclefeet, a
non-profit organization that pro
vides low-cost clubfoot treatment in
the developing world.
In collaborating with the non
profit and doing fieldwork, Connol
ly and Yang designed and manufac
tured customized shoes that inter
face with light plastic braces to not
only allow children with clubfoot to

stand and walk while receiving
therapeutic treatment but also re
duce the mass-production manufac
turing cost from $7OO to less than
$2O dollars a pair.
"In our mind, this is the fastest
way to have real impact," Yang said.
"We're not really interested in
starting a business of our own. But
being able to create a device that
works and could be used in the field
is really important to us."
The drawing board
The duo's attraction to the proj
ect began when they first spoke
with Miraclefeet representatives in
2012.
"What makes this project
unique is that the benefit that you
are making is something that lasts
for a very long time," Connolly said.
"Physical mobility is very basic,
and every kid should have a
chance."
Prior to the partnership with
Connolly and Yang, Miraclefeet
mainly obtained low-cost braces by
recycling them from higher-end
customers or contacting local or
thopedic manufacturers to produce
them at low cost. Despite success
fully making clubfoot braces afford
able for poor families, the braces
themselves were poorly designed

and barely functional.
It wasn't until the duo first
visited Brazil through their
d.school class, talking to par
ents, children and local clini
cal practitioners, when they
really started to understand
what the critical features of
the braces were.
"It really gives you a lot of
insight into why bracing is
such a struggle and the many
different places where things
become difficult and compli
ance can be compromised,"
Yang said.
According to Connolly and
Yang, the fieldwork that con
stitutes a need-finding
process helps them design
the products from the users'
perspective as opposed to
blindly applying theories
without practical foundations.
This process of understand
ing the needs of the world's
poor through ethnographic
fieldwork is part of d.school's
human-centered design
process.
Fieldwork also allowed
Connolly and Yang to build
empathy with the under
served population. Yang re
called a memorable en
counter during a home visit
in Brazil when a grandmoth
er had to keep propping up a
baby to on its side because
the infant, wearing heavy
braces, could not move on his
own.
"I think going on those
home visits made us realize
that we really need to make
something that is affordable

first and foremost because
people really don't have much
[to give]," Connolly said.

Manufacturing the product
Coming back from Brazil,
the duo sketched out a design
idea based on their observa
tions during the trip.
The real challenge lay in
turning those ideas into man
ufactured products. Fortu
nately, Connolly and Yang
were connected with Clarks
shoes and Suncast Corpora
tion, which helped them
arrange a deal to manufac
ture the braces.
"I think they have done a
terrific job at getting two big
firms... involved,' said James
Patell, professor at the Grad
uate School of Business, one
of the instructors of the
d.school course that stalled
the project.
Before it launches in
Brazil, India and South
Africa, the duo will confront
some challenges. One of them
is to raise awareness of club
foot treatment among people
in developing countries.
"In some of the clinics that
we've been to, I heard a
mother who tells me that her
child was born with clubfoot
at a hospital and no one told
her there was anything
wrong with her child," Yang
said. "Her sister looked at the
child and recognized that
there was something weird
about his feet."
With full-scale manufac
turing underway, the duo is
hoping to provide treatment
for 15,000 kids by the end of
the year.

are walking on their ankles.
While clubfoot can be treated in
most cases, the cm-rent solution in
volves a multiple-year process of
bearing heavy and uncomfortable
shoes attached to steel braces, pos
ing significant challenges to infants'
physical mobility all at a cost of
$7OO per pair.
Lan Connolly 'll M.S. 'l3 and
Jeffrey Yang Ph.D. 'l4 first encoun
tered this problem through the
Hassno Plattner Institute of De
sign (d.school), in a class called De
sign for Extreme Affordability. The
class allows students to work in
teams developing products and
services that serve the needs of the
world's poor. Through the class, the
duo partnered with Miraclefeet, a
non-profit organization that pro
vides low-cost clubfoot treatment in
the developing world.
In collaborating with the non
profit and doing fieldwork, Connol
ly and Yang designed and manufac
tured customized shoes that inter
face with light plastic braces to not
only allow children with clubfoot to

stand and walk while receiving
therapeutic treatment but also re
duce the mass-production manufac
turing cost from $7OO to less than
$2O dollars a pair.
"In our mind, this is the fastest
way to have real impact," Yang said.
"We're not really interested in
starting a business of our own. But
being able to create a device that
works and could be used in the field
is really important to us."
The drawing board
The duo's attraction to the proj
ect began when they first spoke
with Miraclefeet representatives in
2012.
"What makes this project
unique is that the benefit that you
are making is something that lasts
for a very long time," Connolly said.
"Physical mobility is very basic,
and every kid should have a
chance."
Prior to the partnership with
Connolly and Yang, Miraclefeet
mainly obtained low-cost braces by
recycling them from higher-end
customers or contacting local or
thopedic manufacturers to produce
them at low cost. Despite success
fully making clubfoot braces afford
able for poor families, the braces
themselves were poorly designed

and barely functional.
It wasn't until the duo first
visited Brazil through their
d.school class, talking to par
ents, children and local clini
cal practitioners, when they
really started to understand
what the critical features of
the braces were.
"It really gives you a lot of
insight into why bracing is
such a struggle and the many
different places where things
become difficult and compli
ance can be compromised,"
Yang said.
According to Connolly and
Yang, the fieldwork that con
stitutes a need-finding
process helps them design
the products from the users'
perspective as opposed to
blindly applying theories
without practical foundations.
This process of understand
ing the needs of the world's
poor through ethnographic
fieldwork is part of d.school's
human-centered design
process.
Fieldwork also allowed
Connolly and Yang to build
empathy with the under
served population. Yang re
called a memorable en
counter during a home visit
in Brazil when a grandmoth
er had to keep propping up a
baby to on its side because
the infant, wearing heavy
braces, could not move on his
own.
"I think going on those
home visits made us realize
that we really need to make
something that is affordable

first and foremost because
people really don't have much
[to give]," Connolly said.

Manufacturing the product
Coming back from Brazil,
the duo sketched out a design
idea based on their observa
tions during the trip.
The real challenge lay in
turning those ideas into man
ufactured products. Fortu
nately, Connolly and Yang
were connected with Clarks
shoes and Suncast Corpora
tion, which helped them
arrange a deal to manufac
ture the braces.
"I think they have done a
terrific job at getting two big
firms... involved,' said James
Patell, professor at the Grad
uate School of Business, one
of the instructors of the
d.school course that stalled
the project.
Before it launches in
Brazil, India and South
Africa, the duo will confront
some challenges. One of them
is to raise awareness of club
foot treatment among people
in developing countries.
"In some of the clinics that
we've been to, I heard a
mother who tells me that her
child was born with clubfoot
at a hospital and no one told
her there was anything
wrong with her child," Yang
said. "Her sister looked at the
child and recognized that
there was something weird
about his feet."
With full-scale manufac
turing underway, the duo is
hoping to provide treatment
for 15,000 kids by the end of
the year.

Every year, 150,000 children are
born with clubfoot, a debilitating
birth defect that causes an infant's
feet to turn inwards, crippling them
and making them seem as if they
