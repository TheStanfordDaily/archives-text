## Student-organized shelter debuts 
### CLARISSE PERALTA STAFF WRITER 
Heart and Home Collaborative, a
nonprofit organization established
by Stanford students, opened its
first women's shelter Sunday night.
Currently hosted at Peninsula
Bible Church and University
Lutheran Church, the shelter will
be hosting up to 15 homeless women
in Palo Alto.

The women who are staying at
the shelter were chosen through a
lottery system and can be accommo
dated up until April, according to
Baljinnyam Dashdorj 'l2, volunteer
coordinator.
The shelter is seasonal, he ex
plained, because the non-profit does
n't have the funds or space to be a
yearlong shelter yet. The student
organizers chose to host the shelter
during winter due to cold tempera-

tures.
According to a survey that Heart
and Home had conducted last year,
at the time, there were about 150
homeless people in Palo Alto and on
ly 12 of them had adequate shelter.
"If we only had the resources,
we'd love to open something for
everybody year-round. But as of the
moment, our funding only allows us
to be open seasonally," Dash
dorj said.

Past experience
Although this is the first
year that Heart and Home as
an organization is opening a
shelter, the students who
founded the nonprofit were
volunteers at a previous shel
ter called Hotel de Zink,
which was open from Jan. 15
to April 15, 2012.
Similarly, Hotel de Zink
was hosted in community
churches and offered shelter,
case management and stor
age for 15 homeless women.
The shelter formed as a part
nership between student vol
unteers and Inn Vision Shel
ter Network, a community
organization that provides
shelter services throughout
the Bay Area.
After the shelter's initial
run, the student volunteers of
Hotel de Zink decided that
they wanted more flexibility
to explore their own mission
apart from Inn Vision, accord
ing to Aparna Ananthasubra
maniam 'l3 M.S. 'l4, staff di
rector and resources coordi
nator for the new student
nonprofit.
The students wanted to
focus the shelter on serving
the needs of the women they
hosted more than any other
purpose.
"[Our] main principle is
that we're client centered.
The people who use our serv
ices are the experts," said
Trey Deitch 'l5, resident ad

vocate and outreach coordi
nator.
Given this mission, the
students needed independ
ence from the University as
well.
"We're not a Stanford or
ganization helping Stanford
students," Deitch said.
"When we organized
fundraisers and gave servic
es to those outside of the
community, there were a lot
of restrictions."

Becoming an independent
organization
The former Hotel de Zink
volunteers have spent the
past couple of years laying
the groundwork for them own
registered, independent non
profit, deciding that they
would be able to better serve

the community that way.
This organization would
eventually be known as
Heart and Home Collabora
tive.
The volunteers admitted
the transition from student
group to nonprofit was not an
easy one.
"It was difficult in terms
of paperwork we had to
buy insurance, follow Califor
nia's applicable laws and
stuff, to operate as a nonprof
it," said Ananthasubramani
am, who was involved with
much of the process.
"I always joke that every
time I think I'm done with
the paperwork, there are
three more forms that I need
to fill out," she said. "But it
was a learning experience
and we had [pro-bono] pro

fessional guidance."
She also acknowledged
that she learned a lot from
her past experience working
with Inn Vision.
"Working with a nonprofit
that has been doing this for
so many decades was really
valuable for us in terms of
how a shelter operates on a
day-to-day basis," she said.
Part of the process of be
coming a nonprofit was ob
taining the funding to hire
staff and for insurance. Ac
cording to Dashdoij, most of
the organization's funding
comes from personal dona
tions, small fundraisers and a
few grants from companies
such as Zip Car, which had
provided them $5,000 in
transportation to help transit
volunteers or women.
And the hard work paid
off.
On Sunday night, when
the shelter officially debuted,
many volunteers returned to
celebrate the opening.
Heart and Home Collabo
rative plans to hold more in
formation sessions to attract
more student volunteers and
to work with other on-cam
pus organizations. According
to Dashdorj, Heart and
Home Collaborative was able
to establish a partnership
with Residential and Dining
Enterprises for food and sil
verware donations for the
shelter.

Additionally, the volun
teers are working on collabo
ration with Chi Omega and
are planning to hold a
fundraising event with them
in the near future.
