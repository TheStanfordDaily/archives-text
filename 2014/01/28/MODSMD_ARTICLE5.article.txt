### CALEB SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett-
Packard (HP), spoke at an associ
ates meeting of the Stanford Insti
tute for Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR) on Monday evening, in
front of a nearly full Koret-Taube
Conference Room at the Gunn-
SIEPR Building.
Whitman fielded questions on a
wide variety of subjects ranging
from the future of HP to the issue
of immigration reform.
Claiming that it was important
for companies to "pivot" to tomor
row's markets, Whitman predicted
that some profitable companies will
shrink due to major changes occur
ring in the technology industry.
Whitman also stressed the need
for more, larger data centers, ex
pressing concerns about the space,
cost and energy demands of cur
rent servers. Whitman said that
barring action, servers could take
up 30 percent of world electricity
demand by the end of the decade.
One audience member asked
Whitman if HP was still a relevant
company. Whitman noted chal

a good reputation to attract talent

said. When asked about the
benefits and challenges of
scale, Whitman claimed that
HP benefited from scale but
noted that "you have to be a
bureaucracy buster every
single day."
Although many ques
tions related directly to
HP's operations, some ques
tions were about other mat
ters, including the state of
patent law in the United
States. Whitman expressed
dissatisfaction with the cur
rent system and said that
the Patent and Trademark
Office has failed to ade
quately modernize.
Whitman also expressed
dismay with the current im
migration system and stated
her belief that foreign stu
dents who earn Ph.D.'s in
science, technology and en
gineering fields should auto
matically receive a green
card, which would allow
such students to become U.
S. permanent residents.
Whitman's talk im
pressed at least some mem
bers of her audience.
