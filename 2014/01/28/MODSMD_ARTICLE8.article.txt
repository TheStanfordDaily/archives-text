## Making sense of the Pac-12 parity 
### Ashley Westhem 
Now that college foot
ball is over and done
with, it's become in
evitable that I turn
my attention to my
absolute favorite sport: women's bas
ketball.
Men's basketball is great too, I
guess, but the Card has been too in
consistent for me to give them much
attention. Besides, Pac-12 women's
basketball is really good and, as I'm
about to explain, really unpredictable
—which just makes it that much
more fun to watch.
Looking back at the Pac-12 coach
es' preseason poll, you'd think they
got confused about how rankings
worked and accidentally placed the
top teams on the bottom and vice ver
sa. Seeing the current standings, it's
clear that the poll has been practical
ly inverted. But that's what I love
about college sports. Anyone can win
on any given day—that's why you
play the game, and that's why not
much weight should be given to these
preseason polls.
First off, if someone had told me
that when USC travelled to Stanford,
it would be for a game that would de
termine who sits atop the Pac-12, I
wouldn't have believed her. That kind
of game was supposed to happen this
Thursday when Cal travels to
Maples, not last night against the
Trojans and yet that's how this
season has unraveled.

The Pac-12 has proven to be a
strong conference in women's basket
ball in the past two years, as opposed
to seasons in the past when it was just
Stanford at the top and then a huge
drop off in talent to second place. This
year, though, unlikely teams are pro
viding the Pac-12 with added depth.
The Trojans were predicted to fin
ish sixth in the conference, right in
the middle of the Pac-12. Today
though they sit in second with a Pac
-12 record of 7-2. After not receiving
an NCAA tournament bid for the
past seven seasons, it was likely that
USC would eventually rise to the top,
because most programs go through
cycles of greatness.
The Trojans have been a pleasant
surprise this season and even pulled off
a big win against Cal on Friday to move
them into second place and garner
some attention for the program and
all this under a first-year head coach.
It seems they flip flopped with
UCLA, which was the dominant team
in Los Angeles last year but is strug
gling to close out tight games this sea
son and is allowing other teams to snag
narrow wins. After making it to the
second round of the NCAA tourna
ment for the past two years, the Bruins
might not even make it this year.
At this point in the season, USC
has been doing so well that its win
over Cal did more to ruin Cal's stand
ing than boost that of the Trojans. Cal
is coming off of its best season in pro
gram history after winning a share of
its first Pac-12 conference crown and
making it to the Final Four for the
first time ever, but it seems like it's
falling victim to the same cycle that
has brought USC to the top. Cal has
had some eyebrow-raising losses
to USC and Arizona State and
narrow wins over lowly Colorado
(which was actually supposed to fin
ish third in the conference) and Ore
gon (one of the few teams to actually
be playing according to its last place
preseason placement).
While Cal and Colorado have not
been playing up to their preseason
potential, Arizona State and Wash
ington State have been doing surpris
ingly well. It's actually shocking that
WSU had an undefeated 5-0 start.
However, losing point guard Lia
Galdeira for the past few games has
proven to be its Achilles' heel, and
WSU won't be able to continue its
strong play without her.
ASU, not given even a slight nod
in the preseason poll, has been
ranked in the top 25 nationally for
five consecutive weeks and sits at
third in the conference. Granted, the
Card devastated the Sun Devils on
its home court last week, but that's
not to say that ASU isn't a good, sol
id team Stanford is just that good
this year.
So now that we've looked at some
of the disappointments and surprises
thus far in the Pac-12, we can turn to
the one team that has lived up to its
ranking and then some: Stanford.

Anyone can win
on any given day
that's why you
play the game.
Duh.
The depth, all-around tal
ent and consistency of this
year's team is night and day
compared to last year's. Last
year's team was good, but it
was essentially all then-junior
Chiney Ogwumike and very
little support. This year, al
though Ogwumike continues
to dominate, averaging 27
points per game and 12 re
bounds per game, she has a
strong cast of starters and
bench players who are con
tributing greatly to Stanford's
success.
It seems that no one else in
the conference is a legitimate
threat to Stanford's suprema
cy in the Pac-12, despite the
conference's strength. The on
ly thing that could possibly
stand in Stanford's way of re
turning to the Final Four after
last year's absence is Stanford.

this year.
So now that we've looked at some
of the disappointments and surprises
thus far in the Pac-12, we can turn to
the one team that has lived up to its
ranking and then some: Stanford.

Anyone can win
on any given day
that's why you
play the game.
Duh.
The depth, all-around tal
ent and consistency of this
year's team is night and day
compared to last year's. Last
year's team was good, but it
was essentially all then-junior
Chiney Ogwumike and very
little support. This year, al
though Ogwumike continues
to dominate, averaging 27
points per game and 12 re
bounds per game, she has a
strong cast of starters and
bench players who are con
tributing greatly to Stanford's
success.
It seems that no one else in
the conference is a legitimate
threat to Stanford's suprema
cy in the Pac-12, despite the
conference's strength. The on
ly thing that could possibly
stand in Stanford's way of re
turning to the Final Four after
last year's absence is Stanford.

Now that college foot
ball is over and done
with, it's become in
evitable that I turn
my attention to my
absolute favorite sport: women's bas
ketball.
Men's basketball is great too, I
guess, but the Card has been too in
consistent for me to give them much
attention. Besides, Pac-12 women's
basketball is really good and, as I'm
about to explain, really unpredictable
—which just makes it that much
more fun to watch.
Looking back at the Pac-12 coach
es' preseason poll, you'd think they
got confused about how rankings
worked and accidentally placed the
top teams on the bottom and vice ver
sa. Seeing the current standings, it's
clear that the poll has been practical
ly inverted. But that's what I love
about college sports. Anyone can win
on any given day—that's why you
play the game, and that's why not
much weight should be given to these
preseason polls.
First off, if someone had told me
that when USC travelled to Stanford,
it would be for a game that would de
termine who sits atop the Pac-12, I
wouldn't have believed her. That kind
of game was supposed to happen this
Thursday when Cal travels to
Maples, not last night against the
Trojans and yet that's how this
season has unraveled.

The Pac-12 has proven to be a
strong conference in women's basket
ball in the past two years, as opposed
to seasons in the past when it was just
Stanford at the top and then a huge
drop off in talent to second place. This
year, though, unlikely teams are pro
viding the Pac-12 with added depth.
The Trojans were predicted to fin
ish sixth in the conference, right in
the middle of the Pac-12. Today
though they sit in second with a Pac
-12 record of 7-2. After not receiving
an NCAA tournament bid for the
past seven seasons, it was likely that
USC would eventually rise to the top,
because most programs go through
cycles of greatness.
The Trojans have been a pleasant
surprise this season and even pulled off
a big win against Cal on Friday to move
them into second place and garner
some attention for the program and
all this under a first-year head coach.
It seems they flip flopped with
UCLA, which was the dominant team
in Los Angeles last year but is strug
gling to close out tight games this sea
son and is allowing other teams to snag
narrow wins. After making it to the
second round of the NCAA tourna
ment for the past two years, the Bruins
might not even make it this year.
At this point in the season, USC
has been doing so well that its win
over Cal did more to ruin Cal's stand
ing than boost that of the Trojans. Cal
is coming off of its best season in pro
gram history after winning a share of
its first Pac-12 conference crown and
making it to the Final Four for the
first time ever, but it seems like it's
falling victim to the same cycle that
has brought USC to the top. Cal has
had some eyebrow-raising losses
to USC and Arizona State and
narrow wins over lowly Colorado
(which was actually supposed to fin
ish third in the conference) and Ore
gon (one of the few teams to actually
be playing according to its last place
preseason placement).
While Cal and Colorado have not
been playing up to their preseason
potential, Arizona State and Wash
ington State have been doing surpris
ingly well. It's actually shocking that
WSU had an undefeated 5-0 start.
However, losing point guard Lia
Galdeira for the past few games has
proven to be its Achilles' heel, and
WSU won't be able to continue its
strong play without her.
ASU, not given even a slight nod
in the preseason poll, has been
ranked in the top 25 nationally for
five consecutive weeks and sits at
third in the conference. Granted, the
Card devastated the Sun Devils on
its home court last week, but that's
not to say that ASU isn't a good, sol
id team Stanford is just that good
this year.
