# CARD ROUTS USC
## Stanford tightens grip on conference lead 
### LAUREN LOCKETT 
With ESPN in the house to call
its nationally televised contest,
Stanford women's basketball (19-
1, 8-0 Pac-12) cruised to its 18th
consecutive victory on Monday
night. The Card defeated the USC
Trojans (14-7, 7-2) at Maples Pavil
ion by a score of 86-59 in an impor
tant game for positioning within
the Pac-12 conference.
The Women of Troy came into
the game ranked second in the
Pac-12, half of a game behind the
Cardinal. Though the matchup
was billed as an intense matchup
between the conference's leading
teams, Stanford passed the test
with flying colors.

Head coach Tara VanDerveer
rolled out the same starting five
that the team has been using for
the latter portion of the season to
open the gameâ€”junior point
guard Amber Orrange, freshman
guard Lili Thompson, senior
guard Sara James, fifth-year sen
ior forward Mikaela Ruef and sen
ior forward Chiney Ogwumike all
started for the Cardinal. As it has
been for the past few weeks, the
starting five was firing on all cylin
ders together on Monday night. In
fact, both teams opened the game
with strong shooting performanc
es, as Stanford and USC each con
verted on seven of its first 10
shots, which kept the game close
early on.
Midway through the first half,
however, USC suffered a long cold
spell that it was not able to recov
er from. In turn, the Cardinal be
gan to pull away at the nine
minute mark of the first half by

converting on easy close-range
shots and open threes. In addition,
Stanford was able to get the ball in
the lane seemingly at will. The
guards' great penetration and en
try passes allowed for layups and
easy shots in the post.
Due in large part to this easy
scoring, the Cardinal hit a scorch
ing 55 percent of its field goals in
the opening half of play. Ogwumike
dominated the first half with 17
points, most of which were easy
lay-ins around the goal. She fin
ished the game with 30 points and
12 rebounds for her 15th double
double of the season. Ruef also had
a solid first half, posting nine

points. At some points in the game,
everything seemed to be falling for
the Card. Ruef even sunk a long 3-
pointer to beat the shot clock with
1:05 left in the first half.
Stanford's ability to keep
USC's star forward and reigning
Pac-12 Player of the Week Cassie
Harberts in check throughout the
game was probably most instru
mental in fueling Monday's
blowout. The Cardinal defense,
which leads the Pac-12 in points al
lowed per game (59.6), held Har
berts to only five points in the en
tire first half. Early in the game,
every time she touched the ball in
the post, a swarm of white jerseys

surrounded and befuddled her.
Harberts ended the game with 17
points and six rebounds.
Stanford carried an 18-point
lead into the halftime break that
the Trojans were not able to cut in
to for the rest of the game. The sec
ond half was more of the same song
for both teams. The Cardinal con
tinued to get the ball down low and
either score easy baskets or flip it
out to the perimeter for open
threes. Thompson and fellow fresh
man guard Karlie Samuelson each
splashed two 3-pointers and added
12 and 10 points, respectively, in the

Card's effort.
For the Women of Troy,
point guard Ariya Crook was
able to use her quickness to
get into the lane and led
USC's charge with 18 points.
Forward Kaneisha Horn also
contributed nine points.
Overall, the Cardinal
thoroughly dominated the
team that was a close sec
ond in the conference on
both ends of the court. If
USC represents the tough
est test that the Pac-12 has
to offer, it may be smooth
sailing for the Cardinal for
the remainder of the regu
lar season.
The Cardinal will wel
come its archrival from
across the Bay, the California
Golden Bears, on Thursday
as it seeks to maintain its
perfect Pac-12 record. The
No. 21 Bears (14-5, 6-2 Pac
-12), who have already lost to
USC this year, will come to
Maples Pavilion tied for third
place in the Pac-12 confer
ence with No. 15 Arizona
State.
