## LUPIN: THE HISTORY OF STAN FORD-ARIZONA 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
When the Stanford men's
basketball team hosts the top
ranked and undefeated Ari
zona Wildcats tonight at 6
p.m. at Maples Pavilion, the
Cardinal (13-6, 4-3 Pac-12)
will do all it can to make life
difficult for the heavily fa
vored Wildcats (20-0, 7-0),
who enter the matchup riding
the longest win streak in
school history.
To understand the gravity
of a game in which Arizona
will put its school-best win
streak on the line, some back
ground on both the history of
the Stanford-Zona matchup,
and on a more personal level,
my attachment to the rivalry
as a lifelong Stanford basket
ball fan, is in order.
For those who are perhaps
a bit unfamiliar with the bas
ketball history between these
two schools, a quick refresher
might be useful.
Between 1998 and 2005,
Stanford and Arizona were
the dominant basketball pow
ers on the West Coast. During
the formative years of my
basketball fandom, back
when the floor at Maples visi
bly bounced at the mercy of
the stomping Sixth Man Club,
the Cardinal and the Wildcats
combined to win seven of
eight Pac-10 titles. The only
year one of these two teams
didn't win the conference

championship, 2002, they tied
for second.
The two schools combined
to finish first and second to
gether in the conference
standings six times during
that stretch, with the only ex
ceptions coming during the
aforementioned 2002 season,
and 2005, when Stanford tied
for third.
In other words, Stanford
was a basketballschool, and
Stanford-Arizona was the
yearly climax of the Pae-10
basketball season. The games
between the two teams often
decided the outcome of the
conference race, and from
2001 until a certain game in
2004 a stretch of six
straight contests the road
team peculiarly won every
matchup in the series.
Stanford basketball had
reached its pinnacle during
the 2003-04 season, when the
team put its 19-game win
streak and No. 2 national
ranking on the line to host No.
12 Arizona. What ensued on
Feb. 7, 2004 was a back-and
forth affair that is hard to de
scribe, and is now probably
best experienced by search
ing "Stanford Arizona 2004"
on You Tube.
There was a dramatic
Stanford rally in the final

Maples Pavilion exploded,
the Stanford winning streak
would continue and the Car
dinal would end the confer
ence season as Pac-10 cham
pions, much to the delirious
delight of this then-11-year
old.
Shortly thereafter, how
ever, the precipitous decline

of Stanford basketball be
gan. The Cardinal was upset
in the second round of the
tournament by Alabama in a
dubiously officiated game,
head coach Mike Mont
gomery left for the NBA,
the Maples floor was "fixed"
and Stanford's streak of 11
consecutive NCAA tourna
ment appearances came to
an end in 2006. Aside from
the Lopez-led run to the
Sweet Sixteen in 2008, Stan
ford basketball has failed to
return to the previously
lofty heights set during that
eight-year span. My 11-
year-old self would have
been crestfallen to learn
that this was the future that
would befall my beloved
Cardinal.

So it seems only fitting
that if the much-belea
guered Johnny Dawkins era
of Stanford basketball is
ever going to have a turn
around, tonight would be the
place to start, a week shy of
the 10-year anniversary of
Robinson's heroics.
Stanford's senior class is
talented and likable, if at
times mercurial and incon
sistent. The Cardinal fea
tures a junior guard in
Chasson Randle, who, bar
ring injury, is going to finish
his career as one of the top
three scorers in school histo
ry. And as good as they are,
you'd be hard-pressed to find
anyone who thinks the Wild
cats can keep their win
streak going all season.

As I sit up in the press
box tonight to take in the
game, I will attempt to main
tain 'neutrality,' as any 'pro
fessional' sports writer
should. I will not participate
in the chants of the student
section, I will not cheer or
clap. I will not yell at the refs
for a bad call.
But if you think that I
won't be rocking my vintage
Casey Jacobsen jersey under
my shirt, or that I won't be
praying to the basketball
gods during every single free
throw, you'd be sadly mistak
en. The 11-year-old in me
lives on. Let's bring back the
magic to Maples.

ence season as Pac-10 cham
pions, much to the delirious
delight of this then-11-year
old.
Shortly thereafter, how
ever, the precipitous decline

of Stanford basketball be
gan. The Cardinal was upset
in the second round of the
tournament by Alabama in a
dubiously officiated game,
head coach Mike Mont
gomery left for the NBA,
the Maples floor was "fixed"
and Stanford's streak of 11
consecutive NCAA tourna
ment appearances came to
an end in 2006. Aside from
the Lopez-led run to the
Sweet Sixteen in 2008, Stan
ford basketball has failed to
return to the previously
lofty heights set during that
eight-year span. My 11-
year-old self would have
been crestfallen to learn
that this was the future that
would befall my beloved
Cardinal.

So it seems only fitting
that if the much-belea
guered Johnny Dawkins era
of Stanford basketball is
ever going to have a turn
around, tonight would be the
place to start, a week shy of
the 10-year anniversary of
Robinson's heroics.
Stanford's senior class is
talented and likable, if at
times mercurial and incon
sistent. The Cardinal fea
tures a junior guard in
Chasson Randle, who, bar
ring injury, is going to finish
his career as one of the top
three scorers in school histo
ry. And as good as they are,
you'd be hard-pressed to find
anyone who thinks the Wild
cats can keep their win
streak going all season.

As I sit up in the press
box tonight to take in the
game, I will attempt to main
tain 'neutrality,' as any 'pro
fessional' sports writer
should. I will not participate
in the chants of the student
section, I will not cheer or
clap. I will not yell at the refs
for a bad call.
But if you think that I
won't be rocking my vintage
Casey Jacobsen jersey under
my shirt, or that I won't be
praying to the basketball
gods during every single free
throw, you'd be sadly mistak
en. The 11-year-old in me
lives on. Let's bring back the
magic to Maples.

When the Stanford men's
basketball team hosts the top
ranked and undefeated Ari
zona Wildcats tonight at 6
p.m. at Maples Pavilion, the
Cardinal (13-6, 4-3 Pac-12)
will do all it can to make life
difficult for the heavily fa
vored Wildcats (20-0, 7-0),
who enter the matchup riding
the longest win streak in
school history.
To understand the gravity
of a game in which Arizona
will put its school-best win
streak on the line, some back
ground on both the history of
the Stanford-Zona matchup,
and on a more personal level,
my attachment to the rivalry
as a lifelong Stanford basket
ball fan, is in order.
For those who are perhaps
a bit unfamiliar with the bas
ketball history between these
two schools, a quick refresher
might be useful.
Between 1998 and 2005,
Stanford and Arizona were
the dominant basketball pow
ers on the West Coast. During
the formative years of my
basketball fandom, back
when the floor at Maples visi
bly bounced at the mercy of
the stomping Sixth Man Club,
the Cardinal and the Wildcats
combined to win seven of
eight Pac-10 titles. The only
year one of these two teams
didn't win the conference

championship, 2002, they tied
for second.
The two schools combined
to finish first and second to
gether in the conference
standings six times during
that stretch, with the only ex
ceptions coming during the
aforementioned 2002 season,
and 2005, when Stanford tied
for third.
In other words, Stanford
was a basketballschool, and
Stanford-Arizona was the
yearly climax of the Pae-10
basketball season. The games
between the two teams often
decided the outcome of the
conference race, and from
2001 until a certain game in
2004 a stretch of six
straight contests the road
team peculiarly won every
matchup in the series.
Stanford basketball had
reached its pinnacle during
the 2003-04 season, when the
team put its 19-game win
streak and No. 2 national
ranking on the line to host No.
