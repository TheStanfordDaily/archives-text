## LUPIN: THE HISTORY OF STAN FORD-ARIZONA 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
When the Stanford men's
basketball team hosts the top
ranked and undefeated Ari
zona Wildcats tonight at 6
p.m. at Maples Pavilion, the
Cardinal (13-6, 4-3 Pac-12)
will do all it can to make life
difficult for the heavily fa
vored Wildcats (20-0, 7-0),
who enter the matchup riding
the longest win streak in
school history.
To understand the gravity
of a game in which Arizona
will put its school-best win
streak on the line, some back
ground on both the history of
the Stanford-Zona matchup,
and on a more personal level,
my attachment to the rivalry
as a lifelong Stanford basket
ball fan, is in order.
For those who are perhaps
a bit unfamiliar with the bas
ketball history between these
two schools, a quick refresher
might be useful.
Between 1998 and 2005,
Stanford and Arizona were
the dominant basketball pow
ers on the West Coast. During
the formative years of my
basketball fandom, back
when the floor at Maples visi
bly bounced at the mercy of
the stomping Sixth Man Club,
the Cardinal and the Wildcats
combined to win seven of
eight Pac-10 titles. The only
year one of these two teams
didn't win the conference

championship, 2002, they tied
for second.
The two schools combined
to finish first and second to
gether in the conference
standings six times during
that stretch, with the only ex
ceptions coming during the
aforementioned 2002 season,
and 2005, when Stanford tied
for third.
In other words, Stanford
was a basketballschool, and
Stanford-Arizona was the
yearly climax of the Pae-10
basketball season. The games
between the two teams often
decided the outcome of the
conference race, and from
2001 until a certain game in
2004 a stretch of six
straight contests the road
team peculiarly won every
matchup in the series.
Stanford basketball had
reached its pinnacle during
the 2003-04 season, when the
team put its 19-game win
streak and No. 2 national
ranking on the line to host No.
12 Arizona. What ensued on
Feb. 7, 2004 was a back-and
forth affair that is hard to de
scribe, and is now probably
best experienced by search
ing "Stanford Arizona 2004"
on You Tube.
There was a dramatic
Stanford rally in the final
minute of the game, complete
