The No. 1 ranked Stanford
women's tennis team opened its
regular season dual-match slate
with decisive back-to-back
shutout victories this past week,
beating UC-Davis 7-0 on Friday
and No. 69 Princeton 7-0 on
Tuesday at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.

The Cardinal (2-0) collected
its 900 th victory in program his
tory against the Aggies (1-1).
The Cardinal started strong
when it took the doubles point to
start the day 1-0 on Friday. In
the No. 1 spot, the No. 15 duo of
senior Kristie Ahn and fresh
man Carol Zhao cruised past
UC-Davis's Nicole Koehly and
Layla Sanders 6-0. The No. 16
team of freshman Taylor David
son and junior Ellen Tsay, in ad
dition to the tandem of freshman
Caroline Doyle and sophomore
Krista Hardebeek, each took
home wins of their own.
In the course of three dou
bles matches, Stanford lost only
three games total, which set the
tone for the following six singles
matches.
On the singles side, the Car
dinal with five nationally
ranked players, including the
sixth-ranked Ahn maintained
its dominance against the un
ranked Aggies, dropping just
eight games in total and winning
each match in straight sets.

with a 6-0, 6-0 win against
Davis's Kamia Kecki, and she

the match with a 6-3, 6-0 at
No. 1 singles.

represented the regular-sea
son debuts for Doyle and

On Tuesday, the Cardinal
continued its dominance and
cruised through its matches
against No. 69 Princeton (1-

1) at home, winning 7-0 once
again.
Princeton was coming off
of a 6-1 win against Temple in
its own dual-match opener
last week, but the momen
tum was not enough to hold
off the surging Cardinal.

her sophomore season and

winning its three doubles
matches over the Tigers
and taking the doubles
point before steamrolling
on the singles side. Stan

match with No. 94 Tsay's
6-0, 6-3 win against Prince
ton's only ranked singles
