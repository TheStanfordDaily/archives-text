# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## WRAPPING UP 2013 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
The following is the final
Wednesday Roundtable for Vol.
£U of The Stanford Daily. The
2013-14. football season had
some remarkable highs like
the home :win against Oregon
and the Pac-12 title and
three crushing defeats. We
asked football writers Winston
Shi, David Cohn and Do-Hy
oung Park: What was your fa
vorite moment from the sea
son?

Winston: The high point of the
season had to be winning the Pac
-12 championship. Stanford has
won 14 conference titles, and, in
just three years, head coach David
Shaw's teams have captured two
of them. Winning the Pac-12 for
the second year in a row makes it
absolutely clear that the Cardinal
is the class of the West. There
were two brutal hiccups in confer

ence play, but Stanford stepped up
against its biggest contenders: It
absolutely put the wood to Ore
gon, humiliated Arizona State
twice, shut down UCLA's explo
sive offense and did I mention
Oregon?

Stanford killed a dragon on
Nov. 7, to be sure. It may seem
like small praise to call the Oregon
game the most lopsided one-score
victory I've ever seen, but from
that point the bruised and bat
tered Ducks were no longer invin
cible. For a Ducks program that so
thrived on its reputation of glam

orous devastation, Stanford's vic
tories certainly hurt. But for Stan
ford, Oregon was but a step to
ward the goal. The Cardinal is
about more than beating Oregon.
I said before the Oregon game
that Stanford's season was not go
ing to be defined by one evening,
and even with a great victory in
hindsight, I will not backtrack on
what I have said. If we will honor
the principle that great teams
count silverware and not big wins,
Stanford's Pac-12 championship is
undoubtedly the true gem of the
2013 season. Big games have hap
pened and will happen again, but
trophies never disappear.
It's indeed trophies that Stan
ford's players ultimately seek,
and, in that regard, David Shaw
has absolutely delivered. Some
people thought that Stanford
could go down the drain after Jim
Harbaugh left. Harbaugh is a tru
ly elite coach, but Shaw has now

twice accomplished something
Harbaugh never did. With a re
vived fan base, brand new facilities,
continued recruiting success and of
course a burgeoning win total,
Stanford is in a far better place
than it was when Shaw took over.

David: While I certainly respect
and understand Winston's selection
of the Pac-12 Championship Game
victory over Arizona State (I, in
fact, selected that title game victo
ry as the third-best moment of 2013
for Stanford Athletics), for the sake
of highlighting another fantastic
football moment, I will choose to
talk about the Nov. 7 game against
Oregon.
That night will forever live in
Stanford lore for a multitude of
reasons, but as an upperclassman,
the win over the Ducks was so in
credibly special in large part be
cause of what I had witnessed in
2011 during Oregon's last trip to
the Farm. That 2011 contest was
a nightmare almost from the
opening kickoff. Although the
Cardinal kept the game reason
ably close for three quarters,
everything that could have possibly
gone wrong in that game went
wrong. Stanford was utterly humil

iated on its own field.
Fast forward to 2013: With
201 l's game etched on many Cardi
nal fans' minds, I know many fans
were worried about a similar result
against Oregon in 2013. In fact, a
large majority of people outside of
the Stanford program, including
the Oregon Ducks themselves,
thought Stanford's 2012 victory in
Eugene, Ore., was an anomaly and
that the Ducks would reassert
themselves with their high-pow
ered offense and standout quarter
back Marcus Mariota.
Instead, the seemingly unex
pected happened: Stanford not on
ly beat the Ducks for a second con
secutive year but utterly thrashed
them in the process. Stanford dom
inated both lines of scrimmage and
time of possession while running
out to a 26-0 lead. Although the
Ducks would score a few times in
what amounted to be garbage time
in the fourth quarter, any reason
able observer could see who was
the better football team.
I believe that John Elway, dur
ing his halftime jersey retirement
ceremony, would provide the quote
that would ultimately best summa
rize the night: "We've got some
work to get done tonight, and that
is about kicking a little ass in the
second half...
In short, the Card played an ab
solutely inspired game. Senior
lyier Gaffney carried the ball for
an inhuman 45 carries, and Stan

ford's defense put up perhaps its
finest performance in program his
tory; if you don't believe me, look at
Marcus Mariota's expression after
three Cardinal defenders, namely
senior linebacker A.J. Tarpley, sen
ior defensive tackle David Parry
and fifth-year senior linebacker
Jarek Lancaster, absolutely leveled
him for a sack and fumble recovery.
By the end of the night, the Car
dinal had delivered a tremendous
knockout of the Oregon Ducks, and
in the process, more than avenged
201 l's defeat at Stanford Stadium.
This time, it was the Cardinal left
to celebrate with its fans one of the
most impressive victories in school
history, and at least for one night,
send a definitive message to the en
tire nation that Stanford was truly
the "Best in the West."

Do: "A-RI-ZO-NA!" clap, clap,
clap-clap-clap. "A-RI-ZO-NA!"
clap, clap, clap-clap-clap.
To me, the most beautiful ele
ment of sports is its ability to
bring together the unlikeliest of
people into a brotherhood of sorts
a group of strangers standing
in each others' arms, killing their
vocal cords together, exchanging
high-fives bonded first and
foremost by their shared desire to
see a man hit a ball with a stick as
far as possible. Or move an inflat
ed pig bladder 10 yards at a time.
Or kick a ball into a net.
Such was the scene at Stan

ford Stadium on Nov. 23, 2013.
All of a sudden, the spectacle
on the field in front of the fans
didn't matter. Nobody cared that
Stanford was steamrolling its
most hated rival to a historic de
gree in one of the most tradition
al rivalries in sports history.
Everybody from the engineer
from Kansas to the creative
writer from Louisiana to the piano
virtuoso from Singapore was
united by one event at that mo
ment, Stanford versus California
be damned.
And believe me, I was one of
them.
Arizona 42, Oregon 16.
That was the story of Big Game
2013. With all due respect to the
history of the storied Big Game,
Ty Montgomery's five (five!)
touchdowns in the first half and
Francis Owusu's flashy first ca
reer touchdown, the game itself
was a foregone conclusion weeks
before it was played and became
unimportant very early. Up in the
press box, streams of the Arizona-
Oregon game were on nearly
every laptop screen and very few
pairs of eyes were trained on the
field below.
Arizona somehow beat Oregon
by 26 points. As 21-point under
dogs. We laughed David Cohn out
of the building when he suggested
it before that fateful day. We all
thought that Stanford was doomed
to a shudder —Holiday Bowl

as the Ducks marched on, leaving
Stanford in its shadow yet again
despite the Cardinal's resounding
defeat of the Quack Attack just a
few weeks before. That's why this
was so important to Stanford's
fans. The USC loss left Stanford's
fans in the lowest of ruts after the
highest of highs. That juxtaposition
crushed a fervent fan base.
But inexplicably, the improbable
happened, injecting new life into a
fan base that was fully prepared for
the reality of missing the BCS and
setting off a rousing cheer during
Big Game 2013 as the fan base was
awakened again. That win was
what made a second consecutive
Pac-12 Championship and a trip to
the 100 th Rose Bowl Game possi
ble. For that, Stanford fans will be
grateful to the Arizona Wildcats for
a long, long time.
I proclaimed that day that I
would name my first-born child
"Arizona."
I have no idea how I'm going to
explain this one to my future wife.

David Cohn, Winston Shi and Do-
Hyoung Park are counting down the
days until the Cardinal and White
spring scrimmage so that they can
start' talking about and analyzing
college football once again. Keep the
conversation going during this
painful time by contacting them, at
dmcohn@st.anford.edu, wshi9l@
