# WEDNESDAY ROUNDTABLE
## WRAPPING UP 2013 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF FOOTBALL WRITERS 
The following is the final
Wednesday Roundtable for Vol.
Â£U of The Stanford Daily. The
2013-14. football season had
some remarkable highs like
the home :win against Oregon
and the Pac-12 title and
three crushing defeats. We
asked football writers Winston
Shi, David Cohn and Do-Hy
oung Park: What was your fa
vorite moment from the sea
son?

Winston: The high point of the
season had to be winning the Pac
-12 championship. Stanford has
won 14 conference titles, and, in
just three years, head coach David
Shaw's teams have captured two
of them. Winning the Pac-12 for
the second year in a row makes it
absolutely clear that the Cardinal
is the class of the West. There
were two brutal hiccups in confer

ence play, but Stanford stepped up
against its biggest contenders: It
absolutely put the wood to Ore
gon, humiliated Arizona State
twice, shut down UCLA's explo
sive offense and did I mention
Oregon?

Stanford killed a dragon on
Nov. 7, to be sure. It may seem
like small praise to call the Oregon
game the most lopsided one-score
victory I've ever seen, but from
that point the bruised and bat
tered Ducks were no longer invin
cible. For a Ducks program that so
thrived on its reputation of glam

orous devastation, Stanford's vic
tories certainly hurt. But for Stan
ford, Oregon was but a step to
ward the goal. The Cardinal is
about more than beating Oregon.
I said before the Oregon game
that Stanford's season was not go
ing to be defined by one evening,
and even with a great victory in
hindsight, I will not backtrack on
what I have said. If we will honor
the principle that great teams
count silverware and not big wins,
Stanford's Pac-12 championship is
undoubtedly the true gem of the
2013 season. Big games have hap
pened and will happen again, but
trophies never disappear.
It's indeed trophies that Stan
ford's players ultimately seek,
and, in that regard, David Shaw
has absolutely delivered. Some
people thought that Stanford
could go down the drain after Jim
Harbaugh left. Harbaugh is a tru
ly elite coach, but Shaw has now
