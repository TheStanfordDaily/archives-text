## SEEING GREEN In Drying Times 
### Holly Moeller 
Shivering, the first group of
students arrived at Almaden
Quicksilver County Park at 8
A.M. on Saturday morning.
Spoiled by a winter that, so far,
has seemed more like summer, a
few hadn't even packed sweaters.
We walked slowly uphill, mak
ing observations of the plant life
as we went. Throughout the day,
without fail, the students noted
the dryness of the sun-crisped
vegetation. They pointed out the
dry streambed to our left, the ex
panse of brown grass to our right,
and the half-dead sagebrush
sprinkled along the hillside. Fol
lowing the driest year California
has ever recorded, only the coy
otebrush, as hardy as its name
sake, and the live oak, with its
prickly-stiff evergreen leaves,
looked particularly alive.
I'm only in my fourth year as a
California resident and this is
my very first January really sa
voring the mild winters (namely,
their value to sand volleyball prac
tice). But even I can recognize how
unusual this weather pattern is.
January is usually a time of
greening: the late autumn and
winter bring cool, rainy days, re
hydrating the landscape and rous
ing desiccated plant life. In Janu
aries past, I remember digging
out my rain pants for the bike ride
across campus, hunting salaman
ders in Jasper Ridge, and biking
through falling snow on Skyline
Drive.
This year, January has been
the month of 70-degree noon-time
volleyball breaks, friends scraping
skis, snowboards, and knees over
once-covered rocks in Tahoe, and,
as we observed last Saturday, ab
solutely parched landscapes.
Indeed, it's been so dry that on
January 17, Governor Jerry
Brown declared a statewide
drought emergency.
Last year was the driest on
record the rainfall in 2013 in
San Francisco was the lowest ever
measured since record-keeping
began during the 1849 Gold Rush.
The first snowpack measure of the
year, on January 10, revealed that
our future water supply (much of
which comes from Sierra Nevada
meltwater) is in serious jeopardy.
In the Northern Sierra, the snow
pack is only 8% of normal. It's 16%
of normal in the Central Sierra
and 22% in the mountain range's
southern reaches.
Meanwhile, 99% of California
is "abnormally dry," and fully two
thirds of the state (especially San
Francisco and the Central Valley)
is in "extreme drought."
There's no rain to be seen in
the future forecasts, either.
Governor Brown asked us all to
make some voluntary cutbacks
and to try to reduce our water us
age by 20%. But his request hasn't
seemed to slow water usage that
much: I still walk to my office over
sprinkler-damped sidewalks each
morning.
Then again, we suburban
dwellers won't be hardest hit.
More than three quarters of
California's freshwater supply is
used for agriculture. Our bread
basket in the Central Valley is irri
gated by Sierra snowmelt and
in the absence of that snowmelt,
farmers will face tough choices in
the coming months.

You and I will be able to afford
(in dollars, and in energy) to
source our food from elsewhere.
But California's farmers rely on
successful harvests for their liveli
hood. In part, Governor Brown's
declaration should pave the way
for some additional economic secu
rity for them: easing bureaucracy
around water transfers, streamlin
ing regulations, and asking the
federal government for financial
assistance. It will be a tough year,
but most of these farmers have
weathered droughts before (for
example, as recently as 2009).
Still, it's hard to avoid the
frightening thought that this
drought might be part of a larger
pattern.
As we laid out tape measures
and counted plants amid the chap
arral last Saturday, a student
asked me why this year has been
so dry.
It's hard to say, I told him.
No mutter how extreme, one
year doesn't make a trend,
Yet climate models predict that,
as a result of human activity in
creasing carbon dioxide concentra
tions in the atmosphere, California
will get hotter and drier in the
coming decades. This January
may represent a synergy of that
larger trend and some exceptional
weather patterns that are siphon
ing off our usual though declin
ing rainfall quota.
In addition, scholars of natural
climate records believe California
experienced plenty of droughts be
fore we humans started chroni
cling rainfall. Some dry spells last
ed decades and were extreme
enough to be called "mega
droughts."
What if that terrifying scenario
has returned? Such an event would
be unthinkable in modern Califor
nia, where our Utopian existence is
supported by water that first fell
as rain or snow hundreds of miles
away sometimes even across
state lines. Threats to that water
supply means reevaluating not on
ly our swimming pools and lawn
maintenance but also potentially
severe blows to an agricultural
economy worth $45 billion.
Never has it been more clear
that questions of sustainability are
also fundamentally questions of
adaptability than in these trying,
drying times.
