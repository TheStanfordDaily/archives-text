# The 						Case Against Civility
## 
### Jason Willick 
The Israeli government could
be days away from criminaliz
ing the derogatory use of the
word "Nazi" and other words and
symbols associated with the Holo
caust. Predictably and appropriate
ly, this has elicited near-universal
shock and disapproval from opin
ion-makers on this side of the At
lantic, who have typically made two
distinct arguments against the leg
islation.
The first argument is that a ban
on words will almost certainly be in
effective. A Brown linguist predict
ed a proliferation of "overt attempts
to resist the law" if it passes, and
Commentary Magazine's Tom Wil
son speculated that "perhaps Is
rael's politicians can look forward to
being compared to Pol Pot and
Ceausescu from now on." Resist
ance will no doubt be amplified by
the irony at the heart of the endeav
or: Israeli politicians resent being
compared to totalitarians and
are responding by literally banning
words.
The second argument is that the
use of Nazi-related slurs might not

always be beyond the pale. The
New Republic's Marc Tracy argued
that while many Nazi comparisons
are vile and offensive, "the Holo
caust's uniqueness should actually
make it an extremely useful heuris
tic for understanding the world" in
certain contexts. A widely circulat
ed op-ed made the case that "some
times 'Nazi' is the right word."
These two criticisms of the law
are persuasive, but they are far too
feeble. They leave room for a ban if
only it could be applied (a) without
unintended consequences and (b)
only in instances where 'Nazi' is
used purely to demean and offend.
In other words, they tacitly accept
the idea that purging uncivil lan
guage from our discourse is a wor
thy goal, and merely submit that
censorship is the wrong way to go
about it.
The New York Times' education
blog displayed this reasoning when
it earnestly asked students to send
in replies to the question: "Which
do you think is more effective in
combating offensive language: gov
ernment censorship or public edu

cation, or both?"
But the fact is that offensive and
even hateful speech plays a crucial
role in a free society, and Israel's
'Nazi' law would be immensely
harmful even if there were no legit
imate uses for the word. History's
most eloquent defender of free ex
pression, John Stuart Mill, ob
served in On Liberty that even if an
opinion is wrong, society is deprived
of the "livelier impression of the
truth, produced by its collision with
error" if it is censored. The exis
tence of hateful viewpoints serves
the vital purpose of reminding us
why we don't share them.
Mill insisted that unless an idea is
"fully, frequently, and fearlessly dis
cussed, it will be held as dead dogma,
not a living truth." If citizens have no
exposure to viewpoints that are
hateful and false including anti-
Semitic, racist, sexist, and homopho
bic ideas they cannot possibly un
derstand ideas that are good and
true in any meaningful way.
The notion that uncivil speech
serves no legitimate purpose and
ought to be eradicated is not, of
course, confined to Israel. In fact, it
has become conventional wisdom on
American college campuses. Hun
dreds of universities across the
United States maintain unconstitu
tional speech codes that make pun
ishable inappropriate language.
The Obama administration's Office
of Civil Rights only recently backed
off an astonishing speech mandate
that would have banned any "un
welcome" discussions of sex at U.S.
colleges and universities.
Like the Israeli legislation,
these ill-conceived attempts to con
trol students' expression likely in
jure the very people they are trying
to protect. Noted gay rights advo
cate Jonathan Rauch has shown
that movements for equality for mi
nority groups have been made pos
sible by America's system of intel
lectual competition. "Not long ago,"
Rauch writes, "gays were pariahs.
We had no real political power, only
the force of our arguments. But in a
society where free exchange was
the rule, that was enough."
Of course, I'm not advocating for
rudeness, insensitivity, or bigotry. I
am advocating for genuine intellec
tual pluralism, which necessitates a
certain amount of incivility. Better
to live in a society with a rowdy and
sometimes offensive public dis
course than a society of dead dog
mas and hollow truths.
