Ahmed's venture into the
publishing world is just one ex

of successful student authors

M.A. 'OO, winner of the 2011 Na

Professor Emeritus of Eng

Steinkellner obtain a Chappell-

which helped him star his mid

Disney Hyperion Publishing
shortly after his senior year.
Steinkellner is now wilting
his third children's book while
working as a screenwriter.
"Stanford is maybe the en

Steinkellner said. "Being
around so many people doing
big things definitely inspired me
and almost peer pressured me
into trying something big on my
own."
Tom Kealey, a lecturer in the
Creative Writing Program, said
that in addition to
specific courses, the program of
fers advising, research and
grants to student writers inter

ested in becoming authors.
The Creative Writing Pro
gram also brings in famous au
thors, hold workshops on pub

dergraduate reading events in
residence halls. There are also
the Levinthal tutorials where
undergraduates are matched
one-on-one with Stegner Fel
lows.
"They get basically their
own private tutor for the winter
quarter," Kealey said.

began working on his book of
poetry during his sophomore
year at Stanford. He found that
writing allowed him to escape
the rigors of his mechanical en

"[Writing is] really fun be
cause there's no pressure,"
Ahmed said. "There's no dead
line for publishing a book. I can
publish it now; I can publish it
the day before I die. No dead
lines, unlike with problem sets
and midterms."
Through Stanford's Creative
Writing Program, Ahmed was
able to develop a mentoring re
lationship with former Jones
lecturer Michael McGriff.
"Before I would go to bed, I
would just write for an hour, an
hour and a half. I sometimes
couldn't even sleep because I
was just having so much fun
writing," Ahmed said. "[Mc-

Appealing to a diverse group
Increasing resources for the
Creative Writing Program have
prompted an increase in the
number of students enrolled in
creative writing courses on cam

gram administrator.

first joined the program in 2001,
only 20 undergraduate classes

there are 70 offered. Kealey
believes that one of the rea
sons for this growth is the
program's recent appeal to
students both within and out
side the English major.
"The majority of our stu
dents used to be majors in
English and minors in cre
ative writing but nowadays
the majority of our students
are majors in other areas,"
Kealey said. "That's actually
been where our growth has
come from."
Katherine Ewell 'l7 is one

of those students. At age 18
she is already expecting her
young adult novel "Dear
Killer" to be published in
April through HarperCollins.
"I like the feeling of being
able to create stories, places,
people," Ewell said. "Being
able to bring a place to life
that you only see in your mind
and being able to do that by
yourself is really cool."
Despite her interest in the
field and the fact that she
came to Stanford specifically
for the Creative Writing Pro
gram, she also plans to study
biology.
Ahmed, who works as a
mechanical engineer at Boe
ing, continues to explore his
creative writing interest as he

works on a second book of po
etry and a novel.
Then there's Max Doty 'O4
M.A. 'O4.

While at Stanford, Doty
created an informal writing
group with his friends and
took advantage of the men
toring environment on the
Farm that helped foster a cre
ative writing culture.
"[Being at Stanford] was
the first time in my life where
I felt like I belonged to a com
munity of writers," Doty said.
Several of Doty's friends
who were in the writing
group went on to complete
Master's programs in cre
ative writing and also ended
up publishing books.
Yet Doty, who had aspira

tions to become a novelist,
now applies his writing expe
riences from Stanford as a
writer at a startup gaming
company called Pixelberry
Studios.
"At the time I was at Stan
ford, I had tunnel vision on
becoming a great literary
novelist," Doty said.
"I still hope I publish a
great literary novel one day,
but I have a lot of fun writing
for young adults and writing
for video games," he added.
"So the thing you actually do
might not be the same as
what you think you're going

began working on his book of
poetry during his sophomore
year at Stanford. He found that
writing allowed him to escape
the rigors of his mechanical en

"[Writing is] really fun be
cause there's no pressure,"
Ahmed said. "There's no dead
line for publishing a book. I can
publish it now; I can publish it
the day before I die. No dead
lines, unlike with problem sets
and midterms."
Through Stanford's Creative
Writing Program, Ahmed was
able to develop a mentoring re
lationship with former Jones
lecturer Michael McGriff.
"Before I would go to bed, I
would just write for an hour, an
hour and a half. I sometimes
couldn't even sleep because I
was just having so much fun

Appealing to a diverse group
Increasing resources for the
Creative Writing Program have
prompted an increase in the
number of students enrolled in
creative writing courses on cam

Kealey said that when he
first joined the program in 2001,
only 20 undergraduate classes
were offered each year. Now

there are 70 offered. Kealey
believes that one of the rea
sons for this growth is the
program's recent appeal to
students both within and out
side the English major.
"The majority of our stu
dents used to be majors in
English and minors in cre
ative writing but nowadays
the majority of our students
are majors in other areas,"
Kealey said. "That's actually
been where our growth has
come from."
Katherine Ewell 'l7 is one

of those students. At age 18
she is already expecting her
young adult novel "Dear
Killer" to be published in
April through HarperCollins.
"I like the feeling of being
able to create stories, places,
people," Ewell said. "Being
able to bring a place to life
that you only see in your mind
and being able to do that by
yourself is really cool."
Despite her interest in the
field and the fact that she
came to Stanford specifically
for the Creative Writing Pro
gram, she also plans to study
biology.
Ahmed, who works as a
mechanical engineer at Boe

creative writing interest as he

works on a second book of po
etry and a novel.

M.A. 'O4.

While at Stanford, Doty
created an informal writing
group with his friends and
took advantage of the men
toring environment on the
Farm that helped foster a cre
ative writing culture.
"[Being at Stanford] was
the first time in my life where
I felt like I belonged to a com
munity of writers," Doty said.
Several of Doty's friends
who were in the writing
group went on to complete
Master's programs in cre
ative writing and also ended
up publishing books.
Yet Doty, who had aspira

tions to become a novelist,
now applies his writing expe
riences from Stanford as a
writer at a startup gaming
company called Pixelberry
Studios.
"At the time I was at Stan
ford, I had tunnel vision on
becoming a great literary
novelist," Doty said.
"I still hope I publish a
great literary novel one day,
but I have a lot of fun writing
for young adults and writing
for video games," he added.
"So the thing you actually do
might not be the same as
what you think you're going
to do."
