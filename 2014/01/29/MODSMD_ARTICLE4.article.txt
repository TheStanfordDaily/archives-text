## ASSU plans to lift study abroad ban 
### ANDREW VOGELEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Tuesday night, the 15th Undergraduate Sen
ate expressed widespread support for a bill that
would remove the current study abroad restriction
for sitting senators.
The bill, which will be voted on next week, seeks
to address what senators believe is a major obstacle
for many upperclassmen considering running for
Senate. With many students electing to study abroad
their junior year, the bill would allow senators to
study abroad while serving.
"I definitely think it will increase the number of
upperclassmen running for Senate," Senator Anna
Breed 'l6 said.
Due to a high turnover rate from year to year
no members of the 15th Senate have had previous
experience and all but one were freshmen when they
ran for office the Senate has been robbed of insti
tutional memory. The bill, as currently written,
would allow up to three senators to study abroad per
quarter, limiting first-year senators to study abroad
only during the final quarter of their* term and allow
ing returning senators to study abroad during any
quarter.
Senator John-Lancaster Finley 'l6 noted that, ac
cording to data from the Bing Overseas Study Pro
gram, on average 51 percent of each graduating class
studies abroad at least once during then* time at
Stanford.
"There's no question that someone with more ex
perience would be better prepared to step into the
role of being a senator than a freshman would," Fin
ley said. "We've identified the study abroad restric
tion as one of the main things that's stopping upper
classmen from running."
