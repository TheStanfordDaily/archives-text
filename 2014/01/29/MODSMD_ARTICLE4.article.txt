## ASSU plans to lift study abroad ban 
### ANDREW VOGELEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Tuesday night, the 15th Undergraduate Sen
ate expressed widespread support for a bill that
would remove the current study abroad restriction
for sitting senators.
The bill, which will be voted on next week, seeks
to address what senators believe is a major obstacle
for many upperclassmen considering running for
Senate. With many students electing to study abroad
their junior year, the bill would allow senators to
study abroad while serving.
"I definitely think it will increase the number of
upperclassmen running for Senate," Senator Anna
Breed 'l6 said.
Due to a high turnover rate from year to year
no members of the 15th Senate have had previous
experience and all but one were freshmen when they
ran for office the Senate has been robbed of insti
tutional memory. The bill, as currently written,
would allow up to three senators to study abroad per
quarter, limiting first-year senators to study abroad
only during the final quarter of their* term and allow
ing returning senators to study abroad during any
quarter.
Senator John-Lancaster Finley 'l6 noted that, ac
cording to data from the Bing Overseas Study Pro
gram, on average 51 percent of each graduating class
studies abroad at least once during then* time at
Stanford.
"There's no question that someone with more ex
perience would be better prepared to step into the
role of being a senator than a freshman would," Fin
ley said. "We've identified the study abroad restric
tion as one of the main things that's stopping upper
classmen from running."
Many of the senators indi
cated support for the spirit of
the bill, but several senators
raised concerns about having
committee chairs and other
Senate leaders abroad.
The Senate also heard an
update from the members of
the Student Activities Fee
(SAFE) Reform group Tues
day night. Olivia Moore 'l6
and Justine Moore 'l6 out
lined several potential
changes to their reform,
which focuses on the funding
process for student groups.
They noted that they hoped
for a Senate vote on the legis
lation in a few weeks.
"Seeing under the hood of
the funding system for the
first time, you realize that we
are funding so much more

than our peer institutions.
The funding system we have
is crazy and incredibly ineffi
cient," Senate Chair Ben Hol
ston'ls said. "It is very im
portant this passes.
The Senate also con
firmed four members to the
Constitutional Council, ap
proving Geo Saba 'l5, Jelani
Munroe 'l6, Milton
Achelpohl'l3 M.A.T4 and
Sona Sulakian 'l6. The Con
stitutional Council functions
as the judicial branch of the
ASSU.
"The Council grants us
additional knowledge in the
ASSU additional people to
go to on issues, additional
people to get involved and
additional people to provide
student voice," Finley said.
The Senate also passed
$30,583.49 in regular funding
bills.

The ASSU Senate hopes to pass a bill that would remove
the ban on going abroad for current senators. This is part
of an effort to attract more upperclassmen members.
