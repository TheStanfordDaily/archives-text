## Community Law Clinic offers free legal services 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
A modern office space is now open to clients
seeking free legal services at the Community
Law Clinic (CLC) in East Palo Alto, one of the
eleven clinics offered by the Stanford Law School
that offers a hands-on learning experience for as
piring lawyers while giving back to the communi

The law school allotted $lOO,OOO to complete
the "long-overdue but very successful facelift for
the space," according to Juliet Brodie, law profes

The CLC opened in its current form in 2003;
however, a previous iteration of the clinic, named
the East Palo Alto Community Law Project, had
been located on the same site on University Av

came as a result of the Law School's rededication
to a dual mission: to provide legal representation
to low-income people in the surrounding area, and
to give law students the opportunity to act as real
lawyers.
She added that the reopening in 2003 was part
of a dramatic growth in the law school clinical ed

"Before 2003, the clinic was just one of a small
handful of stand-alone experiential learning op

past ten years, the law school has made one of its
principal initiatives to build a sizable and strate

Brodie began working at the clinic in 2006 af
ter having spent the previous 10 years working in
similar community-based programs at two other
law schools. At the CLC, Brodie supervises the
