# Law students practice at EPA clinic
## Community Law Clinic offers free legal services 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
A modern office space is now open to clients
seeking free legal services at the Community
Law Clinic (CLC) in East Palo Alto, one of the
eleven clinics offered by the Stanford Law School
that offers a hands-on learning experience for as
piring lawyers while giving back to the communi
ty-
The law school allotted $lOO,OOO to complete
the "long-overdue but very successful facelift for
the space," according to Juliet Brodie, law profes
sor and the clinic's director.
The CLC is one of only a handful of organiza
tions that provide free legal representation to in
dividuals from low-income households in the East
Palo Alto community, Brodie said.
"All across America, there's a crisis with the
lack of attorneys for poor people in some of the
most important areas in their life, like housing,
wages and income," she said. "There just aren't
enough lawyers, so we hope to be a tiny part of
the solution."
"We become their lawyers and help them in
the way that lawyers do," she added.
A clinic's history
The CLC opened in its current form in 2003;
however, a previous iteration of the clinic, named
the East Palo Alto Community Law Project, had
been located on the same site on University Av
enue for many years prior.
According to Brodie, the reopening in 2003
came as a result of the Law School's rededication
to a dual mission: to provide legal representation
to low-income people in the surrounding area, and
to give law students the opportunity to act as real
lawyers.
She added that the reopening in 2003 was part
of a dramatic growth in the law school clinical ed
ucation program in general.
"Before 2003, the clinic was just one of a small
handful of stand-alone experiential learning op
portunities for students," Brodie said. "In the
past ten years, the law school has made one of its
principal initiatives to build a sizable and strate
gic clinic."
Brodie began working at the clinic in 2006 af
ter having spent the previous 10 years working in
similar community-based programs at two other
law schools. At the CLC, Brodie supervises the
law students with three oth
er clinical supervising attor
neys: Danielle Jones, Lisa
Douglass and Larisa Bow
man.
For Brodie, one of the
most successful parts of the
clinic is its ability to adapt
the practice to the needs of
the community.
"We can't do everything
people suggest, but we can
keep our ear to the ground
and try to understand what's
needed," she said. "I see for
the future of this clinic con
tinuing that process of en
gaging with the community
to see how we can be most
useful."

Student lawyers
After submitting her ap
plication last year, Nisha
Kashyap J.D. 'l4 began
working at the clinic this
quarter.
Law students can apply
to be a part of one of the
eleven clinics offered
through the law school,
Kashyap said. If accepted,
these students spend the
quarter working full-time for

the clinic, receiving academ
ic credit for them work and
refraining from enrollment
in any other classes. Brodie
compared this kind of pro
gram to a residency, in which
the student is completely in
volved with the process.
"[At the CLC], students
become the actual lawyer on
record for low-income people
in a bunch of different cas
es," Brodie said. "They work
cases related to eviction de
fense work, social security
hearings, wage disputes and
helping people with criminal
record expungement."
According to Brodie, the
law students under the
supervision of one of the four
attorneys are involved in
every step of a case: They go
to the court, interact with
the judges, write up files and
research their cases.
"The type of work I want
to do is legal aid work and di
rect service work work

ing with clients and I
thought this might be a good
way to practice that kind of
work before graduating,"
Kashyap said.
For Kashyap, the pri
mary function of the CLC is
to bring legal aid and servic
es to a community that does
not have many options, espe
cially for free legal services.
"There's a lot of need for
this kind of work in East Pa
lo Alto and in the Bay Area
in general," she said. "[The
CLC] helps fill that gap with
services."
Kashyap added that the
clinic was a great opportuni
ty to get out of the classroom
environment and practice
the kinds of skills she'll be
using as a lawyer.
"Class is great, but the
things I do in class are not
the kinds of things I'll be do
ing as a lawyer," she said.
Casey Raymond J.D. 'l4
has been working at the clin
ic for three quarters.
"What I loved about the
program, and why I've
stayed with it for so long is
that it's so hands-on," Ray
mond said. "I think law
school is academic, but it's
also a trade school, and I
think it's good to have done
some litigation or been be
fore a judge or done negotia
tions with clients or other
lawyers before starting your
legal practice."
Maintaining a balance be
tween classroom and clinic
work can create a much
more successful and reward
ing law school experience,
Raymond added.
"We help provide and
protect the basic needs and
rights of people in the com
munity," he said, mentioning
that he is currently working
on a class action suit that has
been filed for a client who
was working, but was not
paid wages.
Kashyap is currently
working on two cases. One

focuses on expungement of a
criminal record for a client
with old criminal convictions
from twenty years ago that
he would like to have re
moved from his record.
"The other case involves
a client who was disabled in a
workplace environment five
years ago and can no longer
work," she said. "I'm helping
her apply for supplemental
security income benefits,
through the social security
administration."
For Kashyap, getting ex

posure to different kinds of
law in the clinic is a great ex
perience.
"The clinic gives you an
opportunity to be exposed to
more types of law, like ex
pungement, wage and hour,"
she said. "That's how the
clinic is shaped, to give you
more exposure as to the
types of options for law you
could work with after
school."
