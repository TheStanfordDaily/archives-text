## The 						true power of the Stanford fan 
### Sam Fisher 
I never thought this moment
would come for three rea
sons. I never thought I would
be a writer, once I started at
The Daily I certainly didn't
think I'd be writing a goodbye col
umn and, after I somehow caved on
the first two, I promised myself
that my goodbye column wouldn't
be as gushy as Jacob Jaffe's.
Like too many times on the dia
mond back in high school, I'm about
to go 0-for-3.
It's been a little over two years
since I wrote my first article of any
kind. At the time, I was a sopho
more CS major whose least fa
vorite thing in the entire world
was writing papers, and anyone
who read that column knows that I
had the emotion part down but not
much else.
I sometimes laugh when I think
back to that version of Sam Fisher.
It's hard to imagine that he really
was me. He had no interest in The
Daily or writing in general. In fact,
if it weren't for my friendship with
then-incoming Editor in Chief Billy
Gallagher from our freshman year
in Twain, there's almost no chance I
ever would have written another
story. Good thing Billy is as persist
ent as they come.
I found The Daily during a time
of personal uncertainty. I had lost
much of my passion for computer
science, which was the focus of my
first two years at Stanford, and I
truly did not know what I wanted
to do with the rest of my time on
the Farm. Put simply, I was search
ing for a new intellectual vitality,
and I found it at The Daily.
My 16 months at The Daily have
been a whirlwind. They couldn't
have started any better my first
ever newspaper came after Stan
ford football's upset of No. 2 USC;
I'm still proud of that "Finished
Business" headline and I can't
imagine a better group of people for
them to end with.
That special group of people is
n't just limited to the office or
broadcast booth though I have to
say they are pretty amazing. A big
part of what made this journey so
exhilarating is that all of you read
The Daily and many of you listen to
my broadcasts on KZSU.
It's often hard to find motiva
tion to keep working well into the
early hours of the morning, and
that's before we even get to start
our actual homework. It's much
easier to settle for less than our
best, as we overworked and overex
tended students are forced to do so
often at Stanford. But because of
all of you, we find away to stay up
until 4 a.m. for days or weeks on
end and spend countless weekends
holed up by a computer. You force
us to be our best.
I fell in love with covering Stan
ford sports because, somehow, in
spite of how good just about every
team is, the community is so small.
In the true spirit of Stanford,
there's something delightfully
quirky about every little aspect of
Stanford Athletics, and I'm going to
miss the niche of Cardinal super
fans I've found through The Daily.
Whether you're out there on
Twitter reacting to our opinions,
posting on the message boards or
firing emails off from wherever
you've called home since you left the
Farm, you matter. @BlocklnThe-
Back, @MslngaSpoke, @jilldubs,
@LSJU97 and everyone else who
has reached out to me time and time
again, it has been an honor to be a
source of information for such pas
sionate fans.
So in my final editorial act at
The Daily, let me ask for one favor
of yours: Keep reading The Daily,
and keep listening to KZSU.
There's a reason why this col
umn is coming to you at the end of
January and not the beginning of
June: The talent level at The Daily
and KZSU is so strong that I'm not
needed for these last few months.
I'll be focusing on the behind
the-scenes tasks that will help The
Daily stay relevant for years to
come, because people like Do-Hy
oung Park, Ashley Westhem, Win
ston Shi, Michael Peterson and
David Cohn are more than ready to
take my place. Let them take my
place in your lives. Reach out to
them. Tell them how you feel about
their work.
Most of all make sure that they
give you nothing less than their

best, because only you have
that power. I've seen that
firsthand, so thank you for
making me go that extra
mile.
It's time for the end of
this journey and, with that,
the beginning of a new one.

Don't be strangers I know
that's not your style.

The mentoring and guid
ance that Sam Fisher has
provided to all of us sports
writers is incomparable and
will be earned with us fore v
er. We'll do our best to make
you proud. Email your own
thanks and praise for Sam
at safisher@Stanford.edu
and follow him on Twitter
