M M ■ mmortality is non
£ J H transferable." John
I Updike wrote these
I words in 1960 to com-
I memorate Jbd Williams'
last game, and true to form, nearly 60
years later Boston still mourns its ir
replaceable loss. Itself immortal, Up
dike's "Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu" is
probably the single greatest piece of
sports literature ever written, and
similarly to the Fenway faithful, we at
the sports desk are forever looking
up at it.
That is not to say that there is
nothing we have achieved. Far from
it. Updike's greatness is real, and we
seek not to cower at the past but
rather to admire it, challenge it and,
yes, hopefully surpass it. It is a goal
that is more of a dream than a direc
tive. I freely admit it. But I should ex
pect nothing less.
Every baseball player in America
dreams to hit as Ted Williams did.
That aspiration defines who they are.
At The Stanford Daily, we have also
tiled to dream in that same aspira
tional manner. We have no John Up
dike on our staff. But we certainly
wish we did.
Volume 244 of The Stanford Daily
is ending—we operate on a semes
ter schedule, a holdover from ages
past and on Feb. 1 we will gradu
ate a generation of fellow dreamers.
Our semester schedule, as opposed to
most college papers' full-year opera
tions, means that people can get op
portunities early on that they other
wise wouldn't get until late in their ca
reers. But it also means that people
cycle out quickly That's the nature of
the game.
We are losing some very special
people on Feb. 1. Sam Fisher, emper
or of the sports section, is a commen
tator the likes of which has not graced
Stanford for a long time, and in whose
shadow we all travel. Ed Ngai, our
fearless leader for the last volume, I
remember as the person who taught
me how to write in news style al
though, having since moved on to
sports, I admit it's not a skill I have
utilized veiy often. Aaron Sekhri, our
opinions editor and the man who con
vinced me to write for The Daily in
the first place, is taking a well-de
served breather of his own. And it is
not much of an exaggeration to say
that Willa Brock and Charlotte
Wayne, our resident masters of
Jeopardy!, witticisms and proper
grammar, have given me hope in
humanity time and time again.
Needless to say, their shoes will be
hard to fill.
In their place, we bring in a
group of editors I am relentlessly
excited to welcome. George Chen,
my old editor in sports and fellow
troller of the University of Califor
nia, will be showrunning for Volume
245 and I pledge him my full sup
port. Marshall Watkins, recently
returned from Washington D.C.,
will be as capable an executive edi
tor as anybody could ask for. Do-
Hyoung Park, my longtime coun
terpart on the sports desk, will be
filling Sam's shoes as managing ed
itor of sports. And Michael Peter
son will be taking my place among
the sports columnists.
Taking my place among the
sports columnists ... yes. It's
hard to admit, but this is my last
column in sports for the foresee
able future. Starting Feb. 1, I will
be taking over the opinions desk,
and there my column will go as
well. We have a marvelous collec
tion of columnists at opinions
some returning, others new and
I will be the first to welcome you to
what we have in store.

I have written this column at
The Daily for a year now. I remem
ber sitting in the cafeteria with
George midway through my fresh
man year as he tried to sell me on
an editorial position at The Daily. I
also remember turning George
down that day, but I did jump at the
idea of writing a column. It was one
of the best decisions of my life. I
was not John Updike and I've never
pretended to be. But I certainly
tried, and I had a ball nonetheless.
What I appreciated most about
my column was that it gave me the
opportunity and the responsibility
to consider things I had never real
ly thought about before. A column
ultimately asks its writer to develop
an argument worthy of its lines. I
don't know if I have succeeded. I do
know, however, that having taken

the time to ponder my fan
dom, I am a better sports fan
than I was a year ago.
It's ironic, however, that
my favorite piece of mine at
The Daily is not a column at
all. For that, I direct you to
the inestimable Shannon
Turley. As for columns, the
Iron Bowl and its aftermath
reminded me in dramatic
fashion that there was a
world of readers beyond
Stanford's walls. College
football gave me perspective;
the Toronto Maple Leafs
showed me sorrow; Lance
Armstrong personified dis
appointment; Tim Lincecum
and Ben Gardner represent
ed perseverance and in Fen
way Park I witnessed a cer
tain rebirth.

It's strange that I'm leav
ing the sports desk midway
through winter quarter. The
Daily doesn't sync with Stan
ford's schedule; every depar
ture feels out of place. The
people who are leaving us de
serve greater fanfare than
they received Williams
closed his career with a home
run against the Yankees, but
mere mortals are rarely so

lucky.
Yet that mirrors sports in
away. People leave and oth
ers take their place; it's the
cycle of athletics, and it's
part of what makes sports so
compelling. Departures cre
ate openings, and where
there are openings, there are
also opportunities. It is the
hope of finding a Ted
Williams that motivates us.
In constantly pulling in new
faces, sports renews that
hope, and in chaining our
hope to the lingering glories
of legends past, sports re
minds us that what brought
us to the game in the first
place still remains and shines
all the brighter. We cherish
that twofold dream at the
sports desk, and if I will
leave it for the time being, I
intend to take my leave by
reminding you of why we
are here.
The dream is real and
it will never die.

With the departure of Win
ston Shi, from the sports sec
tion, The Daily will likely
lose thousands of pageviews
from Auburn fans checking
hopefully to see if their fa
vorite Daily columnist im
mortalized another of their
team's moments. Tell Win
ston how much you'll miss
