# BAY BATTLE AHEAD
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 4 Stanford women's basketball (19-1,8-0
Pac-12) recently faced what some were expect
ing to be two difficult tests when it took on No.
15 Arizona State last week and played USC on
Monday to determine which team would sit
atop the Pac-12.

If those were tests, then the Cardinal passed
with flying colors. And it's not as if the test was
n't hard both teams have good records and
solid rosters and have proven themselves with
big wins of their own it's just that the Cardi
nal is above the pressure of test-taking at this
point in the season and is just concentrating on
playing its own game.
That's exactly what the Card is going to do

tonight when it takes on No. 21 Cal another
so-called "test." The reason that Stanford has
been so successful against all of its opponents,
ranked and unranked alike, is because senior
forward and consensus national player of the
year candidate Chiney Ogwumike is not the on
ly player showing up to perform well on these
tests. On Monday against USC, four Cardinal
players not named "Ogwumike" scored in dou
ble digits to go with Ogwumike's 30 only the
second time that has happened this season.
Senior forward Mikaela Ruef tallied a dou
ble-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds, jun
ior point guard Amber Orrange and freshman
guard Lili Thompson added 12 points apiece
and freshman guard Karlie Samuelson chipped
in with 10 of her own. Although Ogwumike is
the only Stanford player to average double dig
its in scoring (27.1 points per game), this does
n't seem to be a problem for the Card, as it still
manages to generate an average of 80.3 points
per game. Different players in each game
and more recently, multiple players have
stepped up in order to complement Ogwumike's
output.
Thompson in particular has been stellar in
Pac-12 play, averaging 11.3 ppg in conference
play and 8 ppg overall. Thompson, along with
Orrange, has been efficient in feeding the ball to
Ogwumike and using screens to create open
shots for herself. Ruef has also been instrumen
tal in providing Ogwumike with "rainbow"
passes, as head coach Tara VanDerveer refers
to them.
Tonight's game will be a matchup of the two
best point guards in the Pac-12 with Orrange
(9.6 ppg) and Cal junior Brittany Boyd (14 ppg)
squaring off. Both players are on the watch list
for the Nancy Lieberman Award, which honors
the best point guard in the nation. The pair is al
so ranked first and second on the Pac-12's as
sists leaderboard: Boyd leads with 5.63 assists
per game and Orrange is close behind with 4.90
apg, including eight against UCLA last Friday.
One of the Card's keys to the game will be to
disrupt the passing efficiency of Boyd by play
ing tight defense to force both harder passes
and less desirable shots.
Cal is also led by junior forward Reshanda
Gray, who is averaging 17.3 ppg and 7.9 rebounds
per game. The Golden Bears only trail second
place in the Pac-12 by half a win and will strive to
close the two-game gap with Stanford in their

two meetings this weekend.
This will be the second con
secutive season in which the
Card and Bears will play
each other back-to-back due
to the condensed schedule.
Last year, Stanford had
to split the conference crown
with Cal after it lost to the
Bears at Maples the second
time the two teams met in
the same week. Stanford will
hope to actually utilize its

home-court advantage this
time around and make yet
another statement against a
ranked opponent, while Cal
will hope to consolidate its
continued dominance in the
Pac-12. Anything can hap
pen in a rivalry game, but if
Stanford lives up to the cal
iber of play it displayed
against Arizona State and
USC, Cal could easily end up
failing this test.
Tip-off for the Battle of
the Bay is set for tonight at 8
p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
