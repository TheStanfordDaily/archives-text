## Cardinal returns to Maples Undefeated home record on the line 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
No. 7 Stanford men's volleyball (4-
3, 1-3 MPSF) is finally returning
home this weekend and will be wel
coming Maples Pavilion and its unde
feated home record with open arms.
After a strenuous and disappointing
two weeks on the road in which the
Cardinal lost three very close match
es, Stanford will face No. 6 Long
Beach State (4-3, 3-3) on Friday and
No. 13 Cal State Northridge (2-3,2-2)
on Saturday.
Long Beach State is coming off of
an impressive five-set win over top

MPSF player of the week after col

and a season-high 13 digs. Senior lan
Satterfield had six blocks against
Pepperdine and his massive blocking
ability will be a threat to Stanford re

Long Beach State's defense is the
element that the Cardinal should re

for Friday's match. Against Pepper

high 63 digs and 22 blocks. In fact, it
is Long Beach State's blocking power
that is the most impressive, with the
team having out-blocked Pepperdine
22-9.5 in that match. The Cardinal's
strongest offensive players espe
cially senior outside hitters Brian
Cook and Steven Irvin will have to
find away to work around and coun
teract LBSU's blocking.
LBSU holds the advantage
against Stanford in the two teams' all
time series, 44-28. Last season, Stan
ford was swept by LBSU at Maples
and then again at the MPSF Tourna
ment quarterfinals. But while LBSU
holds the advantage in the series and
is coming off a dominating defensive
performance, LBSU has demonstrat-
