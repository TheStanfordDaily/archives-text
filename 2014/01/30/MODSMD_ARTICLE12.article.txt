## Cardinal returns to Maples Undefeated home record on the line 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
No. 7 Stanford men's volleyball (4-
3, 1-3 MPSF) is finally returning
home this weekend and will be wel
coming Maples Pavilion and its unde
feated home record with open arms.
After a strenuous and disappointing
two weeks on the road in which the
Cardinal lost three very close match
es, Stanford will face No. 6 Long
Beach State (4-3, 3-3) on Friday and
No. 13 Cal State Northridge (2-3,2-2)
on Saturday.
Long Beach State is coming off of
an impressive five-set win over top
ranked Pepperdine, which had yet to
lose a match before facing off against
the 49ers. Long Beach State battled
from behind to win that match at
home. Senior outside hitter Taylor
Crabb had a tremendous match for
Long Beach State and was named the
MPSF player of the week after col
lecting a career-high-tying 24 kills
and a season-high 13 digs. Senior lan
Satterfield had six blocks against
Pepperdine and his massive blocking
ability will be a threat to Stanford re
maining undefeated at home.
Long Beach State's defense is the
element that the Cardinal should re
ally be focusing on when preparing
for Friday's match. Against Pepper
dine, Long Beach State had a season
high 63 digs and 22 blocks. In fact, it
is Long Beach State's blocking power
that is the most impressive, with the
team having out-blocked Pepperdine
22-9.5 in that match. The Cardinal's
strongest offensive players espe
cially senior outside hitters Brian
Cook and Steven Irvin will have to
find away to work around and coun
teract LBSU's blocking.
LBSU holds the advantage
against Stanford in the two teams' all
time series, 44-28. Last season, Stan
ford was swept by LBSU at Maples
and then again at the MPSF Tourna
ment quarterfinals. But while LBSU
holds the advantage in the series and
is coming off a dominating defensive
performance, LBSU has demonstrat-
Ed inconsistency and flaws. Prior to
beating No. 1 Pepperdine, LBSU was
swept at home by No. 4 USC. And
with Stanford's consistent and fierce
play thus far at Maples, the Cardinal
should have a good chance at main
taining its undefeated home record.
After Friday's match against
Long Beach State, the Cardinal will
face Cal State Northridge on Satur
day. Cal State Northridge and LBSU
had opposite results last week, with
Cal State Northridge beating USC
but losing to Pepperdine. The Mata
dors had an impressive win against
No. 4 USC, in which they won in
straight sets. Redshirt freshman
Damani Lenore had a match-high 13
kills for the Matadors and averages
over five kills per set.
However, the service game was
the most critical part of Northridge's
win. The Matadors had nine aces on
the night against the Trojans' zero.
Stanford's service game has been
very strong so far this season, and it
should look to try and outperform the
Matadors on the service line to gain
the upper hand in the match. Stan
ford has the advantage in the two
teams' all time series, 38-36, and each
team beat the other on the road last
season. Stanford will be looking to en
sure that the same does not happen
this season.
Stanford should be confident be
cause it is returning home to play at
Maples, where it has seemed com
fortable and has been successful this
season. This weekend is a key mo
ment for the team's season it is a
chance for the Cardinal to work its
way back towards the No. 1 spot it
held before leaving for its road trip
two weeks ago. Both Friday's match
against Long Beach State and Satur
day's match against Cal State North
ridge will begin at 7 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.
