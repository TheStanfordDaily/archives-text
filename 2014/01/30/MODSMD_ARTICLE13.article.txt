# OPINIONS
## Financial Needs and Deeds 
### Uttara Sivaram 
It's about time someone rolled a
keg down to the Career Devel
opment Center. The grad stu
dents at Munger have already de
vised a drinking game for every
time they spot a nervous under
grad shuffling past the Haas Cen
ter, clutching a soggy resume in one
hand and a copy of The Econo
mist in the other. There's no
doubt about it jobs season is in
full swing here at Stanford, and it
affects everyone, whether you're a
CDC regular or just a supportive
friend who knows the interview
loop byway of osmosis.
I myself probably helped a few
amused Munger-ites get a little
more tipsy when I moseyed over to
East Campus, memorizing the
perfect stock pitch and trying to
remember a time when I worked
well in a team. This is the first time
I've gone through this bizarre
process: Last year, I was hired via
Skype and based in the Bay, where
jeans and the obligatory Dropbox
tee can go a long way.
In all seriousness, I've never
been quite so astounded by a cam
pus trend, especially since I myself
can admit to having a (minor) role
in this mass exodus to Wall Street.
As I walk through it myself ac
companied by a good chunk of my
graduating class I've had plenty
of time and inspiration to think
about the Fabulous Finance Fad,
or more fondly, the FFF. Which
means, of course, that I must
choose my words very carefully
accompanied, perhaps, by a good
analogy.
Each year, about three percent
of high school basketball players
(male and female) are recruited to
play in college. Of those, a stagger
ing one percent make it to the
pros, where they will get to
schmooze with Leßron on the
court and Beyonce off it. As early
as the transition between high
school to college, the prep-to-pros
filtration system is deadly for
these players you really have to
love the sport a great deal to not
hate the numbers. Basketball is
not unlike competitive graduate
programs with two or three-per
cent admissions rates in truth,
both systems are incredibly simi
lar and selective, and pump out ex
perts in basketball, medicine, law,
etc. who are the very best in their
fields.
It's not a perfect parallel to the
FFF, but it'll work; having made it
to Stanford, starting in mid-No
vember, we also began ascending
to the second tier of selectivity
when we started applying to the
big firms the big consulting and
banking firms that sit in the East,
where the weather is miserable
enough to actually warrant wear
ing a suit every day.
It's true: We're not orthodox
candidates for these firms, mostly
because of the number of flip-flops
that we own, but also because
many California natives (like my
self) have grown up with our heads
in the sand, far away from the
trading floor. Thus far, we've been
out of sight and out of mind.
But there's no denying the val
ue of a student who can think ana
lytically, a student creative and tal
ented enough to innovate a new
satellite or successful mobile app.
There's no reason Stanford stu
dents can't be useful in finance
putting our naivete aside, the skills

we've honed from growing up in a
world of sprawling creativity are
valuable, and more importantly,
profitable.
But like the NBA, it's a num
bers game. At the end of the day,
only the best will be recruited to
the best. We all know the names:
Sorgan Manly, GCB, Ainßay.
The problem is: Here at Stan
ford, we're all pretty great
smart, driven, and in some cases,
beautiful so the label "best" is
n't quite as easily acquired or de
fined as when we were in high
school and had two important
numbers to our name or when
our athletic talent could be aggre
gated into points-per-game aver
ages.
The thing is, these firms don't
mind much —it doesn't really
matter that Joe wrote his thesis on
counterterrorism in Afghanistan
or that Susan specializes in string
theory. What matters is that both
Joe and Susan will learn how to op
timize a stock portfolio a lot quick
er than most new recruits. Raw in
telligence, pure IQ, aptitude that
can be quantified and stacked
against others that's what re
cruiters come here for.
And that's the great thing
about attending a brand-name
school like Stanford. Here, we can
excel laterally, without necessarily
stepping on each other's toes for
the sake of a rank. I'll make the
bold statement that we didn't
come to Stanford to yet again scale
and clamber over our peers to suc
ceed. We don't and shouldn't have
to.
There has to be a reason we
chose Stanford beyond the finan
cial industry. Looking beyond re
cruiting season, I really do believe
that if Wall Street is your destina
tion, virtually all roads will take
you there. But other options still
exist. Placing too much stock (pun
intended) on firms that want the
best only for the sake of having the
"best" renders that choice in col
leges that you had, however many
years ago, somewhat null. I thank
my lucky stars every day that I'm
not a great basketball player al
though I had my moments in Bth
grade EE. because I can't imag
ine wanting and doing the same
thing so damn much for so damn
long. I usually don't even like my
choice in groceries the day after I
buy them.
I don't write this to discourage
or dissuade anyone from applying
to these firms. They're big, excit
ing and pay extraordinarily well
plus, I might've sneaked my own
application through. But I'd like to
caution against spending too much
valuable time on campus thinking
about life off campus, drinking
martinis in the Big Apple and run
ning into Taylor Swift in Central
Park. We have much better apples
and plenty of our own celebrities to
toast to here, in California.
More importantly, it's essential
to always keep in mind the reason
we came here in the first place
to pick a great major and learn
everything we can about it, assist
ed by the greatest professors and
students in the world. The stock
market may not wait on anyone,
but I think we can afford to let it
wait for us.
