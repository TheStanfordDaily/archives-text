# Slipping through the Cracks, Part II: WhY(2E2) So Serious?
## 
### Haley Sims 
In Part I of this column, we
delved into the cosmetic errors
in the Yang-Yamazaki Environ
ment and Engineering Building
(Y2E2) and maybe even learned a
bit about all the shortcomings of the
building process shortcomings
for which Stanford has simultane
ously been on the forefront of pro
viding solutions to.
I've already taken two classes
showcasing different tools and or
ganization strategies that can make
construction much less painful and
incredibly more efficient. What do
these look like and why are they not
being put into use right here on the
Farm?
Technologies like new computer
programs and cloud sharing allow
everyone involved in a project to
holistically see the design process,
as well as track changes in real
time. Furthermore, it is now becom
ing more and more common to have
meetings amongst all the different
stakeholders in a project engi
neers, architects, the project owner,
and so on which opens up lines of
communication even further.

The building process has even
evolved to the point where many
projects include a person who ex
plicitly oversees how the project is
run: a project manager who makes
sure every party is doing their work
properly and, critically, under
stands the guiding goals of any giv
en building project.
These new ideas about informa
tion flow and overall management
are really powerful and have been
proven to work. And while they are
new, they have been around for
longer than Y2E2 itself.
Judging from the sheer amount
of mistakes made in Y2E2 and from
further discussion with its project
engineer, Forest Peterson, it's pret
ty obvious that these organizational
strategies were not employed on
the project. Apparently, contractor
Hathaway Dinwiddie did not even
draw up a work schedule for the
project, a serious mistake. This
means that there was a lack of guid
ance for the construction as a
whole, opening the door to lots of
delays—which was of course the
result. Even after rushing to the
finish, at completion the Y2E2 proj
ect was 60 to 90 days late.
Furthermore, the group used
two different sets of plans for the
project. One group of plans simply
had the building plans while the
other also contained requests for in
formation (RFIs).
These RFIs are basically ques
tions any stakeholder has about
anything in the plans that might be
confusing or unclear. Having these
requests integrated into the plan
set would seem to be pretty impor
tant. And yet two different plans,
containing two different sets of in
formation, were used for Y2E2. It
naturally makes sense that mis
takes would arise on this project
and that it would end up finishing

behind schedule.
But why should something like
this be allowed to happen on a proj
ect at Stanford? Considering that
Stanford has been at the forefront
of the revolution in the building in
dustry, as well as the fact that these
modern techniques are currently
taught to 20-year-olds here, this is,
in my not so humble opinion, unac
ceptable.
Of course, Stanford probably did
not have as much control over the
project as I assume. After hiring a
contractor, the building process
may have been entirely out of the
University's hands. However, with
all of the knowledge and innovation
we as a university possess, aren't
we obligated to be an active part of
it? Yes, we are and especially
when it concerns something this
close to home (indeed, we literally
cannot get closer), the construction
of the actual campus.
While I don't know exactly how
construction projects at Stanford
are managed, it seems that there
is something stopping us from con
necting all the dots. Is there some
one from Stanford who understands
the building industry as well as
the importance of integrating all
parts of the project with clear
stakeholder oversight? I know for a
fact that there is I've been
taught by a couple of them. But why
is their expertise not being utilized
effectively? What kind of adminis
trative disconnect is allowing this
wealth of knowledge to slip through
the cracks?
It is worth noting that many of
the errors encountered in the con
struction of Y2E2 have been avoid
ed or fixed during the construction
of other buildings in the Engineer
ing Quad namely, Y2E2's mirror
image, Building 4, which will hold
the departments of Bioengineering
and Chemical Engineering. A new
contractor was brought in to man
age the project, and a more collabo
rative design and construction
process seems to have taken place.
These advances, however, need
to become the norm. If Stanford is
as committed to sustainability as it
advertises, then it truly needs to
take more ownership in the modifi
cation and beautification of the
place we all call home.

Furthermore, the group used
two different sets of plans for the
project. One group of plans simply
had the building plans while the
other also contained requests for in
formation (RFIs).
These RFIs are basically ques
tions any stakeholder has about
anything in the plans that might be
confusing or unclear. Having these
requests integrated into the plan
set would seem to be pretty impor
tant. And yet two different plans,
containing two different sets of in
formation, were used for Y2E2. It
naturally makes sense that mis
takes would arise on this project
and that it would end up finishing

behind schedule.
But why should something like
this be allowed to happen on a proj
ect at Stanford? Considering that
Stanford has been at the forefront
of the revolution in the building in
dustry, as well as the fact that these
modern techniques are currently
taught to 20-year-olds here, this is,
in my not so humble opinion, unac
ceptable.
Of course, Stanford probably did
not have as much control over the
project as I assume. After hiring a
contractor, the building process
may have been entirely out of the
University's hands. However, with
all of the knowledge and innovation
we as a university possess, aren't
we obligated to be an active part of
it? Yes, we are and especially
when it concerns something this
close to home (indeed, we literally
cannot get closer), the construction
of the actual campus.
While I don't know exactly how
construction projects at Stanford
are managed, it seems that there
is something stopping us from con
necting all the dots. Is there some
one from Stanford who understands
the building industry as well as
the importance of integrating all
parts of the project with clear
stakeholder oversight? I know for a
fact that there is I've been
taught by a couple of them. But why
is their expertise not being utilized
effectively? What kind of adminis
trative disconnect is allowing this
wealth of knowledge to slip through
the cracks?
It is worth noting that many of
the errors encountered in the con
struction of Y2E2 have been avoid
ed or fixed during the construction
of other buildings in the Engineer
ing Quad namely, Y2E2's mirror
image, Building 4, which will hold
the departments of Bioengineering
and Chemical Engineering. A new
contractor was brought in to man
age the project, and a more collabo
rative design and construction
process seems to have taken place.
These advances, however, need
to become the norm. If Stanford is
as committed to sustainability as it
advertises, then it truly needs to
take more ownership in the modifi
cation and beautification of the
place we all call home.

Two different plans,
containing two
different sets of
information, were
used for Y2E2.
In Part I of this column, we
delved into the cosmetic errors
in the Yang-Yamazaki Environ
ment and Engineering Building
(Y2E2) and maybe even learned a
bit about all the shortcomings of the
building process shortcomings
for which Stanford has simultane
ously been on the forefront of pro
viding solutions to.
I've already taken two classes
showcasing different tools and or
ganization strategies that can make
construction much less painful and
incredibly more efficient. What do
these look like and why are they not
being put into use right here on the
Farm?
Technologies like new computer
programs and cloud sharing allow
everyone involved in a project to
holistically see the design process,
as well as track changes in real
time. Furthermore, it is now becom
ing more and more common to have
meetings amongst all the different
stakeholders in a project engi
neers, architects, the project owner,
and so on which opens up lines of
communication even further.

The building process has even
evolved to the point where many
projects include a person who ex
plicitly oversees how the project is
run: a project manager who makes
sure every party is doing their work
properly and, critically, under
stands the guiding goals of any giv
en building project.
These new ideas about informa
tion flow and overall management
are really powerful and have been
proven to work. And while they are
new, they have been around for
longer than Y2E2 itself.
Judging from the sheer amount
of mistakes made in Y2E2 and from
further discussion with its project
engineer, Forest Peterson, it's pret
ty obvious that these organizational
strategies were not employed on
the project. Apparently, contractor
Hathaway Dinwiddie did not even
draw up a work schedule for the
project, a serious mistake. This
means that there was a lack of guid
ance for the construction as a
whole, opening the door to lots of
delays—which was of course the
result. Even after rushing to the
finish, at completion the Y2E2 proj
ect was 60 to 90 days late.
