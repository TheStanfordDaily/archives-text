## Stanford team to travel into zero gravity 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Paul Warren 'l7 called up his team
mates as soon as he heard the news.
With a team consisting of five other
Stanford students and two faculty advis
ers, Warren had spent five days in Novem
ber rushing to complete a comprehensive,
nearly 30-page proposal. If selected, the
group would fly out to Houston and partic
ipate in a weeklong NASA program, which
gives college undergraduates the opportu
nity to conduct an experiment aboard an
airplane flight that imitates zero-gravity

conditions.
Days into winter break, a NASA official
phoned Warren to deliver its verdict.
"I actually ended up missing the call the
first time," Warren said.
Eventually, the two parties connected,
and Warren didn't take long to give the
news to the rest of the group, including
Sam Beder 'l3 M.S. 'l4.
"I was out with someone, and I literally
started dancing in the street because you
get this phone call saying that you get to
experience zero gravity," Beder said. "And
I consider that the coolest thing ever."
The team is the first in Stanford's his-

Tory to be chosen for NASA's Reduced
Gravity Student Flight Opportunities Pro
gram, Warren said. Its members will spend
April 4-12 at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, testing to see whether a compact,
user-friendly medical device will work in a
zero gravity environment.
Currently, the team is attempting to
scrounge up the funds to cover travel ex
penses. Beder said the group needs to
amass at least $B,OOO-$12,000, but would
like to raise even more in order to finance
youth outreach events in surrounding com-
