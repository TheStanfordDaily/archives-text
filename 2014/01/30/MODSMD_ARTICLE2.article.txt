## Stanford team to travel into zero gravity 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Paul Warren 'l7 called up his team
mates as soon as he heard the news.
With a team consisting of five other
Stanford students and two faculty advis
ers, Warren had spent five days in Novem
ber rushing to complete a comprehensive,
nearly 30-page proposal. If selected, the
group would fly out to Houston and partic
ipate in a weeklong NASA program, which
gives college undergraduates the opportu
nity to conduct an experiment aboard an
airplane flight that imitates zero-gravity

conditions.
Days into winter break, a NASA official
phoned Warren to deliver its verdict.
"I actually ended up missing the call the
first time," Warren said.
Eventually, the two parties connected,
and Warren didn't take long to give the
news to the rest of the group, including
Sam Beder 'l3 M.S. 'l4.
"I was out with someone, and I literally
started dancing in the street because you
get this phone call saying that you get to
experience zero gravity," Beder said. "And
I consider that the coolest thing ever."
The team is the first in Stanford's his-

Tory to be chosen for NASA's Reduced
Gravity Student Flight Opportunities Pro
gram, Warren said. Its members will spend
April 4-12 at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, testing to see whether a compact,
user-friendly medical device will work in a
zero gravity environment.
Currently, the team is attempting to
scrounge up the funds to cover travel ex
penses. Beder said the group needs to
amass at least $B,OOO-$12,000, but would
like to raise even more in order to finance
youth outreach events in surrounding com-

munities.
Earlier this month, for in
stance, Warren spoke at a
TEDx event at Gunn High
School.
"It was nice," Warren said
about delivering the speech.
"I obviously still get nervous
and stuff, but I got to talk to
300 high schoolers, in front
of faculty and community
members, and people actual
ly took me seriously."

The mentor
Peter Lee, an assistant
professor of cardiac surgery
at Ohio State University, was
not surprised at the Stan
ford team's selection in De
cember.
"I have to say I was pret
ty confident that [the team]
would get accepted," said
Lee, who has led eight previ
ous teams at Brown and
Harvard to participate in the
NASA program. "In terms
of the interest that NASA
would have... we really put
together a serious proposal
that would benefit the space
program."
A year ago, news broke
that Lee, then a Stanford
heart surgeon, had won a re
search competition. His joint
proposal was to study
weightlessness on the hearts
of fruit flies in the Interna

tional Space Center. Soon af
ter, Stanford students start
ed contacting Lee much
more frequently expressing
interest in studying
aeromedicine, he said.
He remembered several
of these students when the
deadline for NASA's Re
duced Gravity Student
Flight Opportunities came
around this November.
Lee said he thought the
program would be a good op
portunity to work with un
dergraduates as well as test
a project that he had been
mulling over the year prior.
Recognizing a limited
ability to deal with medical
emergencies in space, Lee
thought about a piece of
technology currently uti
lized in Intensive Care
Units for real-life cardiac
monitoring: the hemody
namic transesophageal
echocardiogram (hTEE).
The device is small and
user-friendly, potentially
perfect for astronauts on a
long-duration space mission.
"[The hTEE] can be used
with very little training: You
get not as good, but reason
ably good pictures of the
heart, and so our proposal is
basically to demonstrate
that this smaller, miniatur
ized [device] can be inserted
into a mannequin and give
you good images of the heart
and can be used for train
ing," Lee said.
Lee approached Warren
and David Gerson 'l4 M.S.

'l4, a co-founder of the Stan
ford Student Space Initiative
(SSI), with the idea of sub
mitting a proposal to test the
device in zero-gravity condi
tions.
"I love teaching and
working with students," Lee
said about participating in
the program for the ninth
time. "Plus, it's also being
able to contribute to the
space program." "Every
experiment that we conduct
that is successful and that we
can publish, we add to the
fount of knowledge that the
space program can use as
part of space exploration,"
he added.

Democratizing space
After quickly rounding
up a team through the SSI
mailing list, Warren
launched a five-day effort to
churn out a proposal before
the early November dead
line. Many of the team mem
bers had never met each oth
er previously and came from
both the freshman and sen
ior class.
"The team's a lot of fun,"
Gerson said. "Everyone
brings a ton of energy. They
are extremely hard-working,
incredibly smart and really,
really driven."
"I mean we pulled the
proposal together in five
days. We were super excited
and stayed up super late," he
added.
Warren, a freshman, is
the team leader. He said his

initial interest in space
stemmed from his childhood
love of Orson Scott Card's
novel "Ender's Game."
Now, the possibilities for
democratizing space inspire
him.
"When you talk about
space missions, you talk
about multimillion, multibil
lion space missions," Warren
said. "One thing we want to
try to do here is try to make
space available to everyone
... It follows the Silicon Val
ley mindset of building a lot
cheaply and making it acces
sible to a lot of people."
Right now, the team is
preparing and excited
for their April flight.
"We actually have to build
the thing, which isn't actual
ly that complicated," Gerson
said. "I think it's more com
plicated figuring out how ex
actly we are going to put
everything together: making
a base, wiring some batter
ies, and then strapping the
mannequin down and attach
ing the HD monitor."
He added that the biggest
challenge will be figuring out
how exactly they will accom
plish their goals and what
they will do during the trip.
"But I'm excited for it,"
Gerson said. "It's going to be
fun. Everyone who had been
on a zero-g flight always
talks about it... So I'm su
per stoked."
