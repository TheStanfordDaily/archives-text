## Stanford, Cal players host LGBT inclusion panel 
### SAMANTHA NEUBER 
Students, student-athletes and others from the
Stanford community gathered at Burnham Pavilion
Wednesday night for We A.R.E. (Athletes Reaching
Equality) Pride an evening of art displays and a
panel discussion on LGBT inclusion among ath
letes.
Organized by members of the Stanford and UC-
Berkeley women's basketball teams, Toni Kokenis
'l4 and Mikayla Lyles respectively, the panel event
and art show were part of a weeklong initiative that
seeks to promote safe and supportive communities
for LGBT athletes, as well as raise awareness of
LGBT issues in sports.
Panelists at Wednesday's event included Pat
Griffin, founding director for Changing the Game:
The Gay and Lesbian Straight Education Network
(GLSEN) Sports Project; Wade Davis, former
NFL player and LGBT activist and educator; He
len Carroll, director of the National Center for Les
bian Right's Sports Project and Nevin Caple, co
founder of the Brjache the Silence Campaign.
Kokenis one of the co-founders of Stanford
Athletes and Allies Together (StAAT) noted that
organizations both within and outside of the Stan
ford community have been supportive and helpful
in putting on the week's programming. Sponsors in
clude the Stanford Athletic Department, the Cal
Athletic Department, You Can
Play and the Weiland Health
Initiative, among others.
Right before Wednesday
evening's featured program
ming, guests were able to
view a collection of photo
graphs featuring student
athletes from Stanford and
UC-Berkeley hanging out to
gether. The images part of
a project by visual artist Mol
lie McClure promoted in
clusion and acceptance,
which both Lyles and Koke
nis hoped to emulate in set
ting aside the Cal and Stan
ford rivalry to co-coordinate
the week's events.
"There's no symbol more
powerful than bringing to
gether two rivals," Kokenis
said.
The night's formal pro
gramming kicked off with
the screening of a video mon
tage of short clips of promi
nent figures in both athletic
and LGBT communities ex
pressing their support and
opinions about LGBT inclu
sion in sports.

The montage was fol
lowed by a short documen
tary, "Crossing the Line," by
Hillary Streeter 'l4 on homo
phobia and gender stereo
types in sports at Stanford.
The film made possible by
a grant from the Bingham
Fund for Student Innovation
in Human Biology fea
tured individual interviews
with a range of Stanford stu
dent-athletes across all
sports and genders, dis
cussing stereotypes about
their sports, and the conse
quences of these preconcep
tions of gender and sexuality
The evening culminated
with the panel discussion and
a Q&A with the audience.
The discussion centered on
the importance of fostering a
safe, respectful and open en
vironment in athletics and
acceptance of all facets of
one's identity
"One of the other really
important intersections we
need to pay attention to
when we're talking about
LGBT issues in sports is that
we all know we're not just
our sexual orientation; we're
also many, many other things
that make up the cluster of
who we are," Griffin said,
mentioning race as one of the

additionally important as
pects within the LGBT com
munity.
While issues regarding
the more difficult challenges
currently facing LGBT ath
letes were raised, the real fo
cus of the talk and night was
one of positivity and support.
Davis emphasized the ne
cessity of acceptance and
support on both sides of the
issue when he discussed the
importance of willingness to
find a common ground. He
explained how the best tactic
to help an individual or or
ganization foster a more in
clusive and safe environment
or eliminate homophobia
is to work with the indi
vidual or organization, rather
than accuse them and expect
them to be receptive.
In terms of LGBT inclu
sion specific to Stanford, Ko
kenis noted that while Stan
ford has made a lot of
progress in LGBT inclusion
in sports, athletics still seems
to be less of a safe space as
the rest of the Stanford com
munity.
The weeklong initiative
will come to a close after a di
versity inclusion workshop
for high school students and
a youth teamwork clinic held

later in the week.
However, Kokenis and
Lyles certainly don't see this
as the end.
"We're planning on not
having this be a one-time
deal," Kokenis said, who
hopes this type of event will
spread to other colleges and
universities throughout the
country.

The discussion centered on
the importance of fostering a
safe, respectful and open en
vironment in athletics and
acceptance of all facets of
one's identity
"One of the other really
important intersections we
need to pay attention to
when we're talking about
LGBT issues in sports is that
we all know we're not just
our sexual orientation; we're
also many, many other things
that make up the cluster of
who we are," Griffin said,
mentioning race as one of the

additionally important as
pects within the LGBT com
munity.
While issues regarding
the more difficult challenges
currently facing LGBT ath
letes were raised, the real fo
cus of the talk and night was
one of positivity and support.
Davis emphasized the ne
cessity of acceptance and
support on both sides of the
issue when he discussed the
importance of willingness to
find a common ground. He
explained how the best tactic
to help an individual or or
ganization foster a more in
clusive and safe environment
or eliminate homophobia
is to work with the indi
vidual or organization, rather
than accuse them and expect
them to be receptive.
In terms of LGBT inclu
sion specific to Stanford, Ko
kenis noted that while Stan
ford has made a lot of
progress in LGBT inclusion
in sports, athletics still seems
to be less of a safe space as
the rest of the Stanford com
munity.
The weeklong initiative
will come to a close after a di
versity inclusion workshop
for high school students and
a youth teamwork clinic held

later in the week.
However, Kokenis and
Lyles certainly don't see this
as the end.
"We're planning on not
having this be a one-time
deal," Kokenis said, who
hopes this type of event will
spread to other colleges and
universities throughout the
country.

the screening of a video mon
tage of short clips of promi
nent figures in both athletic
and LGBT communities ex
pressing their support and
opinions about LGBT inclu

with a range of Stanford stu
dent-athletes across all
sports and genders, dis
cussing stereotypes about
their sports, and the conse
quences of these preconcep
tions of gender and sexuality
The evening culminated
with the panel discussion and
a Q&A with the audience.
