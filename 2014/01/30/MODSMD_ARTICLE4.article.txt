### â€“ Catherine Zaw 
Pat Hanrahan, professor of
computer science and co-founder
of Tableau Software, was awarded
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences'
annual Scientific and Technical
Awards Presentation for the third
time in his career.
He will be officially honored at
The Beverly Hills Hotel in mid-
February.
Hanrahan will be recognized
for his work in physically based
rendering, which lends greater
flexibility for digital artists in
cinematography and allows com
puter graphics to more accurate
ly simulate materials and lights.
Hanrahan also co-authored a
textbook, "Physically Based Ren
dering," in 2004, which is widely
used as a roadmap for source
code implementation for comput
er graphics.
In the past, Hanrahan has
worked at Pixar Animation Stu
dios and was the chief architect of
the Render Man Interface, which
eases the digital communication
between modeling programs and
high quality rendering programs.
