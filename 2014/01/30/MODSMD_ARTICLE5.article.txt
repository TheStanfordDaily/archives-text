New Stanford information se
curity measures are underway, in
cluding a modified and more versa
tile two-step authentication system
to be deployed this year, according
to Michael Duff, assistant vice
president and chief information of
ficer.
Duff said that the University
has secured a campus-wide license
with a third party vendor to make
the two-step authentication process
more flexible with new options
such as SUNet ID users receiving
push notifications on their phones
through an app where they can tap
"yes" or "no" to login, thereby
avoiding having to type in a six-dig-
it code number into Web L
ogin a system that current
has drawn ire from some
students.
Other information secu

rity measures currently on
the table include mandates
for University employees
outlined in a community
email from Randy Liv
ingston '75 M.B.A. '79, vice
president for business af
fairs and chief financial offi
cer, earlier this month.
One of these mandates
includes having employees

with Windows XP laptops
and desktops migrate to
Windows 7 Enterprise or
Ultimate, or Windows 8
Pro or Enterprise, by April
8. Employees will be able to
download the latest Mi
crosoft software for free un
der a new campus-wide li
cense obtained in November
2013.

Duff explained that stu
dents are also able to take
advantage of the new Mi
crosoft license and are en
couraged to download the
latest software for free as
well.
In terms of updates from
the July 2013 breach, Duff
said that further investiga
tions from the Information
Security Office and Mandi
ant an external forensics
firm found no evidence to
indicate that compromised
encoded SUNet password
information was decoded
and/or used in any way.
He added that IT admin
istrators were able to detect
an initial attack on the cen
tral Microsoft account infra
structure within 12 hours
when a second sever
crashed.
Since the July breach,
the University identified 33
security initiatives that will
continue to be worked on
over the next two years.
