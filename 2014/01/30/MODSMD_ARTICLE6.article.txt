# NO MAPLES MAGIC
## OFFENSE STALLS IN HEARTBREAKER 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
So close, yet so far. The
Stanford men's basketball
team battled wire-to-wire
with the best team in the
country, the No. 1 Arizona
Wildcats (21-0, 8-0 Pac-12),
on Wednesday night, but fell
just short, 60-57. With the
win, Arizona extended its
school-record winning streak
to 21 games.

"That was a heck of a bas
ketball game by both teams,"
said Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "I thought
our young men came out and
gave a heck of an effort. For
38 minutes, I thought we
were right there."

In perhaps the most elec
tric basketball atmosphere in
side of Maples Pavilion in a
half-decade, the Cardinal (13-
7, 4-4) matched the physicali
ty of the Wildcats for all 40
minutes in front of 7,233 roar
ing fans the largest crowd
at Maples since March 2010, a
span of 63 home games. It
was Stanford's offensive exe
cution that doomed it down
