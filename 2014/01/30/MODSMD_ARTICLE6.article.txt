# NO MAPLES MAGIC
## OFFENSE STALLS IN HEARTBREAKER 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN DESK EDITOR 
So close, yet so far. The
Stanford men's basketball
team battled wire-to-wire
with the best team in the
country, the No. 1 Arizona
Wildcats (21-0, 8-0 Pac-12),
on Wednesday night, but fell
just short, 60-57. With the
win, Arizona extended its
school-record winning streak
to 21 games.

"That was a heck of a bas
ketball game by both teams,"
said Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "I thought
our young men came out and
gave a heck of an effort. For
38 minutes, I thought we
were right there."

In perhaps the most elec
tric basketball atmosphere in
side of Maples Pavilion in a
half-decade, the Cardinal (13-
7, 4-4) matched the physicali
ty of the Wildcats for all 40
minutes in front of 7,233 roar
ing fans the largest crowd
at Maples since March 2010, a
span of 63 home games. It
was Stanford's offensive exe
cution that doomed it down

the stretch, as the Cardinal scored
just one field goal in the final 10
minutes of the game.
"They're one of the best de
fenses in our conference and in the
nation," Dawkins said. "I thought
our guys did a good job of trying
to take it to them, and also in the
post, as well as drives, but you
have to finish."
Stanford started quickly,
spurred by energy from the Sixth
Man Club and strong interior post
play by senior center Stefan Nas
tic, who scored four quick points in
the opening minutes of the game to
give Stanford an immediate 9-2 ad
vantage. Arizona clawed its way
back after holding Stanford score
less over the next four minutes to
gain a 10-9 advantage with 11:59
remaining in the first half.
The Wildcats gained their
largest lead of the game, 21-16, on
an and-one by center Kaleb Tar
czewski with 8:09 left in the half,
before the Cardinal came roaring
back. The awakening of Stan
ford's leading scorer, junior Chas
son Randle, gave Stanford the of
fensive boost it needed towards
the end of the half, and his 3-
pointer with 54 seconds to play in
the frame drew Stanford within
one. After another defensive stop,
senior Anthony Brown hit a mag
nificent running bank shot over a
pair of defenders to give Stanford
the lead and the momentum going
into halftime.
The Cardinal came out with
guns blazing to start the second
half. Arizona junior guard Nick
Johnson, the Pac-12 Player of the
Year candidate who was repeated
ly the thorn in the Cardinal's side,
hit a three on the first possession

of the half for the Wildcats. After
that, Stanford embarked on an 18-
9 run over a six-minute stretch to
put the nation's top team on the
ropes. The Cardinal led 49-42 with
13:15 left to play, and the magic in
Maples was alive and well.
But from there, Stanford's of
fense went ice-cold. After senior
forward Josh Huestis hit a
jumper to push the Stanford lead
back to four with 10:03 remaining,
the Cardinal went scoreless until
the 1:21 mark. Still, the Cardinal
was down just two when senior
forward Dwight Powell swooped
in from the left baseline for a re
verse layup that proved to be the
prettiest offensive play of the
evening.
Stanford again defended well
on the next possession, until a
long rebound to Tarczweski pro
vided the dagger for Arizona. The
sophomore center kicked it out to
Johnson, who nailed a three from
the top of the key with 51 seconds
remaining to give Arizona a 3-
point lead.
"Give the young man credit,"
said Dawkins. "As I said earlier,
you still have to make the shot,
and he stepped up and he did
that."
The Cardinal couldn't answer
on its next possession and was
forced to foul Johnson with 28 sec
onds left. He missed the front end
of a one-and-one, but Huestis
missed a 3-point attempt for the
tie. Stanford fouled again, this
time sending freshman Aaron
Gordon to the line, and unbeliev
ably, he too missed his first free
throw. Arizona elected to foul
Stanford rather than allow the
Cardinal a 3-point attempt, and

Randle calmly sunk both of his
free throws to pull the home team
back within one.
Johnson was fouled again and
this time made both of his at
tempts with 5.8 seconds remain
ing. Randle got a decent look at a
3-point attempt as time wound
down, but the ball clanked off the
rim to preserve the victory for
Arizona.
"I thought I got a good look at
it, but you know, it was just one of
those nights," Randle said.
In the loss for Stanford,
Huestis finished with 13 points
and 11 rebounds, while Powell
added 13 and 6, respectively. Ran
dle struggled to the tune of 3-for
-15 shooting and was just 5-for-8
from the line.
Johnson led all scorers for
Arizona with 16 points while fel
low backcourt mate T.J. Mc-
Connell added 11.
In many ways, the Cardinal
played uncharacteristically well,
particularly on the defensive end.
Arizona was held to just 36 per
cent shooting, its lowest shooting
percentage of the season, and
Gordon, a projected lottery pick
in the upcoming NBA Draft, was
held to just five points on 2-for-10
shooting. Stanford showed tough
ness on the boards, outrebound
ing the Wildcats 38-36, just the
third time this season that any
opponent had outrebounded the
No. 1 team in the land.
But as has often been charac
teristic of the Dawkins era, Stan
ford did just enough to lose. The
scoring drought over the final 10
minutes of the game showed a lack
of execution by the players, but it
also meant that the coaching staff
was unable to find a solution to a
problem that lasted for much of a
half.
"It's just a matter of getting
our spots on the court quickly and
just moving the ball and making
sharp cuts," Randle said.
"We let them move us off our
spots where we wanted to go of
fensively," Huestis remarked.
This tough loss echoes a trou
bling trend evident throughout
the Cardinal's season: On off
shooting nights, Dawkins and his
staff have rarely found away to
provide their players with a go-to
offensive strategy.
Stanford will hope to bounce
back quickly in anticipation of Ari
zona State's visit on Saturday. Tip
off is set for 1 p.m.

SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
Senior forward Dwight Powell (center) was limited to 23 minutes due to early foul trouble.
Despite facing an aggressive Arizona defense, he finished with 13 points and 6 rebounds.
the stretch, as the Cardinal scored
just one field goal in the final 10
minutes of the game.
"They're one of the best de
fenses in our conference and in the
nation," Dawkins said. "I thought
our guys did a good job of trying
to take it to them, and also in the
post, as well as drives, but you
have to finish."
Stanford started quickly,
spurred by energy from the Sixth
Man Club and strong interior post
play by senior center Stefan Nas
tic, who scored four quick points in
the opening minutes of the game to
give Stanford an immediate 9-2 ad
vantage. Arizona clawed its way
back after holding Stanford score
less over the next four minutes to
gain a 10-9 advantage with 11:59
remaining in the first half.
The Wildcats gained their
largest lead of the game, 21-16, on
an and-one by center Kaleb Tar
czewski with 8:09 left in the half,
before the Cardinal came roaring
back. The awakening of Stan
ford's leading scorer, junior Chas
son Randle, gave Stanford the of
fensive boost it needed towards
the end of the half, and his 3-
pointer with 54 seconds to play in
the frame drew Stanford within
one. After another defensive stop,
senior Anthony Brown hit a mag
nificent running bank shot over a
pair of defenders to give Stanford
the lead and the momentum going
into halftime.
The Cardinal came out with
guns blazing to start the second
half. Arizona junior guard Nick
Johnson, the Pac-12 Player of the
Year candidate who was repeated
ly the thorn in the Cardinal's side,
hit a three on the first possession

of the half for the Wildcats. After
that, Stanford embarked on an 18-
9 run over a six-minute stretch to
put the nation's top team on the
ropes. The Cardinal led 49-42 with
13:15 left to play, and the magic in
Maples was alive and well.
But from there, Stanford's of
fense went ice-cold. After senior
forward Josh Huestis hit a
jumper to push the Stanford lead
back to four with 10:03 remaining,
the Cardinal went scoreless until
the 1:21 mark. Still, the Cardinal
was down just two when senior
forward Dwight Powell swooped
in from the left baseline for a re
verse layup that proved to be the
prettiest offensive play of the
evening.
Stanford again defended well
on the next possession, until a
long rebound to Tarczweski pro
vided the dagger for Arizona. The
sophomore center kicked it out to
Johnson, who nailed a three from
the top of the key with 51 seconds
remaining to give Arizona a 3-
point lead.
"Give the young man credit,"
said Dawkins. "As I said earlier,
you still have to make the shot,
and he stepped up and he did
that."
The Cardinal couldn't answer
on its next possession and was
forced to foul Johnson with 28 sec
onds left. He missed the front end
of a one-and-one, but Huestis
missed a 3-point attempt for the
tie. Stanford fouled again, this
time sending freshman Aaron
Gordon to the line, and unbeliev
ably, he too missed his first free
throw. Arizona elected to foul
Stanford rather than allow the
Cardinal a 3-point attempt, and

Randle calmly sunk both of his
free throws to pull the home team
back within one.
Johnson was fouled again and
this time made both of his at
tempts with 5.8 seconds remain
ing. Randle got a decent look at a
3-point attempt as time wound
down, but the ball clanked off the
rim to preserve the victory for
Arizona.
"I thought I got a good look at
it, but you know, it was just one of
those nights," Randle said.
In the loss for Stanford,
Huestis finished with 13 points
and 11 rebounds, while Powell
added 13 and 6, respectively. Ran
dle struggled to the tune of 3-for
-15 shooting and was just 5-for-8
from the line.
Johnson led all scorers for
Arizona with 16 points while fel
low backcourt mate T.J. Mc-
Connell added 11.
In many ways, the Cardinal
played uncharacteristically well,
particularly on the defensive end.
Arizona was held to just 36 per
cent shooting, its lowest shooting
percentage of the season, and
Gordon, a projected lottery pick
in the upcoming NBA Draft, was
held to just five points on 2-for-10
shooting. Stanford showed tough
ness on the boards, outrebound
ing the Wildcats 38-36, just the
third time this season that any
opponent had outrebounded the
No. 1 team in the land.
But as has often been charac
teristic of the Dawkins era, Stan
ford did just enough to lose. The
scoring drought over the final 10
minutes of the game showed a lack
of execution by the players, but it
also meant that the coaching staff
was unable to find a solution to a
problem that lasted for much of a
half.
"It's just a matter of getting
our spots on the court quickly and
just moving the ball and making
sharp cuts," Randle said.
"We let them move us off our
spots where we wanted to go of
fensively," Huestis remarked.
This tough loss echoes a trou
bling trend evident throughout
the Cardinal's season: On off
shooting nights, Dawkins and his
staff have rarely found away to
provide their players with a go-to
offensive strategy.
Stanford will hope to bounce
back quickly in anticipation of Ari
zona State's visit on Saturday. Tip
off is set for 1 p.m.

Junior guard Anthony Brown (bottom) shot just 3-for-9 from the

So close, yet so far. The
Stanford men's basketball
team battled wire-to-wire
with the best team in the
country, the No. 1 Arizona
Wildcats (21-0, 8-0 Pac-12),
on Wednesday night, but fell
just short, 60-57. With the
win, Arizona extended its
school-record winning streak
to 21 games.

"That was a heck of a bas
ketball game by both teams,"
said Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "I thought
our young men came out and
gave a heck of an effort. For
38 minutes, I thought we
were right there."

In perhaps the most elec
tric basketball atmosphere in
side of Maples Pavilion in a
half-decade, the Cardinal (13-

at Maples since March 2010, a
span of 63 home games. It
was Stanford's offensive exe
