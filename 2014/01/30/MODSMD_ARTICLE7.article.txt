### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
"My Fair Lady," the first
student-produced musical the
ater production held in Bing
Concert Hall, opens tomorrow.
Presented jointly by the Asian
American Theater Project and
the Theater and Performance
Studies (TAPS) department,
the musical is a re-imaging of
the classic Broadway show from
the perspective of the British
American immigrant communi
ty in early 20th-century Lon
don.
The Daily spoke with direc
tor Ken Savage 'l4 and costume
designer Asia Chiao 'l5 about
the process and the passion be
hind their work.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why specifically
"My Fair Lady" to use as a re-imagined story?
Ken Savage (KS): "My Fair Lady" is a classic
Broadway musical that everyone or most peo
ple know and absolutely love. The show is so
iconic and it resonates with so many families
that I think first and foremost we wanted to
take a huge, popular musical and tackle it and
figure out how to re-imagine the biggest possi
ble show.
"My Fair Lady" specifically is interesting
because the content is so rich and it is very
much a play about language and class and these
markers of class in defining this social hierar
chy. Intuitively, Asia and I thought, 'Well, why
not throw race into there?' because in our day
and age you cannot separate race and class, and
I feel like language and wealth and appearance
are all markers of not only class but racial class
