## KEN SAVAGE DIRECTOR ASIA CHIAO COSTUME DESIGNER My Fair Lady 
### ILEANA NAJARRO MANAGING EDITOR 
"My Fair Lady," the first
student-produced musical the
ater production held in Bing
Concert Hall, opens tomorrow.
Presented jointly by the Asian
American Theater Project and
the Theater and Performance
Studies (TAPS) department,
the musical is a re-imaging of
the classic Broadway show from
the perspective of the British
American immigrant communi
ty in early 20th-century Lon
don.
The Daily spoke with direc
tor Ken Savage 'l4 and costume
designer Asia Chiao 'l5 about
the process and the passion be
hind their work.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why specifically
"My Fair Lady" to use as a re-imagined story?
Ken Savage (KS): "My Fair Lady" is a classic
Broadway musical that everyone or most peo
ple know and absolutely love. The show is so
iconic and it resonates with so many families
that I think first and foremost we wanted to
take a huge, popular musical and tackle it and
figure out how to re-imagine the biggest possi
ble show.
"My Fair Lady" specifically is interesting
because the content is so rich and it is very
much a play about language and class and these
markers of class in defining this social hierar
chy. Intuitively, Asia and I thought, 'Well, why
not throw race into there?' because in our day
and age you cannot separate race and class, and
I feel like language and wealth and appearance
are all markers of not only class but racial class

in that sense as well.
I think that was what real
ly drew us to "My Fair Lady,"
in wanting to tackle this show
and take a movie and a musi
cal that was traditionally all
white ... and I don't think peo
ple realize that there is a
world and a group of people
that are not white that lived in
London at this time and con
tinue to live in London now.
That is what we wanted to do,
to open this musical and ex
pose audiences to these
worlds and communities that
existed at that time.

TSD: What was it like con
ducting the research to de
sign the costumes for this
production?
Asia Chiao (AC): The re
search behind this process
was much more intensive
than what would typically
happen for an average show
just because the kind of re
search we were interested in
doing specifically focusing
upon Asian immigrant com
munities in London in 1912
[is] an area that has not had a
lot of significant research.
There was not a lot of ma
terial available online which
meant that Ken and I decided
to travel to London over the
summer to do some primary
research on our own. We visit
ed archives at the Victoria
and Albert Museum, at the
Metropolitan Archives and at
the British Library in Lon
don to look at historical pho
tographs, historical drawings,
fashion plates from this peri
od to try and get a sense of
what orientalism meant to the
British community and also
what immigrants in London
were wearing.
TSD: What are some of the
pieces that you're proudest of
from the ensemble of cos
tumes?
AC: I would say Ascot is my
favorite scene with the horse
races, where Eliza presents
herself as a lady for the first
time, just because the hats in
that scene were all handmade
by me and a bunch of other
students here on campus and
all the costumes for that
[scene] were completely de

signed by me. I think the aes
thetic of that scene is very
distinctive and I personally
get very emotional every time
that scene happens just be
cause so much work went into
that scene in particular.
TSD: What were some of the
biggest logistical challenges
in putting together this pro
duction?
KS: At the very beginning of
the process, Asia and I had
planned to do "My Fair Lady"
within the Theater and Per
formance Studies depart
ment here in Piggott Theater
... for my senior project. We
spent around six months de
signing the show, conceptual
izing everything, designing it
for this small theater. What I
found out in the spring of last
year was that unfortunately
we would not be able to get
the space due to a whole
bunch of issues.
It was really upsetting for
me as a student working on
this project for so long with
my co-collaborator to my
have my proposal rejected.

That was a huge blow to us
and so fortunately I've had a
lot of amazing mentors here
on campus, within the depart
ment and outside the depart
ment who really wanted to
see "My Fair Lady" happen
and to see this vision of "My
Fair Lady" come to fruition.
When we sought out Bing,
I think the biggest challenge
for us was we are a group of
undergraduate students,
we're a group that has never
done a production in Bing be
fore despite the fact that
we're all experienced in the
ater and all the different ar
eas of theater, but the biggest
challenge is that something
like this has never happened
... I feel like everyone was
just nervous and wondering
what a musical in Bing would
look like. Despite how scary
that was, I think that was re
ally the exciting thing that
drew everyone to the project.
TSD: How does it feel to be
directing the first student
produced musical theater
production in the Bing Con

cert Hall?
KS: I feel so unbelievably
humbled. I just feel unbeliev
ably proud on behalf of my
cast and crew that we are able
to pioneer the space and re
claim it for students because I
think that space has been dif
ficult for Stanford students to
access because of how expen
sive it is, because there is pro
gramming in there that is ex
citing to some, but not excit
ing to others. I think if any
thing our two sold-out per
formances on Friday are huge
indicators that Stanford stu
dents as audience members
are unbelievably excited to
see this show and are unbe
lievably excited to support
them peers and their friends
in this first musical in Bing.

TSD: What do you hope the
audience can take away from
the production?
AC: I want the audience to
leave the production with a
new sense of what a classical
American musical can look
like. We're so used to envi
sioning certain plays and cer
tain works of art in specific
ways that I want viewers to
be challenged by the way I've
decided to design and inter
pret this performance. And
hopefully for them to come
away with a different under
standing of race and theater
and what it means to look the
way you do on stage.
