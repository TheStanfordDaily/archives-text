# WOMEN'S SWIMMING
## Card makes TV appearance in SoCal 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
The No. 4 Cardinal women's swimming
team (7-0,4-0 Pac-12) will journey into the tel
evision spotlight on Friday as it travels south
to No. 16 UCLA for a meet that will be
broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.
The showdown with the Bruins at noon
is only one of two Stanford women's swim
ming dual meets that will be televised this

year, with the other one coming against five
time Olympic medalist Missy Franklin and
Cal in two weeks.

Although the matchup with UCLA (8-1,
5-1) is a rare chance to catch the Cardinal in
action away from Avery Aquatics Center, it
sets up as a likely win for Stanford. The Car
dinal has fended off the Bruins by identical
30-point margins in each of the teams' last
two meetings, and UCLA has no swimmers
with top-20 times in any of the freestyle or

individual medley (IM) events, two of Stan
ford's strongest areas.
The Cardinal's visit to No. 5 USC (5-0,4-
0) on Sunday, meanwhile, appears much
more intriguing. Ten different events boast a
top-20 swimmer from each team, with three
of those races featuring the swimmers that
own the top times in the country in those
events. And the competition is toughest in
