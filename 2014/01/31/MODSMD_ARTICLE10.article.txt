# WOMEN'S SWIMMING
## Card makes TV appearance in SoCal 
### JOSEPH BEYDA FOOTBALL EDITOR 
The No. 4 Cardinal women's swimming
team (7-0,4-0 Pac-12) will journey into the tel
evision spotlight on Friday as it travels south
to No. 16 UCLA for a meet that will be
broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.
The showdown with the Bruins at noon
is only one of two Stanford women's swim
ming dual meets that will be televised this

year, with the other one coming against five
time Olympic medalist Missy Franklin and
Cal in two weeks.

Although the matchup with UCLA (8-1,
5-1) is a rare chance to catch the Cardinal in
action away from Avery Aquatics Center, it
sets up as a likely win for Stanford. The Car
dinal has fended off the Bruins by identical
30-point margins in each of the teams' last
two meetings, and UCLA has no swimmers
with top-20 times in any of the freestyle or

individual medley (IM) events, two of Stan
ford's strongest areas.
The Cardinal's visit to No. 5 USC (5-0,4-
0) on Sunday, meanwhile, appears much
more intriguing. Ten different events boast a
top-20 swimmer from each team, with three
of those races featuring the swimmers that
own the top times in the country in those
events. And the competition is toughest in
some of Stanford's best races.
Cardinal junior Maddy Schaefer and fresh
man Lia Neal will take center stage in two hotly
contested freestyle races on which the meet
could pivot. That duo will go up against the Tro
jans' record-holder in the 50-yard and 100-yard
free, Kasey Carlson, who ranks third and first in
the nation in those events, respectively. Schae
fer's nation-leading 50 free time of 21.78 sec
onds is just ahead of Carlson's 21.90, while
Carlson's No. 1 mark in the 100 free (47.22)
gives her the advantage on paper, at least,
against the fourth-ranked Neal (47.48).
In the IM, meanwhile, Stanford's Maya Di-
Rado will duke it out against another senior,
USC's Stina Gardell. Dißado holds a two-sec
ond edge in the 200 IM her time of 1:53.50
is the best in the country and an edge of
nearly three seconds in the 400 IM, but
Gardell ranks in the top 10 in both races and
will be the toughest competition Dißado has
faced all season.

Stanford may be able to find some separa
tion in the relays, as it has posted the best 400-
yard and 800-yard freestyle relay times in the

country this season and boasts a multi-second
advantage over the Trojans in each event.
Friday's meet against UCLA and Sunday's
against USC both begin at noon.
