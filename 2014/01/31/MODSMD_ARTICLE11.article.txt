### DYLAN FUGEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's water po
lo team will open up what it hopes will be
a very successful campaign with the Stan
ford Invitational, which will bring together
a star-studded field to the Avery Aquatic
Center. The field consists of Stanford, No.

a huge part of the Cardinal's 2014 title push.
Davis in Bracket A, while Bracket B is
formed by No. 3 UCLA, No. 4 Cal, No. 12
San Jose State and No. 16 Michigan.
In the recent preseason MPSF poll,
Stanford was ranked second by only a single
point, with USC receiving four first-place
votes to the Cardinal's three. While USC
beat the Card in last year's NCAA tourna
ment final in a quadruple-overtime thriller,
Stanford returns many of its stronger mem
bers from last year's team, including three
Olympic gold medalists sophomore driv
er Maggie Steffens, junior driver Kiley
Neushul and senior two-meter Annika
Dries. The Cardinal also welcomes a highly
touted freshman class and will hope to re
turn to the NCAA Women's Water Polo
Championship for a fifth straight year.

While the Cardinal will be favored to at
least reach the final of this weekend's invi
tational, none of the matches will be easy.
Other U.S. National Team members present
at the event include UCLA sophomores

Rachel Fattal and Alys Williams, UCLA jun
ior goalkeeper Sami Hill and UC Irvine jun
ior defender Danielle Warde. Stanford's op
ponents have put together strong team per
formances as well; UCLA and Hawaii fin
ished third and fourth, respectively, in the
2013 NCAA Tournament.

Overall, the quality of the tournament
should serve Stanford well going forward as
it will act as an introduction to the high
quality of play it will see in the MPSF. Al
though this weekend's play will be an invi
tational, the Cardinal will look at it less as a
tune-up and more as an early-season bench
mark.

The Cardinal will hope to open the sea
son in front of a large crowd at the Avery
Aquatic Center and start the season the way
it means to end it: with a win.

The Saturday session begins at 8:45
a.m., with Sunday's matches starting at 8
a.m. The Cardinal is slated to face UC-Davis
at 8:45 a.m. on Saturday, Hawaii at 3:30
p.m. on Saturday and UCTrvine at 8 a.m. on
Sunday, with the finals and consolation
matches being held on Sunday afternoon.
