# What wins: Sports or schoolwork?

Packard 053 holds a special
place in my heart. From the
same corner of lab benches in
that cluttered room in the Elec
trical Engineering building's
basement, I've Game Tracked the Giants'

epic comeback in
the 2012 NLDS,
Slingßoxed
Richard Sher
man's heroic (vil
lainous?) pass
breakup at the
end of this year's
NFC Champi
onship Game

and, as of this week, smart-phoned my
way through the heartbreaking end of
Stanford basketball's loss to No. 1 Ari
zona.

If you know anything about me, then
you should be disturbed that I wasn't at
Maples Pavilion on Wednesday night. I
was going to Cardinal men's basketball
games in utero, had season tickets every
year growing up and now work at games
as a statistician for the Media Relations
Department. I would never miss a game
against the No. 1 team in the country,
much less if that game were against Ari
zona, which was always the Cardinal's
biggest basketball rival when I was grow
ing up.

But Wednesday was the only night
when both my lab partner and I could
work, which is why I spent 7:45 to 8:15
p.m. frantically switching back and forth
between Twitter, iMessage and the
Sports Center app in an effort to fight
poor signal strength. Ironic, for a radio
design lab.
I don't regret my decision to trade in
the smell of sweaty sneakers for that of
lead-laden solder, at least for one night.
School comes first; that's how we got to
Stanford in the first place.
Of course, most of us have priori
tized our extracurricular passions over

school at some point or another. But even
though I care about my teams, I know their
successes don't honestly hinge on whether
I've got my eyes on the game or on my spec
trum analyzer. That's why it has always felt
a lot more acceptable to let "productive" ac
tivities — a tennis practice, an interview
for a newspaper article, a Boy Scout outing
get in the way of my coursework than it
has to let a sporting event do the same.
At what point, though, have I sacrificed
enough in the name of school?
Ever since I started high school, I've
had a mortal fear that the San Jose Sharks
would make their first Stanley Cup Finals,
but that I would miss the Cup-clinching
game because I was taking a final exam
or at graduation. (It all usually happens in
the same week of June.) I've actually flirted
with this choice before. On the eve of my
AP U.S. History exam, I watched the Sharks
get shellacked 7-1 in a second-round playoff
game instead of cramming for the next
morning's onslaught. I still got a 5 and

more importantly, the Sharks won the se
ries in that many games.
Luckily, this won't even be an issue in
18 months. Once I've graduated, my nights
will be my own to fill with whatever sports
I please, and potential employers should
know that any job that requires me to travel
extensively on Saturdays in the fall is off the
table.

For the time being, though, every stu
dent-fan needs their own formula. Here's
mine: In the event of a Pac-12 Champi
onship Game, Sweet Sixteen or Stanley
Cup Finals, the TAs better darn well have a
makeup final ready. If a top-five football
matchup between Oregon and Stanford is
being played in my backyard, I'll turn in
that problem set a day late.
But anything less? Well, I'm off to
Packard 053, my gEEky haven of op-amps
and oscilloscopes and my black hole of
sports memories never made.

Joseph Beyda's editor cannot believe that he
could be better at electrical engineering than
he is at sports journalism not even Steve
Wozniak could be that good. To tell Joey why
he should change career paths, email him one
