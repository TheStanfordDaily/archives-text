# SPORTS BRIEF
## Cardinal blows lead, narrowly takes down Cal 
### â€“ Ashley Westhem 
In what appeared at
halftime to be a game head
ing toward disaster for the
No. 21 California Golden
Bears (14-6, 6-3 Pac-12), the
underdogs instead gave the
No. 4 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (20-1, 9-0) its
closest game in three weeks
when it closed the lead to
five points with about 20
seconds to play. The Cardinal
came out on top in the end,
beating its rivals 70-64.

Stanford went into the
half with a comfortable 43-
25 lead, capped off by a
buzzer-beater 3-pointer by
freshman Karlie Samuelson.
Samuelson was the second
leading scorer for the Card
with 14 points. Senior for
ward Chiney Ogwumike led
all Cardinal scorers with 23
points and 12 rebounds,
snagging her 16th double
double of the season. Junior
guard Taylor Greenfield had
10 points to round off Stan
ford's double-digit scoring
performances.
For Cal, junior point
guard Brittany Boyd led all
scorers with 25 points and
two steals, while senior guard
Afure Jemerigbe tallied 18
points. It wasn't enough,
however, as Cal's leading
scorer Reshanda Gray (17.3
points per game) didn't score
a single point and didn't even
play half the game.
Cal struggled at the end
of the first half and at the be
ginning of the second in
shooting efficiency and tran
sition defense. However, the
Bears seemed to shake off
the evident frustration and
pull it together enough to
outscore the Card in the sec

ond half 39-27.
Stanford will travel to
Cal on Sunday to take on the
Golden Bears in the second
half of the Battle of the Bay
doubleheader and will need
to make the necessary ad

justments to play consistent
ly dominant basketball if it is
to challenge Cal on the
Bears' home court. Tipoff at
Haas Pavilion is set for 1 p.m.
