## FASHION ON THE FARM REALDEAL OR CENTRAL? 
### KEYA TEKLU FASHION COLUMNIST 
There are a lot of beauty prod
ucts out there that seem su
per useful but are actually
complete garbage (I'm look
ing at you, "As Seen On TV"
ads!). However, there are also
beauty products that seem really
unnecessary but are actually huge
lifesavers. How do you differentiate
between the two? Advertisements
and commercials can be mislead
ing, and you can never trust the
companies to be 100 percent up
front with you about the limitations
and problems with the product
they're selling so who can you
trust? Turn to me, fellow fashion
istas I can show you the light!
Hopefully, I can be of service to you
in determining which products are
the real deal and which products
are scam central.

Curling wands:
Even though this hair tool has

been around forever, I've just re
cently hopped on the bandwagon. I
don't know about you, but curling
wands seemed too good to be true.
I was skeptical that a wand without
a clip could create long-lasting
curls, and I questioned whether or
not it was even safe to use a barrel
that was heated to 360 degrees and
not get burned. I was just all
around unconvinced. At least that
was until I actually used it on my
hair for the first time, and, oh my
goodness gracious, you guys. It's
like magic. That's probably why
they call it a 'wand,' now that I

think about it. The curls were be
yond beautiful. I was in shock and
awe, and I couldn't stop touching
my hair the entire night.
Ladies, you know what typical
ly happens to curls when they get
touched a 10t... they get flat. It's
such a pet peeve of mine every
single time I curled my hair, the
curls were gone literally two hours
later. It was a nightmare. But not with
my magic curling wand; the curls lasted
all night and even all of the next day. I
loved the product so much that I ordered
it the next day (off of Ulta.com the
Remington pink curling wand, if you are
curious). I cannot say enough good
things about this curling wand. It's defi
nitely the best purchase I've made in a
while.
Coconut Oil:
I haven't really heard any negative
reviews about coconut oil, which shows
that it's generally seen as an effective
beauty product, but before I tested it out
for myself, I wasn't sure I believed the
hype behind this product. People go
crazy over coconut oil they claim it
strengthens hair, improves overall
health, relieves dry, itchy scalps and even
works as a skin and cuticle moisturizer.
Basically, coconut oil is advertised as a
multipurpose holy-grail product; but can
it really do that many things? As always,
I was skeptical (as you should be with

beauty products, since there are so many
products out there that can cause real
damage!), but because it was all-natural,
I decided to give it a shot, and I was not
disappointed.
Because I rarely deep condition my
hair, and I straighten it all the time, my
hair was pretty damaged and lifeless. Af
ter using coconut oil as a deep condition
ing treatment on my hair right before I
showered, I witnessed a noticeable im
provement in the health and overall qual
ity of my hair. It was shinier, fuller and
softer. Since it was such a success on my
hair, I tried it out on my skin and could
not have been happier. I was getting ac
tual complements from people on how
soft my skin was, and I never had to wor
ry about dry skin again, even in the win
ter months. It is a true must have, and
it's my holy grail when it comes to hair
and skin products.

Skin lighteners:
In other words, bleach. You may or
may not know this, but women of color
have been using bleaching products and
skin lighteners on their skin for ages,
partially to relieve the look of discol
oration but mostly to lighten their skin
tone. I haven't personally tried any skin

lightening products, but my sister once
tried lightening cream, and the results
were disastrous. Her face broke out in
hundreds of bumps, and she had to seek
professional help to clear her face up,
and even then it took months of trying.
That's because those skin-lighten
ing products are full of harsh and harm
ful chemical products it's just so un
natural. All those chemicals don't react
well to your skin, especially if it's sensi
tive. Please stay away from these prod
ucts. Skin doesn't need to be lightened;
all skin colors are beautiful. I hate even
including skin lighteners in the "beauty
products" category because they will
not make you any more beautiful. Scam
central!

These are just a few products that I've
had personal experience with and can
definitively say whether or not they
worked for me. I'm sure there are tons
more products that I'm leaving out that
are either super useful or super useless.
Do you know of any products that fit
the bill? Let me know, fellow fashion
istas!
