## FASHION ON THE FARM REALDEAL OR CENTRAL? 
### KEYA TEKLU FASHION COLUMNIST 
There are a lot of beauty prod
ucts out there that seem su
per useful but are actually
complete garbage (I'm look
ing at you, "As Seen On TV"
ads!). However, there are also
beauty products that seem really
unnecessary but are actually huge
lifesavers. How do you differentiate
between the two? Advertisements
and commercials can be mislead
ing, and you can never trust the
companies to be 100 percent up
front with you about the limitations
and problems with the product
they're selling so who can you
trust? Turn to me, fellow fashion
istas I can show you the light!
Hopefully, I can be of service to you
in determining which products are
the real deal and which products
are scam central.

Curling wands:
Even though this hair tool has

been around forever, I've just re
cently hopped on the bandwagon. I
don't know about you, but curling
wands seemed too good to be true.
I was skeptical that a wand without
a clip could create long-lasting
curls, and I questioned whether or
not it was even safe to use a barrel
that was heated to 360 degrees and
not get burned. I was just all
around unconvinced. At least that
was until I actually used it on my
hair for the first time, and, oh my
goodness gracious, you guys. It's
like magic. That's probably why
they call it a 'wand,' now that I

think about it. The curls were be
yond beautiful. I was in shock and
awe, and I couldn't stop touching
my hair the entire night.
Ladies, you know what typical
ly happens to curls when they get
touched a 10t... they get flat. It's
such a pet peeve of mine every
single time I curled my hair, the
curls were gone literally two hours
