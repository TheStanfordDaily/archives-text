# Perks of BEING A SENIOR
## 
### ARTS LIFE STAFF 
Well 'l4 (FOUR-TEEN), we finally made it to
senior year. From recruiting stress to rau
cous nights at Nola's, it's already been a
wild one and we're only a third of the
way through. There are too many awe
some things about being a senior to count,
but The Weekender picked a few of our favorites.
Here's to being at the top of the heap!

Being 21. Most of us have hit the big 2-1 milestone
by now (in fact, T-Swift's "22" is becoming increas
ingly popular at birthday parties) and it's hard to
even remember what it was like to ask upperclass
men to buy you beer or be scared of MIPs at a foot
ball tailgate.

Living on the Row.We suffered through years of
crappy housing (junior year in Oak Creek, anyone?),
but now we are reaping the reward: fun house
events, new besties and lunch outside on sunny days.

Knowing everyone. Has Stanford gotten smaller, or

have we just finally begun to recognize most of the
faces of Fourteen? These days, it seems we can never
enter a classroom or make it through the line at Star
bucks without running into a friend.

The intimidation factor. Remember when you
were a freshman and the seniors looked so polished
and on top of it? We know now that it was all an illu
sion ... but it's kind of fun to keep up the charade
and watch the frosh cower in awe.

Giving underclassmen advice. On the flip side
though, there's nothing more satisfying than being
able to pass on insights we've gleaned in the last
three years... Just doing our part to ensure the Class
of 2017 doesn't make the same mistakes we did!

Academic savvy. By now, most of us are pretty famil
iar with the way classes work here on the Farm â€”we
know which professor in our department gives the
hardest finals, which course fulfills three GERs and
which 9 a.m. lectures you never really have to go to.
