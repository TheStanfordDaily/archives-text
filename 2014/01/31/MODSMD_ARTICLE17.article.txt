M Mhe Case Against 8"
I chronicles the even
tually successful law
suit to overturn Cali
fornia's Proposition 8
I (Prop 8), a 2008 bal
lot initiative that repealed the
right of same-sex couples to mar
ry. Directors Ben Cotner and
Ryan White followed the two
lawyers leading the case Ted
Olson and David Boies and
the two same-sex couples one
female, one male that became
the face of the case, from their
preparations for court through
the first case and the many ap
peals to the joyous celebrations
that broke out when Prop 8 was
struck down in 2013. It's a stir
ring and often tear-jerking story,
but it leaves out some of the
most interesting parts of the
case, opting instead for a preachi
er, more triumphant tale than
dealing with the harsher realities
of the case.

We meet Berkeley residents
Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier
mothers of four, two each from
previous partners who were
married in California before
2008 but who had their marriage
annulled when Prop 8 was enact
ed. They received a letter in the
mail informing them their mar
riage was now invalid, offering to
refund them the processing fees
they had paid to marry. We also
meet Paul Katami and Jeff Zarril
lo, a gay couple from Burbank,
Calif., who want to marry and re

fuse to accept domestic partner
ship because, as they articulate
very well, to do so would be to
accept being a second-class citi
zen. We hear about the discrimi
nation they face from day to day,
and we also hear their very con
ventionally relatable love stories.
And our hearts break with theirs
with the injustice of it all.
The two high-profile lawyers
leading the case, the ultra-con
servative Ted Olson and the ul
tra-liberal David Boies, were the
perfect team for the case be
cause they crossed party lines,
thus effectively eliminating ideol
ogy from the question of gay mar
riage. In fact, these two men
were the head of the opposing le
gal teams in the Supreme Court's
landmark Bush v. Gore case.
Their relationship is the most in
teresting in the film because it is
the least conventional: it's based
on deep professional respect and
admiration, cultivated in part
through their previously adver
sarial relationship. It's an unlikely
pairing, but the conviction with
which they both fight the case
against Prop 8 is inspiring. And
the fact that the legal and PR
team spend as much or even
more time fighting the misguid
ed LGBT leaders, who oppose Ol
son's involvement, as they do
fighting the oppressors, is eye
opening.

A film like "The Case
Against 8" already caters to a
niche market: those of us who
agree that everyone should be
