### ALEXANDRA HEENEY ARTS EDITOR 
"The Voices"
In Mar jane Satrapi's black
comedy "The Voices," Ryan
Reynolds plays Jerry, an affable, if
troubled, man who is convinced his
cat —with a Scottish potty mouth
and his dog —with a charming
drawl speak to him. His crush
on the office hottie, Fiona (Gemma
Arterton), leads him to try to get
her out on a date with him, on
which he accidentally stabs her, be
comes convinced that she's told
him to end the suffering he's thus
caused and ultimately kills her in
what's an oddly amusing turn.
Things get gruesome, strange
and eerily funny from here: Fiona's
head starts to live in his fridge and
beg for him to find her a friend (An
na Kendrick), while his therapist
encourages him to take his pills so
he won't hear voices. Unable to

cope with the reality the pills make
him face, he descends deeper and
deeper into his delusions. Shooting
from Jerry's perspective, Satrapi
creates a small-town world in bright
colors full of old-time charm, giving
the film its breezy humor without
derogating his mental illness since
we're always inside his optimistic
brain. Ryan Reynolds hasn't been
this charming since "Definitely,
Maybe." And perhaps most impres
sively, he does a darn good job voic
ing his pets and even singing.

"God Help the Girl"
The music in the indie pop
musical, written by first-time direc
tor Stuart Murdoch, the frontman
of "Belle and Sebastian," is good,
but it's not unforgettable like an
Irving Berlin tune, which makes the
barely existent plot less easily for
givable. It centers around Eve (Emi
ly Browning) who has an eating dis
order but spends most of the film

gallivanting around Glasgow in a
myriad of adorable outfits straight
from the thrift store, avoiding the
mental institution she escaped
from, and forming a band with
gawky James (Oily Alexander) and
spacey Cass (Hannah Murray). The
first 20 minutes of the film showed
promise, with James throwing out
some witty one-liners in the style of
Josh Thomas, but even a few more
of those were not enough to tie to
gether a movie that is essentially a
two-hour music video with flat
characters. Although most of the
song-and-dance numbers are direct
ed with visual panache and wit, the
fact that Eve never develops into
anything more than a vague manic
pixie-dream-girl leaves the film too
inchoate. It has no business being
longer than 70 minutes, and the
rough characters have barely
earned that.
