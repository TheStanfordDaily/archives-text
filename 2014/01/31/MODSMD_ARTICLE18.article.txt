# REVIEW: Sundance Capsule Reviews

### ALEXANDRA HEENEY ARTS EDITOR 
"The Voices"
In Mar jane Satrapi's black
comedy "The Voices," Ryan
Reynolds plays Jerry, an affable, if
troubled, man who is convinced his
cat —with a Scottish potty mouth
and his dog —with a charming
drawl speak to him. His crush
on the office hottie, Fiona (Gemma
Arterton), leads him to try to get
her out on a date with him, on
which he accidentally stabs her, be
comes convinced that she's told
him to end the suffering he's thus
caused and ultimately kills her in
what's an oddly amusing turn.
Things get gruesome, strange
and eerily funny from here: Fiona's
head starts to live in his fridge and
beg for him to find her a friend (An
na Kendrick), while his therapist
encourages him to take his pills so
he won't hear voices. Unable to

cope with the reality the pills make
him face, he descends deeper and
deeper into his delusions. Shooting
from Jerry's perspective, Satrapi
creates a small-town world in bright
colors full of old-time charm, giving
the film its breezy humor without
derogating his mental illness since
we're always inside his optimistic
brain. Ryan Reynolds hasn't been
this charming since "Definitely,
Maybe." And perhaps most impres
sively, he does a darn good job voic
ing his pets and even singing.

"God Help the Girl"
The music in the indie pop
musical, written by first-time direc
tor Stuart Murdoch, the frontman
of "Belle and Sebastian," is good,
but it's not unforgettable like an
Irving Berlin tune, which makes the
barely existent plot less easily for
givable. It centers around Eve (Emi
ly Browning) who has an eating dis
order but spends most of the film

gallivanting around Glasgow in a
myriad of adorable outfits straight
from the thrift store, avoiding the
mental institution she escaped
from, and forming a band with
gawky James (Oily Alexander) and
spacey Cass (Hannah Murray). The
first 20 minutes of the film showed
promise, with James throwing out
some witty one-liners in the style of
Josh Thomas, but even a few more
of those were not enough to tie to
gether a movie that is essentially a
two-hour music video with flat
characters. Although most of the
song-and-dance numbers are direct
ed with visual panache and wit, the
fact that Eve never develops into
anything more than a vague manic
pixie-dream-girl leaves the film too
inchoate. It has no business being
longer than 70 minutes, and the
rough characters have barely
earned that.

"Hellion"
The problems with "Hellion" were clear
in the first scene: the handheld camera is so
shaky it looks like it was operated by a 5-
year-old, and there's headache-inducingly
loud metal music in the background when
the kids are engaging in testosterone-in
duced vandalism to drive home this obvious
point. Much of Kat Candler's directing here
is amateurish at best. Yet the film does have
its moments, especially the tenderness be
tween father and sons. Jacob [Josh Wiggins)
is a troubled 13-year-old who lands himself
in almost-juvie within the first five minutes
of the film. But his bad behavior doesn't hap
pen in a vacuum: his father is largely absent,
still consumed with grief from the passing of
his wife, the mother of his children. It's not
long before child protective services get
wind that things aren't all well in the house
hold, and they send Jacob's younger brother,
Wes (Deke Garner), to live with his aunt.
Even in the wake of losing his son, their fa
ther (Aaron Paul) still can't get his act togeth
er, leaving Jacob feeling responsible for his
brother and carrying out a contrived plot in
volving a literal Chekhov's gun.

"Love is Strange"
When Ben (John Lithgow) and George
(Alfred Molina) decide to tie the knot after

39 years together, George loses his job at the
Catholic School because of it. Soon they find
themselves in dire financial straits it's not
easy to find another job as a music teacher
in Manhattan, and Ben is already retired
forcing them to move out of their apart
ment and trespass on their friends' hospital
ity while they find an affordable permanent
home. Ben stays with his nephew's family,
sharing a bunk bed with their teenage son
who doesn't appreciate the intrusion on his
privacy, and unintentionally pestering his
nephew's wife (Marisa Tomei) —who
needs quiet at home to work during the
day. George stays with their downstairs
neighbors, a couple of young gay cops who
like to party, and feels out of place.
Writer-director Ira Sachs handles their
uprooting with maturity and thoughtful
ness, accurately depicting the difficulties of
being and having a long-term guest and the
strain on Ben and George's relationship
caused by the separation. Nevertheless, it's
hard to believe that these seemingly mature
and levelheaded men would have allowed
themselves to get into this situation. Why
don't they have any savings? And consider
ing that none of their Manhattan friends
have a spare room, would they really not
have been better up taking up with Ben's
sister in Poughkeepsie so they could be
spared the separation and strained friend
ships?

Even in the wake of losing his son, their fa
ther (Aaron Paul) still can't get his act togeth
er, leaving Jacob feeling responsible for his
brother and carrying out a contrived plot in
volving a literal Chekhov's gun.

"Love is Strange"
When Ben (John Lithgow) and George
(Alfred Molina) decide to tie the knot after

39 years together, George loses his job at the
Catholic School because of it. Soon they find
themselves in dire financial straits it's not
easy to find another job as a music teacher
in Manhattan, and Ben is already retired
forcing them to move out of their apart
ment and trespass on their friends' hospital
ity while they find an affordable permanent
home. Ben stays with his nephew's family,
sharing a bunk bed with their teenage son
who doesn't appreciate the intrusion on his
privacy, and unintentionally pestering his
nephew's wife (Marisa Tomei) —who
needs quiet at home to work during the
day. George stays with their downstairs
neighbors, a couple of young gay cops who
like to party, and feels out of place.
Writer-director Ira Sachs handles their
uprooting with maturity and thoughtful
ness, accurately depicting the difficulties of
being and having a long-term guest and the
strain on Ben and George's relationship
caused by the separation. Nevertheless, it's
hard to believe that these seemingly mature
and levelheaded men would have allowed
themselves to get into this situation. Why
don't they have any savings? And consider
ing that none of their Manhattan friends
have a spare room, would they really not
have been better up taking up with Ben's
sister in Poughkeepsie so they could be
spared the separation and strained friend
ships?

Ryan Reynolds stars as Jerry, a man convinced that his pets talk to him, in Marjane
Satrapi's film, "The Voices," which premiered this year at the Sundance Film Festival.
"The Voices"
In Mar jane Satrapi's black
comedy "The Voices," Ryan
Reynolds plays Jerry, an affable, if
troubled, man who is convinced his
cat —with a Scottish potty mouth
and his dog —with a charming
drawl speak to him. His crush
on the office hottie, Fiona (Gemma
Arterton), leads him to try to get
her out on a date with him, on
which he accidentally stabs her, be
comes convinced that she's told
him to end the suffering he's thus
caused and ultimately kills her in
what's an oddly amusing turn.
Things get gruesome, strange
and eerily funny from here: Fiona's
head starts to live in his fridge and
beg for him to find her a friend (An
na Kendrick), while his therapist
encourages him to take his pills so
he won't hear voices. Unable to

cope with the reality the pills make
him face, he descends deeper and
deeper into his delusions. Shooting
from Jerry's perspective, Satrapi
creates a small-town world in bright
colors full of old-time charm, giving
the film its breezy humor without
derogating his mental illness since
we're always inside his optimistic
brain. Ryan Reynolds hasn't been
this charming since "Definitely,
Maybe." And perhaps most impres
sively, he does a darn good job voic
ing his pets and even singing.

"God Help the Girl"
The music in the indie pop
musical, written by first-time direc
tor Stuart Murdoch, the frontman
of "Belle and Sebastian," is good,
but it's not unforgettable like an
Irving Berlin tune, which makes the
barely existent plot less easily for
givable. It centers around Eve (Emi
ly Browning) who has an eating dis
order but spends most of the film

gallivanting around Glasgow in a
myriad of adorable outfits straight
from the thrift store, avoiding the
mental institution she escaped
from, and forming a band with
gawky James (Oily Alexander) and
spacey Cass (Hannah Murray). The
first 20 minutes of the film showed
promise, with James throwing out
some witty one-liners in the style of
Josh Thomas, but even a few more
of those were not enough to tie to
gether a movie that is essentially a
two-hour music video with flat
characters. Although most of the
song-and-dance numbers are direct
ed with visual panache and wit, the
fact that Eve never develops into
anything more than a vague manic
pixie-dream-girl leaves the film too
inchoate. It has no business being
longer than 70 minutes, and the
rough characters have barely
earned that.

"Hellion"
The problems with "Hellion" were clear
in the first scene: the handheld camera is so
shaky it looks like it was operated by a 5-
year-old, and there's headache-inducingly
loud metal music in the background when
the kids are engaging in testosterone-in
duced vandalism to drive home this obvious
point. Much of Kat Candler's directing here
is amateurish at best. Yet the film does have
its moments, especially the tenderness be
tween father and sons. Jacob [Josh Wiggins)
is a troubled 13-year-old who lands himself
in almost-juvie within the first five minutes
of the film. But his bad behavior doesn't hap
pen in a vacuum: his father is largely absent,
still consumed with grief from the passing of
his wife, the mother of his children. It's not
long before child protective services get
wind that things aren't all well in the house
hold, and they send Jacob's younger brother,
Wes (Deke Garner), to live with his aunt.
Even in the wake of losing his son, their fa
ther (Aaron Paul) still can't get his act togeth
er, leaving Jacob feeling responsible for his
brother and carrying out a contrived plot in
