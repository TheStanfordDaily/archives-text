# REVIEW: Goliath returns to the Farm

M M oliath" is a 45-minute whirlwind
1 Â® about war, the damage and
trauma that it causes and the
I toxic aspects of American cul-
I ture that fuel that combina
tion. First written, directed and
performed by Stanford students in 2007 as a
Ram's Head Original Winter One Act, "Go
liath" garnered national acclaim as a college
theater piece before finding new life over the
past two years in New York City. It returned
to Stanford this week for one night only at
Pigott Theater on Monday and I only wish
it could have stayed longer.
In a poetically jumbled chronology that
jumps between times, places and character
perspectives, "Goliath" under the direc
tion of original playwright Takeo Rivera 'OB
M.A. 'O9 and original director Alex Mallory
'OB focuses on David, the main character,
as he lives out his story. In the opening scene,
we see David write pained letters home from
Iraq, and we hear his mother's explanations
of David's good and gentle nature. We learn
more, however, when we see David's father
criticize his manhood and force him to enlist.
The story becomes more ideologically com
plex when we see David's politically oriented
sister's anti-war rallies and when David refus
es his fiancee's touch upon returning home
from his tour. Before we know it, we've seen
David become numb to the deaths of his fel
low soldiers, and we are forced to look on as
he participates in the gang rape of a young
Iranian teen while on duty.
The play is unceasingly brutal in its cri
tique of modern culture. Each scene is
swirling with social issues from racism,
xenophobia and the myth of the American
dream to violent hyper-masculinity, the degra
dation of women and a nation's ignorance of

the truths of war practices overseas.
At one point in the play, a drill sergeant
spits into the face of young cadets, demand
ing that they fight the Iraqi enemy or else risk
"No more hot dogs! No more Fourth of July!
No more big titty blond women! No more
Sylvester Stallone movies!... I drown weak
ness with my seminal fluid! I am the epitome
of masculinity!" "Goliath" is sometimes
grotesque and sometimes hilarious. Yet it is al
so always difficult, and often too true, too
painful or too close to home to even watch.
Dubbed "poetic theater," "Goliath" in
habits a new kind of theater space in which
slam poetry, kinetic storytelling, Greek cho
rus and theatrical realism all collide. Nothing
happens in order, no character narrates the
story for more than a scene or two and lines
are often repeated or said in unison. Actors
slip in and out of different characters or blend
into the background, while all physical move
ment is heightened to what often feels like
modern dance. The ensemble cast pushes
and pulls through unrelenting subject matter
like a wave.

The play brought war and the issues sur
rounding it vividly to life, and gave the audi
ence a reason to become more vocal on such
issues. The return to campus of a production
with such strong Stanford roots Rivera
noted that he wrote the majority of the orig
inal script over a weekend in Green Library
for a revival showing sets a positive tone,
moreover, for the creation and production
of more works like "Goliath" on the Farm.
