## Religion at Stanford Critical thinking shapes students' religious experiences 
### LUCY SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's religious culture is in
many ways defined by its commitment to
diversity: the University is overseen by
three different chaplains, boasts over 30
student religious organizations and was
founded as a non-religious institution.
Stanford's commitment to a liberal arts
education, however, has also shaped the
religious experience on campus by em
phasizing critical thinking and open dia
logue, according to campus religious lead
ers.
"I would argue that with a liberal

arts education you want to question
all of the assumptions that you arrive
with and hold to some of them more
deeply because of it," said Rabbi Patricia
Karlin-Neumann, senior associate dean
for religious life. "I think that religions
worth their salt aren't afraid of the intel
lect or afraid of scientific inquiry, but
welcome them."
It is this focus on inquiry and ques
tioning that surrounds Stanford's reli
gious culture and that has led some to
reevaluate their beliefs.
"Coming [to Stanford], the way I
have always thought of it, it is definitely
a crucible of faith," said Cale Strong 'l6.

"It either refines your faith and makes it
very strong or it burns it up and destroys
it."
For Strong, who grew up as a devout
Mormon in Utah, the varying perspec
tives of his freshman dormmates, in addi
tion to his peers' desire to question and
engage in debate, allowed him to reeval
uate his belief structure.
"It wasn't necessarily them trying to
bring me down, it was just curiosity, I
guess," Strong said. "With them asking
me questions, I realized I didn't neces
sarily agree with everything that the
church told me ... I think I'm a
better person now and more sure
of my own beliefs."
For others, such as Kate
Bridges-Lyman, a masters student
in Religious Studies and a convert
ed Muslim, the questioning cul
ture allowed her to become
stronger in her faith and her study
of religion.

"I personally believe that
everything you come to believe
should be challenged and that crit
ical thinking is a good strategy that
we should be learning as part of
being students," Bridges-Lyman
said. "I don't think this is limited
to a religious context. I think this
is just living in the world and en
countering people that are differ
ent from you. The college environ
ment as a whole is a place to nur
ture those challenges and to facili
tate critical thinking."
For some students, however,
dialogue about religion occurs less
with people that are different from
them and more within their own
religious communities. Preet Kaur
'l6, who said that she is the only
female at Stanford that she knows
of that wears a Sikh turban or a
dastaar, said that she has never
once been asked at Stanford what
faith she represents.
"I would think that my out
ward appearance would probe
those questions, but it hasn't so
far," Kaur said. "I'm not sure if that
represents acceptance or indiffer
ence ... I think the questions are
there but people don't know the
avenue in which to ask them."

Kaur explained that from her
experience, religion is a topic that
takes a bit longer to come up in
conversation, but that when it has,
she has had positive and produc
tive dialogues.
"Once people are engaged in
conversations they will carry on;
it's just that initiation which is the
troubling part," she said.
Bridges-Lyman, who wears an

abaya a long, flowing dress
common in the Muslim world
said she also has rarely been asked
about her appearance, especially
by non-Muslims. Both Kaur and
Bridges-Lyman expressed apprecia
tion that their appearance and reli
gion didn't elicit stares or constant
interrogations at Stanford, but
they also shared a desire for more
dialogue and more questions.
"I personally think that having
those conversations reflects a
deeper level of acceptance ... [be
cause] acceptance reflects a per
sonal involvement," Bridges-Lyman
said. "Whereas tolerance is more
of letting something happen on
the side and not being engaged
with it. I don't think tolerance is
bad, but I personally think accept
ance is better. I think it's better to
reach out to people and see where
they are coming from."
Tyler Karahalios 'l6 said that
she feels being religious can be a
very taboo thing to own up to at
Stanford.

"I think that being spiritual is
more accepted because it's associ
ated with exploration and academ
ic pursuit and a line of question
ing, whereas adopting religion has
a connotation of blind following,"
Karahalios, who was raised
Catholic and is now a self-de
scribed "religious seeker," said.
Haley Herring 'l5, who is
Catholic, said that at times she felt
stereotyped as "the brainwashed
girl that has grown up with reli
gion."

"A lot of people here think re
ligion is for people who aren't crit
ically thinking, or for people who
just take what others say without
asking questions about it I
think that's what most people as
sume," Herring said.
Bridges-Lyman added that that
this tension can also be attributed
to the focus on success at Stanford
and the fear of admitting one
might not know the answer.
"Within every religious con
text, at some point there is a leap
of faith some admission that
things are greater than I under
stand," Bridges-Lyman said. "In a

context that is so success-driven...
I think people trying to avoid
seeming religious is tied to not
seeming vulnerable in some con
texts."

Kate Mosle ' 16, a member of
a Christian fellowship group on
campus, said she has not experi
enced this sentiment at Stanford.

"There is this stereotype
about elite academic institutions
scoffing at religion because people
think that you have to be silly to
believe in some supernatural
thing," Mosle explained. "That has
not been the case at all. I have had
a really positive experience both
within the Christian community
and in dialogue with other peo
ple."

Strong said that while ques
tioning can occur, he believes it
stems from Stanford's commit
ment to truth and rational think
ing, and not from a place of mal
ice.

"[People] are not ever trying
to go around and bash other peo
ple's beliefs... people here are too
accepting and too diverse for any
of that to be around," Strong said.
"The atmosphere doesn't lend it
self well to religious thought, just
because a lot of religious things
are based on faith or belief in real
ly old books, and when there is
scientific evidence or another way
of thinking, people generally fall
into that realm of thought."
Despite coming from various
backgrounds and perspectives,
students said that, in general, peo
ple on campus were open to learn
ing about others' beliefs and pas
sions.

"I think what it comes down
to is: Do people feel comfortable
sharing what they know and what
they practice and what they do?"
Karlin-Neumann said. "The more
people are willing to share what
they do, I think the more curiosity
it engenders, and in general, re
spect. From what I've seen, it
seems like there's a fair amount of
respect here."
