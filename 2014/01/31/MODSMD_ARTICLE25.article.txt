# Roxy Sass: Roxy wants that (Special) D
## 
### ROXY SASS 
Roxy likes to think of
week four in terms
of the French Revo
lution it may be
the worst of times
(can you say
midterm season?), but it
also signals the beginning
of the best of times. That's
right, Roxy's talking about
everybody's favorite Stan
ford event: Special Dinner!
These crazy parties offer
the chance to bond with
your house or club over
fancy food and potent
drinks, as well as the
chance to follow up that
dinner with some...
dessert. Here are some of
Roxy's top tips for getting
the d at Special D.
Dress for the occasion
Roxy's a fan of reveal
ing costumes as much as
anyone (or more ... just
wait till next Halloween),
but part of what make
these dinners "special" are
their wacky themes, so be
sure to attire yourself ap
propriately. That said, if
you can pull off themed
and slutty, more power to
you. Pro tip: try a onesie ...
you'll be comfy and festive
during dinner, but it just
takes one zip to transition
to the afterparty.

Bring a buddy
Special dinners al

ways make for fun memo
ries the question is,
who do you want to make
those memories with?
Roxy acknowledges the
appeal of a fun, friendly
plus-one, but let's be real,
it would be a shame to
pass up this opportunity
to make a move on your
crush. Inviting someone
to a special D can be an
easy and casual way to
demonstrate interest...

and to let them know you
might be down for a dif
ferent kind of D later in
the night.

Eat, drink and be merry
It's no surprise Roxy
loves special dinners, giv
en how much she likes to
put things in her mouth.
With all of the yummy
dishes and delicious
drinks, though, proper eti
quette is necessary. It's al
ways slightly nerve-wrack
ing to eat in front of your
date Roxy recommends
doing less chewing and
more swallowing. As for
drinking, make sure to
stay frisky rather than fad
ed ... you wouldn't want
to pass out before making
it to the bedroom for the
last course.
