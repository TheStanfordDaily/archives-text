At 2 p.m., the afternoon sun begins to illu

morial Church and its colorful murals and or

sparkle under the glow.
The elaborate Victorian church hasn't,
however, always been a scene of tranquility.
MemChu, as it is fondly referred to, has a rich

years since its Jan. 25, 1903 dedica
tion. According to docent Susan
Christiansen '6O M.A. ' 61, Jane
Stanford built the church in memo
ry of her late husband and intended
it to be the focal point of campus.
"It serves as a core part of the
University, and its location symbolizes
that," Christiansen said. "The Stan

fords felt very strongly that the spiri
tual component of your education
was as important as the academic."
Quake and Break
Just two years after the dedica
tion in 1905, Jane Stanford died
and was subsequently honored in a
funeral held at MemChu, a distinc

tion that was later shared by the
likes of iconic football coach Bill
Walsh and Apple CEO Steve Jobs.
The church building had only
been standing for three years be
fore the massive San Francisco
earthquake of 1906 struck and dev
astated it, as the church lacked the
tough steel infrastructure of mod
ern buildings. The 85-foot spire
that rested atop the original Me
morial Church collapsed into the
church, wrecking the interior. The
original frontal fagade wholly col
lapsed into the Quad.
"Luckily, Mrs. Stanford didn't
live to see that happen," Chris-

tiansen said.
It was not until 1913 that re
pairs were finished, after workers
painstakingly numbered and re
placed each fallen block. The new
church bore marked differences
from the original. Several white
marble statues of apostles on the
chancel were lost. The steeple was
never rebuilt, though the clock
work and face from one clock on
the steeple were restored and can
still be seen in the Clock Tower on
Lasuen Mall.

A second major earthquake in
1989 did less, though still severe,
damage. Stanford incurred costs of
$lO million to repair fallen arches,
railings and mosaics. Remarkably,
the stained glass windows visible
today in Memorial Church survived
both the 1906 and 1989 earth
quakes intact, even while sur
rounding structures crumbled.
Earthquakes haven't been the
only misfortunes to affect the
church, however. In 1974, a Stan
ford police officer locked the doors
to Memorial Church and returned
the next morning to discover both
an unlocked door and the dead
body of Arlis Perry, a 19-year-old
North Dakota resident who had
come to California to marry Stan
ford student Bruce Perry '77. A
Santa Clara County spokesperson
later told The Daily that the case
was "definitely a sex crime," but

that suspicions of a murderous cult
at work were unfounded ("No Sus
pects Yet in Murder Case," Oct.
15, 1974). The homicide has not
yet been solved.

On the Bright Side
Funds used to repair the
church after the 1989 earthquake
were largely provided by couples
that got married at Memorial
Church before the disaster, said
Memorial Church wedding coordi
nator Melissa Prestinario. Such
large-scale fundraising was possible
because over 8,000 couples have
been wed within the church walls.

Memorial Church hosts any
where from 80 to 150 marriages
each year, she said, with couples
ranging from Palo Alto residents to
people living in Singapore, New
Zealand and Europe who wanted to
return to their alma mater. Each
wedding is recorded in a registry
that contains documentation of
every marriage ceremony since the
first in February 1903, just weeks af
ter Memorial Church opened its
doors.

The church's organs have also
played a significant part in its histo
ry. University organist Robert Mor
gan has played organ for many of
the weddings, Sunday services and
funerals held at Memorial Church
in the past 14 years.
What most people don't real
ize, according to Morgan, is the
church owns five separate organs
from different time periods. The
network of pipes in the back
gallery above the entrance is actu
ally made up of two separate instru
ments, and there are three addi
tional organs in the side chapel.
One instrument, a Baroque organ
by Charles Fisk, was so large and
heavy that renovations were need
ed in order to safely install it in the
rear gallery of the church in 1983.
The newest addition, a Tudor Eng
lish organ, was built specifically for
Morgan's use. Morgan and guest
performers use the five instru

ments to play music in a historically
accurate fashion.

"Certainly, in this country,
nothing approaches what we've got
here," Morgan said of the organs'
quality and number.

Memorial Church has evolved
to an extent that Jane Stanford prob
ably did not anticipate. What started
as a nondenominational Christian
church now holds regular multi-faith
services Christiansen noted that
there have been traditional Hindu
and Buddhist weddings in addition
to Christian and Jewish ones.
Nor is it solely religious any
more: as student protests against
the Vietnam War erupted across
the nation in the late 19605, the
church did not rebuff angry stu
dents, but instead invited them to
meet within the church and ex
press their frustrations.
Aesthetically beautiful, re
silient after disaster and ever ac
commodating, Memorial Church is
what Prestinario calls "the crown
jewel of Stanford."

years since its Jan. 25, 1903 dedica
tion. According to docent Susan
Christiansen '6O M.A. ' 61, Jane
Stanford built the church in memo
ry of her late husband and intended
it to be the focal point of campus.
"It serves as a core part of the
University, and its location symbolizes
that," Christiansen said. "The Stan

fords felt very strongly that the spiri
tual component of your education
was as important as the academic."
Quake and Break
Just two years after the dedica
tion in 1905, Jane Stanford died
and was subsequently honored in a
funeral held at MemChu, a distinc

tion that was later shared by the
likes of iconic football coach Bill
Walsh and Apple CEO Steve Jobs.
The church building had only
been standing for three years be
fore the massive San Francisco
earthquake of 1906 struck and dev
astated it, as the church lacked the
tough steel infrastructure of mod
ern buildings. The 85-foot spire
that rested atop the original Me
morial Church collapsed into the
church, wrecking the interior. The
original frontal fagade wholly col
lapsed into the Quad.
"Luckily, Mrs. Stanford didn't
live to see that happen," Chris-

tiansen said.
It was not until 1913 that re
pairs were finished, after workers
painstakingly numbered and re
placed each fallen block. The new
church bore marked differences
from the original. Several white
marble statues of apostles on the
chancel were lost. The steeple was
never rebuilt, though the clock
work and face from one clock on
the steeple were restored and can
still be seen in the Clock Tower on
Lasuen Mall.

A second major earthquake in
1989 did less, though still severe,
damage. Stanford incurred costs of
$lO million to repair fallen arches,
railings and mosaics. Remarkably,
the stained glass windows visible
today in Memorial Church survived
both the 1906 and 1989 earth
quakes intact, even while sur
rounding structures crumbled.
Earthquakes haven't been the
only misfortunes to affect the
church, however. In 1974, a Stan
ford police officer locked the doors
to Memorial Church and returned
the next morning to discover both
an unlocked door and the dead
body of Arlis Perry, a 19-year-old
North Dakota resident who had
come to California to marry Stan
ford student Bruce Perry '77. A
Santa Clara County spokesperson
later told The Daily that the case
was "definitely a sex crime," but

that suspicions of a murderous cult
at work were unfounded ("No Sus
pects Yet in Murder Case," Oct.
15, 1974). The homicide has not
yet been solved.

On the Bright Side
Funds used to repair the
church after the 1989 earthquake
were largely provided by couples
that got married at Memorial
Church before the disaster, said
Memorial Church wedding coordi
nator Melissa Prestinario. Such
large-scale fundraising was possible
because over 8,000 couples have
been wed within the church walls.

Memorial Church hosts any
where from 80 to 150 marriages
each year, she said, with couples
ranging from Palo Alto residents to
people living in Singapore, New
Zealand and Europe who wanted to
return to their alma mater. Each
wedding is recorded in a registry
that contains documentation of
every marriage ceremony since the
first in February 1903, just weeks af
ter Memorial Church opened its
doors.

The church's organs have also
played a significant part in its histo
ry. University organist Robert Mor
gan has played organ for many of
the weddings, Sunday services and
funerals held at Memorial Church
in the past 14 years.
What most people don't real
ize, according to Morgan, is the
church owns five separate organs
from different time periods. The
network of pipes in the back
gallery above the entrance is actu
ally made up of two separate instru
ments, and there are three addi
tional organs in the side chapel.
One instrument, a Baroque organ
by Charles Fisk, was so large and
heavy that renovations were need
ed in order to safely install it in the
rear gallery of the church in 1983.
The newest addition, a Tudor Eng
lish organ, was built specifically for
Morgan's use. Morgan and guest
performers use the five instru

ments to play music in a historically
accurate fashion.

"Certainly, in this country,
nothing approaches what we've got
here," Morgan said of the organs'
quality and number.

Memorial Church has evolved
to an extent that Jane Stanford prob
ably did not anticipate. What started
as a nondenominational Christian
church now holds regular multi-faith
services Christiansen noted that
there have been traditional Hindu
and Buddhist weddings in addition
to Christian and Jewish ones.
Nor is it solely religious any
more: as student protests against
the Vietnam War erupted across
the nation in the late 19605, the
church did not rebuff angry stu
dents, but instead invited them to
meet within the church and ex
press their frustrations.
Aesthetically beautiful, re
silient after disaster and ever ac
commodating, Memorial Church is
what Prestinario calls "the crown
jewel of Stanford."

ing may attend weekly tours on
