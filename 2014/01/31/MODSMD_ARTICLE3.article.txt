# MemChu through the years
## 
### VICTOR XU 
At 2 p.m., the afternoon sun begins to illu
minate the stained glass windows behind the al
tar, casting a warm light onto the chancel of Me
morial Church and its colorful murals and or
nate architecture. The countless ceiling tiles
sparkle under the glow.
The elaborate Victorian church hasn't,
however, always been a scene of tranquility.
MemChu, as it is fondly referred to, has a rich
history, replete with weddings, memorial
services and religious congregations but also
earthquakes, reconstruction and even a bizarre
murder.
