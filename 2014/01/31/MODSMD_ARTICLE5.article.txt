## Steven Weitzman Religious studies professor talks spiritual life on campus 
### JOSEE SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Steven Weitzman is a professor of Jewish
Culture and Religion in the Department of
Religious Studies and the director of the
Taube Centerfor Jewish Studies. He came to
Stanford from Indiana University five years
ago and serves as the residentfellow in Roble
HaR, along with his wife, an ordained rabbi
and his four children, aged 15, 12, 7 and 7
years old. He has focused his time here at
Stanford trying to help students and faculty
better understand religion, both their own
and that of other people.

The Daily spoke with Professor Weitzman
about his work on campus and his own
thoughts about religion.

The Stanford Dally (TSD): How did you end
up as a Resident Fellow (RF)?
Steven Weitzman (SW):In my previous posi
tion, I taught a lot of undergraduates and I really
valued that experience. In the humanities right
now, there are not that many students in it, and
I missed the context of undergraduates. I found
out about the RF option and I thought it was a
great way to develop relationships with under
graduates. I also realized that it would be a great
way for my kids to grow up.
I have four children and they're different ages,
and it's been a different experience for the four
of them. For all of them, though, it's been enor-
mously stimulating. They've learned
about what college life is like, both
the good and the bad, and they've
had a lot of interpersonal and cultur
al experiences. The older ones are
shy, but even if they don't want to
talk to the students, they still learn
a lot from watching them in the
dorm.

TSD: How do you try to bring reli
gious programming to the students
on campus?
SW: In the religious studies depart
ment, I'm affiliated with the Center
for Comparative Studies of Race and
Ethnicity. CCSRE is about ethnicity
and the religious department is
about religion, and I recognized that
for a lot of people in the world,
those two things are both part of
their identity. I was looking for ways
to develop connections and build
bridges between those two areas.
We conceived of this initiative, The
Stanford Project for Religious and
Ethnic Coexistence. It supports
programs on campus that explore
religious and ethnic conflict and co
existence. There's a component to
the initiative that takes place in the
residences.

Last year was the first year of the
initiative and we had programs that
were largely initiated by other RFs
and sometimes by students, in a
range of areas, such as a film show
ing and discussion about evangeli
cal music, a Syrian hip-hop concert,
and programming on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.

TSD: What reception has this pro
gramming garnered from students
on campus?
SW: The people who choose to par
ticipate in the programming have
found them very meaningful. I
think it can be tough for people to
talk about religion outside of their
own religious community. We en
countered some difficulty in gener
ating programs that were meaning
ful for people because people don't
really know how to talk about reli
gion outside of their own. I think
this is the role of religious studies,

to help people understand religion,
not to attack religion or promote re
ligion but to understand it. I think
there's a role for that on campus be
cause people have a hard time talk
ing about their beliefs or under
standing the beliefs of others.
One program that was sponsored
this year brought a group of stu
dents to see The Book of Mormon,
which is a very funny play but is al
so very critical of religion and I
think it made some students who
are religious very uncomfortable,
which was a shame. A lot of times
people feel like you are either at
tacking or supporting religion, but
there's also a lot of room for under
standing religion.

TSD:What type of dynamic have
you seen between students who
are religious and students who are
not?

SW: We haven't measured anything
like that in any formal way, but the
students that I've interacted with
have appreciated the chance to talk
about these things. Sometimes I
don't know even know how to start
a conversation with someone about
religion, and so having options and
programming that can help people
get into the kinds of conversations
they wouldn't know how to start
otherwise can be really rewarding.
TSD:In what other ways have you
tried to incorporate religion into
your time at Stanford, outside of
this initiative?

SW:l'm a scholar of religion, so my
courses are about religion. I'm not a
promoter of religion, and I don't see

myself as a religious person. I take
religion seriously and I identify as
Jewish, but I don't have any reli
gious motivations that I am aware
of. I do find value in helping people
understand religion, especially reli
gions that are different form their
own.

I function as an advisor for a stu
dent-initiative course called Inter
faith at Noon, which will be offered
again in the spring for the third year.
It meets once a week over lunch,
with a theme that functions as the
focus of a quarter long discussion
that brings in guest speakers and in
volves the students in a discussion
amongst themselves. The first year,
the theme was religion and the
stranger, so what religion teaches
about one's responsibility to
strangers, to others, to the marginal
ized. Much of the focus was on reli
gions and immigration policy. The
second year was on religion and the
ethics of wealth, and the third is
likely to be on religion and politics.
TSD:How do you view Stanford's
relationship with religion?
SW:I teach a course every other
year in the fall called Is Stanford a
Religion? This course works to un
derstand Stanford and its culture
and the rituals of Stanford under
graduate life, so looking at things
like Full Moon on the Quad. One of
the topics of the course is Stanford's
own history and its relationship
with religion.
From the very beginning, Stanford
was committed to being non-de
nominational and not identified
with a specific religion, which dis
tinguished it from other universities
like Harvard and Princeton, which
identified with a specific denomina
tion. That set a precedent for Stan
ford being a diverse place, open to
multiple points of view. But I think
that also means that now, a lot of
faculty and students don't identify
as religious or some don't take it se
riously. Even today, I think some stu
dents find it hard to be out in the
open about their religious identity.

gious motivations that I am aware
of. I do find value in helping people
understand religion, especially reli
gions that are different form their
own.

I function as an advisor for a stu
dent-initiative course called Inter
faith at Noon, which will be offered
again in the spring for the third year.
It meets once a week over lunch,
with a theme that functions as the
focus of a quarter long discussion
that brings in guest speakers and in
volves the students in a discussion
amongst themselves. The first year,
the theme was religion and the
stranger, so what religion teaches
about one's responsibility to
strangers, to others, to the marginal
ized. Much of the focus was on reli
gions and immigration policy. The
second year was on religion and the
ethics of wealth, and the third is
likely to be on religion and politics.
TSD:How do you view Stanford's
relationship with religion?
SW:I teach a course every other
year in the fall called Is Stanford a
Religion? This course works to un
derstand Stanford and its culture
and the rituals of Stanford under
graduate life, so looking at things
like Full Moon on the Quad. One of
the topics of the course is Stanford's
own history and its relationship
with religion.
From the very beginning, Stanford
was committed to being non-de
nominational and not identified
with a specific religion, which dis
tinguished it from other universities
like Harvard and Princeton, which
identified with a specific denomina
tion. That set a precedent for Stan
ford being a diverse place, open to
multiple points of view. But I think
that also means that now, a lot of
faculty and students don't identify
as religious or some don't take it se
riously. Even today, I think some stu
dents find it hard to be out in the
open about their religious identity.

Religious Studies Professor Steven Weitzman
Steven Weitzman is a professor of Jewish
Culture and Religion in the Department of
Religious Studies and the director of the
Taube Centerfor Jewish Studies. He came to
Stanford from Indiana University five years
ago and serves as the residentfellow in Roble
HaR, along with his wife, an ordained rabbi
and his four children, aged 15, 12, 7 and 7
years old. He has focused his time here at
Stanford trying to help students and faculty
better understand religion, both their own
and that of other people.

The Daily spoke with Professor Weitzman
about his work on campus and his own
thoughts about religion.

The Stanford Dally (TSD): How did you end
up as a Resident Fellow (RF)?
Steven Weitzman (SW):In my previous posi
tion, I taught a lot of undergraduates and I really
valued that experience. In the humanities right
now, there are not that many students in it, and
I missed the context of undergraduates. I found
out about the RF option and I thought it was a
great way to develop relationships with under
graduates. I also realized that it would be a great
way for my kids to grow up.
I have four children and they're different ages,
and it's been a different experience for the four
of them. For all of them, though, it's been enor-
mously stimulating. They've learned
about what college life is like, both
the good and the bad, and they've
had a lot of interpersonal and cultur
al experiences. The older ones are
shy, but even if they don't want to
talk to the students, they still learn
a lot from watching them in the
dorm.

TSD: How do you try to bring reli
gious programming to the students
on campus?
SW: In the religious studies depart
ment, I'm affiliated with the Center
for Comparative Studies of Race and
Ethnicity. CCSRE is about ethnicity
and the religious department is
about religion, and I recognized that
for a lot of people in the world,
those two things are both part of
their identity. I was looking for ways
to develop connections and build
bridges between those two areas.
We conceived of this initiative, The
Stanford Project for Religious and
Ethnic Coexistence. It supports
programs on campus that explore
religious and ethnic conflict and co
existence. There's a component to
the initiative that takes place in the
residences.

Last year was the first year of the
initiative and we had programs that
were largely initiated by other RFs
and sometimes by students, in a
range of areas, such as a film show
ing and discussion about evangeli
cal music, a Syrian hip-hop concert,
and programming on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.

TSD: What reception has this pro
gramming garnered from students
on campus?
SW: The people who choose to par
ticipate in the programming have
found them very meaningful. I
think it can be tough for people to
talk about religion outside of their
own religious community. We en
countered some difficulty in gener
ating programs that were meaning
ful for people because people don't
really know how to talk about reli
gion outside of their own. I think
this is the role of religious studies,

to help people understand religion,
not to attack religion or promote re
ligion but to understand it. I think
there's a role for that on campus be
cause people have a hard time talk
ing about their beliefs or under
standing the beliefs of others.
One program that was sponsored
this year brought a group of stu
dents to see The Book of Mormon,
which is a very funny play but is al
so very critical of religion and I
think it made some students who
are religious very uncomfortable,
which was a shame. A lot of times
people feel like you are either at
tacking or supporting religion, but
there's also a lot of room for under
standing religion.

TSD:What type of dynamic have
you seen between students who
are religious and students who are
not?

SW: We haven't measured anything
like that in any formal way, but the
students that I've interacted with
have appreciated the chance to talk
about these things. Sometimes I
don't know even know how to start
a conversation with someone about
religion, and so having options and
programming that can help people
get into the kinds of conversations
they wouldn't know how to start
otherwise can be really rewarding.
TSD:In what other ways have you
tried to incorporate religion into
your time at Stanford, outside of
this initiative?

SW:l'm a scholar of religion, so my
courses are about religion. I'm not a
promoter of religion, and I don't see

myself as a religious person. I take
religion seriously and I identify as
Jewish, but I don't have any reli
gious motivations that I am aware
of. I do find value in helping people
understand religion, especially reli
gions that are different form their
own.
