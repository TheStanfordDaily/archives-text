Members of Stanford Law School's Reli

Ventura City Council last Tuesday in defense
of Harbor Community Church, a residential
homeless ministry located in Ventura, Calif.
The clinic's involvement marks a year
since the program's founding, during which
the clinic the first of its kind in the country

from Harbor pastor Sam Gallucci, who asked
for help with applying for a Conditional Use
Permit (CUP) that would allow Harbor to keep
its doors open.

from food to clothing to Bible study.
Ventura residents brought Harbor to the
city's attention when they noticed the size of
the congregation had doubled after the city
launched efforts in 2011 and 2012 to clear
out Ventura's homeless population, ranging
from sweeping homeless encampments along
the bottom of Ventura River to prohibiting
panhandling in certain areas of the city.
According to an article published in April
2013 in the Ventura County Star, Harbor's
critics felt the church operated as a social serv
ices provider and existed in excessive physical
proximity to homes and the local elementary
school.
"We took them on as a religious liberty
clinic because their zoning issues directly cor
related to their religious mission," said Court-
