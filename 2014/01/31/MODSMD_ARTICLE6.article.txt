# SLS Clinic assists ministry in SoCal
## 
### MADELEINE HAN STAFF WRITER 
Members of Stanford Law School's Reli
gious Liberty Clinic presented in front of the
Ventura City Council last Tuesday in defense
of Harbor Community Church, a residential
homeless ministry located in Ventura, Calif.
The clinic's involvement marks a year
since the program's founding, during which
the clinic the first of its kind in the country
has worked on 19 cases spanning cate
gories from prisoner rights and employment
discrimination to constitutional free exercise
and religious land use.
From Stanford to Ventura
Clinic members began work on the Ven
tura case last fall when they received a call
from Harbor pastor Sam Gallucci, who asked
for help with applying for a Conditional Use
Permit (CUP) that would allow Harbor to keep
its doors open.

Gallucci opened Harbor's doors to the
homeless when he became pastor in 2008, of
fering Harbor's members resources ranging
from food to clothing to Bible study.
Ventura residents brought Harbor to the
city's attention when they noticed the size of
the congregation had doubled after the city
launched efforts in 2011 and 2012 to clear
out Ventura's homeless population, ranging
from sweeping homeless encampments along
the bottom of Ventura River to prohibiting
panhandling in certain areas of the city.
According to an article published in April
2013 in the Ventura County Star, Harbor's
critics felt the church operated as a social serv
ices provider and existed in excessive physical
proximity to homes and the local elementary
school.
"We took them on as a religious liberty
clinic because their zoning issues directly cor
related to their religious mission," said Court-
ney Quiros J.D.'l4, a Clinic mem
ber. "They're a church, and they
should be able to operate as they
see a church should operate."

The case at Ventura
After the Clinic decided to take
on the case, James Sonne, director
of the Clinic, sent students to Ven
tura to interview the client.

"Meeting the client is some
thing you can't replicate in the class
room," Sonne noted, emphasizing
the importance of understanding
the client before proceeding with
further casework. "Now it's a real
person with a real problem."
After the Ventura City Planning
Commission voted to deny the CUP
application that Clinic students
drafted on Harbor's behalf, stu
dents began constructing an appeal
to the Ventura City Council.

"Part of what makes the Reli
gious Liberty Clinic such an amaz
ing experience is the variety of ar
eas of the law that it exposes stu
dents to," said Paul Harold J.D. 'l4,
a Clinic participant.
"The idea," Sonne added, "is
that you're out there actually doing
[law]. Good lawyers should be able
to navigate tricky human situations
because, at bottom, that's what
we're talking about from a legal
perspective."

Quiros and Harold undertook
interviews, conducted legal re
search and prepared to draft an ap
peal to the Ventura City Council.
The appeal, which was submit
ted in November 2013, claimed
the city's refusal to grant Harbor a
CUP violated the Religious Land
Use and Institutionalized Persons
Act, or RLUIPA, which protects re
ligious groups against zoning re
strictions unless the government
has a compelling interest in limit
ing such land use.
On Jan. 26, Sonne and four
fellow Clinic students drove to
Ventura to present in front of the
City Council, bringing together
months of work with case support

ers and the city of Ventura to an
end. It was show time.
The final stretch
The next day, Clinic students
presented at a six-hour hearing in
front of the Council. Peyton Gulley
J.D.'l5, presented the Clinic's
case. Other speakers included two
interfaith groups with an interest
in the case and local residents who
opposed the CUR
Although Clinic students and
Harbor will have to wait until
March to receive a final decision
from the Council, Quiros expound
ed on the importance of continu
ing work on unresolved cases from
quarter to quarter.
"Religious liberty is an issue
that is important no matter where
we fall on the political spectrum,"
she said, "no matter whether we
consider ourselves religious or not,
no matter where we come from."

Beyond the Ventura case, Clin
ic students are currently working
with an array of clients ranging
from a Muslim prisoner who was
denied the right to wear a kufi in
prison to Sikh truck drivers who
were fired when they refused to
cut their hair for drug testing.
Sonne explained how each of
the Clinic's cases, whether dealing
with religious land use or employ
ment discrimination, has implica
tions beyond the law itself.

"You can read about this stuff
in a book or get a prepackaged set
of facts," Sonne said, "but stu
dents' exposure to different cul
tures, different beliefs, different le
gal situations it's a deeply hu
man way to learn the nuts and
bolts of law."
Gallucci echoed Sonne's senti
ments in a written statement ex
pressing gratitude for the Clinic's
work and hope regarding the Har
bor verdict.

"Clinic students have been
with us every step of the way," Gal
lucci wrote, adding that their "con
sistent excellence and character"
remains a "source of great strength"
to the Harbor community.

Members of Stanford Law School's Reli
gious Liberty Clinic presented in front of the
Ventura City Council last Tuesday in defense
of Harbor Community Church, a residential
homeless ministry located in Ventura, Calif.
The clinic's involvement marks a year
since the program's founding, during which
the clinic the first of its kind in the country
has worked on 19 cases spanning cate
gories from prisoner rights and employment
discrimination to constitutional free exercise
and religious land use.
From Stanford to Ventura
Clinic members began work on the Ven
tura case last fall when they received a call
from Harbor pastor Sam Gallucci, who asked
for help with applying for a Conditional Use
Permit (CUP) that would allow Harbor to keep
its doors open.

Gallucci opened Harbor's doors to the
homeless when he became pastor in 2008, of
fering Harbor's members resources ranging
from food to clothing to Bible study.
Ventura residents brought Harbor to the
city's attention when they noticed the size of
the congregation had doubled after the city
launched efforts in 2011 and 2012 to clear
out Ventura's homeless population, ranging
from sweeping homeless encampments along
the bottom of Ventura River to prohibiting
panhandling in certain areas of the city.
According to an article published in April
2013 in the Ventura County Star, Harbor's
critics felt the church operated as a social serv
ices provider and existed in excessive physical
proximity to homes and the local elementary
school.
"We took them on as a religious liberty
clinic because their zoning issues directly cor
related to their religious mission," said Court-
ney Quiros J.D.'l4, a Clinic mem
ber. "They're a church, and they
should be able to operate as they
see a church should operate."

The case at Ventura
After the Clinic decided to take
on the case, James Sonne, director
of the Clinic, sent students to Ven
tura to interview the client.

"Meeting the client is some
thing you can't replicate in the class
room," Sonne noted, emphasizing
the importance of understanding
the client before proceeding with
further casework. "Now it's a real
person with a real problem."
After the Ventura City Planning
Commission voted to deny the CUP
application that Clinic students
drafted on Harbor's behalf, stu
dents began constructing an appeal
to the Ventura City Council.

"Part of what makes the Reli
gious Liberty Clinic such an amaz
ing experience is the variety of ar
eas of the law that it exposes stu
dents to," said Paul Harold J.D. 'l4,
a Clinic participant.
"The idea," Sonne added, "is
that you're out there actually doing
[law]. Good lawyers should be able
to navigate tricky human situations
because, at bottom, that's what
we're talking about from a legal
perspective."

Quiros and Harold undertook
interviews, conducted legal re
search and prepared to draft an ap
peal to the Ventura City Council.
The appeal, which was submit
ted in November 2013, claimed
the city's refusal to grant Harbor a
CUP violated the Religious Land
Use and Institutionalized Persons
Act, or RLUIPA, which protects re
ligious groups against zoning re
strictions unless the government
has a compelling interest in limit
ing such land use.
On Jan. 26, Sonne and four
fellow Clinic students drove to
Ventura to present in front of the
City Council, bringing together
months of work with case support

ers and the city of Ventura to an
end. It was show time.
The final stretch
The next day, Clinic students
presented at a six-hour hearing in
front of the Council. Peyton Gulley
J.D.'l5, presented the Clinic's
case. Other speakers included two
interfaith groups with an interest
in the case and local residents who
opposed the CUR
Although Clinic students and
Harbor will have to wait until
March to receive a final decision
from the Council, Quiros expound
ed on the importance of continu
ing work on unresolved cases from
quarter to quarter.
"Religious liberty is an issue
that is important no matter where
we fall on the political spectrum,"
she said, "no matter whether we
consider ourselves religious or not,
no matter where we come from."

Beyond the Ventura case, Clin
ic students are currently working
with an array of clients ranging
from a Muslim prisoner who was
denied the right to wear a kufi in
prison to Sikh truck drivers who
were fired when they refused to
cut their hair for drug testing.
Sonne explained how each of
the Clinic's cases, whether dealing
with religious land use or employ
ment discrimination, has implica
tions beyond the law itself.

"You can read about this stuff
in a book or get a prepackaged set
of facts," Sonne said, "but stu
dents' exposure to different cul
tures, different beliefs, different le
gal situations it's a deeply hu
man way to learn the nuts and
bolts of law."
Gallucci echoed Sonne's senti
ments in a written statement ex
pressing gratitude for the Clinic's
work and hope regarding the Har
bor verdict.

"Clinic students have been
with us every step of the way," Gal
lucci wrote, adding that their "con
sistent excellence and character"
