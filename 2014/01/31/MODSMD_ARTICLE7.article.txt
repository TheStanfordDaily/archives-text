# CIRCLE, Markaz, havens for spirituality
## Students of different faiths practice together

Wood paneling decorates the Center for
Inter-Religious Community, Learning and Ex
periences (CIRCLE) 's sanctuary room, which
is flooded with natural sunlight spilling into
the room through the sanctuary's wide win
dows. While the room has an air of spirituality
that is both comforting and respectful, what
truly marks the space as a home for inter-reli
gious community, learning and experiences,
however, are the banners hanging on the
Sanctuary's six pillars representing six popu
lar world religions: Islam, Hinduism, Christi
anity, Buddhism, Baha'i and Judaism.
CIRCLE, which opened in 2007, serves
as a home and a sanctuary for 35 Stanford As
sociated Religions (SAR) groups. Students can
relax in the spacious lounge, study in CIR
CLE'S religious library and even cook in CIR
CLE'S kitchen, all of which are located on the
third floor of Old Union. CIRCLE also offers
gender-specific wudu stations, where both
Muslim men and women can wash their feet
prior to entering the sanctuary for prayer.
"It is a place where people from many
different traditions can literally rub elbows
and move around in the same space with each
other," said Dean of Religious Life Scotty
McLennan. He noted that CIRCLE hosts both
multi-faith activities as well as activities spe
cific to certain religious traditions.
Nausheen Mahmood 'l4, vice president
of the Islamic Society of Stanford University,
said she uses the CIRCLE often, mostly for its
private office where Muslim students can go
in and pray throughout the day and the Sanc
tuary where they hold Friday prayer.
"For many years, the CIRCLE has been
the home base for the Muslim community,"
Mahmood said.

Although CIRCLE aims to provide an in
ter-religious community, the Markaz Resource
Center opened on the second floor of the
Nitery in September following advocacy by
the Muslim student community. The Markaz
consists of two rooms a lounge space and a
computer room and marks the culmination
of a 10-year project.
Students behind the development of the
Markaz, including Muslim Student Awareness

Network president Hana Al-Henaid 'l4 and
vice president Sayeh Fattahi' 14, had written a
series of proposals emphasizing the need for a
designated space for Stanford's Muslim stu
dent population to engage in discussion about
issues surrounding their culture and identity.

The distinction between CIRCLE and the
Markaz Resource Center is highlighted by the
word "resource" within the Markaz's name.
For the Stanford Muslim community, CIRCLE

is used for strictly religious programs and
events such as Qu'ran study groups and
prayer, whereas the Markaz Resource Center
offers community events that focus on the
cultural, political and social aspects of Muslim
life at Stanford.

Al-Henaid and Fattahi said they were sat
isfied with the form that the Markaz has tak
en, and added that they were excited to see
how the center will grow and develop over
the years, particularly in terms of steps taken
to address mental health.

"It would be great to have somebody
who could address the mental health con
cerns within the Stanford student population
who identify as Muslim, culturally or reli
giously," Al-Henaid said.
McLennan asserted that having a variety
of spaces for inter-religious community-build
ing is necessary not only for enriching the un
dergraduate experience, but also for prepar
ing Stanford students for the world beyond.
"I think the way to do religious life at Stan
ford is to have people in a community, in rela
tionship to each other, in cooperative spirit,"
McLennan said. "A university like Stanford
should make sure students leave inter-reli
giously literate and inter-religiously relational."
