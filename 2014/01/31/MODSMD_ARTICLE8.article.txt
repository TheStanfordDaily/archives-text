## Op-Ed 17 Reasons Lists Are Making You Dumber 
### 
You live in a silo. The internet has conferred upon us agency
we never dreamed we could have. We make choices about
our media consumption habits, choices that were, for the
most part, unavailable to our parents.
They were confined to what newspaper they bought, and
the information that was neatly packed into its pages, whereas
we can idly shift from tab to tab, going wherever our momentary
attention span takes us. In the media universe, we are the pilots
of our vessel, zipping from planet to planet.

In an ideal world this would mean each individual media
consumer becomes more intelligent, drawing from a wider vari
ety of media, a larger array of outlets and becoming a better,
more informed citizen, with a better understanding of what he
or she believes in, and why.
It would mean people would come to their personal view
points after having them challenged by contrary arguments, dia
metrically opposed points of view, which they could do as easily
as they could type in search terms on Google.
And yet, this revolution in media has ushered in an era
where the exact opposite attitude prevails. People now seek me

dia that does nothing but confirm their own visceral, intuitive be
liefs. Confirmation bias is rife, and one need not venture further
than TV news to observe this phenomenon in full, repugnant
swing.

Instead of using the incredible potential of modern tech
nologies that allow unfettered access to content of every orien
tation, we have closed ourselves into a corner, where every stat
ed opinion merely acts as a vain mechanism for us to nod along,
unthinkingly, reveling in the illusory correctness of our own be
liefs.

We consider the only point of view that is valid for us, and
in doing so lose out on any critical evaluation of our beliefs. Our
intellect atrophies, and what constitutes an argument these days
is merely a repetition of the points read on some website which
merely articulates our views better than we can. The Internet al
so allows us to become lazier, too, with list-laden articles de
signed to manipulate our behavioral biases into spending hours
on click-bait sites.

There is an obvious, glaring remedy here, and it's to actively,
emphatically and voraciously consume news, opinion journalism,
essays and the like, of all creeds and of all philosophical under

pinnings. Do not settle for what you agree with; purposefully
seek out that which confuses you, annoys you, bothers you, un
settles you, even, because then you begin to grasp the signifi
cance and values of your own beliefs.
Look for difficult articles, those that require an investment
of time and emotion. Embrace long-form and leave the lists for
diversion. Forget slideshows and start thinking and engaging the
media. As smart young people at this tremendous institution, it
would be a disservice to the education we are receiving to not
do just this.
So seek out contrarianism, a diversity of opinion. Find a
news source that particularly enrages you, and consider that
emotion, and where it comes from, and what it means. Question
your reactions, hold up the author's argument to your own, and
then, only after a process that is both exploratory and rigorous,
conclude on an opinion that you've not just mimicked, but one
that you have earned.
As the managing editor of opinions since July of last year,
I've enjoyed myself tremendously bringing together a sharp
group of writers to contribute in the best way possible to the
campus conversation. And whether they have represented the
Left, the Right, the Up or the Down, their voices have been wel
comed and encouraged in this medium, as it should be.

I want to thank all those individuals that have made this
space to engaging, so polemical and so thought provoking since
they began writing. Whatever failings the section may have had,
you cannot argue that it was shallow, unambitious or that it
resided in its own, self-important silo. I also want to thank all of
the contributors that added diversity and a certain excitement to
the section, and without whom this project would have been se
verely limited.
On a final note, never be afraid to write or to post a submis
sion to The Daily whenever you feel you can add to the conver
sation. Writing is a beautiful thing, and the taut, lean medium of
print journalism can compel clarity you never thought you could
manage. We forget how important writing is, and that it's an ideal
medium to distill and illuminate your thoughts, simply by virtue
of its limitations. Putting pen to paper (or finger to keyboard)
forces a lucidity that is relevant to so many of the thinking and de
cision processes that govern life.
It can be an intimidating medium, because your words must
speak for themselves, with no room for you to supplement or
add to your argument ex post facto. Your words are bare, and
even under layers of equivocation and jargon, you are, in away,
exposed. And that's why writing, especially in this medium, with
its constraints, can be so agonizing and yet so rewarding.
No side has a monopoly on the truth. Bias is choice, so no
perspective is without its biases. Hubris is a dangerous thing, and
it is being encouraged by our sloppy consumption of the media.
And this behavior is applicable to Stanford and beyond. The
"techies" don't always have it right, and the "fuzzies" don't ei
ther. The Left won't solve the world's problems on its own, just
as the Right won't do the same. And this acceptance of modera
tion, of nuance, becomes all the more easy when you take a
more broad-minded and flexible approach to the media.

So write more, read more, read different and don't take the
(click-)bait. Step outside of the silo. It'll make a world of differ
ence.
