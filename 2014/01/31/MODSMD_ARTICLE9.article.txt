### MICHAEL PETERSON DESK EDITOR 
mosphere around the team and in the locker
room with the season just around the corner?

With Stanford's baseball season begin
ning on Feb. 14, The Daily's Michael Pe
terson talked with senior second base
man Danny Diekroeger to discuss the up
coming campaign.

Danny Diekroeger (DD): I think it's really
exciting. Everyone's itching to get going. It's
a fun time of the year because we really have
a long road ahead of us but we just want to
get started. I'd say it's exciting.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What's the at TSD: Does the atmosphere feel different

from previous years?
DD: Yeah, it does feel different from previ
ous years. I think for me, having gone
through it and been here a couple of sea
sons, I know what to expect. Obviously, it's
a slightly different group of guys with some
good experience at the top, so a lot of guys
sort of know what to expect.

TSD: Has it been any different for you
preparing for this season knowing that it's
your last season on the Farm?

DD: Yeah, a little bit. I definitely want to
take full advantage of it and leave no regrets
or anything and make sure I'm working as
hard as I can, because I'm going to miss this
place when I'm gone. I know that. I'm really
looking forward to enjoying every moment
of it.

TSD: What's it been like to have Ryan Garko
on the coaching staff and what kind of an im
pact has he had so far?

DD: It's been awesome to have someone
coming in with the experience that he has.
It's great knowing that he went through the
program and had just about as good of a year
as you can have in college baseball. And ob
viously, he went on to play in the big
leagues. He's really already brought so much

to the table for me as a hitter and all the
other guys too, just bringing in that expe
rience and having someone to talk to. He
knows a ton about hitting. He also brings a
good energy. It's nice to have another
young coach on board not too far in age
from us. It's been great.

TSD: How do you go about trying to re
place the great talents you lost to the MLB,
guys like Mark Appel, Austin Wilson and
Brian Ragira?

DD: It's going to be tough. I don't think in
dividually we're going to replace them. But
I know we have plenty of guys who can all
step up and pull their own weight. Hope
fully, this year we will have more of a bal
anced team with all kinds of guys con
tributing and picking each other up. In the
past, I feel like we sort of relied on one or
two guys to carry the weight, and then if
they didn't, it put a lot of pressure on them
and we had some failures there. [Now] it's
a really strong group. I'm really looking for
ward to seeing who steps up and who fills
what roles because I really think we have
the talent to do that.

TSD: Have any of the freshmen or sopho
mores stood out to you in practice?

DD: Several of the freshman pitchers have
been really good. I look forward to seeing
them pitch. Positionwise, we have a few
guys: Tommy Edman in the infield; Alex
Dunlap playing first base and corner out
field; [outfielder] Jack Klein. Three offen
sive guys who are all going to play this year
at some point. It's going to be really excit
ing.

TSD: What are your expectations for the
team this season?

DD: I expect that our team is going to
have more of a well-defined character. I
think we're going to play better as a team,
we're going to adjust a little bit to the
small-ball game, try to be a little more effi
cient moving guys over on the bases and
scoring runs. And I expect some wins.
