mosphere around the team and in the locker
room with the season just around the corner?

With Stanford's baseball season begin
ning on Feb. 14, The Daily's Michael Pe
terson talked with senior second base
man Danny Diekroeger to discuss the up
coming campaign.

Danny Diekroeger (DD): I think it's really
exciting. Everyone's itching to get going. It's
a fun time of the year because we really have
a long road ahead of us but we just want to
get started. I'd say it's exciting.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What's the at TSD: Does the atmosphere feel different

from previous years?
DD: Yeah, it does feel different from previ
ous years. I think for me, having gone
through it and been here a couple of sea
sons, I know what to expect. Obviously, it's
a slightly different group of guys with some
good experience at the top, so a lot of guys
sort of know what to expect.

TSD: Has it been any different for you
preparing for this season knowing that it's
your last season on the Farm?

DD: Yeah, a little bit. I definitely want to
take full advantage of it and leave no regrets
or anything and make sure I'm working as
hard as I can, because I'm going to miss this
place when I'm gone. I know that. I'm really
looking forward to enjoying every moment
of it.

TSD: What's it been like to have Ryan Garko
on the coaching staff and what kind of an im
pact has he had so far?

DD: It's been awesome to have someone
coming in with the experience that he has.
It's great knowing that he went through the
program and had just about as good of a year
as you can have in college baseball. And ob
viously, he went on to play in the big
leagues. He's really already brought so much
